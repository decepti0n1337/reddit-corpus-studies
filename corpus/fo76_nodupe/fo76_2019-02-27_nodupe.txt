I leave unwanted gear, ammo, and recipes in the toolbox at the overseers camp for new players, but I didnt know there was an encounter spawn there... I guess it is time to find a new hiding spot.  
---
---
---
Sweet, already have Baseball Bat plans. All I need is a Chicken mask and I'm set.
---
Where can I find those?
---
Yeah.  I'm glad they are going to fix this.  I almost lost a good set when I dropped the wrong one.
---
This is the kind of question we would really appreciate the dev's chiming in on but they never seem to care about these real questions.
---
Unfortunatly I don't but I would love to see your church when your finished with it! 
---
Yes, a miracle baby.
---
Yeah I got it started the church shell is done now just need the little stuff you know but yeah you can come see if you want too 
---
Riding the hype wave. I can believe that.
---
*OwO, what's this? * It's your **3rd Cakeday** McChoaderton! ^(hug)
---
Dealing any damage to an enemy. Even if you only deal 1 damage you can still loot a corpse and get XP.
---
Not at all. There is a very low chance everytime you scrap one, you'll receive a mod. 
---
Thank you! The front is pretty plain, I tried to mix up the walls to make it have some variety but I'd much rather spend budget on the inside. I had 10% saved for a pet but if I don't get one I might fix it up a bit. 
---
It's only about 700-1000 caps. Just collect all the loose junk in the Whitesprings Resort and sell it for 200 caps, then sell any left over junk to the Whitesprings station vendor for another 200, then basically just collect any and all junk and sell it to Raider vendorbots for 200, the Harper's Ferry bot for 200, the BOS bot for another 200.
---

---
Selling scrap is a great way of making caps. Weapons and armor get more money faster, too. Basically look through your stash, grab everything you don't need and sell it.
---
I don't watch oxhorn. You called him a Fallout YouTuber,  so I assumed that was his focus. I assumed wrong. 
---
The main point however stands. It never was, not once advertised as a custom glass bottle. 
---
I'm not sure why Oxhorn wouldn't see that coming. I didn't order because a) I'm not a rum kind of guy. B) A video game tie in Liquor priced at 80. Not gonna be a custom bottle. 
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah that sounds like a good idea I’ll try it thank you a lot for the idea bro
---
If you play maybe twice a week and evenly spaced you may have more luck, just play Fortnite or CS:Go in between FO76.
---
Good idea, dude.

A response stating they are working on a fix for a broken weekly challenge which has since expired. 
---
What if selecting the SIPHON holotape just closes the insert holotape menu without loading the holotape?
---
&gt;You called him a Fallout YouTuber, so I assumed that was his focus. I assumed wrong. 
---
He is a fallout youtuber, he just also happens to be a liquor and cigar aficianado that drinks high end liqour and cigars on stream while playing fallout.
---
Yes it was, even oxhorn was led to believe that. He is one of the biggest bethesda shills out there, yet even he called it out for the garbage it is, it was dirt cheap rum in a 3d printed shell. The way it was advertised originally it was advertised to be like the nuka cola drinks they sold at target which were glass bottled.
---
Hello there. This challenge has now expired. Any possible update or ATOM compensation please? Thank you.
---
The Gun Runner's Arsenal is $2. That came with a dozen weapons, dozens of weapon mods and 20 challenges. And you're telling me a straw hat is worth more than all that put together?
---
This. 
---
It's always good to back up a Melee build with some range capability.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It might be the new Vegas done in F4, which would be cool. But I guess we're going to have to wait and see 
---
About to hop on, sorry for the wait :) 
---
I couldve swore it just made people more radiation resistant but yeah...Trog lifes mater..down with the b.o.s deserter ummm he picked the wrong wife etc etc..
---
I love pvp my fav tactic is to get a low level to attack high levels then kill the high levels and take there junk and caps can i join 
---
Does anybody know how to edit this so I can wrap the text?
---
Thank you for saying that.  Fallout 76 has been plagued with so many bad reviews.. I've felt like I was the only person who hasn't had an absolutely terrible experience playing it.  
---
That’s the point, there’s a lot of people out there without the plans, but they’ve got the levels to install the mods.
---
Like for the longest time I had a really good legendary handmade, but couldn’t mod it because it was the only one I’d ever found for nearly 50 levels, can’t learn mods if there’s nothing to scrap.
---
It’s easier now you can buy a lot of the plans, but it’s still a problem, especially for armor
---
I had this problem a while back.  Apparently the issue was that I had too many holotapes in my inventory.  Once I dropped a bunch of the ones I wasn’t using and tried again it worked. (Not sure why)
---
Keep in mind, low level players are possibly second characters, which means they are only low in levels, but definetly not lacking the knowledge to maximize their potential.
---
people have told me that the unlocks are random..i dont think thats true..but with other guns this is one of the first which is unlocked..this may not be a mod at all for that particular gun
---
No more, no less than you must have felt when you decided to share that image. LOL.
---
I was able to kill him.   You just have to be creative.   I was not, however, able to find his corpse. I did find a normal dog's corpse in the area that I killed him, so maybe he reverts back to his normal form once you defeat him.
---
By the way, you're all wrong.  His name is Stretch.
---
when he ran away from u..during that time he definitely switched his armor and weapons
---
If you still have this problem and you are on ps4 just hit me up. My account is Lucky\_Lock\_115
---
&gt; Or the option to permanently align with a faction after you hit a certain level to access unique loot   
---
That makes more sense, if they ever wanted the life of the game to be driven by player interaction. What I'd give to align with other players and play / take territory / do battle as members of the Enclave, or BOS, etc.
---
It is yet another known bug with the game, drop off a bunch of your holotapes, when you have a certain amount of holotapes they stop being able to be loaded into terminals. So drop off a bunch of the holotapes you don't need and then it will work.
---
Yes, the game is good now, but as the stress tests were rolling, the game... was kinda bad. There are some things I hate in this game (the server hopping to get stuff for exemple) but if this game was a “true” fallout game, not online and without the excessive grinding, it would be the perfect game for me. The visuals, the photo mode, the *awesome* creatures, the lighting, the camp building... it could’ve been an amazing game. I appreciate your positivity, something I couldn’t keep up with throughout the months. 
---
Same issue.  Just drop every holo you have and the load the siphon tape. You will be good to go. 
---
Timestamp for the quote in the title is [11:35](https://youtu.be/Jye0qxKOF4Y?t=695)
---
didnt work
---
didnt work, did a fresh install and still not working. 
---
Was it only $2? I thought it was like $5. Anyways, I wouldn't spend real money on either. I'd have the option of getting the straw hat for free, but I'm not interested in it even then. 
---
tried it and it didn't work, even tried a fresh install and nothing.
---
Glowing stretchy boi
---
You sir are doing a service and deserve a reward for your actions! 
---
It’s definately a mod, I found the attachable version from a vendor (and applied it), foolishly though I gave scorched killers a go and now want it back lol
---
Pvp?
---
Anti armor is a legendary prefix.
---
Yeah just don't scrap it because you think you can just craft another. 
---
An "ingredient" to craft another black diamond is... Black diamond. 
---
It could run on my handy fuel and only work if you have enough and constantly feed it. 
---
Shit, you're right. Had additional carry weight on a couple pieces, forgot it unequips when you get in. Thanks!
---
Yep overdrive comes to mind
---
And yet here you are, *still* on the subreddit
---
It does. Gonna look into calibrated shocks. Thanks!
---
Yet, WoW's servers never had issue keeping track of hundreds of skills, food buffs, casted buffs, gear, auras, ETC. With thousands on a single server. Why shouldn't bethesda's servers be able to handle less than that for only 24 people? That is smaller than some of the raids in WoW back in the early 2000's. 
---
If they could make servers handle that back then, they have NO excuse on why servers can't handle that today.
---
Gave me a chuckle, pretty much what the game is really.
---
not sure why you haven't tried warframe yet. you'll have more fun, play a better game, and won't get banned for playing too much, cuz more than half of warframe players are addicted 
---
Heavy BOS Mod Combat Armor
---
do u have most gunsmith perks unllocked? i was never able to unlock the supressor mod on the hunting rifle and then i unlocked level 4..and..poof..it just appeared
---
Level 5, but I may not have had it applied, I’ll give that a go, cheers!
---
Oh no, muh karma for being honest!
---
*downvote this one too guys, that'll prove me wrong*
---
before you got banned from FO76
---
2nd?
---
When was the first?
---
Got it from them, thank you so much for your help, you’re a legend!
---
allright where do i find it?
---
The mini nuke planter and an outfit I believe have been added in on sale :)
---
Edit: it’s the camouflage suit!
---
Yeah, it's not just the witch hat though.  Headwear in general was fixed.  The category didn't appear in the crafting menu before.
---
The confederate hat is still an issue, because apparently it doesn't actually exist in the game.  The plans for it are there, but the hat isn't.
---
The plans are a super rare event drop but can also be rarely found on Watoga vendor (not train station)
---
Nice! I don't think I built a proper camp until well past level 20 because I didn't know what to do with it. This looks good.
---
There's a mod for Fallout 4 that does this.  In theory it shouldn't be terribly hard to implement, since modders were able to last time around.
---
...roast meat, salty meat, meaty meat!
---
You perhaps know what events?
---
Switch your AutoGrenade to long barrel. Same damage, less weight, more durability. 
---
Yes but they differ between silos
---
Census violence has highest I think, Surface to Air, Distant Thunder, A Line in The Sand
---
Ok thank you!
---
Wasn't Hunter's Hood actually removed  before patch 6?
---
Shameless plug... If you're on Xbox my husband runs a PA mod shop and can install shocks for you.

Good read. Thanks!

Sorry but I’m sick of seeing these latecomer post. It’s a cheap attempt to get free internet points by diehards in this Reddit. The thing about latecomer post is that they weren’t there when this game was an utter mess and it will take him sometime to see there’s not end game content. Enjoy the game and all but you’ll see some of what the community has been talking about sooner or later. 
---
It makes sense. The Overseer even states that we need to rebuild America, but we can't have towns.

I haven’t broken a weapon on a queen fight in ages. Is PC just overpowered? Most queen fights I’ve been in in the last month are 15minutes or less, often 5 or less...
---
But I haven’t been in many in the last month, not many nuke drops!
---
Neato. I'm personally a fan of builds that don't hover in the air too much, so the walls you used around the entry stairs help. You might consider going one step further and adding a back room to the 2nd level, and then adding pillars to both the front and back parts of that level. It'll make the place seem a lot more grounded.

I just reached lvl 22 on PS4. Some guy gave me some water, stim packs and rad away which helps me out so much. I was struggling hard. Although I really wish I could explore Whitesprings but every enemy is level 68 on every server.
---
Have you used plasma in a while? To fix the hit issues, they made them instant. There’s no projectile, just a green splash where you hit. 
---
It seems you can buy them in grafton?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6OTOSxst74
---
Extremely rare
---
I tried this, and it still didnts work. I even did a clean install of the game and it's still missing
---
The fact that duping (transactions flooding the server architecture) degraded the performance proves the point.
---
YOU have ZERO (WTF clown) idea what infrastructure (hosted, on/off-prem, fixed/scalable) Bethesda has supporting their platform VS WoW, other games, etc.
---
I only pointedbout the architectural limitation NOT condone it.
---
You can get them at all vendors if that extremely small chance procks 
---
I think it was 4,as of a couple of hours ago. 
---
I hope to come across it real soon then. All I ever pick up is junk legendary-ish crap.
---
This could be really neat.  Instead of having to keep 6 or 8 points in int for swapping to the 200% repair perks, just allow players to craft and sell 200% repair kits.
---
I know what I’m doing when I get home. 
---
I do loads of pvp, raiding factories is easier than plucking corn to me. I have reached the cap limit twice so far, and it is all generated from pvp. My stash is full of junk that I never farmed, yet collect from my unfortunate foes...
---
Above all this, I don't grief. I do not blow up camps or slap players to death. I don't bother with low levels, and prefer stacked teams, high risk, high reward.
---
I mostly play alone, but I also ride with a solid raiding group. Its fun, esp. When you keep it with some limits.
---
My point is, you can play it ultimately pvp without the need to grief.
---
Not true, combat armor is balanced (and BoS mod gives more energy resist), leather has like 2x energy resist. Marine and trapper have slightly more physical resist, but barely, and robot is also balanced. Metal and Raider are intended to be heavy physical resistance. Choices. 
---
u/ladydevann are there any intentions from the team to add a chat system? 
---
Amazing, thanks!
---
Always love when the meat song gets referenced 
---
Happy birthday 
---
xbox pc or ps4?
---
Uhhhh... everything you listed is in game, just filter your stash to view only what you are looking for, and workbenches already pull from your stash wherever you are.
---
Lmao
---
 far cry myself, need my pick up duct tape fix
---
I hope you get justice and make a reddit post to get noticed or else Bethesda will ignore you
---
Under "advance power connectors" I bought plan from Harper's ferry about 200 caps
---
Xbone. Forgot to put that!
---
Great suggestion. Have an upvote.
---
That's awesome. I'm happy for you both!
---
To be fair assassin sental should not be in the game
---
welp i am out of the running then. i am pc &gt;\_&lt;.
---
Starting to think most reddit users are on xbox or ps4.
---
I did rifleman because I figured it might be better to have 2 separate weapons for a build, however I can always change skills eventually 
---
Out of all the shit you could complain about, you choose an agility course?
---
Just a follow-up. I am not condoning nor making excuses for Bethesda. But you do not know the architecture of the game code nor supporting infrastructure.
---
I gave my opinion for the performance issues.
---
I am new to FO games, bought during Christmas. My second week, I thought...this is like playing on a WIN95 PC, with a dial-up (56k) connection (remember Doom?). That is how I felt.
---
You're supposed to after trying the SIPHON terminal in the armor bench room, go down to the central command and use a SignIt terminal. Insert SIPHON Holotape and click "Play Holotape". After, you go back to the first terminal, in the workbench room, and do the same thing. ((Don't go to the project and press download data. Just insert the tape and find where it says "Play Holotape" and do that and it will work.)) I had all my blanks on me and it didn't matter.
---
Do you go on vacation for the experience or the souvenir?

I'm The Granny. I had a hand in raising every last one of you heckin sprats that was born in the Vault and you best let me give you stimpaks and cookies when I see you.
---
Quest Rewards (items, Quest XP) are individual. But team members also get some token XP and caps when a quest (chain) is finished.. You can do them all at once, and it'll be faster/more convenient.
---
But if you run through it 3x it'll be slower but you'll net more XP and caps and loot out of it from killing everything 3x and group token XP.
---
Example:
---
Quest X is available for you 3.Player 1 starts quest 3, but player 2 and 3 hold off on quest actions and just assist with kills / escort through areas.Player 1 finishes Quest X for full rewards, Players 2 and 3 get token XP and caps. Everyone also gets the loot and XP from kills during quest.Repeat 2 more times, once for Player 2 and once for Player 3.
---
OR
---
Quest Y is available for you 3.All 3 players start quest and go through it together at the same time.All 3 players finish Quest Y at the same time and get full rewards for quest at the same time.
---
Less repetitive but less XP/loot as a result.
---
So basically the choice is between game flow / fun or trying to maximize leveling and loot.
---
The SIPHON holotape is the compiler and compacts the necessary data so it doesn't need the 183 tapes, just the one, by crushing all the data.
---
Hear hear!
---
My boyfriend pestered me forever to do this quest. I hated it so much. I failed NUMEROUS times... Even when I got mutations that allowed me to jump extra high... Stupidest thing ever.
---
Really? Huh, I might pick one up if I can in the near future.
---
Though aesthetically, the standard Laser Rifle appeals to me more, spewing hot plasma at my enemies is a very good substitute!
---
That sucks man
---
Thanks guys. I think I might just go with the sensor array if it doesn’t reappear after they fix vendor lists
---
Wasn’t me.  What’s interesting is you saw people sharing something and enjoying talking about it and you just had to walk in and shit on it quite poorly.  That speaks volumes about you.  
---
So Much This. Doing Mayor for a Day is a waste of All Rise if lower than level 50.
---
Pretty big difference in what perks are available for builds though, as well as the likelihood of having A-tier legendary weapons/armor.
---
Full Disclosure, I am on PC, currently Level 136, run a second alt that's mainly level 2/3 mainly to be a pack mule.  
---
I team on my primary with some guys who are 152, 107, and 68 (for now I believe).

I don’t *think* twisted muscles affects hip fire/ADS, just VATS, so it should be fine. Not 100% about that but I have it on my HW and haven’t felt like it’s a problem. 
---
Pump shotgun (in da face)
---
I've run about eight solo and more than a handful in groups since the last patch and I've noticed that the turrets weren't which really cuts the run time down, but now that you mention it, there may be additional assaultrons in there.
---
My advice to anyone that asks is always go in alone. The bigger the party the more robots you have to waste bullets on.

I use a sledge with + 40% dmg on power attacks for bounties.......just to be absolutely sure this kind of thing doesnt happen to me again 😂😂

Nyarlathotep Abides.
---
Then why did you say anything at all if you agree it's a bad game? Because that's what I said, and I also said that what people want is Fo4 with co-op. This isn't a good survival game, and it's not a good Fallout Co-op.
---
I'm going to assume English isn't you're first language.

What is it with this whole idea of private servers? That is what I don’t understand, why would they ever give people the chance to loose customers. I mean I guess if they relegate private users to a shitter crapper base vision as like token ‘here you go’ then bring out lots of nice toys for people who stay subscribed. But no other MMO has ever willingly gone down the route of giving away something without wanting money in return. 
---
Let’s face it, they haven’t exactly made it transparent on how they tend to monetise the game going forwards. Will they go the yearly DLC route where you effectively pay to play in big yearly sums. I personally hope so as it the model I’m familiar with and it generally means you get a decent bit of content rolling forwards. 
---
High charisma melee build.  Tame every creature.  Become the beastmaster.
---
Also use Contractor perk, it makes the flux cost much less (use contractor for all camp building really)
---
76 got a lot of hate. Not all undeserved but quite exaggerated nevertheless. also the series has a lot of single rpg fans and 76 was not what they wanted. Anthem released with a lot of issues as well. However there is no prior fanbase and people seem a bit more accepting.
---
Thank you :)
---
Plant your CAMPs at different points of the map so you can fast travel to one, then bring the rest of the party there.
---
Tag screws, lead and gears ASAP. 
---
Personally I found coop more fun when doing events, doing quests was kinda tough, lining up to read terminals, etc.
---
Yeah Gutsys be spawning the second you touch it. 
---
Yes. 
---
There are a lot of different problems with this game. I chose to plant my flag here.
---
It’s pretty crappy for them to make something like this a required part of a quest.
---
Not clean :/
---
Don't forget to yell "get of my lawn" the next time you whip out that bad boy at the prime.
---
Nice, I can't wait to rename All Rise to Queen Pounder.
---
You don't even need to do the course legit, just hit the buttons in order. It's ridiculously easy.
---
If you're struggling with that to the point of genuine rage, then fine motor skills aren't the only thing you lack, dudebro.

Not since patch that they gave more plans to vendors. No longer there. Or anywhere. ☹️

I can build military grade power armor from scratch but i cant unding a car.

This guy is the real deal.

Do you make X01 mods?

I finished this quest on my 16th attempt.  Don’t quit now.

Ign ACEpickles60, look me up. I will help. (PC)
---
Is there a fallout circlejerk sub, those are less toxic usually
---
I can scrap a complete steel car, but not a small plastic crate.
---
Was 900h guy proven a cheater while I was napping? I thought the debate was still out. 
---
I had a blast going through 50 levels as a stealth sniper. Around level 50ish, I became a power armor melee addict. I still have rifleman perks maxed out but bumped up my 2h melee. I hit like a freight train from a distance but can hold my own up close and personal. 
---
Definitely one of my more wholesome experiences, that's for sure. Thank you!
---
Ah when there isn't a nuke at prime, he wanders at whitesprings I see. Every 76 player knows long dog :)
---
You can get all achievements with the same character, nothing  prevent that. Except maybe a bug in the game.
---
I have a blast with heavy weapons and stealth sniper builds. Two handed melee is the meta atm though. 
---
anti armor.
---
I shouldn’t have to bribe my kids to complete part of an RPG for me.
---
After 25 years of playing them, it’s kinda disheartening.
---
I do not enjoy platformers. I never have. I’m that guy who never beat Mario Brothers without Gameshark codes... 
---
oh come on....so impossible to find now?
---
Glass cannon sniper build with 20% health, adrenal reaction, bloodied weapon, nerd rage, full Unyielding. Very little survives more than 1 hit and the things that do, still can’t find me with 3/3 sneak, escape artist, ultralight armor, and 30 agility. Only scorchbeasts are a threat because they’ll spam where they THINK I am with explosive sonic blasts. But a Strange in Numbers Marsupial leap usually gets me out of the blast zone, and a Dense torso mod helps when I can’t evade it. 
---
Who cares about durability when your ultracite laser rifle (max lvl bloodied etc.) still struggles with early game mobs :(
---
I hope we get something like this in the future! My hope for things like this is what keeps me coming back to the game.
---
Check the Sutton or Flatwoods vendor.  I’ve seen the Pew plans often, so one of those two will most likely have it.
---
Well if you close your eyes, turn off the xbox and load the adventures of the PTSD closet children you can! 
---
Why does someone need more than 25000 caps in the games current state? Nothing costs that much, and even if you spend a lot of it, you can easily earn at least 1000 a day if you wanted.
---
Whats your psn? 
---
Damn near it. You can attempt to get from other players. But I personally haven't seen them since. I still need the legs. ☹️
---
Yes.  Hopefully by then they will be confident enough that the duper problem is resolved that they will increase the caps max for us.  Transferring caps to alts out of necessity is bothersome and zeroing out a vendor to realize after the fact that you've maxed out is a terrible feeling.
---
This would be an awesome addition. 
---
I can make a futuristic plasma gattling cannon, but I'm not sure how to melt bullets.
---
I couldnt put the game down for the first month or so i loved it! Then i hit level 90 and felt i kinda reached the end game and havent really been on since.. But dont get me wrong ill be back when more content releases!
---
Reddit did the math and figured out he couldn't get that amount of ammo in 30 days and all the negativity upset them 
---
Build an unbreakable concrete fortress near WS. Put Sirens in and leave them on.
---
I’ve heard Swinging on a Star and I didn’t participate in the BETA. I think their randomization algorithm is messed up. The playlist has 48 songs and in a single play session (few hours) i’ll only get like the same 12 songs it feels like. I think i’ll start to track the song occurrences for some actual data. 
---
It's not in Charleston fire department I checked multiple servers it's not there
---
I like that idea maybe something like creating a town where camps are linked together but don’t have a shared budget. That way they could still work without the need for all players to be online at the same time. 
---
My character spent years as Vault Security, yet I can't even find my old armor anywhere.
---
Bridge keepers robes!
---
Appriciate the thought!
---
  
---
I haven't played a game on my pc in three years.
---
Mainly because it's downstairs and I feel less like I'm avoiding my family if I play on the console.
---
Maybe you should give it a little more time. Assuming you're using nuka crypt?
---
I'm thinking you'd also have had to do the Fire Responder course too? The one running around Charleston? I f$#@!ing hated that one, cos I'm an unco unit and jeot falling off buildings or walkways. Just keep at it.
---
Yeah I love it too, this sub is packed with people who like to bitch about “glitches” that they don’t realize are just part of the games mechanics. I will say the legendary loot needs fixing. And while the servers are better, they’re not where they should be. But I still love it when it isn’t crashing. 
---
I apologize for having an emotional reaction to something I found incredibly frustrating and decided to let the developer know how it made me feel,
---
Can't you just run through it and press all the buttons? Surely you can skip some part of it.
---
Melee is about as far from opposite to sneak sniper as you can get and it's very OP in this the game, so if you were wanting something different it's a good choice. Or if you wanted different, but challenging, maybe heavy weapons, they don't do as much damage as they should
---
Just hover over the item in their inventory and there is an option to view it to see it’s stats and legendary effects. It’s been in the game since day 1. 
---
Don't worry, I forgive you &lt;3
---
whilst listening to "Bicycle Race" on my dang pip boy! Banfunsda GIVE US THIS ONE THING!
---
There isn't enough acid in game for the to be a thing lol
---
Rainbowbro420 
---
Again gear should not be a player it should allow the player to have a leg up on others on there skill level
---
I don't have time to jump on and take advantage of your offer. Not to mention, I'd like to throw some caps at you just for being awesome. So.... how many caps and what would the materials cost be for a set of T51b calibrated shocks and a jetpack?
---
I buy it from whitespring resort hunting shop 
---
This is a "clean" version. It doesn't have the dirt and grime of the regular version. Same with the greaser jacket. 
---
PA has the name in the mod with the exception of the Excavator which would be something like Medic Pump where others would be T-45 Medic Pump or X0-1 Medic Pump.
---
HUNTING SHOP! Of course! Thanks buddy, I’ll check now.
---
Thank You for the kind words and Your Welcome, it was great to help out a fellow Vault Dweller. 
---
I remember what it was like when I started out and when I arrived at Flatwood, a player in PA approached me and said Hi and gave me a Legendary Level 5  Somerset Special .44 Pistol with recon scope and some ammo. This gun has save my low level life so many time that I wanted to keep it but last month, gave it to a new player who I hope could give the gun the same care that I did. I only ask for them to pay it forward as the previous owner asked of me.
---
And now I ask of you snebic that when you get higher in levels, to please Pay It Forward and to help make the game a better experience for players. And for anyone else, my house is behind Red Rocket in Flatwood so stop by and say Hi and feel free to use the Radiation Shower and there's water out back for the taking and work benches inside.

---
I was really hoping for those new stairs. 
---
This dedicated to you my friend https://youtu.be/GugsCdLHm-Q
---
I’m not worried about it personally, I was really glad for the help. There’s plenty of other challenging stuff in the game and a lot of other things to enjoy.  I just know there’s things I’m not good at, and that includes all things having to do with balance, jumping, walking in a straight line, etc etc ;)
---
I believe a large number of the group that tested codes for Nukacrypt was banned recently and therefore the process has been stalled. There are some comments about it.
---
If you're impatient, go shoot down 500 cargobots and get to testing. I mean, what's the problem?
---
I was able to get through the Responder course on my 5th or 6th try after I figured out that the other button was by the Capitol building and not in the half-crumbled building. 
---
Between the rope and the balance beam, I can’t get to the diamonds between the buttons without falling almost every time on this godforsaken agility course.
---
I’ve tried slowing down on those parts. It hasn’t helped me in the slightest.
---
Thank You for the kind words as well.
---
It wont necessary look the same. While road leathers are the new equivalent of the leather armor from three, it's underneath the armor and now sacrifices have to be made for the aesthetic of the armor on other limbs/body.
---
Waiting for you on PC
---
Doesn’t seem like there is anyway to skip through this in order to get through the Brotherhood quest. All the points need to be completed in a specific order.
---
If they haven't appeared in 4 I'm doubting it appearing in 76 :/. The trend appears to be a new asset artist creating these outfits since 4
---
None, so far. I've identified several others which are also missing, which is irritating. Thanks for the background info, though!
---
Does this fing game even care about legit players who didn't Dupe?
---
Fuck me.  X7 vendors at 200/24hrs, gives me less than 1200 caps (travel costs) every 24 ACTUAL hours.
---
The cost for most decent crap is already 3-4.5 k, meaning I have to jump all over and waste hour+ every day for nearly 4 days to buy one giddamn thing and your going to RAISE prices?
---
Fuck that.  You've nerfed new rky every semi functional part of the game and continue to do it, rather than fix shit.
---
The ONLY THING players are buying from each other are 3 star legendary items, mostly dupes,and ammo.
---
Even that Isa shit fest of scams and griefer bait as is.
---
My god, I see this,and I give up.  I'll join that list of people suing you for a refund Bethesda.
---
Worst. Game. Ever. 
---
1 man's trash is another's treasure. I found this to be 1 of the only interesting and unique aspects of any of the quests. I'm sorry to say it man, but it was a very basic level control required, like complaining the puzzle doors easy enough for children to solve in Skyrim are too hard. I'm sorry it was problematic and I do agree they shouldn't forcefully put it into a main mission, but I actually cite the fact that there aren't more unique, interesting, out of the box missions like this, as a failing.
---
Check out my post history for an underground bunker in the Mire.  Also, there is a cave system along the highway leafing from watoga to bog town.
---
Only thing that the normal beast drop that are noteworthy are all dense mod plans and a chance at prime receivers. The chances for those are so low I try to just cripple with shotgun and smash their face in on the ground. Any other way is just a waste in my opinion.
---
You can build under the road now, the one north of Watoga.  But yes, more is better
---
It was 1800, right? I remember waiting until the last day of the sale but I couldn't resist it. It was the first (and for a while only) thing I spent my atoms on
---
The new PA recipes are like 5k each. That adds up pretty darn quick.
---
The bog area has some highway with a buildable underground sewage or something. 
---
Im going for a shotgun stealth commando build idk if it will work out 
---
The big bend is a tunnel and unless I've missed something as a pinned location, it wasn't buildable when I tried. 
---
I agree. I'm happy to finally have a great sounding roadmap. I just hope the prestige levels are retroactive. I''m level 176 and really hope to get at least 3 bonuses. 😁
---
The power plants offer a good yield of fusion cores if you don’t mind a defense mission and the possibility of PVP.
---
They’re all 100% too
---
Aww, we know it’s possible, just pass it on.
---
I wasn't greedy or never used bad manners, just asking what's up in an ordinary way to lunch nuke. Nvm so thanks for the information and get some relax tea. You know what I mean, whats the problem? 
---
Yeah and there's some locations like the 2 railroad cars under a power pylon in the NE part of the map you can build on, but more abandoned coal mines or just pits to build in that aren't the cranberry bog cracks.
---
Will look for you! 
---
Any port with a storm I suppose but for flavor I'd love some abandoned mine shaft that's not instanced or even some pits or somesuch.
---
Have special instanced areas for clans. Other games do this. 
---
They need better loot, but they need to be more rare so the better loot isn’t abused.
---
You probably own all the other items on sale already. I saw 4 other than the jacket. It was the camo suit, sugar bombs pip boy paint, mini nuke planter, and something else
---
New generation of kids, Snowflakes. complain about everything
---
I’ve got Bloodied variants of both laser and plasma guns. They work okay. With every damage boost loaded (adrenal, nerd rage, 9/9 Rifleman). Part of the problem is also that armor reduction effects (Anti-Armor legendary, perks, magazine mods) don’t reduce Energy Resistance. It’s a bug, but who knows when it gets fixed. 
---
Also plasma still seems like it has weird VATS accuracy issues. It feels like a 2shot Gun sometimes, even with 95% hit I’m watching 4 shots in a row splash off the wall to the right of an enemy.
---
I would gladly give up my camp and even the ability to fast travel for a mildly customizable off road vehicle/bantam style ''jeep''. Use it as my stash while im at it. 
---
Yes bro, trust in them
---
Because it's the internet, I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or not. Leads melting point isn't so high, it would be quite ridiculously easy, to the point that I think I could actually do it in real life.
---
In warframe they have a clan dojo, I'd love it if you could form a faction and create a bank together and make use like a vault for it, so it would virtually take up to space and wouldn't conflict with camps
---
You're about 2 months 2 late. And no. The quest was bigger for me until I unloaded all non essential holotapes 
---
You are so wrong it hurts bud.  I have a ski sword "skate" mod, requires level 5 perk to ATTACH it, the attach button is there but it does nothing.
---
to tag onto this, maybe remove the perk requirement to apply a mod? Right now the benefit is the lack of resource cost and the plan itself. Maybe make it so that it no longer does a perk check as well?
---
He's wrong, the attach mod option will be there but it will not let you attach it if you do not meet the perk requirements.
---
Cappy, Bottle and Cappy, Nuka World, and Nuka World Geyser are the four I've found. Have you identified a fifth?
---
Yeah my mate suffers from depression at times &amp; I can tell when he is struggling. We have had a Friday night gaming session every week for 15 years and it never fails to drag him out of his funk and back into the world.
---
I think if we didn't have Friday nights he would sink lower and lower and never come back from it.
---
someone says otherwise.
---
I'm aware I'm late, but it's here now for any who needs to know in the future.
---
&gt; You are so wrong it hurts bud. I have a ski sword "skate" mod, requires level 5 perk to ATTACH it, the attach button is there but it does nothing.
---
Oddly enough my Junkie’s Pole Hook does more DPS than my Nocturnal Pole Hook.  Other than those attributes, the weapons are identical.  I always attributed the difference due to “phantom drunkenness” and use it as my primary melee weapon.
---
At least Ultracite afficionados don't look like a swarm of goddamn bumblebees. :)
---
I am sorry I have no lunch code. I do however have a brunch code its MAMOSAS BITCHES!
---
Thanks I had heard melee was meta but I personally don't like it 
---
Unfortunately not, as they are not craftable (no plans) and only obtainable through mods sold by enclave bunker vendor.
---
I bought it when it first came out. Then they put it up again pretty recently I thought. If I’m wrong. Meh. 
---
Yeah I have the same issue here. I've given up on 76 for now for this very reason. I'm a level 95 sniper and I have never found a single TSE, or any exceptionally good legendary. I've completely given up on trying to find these because it turned out to be the only reason I would be playing the game. 
---
I'm not sure how people are able to obtain all of these legendaries, but I'm sure it's not legitimate. 
---
Way too sweet!
---
I have some internet friends from way long ago. Never met, probably never will, but still adore them. 
---
What do you play on? I play on PlayStation and could always use new friends!
---
It would be too much on the servers, this is why there's already a camp limit and why lights take up more, and functioning objects like turrets take up alot. The processing required for those objects is more demanding than just a static item. If many people's camps were just left on the servers, there would be too much to process. Servers would be erratic, with some functioning perfectly fine but others with multiple logged off camps present as well as a full server, would lagged incredibly
---
Players sell serums for 200 caps per all the time.
---
I sz ed up one says vendor Vista, about 1200 caps a nd bought the 6 best ones for me that night.
---
The rest of what your saying is spot on though.  Lots of cheaters, little play value.
---
Games dead man.
---
If vendor can sell mod, I should be able to as well.
---
New stairs??
---
Yeah enjoyed FC5 a great bit. Loved walking around and exploring random places to see what's there.
---
Two first run, thanks man!
---
I have all the mods discovered for the lever action rifle. If you are on the PC, you can add me and I'll mod your gun (in game name is coffeeurn).
---
One thing to note, if you are making rifles and scrapping them, make sure you are making the lower level version as they are cheaper. And run super duper perk of course.
---
I was joking around :)
---
lol I did the complete opposite. I lvled melee as my main and got bored...now I am lvling a sneak sniper
---
Mod for free of course.
---
I have five: Cappy, Bottle and Cappy (red), Bottle and Cappy (orange), Nuka World, and Nuka World Geyser. All are "jacket and jeans."
---
Super dumb question, but can you only have one mod per piece of armor? I thought they stacked and I just wanted a bunch of caps I think...
---
Thank ya :)
---
If I ask for trade im usually just searching for gears/springs/adhesive maybe bullets if low. Wouldn't bother asking for one of their good items lol
---
I want to ride my tamed deathclaw across the wilds
---
So I've got everything except the violet flux. Have to hit some nuke zones.
---
ELI5 to me how this works.
---
I like this route. It was a nice change, a cool little Easter egg hunt. I got 5/8 without hopping at any location. Also went ahead and did the event you mentioned and got another as part of the reward. Thanks a bunch!
---
I just grabbed it from the Atom Store. Unless the in-game model is clean, the store page shows it being dirty.
---
The Hearts of Stone DLC is hands down the most compelling storyline I have ever played in a game.  I just got it this past summer and was completely blown away.  Absolutely a must play for anyone who has played the Witcher.
---
I absolutely agree with that personally. My main takeaway from Jon's video on that was just that going more hardcore on the survival aspects would give the game a more coherent overall feel and force player interaction, but was just one way of doing it. Like, maybe they'd just be better off splitting those who like survival horror systems into a really hardcore experience, and the casual players away from it entirely so we don't feel so much like we're babysitting our characters.
---
But then again, even as someone who generally dislikes hardcore survival elements, forcing people to work in convoys like the video suggested is a little too awesome to not want
---
Many reasons why.
---
First on my list is when you die, drop bag, get disc... Now you'd have a chance to hop around until you got back and got your shit.
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't pop right away, and if I t did, they need to Make it not.
---
Also, farming.  Also, losing a good random, non friend group,   also Nuke zones, etc...
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **1st Cakeday** CertainPassenger! ^(hug)
---
And armor X 01 with installed mods? Or plans are not sold in the bunker?
---
Cool thanks, I'll be moving on then. Again thanks for the help!
---
You are asking for an almost decade old basic mmo feature...we are far away from that
---
I don't think it is.  The underground cave runs north/south from bogtown and is directly under the highway.
---
This is the thing i do, a lot of people come with some materials missing or caps missing and i make deals to them. Add me, if you have the mats and maps and any other stuff that i could be interested in i will make you a deal,
---
Good point...
---
Ok. I'm thinking of big bend off to the west of cranberry bog that links ash heap and the bog. I'll have to check this area out.
---
What if the map starts out normal, but as players nuke it, it becomes a permanent or very long-lasting nuke zone?
---
X01 mod plans doesn’t exist in the game 
---
I enjoyed being a sneak sniper alot, especially with mutations. In Harper's ferry I just run around on the rooftops, silently taking out all the mobs like a secret agent.
---
I like it cause I can help new players or walk to Morgantown/flatwoods/etc to scavenge. Also good spot for water purifiers that I leave unlocked (as well as rest of base, except generator room don't bother breaking in it)
---
It's the ugly looking building 1x4 three floors high. Trying to take up as little room as I can 
---
Sorry, couldn't tell. Hard to read people when you are reading comments.
---
Oh dude... that’d be so fun. I’d only read notes in a team of two or through my rifle scope, lol.
---
The thing is dupers just accelerated the accessibility of these items to players. Even without duping, eventually a player can get an entire set of assassin's sentinel by trading with enough people. Sure the market is flooded, but that's not the real issue here... The power of these items in PvP is the real issue. There are 10 people with full sentinel assassin's, but... Without the dupers it would be one person. That's still one person that can just stand there and be invulnerable. 9 of them would have full sentinel or assassin's. Having legendary effects that over perform in PvP the way that everything does in PvP is the real issue. 
---
Yea had played since I think 2 but new eden is real fun it’s a nice breach game
---
I think you’re right on both. I only dump off at Flatwoods if I’m going to be playing at least another hour.
---
I don't have an as endearing thing to say as much as some of the others here, and I haven't used the power armor services, but baronstein was a huge help in getting the mutations I wanted. I spent at least 3 hours and hundreds of radaway trying to get rid of a mutation but ended up getting rid of two others that were crucial to the build i was going for. Baronstein sold me the serums and saved me so much time, and made it so my friends didn't even have to go through the suffering of that process
---
Lol u kno how ppl are
---
25K? Man, I haven't even had 2K yet.
---
Hopefully having player run vendor stations eliminate some of the problem as they'll see an inventory apart from what you run.... but I imagine someone salty who doesn't care about a bounty will just wreck everything at the shop or even just bring it to one shot range of destruction.
---
Heck id be content if i could combine weapons for condition. I know all of the extra parts can make it an issue.... but 2 hunting rifles would share parts to improve one. Even if you could only repair it to 75% to account for '' common wear'' parts being unable to be replaced from a used firearm. 
---
Weapon repair kits for the rest of the way 
---
How the hell are you a gunslinger without Gun-Fu and Concentrated Fire? Also, I would call VATS very important for a (pistol) gunslinger build- you’re going to need the extra damage from aimed headshots and crits, since pistols are very underpowered otherwise (your big damage guns fire slow and only hold 6 rounds, and don’t have armor reduction perks or  mags, plus aren’t silenced)
---
Well I'd read all the posts about this, and hadn't really run into people exploiting it.  Today I had the misfortune of seeing it live.  Maybe one of my worst in-game experiences in any game.  Queen fight, all of a sudden I'm insta-dead to another player -200 caps.  Auto respawned, again, auto respawned again.  2 players...
---
I must have died 12 times over the course of the fight.  Couldn't do anything about it because they broke my PA in a couple of attacks early on so I was encumbered.  I was stubborn and refused to give up on the Queen kill.
---
Wood armor can drop as a 3 star, i killed some big ass hermit crab dumpster and got a 3 star at like level 10 
---
It's around 3000 caps u might be able to get it for 2500
---
You can get it from the med bay ?
---
You can get a recipe for 3k?
---
I know nothing!
---
Jesus Christ, 900 hours in 100 days??? That's averaging 9 hours a day. You played this game like its a full time job? Are you on disability or something? What's the backstory? Even I cant manage that over two years for a game I love.
---
Honestly scared at how many hours you'll rack up in Warframe... it's just excessively scary you can mange that. Warframe is my favourite game of all time and it's extremely grindy. I honestly and legitimately believe you are actually going to have a heart attack from the hours you pull. There's no way you have a full time job playing like this.
---
P.S still hope they un-ban you for what it's worth, whether or not it's detrimental to your health. 
---
I find it fun, the game before - Fallout 4 - was much better so expectations were high. If you’re soloing I’d suggest getting a copy of Fallout 4. If you want to play with friends then ‘76. But if you’ve never done FO4 and you’re enjoying soloing 76, you’ll love soloing FO4. The storylines and npc’s make it very fun.
---
No i think thats just the serums istelf im looking for the crafting recipe 
---
Coder of Nukacrypt here , most of the players we solved the codes with got suspended or banned. Some have also stopped playing until more content comes out for FO76. 
---
In the meantime Ive been working on making the codes crowd sourcable using Nukacrypt, just not ready for live yet. 
---
More often than not codes will likely be solved on wednesdays now when the fitst letter shows up on the board.
---
I'm still new to some stuff to 76 so I didn't realize all this yet.
---
Been there for a month, haven’t had anyone shoot it up. If it was on the golf course, it would be gone. My biggest threats are the horde of Super Mutants or the Scorch Beasts that spawn near it. 
---
I've never understood the whole "Bethesda handled it poorly and weren't there". Did we watch the same release? Yes, there have been some mistakes in patches, but overall they've all improved the game in one way or another, and they've been very involved in the game since the start.
---
It's because there's a smaller pool of mods to pull from, also I found that your I intelligence score and relevant perks help increase the odds, as well as the scrapper perk.
---
i read this with juice voice
---
You do a lot of complaining but, unless I missed it, not a lot in terms of offering solutions.
---
What would you propose as a workable solution? How would the playing field be evened in a fair manner that doesn't punish other legitimate players?
---
Trading items for items is currently bullshit because you have to trust the other person.  Even if they don't let us trade items for items with vendors it should be supported in the player trading interface.  
---
Dinner you hear?  They had to take a break - fast!
---
Highly doubt that. 
---
Bravo Charlie, bravo.
---
Do you remember the player gt if on Xbox, I was at the golf course and was just getting a little xp and two players, one supposedly being a girl which had no armor, and the other in x-01 armor, decided to join in, and then kill me and take all my loot. I obviously retaliate and then I’m being blamed for attacking the girl first and they have video and that I suck and all the usual. 
---
The song order is definately badly randomised but according to the wiki the songs I mentioned are gone. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_soundtrack
---
Agree. This is the safest (relatively) and most reliable way. 
---
I dont own any of them and I only saw the sugar bombs pip boy paint and the rock out pose 
---
No such thing - kinda like cats, or 4-14 year olds
---
The raiders that you meet in the pit during FO3 weren't there that long. At one point before we visit it, the Brotherhood of Steel came through and 'cleansed' the city before moving on to the Capital Wasteland.
---
I was able to get the sword without any difficulty. Must have been a day of rest for the WS baddies.  There’s also a female body in the basement of one of the houses north of Riverside Manor that will start that quest as well FYI :).  Oh I still have Rose’s quest open too lol.  She asks for a lot. 
---
I love the people that want to “trade” by basically trying to get your best gear.  I had one guy demand one of my TSEs and I told him to back off or he would eat lead.  Well, he starts shooting so he ate some lead. 
---
Act normal and be reasonable instead of a jag off and usually good things will happen. 
---
I did notice they often went silent for a while, presumably trying to sync up with the rest of the server. Shame they got pulled completely as I'd happily deal with some light glitchiness than not have them at all. 
---
Highly recommend this. I usually pick some up while I'm out and about, but if I've taken this power plant before and 100% power cores are nice because you're not wasting space on partially filled cores.
---
Don't bother nuking the Welch area. Spawns aren't good and not a single legendary.
---
nothing related but i want to camp in that junkyard near those bunker domes lol, there is already workbench and everything but it's not a camp neither a camp zone xd
---
I’d reply “ban this” MIRV up the ass 
---
So can you link me to something where it was advertised as a glass bottle in the nuka shape?
---
Otherwise, Oxhorn just assumed, and was wrong. 
---
The good ones are really hard to find, even if you farm the good spots and events. I'm level 77 and I have got one AA drop. One star, but it's a lever action. I still haven't got an explosive gun. I found a crappy one at a vendor after a nuke. AA with a sniper build is popular now. Bloodied legendarys will be good again once the mutation issue is fixed. 
---
I understand what you're saying, I know the way they process things is through area loads. But I imagine they have a limit on how much they can have within an area, this is why (although they made the excuse that it could affect people completing quests) you cannot build in named locations, and this is why you find camps next to the golf shop cause lag, because there's already a limit to that area. I understand what you're saying but it also doesn't make sense, the way you say it is like, if somebody doesn't see it, it doesn't exists, but it still needs to be tracked, so when people look, it is there, which causes more processing on the server, rather than lag on the individual viewing. There have been balances put in place to what should keep everything level, and even with caps you'll find its often too much on the server. If camp objects didn't make effect on the servers, the budget would've been boosted as its quite easy to implement, and 1 of the highest asked quality of life features to be requested.
---
And lights are not just static objects, the lighting physics required for each individual light demands processing, hence why they take more camp budget than a static item. And also why if you do a fallout 4 settlement build and use alot of lights it begins to lag.
---
I'm gonna give you a pvper's perspective on this, so don't take it as me starting an argument or telling you to play another game.  If you have a kind of scattered build (not specifically one damage type) you're going to lose in pvp.  A lot.  Level is kind of irrelevant after 60 or so, as it let's you have all the special stat bonuses and perks for your build.  Don't feel bad if a level 50 one shots you, he's built for pvp.  Perks like blocker, fireproof, serendipity, and dodgy can negate damage entirely.  I get accused of using sentinel/assassins all the time after a fight, and my gear is all mishmashed 2 stars with one piece actually assassin.  If you think someone is using full sentinels, invest in hallucigen gas grenades, bleeds, and pumpkin grenades.  Bleed them out while they sit still.  A gamma gun is the easiest way to take them down with 0 perk investment.  Alternatively you could use perks that add stagger, as a stagger removes the sentinel effect.  As far as TSE goes, fireproof perk and dense/padded armor mods can reduce the damage dramatically.  Bloodied melee builds do stupid damage, but are essentially made of paper mache, so pop a stealthboy and swing away.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Hey so uh I can get up to 5-6 cores in Watoga in a matter of 5-10 minutes and possibly even pick up a handful of legendaries while I'm at it.
---
So you're going to go on a grand tour of Watoga from top to bottom picking off legendary protectrons as you come across them. Usually there's one or two but you can find 4 or 5 (or more sometimes). Also it's quite important to have finished mayor for a day so all the robots aren't aggro'd on you all the time.
---
Start at Watoga station. Head up the stairway behind the high school. Up top there's a good chance for power armor just around the right corner. Head down towards Phoenix (there's a magazine on the roof by the gnome btw). Book down to the Super Duper Mart, checking if the alleyway protectrons are legendary (usu one is. Also there's usu a bobblehead in the comic book shop).
---
From the SD Mart, book west toward the crashed vertibird where there should be another PA set by the heli. Head down to the Medical Building and go inside. Inside there's a chance at another legendary roaming around the hospital. Make your way to the roof and there's another PA set.
---
Make your way back down to road level and head inside the transit center. In a level 3 locked room there's a chance at another PA set, a fusion generator and a bobblehead. From here head back south toward the station but by the welcome to Watoga sign head up to the top of that building. Once you get up top, head north through the plaza and the stopped train. You should see a crashed vertibird on a roof in the middle distance. Make your way there and by that bird some be one more set of PA armor.
---
Takes 5, maybe 10 minutes on a good day and a good chance to pick up 5-6 fusion cores and a handful of legendary weapons and armor to boot and minimal risk if you don't have to worry about an army of aggro'd protectrons lasering your ass.

Nice banter.  Enjoy ban hammer?  What a tool!! 
---
For real I can build a Lazer gun out of forks and cans but I can't repair a bike haha
---
I'm always in pacifist Mode, and there are exploits around some of safeguards, Reactive plates is the known and easily replicatable example.
---
I mean battle Royale  is the worst case scenario for me.
---
Oh god, persistent turret bases around white springs or watoga??  :p
---
I can understand armor needing more attention more often than guns. Armor is taking a beating from bullets, energy, and melee attacks. But guns should not need a complete repair after a thousand, or even a couple thousand rounds. I think I'd much rather see armor repair kits, and then guns degrading at a fraction of the rate they do. 
---
The art on the cake looks amazing
---
before the ban wave i went to the queen really fast and she was already dead lol (i'm melee and nearby so i went straight to fissure prime). I was waiting for her to land but what it landed was her deadbody lmao tsg 2stronk 
---
Good to see some people enjoying the game
---
Thanks for sharing as well. I used to farm the PA spawns in Watoga as well, but as of late I would normally find the PA frames to be picked clean already as it’s a popular route.
---
This is just an alternative, no reason people can’t do both 😊
---
True, also a good option if you don’t mind spending the time to complete the events. 
---
Thank you! 
---
You’re welcome!

You can aggro whitesprings and loot the sentrybots, if you don’t mind having to relog  when you’re done ;)
---
To be fair, some of us paid quite a bit for a finished product. That said, Bethesda has made strides in correcting the issues. Did they trip and fall a few times? Yes. Do they still have a ways to go? Yes. However, they've demonstrated they're trying. The roadmap and the rest of year will be the true testament to their ability.
---
I agree, this is a great game regardless of what anyone says. There's adventure at every turn and the "oh shit" moments I still have when a Deathclaw pops up or turns a corner are still entertaining. I can't wait to see how the game will grow and change with all the new additions on the roadmap.
---
Make vendor prices more reasonable, allow the crafting for legendary items at higher levels, say 50 or above, and tiered...at level 50 you can make 1 star items, level 75, 2 star, and level 100, 3 star. Tie the plans (permanent) to atoms, as you can acquire atoms without spending any money, and I'd rather spend atoms on that than stuff for my camp.
---
There are a ton of other ways, but something needs to be done.
---
That’s fair. But if I’m looking to collect a set of PA recipes. I’m gonna spend my 5k as soon as I have it available to be spent. Not certain I would have the patience to save up to 25k to buy multiple at once. Mutation recipes are pretty crazy though. I’m not a big trader in game, so maybe I just don’t understand caps on a bigger scale.
---
Dumb question but... do you have to build a generator to make the cores? I just did the Thunder Mountain plant and couldn't find anything and wasn't sure how the core generator thing worked.
---
I doubt it’ll be FO3. Todd has said that he doesn’t like remasters. I know, I know, Todd doesn’t decide the entire company. But why would Bethesda remake either 3 or New Vegas when mod teams are already doing it for them, for free? 
---
I honestly viewed Fallout as more of a co-op than a PVP game. PVP could be fun, but let's face it, travelling in a post apocalyptic world is much better with friends. 😜
---
Huh.  My ultracite laser rifle (TSE) creams things, but breaks in like 5 minutes of use.  Odd that we have so different experiences.  Although admittedly my tactic is hair trigger + beam splitter and spam the button super fast.  Everything just kind of explodes.
---
At the train yard building there's also another generator outside on the northern wall, and another up the hill near the shack with the conveyor belt. I'm usually not lucky enough to get them all. Most times when I get there they've all been grabbed, but most times get at least 2 from that run.
---
And when it does.. it’s Bethesda’s fault..lolz
---
Whilst being chased by a deathclaw.
---
I’d pay good caps to watch that!
---
What platform are you on? I can do it for the caps...don’t want all of the serums though. 
---
I missed the part where you tell one of them he's got a pretty mouth...
---
Great guy! Several weeks back needed calibrated shocks for my t51b and I found Lordbaronstein. Even gave me a deal on nuke cola paint job. Real fair prices and hope to be back soon for more power armor services! P.s love your workshop 
---
I use a lot of combat and marine armor. I 
---
One of the parts that kinda grinded my gears was people complaining about lack of end game content when they literally put in a full time job's worth of hours in the first month (4 weeks @ 40 hrs).  I took off a week of work when it came out and was flabbergasted at the content complaints.  The bugs and clear lack of balancing beforehand, sure. But shit, I still have locations on my map I haven't explored yet and you are pissed you did it as fast as you possibly could?
---
It's a lot of fun! I started with a sniper and run around popping the heads off the mobs. I have a second build that's specializing in shotguns. Soon, I'll create one specifically for melee.
---
Once I get high enough, I think I'll start picking up laser weapon perks for my sniper. I hear the rifle perks work on laser rifles as well.
---
I had a good 2000 saved up and then I started taking pictures so I blew almost all of it on poses.
---
Started saving them up but I ended up buying 10 bucks worth to use towards the Mothman PA skin, it’s no Blackbird but it’s pretty cool and comes with red flashlights 
---
If they remaster 3 or NV it will be to push in the "creation club". well that and bumping the price back to $60.
---
Awesome, thanks for this. Can’t believe I didn’t find those already! 
---
Ps4 im at work now when is a good time for you tomorrow 
---
Hmmm, I imagine a shotgun build would be incredibly fun. 
---
Oof, no can do, dudebro. I’m on PC. 
---
Bunch of new game modes in the DLC roadmap, maybe we’ll get lucky
---
y'all have space for another friend? no one i know is interested in this game.
---
Highly recommend you hack the terminals *and* turn off targeting restrictions. By turning off targeting restrictions, you can have the turrets kill most of the mobs for you. Once you hear the turrets die down, you can turn off the turrets and clean up the few that remain. Makes it a lot easier. Also, make sure you're weapons are fully repaired prior to entering with plenty of ammo. I had forgotten to repair once and there's nothing more frustrating than having your rifle break when you're half way through a silo.
---
Thanks!
---
Make sense
---
I've had the rubber band effect as well. Only inside of Whitesprings Resort. It is so damn annoying to encounter these PvP players. 
---
If you play on PC we should be friends. My 2nd character is a "Vault-Tec Raider" looking for more Raider friends not into PvP. Im also one of the very active players.
---
40 caps is a lot. It helps if you set up your camp far from Vault 76, like between Watoga and Harpers Ferry. That way you can farm vendors cheapest and generally move around using camp and Vault 76 as shortcuts.
---
Unfortunately I think this would require persistent servers of some kind, to prevent the messiness of teammates logging in/out. If Nuclear Winter doesn't implement such a thing then the we likely won't see team settlements until private servers launch. At that point you should theoretically be able to ignore the budget caps and placement restrictions altogether.
---
JW who is still playing this game and why?
---
You can easily get 1200c a day minus the traveling cost. In 10-15 minutes game play. So just trade your way to better gear. And we are getting a legendary trader in few months. The already fixed the duplicate exploits. And they're probably going to release 4-5 stars legendary so all duped legendary will be inferior. And the OP legendary effect on armor will be nerfed just wait for pvp server release and the crayin start.
---
Upvoting your post.
---
You didn’t initiate the fight. But you ended it.
---
Some puke decides to grief you,  when his trade didn’t go his way. And you responded, in kind.
---
Regardless, He seemed much more mature about the getting his butt beat, then the raider fans trolling your post.
---
Happy hunting.
---
I'll add you next time I'm on.
---
Happens to me on pc. I gotta completely close out and relogin 
---
Eastern. I can get on 730-10am and 5-9pm.
---
Anybody up for giant sandworm?
---
Shotgun is a lot of fun once you start getting the damage perk cards. My shotgunner is around level 30 and I've been able to take out level 50 mobs without dying. I don't have very strong armor and I survived so they're pretty powerful. Getting swarmed at low levels is still a concern as they can take you down pretty quickly so some strategy is required for groups. I still carry a rifle to cull the herd before they reach me for this reason. Once I get some good armor, I don't think I'll have to worry about it though. Shotgun ammo is pretty easy to find. Crafting it is a little more expensive than ballistic rifle ammo though because you need plastic in addition to lead and steel. You can improve crafting quantity with the Ammosmith perk though. Overall, pretty fun to go running at mobs and blasting them in the face.
---
Very good point. Unfortunately, you can't trust everyone in the Wasteland. There are Raiders out there after all. 👍
---
i only have the vampire left on the cultist .... so what type of stuff are you offering?
---
I would love some kind of settlement building you could do with a faction or something. Maybe cities reset every month or something? Nukes or wildlife could help explain why the cities keep being rebuilt
---
To answer number one, it’s April...9th I think? Something like that. Beyond that, I’m with you I’m hoping that I can place stuff down without having to practically get rid of my entire second floor. 
---
Buy the fusion generator plans for 250 caps. Claim the workshop and throw down the fusion generator = no need to power up the plant. 
---
any time I hear a gamer say "completely broken," I zone out because 9 times out of 10 its worthless hyperbole.
---
I agree with my fellow gingr. Weapons shouldn’t degrade as fast, and I’m always surprised by how little my excavator pa needs repairs after a scorchbeast, deathclaw and wendigo have been hammering on it. I would gladly fix my armor more and my guns less. Guns never wear out that fast in real life. I also think craftable repair kits that weigh maybe a pound or two would be a great way to mitigate the wear and tear out in the field when there’s no quick access to crafting stations. 
---
You can either go through the "Power up" event, or you can throw down a fusion generator and use it to power the core machine. The plans for the generator can be earned by doing the Power Up event or you can buy them for 250 caps in Grafton Rail Road station or a few other responder places. 
---
Don't forget the red rocket east of battle bot ... 
---
Ah really??? Wow. Must try this. Thanks! 
---
Do you have the Woodchuck perk? It helps so much with gathering wood. I'm on PC if you want some help. Just DM me your IGN.
---
Msgypsykitty
---
There's a weapon repair bench in the shed just west of Drop Site v9, btw. Honestly not sure how you break that many weapons in a queen fight unless you're an energy-weapons fan, but that would be the workaround.
---
OP, I guess the solution is to eliminate PVP.  
---
The fusion core generator (manufacturer?) needs 100 power to run. You can get this by either powering up the attached nuclear power plant, or by building a fusion generator from the workshop and powering the core generator. Equip the perk that makes building camp items cost less so it doesn't suck up too many of your own materials. Workshops typically don't have 100% of the materials needed to build one, especially nuclear material. Every now and then you'll find a power plant workshop where someone has just recently left the server and abandoned it and you can claim it without having to build the generator, or the workshop has accumulated enough junk that it doesn't cost you anything to build the generator. I find this happens more often at Poseidon than the others.
---
Or there's the even rarer case where someone hasn't locked the core generator and you can just snatch their cores, but I would never do that.
---
Make it also not possible to server hop after you steal from peoples bag so you can get back at them before they reach a box without getting a penalty within a certain time of them stealing 
---
The reason you can't build in named locations is to prevent path blocking and nothing more.   
---
So Bethesda can milk the games for more money?
---
I've never had anyone jump into the silo with me, but I'd be more than happy to help someone (Xbox). If ur fortunate to have set up a good build and get good r and d for good weapons for ur build you can do it solo, it's still tough especially after the last patch.
---
For context, I have a pair of TSEs I use. Probably assumed I'm a duper.
---
I almost felt bad 'til I got the messages. That just made it hilarious.
---
Yup, the core machine pops out a brand new one every 7.5 minutes. Also, do yourself a favor: Invest the points in Power User, Batteries Included, and Full Charge. I pretty much live in my power armor. Don't even carry normal armor to allow more carry weight. Now if I could just server hop my way into a set of Calibrated Shocks for my X01...
---
My camp is in artillery range of the back door.  3 artillery placements fire for quite some time. 
---
And I just realized I might not have actually answered your question. Then thing that makes the fusion cores, the fusion core generator, is already built and attached to each power plant. It just needs power to start making them.
---
I'd love to help mate, but I found mine as a mod out in the wild. I have yet to unlock this myself as I found a +50% limb damage legendary lever action but it doesn't have a silencer yet. As the others have noted, you'll have to scrap enough to unlock it.
---
//Now if I could just server hop my way into a set of Calibrated Shocks for my X01...
---
You and me both...  😐
---
Unless I'm mistaken, this location will block the spawn of the rare responder vendor...
---
And so they aren't as annoying. I had built up quite the stack of treasure maps. So I went digging. Between clearing out my collection of Cranberry Bog, Mire, and Savage Divide maps, I must have gotten jumped by 10 of the damned things. 
---
You guys are the most circle jerking motherfuckers I ever seen. Jesus Christ.
---
is it two shot and weight reduced ? if so i’d buy it off you 
---
What's your psn?
---
The reason why crafting causes problems, is because it updates everyone's game on the server at the same time. Crafting a single item/group etc. sends an update to everyone. It propagates, and if multiple people are crafting on an already taxed server, it starts to queue, causing more delays for server processing. That's why the slider would help. Plus it would be easier to identify people trying to crash the server, as they crafted 300 boards one at a time, rather than someone moving the slider to create a board x 300. 
---
If they weren't running at full health the whole time I'd agree with some of what you said, but a few of the perks, armor and weapons, you mentioned are dependent on having low health.
---
I have a 1 star anti armor shotgun. My offensive build is built around melee and shotgun damage and have flipped to either or when testing.
---
Defensively, my armor is a mishmash also, but usually run with blocker and fireproof in PVP along with ironclad among others.
---
It's not the level 50s that are one shotting me, it's people that are my level or above. I've had three or four different people one-hit me with a hatchet or axe, while being just below full health. I get that 60 and above doesn't change your character much, but it does give you access to more perk cards to move around. Special points are a different matter.
---
Are there players that are legitimate great gamers and can just kick ass? Absolutely yes, yet the numbers of players that I've seen that are almost virtually invulnerable AND can one shot almost any other player puts a serious bell curve on the chances that people don't have duped items.
---
You are more than welcome to join me my server hopping journeys and witness it. I've gone as far as record more than one instance of this happening.
---
Truthfully,a level 80 Scorchbeast needs to drop something more valuable than level 50 armor or weapon. Also there should be a legendary system in place for them. 
---
I mean I get your point about PvP being broken because of the strength of some of these weapons and gear, but otherwise I’d advise you to look up different builds and ways to get caps fast. Kill super mutants they usually drop caps, participate in events they usually give you legendary gear. I’ve had multiple TSE and assasins sentinel drop for me but that’s just RNG and playtime I guess. 
---
If you’re on XB1 I can probably hook you up with a TSE and some good gear, just keep in mind there are different playstyles. Some people want to be able to 1 shot creatures and some people want to be able to 1 shot players, and if you fall somewhere in between you’ll never be as strong as either. Hopefully I don’t come off as condescending but it seems like you just need to put a little more research into perk cards and maybe trade more if you want to have a viable pvp build. Just my .02
---
Are...are you from Pittsburgh?!
---
Let’s get this guy down to -76
---
Any word on  Bethesda giving us a "Lock" feature like in ESO, so we don't accidentally scrap or sell an item we want to keep? 
---
LvL 42. I fought and defeated my first one about two nights ago by myself. The fight literally took me like half an hour. It was a fun fight and I was happy I had survived, but the loot was kind of underwhelming unfortunately. I think I ended up with a couple pieces of junk and some meat. Nothing special.  :/
---
It’s not that’s my dilemma. K eep A weight reduced launcher or TS?
---
“That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die”
---
I get it.  I was frustrated too.  Then I put my nose to the grindstone and found out how to get around TSE (pre-nerf) sentinels/assassins, etc.  If they're running at full health it could be Cavaliers pieces in combination with serendipity and dodgy.  If they're one shotting you at full health they might be using +% power attack legendaries.  These are stupid strong for full health builds.
---
Biggest tip I can give is to get a cryolater.  It staggers, debuffs, and slows them for a few seconds.  It's a hard counter to every melee build.
---
Omw
---
well i’d rather have weight reduced, especially on a heavy weapon, i’d keep both just because i love the explosive weapons but it’s up to you 
---
Yea that’s what I’m leaning towards
---
Not looking for a new PVP build until they come out with the new PVP option. It's just annoying when a few of them just follow you around hitting you till you respond.
---
Ya i'm playing X-Box, I wasn't doing half bad till dude showed up and more and more bots kept coming I understand they don't start but hell not the number I had seen before him showing up and the confusion of him or me trying to finish it didn't help. He would get to a console and start working it then back out and attack bots while I was watching his back thinking hell I need to learn it, even if I don't get it all back him up so I can learn but then he left me a couple times and hid for me to deal with the wave's I thought WTF man. I was super surprised when I heard the voice then I was like FKT my life bot's up the ass!!! Oh well re group get more aid and ammo roll back in. Just curious if this has happened to anyone else or what to do? All most backed out just to keep the junk but I was in too deep. Better to get one nuke off either of us than neither of of us I thought? 
---
I've gotten into the habit of unloading every possibility to my stash for ass-hat attacks or just bad luck or crazy stuff that just happens.  Lost a bunch of lead once on a run becuase I forgot to unload and SBQ event happened so I rushed over,  died and never found the bag again in the chaos. I'm convinced the bags drop out of world sometimes....
---
Was it? I was just going by the esm, this is the only cosmetic I saw change since last patch.
---
I got disconnected and lost all the stuff I collected from a nuke zone. Was on the way back to CAMP to craft for my Armor mods. Got killed by 2 scortchbeasts. As if that wasn't bad enough the All Rise legendary Super Sledge I purchased the day before at Watoga also disappeared. Disappearing Legandary items is one of the worst bugs in the game and Bethesda does nothing to resolve it.
---
Picked up the Xbox one x bundle as well with the game last week. Played maybe an hour or two, pc is far superior. No stutter on my end. I’m only at 1080p but those 60 FPS make a difference. 
---
If you can show me how to get 1200 caps in 15 minutes I'm all ears. If you're talking about selling legendaries or serums, you need those things to start out with to sell them, otherwise I have no idea how you are making caps like that.
---
What’s your GT btw, I approved a few yesterday but some were for traders 
---
There is a "hardened receiver" for the SMG, but it's not a scrap mod. You'd need to find it at a vendor or as a world spawn.
---

XGAY1
---
Yeah, I don't think you played FO3 or 4.
---
Derp fuck derp 
---
Sir how dare you call The Campenstein as “workshop” ? :)
---
Assuming he farmed it all himself.. can you link the math btw, the way I calculated it was ~5 flux per hour, not that hard. Plus he was in a role playing community where they had him craft most of the ammo but I guess it’s pretty convenient to leave out the trading aspect of the game...
---
I'm glad you get to enjoy either way. I must just have had bad luck with the game no PC.
---
Would you want to play sometime looking to get back into it again? What lvl are ya?
---
If they take the lazy way, they my let you "display" items from your stash. so it would count towards your stash but not to your budget.
---
What system are you on?
---
He had over 300k ultrice ammo but i wish i could find the post yong actually mentions it in his video that people did the math 
---
Weird. I don't see why they would do that, but maybe it's a random selection for each person
---
Did you drop the nuke?
---
My point is that the chances of one person find a full set of Assassins or Sentinel, along with a TSE shotgun and having enough caps to buy a marsupial plan are astronomical, especially if they are around my level. You wouldn't have many God like players at all, and that would be ok as well. Maybe the 900 hours guy might have had the time in the game to be awarded that much stuff, but not very many others.
---
All dupers did was help their friends and break the trading system.
---
Yeah but that’s just part of an online game unfortunately. If your complaint is about griefing then I’m with you 100% but it seemed like you were more perturbed by the balancing issues. I hate to say it but if you want to engage in PvP then you need to do research on builds and whatnot. I’d recommend piecing together some bolstering and vanguard armor until you can find the god tier set you want. 
---
I’ve seen that during a sbq fight ...  things a nuisance .  
---
Maybe make use of the paint cans 
---
Aiming with a mouse is significantly easier than aiming with a joystick so I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re landing a significantly higher percentage of shots.
---
Inb4 Bethesda nerfs PC versions with increased recoil and bullet spread.
---
Not yet 70 percent 
---
Darkdestory23 
---
The last 3 queen fights for me they have all fled between 2 and 5 minutes into the fight. 
---
Yeah I mean people keep saying others did the math but I can never find it lol, do you discount the idea of trading for those materials? I bought 400 flux and 5k steel and lead today for 8k caps. I’m js that there’s many ways to skin a cat and yet everyone just wants to make it an all or nothing scenario, ie. he had to farm all those mats himself/no one trades on the game. 
---
so......what is the longest play session you have had?  mine is a 32hr session.  with breaks of course.
---
Server hopping wasn’t removed...
---
Items just won’t spawn for you repeatedly if you pick them up even if you get a new server.  Gotta wait.  If items reappear, it’s because they spawned for another player.  
---
Honestly. I was playing earlier with a friend, we ran into two level 60s, im 100, he's like 58 Or so, they shoot. We shoot back, thinking we can kill them. I end up getting killed, so I tried hitting a sneaking crit with a black powder rifle. I did legit no damage, he ended up killing me, over and over. I hadn't even pressed seek revenge. But I couldn't see them on the map, and they were still killing me. I fast traveled away, they ended up following me, not sure HOW they fast traveled to MY camp. In the middle of nowhere. They aren't on my friends list. But they could still TP to me. I lost about 600 caps, going from 1,400 to 800 or so. I closed the game, raged, and went to siege. I'm tired of this games crap. 
---
I'd be happy with just a mirror so I can check myself as I go out the door when I leave camp.
---
If you power up Poseidon 3 (?) times you get the plans for free. But then again, you have to do it a few times. But it really only takes about 10 minutes per power-up.
---
This was a wonderful read. Thanks for sharing it.
---
Xbox has apparently made moves to allow Xbox one games to be played on PC with the new april release of windows 10 so I have my fingers crossed for that one.
---
No they changed it so if you took it it wont respawn until 24 hours or something like that
---
For armor, there’s a lot of primaries people like, but highest value ones will be things like Vanguard’s, Assassin’s, Unyielding. If you have a Chameleon piece with great 2nd and 3rd stars(thinks like AP refresh, rad resist, maybe poison resist as secondaries; weight reductions, stealthy, maybe acrobats as tertiary), that also has quite a bit of value, as lots of people like to have 1 chameleon piece. Weightless has some specialist use, often for stealthy builds, or sometimes people who are almost always in power armor who want weightless+cha/int pieces to wear under their armor but boost them when they hop out to craft or sell. 
---
If you find Assassin’s (-8% player damage) primary with -15% damage while still / -15% damage while sprinting tertiary, those are gold for PVPers. 
---
That was prob the catalyst for the post, but not the true point. 
---
Also he claims he never had that much ammo and that the system registered him dropping picking the ammo up on his alt character. Tough to say if that’s the case due to lack of response from Bethesda. Anyways it’s my personal opinion that 100k “rare” cut off limit shouldn’t apply to ultracite ammo because it’s not that rare.
---
There are build guides all over the place. If you plan your build around a certain weapon really well and dump everything else into defense then you're going to do crazy damage. 
---
With my personal build I have solo'd the SBQ in a rad suit
---
I think he said he didn't trade for the mats i should have commented on it to save it but i didn't think about it and his excuse was that he traded with his mule nothing about trading or crafting the ammo he ssid he just traded it a bunch 
---
I love the idea, but yes would be very hard to implement. 
---
I play with a few guys and our camps are close together, some in visible distance. But with free fast travel this doesn't really matter much.  
---
Each, actually with couple of paterns to chose and the ability to mix and create new colors, would of been pretty cool.
---
I like this, I like this a lot. No more over encumbered at the end of a junk run
---
Me and a couple freind have this going actually we have about 6 of us relatively close to eachother all by the stream close to harpers fary the only problem i have is is im not the first one logged in my house wont load  but it never gives them any problems to join  me. 
---
So you’re just mad about duper’s basically? Sorry if I’m missing the point here. 
---
It was one of the items duped so it's on a watch list
---
If you could hear my mic when it happened, you'd also get a nice "Oh Goddamnit" to go along with it. 
---
Now that I think about it, it does really seem exactly like what JuiceHead would say.
---
PVP has a ton of issues due to a variety of reasons, and to make this game more enjoyable, those problems need to be fixed in the regular game, not just the upcoming PVP update, is my point. Its generalized and has been said before, but after several months, Bethesda still has not come up with a valid solution to those issues.
---
I have marsupial serum plan and sell the serum for 200 caps though, I got the recipe from the queen. The problems with the trading system are awful, but without dupers the problems only slow down. I've gotten great drops I don't need and have sold them. PvP is ridiculously bad and it's worse because of dupers, but full sets of perfect gear go far beyond any reasonable levels.
---
Well I know the community he played with, it was a role playing community btw where people had certain jobs like ammo crafter and things like that. I know he said he didn’t have that much ammo, trust me I read thru most of the posts about it and have talked to members of his community aswell. My point is that you scoffed at having 300k ultracite ammo, tbh it’s not that hard when you’re the dedicated ammo crafter for your community. 
---
That’s all I’m getting at here, if you want to say his claim about the servers registering him dropping and picking up ammo multiple times is bogus, fine there’s not much evidence because he can’t access his account/doesn’t have screenshots to prove it. But please don’t say it’s impossible to do something that’s not that hard when involved in a community and trading.
---
Not trying to start an argument because I think you just misworded your OP. Just sucks I’ve got a buddy that got banned for having 120k ultracite ammo and Bethesda never warned anybody that would be a bannable offense. I missed the cutoff by 10k ultracite ammo. 
---
I have caps, resources, legendary weapons... Your listing is pretty specific, I have neither of those items. What types of weapons would be reasonable? Melee, ranged, effects etc? What would a cap price be if I have no weapons you like?
---
In addition to your Fallout settings, have you checked your xbox settings?
---
&gt; but I would never do that. 
---
Lol'd so hard.

Nocturnal has a day time debuff that reduces it to 60% damage

My son, Squiggly, saw this new Sour Patch Kids cereal box when I was picking up some frozen pizzas, dogs, and propane from Wal Mart. It seemed like an odd choice for a cereal so, uncertain whether the family would like it, I asked one of the employees whether it’s worth the $5. Randall said it “looked weird” and “he wasn’t sure.” I told my son we would get it another day.
---
Then my son started squealing.
---
SOUR PATCH, SOUR PATCH, I WANT SOUR PATCH!
---
Wifey wants Squiggly to be on a diet (and I didn’t want to get in fight with Wifey), but I also really didn’t want to listen to Squiggly squeal any more so I bought the dang box of cereal.
---
I got home to fire up the dogs on the grill and, before I knew it, Squiggly had busted the box open and started chewing. I heard wifey coming down the steps. That’s when I noticed Squiggly’s tears.
---
I grabbed my son and threw him into the shoe closet before Wifey could make it down the steps.
---
“My tongue hurts,” my son complained as tears streamed down his face, “I don’t like it.” Before I knew it, though, he had reached into the box to eat another handful.
---
“What in tarnation?” I thought. I reached for a handful myself.
---
My mind. Disrupted. Gone. Images of destruction, death, and suffering. Flit, flit, flit. Crunch, crunch, crunch. Pause. More sour death, oh lord. Tears streamed down my face. I wondered if I’d ever be normal again. I held my son tight as we munched and cried.
---
We continued on like this for years, minutes, or seconds until an angel burst through the closet door. I got on my knees and gestured my son to do the same. The angel opened her mouth.
---
“What in the living hell, Petey?” the angel inquired.
---
What? Was hell living? Feeling confused, I grabbed another handful of Sour Patch Kids Cereal.
---
The angel smacked my face. I realized it was Wifey. My tears and altered state had given her a holy aura. In repentance, I offered up a handful of the cereal.
---
“Is that seriously Sour Patch cereal?” Angel Wifey asked, “Gross!” She must’ve been overcome by curiosity, though, because she still tried the handful.
---
There we were, all three of us crying like babies in the shoe closet. It was so sour. It was so cereal. It was so wrong.
---
I’ve spammed a bunch of windmills once and I don’t think it used much personal resource at all. I’ll
---
Have to check again tomorrow but I believe the windmills use pretty common resources that are found in the camps budget
---
You need costumes plan preferably the witch. You get them from the trick or treat and civil war reenactor random encounter. Then craft with super duper and sell with hard bargain in a 7 point *200c round to traders =(1400c). I can show you some easy random encounter spots if you like.
---
Well now we now lol, just wish Bethesda had warned us it was coming because my buddy got banned for having 120k ultracite ammo. He was a legit trader and would accept ultracite ammo and flux as currency because of its value. 
---
He needs a scorch queen to lay down the law of the wild on his vote fixing ass
---
Agreed
---
Well of course Bethesda never warned anyone why would you warn dupers about what i am duping 
---
We all...
---
Kinda sad how they missed the Enclave vendor when they changed the way their stocks work....of course it would've become more expensive but atleast you would know you would find some there...
---
Your truth makes me sad.
---
LOL
---
yeah, just shoot ten round bursts or until you see it proc. Release, then re-engage. You can verify the SBQ's energy resist with awareness in perception
---
Yeah, the queen is dead. 
---
yeah pre-patch she died the second she landed. 
---
Just an FYI, the person who told me it was up twice was ripped apart as a dirty liar (corrected as being mistaken, which is the same thing on the internet). Blackbird has only been up once, and only for a day. Sorry :/ Take solace in the fact that I am as crushed as you.
---
Hey, I'm coming online now. If you can't get on, I'll get you taken care of another time!
---
Or a “what the fucckkk!!!” That scares my gf
---
Tried doing all the fixes mentioned in here but it didn't help :(
---
Wait they removed server hopping? So what happens now?
---
It could work, just shrink the build zones x and y
---
Doubt they ‘missed’ it...
---
Need to still have some grinding for that carrot left in the game ;-)
---
On the PVP server I agree with you in the actual game it’s perfectly fine
---
Way to disregard 90% of what I said but ok, the reason they should warn people is because there was a large trading community in this game and a lot of people traded in ultracite ammo because of its value. Therefore it’s easy to collect that amount in 30 days if you do a fair amount of trading. 
---
They claim they know who does the duping but this ban proved they can’t actually see that so they just included known duped items into a “rare” list. Just seems unfair to me that when you get maxed on caps at 25k you have to start accepting alternative forms of payment. Bethesda never said you weren’t allowed to have more than 100k ultracite so how were people to know until they were banned?
---
Yeah that would be cool.
---
Dude, I was in a weapons workbench in Whitesprings? Do you not know how to read? How can I claim a workshop when I was in Whitesprings? I’ve only ever claimed one and it was when I first started. So no that’s not it. And no I wasn’t wanted. There wasn’t anyone else in there but me. So no way I was wanted. It literally says in the mode that even when you’re on pacifist mode players can still attack you and kill you. That is what happened. That is why I said what I said about changing that. So you can get your narcissistic self out of here. 
---
I enjoy fighting the queen, I know shocker lol. I’ve traded a god roll shiskebab for 70k ultracite ammo so it’s not hard to get if you have what people want js.
---
Got it. if you could test your build when you join a SBQ fight, I’m sure many people including myself would be interested to hear your findings. Several times I tried to test sneak tactic near Glassed cavern area, all failed miserably lol. Even when I was using Stealth Boy and my status was Hidden and I was actually under a tent or behind a structure, a scorchbeast would start screaming at me as soon as it comes into the area. There wasn’t one time that I could sneak attack it so I always end up pulling out heavy weapons to shoot them down 😿
---
I would just trade caps because i think caps are safe i don't think Bethesda figured people were trading ammo for items 
---
I like this idea makes everyone a key player in raids. 
---
Username checks out
---
Very early to mid game I've found that pharma farms perk (in luck) is a great perk to have so you don't Starve for essentials like stimpacks and radaway. Those end up pretty quickly when you're exploring and leveling.
---
You still on?
---
Yeah but it’s late 
---
As far as I know, you can power up any of them 3 times to get the plan. I didn't find that out until I had already bought them :(
---
I'll take this mystery with me to the grave.
---
And I got it done I just need some pews 
---
This is a good suggestion, as in generic repair kits. They should have downsides like being a bit heavy as well as not repairing to full.
---
Point taken, but is it really on the players to police themselves and say “hmm maybe I shouldn’t hoard items in a post apocalyptic survival game in case I get banned”? 
---
It’s my belief they should’ve just deleted the ammo if they really had a problem with it, but obviously they can’t tell who’s duping so they came up with a cutoff that’s very arbitrary. That’s just like my opinion tho man. 
---
Who has 25k?! Im barely scraping by with 100-200 O.o
---
The ad's for it are no longer up since it was a limited time offer. 
---
No I’ve only ever claimed one workshop before and it was when I first started. I don’t bother with those. I was just chillin in Whitesprings what I always do and he just comes up and kills me. That’s it plain and simply. There’s no hidden message, no lies no secrets. 
---
We had repair kits in New Vegas, so it might be a good idea. 
---
EXCATLY!
---
Don't worry, the modding community will make up private servers very soon. They are already a good portion of the way there already. They will be out before the middle of this year.
---
I had a situation once where my friend dropped all of their weapons in my camp for me to mod/fix. Some douche lord came up and literally stole them right out from under my nose. Needless to say, I was pissed the fuck off. More so than my friend was, in fact. There's gotta be a better system to implement that doesn't allow things like that to happen. 
---
Excellent job, sir!
---
I run around in T-51b.  What are your suggestions for locating crafting plans?  Treasure maps?  I only have the ability to make legs from some plan a player at Whitesprings gave me a while back.
---
Is it possible to get plans for X-01 mods, or are they only sold as stand-alone mods at the bunker?
---
I just ending up in the same server, so I'm finding all my usual farming spots for BF are striped and I've no chance to find any, basically a lottery. Skewing the game game mechanics to make it impossible to play parts of the game. 
---
Not sure what they are trying to achieve, I'm just loosing interest to be honest, play less and less now.
---
Agreed, I only go after them for the xp these days. But they drop nothing, maybe a plan every now and then.
---
I've enjoyed my time playing even with the bad reviews , it's not perfect but its steadily getting better .
---
Yeah, it's always best to unload into your stash as often as possible in this game, but sometimes that's not possible. And I've had pretty much that exact situation, only instead of "out of the world" someone saw my stash of ballistic fiber and went "yoink". Because they were a garbage human. 
---
Oh man yes. I've had that happen a few times. Lost a furious combat rifle that way, drove me nuts.
---
Some reasonable cool down time where if you leave the game, all looted items are dropped, maybe. 
---
Still new. Sorry. But where do you go to fight the SBQ? I hear her mentioned frequently. And it sounds like you can fight her more than once. Is she an event? If so, how is the event triggered?
---
Bring back the Fallout 3/NV system where I can use other combat shotguns to repair my current combat shotgun.
---
They brought back weapon condition from Fallout 3/NV, I don't understand why they didn't bring this feature back too.
---
Jelly?
---
Treasure maps and events in Watoga are the only options as far as I know. It’s difficult, I still can’t craft the T60 set and just found the missing piece for t51b earlier today after this post. Trading is another option but they are very very rare 
---
Got a weightless robot right arm with 25% poison resist on xbox
---
A Fire Beetle bites you for 650000 damage.  
---
You are dead.
---
I downed two sbs and the sbq today, no xp and no loot. Was very very very fucking disappointed. 
---
Sometimes the bad things are so stupid they get funny and make the game even more fun. Like we were having trouble with power armor spawning so I took it upon myself to become the body guard of my group! Sometimes when I died my body shot into the air causing for some great game clips! Don’t rush the game either enjoy the ride!
---
Oh, I’m so happy to help you and your friends, it was cool to hang out with you guys. We should get you some jetpacks then real soon. Forget about the caps will find something for you
---
You have to nuke fissure site prime in the cranberry bog. And yes it's an event, I've done it with 10+ people most of the time
---
Grats on the ultracite plans, too!
---
Most of these "easy kills" have being banned and thus not so easy as it's a new character with all the experience 
---
You're welcome. 
---
"There won't be much of a Lovecraftian entity left when I'm finished with my AAE Explosive."
---
"Lick" your wounds! Don't pick your wounds!
---
lesson learned: don't shoot back
---
Some people sell a set of armor all at once and the bidding can go higher than 25k sometimes. 
---
I've been swapping from wandering around with melee weapons into a heavy guns role during SBQ.  That requires me to grab a harpoon gun and 50 cal, plus their respective ammo out of my stash, swap out a whole bunch of perks, and fast travel to the nearest locale not in the blast zone.  Sometimes that's Watoga Station, which can be a bit of a walk while stomping around in power armor.  At least 5 minutes would be great to allow me to finish what I'd doing (sometimes the inability to fast travel while enemies are nearby can take up to a minute to get rid of), get to a stash box and get to the blast just in time to participate from the beginning.
---
Yeah that's what I couldn't find. I did the power up event, then cleared the workshop but couldn't find the generator I guess. Gave up and went to do another event and ended up losing the workshop while I was gone
---
Thats odd, on PC everyone in the server shows up on the recent tab even if you dont see them on the map, and so long as you can remember their gamer tags you can exit the server and block them from the recent tab while on the main menu. 
---
What i really need is vanguard sentinel combat armor (anything but right arm), aae 10 mm
---
 
---
No because we have no idea what the system will be and most items are easily attainable. Will we be able to place wherever we want or will it be a "shelf" that displays set objects? Will CAMP budget even allow anything cool to be done?  Pretty sure I'm not going to be able to recreate my gnome army from F3. 
---
I scrapped a "scrap assaultron head" at the ARMOR STATION and freakin got it. Scrapped so many at not that station and never got it.
---
Lol I’m all for pvp if both people are interested. They were level 94,106 and 196. The 196 left the area after the first death my assumption is they knew what was going on. 
---
Bizarre. I definitely remember hearing it while playing FO76 as it triggered a very specific memory of "oh hey, it's that theme song to 90's sitcom [Out of This World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092423/)." Maybe it lasted for a short period past beta. Or I am simply losing my mind.
---
Worked for me!
---
My old gamertag, which was lost, was KimJongSkillz. Would have been perfect.
---
What system do you play on?
---
I'll trade for your 5.56 if you're on PC
---
This is why I dislike the whole keycard nuke launch bs. I would prefer to just collect all the pieces through the terminal quests. Then deposit them all into a terminal and it dispenses a code. Or even better solves the code and then requires you to deposit a blank key card into the terminal which then gives you an activated key card for that week. Once you do that weeks quest for the code you can activate as many key cards for the silo you solved. 
---
Nice.
---
&gt; recreate my gnome army 
---
And I thought finding the gnome with a shovel standing over a broken one was creepy.
---
seeing a mass of them standing in a dark room.......why would you do that to people?
---
When you get higher level and venture to other areas ,other than the protected ones made for new players, you will see people all the time.  I believe this was intended to let new players get their footing.
---
I have traded with a few player that I have kept them as friends so when I want to server hop, I just join their server/world and then when I'm done, travel to the next friends server. I can get a few good hops that way.
---
ha, I had my entire deck of Megaton lined with every single one I could find. It was fun because they came in different sizes. Of course they were joined by the giant teddy bear. 
---
I would kill for that! Perfect for my non power armor alt. I'm Zulu38. Can give you caps and mats if you want
---
Hi Zulu38, I'm dad!
---
yeah, collecting junk is my vacation now.
---
Awe, the whittle baby wants to launch a nuke.....or was it duece?
---
I can't dupe ( deuce) anymore, give me the codes ( and my participation trophy) now!
---
**If you increase the caps limit, all you do is increase the INFLATION of prices.**
---
If the max you can pay to the vendor is 25k, that's it, no more caps prices higher than that.
---
Now change it to 100k, you'd have to farm the vendors for 83 DAYS to get that amount.
---
Just leave it alone.
---
Whitesprings
---
Very cool
---
You can leave worlds without leaving a party.
---
They could use that and bind that team together until they leave manually.  Whoever logs on first will pick the world with the teams camp and teammates will be paired to that world.
---
Idk! Lol
---
You can solve it without any of the keyword. But it takes about 256 nuclear keycards to do it. Doubt anyone has that many after bethesda removed inventory multiples
---
Or Ganhdi
---
One can spawn at the derailed trains near Top of the World. Usually you'll find two Mr. Gutsies and a Sentry-Bot. Assaultrons might spawn there, too, but I've never encountered one. I'm not great at combat in 76, so I avoid robots when I can, so I know for a fact one can spawn there.
---
One can spawn at the carpark for Wavy Willards Water Park, North of Grafton. The Super-Mansions near the Toxic Valley may have a Sentry spawn in their front yards, and I recall seeing one in Morgantown, near Vault-Tec University. I can't be sure any of these are right, but I hope I helped a little.
---
Participation trophy for you also....?
---
Different person, funny how “I have video” seems to be a new thing possibly. And the gt against me was RicabobShay, I believe it was a couple because I think hers was MsRicabobShay
---
When I encounter a group of 3, at one of them generally drops a SBQ level plan. Typically it's the level 80. Personally I'd love it if they made all lvl 80 SB's have a 50/50 shot at a rare plan, then it they'd be worth it. 
---
Finally put some balls on my pool table
---
Pool balls, hopefully I can find them all.. And the gnomes too
---
Thanks dude
---
Have you tried the end of the bridge east of Harper's ferry? The one where if you go around to the right, it will lead to the ransacked bunker..? Anyhow, if you don't mind the rads and have marsupial, you can not only build inside the tunnel, but you can make it under then over the inside wall for a nice hidey-hole. Alternately, you can go to the top of the cliff above the tunnel nel for a good spot with a dead couple and a dog. Is also a great spot for mining copper, with a tiny cave for mining aluminum on the back side. As a further alternate, you could build under the bridge, lots of water and steps built in to make a multi platform camp 
---
It was that 1 day offer "looking into the future" pose right after the last patch, iirc. 
---
😂 ok buddy ok
---
I know. But I like the visual effect of energy weapons. When I have too many cores and cells, I take them out for a ride.
---
And a blankey....and a unicorn that farts potpourri scent in my camp.
---
Ah, poo, that's what happens when I try and go off memory
---
Dang, you really like hurting other people, don't you?
---
Bravo for whenever we get some letters:
---
Y7
---
H6
---
R7
---
M9
---
P4
---
A9
---
C4
---
O4
---
Both of those are solid ideas
---
Going to have to go find those heads in a jar
---
I don't mind cracking a puzzle.. Hell I like doing that sort of thing.... It's just uh.. Why doesn't this game tell you how to do it?
---
I have not. I like the dead end of Shenandoah St. In harpers but haven't found these spots. Thanks for the tip!
---
Whitespring is great because there's a few of them you can destroy
---
It’s the over-encumbered sound. Your character goes naked when the server goes down/you despawn, so it’s likely that for that split second, it’s registering the lack of stats vs your inventory. (Or something to that effect. People who understand servers, eli5?)
---
If you need cores just take Poseidon, drop a fusion gen and hook it to the FC processor there. Come back every 1/2 hr and grab the 3 in it. Remember to lock it. 
---
Only vanguard I have is 2* Trapper Left Leg (+1 Perception) or 2* Vanguard Trapper Right Leg (+1 Charisma).
---
Yeah. I can build a fusion generator but somehow a simple heat exchanger escapes me.
---
Will keep this in mind.
---
Ask Rodney King how that worked out.
---
No, seriously. Farm the sentry bots at the Whitespring before you log off or server hop after to reset them being hostile. You can get their fusion cores and good xp.
---
What gets me is that I’m pretty sure you can build a broken one for decoration.
---
That sounds too powerful, unless it's limited by like allowing only half of normal amounts. 
---
It should increase carry capasity as well as allow you to sleep and hopefully to cook as well.
---
Ok I couldn’t tell if your joking thx I guess
---
Then try to best place to make your CAMP If you are finished the game you got a lot of CAMP prints. Use them try to make army outpost if you dont like it make water collecters and start farmig  than start making juice or craft thing that giving you 5x adhesive or capture big CAMP and while collecting junks explore world and get ready for roadmap or start farming that shitty legendary items for legendary vendor.Like I said try to craft things you need.And you dont want to do anything I can give you another advice.Stop it dont play the game for 1-2 week or until march update and dont call dumb or insult them because they enjoy this game 
---
Fridges. Nuke cola machines. Food shouldn't last indefinitely. But damn. Can my canned meat stew last long enough so I can use more than 1 or 2?
---
50 going on 17... per wifey.
---
My camp is next to a silo, if you watch the animation it is really clever with the stages and other parts dropping off as the ICBM gets higher.
---
&gt;Just a follow-up. I am not condoning nor making excuses for Bethesda. But you do not know the architecture of the game code nor supporting infrastructure.
---
Actually I do, not only have I made mods previously for the creation engine, and know quite a bit about the multiplayer functions modders made for FO4. Not to mention I know people who are already reverse engineering the server software to create private servers.
---
I'm just letting you know what is going on with the servers between this one and wow servers, not to mention I've run numerous other servers, such everything from Teamspeak 3 and minecraft to private DayZ and WoW servers. There is ZERO excuse for the piss poor performance of this games servers.
---
It's this. I've been in the map/pipboy when it happens and the weight changes mysteriously just before the disconnect.  My assumption is that weight reducing perks suddenly stop working and PA pieces count against weight (the latter of which is probably related to how it saves your inventory to insure the items are there on login if you logout or disconnect while wearing your PA).
---
A third confirmation that you are wrong... You must have the skill to attach a mod. I currently have a extra limb mod for a deathclaw gauntlet I cannot attach because I do not have lvl 3 makeshift warrior. Believe me, I have tried.
---
I'm looking for a unicorn.
---
Ok.  Thanks
---
No problem, if you're on PS4 I can give a brief tour if any trouble finding the place, but it should be pretty easy. Just fast travel to Harper's and do a 180 lol. Don't forget about the rads in the tunnel specifically! Tried to show a low level once and we could talk and he died swiftly.. felt bad man.
---
Question is will they be un equipped as soon as you hop in power armor?
---
Lol.  I know.   I've trained myself not to react.  Haha.   Three punts tonight, I figure the game just didn't want to be played this evening.
---
I have fat stacks of radshield but I'm on PC but I'll explore that way.
---
Exactly! I’m sick of killing harder to find creatures like scorchbeast or hermit crabs and the meat expires before I go back to camp. 
---
I roast everything because it’ll expire before I can get the rest of the ingredients. 
---
Lol
---
Damn that's cool. To think they developed all this knowing that the one who launched the nuke would probably not see it.
---
"They're dropping bombs like it's The Great War!"
---
wonderful shot mate - keep flying the Nuka-Cola flag for us!
---
Awesome!! Love this so much. Hope you’re doing well ( Appalachian life will wait for you!)
---
At least for the most part, all the Legendary items I picked up seconds before stay intact!
---
Don't really bother with the stash box any more, I just find items I need when I need them, with carnivore mutation food is irrelevant and my five water purifiers keeps me hydrated. 
---
I store a little steel, lead and gunpowder for my 5.56.
---
Or do challenges for ATOM daily weekly I dont know I got 3k ATOM and I never look at the challenge tab and I dont know what is there but maybe you can find things at there busy and earning ATOM while playing games and If you dont like anything at ATOM shop wait until update they will add good things to buy 
---
Wow, you used to spam a material hundreds of times a day, by "server hopping"....not playing the game. And now you can't, because the loot respawn is now player based, with a time-out.
---
Guess you have to PLAY (not exploit) the game!
---
Bet you were selling the ballistic material for caps (or cash), weren't ya?
---
you can reduce hw weight with a perk though
---
It popped up in my news feed, not knowing it was for F76 i clicked. I neither follow the game nor the subreddit.
---
Repairing the "commie whacker" requires both red and blue paint cans.  Luckily, Vendor Bot Chad sells them, which is fitting as he's also where the weapon is found.
---
Who repairs a commie whacker?  A bloodied player who enjoys using the bladed variety in PvP. 
---
From now on I'll remember that every time I'll join the game and my camp site will already be taken, but that damn lead extractor won't be locked :D
---
Lol I agree with you but the game is still a mess. 
---
15 min?  Not with stash being shit low still and weight restrictions keeping you walking. 
---
Try 2-3 real hours. A whole play session, which is complete shit design. 
---
And a cookie
---
The question now is....will you get toasted by standing next to the launching missile?
---
Wait? What? Weapon Repair kits entered Fallout in New Vegas. They were largely ignored in 4 because of the new system  (no armor/weapon degradation), and you're telling me that with 76's degradation system, weapon repair kits don't exist? WHAT!? That's absurd!
---
Anyone know where to buy? I've read Responder bots sell them but I haven't had any luck.
---
Can I ride it?
---
I generally only clean out the bags of wanted players I've claimed the bounty on. Remarkable how much stuff some people carry around while wanted.  Even caught one guy in the act of wrecking a camp and got him. He was mere feet from a stash box but was carrying close to 100lb of crap. 
---
I think they will sell them individually for 1000 atoms each like the xmas t-51
---
Lol what is with these low level players praising a game they’ve only just started without dealing with any of the steaming garbage we’ve been dealing with?
---
I just wanted to feel the power between my legs. 
---
Adds realism? I don't think the would be a fire arm manufacturer left in business if they built a gun that broke after a couple hundred (max) rounds. Maybe a hundred thousand or so. 
---
That's bad, but still better than my deathclaw wrecking my generators graphically.
---
What if they added a weapon workbench right near the exit from the launch area to make this easier, maybe a tinker bench too?
---
Yeah? Well your face! And his face too!
---
The nuke looks big, but how come the blast zone is so small?
---
I believe they are buttons that show you exit locations for nuke Silos. This is a one-way elevator exit from the launch center of [Site Charlie](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Site_Charlie) I believe. 
---

How are you people still excited for this game? They hyped it up before release, bombed, then made a bunch of promises. I permanently stopped playing this after one of their patches put fixed bugs back into the game. At this point we should be trying to vote with our wallets to show companies that releasing a broken game and fixing it later is not something we should stand for. I still see people getting excited about the roadmap. You guys realize its just more promises right? We should be above applauding companies for making their game better when they take your money then screw you over in the first place. They aren't saints for fixing messes they create. Those that still thank bethesda for drip feeding the content are part of the problem with the gaming industry.
---
What about just a scrapping table, no crafting just scraping junk
---
Lol you gave me a new question and answered it 
---
I've jumped into silos with low levels several times. I usually switch to area chat to help provide instructions, for example ("Hey!  Your stuff's broke?  There's a weapons bench in here"). Also:  there's two weapons benches you could have fixed your melee weapons at.  There's also a PA and regular armor stations in the reactor area, along with the tinker bench in the storage room. 
---
Move them all to segregated servers.
---
Glad you didn't meet a lvl 100+ griefer like some people here.
---
I’m new to the game/franchise, closest thing I’ve ever played to fallout was Skyrim, so far I’m loving this game!
---
Thanks for the help because this build I made for myself and wanted feedback 
---
550xp each 
---
You haven't lived until you've killed another player with a squishy cloth mallet that has saw blades attached (fwiw it does like 200+ damage in my hands when fully repaired).  
---
There are lots of items you can sell to other players for up to 25K caps, those that aren't quite good enough to warrant "trade only" status. Also known heavily duped items can be bought for caps.
---
Cool
---
You gotta buy a new account, since character name don't appear...
---
Plus more for the adds. 
---
Are you using gunsmith? I only use a bloodied sledgehammer and a bloodied Gatling gun. I use gunsmith and one level of lucky break for the sbq fight.
---
The game is currently balanced so you have to use five perk slits in int to avoid weapon depredation. Weapon kits would screw that up.
---
Yeah I am playing with an executioner's rolling pin with sharp mod and a baseball bat with a barbed mod. Too bad you can't play with two mallets, one in each hand. Lol 
---
and you get mole rats and radscorpions every 15 minutes?
---
Dinner code too, do you copy?
---
Oh I'm with you. I've got a female Rifleman alt with the Nuka girl outfit that's got an Alien blaster sidearm, a Tricentennial painted Laser rifle, and a Plasma sniper.
---
That's not the usual play setup I use with her, but when I want to mess around, I'll often equip that loadout and run around helping n00bs or hunting bounties
---
No worse than the scorched/super mutants that accost my camp at Harper's ferry or the ghouls at my white springs base built on the north office.
---
Guess you skipped the 4 posters with "activate" options on the speakers in the Enclave bunker. It tells you how to solve it there. 
---
Second this, melee+vats+stealth is pretty dope. Jumping and slashing like a ninja!
---
Lol there’s a difference between blindly praising a game and saying I’m having fun so far. I even made a point to mention I’m only lvl 15.  Believe me, if and when I get to the point where I feel like the game is steaming garbage I’ll simply stop playing like any reasonably intelligent person.  
---
I bet you’re the type that scoffs at new employee enthusiasm at work.  You should try to be happy, sparkles. Lmao
---
AFAIK, the ones who do are doing so via group farming and/or buying them off of the market subs.
---
What’s for stop people picking it up and taking it all away. 
---
2 are in enclave bunker lol
---
That was in there for like a week, not a day.
---
Is this how bumblebee lost his voice?
---
Yup. Sadly Pistols are pretty weak at late levels in 76. They can be pretty powerful early on (hell base damage .44 revolver/Western Revolver is on par with a sniper rifle!) but they have some significant drawbacks. 10mm pistol just doesn't do much damage lategame; 44 can't take armor piercing magazines, or silencers; there's no armor piercing perks, and the one "cripple/stagger" perk is a !!4%!! chance, compared to 12-30% for other weapon classes. Energy weapons are a whole different class of broken overall, pistols and rifles.
---
Supposedly there's a big rebalance patch in the works for next month that I'm assuming is going to address a lot of the weapon/perk/armor balances issues. We'll see what happens.
---
Do they defend the camp and can I remove the perk cards after I've tamed them and have them stay? First I've heard of this.
---
This is my route at Watoga. Depending on the server, these may have been already looted. 
---
* AMS building - (prepare to fight a lot of turrets) there are 3 fusion generators and one laying around. Outside there's a PA by the crashed Vertibird.
---
* Civic Center - In the main event room, a PA in the corner.
---
* Emergency Services Building - top floor, left room, after the stairs next to a enamel bucket and PA on the roof. North of this building is another building with a crashed vertibird with PA next to it.
---
* Transit hub - Fusion Generator behind a level 3 lock pick and a PA.
---
Total 11 Fusion Cores.
---
I tried playing vanilla FO4 survival after FROST and it was a literal cakewalk lmao
---
How about stillsuits that reduce water loss by 99%? &lt;_&lt;
---
I ran with an experienced group when I completed I Am Become Death, so probably. 
---
I won't spoil it then, but the Chinese figured it out, something that Modus informs you of and points you in that direction iirc. 
---
Is this one of those situations where I'm supposed to accept that this isn't Fallout 5 and I've set my expectations too high?
---
You better watch yourself
---
*We're wanted men!*
---
How many more do you need? If it's just a few I suggest just clearing your way through West Tek to the terminal that activates the decon arc. It's right near the entrance and you get useful super mutants to kill. Just server hop until you get it.
---
I want to put a siren in mine.  
---
Oh cool, I didn't know I could still do the quest. Looks like I have a project for this weekend!
---
I've got 20 more to do 
---
I figured they'd be doing this eventually so I started collecting or taking notice of unique items
---
I've gotten these
---

---
Shit you Right.
---
ill try. i stopped playing around december. i just wanted this game to be better than it was and was waiting for it to get better but apparently it hasn’t. id rather roleplay the crap outta fo nv. 
---
Market subs
---
I could see the radstag mount being possible, as they already have the code basically. They copied the dragons from Skyrim into here, so why not the horses as well. 
---
As far as the ATV, I'd say if they did it would be more of a passive benefit like fast traveling in exchange for depleting the fusion core or using oil and allowing you to travel while overencumbered.
---
Cool idea, but also sounds like a nuke magnet :D
---
They should do something like making BF a craftable item like gunpowder or other resource materials. Maybe something like fiber optics + cloth + whatever. That would be helpful.
---
Alright I’ll stay true to the gunslinger style, and I agree as my .44 somerset special is doing 60 damage (lvl 5 elite pistol with 50% armour pierce), I am curious about the rifle dmg perks I put in my build as well as tank killer, do you think that’s alright or should I go more for vats/pistol perks? 
---
Don't know if you can actually complete a quest as it's part of "I Am Become Death", but you can still access the area and explore. 
---
whaaaa, I don't know how to change servers whaaaaa
---
I hate these type of guys.  Sorry you had that happen.  You have to be a real garbage person to gain joy from being a douche to other players like that.  This is supposed to be PVP lite which means it's not supposed to be jerk vs jerk like in Rust or Fortnite which is ruthless and not my type of game.  Hopefully PVP server will draw off the jerks..
---
It would be a CAMP item and unmovable like all your other CAMP items?
---
And spice?
---
You and your teamnates can pay 1000 caps per teammate to combine camps into a larger group camp. Whenever one player who payed joins the camp spawns. 
---
+karma
---
The game was fun. Until you beat every quest and discover every location within 2 weeks
---
Ah
---
I was just about to post the same question. 
---
I have the death sentence on 12 systems. 
---
since Saturday, a bunch of daily quests are spawning enemies under the floor or in walls.
---
There is a weapons work bench next to the shack that hold the glasses cavern exit. And as far as realism, this is a game. That is set in a not real wasteland. With weapons made from minimum materials. Realism of anything is thrown out the window in all fallout games. 
---
https://youtu.be/FaOO0jMRulo?t=23
---
I launched my first this past weekend, my friends have launched plenty so I've got materials and experience.  Probably should have done SBQ or harpers ferry because I need violet flux.  Went with Top of the World because i hated everything about Rose and her stupid quests.
---
Highly recommend having fun with your first one, there will be other nukes for farming.
---
I remember a tiny lake with a pier and a skeleton that had been fishing, somewhere in the forest. Probably something like that
---
Where'd u get that hat
---
I think you should be able to craft the veil.
---
What's the other stars on it?  I might pay 1 more cap than the highest bidder. 
---
Things I rarely see like fancy capacitors or drumsticks I've started looking for. Excited to make a real Bar with bottles and cups, to put a scientific looking lab in the back, maybe a full on mock store with stocked shelves and listed prices
---
The armor penetrating perks and effects are my biggest complaint with regards to armor balancing in PvP. With a combo of Anti-Armor and a max ranked armor penetration perk you get to ignore most of the target's DR.
---
What's more, if you have those same armor piercing setups they don't work on Assassin Sentinel sets due to however the damage is calculated even if the same hit on a PA player would one-shot them. 
---
Hey what system are you on I have the Vail but I lost my dress so I don't have any attachments to it I'm on PS4
---
Xbox
---
Wondering why people are downvoting this so heavily it isn't controversal. It isn't even bad. It is just an idea. Eh screw it I am done posting ideas. 
---
Happy Birthday 
---
Difficult to implement, but I would love to build a home with my wife (in fallout).
---
Agreed, and ranged weapons should get a damage buff when repaired above 100% since melee weapons do. 
---
Good idea, but we also need to see the situation with the old repair kits in FNV and how we were going to implement it in FO76.
---
Weapon repair kits in FNV brings a new tradition of junk collection (wrench, duct tape, glue, scraps in base game; mugs, clipboards, toasters, cameras, pencils in DLC) in a game that doesn't revolve around collecting junk, and gives the player a tactical choice between carrying a lot of weapons/ammo in your loadout or providing space for junk around in dungeons to make good stuff later in your base.
---
In games like 4 or 76 whose inventory management mainly revolves around getting junk, such goodies would not be scarce and very quickly be a superior choice on repairing weapons in most high-level weapons, further deprecating weapon condition and repairing as a mechanic in the first place (which, probably, the reason why it was scrapped in 4 in the first place). It would need to use rare materials (but not too rare like the fluxes, Ultracite does fall onto this nice balance) to combat overabundance of these things on the wild.
---
I am pretty active on the trade subreddit and ive been able to hit the cap limit several times each within a week each time. I just constantly farm for three star legendary items then sell them for around 4k. When I hit the limit I either buy plans from robot vendors or other player that I know  I can easily sell to get back the 5k caps I invested should I need them.
---
roadmap is one thing, if they actually deliver and it improves the game substantially is another
---
Was expecting to see the turrets behind the golfclub..lol jk
---
Brotherhood of steel started my fall and Fallout 3 killed any kind of interest i had in the integrity of the lore. New vegas came close but then fallout 4 reminded me bethesda doesn't really "get" fallout and only relies on a reskinned elder scrolls and a pedestrian understanding of the story that happened. 
---
That being said,  this isn't really fallout i want but it is really great for what it is. I'll play the new Wasteland or Ground Zero for the experience i want.  Fallout 76 is what it is and i enjoy it. I wish it was something else, but fallout isn't what i wanted for decades now. 
---
It make sense tho, they got to appease shareholders
---
Did you happen to find a location called the "old Fishing Hole"?  
---
It's part of a challenge for this week and I'm on a mission to find it.
---
I'll send this suggestion to the team right now :)
---
Helping people gets old.  I'd rather hear them whine about how they got outplayed.  Makes me grin ear to ear. 
---
Ranged weapons do get a buff from over-repair, another reason to want to keep them topped up.
---
games broken. boycott it until they give us a better game for putting up with this shit.
---
I imagine it'll be a shelf or shelves much like in fallout 4 with the bobbleheads, or books in Skyrim.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Yup! 
---
I get a kick out of the guys who are pissed at the game. Like they’ve never had to miss out on Half Life 2 Episode 3... that’s some real pain... 
---
Make sure everyone has a role in the group and an objective.  Things go way faster if you have a plan when doing quests.  You can have scrapper guy who goes and finds scrap laying around (split it once the quest is done), one guy a lookout and healer essentially a wingman to the lead, and one can be the monster magnet (usually the one with the better weapon/stats for the particular quest monsters). Just divvy up the loot after everything's done.  
---
Look into workshops when making armor (black titanium I had to use a workbench to harvest ore becuase I was too weak for the mole miners) or if you need fusion cores. Three guys can protect a workshop pretty well unless a lvl 100+ with a TSE decides to take it (which doesn't happen too often).
---
You know you can server hop right? And if they fast travelled to you it's either your camp was near something they could FT to, or you have a mole on your friend list.
---
Lol wtf
---
Power Armor/Heavy Weapons/Explosives. SOOO MANY FUN TOYS TO PLAY WITH. And you can carry 8 of them for 1 rifle! Plus All the bombs! (Bear Arms+Ordinance Express). 
---
Let's count all the heavy weapons:
---
Broadsider (This one's really just for the luls)
---
Harpoon Gun (Make it a shotgun with infinite ammo!)
---
Laser Gatling (laser disco)
---
Plasma Gatling (good DPS but bad durability)
---
Gatling Gun (slow and hard hitting)
---
50cal Machine Gun ("classic" HMG; this and the Gatling are bread and butter)
---
Light Machine Gun (definetly just for the luls. Too expensive to keep fed, too weak to be worth keeping fed. But I've got a 25% fire rate one that shots 10 bullets a second with no spinup. Like a better minigun with a small mag)
---
Minigun (Classic, but it's damage per bullet is horrible. Shoots a lot really fast though. Fun to RP as the Brotherhood and go rampaging through the Forest or somewhere lowlevel where you actually do enough damage to kill shit)
---
Autogrenade launcher (Expensive to use regularly, but an Instigating one will oneshot level 68 Scorched if you build right)
---
Missile launcher (4 barrels and tracking mod! Slap a jetpack on your power armor and be Pharah from Overwatch!)
---
Fat Man (Point away from face or nearby objects.)
---
M79 (but really, if you have an autogrenade, dont bother)
---
My build, tweak to suit. (I run a Bloodied/Adrenal Reaction/Nerd rage build)
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f634e86&amp;d=sq2sw2s22s32sr2pe2pq1pj0eh2c72ib3ic4ip2ir1a72a04lt2l22&amp;w=&amp;n=The Heavy
---
I run some utility perks, but the SPECIAL spread allows for a lot of flexibility. I can drop the Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw perks and pick up more damage and stagger, at the cost of much more frequent weapon repairs; I can switch them with more defensive perks like Serendipity; I should really switch Action Boy with something else, I just run around overencumbered alot (even with Bear Arms and Ordinance Express, I'm carrying like 200 grenades, 8+ heavy guns, several melee weapons, a recon scope'd revolver, a hundred 40mm grenades, 40 missiles, 8 mininukes, 5k 50cal rounds, ~2k 5mm rounds for my Gatling gun, about 20 Fusion Cores.... I might have a problem.)
---
I agree with you as well haha. I’m waiting for it to get better so in the meantime, I’m playing other games 
---
Not a dmg bug
---
yeah i know but i don’t want the perk to take up perk slots meant for my melee weapons, more convenient to have a permanent perk in the weapon, helps with stash management too
---
Well whenever someone else loads into an inside location or into the world, the game re-spwans enemies so that is what happened. 
---
Good. There’s always board games. I hear those usually launch with no bugs. As for me I’m going to stick with fallout. I love this game and I’ve been playing since the beta! Th road map looks awesome. Whoa to me for screwing up the game industry by allowing them to make a game I really enjoy. 
---
Well, server hopping West Tek that many times will give you plenty of XP, caps, useful stuff and legendary opportunities.
---
Would that be because they were duping cards?
---
You're a true friend. From someone who has only understood that darkness for the longest time, you are helping. Thank you.
---
Graham sells it too, if you can find him. 
---
Funny thing. I switched games, then went to hang out with the family. Came back, and THE GUY IS IN MY SESSION. 
---
Gaming friends are the best kinda friends, I swear. I used to play on Xbox One. I have all the biggest consoles including pc, but currently no internet connection. As soon as I'm back on, I'll send you a message
---
I see where you're coming from, but what's the point of having 200% condition if you're going to repair it before it's below 100%?  You might as well not be using the perk. 
---
I just tried the pond next to the Isolated Cabin (just South of Vault 76) - that wasn't it.
---
I'm honestly doing really damn well. I haven't felt this good in the longest while. I attribute a big amount of that happiness to my buddy. He didn't have to keep on messaging me, but he's helped me more than he knows.
---
You're more than welcome :)
---
Bro this same shit happened to me, meanwhile level 90 with level 25 excavator armor...kinda embarassing lol this may be the only reason I create a new character.  Have spent so much time enduring the freezes and lag-outs that I almost just want to say fuck it, what I have is good enough lol and never playing this game again.  Literally just froze up 6 times in a row 2 minutes in to joining a world.  6.   Literally took me half an hour to get more than 3 minutes of continuous play time at once.  IDC who you are as a creator but that's just pathetic
---
I will check tomorrow.  I wear mine currently.  I will see if I can craft.  If so I will make you a replacement. 
---
We always love reading ideas like this. Thank you for taking the time to post! I'll share this with the rest of the team :)
---
Eventually the scrapped junk will overencumber. How about the special scrapper backpacks add no carry weight? Seems like a fair balance.
---
Then you got a mole ;)
---
Actually felt relief with the road map. The whole time it just felt super uncertain with all the rumors and such going about. It actually made me feel bethesda really has buckled down and is really gonna ride this for a good while. I just hope the momentum gets stronger and stronger as we see more and more content being added. It is a huge step in the right direction.
---
thx for lookin... depends on what means unarmed, more like which weapons in pa are defined like unarmed... only fists?
---
Scrapping junk was the part that I consider too powerful.
---
Agree kill three of them today in a run and got garbage.  Sometimes I feel like the amount of ammunition that I need to invest to kill one of this guys is not worth the loot.
---
Armor should by no means remain effective under power armor. Power armor = general pve with ease. It has rad resist, high dr, and PA armor mods. I'm not saying things like fusion cores shouldn't be easier or that the dr couldn't be a little higher, but it's mostly balanced. And don't give me that "assassins sentinel" argument because a power armor build with a .50 cal wipes assassins sentinel with EASE. So do shotguns up close.
---
Server hop mama dulce
---
I mean, it was legit my best friend and I playing. We were the only two in the team. I dunno. 
---
Ehh. I’d go all in and pick up VATS perks, because you’re trying to compensate for an already weaker weapon. But I’m a minmaxer at heart (both of my characters are Bloodied/Adrenal reaction builds running around at 20% health doing crazy ranged damage), so do what feels right for you. 
---
Also some people hate VATS, but on my stealth vats sniper, have concentrated fire and gun-fu means I’m popping 5 headshot kills in about 5 seconds with a good lever action rifle. The results are hard for me to argue with! 
---
Heya! We've seen a couple of you post this suggestion now, and have passed it on to the team. Thanks for sharing :)
---
Heres how it works for a few people:
---
\-Wow this game is so much better than people said! What a great game!
---
\-A few days later: holy shit this game is terrible.
---
Rockhound ftw.
---
This. Never had one quite that high, but I've sold a chest piece for 10k, and bought a weapon for the same price as well as an armor piece for 13k. 
---
I despise the "trade-only" items as there's a lot of inherent risk when trading with an unknown, or for some, even friends. 
---
serves you right for getting people to buy trash like this imo
---
You can scroll the list down to reveal more places if you don't want to waste a ton of time looking for it.
---
Likely they'll do things like this so that people log on every day to check.
---
15 perception, 4 charisma, 5 intelligence, 15 agility, 15 luck

---
mod your weapons Critical with Calibrated, Tweaked Automatic, or Severe receivers, Hip-fire accuracy and low weight. Reflex sight is more than good enough accuracy boost.
---
branch into rifles, combat rifle and lever action are great VATS rifle. Handmade chews through AP unless its full-auto.
---
Well I hope the game either adds some good perks for pistols or atleast a legendary weapon that’ll ignore armour because if that’s what’ll make it competitive I’ll be happy, regardless I’ll see how I feel about pistol later, one thing I know that won’t change is my love for the game in general lol. 
---
I do like to sneak but I see it as a way to pick off a few guys before initiating and committing myself to a fight 
---
Hope so. Could you imagine someone scavenging your place clean. 
---
If I recall correctly, the physics in the fallout universe require a slightly different type of nuclear material (or, the same name, but with slightly different properties). The result is lower yield nukes, but safer deployment of nuclear energy for general purpose use, which is part of why nuclear energy is so prevalent in everything from cars to robot butlers.
---
Also, the 50s vibe and "older" computer tech is partly related. Due to the relative ease of researching and deploying nuclear energy, they also developed transistors later in the timeline, resulting in the alternate history compared to real life where some things are massively stunted, but others are waaay farther ahead. Basically, because they had a near endless, cheap, energy source, they didn't have to innovate as much to make it past the same boundaries the scientists and societies in real life had to. 
---
Why is it that everytime i take down a whitesprings sentrybot their loot table is empty? Like i'll see their loot table for a fraction of a second but then, empty!
---
It has been before Saturday. I was having that issue every since there last update.
---
The fact that a weapon can break at all **fighting a single enemy** really should be a hint that durability needs a rebalance. I don't care if it's a final boss or a low-level quest boss, if weapons degrade so fast that they break within a single fight, then something isn't right.
---
I'm not high enough to fight the Queen yet, but I've had weapons break fighting single enemies. I'm around level 30 right now and it's getting ridiculous. Enemies keep getting more bullet spongey and weapons keep getting nerfed. A couple of patches ago I couple one-shot most equal level enemies with my black powder pistol, shotgun, or hunting rifle. Now it's 4-5 rounds. I'm running out of functional weapons by the end of a single story quest. It's not fun, realistic, or immersive.
---
a 10mm pistol can 4 shot a level 68 warlord with zero gunslinger perk cards and level 2 adrenaline.
---
Specific weapon mods and VATS skills multiply base weapon damage. 28 base damage full auto 10mm pistol - x2 head shot x2.0-3.5 sneak x1.5 tweaked receiver x1.3-??? concentrated fire x1.3 GunFu x 1.42 adrenaline x??? VATS Crit.
---
Not on your team, but on your friends list. Somebody on your list could have followed you to the new server and brought the griefers with them. And then that person fast travels near your location, and the griefers follow them. 
---
Do you have a death sentence on twelve systems?
---
You get bonus damage /damage resist if its above 100%.
---
That damage degrades gradually between 200-100
---
None of my friends really play this game. Maybe two others. And they were on different games. 
---
Oh, and since weapon repair kits are functionally similar to alien epoxies from Mothership Zeta, bring it back too as a reward for killing Flatwoods monsters.
---
Don’t have a spare plan unfortunately but would be happy to put the paint on for you. Free to a fellow forbidden knowledge grinder. 
---
I needs to be "Powered"...but I agree...it would be a cool thing to have.
---
Hmm.. I wasn't aware you get bonuses outside of less maintenance for being above 100%. Sorry, I'm casual.
---
I have tried riding it, no dice. Soon as it starts to lift off you fall through into the hatch. You do get sealed in though! 
---
And I didn't take any damage from the liftoff either. 
---
I just tried the pond next to Anchor Farm - no dice.
---
THERE'S A CAP LIMIT?! I never have more than 200 caps at any given time because I spend them all on FUCKING STIMPAKS! 90+ caps for one stimpak, ridiculous.
---
I leave shit to low level people all the time. Especially ammo and stuff I don’t use. I pick up everything and when I have enough I give it away. 
---
Yeah, it would definitely be a “powered” item. It might even be cool for everything in it to spoil if it loses power. 
---
Portable turret would be fun
---
No worries, thats what makes the drill and buzz blade ridiculously good weapons.
---
I mean, that's a person who's chosen to engage in PVP, who's killed while flagged for PVP. Different situation for sure. 
---
But they knew "Alright people are gonna wanna watch the nuke go out the silo so let's put a good amount of detail into it"
---
Great fucking haul my friend
---
We need legendary power armor then.
---
Otherwise the legendary effects of normal armor should remain effective from underneath the power armor. Where's the benefit of High DR when every player and their dog has legendaries or perks to bypass armor?
---
The Power-armor mods are also expensive as fuck (Excavator mods in particular, Excavator Armor is THE only Viable armor for Melee Characters, giving you both Ore-mining and bonuses to strength for a complete set.)
---
Most awesome of you !! believe it or not my buddy just got his !!! On the very first try !!! I’m going to kill myself lolololo !! he’s going to put the paint on tonight for me., but thank you for the offer it’s infinitely gracious of you for whatever reason he doesn’t , I accept your offer in advance !!! How many tries did it take you ??? Hit me up if you ever want to play  my gt is lostspartan034 .
---
D'oh, thank you!
---
Sometimes?
---
Can I ask what specifically the bonuses are? I don't recall seeing anything in my status screen when my weapons are over 100%.
---
This belongs in r/fo76bazaar 
---
Ok thanks
---
I feel that when the news feed title reads as "Bethesda, your un-killable glowing mongrel may need work", you already know full well what it is. Especially if you're making a comment like the one earlier. Just saying
---
I did. Countless hours in 3, NV, and 4
---
Ps4
---
no
---
There’s an entire sub dedicated to this stuff r/fo76bazaar
---
The plans for many things do not exist in game. But if you want a better grenade the Nuka grenade is your answer.
---
I like the idea but the fridge needs a limit. Its gotta be like a container that can only hold so much food. 
---
Haha. No problem.
---
Got it!! Solomon’s pond!
---
That sounds awesome Im about to sign on, now I know what I’m doing first
---
"It's the first post apocalyptic survival game I've played, where it actually feels like surviving an apocalypse."
---
try Metro Exodus, that's a post-apocalyptical survival game.
---
That's the exact mentality I had when I bought Fallout 76, and when I pre-ordered Anthem. Tbh, most people can't define what you enjoy playing, which is why I keep an open mind and try something if I think it looks fun or will be fun to play with friends.
---
Honestly didn't, because like I said I don't follow this game. Also it was just a joke, if you like the game keep playing. I hope Bethesda keeps supporting it for people that do but havea feeling as soon as their next title is out they will be distancing themselves from F76 as much as they can.
---
If your teammate seeks revenge, the other team is flagged hostile to your entire team, and vice-versa. As far as traveling to your camp, that seems odd.  
---
If you weren't able to damage him, it could have been an Assassin Sentinel or Cavalier set that allowed that. Could have also been a glitch. Had a teammate who was hitting a player flagged hostile to the rest of the team, but only hitting for slap damage. The guy hit back for full damage. 
---
Oh, then don't you know that it's just a reference?
---
Hey, at least you don't have the idiocy that is selling all your Stimpaks *before* doing a silo run like I did on my first time.
---
It's Fallout. Part of a great series of games. 76 does have it's problems but some have been addressed. Some have not. Here's hoping they can correct the worst ones like the disappearing Legendary weapons from your inventory. To me that's the worst bug in the game.
---
Are bos fatigues rare? Never knew because I had found a bos officers suit blueprint its much like the orange but all black fits well with the sentry bot helm, and can make them for days.
---
Or, if the plant is up, just connect a power post to it so the default power box connection un-glitches. No need to build a fusion reactor.
---
And as I write this, I’m totally not camping out, chameleon’d, on top of someone’s fusion core processor waiting for the next core to pop. In all seriousness, the workshop is unclaimed and I’m just thankful they left it unlocked before they disconnected and I don’t have to spend the caps to claim the workshop. 
---
True, maybe it could be made in way that gives it a weight limit that someway works with the stash limit. Like the fridge itself can hold 10lbs and that 10lbs just comes from your stash limit. The fridge itself can only hold certain items (no weapons or armor) that don’t exceed that 10lbs or however much. 
---
It's rarely ever running when I show up, and it's so much easier to just drop a gen. 
---
Not sure why you're getting down-voted. But I constantly see GDC talks where developers say unless your games foundation is based on "realism", like a simulator. If "realism" is the only reason you can give for having a mechanic in your game, then you need to take another look at it or scrap it.
---
That’s a good result. IIRC I think I got mine within the first 10-15 times but I can assure you I’ve had many “rewards” of just stimpacks since. I noticed you mentioned jetpacks, was this for the T60? I can do either T60 or T51b, I just can’t remember which! If you’d like I’ll check in a few hours when I’m next on. If it’s the correct one I’d be happy to do the jet pack for just the materials. Thanks.
---
He never said he was one shotted. And if you knew anything about slap damage you would know you can easily die from it from multiple hits. 
---
If you want to use pistols you are kind of forced to use vats. It's nice though. you want to get a lot of luck skills. Four leaf clover will help you crit a lot with pistols. Making up for the otherwise lower dmg of it. Vats crit build with automatic rifles is also really fun. Uses a bit more ammo though.
---
I’d like to put a Deathclaw hand out, or even add taxidermy heads on the wall
---
Zero gunslinger cards but a nice stack of adrenaline, several perks THAT DO NOT WORK ON FIRST SHOT (concentrated fire only stacks up after multiple shots on the same target; gunfu only hits 1.3x on the 4th target), tweaked receiver is crits only, so are you counting 4x crits as your 4shot?
---
I think the planned content will improve the game for all of us. Im lvl 103 and still love it. The griefing? Eh whats a survival game without it. Iv gotten a good amout of revenge on griefers, and now iv got my assassins sentinel armor to surprise em with 🤓
---
My first thought when I saw that launch was I need to put a camp near there!
---
Don’t worry man, I’m also a high level and I like to kill any d-bag like this I see, there’s plenty of good high lvls out there.
---
As much as we all complain, the game today is way better than at launch, also , while you are at the lower levels, the combat mechanics seem to be working fine vs lower level mobs, it’s once you got all the missions done and up to a high level where you start noticing the combat issues.
---
Bug-wise , the game has come along way tho :)
---
It looks just like all the mineral extractors with a little oil pump looking thing pumping on top. I don’t know where it’s at on the others, but it’s very close to the workbench at Poseidon, but attached to the power plant building itself, right next to the northeast entrance doors. 
---
Bring back whole New Vegas weapon system
---
That would be awesome ,yes!!! Let me know I’m running around now !!
---
What are you talking about? Apparels weight is 0.1 * 4 witch costumes(50c each) * 7 vendors = 2.8. How many apparels are you planning on carrying? Maybe 100000... duper style! Ok!
---
I killed my first SB on my lvl 30 character last night(with the help of Rifle based perks and a Gatling Laser I got from a mutie) and like literally the only thing it gave me was bones and a steak, nothing good at all. Took about a solid forty minutes to kill it, landed three times in total.
---
Have no idea. Never heard of someone getting banned for keeping one of those, but seeing that bethesda can keep track of some illicit items, maybe it can get your account flagged? Think I saw a screenshot of bethesda support email saying that it's an obtainable in-game item and there's no reason to ban someone for keeping them, but it is clear that bethesda support guy doesn't know what he's talking about. There's no known way to obtain said helmet legitimately atm
---
I thought the boosters break off and what's left to impact is small? 
---
Check out this post, it has some actual figures:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aao6ae/how_to_make_the_chainsawripper_high_damage_and/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Welcome. 
---
Yeah, the game isn't nearly as bad as people would lead you to believe. It's certainly not perfect, but I had a blast with it. 
---
It's just that negativity plays better on YouTube, it gets more clicks. So youtubers tended to emphasize every negative aspect to generate more revenue. 
---
If you want a genuine and honest critique of the game, and places where it's lacking, *Many A True Nerd* just posted a 2.5 hour video with his thoughts. But I would recommend that you don't watch it, yet. 
---
Play for a while first, form your own opinions, see what you think. Once you've finished the main storyline, that's probably a good time to watch the video. You'll get a lot more out of it then, plus you'll avoid spoilers. 
---
Simply going to say no, cause junk is needed for that.
---
I’ve never even had someone with a 50 cal or a shotgun do any damage to my assassin sentinel armor.  The 50 cal has stagger from one fun army sure but it lacks the damage output to make it matter, the user usually dies from me before they can fire off a handful of rounds. And a explosive shotgun is just laughable, I let explosive shotgun guys shoot me while I taunt them, 0 dmg ever and I think that’s just because of dense mod and fireproof, not the legendary armor.
---
exactly.
---
for the first month and a half it was a patch every week, after that it was a crusade to stop bitch ass dupers. 
---
an argument can be made that those patches shouldn't have been necessary if they just made the game better from the beginning, but that's not what happened, so we go from there. 
---
because it's fucking fun. 
---
This is good stuff. Thanks for sharing. If someone wanted to make a good run of it, start in Watoga and do Worldsokayestdad’s route, then head over to the east end of Big Bend Tunnel. There’s a PA spawn at the entrance. Then about half way through the tunnel, there’s another PA spawn. Then exit the west end and do OP’s route. It seems going through the tunnel east to west with a sniper rifle is much easier than the opposite direction. For some reason I get surrounded more easily going west to east.
---
Experienced this a few nights ago just at the train station near Poseidon Power Plant
---
Smeargle!
---
when a company consistently fucks up their PR revolving around a shitty game, maybe don't try to white knight that company and look like a fig. 
---
note: yes, I said fig as in f. i. g. because figs are limp, weak pieces of shit and all of them should be burned from existence for doing nothing useful to anyone. 
---
I know this post is a month old but any chance you still have the deep pocketed combat armor chest plan? I will pay you a nice price for it 
---
Cool  thanks I’ll look for another t-60 or t-51 torso!!
---
I was think more like 15 unique food items period. I'd prefer people not hoarding the best regen buffs in the game. 
---
I play on xbox! The more the merrier!
---
Ok but really, has anyone tried this? Standing on top of the silo while the nuke is launching? Do you get struck by the nuke and die? Do you spawn in space? Do you go higher and higher and glitch out of existence?
---
I work too many hours and need to know dammit!!!
---
Ya so it is questionable thats why I am asking
---
They have already responded to a post just like yours stating that it is in the works.
---
For high-level characters, the only benefit of wearing power armor is the rad resistance (and fast-travel, if you have calibrated shocks). If I'm not in a nuke zone, I don't wear power armor -- and I'm a melee build.
---
Well, I just find it so stupid. I was doing so little damage. It pissed me off, and as for the team mates. He was also pressing ignore or continue or whatever it is. 
---
We can do this the easy way, or the hard way.
---
My friend here Likes the hard way.    
---
If you're on Xbox I'll give you the bos plans for free 
---
I’ll be careful. 
---
&gt; Head down towards Phoenix (there's a magazine on the roof by the gnome btw)
---
I haven't seen the magazine in like two months now, what gives?
---
I am gt is lostspartan034 I’m on now thank you!!
---
I’m getting the same thing
---
There's three options:  Respawn, Seek Revenge, and Ignore. Hitting Ignore only adds the player that killed you to your blocked list. 
---
I've seen a lot of players continually hit seek revenge thinking it's how to respawn and get butthurt over the fact they keep getting killed as they respawn nearby and are still flagged hostile.  The player that killed them has no way of knowing they're just trying to get away.  They're notified the player they just killed is seeking revenge and can only assume that's actually the case. 
---
Personally, I wouldn't keep them but I think worst that can happen is getting your helmet wiped. Possibly getting your account flagged for potential exploiter
---
Probably because I disagree with the person and find their reason for the game to be a certain way asinine. I have seen so many arguments about “this is not how it would be in real life they need to change it” comments since this game was released (not just here but other places the I frequent that has to do with this game). The most common one being the .50 cal hunting rifle doing less damage then a hardened receiver. This game is not CoD or a modern war simulator. Realism is and should not be an issue with this game. 
---
Sorry for the rant. I am a little irritated and taking it out on reddit. Lol.  I do agree with you. 
---
We were both pressing respawn. 
---
Me too.
---
They give sometimes nice ammo too.
---
On PS4 close the application out completely, reboot the PS4 and reset the wifi connection. That usually works for me, however I haven't experienced this issue in several weeks now.
---
Ebay and there is also reddit for that but i dont remember the name 
---
Love that shot, really looks like he's trying.
---
Fair suggestion. Not intrested myself but since the function is ingame a camp mirror should exists to interact it.
---
Same here. OP was in Australia, so am I.
---
I played yesterday with no issue. 
---
If you're on Xbox, I'll give you a bunch of stimpacks. I find them everywhere.
---
How much did you pay? 
---
I haven’t played in while and I decided why not play and this showed up
---
That's a big thing to ask, how mirrors generally work in games.
---
Yep me too was online for hours this morning had a break and when out then tryed to jump back to meet up an sell some items now getting this miraculous error code and I cant find any information about it?
---
Im ps4 pro wbu?
---
I mean how much caps certain items are selling for like I have a full set of t-45 power armor and I don't know how much to sells for 
---
I think this is the best solution for the game by keeping the effect of having weapons break while not being able to simply go farm a low level place real quick and whip up 50 lightweight repair kits to roll around with. 
---
I hit 5.5k once. LOL I'm always buying plans and recipes, so my caps don't last long. :p
---
Well u can find it for free so.. Maybe 1k caps or lower 
---
Just standard ps4
---
Cheer's 
---
My aa double barrel point blank with concentrated fire works wonders or instigating mole miners with 40% more power damage destroys anything 
---
It's part of the main quest! But yeah you can repeat it. 
---
Okay well that sums thst out, Are you from Australia if you don't mind me asking?
---
Yeah I’m from Australia 
---
Yea same my isp is Telstra, wbu?
---
I’m Optus, maybe it’s just a server issue?
---
Mine just started working so my guess it was their Australian servers that had an unusual problem as this post is the only one with this code on the internet.
---
I've had it for longer than that. Especially with mole rats. 
---
Towns could be in-nukable. After all, the point of the game is “rebuilding America”. Even Raiders wouldn’t benefit from destroying what little civilization exists...I mean, civilization is where they go to steal food and water. 
---
If a person just wants to RP as a psychotic jerkoff, well, tough shit, they can go play CoD or whatever. 
---
[Ride the Bomb](https://youtu.be/3edi2Wkr5YI) 
---
Hopefully no as power armor is op anyway and us non pa folks need some perks too
---
&gt;The roadmap is such a huge step in the right direction.
---
While I appreciate a developer that offers continuing support, the whole "roadmap" thing has just become the go-to PR move for devs that release unfinished games. They want people to think "Oh, look how transparent they're being, they're acknowledging the issues and laying out a plan to fix them!"  
---
When in reality, these big developers just want you to forget that you paid a premium triple-A price for an unfinished game (that also has micro-transactions).  
---
Releasing a roadmap isn't turning the tables. Following through with the promises made in said roadmap will be "turning the tables."
---
I got mates online in fo76 right now now it seems like a rare isolated issue I could be wrong though 
---
This actually happened to me on my second? run of one of the silos. I just closed the game restarted.
---
You could just let your character die and respawn but the thing is when you die during a silo quest you’ll spawn on the surface and all the enemies reset I believe. 
---
Worth a try, but 2 x PS4s both doing the same thing, and I'm on ethernet not wifi.   The delay of doing what you did is more likely what fixed it.
---
I pay Beth, and every game company, to entertain and distract me...which they've done in spades. Were there problems at launch? Yup. So what? I'm a lead developer that just got rolling the biggest release we've had in many years. Did it have problems at launch? Yup! That was December 3rd. My team has worked evenings and weekends since and now it's super stable and working better than expected, but in between I was as stressed and this game was pretty much my only refuge. At this point I have like 450 hours in and still sane... mostly. Well worth the $60... in a past life I would have spent that in the week on booze! 
---
I think you may be right, is it possible another ban wave happened?
---
Where's our mechanical bombull Atom Shop?
---
Thanks Raiders did reparer  my melee weapon that broke the first time didn't have time to do it a second time was working on the circutets rebuild at that point, bots overwhelmed us as he showed up when I broke them and was starting to rebuild the circutets. It was a mess. Mic him/ No Mic me no commuantion I didn't know to back him up or do my thing? I stood back and did cover fire so I could learn the run though he ditched it and hit behind me. IDK either way learned a lot. All back out next time I guess. 
---
Fishing gear can be bought from 'Cunningham' at the hunting shop in Whitespring's Resort. 
---
Mirelurks can be found in Wendigo Cave I did a run this morning and got 13 in one go. (You can also grab brain fungus + glowing mushrooms from here too for the daily.)
---
Mothman Museum's basement has some cultist clothes but you'll need lock picking level 2 or a key to get into said basement. 
---
Have screenshot?
---
Yeah, rebooting and resetting the WiFi is a bit over kill... However closing the application and restarting it should be the very first step in troubleshooting it.
---
I got other ps accounts i tryed logging in with as well but same error so its not to do with accounts, so yeh probably to do with the server, connection, maybe some sorta interference its really hard to say there's so many possibilities.
---
I got prime receiver plans from two Scorchbeasts that spawned during Surface to Air events. Not sure why they don't drop plans or legendaries regularly. I feel like Scorchbeasts, Behemoths, &amp; Mirelurk Queens are the only actual boss type of enemies you can really run into in FO76 aside from the SBQ. All of them should offer either legendaries even w/o the marker or offer plans. 
---
Do you have the gunsmith perk?  I went rifle/pistol build my first 40 or so levels before focusing more on rifle but I never had a weapon break on me until I got to the bigger places like westek and silos with tons of enemies.  My current non legendary hunting rifle I just repair before I leave my camp and is fine before I get back when I'm totally maxed out on junk. 
---
Heavy weapons for sure suck though. I have an anti armor +vats hit chance The Dragon and I gotta be pretty careful to watch it but it's rate of fire sucks so bad I only use it on legendaries anyways. 
---
Wow, didn't know that...
---
In the atom store
---
Thx
---
Sure there are plenty of bugs, but some can make you crack up and fall off your chair!
---
Thanks a lot for the help! I liked the video and have an idea of the play style I’m creating, as far as I know I’ll enjoy it however if not I can always make a new character, after all i really enjoy this game!
---
Last time I had logged off my character and didn't log back on for a week or so after the black screen hud at Harpers Ferry. Today it was an infinite load screen. Logged off by force closing the application and uninstalled. I see it now for what it was. Just a cash grab like they said.
---
I never repair them while in the silo. I carry 15 good ones into the silo with me.  If I forget, I grab the ones scattered around the storage room then either scrap the damaged ones or make more good ones to help a friend do the same.
---
The bots haven't been an issue for me since my first few runs. Having someone else down there who just wants a free ride while you're struggling is pretty shitty. 
---
YOU'LL BE DEAD!
---
Own any shops?
---
Nice Pic
---
Its working now, how bout you?
---
No
---
Seems to affect my carry weight slightly when not grouped. Only lose a couple pounds but it is noticeable as my carry weight is not a multiple of 5. 
---
All the plans for jetpacks are available at the BoS vendor in Watoga, except X-01 which doesn't have plans for anything but base armour. I'm on PC and get those paint plans every dozen times I run the quest, saw 2 today already.    
---
The X-01 gear is killing me, nearly 700 hrs play and a lot of server hopping and only found the jetpack twice and 1 calibrated shock.    
---
Luck stat seems to have zero to do with finding higher tier items, go figure.
---
I never seen them until someone mentioned them in the market subs..and..I never seen anyone other than myself wearing them
---
FWIW, the Creation Club in FO4 had a weekly freebie too.
---
Point Pleasant. DUH!
---
This was the first thing I saw out of the vault after I made it past the commie bots. Laughed so hard!
---
Only 100 atoms each!
---
The Atom Store one definitely is unique, it has the Atom logo on the item name.
---
Correct. As IRL the warhead is all that falls on the target, and it's basically just the nose cone. 
---
Don't die with all that junk friend. I hope you don't just walk around with a full load of junk an entire session. Stash at regular intervals so when you die and lose it all it won't ruin your day. Consider using the perk that auto-stims when you are low on health so you don't die, and don't be afraid to run away from a fight, such as a hoard of glowing bloated bois
---
I love this
---
All the negative press made me cancel my preorder. A couple moths later, I started watching streamers play and I caved. Been playing pretty much daily ever since. 
---
wear a suit and keep server-hopping 
---
Yeah, but I’m looking for specific locations. Sorry, I should’ve clarified that
---
You find one yet I ca join?
---
Flame on!
---
Interesting. So you’re saying it’s like -0.25 to special?
---
Yes plz. I've just hit 25k for the second time tonight (bought myself and my wife the fluorescent letter sets a few weeks ago) then I turned in the 3 Mistress of Mysteries quests all at once... to watch about 300-400 caps go down the drain as I was already capped out......
---
I have seen no plant beds or they would be inside.
---
If you do these regurlarly i would gladly join sounds like fun 
---
I literally just busted out laughing 
---
Awesome 
---
Ballistic fiber was always hard AF to get anyway
---
Any news if this guy got unbanned or got a response recently? (in the last day or two) I was skeptical of his story at first, but after looking through his post history it really looks like he was 100% legitimate in his gameplay and how he earned all his loot. He’s even got a few posts about being against duping/exploits. Pretty sad to see such a dedicated member of the player base get banned like this.
---
It’s -.5 special points. It’s no bad. Barely noticeable 
---
Honestly with how much OP’s post has blown up, I could imagine them removing the duped items and unbanning people within a week or two, if not maybe when the wild Appalachia season starts. 
---
It absolutely affects the maximum condition of weapons/armor, which has a few benefits. Vendor value is based off condition, so it’s easy to sell a few guns and max vendor caps. Higher condition means weapons/armor last longer. Nice for legendaries ;)
---
As to other loot? No, I don’t think there’s a difference, I run a 6 luck power armor build and a 30ish luck Unyielding sniper, and I don’t see noticeable differences in loot. 
---
A separate sub you say? With members who are always coming over here to shit on this one?
---
Ok.
---
Do you have a chemistry station? You can dilute stimpacks with purified water, making one into two.
---
i did
---
Is it just junk items or other things as well?
---
Kinda hoping I can have a bedside table with whiskey bottle, shot glass, buffout, and daddy-o.
---
So Raiders what do u go into there with?  I don't have any 2,3, tse or anything close to that. Good power armor. Went in with hella grandes thinking I would solo it. The ass hat robots don't drop much besides the swords, the rest where what I already had or mods of it. 
---
Another note having hacker 3 would have helped A Lot I don't have that. Sucks hitting or shooting those turrets!!!
---
I think I have 2 ranks right now. When were you playing at those levels? I had trouble with hunting rifles breaking in November, but the patches in January made it a problem for every weapon class. I've had everything from shotguns to pipe rifles break on me. Never in sessions longer than an hour or two. My main sniper is currently sitting broken in my inventory at my camp because I got sick of repairing it all the time and it took up too much weight to carry around a broken rifle everywhere. My current build carries a shotgun because I can usually pick up a new shotgun from loot when mine inevitable breaks.
---
But then you run into the same problem as a lot of other gripes, small and random player population per game world.  
---
But who knows, there are a couple new modes called out in the DLC roadmap. There's survival, that they already went into. But who knows what Nuclear Winter will be? Could be anything from a different kind of survival mode to a story driven/actual npc using campaign taking place on the same map but during the nuclear winter just after the bombs some lore holotapes talked about
---
Where do you sell three star items? To other players or the vendors at the railway stations?
---
It could be because there are high lvl players nearby or maybe you are just in a high lvl zone? 
---
Could also be a glitch
---
Ah yes -0.5 sorry miscalculated. You know I just bought it from my dealer ;) but a bit reluctant to apply it since I only play in teams with random encounters. 
---
Uhm, dont buy Stimpacks?
---
You have to get rid of your addiction.
---
What happened op
---
My guess is you participated in Uranium Fever... That's a high level event. If you're still with the group they'll spawn high levels. You should server hop and stick to the Toxic Valley and Ash Heap until about level 25 or so. 
---
Other players but you have to be very patient to get a few good weapons/armor and be aware of what people want and are willing to pay for. 
---
Same here! I’m planning on selling things cheaper than the vendors do. 
---
"Lazy devs".
---
The generation rate is so high that most people don't even bother to lock it either. I've never been there and not been offered free cores.
---
If only they put the same effort into the rest of the game.
---
You're right! It was uranium fever
---
My first go was with an auto laser rifle and a gatling plasma.  Both broke whole inside. 
---
I'm Bloodied now and just smack everything with my hammer or buzz blade.  Total time between stepping off the elevator and a nuke in the air is 15-20 minutes. 
---
I’ve spent over $30 on the atom store, and I can say Bathesda is taking a right step in getting people to check out atomic shop more often!
---
Selected the terminal to use it to prep the launch and it froze upon entering the terminal.

My character slowly dehydrated but wouldn’t die...i sat on, say, 5% health for another 10 minutes until I decided to logout instead of destroying our planet.

Don’t you just love spending a good 3 hours on something only to have to go and do it all over again tomorrow morning when you wake up? Can’t be mad though, right? 
---
Haven’t checked
---
This guy was 94 with shitty armor showing up, with a meat hook. I thought great wtf, come on I was almost there and this dude brought in so many other bot's I didn't have to deal with and walked through 1/2 of it maybe more. And I was kool with that, if we got the launch we never joined up ever. I was like fkt it all learn from him cause this is going to be nutz now, he just attacked the smaller bots or hid.
---
Yep, I’ve had it more than 10 times today 
---
This. A very slight debuff to melee and carry weight. The rest will be pretty much imperceptible. 
---
Probably a glitch.

I think they meant put buffout IN the syringe, not take it and shoot it with a regular syringe lol.
---
They are supposed to be adding something to do at Arktos I believe, where you can create giant or tiny versions of any creature that produces a body part, ie meat or proboscis etc.
---
Damn that sucks dude. I've had it crash right after I launched and it's the worst thing ever
---
Just junk you have on your person
---
I’m a girl (: lol but that’s good! Lol you play PS4?
---
All the junk on your character. Anything stashed is safe. 
---
when you die you drop a paper bag filled with all the junk you had on you at that time, you can just go pick it up but so can other people 
---
Thanks for the answers!
---
Your junk
---
Good question, I don’t have a good answer for that. I do know that the Stabilized perk shows a DR reduction when equipping a missile launcher, but I haven’t tested actual damage done 
---
That's exactly the kind of post I was searching for 8 hours ago! Thank you for your time!

Man I would have nuked yall so fast if I knew

Or, maybe they could perfect the base game before dropping some half assed dlc

If I’ve got 14 combat shotguns after taking on hordes of super mutants, why can’t I use the “best parts” of each gun to repair one of them?

Hey how long u be on for.

Wanting speed demon serum have ultracite scrap I just gotta go shops and shit first so won't be on for an hr or so

I’ll be on for another hour or two just reply here when ready

Not to mention hearing that sweet sweet duct tape noise when combining weapons.

I can't wait for the almighty purveyor! Not only do I get some kind of use for my trash legendaries, but I can vendor them out to other players looking to do the same!

The fusion generator seems to have a bounding box just slightly larger then the floor to roof of camp parts, even though an upper floor can be placed over it after, the box just needs to be reduced in height.

Still searching for an answer on how exactly you use this little yellow rectangular boxes. I pick them up and see nothing in my mods tab.

I got it once over by the Charleston station, was so cool! Wish I had recorded it

"From a day one player, who had access but not the opportunity to play the beta, who's played with dupers (given a full set of Cavaliers armor ... sold it to vendors ... not out of spite or disrespect, i just didn't need it and didn't feel cool profiting from an exploit, role playing as a good man in a bad world ... just like real life), anti-dupers (yeah), kids, adults, vets, rednecks, nerds (i got some nerd in me), wierdos (some of that too), noobs, you tube instructional video hackers, liars, pvp'ers, pve'ers, even girls, yeah ... women, and more. I've pvp'd, i've griefed (well i've provided support for griefers), i've grinded, i've farmed, i've server hopped, and i pretty well know what i know in the game. And you don't strike me as legit."

this has to be a fucking copypasta

Poor guy was just an architect on his lunch break.

I'm also a melee build, with a medic and even in a nuke-zone, I find power-armor useless even in Nuke-Zones!

Been trying to buy mutations from you for a while. When are you usually on?
---
Not expectations for the quality of the game, but that it's a different type of game. I realised that I can't judge a game based on the mechanics I enjoyed in previous Fallout games not being in 76. If I get annoyed that I can't order a Big Mac at Burger King, that's my problem.

If you waited this long, it seems like you didn't ignore the reviews at all.

Only problem there would be that it binds you to a team. Unless they made it tied to a seperate group mechanic, which spawns in the world of whoever logs in first, and won't spawn in any other world

Once you join enclave the communication centre in the whitesprings bunker is an excellent place. Otherwise anywhere. Safes often have them too so worth checking these out.

I’d guess your being downvoted because it’s safe to say the state of F76 was never down to the devs, but to the management decisions.
---
Do we know if this is intended behaviour?
---
Otherwise this request looks like an excellent way to prompt a patch note along these lines:
---
\*- Weapons/Armor:\* No longer need to be below 100% durability to be repaired however repairing weapons and armor above 100% no longer incorrectly increases their base damage/resistance values.
---
This is great! I tried this trick a different way because it was described to me, but I didn't realize you could do it on the fly, I thought for some reason it had to be in a blueprint \*d'oh\*

I think I read you go to Bethesda.net and you should have the downloads or links in your inbox or one of the items on the menu, inventory or something.

All power armor mods without the name of the power armor in the title are for the Excarvator. This is a bug but probably not very high priority as I would have thought it could have been fixed by now otherwise.
---
I also have a weird problem with that location. I finished the quest a long time ago, but lately i wanted to visit again the underground headquarters. I wore the veil, the upstairs door opened for me alright, i go down the stairs and the grid turned from blue to red, not letting me pass.... i had the veil on, so i dont understand what happened. If you finish the quest you are not allowed to enter again? or the veil is not enough and you have to wear the garb of mysteries also?
---
anti-armor supersledge with swing speed?
---
Honestly, it depends on your character build. Are you melee or ranged?
---
Melee = 1 hand or 2 hand?
---
Ranged = shotgun, heavy, rifle, launcher, or other?
---
Low health build, tank, PA, vats/crit, other?
---
Im not the most knowledgeable, but I can help out and perhaps learn from others in the process.

So I was having the issue on xbox as well but I deleted cleared the cache and then reinstalled going on a couple of days now and no disconnects

The camp size in Fallout 76 is very small I was wondering if there are plans to make it bigger I purchased a bunch of stuff in the atomic shop but how I have my camp set up I can't really put anything I have one Mordor 3 gun turrets and a small two-story home small farm and water para fire but I also have all of the work benches and I like having the lights details posters excetera I would like to add more decorations tables shelves and other items but the camp size is way too small this is why I miss fallout 4 is there anyway to make it bigger I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate it

Yeah, it happens.

I was level 50 something and ran into the overseer's camp and saw a level 100 standing there. I had a few low level legendaries I wanted to drop and knew he wouldn't be interested. I dropped them and he walked over to look. Then he dropped something and ran off. I checked what he dropped, it was some level 50 legendaries and ammo. I'm still using them. The missing part of this story is who was the player who stumbled across the stuff I left. 
---
I usually land in the world without my camp then exit the game and reload, it likes it better that way for me.
---
I've been playing since release but I was kind of a chicken with my head off when it came to perks until sometime in December when I started to lock into a build. In fact, it was whenever the patch was that let you respec points. I got rank 5 in gunsmith way before though.
---
You did mention not killing guys as fast maybe that's where the difference is. I've got perception maxed out with luck and down lvl64 mutants in 2 headshots. Gutsys are 3-4 to the thruster. I can one shot pretty much any monster but a SB, deathclaw, gulper, mirelurk queen, assaultron, or bus with a stealth crit. Gun Fu bonus damage helps a lot too. 
---
I don't wear PA and usually carry about 350-400 rounds for that hunting rifle when I leave my cabin to go do do events and hunt. My cabin is way up North so I hit up the Watoga train station for the ammo bench there and to drop off junk until I eventually end up back up there and always do it back to full even if it's still got durability left. 
---
TSE is extremely rare, my recent chance estimate is
---
1:5 - get a ranged, 1:9 - get 2-3\*, 1:27 - get two shot, 1:12 - get explosive, 1:81 - get Handmade = \*\*\~1 : 120,000\*\*.
---
The loot pool is flooded with armor and melee weapons, so you start with a 20% chance to get a ranged in the first place. I don't know about paint chances and I'm not looking for them as I'm in Excavator which has no paints.
---
Wait. There is a part in the game that explains all about how to do decrypt it? I’ve always wondered how people figured out that complex process and built that nuke crypt website!!
---
Have exactly the same problem - it's random - I post, look at reddit if it's there within 5 mins I repost, check again. Kinda annoying...
---
Totally agree, total dick bag move and lame af.
---
I know about this, so what I do after I am done with a workshop, I switch servers so the workshop becomes unclaimed .. also that workshop tends to draw in low life players, not sure why people like it, I hate it because it is so closed in .. but that's me.
---
I’m a mix of ranged and low health 
---
the romans knew about the dangers of lead

I used to farm caps and magazines at the Poseidon energy plant for my collection. So I do a run, hop servers, check the fusion generator as I go past, collect magazines and do it again 
---
But now I can’t farm caps the generator and magazines trick still works 
---
This is still a great way to get fusion cores as after about 5/6 hops I’m collecting cores people have left in the generator after claiming. So I end up with dozens 
---
munitions factory is the mouth of hell
---
Here is the thing, this all happened within 10 minutes of me joining the server, I spawned at the factory where I last was, claimed it because I saw it was empty, then left did an event and then went to sell the loot I got from it at the vendor and then bam dead 9 times -700 caps.
---
Sure is what it seems like
---
Grafton vendors (trainstation and responders) sell it (I was server hopping for it before the patch that widen vendors plans, but it's definitelly there.
---
It should load you into the catwalk that you walk over when fighting your way thru.

--SPOILERS--

---
The Chinese have a base under Mama Dolce's, the entrance of which is concealed in the piping on the side facing VTU. They had figured out how the codes worked. The cipher is simple enough to be solved by hand if you have the keyword (which Modus will eventually figure out each week, gradually revealing new letters). It's just a standard keyword cipher. Once the letters are switched to their now deciphered letters, they make an anagram. Figure out the 8 letter word they spell, then order the numbers to correspond with the deciphered letter they were paired with. 
---
NukaCrypt works because the fact that the deciphered code must spell an 8 letter word drastically narrows down the possible keywords that will work (my understanding is the program randomly guesses keywords and tries them, looking for any word in the resultant deciphered letters).  Since theres a finite number of 8 letter words in the English language, and even less that would match the code pieces once deciphered with a possible keyword, they can narrow down the possible codes to a *relatively* small number and try them until one works. Though, this may be hundreds of possibilities. 
---
I've learned the plan, got one in the stash and I'm fine. If Bethesda would like to remove it from the game they would did it already.
---
So I just tested this with a L35 AA M79 Grenade launcher I had. Compared it to a L35 M79 grenade launcher I made for comparison.
---
Target was my alt account, 133 armor, 265 health. Using VATS to try and ensure consistant damage (due to AoE explosive effects)
---
The regular M79, at 263 damage (I have Adrenal Reaction) would take my alt down to roughly 2/3 health. The Anti-Armor one would show my alt at 66ish armor and would take my alt down to maybe 1/5 health. Adding in Stabilized to the Anti Armor resulted in a 1shot every time.
---
I only tested a couple shots with each setup, but it was the same results each time. 
---
So I would say yes, Stabilized and the AA legendary effect both work with Explosives.
---
I got erronously suspended because of overzealous anti-cheat systems a handful of times. I've been watched by mods a few times too, only to show, ta da, that nope, I'm 100% a-okay. Apparently something about my solo and farming/grinding play style likes to raise flags.
---
I will freely admit to cheating in single player, because come on, unleashing god mode on an unsuspecing game world is fun. But multiplayer is different. That's other people, it's like society. You can do all sorts of shenanigans in your own room in private- fart, fap, whatever, that you'd think twice (or ten times) before doing in public.
---
Furious Explosive Handmade
---
Kinda same thing happened to me. I was claiming  Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm only to do the packaged food to get a daily challenge done. A 140 comes up in stealth and contests so I doesn’t give him a bounty then kills me, takes my loot then runs off. I message him calling him a loser basically. Then he brings two of his friends over and makes them contest so I get out my mini nuke, kill them both but then he runs up and one shots me while I’m in power armor again. So I switch servers and he does the same and comes for me again. Had to wait a few hours to get away from them. Never claiming a workshop again. (Btw I was around your level too. I’ve never had a workshop being taken from me where I’ve had to fight someone around my level. And yes, there’s a level cap at 50 but it’s different when people have bloodied weapons and I didn’t even start getting good legendaries or even knew what some were)
---
Oh, didn't seen it yet.
---
How do you all take such awesome photos!? 
---
What platform that’s so cool would love to come see it would pay caps too
---
Yeah maybe they are going to add two things on sale every so often 
---
I'm pretty high level. What level are you? yeah we could run together a bit. Could be fun. Pm Me your gt 
---
This is so damn cool haha. Love it mate
---
Claiming workshop make you PvP, anyone can shoot you anywhere on the map. The above situation is why I completely forget about workshops - I only claim one if it's challenge (like that week in the abandoned bog town) then immediately leave the server. The time and resources spend to get anything from workshop is not worth it - I know where to look for each of resources and I'll farm them faster and without the risk being shot in the process. I'm 172 and I've never PvP'ed - it's broken, it's pointless, it's a waste of time.
---
As a firearm enthusiast in real life, I'd be PISSED if my gun "broke" after a few thousand rounds. I can drop that easily in one day. Most guns will go the course of their life time without any major repairs, especially if cleaned  on a regular basis. 
---
Man I still don’t know all the best legendaries I know a few by heart because they are the ones I desire on the weapons I use, and also the ones that always seem to drop when you kill a legendary. And don’t get me wrong I am totally ok with fighting someone around my level, not that it really matters once you get the max for stats, but for someone that is almost level 300 and for sure has the best stuff the game has to offer its kinds sad that they gotta hunt the low players.
---
He could have never had that in usable inventory, the system could simply have been tallying up his swaps between characters or pick ups, and a fraction of that amount would quickly add up. They didn't say he had it in inventory, they said he "acquired" it.
---
But if you can get a recipe for 5k, why would you pay the same amount for just a piece of Armor?
---
Legendary effects are not mods.
---
There is a lvl2? locked door at the Mothman Museum. When you pick it there will be a hole in the wall that has a staricase down to it.
---
I completley agree with you about your look on pvp, if people need caps so badly they have to resort to what Im bitching about above Ill just give them some because quite frankly it makes me have pity for them. Not like anything else is gained from pvp except for what 70 caps? Ive definitely learned my lesson and until they do something about it workshops are just a part of the game that I wont take part in. 
---
Well, like I said, I could one-shot most things before Bethesda nerfed the fuck out of my build. It's not unplayable, but unloading entire magazines into Super Mutants isn't very fun. Especially when guns break in a handful of magazines.
---
I think it's supposed to symbolize everyday being reclimation day
---
Doesn't really work for the story, vault dwellers leave a vault and within a day have slain the scorchbeast queen?
---
I died yesterday and didn't drop anything. Not even a marker. 
---
Legendary with instigating, 50% more crit damage and faster crit meter refill should do. Your build should combine vats and crits perks.
---
I hear what you're saying I don't agree with their story plot lol it's full of alot of holes
---
The only way I claim workshops these days is with a mule that is not in party with my main, has no junk and no caps.
---
Is a 'douchey' move but given that I know of no legitimate means to counter the above described behaviour I am comfortable with the general greyness of it.
---
I like an emote that shows vaultboy taking off his pants to show his butt.
---
what they've added recently?
---
I meant like made things on sale. Not anything new unfortunately. But the camo suit and the nuke plant is on sale now 
---
Given how the game is I wouldn’t consider it a douche move unless you are locking the place up and making it completley unaccessible, but if u just have a mule claim it and set everything up its basically just a glorified loot spot that generates events every now and then.
---
Dude, open mic comedy night would be lolz.
---
On xbox you can search a list called recent players. Maybe he followed you like that? Try and block his profile
---
Yeah and then we have to wait 20 hours from our first transaction. Crazy. At least have them carry more caps or down the time we have till it resets. 
---
I play on PlayStation. And it takes a few hours for that list to refresh on there. I already blocked him. Still just pissed me off. 
---
Some of the locations are bugged - I've finish the challenge by making photo in: Solomon ponds (on the small bridge), Grafton Dam, Summersville dam, Crevasse dam and Dried lakebed. Lake eloise, lake reynolds, twin lakes didn't register, no matter where I've tried to make photos.
---
Okay so, bit of advice since I learned the hard way; I was on Open Miner's Locker at Abandoned Mine 6, and all of the lockers were empty. After looking around for several minutes, I walked in a circle around the lockers and hit the action button to trigger the animation of "opening" the locker. Boom. Key removed, quest completed.
---
So you don’t have any other random friends added previously from other sessions for trade or during gameplay? The word friends doesn’t mean real friends. Just random people you added to your friend list before. It could even be someone you added in a different game and happen to be playing fallout too. 
---
I **really** wish there was something like backpack.tf, but I have no idea how hard it would be to do. 
---
Nope. Legit on my social there was one or two people. One was in my world. *the bud I was playing with* and the other wasn't even trying to join or anything. Also. Happy cake day. 
---
I don't expect anything new, just wandered what will be on sale - yesterday only craps and free apparel (ugly as f.., but free), maybe I'll spend some caps on camo paintjob for Combat Armor when it'll be on sale. Sitting on almost 5k atoms and don't anything interesting to spend it on - waiting for 4 horseman paintjob for PAs.
---
That’s one of the only things I want at this point 
---
I meant pistol type. I knew that much, I was wondering it 44s are better than 10mm, or if pipe pistols are the best
---
i try to be a raider but i always end up giving shit away to low levels lmao
---
Found this very entertaining! Great morning read while I'm stuck on a horrific train to London! Oh what I wouldn't do for a wooden leg right now!
---
Nope. The place and containers remain open. Not trying to obstruct anyone's gameplay and if someone passes by and wants some resources please be my guest.
---
Thanks. The other thing could be that for some reason when you served hopped you landed in the same server again which would be so much odd. 
---
I can only dream of finding a friend like that in these games.
---
But why are you being downvoted?
---
Based off of their roadmap description this is exactly what it sounds like 
---
Yeah. I dunno. It just confused me. Probably gonna take a break from the game for a while. 
---
10mm if you build sneak, 44 otherwise. They both have trade offs. 44 has the max oneshot potential but lacks a silencer. 10mm can get armor piercing mags, recon scopes, and a silencer, and if perked for stealth, can still one-headshot weaker enemies like ghouls and scorched. 
---
Carry both, learn which you like, and hunt for legendaries for the preferred one. 
---
My man
---
Probably because there are people in this thread that are blind to F76’s problems and can’t stand any criticism whatsoever? 
---
yeah its just one of the random encounters
---
How do you track specific ingredients?
---
The new version, yes. If you have new adrenal reaction and aren’t in a group/don’t equip Strange in Numbers, it works fine. 
---
In a group NEAR mutated teammates WITH SiN, Adrenal does nothing. In a group, FAR from mutated teammates, WITH SiN, it negatively affects your damage.
---
It’s really broken. 
---
Yes. They never had to consider the larger cascading effects of weapons and abilities when they were building a single player game.
---
Just stumbled by this post right now
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/av8fqv/no_more_server_hopping_no_more_ballistic_fibre/?st=JSMYBAKG&amp;sh=fc903556
---
Hm.. my friend was telling me something similar to that. 
---
That's been my go to strategy for the moment. Follow up question, when I'm dealing with high health enemies, woudl it be better to use a high damage weapon like a black powder pistol, or would DPS be better, like a 10mm
---
yeh it really is broken.thnx for the info
---
The problem is that this would basically tie the same 25 players together in a server right? So if I log in and it happens that none of my other 24 companions are online, what do I do then?
---
90%, same for everything else
---
ie weapons, armors..
---
Dang. I accidentally bought something the other day and lost 800 atoms. Rip. 
---
Not happening. Pretty much at reveal they told that cross-play aint happening for various reasons and it is not going to be on their plans. 
---
Oh well, still good.
---
I'd love to see this implemented via terminal.
---
Let players put their items up for sale and connect the upcoming vending machines to a terminal to sell across servers and maybe platforms.
---
Link?
---
Oh look, another poorly disguised post where someone just had to brag about winning a pvp fight with the assassins sentinels they bought. You must be so proud to pwn those noobs that have no idea about the unreasonably strong gear you "earned".

I can’t hoard anymore. Stash full, I’m full.  Maybe I can place all my steel and ballistic fiber about lol

Great idea!

Caps at 90% i think. IIRC i had lvl 3 packrat 75% reduction + 20% from my armor. I picked up a 160lb dumbbell and it weihed 16 pounds.
---
Yeah. The legendary effects work very well for PvE. Power armor is great in pve. Legendary weapons are fine in pve. Legendary armor is fine too. Rad resist legendary effects on armor could use a buff + a buff to lead lining. I'd like to see people who don't want to wear PA not be forced to wear hazmat. Would love to see a guy running around killing ghouls in full trapper armor. But PvP... Power armor is paper, legendary weapons tend to either 1 shot players or have a battle for 20-30 mins. Spamming diluted stimpaks is way too powerful in PvP. I am thinking about trying to organize an arena for PvP with no legendaries. Craft your weapons and armor before the battle, no stims. PA vs PA. As long as nobody has legendaries it'll be interesting I think. I also would like to organize at least one match of rock em sock em robots! (PA fist fight!) Idk what kind of stupid magic nonsense it'll take to make PvP work, but they'd better not be nerfing pve to do it.
---
That's still awesome :D
---
Oh yes! Who needs excavator armor :p
---
I read this after reading several other comments and wondered what Star Wars quote it was.... 
---
In hope they'll buy a bed or stash box lol 
---
No they didn't. I just played few days ago and all I did was server hoping for events and as it seems stupid I stopped playing after few hops. As I remember, what they did is they canceled containers spawning items if you already picked from that containers, so that you wont server hop to farm certain items.
---
...and yet here I am not picking up Ballistic fiber because it is just piling up in stash. Its probably your own inexperience that is costing you so much Ballistic Fiber.
---
I hope so too. They add so many items in the store it's a little overwhelming especially given the prices for a recolor a kid can make in photoshop in 15 minutes 
---
Oh no look at the salty loser. Another poorly disguised troll from reddit. Golly gee you type is sure hard to find. Go back to Twitter 
---
late at night, when all the vault dwellers and wasteland wanderers are sleeping...Phoenix drops nukes on Prime and solos the SBQ
---
So you bought assassins sentinels just so you can be a white knight and fight new players that couldn't possibly know about the sentinel effect? You continue to fit the stereotype that assassins sentinels only purpose is to greif. You said it yourself, the lv190 guy wouldn't fight you, so stop patting yourself on the back for winning the world's easiest fight. 
---
I claimed a workshop, then saw that the water purifier I built would produce 12 per HOUR. I barely play for an hour at a time! Give me some goodies when I claim the place and I might do it. Make me wait around and I’ll do something else, without the PvP risk. 
---
Drink serums.
---
This should be a feature. Sounds a lot more fun, than what we have right now.
---
Don’t really feel like spending that many caps. 
---
Or pond watee
---
Home Owner's Association you say?  Now I'm curious as I am quite proud of my house in the swamp, there's always wildlife right outside my door.
---
That's slow. It can take forever to get one, and you have to relog between each one or wait 30 minutes.
---
I was at post-Nukesprings when I saw a level 90 overwhelmed by glowing ghouls near the laundry area. I revived him and helped him clear out the ghouls. He emoted to follow him and he shot the ground. I noticed two stims in the bag and I thanked him. 
---
Later, I bought a 3* Sentinel arm off of a vendor. It was a good night. 
---
I feel kinda disappointed that it doesn’t look like the nuke from Megaton. 
---
Stand in an extremely radioactive area for a prolonged period of time until you are near-death. RadAway and Stimpak, then repeat until you're mutated. Note; RadAway and Rad-X have a high chance of removing mutations, so if you choose to gain them through radiation exposure, then be prepared for a health debuff.
---
Don't break your arm patting yourself on the back for having a full assassins sentinels set, we all know you didn't earn it and you only use it to win pvp against people who don't know better. You're a troll and shit like this is another example of the broken balance in this game. 
---
I've only launched one nuke. I died I don't know how many times working my way through the silo, but eventually I finally got through and launched. I targeted a fissure site, but not Prime- it was one on the edge of the Mire by the Savage Divide. I fast traveled to just outside the nuke zone, watched it land, ran in, started looking around... And found that a group of other players had already killed everything. I got a bunch of unstable flux that I then couldn't do anything with because the only other loot I got was a single hardened mass from one Scorched that everyone else apparently missed. So I sold as much of the flux as I could and the rest went bad.
---
Well then, you should clarify. Serums are the fastest and you control what you get. You can just irradiate yourself and get random ones. But you have to relog between each one, and it may not be one you like so you then have to remove random ones until it removes and try again. It can take hours/days to get the right ones without serums.
---
Standing near the radiation steam vents by the water park up north.  Set up camp near one..  Put your loot away in a stash. Get irradiate until you die.. Respawn at your camp rinse and repeat. Its a bit faster
---
Well everyone else that’s commenting got it but alright. Not everyone wants to spend that many caps. 
---
West tec there is toxic goo that does about 120 rads with each drink
---
If anyone wants serums and is on PS4 I got em 250 each I have most but missing scaly skin I believe 
---
Don't die. If you get one on death it will bug out and you will have to remove it.
---
the one time a red circle is needed. i would have thought that was a street light that spawned in with bad textures without it.
---
You asked fastest. I answered fastest. You then clarified cheapest. That's a completely different question. You can buy serums for 300-500 caps from players. For 10 mutations that's only 3000-5000 caps. For what you get in return that's a very small price to pay.
---
My pistol char has a quad ammo reduced weight explosive western which is beyond awesome, possibly the luckiest find I've had in game. Slapped a prime receiver on it as crimson flux is easy to farm. Single action's are fun but the reload time is a killer.
---
How rare is it to get a mutation from drinking it? 
---
Honestly the interloper really reminds me of the sentient terralysts in warframe. Just the tentacles and surfaces of the body though.
---
Bethesda considers the Marine Armor Helmet a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it:
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg
---
Is it a great game? Well it is for me. Sure it's flawed and it used to be much, MUCH worse. But BGS is working on it and they are heading in the right direction if you ask me. Was it broken at launch? Without any questions, but whats done is done and the important matter is that they are working hard on fixing it.
---
BoS/Forest camo-&gt;white powder-&gt;whitespring but it's dependable of of buyer/seller.
---
I really hope they will eventually restrict ALL PVP to survival mode one day.    In adventure mode, zero damage to other players, workshops are first come, first served, and not contestable. 
---
I was hoping that all the douche bags would migrate over to the survival servers when it comes out, but it won't happen unless PVP is all but killed in adventure mode.
---
You missed Comrade Chubs and Bumblebear.
---
Furious automtic + concentrated fire does insane dmg with easy multiple crits in a row
---
It must already increase. On a new user at level 50 I can just build all workshops and a small house. At level 196 I can do at least 4 times more 
---
It seems like some people really lay in wait until someone takes  a workshop to then fast travel and get that easy kill. It happened this week to me. 2 shots and I was down. It was a +300 level though.
---
Anyway what I wanted to say is that I was +/- 30% of the level of the guy who killed me with ease. There was just nothing I could do.
---
So I kinda expected the same when I encountered a dude +/- 30% of my level.
---
Like most workshops, ammo factory doesn't really seem to produce much.  I honestly feel like I get way more crafting with ammo with ammo smith and super duper 
---
Go to that mole miner camp next to the Whitesring resort, inside it has a decontamination arch and plenty of toxic water and barrels. You'll have to switch servers once you get mutation.
---
3 months late but I'm just now on that quest... there are no checkpoints in the cavern however, if you are high enough level or have enough stimpacks... just run through it to the end... I died at the end by throwing a grenade at a scorchbeast while it was attacking me with it's sonic cry... 2nd time I just ran through it to the end; found a dead end cave off to the left in the area of the beast; easy kill. The scorchbeast can't enter and stays in one spot just yelling at you.   
---
Not sure if it's always level 80 but my scorchbeast was. I solo'd it at level 73 pretty easily.
---
I'm in work, so can't check it, but if it's MaTN's one, I only partly agree with him (after almost 450h in the game and 172 lvl). Some of proposed changes won't, in my opinion, change anything towards re-interesting "quiters" and has only slight chance to interest "old Fallout veterans" - most require upside-down approach, which is very unlikely to be done by BGS. I admire the job he's done with this video, but most ideas, unfortunately, are unrealistic.
---
if i comprehend it correctly: resistanzes != mitigations, with resistances being balistic/energy/radiation resistances and mitigations being assassin, sentinel, zealot, etc.. Do they both affect berserker conditions the same way ingame? if yes, I believe it should be changed to what you wrote.
---
I also agree that berserker is indeed in need of way higher effect, a buff is needed, so they would have to change how damage scales with the resistances.  
---
and tbh bloodied related melees are redundant for 99% of the game, unless you need to delete the scorched beast queen in a few minutes, it is not a must, many people are like sheeps
---
No you dont have to blueprint the base if you just leave and if you change the camp location your current house and staff transforms to a blueprint automatically.
---
Went and checked real quick didnt cha lol
---
Other players and enemies can brake your house but i think they cant loot your stuff (or so i have understood it) like they will see their own stash box at every other stash
---
They said it because he was using a full assassins sentinels set against low-medium level players that likely have never even heard of that legendary effect and more likely haven't even heard about the reddit marketplace. OP is the bully using gear he shouldn't have against people who unfairly don't know about the sentinel effect.
---
What really bugs me is that OP's last post is saying 76 is "too hard a game". So I'm completely unsurprised he needed a full assassins sentinels set to win some pvp. What a loser. 
---
If your camp place is occupied the game will send you message like do you want to switch server. Ive never tried to stay so i dont know what happens if i do that
---
I’d recommend the Pharma Farmer perk
---
They can not steal your stash. They can access their stash via your box just as you can do to any you see in the wild. If they kill you, and you have any junk on you, they can steal it. If you die in the wild, you have a chance to get back to your dropped loot. Weapons are not dropped unless you drop them. 
---
And as far as i know 76 will just automatically select server to you 
---
You take like a zillion and pick one of them
---
It’s the reason why I don’t mess with settlements unless I’m with a group. Had some wanted asshole attack the munitions factory. He got me once and I got him twice. He was melting my health with a explosive and another legendary. Round two of this he goes stealth and I end up leaving after killing him. Didn’t want to waste 5.56 ammo and ran out of simpacks. It’s always some asshole with the best legendaries. 
---
For that look pick think i dont really know the answer lol i always keep my house doorless so other can go inside also lol. I hope that these little messages will help!
---
1.) No, your base packs itself up.
---
2.) No, your stash box will just act as their stash box, just like the ones you find in the world.
---
3.) You don't have to lock anything except for the resource extractors at the public workshops.
---
4.) Offline? No. Online? Yes. Although depending on where you set up camp, it can happen more or less often.
---
5.) Originally it would just pack your camp up as a blueprint, but now it gives you the option to either make a blueprint or move to a server where your camp can spawn.
---
6.) No, unfortunately.
---
Drink serum - easy, cheap and you got exactly ones you want. For an additional hour you even have no negative effects.
---
But then then what is the point of grabbing every piece of junk if its not to constantly repair stuff. If you dont need junk to repair weapons you dont have to loot which means you have more space for extra weapon. Its all connected. 
---
Yesterday I noticed it still gives you the quest "get the air drop" when someone drops one nearby. Game, stop trying to get me wanted! /frowny emote
---
Your booty.
---
Scorchbeast corpses are the funniest, I saw one that landed on it's head with it's ass about a foot from it's mouth, still have that pic and I always laugh when it comes up as a loading screen.
---
Where does the water flow out?  😉
---
The tactical low yield thermonuclear warheads portrayed in the game cover just a few kilometers. But because a nuclear payload weighs two to three times more than a chemical, biological, or conventional payload, the launch vehicle must be large. This is the same as IRL. 
---
The nukes in the game still have to ride on a SRBM (Short Range Ballistic Missile) to be launched. IRL as of 2018 the LGM-30G Minuteman III is the only nuclear-capable land based ICBM in the US arsenal. The US has no SRBMs in ground silos. SRBM are found on submarines, such as the UGM-133A Trident II. The Minuteman III weighs roughly 78,000 pounds, has a length of roughly 60 feet, and a diameter of roughly 5.5 feet. The game missile and IRL missile seem pretty close in size. 
---
The W78 reentry vehicle on the Minuteman III carries three separate warheads, although most people call the W78 a "warhead" by default. It reportedly weighs 700-800 pounds and each warhead yields 300-350 kilotons. 
---
So, as you can see, in the FO76 universe today's real life SRBMs and ICBMs have been combined into one vehicle. Therefore the need for a huge rocket to deliver a warhead that has a small blast radius. 
---
Nothing happens to your c.a.m.p while offline.  It simply disappears like your character does when you log off.  
---
And personally, I don't blueprint my c.a.m.p. mostly because it causes frustration when trying to move it to another location, due to variations in terrain.  
---
I responded to your comment about it being "weeks ago" and then you say "2 fecking months" as if there is a huge difference between the two.  
---
BTW 2 fecking months is just 8 fecking weeks ago :P   
---
I't not like I had any idea you quit the game 8 fecking weeks ago. 
---
Now, if it was 8 fecking months ago, that would be more understandable but your response still wouldn't be warranted.  Why respond with negativity when my first comment wasn't putting you down and other people could read it for info.
---
Hahaha 😂
---
Thanks for the replies guys, cant wait to get playing
---
just mix armor pieces. Power armor isn't very distinct when it comes to the legs. I use T60 legs on mine since the repair cost is cheap, but if you want something with comparable DR, go for T51 (it's actually higher than X01). Either one you can buy the calibrated shock plans easily.
---
Oh yeah, I've seen them before, but haven't collected them. Thanks
---
It's fairly easy with this. My hubby was going for Marsupial so drunk a few of this. Didn't take that many to get mutated (although he I'd go through a couple mutations he didn't want before he won the lottery!).
---
I got my first one very easy. I wandered into a nuke zone, no hazmat, no power armour, just dressed as normal. Just stayed at edge so I was taking loads of rads and ran out as soon as it went down to around 20 hp or something. Got speed demon (didn't realise until I took rad away. But repeated this the next day, same thing, got mutated - by the luck of atom got speed demon again). So that is another good way. 
---
Stinky meat....mmmmm....
---
It's like every other rad exposure most of the time you get one without having to clear your rads but sometimes you will have to fill up on rads a second time but I wouldn't consider it rare just remember if you want multiple you have to server hop and it is random which ones you get. I don't think and someone please correct me if I am wrong but serums are the only surefire way to get the mutations you want without a lot of luck and I don't mean the in game s.p.e.c.i.a.l luck I mean real life luck
---
Yeah its MaTN.  I agree that most of his suggestions are at the very least, hard as hell to implement/balance, and impossible in the games engine at most.  But as someone who loves Fallout and hasn't played 76 in quite a while because all the changes and bugs became tiresome, a lot of the suggestions he makes, particularly to nukes and camps/potential "towns", would immediately make me jump back in.  Really I just admired the video because he described almost exactly what my perfect version of F76 would be as well.  But who knows, the roadmap BGS released looks promising and hints at more RPG elements; depending on how long they support the game maybe they could pull a No Man's Sky and overhaul a good chunk of the core gameplay so we could actually, like, "rebuild America", like they told us to...
---
Higher level player caused them to spawn by loading that area of the map, but didn't kill them. 
---
Had it happen on my last move. My blueprint was stored twice for some reason, resulting in every part of the main structure being duplicated and having to be scrapped. 
---
Deases, no pls.
---
Neither. CAMP budget remains the same in perpetuity.
---
Some say it increases with levels
---
You didn't try to catch a ride?
---
Aw man. I recently launched my first nuke and fast travelled out of the silo to be there for the impact. Where exactly on the surface does it eject from?
---
Been advocating exactly this since I joined here. I'd love cross-server trading. I'd settle for cross-server COD orders though. 
---
And I'm telling you it doesn't. I'll see if I can find a video on YouTube to prove this point, but I know that (in the video) at the beginning, lowest level, you can build five turrets before maxing out your space. Then, at a far higher level, you can still only build five.
---
It doesn't increase, or it increases such a tiny amount that it has no practical value
---
They said it wasnt currently a priority (just before the release of the beta), but if player demand was high enough, they would look into it. They didnt feel it was a priority for players.  
---
Ill see if i can find the article.
---
I saw similar, but there he could build 10 turrets
---
You Sir or Ma'am have way too much time on your hands lol but seriously that is some dedication and yes most of it went over my head but you seem to know what your talking about. 
---
Peculiar. That seems like some wildly different numbers.
---
I took it inside the gas station at Flatwoods
---
I too have shared your experience. I was helping a player almost 20 levels lower than me. Built him weapons, helped him with quests that I already completed, shared supplies and junk. I was about a lvl 32 at the time.
---
I'm now a lvl 53 but he has advanced to a 50. He caught up because of some serious medical issues I've been dealing with that prevented me from getting on. So now he's returning the favor, giving me tricked out Marine armor, sending me PMs, and the like. 
---
When the days seem long dark for me, all of sudden I'll hear him on the headset or see his camp just north of mine. At that point, the world gets a little brighter and the day a little easier. So yeah...I'm glad you have found your friend through the game the same way I found mine. 
---
Thanks Ruste.
---
The guy know all fallout games back-and-forth and I feel deeply in the heart he want F76 to be F5, which it can't be. It's more like MMO FPS shooter in the fallout universe, without real plot, without multi-choice quests and other elements that I'd love to see, but are almost impossible to implement in MMO game. With few exceptions, most quests are dull and most locations have wasted potential to tell the interesting stories - they're just there, no strings attached. I really love the idea to place the adventure mode few years before, when most NPC were still alive and we can choose faction, be in the middle of the plot that resulted in the situation we have now, no PVP, no other players, just old-style Fallout (we can be someone who secretly left Vault76, with appropriate quest at the beginning). That would be awesome to have some impact on the world, to feel that our decisions matter. But it's only my wishes, no chance to implement.
---
You make a good point, but I’m not asking for realism, just for my guns not to break quite as fast. 
---
we need this so bad. that or towns we can take over and leave open plots for friends or randoms
---
Oh I see, so provided they despawn before I get there I'd be okay? 
---
You can build even a million turrets this way, but in order to do that, you first need your base to duplicate in stored, then you need to scrap stored duplicated blueprints and then you have to build a new base that is without any cables.
---
The additional benefit of doing that is that your servers will cease to work, you'll be kicked out all the time, and your loot will lag when spawning.
---
Other than this way, there is no possibility of going above that small number of turrets.
---
Endgame bases have no turrets whatsoever.
---
Agreed. Crap reward, convoluted structure, cluttered insides, high level defend events, slow to get to unless you already own it...  need I go on?
---
I had no idea they were rare, but apparently they are! I got my fatigues from a random person months ago for just 60 caps.
---
&gt;Why respond with negativity when my first comment wasn't putting you down and other people could read it for info.
---
My apologies friendly stranger. My intentions were not to be rude or aggressive. I projected frustration &amp;/or resentment regarding this game I wasn't aware of. 
---
If workshops are first come, first serve then there'd have to be a time limit on them to keep people from claiming it and just staying active enough to continue farming it out. Having it be contestable prevents this. 
---
Fix:  give turrets some better teeth. Most I've encountered can't even scratch the camo paint off my power armor. They're zero threat, and I'm generally running around at 9% health. 
---
Then I might have gotten duped gulch without me noticing... well that’s not fun xD
---
But I think budget should either increase or turrets take less space
---
Well, if there was a craftable repair kit, you’d still need just as much junk to make that as to repair your weapon straight up. Think of it as pre-fixing your weapons. And, like I said, they could weigh a pound or two, whatever the accumulation of all the junk they’re comprised of would weigh.
---
Nice. 
---
Old post, but relevant concerning how Nuke codes are up within (usually) minutes of server reset.

---
I think turrets should take zero budget and instead occupy turret slots. They should also be upgradeable.
---
This duplication bug happened to me about 10 times total. I am, however, finding a lot of pleasure from building sophisticated electrical circuits, so it was never advantage for me - I couldn't place more turrets because I haven't had any in the first place, and I had to scrap all the abundant items so I could place wires.
---
Last night, I joined a queen fight a bit late. There were only 6 people so I though we can make it (10+ is usually impossible). She flew out of range a couple of times, came back invisible (to me at least), then her HP skyrocketed and we couldn't make a dent. I think somebody got unluky and got a half-dozen Major Gutsies spawning on him at V9, which probably counted as enemy fraction for the queen, hence the HP scaling.
---
Wires should take 0 space
---
Well, it aint priority for players, so it aint happening either way.
---
Hey just saw this idk if you're on now but I'll be around tomorrow. 
---
the one it's in the game is steel (on the outside), there is no others than ones in the Roofs tab in the CAMP building menu.
---
BRING BACK BLACKBIRD!!!

---
I understand your point of view, and I absolutely think the argument of realism in games is redundant. But, I feel like when it comes to calibers and ammo, Atleast some degree of realism is required. Regardless of receivers the .50 caliber should always do more damage than a .308. It just doesn’t really make sense. It’s more of a nitpick than anything, but I do find it somewhat irritating when things like this are done in games.
---
They should add more different types of roofs in materials, not only steel ones
---
Dude Id get 20% bonus budget 
---
It's happened to me a few times, and I thought it was funny at first.
---
IIRC, it was supposed to be fixed...? ...but I still had some items duplicated when I moved my camp earlier. Luckily my previous camp was a bit more spread out, so it only duped a tiny blueprint of my water purifiers+rugs.
---
Level 17 is a lil low to be on rose missions. Her areas can get pretty rough. Try exploring  in the toxic valley for awhile before go in there. The savage divide scales up to whoever was in area last. So ya prob went in after a higher level was doing an event or something. 
---
It is for some of us.
---
Thats what was said about fortnite, minecraft, and rocket league. 
---
Granted, they're 3 of the biggest player pools. And they're produced by like real developers working in engines from this century. But still, entirely possible.
---
They won’t dispawn, they will be high level till you kill them all or someone kills them, but if higher level is there still they will keep spawning as level 50-60+
---
Like seriously, this is the least complicated CAMP I built in a while:

---
I'd like to see any kind of under-armor that actually works in PA. I still don't understand why you can only use PA naked.
---
Well damn. I'm hoping for private servers now. 
---
Much higher level enemies are usually out there because monster level in some areas scale with players who are/were there. Change server and try again - if no higher level player were there already, monster should be your or few level above your level.
---
So if selling reinforces getting it again does looking but not picking the item up, say it's a 1* off a 3* enemy or a wood piece off any enemy, change the effects?
---
I got lucky once, I got a white spring completely empty, when I biked it only players were there was me and my friend
---
As long as it is it's own game mode with seperate server instances and doesn't glitch over to the 'adventure' mode, I don't really care.
---
And it might lead to less undesirables running around in adventure mode :)
---
I only ask because I personally have been wondering this. Frankly it sucks that more often than not a 3* enemy with their rarity do not drop 3* items. At least in my case. 
---
Awesome! That's killer! So much sweet loot. 
---
Thanks for telling me just wanting to make sure that it is ok
---
Pretty damn cool!
---
So long as everyone else can hear it, I'm still bummed that nobody else can hear ke ring the bells I find when I ring them 20+ times randomly during conversations if we stop at them, I'm not trying to speed people up, just annoy them.

Not explosive, but incendiary, yes. Those turrets in Harper's Ferry have them.

While I agree, because I don't bother fighting them either... If the loot becomes too good then farming them at fissure sites becomes the norm..

It's a fine balance.

---
That was a chinese bomb, tho

I stopped selling 1\*-2\* in the last 50 drops or so, but that's too few items to reason about the effect just know. It happened before the logs that I sold my rare Quad drops and within a hour, I got the same item type drop again with Quad, which is very unlikely based on uniform chance. I'll see if the next 200 drops shows any such effect.
---
What have I been doing with my life?  Seeing this, it all seems so meaningless now...
---
Yeah a full set of unyielding sentinel armor can go upwards of 35k depending on the third stat and type. So no offense,  I just think you haven’t experienced trading enough to understand the need for more caps. 
---
i hope they fix it when they buff energy weapons i have a nice rifle just dont use it cause its pretty shit and not worth wasting the fusion cells ;(
---
I don't think your proposal is drastic. I'm running in a godly gear and I am mostly hunting other gods. There is no god-build that uses berserker. Well, there are no good-builds that would use it either.
---
I believe that 0DR characters should receive around 500% damage boost instead of the current measly 50%, because if they do, Berserker builds will become interesting and exoting thing you sometimes spot in the game, instead of being the only weapon prefix modification that can compete against exterminator for the title of most useless prefix in the game.
---
Ive had it duplicate 8 times before, no joke I had over 250 foundations and walls and I could place them all. Made a huge base but didn’t have enough furnishings lol and it took me like 10 min to scrap all the excess foundations to where I could build again. 
---
Hopefully they fix this bug but maybe prioritize others first because I can live with extra building materials. I don’t move around a lot tho so might be annoying if I did. 
---
Please don't nuke Lucky Hole Mine; my camp is located just above it!
---
As for the Wood, the fastest way to check the hypothesis is to not sell it and not drop it into a paper bag either. Place it in a world container and leave it there.
---
Yeah I love grinding and exploring! I'm 80 hours in and still only level 21 because I keep getting sidetracked and exploring different areas :D 
---
Interesting. I'm curious if skipping actually picking the items up changes the pool any. For me anyway it seems like things hit in waves. I'll go x amount of levels and drops without anything decent and then get 4 or 5 decent items fairly close together. Also, I have noticed that if an area, and any area at that, has been nuked on the server and the nuke zone is still active the drops and appearance of 3* enemies seem to be better. 
---
Yes, AMS Headquarters has those too. They were annoying until I equipped Fireproof.
---
I agree with everything you said, I did hear that one of the new vaults which will be like a raid for higher lvls will have lots of mirelurks so that exterminator prefix might actually be useful there, otherwise it’s basically just taking up space 
---
Best laugh I've had all night. Thanks for sharing.
---
It is kinda rare just leave that world and try another. I get that a lot at the junk yards. 
---
Did he give you a 2 shot rifle? ;)
---
Yea I'll try to do some testing too. I probably wont make a chart like this but I'll try not picking stuff up and see what happens. See if it makes the loot system "rethink" the item or prefix as unwanted and switch it up. 
---
Actually kind of funny you mentioned you seem to get certain items more. I was telling a buddy a while back that I seem to get drops related to what weapon or armor I am currently wearing. Not 100% obviously but at a higher rate than normal. Now however, it seems to have flipped that hypothesis on its head and reared the RNG dragon in my face. 
---
Seems possible, maybe everyone is going to have to star fighting her in the nuke zone again.
---
I would pay to see that, Protectrons are my favorite bots and Phoenix actually was a big help yesterday when I was in Watoga because Gutsy's kept spawning, probably fought around 20 without my teammate there through most of it.  Phoenix is best boi.
---
West Tek has them too. 
---
&gt; I'm curious if skipping actually picking the items up changes the pool any. 
---
In the frenzy, especially in Whitesprings, I pick everything up and sort them later, mostly because of despawn risk.
---
[This evaluation table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz0Hej1N5UOeXGvXKiq6h9N-utjWjhiFdqXLvfDwu8/edit#gid=717308889) indicates 2\* are more likely but 3\* are less when nuked. However, the sample counts are not in balance.
---
Yeah, I just prefer that design
---
Unfortunately they will spawn at the equivalent lvl of a player who has spawned there previously, nut there are solutions that may help. You know the little pool area to left of the golf club (if you are standing in carpark and facing entrance)? Well you can jump on the little outcropping behind the truck there and onto the bush then up onto the wall where, although some of the spawn may have a little jog around session while youre up there, you can pick them off with grenades and a nice automatic. The runners you can gather back to yourself by jumping down and running around in the car park to train them up then jump back on your perch 👍 
---
Also you can lay a few mines outside the doors and keep them shut until youre ready to take down the horde. If you feel brave you can also use the tennis court for a good skirmishing as the net seems to confuse them and they keep trying to run at you through it, some will also try to keep getting you through the fence so you can pew pew them without being exposed to danger. Hope you can use one or all of these next time you get in a sticky spot ☺
---
Nah, all the contextual monster oriented weapon prefix are terrible, and all of them should be boosted by at least 100% IMO (25% -&gt;50%), and 300% I do believe to be reasonable. Having each type of PvE prefix weapon should be a valid tactic for powergaming. Its absolutely irrelevant now. The only PvE prefix that should be doubled (or quintiplied) in power is mutant killer, because it shouldn't be PvE only, it should also work on PvP and give damage bonus against mutated players. Or be renamed super mutant killer FFS.
---
Even if the raids will be consisting of ten thousand mirelurk queens, the exterminator is still so weak that you'll get much more damage output with bloodied, antiarmor and two-shot that having a mirelurk oriented weapon will still be irrelevant.
---
Just let us forfeit an owned workshop.  When you click on it, under the "fast travel" option should be something that says "forfeit" or "concede", have a little are you sure box pop up, and the workshop becomes unowned.
---
I made a base next to a silo and we have it on livestream where I’ve watched nukes launch, months ago....
---
Truu, I’d be down for this buff. Maybe the mutants slayer would scale based on how many mutations a player has. Also maybe make those the third stat. You could have an OP PvE gun. Bloodied explosive exterminator that would be nice 
---
There is definitely something going on with her. Sometimes the guys I roll with can take her down no problem with minimum ammo, max 6-8 people, but other times with the same group/weapons/perks she just doesnt take any damage. It is absolutely maddening. 
---
The real problem is that the game never explains to you how PvP works...  
---
People claiming Workshops don't know what they are signing for.  
---
And yet the poor devs have spent so much of their precious time killing dupers rather than being able to fix the game,  develop new content etc. Etc. Etc...
---
Yep some stuff is still buggy but hey,  when 90% of your day is devoted to killing off duplication because there was a dishonest % of players out there. Is it really unacceptable, maybe if they didn't have to waste time elsewhere. I think it's unacceptable that the devs have had to spend so much time on dupers dishonesty. 
---
Not that im calling you a duper btw.
---
Safer deployment of nuclear materials?  You \*do\* know the story behind the mini-nukes right?  From that camp in FO4???
---
I have the same question and none of these answers even addressed it. Bummer.
---
Maybe but then it’ll just be a case of Bethesda playing wack-a-mole like how blizzard deals with WoW private servers. Anyway if your dead set I wish you luck, the division 2 is coming out in March and I’ll be playing that, I’ll pop back in a few months to see what progress BGS has made and to wait out the bugs fixes that the division is sure to have, I hope by that time they’ve learnt a different working culture but I won’t hold my breath. 
---
I agree, when I first played and claimed workshops I was never attacked anywhere other than at the workshop, and nowhere does it say that if you aren’t at the workshop being attacked that you can be hunted down and killed if someone wants to contest it. And also there should be a pvp warning that pops up if there is someone near you that can inflict damage on you instead of just getting 1 shot by someone out of nowhere and not knowing until its to late.
---
This is by far the most reliable spot. If there isnt tech data in the desk leave whatever is in there and server hop. If you take anything from the desk you will have to wait for that specific container to reload for you. 
---
Generally though there are at least 4-5 desks with tech data in them. Take one at a time, delivering more than one will only net you 20 more caps, the random reward doesn't get better by handing in multiples.
---
Wait, rad-x doesn't disable mutations anymore? When did this happen?
---
No Nukes! No Nukes! 
---
Don't even get me started on the repair costs :D
---
That's amazing thank you. Now i can go thin the herds and level up in relative safety
---
This is why I don't pay attention to reviews most of the time. There are some issues in game sure, but overall I enjoy it, as a casual gamer I don't get wrapped up in the drama that seems to follow certain game lines. There seems to be some who dislike a developer and will crtique the hell out of any game they make which kills the joy of it. I'm not defending Bathesda by any means, just saying I don't set expectations for any games or fault a game developer for not creating the game how I thought it should of been, if it looks fun I'll try it, if I like it keep playing, if I don't move on.
---
The reason why I have floor tiles over my head and I just pretend it’s a roof 
---
Man. Earlier today, I provided a level 4 &amp; his 30-something friend with a handful of stimpacks and a legendary the 30+ might have found useful. They proceeded to follow me around shooting and meleeing me. The 4 was no problem, obviously, but the 30+ tried to take advantage of the ghouls on my ass and swung on me when I was close to dead.
---
I don't expect anything in return*, really, but I also don't expect *that* to happen.
---
^^*but ^^a ^^thumbs ^^up ^^after ^^you've ^^inspected ^^the ^^bag ^^is ^^nice ^^though
---
Why shouldn’t he have that gear?
---
I  quit the quest as soon as I see my workshop is being contested and then block the contester for that session.
---
I've only ever seen one team trying to grief me but they were a level 2 and a level 30, the Lv 2 was shooting up my camp, hoping I would engage and I think the lvl 30 was waiting for me to take the bait. or they wanted me to jump server so they could build on my junk pile. either way I fast travelled away, and then blocked them both.    
---
Fail.  Now you'll have to try to get it to 760.
---
These are two excellent ideas
---
I’ve been waiting to see someone do this! Awesome photo :D
---
Not sure when, but log in and test it. I did tonight and it no longer disables mutations, nor does it say it will in the item description.
---
Go to Willard Corporate housing, stand in the nearby radiation vent until you die, see if you got a mutation, respawn right next to said vent, server hop (because there's a timer on getting mutations but it's server specific), rinse, repeat
---
Woah.  It came back off the side of a cliff???  Well I have nothing on that.
---
Only thing I can think of is they programmed them to disperse in a 2D circle from the target.   So you point to a specific target are it generates a radius from the angle and target outward.    The upper edge of the angled invisible circle might be above the cliff and thus when it distributed the explosives, they ended up on top of the cliff again?
---
A solution to this if thats how its being done is always make the circle horizontal (every time) regardless of the angle it was shot at?   
---
But this is all conjecture and I have no real clue how they are being done except for the fact that its causing a problem.
---
Portable scrapping is to OP IMO.
---
That's three days worth of caps
---
Well, I personally pretend I didn’t spend 60 bucks on a broken game that somehow breaks more and more every moment and photoshop. 
---
you can quit the event if someones contesting it, look at your active events in your pipboy, highlight the workshop one and I think you can quit or forget the event.  
---
First I’ve heard of this actually. I’ve been selling all my Rad-X and just using Radaway because of it.
---
I live off SB meat. They're not hard to kill with the right setup, for instance a heavy gunner (me) can shoot them out of the sky. With the Fireproof perk you take less damage from the SB.  
---
I would also like better loot but I've gotten plans, hand mades, and lever actions. 
---
Took me a minute to figur it out :D
---
Hilarious!
---
Agreed, roof budget prices are ridiculous. 
---
Because trading for gear on reddit is just feeding the dupers. he said he's worn the set literally once, meaning he bought it all and it's been sitting in his stash. And how does he use the gear? Against newbies who don't even know about the sentinel effect and think he's cheating. Literally every single person with full assassins sentinels does this, they use the broken stats on that gear to trick low level players into dying repeatedly as they scramble to figure out why this dude is taking no damage. The way people use assassins sentinels proves that the set is overpowered and should be nerfed. If you think 2se derived the nerf it got, I can't see how you would tolerate the overwhelming stats of assassins sentinels, especially against a player who hasn't heard of it. 
---
Yes, the whole enemy populations in 76 are far different than those in FO4.  I think they tried to make it more diverse and different from FO4 so its not the same game with MP added to it.  I assume the devs actually wanted a "new" game and not the same feel as F04.
---
I think they needed more variety of scorched and much more info about the scorched.   It all seems to be a lot of small disconnected stories up until you get to the brotherhood quest line.   By then, it seems anticlimatic.  This is what happened and boom.  Thats it.   
---
You really only get one side of the story. 
---
I think they should have kept out some of the creatures prelevant in the mire in exchange for more varieties of the scorched.    Because I would like to see a main boss for the mire (think of a mire SBQ) with all these new creatures as part of a free DLC added later, developed with more story/plots behind them.   Not just as extra mobs thrown in the game.
---
Many of the people play fallout for the story/lore as well as the collect-items character-progression part of the game.   Many here just on reddit could tell you the history behind the different factions of the brotherhood, or the institute or NCR.   Right there you can tell there is interest in the canon of fallout.
---
TSE tend to break quicker, do you keep gunsmith equipped? Is it repaired to 200%? It shouldn't break from fighting one SB.
---
Thanks, I will check into it.  I am more a casual gamer, not a hardcore one.  Not sure if there is a huge populations of casuals, but I will check it out.
---
And glassed caverns have bodies of those turrets deployed there by BoS knights, so BoS could place their turrets whenever they wanted, and so we should definitely be able to do the fucking same.
---
My pleasure, good luck
---
If the other player had his audio set to team chat only, he won't hear area chat. Conversely, if they are set to area chat and you are set to team (even if you aren't in a team) they won't hear you. 
---
You both must be set to area if you are teamed. If you are not teamed, you can set it to area or auto. BGS needs to make switching between area and team chat easier. Currently I just open a PSN party with my teammates and keep game chat set to area and use the PS pop up menu to switch between party and game chat because it's much faster than bungling through a bunch of menu screens in game. 
---
I wanna ride it like in "Dr Strangelove" 😂😂😂 yeeyeee 
---
I’m in the same boat with the whole “think I have a problem” thing.
---
I wouldn’t say I’m necessarily spending too long on it, but I have logged on every single day since release without exception.
---
It’s been a very long time since a game has got it’s hooks into me like this.
---
Good news is that this was already shared here and the CMs watched this
---
Yeah, you aren’t wrong there. I got no problem being wrong. I’ve been holding off on getting deep into training on discord and stuff. It’s my own personal choice and I know I’m just missing out. But arranging a deal using a third party and then needing to actually do the deal in-game just seems like a hassle. Even though I know it’s probably not at all.
---
Good information! Too bad it isn't more freely available...
---
Glad to help. Love camp building.
---
I have the T51b full set with both shocks, but not the jetpack.  Could not get the jetpack on any of my PA.  But I got shocks for almost all of mine. (Excavator, X01, t51b) I am missing the ultracite calibrated shocks.
---
Anyways, the T51b has the extra benefit of the nuka-cola paints which are pretty easy to get.   So I would consider it worth getting the T51b for.  Its a great PA for doing all the daily stuff and quests... Just need to get in something else for the nuke zones.  The T51b can handle just about all the other radiation areas fine.
---
its a fcking giraffe dog
---
ugh this is maddening keeping track of all this stuff
---
at least document it in the descriptive text!
---
&gt; If you want realism might as well get rid of all the fictional weapons in the game
---
Everybody wants *some* realism though, unless you're playing something totally abstract like Tetris.  The only real questions are, how much realism do you like, and which parts do you prefer to focus your realism on.  It's perfectly valid for someone to suggest that they would like the weapon damage numbers to be more realistic while accepting patently unrealistic things like the stash system or atom shop.
---
In terms of raw damage per shot, western revolver probably has the highest damage,  but then again, it is quite rare, at least to me, so it might be difficult to unlock mods
---
I’m a single mother also with depression.
---
I think it’s one of the main things that keeps me coming back.
---
I’ve always found it laughable when people complain that they have no-one to play with as their irl friends ditched the game.
---
This game has MADE friends for me. There is now a small group of people that I talk to on practically a daily basis and I absolutely love it. It’s rare I get out these days, so being able to have “adult” conversation whilst playing a game I enjoy is an absolute godsend.
---
I just wish they all lived closer so I could meet them in real life.
---
No, I understand. And agree. They have plans they could only implement after getting the cheaters under control. I'm hoping this helps them fix things. I don't want to see the game fail.
---
My apologies.
---
Even easier is the side of the clubhouse with the truck, stay against the wall of the clubhouse and go up into the shrubs. There is a window in the back you can shoot into the clubhouse from. Very rare one will make it through the window. Very safe way to level when your low. 
---
There isn't a mechanism for cleaning and maintaining weapons in the Fallout 76 game though.  I legitimately don't know, so can you tell me please, how would a gun's functioning be affected if it was *never* cleaned or maintained in any way?
---
I'd be interested to try out a weapon *maintenance* game mechanic in place of a weapon *repair* mechanic, tbh.
---
So if I take the ballistic fibre in a location, I can't see it there also if I change server? The object spawn for other players and I can't see or what?
---
I loved runescape. I loved its economy. I ceased playing after they implemented Grand Exchange because it completely killed my playstyle that was based on 'find somebody in needs of caps with a collectible item to sell, buy it, then find someone looking for that particular collectibe item and get a profit'. With grand exchange, I couldn't do that anymore, I could only sell as high as game allowed me and buy as low as it allowed people to sell. It killed this game for me.
---
Repair kits are good idea. Actually we should be able to craft them on weapon workshop station.
---
And it was dropped from a plane.
---
Unrelated but making a quip about Welsh sheep shagging is a like in my book. 
---
Yes let me know too please
---
Seriously. I don’t get the fascination with the munitions factory whatsoever.
---
I can make a metric shit ton of Ammo using Ammo smith and Super Duper.
---
To the point I’m usually the one who makes my friends ammo as it’s just easier.
---
Uhh. Well the biggest two things that happen are going to be premature wear and jams. Premature wear is a long term problem. There's a lot of metal on metal parts that rely on the lubrication. Without it they will wear on each other more than designed, the tolerances will go out of spec. But you're talking about an guns life span maybe being 100,000 plus rounds down to maybe 50k? I really don't know. Most gun owners that shoot often take amazing care of their firearms bc theyre tools and not cheap.  On a short term you'll definitely see jams. Failures to eject or load a round. That can happen as early as 500-1000 rounds with no cleaning. If you ever played GoW, if you missed the reload bar the gun would jam. 
---
That would be a cool way to do that faction war thing that everybody wants. And it would be semi-lore friendly. If they do allow us up in the Pitt that would cool to see the Brotherhood roll through, little  bit of Fortunate Son playing overhead. 
---
If I remember right thats one of the reasons part of the Brotherhood split into the Outcasts right? Along with the tech usage disputes.  
---
I think maybe he was talking about BGS not mentioning it in the last patch notes. 
---
He found the silo’s launch door, and went there after we finished launch prep. The rest of us held off on pushing the big red button until he said he was in a good spot. We got lucky with the dusk/dawn timing.
---
I also should point out this is attempt number 2. First one, he was too close to the door and only got exhaust smoke as his screen shot.
---
You don't need to buy it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jisDpRd1Txc
---
lol I was talking about item descriptions sorry not mad at you bro!
---
I personally would love this emote too 😁 
---
Also what platform are you on? I’ll be on after my coffee if you want a hand getting some xp.  I’m on PS4. 
---
Or go kill the sentry bots at the whitesprings if you're trigger happy
---
this is a known thing
---
they're trying to fix it, I think it's in the patch notes for next patch
---
That sounds like a workable game mechanic to me then.  Collect junk, turn them into cleaning kits.  Use them regularly, or your gun jams, which can be dealt with quicker than a broken weapon, but still offers generally the same impact in the short term, which is what matters when you're in combat after all.
---
When a player...any player enters an area the monsters spawn. In many areas they spawn based on the player level. If someone entered an area before you then it will spawn near their level until it is cleared again. 
---
If you change servers you can find a freshly spawned area that you spawned and is appropriate for your level
---
I’d even be happy if it was set so that the caps refreshed at midnight. 
---
There’s been too many times I’ve forgotten to do my trading until fairly late in the day, and then end up with the issue that I then can’t trade until late in the day again the next day and so on.
---
Nice one, I feel the same, still happy I ignored the reviews and bought it anyway. Lvl 24 now. Looking at individual parts of the game they can be definitely be named boring, but I think it's the amount of different stuff you can do that makes it such a fun game. Bored of building your CAMP? Go explore. Bored of that? Trade some stuff, find some plans, do some quests, modify some equipment, meet some other Vault dwellers (which is definitely a nice aspect compared to FO4). Even with the bugs and PS3-like looking graphics it still feels refreshing. 
---
It's probably the feeling of being able to do whatever you want that I like.. rather than having to run forward, guns blazing, over and over again in another Team Deathmatch game. 
---
You need a lot more than 143 items for this to make sense. Let me know when you hit 1000 :-)
---
If we get peivate servers and a lobby to browse them, then Permanent dwellings could be a thing but as the game plays now it wouldn't work unfortunately.  Hey definitely need to make the distance between CAMPs smaller though
---
I’ve seen him a couple times. 
---
I’ve wondered whether he’s a ditched event. The fact he screams for help to get them safely to a farm is what makes me think this.
---
It seems like an escort event that might have been dropped for being too similar to Mr Messenger.
---
Which is a shame. Because when I found him I really wanted to help!
---
Yup. They were a thing back in Fallout 4. There are also incendiary variants too
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/zaUgcYw

This could totally work. A Guild-CAMP or whatever you want to call it could even require they donate their camp to a 'camp leader' and for each donated camp, up to like 20, the budget would gain +100% and the build radius would increase by like 10% (this would be a lot since we are talking radii). Then each player when they log will always join an existing server that the Guild-CAMP is on, or if it isn't or that server is full, they go to a different server.
---
The only way to change servers is to Remove yourself in the Social menu. (right-click your name)
---
From what I’ve heard there are some Scorchbeasts in the Forest region that don’t actually attack, and are just there to freak out the new players 😂
---
Nice screen shot
---
Is an energy weapon buff confirmed by Bethesda?
---
NO BLASTERS!!!  NO BLASTERS!!!!
---
Message received! ;)
---
Yeah I just realized that switching server or blocking the player doesn't make the game server to put both players on different server. It's just that you are hidden from their map. If they block you, you can't see their location either. But you can still meet them in the world (if both of you being placed in the same world server)
---
not that i know of but atleast the durability of them should be fix but im sure they will buff them aswell as many people have complained about it plus they are pretty shit compared to anything else
---
If you choose right you get a fair amount of scrap. Worth a punt.
---
This is great. I'm so down for next time! 
---
With all due respect - I don't think BGS would've gotten their act together to release a proper roadmap if it weren't for the playerbase vigorously demanding it. If critics and players alike hadn't been roasting the game since day one, not much would've changed. Stash limit would still be 400, plan availability would still be RNG, duping would still be rampart and countless bugs would still remain unfixed/unnoticed.
---
So... yeah, sure, kudos to BGS for not totally ignoring the myriads of people who really want to like this game and see it succeed. BUT I wouldn't go as far as to call what BGS is doing commitment to create something really special and awesome. It feels more like PR and damage containment for the purpose of generating revenue with the least possible effort. Sorry to say...
---
This is strange and I don't know if it's happened to anyone else but on one occasion I killed a level 60 scorch beast in the savage divide and I got an ultra site power armor plan, I think it was for the explosive vents, off of it when I looted the corpse. That's the only time it's ever happened most of the time it's just random stuff I scrap but as this happened to anyone else?  It was in between the last 2 patches 
---
If you have stimpak perks and slam a superstim, it can make your health regen fast enough that other people might think you aren't taking damage from smaller hits, such as from a combat rifle.
---
I like that idea, fibre optics, cloth and other materials I bulk and sell and sometimes just dump hundreds at a time they are so plentiful, using combinations of materials to produce rare mats would be a good use of my crafting skills.
---
I understand now, thanks everyone!
---
I don’t think that weapon degradation should happen as fast as it does, if I shoot 50 rounds through a Handmade it shouldn’t fall apart in my hands until at least 2500 rounds has gone through it. 
---
I'm on xbox, but I appreciate it! 
---
They need to separate camp defense budget from everything else. I shouldn’t have to choose between a turret and placing about 20 items.
---
I was literally thinking the same thing. Kind of botched the economy though over the years. 
---
You can find people selling mutation serums for 200-300 caps, avoid TSE damage via dense chest mod and fireproof perk. There ya go.
---
I played pistolero and I am yet to find a gun that could do better work than Western Revolver. I couldn't do so in my journey. I also realized that quad harpoon gun without any related perks is infinitely more effective than full pistolero build with the best possible pistol.
---
'You just havent found a decent roll' will not work for me, since I have the means to purchase pretty much any weapon, as my 'for trade' items collection now include all the fancy combinations (TSE, AAE, BE, TSVatsdmg, AAVatsdmg, BVatsdmg, assasin/sentinel,  assasin/cavalier, unyielding sentinel, chameleon cavalier aprefresh etc etc).
---
People never use them so I would hope so.
---
Thanks buddy .. 
---
Maybe, I'm an older player (age irl) being level 168 does not compensate for old eyes and reflexes. I do try to play smart but still have to repair armor often, it's just more difficult now and tedious having to always be searching for BF.
---
In that case it would try to match you to a different server. That and in the idea it would be optional. 
---
I really hope this isn't just an Easter egg and they plan on doing something with it in the future. Have you seen those data mined power armor skins about the 4 horsemen of the Apocalypse? In my head I'm envisioning that those have something to do with that cthullu monster
---
Furious is not bugged anymore? Its damage is raised beyond the 2nd hit? My furious swing speed ripper I've been saving for the glorious day they'd fix furious just become godtier?
---
Team up with a higher level. You just need to hit em once to get the Xp and loot. I try to run anyone I can through there. Just accept team invites. 
---
Cool as long as they give it good loot. Unlike the disappointed you get after killing the flatwoods monster.
---
Definitely. All you would need is a cloth and oil (which is all a real life cleaning kit is). You could even introduce a simple mechanic like once the "clean level" drops below say 30% the chance for a jam starts to increase. It increases more the lower the cleaning level gets. Iirc didn't guns jam in FO4 or NV? I feel like seeing my character reload and then smack the gun once or twice here and there. It's not much, just a 2-3 second delay. Which could be life or death in certain fights. 
---
Giant boombox ?
---
Yeah, I just learned from this week's challenge to capture the bog town workshop. That BLOCKING someone doesn't mean that both players wont be placed in the same world server. Blocking just make you hidden from their map, same goes to you if they blocked you; you wont be able to see their location.
---
Even after switching server, the game server can put you in the same world with the people you've blocked. 
---
Hahah thanks ive been waiting for someone to appreciate that
---
Outside? No, you just get blinded by the exhaust smoke.
---
Recently if I enter a server even days after last playing and all the ballistic fibre has been already harvested I have no chance of finding any as server hoping doesn't work and the spawn time out means another day waiting, with limited time to play anyway it is unlikely I will ever find ballistic fibre again in FO76.
---
The disparity between the prices of similar items (looking at your player icons) is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Yes, I have leather in my inventory which could correlate with the increased leather drop. 
---
During most of this 400 drops, I had a 1\* *Quad 10mm Pistol*, an 3\* *Ghoul Slayer's Explosive P-A Shotgun*, a 1\* *Vampiric Handmade*, a 2\* *Vampiric Gatling Gun* and a 3\* *Assassin's Faster Swing Super Sledge* on me:
---
`Quad`: **0**
---
`10mm Pistol`: 1
---
`Pump-action Shotgun`: **0**
---
`Ghoul Slayer's`: 13 - armor, 4 - melee, 6 - ranged
---
`Explosive`: 1
---
`Handmade`: 1
---
`Gatling Gun`: 3
---
`Vampiric`: 3 - melee, 6 - ranged
---
`Super Sledge`: 1
---
`Assassin's`: 17 - armor, 5 - melee, 3 - ranged
---
One could say, that Ghoul Slayer's drop more for ranged due to the PA shotgun or that Assassin's drop more melee due to the Super Sledge, but they also disproportionately drop for armor more and none of my armor is either: I have chameleon and regenerating. There could be a correlation between my two vampiric and the increased ranged vampiric drop rate. However, other than the Gatling gun, there is no increased chance for a pistol, handmade, shotgun or super sledge.
---
I’d like to see brick or terra cotta roof tops to manage griefers
---
Solid advice
---
Shut up we’re having fun.
---
The “one time” atom rewards actually update.
---
Sure some are one and done (like the bobbleheads), but the ones that are like “mod 76 pieces of armor” will actually update with a new random similar challenge when you complete them.
---
Its a good game.  I quit playing mainly because I have 240+ hours into it and finished everything.  Gets old fighting the SBQ and Whitesprings over and over.
---
Going to vendors every day to check if they have the 0.0004% chance of finding that Jetpack.
---
Anyway, just be careful of higher levels, there are many more griefers around than when game first launched.    Players got bored I guess?
---
If someone starts attacking you don't fight back if you don't want to PVP.   Block them and change servers, you wont see them again.   Turn on pacifist mode to avoid accidentally damaging them.
---
Also when you die and someone takes your loot, try and not get upset, its part of the game design itself.  Death punishment.
---
Nah just sick of hearing the same line of "criticism" again and again...and again and again.....and again.  Again.
---
I used to be able to find enough ballistic fibre to keep my armor repaired and with white knight 3\* I could 'play the game' without spending all my time hunting for non excitant materials. We all play this game in our preferred way, this depends on life style also, it is now much harder and more boring. Peace!
---
To be fair the wiki can be edited by anyone so you may be right here
---
This... is blatantly incorrect. Untitled Powerarmor mods appear for; t60(material: steel) Excavator(material: Black Titan) and Ultracite(material: ultracite).
---
I’ve gotten numerous prime recievers for them
---
I'd like a sort of turret mine that you drop then it deploys into a turret that scales with your home defense skill. Like the soldier guy from Borderlands.
---
What, that’s why I was downvoted? Or the person I replied to?
---
Eh, just being honest.
---
Can’t speak for the above commenter, but it looks like you got the salty variety.
---
I started soon after thanksgiving when it had a rough start but I still enjoy playing 
---
Also explain how the game is “broken”
---
Literally my favorite saying! I’ve been using it for 30 years and this is the first time seeing someone else say it. Well, other than the first time someone said it to me. I usually get a confused look when I say it and I never explain it.
---
Nope! I just started designing and went with what I had.
---
There's a spot in Ash Heap where you can build at a premade bar. Think there's a few more like that too. I'm gonna make a Nuka Fountain shop, give Bubbles a run for her cappos
---
lol what?!! That's messed up, because I've been thinking all these time that my 1\* anti armor tesla rifle deal more damage than the regular tesla rifle...
---
If backpacks increase our load carry I want the ability to carry a tent and pocket stove!
---
Plenty of times when I could’ve used a picket stove to boil water or cook a meal.
---
The plan does exist haven't seen them in a bit but, I used to see them as much as the Ivory grip plan (which I haven't seen lately either)
---
Vaginal sand causes this, we should have sympathy and offer a douche and tubes of soothing cream.
---
You should hit up watagoa emergency services and Morgantown airport.  If you have Pharma perk under luck you'll never want for disease cures or stimpacks again!
---
Lolz I’ve repeatedly asked for this for an ingame emote.
---
Hell, I’d pay for it in atom store
---
Maybe he has a small penis and no friends so he talks down on people who are having fun
---
What makes it even more useless is that it pushes you into negative base damage for having the slightest bit of DR. That's absurd. At the very least make it cap at 0% instead of like -50%.
---
Yup and xp 
---
I’m over level 100 with nearly 200 hours.
---
Still no TSE for me either. Although to be honest if and when I do find one, I’ll likely sell it anyway.
---
I always go inside the room on the west side of that bigass bridge. Like nobody has the key inside there, and there’s 2 fusion cores in there each server hop.
---
Yeah it was really weird. I blocked him on fallout and then again on actual ps4 and when I left the server to find another one, I could tell I was on a different server and he was there. Really creepy. (I could tell because I did the powering up event on the first server so I didn’t have to build a generator to power the packaged goods and on the new server it said no one had done it yet) 
---
Yeah I had something similar with junkyard. Some asshat highbie 150 plus levels above me shot and killed me for the mats
---
My suggestion is this for things like ammo and lead loot and server hop  the resources rather then farm!
---
The clown behind you will have to wait for the resources to respawn
---
Regardless you got yours 
---
"With breaks"
---
Hah! Damn casuals. Real gamers steal their grandmas commode chairs.
---
Get yourself a gamma gun, turn that bitch full auto. Gather up as many ghouls as you can from golf club and take them out the front entrance, through the carpark and left through the little pool area. You can then take the horde to side or rear of the offending base, rately do they have turrets on sides or back. Then simply get in or near the base and spam the horde with your gamma gun to refill their health as they destroy the turret base, no wanted lvl no lost junk 👍 The more you know lol. Hope this helps☺
---
Do your special stats have an effect though? I started my first character very strength heavy because of the constant carry weight issues but was a stealth sniper with about five rifles carried at a time. I ONLY ever got melee legendaries. Around level 70 I saved up a few level ups and respecced a bunch of points from str and end into perception and my very next Whitesprings run I got a TS handmade and an AA combat rifle. The drops had to be related to the special change. Still no 3* rifles yet at level 104 smh. 
---
As a bit of potential helpful advice, invest in the Lucky Break perk.
---
Spend some time wandering the forest region with low level enemies, and that should help with keeping your armor at a reasonable level.
---
Beat me to it.
---
Posts like this are why we exist.  
---
I want my boy Gram to 1v1 the Queen. 
---
It kinda does.  You aren’t a Vault dweller anymore.  You are a Responder, or BoS, or Enclave...you are what you’ve become to the next person who leaves the vault.
---
Yes!!!   Plus I think I saw him in the savage divide South of Twin Lakes. I just stood there in awe as a multitude of rats just scampered past my legs
---
Video of launch just because.

r/imshot 
---
Lol!! Yeah I don’t think I could sell it only because I’ve got well over 500 hours playing this game and I’d be shocked if I got it lol!!! We were grinding since 745 pm and out of 67 legendaries not one explosive , two shot , TSE ,handmade , or lever and that’s what I use !!! The rng gods have punished me again!!!! Fallout 76 is a cruel mistress!!!
---
Yeah there’s always that one asshole, willing to ruin a good vibe.
---
I just pick a premade one and try to make it look similar to me
---
10min for the quest, and 20 minutes finding my way out again because for some reason that place doesn't register in my internal GPS.
---
Nightmare fuel...thank you 
---
If that works, it's genius. Thanks.
---
I actually was just intending on replying to a Bethesda employee and expressing how I was dissatisfied and not knock your fun. 
---
I always just seem to find the stuff that (for my particular build) is pretty useless.
---
My friend is RP-ing as a brotherhood member. So when I found the BOS paint for the T-60, the first thing I did was message him saying “you know you love me?” 
---
😂
---
There’s a height requirement for some areas.
---
But with big risk come big rewards.
---
Consider this an learning opportunity adjust adapt and overcome or keep on moving.
---
I was and I will !! Lol my gt is lostspartan034 just hit me up anytime!! Thanks !!
---
I use the barfing emote to show my disdain for persistent would-be pvp-ers 
---
The people in this game have been great! Honestly, one of the best communities around!
---
???  
---
It's insurance.  There is nothing wrong with having a good insurance policy - especially when so many people are asshats.
---
My question for you is this?  Why are you wasting weight on carrying leather armors?  If what you say is true, you are primarily a PA build that does not really care about armor.  So why not keep the wood with the shrouded mod?  Its weightless on every single piece thus you free up a lot of space.  But you consider it "wasted" legendary slots?  Its actually the best armor for your build!   Every single wood is basically weightless regardless of the legendary stats.
---
Genius 👍
---
Well shit. I just checked and I underestimated my play time. I’m actually at 312 hours 😬
---
You shouldn't get toasted. I stood on the platform without Power Armor during a launch and I survived
---
You do god's work my dude
---
Moves where? I only ask as I was thinking about getting it
---
It wouldn't have to work that way.  Any ONE player could have the whole thing spawn.  If anybody on the team logged on to a different server, then they would be campless.
---
Launching a nuke is no joke let alone solo. I’ve only done it once and I died a few times since it was my first run. 2nd time I tried with a friend and we made it to the end but just wasn’t worth it after we died. 
---
I had a thought that the wastelanders expansion coming in the fall is going to be maybe refugees coming from areas like DC to the relative normality and calm of West Virginia.
---
I turns roughly 110 degrees and moves out from the wall about 3 feet. Every. Single. Time. Not game breaking but annoying enough for me not to us it. It’s a shame too. It’s very nice.
---
It does work.  :)
---
Don’t get me wrong, I want world permanence too. Maybe if they increased the total players per server
---
Yeah that is a problem, thanks, now I know to hold off until fixed, shouldn’t be happening especially with real money items
---
Wow !! thanks for the stats . I’m starting to get the feeling that I will never get the good stuff. The  best 3 star I’ve received so far is my AA,40% faster swing,90% reduced weight gragnoks axe. 
---
If you're level 38 (a relatively low level) they are probably people trying to give you stuff. 
---
I know that I have tried to offload power armor sets because I no longer need them and feel bad just dropping them. 
---
There are some people who apparently send team invites and then grief you, but I haven't come across this. 
---
I would say most players you come across are friendly and some are helpful. Small percentage of jerks. On PC anyway. 
---
Totally agree. Even if it had a weight limit of 30 or something, but reduced food spoilage by like 20 times the normal rate. 
---
More reasons to hunt/ gather flowers! Also, food condition perks would still be useful for long trips. (You'll still need to carry food afterall.)
---
It's "insuranc" for people who don't know how to pvp but still want to win 3vs1. Look at OP's post history, his last post is complaining about how the game is too hard.
---
I'm sure glad people like him can just buy an "easy button" for pvp instead of learning to play. 
---
Appriciate the work! Keep it up. 
---
Just do events for stimpaks. 
---
Always welcome, my dude
---
Don't give up hope, it's a great community. There's someone for everyone
---
Or wishful thinking.
---
Thanks for the advice, I'll try doing this.

---
It's not the most op build, but with ti it's ok for me to react in every situation... swap some cards, only thing which bothers me is 5 inteligence... 6 would be better for min-max
---
Will be glad for every advices .))
---
Do you having all your junk with you all the time? If you'll just destroy one thing in the base the bounty will be few caps, you still got the attention of the owner and without the junk you'll lost only few caps of bounty.
---
I had no idea, I'll try this, though I never interact with other players and have no friends.
---
S-11, P-6, E-10, C-4, I-15, A-6, L-4. I don't see any disproportionally large laser weapon counts, nor do I see many heavy guns.
---
I use perk cards and repair them to 200% and they take forever to get to the point of needing repair. And yes have fought the sqb and the are still good to go. Just my opinion but I like the system the way it is. 
---
Awesome, thank you for this 👍
---
Being inflated with 50k perhaps is alot better to manage than being stuck with 25k.
---
I have a bloodied explosive gauss rifle that can sell for 20k easy. I also have a bloodied vats crit hunting rifle that could reach that price. I can not sell them because of the cap limit, so I am stuck with trading items for items.
---
Mine is Carl Brutananadilewski
---
I think those turrets are level 40
---
7 vendors, there is pheonix in watoga, the enclave bunker, the free estate vendor at Harper ferry.
---
Then you have the bos, responders, raiders, and the train station at white springs.
---
The characters aren't short, fat, and stumpy enough to represent myself with any accuracy, so I chose to make a random dude. 
---
Lmao!!! That’s hilarious !! And your a good friend !!! Yeah I took that one low level friend they the quest and he got it on the first try !! I was happy but secretly devastated !! I was at 300 tries and still nothing as if this evening I’m at 457 tries and it’s all stimpacks and water for this paladin !!! I’m starting to feel like Charlie Brown (“I got a rock”) it’s like the time I spent 44 minutes killing a 4-5 star legendary mirelurk queen and I got a fucking legendary drill!!! I shit you not , a drill and the only reason it was legendary was because of the assfucking I took from the queen!!! Lost all my stimpacks , ammo and broke all my weapons and several power armor pieces killing her tanky ass just to get a drill!!! Epic cluster fuck!!!
---
I was recently given one for completing Rose's Top of the World raider quest line, have you started and/or completed that quest.
---
I agree. Launched my first nuke solo and was difficult. Tried to launch my second one with another person and made it to the end but after dying and respawning it just wasn’t worth it. 
---
i think its the opposite. ammo factory is the only one you can completely isolate so nobody can get inside if you block all the entrances with con concrete barriers. even when they break you cant get past em. 
---
The Fatman is a real weapon dude. 
---
Or it was experimental anyway. 
---
I doubt anybody is stupid enough to actually use it but it is real. 
---
For what would I use the extra carryweight? I don't keep most of the legendaries and it is not really an issue to walk around Whitesprings overencumbered for a bit.
---
Wasted legendary slots are those which are present in the loot table of high-level enemies. Getting Wood Armor from the SBQ, Deathclaw or Super Mutant takes away an option from a more apt item type. Also they drop as 1\* so no progression there.
---
It's "insurance" for folks that don't go looking for fights, but find themselves in one anyway.
---
Also - it's still not difficult to kill somebody in that gear.  As you said, you just have to know how.
---
knew i wasn’t the only one lmao
---
My pleasure ☺
---
Why ty 😊
---
My guy looks just like Ryan Gosselin 
---
&gt;n cool haha. Lov
---
seconded
---
That's how it worked in fo3 and that was in my opinion the only good thing of that game.
---
You are by definition a scavenger in those games, why the fuck can't we use a gun to fix another.
---
shit i recently got rid of an anti armor one
---
Honest to what? I get that being in the military means that you aren't capable for thinking for yourself, but why let YouTube do the thinking for you? 
---
Oh, maybe you thought you were being edgy?
---
You are so unoriginal. 
---
Brilliantly put. I can only wish you the very, very best with your future endeavours. I'm not going to patronise you and start spouting sayings and whatnot in the hopes it'll make you feel better. Just know that you've got a family in your fallout friends. We'll always be excited to see you.
---
Hehe. Me like your fun. U play PS4 we be friends  
---
the "blackbird X-01"-story made me laugh you witty bastard :D 
---
I've noticed this only happens to me if I rotate it before placing. 
---
If I spin myself to get it where I want it, it usually stays put.
---
Same problem here. I also thought its the tesla rifle and since i stopped using it i never had the problem again. 
---
That's what happens when you directly port a single player system to a multiplayer game. In SP you can savescum or mod the game. In MP you just have to waste your entire day farming and end up with legendary rolling pins and pipe pistols. The roadmap has a legendary trader but we'll see how exorbitant his trade values are.   
---
I'm a trans woman who just started transitioning so I made my character look like what I WISH I looked like in real life lmao 
---
Shut. Almost everybody who is playing it is having fun and you can’t just say hurr durr fix da game already.
---
Ya sunshine is a bit broke I tried last night ended up with half dozen floating waypoints.
---
I saw the fluteplaying eyebot and the radrats it the other day outside the pumpkin house in the northern parts. I've also encountered a mr handy with three or four cats following, close to deathclaw island. Nice moments!
---
I’m playing just fine without legendarys, trash or not lol
---
The spoilage is fertilizer 
---
I'd like to be able to send a short message to a player on map. For instance - I defended one strangers CAMP yesterday while passing by; he or she will newer know - but I'd like to just be able to tell them that their CAMP is safe or something. Could I stick a note on the door could be cool as well! 
---
&gt;Well, I personally pretend ~~I didn’t spend 60 bucks on a broken game that somehow breaks more and more every moment and photoshop.~~ that I'm not sucking dick for bus change, and then walking home, but no matter how hard I try to pretend, I know it's the truth.
---
FTFY.
---
I did this before i have a video of it
---
Sounds strangely realistic for a Fallout game.
---
You need a veil to craft a veil. Make a new character and run it straight out of the vault south to AVR Medical Center. Outside round the back is a spawn location for agents. Absolutely doable at level 2 without fighting.
---
As a proud free states member I object to the HOA fees.    
---
Its completely unfair that every low level player at some point comes across a guy that, to them, is completely immortal because hes wearing the equivalent of hundreds of hours of rare gear farming. I'm 600 hours into this game and I've still never seen an assassins sentinel drop for me, although I have other sentinels pieces. So when mr hotshot pulls the full set out of his stash because he got it on the cheap from a duper on reddit, and then has the audacity to brag about winning a 3vs1 as an inexperienced pvper I get mad. The guy can barely kill super mutants yet now he can handle a 3vs1 without breaking a sweat? thats a broken system that rewards lazy players.
---
I always accept team invites as it helps my stats. I’m much stronger in a team especially if they have mutations. But it’s so hard to get a one to accept invites. It’s not that I intend to hang out with them as I’ll still play solo unless they need help. Most of the time they wanna just do their own thing too which is perfect. Wish more people would accept invites honestly. GT: BLUBLZRedeux level 90 for those that want to team up but play solo at the same time. 
---
Pros: you get to fast travel all over the map for free. Much stronger with mutations. Charisma perks can be shared. 
---
Cons: sometimes it can get annoying as they follow you everywhere or have bad mic edict. If they are annoying I’ll just leave.  
---
yeah, but it sucks when you don't have all day to farm legendaries. For those of us who come home from work at like 6 and still have to worry about dinner... we only get to play three or four hours a day. If it's completely pointless to continue grinding every day, and you get nothing day after day, why would you even consider playing still? Think about it. The past week, the most rare thing I've gotten was an anti-armor handmade. That's from playing 5 days straight after work. Everything else has been switchblades, Chinese officer sword, rolling pin, blah blah blah other trash item. It's so boring. I could just go play another game which actually rewards me for the time that I already don't have that much of
---
Yeah the 32 player limit sucks, especially as the only way to get that is for people to fill a server then invite friends to it. 
---
So if I want to come back to the same server, I just quit game?
---
Thank you :) 
---
I had this same issue a few days after the patch. I was using a BE handmade, would drop enemies to ~5%, then they would heal to full. If I hit them with mele, they would die normally. (PC)
---
This is pure gold - yet more epic fail!
---
Where is Bethesda's response to this??? Guess no cool picture included. 
---
Then.. go buy yourself a set for some measly caps to even the score.
---
The damage is already done in this regard, and there isn't any way to fix it.  We just have to pull our boots up and move on - or play something else.  You can't put toothpaste back into the tube, and being upset isn't going to change anything.
---
Waaaaaaaassssuuuuuppp?!
---
I'll make structural changes if I have some budget left over after decorating the inside. The pics I took of the inside really only cover half the rooms and it's quite large already. I'll make an update in a week or so when it's fully completed. Appreciate the feedback! 
---
Did you take her down? Curious with all the nerf/buff talk. 
---
That is a terrible reward for all that effort!
---
Gotcha, thanks for the follow up!
---
Odd, you useto be able to solo it and the civil war event. But neither seems to be triggering for solo's now. 
---
I am a simple person.  
---
I see spreadsheet.  
---
I Upvote
---
****
---
Seriously though that looks pretty good, I'll have a better look alter myself
---
As long as you go in with higher level people you should be alright. I would practice the White Spring run without a nuke to get familiar. Once the nuke hits you’ll know the ins and outs. Just gave everything and most of the time those higher levels will wipe everything in one or two shots. 
---
What platform are you on? I think I might have one. I'm on PC.
---
Nice. Bone. 
---
Scrap scrap scrap
---
You will still take more rads out of the powerarmor though due to the hidden rad resist factor, even with higher rad resist.
---
You prob didnt buy it for 60 euro either when it was suppose to be a full game release and didnt work. Now after patch after patch and 70% off in price, ofc its worth. Doesnt mean it wasnt a rip off.
---
I have never and I will never trade with anyone that I don't know personally, it completely ruins the game to just buy up all the best items from someone that could be a Duper. Don't kid yourself into thinking this guy or anyone else purchased legit gear because nobody sells it post-duper patch, people only accept trades for other high tier loot. this guy is just another brat with no skill that bought a duped full legendary set just to show off.
---
That SUCKS. I'd be super pissed if that happened with the hot rod power armor station.  
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/Valseek \- could you check on this? I've seen somebody else post this at some point, too.
---
I don’t have that exact issue but sometimes I do no damage point blank but the enemies are hurting me. 
---
I haven't tested it, but in a previous camp build I had in /roughly/ the same area, I still witnessed spawns of super mutants and ghouls. 
---
Show some evidence then. Even at the height of the TSE craze pre nerf there was no evidence you could actually one shot someone through slap damage. There were videos showing that even with screen damage in the thousands or tens of thousands it still only dealt slap damage. Now someone can repeatedly hit you for slap damage and kill you, sure. But thats going to be over many hits not one or two. If you are somehow pvp flagged (not necesassrily even wanted) then sure you can easily be one shot.
---
Opening with a sneak powder shot with crit is always a good option. I would carry a shotgun with just enforcer for utility. Since cripple card for pistols isn't great and hip fire is something mods can solve. I think going the sneak option will be the best for high hp enemies unless you have a crazy pistol. The armor pen issue just make it a pain vs some enemies. For mods just look for "true" mods or ones that increase hipfire.
---
i need a no thanks emote. every time i trade with someone and dont let someone buy my stuff they get mad and im forced to use the heart emote to make everything good. i need a "no thank you" emote. 
---
I've done Monster Mash alone, but that was a while back.
---
Losing strength makes logical sense in certain situations because the armor is mechanical and only as strong as it is. You are piloting it, and thus have its physical stat. 
---
As for your proposed solutions, #1 could be viable, but honestly I want to keep cores rare, if not rarer (can gather/farm 25+/hour easy), to incentivise taking the related perks. #2 is an oh hell no from me, this would make power armor the default best build always, and would thus is unbalanced. #3 could work, and I think will probably happen at some point but probably not be crafted.
---
I really hope its a bug then. 
---
&gt; I wouldn't waste time on checking about if having items or stats changes drop rates right now. 
---
This would take way too long.
---
&gt; crown/legendary spawns 
---
Not really relevant for my case if there is no legendary spawn. Indirectly, one could look at the location distribution in the table and infer why there is so little (0.97% of data) from West Tek: either no legendaries spawn, or they don't drop or enemies have been cleared already.
---
&gt; server hopping 
---
That makes it difficult to correlate same-server effects, i.e., whether some servers have increased chances for certain item or effect drops.
---
&gt; Also useful would be legendaries per hour  
---
You are welcome to track your encounters and analyze the legendary spawn chances.
---
I was thinking about using a powder pistol to start fights. My issue with using other non pistol weapons is I wanted to see how effective a pistol bats build truly is. From what people keep telling me, it's just not that viable
---
Huh I dunno then. I definitely get more ranged drops after my respec, it’s still all 1* hunters and exterminators trash, have never seen a legendary hunting rifle or lever action at all, but at least I’m about 60/40 ranged vs melee now
---
What about the old version - just does nothing at all now?
---
Pity the game never launched so smoothly ☹️
---
I see Monster mash from time to time, but that civil war one is the one I miss - I've seen in during beta on Oxhorn video, but now I can't trigger it to appear and it's never visible on the map either.
---
'I bought this product without checking it first, now change it for me'
---
Check raider vendors. Bought my bf one the other day 
---
Can I make a suggestion if you want to continue this; try running a second test for new data, this time use different gear and see if that has influence
---
What level do you have to be to see the plans at Grafton?
---
Wait 3* enemies can actually drop 3* items, yeah right...tell me another one. 
---
This is amazing and thank you for sharing your work. I wonder if it would be possible to set up a Google sheet where people could submit their data on legendaries (such as you collected) so we could get more data and see the trends. Not sure we could avoid people intentionally griefing the table by adding incorrect info though.
---
I just did it on PS4, OP. I think it bugged for you. I mean I just did it like less than 5 minutes ago lol
---
Sorry. I didn't know there are mods for other power armors that also lack the name in the description.
---
My experience have been that all mods I've found or bought for T45, T51, T60, Ultracite and X-01 have had that in the title and all I have found without a name in the title I have been able to apply to my Excarvator power armor.
---
I admit that there may be exceptions to this that I haven't seen.
---
I'm guessing that the material mentioned is what you would get from scrapping the mod and that would be a good way of determining what power armor it's for.
---
[We still like it where they do, if they keep going at it, they have the ability to kill you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IDLGUO7zXk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2867)
---
Hardly. The playerbase still gives him money.
---
Name-calling isn't warranted.  :/
---
I've stood on the hatch multiple times.  Good fun. Great capture. 
---
Eh... they were right for the most part. Now their just annoying. If someone isn't actively playing the game, and they complain about it like Az from Heel v Babyface over obscure bs like Bethesda celebrating 100 days, they come across looking bitter, and clueless.   
---
With The Division i watched MANY youtubers who love/hated that game. They loved it, but hated the faults, so they rode the devs like crazy! But they never wrote the game off, didn't play it, and crap on everything they did. They gave credit where it was due if improvements were made, and improvements WERE made. That game did a 180, it took months, but it happened.   
---
That's why i can't take negative coverage from most youtubers today without a grain of salt. Too many are invested in crapping on it for clicks, and don't even follow the development. That's where the line is drawn for me. You want to crap on it? Fine, but if you want to continue to perpetually crap on it, you better be involved and know wtf you're talking about! 
---
used to do it all the time solo, forgot it was vs until some guy killed me. 
---
A patch fixed invisible bees too apparently but I can tell you the stealth flying death machines are back
---
You can clear quite a few enemies from the game. Especially with sneak cards and vats crits. Issue is the armor pen some targets will just be tough to take down quickly with pistols. My own pistol guy uses pistols roaming around but silent shotgun or auto rifle for bigger targets.
---
This is something I would love!
---
I also like this name:

---
The 'ordinary' way to launch a nuke is to go and get the pieces and solve the cipher yourself.
---
God that noise was so good.
---
Hey.  I’ve checked and I can do a jet pack for the T51b. For the T60 I can do motion assist servos (+2 strength) or emergency protocols (at low health gain 25% movement speed and take 50% less damage). If you want any of these let me know and I’ll check what materials I’ll need. Thanks.
---
Why have a ceiling at all?  There is nothing else in the game with a max stack, and as long as dupe exploits dont pop up, there is no benefit to max caps.  25k caps...when you sells plans for 11k+ just doesn't make sense. 
---
Why do we keep asking to make the game easier? It's already lacking challenge
---
I'll buy it off you.  It'll have to be later this evening around 7 p.m. E.S.T time.
---
Well. Take ur time playing it.  There is no endgame.  
---
I did it the other day and every time I put the mask on the event disappeared and when I dropped the mask it showed back up. So I just ran around killing stuff without the mask on. 
---
So everyone should have easy access to god tier weapons in a looter shooter? There's plenty of top tier weapons that do the job that are easily available for caps. Try checking what people sell to in game vendors I've picked up a few good 3* weapons for next to nothing over the past week including a ts pump action shotty with extra damage while aiming for 84 caps! Not god tier but its good enough. 
---
Because I get a longer time before I have to rtb to fix if
---
Just Message me whenever you’re ready :)
---
I had stealth ghouls and stealth scorched aswell 
---
Seems you are after different things from me lol. I think it would have been much harder to program the game to base the loot on the server instance somehow, and wouldn't have provided any benefit even if it was so probably wasn't designed or coded in that way (not to say a bug(s) couldn't occur). I think that is one of those conspiracy theories. I will certainly say though, that a spawn and/or group of spawns can glitch into always respawning as legendaries and I have personally seen it in several places and anecdotally heard of it occurring at others, whitesprings, watoga, watoga HS, DC spawn north of watoga, etc.
---
As for the idea of you tracking legendaries per hour, I figured you might find it useful. I tracked my legendary farming for a while before I settled on the idea that farming an individual spawn was much more time efficient than farming whole areas. The example of the deathclaw spawn north of watoga, 20 seconds to load, 30 seconds to kill. Always a crown or legendary. 
---
It should work alone. Try it again, it probably bugged out. I once had it that the event triggered but didn’t start. Couple of server hopps fixed it.
---
The jet pack would be great !! Let me know what you need for supplies I’ll be on whenever gonna get a few hours of sleep thanks again !!
---
Just curious what type is it?  I'm assuming it's raider armor.
---
I don't know if there is a lvl requirement to see them in the vendor - I was at least 50+ when I was server hopping to find them.
---
This. I had to scrap one of my turrets the other day in favor of a new starch farm (my 15 or so bulk adhesive suddenly vanished from my stash...). Fortunately I'm high enough level and my house is small-ish (by my standards) so I still have 4 heavy machine gun turrets, a fusion generator, junk and lead collectors, 10 each of the plants I need, lots of decor, workbenches, and 8 small purifiers. It's HARD to fit all that in, tho.
---
That's the only reply you can come up with? you don't like the use of the word brat? Maybe you just cant come up with a real response so you try to attack my choice of words instead. whats next, you correct my grammar?
---
Name checks out.
---
Yes, it is raider armor. If you’re aware of any set of armour at level 15 that is something other than Raider Armor, I would love to know your secret!
---
Theres a house that's is filled with a bunch of cat bowls. You can even build there I believe
---
The grind is why I like it, keeps me playing.  Saving up my 3* stuff for the legendary vendor. Ive found some good stuff.
---
&gt; for some of us 
---
That's why they aint gonna bother wasting time with Cross play. F76 playerbase is already near dead and now "Some" from that playerbase is even much more smaller. And even if there was playerbase, would actually most care about cross play? Sure some, but most wouldn't. Do you see Blizz or Zenimax caring about adding cross play into their game? No, because the trouble aint worth the value. Instead of having to build cross play, they can focus on new content and that is something everyone wants and not just some.
---
That's the only one I knew of but I've been gone for a month so didn't know if someone found something else.
---
I'm looking more to build mine with the apparel of a Cat xd
---
700 ammo isn't a lot - not for the gatling.  Using melee weapons are cheaper for silo though.  You want high DR - and even then gutsies will hurt.  Power armor or troubleshooter's pieces helps for armor.
---
Doing the silo run will eventually become more of an annoyance (destroy cores, repair cores, repair pipes, all nonsense activities).  Most higher levels will do the run solo and be done around 20 minutes.
---
They are legendaries...not commons...
---
Don’t know man, looks like someone had a case of the Mondays.
---
I have exactly one legendary and it is my secondary weapon. I rarely die to anything in the game and end up selling Stimpacks
---
FYI scrapping everything now scraps bulk items. I don’t know how thing this was the case, but it’s that way now.
---
I think you didn't understand father howards.
---
The npc's are in the atom shop for the fair price of  7.6 $ each !
---
It just works.
---
Yeah, well, when that is your entire end game, you at least expect to get something from killing the scorchbeast queen 19 times.  The fact that legendary monsters and scorchbeast Queen does not drop anything of value for most players makes it pointless to even try
---
A player had base made out of foundations (you can't destroy it) there yesterday. No turrets though and a freaking siren going off. I laughed.
---
Yeah, that came in a few weeks back as a result of 'fixing' the bug where bulk items wouldn't auto-scrap during crafting/building.
---
I use mostly 1* weapons. My armor is mostly 2*. None of it really god tier and there's no content in the game that I can't do. The game doesn't require god tier weapons and armor. The only enemies that are tough are mirelurk queens and the sbq. Other than that nothing is really hard or threatening. 
---
I don't see how the loot system makes the game boring tho. But to each his own I reckon. 
---
The bees happen very repeatably if you find a Hive and stick around long enough (takes only 30-40 seconds).
---
They'll start spawning, and eventually one or two invisible ones will appear.  I can kill them by switching to melee weapons and backpedaling while swinging, eventually they will move in front of me and get smacked.
---
Slightly annoying, but the bees are not that dangerous.  I imagine it could happen with the Honey Beasts, but at least you can still see the Honey Beasts and focus on killing them, as bees are a minor nuisance at best.
---
I've yet to see Stealth Ghouls or Scorched, myself.  Not counting ones stuck underground or inside walls.
---
You can sometimes retrieve your loot if you drop 1 item as close to it as you can. When the new bag spawns, it can transfer your stuff from the old bag to the new one. 
---
I have a bloodied sledgehammer that a high level friend gifted to me, a bloodied grognak's axe, a bloodied gatling gun, and earlier I had a bloodied laser gatling drop but I got rid of it because it was useless. I also have a bloodied 44 that I don't quite have the heart to get rid of even though it's also essentially useless. Oh and I was running around with a bloodied pole hook until I got gifted the sledgehammer.
---
What level are you? By level 125 or so you should have at least one useful bloodied melee weapon. And honestly the only place where it matters is the SBQ, and there are other ways to be useful there besides DPSing.
---
I live adjacent to Lucky Hole mine and I would prefer not to have my world ending demonic neighbor awakened on a regular basis. Thank you.
---
I'm not sure they are planning to patch "energy weapons specifically in the next patch but they have said they are doing a heavy weapons overhaul, half of which are energy weapons.
---
Tried that :( 
---
That's basically what happened to me and yes it's not instant death but it's very annoying .
---
Is that 20 hrs of in game time or real time? Even after I don't play for a few days half the vendors have 0 caps... &gt;.&lt;
---
Ouch, sorry then :(
---
Sick
---
Hmmm...I would find that extremely doubtful because as far as I know even in Fallout 4, the lowest quality power armor obtainable was the the raider power armor but none the less. This being the weakest power armor in the game it really is a must have for lower levels. Especially in the early stages. Once repaired it also is extremely durable. I at level 16 in the raider power armor I was going toe to toe with some enemies in their 40s which is pretty amazing.
---
Level 105, I've never bought a Stimpack. Not once.
---
I have a bee hive cluster (about 7 separate lootable hives around a tree/stump) just outside of my CAMP location.  I used to hit it up every day and do the Teapot daily just because it was close by.  Never failed to spawn invisible bees.  I mostly ignored them after the first time.  Grabbed my honey and ran off.
---
I don’t remember finding one named that,  I would log on and check but my psn is out atm.  Good luck to you
---
I got a really nice Tesla Shotgun dropped from one this morning.  
---
Makes it more interesting that they’re so rare and hard to get in game.. when you find something even half decent it’s a nice reward.. and if you don’t want to grind forever then are tons of decent 3* weapons available for reasonable caps.  My most used gun is a level 35 2* instigating lever action with 50% limb damage, and a 3* bloodied lever action with faster fire rate and DR when aiming, neither anything like god roll but do just fine. 
---
Look at TSE now, they were the weapon to have and now everyone’s desperately trying to get rid of them for the next perceived best weapon... 
---
I've killed the scorchbeast Queen 19 times. Haven't gotten a single two shot of any kind, no explosive, no bloodied. I'm level 69. Only thing I have is anti-armor handmade. I just don't have the time to level to 120 V. If I had that kind of time, the legendary vendor would be out already and next content dropping
---
I get a lot of 1* bloodied items, you've just got 
---
to get out there and farm! 
---
I’m not really sure anymore I stopped playing the game shortly after I did this.   Psn is out atm so I can’t check.  I kind of wanted to say it was in the south east region.  It was apart of this mountain range west of that long ass river that comes off of the lake that has a picture of a fish on it.  
---
That’s what I think,  I’m not 100% on that though 
---
It makes it boring because that is the reward at end game. You do everything for loop. So when you get to max level, and you have already gotten a bunch of shity legendary items that are basically worthless, what incentive do you have to keep trying or playing if nothing ever drops that is better? That's why it's boring. You kill scorchbeast queen for loot... loot not good, no reward. 
---
2 and 3: you don't have to lock anything (and your stash is only accessible by you), but you can. The locks can be picked by other players BUT doing so causes them to become wanted, so most players won't do it. You can lock resource collectors (in workshops or your CAMP*), doors, water purifiers, and window shutters.
---
*Fun tip: if you place your camp at a spot with a resource node like junk or lead or whatever, you will be able to build that collector - no need to find plans. There are even a couple of spots where you can fit 2 different collectors into one camp radius. There are maps with locations of different resources; just Google it. 
---
And if you're on PS4, hit me up. I like helping out new players, and I can make you some armor or weapons or whatever.
---
Not the yao guai! I get my ass kicked by regular ones!!!
---
Yeah, you wouldn't grief your own data collection. Accepting anything else from random people is unverifiable and perhaps unreliable as well.
---
Happened in game last night, this player "thelonesnipe111" or something like that is complete douche bag. I think someone else already posted about this dweeb. Last night was my turn in the barrel with this punk. I logged into pleasant valley train station and immediately I heard on the proximity speaker, "Hey I got this new perk card that does  damage if you shoot me, want to try it?" I did even know he was talking to me so I started my trek back down to Whitesprings. He made some stupid remark and then I realized this was the douche that likes to camp there and accost people and who has killed lower players for nothing. Later I was using the vendor bot at the Whitesprings station and I start getting beat in the back by someone, I ignored it but it continued so I turned around to see who it was and guess who it was? This azzhat, he waited until I turned around and then took over the vendor. I got on Mic and asked what the F@#$@!# his problem was and told him to grow up. Sounds like he is 15 or so in real life and needs a serious spanking!
---
That's capitalism sadly.
---
&gt; You can buy serums for 300-500 caps from players.
---
I really wish I had thought of this before I spent 12k caps buying serums the other day straight from Modus.
---
In a fissure.... :-( 
---
Does this not apply to legendary weapons? I repaid one of mine last night with this perk in place and it did not repair it to 130% like it did my other non legendary weapons. 
---
I like to re-create supporting actors based on roles that fit the theme. For New Vegas I did Annie Costner as Carrier 18 (*The Postman*). This time I went with David Della Rocco as "[The Funny Man](https://i.imgur.com/lSunCG2.png)" (*The Boondock Saints*).
---
&gt;"We could kill *everyone!*"
---
New content is next month. Legendaries are easy to come by, even weapons with the prefix you're looking for. You just have to accept that 1*'s have value.
---
I still have the 1* handmade and Lever action I bought from the Watoga vendor. I've since upgraded to 2*  versions, one of which I found, the other I bought for 1500 caps.
---
Build it to look like a cat 
---
O\_o
---
They always followed me and killed me. A slow, annoyed death. Then again... the video of me wailing around like an idiot would probably be pretty funny.
---
In that case. I guess I will try again with this. Thanks for the clarifation 
---
The SBQ encounter gives you \*one\* legendary, although usually a pretty good one, while the Whitespring, if you don't crash, can get you a good dozen or so per nuke.
---
I get most of my legendaries from the Whitespring. Which, before they nerfed the experience glowing feral ghouls get you, also makes you level up really fast.
---
Also as a level 69 you are making the SBQ encounter difficult for everyone else. Go level up at the Whitespring, getting some nice legendaries in the meantime, and come back when you are level 90 or so.
---
X
---
I get more level 5 scrubs just unlocked PvP wanting to have a go.  My response tends to be to let them go ahead and whack my pc as much as they like, they get bored really quickly. 
---
 I have healing items for ages and wander around just doing my thing lol.
---
And I ignore the "insults" from any who have a mic.
---
since someone here is going to understand this, can someone do an ELI5 on the seeded loot theory?
---
The body is in my mind,but the head,legs and tail no 😅
---
wrong and wrong. 
---
softcap is 23  in special, power armor isn't good for meles couse of fist weapons and strength gear. 
---
Wow.  Got hosed on this one.
---
I suggest you report them to the moderators there, and let them decide if he crossed the line for their rules.
---
Probably best asking over there. Annoys me when I see people accept a price then knock it up because someone offered more. Its usually over such a paltry amount like 500 caps too.
---
Lol, even [dailystar.co.uk](https://dailystar.co.uk), with "Crossplay Confirmed" in title confirmed only one thing- they aren't interested investing resources into adding it. Unlike PCGamer, Dailystar used missleading clickbait title, but both of these articles use same source, where both sources tell one thing: "We are not going to have cross play in F76", "We look it as an option post launch", "Cross play is not our priority or focus", "...now it feels like they’re coming around". This is nothing more than "Saying No through flowers".
---
Hear hear. 
---
Building the mod should definitely require the perk. Bolting on a premade mod? That should be doable by anyone (just like real life)!
---
Maybe we can establish some kind of Fallout 76 court system.  If it was real life you could argue a meeting fo the minds occurred and a contract was formed and that you relied on that when selling your legendaries to fulfill your end of the bargain.
---
Some manner of half-floors linked together could make a tail.
---
You could use the neon letters and wall art to make a face.
---
Angled walls for the ears.
---
*feature
---
This is so sweet
---
Not a real life person but I made mine Ciri for a while. :)
---
You didnt get any " life saving " armor? RNGesus has been on a lifesaving kick in my world, ive gotten those many times in recent memory, to put it scientifically :)
---
Great writeup
---
“I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds...”
---
Yes they did. The mods made a post saying to only discuss getting banned in the megathread unless the post was informative. This post was a rip on Bethesda, and whining that you're banned. So they deleted it.
---
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 that could work ,i'll look for some tutorials to learn how to try It 🤔
---
I'm curious how much you are exaggerating here?  Cause I have an 2* AA Handmade I picked up last week, and and can put around almost 1500 rounds thru it before it drops by about 100 condition.  Will have to get some harder numbers on actual CND consumption.  
---
But during my normal daily stuff (I use it mostly on Super Mutants as Scorched and Ghouls get shot with my Lever Action) I can expend 500 rounds / day and only drop below 100% (from 200%) after a few days.
---
Sounds like where I just set up my camp :) (thus the complaints)
---
I like the way the roadmap lays out none of the stuff people wanted is coming so people are trying to force it into the most random stuff imaginable.   
---
What if the backpack was a human NPC!
---
Try killing a chameleon death claw.....
---
It's easy karma.
---
This must be near the power plant in the mire! I used to have a camp there, cool spot. Too many scorch beast attacks made me move 
---
This is the fallout 76 subreddit, know your audience 
---
yeah I was almost lvl 30 before I took her quests, you are a bit low for her quests...
---
I bought it pretty much the day of release and consider (300 hours in) I have gotten my money's worth.
---
  Having said that I tend to enjoy wandering around in an open world and haven't done anywhere near everything there is to do. 
---
 There is an entire section of the map I haven't been yet so I will continue to explore.
---
I've got 11 life saving armor piece, 2.88% of all drops. It just didn't make into the overview.
---
Where are you getting your facts? Ever since this last patch, the scorchbeast queen has been incredibly bugged. for many people it has dropped absolutely no loot and because of the loading loot screens, half the time you get nothing at all because it will disappear before you can even get anything. Out of 19 times, she dropped something six times, and they were absolute garbage. Simply one star rolling pin pickaxe whatever the hell. 
---
&gt;Also as a level 69 you are making the SBQ encounter difficult for everyone else. 
---
Are you trolling? I don't know if you are trolling or not. Seriously. I'm a level 69 with non power armor damage resistance tank and rad sponge. I run around just the same as everyone beating the hell out of the adds that pop up and reviving people. That's doing a lot. So I have no idea what the hell you're even talking about making the encounter more difficult. That's such a joke
---
Absolutely, I just feel it's important for the blindly optimistic to realize the ramifications of begging for the removal of pvp.
---
It would be possible if they just removed the buffer zone between camps for people that are friends, allowing camp build zones to be next to each other.
---
This is great to hear. Through a fallout roleplay I met some of my closest buds. They were there for me through a particularly tough breakup, and when my mental health isn't all that great, they're there too.
---
When fo76 came out, one mare from the aforementioned group that I'd drifted apart from reached out to me and we began playing together. I'd hit a particularly rough path at that time and he gave me something to think about that wasnt my troubles. After reconnecting I was able to get back to being me again soon after.
---
I'm lvl 106. Yesterday I had 5 heavy machine gun turrets, junk and lead collectors, average-sized (brick, 2 story, 2x4 foundation) house, fusion generator, power connectors, ALL workbenches, some plants, 3 small purifiers, and some fancy decor and neon stuffs in my camp. No duplication glitches, all built from scratch after I scrapped my entire camp (except for the collectors and generator) to rebuild. Did not move my camp at all.
---
Later I scrapped one of those turrets to make room for a starch farm with 5 more small purifiers (8 total) and 10 each of mutfruit/corn/tatos (plus a few extra little goodies I couldn't fit before). Definitely could not build that much at lower levels; I'll test it out in a more concrete way later with my lvl 12 alt. 
---
But the point is, I'm going to have to disagree with you. 5 turrets + house + 2 collectors + generator + purifiers + workbenches + budget-eating decor = way more than any low level character can build.
---
Whitespring golf club entrance?
---
At these plants I lost lot of legendary stuff lol. Crops are also unlootabel if they are unter the plants. Since beta haha
---
What do you do with technical data?
---
Mines a TSE and it seems after I put around 300 rounds through it, it breaks or gets close. It’s been a while since I played though so I’m not entirely sure 
---
Didnt know any better.  I am new to reddit and i assumed this would be a good place to make deals.  Didnt know there would be no consequences for being a deadbeat.   
---
Its a common extortion technique thats been around since early runescape, though I wouldn't be surprised if it was around earlier. "Someone just offered me more, pay me more or you don't get the item." Usually there never actually is another person offering and they just want more money out of you. The best thing you can do is report it if there are any rules against it or just don't give them business. 
---
It's pretty lame. First thing I bought from the atom shop and I have never been able to use it. 
---
Yes, in those older fallouts your gun would have problems chambering a round during a reload or the bolt would get sticky. You'd never jam while firing tho. That proud distinction goes to Far Cry 2.
---
Definitely should be on the list of fallout monsters.
---
Boy do I have a game for you! Kerbal Space Program, guaranteed to never get you reliably into space because physics are a cruel thing!
---
Now that I read this, I understand that it's such a shitty troll post that I'm sorry I put thought into my other comment
---
Thanks, had no idea that was the case.
---
Since i am new here, how do i report them?

It scales weirdly with your hunger/thirst levels.
---
Yeah like in borderlands 2. I would love it! 
---
Just down the road from the club. Near the stone gazebo looking thing.
---
I got slapped by a Deathclaw 😂
---
I think the challenge is going to be if they are craftable, what materials are going to get used, different weapons require different materials at different quantities, whats the repair kit going to require? 
---
It might be more cost effective to repair some weapons using only repair kits.
---
I guess if the repair kit only repaired it to 100% and not 200%, it would retain the incentive to use the workbench once you get out of battle.
---
Im fine with repair kit idea, just playin devils advocate
---
Ahh yeah my best friend there haha. But I think its because of the plant. Everytime a paperbag or crops are under plants I don't can take them 
---
I'd be content with a jam while reloading. While firing gets more interesting. Especially for non projectile weapons
---
I got a vampires spear with swing speed and reduced weight from the queen about an hour ago. Along with lever prime plan, an ultracite power armor mod plan (don't remember which one) and a vanguards heavy combat arm with ap refresh. Then various stable fluxes from the event rewards. 🤷🏻‍♂️ felt pretty rewarding. 
---
Great stuff, thank you!
---
What do you mean about "whack a mole"? They don't support mods for this game either, but they have shared screenshots of mods on their twitter page for this game already. So the private servers will be no different than the mods. 
---
You are confusing a paid monthly subscription based game, to a game with free multiplayer. They have no reason to care about private servers when they have already stated they were going to come out with them in the next year anyways.
---
Why the hell did you even use the box to transfer items if your friend was in the game
---
Les Claypool. I've got a Stand-Up bass guitar and my camp on the deck
---
What is that supposed to mean?
---
What do you sell, if I may ask, that is worth this much? 
---
Sounds like you kinda played yourself mate
---
Means most people still on this sub have something positive to say about the game
---
The rules state to conduct trades through comments. If there are no posts from another user offering the higher amount then report him and move along.
---
TBH I dont think you were truly screwed over. I mean, you tried to secure a deal where you didn't have enough caps for in the first place and had to liquify your assets to gather them. This probably took some time (if you sold them to vendor they were not good anyway, if you sold em to players then it took precious time). I'm not surprised that if he received a better offer in meantime, he took it, as long as you haven't actually traded and secured the deal, it didn't really count. If I had to choose between selling an item right now for more, or count that a person will be there on time in some future to sell it for less, I wouldn't bother thinking about it.
---
You could say you were screwed over if he took caps, didn't give you an item, and then gave you his regards with yomomma joke and logoff.
---
Honestly, if you tried to give negative karma for the fact that the deal you wanted never took place, you should end up on subs blacklist.
---
I'm not saying that this was utterly cool from the guy side, but the environment we're all in favors auction-based selling,  and with auction based selling you must close the deal ASAP in order to minimse the price, and trying to spoil people reputation because they haven't sold you something you fancied is something that is much less cool than saying you'd sell an item and then not selling it.
---
I'm at a junk pile just off the road to the south west of Vault 76.  Near a Hunter's Camp and that "Haunted" Cabin area.  It's been a good spot for me.  Nice and cozy, flat area to build on.  Not very well located as far as Water (though there is a small lake/pond, it's too far away from the Junk Pile).  And not very good for Fast-Traveling to high level areas.
---
But it's a nice spot to start my vendor route at Flatwood, and gives me quick access to the Flatwood area Relay Tower for easy Ballistic Fiber.
---
He said safer "For general use", not "for rampant misuse". So, safer for use in a car or other related invention. One could argue though, it's also safer in regards to misuse. Considering the mini nuke can be taken and relied upon as a short-ish range weapon in the first place.
---
Don't fucking use second accounts as a mule then retard there's no way you need to do that
---
I would like that too
---
For *Bloodied*, the best location I found is Whitesprings with about 1:46 (2.17%) chance for one, preferrably nuked.
---
Love this idea but I'm terrified that HOAs still exist in the post apocalypse.
---
I always wanted to be standing on the cover to see if I get launched across the map.
---
I wonder if the "Two Shots" have twice as much CND loss per single shot of ammo.
---
I found it was a one-off isolated incident. I've had no problems since the day I posted that message.
---
I'm in Brisbane, TPG is my provider. All my other internet was working at the time.
---
If your looking for a team camp already in game there's a nice lil spot near big bend tunnel on the ash side....its to the right if you leave the tunnel and directly across from the train station....it has tents and such already 
---
I C a BM. 
---
No. Please continue. 
---
Hol up Steve Buscemi. This isn't Armageddon. 😜
---
I have my camp up in the Toxic Valley (the spot northeast of Graninger Farm with the junk and lead collectors). There's a pond right next to it with a pile of orange barrels. I got 7 or 8 of my mutations by sitting on top of them, and bought the remaining 4 as serums from a player for 200 caps each. So 800 caps + about half an hour of relogging between mutations.
---
" I get most of my legendaries from the Whitespring. Which, before they nerfed the experience glowing feral ghouls get you, also makes you level up really fast."
---
You're awful quick to criticize the game when people tell you how to solve your problem and you just ignore it. Maybe git gud?
---
You should try playing this game at level 1 with no clue what to do.
---
Ah.  Yes of course.  I should have noticed it wasn’t the SBQ.  I’m a moron.  But still, that’s epic.  I am a playing a heavy gun build but so far haven’t found a mini gun I like.  My best guns are a TSE GG which I bought in game off a player and a beautiful 3 star TSE Galtling Plasma which I earned from a kill.  That baby is quit good against all enemies including a regular level SB.
---
Hardened/Powerful Automatic is only useful if your run an gun and are always in DANGER.
---
Try modding your weapon with a Calibrated or Tweaked automatic receiver, as opposed to Hardened or Powerful Automatic.
---
Cool guys don't look at explosions - or the rockets that cause them 
---
I never trust "world boxes" to securely hold loot.  People can always come by and loot them.  Plus, I have always heard, but never confirmed myself as I don't use them, they can be "reset" if no players are in the area for a long enough time.
---
So why don’t you go play another game? 
---
I get it. The legendary drop system (rng) is kinda screwy, but you are only level 69. Expecting an end game weapon to drop when you don’t even have the levels to unlock all the perk cards yet is kind of silly.
---
I have a full time job and other obligations. I can’t play all day either, but it hasn’t stopped me. Maybe try looking up some farming strategies. Trade junk for caps and caps for lower tier legendaries and work your way up.
---
I put the conversation we had on my origial post.  I would not make an offer if i couldnt produce the funds on time.  I dont play games like that.
---
My uncle did a melee-chem build IRL.
---
I hope that's a statue and not the actual mothman!
---
I see someone helped you already, that's nice. I have only found 2 tse weapons and they weren't max lvl. Have about the same ingame time as you or more. It's really rare, luckily there are other high damage combos aswell. Just wanted to let you know events like Uranium fever will never drop max level gear afaik. Gear level is linked to enemy level. The moment I learned this I started paying attention. Haven't found a max lvl item yet on those. 
---
Pick locations with high enemy count and/or smallest time to clear. Watoga has some, the steakhouse, westek, Harpers ferry. Getting routes is way more reliable then doing the quests. If legendaries are your only goal.
---
Fallout 76: SVU
---
&gt; There seems to be an effect from selling the useless drops as it appears to reinforce the chances of getting that legendary effect again. Not sure if this is a bug or a remedy implemented for accidentally sold legendaries.
---
The dupers selling dozens of TSE weapons to merchants were actually just playing 4D chess all along

I'm at aaronholdt homestead. I like the free farmed food nearby without needing to plant my own and it has the junk pile too (plus the honey and bees)

Unfortunately I do not. I ended up giving it away.

---
Place a non-turret camp at the back of the clubhouse (workstations, stashbox, decon arch) and server hop until you find a server where your camp can be placed....   blocks turret camps from spawning in and you have access to repair, dump, scrap, and remove rads...
---
I hate when this happens during AWOL Armaments.
---
First of all, your position is constantly updated to everyone in the game. Creating an object shouldn't be that much more of a big deal. Second, why would this be announced to everyone on the server? That's stupid. Third, why do you think a slider would help this? That makes no sense. Fourth, this stupid thing should never crash a server, so there would be no need to track who was doing it.
---
Got this the other day, you have to have really low health for it to kick in.
---
I am S-15, and legendary hunting rifles, gatlings, shotguns, and the occasional handmade or lever action do drop for me, so it can't be a strength thing. I have only 4 points in P, but 9 or so in L, so there's that.

Any way you could make the template of your spreadsheet available for download/sharing.

They could still put him on the blacklist and others will know not to trade with the deadbeat in the future.  Its better than via Discord or something else though where no one will know of the trade gone wrong.
---
I'm skeptical because this would be the first case of a three star wood armor. Even [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avbgc4/loot_drop_chances_roundup_february_27/) is chronicling how wood armor only drops as a one star. The one time I *thought* I had a three star it was just lag and displaying info from the armor piece above it
---
 God, yes. This post needs some up votes badly.
---
There's a theory that everything in the game is a Vault Tec simulation on an endless loop and that's why the date never changes. I kinda hope that's true.
---
Thumbs down isn't poignant enough?

How would you launch an atom bomb from a silo sir

Ill look i may have ss it. Idk though lol. I thought it only had one buff, but inspected it, and it had 3
---
I'm currently level 76(haha) but i enjoy playing with my friend who is level 20 because i get to help level up people faster. Yesterday i was playing with a level thirty and was dopped a nocternal grenade launcher as a parting gift. I enjoy playing alone too. 
---
If you ever need to help level up im tinacole on xbox. Currently, have been farming around whitesprings for sweet guns and the ash heep for materials.
---
Mini nukes...
---
This guy literally removed the hump from hump day.
---
I've seen that all over the place, but I haven't seen it with turrets. Enemies spawn in en mass with no warning. If you are in stealth, they'll sprint off to their starting locations. If not, they'll all attack you. The worst time it happened to me was when I cleared a town of super mutants, killed the last one and on my way to loot the corpses they all re-appeared right in front of me. My stealth-based character did not do well. Fortunately, I also have the power to respawn.
---
From my own informal tests, you have to be at about 65% health or lower, and then it goes in steps instead of scaling smoothly as you go down.
---
This bug is still in the game. The way point was telling me to go to the toilet. Not the site. 
---
Sneak/Crit/VATS character. I hardly ever get detected or hit. I vendor 200+ stimpacks a week. I use less than 10 Stimpacks for SBQ event.

World boxes were never safe storage, even in single player bethesda games. Sorry man. But in this case you can only get mad at yourself.

It's possible that Gutsy is at fault, but it sounds more like the "immortal SBQ" issue that's been reported in several other threads.

i partially hope they add all those "exclusive" Nuka cola flavors to the item drop pool. either as actual items or as recipes. and then let us have the Special Nuka Recipes from Nuka world. maybe even some new ones

Crazy amount of work that you've put into this.. thanks for sharing all the data!

Right at the bend in Highway 88 as it turns north, just outside Alpine River Cabins, Northwest of Flatwoods.

I did all but one of my Silo runs solo. At lvl 257+, I have a Vampiric Gatling Gun and other than the occasional 2-3 Assaultrons damaging me faster than the vampiric heals, it's pretty much walk in the park for me. About 500-700 rounds per silo. The one time I teamed up with somebody lvl 70, all enemies and turrets were lower level than solo, so it was even easier. I never had someone random doing a silo run while I was there. People usually check the map and they see some 100+ at the location(s), they simply don't try it themselves but wait for the free Whitesprings/Prime drop.
---
I can't say much about the difficulty for a lvl 50 character as I first entered the Savage Divide lvl 60 and the Mire at lvl 100, so I was well prepared the time. There are occasionally lower level characters at mass events which I try to share kills as much as possible.
---
Let me know when you are online and I can jump on and meet up with you.
---
Yup. It’s a royal pain in the arse.
---
That sucks, sorry to hear about it. Stuff like this is the reason I won't make a deal I don't already have the caps for. 
---
good for you!  I feel like us rational people are starting to be heard more now - I have had the game since launch and have found myself defending it more than I expected to be - yeah it ain't perfect, but it is the first fallout where I feel like I really have to be careful and be attentive - the world really feels like a post-apocalyptic survival horror game.
---
Not only that, but almost every interaction I have had with another online player has been nothing but positive.
---
I don't play a whole lot, am only like level 26 - the world does feel kind of empty sometimes - but you know, so did new vegas and F03.  
---
If bethesda continue to support it and release new content as they have said they are going to recently, then I will continue to play and enjoy it.
---
Weapon Artisan definitely works with Legendary Weapons. I've never had the perk card not work like it's supposed to when I equipped it, on any patch version. 
---
That's really great to hear, I'm so happy for you. This really is a great community.
---
\-8% damage from Players is the only thing it lists.
---
The sheet is shared, you can make a copy of it into your drive account.
---
The most system intensive effects are lighting, moving objects and all the particle effects for projectiles and explosions. That's why the most expensive camp items are turrets and lights. Those 20 items are so comparably cheap because they just have to be rendered and that's it. 
---
Yeah I was wondering why so many that made you tube videos had so much rad damage and only 20% or so of their health left? Now this makes sense although it seems very risky to me to go through the game with that low of HP all the time...
---
That was beautifully written, I love the idea that they're kinda like a beacon for you, that's super special and I'm so happy for you

Its not a huge deal, but i am older and its about principle.  I have over 17k now, but i dont like games.

I know about the immortality bug, but I'm almost certain this wasn't due to it. Her health dropped from 99% to 95% under constant fire within the last 25 minutes.

Absolutely, there's plenty of junk out there, that said I do get a little peeved if I've been carrying ballistic fibre atound, that stuff is not easy to come by. 
---
No one says that you need to play this game for months on end. Play it until you get bored, take a break, and then come back when new content comes out.
---
Once you get that end game gear then the content will truly be over. That js the point that I think you are missing. You want to take one more final step and then you will have absolutely nothing to do. Grinding gear keeps that final step from completing until new content comes out.
---
If you had every single legendary that you want today, then two weeks from now you would put another post up saying you have nothing to do...
---
Well i'd actually love that to happen to me.
---
Yes you can and should.
---
He should’ve provided the opportunity for you to counter 
---
okay thanks, I dont know why then it didnt apply? Unless I just missed it...
---
I'd love that.
---
Hardly any of my friends play this game and the fee that do don't play often.
---
In terms of what?  They do exist in the game and play out like mini-tragedies.  The reasoning behind them is speculative.  But, I don't think it's a stretch to liken them to "homemade Vaults" because that's essentially what they are.
---
How do i contact a moderator.  Is there a link?  I tried to find it, but i can only find how to report a moderator, not report to a moderator. 
---
I'm not really concerned about the condition of new weapons for two reasons.
---
1. I can repair them if I want to keep them.
---
2. I assumed that i'd need to find the blueprints for weapons and craft my own at higher levels
---
From what I've been reading, it appears that we don't really get weapons of our level past level 60 or so.  So I assumed that above that level, that anything I craft would be better than what I find.
---
Sometimes, when you do the repair, the lighter color bar doesn't appear immediately. You have to highlight a different weapon and go back to the one you just repaired. It's like a "status refresh" visual glitch. Pretty minor thing but I've been confused by it. 
---
Did you try selling to them anyway? I dunno if they fixed it yet but often times they'll show 0 until you sell something and then their caps show up. It was a bug that's been there since the beginning I think
---
Get fucked if you use a radium rifle.  Get fucked if you use a plasma weapon.  Get fucked if you use a western revolver.  Get fucked if you use a minigun.  Get fucked if you use a .50 cal.  Get fucked if you use a grenade launcher.  Get fucked if you use a handmade.
---
But if you use any shotgun, hunting rifle, or assault rifle then never need to worry about repairs ever again!  Great idea!
---
I have no idea what causes it unfortunately. We just power through it because she takes damage again eventually.
---
&gt; As for the Wood, the fastest way to check the hypothesis is to not sell it and not drop it into a paper bag either. Place it in a world container and leave it there.
---
Do you have any data supporting that? Why would the engine make a difference between various ways to 'lose' an item? I'm dropping most of my Whitesprings loot into a container anyway, but I'll see if selling only weapons to the vendors will make any difference in subsequent drops.
---
I would not bet on that, though. Do you really believe the devs would run *another* database to track what types of items you recently lost, and correlate that when determining loot drops? Don't you think that check would have been the first to be culled, with the loot loading delays running rampant as they do? Just curious.
---
While I do love these posts about how to manipulate the stakes, and I do appreciate your work (and would love to have the patience to do something like that myself), I think in the end it's just the random number generators doing the devil's work. No offense! :-)
---
I have 2 of the chest plans. Would not be available until 6pm EST if interested.
---
Just use the mechanic from fallout NV. Have a mailbox that you can send stuff to other players.
---
Rumor has it this mailbox already exists in game. It's in Mama Dolce's. The problem is, once you send something off it can never be pulled back out
---
I just want separated boxes. So badly. Like, instead of one 800 lb box, 4 200 lb boxes so I could separate different stuff. 
---
There are two options, by unselecting the event (little square next to quest disappears) that untrack it. You can also press X or Y on xbox it tells you at the bottom of your screen to quit the event altogether.
---
This is what I do and it removes the event from my list so I assumed once I did this, and blocked the aggressor I was free and clear. 
---
I'll have to try and grab some screen shots next time it happens and see if this is the case.   
---
Or maybe they'll make it so it will actually reduce the over all armor and energy resistance has with each consecutive hit making them take more damage across the board for a set amount of time.
---
Similar in function to Suppressors and Furious except it will affect their armor ratings and be more useful on heavily armored enemies.
---
Fix the game, i paid money for it
---
Yup :))) 
---
You cannot trade things with Atom Shop paint on them, just so you know.  
---
Haters Gonna hate..  
---
It is all to easy to flame something that is different. This is \*Not\* a typical Fallout game. It is so much more. 
---
As log as Bethesda can stay on this path it will just get better.   
---
I know I'll take it off I just didnt do it incase it doesn't sell 
---
bUT tHe GaMe Is DeAD!! 
---
Honstly, I love how RPG this game can get, I play it over Destiny, Anthem and pretty much everything else. 
---
And anyone that doesn't use a shotgun or hunting rifle can cry all the way back to the repair bench.  Why would anyone use a radium rifle if they can use an assault rifle and use it all ding dong day while never worrying about its condition?  Really great idea!
---
If anyone on PC wants to do an event or something like this - I have a facility pre-built ready to host.
---
Fight clubs, concerts, plays, game shows - whatever your event, PStryder's Wasteland Theater is available to host!

Thank man, whats your psn ? im still waiting for game to arrive , im hoping it arrives tomorrow
---
as you are walking around, keep an eye out for what looks like a small bomb crater.
---
  They often contain ore deposits of some type - for example, the crater at the entrance of Posiedon energy contains uranium ore, the one further down the same driveway is concrete.  Caveat - at workshops, there may or may not be an extractor over the crater, and you'll need acid to break down the ore to usable material.
---
If you are traversing a mountain, watch for odd color rocks.  
---
Many of those are (material) deposits, which do not need to be broken down to be usable.
---
Lol yikes.
---
Oh Father Howards,  always telling me to just work.
---
And while they're at it, bring back the fallout 3 ability to break down bullets I don't use to craft other bullets that are useful to me.
---
It used to do that to me with the military cap 
---
Wait hang on, really?
---
cool, just send me a friend request. I usually play weekend mornings (EST). 
---
I totally get that. At 37, I find I can't stand most of the snot-nosed kids in online games these days. So much so that FO76 is the only online game I play, and that only because I refuse to miss a Fallout game.
---
Same as my reddit.
---
Hi,
---
I don't know if anyone has flagged this but for as long as I have played the game (same month as release) there has been a bug where the stash inventory moves around when you take items out of it. 
---
Based on this, it became a habit of mine to take all of my junk out - including bulk, so I could just spam the 'take' button - I would then scrap and bulk the new and old remnants together. 
---
After not playing the game for a month I decided to get back into Appalachia, however when I performed my daily ritual I was met with horror and grief as I saw all of my bulked items get scrapped alongside my regular junk. I now have too much loose junk and not enough plastic to rebulk so I am now at a loss with having to either drop a lot of junk or walk around over-encumbered on a never ending quest to regain lost plastic. :(
---
I don't know whether bulk not being scrapped originally was planned but it was definitely a useful feature to have.
---
Then bring back the Jury Rigging perk too, you can use any gun in the similar category to repair your weapons at half the effect.
---
So lets say you're using a Radium Rifle, well, if you use another radium rifle you get lets say 50% repair to your weapon, but with jury rigging you can also use an assault rifle or any rifle for that matter to repair the weapon by 25%. 
---
Need try it, Thanks
---
**THIS**
---
If you can handle the damage, killing the ghouls at Whitesprings is a quick way to get XP. Also, just do the events. Even the easy ones can net over 150 xp and don't take too much time.
---
what level are u and what gear are u using 
---
You aren't alone! Same thing happened to me yesterday! Had a guy west of my camp rocking a 400 cap bounty, I thought happy days...Oh was i mistaken. I whipped out my best weapon only to do 0 damage after 5 consecutive shots on him (easily he was a 1 shot)
---
Mofo just turns around a swipes me once to end me lol. It was at this point I knew I'd f**ckd up.
---
They did say they were gona look to adjust energy weapons
---
Ive been testing this in my own game lately....it seems that i get much better drops when i use a bunch of buffs to up my luck stat. .......i keep telling myself its coincidence, but i dont think it is....and whoever posted above about 5 * legendarys is full of shit.
---
Yeah but when I spawned into the event things were already going on....like I was being attacked before I could move so it wasn't possible
---
I have a tse laser rifle and it's by far the best weapon I own against robots and super mutants. Just a shame i can only use it for an hour before it breaks
---
Sorry for how it appears on reddit but I don't know how to make it appear as a poem.
---
i also have a legendary one if you're interested. it's only lvl 35 though.
---
[https://imgur.com/PGAltON](https://imgur.com/PGAltON)
---
Sorry that happened to you but if you have friends in game use paper bags instead of world containers.
---
If your friend is 'browsing' the paper bag you have very good chances of keeping your loot bare a server crash.
---
World containers can and will reset. Do it enough times and eventually you will hit the negative jackpot.
---
Said that neither method is 100% fool-proof, hell, even regular trade using the trade menu is not immune to magically losing stuff into the void.
---
1st, Nice effort, info like this is helpful to many.
---
I beg to differ with you on your Uranium Fever Observation, as I have gotten a few max level weapons from there, but never when I'm there helping low level players, only when going solo, My primary Rifle (level 45 TSE Handmade) came from UF.
---
Early in the game most of the drops I got were Armor, including lots of max level 3\* Combat &amp; Metal, over time that has shifted to mostly ranged weapons, with heavy Melee weapons accounting for less than 5% of all legendary items I've looted.
---
I spend a lot of game time hunting Legendary Enemies, and have gotten my share (friends say I got their share too) of Epic rolls, including an Explosive Hunting Rifle just 3 hours after the patch that added them. 
---
WS is definitely my "Go to" area, but great rolls come from anywhere, even a Glowing ant in the middle of nowhere.
---
I'd just be happy with being able to make a campfire to cook meat in the field.  sucks running out of cooked meat, and having to scarf down raw meat just to fast travel back to camp to start cooking again.
---
Well, there is emotes for Angry, Thumbs Down, and the Finger Gun already in the game, so I'd say you can already emote that feeling. My vote is still on emotes for Shrug and Sorry, respectively.
---
I find killing glowing ones at the Whitespring pretty good. Also just doing quest, sides and daily, is good too.
---
Weapon degradation happens way to fast. I understood it on other fallouts cause weapons are old. However in 76 no weapon is really that old. Plus you can make them from scratch.When you go through basic training you are handed a rifle that an untold number of people have used before you and has a round count likely in the hundred thousand range. You can still reliably engage targets at over 200 yards.     I kind of wish they would move to a system like Metro, where it gets dirty and is there fore less reliable. Then cleaning in the field  with a consumable kit makes sense.  
---
Yeah, I’d like to see some concrete testing on this because my AA Tesla rifle chews through Whitspring ghouls faser than my shotgun that has a higher damage rating.
---
The Trident II is definitely not a "short-range" missile, with a maximum range of something like 7500 miles (exact range classified of course).  Like the LGM-30, Trident II has 3 solid-fueled stages and truly intercontinental range.
---
I think you meant SLBM, Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile.
---
It always turns north and south we found out. Just place it so that when you work on it that you are facing north, with your characters back to the south
---
Wonderful!
---
How about instead of a team camp you could have settlements.  More like workshops but persistent co-ops. A settlement would persist among settlement members and you could only belong to one settlement at a time. Settlements would spawn when any member logs in. Although it would be locked if two members were on different servers. Same mechanics as current camp space taken would exist. Settlements would almost be like a third party account with shared permissions. Settlement land area and budget would be dependent on membership with a membership limit(maybe 10). You would still keep your camp which could be separate (great for having as an actual mobile camp when u need a workbench/box/bed on the road). I suppose each settlement. Could have a mayor(overseer?) who could grant membership/build/edit/delete privileges. Would be a really cool thing to go with wasteland’s DLC. 
---
Don't you think a lack of content is what causes this? I haven't played in months but I keep seeing the same complaints on here. If white springs farming is still "the thing to do" I am disappointed.
---
they should allow the comb-over when that happens (LOL)
---
Glad you're aware of the bug, but what about your experience is inconsistent with or different from the other reports? Several "immortal" reports involve the SBQ's health only dropping inconsistently.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/au4an4/whats\_the\_point\_in\_spawning\_the\_scorchbeast\_queen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/au4an4/whats_the_point_in_spawning_the_scorchbeast_queen/)
---
I must be ancient.  49.  Loved the fallout series.  Wasnt to happy about the online with other people, but for the most part, mostly cool people.  Mostly.
---
I hope so. I used a gatling plasma for the first time today and it seems like a recent nice gun if it wasn't for the durability.
---
Thank you so much for the gold!
---
Yeah I’ll do that  thank you guys 
---
Takes me 0.1 second to kill a lvl 65 scorchbeast with a ranged sneak crit, don't know how badly you fucked up your character if it takes 10min at lvl 90.
---
But is there like a easy easy way with a lot of xp other than white springs and events?
---
I’m in the same boat as you, man. From what I’ve read, the Pleasant Valley station can spawn one. Go out on the loading dock, and there’ll be a skeleton laying on top of two suitcases. On the floor right by there (going south I think?) there’s a chance for random headgear to spawn. So far all I’ve found is a green hood, but...at least it means something is there. 
---
&gt; Do you have any data supporting that? 
---
This is a brand new hypothesis I plan to check in my subsequent 200 drops, thus I don't have data for it yet. 
---
&gt; Why would the engine make a difference between various ways to 'lose' an item? 
---
In addition, the reason for treating sells differently than drops or stores is that a mistake in selling is more costly than picking up a dropped item. It could be a probabilistic safety feature.
---
&gt; Do you really believe the devs would run *another* database to track what types of items you recently lost 
---
I'm pretty sure they track all sorts of character activity in the same database but dedicated log tables, especially for filtering out ToS violators.
---
&gt; Don't you think that check would have been the first to be culled, with the loot loading delays running rampant as they do? 
---
My experience is that loot missing from legendary enemies often show up on normal enemies a bit later. This is also very likely a workaround for the frequent client-server loot-desync bugs.
---
&gt; how to manipulate the stakes 
---
This is not about manipulating the stakes, it is about discovering inherent bias in the loot distribution based on some factors.
---
Also note that in the news about the upcoming Legendary Vendor, they talk about rerolling items and expect the outcome to be closer to what you want. Analizing that will be a fantastic opportunity.
---
I just lost my explosive shot lever action because the stupid glitchy UI jumps around when you're selling shit.
---
Didn't even notice until it was too late FML
---
Honestly the worst thing to come out of this game is the PvP, like I don’t care when I get killed by a fucking mutant or some shit, but as soon as a player kills me, rage levels off the rails. 
---
And god forbid you call them out in it because then you’re downvoted to hell. 
---
Also, there can never be *any* enjoyment of *any* aspect of the *entire game* because there was some bugs or game design choices someone hated. Stop pouring salt on my cereal. That comment contributes nothing to this conversation. 
---
No prob!
---
My man, I’d trade a T-51b jet pack for that at this point. 
---
My camp is up on a cliff somewhat near this silo and its fun to watch them launch. Its not the most convenient location other than that though.
---
Its heavy weapons and any gun that has explosive on it that imo are degrading so fast....I have an AAE handmade that I don't even USE instead I choose the one star AA handmade because it lasts twice as long...they nerfed tse weapons not only by lowering the damage of the 2nd shot but also the E with degradation and this applies to any gun with E
---
I recommend you farm Fort Defiance, allocate an hour to looting the left wing (one behind the metal doors with a button) and check the third floor very carefully especially.  Loot all the straight jackets you find to sell to vendors.  On a good day you'll walk away with 20 ballistic fibers and over 1k worth of caps in straight jackets.  Then you sell them to vendors to afford to buy bulk ballistic fibers they might be selling.
---
Those fibers are scarce, military grade duct tape and military ammo bags scrap for ballistic fibers.  I think many more things should like military and army fatigues, army helmet, and any decently modded equipment you craft or pickup should scrap for ballistic fibers even if just 1.
---
I hope you have fun and find the resources you're looking for!  If you're ever severely hurting you can look for the reddit fallout markets (there's a market and bazaar) and try to buy some from someone selling at a decent price.
---
Oh, just another bit of advice, ignore the Line in the Sand event when you approach Fort Defiance.
---
He was offered 5k caps more..it's not really that hard to understand
---
Happened to me at WS..I accepted the L
---
When large numbers of players get random drops, a portion of them will get very lucky or very unlucky or have a sequence of similar drops, by pure random chance.
---
Those players assume something weird is happening and run to reddit to post some theory bases solely on the infinitesimal fraction they've seen of all the random drops all players everywhere have gotten.
---
The vast majority of players that get a string of drops that appear random don't run to reddit to post about it.
---
Because of this, most reddit posts about loot drops include some repetition or pattern or something that made it remarkable and memorable.  Consensus builds that there MUST be some pattern to it all.
---
This is why casinos make money. People will stare at random noise and convince themselves there is a pattern. All the casino has to do is divert your attention to the small fraction of edge cases with bells and lights, and you'll think everybody is experience these rare events.
---
Reddit focuses your attention on unusual events in the same way. They will seem more common than they are.

Stealth Pistols build

dedicated PVP players commonly rock Sentinels and Assassins Armor (-75% less damage when standing still and -40% less from players) as well as the best weapons they can manage. level barely matters when it comes into static damage resists. they must be rocking level 25 or 30 gear with those prefixes
---
power armor in PVP is kind of a joke, due to no legendary prefixes. Damage rest is like rice paper vs a flamethrower when going against static % damage reduction. anti armor perks, or legendary prefixes melts power armor.
---
I can confirm that this doesn’t work. I *had* mine facing north, and every time I logged back in it was facing northwest. 
---
If he wasn't in power armor, he was probably stacking legendary effects like Assassins which each piece adds 8% damage reduction from players along with the sentinels (both can spawn on a single piece of gear).
---
that's my best guess, but I know that PVP is just unbalanced as it is anyways. 
---
A good perk to pair or replace white knight is Fix It Good intelligence perk, repair armor to 200% condition and gives bonus damage resistance while condition is above 200, drops back to normal as condition returns to 100.
---
He can play the bass guitar pretty well
---
Wow wtf didn’t know that, guess people have fun doing that then 💀
---
PvP definitely seems buggy sometimes. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on what the conditions for initiating PvP are and the nuances of the PvP system, but I've definitely been in situations where I was hitting someone and not doing any damage and felt it was probably due to a bug. Mainly because in each of those situations I knew the person didn't have sentinel/assassin's gear and I had already killed them a few times during a back and forth battle over a workshop.
---
At the bottom of each comment (and original post), there is a line of options "Reply, Give Award, Share, Report, Save" ... click the "Report" link.
---
Yeah, mostly. And when it comes to online gaming, anyone over 25 is ancient. If you're on PS4 and ever want to team up with a normal adult, hit me up.
---
Is that the one you get in the basement of the mothman museum? Or does that one have hoses too?
---
I don't remember too well, but I know we get one with hoses from Rose's quest line, and when I went to the mothman basement, it was a different hood. May have been straps and not hoses though. I just remember it being different.
---
Ya same here
---
So what you are saying....i can gaurantee a sale with one person, keep selling the item to see if i can make more.  5k caps i have, but this is totally unethical. 
---
I discovered an easy solution to the over level 100+ boredom problem: start a new character.
---
I started a mule, and wanted to level it up for extra carry weight - now  up level 40, and have been having the most fun since the first couple weeks of launch. 
---
Also - this character is going to be the one I keep building new CAMPS with - my main is the one I built the theater on, and I refuse to move.
---
Then The Trumpinator moseys into the nuke zone and two punches the sbq, ending North Korean Godzilla's reign of screeches and moseys on out like a smooth criminal.
---
&lt;-&lt;
---
That would be great. I will play it.
---
If they could make the player interaction of ESO more like fo76, I'd relook. I hard to mess with other players. "ignore" options. Etc.
---
Why I cry: The 5th time I was exploring and had some random player run through my area screaming profanity I was done. I've never been back.
---
Had 3000 odd saved up and blew it all on the mothman PA skin, statue and a few new camp flooring patterns. 
---
That was kind’ve a long winded way of saying “I think it’s bullshit,” to put it bluntly. I was trying to get an explanation of how some people have speculated it works.
---
As far as I’m concerned, if it’s just about playing the odds then all you can do is get more rolls.
---
Sorry.  Old school.  Its my PC or nintendo 64.  Lol.  Thanks for the offer.  I would have definitely teamed up.
---
Swap pack-rat for bandolier. Carrying a lot of junk is a great way to lose a lot of junk.
---
Thanks soo much!
---
You dont really have to bug your friend. Just go to whitesprings and drop stuff off. Join that server again where you friend is and pick your stuff up. 
---
Your not wrong tho. 
---
It's gonna be sheeptaur all over again (shudders from boss fight flash backs)
---
Golf course @ whitesprings and nuke zones are your best bet
---
I dont think you understand what photo bombing is :)
---
Fallout 76 as of right now, has the distinction of being the *worst reviewed/most played* title I have ever sunk time into.
---
With that recently revealed road map, I don't see myself stopping this year.
---
I would love to see her fly somewhere random on the map. Imagine your surprise when you're in Morgantown and the SBQ shows up to mess up your day?
---
I don't use pistols i prefer rifles and i have a bloodied combat rifle already can i do stealth with the rifle?
---
Ohhh, I miss my old Watermelon Pink N64... I've got Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and Star Fox 64 on 3DS tho, so it's not all bad ;)
---
Alright then thanks y’all 
---
Then REALLY never worry about ever needing to repair any shotgun at ALL!  Negate that bullshit mechanic entirely while everyone else can go get fucked trying to use other weapons and have fun!
---
MARIO KART!
---
&gt; On the plus side they finally updated awareness to reflect the armor piercing magazines. 
---
Does this mean melee mods will work with awareness also? 
---
Those reports did not mention other factions showing up so I can't know if that was a factor in their case or not. Also " The entire server shows " is often a bad sign because her health, in my experience, scales linearly with the number of players. However, the damage output in air/ground usually does not scale at that rate. I've been in fights where I only spent 1k rounds on her to win, in others it took 2.5k to win, yet another one failed after 5k rounds. Same gun/perks on my part.
---
If I was the script dev for the queen, I'd look into the scaling logic and check if the scaling factor is computed from all nearby enemy factions or just the nearby human players.
---
I was going to say the same thing but Metro Exodus did it first so I thought Fo76 would get flack for "copying".
---
Doesnt she have 300 resist of every type? 
---
Taking from a dead players bag within 10 minutes of it dropping should firstly say:
---
'Steal from', and it should warn other players that 'currently taking from this bag will be counted as a hostile move against %this players name% and will make you become Wanted'.
---
If the bag has been sitting there for over 10 minutes, it's fair game.
---
Maybe 15 or 20 minutes, it's debatable.
---
200 DR, 300 ER, immune to rads
---
We all did that, I managed.
---
Besides backpacks will be late game content anyway
---
Pretty sure she has 300 DR also. 
---
Our friends at Vault Tec have kindly supplied us with their advanced targeting system VATS. It even detects invisible bee swarms. Prepared for the future!
---
If you're not well equipped, Whitesprings is probably the best place for XP and loot. The absolute best places for XP are locations Super Mutants congregate--West Tek is probably the best spot. Of course, it can be difficult.
---
Unless you've got a strong build, Whitesprings, nuke zones, events, and workshops are your best bet and you can do many at the same time. For example, take a workshop (even if you're not going to use it), fast travel to Whitesprings/event, allow the enemies to take said workshop, get done with WS/event, FT back to workshop and kill enemies. Rinse, repeat. Be forewarned, if you do not intend on using the workshop, pick one that's not terribly popular. If you take the Munitions factory, there's a good chance someone will take it from you if they need it.
---
If you spawn at the Top of the World, head NE through 'town' towards Seneca Rocks. There are several buildings with plans and a ton of mobs along the way. Unless mutants spawn, they are easier (mole miners, scorched) and the whole trip can yield a decent amount of XP.
---
Anytime someone nukes Whitesprings, you should be there tagging the enemies. That's about as easy as it gets. You can do 'the loop' about 3 times, or just follow a group around tagging enemies. Most people don't care; they know what you're there for. Just don't grenade everything and blow the bodies all over the place.
---
Don't forget to sleep and if you can find the Cranberry Relish recipe (random loot/WS shop), that will help a bunch as well.
---
It’s workable, you just have to support it heavily and be aware it’s basically always worse than a non-pistols build. For a lot of enemies you can compensate, but things like SB can be rough.
---
For comparison, my Adrenal Reaction/Nerd Rage build with an AA 10mm, 3 1star pistol perks, and stealth/vats perks can take out 68 supermutants Reasonably well as long as I’m getting sneak headshot hits. Once I’m not getting sneak hits it takes quite a few more shots. 
---
In which world is a level 90+ toon a newbie? 
---
would have been funnier if you where crafting .50 cal or 5mm rounds
---
How much ammo are you using? I was lvl 53 a few nights ago when I went to try and kill one for the first time to prepare for BotB, and my first solo one took about 8 minutes and maybe 50 rounds between handmade and shotgun, no legendaries or V.A.T.S. bonuses. Maybe another 100 for the scorched that spawned with it. When I killed the one in the cavern, it was one gauss round to the face and 33 from the handmade. Though they were almost all sneak attacks.
---
Loot was absolute crap though. I got better loot off the creature corpses in the cavern.
---
The protectrons around watoga are easy xp plus decent legendary chance! Also big bend tunnel too.
---
Dude don't take this the wrong way..but it most likely took u a couple of days to farm the caps..if u think about it..would u accept a lower offer? I placed a bid last night and said I might have enough caps in a few days..if it is gone by then I really don't care because business is business ..I'm just saying..u created a thread..I was expecting something serious..but not really seeing that..this is more of a lesson-learned type thing
---
Take all your armor pen perks off and VATS her with awareness on. 
---
On PC I run a "Gun and Pawn" on my main, basically Ill buy your scrap for caps and craft you guns for breaking down for mods, low level alts, etc. (I have almost every gun recipe).
---
Had a fresh 50 a few days ago ask me to make him some western revolvers to break down, he was trying to unlock the scope, no biggie, scrap and caps exchanges and a batch was whipped up.
---
I go to trade them to him and he refused to take them and instead requested every single legendary pistol I had. Mind you these are not shop inventory, these are my personal weapons and as a pistol build it is advantageous to have a few different kinds for different situations. 
---
I refused the trade and dumped his pistols on the ground and explained those were my personal weapons and the pros and cons of pistol builds. He went ballistic on area chat screaming I was a duper and I should *give* him my pistols since "I can make my own" and "Only a duper has more than one legendary gun" wut?
---
Typical threats of reporting and banning etc. I blocked him. Half expected him to start trying to grief my camp but he logged off. I just took the guns I crafted and vendored them. Came out ahead in the end on scrap.
---
Some players I have encountered behave like entitled children. As an older gamer (born in the 70s) I feel like a phrase from the David Tennant era of Doctor Who applies to these winners "It's has been a very long time since someone has told you 'no' hasn't it?" 
---
Yeah, bunch of salty bitches can't stand losing 4 aluminum and 20 wood. Get it together guys.
---
Weapon mods work on the queen now tho. So you gotta use a weapon without a armor piercing mod to. 
---
you didnt get a single unyielding armor piece?  i get them all the time
---
I tried the and it didn't Target them but they could've been behind me at the time.
---
The stages should fall back and be lootable. For metal, circuitry, fuel, etc. 
---
I have some weapons i could trade for the bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
There are ways to make power armor based bloodbuild thats effective in PvP, albeit it aint a common knowledge yet. We had a 3v3 PvP once and our team had assasin sentinel, assasin cavalier, and our experimental bloodbuild powerarmor. The PA guy was actually one of the thoughest, as its about 60-70% of full sentinel defensive capabilities, but without any conditional requirements (besides lowhp, I mean that you can stay, you can walk, you can run, you can crouch - it will always be active).
---
In my collection I have one piece of level 20 cavalier gear. I'm trying to get four more and a low level explosive/vats crit weapon, and I'm planning to build a character just as you described.
---
I do not, however, want to use it against casual players. It will be my toy to troll the trolls and grief the griefers.
---
they could grant lung, throat, teeth based diseases and addiction. different ones would make you harder to detect vs animals (because you smell like smoke instead of human), increased AP regen, increased max AP, or a temporary bonus to Agility.
---
the addiction could lower your Agility by 2 or lower max AP by 30 until you smoke again
---
I'm on ps4 btw for got to mention but sure or it you wanna do caps
---
Just unequip your weapon so you’re only using your mitts. Make sure you’re out of PA and don’t have weight mods on your arm pieces. Easy enough. 
---
There was a post about this long ago when the game launched with screen shots. You could do it the way I described or just search the sub. I VATS her with awareness when I was testing endangerol and karma and it was pretty clear that she was more resistant to energy weapons
---
Yea i know, i run a bloodied build. Ive had it for months now im so friggin useless with it not working, but everyone is back and forth saying resetting your mutations works or it doesnt 
---
If you’re on PC, I can do serums for 100 caps each. Otherwise...have fun with the RNG gods. 
---
Hmm. It works that way for my friend and I. I'm not sure then
---
Looked at another way - even if EVERY scorchbeast dropped a guaranteed legendary, it would still be far slower to farm them than it is to farm Whitesprings.
---
Haven't heard or seen anything. I saw a post where the community managers were praising one of the builds that used it so I don't think so.
---
The only problem with that is, like in my case, none of my friends play the game at all anymore. So I have to rejoin the same lobby without a friend in the lobby? That isn't possible, because Bethesda don't have a "rejoin last server" option, which would be a good thing to have too
---
I'm level 206, 800 hours played. I've killed the queen numerous times and swore she had 300,300.  I'm gonna confirm right now once i nuke. 
---
I have a mule with caps as well.  Either way, i had it.  But i was holding stuff to trade for this particular item.  If they only wanted caps, this was a win, win for me.  I free up inventory space and i dont need to jockey back a forth with mule.  Just more work on my side.  As i mentioned, i would not offer what i could get.  
---
Any photo id evidence to help us be on the look out?
---
I am not taking it the wrong way.  I guess i needed to clarify. 
---
Do you remember seeing Gutsies, Protectrons, Super Mutants or non-scorched enemies show up to the fight? My last  2 queen fights since P6 on PC failed and as far as I remember, the queen took way less damage after seeing some gutsies and other robots spawn near the shed. Also worth checking if Cesus Violence triggers for one of the nearby locations if that spawed some other type of enemy.
---
I’m willing to admit I’m wrong, but I’m gonna ask for screenshots 
---
"Easy" idea would be a "join last server" function. So i can drop stuff somewhere and pick it up with my alt.
---
It's not fixed but it's just a visual bug. 
---
If you do in, sell something then decide to cancel and back out of the trader window and then go back in, it should show 200 Caps. 
---
Also it's 20 hours IRL time from your first visit after the reset. 
---
That helmet is so ugly with the rest of the PA 
---
thanks... was getting worried :D
---
there are atleast 4 sentry bots at whitesprings, they always drop fusion cores.  A loop takes 5 minutes and i get 4 cores.  when im done i go to a new server to get rid of the whitespring guards aggro.
---
Normally its Bulk Junk and Aid (I have a large farm) but it's 1000 Caps from 5 different vendors. 
---
I've never noticed Colonel Gutsy being OP because I've lived in PA since level 30. He doesn't seem to chew through PA at all from what I've seen, I dont think I've ever died to one.

I dont think i have to get it myself. Theres a screenshot in here with a 300/300 like i was suggesting. 
---
How much time passed between your offer to when he rescinded?
---
I did, but it wasn't dominant: *Unyielding*, 11 of 413,  2.66% of all drops. Half of them from Whitesprings.
---
Yes, you can find shotguns at that level. I have a level 10 2 shot pump shotgun on my low level alt.
---
I just gave in and bought a second account. It's made this game infinitely more fun to have a never ending stash and be able to keep an alt in a game and rejoin the same game.
---
The Carnivore bug appears to have been fixed. I was able to obtain the Electrically Charged mutation after applying the Carnivore serum without a problem. Also, with regard to a previous note about Electrically Charged, I was next to another player when it went off and it did not make me hostile/wanted to the other player so I think it's safe to use in melee while in Pacifist mode.
---
Let me look at my pictures.
---
Aye, I situated myself away from water on top of a lead deposit so I can't farm water effectively. I guess all I'm left with is food farming for profit. 
---
when he doesn't know about the sentinel effect.. lol
---
The next question is whether stabilized lowers both resistances or just DR. 
---
Yes i know, i run a bloodied build keepung my hp below 20%, but last patch it fucked up the adrenal mutation if you had it pre patch all it does is the negative effects 
---
question: how long did you take to log out, change characters, and then try the world container?  ive done it this was many times and would also be freaked if i lost my stuff..
---
did you have your friend waiting by the container? 
---
are you sure your friend didnt take it?
---
This.
---
I'm not sure. Lemme go up to something random in game real quick and check. Im a heavy gunner man. 
---
Yes go to Tyler Fairgrounds north of Vault 76
---
A spear?....... LOL
---
Deal seales around 10:34am.  Games started around 3pm.  I did not see any of this until 9:00PM.  I put a link below my original comment.
---
nonsense, caps don't become easier or harder to gain because of a cap
---
however a cap means you can never sell for a value higher than the difference between the cap and your owned caps
---
i would love this, i dont trust world boxes to dump stuff in,a nd hate bothering what few friends i have on to help me transfer stuff as the loading screens take forever
---
most mmo's have some sort of post office system to transfer stuff between characters
---
Look for a event called LEADER OF THE PACK that’s a low level event it’ll give you armor and weapons related to your low level
---
so you have an extra ps4/xbox or how does this work?
---
Try and always do the leader of the pack events. Those always drop low level legendaries. I have gotten a level 5 Instigating Pump Action a couple times. 
---
lmao I have almost 200 stimpacks and have probably sold 100 already
---
You're welcome :)
---
Wait, how do you put floor tiles for your roof? All the stupid "object must snap, or object is floating", or all that stupid shit? 
---
Best armor for sneak effectiveness?
---
WEIGHTLESS + Ultralight mod + Chameleon Mutation
---
I have good luck with horde events or uranium fever and breach and clear. If you go to the mire gulpers dish out a lot of xp. Oh and I he one violent night event! 
---
Ok i can confirm that unlocking crafting components is directly linked to the items you’ve scrapped. Picked up two Handmades yesterday, one had a short stabilizing barrel the other had a large bayonet attached. Immediately when I scrapped them, those two components were unlocked. So it means scrapping a hundred barebone weapons of the same type doesn’t do anything, but if some of them had the right attachment, you get to unlock them right upon scrapping them. I actually bought the Handmade plan and thought I could make 100 of them and scrap them all to unlock all of the components, glad I haven’t had the time to do that because it won’t work 😂
---
&gt;  Uranium Fever  \[...\] I have gotten a few max level weapons from there 
---
One of the patches fixed Uranium Fever so the lvl 40 Mole Miners can no longer drop items above their level. This list started on February 14, after Patch 5.
---
&gt; Epic rolls, including an Explosive Hunting Rifle 
---
Unless you got another explosive weapon or different legendary hunting rifle soon after this, there is no way to tell you were just one-time lucky or encountered a streak/pattern for your character/server/location/etc.
---
I got my two best explosive weapons, a Lever Rifle and a Pump Action shotgun on subsequent days on two different servers 3 days before Patch 5. I had a blast with them, yet I can't say I'm flooded with either explosives, lever rifles or shotguns in general. On the contrary.
---
Just grab a power plant as soon as you long in. You'll probably accumulate 12+ 100% cores per play session.
---
Your gamer tag in FO76 is primerush, like your username here in Reddit?
---
I don’t know or do exploits.  I carry what I find and break down.
---
This is like what most people who don’t know how to min/max actually do, so it’s a problem.
---
I didn’t even realize anyone did differently until you posted above, but even then, this DOES NOT change how badlythe horrid inventory/weight problems they’ve artificially imposed effect normal players.
---
I dont want to wait so long for player vending 😭
---
Pistols need gunslingers perks.  Sneak works good, but chameleon armor helps alot.  Chameleon mutation is better, but you are limited to weightless armor.  Youtube this.   They explain how effective they are.  I have this exact build.  Mutation, sniper.  I dont use the main sneak perk since i am already chameleon. 
---
I would happily take that also! :O
---
Ah that sucks. I just got it a couple days ago, so I guess I missed out on that!
---
Nah unlikely its a building glitch
---
yeah happened to me this weekend at whitesprings 
---
Thanks for the great info. I feel like the game a bit of ESP working. It seems to know what affix I am looking for and drops it to the lowest %. :-)
---
Wouldn't be Wasteland Campowners Association?
---
I'd also like to grab speed demon 
---
exactly, claptraps stash was legit
---
Ok I just read everything..he said he got a higher offer about 3 hours later..then an hour later it went up..it's unfortunate u couldn't pay him right away
---
I don't know what's been up but people have been wild lately. Everyone has been randomly pvping and more jerks then normal for 76. 
---
When I'm sneaking with my crossbow or a deathclaw I can walk right in front of a super mutant but if I'm holding my handmade they seem to spot me from a mile away. Also switching weapons seems to blow my cover from a mile away also.
---
Its just DR. No ER from what i can see. Even Anti-Armor is not applying to ER. 
---
Time to report a bug. 
---
They can bud they can...
---
Melee and shotguns synergies better as shotgun perks are in strength. With rifles, you will need a lot of perception and if you go vats, agility and luck. 
---
I started shotgun/melee and then switched to vats rifle and had to dropped the others.
---
Non-PA user here.  Agree, he hits like a truck.
---
Unpopular opinion: More things should hit like a truck.
---
Which platform?
---
One of if not the coolest thing I've seen in Fallout 76 so far...that's awesome
---
I’m on Xbox and I find that I have too much shotgun ammo..killing scorched - they always seem to have shotgun ammo ..but if you really want to go with rifles just put more into Perception 
---
If you are on PC, I know a guy that can put the shocks on it for you. It's cheaper if you bring your own flux.
---
Don't forget to get well rested and well tuned often for the xp buff
---
I mean, I’m technically not wrong then, am I? If the only armor pen you can get applies to DR and not ER, then ballistic heavy weapons are better than energy heavy weapons. Thank you for checking this though. It’s great to know this is broken and not intended
---
I run two hand melee/auto rifle &amp; I don't have to swap cards. Rifle perks are in perception so it works out well. I've got 15 in S, 12 in P (but u could get away with less). I like to run Max cards - tanker killer and all 3 auto rifle cards maxed. 
---
OMG. THIS! :D  
---
Or maybe a couple smaller turrets? Great idea. Reminds me of a micro "minion master" style approach.
---
Monster mash is good for experience. Do it with a team or a high level person and focus on the ghouls and legendaries.
---
I've certainly had the "pop-pop" what the hell I'm dead? Thing happen. 
---
PS4. Is actually recording my gameplay so I've got video of them doing that and much more to me. If I was a new player I probably would have been turned off. They had set up a troll camp right by that intersection and were trying to kill new players outside of PvP.
---
Some of the people, yes... they probably are in the 3rd grade. I've run into more than a few characters with "xxxchickslayer69" type of gamertags, and on mic I hear them being yelled at by a parent to brush his teeth and take out the garbage.
---
When I see a teabagger, I just assume that they still have undescended testicles.
---
Agreed and agreed. He's fierce, and I like the challenge.
---
Some questions, like "ELI5, how does dowsing work?" need to be answered bluntly, i.e. "It doesn't. It's bullshit, but here's a longer explanation of why people believe in it."
---
The "server seed" theory is based on a misunderstanding of how pseudo-random generators work. That's all there is to it.
---
Yeah your right about the DR weapons. Wrong about the Queen DR. 
---
This is crazy news. Glad i have been using my Miniguns and 50cal's when i do the Queen. All though my energy weapons seem to still do more damage despite what the Awareness perk says. It could just be a ui bug. I need to do some testing. 
---
Do you even realise that this sounds like another “enemy x is hard, so please change it” post?
---
It seems that “balance” is the new “QoL”: Thinly-veiled requests to dumb down the difficulty. 
---
I agree. I ventured out to Spruce Knob for the first time last night, alone, and was caught in the middle of 3 level 80 scorch beasts (and little ole me being only 56 at the time). I was relatively low on ammo (blew through 500 rounds of .45, almost 1000 5.56, and around 10-20 2mm ec), and luckily my recently picked up All Rise was at full condition. Had to run around and kite a bit to get them to land one at a time so I could take some swings at them and save ammo.
---
Longest hour of my life.
---
What did I get for all my trouble? Pretty much just some roast scorchbeast, lung, and brain. I think ONE had 6 pieces of black titanium on them.
---
Over 4 hours later, still trying to sell item it seems.  Instead of saying its sold, he kept it open for discussion.
---
That's weird cause I picked one up off a skeleton. When I did it spawned a whole other skeleton with another cowboy hat jutting out of the first like siamese twins. 
---
Or more like this is a fun game and your expectations were too high. This game is exactly what it’s supposed to be. An online fallout game. I’ve been playing for a couple weeks now and I’ve been disconnected maybe 2 or 3 times. The only bug I’ve come across is enemies floating/falling sometimes after I kill them. The game is just fine. People just like to bitch.
---
I'd say Whitesprings is your best bet for anything. It seems to have the full range of prefixes that are possible, and although biased towards some, the legendary density just makes it the most economic place to farm. If you have friends, you can even trigger respawn by rejoining on them.
---
Also now with the icons it just alerts people to you being accessable to pvp damage. So now till survival mode anyone with a workshop is going to get pvp attention. 
---
Oh yea it sucks lmao
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
&gt;When I see a teabagger, I just assume that they still have undescended testicles.
---
Ha!
---
Invisible assaultrons would like to have a word with your guttsy. Mirelurk  queens are also no joke. That acid attack is deadly. A large group of super mutants passing around 2 mini guns will also hurt.
---
These do stand out, but that's a good thing. Most of the mobs are pretty weak. I think any problem here is how week most enemies are, so when you find one appropriately difficult it seems "too hard"
---
Also robots are very environmentally vulnerable. Hacked turrets, exploding cars etc. Every class has weak points.
---
Oh ok if that was a tactic he was using ..that is wrong..sorry man..do u know if he actually got rid of it
---
I don't think that's a concern.
---
Have you seen what Demons look like in Exodus now? They could just be Scorchbeasts without the Ultracite.
---
Oh wow, I've had my camp the closest possible to that silo to try and snap good pictures, looks like I've been doing it wrong!
---
Might have to move back to my old spot overlooking the big satellite dishes.. 
---
Yup. A spear. It's actually pretty beast with the swing speed. Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not.....
---
Why are these replies coming to me? I was defending the developers, not bitching about the game.
---
Can I play this game too?
---
My character has been active almost daily since January. I play pretty casual (solo) but spend a lot of time in higher populated areas like Whitespring. To date I've had ***two*** bad interactions with other players. One of those interactions ended up flipping back around, because all the dude wanted was someone to clear his bounty; he was just being a dick about it.
---
Most of the time when I see another player they are just off doing their own thing.  Or in situations like Whitesprings they'll pop in and help me kill that obnoxious Legendary Diseased OMFG Just Won't Die Radscorpion because they too want a chance at a cool item to drop.
---
I’ll take my wins where I can. But srs this needs to be brought to their attention if they’re considering rebalancing energy weapons. What sense does it make to buff them to bring them up to par with ballistics if they just have to re-balance again on account of armor pen?
---
I take your point but some of the reports in that thread involved smaller groups. They weren't all "the entire server" of the OP. Related though, which platform are you on?   
---
So you thought the queen was taking consistent damage over the entire 30 minutes, but at a rate corresponding with twice-as-many players present? That makes sense, but is that consistent with only dealing 5% damage over 30 minutes? Perhaps the queen also has an issue with non-arithmetic scaling? 
---
Regardless of the finer points, I hope they do take a second (or third) look into scaling. There seems to be lots of issues. Thanks for clarifying. 
---
Fkn A. There are too many players trying to adjust difficulty by way of complaint
---
I’m not sure what game you’ve been playing lol
---
&gt;straight jackets
---
Didn't know they were a thing :/ 
---
Thanks for the advice, saved your post for reference, appreciate the help :)
---
Not unpopular with me. Spot on IMO
---
I have a rifleman build. I’ve had supers walk right up to me without detecting me while using my silenced lever action 
---
As of last night, i stopped communicating with him.  He said he still had it.  Its about principle that i wont pay the additional.   You can see he started playing games towards the end.
---
I'm on PC - I just run two logins of FO76 on my single computer in borderless windowed mode and alt-tab between them. If you go into the FO76 folder and open it using the Fallout76.exe file, it prompts you for your account login. So I just have a shortcut to that on my desktop, run it once, log in with main account, run it again, log in with second account, join parties, then do "play as team" to find a suitable world that has multiple open slots.
---
I just started an alt, and this is already a glaring issue. I'd like to twink out my alt with recipes and leveling gear at least, caps and eventually legendaries.
---
I wonder how that works for things like workshops. I mean I do get that it's unlikely to be put in a world with a given person by chance, but if you are and you've taken a workshop what does the blocked person see, I wonder.
---
I'd totally be up for helping to organize this on Xbox! 
---
One that you have to do a quest, assigned by a small annoying robot. Perhaps to go find brown rocks.
---
LOL.....I wasn't sure if you were trolling the OP or not.
---
You can get 3* Spears all day long at the Whitespring even if it hasn't been nuked. Prime receivers are useless and ultracite mods are pretty useless also because nobody runs ultracite power armor.
---
That loot is extremely lackluster for endgame. You couldn't sell any of that if you wanted to.
---
I can confirm that there are ways to put somebody in a limbo state where they cannot actually damage you until they seek revenge on you, and you need to kill them twice before they will be able to shoot back. This is a bug of such severity that it destroyed my gang - ALL of our people stopped playing after we encountered some pieces of shit that were exploiting this particular bug as their way to 'PvP'. This was so infuriating that all of my people ceased playing saying they will come back only when there will be a possibility of playing without the shitty slap damage, aka survival, so that they will be able to KoS anybody they see. Also, we were PvPers before, now we are raiders, we lost all the good we had for the community and now consider every other player an enemy, so infuriated we were for that bug. I strongly suggest picking out survival servers where you can't see my nickname in the map.
---
I do not want to share the details on what has to be done to trigger this bug publicly. I believe people should receive permanent bounty for abusing it, because if you need to cheat to fight, you deserve to be shot by everybody without ability to shoot back until you were shot first.
---
 My advice is that if your enemies have their camp nearby and are shooting at you from their camps and ONLY while being at their camps, for 90% they are looser pieces of shit, block them and leave server. I am open for attempts of reproducing the bug privately for Bethesda employees to help addressing it.
---
My bunch of people who all left this game waiting for survival mode were not beginners. We didn't have pacifist mode turned on because we never turn it on. There were no workshops included in those fights. We are talking about group of people having god-builds, god-items, actively researching the game, having some build-related unique secrets on our disposal, extremely knowledgable in PvP. Hell, we know how to catapult people across heavy distances utilising an unknown property of bloodied weapons, thats kind of benchmark for the level of our research. Myself I am a professional software tester and I bet all my professional reputation that this is indeed a bug. It wasn't also that they had some good gear we did not understood. We have no problems with killing anyone, irrespective of their builds, we have a tool for each of the meta enemies. When the bug appeared, we allowed ourselves to be killed, then allowed ourselves to be killed again this time being able to seek revenge properly, we were decimating those pricks without any issue, until they stopped taking revenge, triggered the bug again, and then somehow initiated fights back but with us being unable to land any damage.
---
Don't think they need adjustments, they aren't that hard to kill. Sprinting power attacks, med x, power armor. There's ways to deal with them. 
---
Just cause it's hard doesn't mean they're broken. 
---
Dropping your junk is actually the only penalty for death at this point. I think if you were allowed to simply kill the other player and get your stuff back there would be zero penalty for dying. 
---
I know it sucks, as I have had lots of stuff taken. I would like higher loot/xp areas where you dropped even more on death but, eh, that's just me.
---
I would be ok if we could just choose a tab and only show the type of stuff.
---
Oh. wait.
---
I got calibrated shocks for x-01 power armor....only allowed me to do one leg....so there's that
---
Why did you not just give stuff to your friends.....
---
This is the sort of thing that they'd just break the functionality of the thing way before they went around banning folks.
---
Pvp just doesn’t work on this game engine.
---
Fallout is not fortnite.
---
Fallout will never be fortnite, so stop trying Bethesda.
---
Pvp players have never been big fallout people in general, from what I’ve seen.
---
Fallout is a great SINGLE player game with emphasis on grabbing a ton of shit while you explore and quest- THIS is what fallout people want.
---
Fallout people and Pvp players are like oil and water. This shit doesn’t mix and both are getting pissed.
---
This is the basic issue. Bethesda boardroom schmucks wanted to grab fortnite cash and ruined a fallout game in development to rush it out in this half assed, square peg in round hole fashion, hoping we’d buy into that shit. 
---
We obviously didn’t.  
---
The fact that many fallout fans are still around this long attests more to Troikas ability to come up with an amazing game world concept and it’s endearing effect rather than any “amazing” playability of Bethesda’s ancient, crippled, and mostly nonfunctional game engine.
---
* as to to your one shot issues, remember they only half ass fixed Bobbleheads stacking.  Melee ones still stack infinitely, and a duper using ones from his loaded accounts,can hit you for enough damage to one shot the queen ten times over.
---
Sure the game has some positives it just has a lot more negatives, and I'm sure as hell not going to ignore glaring problems this game has.
---
Mayor for a day was really challenging because of the spawn rate of the gutsys. I liked it that way. Made it feel worthwhile after completing it.
---
Always nice when the folks at HQ chime in. :)
---
Wait until I post the highlight video today. I'm not kidding when I say it was hilarious. Everyone got so involved, tons of comradery and laughs in this beautiful irradiated nightmare world you built us. Here's the question list from last night so you get an idea of how much our HOA Members needed to know about 76 to get paid:
---
Name all 5 currently known Vaults in Appalachia? 
---
Name 5 of the 6 known regions in 76? 
---
What was the name of the Overseers lover?
---
Name the 7 character traits that make up the SPECIAL system? 
---
Which of the following items is listed as having the highest cap value: Skeleton Halloween costume , Space Suit , or Straight Jacket 
---
Name the 6 creatures in 76 that start with rad.
---
Which of these 3 locations is furthest north in Appalachia: Tyler County Fair Grounds, Eastern Regional Pen, Vault 76
---
U can melee 99% of a silo in power armour, there are 2 turrets in the final room that are easiest if sniped. Just take plenty of stimpacks and some fury/psycho. I've only done 3 runs solo but the last one I used the above method with 3 heavy melee weapons and I saved a shit ton of ammo.
---
just add me usually on at random times
---
Same bro. Saaaaame
---
Well, you still can present your greetings to the host of the party by blowing up all nearby cars as part of your entrance performance
---
Same for me with my silenced lever but for some reason they spot that silenced handmade..... maybe because it's a mutant slayer.
---
We've already held 2 open mic nights, and both were totally lolz. :)
---
That's maybe a few hours of normal play looting everything you find, and then three vendor runs that take about 15 minutes each across three different days. In total, maybe 3-4 hours of work. That's actually less total time than it will take to get the 10 mutations you absolutely want through with none of the ones you really don't want through random add/remove. I ended up taking 5 hours to get all 18 (of 19) and then randomly removing and adding until Empath was gone. And I got lucky and Empath removed on my fifth try.
---
You're a dandy for saying so! :)
---
\---&gt;"SECRET"&lt;--- Area
---
its the questline area where u need the key holotape to enter it, its not realy a secret, its only called that way cause in there is the "SECRET" about what west tek was doing there ;)
---
Ah 
---
Lmao. You're a pric aintcha.I use ultracite power armor. I think the spear is great. And I rarely pull anything more than a 1* from whitesprings. But, hey, if you wanna run around in all your bought gear that matches everyone else playing the game, more power to you. I've only bought mutation serums on pc as I didn't wanna do like I did on Xbox and trade all the fun outta the game. What is there to do when you own all the overpowered shit?
---
we also need the minigun, gatling laser, and gatling plasma durability fixed
---
Cause if its at 100 already it’s broke yet ;)

Damn, PC too! That shits crazy

I REALLY want to see the blackbird paint come up in this spring cleaning sale. I fully expect to see it again by the end of April though
---
Sandra Bullock 
---
Interesting... So this is allowed, right? Like I'm not gonna get banned for this am I?
---
Quick question, did you jump server after every loop of locations? I tried a very small scale version of this looking only at legendary frequency, I wrote off the data as it was skewed because I was not jumping servers and looping around every 45 minutes and the same amount of legendaries (not same * level)  spawned. 
---
E.g 5 legendaries spwan at White springs, the next time they spawn in the server there will 5 legendaries again.
---
 The take away from my test was that if you found a loaded server (lots of legendaries at each location) , stay on it.
---
 Either way great work, very interesting. (Instagating seems to be my biased loot) 
---
Is it weird that I'd be less pissed if I just lost all my junk to the void on death than if it gets looted by another player? I do agree that death should have a more severe penalty, but for a game that seems to discourage pvp so heavily, this kinda bugs me. Honestly, it makes me want to be a jerk and discourage people from being around me, ever. I'll just take my 2 accounts and take over a server and hope everyone leaves so I don't have to deal with other people. It's far more efficient for me to farm that way anyway. That kind of mindset shouldn't be encouraged IMO, in a game that's supposed to be about joining up in a team.
---
Wow! Super cool. 
---
Now you need to put it on and try and sell all your pilfered guns to the British.
---
Borderlands 2 did this concept years ago and I would love to see it in FO76!
---
If u have some fusion cores spare I might be able to buy a few to get me started
---
Maybe not just one, but even in T-51b, I notice when multiple Colonel Gutsy are trying to chew through my PA. While I'm fine with one enemy being able to threaten me, I find it strange that he's more dangerous than anything else in the game. 
---
Yeah obviously i know we can sort by type in the tabs, why don't you try sorting 40 power armor chassis? I'm trying to run a business here!
---
Yeah don't even consider it..if he was lying that's terrible
---
I have seen a pompadour wig but not a powered one.
---
can you post an image and where did you find it?
---
Don’t worry, it’ll be fixed before launch 
---
This is just begging to get mini nuked 
---
I looked it up before doing it, yes it's allowed by ToS. However, one thing to keep in mind - it seems that Bethesda may be banning based on "number of acquired rare items", so if you do a lot of muling, it may be possible to trigger a false positive. Say if you're muling 10,000 ultracite rounds back and forth between accounts 10 times over the course of a month, that could get you banned. I've been really careful never to have too much ultracite ammo, and I avoid crafting it for this purpose.
---
It should.  No item in the shop should only be up for a day.  It's perhaps the WORST decision Bethesda has made the Atom Shop.
---
Oh ok! Yeah I follow you.” Now. 
---
I would love to see this added, along with a go to hell emote (point down emphatically) and who doesn't love some naughty nightwear/sexy sleepwear?
---
On ripper its bugged
---
We need this feature.  Bethesda! put a guy on this please :D
---
Yea I thought he was talking about the pompadour wig which is already rare. 
---
You are wrong, it's okay, but you're wrong.  A lot of people get confused looking in the Atom Shop and seeing something you previously bought and think it's available to buy still or again.
---
Take this as your sign to solely use black powder weapons exclusively.
---
I only have used cores and they’re all pretty low. Lmao 😂 you can get more cores from spawned Power Armor. It’s super easy and farmable.
---
This... actually is a good idea *if* you have friends online that you can tell "hey don't leave your server for a few".
---
Of course, if your friend accidentally disconnects... Yeah you're screwed.
---
if i do decide to kill a wanted player i always use the camp emote (the one with the american flag), give those criminals a case of american justice
---
I am not sure I would agree. It seems to me that a lot of these criticisms conflate 'easy' and 'fun' as if they were synonymous.
---
In a solo game those weapon / perk combinations that completely trivliazed content wouldn't really be such a big issue.  After all, it's just you in your own little world doing your thing. It doesn't matter if you're basically playing in God Mode because you're the only one playing.
---
It matters a lot more in multiplayer games. In order for content to feel relevant it needs to present a challenge that is in relation to your own gear / capabilities.  When difficult content can be made trivial by a subset of players taking advantage of an unintended (or ill-thought) combination of weapons and perks it can have dramatic effects across the entire game.
---
Those players can level faster and gain better weapons / armor at an increased rate, which in turn makes them more powerful. They can distribute the excess gear they find to other players, creating an imbalance in the in-game economy as well as helping to make lower-difficulty content more trivial as players obtain stronger items early than intended.  And of course once they've consumed the content at a rate faster than they should have they jump on Reddit and complain at the lack of content or challenge.
---
Post patch as well?
---
I haven't traded for a single piece from anyone other than in game vendor bots.
---
I was only pointing out that a spear isn't a top tier weapon. I'm a level 170 and I feel the OP's pain.......loot in this game is pretty lackluster. The loot table for the SBQ is lackluster and not really worth the time and resources spent.
---
&lt;&lt;attention: nuclear strike imminent&gt;&gt;
---
I like you.
---
OH WOW! this is amazing *wink* *wink*
---
I’m assuming chameleon= stealth boy?
---
It would give us something interesting to spend atoms on. 500 seems around the right price for me as well. 
---
No. I would like to see shrug, and sorry, but those are too friendly still. None of the ones we have say, "Fuck you, you fucking bastard!"They all say, "Please leave me alone you big meanie." As if the target audience for this M rated game is a bunch of 10-year-olds.
---
I wouldn't say it's terrible, but it is for sure a major let down. The saddest truth if this game is that its name is what's carried it. Can anyone here honestly say they would have stuck it out like they did if it wasn't a fallout game? 
---
Don't get me wrong, I too enjoyed the game at the start, but the end game is pretty non existent. At least in FO4 I have mods to help change the pace. To be fair though, the game IS only a few months old. 
---
This almost happend to me. Lucky for me, playstation remembers your friends sessions for like 10 minutes and lets you join the session of people who may have already left the server. I was able to slip my way into a server my friend already had left that i dropped stuff in. 
---
In case you wondered about shotgun crafting options (min, usable level) --
---
Pump Action: L5 [can't personally confirm]
---
Double-Barrel: L15
---
Combat: L20
---
I have two PS4's in the garage for my kids and I to play together (started with minecraft), now I am able to use my one digital license at the same time on both machines and I can transfer items easily. Really helps.

Made a psa thread about it. Did some testing on Watoga robots.

So I’m guessing weapon type is a huge factor silenced or not 
---
Post Screenshots please and where/how it was found.

What levels are the super mutants?

Did u just get to whitespring? Hang out on the ledges so they can't get u
---
I can see this happening in game.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQwDpKyFJTo
---
I've mentioned this before but my thought is that if you're killed in a mutual PVP setting then your loot is fair game. But if you're killed by the environment (hello Mr. Exlpoding Car) or a mob (hello Mr. Alpha Deathclaw) then your look should appear as an L3 locked Vault-Tec lunchbox that emits smoke (like the cargo drops) so it can be easily seen amongst the brush and the meat piles. Taking someone elses's junk when they die near you should be a minor no-no and discouraged either way.
---
Pompadour wig! That's what it is I'm sorry yall I got too dam excited -_- is it rare by any chance? I've only found 1 through my gameplay 
---
Agreed it blows.  You never know what will happen next
---
This is why there were more empty chairs than presents at your last birthday party.
---
Not to throw more at you, but how does this fare for rad weapons like radium rifle/gamma gun? I’d imagine the same

A note on Legendary Spawn rates; Since my experience has been the more you collect, the more good rolls you will get, and with WS being the most prolific Farming area, I follow this procedure:

I enter WS from the entrance near the Station, check the map for other players, (1 or 2 is OK) if there are several, I usually server hop, if there is one stationary behind the Golf Club I server Hop (Turret Farm indicator).
---
I use Stealth to work my way along the row of Rooms &amp; Shops (Killing with an Instigating DC Gauntlet), and if I don't find at least 3 legendary enemies, I Server Hop (5 is the normal count, 7 occasionally)
---
If that area is good I move on to the Golf Club where the Normal number of legendary enemies is around 6, but on occasions has yielded 10+, and on a few rare occasions is bugged to continuously re-spawn at a rate that makes looting them all very difficult, on one occasion I looted 57 legendary Items in less than 30 minutes.
---
My general experience has been that some servers generate far more legendary enemies, and if I hit a couple of locations not finding normal spawns, it's best to Server Hop.
---
Seems like your just having a sad day and need a break from fallout 
---
Lemme find an enemy i can deal rad damage too and ill check then add to my post if its the same outcome. 
---
Her her her, you said teabag....hit me up xxxbeavisbutthead69
---
It would be a cool idea but I don’t see how it could do anything beyond being a title. It would be cool if it had ranks and with each rank you get a free perk. Ex Raider 1 gets 5% ammo weight reduction, small but useful. Another could be Angel 1 your stimpacks have a chance to give you food/water. Things already in the game that can help your play style. A neutral karma would be interesting as well. I’d grind to get the title “Fat Cat” again!
---
I found a video where to get it
---
If you're confident you can recreate that bug you should definitely reach out to Bethesda to help them get it fixed. You can submit a ticket here:

---
Lol do a full restart of ur system
---
Probably animals or scorched, I’d think. Thanks for documenting everything
---
Thank you that’s incredible advice , I had no idea uranium would not drop a max level item, makes total sense now why some weapons dropped at lvl 20-35. The community of fallout is unique the love is genuine!!! Tbh I still haven’t received a plan yet but my friend did paint my T-60 with the bos initiate paint and hopefully some of the offers will come to fruition later today!!
---
everybody wants the Gjallahorn, man
---
but not everyone is gonna get the Gjallahorn.
---
RNG is RNG
---
And yet.....Everytime I have had that option for my camp, it put me in a new server with the spot free.
---
https://youtu.be/7ke0M8tFs20 that's the location 
---
It's not that common but at the same time not that rare lol
---
They're giving a PVP based server environment, just take it out entirely of the other servers when that happens!
---
Yes
---
LMAO! Sounds like a good time, I'd join u but I'm on Xbox. Tho I'm sure you'll find someone ❤️ there is a way to bypass the repairing of the pipes, so ask whoever you get to guide you to show you where it's at. You'll need lvl 3 picklock &amp; hacker. 
---
&gt; did you jump server after every loop of locations? 
---
No, for two reasons. 
---
The main methodology is to stay on the same server as long as possible, visit the locations/events known to spawn legendary enemies. There is a theory that the servers may have loot tables with individualized but non-uniform chances. For example, you'd see more of the same item type or effect dropped on the same server. I read anecdotes about finding explosive weapons by the dozen in nuked Whitesprings. So far, I don't have enough data to conclude on this hypothesis.
---
The second reason is that eventually, server hopping may get you suspended as it puts a strain on Bethesda's infrastructure for no benefit to them. Once the dupers, the hoarders have been booted, they may come for the notorious server hoggers.
---
&gt; The take away from my test was that if you found a loaded server (lots of legendaries at each location) , stay on it. Either way great work, very interesting. (Instagating seems to be my biased loot) 
---
I don't track exactly how many legendaries spawned at each location at a time, but the timestamps may hint of it in my log. One should consider the effects of other players, namely a new player entering a zone triggering a new set of spawns. I try to be alone when visiting a non-nuked Whitesprings to make sure the respawns are triggered by me, however, this is almost impossible on a nuked Whitesprings when almost everyone shows up over and over. In contrast, this constant respawn triggering gives a lot more data to work with, which is a plus when trying to not waste time.
---
Pretty much, but the stealth boy has a time limit.
---
Did you ever get these plans?
---
Yes I do
---
for sure
---
Hey all, thanks for your reports. We're aware of this one and a fix currently on the way with a future update. I don't have a date to share just yet, but we'll let you know as soon as it's resolved.
---
I never expected those perks to effect energy resistance. 
---
No. There should be no transferring items between characters. It's game breaking and lazy. 
---
I honestly have no idea... LOL.
---
I wish Bethesda would be more clear about how the sneak mechanics actually work.
---
I can say that I wear weightless armor and mod every piece with shadowed/ultra-light. I also have the chameleon mutation. I use a quad crossbow and I rarely get spotted. 
---
Check in the data section of your pipboy menu. The dropped loot comes up as a misc quest &amp; sometimes gets turned off. 
---
Did you friend me in game?
---
So what buff does it get (aside from the extra durability) if any?
---
I think it has more to do with console players then PC players. I rarely see douchebaggery on PC, but I've witnessed my fair share of childish behavior on a friends console. I suppose it has more to do with the fact that a kid has higher access to a console then a gaming PC but the PC community does tend to be more mature.
---
ah gotcha! thanks for explaining, i was hoping there was some way to do it with only one  ps4 heheh
---
The only reason im stating this is because Armor Piercing sources don't state whether its damage or energy resistance in the tool-tip's. 
---
Nice I paid much more lolol
---
This might be the weirdest link to /r/fuckHOA they have ever received.
---
I just compared them and they look nearly exactly the same but different colors. Its hard to say with 100% certainty because of the color changes but I don't think its more clean than the regular one.
---
nice!
---
It's kind of ridiculous for you to get so worked up about junk man. Its literally everywhere. Even the stuff that's harder to come by has guaranteed spawn points. So he someone grabbed your bag. Don't throw a fit about it. Just find some more.
---
Energy Resistance and Damage is the red headed step child in FO76.  ER also doesn't appear to be affected by CND like DR is.
---
As for Armor Piercing not affecting ER, it kind of makes sense, because Armor Piercing is a physical characteristic of the bullets used. (Those damned Major Gutsy's and Anti Armor Heavy Turrets tear you up good even in Power Armors).
---
Seems there should be an attribute you can use on Energy Weapons to make them more "intense" and bypass energy resists better.
---
Friend me in game (PC) - IGN pstryder
---
hmmm, not sure what your experiencing but it works for me.  There was once where it took 3 times to get my camp but that was isolated and has since worked correctly every time my camp could not be placed.   "A lie" is a rather harsh term.  Could it be that the code that selects the server just happened to pick the same one?  The fact that it worked after 6 tries makes your assertion of it being a lie incorrect.  It worked eventually.  I would suspect that the more servers that are online the better chance of it picking the same world repeatedly not as likely but still a possibility.  Saying it was "a lie" is pure hyperbole and even your own posting makes that in fact "a lie"....
---
Not everyone is dick. Many times, me and my friends will guard bags of those who we see die while with us in a blast zone.
---
Concessions are available on demand - I can have a PC walking around selling concessions.
---
I even have a stockpile of booze available.
---
Aw, that's a bummer (even if I'm jelly as hell of your name)!
---
I did not know the pipes could be bypassed.  There was much frantic swearing and incoherent yelling as we rushed to repair them, once we realized that's what we were supposed to be doing lol.  I think we finished with 8 seconds left on the timer.
---
Use a container somewhere far from the free travel points. Have to join same server via a friend list person though. Getting harder to do with friends away from the game. 
---
But yet you keep playing it huh? And you keep coming to this sub huh? Perhaps if we didn't have a duping issue back in the early days and a huge influx of super op shit on the market people wouldn't feel their loot was so lack luster. When I switched to pc I had all bloodied swing speed unarmeds, full unyielding weapons weight set, and bloodied explosive rifles. Guess what? The game (IMO) is much more fun when you play with you get and just make due. 
---
You can literally do this:
---
Go online and pick a build, level to 50, to hop on reddit and start buying the gear you need for your build. You can literally make an entire end game build without ever killing a 3* legendary enemy. Just farm caps and or be a douche and go on eBay. 
---
I had 700hrs on Xbox man. I was nearing level 400. And trust me, the loot isn't as bad as you think it is, it's just not as good as what you know is out there. That's where the problem is. It's not god roll therefore it's trash, may as well paper bag it. 
---
This has to be happening on Console. I usually go around every day and claim every workshop I can to get the first round of rewards " farming recipes ". I had 12 workshops claimed two days ago and stayed on the server for several hours and never once was I engaged in PVP. Server wasnt dead either, but just seems like a lot of PC players dont care about or are more mature with PVP. 
---
Or maybe people just think Im a bad ass and leave me alone.. who knows.. haha
---
Fair enough
---
Ah I see so chameleon would be better.
---
same my Tse lever action tends to break very fast and I have 1000 ammo for it so all of this ammo for this good gun I have I can't use because the gun breaks when im nowhere near a crafting bench and don't want to move my camp
---
Can you sneak by scorch beasts?
---
I'd assume Armor Piercing would effect all types of armor, not just Ballistic resistance. Or else it would be stated in the tooltips of the perks themselfs. Then we would also be given multiple variants of armor piercing. 
---
Having 0 way to reduce ER seems fishy to me. 
---
Nice one. Love it!
---
This is how glorf got
---
Banned. Their math literally duped his transactions while owning no more than 36k of any ammo
---
Type
---
Total
---
Well of course you could of avoided losing 700 caps by just switching servers after the first time, I know it's hard to want to recover your junk and get revenge .. but this stuff catches you off guard and we don't think rationally or just forget .. but after losing your first bit of caps, best would of just bounced .. humans are dicks ..
---
Yeah it appeared he called his buddy lol
---
Your real beef should be that it breaks so fast.
---
LMAO, it's all part of the fun! The franticness of it all. Once me and my crew all took a silo and raced to see who could finish it first. 😂😂 We were all swearing and yelling at each other, laughing so hard we could barely shoot anything. 
---
I don't meet many other girl gamers out there, so I'm bummed too you arent on Xbox. 
---
&gt; Having 0 way to reduce ER seems fishy to me. 
---
Red headed step child.  :)
---
He lied and broke a contract, costing someone something. That's not capitalism, that's being a con-man.  
---
In this economy, both parties were using the currenty most agreed and implemented contract system in the economy. THAT part, how the contract was made-- that's the capitalism part.  
---
The broken contract part is not capitalism, it's just being an asshole. He deserves massive negative karma and warnings to all who may do business.
---
This would be a game-changer
---
I can't prove it but I'm 99% positive he did.
---
its the same. doesnt change.  
---
sure is
---
morgantown high school. over 200 plastic given all the plastic pumpkins, cafeteria trays, plastic spoons knives forks etc. happy scrounging! plastic also to include is life preservers. 
---
I've picked up someone's bag before, yes was an accident,  I thought they fast traveled elsewhere,  saw the player a short time after and tried to give him back all their stuff. Sometimes shit just happens.
---
It's obvious..unless ur the type which liked to provoke random players
---
Yeah, same. FO4 was the first fo game I ever played, and I loved it. So when you get the "country roads" trailer and just imagine "FO4 + multiplayer", you get a vastly different picture of what the game would be compared to what it is now. I definitely didn't consider the things that would be fundamentally different considering that it's online multiplayer, but man was this game totally different than expectations. This was also the first game I ever preordered, and while I wouldn't say I'm unhappy with it, it could've been a little less beta upon release.
---
As a side note while I'm at it, I just think it's hilarious that people berate other people for preordering this game saying "hurr durr you don't know what you're gonna get it's probably gonna be trash" when there was a B.E.T.A. for a reason, and you can cancel your preorder any time before release... So in all actuality, there was no reason to NOT preorder the game if you were thinking about buying it at all.
---
hahaha nice one
---
I would pay real money for a vaultboy butt emote. ;)
---
None of the recent changes affected what happened to you. You could be on the other side of the map, and if you own a workshop i can challenge (which flags us for pvp with no chat warning) and come kill you with no warning. Don’t want it to happen? Don’t spend the caps the own the workshop. 
---
I was talking with my friend about this and we were thinking of a book club or performing Shakespeare at the theater at The Whitespring.
---
Ya.  I'd imagine it was turned off.  Happens often enough to my Teammates "Why isn't my Death spot showing up?"  "Oh, quest is off".
---
Usually happens cause weeks ago we were focusing on a mission and turned off all other quests to avoid confusing markers on the compass.  And since FO76 remembers settings and every death is treated as the same "quest" it keeps it off til you go turn it on manually.
---
Instigating lever action rifle firing at night for 3.75 sneak attack one shots Colonel Gutsy. Needs 2-3 during the day.
---
I would like to pass along the idea mentioned elsewhere in the thread, that it would nice to have a "cleaning kit" as well as a "repair kit"
---
- repair kit: fix broken armor/weapons, requires complex scrap based on the item
---
- cleaning kit: temporary bonus to non-broken armor/weapon, only requires oil and cloth, but only works on items that aren't broken. perhaps mechanically it adds a small amount of "over repaired" shield status to the item.
---
Don't take workshops if you're not willing to PVP... That's the whole point. If someone or a group wants it more than you, and they have the tools to take it from you, they can and will. Why wouldn't they? This is a wasteland. Not everyone is going to share your ammo factory. 
---
Honestly to date my favorite weapon is my quad crossbow with 33% VATS. It's definitely not an end game weapons but it's a ton of fun to play with. I had it drop from a ghoul. 
---
Although they are fun weapons.......I don't think you and I will be showing up to the SBQ fight with our crossbows and spears. They just aren't end game weapons.
---
Hey man I tried sending bethesda tickets but my ADHD is utterly incompatible with their ticket categorizing system. My first and only attempt of asking a question to support included browsing EACH AND EVERY ticket category to find a suitable one to ask my question, then learning that the one I deemed most relevant is one-way channel through which I will not receive a response, ever, but hey thanks for the feedback, sincerly, webpage HTML.
---
Sorry, but I'm a professional with what I do and I don't have the time nor patience to bang my head against the wall of this ticketing system. I'm open to spending few hours for debugging and assistance purposes, but having absolutely no guarantee that anybody will ever see this makes this time investment something I will simply not do. Schedule a time upon which a presentation is to be made, I'll organize two teams and extract the shortest reproduction route for the bug. Ask me to use the ticketing system - no way I'll do that until ticketing system is reworked so that I don't have to restart the process if the option I choose doesn't have an appropriate suboption, something I have no way of learning without first opening a given view first.
---
I would like something like this implemented also.
---
I’ve found them in random locations as well, most recently inside the Whitesprings golf club in the corner on a chair near where the sleeping bags (and feral ghouls) are and the randomly spawned recipe. It’s not exactly rare but it is uncommon, I know because I was wearing it for 100 levels and finally decided to just change my character’s appearance to permanently rock the pompadour. 
---
I actually like the pipe repair part.  It does take long and is easygoing if with someone else.   My group does a nuke everyday.   Hit me up with a FR and you can tag along.   Nexutomne2 
---
Interesting. I’ll have to check. 
---
I like the throw up rad emote. 
---
The format is fine
---
Wow, that's amazing! Reminds me of that trailer where a powered armor soldier watches the nukes land. 
---
- repair kit: fix broken armor/weapons, requires complex scrap based on the item, like at a bench.
---
There is a big, BIG, but on this.  Down sides.  You cant use red dot or normal sights on weapons.  They become invisible.   You are forced to use hand weapons or any scoped weapon.  The only armor you can use and still keep your invisibility is weightless.  They are hard to get.  If you put on any other type of armor, your mutation is voided.
---
As far as I’m aware there isn’t any buff from it, I thought you might know something I didn’t, that’s why I stated it that way.
---
There are *dozens* of us!
---
If you ever come over to the dark side, my PSN is Neojinnx.  ;-)
---
You can add tuchflufygetdizy. I run a silo a night pretty much. Idk how late I'll be in Saturday night. But I can Def get you through quickly. Lemme know your time frame and time zone. Perhaps I can take yall through
---
I have had game drops reward earlier good behavior several times for my character. I would like to believe good karma was coded into the game.
---
They can and do reset. Always have. If another player isn't in the exact same location as you when you leave the server and rejoin, the local area will reset. This is kinda your fault, not Bethesda's. You assumed things worked a certain way. You were wrong.
---
It is definitely upsetting that our post apocalypse world doesn’t give our energy weapons the love they need. Even more so with the ultracite laser weapons, the guns are so far and in between and it’s not even guaranteed to get a mod much less a useful one.
---
you're coming at a time when quite a few things have been fixed and you're only level 15 lol. The game has come up in quality but there is still no current endgame, you kill the scorchbeast queen, you farm whitespring, this is your life now.
---
Happened to me very often, on command at times. I loved the large amount of things I could place down, but my one problem with it was there wasn’t any budget for wiring up electricity if the items duplicated. You then have to delete half of everything (sometimes 4x or more) just to run power. It used to happen when your camp couldn’t get placed upon startup and you changed servers a few times without placing your camp back down.
---
How is it game breaking? Lazy? What does laziness have to do with anything? How am I lazy when I spread my own loot around to my other characters?
---
So do you need two PSN act's?  Also I made the mistake of getting the disc so would I be able to run both at once, or can I dl the whole game on the other machine?  (it basically dl'd the whole game anyway which pissed me off)  Waiting on roommate to reactivate his PSN act. at the moment.
---
My boyfriend and I would love to help out! We've been through all of the silos multiple times. My PSN is Celeste_Strange.
---
It's much more difficult to find a target that has a ton of workshops than it is to find the player with just one. Also, if you have all of them, you are less likely to show up when one gets contested. So the griefers would find no value in targeting you. If you'd like to test it, invest in just one. Actually build things to make it look like you care about the location.
---
Give it a couple of minutes between leaving and joining.
---
VATS the thruster...it's his weak point
---
When looking for a new server block a few peeps on your current sever quit world then find new world this will force you into a new world.
---
Repeat as needed/wanted.
---
I run Rifle Spec in Perception with Tank Killer and all 3 Rifleman Percs + I run Melee Build in STR at the same time. 
---
I can swap to Shotgun + Rifle just by swapping out perc cards, no need to move points around.
---
I stopped running travel agent because Caps arent hard to come by and eventually you own all the recipes so CAPs become pointless in my opinion. All the crafting percs are swappable when I craft as is Hard Bargain. 
---
Basically, I have 15 Points in STR / 12 Points PER / 6 End / 4 Char / 8 Int / 3 Agi / 8 Luck
---
I dont PVP ... I can one shot anything in game aside from a Behemoth or SBQ with melee / shotgun / rifle with my setup. I dont use Explosive weapons. I dont use Two Shot weapons either. I use Instigating Procs and generally hard hitting weapons. 
---
I also run Marsupial / Twisted Muscles / Carnivore / Speed Demon mutations.
---
I would love the ability to craft Weapon repair Kits, and they should require a laundry list of items to craft, like an adjustable wrench, hammer, screwdriver, screws, springs, oil, steel, &amp; wood, they should weigh about 3 lbs each, and provide 50% repair to a weapon.
---
Armor Repair kits would be a nice addition as well, (Hammer, Combination Wrench, Steel, Lead, Screws, Leather, Cloth, Asbestos, &amp; ballistic fiber).
---
This would also give all the random junk new purpose, and the scrap all junk key would get much less use.
---
Or let us use Toxic Goo to craft Weapon Goop, that works like Alien Adhesive.
---
The ammo part has be a bit curious because as of right now, most ammo goes for 3-5 rounds for 1 cap in the trading communities. Since you can’t really set a fractional cap price in the current system, I wonder how they’ll handle that. I reeeeally want bulk ammo. 
---
How fitting of  bethesda to temporarily ban the creator of this post because of his situation. This is an unacceptable way to treat the community.
---
I'm also a lvl 40 and everytime there is a nuke at Whitesprings, I can only stay in the blast zone for so long before the rads are close to killing me. Have a hazmat and power armor on with a couple things taken to resist rads. What am I doing wrong?
---
Ah, I see. Yeah it’s odd that ranged doesn’t get the same treatment, but at the same time it makes me wonder if it’s a bug that it gives you a damage boost at all. 
---
Yeah I'm much more of the opinion that things should be MORE dangerous, I remember running for my life at a low level from a group of gulpers deep in the swamp and it was one of the more memorable experiences in the game for me because I wasn't just steamrolling everything 
---
Same for me and my gf. Wished we could permanent build together though.
---
Nice, good to know! You saved me a lot of junk :)
---
Well over a month ago I wandered upon a camp near Watoga. Went in and used the stash box and hear a gunshot and the guy in there dies, dropping a bag. I wait a bit and then picked it up and left. Moments later the guy messages me and says he shot by accident and the exploding round killed him, asked if he could get his stuff back. I gave it all and then some. He added me to the party chat and said he was suprised I gave it back, been playing with him and his group ever since. Good times I gotta say.
---
This reminds me that we should be able to toggle player names. I'm tired of walking around and seeing childpuncher69 trying to fight me on PS4.
---
I didn't mean I would nuke you guys, but if you publicize something on the internet, the trolls will come 
---
I swap a lot between those two types on one of my guys. Honestly with a little perception you can already pdo enough damage but you need some other cards that you don't have access to yet. With 3 t1 rifle cards and t3 tank killer(I use tank killer 2 but also the proper pierce mag or AA legendary) Focus fire 1 if you aren't vats heavy. 
---
You probably have 5 int for modding or weapon smith. Weaponsmith becomes less valuable later in my opinion so unless you want a explosives or heavy gunner build 3 int will be enough. Cant remember if oy need 3 or 4 int to craft some of the energy weapon mods later. Think 3 tbh.
---
Idk......I usually run from them.
---
I'll will try it later this evening.
---
Pm their psn names and I’ll try to find and troll them relentlessly.
---
The now and thumbs down should be fine. You could also get a mic.
---
loved the post, got real excited to add you and then realized you were PS4... now i have sadness.

---
Without weighing in on whether it *should* work as you suggest, I just want to register some slight incredulity that it doesn't already. Bethesda has taken every other opportunity to shove PVP at people; why not this one? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Please do. I literally only play with my girlfriend and I Believe many do. Building together would be awesome.
---
I would love to help!

I solo run silos almost daily but if you're looking for help this weekend I'll be on sometime Saturday after 10pm est
---
I made a bed that two people can lie in at the same time?
---
Why not just go no armor haha
---
Nah, because you using in game items and mechanics to build, you not even glitching or exploiting. People like to say it is a exploit but it is really not, you simple taking advantage of how the game works. I am building some bunkers before they stop me from building like this, so far have 2 bunkers.
---
It stops people kinda, but animals and NPC's simply walk thru the walls ..
---
Im pretty sure its because the marine armor helmet was supposed to be in the game but bugged out like a few other items and wasnt available on release.
---
Seems like they are removing items they didnt intend to add from the devs room 
---
but items that were supposed to be in the game and werent they dont seem to mind. 
---
Regardless having the helm shouldnt get you banned. If anything they would just remove it eventually if it wasnt intended.
---
Haha ok cool
---
Allow me to explain. I don't think parents would take too kindly to their kids giving the middle finger emote to other players. You don't go around giving the middle finger to people in real life do you? In the context of the game, a thumbs down can be interpreted as "no" or "I don't like what you are doing." In either scenario, the other player sees you are obviously unhappy with them. Flipping the bird isn't going to change that except perhaps incite them to escalate. If they want to troll you they will regardless of whether you gave them the thumbs down or flipped them the bird. So in this light I highly doubt that it would be in Bethesda's best interest to allow you to flip someone off. I understand you're frustrated. That kind of behavior is meant to do that. You do have the option of hopping servers though. I'm not saying that what they did to you is right. I'm just saying there are different ways of dealing with it and asking Bethesda to allow you to flip the bird isn't going to get you the result you're looking for.
---
wow i would love the high jump one and speed demon, im on psn PS4 id FritoZ, ill be on usually every night after work around 7 central time and on weekends

:)

You lost the junk by dieing. Simple solution is not to die. If you do die you have the chance to get your crap back and even gives you a helping marker. If you fail then tough, life's a bitch after a nuclear appocalypse, get over it.
---
We got 5-20% more damage on automatic weapons in [Patch 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1to3g/december_4th_patch_notes/). Less screeching in [Patch 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asat8r/fallout_76_patch_notes_february_19_2019/). That's about it I know of/experienced.
---
Does it provide any dmg/energy/radiation resistance?
---
I got x01 prototype power armor and I have been going to white spring and nuke zones. I've been finding that levelling has been going well. I'm 46 and it doesn't feel like a grind. Just don't be like me, forget your helmet, and wonder where all these rads are coming from. I also crafted a high level baseball bat and have the barbed mod on and it's really a great melee weapon that you can make on the cheap. I like whitespring because if I get overrun with mobs, I run towards the robots to help out. Protip 2, don't hit a car because if it kills a robot they'll turn on you. 
---
Yeah you're going to still slowly build up some rads, the solution is to just use radaway to clear them and then heal.  
---
I'd love to see it! Would you mind to post it?
---
Sorry you're having trouble with legendaries. The system needs work, but you really don't need to turn to $30 eBay purchases. 
---
*Only* an anti-armor handmade? If it's max level, then it's one of the more coveted 1\* drops. There's just so many rifle users. You should be able to leverage that into nearly any other 1\* legendary, assuming you can manage to find an honest trader. I'm pretty sure I have a max-level 1\* bloodied pump-action shotgun sitting in my stash that I'd be glad to trade you for it. I'd be glad to check tonight if you're interested. 
---
You're also calling instigating trash? Instigating gives amazing clear speed on high damage weapons. They're useless on low damage weapons or against the SBQ, but they make great secondary weapons for leveling and clearing. I have an instigating sledgehammer that one-shots everything &lt;= level 50, even without much strength or supporting melee perks. I can only imagine how good it would be if I had the perks. 
---
I've found max-level 1\* weapons with any prefix can be acquired by trading in-game resources. When you want 2\* with precise affixes, weapon type, and level, the odds of drops get astronomical and sellers have high demands.

If you are on PC and wish to add me, feel free and you can use my base for water :)
---
But by your logic, it's not worth going to anyway. 
---
My current weapons on pc: 1* vamp handmade, 1* furious handmade, my spear, all rise, 1* instigating baseball bat, 2* ghoul slayers D.C. Gauntlet (swing speed), and a 3* executioners shish with power attack and reduced weight. 
---
My armor is mostly 2* with a few vanguard pieces. 
---
Am I soloing the sbq? Hell nah. But I don't need to. It's a multiplayer game. There were 15 people there this morning when I got that spear and what not. There was 19 mins left on the timer when she died. Very rarely do I ever see her die with less than 15 mins on the timer. 
---
My main point: having full sets of god roll armor and god roll weapons isn't necessary in this game. Is it cool to be a walking tank that one punches almost anything, yea, but it also takes from the fun a little bit. IMO. 
---
If you take note of a few players in the server you can do this. Once bacl the menu, switch characters and hit the social list, select a player then join game. Bit dicey but I use this method to transfer legendaries and other items I want to swap around. 
---
Its just a weird item
---
are you just server hoping to get it to respawn? or do legendaries have a cooldown across servers per person?
---
On ps4 but thanks for invite :) I'll find other ways to farm caps, I'm sure!
---
Just put some stairs and you can can have floors as a roof instead, one tile will be open for the stairs. There may be a way to close this up, but I am not up to speed on how.
---
Interesting so it's obtainable and is legit. I've read somewhere that they removed the 8 DR from it making it purely cosmetic like most helms, I dont have it so I cant confirm that.
---
Yet it made you post to Reddit about it? Sounds like whatever he did to you worked in his favor.  Now that tea bag is living rent free in your head
---
...which is exactly why it is a good idea to be able to do it without getting your friends to log in, or having a second account.
---
Anything that moves chews up budget, a brahmin pen takes up the same budget as a missile turret 15%
---
Great idea, but it needs to be more than 50 pounds.
---
Rated M games shouldn't be built with a "but what about the kids" mentality. If parents don't want their kids exposed to "adult" content like -- gasp -- middle fingers then they need to do a better job of parenting and keep their kids off adult-rated games.
---
That said, most kids are exposed to dozens if not hundreds of middle fingers on the road during their childhood depending on how bad their parents drive, so really it's not a huge deal. It's just the bird.
---
The only way i can think of this being perceived lazy is that you dont have to stash manage as much as you can just dump everything on your alt. 
---
I dont agree though, it still takes effort distributing stuff.
---
In a survival game, its part of the fun of the chase and rush not to die! Love this game.  I do think sometimes people take too personally getting killed or losing junk.  Even bullies die and get killed in return for their sins.  It is always awesome meeting good people who are respectful and help others in the madness that is FO76. 
---
You're to kind 💝💝💝
---
By all means feel free to *not* use the function if it gets implemented. 
---
interesting, wouldn't have thought this.
---
It will boost past 15
---
I chalked it up to a melee weapon being “sharper” thus doing more damage. 
---
Because the game is geared for online play.  When a player enter a specific locations, monsters will spawn.  They may spawn right in front of you and you will get swarmed.   Happens all the time.  You could play with a mishmash of armor until you get a full set of weightless. Or you can get a piece of chameleon armor which is like 20% sneak each piece.  Get a full set and your at 100% sneak.  OR, you can get a power armor with stealth mod until.  I idid that until i made my 5 piece marine weughtless armor set.
---
Yeah. I saw some video of a guy with +100 intelligence. 
---
It's almost as if a LOT of people overreacted, hmm?  /sarcasm
---
Some people just suck at thinking for themselves. They'd rather just jump on a bandwagon and follow along. Regardless of if it has any merit or not. I mean don't get me wrong, things are/were messed up in 76. It's just not to the point that the zeitgeist has made it out to be. I'm sorry, but if you think this game is a 2, 3, 4 out of 10, then you either need your head examined or have an ulterior motive. People do not play 2, 3, 4 out of 10 games for 400+ hours for three months straight. It would be dead by now if those were anywhere even close to the realm of reality. 
---
That has nothing to do with what op said. A limit acts as a virtual blockage to prevent inflation. The fact that you can't have caps beyond 25k means you can't buy something paying more than 25k cap.It can't get more anti inflation than this. 
---
Ok, that would be amazing! I totally want to be a part of that. 
---
Everywhere I've read said the DR was removed from it as well and I saw a few images showing no stats.
---
I got it as a random quest reward in the Mire.
---
Yeah or robo brains I'm just lazy is why I asked
---
No, only way to come back to the same server is join a team and be on the team, then you can quit and come back to the same server. There is a small chance you may be thrown in the same server but is rare.
---
:(
---
* Tries to cut own wrists with this ripper out of saddnes, fails *
---
that makes sense. I have zero interest in actually running the workshop, I'm just after the easy score of a recipe and yeah, I never just go for one, I usually go for all of them that are unclaimed be it 5 - 6 - 7 or 12 lol.
---
3500 word essay, 7 paragraphs, 6 periods.  Just fucking priceless.
---
But when so many other enemies can be reduced to minor nuisances, it is unbalanced that this one unsuspecting robot is such a terrifyingly difficult enemy to face.  It isn't about dumbing down the game, it's about balancing it to make it more consistent.  Why are some enemies made of paper and are no more intimidating than a light rain while other enemies can utterly demolish you while soaking up bullets like a sponge?  Why are protectrons, another robot enemy that originated as a utility robot and was then also converted to military use, such ass-sucking fodder while Mr. Handies become big metal death incarnates?
---
Fuck, there's so much inconsistency (or imbalance) in this game like how pipe weapons are much better weapons than laser weapons.  Or how miniguns tickle deathclaws while sledgehammers pulverize them to bits.
---
He doesn’t move much though and he is easy to sneak away from and goes down in a couple of super-sledge hits, but yes, he is powerful
---
when all of my mutations prock (with class freak) my character can have about 24 Intelligence 
---
Sounds like something a Commie would say.
---
He's not a problem for me thought he packs some real hurting if you're not prepared...  you need First Aid maxed out if you want to rely on auto stim (I use Born Survivor 2 with First Aid 3).
---
Power armor - Emergency Protocols is the 2nd defense beyond Born Survivor.  For normal armor, you want some Troubleshooter's pieces.
---
Have done AWOL Armaments many times by myself, including yesterday...  that was with my heavy gunner setup, gatling gun, power armor.  Will usually end up using under a handful of stims by playing it smart (not rushing them).
---
My melee unarmed can do it too but I've not tried it with Troubleshooter's pieces yet, and that really hurts.  I plan to use 3 x Troubleshooters armor for silo runs with him, just haven't gotten to trying it out.
---
Gutsies and super mutants are the only real threats  in game beyond the queen.
---
I just needed one PSN plus account. Made one PS4 the primary and my kids play on that one. They used an email I made to create a Bethesda account for each. I then used my other pa4 to sign myself in. Downloaded the game again (for free as its digital) and logged into that PS4 as myself. 
---
My kids can’t use the other PS4 to play online but they can use the primary one. 
---
Also due to the fact that beth usually removes your account so  you can't use their official forums and services.  Just FYI.
---
I can't wait for the highlight reel now. Such a fun idea. I really want to do something like this for xbox now. 
---
Awesome. Is there anything I can craft myself with plans? Or does it have to be legendary
---
I've actually gotten quite a few Explosive weapons, including 3 TSE Handmades, 4 TSE Dragons, 2 Furious Explosive Gatlings, I seem to get more Mutant's and Instigating weapons than any other prefix, and Lever Actions are nearly as rare as Melee for me.
---
I am curious about character build influence on RNG rolls, I have done a fair amount of trading with friends who only seem to get good Melee/Unarmed weapons, while I get mostly good Ranged weapons.
---
I'm always looking for something better than what I currently use, but have not changed any of my primary weapons out in the last 25-30 levels, I run with a very Light Load-out of only 6 weapons: Machete, Death Tambo, DC Gauntlet, Exp. Combat SG, Exp. Hunting Rifle, &amp; TSE Handmade, picking up My Furious Exp. Gatling for SBQ battles only.
---
How do you build your upper floors out so far? I always get an error saying it's not supported.
---
I find getting lots of steel and plastic, bulking it and then selling that is worthwhile. 
---
Also if you can spare the budget some Water Purifiers that you empty every hour and sell that Water if you need a few extra bits to sell 
---
This happens to me whenever I have two of the same hat in my inventory.
---
I do this frequently alone (full combat armor user)
---
It works alone but they adjusted the spawn time of the event. It used to spawn when someone entered the school but people were abusing this for fast rewards. So now it spawns on a static timer for each server like normal events.
---
Ever since they made this change however the event glitches sometimes and either
---
1-the quest markers dont appear and it wont let you grab the mask 
---
Or 
---
2-the quest bugs after you grab the mask and wont let you pick up the candy buckets but will still spawn enemies that run to the bucket.
---
The only way ive been able to fix it (doesnt always work) is after it glitches try fast traveling to the actual event and not the school.
---
In summation: a previous patch broke it and now it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt.
---
15 downvotes and he deleted the post down like a punk ass coward! way to go bozo! Can run from these comments tho chump lol 
---
Pharma Farmer says hello. You'll be swimming in so many stims, you'll start selling them. Seriously, try it.
---
Game isn't even romotely hard 
---
Most boards have rules against this
---
I usually do fine against these guys as long as I'm not over my carry weight and VATS doesn't decide to miss a bunch of times in a row.  I had to clear a dozen or two of these things from Monogah power plant last night. I was using a 1 star AA combat shotgun with lone wanderer and a full vats build and when the crits were chaining I was dropping them with two shots to the thruster each. Without critical hits it was five shots. When VATS decided 95% was really 20% I was running out of AP and having to run and hide to regen AP, and the two times I forgot to leave the scrap metal lay and put myself over carry weight I didn't regen AP and was mowed down. I went through about 40 diluted stims on the whole run to fix the plant.
---
Do ghouls have much armor?
---
I feel like more recently he has been insanely powerful. Even with PA on he was wrecking my shit one day, and it took me by surprise because I didn't remember him being able to take me down so effortlessly. I used All Rise against him, and I would have liked to use my Troubleshooter's Death Tambo, but I was losing health too fast to risk getting out of the PA.
---
Start over. You cannot move special points until after level 50. You have a long road ahead of you trying to make that switch.
---
Close vendor and reopen.
---
I'm just hoping that they are playing the long game and plan to put it up once every 4-5 months or so. Long enough between times to drum up interest but still infrequent enough to be rare enough to make people all the more interested in it.
---
I had a dead Scorchbeast follow me around one day. 
---
Its corpse would simply appear at my destination whenever I fast-travelled, including draping itself across the workbench at a public workshop I held for a couple of hours. One time it even spawned in mid-air and 'flump'-ed down next to the Whitespring train station as I approached. 
---
I haven't seen that particular bug since Skyrim. In that case, the dead frost dragon followed me through my whole playthrough. I would find it waiting for me on the streets of Solitude whenever I visited, or see it fall from the sky a short distance away when I arrived at some of the towns. I think I named her "Snowy". 
---
Yes, they seem off compared to other punchbag enemies, such as Mirelurk Kings/Queens.
---
They seem to have anti-armor rounds yet anti-armor loadout doesn't seem to have much effect on them. Yes, you can shoot their arms and have them killed in a couple of shots, but even with top aim, the hitboxes sometimes don't connect and aim assist (on PC?) may misdirect the shots quite a bit. 
---
I'm running into a group of them all the time in silos during launch prep and I try to hit the weaker robots first to prop up adrenaline, which then helps with Gutsies still occupied with the chiefs.
---
I don't have a Troubleshooter's weapon or a fast enough Anti-armor rifle to test those out. I know Tank Killer 3, Incisor 3 and Stabilized 3 is not good enough.
---
This. It's happening a let less frequently lately but used to be I had to turn it on every time to get a quest marker.
---
Also if you keep dying without retrieving it the first time it eventually ends up in the abyss and you SOL.
---
IGN Thirdstorm  
---
Honestly ok with PvP once things get fixed, but way too damn buggy atm
---
Am I the only one that has too much junk or doesn't mind finding more stuff when I'm killed or die? Hell before I get off for the night I carry the stuff I wanna get rid of and either start pvp or leave it at a low levels doorstep.  
---
If that doesn't work for you,  grind away until you get a two shot Fat man with demo perk and seek revenge. 
---
Non-PA player checking in with an unpopular opinion. Keep it the way it is.
---
This is the first I've heard of people having alt accounts, and it feels pretty cheaty, ngl.
---
True, I remember chugging stim packs at the end of Mayor for a Day. Maybe I just dont run into many of them to notice.
---
Cooked items will spoil much more slowly but they can still spoil for sure. 
---
Accuracy doesnt mean anything with concentrated fire. It is the perk made for automatic gun. The downside is you need to be high AP/regen build because your damage will rely heavily on VATS. 
---
Bulk ammo is a must!! I'm melee and have a ton of ammo I need rid of!
---
so far I've not seen the attackers, when crouching, show up on the Recent tab, mine is also normally heavily populated when I'm trading as I might have already server hopped once or twice meeting people
---
IMO they should always drop hardened mass or something else that's of unique item crafting value and not just an ingredient in a scorchbeast meal recipe. I don't kill enough scorchbeasts to stockpile enough scorchbeast cooked food items to make them one of my hotkeyed foods so I usually just sell the meat anyway.
---
Thanks. stupid question. Where are the masks located
---
I read your poem so I'd thought I'd try to write one.
---
Off I go in search of the overseer with tics and the ghouls in tow. Have a bat I think I’m ready, get attacked by multiple ghouls I’m dead already. I move on to the penitentiary to find mutants who are not too bright, wait how the hell am I suffering from blight?
---
I make my first camp without a worry in the least, what the hell is a scorchbeast? I pull out my gun to defend myself but his Skyrim (Fus Ro Dah) blows me half way across Appalachia with nowhere to run.
---
Collecting RADS like I have a choice, I need to find a radiation suit to go but wait what’s this power armor hell ya! I’m stronger now, a little in awe when I get my ass handed to me by a deathclaw.   I move on hope my luck will change when I run in to a Yao Guai who hits like a truck! Out of blue a hero appears with his mighty hammer he kills that bear without a fear. 
---
Hey, wait I can jump so high, I’ve gotten mutation Marsupial I think I can fly. I visit this town more to see thinking this is cool – wait these robots are shooting at me?  I run for my life thinking I’ll hide when an assaultron roast my back side. 
---
I visit a golf course thinking I’d rather live there instead when someone drops a nuke on my head.  I get a Rad suit to face these green ghouls and now a plus I have all their loot. I sell it for caps to improve my fait wait I sold a three star am I too late?  
---
RC
---
I’d be interested in that sub if it wasn’t non stop crying about haters 90% of the time.
---
I was gonna take offense at the military comment, but it's true so you got the upvote
---
I wouldn't say that Colonel Gutsy needs to be weakened, I'd say many other monsters need to be strengthened. Make Super Mutants Super Again!
---
If you dont want other players to have your junk when you make a mistake and die in Whitesprings, go to Artisans corner. In there you can bulk and stash the valuable junk.  Ive died at Fissure Prime after recieving the Scorched Earth loot many times and dropped junk (Fluxes, scrapped steel/lead/balistic fiber) and someone picked it up. Think like this, if its not in the Stash then ya never had it. You'll save yourself ammo and misery.
---
Awesome and very funny. Your poem is far more... let's call it mechanics-based than mine. Awesome take on Fallout 76!
---
Hey, double-date!  Pfft, who needs dinner and a movie, right?  lol
---
My PSN is Neojinnx.
---
Indeed. I’ve had mixed experiences selling it, most stuff just won’t move. Sometimes you can’t even give it away. So into the suitcase at Watoga it goes. 
---
When I find stuff it is normally heavy guns and or CA
---
World ending demonic things deserve attention too
---
I saw a guy that made a trapdoor hallway that killed anyone who tried to enter his home.  A low level on my team went in and died,  tried to go back for his loot so I leveled the camp so they wouldn't die.  
---
Hey. Hopefully today we can crack bravo and charlie. Alpha is solved so go check out nukacrypt.com/solved for it! It takes a while.
---
It’s not done but I’ll add more. And thanks for the compliment 🤗
---
Chameleon armor is legendary.   X01 power armor can be built with stealth mod.  But you need to be a specific level to do it.  I dont have the numbers, but i think it was minimum of 30 or so.  That you may want to look up.  Start piecing together chameleon armor to use with sneak perks.  When you find weightless, put it in your stash and continue to upgrade until you have a full set.
---
Clearly they are teabagging in a vain attempt to get somone to bite down and give them some assistance lossening it up.  Way to hate on this poor minority that will likely be its own sexuality come next week.
---
I like the Fus Ro Dah reference myself 😀

With all the unintended ways to either get entrapped by the wanted system or to scam it I don't know if it would be a very accurate karma system. You could get an idea if a player were way off on one of the extreme ends of the scale but then I could see raider groups keeping a very good karma character as an unofficial team member to use as bait.
---
Haha the potential for truly sinister shit in this game is pretty next level.
---
ah, great!! thanks for the good news :)
---
PSN is Neojinnx.  I'm hoping to be able to play all day Saturday, adult responsibilities be damned.  Time zone is EST and it's rare for me to stay awake past 11 pm (*I know, I know*).
---
I will try *really, really* hard to not devolve into hysterical laughter every time I get to say, "*Touch my phluff."*
---
You know, I was thinking for sometimes on creating a blog with Fallout-inspired poems, not just about 76 but about the others or even other Bethesda titles. If I make it, I'll make sure to post your poem over there, if you're interested and if you'll allow it (I'll give you full credit, of course).
---
Sounds like the seller is baiting people into the conversation with a low price, then trying to price gouge once someone is interested.
---
Only thing you can do is say "if the 17k offer falls through I'll be happy to pay the 12k, and no more".
---
personally idk if it's worth the -karma or not, seems borderline since you didn't actually make a trade with him, and he hasn't wasted anything but your time... however frustrating that may be.
---
That's just to annoy us out of the area. Mini nukes work for the sirens then. Lol.
---
I have an extra TSE lever action on PS4 since I went with melee.
---
Nope shits way to expensive 
---
Certain people are repeatedly claiming it is. Seen sod all to disprove it that later wasn’t disproven itself.
---
I want this so bad. 
---
PSN is Neojinnx.  I don't know how awake or coherent I will be at 10 pm tho.  lol
---
They must be from NA
---
The economy in this game sucks right now. Caps aren’t worth much and the only items people want to trade for good items is specific specialty rare armor.
---
My little brother would love one
---
Theres a few spawn points, cant remember them all but the 
---
1-bathroom across the hall from the crafting station (2nd floor)
---
2-the theater department back stage in the tiny barn.
---
3-ive seen it spawn occasionally around the cafeteria area on the second floor.
---
And theres a few more i cant recall at the moment.
---
But if its working as intended it should quest marker the mask for you. Once you pick up the mask then it quest markers the bucket of candy. If your solo just go kill ghouls and keep taking it
---
PS: the candy is an amazing way to stay full. Very light, and i usually have around 1000 on me at any given moment. Replaces food without having all that carry weight
---
125 caps for a stimpak? i guess ill just die
---
Sure that’s fine I could make poems for Oblivion Skyrim and Fallout 3 since I played them to death.
---
I found mine on a table around the side of the Whitesprings resort, where some board games were being played.
---
To the people posting "Well I can kill them just fine!" That isn't the point of this post, they arn't difficult to kill, something is just off with the damage they deal as the games treating it like true damage or some shit similar to the mirelurk queens acid at launch. This is a post trying to determine if this is BUGGED not whether Gutsy's are TOO HARD.
---
new character: muadib 
---
FWIW if you collect crop plants and stash them they will spoil, but if you plant them and then scrap them they don't get a condition bar and they never spoil. It's only useful for those few plant types but I thought it was worth mentioning here.
---
I want a fridge, but I also want them to make it that any food items that are tagged for sale in the upcoming player vending are also spoil free or reduced spoil rate. I want to sell uncommon cooked items but I don't want to dedicate my life to restocking spoiled stock.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they're doing some type of a/b testing to see what sells better.
---
Nice deal but where do you get flux?
---
Thanks appriciated.!! 
---
Just put the stairs outside your house along the outter wall.  You'll have a small outcropping but the ceiling can be totally filled up above the main house.
---
That’s a hell of a drop man! Good stuff! The queen dropped me a 3*** zealots Gatling plasma but it’s not explosive sadly. Still decent though.
---
I’ve heard the Gatling gun is one of the better heavies but I sadly can’t use it when I am running the minigun because the minigun tries to load in ammo when I switch to it. 50 cal is good too though. Just need to find a good legendary.
---
Did a queen fight last night with this minigun and it definitely helped, though her bloated health pool post patch made it tougher to see how much damage I was doing. Had a fun glitch where my minigun broke but I was able to keep using it though so that was pretty sweet
---
wait, you believe many people play with your girlfriend? very understanding of you...
---
The benefit of logging all loot I find is that it avoids any biased memory towards feels good/feels bad drops. I've read Wood drops are all over the place, but once measured for myself, it turned out it shows up slightly above uniform distribution and from the 76 2-3\* legendaries I found, 41 dropped armor and only 6 of these drops were wood (14.6%). The overall wood drop (30 instance total) chance is 13.76% from any \* legendary dropping an armor.
---
There is something about the kids at Little Lamplight that scream poetry to me (the original kids who were left there after the War) or the Capitol still standing, ruined reminder of a bygone age.
---
I don't recommend melee/rifle. As others have pointed out, shotguns require strength and rifles require perception so they don't really overlap well. I've been approaching builds in this game from the perspective of a purist. I want to experience what it's like to be all in on rifles, shotguns, and melee so I can get a good baseline on what is achievable with each before I start any hybrid builds.
---
This is the George Carlin bug. Noice.
---
I help people all the time. Ive been helped by others a ton. Ive been killed by people who took my stuff and others who haven't. Ive come across bags and looted them. Ive killed people for the bounty and left their bags. Variety is the spice of life. I just died. Am i gonna get my shit back? I dunno but i better hurry and find out! I think it makes it exciting. Not too many moments I  this game that actually make me anxious so i enjoy that aspect. The only real boner kill is when i glitch die drop my stuff and server crash....id like to have the option to flag Bethesda for pvp in those moments. 
---
yes, but you are not able to use more perk cards, if that was your question.
---
Boredom is what is up. Nothing new to do, so let’s go grief and blow up camps. 
---
No problem, good luck getting your legendary heavy combat armor :)
---
Yes.
---
We need T.O.W.Ns
---
Get a couple of Troubleshooter's leather pieces (upgraded as much as you can), and he hits like a kitten.  
---
X01 jetpacks now in stock. 
---
tea bags build character....it just works
---
I got a TS fat man, so I wanted to give it a  try...went to  watoga and aimed at a robot about 40m away. The shot killed me...dont know why, but not useful...
---
Still got it? =]
---
This is fantastic.  I'd love to come visit your shop.
---
What's the best way to find you? via PSN gamertag?
---
Yes.  There was a duped level 5 TSE floating around for awhile and I have a level 5 Vampire Pump Action 
---
If your character is named Rico!
---
I would like on for my friend so we can play together 😁
---
I take like a dozen (most of which are trash) and keep the best one.
---
Data is sexy.
---
It wasnt an event so much as an ideology. Post WWII real world went full on miniature electronic and focused on wind and solar energies. Clearly, the miniature electronic thing never happened in the fallout universe and they went for fusion energy far earlier and with more effort than we did. The result is a greater mastery of atomic power and gigantic supercomputers, which led to highly advanced AI.
---
Fus Roh REEEEE REEEEE
---
Did you kill the robot?
---
I think it was a snowball of effects like the transistor never being invented for one.
---
here is a [timeline](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline)
---
Run a full set and it’s even better. Find them with senior cavalier and laugh at the little robot. 
---
Ironic.. considering your flair.  :P

Colonel Gutsy should be dangerous and deadly.  After all, this is exactly what he was made to do.  He is a front-line soldier designed to withstand sustained enemy attacks while dishing out the damage.
---
That being said, however, a fully ranked up Robotics Expert perk card gives you a 75% chance of pacifying robots.
---
I don't see much point in server hopping for this experiment of mine. Since there is no way to control what server I land on, from my perspective, its just another randomly chosen base distribution to work with for hours, assuming the servers have individually setup chance tables. I'm also not doing this for finding the best loot, but finding all loot and build up a dataset for analysis. Over the course of the two week, I kept about 10 items and use only 2 of them. The rest sit in my stash waiting for player vending or a lucky lvl 45-55 who has likely use for them.
---
Good question...respawned ran over to where it was. And nothing dead around me, so I honestly dont know.
---
thanks, i do understand we cant ever place more than the card limit to equal 15 points for the actual card values listed on the cards themselves, but some card perks boost the actual SPECIAL levels, so they might exceed the 15, i see now we can exceed that perk limit
---
:)
---
Ty lol
---
Ok so you've never played any of the other fallout games. Gotcha.
---
Died once, other player picked my bag. Offered to give them back. I told them I died and that’s how the mechanics works. I didn’t get to the bag fast enough. It’s my fault. Not hard once you admit it’s your own fault you died. 
---
If you don’t want to die maybe not using that weapon that often cost that? Choices have consequences come with them. If you choose to use that weapon then accept the consequences that it comes with. 
---
To me you are just projected your own guilt of dying because of your fault to another player that luckily pick up your bag. 
---
I like the challenge, and the hardest thing about it is that there is always five to seven of them, so you'll have to break line of sight and ambush them, or get them close to a car and blow that one up, and so on. Real tactics, for a change.
---
My gripes with the Gutsies is immersion, or the breaking thereof. These guys are hovering, yet are able to fire AA ballistic ammo at us with no visible recoil at all? Every shot should send them flying if the devs applied real physics here. The laser Gutsies are the more believable variant (mind that *those* are no challenge whatsoever, because lasers in this game...).
---
Wth?
---
How is that even useful
---
PC or Console?
---
The most concrete event that can be pointed to is the 1940s where the Transistor was not invented leading to advancements in Analog technology that did not happen in our world. The transistor was later invented in the 2060s? If I recall. This is all from memory.
---
There are some other bits and bobs of lore that indicate the divergence may be even further back but that is the one event we have a concrete date for.
---
It is important to remember that not only is the timeline different, physics are different, the Fallout world operates on SCIENCE! not science. The kind of technology Fallout has is pure science fantasy, not science fiction.
---
Here's a solution! Make the frigan servers selectable! Most of our problems come from the fact that nothing is permanent. Make servers selectable, and make actions on said server permanent. Then allow teammates to build together.
---
Yeah, same here. Besides, it's not 1998 anymore and we're not playing Diablo 2...we should be able to transfer our stuff securely!   
---
Besides, Bethesda supporting this feature encourages alts, which means more playing, cosmetic purchases, etc. It's good business for them.
---
F
---
Does this sub truly deserve such [OC]?
---
If you craft it, then make sure to pop a mentat. Berry I think.  Increased intelligence helps with longevity of item.
---
I've done it alone. It's awesome experience
---
Hey. Sure just dm me an address or po box and I'll be happy to send it over
---
If we did have a T.O.W.N.S would it be a conjoined base, or a separate entity that’s more suitable for a home base, while Camps are more for on the go usage or resourc harvesting?
---
Oh scorchy you little devil you.
---
Sure! Just send me an address or po box and I'll get it packed up
---
I've been a staunch non-76 lover specifically because of the online/multiplayer aspects, but damn I gotta say - this is pretty fricken neat and highlights the positive of a multiplayer game. Good job. 
---
the star of China and the Free States is the same, only difference is a lack of color. are we really so different? both seek an america, free of US government control after the war. 
---
Damn, that's pretty ridiculous 
---
"what's the deal with sugar bombs anyways, they aren't even bombs"
---
It's definitely not necessary but at the end of the day people want good loot for end game content.
---
Getting a spear from the queen is like getting a purple legendary after a raid in Destiny. 
---
I'm getting to the point of trying to trade/buy a legendary handmade and rifle. I can't get either now matter how much legendary farming I do. Got a 3\* rolling pin from the fissure prime blast zone last night though, along with a useless combat armor and plans I already had from the queen. It's getting so frustrating. My guy is a sniper build and I seem to only get heavy guns like cryolaters and flamers, or weak melee weapons like rolling pins or lead pipes and knuckles. I don't even care about armor anymore, just want those two rifles and I'll be happy, my luck they will be one star junkies though.
---
Did I miss something? I had no idea backpacks are getting added to the game.
---
The sound is the problem. Unlike his voice, his weapon sounds like a pea shooter. That thing should sound like a .50 cal going to town, or like a round from the railroad rifle. Then you’d take notice and get to hustling before your eye sees your HP does.
---
Every time I went up there at least two showed up for the longest time....haven't been back since.
---
At 39 I'm 100% exactly the same
---
Or just have the same one share..
---
One seeks a change of government control from one entity to another.  The other just wants to be left alone.
---
Anecdotally. I have 3 two shot explosive guns on my character at all times and one aae, two of them are handmades one is a combat shotty and another a pump action shotty. They do not seem to increase my chances of getting similar weapons. Also, full assassin sentinel armor, same deal. My drops seem to be in line with your findings. 
---
He still bought the game despite reviews didn’t he?
---
From my point of view the game has only gotten better. I have no issues finding ammo i use and i don't seem to notice a difference in leveling except for the fact I can level without the server reboots.
---
I was going to say that 25 pounds is more than enough but then realized that some weapons can exceed that easily. 
---
Either way, being able to transfer items between characters on same account would be a boon for people that are build plan, recipe, and outfit completionists.
---
Would be nice to be able to twink out my starting character with crafted and modded weapons and armor.
---
Making a delay. Between sonic screams doesnt really matter when its 2 or more, in a small area. It was unbearable. 
---
This isn't reply relevant but at the glasses cavern yesterday there was 6 scorchbeasts
---
I have thought the exact same thing! I love Runescape and it definitely could work in FO76.
---
44 western and single shot all same dmg but different reload speeds. Pipe suck but barely break and 10 m would be in between.
---
bloody with crit dmg and sneaking will do the most dmg. 
---
the prices are absurd the 'sales' should be what the normal price is.
---
Because it's fallout, you don't find what you need on your current character playthrough , try harder or maybe it wasn't meant to be. Sorry 
---
People are trying to give you helpful advice so that you have more fun playing, but your responses make me think you feel like they're just arguing with you. Maybe you could try to see it in that light and pick up some tips that help you enjoy the game more. I know I am.
---
That's insanity. I dont want to even chance crafting enough ammo to deal with that, cause your gonna have to have several guns for when they break, and thousands of rounds. 
---
Also yes. 
---
True I dealt with 2 at the pumpkin house though I felt that the delay did make it much more bearable for me personally, as for Sunnytop I stay away or walk in from the nearest ft point. It's always a damned ambush when I ft directly in.
---
Yeah me and my friends we all waste crap loads of ammo and resources killing scorched beast only for us to get 216 xp in return and lvl 15 lightweight trapper left leg
---
Ok.. you are planning on fixing this one, but not the Slay Bells - which other folks "bought" on the Atom Shop?  Fix both please.
---
That and the game is cheap so a lot of kids are getting it. I'm running into a lot more children
---
About these two, I'd say neither is particularly difficult so long as you have Enforcer or some perk like that.
---
Assaultrons, yes, their laser hurts like hell.  But you can cripple their head quite easily and then they are reduced to melee attacks.
---
The Mirelurk Queen's spit is corrosive, but you also see it coming.  You can cripple the Spouts and she can't do it anymore.
---
The problem with Colonel Gutsy, in my opinion, is that while he has definitive weaknesses (the thruster, the arms), in the time it takes to aim-and-shoot or VATS over to that target, taking damage feels unavoidable, particularly whenever there's more than one.
---
Yes, she is really broken. She has been immortal or flown off to the north at least 3 of the times I have battled her. Also, she hasn’t dropped legendary items twice. The last one I received a standard metal left leg. Bethesda said they were fixing her and making the loot more legendary. Unfortunately they appear to have accomplished the opposite. 
---
I can only say, keep farming Whitesprings/Watoga. On average, you should get one each in 200-300 legendaries killed.
---
Great samurai haircut! Not the fake, hipster version, but [the real one.](https://hairstylecamp.com/wp-content/uploads/Chonmage-hairstyle-for-men-19.jpg)
---
With well over 1000 legendary armor pieces looted, and over 200 currently in stock on one of my characters, I have only received a small number of Unyielding, which is mostly 1\* leather and goes to a vendor.
---
Even worse is the chance to get a Sentinel's modifier, which I think I've only gotten maybe 5 times total.
---
I lost all of my Weight Reducing 3\* Combat armor about 5 weeks ago (Game just ate it), and I've only gotten 2 replacement pieces since then, but traded a TSE for a couple pieces yesterday from a player that seems to get quite a few.
---
RNG can be a fickle bitch, sometimes, it's just so random.
---
The economy obeys no logic to me lol, I can sell a descent legendary weapon or bit of armour to a vendor and only get 8 caps for example but craft a Halloween costume and the vendor bot gives me 54 caps even though logically in a post appocolyptic survival environment something that essentially kept you alive for longer would have more value, well in theory anyway lol 😂
---
The transistor was invented, just 100+ years later than in OTL.
---
There are indications of other things farther back--the Mothership Zeta content and the Cabot House quest line from Fallout 3 &amp; 4 respectively--but some of the implications remain hazy.
---
ah ok thanks for the tip.
---
This is on you. 
---
 \&gt; Screw this. I'm going to go play Apex 
---
Later. You won't be missed. 
---
Look just because they tolerate mods doesn’t mean they’ll tolerate private servers. Now I could be wrong as they may allow a limited form of private server to exist but with the checks at balances that Bethesda will want included. But I reckon they won’t because no studio has very been given up control of an online game. There games as a service model resolves around giving away content to keep us the punters engaged while selling us vanity extras for real world cash. The biggest player in this market is Fortnite with there most excellent keeping up with the Jones’ approach. 
---
One person was from America so there is still 1 more copy left. Europe only.
---
I have been playing with a pistol build as of late. Even went the Bloodied/Unyielded route to try some things out.
---
Anything armored has been an issue. Robots are a bitch, 4-5 shots with a level 45 Somerset Special (armor pen).
---
It has helped quite a bit with "body part" targetting inside the VATS. Targetting the stingers on radscorpions for example, they drop pretty quick. Headshots on anything with two legs, etc.
---
Where pistol build really shines for me is the Gun-Fu perk. Once that thing spools up with a little Adrenaline mixed in, we actually become useful in the SBQ fight by taking down all the adds before they get to the big guys. On 2 of the 3 queen fights I have taken him to, have gotten a lot of positive feedback on the fact that the add swarm was handled before the big guns even realized they were there.
---
My dream pistol at this point would be a furious/armor pen if such a thing exists.
---
A Western Revolver already 1 shots ghouls, scorched in the head. I don't know if Instigating would push the damage high enough to drop the bigger super mutants in one shot.
---
Not my most favorite build by far, but I am going to press on until at least level 120 before deciding for sure.
---
But theyll come water your vegtable starch farm and maintain your water purifiers. Its a good deal
---
I feel like Colonel gutsy and high lvl turrets (explosive rounds) are some of the most painful enemies in the game.
---
I'm all for a challenge, diversity in the enemies you fight, but these things shred your health in what feels like an unbalanced manner
---
Me.
---
Any updates on TSE vs AAE?
---
&gt; why don't you try sorting 40 power armor chassis
---
And I just wish the actual preview would show the Power Armor. Not just the fram.
---
And also... Renaming...
---
you're the GOAT
---
How many weapons you carry on you? do you run gunsmith? And do you use weapon artisan when you repair?
---
I swap between a be combat shotgun (cripple and add clear) and an aae handmade on the queen and neither one goes under 100%. 
---
I like having the weapon repair kits in the Witcher iii and it would be very much appreciated in FO 76. 
---
I do enjoy the thrill of putting my loot in a box and hoping the person I’m using stays on the server and no ones takes my stuff. Reminds me of the diablo 2 days haha. No issues yet but I’m sure it’s going to happen at some point. 
---
If you go down in the woods today  
---
You're sure of a big surprise  
---
You'd better go in disguise!
---
For every beast that ever there was  
---
Will gather there for certain  
---
Because today's the day the  
---
Scorch Beasts \[will\] have their picnic 
---
AA is only better when using a Hardened receiver, and that's only by less than 0.5%. Other than that, TS will always do more damage.
---
It's to encourage you to trade with other players. If you're on PS4 I can show you some different farming techniques and routes depending on what you're wanting? If you just wanna make caps slow and steady, clear out the vendors every day with either Golf outfits, straight jackets, or ranger uniforms. 1400 caps a day means 9800 a week
---
Ooof, for real man. 
---
Not at all.
---
I believe I made it quite clear that I'm happy having a big scary enemy in the world.  But at the same time, I want it to be scary for the right reasons.  There's a fine line between a difficult enemy and one that feels somehow broken, and Colonel Gutsy leans toward the latter end of that to me because he is *so* outlandishly damaging compared to even Scorchbeasts.  Like I said, if any one of those things changed - his acquisition time, the time between shots, the damage per shot, or the level scaling (if that exists) - he'd probably be balanced, especially if they intend to have more than one of them at once.
---
Bro, you are leveling. Pick up one of the thousand guns at your feet and move along. 
---
The vendors don't care about legendary stats, they pay the same for a no star as a 3 star
---
id say buff the base damage to 1000. and add an ultracite receiver for it. turns the mini nukes into Nuka Nukes from fallout 4. 
---
to craft them you would need 1 Quantum Nuka cola, stable Cobalt flux and some ultracite. adds double the damage per mini nuke's base damage
---
Sorry about the mess.
---
It doesn't full repair... It repairs based off of the quality of the gun being dismantled for repairs. Also, rarer weapons being harder to maintain was a part of 3 and NV, kind of a part about "being rarer".
---
I could definitely agree with you there, something that doesn't sound akin to the 10mm pistol would be good hahaha
---
I have a very bad feeling about this...
---
Added you. Hmu whenever. I should be around all day Saturday as well 
---
HOAs are for dirty communists!
---
Sorry about the mess...
---
lol - i tossed in 2 or 3 mini nukes outside of Watoga on a bunch of Super Mutants. It only killed 1 and I was then attacked by 5. Used my handmade to finish them off but if I stand too close to a mini nuke launch - I'M DEAD!!!
---
&gt;It seems the drops are biased towards on-foot Weightless, Leather armor wearing, PvP fugitive, Bloodied/Furious builds wielding Ski Swords and Western Revolvers.
---
That image in my head...
---
If it works like ammo weight reduction then it stacks multiplicatively not on top of each other so there is some benefit
---
Tested with max bandolier and 20% ammo weight reduction
---
Dumb question but does AA or armor piercing work with the gauss rifle? 
---
I'd even settle for a mail system. Add some NPC mail bots roaming the wasteland to make it lore-friendly - maybe only delivering to railway stations.
---
Fast Traveled to Watoga Station and saw 3 Colonel Gutsys dead thought wow glad i didnt have to kill those an up to the parking lot and saw 6 of them. Ran back into the station hid in the bathroom and left the server.
---
Dump your stuff in a box and tell your friend to stay in the server. Switch, and find the box. Or take note of a player in a server, then find them on the Social tab once you've switched characters and join that person's server
---
I’ll just leave this ESO emote here:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VQfYfEEbvoo
---
Wait yes also same
---
I think the screeching has increased with each patch.
---
If ya want so real fun grab Poseidon and the junk yard and have a camp near by for 3x damage. 
---
Bonus grab all the vertiabird workshops too.
---
If it helps BoS and tactics aren't canon. Is it just the respect to the lore that you don't like Fallout as Fallout anymore?
---
To add for anyone else, this isn't a new phenomenon. This appears to happen regularly. My own personal experience is with Socom. the change from 2 to 3 with the additions of vehicles and then 3 to 4 with all sorts of new "systems" not mainstays of the series. $ could have been good, had they just not called it a Socom game. Would Fallout 3/4/76 have been good without the name Fallout tied to it?
---
Or is this a natural evolution like GTA2 to 3? From the top down view to the behind the character? Somehow GTA has not only kept their audience, but grew.
---
Meanwhile I get bomber jackets like they're going out of style.  Which, I don't know, are they?
---
Tested this and can confirm. I died with some scrap wood, who cares right? So I turned off the recover mission. Started playing today and as a ton of scrap, jumped from too high and died. No recover mission. Went in the pipboy turned it on and got the mission marker back.
---
I have a T60 PA with all the mods and honesty the Gutsy is one of the more difficult enemies out there.  It takes several grenades from my launcher and at least 4-5 shots from my TSE to get through just one.  And they inflict a LOT of dmg.  
---
So they stack? Good to know
---
I think so. I’ll ask him when I get home from work later tonight.
---
Why dont they just give us unlimited stash sizes, all the plans, and free travel at this point!
---
Thanks for responding. I was getting lost in the back in forth of "my math is better than your math."
---
No problem!
---
Pretty sure they’re lowering the weigh in the next update.
---
How much would shipping be to canada ive got a friend that’s been waiting so long to get a copy so we could play
---
Why not add someone to your friends list, log off, then rejoin the same person? All you have to do is find a willing participant. 
---
Try searching at r/falloutlore
---
This has been discussed ad-nauseum there IIRC
---
This just made me realize how much of my stash space is probably being wasted with magazines.
---
How the hell am I supposed to know when I'm going to run into Mothman?
---
Why can't I sell these things to vendors like bobbleheads?
---
That’s not a dumb question at all and I’m also curious
---
Would suggest looking forward to pieces that reduce food/chem weight instead. Hardly use the junk weight perk/abilities since they increased storage
---
The good news is that, since shotgun perks are largely in strength, you won't have SPECIAL points to move around. 
---
I don't really follow the logic that shotgun/melee makes more sense than rifles/melee because of this fact. Sure, one stat governs both, but that means that your perk cards are competing for only 15 slots of space. You can't be fully kitted for both weapon types at the same time, and pausing to swap isn't an option on-the-fly.
---
I do bloody rifles/melee and I'm happy with it. My stats are 14 (2 gladiator), 14 (2 rifleman), 3 (radicool), 3 (squad maneuvers), 6, 5, 8 (bloody mess, tormenter, class freak). (Perks in parentheses are choices that might not be obvious.)
---
Kicking Commie ass since 2018
---
Yeah that's a good idea
---
I learned when this happened that adrenal affected melee.... I was really missing out lol
---
Also, in game I can shoot someone if the face point blank with a shotgun. Giving them the middle finger seems a lesser evil.
---
I've actually been having an issue on PC with the Assaultrons, especially around Watoga. Basically, they get to spam their head laser attack constantly. I'm running full levle 50 X-01 Power armor, which is supposed to have some of the best energy resists in the game, and that laser starts ripping me down quickly when they are just constantly using it with no charge up time at all. If it was just them attacking like normal it wouldn't be an issue, but I know they aren't supposed to be able to spam that head laser.
---
Yes because Guass Rifles do Ballistic Damage. 
---
Well, either you can log out and back in, to hopefully get a new server.. OR you have a bounty, and can't see anyone else on the map.
---
Yep.
---
If this is how he's supposed to be, that's fine.  But in light of the Scorchbeast nerf and the Mirelurk Queen nerf, I only question if Colonel Gutsy is an enemy that fell through the cracks or was misconfigured somehow.
---
Yeah, my testing was flawed, misleading and ultimately binned. Especially whitesprings with Basic Mobs dropping (albeit trash) Legendary loot, and a ton of other factors you have mentioned, trying to get useful data on Legendary spawns is hard.
---
 Your approach makes more sense, has more data and is useful. Thankyou. 
---
Side note, if they ban for server hoping I'll be first on the list. My quest to get calibrated X-01 shocks from the bunker alone would put me in the top 1% :)
---
 No. I find the leavings at the various vendors there, and downstairs, almost the best way to acquire the ones I want.
---
I bought a second copy of the game for cheap and I stream the game from an Nvidia shield geforce-now on my mule account just to transfer stuff to my main. This is also nice because if I make an alt I can leave my main up and use his camp on my alt.
---
Quantity over quality
---
Great idea!!!
---
Get Enforcer, agi perk. Aim low. Cripples legs. Walk over at leisure and finish off with melee or some shots to an immobile head.
---
From when me and a buddy whmere test 2 at a time they seemed to though that may have been multi signal flares.
---
Was back in early December. 
---
 Yeah my OSE almost lost me a Deathclaw yesterday. You would think something that big would not get lost. ;)
---
doesnt affect radiation dmg.
---
Ummmmm........pretty sure I got purple loot in destiny all the time my dude. Poor comparison. Facts are this: y'all bitching bout the loot bc all you want is god tier shit. Everything else is just paper bag fodder. Like my spear. You would've wined and cried about getting it as a drop  bc it isn't god tier. Whereas me, I was like "damn, swing speed and it weighs as much as a Bobby pin, sweet". 
---
The trading community has fucked your standards for loot because of the overflow of top notch gear. Imagine if they actually fixed duping and wiped ALL duped items. Not just stacks. But ALL (I know I know. They can't blah blah blah. This is food for thought). Your whole view on loot would be completely different. Rare things would actually be rare. People wouldn't have full sets of badass armor and top tier weapons and armor would be damn near impossible to trade and buy bc it would actually be RARE
---
My final thoughts: y'all lazy, spoiled brats whining bc rng won't give you what you want. 
---
What modifiers do you want? I have a level 45 one with bloodied and 90%reduced weight.
---
This is the main problem currently, you don't normally hear him shooting if there is a lot going on until it is too late.
---
I also think that there is a problem if I have to prioritize his little pop gun over an assaultron beam of doom.  I have literally ignored assaultrons before when I spotted a gutsy behind them and that doesn't make sense to me.  A mass produced military bot shouldn't pose more of a threat than an streamlined assasin murder bot with an annihilation beam for a face.
---
Isn't that what the CAMP is for?
---
That too.
---
I don't wanna take that thrill away from you! Maybe drop all your legendaries down the water slide at Wavy Willard's and then run down to get them?
---
For what it is worth... the SBQ health doesn't scale based on # of people, her DR does.
---
I watched a battle between a Colonel Gutsy and an Assultron Dominator. Gutsy won with 75% life
---
I'll be doing some fusion core runs tonight, thanks. Great routes in comments too.
---
Enjoy taking every workshop
---
Had that happen to me. Relogging fixed it, though.
---
What? They announced private servers would be a thing before the game even came out.
---
Unfortunately, you aren’t wrong. There aren’t a lot of keepers, but you get lucky once in awhile 
---
If it gets tiring, you can mix it up with Westek, Watoga, and Harper’s Ferry. 
---
My 4yo came down when he was supposed to be asleep and saw be blasting some super muties off my lawn. He asked “Why you hurt Hulk?”
---
I had to explain that’s no Hulk, that’s an Abomination.
---
But seriously, the shit you see in this game is way worse than being rude.
---
Yep.  Game is lacking in end game tough enemies right now.
---
 WV Lumber up north has a Pump on a table and some of the Muties have em'.
---
To be honest that doesn't even sound like a 10mm to me. half the time you don't even hear the shots going off if there are a lot of other enemies in the area.  Gutsies have killed me several times (even in X-01) before I even really knew they were there because of how quiet the gun is and there is no way to differentiate a high level from a low level without seeing their name and level.
---
I don't mean to sound pretentious but you should try to hit the thruster even without using VATS. Much more dps even if you miss a couple shots.
---
On xbox...had mutation before patch and it wasn't working after. So I got rid of all mutations and then put them back on. Has worked for me ever since, definitely not as strong without rad worms though. Not sure if that helps.
---
This. I generally aim for the ground in front of the mob and the explosive blast cripples the entire mob. You can then let others tag and finish them off. 
---
Don't think I should have a bounty as I've only just logged in and the last time I was on I only completed a few quests I tend to avoid others and wrongdoing haha
---
If I have two at my camp, do they both fire?
---
Yeah that's a good point shall get on that now
---
I thought it so as well, but Awareness shows a constant 300 DR for me, even when I was alone. Besides, I did calculations and even if her DR scaled linearly, the ammo required scales sub-linearly, which is not what I've experienced. So either the Awareness doesn't properly show the total DR or her health gets rescaled. There was a PC mod showing the health numbers but I haven't found a picture taken of the queen's health.
---
Well it would probably make more sense if YOU had 100 int. Lol
---
Ummmmm......
---
Are we having a discussion or are you trying to win an argument?
---
I thought we were having a discussion but suddenly yo just started acting like a child......wtf?
---
Hmm to the testing grounds
---
Have you seen it post patch? I’ve been server hopping all the vendors the past couple days trying to find combat Armor mods/plans and no one seems to have them. I found one torso mod at Welch and that’s it :/ 
---
And at least for a week at a time so people don't skip a day of playing and miss out on it.  Awful management.
---
This ia good to know...im so sick of getting wood armor for legendary drops....who even wants that??
---
But I love my vampires lead pipe lol.  I use almost nothing else in lower level areas.  Apart from the occasional surprise level 30-60 enemies I encounter near Billings Homestead.  
---
Higher durability on crafted items, more scrap from breaking down guns and armor.
---
I remember picking these up as a workshop defense event. You dont have to own the workshop to participate in the event. Show up, help defend, and make it known to the owner that you are not there to steal the shop. Free plans.
---
I’ve found multiple pieces is assasins sentinel and TSE so I think you’re misrepresenting the availability of these items. You sound salty tbh. These players were harassing his friend so I don’t think they’re oh so innocent and naive as you claim lol.
---
I named mine Wade and put all the facial scarring I could find on him. 
---
That Thunderbirds-styled paint job on the X-01 is beautiful. Between that and the USAF markings on the Carbon paint, it's really cool to see the Air Force getting some love in Fallout.
---
sorry, been there few times but since I got most plans I was looking for, I didn't bother to check.
---
Myself. Although my character has a much more svelte and gym-worthy figure! 😂 
---
Grenade launcher..,
---
FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
Post your item and ask for a "price check".
---
You can also search there for similar items.
---
Please note, items with 1, 2, and 3 GOOD legendary effects can vary wildly in pricing.
---
Super Sledge - Bloody = less than 1k
---
Super Sledge - Bloody / Swing Speed = 5-10k
---
Super Sledge - Bloody / Swing Speed / Reduced Weight OR +1 STR = Pretty much un-buyable for caps now.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Sounds like you paid a visit to the mos eisley spaceport.  Be careful though - you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villany! 
---
Sweet!
---
25k health for the SBQ. I will grab one later this evening.
---
If you still have one left i wouldn’t mind giving one to a friend
---
Yeah it’s not ideal but almost necessary in a way until Bethesda adds in vendor bots and hopefully a grand exchange at some point. One problem with hitting the cap limit is if you want to sell something then you have to start accepting other items like ultracite ammo and that’s why some people got banned so it’s not an ideal situation imo because it leaves you having to trust the other person won’t scam you.
---
nope, is behind the mall much farther south. 
---
Camps are static not mobile. There’s an inherent cost every time you pick up and move, $25 caps.
---
Backpacks have NO COST to use (*assuming no switching and adoption costs),  increase your carry capacity and provide mobile camping resources like a tent a stove.
---
Your condescending attitude towards muh spear irks my nerves a little bit. Plus, you started this convo being a sarcastic pric. Lmao. 
---
Wish it was the mothman, but yeah is the statue. 
---
Oh I know what's next
---
Buuuuuuurn
---
Sure, my u/ is same as my psn 
---
thanks, this may well have been all there is to it. That quest is a mess tho! i'd done it before without bothering to try yao guai or deathclaw, and did find the radstag herd that time. was several patches ago.
---
Have plans for the underarmor itself ever been available or do you just have to buy the underarmor?
---
A quick check I always do is check the social tab for recent players. It accounts for "everyone" if you've switched worlds, but is accurate on your first login of the day.
---
To answer your question, I'd say no it shouldn't happen. However, if you are like me, you'll be fine playing completely alone.
---
I got it from DEFENSE: ABANDONED BOG TOWN
---
I'll be getting a new pc soon so will be joining the ranks.  
---
Favorite place to be right now
---
When I was messing around with building ideas.. I've made a CAMP off the side of a bridge, then made a trap/false floor right inside of the front door. If you open the front door and walk right in, it is impossible to see, until you are falling way way down.. there was another metal-walled building at the bottom with a small hole in the roof that you would fall into. If you survived, it was full of spike boards, turrets, and a pressure plate that turned on flamethrowers. My next plan was to get the Radiation emitters. 
---
I kept this built for about 30 mins, until a level 14 fell into it and died.. I felt really bad, so broke it down.
---
I got it from a workshop. 
---
First world problems
---
Yeah nobody appear there initially, however a level 2 and 3 player have loaded in. Maybe I'm just on a low level server or something ? Not sure how it works I'm level 35 so not too high
---
So have you been selling all the legendaries you get so far? I have a hard time letting even a good one star go sometimes, luckily Bethesda’s saving me and my stash with this legendary vendor lol.
---
By chance are you "Wanted"?  Wanted players won't be able to see any other players on their map.
---
Thank you for the correction. 
---
It doesn't matter if it doesn't fully repair it, you can easily stockpile common weapons and use them to repair the one you're using if that's what your build uses.  If your build doesn't use a common weapon then you can get fucked.  And rarity of weapons doesn't come into play in this game because a plasma rifle is no better than a pipe rifle.  There's no point in using a rare weapon because a common weapon is just as good but way easier to deal with.  Why bother using the rare radium rifle if you can kill the same enemies just as easily with a common shotgun?
---
Only gotta drink a thimble of water 
---
None of my friends will touch FO76 with a ten foot pole :(
---
New players can easily get an unexpected bounty by picking a lock on an air drop around the starting areas.  Unknown to them that it is a hostile action toward the owner until it is too late.
---
Still have both of them left actually &amp; don't mind sending one over if you're in Europe.
---
still nonsense, and people will just barter instead of using caps because caps can't be used, and barter economies can too have inflation, as seen with the dupe spam
---
the only things influencing the value of caps, other than the player-economy, is how quickly they can be acquired, which is limited to 1400 per character through traders.
---
Same thing with the civil war era top hat. Love it. I no longer have to carry vendor bait because I can just craft up a ton of hats and stash them when I'm ready for the daily cap run. 1 hat is 27 caps, and weighs .1 pounds. Best part is, crafting takes 1 raw cloth.
---
Human Mouse Trap, I love it!
---
You've probably just spun up a new server that new sessions are joining. AFAIK there is no levelling to servers.
---
Yea im in the netherlands so thats all good
---
I know it's been months.. But did you ever figure out if a serum fixes the no positive effects?
---
It's a spear!!!!!
---
What did you expect. It's base damage is practically the lowest of all 2 hand melee's. I've got the exact same thing except it's a pool stick. A pool cue is a blue engram drop.
---
You trolled the OP implying that you get good loot from the queen and then you rattled off a list of crap you can get at the Whitespring without even nuking it. 
---
Oh but you got prime plans?..... nobody uses prime receivers for anything but the queen.
---
Oh you got ultracite mods?.......let me guess..... explosive vents?......I get them every time.
---
I'm not as dedicated to the effort as you, but have kept a talley of weapons/armor looted on many sessions, just to get an idea what the percentage of Epic Drops are (Epic= Weapons players will pay 2500 caps or more for).
---
The number of Legendary's I can loot per hour of gameplay does vary significantly from one server to another, and having a good sized friends list helps with the hopping.
---
Most (80%) of the stuff I loot each evening goes to vendors, world containers, or bag drops for others, the rest, space permitting goes to my vendor characters (I have 4; Weapons, Armor, Aid, Notes) and I frequently have to pull lesser items off of them to make space, but what I consider Epic rolls only comprises about 0.5% of all drops.
---
I tell everyone who complains about not getting great drops, that if you want great drops, "Kill a lot more Legendary Enemies" because you will only get 5 Really Good ones, 150 mediocre, and 800 trash drops out of every 1000, if you're lucky.
---
I'm available this evening on PC after 8pm eastern.  Message me if you are still looking.  I have both of those serums ready to go.
---
Best time to nuke whitespring and run the loop with out turret camps messing it up
---
Is this officially okay with Bethesda?  I haven’t made any “mike” accounts because of the ban hammer 
---
Great gesture man! Top effort!!
---
Well, he does what he says, kicking our (commie) asses.
---
Very cool tattoos! And happy birthday to him
---
It's a little filthy.  But definitely not casual.  
---
That's fine, just send me a message with an address or po box and I'll get it sent over
---
Sounds like someone took it though. 
---
Nice name btw! :)
---
Just keep swinging that Mjolnir, and don't worry about your int! 
---
I think there is a Fissure Site right in that Northern Savage Divide area.  Always a nasty area to be around when you aren't looking for Scorchbeasts.
---
Did they say somewhere they weren’t planning to fix the Slay Bells?
---
Yeah, even visual and audio cues that he’s your top priority.  You kinda die out of nowhere.  If it were a loud and obvious cannon, a portable howitzer, homing rockets (because seriously does he ever miss?), that’d make for engaging fight.  As-is, agree it’s weird that when you piss off all the bots at white spring and are looking at a sentry bot in your face, an assaultron charging the beam at mid range, and a gutsy quietly shooting from a mile away, behind a tree, that the gutsy should be your prime target.
---
Maybe that’s part of the problem, damage stays too high over long range?  Such that he’s always your threat even with other robots in your face.  More of a drop off and ignoring a little less armor, more obvious sound and animation that he’s rocking you.  And then, make other robots more deadly too but keep with this pattern.  Not like the game overall needs to be easier, this is just a little off in terms of how you present a challenging experience.
---
But then again, this is the game that gave us scorchbeasts so I’m not holding my breath
---
To me, you'd always have your shack. It helps to support you as you explore.
---
But if you had formed a team or faction in game, you could with your team build new structures/machines/items to support yourselves together. Maybe town walls and special turrets to go on them. Maybe automated crafting facilities like the FO4 machines stuff. 
---
If you logged in solo you could have access to your stuff. if the team or n% of the team were logged in to the same server you could have access to your stuff and the TOWN stuff as well.
---
This!!!
---
Whitesprings is for shit noobs that he bent figured out there's better places for legendaries. Btw. 
---
I thought the "One S" wasn't an upgrade?  Weren't they a slimmed down, less expensive, version?
---
Go to Flatwoods for some sick brahmin kills.
---
Yeah, they are incendiary rounds.  They are pretty nasty.
---
I suspect they intended for you to use grenades, but I ended up using a Tesla Rifle and felt really clever about it.
---
But CAMPs aren't meant to be static. It's in the acronym itself.
---
For sure, in OP's story those guys are the dicks. I've never met a guy with full assassins sentinels that wasn't using it to be a dick though.
---
&gt;it seems that Bethesda may be banning based on "number of acquired rare items", so if you do a lot of muling, it may be possible to trigger a false positive
---
It should be noted that this claim is being made by the people who were banned, and insist they were totally innocent....just like 99% of people who are caught cheating.
---
Also, their numbers often don't add up.  For example, characters A, B and M(ule).  They "do a lot of muling" between A and B, using M as the go-between.  The numbers they produce when protesting their innocence has A with the most stuff that 'caused their ban'.
---
If their theory was correct, M would have to have the most stuff because it kept handing the items back and forth between A and B.
---
If you can find a link, let me know.  They owe me some atoms if it turns out to be true.
---
TBH - The only thing keeping me from buying atoms is the fact that they won't / can't fix the things they are throwing up there.  Many of those things are stupidly simple to fix.
---
No there’s a cooldown now between screeches. Trust me the SB used to screech non stop sometimes, literally.
---
I have friends who played it, loved it, and returned it, because all the reviews were bad.  NPCs are real, bro.
---
I also don't get the "It's Only 125 Hours of Gameplay" hate.  OK, go blow your $60 ($20 now) on Spiderman or whatever.  See how much entertainment that nets you. 
---
 Shit it costs that to take your date to one 90min movie.  It's no FO4, which you could play twice, then 3-4 more times with various mods, but it's still leading in bang/buck games.  
---
Went from a one to a one x and its significantly better. Idk how it is now but even with the one x it still chugged in areas
---
And get rid of all these pesky quests.    
---
Why would you ever buy a stimpak? Not only can you find them everywhere, they're also super cheap to craft yourself.
---
The only thing worth buying in this game is legendary items other players have sold to vendors and plans to make stuff yourself.
---
It's a random encounter.  The solution is also random.
---
I’ve had my face incinerated by Assaultrons who’s heads I’ve crippled around Watoga. Definite issue. Especially when tossing my stock of five pulse grenades can barely kill one.
---
Im in the process of trying to collect a full set of Troubleshooters armour for silo runs
---
Will be interesting to see what player vending, disenchanting legendaries, and reduced duping do for an economy.  I think those should be their top priority
---
&gt;If you can find a link, let me know. 
---
A link to what? You’re the one implying they said they won’t fix it, it’s on you to prove that claim.
---
The whole transistor thing is  fascinating. Thanks!
---
So I am merely ungifted by the RNG gods. My luck is a 7 plus I usually have seared venison on that’s +3. Not good enough I guess. 
---
what
---
Here's a good [analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsC8io4w1sY&amp;t=1s) of buff vs nerfs. It would be cool if the dev saw this.
---
Ill be on tonight my bad man been working late
---
I have an extra offices couches plan if you are on PC.
---
I'll admit, the Responders quest set a high bar that was never reached again.  The BoS stuff is good, but it's a slog getting there, and you can't know it gets better.
---
Nope, increase your hacker skills yo!
---
It is relevant a little too much I think lol.
---
Try getting hungry and very low health
---
Compare regular tesla to AA testa, not AA tesla to shotgun... And for the testing you don't need kill times anyway, awareness shows a dent in ballistic resistance but not energy resistance. 
---
No worries man, I'm busy as hell myself. Most of my available time will be after 8:30 Central 
---
You'd be a fool not to do at least one Whitespring run per session. It's without a doubt the most reliable spot to find 3* legendary level 50 and above, and you get a ton of 1* that you can sell for caps immediately after a run. Farming Whitespring for hours straight is lame and comparable to a slot machine addiction.
---
I also run Watoga at least once per session.
---
My advice is to hunt Super Mutants and Mr. Gutsy. Avoid Mole Miners and anything that spawn below level 50 unless you want level 40 gear. I'd leave the spear at home if you're going to hunt Super Mutants and Mr. Gutsy though my dude..... LOL.
---
Damn aint no hackerman 3000 !
---
Do you have any issues with it not showing up in HDR randomly? I've got a brand new x1x and new 4k tv and sometimes it will display in HDR, sometimes not (then it's either dark or oversaturated)
---
I don't think we need to buff the player but the enemies. Nerfing just makes things vanilla. The OP got this half right. Return the original nerfs and buff the enemies. Including the SBQ. But not with direct statistics. She needs more attacks and to randomize her patterns.
---
My buddies and I have worked to make our camps as close as possible.  We are sorta within view of each other...
---
End result is we are neighbors, but the forced spacing is a bit much.  It also means that we cannot shift our camps slightly without the others online without possibly preventing their camps from placing.
---
He's a COLONEL, it even says it on his uniform.  He SHOULD pack a punch.
---
&gt; The game is currently balanced so you have to use five perk slits in int to avoid weapon depredation. Weapon kits would screw that up.
---
That is the point.  Having 5 perks equipped simply dedicated to avoiding a tedious and frustrating game mechanic isn't fun.  They implementation of weapon condition in this game is terrible.
---
O918 said this, it’s correct and worked for me :)
---
“You have to buy all of the underarmor mod plans from the enclave production vendor. I dont remember the names, the there are 4tiers: mk1 mk2, mk3, mk4.
---
Vendor will only have mk1 available to purchase at first. Buy it, log out, log in, he will have mk2 available to buy. Rinse and repeat till you get the 4th and final one.”
---
Yeah, “trading” is bugged to pieces and annoying. Dropping bags is unreliable bc they fall through the ground. A share/tradebox or vending aught to be less of a hassle but I’m concerned it’ll bc kind of as buggy as trading. But I’m hopeful, this trade stash is ideal. 
---
Make some cranberry tea as well, it’s only 2% more xp but it can add up in the long run. Also play on a team and use the inspirational perk card.
---
I know how it works. After last patch it got fucked up
---
__Yeah my OSE almost lost me a Deathclaw yesterday. You would think something that big would not get lost. ;)__
---
I've never had a problem with any Mr gutsy's or other robots. I just use a super sledge and berrade them multiple times so they don't even have time to attack.
---
I'm on PS4. 😊 
---
If you are doing anything non automatic rifle related, you're going to want to invest heavily in the rifleman percent cards in perception. There's a base, expert, and master level for 9 slots total to maximize rifle damage.
---
Then why post?
---
There should be more genuine threats like this, imo.
---
One Shot Exploder.
---
My camp is just upstream from site Alpha so I’ve seen this a couple of times. Its great!
---
Whitesprings is 1* capital of Appalachia. And I ran a west tek, then went on down to Robco before logging out to give the spear a test run. Did just fine. Killed super mutants in 2-4 hits and killed the gutsy's in about 4-8 hits. 
---
Sounds like you're just garbage without OP gear. 
---
Looking on Microsoft site the One S can do 4k which mine can't so I though it was thinking it was upgrade.  [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one)   Found this on [How To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/298754/whats-the-difference-between-the-xbox-one-xbox-one-s-and-project-scorpio/) that mentions that it's slightly faster and some other minor improvements. 
---
Some perks to use with this would be Ordnance Express, Bear Arms, Demolition Expert, and Grenadier.
---
Gunsmith can help with the condition. 
---
I'm so tired of seeing posts like this with every game that has a ton of issues. "I've been playing for 20 minutes and I think this game is great" - that's because you haven't been playing long enough to actually get to the issues. Anthem is getting the same thing right now with its paper thin endgame and players who are barely level 10 saying it's fine and there are no issues.
---
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed FO76 a hell of a lot while I played it (I stopped playing a while ago because there's nothing left to do when you're level 160+ with multiple SBQ kills and more legendaries than you know what to do with), but I still think it absolutely deserves a good amount of the flak it has gotten and continues to get.
---
Alright ill be on 
---
I’d so login and watch a play!!
---
There's Ordnance Express for that. If they reduce it for everyone at a base rate, the park becomes useless. The explosive build all together would be trash.
---
Oooohhhh wait, I fucking remember you now!!!! You're the dude that was bragging bout killing the SBQ fast about a week ago. Bahahahahaha. No wonder your style of arrogant pric seemed familiar. 
---
Kinda telling that a Colonel Gutsy does more damage than a Sentry.
---
My bad mate. Meant to go to the other guy
---
I’d like a volunteer to help me test to see if teammates can use my artillery
---
In the context of this thread yeah, I chuckled. Have a good day friend
---
Does the ToS explicitly state that running multiple characters simultaneously is allowed, or is it simply not mentioned?
---
I think the angry emote is sufficient without having a lawsuit happen.
---
I was one of the players. If you guys appreciated our effoets, show us by giving me Reddit Gold. This will encourage us.
---
Happened all the time even in real world. 
---
Seen enough of it and don’t care. I usually just walk away if any game is on. 
---
Don’t put it too personal. It happens. They thought they are smart about it but a lot of times it backfire. Just walk away. 
---
Yeah I did alone last night on XB1 so it must’ve just bugged out for the OP
---
I know someone looking for the jetpack how much
---
I took out a group a bloated glowing ones and mirelurks in nuke zone once. That is the most useful it has ever been. Weirdly enough I've gotten more useful out of nuka grenades.
---
I've definitely encountered this bug as well, assaultrons who quite literally spammed their head laser nonstop. I've had the same thing happen with Scorchbeasts, though I haven't had it happen since the latest patch.
---
Yes, but these don't especially help increase the damage 
---
You too wiggles!
---
Make an offer
---
Yeah we need that. Also please make player vendor stash standalone. 
---
With a "Have a Day" vault boy face tattooed on the butt.
---
It would have to be a system that would have people add/remove a karma point from your character.  Possibly rife with abuse.  Imagine people posting a sob story about how they were griefed and get half the player base to give them negative karma, and they not even being on the board never know why it happened or have any recourse.  
---
I might support a karma system for players interactions, but I want to see the process laid out BEFORE implementation so we can poke holes in it to make sure it's not badly implemented.
---
At least in this case it's just broken rather then an outright lie about what it is, like the emotes. I can only imagine the looks on peoples faces when they bought that, logged into the game, did an emote and it was exactly the same as always with a new icon floating above there head.
---
What an absolute disgrace.
---
Its calleg get a mic for an online game, casul.
---
I found a level 50 mirv launcher and it's base damage was 197....
---
So there's a spot between Wade Airport and Lakeside Cabins with 3 basketballs on a small wooden bridge and a dry creek bed that ends in a drainage pipe.  I've gotten way too much enjoyment out of nudging the basketballs off the bridge and then watching them bounce down the hill.
---
I might like this more than the skeleton catapults.
---
Good thing this isn't the filthy casual sub
---
Gotcha. Wasn’t sure if it qualifies as an energy or ballistic weapon. 
---
So the ammo is affected by batteries included, but tank killer, perforated mags affect its damage. Guess it’s one of those weird weapons that dips into multiple categories for different things
---
I'm not sure it's a song, but Grahm sure is freestyling a lot
---
Tagging enemies in a nuke zone is about as easy as it gets, but I think I see what you're getting at. In short, no, playing the game is how you get XP. I would warn against leveling up too fast. You'll want to get your hands on some good equipment and stuff to sell which can be done while farming XP.
---
Nuka grenades are literally better in every single shape and form 
---
Wish I had friends so this was an issue for me 
---
Guess you haven’t met me lol, but honestly I could still beat a full assasins sentinel without it just using my AAE rifle so I think you’re a little hung up on those effects. They don’t make someone invincible you just have to strategize more. Make them stagger, use grenades things like that and their sentinel effect will be useless. 
---
Some people jus don’t want to PvP and that was part of the game that Bethesda pitched so you can’t be mad about it tbh. If you know where to go eventually you can get all this gear through farming so sorry it hasn’t dropped for you but that doesn’t mean everyone’s duping man.
---
gallery link broken
---
No wonder my AA explosive Gatling laser sucks so much. 
---
Lmao because that was to patch item duplication
---
Or if the server crashes
---
Lol thanks for the support. Wasn’t sure if it was common knowledge and I just missed the boat.
---
The fact that the weapon has crossover into various categories is confusing. Like it uses energy ammo but does ballistic. 
---
Same for broadsider. Ammo is ballistic and weighs less with bandolier, but it’s damage is explosive and isn’t affected by heavy gunner, despite having golf ball sized splash damage
---
I gave in to this and do it also.  Works pretty well.
---
nah, there's not enough of a speed boost to actually notice with the S.. it's more of a cheaper way to get the 4k. You really would need the X
---
I agree, this would be a good feature... how about also give us some quirky quest where you can just reset all perks and attributes using some alien tech or something. 
---
It looks like he's about to give you a big 'Wasaaaaaaaaaap!'
---
I see those gutsies hanging around Watoga - I'm gonna kick their asses!  I wonder if that's a new thing though - only remember seeing them very recently appearing in Watoga.
---
and a suppressor 
---
Where did you find the plans for that?
---
There seems to be some sort of weird thing where the more you farm a certain area, the less likely you are to get 3 star enemies / 3 star items. Last Sunday I ended up having a server to myself, and I did a good 10 hours of straight farming after nuking it. Here's the setup:
---
Second account has a character logged onto the server, just sleeping in base (don't have to worry about food / hydration and things tend to not aggro you or your base while you are sleeping). 
---
Main account did the actual farming. I nuked whitesprings, did my traditional "loop" to clear all the ghouls, then exited game and used the Social tab to rejoin my alt account on the same server. Wait a few minutes for loading, respawn ghouls, kill ghouls, loot, repeat. I did this for 10 or more hours, and I farmed hundreds of legendaries. That's not an exaggeration. 
---
What I found is that although I found a few 3 star enemies that dropped 2-3 star items the first few clears, when there were still other players on the server, after 5 or 6 resets when people started leaving, I would only get 1 star stuff. I went for a good 10-15 runs without seeing a single 2 or 3 star enemy, which I thought was odd. Could just be RNG though. Finally I started getting 2-3 star enemies, but only 1 star legendaries dropped.
---
I should also mention that, even though the nuke zone dissipates after an hour or two, as long as there is a player nearby who was there when the nuke hits (my alt character), bloated glowing ones keep spawning. So I had nice sunny clear weather but also the benefit of farming high exp / better chance of 3 star bloated glowing ones. 
---
After about 6 hours, something strange happened. The golf club specifically started spawning regular ghouls - the level 62 and 42 varaints, not the bloated glowing ones. The rest of Whitesprings continued to spawn in gloated glowing ones. That's not all though. In addition to now spawning in regular ghouls, they seemed to have an extremely high legendary drop chance, and I started getting the occasional 2 and 3 star legendary again. 
---
Normally if you just spam the golf club and clear / reload that over and over, you might get 1-4 legendaries per run. 4 is considered very lucky. I was getting 10-12 legendaries EVERY run once they reset to normal ghouls. Sadly I had to go to bed and leave the server - darn work on Mondays.
---
By the way, out of my hundreds of legendaries I got maybe 10 that were 2 or 3 star, and none of them were "god tier". The best drop in terms of legendary effects was an AA + 10% damage while aiming + 250% DR while aiming Gatling Laser, although I now realize that it's worthless due AA not affecting lasers ( so dumb). If ound MANY single star Furious, Bloody, Two-Shot, etc. I think I only found one explosive. I think with explosive requiring two stars to actually appear, which is already rare, and with it being a more rare secondary affix, the odds of getting bloody + explosive is just insanely rare.
---
Other notes - all kinds of weird things happen when you reload / refresh spawns over and over again on a server. It was, surprisingly, very stable, but world objects started disappearing for my main character. Things like the bus at the golf club, and the ice cooler.
---
yeah this makes no sense to me..do u mean the guantlet
---
I went to Harper's Ferry to farm turrets for the atoms, so that's why they do so much damage.  Explosive turrets!
---
Some sort of perk preset like you mentioned would be good. It gets tiring to have to swap out crafting perks when I want to fix gear.
---
That or even dropping them. I had alot of good ones from farming whitesprings during first patch. I plan on tossing everything except the two weapons I currently use so yes I will be getting rid of a couple top tier weapons. 
---
Much like last guy said with rifleman id do the same with a melee spec, but maybe just the first rank of all 3 cards gets you a 30% dmg bonus for the cost of three points vs 9 points for 60%.
---
Also as a solo build maybe less charisma, and to me endurance feels like a throwaway stat in this game the amount of hp you get per point is a joke
---
&gt;Go online and pick a build, level to 50, to hop on reddit and start buying the gear you need for your build. You can literally make an entire end game build without ever killing a 3* legendary enemy. Just farm caps and or be a douche and go on eBay. 
---
This is so bullshit. You're speaking out your ass. End game build without ever killing a 3-star legendary. Just farm caps. LMAO. are you serious right now? People won't even accept caps anymore as I said in my post. They want other bloodied legendary weapons or explosive weapons. if they don't accept caps and only want you to trade other legendary weapons, that you only get from legendary enemies, good luck with that. 
---
Caps are worthless as fuck right now because everyone high level is already capped on money
---
With your spear I bet.....LOL.
---
How much do you bench press on the internet boy?
---
I play on Xbox and take workshops all the time. Very rarely does anyone contest (mainly Converted Munitions Factory), but personally I don't mind someone contesting as it's the easiest method of finding someone who wants to PvP.
---
Please correct the false  statement with an edit in your post in order to not mislead those not reading the comments.
---
I used to use power armor a lot then I respecced and added points into other stats to get my damage resistance up out of power armor (with BoS combat armor it's at around 435 DR) and a Colonel Gutsy is the only thing I will power armor up in except for radiation zones. Truly a truck hitting enemy
---
I never notice any of those requests since I'm normally used to playing solo. I apologize if you had sent one.
---
Good luck to anyone that applies!
---
Any questions don't hesitate to ask. Unless it's something about physics then I can't help you.
---
Welcome home.
---
Think its players that are at a certain stage of the Mayor for a Day quest line being in the area that causes their spawns. I Farm Watoga quite a bit (Lead and Steel, and some Legendaries) and its rare when they appear.
---
I can’t not throw myself in and say hello I am a lady of Xbox! With no (1) friends currently wanting to finish belly of the beast and I am death before the new content drops! 
---
Correct. Demolition Expert is the only direct DMG increase. But the other perks help the utility of heavy weapons be more viable. Fatman included.
---
Ina world that even a normal crafted gun is pretty good. You don’t have to have godly weapons. 
---
Yes it will one shot everything except the SB and SBQ. 
---
But specific normal craft weapons can do that too. For almost all other normal weapons probably  just shoot couple bullets more and hit two times more per mob.  It’s not the end of the world. I even got a crafted gun have better damage than my TSE. Just need to move your perks correctly and mod correctly. 
---
All the ones I’ve seen are for the would be old bitty fascist dictators who have nothing but time on their hands to annoy their neighbors. 
---
That is how pacifist mode works. People can initiate PvP with you. PvP just prevents you from initiating PvP. Also, I believe the popup was not for a bounty, it shows the reward that you'd give out for losing the PvP.
---
Are you on PC and is any of that Berserker?
---
Ahem..!!
---
So, we are all aware that adrenal reaction doesn't work anymore; i was asking myself why those ugly super mutants took so many bloodied bullets to die.. 
---
I've acquired an adrenal serum from a shady vendor and injected myself the drug but it didnt work as intended, now before acquiring some other serum from other shady vendors can anyone confirm if, after loosing and gaining the mutation again everything goes back to the start? thank you very much; and remember to secure any technical data and piece of dangerous technology you can find around the wasteland!!
---
Still no where near as viable as in fallout 4
---
I play on X's and to be honest, don't notice the difference. Game is laggy, nothing to do with performance of the XBOX. Personally if you can afford it, go with X as it is the current gen. Both S and X offer 4K, so buy it for that reason and not for a better game performance which you will unlikely get.
---
I second this motion!
---
Fireproof perk, a dense armor mod or both. I used to blow myself up all the time on the cars at the Whitespring doing ghoul runs. Now I can tank an explosion while standing on top of the car, it's great.
---
Yeah sadly you just land inside the hatch. Fun fact, if you wait inside the missile room *inside the silo*, the doors will seal after 30 seconds and the launch does kill you!
---
This is BS. You're completely wrong. Pacifist mode prevents you from doing any kind of damage to anyone. someone walks up with PVP on and punches you in the face, and then you start hitting them back, you will do no damage. The pop up even says you will not do any damage to other players unless you turn it off. So even if this guy was hit by the other person and then accidentally hit him back, nothing would happen. He definitely did not have pacifist mode on
---
Same happen to me... Nonsense.
---
Honestly just kill nearby enemies, pick up the loot and sell.
---
This works kind of well. It's still bitten me in the ass more than a few times. They log off or somone comes by and takes the stuff. 
---
Did not know that. That's cool
---
Lmao. 🤷🏻‍♂️ maybe quit yer bitching and people would sell you stuff for caps. 
---
If you have reactive plates on your power armor it will flag you for PVP. so if someone walks up and hits you, reactive plates will deal reflective damage back to them and could definitely flag you
---
The MIRV launcher has multiple warheads. The DMG stat might be for each individual warhead.
---
Whenever you can find me a 10mm drum in real life, then I will agree to this point 
---
But I haven’t seen 10mm drums.  So therefore they would not be in a wasteland situation
---
Now handmade(ak47) drums??? I can go buy one at the corner store basically.  They are everywhere 
---
I thought you could do slap damage in Pacifist? Or is that no damage at all? I could be wrong, I've not played much with pacifist mode.
---
ok, first off, wanting a complete and mostly bug free experience for a full retail release is not too much to ask, the expectations that a game going to shelves for $60 to be complete and mostly bug free at launch are not high expectations in the least.  it is an online game, that's for sure, but other than the aesthetic can you please explain how it's a fallout game?  a fallout game has deep narratives with branching decisions and consequences, is any of that in this game?  finally, just because *you* haven't experienced that many bugs does not mean they do not exist, citing *your* experience as proof of something isn't how it works and is dismissive of many peoples experiences.  there have been good fixes in each patch but I still experience the quest marker and no enemy when taking a workshop many times, the SBQ falls through the map often and the enemy health refilling is still an issue.  even though most things were fixed the game is still not ready for a full retail release, it should still be in BETA if you ask me, and were it still in BETA, the fallout would've been way less (pun intended).
---
Lmao. You're by far the worse internet shit talker I've ever seen. I bet real life is tough on you. 
---
Yeah, that's kind of a thing, isn't it?  A really good point.  I haven't been threatened by Sentry Bots in a long time.  Every time I go into battle with one, I expect more than I get.  Part of that, I'm sure, is Enforcer just being a really strong perk that makes them go into self-destruct mode surprisingly fast.  But if anything, I'd expect the Sentry Bot to hit like Colonel Gutsy does, not the other way around.  You seldom encounter more than one Sentry Bot at a time anyway.  They should be tankier and be less reluctant to use that missile barrage.
---
I'm not even talking about people who know how to counter sentinels like you and I, I'm talking about the people that get targeted by guys wearing full assassins sentinels that arent even aware of the effect, the people that think the guy is hacking because its so overpowered.
---
Happens on the occasion for me. I just re-log and it generally fixes it.
---
Died 3 times trying to finish that. The lvl 65 Scorchbeast flying overhead didn't help anything either. 
---
xbox, and some berserker's stuff
---
I used to be just in the marine armor. Rocking urban scout now.  No difference for me on sneaking 
---
You dont need lvl 3 anything, those are only helpers you can still complete the quest without them just fine...I would be glad to help but I am on PC :)
---
Same, no frendz play 76
---
😔
---
Hard was the wrong word. Grindy*
---
Could try asking on the fallout 76 market they are pretty good for price checks (make sure you mark it for discussion or the bots will kick your post back)
---
Ever experience a hermit crab early on?? Holeeee shit. 
---
Definitely. They shouldn't try to rely on keeping hard-core, daily players interested in the long term. If they want to make money from the Atomic shop then their target demographic should be casual players who log in 1-3 times a week for an hour or two at a time. Those are the ones more likely to see something in the atomic shop, want it, and not have the Atoms to be able to buy it so they just drop a couple bucks for it.
---
If someone asks me what my religion is I am going to show them this post. Great Job. Thank you so much for this info. 
---
Did you have a workshop claimed? That flags you for pvp and turns off pacifist mode.
---
Wow and I was thinking game hates me and just gives me metal left legs thanks now I know I am unlucky
---
Mine is on the bridge of Pleasant Valley Station.
---
I’m currently able to craft all the headwear after learning the plans.
---
Yep been out there the last week or so and it just gets tiring, the scorched beasts come out of no where and are usually never just one. I kill one and another spawns within a few minutes...
---
start at 1000 go no higher than 2000
---
I can unfortunately only upvote your post once.. know that in my heart this is not so!
---
I just don't see how it's possible to not get hit at all in melee, unless you're getting the drop on them.
---
It's true that if you get right up in their face, their AI gets flustered and typically stops shooting.  Once I'm there, I can drop them in a couple hits no problem.  Getting there is the tricky part, especially when there's more than one.
---
If anyone is coming into the comments here isn't able to find people to play with, they should definitely check out the [fo76 discord](https://discord.gg/falloutreddit) 
---
I thought Whitesprings bots never dropped anything?
---
Dont think 2K will get you that, most of the 3 Stars I see are starting at 2K and usually end up going for more like 3K or so....
---
Hand it in for quest rewards
---
It has to something to do with the placement in relation to other objects and the animation. 
---
This normally happens once I move my base. It’ll clear up eventually. 
---
Something that isn't being discussed is how the SBQ is moving limbs in slow motion and doesn't move from that one spot and also does not attack.
---
read that in Seinfeld's voic
---
Happens on Xbox too. Although I feel like I've gotten at least a few units of ammo off them, but you know reasonable amounts like that of other enemies.
---
Well it worked. and I am now playing the games......is alright I guess
---
I sold a 2 star 2 shot 10mm sub for 2500c, it didn't even have explosive
---
If I'm not mistaken your only able to produce 6 purified waters (an hr) max regardless of how many purifiers you have. Did that change in a recent patch?
---
Yeah, at a point it turns into farming hardened mass, glowing mass and flux
---
Maybe that was the culprit, then. That didn't occur to me when I put that mod on.
---
Are you low life, low defense, full life, mutated?  
---
For me I follow this:   
---
Low Life: Bloodied with swing speed and either block reflects or more power attack  
---
Low Defense: Berserker with swing speed and more power attack  
---
Full Life: Anti-Armor or Instigating  
---
Mutated: Could go with a Mutant's but I would only do that if you have the armor that gives you 10% if your mutated (full 5 set can be pretty decent)  
---
Again this is my opinion, I'm on a Berserker binge cause I really like it
---
I've had a similar issue where I cycle through the same worlds a few times before actually getting a new one. Not the biggest bug in the world but it's super annoying.
---
Only thing that’s capped is charisma at 15 (you can get it higher like 20 or even 45 but its effectiveness is capped at 15. No other special stat has a cap or effectiveness cap? 
---
That would be nice too, but a least give us a way to plan around the quick weapon breaks if they don't intend to change that.
---
I haven't tried one, but I'd imagine that ultracite lasers would do something?
---
I did the same to be honest.
---
Wouldn't mind knowing more about the hundreds of legendaries strategy :)
---
As it stands Perk Cards with 5 points can only be min-max'd by continuing to pick the card but you can only have a R5 and a lower ranked card but can't build say an R4 and and R2 to switch out because of how points only allocate to rank up 1 card. Example: I can never have an Adrenaline R4 and R2 to switch  between only a R5.
---
Ran one last night in my almost complete set, made a tremendous difference 
---
There's a fissure site nearby - Sunnytop Station is not a good stop for daily vendor runs.
---
*Vault-Tec 😄
---
That's alright, when I'm a bit better off I'll start another adventure with the PS4 comrades, win-win!
---
Fortunately, he does make his presence known with his shouting. 😂
---
I personally think it's acquisition time or the speed of his shots.  Changing either would be fine.  I mean, in order to do a similar amount of damage, the Assaultron has his elaborate wind-up with the head laser.  The Sentry Bot has that siren.  If the Colonel Gutsy had to look at you for just a second or two before unleashing what he has, that would probably improve things.
---
Every enemy in this game has a rock-paper-scissors kind of mechanic for taking them down.  Colonel Gutsy is the one that will shoot before you say "Shoot!"
---
Small purifiers are listed as 8/hr, though that's debatable. But either way, more purifiers means more storage while you're out questing or whatever.
---
Also, the player who steals your nuke launch who has been hiding in the small room off to the right.
---
Darn I'm on PC :(
---
Wait why get rid of legendary weapons, I thought you said you’re saving them for re-rolls? I might be misunderstanding what you mean by”top tier weapons”. 
---
I run with pacifist all the time. I can't do any damage, but a hit by me still counts as a slap even when it does zero damage. I found that out while trying to mercy kill someone with a bounty and forgetting to turn off pacifist.
---
More than this i would like to see better loot and weapon scaling to make better use of the already existing weapons. For example, the first 1h weapon you find in the game is the machete which is better than the rolling pin, tire iron, hatchet and probably others that I'm missing. I would like to see the game force you to use the rolling pin. But then make the mods interesting with more effects so that it can stay relevant. Because for me it went machete &gt; ski sword with skate &gt; serrated machete &gt; sishkkabob. Didn't utilize any other weapon or mod. 2h is pretty much the same.  I carry i sharp pool cue for when my sledge breaks because it weighs less than a pound, but that's it. Sledge of some variety and then a sub par back up for poking low level scorched. All that begging said though i do agree more weapons and perhaps more so more armor should be priority content updates. And also some way to make crafting not completely irrelevant ounce toy start getting more legendaries.
---
Ahh okay thanks, that is what I saw and it confused me. I only saw the yellow portion and no white part of the bar after the repair :)
---
&gt; We've all been taken by surprise at how quickly his shots chew through armor 
---
those of us that have played other Fallout games were not the least bit surprised.
---
&gt; He appears to be sporting armor-penetrating rounds 
---
yes, and he is the only enemy to do so, variety is the spice of life...
---
&gt; Changing just one of these things would probably balance him 
---
he's balanced fairly well, I mean the Assautrons and Sentry Bots are almost always more of a hassle, this whole post reads like you haven't completed a silo yet...
---
2 minutes?  I can craft as soon as the animation of my character getting up to the bench is done.
---
hmm okay thanks, I dont remember that quest or I havent done it...
---
Because that would be stupid.  We just want a version of either the "Shared Bank" concept or the "Mailbox" concept.  Either one could be implemented into this game in a clever way that wouldn't be too jarring.  And these are normal accepted game systems for MMO type games that have been proven to work fine:
---
Games that have either of these:
---
* World of Warcraft
---
* Elder Scrolls Online
---
* Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn
---
* Guild Wars 2
---
* Star Wars: The Old Republic
---
* Rift
---
* EVE Online
---
* Neverwinter
---
* Runescape
---
* Lord of the Rings Online
---
* Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online
---
etc...
---
Yeah, I largely ignored it and focused on the bots. Had to hide behind the elevator a few times in order to allow my stims to work. Being in PA is pretty much a must if you don't have the perk cards for mitigation, which I don't really have at this time.
---
I'm not sure, it's possible that I did. 
---
u/ladydevann u/lonevaultwanderer
---
I dont have any wait at all when I craft....
---
In the roadmap they talk about a legendary mode for characters over 50. It will be like a prestige mode, your perks reset, and you get new abilities as well. It’s coming.
---
I’ve found at least 20 items with sentinel effect some as low as lvl 5 so tbh I doubt many people don’t know about this effect. But if you use vats and have any AA perks you only target one piece of armor and it’s pretty easy to kill someone in assasins sentinel imo. 
---
That’s just part of progressing in the game, it would be boring if everyone had the same gear cause you’d have no differentiation between builds.
---
Wish these locations were shown on the maps or at least unlocked as like a secret location that doesn't appear on your HUD until after you find it.
---
If its ps4 give me their game tag and if I ever see them I will personally level their camp and obliterate them. 
---
I don't like the ones I have so I am going to get rid of them and then farm legendaries so the game feels engaging again. I have two guns I use and one melee weapon. The rest are sitting there and it's a long time until the new vendor. 
---
Ahh damn.. well I guess I’ll have to settle for stealth boy, sneak, and secret agent. Thanks for the info 
---
\^ I used far too many stimpacks, and ended up hiding behind the elevator shaft to avoid the robots while getting hammered by the beast. 
---
YES! Trying to start a mod shop and I need to get my hands on these! Let me know when your available my GT: Pineapple Saul 
---
Give me a break. It is obviously a glitch that people are exploiting. Anything you can do in the game is taking advantage of how the game works, even duping items. We are obviously going to call duping an exploit. If the designers wanted us to be able to stack foundations they would have let us stack foundations, just like in FO4. The fact that they took that aspect out is indicative that we shouldn't do it.
---
That said. I don't think that they will ban people for it. One day in the future we wont be able to put campfires on anything but dirt and the problem will be solved. They will probably also scrap any bases that stack foundations / float.
---
Not exactly. if they lower the base weight to 3, the perk card at rank 3 will make them .3, thus carrying even more nukes
---
I agree because at a certain point, some weapons have no effect on type enemy at a certain point.. Whereas in past games you could still use a rolling pin and kick raider ass. Sure its not as powerful as other melee but its still usable and funny
---
yeah really, you all are actually complaining because someone else is not solving the hard parts for you? Really?
---
I've had this happen once or twice.  All the Mr. Handies that show up in the middle of Watoga become Colonel Gutsys and you end up with like 6 of them at once.  If they don't get you, the exploding cars probably will.
---
I disagree and I really don't get the nerf complaints. Extractors were giving a lot of resources for little effort.. and they still do. TSE was clearly overpowered and needed a nerf. As far as harder to get ammo, I have hundreds and thousands of the different ammo types so I have no idea what you're talking about. This game is still overly generous like every other vanilla Fallout. I also don't think leveling feels like a grind at all, and I'm not convinced they changed XP gains because I've never noticed any slow down.
---
There have been mistakes made, but I couldn't disagree more with this thread. This game is far from grindy unless you make it your life's mission to treat it as nothing more than an endgame power farm... in which case, congrats, you did it to yourself. :-p
---
Hey there. Reddit anti-spam filters are the main cause of your posts disappearing and not showing up on the trade feed. To make sure this happens less often we recommend that you do the following:
---
* Refrain from posting duplicate posts even if it's been a while since the last
---
* Do not delete your posts on the subreddit after the trade has been completed, be sure to use the --close command.
---
* Have more activity on our subreddit, such as posting in Discussion threads and trading with other players through their posts.
---
We hope this helps you out even a little bit and thank you for being apart of our community. :)
---
Post patch these are no where to be found at vendors, after a little research it looks like they can only be obtained through a mod plan spawn or an event reward. 
---
I must have played 200h by now. On PC. Not had a single negative experience with other players. F76 is a lot more friendly than real life!
---
I’m almost positive I have a weightless combat armor chest piece with another perk being harder to detect while sneaking, that’s the cloaking one right?
---
I built a base with 9 and bombarded SBQ for a bit. They take turns firing and you can watch them move to aim (kinda really cool). Each seems to fire 4-5 shells. After 9 I didn't notice any more shells firing but it could also be that I was distracted by SBQ. 
---
Are you using the regular launcher or the MIRV? 
---
I was luckily in a team with randoms when the invisible bees attacked and the other people kept laughing because they could see them and I couldn’t. They let me almost die before intervening. It was a good bonding session. 
---
Your video starts with "In the lifespan of nearly every competitive game"... 
---
This is NOT a competitive game. Survival Mode will make it more competitive, but even then, this is nothing like team sports. That video is far outside of appropriate context. xD
---
Incendiary turrets.
---
Yeah, they hurt a lot (and fast, if you don't have Fireproof), but I'm okay with those.  For one, they have a short wind-up time and a telltale sound effect.  And two, it's a simple line-of-sight, stationary enemy.  Grenades, a Tesla Rifle, or just sneaking around the other way are all valid strategies.
---
Yall have never met good power armor users I swear, or someone with a solid .50 cal build.
---
As already stated the transistor was never invented which led to a much different arc in terms of design of every day things. Weapons in particular in the fallout universe are in a weird spot.  A number of weapons that existed post- divergence (speculated to either be right after WWII or Korea) in the real world are in game. For example the P-90 in the original fallouts as well as Eugene Stoner's AR Platform. Of course Energy weapons can't be judged but by using conventional weapons we can tell some of the fallout timeline stick to ours. The Resource Wars resulted in the rapid development of Nuclear power for use in things such as cars, homes, and even eventually Power Armor. The Fallout Universe also has a lot more research into the biotech field because of plague deemed the "New Plague". FEV was one of the potential cures for the plague but West Tek in their infinite wisdom created Super Mutants. One of the US's biggest advances in tech that gave them a leg up on the Chinese was the development of a portable Fusion generator. I'll link the Fallout timeline, it's really fascinating stuff. I think one of the biggest overarching themes of Fallout has always been Power. Power in the literal sense. Without sustainable long term energy generation the Fallout Universe became what it is. The global powers fought over oil which led to rising tensions and then, the end. I'm personally an advocate of Nuclear Energy in small part because of the points made by the original writers of the Fallout Lore.    
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline)
---
absolutely agree.. a extra box for transfers would be great... Most games do that as is these days.. I mean, Borderlands did it with a nod and a wink..
---
Well, they made repairing of weapons and armor cheaper
---
I can second this, I took Poseidon &amp; grafton steel nearly every day for about a week and haven’t been attacked once. 
---
Can they target her?  I tried to get one to shoot a normal Scortchbeast, but they just hit the ground
---
Lmao just imagine recording him on an auto tuner 
---
Happened to me this morning on pc. 4 world re-tries and kept putting me in the same server over and over again.
---
That would be pretty hilarious. 😂
---
why were you taking a screenshot when there was a Scorchbeast flying overhead?
---
So I was lucky to get them before patch... Can do anyone mod if needed, but I'm on PC.
---
I agree with you except for the two shot mechanic. It needs to be renamed to the shot and a quarter. But XP was definitely merged, specifically on glowing ones. Nothing else was nerfed to my understanding XP wise. People were using Whitesprings nuke zone to power level. You could gain 5 or 6 levels in one zone. Now you get maybe 1. 
---
My main character is a bit like Antonio Banderas in Zorro.
---
Thanks for the offer.  He is PC.  I plan to follow him around a bit and make his life a little interesting. 
---
Cloaking is the one that after you get hit it makes you invisible even if you move, like a stealth boy. But I had forgotten about the harder to detect prefix, that’d be good to have as well. Gonna get every sneaking and invisible perk and armor I can, thanks! 
---
I made a blueprint that I use for workshops.  It's 1×2, three full walls, one side is a short fence with a short power connector.  Two medium generators inside, two turrets up top.  You're mining and defending in two winks of a coal miners' eye.  
---
10,000 of them.
---
I think, that's probably what I'll set out to do as well, given that silos are all robots.
---
It does dovetail into that one discussion a Redditor brought up yesterday about the desire to have a little more time between launch and impact, though.  I wouldn't want Troubleshooter's for the SBQ battle.
---
Respect! Having that blueprinted saves a ton of time, I'm sure.
---
If Bethesda nerfs the one enemy I’m still vaguely afraid of, I swear to Atom I’m quitting! 
---
I just throw them where she lands and it helps clear trash, honestly they are okay at that but she moves so much it can be difficult.
---
How do you transfer photos to imgur like that? 
---
I'm pretty sure he's always been unusually difficult.
---
However, it would be interesting if someone could confirm if his shots do indeed scale with player level.
---
These "users" you speak of probably have bad builds.
---
And therein lies the difference between viewing something as 'a nerf', and viewing it as 'balancing'. If a person doesn't understand or appreciate the context of the change, they will just see it as a negative nerf, but understanding the context and outcome will give an idea of why the change actually balanced things.
---
max out the ironclad perk if you haven’t already!! 
---
Cool well if you want to sell some I’d be down to come check out your inventory sometime. Agreed I have tons of bolstering and vanguard armor I want to re-roll and it’ll save so much stash space. I couldn’t play without my excavator PA before the last patch came out and added stash space, so I might have a hoarding problem lol
---
“Cryolator? I haven’t even met her!” 
---
That’s what would be my preferred way too, couldn’t have said It better 
---
They were like this in 4 as well. They'd tear your ass apart until you we're pretty high level. 
---
Definitely, its kind of like the BOS plans with a lot of people being screwed over by not having a chance to get them anymore. 
---
Yeah, I'm Lv. 123 and haven't done a silo run to completion.  These days, I go there only long enough to test the efficacy of different setups.  I'm melee and I can say that the Troubleshooter's Mole Miner Gauntlet makes killing them a breeze.  Only a couple hits and they are dead.  It's getting to them that's the problem.  That and, well, their infinite and often simultaneous numbers.
---
There is, but there haven't been scorch beasts at and bombarding the train station upon fast travel to it. At least not in time I've been playing (since Thanksgiving)
---
Yeah i saw that post
---
Agreed though I do wonder why quantum grenades suck so much in comparison.
---
Awesome. I didn’t even know about that sub. 
---
Yep, trade with other players not vendors. Hopefully the new vending system will make this easier as well.
---
The issue I tend to see in Watoga is Assaultron lasers not respecting physical obstructions.  I don't think the game processes that damage quickly enough, much like how your AP bar will sometimes get stuck while the server catches up.

Rare random spawn near the overseers camp.  There are I think 15 different spawn options, this one is a dead civil war reenact-er that will have 1 of the following, civil war era dress, confederate hat, confederate uniform, union hat, union uniform, or civil war error hat. 
---
It took me a total of seven hours over three days to farm them all. Now I just log out the the overseers camp so I can check the spot every day.
---
Any plans to fix the Nuka Girl torso skin textures? I look like a burn victim 
---
I’ll buy/trade 308 for 5.56
---
I haven't seen laser rifles. Therefore they would not be in a wasteland situation.
---
I haven't seen power armor. Therefore they would not be in a wasteland situation.
---
I haven't seen feral ghouls. Therefore they would not be in a wasteland situation.
---
They had something like this in Phantasy Star Universe. Loved it in that!!!
---
What platform do you play on? 
---
OH I didn't think of that.  I'll have to check those vendors.  
---
Can't sell it to vendors as of yet, I usually just drop what I don't use or give it to someone that does.
---
If you're on PC, there's a mod for that.
---
And sights
---
I just put any in my stash box that it will let me. Agreed we need a way to manage them better.
---
I'd rather face a Yao Guai than that OP dude!
---
Someone likened it to a Cracker Jack pop gun, which seems accurate.
---
When does fallout 5 come out?
---
It’s a randomly spawning event, you sometimes get a civil war re-inactor who has civil war clothing plans like the hat, a trick or treater with a witch or Halloween costume, a crashed satellite, crashed vertibird, unexploded bomb, suitcase with a note to find something, dead traveller and Brahmin, a tent and some scorched, all sorts, the one in the mire can spawn a deathclaw and a guy who blew his own head off as well, but basically any time you see a dead body on the road check them out. I’ve seen a civil war dead body a couple of times with the Union costume on the roadside walking from Ohio river adventures towards the nuke cola plant before you get to the greenhouse of the place you pass on the way to the plant (can’t remember the name).
---
Re read my question. Anyone that uses adrenal reaction would know that it hasnt worked right since last patch, only the negative effects were working. I was asking if anyone found a way to get the positive effects to work or if i gotta clean the slate, start over with the mutations and hope it works. Sorry for not being clear. 
---
Yes, please.  I've been asking for a [Borderlands 2 style Claptrap Stash](https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Claptrap%27s_Secret_Stash) since Day1.  As a 100% solo player, this is like my number 1 ask.
---
That was New Vegas, FO3 had no ammo crafting whatsoever.
---
Usually for me the first couple of robots drop loot and xp. After that it stops happening.
---
Me and my brothers camps don't even come close to overlapping but we want our bases near each other. They are engrained into the natural topography of the area and neither of us wants to move. Please fix this.
---
I don't go to Sunny Top often.  Maybe Fast traveled there 5 times total?  But twice out of those 4 times there have been two SBs circling.  Once I killed both cause I was on the Enclave Commendation quests.  A third time there was one circling in the distance, so I just left.
---
Seems more often than not that there are SBs there for me.
---
Ammo is not salable or scrappable at this time. Human players may want to buy the excess ammo but I prefer to just leave it in train station suitcases and overseers caches and doggie bags at popular locales. It's fun knowing your random act of kindness might make someone you'll never know a little bit happier that day.
---
Ultracite guns do have plans, just not common. I don’t want to talk about how much junk I used learning all the mods. At least there’s not many? But the mods are all kinds of wonky (“stocks” look like pistol grips, among other things)
---
You can just build on the very edge of your circle, amd have you buddy sidle his camp dight up to it and build on the edge of his, you'll get the lile two feet from each other that way
---
 This is how we always did it in No Man's Sky, works the same way
---
Hope it's okay if I bump this post. I still have not found any clarity on this issue; either on the Bethesda forums or this reddit. With more activity by Bethesda staff, I'm hopeful to get a comment back from them. ( [**u/Ladydevann**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ladydevann) **,** [**u/LoneVaultWanderer**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LoneVaultWanderer) )

\-Is VATS supposed to be impacted by the accuracy stat of the weapon AFTER the percentage shown in VATS is calculated?
---
\-Even critical shots that are initiated by using the critical bar can miss. Is this working as intended?
---
\-Is there an animation/positioning issue with VATS? I noticed if I line my middle-of-screen with the target more, then I'm more likely to get a hit in VATS.
---
\- Is VATS working as intended with the two-shot legendary modifier? As of now, two shot causes VATS to miss more by quite a substantial amount.  
---
it would be interesting then to sell for example ONLY instigating weapons for like a month, and then see if that prefix rises from it's current low rank for you personally.
---
I dont mind the effect, I mind how high it stacks and how often its used by dupers/griefers against people who don't know better.  people that need that set never want a fair fight, they pick new targets when they die once.
---
&gt;doubt many people don’t know about this effect
---
I've seen many posts in this subreddit from people complaining about "hackers" and posting a video of a guy clearly using assassins sentinels. the stuff is rare, not everyone has heard of it.
---
Player vending is coming on the 9th April so if you have the stash space it might be worth hanging onto until we see if we can sell unwanted ammo via our own vending machines
---
There's a lot that would go into TOWNS but I think letting teammates place camps near yours is very doable.
---
I have two Xbox’s in my living room and a small tv hooked to the secondary one.  They can share the game and Xbox live account.  But still run simultaneously. It’s sometimes  a pain in the ass but I’m thinking of doing it more. 
---
It shouldn't be doing that. I think I have had it once on some random work bench. Are you getting every time in your camp?
---
In the general, it appears as if you build is going in too many directions, a jack of all trades master of none situations. 
---
As pointed out, endurance is largely a dump stat with the exception of a few perks. Although, if you intended on doing a lot of pvp some of the endurance perks are more useful. 
---
As for luck, the general consensus is at least 5 if you plan on using mutations. Class freak rank 3 and starched genes 2. 
---
Although charisma is not a dump stat quite like endurance, not many points in charisma are needed. Generally you will want rank 3 of lone wandered which takes 4 slots and maybe a few other perks. 
---
As for ballistic weapons they are incredibly underpowered unless several perks are invested into them. Therefore you generally want to invest heavily into perception cutting back on strength for rifles. Alternatively, investing heavily into strength at the cost of perception is a more popular choice. More strength means more carry weight and more melee damage. Additionally there is more weapon variety in strength -melee, unarmed, shotguns, and heavy guns. 
---
Hope that helps 
---
It's not competitive per se against another living player. But it is competing against the game and its AI. The video isn't even using a team sport game.
---
I think the word for this is "Tedious."
---
The game isn't hard, but taking down Scorchbeasts for example is an incredibly tedious task. Made SLIGHTLY less tedious with the screech cooldown, but they still have a lot of health, and we don't do much damage. This would somewhat be fine if regular scorchbeasts dropped reasonably decent loot.
---
Colonel Gutsy seems well balanced to me, and wouldn't mind finding an occasional "Legendary General Gutsy" with slightly higher difficulty.
---
I would agree that large mobs of Colonel &amp; Major Gutsy bots is simply wrong, and they should be treated like Bosses, accompanied by mobs of Protectron's &amp; Mister (Private) Gutsy's.
---
Last time I actually died from them was when a large mob spawned in right in front of me, while my health was already low, from another player fast travelling into the area. They are also a bit rough on my armor (I seldom use PA).
---
A lot of enemies seem weak once you have really good weapons, and a better fix would be to tweak their perception, so you are not discovered by every enemy in the area all at once. as it stands now as soon as you engage one enemy and become discovered \[Danger\], then everything in the area makes a mad rush to attack you even when they're 2 rooms away with no line of sight.
---
If you’re on Xbox I just picked up a second one of that plan last night and I /think/ I haven’t given them away yet, I’d have to check
---
Since Fo3 we've needed a better system. I hope if ones needed for a quest later that it drops a waypoint on my stash
---
Ignore the tooltip and look at your weapon damage. Are you using old Adrenal or New? (Did you wipe it and remutate). New works fine if you don’t use Strange in Numbers. It bugs to fuck with SiN
---
You’re stupid
---
Mines, mines and more mines all over that rooftop. Hid behind a corner and rolled nades towards the terminal.
---
Wow that one hell of a DOC! That is a lot of work, thank you for sharing!
---
Weightless works with the chameleon mutation though, so if you’re not moving too much that’s an option. 
---
Moderators in this sub are actual heroes. Kudos to all of them. 
---
I don't disagree, my comment was more about defending shadowwolf, his point is sound. Within the context of 76 I agree with you, the weapons degrade way to fast. If you look at my history I have a post about "Tool Kits" so you can repair, scrap, and cook on the go. 
---
I wreck those buildings too. That shit makes me lag and lag makes me mad and when I'm mad I Fatman the shit out of your base.
---
My character is Don Swanson, son of John, grandson of Ron. Born in Pawnee, IN, moved to WV to be a forest ranger like his grandpa. Mustachioed mountain man of Appalachia. Buries gold in his back yard, or does he? Considering opening Very Good Building Supply Company when vending gets here.
---
Every game needs a hero
---
Isn’t there a hole in the ceiling and you can drop into the room from the room above?
---
Hmm oh yea ok thanks! But I wanna be invisible forever :p
---
So is trading with other people not a mechanic in the game encouraged by the developers? Maybe I misunderstood something but this is not the fallouts of old where it’s a single player isolated economy. I don’t like how people “brag” about not trading for anything. I understand if you don’t but c’mon, you’re no better than anyone else for not. 
---
I have never heard this happen check if it says in your completed quests that is been completed or wait for a new patch
---
Yea, would be very helpful.  One reason I haven't created another character
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who complains about Col. Gutsy lol :/
---
This is a horrible idea. Leveling up is easy enough.
---
Hey! If there is one Europe key left I would love to give it to a friend!! Right now he is a bit short on money but I’m trying to convince him haha
---
&gt; We need new weapons - not variations on current weapons
---
We need a fookin legendary Wick Pencil. 
---
&gt; I mean the Assautrons and Sentry Bots are almost always more of a hassle 
---
Are they, though?  I would happily take either of them over a Colonel Gutsy.
---
Perhaps not coincidentally, you also seldom encounter more than one or two Assaultrons or Sentry Bots at the same time.
---
I had that at the WS today. 3 times in a row. All the ghouls and the Wendigo rushed me. Not complaining though, spares me some time searching for the one dumbass ghoul that always sleeps in the corner downstairs and can't be arsed to get up unless you stand 2-3 feet away from it. 
---
Thanks, im in the process of wiping and getting the new, that seems to be what everyone is saying lol
---
Just get the chameleon perk, and wear weightless gear.
---
I think items you drop disappear once you leave the server, if I recall correctly
---
An hour? That thing would be lucky to survive 3-5 minutes against the Queen, sadly. 
---
Never did this, just wanna know what is the problem, trying to solve by my self stop begin paladins guys stop begin greedy live in peace. Yes really
---
I want a fatman solely for this purpose lol
---
Agree with above. If you are specifically wanting something for the silo then you will be killing a lot of robots so anti-armor or troubleshooter weapons would be useful.
---
u/Karthathan \- I've never looked into a  Berserker setup before. Presumably you run around with no armor but full health? How does the damage bonus work for this?
---
Dude the video references basketball several times in the first two minutes, how can you say it isn't using team sports lol. 
---
The rest of the video is about fighting games. This is not a fighting game. It's not even a PVP game, it's just a game that has softcore incidental PVP tacked on. Don't try to tell me about my critical thinking, you've used a completely inappropriate example that's focused on buffs and nerfs in the very specific context of competitive player versus player engagement. 
---
That is not Fallout 76. And as far as your commend about creating flavour and branching strategies, that's not even relevant to the nerfs this game has had. 
---
Do you even care about the importance of balancing in an open world game? xD
---
It's not there, Early Warnings is in my completed quest list and yesterday when I logged out I had installed 3 of the upgraded scorched detectors. Now the holo, the quest and the detectors are gone...
---
On the one hand the diversity would be swell but on the other hand my god the loot pool would be so insanely diluted that getting a specific weapon will become close to impossible.  
---
I'm all for this suggestion if and only if there's some sort of way to obtain a desired weapon with desired legendary effects.
---
Ehh I think you’re generalizing too much about people who own this armor, sorry your experience has been bad but there are lots of people who just want to pvp and will give you your caps and junk back afterwards. I’ve found lots of armor with sentinel or cavalier effect so I bet other players have aswell. 
---
And honestly if you come on the subreddit to complain about hacking then you’re either lazy or unintelligent. It would take less than 5 minutes to find posts mentioning these legendary effects. You can go on fallout wiki and see all known legendary effects. Ignorance does not equal innocence. 
---
Yeah you're right, FO: NV had the reloading benches not FO3
---
Depending on how they built it, all they have to do is pay a minimal fee to move their CAMP 2 inches and it's repaired for free
---
I was hiding from sb in a concrete bunker with no windows or gaps. Totally sealed. Scorchbeast releases the yellow goo that takes out all of my health in about 5 seconds. Fuck this game. I've said it before, everytime I play this game Bethesda finds a new way to disappoint and/or frustrate me 
---
From what I understand - so take this with a grain of salt - Zealot only applies to the humanoid Scorched.  The Queen counts as an animal, and is therefore affected by Hunter.
---
Were you in power armor?
---
It isn't that i disagree with their decision. That isn't the case at all. I agree with all of it. The game isn't meant to be easy and people weren't meant to be levelled 200 within a month. The balancing was necessary. But xp was brought down on a single creature. That is a fact. Not a gripe. Two shot went from 100% to 25%. Also a fact. I don't mind them. I adjust and adapt. My base is more of a defensive shell in the bog by a fissure site because i wanted more of a regular challenge.
---
&gt; Or more like this is a fun game and your expectations were too high. 
---
Sorry to tell you buddy, but when I'm being sold a game for 70$ (Swiss prices, yay) I expect to have something worth my 70$! This game has yet to be worth that but, thankfully, I only paid 10$ for it
---
See the pencil here? 
---
*BAM* smashing the head of the scorched towards the pencil. 
---
Now it’s gone!
---
Was army.
---
Yes, and zealot sentinel is even better. 
---
But since I can’t have cloaking at the same time, the only way to be cloaked while running is with stealth boy isn’t it?
---
I feel like they are becoming more popular. Perhaps people are levelling up new characters with them? What I find annoying is there are far more efficient ways to level up so they are pointless anyway.
---
Why didn't you just comment on the original post...?
---
I kept the holotape games, overseer personal logs, mistress of mystery tapes and the radio dramas but dumped all the others, same with all the notes apart from ones with passcodes and passwords on in case they’re needed again. When I had them all in my stash instead of my inventory I loaded into the game faster but would crash when I tried to put legendaries in my stash, but when I dumped all the unwanted ones I stopped crashing accessing the stash. This is going back a while but I haven’t missed them or needed them in any way, well so far lol
---
In Camp or Workshops. I haven't noticed the delay when it comes to random crafting tables found through out the map.
---
I am a data analyst (but I don't work for Bethesda), and depending on how the access to player data is set up, it would be somewhere between pretty easy and extremely trivial to weed out dupers.  I'm talking about a few minutes worth of work.
---
No bugs are going unfixed because of that.
---
Oh yes I know, the ultracite pistol plan is much easier to get now from the BOS vendor. The ultracite Gatling Laser is a whole different story though.
---
Zealots works for all the adds but not the queen herself. I have theorized though that if you had 5 pieces of zealots sentinel with poison resist that you would be damn near invincible if you fought her outside of a rad zone.
---
I haven't played in a long while, but something like this would help tempt me in. Would like a chance to try a low level character but using different weapons that I wouldn't be able to find normally as a low level.
---
You overcharged and they over paid. Smg is garbage.
---
I fully agree, and don't understand why this can't happen, or why there is a need for such a large buffer zone between CAMPs.
---
I have 2 Xboxes, and can barely place my characters CAMPs within sight of each other, not to mention getting the "Your CAMP could not be placed" message when there are no other CAMPs even remotely close to mine.
---
Adding more weapons dilutes the chances of getting the weapon you want on a given drop.
---
Or they build entirely out of glitched foundations- good luck destroying those. 
---
However those bases usually don’t have any turrets (since they don’t need them). I think those camps are more for dumping materials &amp; crafting during a nuke run
---
Okay, cool. Thank you! 
---
It's 50% more damage if no def. I run a lvl 1 hazmat (never breaks) and that's it, using auto stim perk, serendipity, Lone Wanderer, and blocker helps mitigate damage when I do get hit, besides that I focus stealth and use stealth boys when going through SB areas. It really gives a sense of urgency while playing because any enemy is dangerous and you have to play very carefully. I used to be PA Heavy Build and got bored after 170+ levels, this makes every area a challenge but I can still dish punishment.
---
Yeah, I've noticed that a few times too. Probably a few things that need to be checked on by Bethesda in regards to the Assaultrons. I don't think I actually ran into that issue with any assaultrons other than the ones in Watoga though, now that I think about it.
---
There's currently no way of knowing whether it's coming on or going...
---
&gt; Because that would be stupid
---
Other than the fact that `player.modav carryweight 10000` made my playthroughs of Skyrim and the other Fallouts 1000 times more enjoyable.
---
They're right. Have you played the game and/or experienced real life?
---
to be fair this game has a younger audience too, I've seen people posting videos of themselves dropping a mini nuke on someones head and being dumbfounded why they didnt get a kill. I dont think its fair to expect people to check the wiki to be prepared for greifers.
---
Maxed.  With a mix of bolstering and unyielding armor, and some choice mutations, they aren't quite the threat they were when I was fighting them in quest lines.  
---
That sounds like it is happening whenever you use a workbench you own. Might be worth raising a ticket with Bethesda if that's the case.
---
I just want unnarmed weapons for power armors...
---
No, chameleon cloaks you while crouched and not moving. There's mods to improve sneak or decrease movement sound.  Shadowed and Muffled. 
---
Man, this burn hit me good, crippled two of my limbs. I would use a stimpak but...
---
I haven't seen stimpaks. Therefore they would not be in a wasteland situation.
---
The explosive guns need love in general, legendary explosive weapons of all sorts do more dmg and they shouldn't.
---
I’ve noticed. I haven’t really found an practical purpose for them yet, but maybe one day
---
I've definitely learned to fear Col Gutsy.  He's way tougher than a sentry bot or assaultron.
---
Thanks for getting the data!
---
There is one with pile of protectrons.But it will drop you before lvl3 terminal
---
Great story, good to hear another player than didn’t fall prey to a scammer. I got scammed awhile ago but that was entirely my fault, trusted him even though he was sketchy asf. Wasn’t blatantly obvious as he had good karma, still dumb though.
---
Pipe shotgun anyone?
---
You appear to be missing the Fusion Core in Watoga High that spawns suitless in the Science lab, to the left of the door as you walk in.
---
This sounds interesting, I might give it a go to freshen up the gameplay. Is there somewhere in particular you can get a hazmat suit at that level? Which weapons do you use in particular? Sorry, those are my last questions :-)
---
MY FIRST CAMP WAS THERE. 
---
Until I logged in one day and someone else was camped there. 
---
That free chem station and all the wild mutfruit is a lifesaver. Being able to run down the hill and take lakeside cabins whenever you want to farm lead and collect sone plastic or go up the hill to the army base and get springs. That is a great early game location. 
---
Second this. 
---
Or fixing the “grab your dropped loot” shit cuz it’s not marked if you die a second time and it’s really annoying 
---
Not if you put them in an existing container. 
---
Love seeing a dead scortchbeast.
---
On the rare occasions I run low, I, too, farm a power station workshop - for 5-6 cores, or about an hour total including time to capture the station and kill the first set of attackers. I try to time it at a time of day when fewer people are online. I also try to find a server without a lot of higher levels on it.
---
Stupid kids nowadays...
---
Fallout 76 can be analyzed in the same way with "builds" representing characters. If they keep nerfing explosives builds, they aren't buffing energy weapon or heavy weapon users. That's how I see it and how the game can be improved.
---
Instead of nerfing explosives, could they have included a perk card to reduced explosive damage? They kind of did but only tied it with Fireproof and it maxes out 45% damage reduction instead of a new card in itself. And with that they can further expand the game with buffing energy weapons.
---
I would ask you to re-watch it and try to find parallels to see if Fallout can be better by buffs rather than nerfs.
---
Hmm file a bug report on Bethesda.net and see If it gets fixed in a upcoming patch
---
Oh I didn't mean my comment to be about you specifically, sorry if it came across that way. If anything I thought you were agreeing with me. 
---
And yea, I'd say nerfing the Whitesprings farm was needed. That seemed a bit much. Two Shot and Explosive blew my mind the first time I saw that 100% increase... the nerf didn't shock me. What shocked me was that such a huge damage bonus ever made it past peer vetting in the dev room in the first place. :-p
---
That’s what I was wondering since you can hit fissure prime and not take rads
---
They've only done Alpha so far this week.
---

I don't have any especial problem with him, and I'm not in power armor most of the time. Armor piercing magazine + armor piercing perks + shooting at his thruster/the arm facing you and he goes down pretty quickly. He hits somewhat hard, but not absurdly so. 
---
As long as there aren't any turrets I couldn't care less.
---
So, a hunter weapon like a 50 or Minigun will inflict bonus damage?
---
&gt; Nearest workbench marked on the map
---
omfg yes!
---
Ahh yes I forgot that cloaking turns you invisible my b, maybe down the line when we have 5* legendaries, you’ll be able to have a weightless cloaking armor piece 
---
Exactly. I recommend forward station delta instead of the drop site though. Less trenches to fall into.
---
Yeah I can't say for certain. There's no real way to prove things, because Bethesda doesn't have a good system in place to actually detect dupes apparently, which is an egregious mistake IMO. Just a few dupers can flood the economy with items and ruin it. I could easily see making 10,000 ultracite ammo though, and maybe you pass it to your alt, then realize you'll never go through it all, so you pass it back to your main, then you move on to a new alt and move it back, etc. I could also see going through 20,000 5mm ultracite ammo in a week. I can go through 6-8K in a day. Part of me thinks that Bethesda has no idea how hardcore some players are, and the level of efficiency some players reach in their farming / crafting. Part of me thinks those banned people are just mad because they lost their free money (selling duped weapons on ebay for literally $20-30 per item). 
---
The truth is, we'll never know unless this like... goes to trial or something, which won't happen. 
---
I offer this as a service on PC. Wouldn't mind your humor, just your platform! :D
---
That is why i was confused since I was agreeing with you. Lol. I was like maybe my wording was unclear. The devs are doing a great job. Even when i disagree. The changes are needed to make this a long term game. And i truly want it to be. Now people nuke things other than Whitesprings. It really is great. It is taking time but they will get it all right.
---
For a really basic level 0 shotgun, a single shot pipe shotgun would be super cool. The kind where you put the shell into one end of the pipe than slam the other pipe barrel into it.
---
Let me know if you still have one, I got a friend I can get into the game. PS Store has it listed at 70 euros and he's not wanting to play that much for it. 
---
Yup.
---
Hes a non issue for me. I pop one diluted stim for every gutsy I have to smack with a hammer 
---
I don't think it's mentioned. And as long as you paid for both accounts, and you are physically playing them yourself - not using automation software to play multiple characters at once, I can't see them getting mad over it. It's another game sale for them after all.
---
Both so true
---
More types of legendary perks!
---
I switch to heavy weapons for the queen. But yeah I get around an hour from my 200% rifle. It's a shame since it's such a beast
---
I bought a Gatling Ultracite plan off the market a few days ago for... I want to say 1k caps? Cheap given I’d never seen the plans, been playing since BETA. 
---
The pistol plans are sold at vendors now? I found one a while ago, just found another (world loot both) recently. 
---
Something that makes it easier to find corpses to loot.
---
I can hop on for a few now and hook you up for 500 each, I believe I have all the mats. If that price is good by you, let me know.
---
I'm on xbox so have to do it the hard way 
---
A lever-action shotgun does not use en-bloc clips so if it was intentional, it seems like you're meaning to say, it was a mistake by the developer and they are too lazy to correct it. I've never personally fired a lever-action shotgun, but my understanding is you do not have to clear all the rounds before loading another, but I could be wrong. If I am wrong, then the animation should probably show that.
---
To me it seems like it is just a mistake + laziness, not intentional.
---
Add more weapons please, even if there stats are similar to established weapons!
---
This is the main problem imo.  I find myself logging in less and less to the point where its been a couple weeks now and I'm just awaiting the next patch to introduce new content.  
---
But I feel like it was a decent enough ride and I got my moneys worth.
---
I plan to farm some flux this week to make orbital strike beacons.
---
Yah I see way more nukes falling on Cranberry Bog these days. Still haven't touched any of that myself, for the most part... I tried to farm a bit in a blast zone the other day, withint 10 minutes I had died several times and was radded nearly to death. Noped right the hell out haha. 
---
I probably need to actually spend time farming to upgrade my power armour. But I'm usually too busy building!
---
Apparently it’s also nerfed somewhat, I don’t track the numbers that closely, it doesn’t work above 60% health now? I run between 10-20% so I don’t notice. 
---
Two ways to get a level one suit. Finish Free states and get the lvl 1 Prototype Suit OR be that low and run screaming to the nuclear disposal site and be the person that causes the area to spawn low (has a chance to then give lvl 1 rad suits) If their is any other way I do not know it but would love to learn it! As for weapon as I level I was blessed with a lvl 10 anti armor rifle by a guildmate. I focus two hander so Fire-Axe with spikes is great (even more if you can get a berserker one). I also use suppressed armor pen handmad to engage at range as I wait for my beserker endgame equipment (lvl 28 on the build atm). For my endgame I have a berserker Mr Gutsy (over repaired) and a berserker axe, my weapon I have is a berserker lever gun (hoping to get some variation and try other berserker weapons, but people sell them to vendors it seems lol).
---
Pre patch, I had got to a place where nothing broke. Post patch, I'm probably breaking at least a TSE .50 and a prime E gatling laser.
---
What about those melee karate moves you can learn in NV if your unarmed is high enough?
---
Expand your horizons and be versatile. He isn’t asking for more types of rolling pins and wood armor. Hopefully, if new weapons were added they would all be viable in their own way.
---
t(&gt;\_&lt; t )
---
I had my own bad experiences where i fell for the dumbest in the book. There are loads of awesome players on here, but then you will always come across those rotten seeds lol.
---
Until they nerf sentinels effect I'm not touching PVP
---
Doggy bag trading lol. Never a good idea.
---
Sorry I’m just not willing to coddle people who complain about something they could’ve found in less than 5 minutes with a little research. If you don’t want to PvP turn pacifist mode on and don’t claim workshops. If you don’t do those 2 things then you have to live with the consequences and should expect some people to have better gear than you. That’s the progression of MMORPGs and it’s what keeps it interesting, having god tier gear to strive for. 
---
This game encourages interaction with the community and if a player chooses to isolate themselves and not meet people who could tell them these things, then that’s on them imo. 
---
Loved it when my guild was still active and they pumped her full of endangerol and cryloted her to the ground until her wings were crippled, then the artillery seemdd to be more useful in trash managment (she went down in 5 mins during those good old days, we used to have 13 -20 people on the server be us)
---
If a [pistol](https://www.glockstore.com/Glock-9MM-50RD-Drum-Magazine) has a drum mag, can't an SMG?
---
I don't get that, turrets don't really help level.
---
Damn straight. Fucking casuals.
---
They hit weirdly hard but more things should because they don’t have anything that really keeps up with the absurd armor values of power armor. 
---
Also I have yet to see a robobrain that works properly and assualtrons are the work of Satan. Robobrains have either a flamer or a lightning gun mounted on one of their arms and yet only ever use the mildly inconvenient smoke nonsense. Assualtrons are mostly fine until they unleash the head mounted wrath of god Ray that’s supposed have a charge up and set duration, but does not presumably because netcode screws up their AI. I liked assualtrons in 4 because they were intimidating, now they are unfair and terrifying. 
---
Wow great idea, going to replicate tonight. got a photo?
---
You misread my post.
---
The post above me accused me of buying my gear. I simply pointed out that I haven't bought or traded for anything.
---
Love this story!
---
Sounds like good times
---
Just another needless casualty of Bethesda's overzealous nerfing of Explosive legendries.
---
Explosive weapons in general need some substantial buffs to their damage to make them a viable choice.
---
I generally don't try to analyze changes related to buffs/nerfs or anything like them, for one simple reason: I'm not a dev. I don't know their goals, I don't know their limitations, I don't know their game plan, I don't work for Bethesda. Nobody but a dev or someone with insight into their workings can present a worthwhile opinion on whether buffs/nerfs should be made. 
---
I'm all for people offering suggestions to improve a game, or offering critical feedback. But I'm not going to try to convince a bunch of paid games developers that I have a superior philosophy to whatever they use to make their decisions. :-p 
---
Yeah, I'd agree.  It's possibly their numbers more than anything else.  As the "apex enemy" of a group, he is fine.  But you get more than a couple at the same time and it's difficult for me to suss out a strategy for taking them out without popping a Stimpack or two.
---
I like some of those but the AP perks I think would be way too OP 
---
They tag the ghouls with a few shots and then let the turrets finish them off. Then they can get the XP and loot from the initial tag. The annoying part is when they wonder off leaving the camp there. The turrets will kill the ghouls and no one gets anything!
---
Call it all off. This guy just won the fucking internet. 
---
9mms
---
Agreed. I was able to take out a legendary 35 super mutant at 14. Game isn't too diffocult. 
---
Also u/RealityAskew is an expert on this build (he was my inspiration and is very willing to talk about how to really make it shine)
---
Additionally, I feel like the longer we are out there in the wasteland, the more improvised weapons should start to occur. 
---
Grenades made out of cans, and gunpowder, with the option to add screws or glass to add bleed damage. Knowable javelins made out of ski poles. Let us get real creative and raider-esque. Additionally, when we get backpacks can we please get a golf bag that displays melee weapons? For reasons...
---
XB1
---
Doesn't mean you or other people can't benefit from it but ok, horrible. 
---
It would be cool if we could all get a respec or the perk system from FO4 but that's wishful thinking.
---
Yup.  Logged in probably 1-2 times this month.   
---
Queen is boring and not worth it IMO.  
---
Whitesprings gets old quick. 
---
My end game has been basically train station hopping.  So yea.  Maybe ill be back after the content drop.   But i doubt it.   
---
&gt;In the general, it appears as if you build is going in too many directions, a jack of all trades master of none situations.
---
Exactly what I thought when first looking at the build. If you are going down the rifle route you definitely want more in perception so you can get all of the rileman perks along with tank killer. TBH I feel like you can still use melee as a backup with only a few points in strength if have a decent weapon like a grog, super sledge or fire axe.
---
How much for AA lever rifle? 
---
... where did shotguns come into this? This was about the lever action rifles. I don't remember 76 even having lever action shotguns.
---
What I was trying to say then is indeed that it was a mistake by Bethesda. Intentional in this case just meant it was made that way and it was *not* a bug that it'd reload all 5 rounds even if only 1 was shot.
---
I'd be a mod simply because of this:
---
&gt;Someone who is impartial. We do not remove opinion when it adds to discussion. People are allowed to like or dislike parts of the game, and this is a controversial situation.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Building on the last line, someone with good judgement, sorting through a "I don't like this new addition because of X and Y" and a good explanation compared to "I hate this game" and nothing else.
---
There's nothing more disheartening then witnessing "i quit threads" or "this game sucks". 
---
That's what I asked and it appears right away, I don't use any auto weapon perks and that gun was a beats and melted anything, it had plus vats critical and another perk, it was really good and the buyer was happy.
---
 Plow polo d canq. FCC  f   yc fees!÷aqa
---
I was getting 8-15 per run, run takes 10-12 minutes at most (13-15 with load time), I was farming for about 10 hours.
---
So at about 5 runs per hour, let's say I averaged around 10 legendaries per run, that's 50 legendaries per hour. Multiply that by 10. I think I got a bit less than that, but I will tell you that I ended up with tons and tons of 1 star legendaries stashed in every random container without a weight limit all around Whitesprings.
---
Towards the end I had some weirdness with the clubhouse ghouls giving more legendary drops than normal too, and I brought my alt up to double up on the runs. For that:
---
1. Main runs in, aggros mobs, run behind bar at special spot (ghouls won't attack).
---
2. Alt runs in and tags, stands beside main.
---
3. Main kills. Loot on main and get reload started.
---
4. While main is reloading into the server, loot tagged kills on alt. 
---
5. Make sure alt is outside by bus before main loads in.
---
6. Main loads in. Wait until door opens (to verify loading is complete).
---
7. Repeat.
---
All the fatmen I've found do 460 damage and only fire one at a time
---
Yeah, which I'm pumped for but I mean for an alt so you can have more than 1 character for different perks/ play styles. 
---
If they are needed again like on a quest for some reason, one should Spawn into the game while on the quest. So I shouldn't even have been worrying about loss. I just went thru the enclave and brotherhood stories and finding the "system" holotape was a pain in the ass. 
---
If you drop something in a brown bag, the meat piles will start loading. I'm not sure why, but it definitely seems to work 
---
I’ve tried giving arms and legs for the plan but no one has it, or at least wants to part with it. The pistol plans were rare at the BOS Watoga vendor but now they’re very consistent there.
---
Name it.  Trademark it.
---
***Andrewbadera's Escort Service*** *- "Helping you finish fast is our highest priority!"* 
---
No.  *Wait...*
---
You would need to add some fine print.  *"Customer equipment pre-approval required to receive member services."*
---
Just goes to show Bethesda needs to rework the trading so you can see all legendary effects and also have an actual “trading” system not just a “buying/selling” system. 
---
I found an anti armor fat man.
---
It’s my baby.
---
They hit very hard, but only in comparison to the lasers are so underpowered its kind of a joke.  
---
You can stand there vs a dozen laser Gutsy's or Protectrons and it will take minutes to die...  
---
Lore wise, as I understand it, the Gutsy's were mean little power houses
---
You're talking like I have a micropenis someone doesn't know about before I married them.
---
Not gonna lie... This is a great idea, I mean what better motivation can you have.
---
I'm looking for 4k
---
What specifically makes them OP? And great idea about the pistols. I've edited the post to add those in. 
---
Nuka Grenades, and aim for the Thrusters
---
This 100% was my thought when I was inspecting the item. 
---
I’m gonna be honest I haven’t played this game since early December because I did everything I could by then and just felt repetitive. So new content like weapons and quest lines will definitely get me on again.
---
I completely agree on your argument and finds your rebuttals funny but stimpaks exist.

And hookers and blackjack.
---
Certain enemies should only spawn from a specific pool, so you could farm for what you want based on what kinds of enemies you are facing. They would just need to diversify the enemy pool so there were areas you could hit to go after waves of level 50+ enemies in different areas. 
---
Each groups legendary pool could include a pistol type, rifle, heavy weapon, melee weapon and an armor type. Since there is already a higher chance for armor spawns according to that post earlier this could balance the drops out.
---
The first week or so i was thinking, "damn this game is not nearly as bad as people say." I was able to buy items from the Atom Shop without ever having to spend $$$ on Atoms. But after that  few weeks of dealing with bugs, exploits, and terrible patches - you realize damn this game is not that good. I went back to playing Tale of Two Wastelands and Skyrim just to wash the taste of 76 out of my mouth.
---
Also forgot to mention there is a bug right now that procs adrenal off your hunger but only if your hunger dips from 50% and you can keep your health up but if you reload the game it's gone. Many people are calling it hangry builds
---
Then is this whole reddit it a Sodom and Gomorrah to you? almost every thread is about is changes and opinions to a game released as a service.
---
I can agree a game developer has the right to deliver their own artistic vision (not just a visual vision). But when a game is released as a service and *they're asking for feedback*, we should step up. Otherwise other people step up and ask for unnecessary changes to make a game easier.
---
&gt; Other than the fact that player.modav carryweight 10000 made my playthroughs of Skyrim and the other Fallouts 1000 times more enjoyable
---
I'm pretty sure the guy I was responding to was being sarcastic my dude.
---
What do you guys think?  Should I apply?  I'm pretty cool.
---
Obviously Bethesda can't make a twitch and how else do you organize 25p.
---
I have disappearing corpses and freezes when first loading into a world. Otherwise, I would say issues like server drops, game freezes, ... have reduced to almost zero for me.
---
Yup last night some lever 40 had his camp there. The only purpose of the camp was the elevated turrets shooting all the ghouls so I blew up his turrets repeatedly. He repaired them and attacked me, i killed him and his turrets. We repeated this process until he left the server and I regret nothing. Only got a 150 cap bounty and just let a random take it off me
---
The deliverer is in the game files.  Still waiting for that model to surface.
---
&gt; you also seldom encounter more than one or two Assaultrons or Sentry Bots at the same time. 
---
now I know for a fact you haven't done the silo
---
I see. I understand why you might want that. But you aren’t supposed to be able to do everything in a rpg. Nothing is currently stopping you from making a new character. but if you start making new characters earn faster exp than original ones, you can imagine how that would cause imbalance. A first time player would be level 10 in Flatwoods, a second time player may be level 20. So what level monsters does the game spawn?
---
There are just some perks like dodgy that use AP to avoid damage so I feel like for a rifle build with sentinel armor all they’d have to do is stand still and would never run out of AP when combined with luck perks that regen your AP from kills, which would negate almost all damage done. 
---
And imo jumping should drain AP if sprinting does because it just makes sense, though maybe it should take less AP.
---
Honestly these are just opinions I’m sure there are reasons why these changes should be made tho
---
I told you how it works post patch and you replied with you know how it works... You still aren't being clear.  Yes you need to lose it and reapply it but it will still be buggy, unless you have easy access to serums I would wait and see if they attempt to fix it.
---
lol
---
Orbital strike beacons are fantastic too. 
---
I use cannibal to save space on food, I find it spices up the gameplay too :'D but I was asking about junk for other effects too :)
---
I'd really enjoy reworking the perk system kinda like FO4. that one at least didn't make you switch out and gave me a reason to keep gaining XP.
---
I'm sort of ambivalent on opinions like this.  I know it's a recurring point in ManyATrueNerd's recent analysis, that the game in general needs to be more hardcore and difficult because it's too easy.
---
And it *is* easy.  If you know how, at least.  That's a big asterisk I'd put on that.  Someone who doesn't understand what perks are important, who doesn't understand the perk card system, or the scrap-for-mods system, is going to be easily frustrated.
---
But at the same time, baseline 76 *is* something of a casual game.  I believe that was an intentional goal of its design and I don't mind it.  When Survival and perhaps Nuclear Winter come around, it will offer more for those who want a hardcore experience.  But I don't think it's a stretch to say that I, and many others, turn to 76 as a game for vegging out.  There's always a little "something" to do and the majority of the game is you setting and following your own goals.  It shares traits with games like Cities: Skylines, only it happens to be an FPS instead.
---
I love the idea, but my friends and I mostly build in different regions, that way we always have free fast travel.  I'm in the Mire, my gf is in the Forrest, then we have four friends near White Springs who are rarely on at the same time, and no they aren't just putting up turrets near the golf club nine of then are near it, then there is a friend near Watoga and a friend near the Lucky Hole Mine and Fort Defiance.
---
They should buff assaultrons.
---
Had this issue last night on sbq Xbox. Loot loading took forever and only cleaned up when the event finished
---
There's literally dozens of us!!!!
---
Doing the awol robots event hurts there’s like5 or 6 that spawn at the same time but it’s doable 
---
Thanks for this, I'll be keeping hold of the next  berserker weapons I come across. Unfortunately I am one of the people selling them to vendors :-)
---
Same. I do wish it would automatically take you out of pacifist if you get a bounty. In OPs situation there’s not enough time to turn it off manually and stand a chance defending yourself. 
---
this is one of the best things that i read on here..i would have done the same thing that you did..you knew that you werent even close to actually trading with the guy..but you wanted to see how it would play out..but bruh..u messed up... a screw??? u should have dropped a glass shard or something lolol..i didnt even know negative karma could be given
---
Why not do it because you enjoy it and it's fun?
---
I did this two days ago. I lost all of my nuka grenades, most of my cryogenic grenades, and all of plasma grenades having to take a 12-20 of those bastards out. 
---
Should have taken your chance while he was at the vendor and launched a mirv indoors at him
---

---
I shall quote myself from my last reply: "I'm all for people offering suggestions to improve a game, or offering critical feedback. But I'm not going to try to convince a bunch of paid games developers that I have a superior philosophy to whatever they use to make their decisions."
---
Telling devs to 'buff not nerf' is silly IMO, and that's why it's coming from an armchair dev. 
---
It shouldn't be a question of doing one over the other as a gameplan or overall outlook. It's a question of individual examples and whether a buff or nerf is appropriate. And in many cases nerfing a single thing is way more intelligent than buffing every other thing, because making many chances instead of one or a few changes is more likely to cause unforeseen problems. 
---
And I find it weird that you're mentioning people asking for changes to make a game easier, when that's exactly what I think people are doing when they contest Bethesda's buff decisions so far... it's all about complaining that these changes make the game harder or grindier, and I simply don't agree. 
---
Its an AoE power house though. It's not suppose to one shot top-tier enemies.. (my bloodied fatman still does while in sneak though). 
---
If you dont use the following your using the fatman wrong: 
---
* Stabilized 
---
* Ordnance Express
---
* Bear Arms
---
* Demolition Expert lvl 1 or maxed
---
* One Man Army
---
It's been brought up 1000X. Please take these concerns to Bethesda's official forum reddit should be for fun.
---
My role play challenge to you is simply: choose perks and you're not allowed to swap them. If you require lock pick you need to find a team mate.
---
Forces you to be social.
---
&gt; But you aren’t supposed to be able to do everything in a rpg
---
Which is the point of multiple characters. I always create multiple characters in RPGs when talent builds are involved. 
---
&gt;So what level monsters does the game spawn?
---
The mobs don't spawn at a specific level in this game. 
---
No one cares about refresh stations. turret farmers are where the hate is.
---
You must have read the plan for the Confederate Hat after patch 6 then. That is working. For those of us that read it before patch 6, we are currently out of luck.
---
The 'trick' is they spray in to the melee, or spam grenades. all they have to do is damage one to get full exp for the kills.
---
and in this one it's definitely not the devs
---
Oh cool I picked an instigating 3* fat man off the Queen last week (despite the bug not registering it in my inventory for like 10min) so it looks like I hit the lotterayyyyyy
---
And let it actually damage something at a lower height instaed of exploding uselessly above and doing no damage, much like the MIRV does all the time.  Thank you.
---
*Noooooo,* I didn't mean it like that!  
---
How dare these people play the game in a way i don't like!
---
I agree that there should be easier ways to get the weapon you want, especially for us PaVE players. Im hoping the Legendary Vendor will be that solution. But more loot pool will also benefit people who love to trade. It will make player vendors more important at same time.
---
The variety will help keep interest in the game. If they don't add any new weapons you will be using the same ones over and over, that eventually will get boring for a game that's suppose to have multiple years worth of new updates.
---
If you hide in the lift the scorchbeast stops the robots, just a boring 3 minutes of listening to carnage.
---
Kids should not be playing this game, and the type of parents that let them obviously wouldn't care.
---
That said, I have encountered quite a few kids (Under 15) playing and their immaturity is all too often reflected in their game behavior.
---
Well I look forward to what they mean by private servers. I wonder if they’ll do a community club thing like they did with Skyrim. 
---
PC crowd is the worst - i watch a live streamer with a BoS clan and his thing is attack workshop, let the guy come back as many times as possible so his team can take caps, then abandon it.
---
Once you all have the sentinels assassin duped armor set what else is there to possibly do but grief?
---
That's something I've never thought about. I might be wrong, but I think somewhere in FO3 there's a terminal that says FEV was originally created as a vaccination for every disease before the scientists realized it basically could create super soldiers. It's been years since I played though. 
---
Don’t they though? The game matches monster levels with the first player to enter an area on the map. I think they called them cells. And they respawn once that cell is empty, or sometimes when a new player enters. 
---
Interesting story! One thing that's notable here, and I also know it works in real life: do not trust anyone talking about trust. Trustworthy people don't need to mention trust usually. 
---
Wow. I’ve never heard this suggestion… fuck. 
---
I was scammed also in a similar situation. You did the right thing. Well played.
---
Are you the admin of this sub? 
---
haha couldn't help the meta.
---
You can do that without turrets
---
I think lorewise the FEV made super mutants immune to most(if not all) diseases. that is part of the reason the master saw super mutants as the next evolutionary step and tried to turn humanity into super mutants in fallout 1.
---
Super mutant cells undergo cellular division at a greatly increased rate. Mitosis occurs at a rate 15% quicker than that found in pure strain humans. A super mutant's cellular structure is said to be highly similar to normal humans. Super mutant DNA strands are nearly flawless, with all of the recessive genes that produce many of the most common ailments like diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease eradicated from the genome. Those recessive genes which are commonly found in humans have been manipulated in such a way by the infection of the FEV as to bring about the best possible combination of genetic traits. A super mutant's RNA structure was also altered by the virus to produce more rapid transcription, resulting in the enhanced regenerative capacities of the mutated form.
---
This is from the wiki and is compiled of lore from all Fallout games. Even if they aren’t immune per se they regenerate faster than the plague can take hold. They may be carriers but wouldn’t be effected because of their unique DNA structure.
---
Yeah this guy wasn’t a trader, just posted a screenshot of his plans list in the Pip-Boy and said “wts”. I don’t think he knew what he had ;)
---
&gt;We've all been taken by surprise at how quickly his shots chew through armor and how he seems to be the most dangerous thing in the entire game, rivaling even Scorchbeasts.
---
I find assaultrons to be just as dangerous. Deathclaws as well at higher or if you don't see them coming. There is also this one sentry bot at a train yard that is probably the most dangerous thing I've fought in the game so far. I avoid that station aside from helping out poor bastards who don't know about it. Whats worse said yard does have 3 gutys that can be colonels as well.
---
Yes! This is a excellent solution too. Reminds me of Runescape and other MMOs where you would farm certain enemies/locatione for the weapons/armor you want
---
Don’t take the workshop if you don’t want to defend it. Jesus fuck. 
---
It would make it more like other fallout games if your AP didn’t decrease when entering or in vats, so I get why players would want that.
---
I feel like the legendary drops have gotten worse lately. It seems like I’m getting more 1* wood armor pieces than before. Ive also seen an uptick in legendary 1* items at vendors, specifically watoga train station. I don’t know if that’s from other players selling off there items but yesterday there were three different bloodied weapons available 
---
I found plans for it,  why would it be banned? I make and sell them for caps at vendors
---
Stop farming the golf club - there's better ways to play the game.  It strikes me that those triggered are almost as lame as these turret base owners.
---
In case you did not know, you can track it manually by seeing what you can and can't craft using the manual list I created here. It's a pain, and in in-game feature would be much nicer, I agree.
---

---
You don't get extra xp just for creating an alt. I can't think of another game that has done this. It is a bad idea
---
Efficient for sure!
---
I've kinda moved away from WS personally. Am trying to finalise my route for 3* mobs. Lower number of legendaries per hour (by a long margin), but I get some gold nuggets, and am happy :)
---
Do the daisycutter mission! It’s pretty easy and it gives you a fatman with 90% reduced carry weight! 
---
It's something unique to the FEV strain that made the Super Mutants too, since things like Snallygasters were made using FEV, but they can become Scorched.
---
And no one will care because it is not fucking everything up for everyone else. Which is the point. The turrets are the problem here.
---
Don't focus on the wrong part of the story, man. -Joe Dirt
---
I asked one guy why he left his base there after he left and he said it was to farm up with his turrets. The turrets dont do that....
---
Yes I did lol I just have trouble with the negative stigma trading seems to have. 
---
Gutsys or Super-Mutants with Assault rifles kill me through 250 DR with full Sentinal. I literally have to spam stim's and run away or ensure i kill them instantly. 
---
Fighting 4 Gutsys's in a field?.. forget that. 
---
Sorry, I don't.  But the total beginning recipe calls for 2 foundations, 4 walls, 2 fences, 1 connector, 2 medium generators, 2 turrets.  Once you build that basic jist, you can modify it as you unlock plans for better / more efficient objects like a large generator, or warehouse walls. 
---
What's the difference in the Rock-it Launcher and the JunkJet?
---
Snallygasters and Grafton Monsters both were made using FEV strains but they have unstable DNA structures so they get scorched versions. Theoretically anyway, I haven’t seen a Scorched GM.
---
I have an explosive scorched 10mm sub that would love this.
---
I unfortunately won’t be on until around 8 pm Pacific time, but if you can wait until then I can get you both for 150 caps each. 
---
Go with a small team. I always do silos with at least two people. Takes about 30-40minutes to complete
---
All perks and levels of the perks need to be single cards. Solves every problem. Why is Lockpicking and Hacking three different cards but Ghoulish is 1 card for 3 levels?
---
What platform? 
---
No worries. It's easy to do on chat boards...... LOL
---
What happened?
---
I would just play and keep grinding. You’ll complete the quest and not even realize it. 
---
I would use a rock it launcher on new people and hit them with deskfans and clipboards so they can't be mad about it.
---
Haha! Yeah I was as well until I learned about the build.
---
was gonna say. suppressor first please. 
---
A few days I assume. How long's it been?
---
Another rank of strong back that allows you to Fast travel while encumbered?  maybe for twice the caps?
---
Explain how it's a bad idea to benefit you for already getting to level (or higher) and wanting to start a new character and get some bonus XP...
---
And I'm not talking about your main character getting bonus XP for "just creating an alt." I mean your lower level gets bonus.
---
Final Fantasy XIV - When you hit level 50/60 with one job, you get bonus XP for lower level jobs.
---
World of Warcarft - You can buy gear (with in game currency) to send to an alt to get boosted XP.
---
Yes, I know this isn't like this games and this isn't an MMO like those but you said you couldn't think of another game that has done this.

Punch Gun

PPK12 Gauss Pistol

Browning auto rifle

how does two games running at the same time affecting your computer ?, mine can barely run one instance.
---
i am thinking of doing this also because i am tired of the risk of losing my shit when transferring items to my alt.
---
put the COMPOUND BOW PLS 
---
or any other bow pls
---
I still see bugs and glitches that I saw from the very first days. 
---
Also unarmed only requires 3 slots but comes with the downside of no power armor 
---
Chameleon mutation? 
---
I've never done a silo with anyone else. I normally just buzz blade the crap out of everything and launch the nuke. If you're on Xbox I'll help you out!
---
Events give caps, rewards that can be sold, and the mobs drop loot that can be sold. Uranium Fever and One Violent Night are both good candidates for getting a lot of caps/ items quickly.
---
If it's too easy, should we be nerfing the players? Or buffing the enemies? It doesn't having to be directly the players stats and view point. 
---
In terms of the irony of "asking for changes", there's another thread out there asking for the backpack to be a mobile work bench. This is entirely unnecessary. We already have a CAMP (the "M" being mobile). There are other work benches scattered across the map as it is.
---
I don't like being called a Commi or a Bucket-head but i guess i just gotta deal with it. 
---
I actually didn't know that 25k caps was the limit. I can never manage to hold more than 1500 at a time because i'm usually buying plans that I don't own (thank god for that update so I don't accidentally buy identical building sets for the 4th time in a row).
---
With this new loot should come with boss type creatures to square off with. 
---
I don’t want these new loots to be available by casually strolling through Whitespring. 
---
There needs to be more of a reward value to good loot. 
---
I only say this because I recently encountered my first mirelurk queen solo and destroyed her. I built her up in my head from my FO4 experience and it was quite disappointing. I feel ... gypped.
---
More monsters!!
---
Keep playing the game, start hitting the events, they pay caps and loot that you can sell, here is a list of vendors you can hit each reset cycle.
---
[Vendor list](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/)
---
Nah, that's not the way anymore. It's only the way for people who don't know where to look. It is on the route but wouldn't say it's best, it's tied.
---
The Three Ws consist of Watoga, West Tek, and Whitesprings. Watoga can spawn multiple legendaries anywhere in the city and some in the buildings. West Tek can spawn up to three, maybe more. Whitesprings still has its crazy possible amount, but they're more likely to be lower.
---
There's 3 events I will always do while I'm in Watoga, which is where I stay. Don't really go anywhere else: Monster Mash, AWOL Armaments, and Horde events, horde depending on which enemy type it is
---
What platform you play on? 
---
Gutsy isn't too bad, but unless you have an AA explosive, don't use guns.
---
Just charge him with your strongest melee and he'll go down fast enough, if he is in groups then back off and lure them around a corner so you can get them one by one.
---
I meleed my way through before so I guess I'm just gonna have to spend a few hours farming Adheesive for repairs first 
---
Stop dying and fast traveling. 
---
But much of what is listed would just be cosmetic, the actual effects would be nearly identical to what we already have for most items listed. Is there really a functional difference between a lever action shotgun and a pump shotgun?  Or a 10mm P90 and the 10mm submachinegun we have now? The time it would take to create the models and add the guns/ammo/mods would be better spent elsewhere.  And then people would crying for even more stash space.  Variety for variety's sake is a waste of resources and resources are limited. Not to mention there is much that needs to be refined still (looking at you energy weapons) before adding a plethora of new armaments. 
---
I asked several questions about your sheet damage on that tesla both with and without demolition expert equipped. I've done 2k damage before and had trouble seeing any visible change in health, so I'm wondering what you expect to see with what damage you're doing
---
All people would do is exploit this. Hit 50 with one character, which doesn't take long and then run alts to gain extra xp. 
---
You came up with 2 games, none of which actually do what you said. WOW is gear with xp boosting perks, not the same thing. And are "jobs" the same as an alternate character?
---
Oh yeah I meant from players. 
---
I did i just thought i needed to share it cuase i liked it
---
Those prices at the vendors are the PLAN prices.  You can find "loose mods" so to speak in the mods category for significantly cheaper and they don't cost junk to make, you just apply the mod.  They are random though and you may or may not find them each time you visit a vendor.
---
There are 7 factions total.  For 1400 caps per day.  Plus what ever you can pull off quests/events/enemy drops.
---
Responders (Charleston, Flatwoods, Morgantown, etc).
---
Raiders (Sutton, many Savage Divide areas, etc.)
---
Whitespring (Whitespring Resort and Station)
---
Enclave (Whitespring Bunker)
---
Watoga (Watoga Station, and the Wandering Merchant Grahm)
---
BOS (Phoenix, in the Watoga Shopping Plaza)
---
Free States (Harper's Ferry)
---
To get larger amounts of caps faster you have to sell to other players.
---
I don't enjoy playing with others too much at all. I may have to come out my shell to do so for this as It's making me resent the game.
---
Sorry, yes mutation. But there are chameleon legendary gear.
---
SBQ killing and selling all drops 
---
Pistol-whip: 25/50/75% chance to stagger your opponent with a bash attack. 
---
They would be mad about it, and then realize 20 levels later that they should have picked that stuff up
---
I found a sweet 2 shot pipe rifle in one of the vendors for 250 caps.
---
Btw I have no proof of this but I get the feeling that some servers have a lot of legendaries while others don’t . Sometimes I’ll go to Westek and find 4 or 5 legendaries then ma y more in whitesprings .. other times I do the same run and find almost nothing.
---
PC name is DeanoSauruzRex
---
Idk, I just made today 500 by selling 2 items + another 200+ for selling each plan/recipe for 20 caps ea. I didn't even bother clearing that 1400 from vendors.
---
I'd hit alllll the plan and recipe spawn locations. 
---
I want to harvest crystals from the scorched and ashes from petrified corpses (and other materials) to make a post modern gamma weapon
---
I don't really enjoy playing with others but I may just have to come out my shell as the frustration is making me resent the game and I really don't want to.
---
Good advice for real life too :)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aeie14/armor_best_mod_dderrrweight_spreadsheet/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Pretty sure a guy just confirmed that Whitesprings is the best location to farm legendaries. Nonetheless, whitespring runs should be in anyone's route for farming legendaries. You keep not farming the golf club and leave it to the rest of us, perfectly fine with me.
---
Instigating superslegde is Nice 
---
that's helpful but really this should be in game as the % of players who use reddit is a tiny sliver of the entire population of the game.
---
It's a matter of making the game welcoming and "easy to learn hard to master" for new players.  The best games follow that premise but fo76 is way too hard to learn given other games are vastly better at teaching players the core mechanics.
---
ahh, ps4 here. was gonna say if you needed help on that platform i could take you through it. always hurts to hear people on their first nuke get a bug then give up. 
---
More information might help. What type of legendary traits do you like? Are you looking for 1, 2 or 3 star legendaries? What damage, fire rate or ammo do you prefer? Are you looking to get a weapon and armor pieces for that price? What type of armor do you typically like to wear? What armor traits, levels, stats, ect. would you like ideally?
---
I do sell everything, buy more stuff, sell buy more stuff never ending cycle. I fast travel with teammates. 
---
Id like the weapons in  game now to get buffed/balanced before they start adding new stuff
---
Stealth boys! 
---
Farm whitesprings golf club I always get chems , XP and stuff to sell at vendors everyday , also make multiple water purifiers n sell the water that’s what I do 
---
Ok, terrible idea fuck me I guess. 
---
Those games do something almost exactly what I'm saying but point missed, great job. 
---
They are well within their right to do it. But, a great majority of people find it annoying and will destroy that base and mercilessly kill them if they try to stop us. Just playing the game the way I want  ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Dude I am a level 133. I have killed the sbq exactly 1 time in 3 tries. I find the game extremely fun and rewarding. Maybe this game just doesn’t have what you’re looking for.
---
I appreciate the offer regardless matey, thank you.
---
I would have to check after work later to see, I’ll let you know
---
Nice!  Whenever someone you don't know says "Trust me." it usually means the opposite.
---
I wouldn't go that far - the game plays just fine - the 10mm and the energy pistols are just really bulky.  It's not a big deal - but they did ask the community for suggestions.  
---
I think with all the bans and what not that just went down, it might take a while
---
Those raiders better watch their mouths!
---
Thank you sooo much
---
It's learned randomly by scrapping any combat armor.
---
Craft up a bunch of light combat armor arms (lowest level) and scrap them all until you learn it.
---
But not exactly what you are saying, so they don't work as an example. You seem to be getting awfully angry about this. If you cannot handle a little constructive criticism, maybe don't post your thoughts online. 
---
Sell more, buy less.
---
I have days where I max out the vendors just selling chems, stimpacks, and purified water. If you do buy from vendors do it after selling to them and you can get some of those caps back too.
---
At best, 2025.
---
Close to a week.
---
Just go in party, i did duo with my friend we finish within 15 mins, but were lvl 100+
---
Are you thinking like the [level 1 shotgun in the Mad Max video game](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4bcGbggfAvkT7viob8vMHQAAAA&amp;pid=Api)?
---
Being a raider doesn't involve consistent racist toxicity. 
---
Stop buying all of the plans!!
---
What type of Brock Lesnar PC do you have?
---
I'm sure this will work eventually, but I've just painted a wall and I'm going to watch the paint dry for a few hours, then go outside and watch the grass grow ;)
---
Yea I’ve been trying to stockpile them but still don’t have many, is there a way to make them or find more easily? and still I wish there was something else.. like if chameleon would last for a few seconds after moving at least 
---
Eventually, I'd like to hit 3\* legendaries but it seems like they are out of my price range currently. TSE is the ultimate goal for the shotgun and/or hunting rifle. For melee, as the person above has mentioned, instigating or AA are very nice and anything that reduces weight.  
---
WRT to armor, Level 45-50 is the goal with traits that reduce weight. Not sure whether to favor Bolstering or Chameleon. I typically prefer Combat Armor.
---
This worked for me as well. TYVM!
---
Unfortunately I enjoy and prefer playing alone, and don't have any friends that play let alone being lvl100
---
Those super mutants calling us bucket heads are literally wearing buckets on their heads!
---
You said it yourself in the very first sentence.
---
First Balance and FIX existing Weapons and most likely Damage Resistances too.
---
Then we can have new shiny stuff.
---
Maybe a sort of turret that you have to plant and pick up would be cool, for crowd control
---
I have that problem too, never been able to loot them. On PC if it matters.
---
Low life and low defense would definitely get me killed, because I'm, at best, 'average' at this game.  
---
So what I'm taking from this is that I should be using anti-armor or instigating.
---
Thank you much.  (I'd also welcome anyone else's opinion if they are different.  More info is always better.)
---
it also decreases the chances of getting a legendary roller pin or something dumb like that. which is good
---
This is the kind of shit players have to deal with when Bethesda doesn't have a proper trading system. It sucks that you can't safety trade items, you either set the cap price to something really high or drop at the same time.
---
Woah! Nice tats! It's like you guys belong to a secret society.
---
Gamestop economic strategies can stand the test of time. Even in a post-nuclear apocalypse.
---
What if they just added new weapon plans? Players who buy them can become arms dealers 
---
If you are Xbox, I can team up and am very casual. GT same as my reddit name.
---
Would "furious" not be good for a 1h melee which swings pretty fast?  I just discovered a list of the modifiers, which is really helping my understanding.  
---
yes but its pretty underwhelming 
---
A lot of scrapped junk items are unsellable unless bulked. I find that either bulking this items, or selling junk before you scrap it (when they’re still bottles and plates and whatnot) allows you to actually sell more things. Helps as well if you have an excess amount of scrap junk that you barely ever use 
---
Alternatively,  find or make things to sell. I used to farm , cook and sell mothman eggs. Now I craft and sell witch costumes and I collect straight jackets from Fort Defiance and assault rifles from muties to sell. I make my 1400 caps a day doing this. It doesn’t take up much time to have a craft/farm/sell routine. 
---
Your best course of action would be to Ban the player, they will then no longer be able to annoy you.
---
I think it very unlikely, like most companies that you will receive more than a confirmation of your ticket, they would not wish to enter into a discussion regarding such issues, just my opinion.
---
I don't think they should change much about the current game's difficulty because IMO it's very likely that Nuclear Winter is a hardmode. So I have no interest in the difficulty of the base game at this point, I just let the devs balance as they see fit and wait for the real challenge to come. 
---
And this is what I mean when I say we lack insight that is necessary to make calls. Without knowing the ins and outs of the development process, and specific knowledge of the future, we can offer opinions but they're gonna largely be useless. This is why I tend to prefer offering feature and content suggestions and requests over advising the devs how to do their job when it comes to mechanics changes. :-p
---
As to your last point, I agree. I don't think backpacks offering workshops is necessary, there are plenty of places around Appalachia to scrap, and I've even had a few fun times desperately trying to find one of them when overloaded. 
---
That said, I wouldn't object to Bethesda adding in a 'field scrap kit' backpack variant, which I've seen in a few FO4 mods. I just think if they do add it it should be something you don't get until much later in the game, and should probably have a high cost for its convenience. 
---
Wdym? As much as I wish there were dragon shouts in this game I haven’t found any yet, players can screech?
---
Who cares, the servers will be reverse engineered and up and running by July. That way we can mod the game and fix it screwed up game they have handed us.
---
I don't care if they try to pull a "creation club" crap because that will only effect the console users. Just lke with fo4, Skyrim, fo3, oblivion, and morrowind the pc modding community will just do it and put it on the nexus and the pc players won't waste their money on sub par mods from bgs.
---
Or one could just exclude rolling pins from being able to be legendary.
---
Sounds like a dodgy first launch is a rite of passage tbh...
---
Fee for free?
---
How the fuck does one prove a negative?  If I hear **nothing** from Bethesda, and get downvotes when I mention it, what the hell am I supposed to think?
---
If they mention they are fixing one atom shop thing, they should be really fixing the other busted atom shop things.
---
Events can give you plans so you don’t need to buy them plus you get exp and caps too!
---
Please give me m1 garand Bethesda.
---
I need that ping
---
Please
---
The Rock-It Launcher also made an appearance, albiet a diminished one, in F4. In F3 it could at times become difficult to get by without that beast, and I enjoyed shooting the teddy bears out of them, which were the most damaging ammo. 
---
Of course now all junk is worth scrapping so it's really a money cannon. 
---
Sell to Vendors. Don't buy. If you're buying that many Plans then you haven't done enough Events. Events / Workshops give Plans. Scavenge for more Plans / Recipes (start with Pleasant Valley Cabins and farm that for a bit). Again, if you're buying anything other than Mods/Sought Weapons/Armour, you're doing yourself over. The world is lush with items to scavenge and Perks to make the Game easier. Buying Plans is more of an end game for when the odds of unknown Plans dropping is significantly lower.     
---
    
---
I sell to Vendors and earn my 1400, then farm Events (cheapest Fast Travel I.e. V76 or from my Central Appalachia Camp). When there aren't Events on, Scavenge. Start by picking an area and exploring every tiny detail of an area. You're sure to load up on Ammo, Aid, mats and potential new Plans and Recipes. Personally I've been exploring every Primary Location, starting in the NW of the map and working my way SE by Region and I find amazing stuff.
---
I am not saying that it's OK, but I think raiders might not be as politically correct we are these days. I think raiders might say anything and for sure they have said some homophobic stuff in original Fallouts.
---
But when its another player saying that stuff, it's not OK.
---
I just thought that politically correct raiders are a funny idea.
---
People before me are spot on.. Hoard and sell. But learn prices. Get hard bargain and travel agent perks. Pop grape mentats. Easy to make. Build a few purifiers. I have 4. Every so on its 20 purified water. Use pharma farma and hit up medical places. Tonnes of drugs. Sell for a great price. Hunt for straight jackets. Sell for 47 caps a piece. Learn the tactical helmet plan. Sells for approx 30 a pop.
---
If you put in the research it can be done bud
---
I only spend caps on plans or mods that I have an immediate purpose for. besides that I just grind away at events to get new plans and clean out the vendor caps as much as you can. 
---
What were they saying?
---
Just got one from claiming Abandoned Bog Town but thanks for the offer
---
Oh yeah! I had a furious buzzblade with over repair, let's say it got stupid (had attack speed as well)
---
I added you, I see you added me. You good at 500? I can't use my mic in-game right now.
---
Yeah, and it's not like I aimed it at or close to myself. I was expecting a big explosion.
---
I run the low lvl events. Also selling bulk. That's the main way I get caps. And just looting everything u come across
---
Haha lucky. I pick through those posts but never find anything I don’t have. I’ll have to start looking more often!
---
That's a good idea. Though, the real reason I don't have a fatman is the weight of those damn mini nukes.
---
There's a toy shop? 
---
Yup
---
That did the trick thanks, got one from claiming Bog Town  
---
I guess there are a certain amount of plans that can roll randomly from "workshop events"  
---
For example got a Wooden Crate plan, never seen that at a vendor  
---
Gonna look to compile a list as i started to do workshop events more frequently
---
Again, I agree with you. But manually tracking via the spreadsheet is better than wasting materials on endless scrapping when you could have figured out you have nothing left to learn from it. I know, the last armor mod to unlock can take hundreds of pieces. I wasted materials making and scrapping light robots arms trying to unlock some mods that I already had unlocked, but wouldn't show up in the UI because of a bug that prevents those mods from being added to robot arms even if you learned them.
---
The screw was metaphor for "Don't screw with me" lol
---
I once met a guy named ElvisLives or sth along those lines, he looked like Elvis, and he had it. It was fairly early into game and I did not know how to take photos yet, I was speeding to level 50, been building stair-handing ugly camps, powerlearning the game. Not having any proof for that is one of these gaming-related things I regret the most. Amazing how he perfected looks of his character before I learned to use photo system.
---
And kill supermutants. They carry caps.
---
Get the "Woochucker" Perk and collect some wood in the wild. Bulk it and sell it to vendors. You can aquire many caps by this method, or just bulk your scrap in general. It makes room in your stash and you make caps. 
---
Hope this helps
---
Yeah, I don't "get" the Robobrains.  Smoke grenades are just pointless, and yet it's all they ever seem to do.
---
I'm mostly okay with Assaultrons in this game.  There is a method to taking them down.  My qualms, like yours, are the inconsistency with their attacks likely due to latency.
---
I'm likewise okay with Colonel Gutsy and his AP rounds.  He should hit hard.  And, you know, as bad as Colonel Gutsy can be, at least this isn't Borderlands 2.  We don't have enemies that zap away all your shields and do x% damage in a single hit (basically, instant "next hit kills" projectiles).
---
But at the same time, I don't think he's properly balanced for the numbers you can potentially fight at once, primarily because they dish out damage at a rate faster than a standard Stimpack can heal.  That aspect seems broken to me.
---
god bless that mission! I played it with a friend, and we made the mistake of both doing the roof turn in at the same time.... so.many.gutsies.
---
We both died once, and it was *real fear* the potential drop, the enemies, the un-ending horde of merciless green spheres.... one of the BEST VICTORIES!
---
I agree with whisper, that's the end game challenge I want. I want a minorly-punishing-death to be a real risk, and then to have a rewardingly-hard event!
---
If they had bronze, silver and gold events that scaled up to where the gold were as hard as "mayor for a day gutsy-pocalyse" I'd be THRILLED to try them. right now the game feels like everything except this event is a bronze, maaaybe the enclave event at robco where you defend against.... *gasp* another horde of gutsies compares, but it's the only other real challenge besides the SBQ.
---
I don't think we lack insight at all. We can see how the game was designed works in practice. With that, we can offer changes for it to work better.
---
A good example is in Rainbow Six Siege, the character Tachanka was designed with the thought the game would be played a certain way. In practice, he is trash. The devs don't even know what to do with him now.
---
A design concept changes with how the audience plays. From there, we can offer suggestions. The insight is the application of the product.
---
I craft civil war era suits which don't take much to craft and sell them for usually 20 caps each. I don't use chems so I always pick them up to sell. 
---
Avoiding racism isn't being politically correct. It is just having common decency for everyone around you.
---
Dual gauntlets please. 
---
Many games respond letting you know action has been taken. That is all I want to know.
---
Word i’ll be on at 8. Thanks brother
---
hahaha i treat screws and springs like GOLD
---
You might want to try to serverhop. My first solo was really easy and others have been allmost impossible..
---
Oh please give me back my 50. Cal. I loved that bad boy
---
I gotta disagree with you. I’ve seen the complaints and I’ve never had an issue with him. It might be my sentinel’s armor or my 400 DR outside power armor, but he’s never been different really than something as formidable as a super mutant to me.
---
I seek out lower level players and drop food and drink every time I log in. (Xbox) If you see me... please say hello. I wear a clown outift with a tattered mole head.
---
Tyvm for the response...I didn’t know about the closed feature and will absolutely start using it, even on dud trade posts.  I’d assumed that by deleting the old posts I was doing the sub a favor by reducing clutter.
---
The bus nearest to the Enclave bunker service entrance has a random hat spawn inside. Relog until it shows. I check it everytime I pass and have found a 'clean space helmet' and Sack Hood (and lots of cop hats)
---
Lets see. An offensive term towards people of color a few times, mixed in with other pretty nasty insults. They stalked across the entire map and attempted to locate on another server. 
---
If you think a karma system would reduce griefing, I'm sure it would increase it since some toxic people will want to be the best in their category. 
---
someone said a mean thing I didn't want to see!
---
&gt; If this is how he is meant to be, what is the intended strategy for getting past limitless numbers of him?  
---
One-shot him with a melee attack. Use cover to shoot him while he can't shoot back at you. Use long ranged weapons. Shoot his vulnerable spots.
---
I wish more enemies were actually threatening like Col. Gutsy.
---
I guess were just gonna turn a blind eye to the quad missile launcher, the broadsider, the super sledge and let’s not forget the most unrealistic one of them all,
---
The Fatman
---
I'll have to take a look at what I have tucked away in my stash. I might be able to help you out on the weapons front. I will PM you if I find some options for you.
---
Would love for there to be more unarmed moves/animations. 
---
Does Grenadier actually increase the explosion range of Fatman and other weapons like missile/grenade launcher?
---
I'm not sure I've noticed it with the other explosive weapons, although it would explain the many times I've been hit by the nuke radius from a mile away.
---
Cant wait for a bot to staff The Candy Shoppe, so I can get my bubblegum on
---
I heard they were going to drop the weight in the next update! 
---
I appreciate that thank you!
---
I can't wait for the four horsemen PA skins to come out. I have never spent a real world dime in the atom shop, but I will for those!
---
&gt;How the fuck does one prove a negative?
---
You’re not proving a negative. You’re proving that they stated a negative. If you can’t prove they stated they aren’t fixing the issue you brought up, you have no evidence that they aren’t fixing it.
---
&gt;If they mention they are fixing one atom shop thing, they should be really fixing the other busted atom shop things.
---
There’s nothing saying that they aren’t fixing other “busted atom shop things”, as far as I can tell, and as far as you’ve been able to show. What they did was reply to a post about *one specific item* saying they’re looking into that item. They’re not going to list everything they’re working on fixing every time they reply to a post about a specific issue saying they’re looking into that issue.
---
Op I echo your sentiments. I've solo'd the silos a few times. Couldn't do the first time. But it gave me the experience I needed. Unless u have some real good armor. Go in power armor. Take radaway and stimpacks. Like a lot. I was Lvl 54 approx.
---
If you dont have. The hacker and lock pick perks really help.
---
Dont press on each core when destroying. I shot them with explosive weapons.
---
Invest in born survivor perk card. Auto stims at a certain level
---
Go slow. Use the pcs to ur advantage. Make the turrets kill half the bots. Then turn them off.
---
Just remember to repair the cores later u need to step out of ur pa. But u can collect 15 and destroy them to rebuild easy enough at that tinkers bench. Just look behind u regular. Lol. 
---
Your on xbox, I can join you if you want someone to watch your back out there.
---
&gt; The lvl 65 Scorchbeast flying overhead didn't help anything either. 
---
I had a Scorchbeast attack during that quest also, it actually did help by getting in a fight with the robots.
---
I thought they were enameled buckets at first, too (would have been a fun easter egg of a pun), but they're propane tanks.
---
Someone said a thing and you submitted a ticket. It's really really not that big of a deal, seriously. 
---
&gt; Glad to see the fallout community promotes racism
---
Oh shut up
---
No problem man. My Beth.net is Nathan_TK. After I get your name I’ll add ya when I get home from work. 
---
Yeah, I agree with you. But I also think that my joke did not offend anyone. It was a joke about raiders.
---
Did you see my Seneca Rocks build? I'm pretty proud of it. :p
---
That's normal on online games. What platform?
---
Hey bro. Couple people offered it for cheaper later tonight so I think i’m just going to take them up on that. Down to trade whatever if you want. Thanks for taking the time
---
I would think an easy fix (on paper) would be to create a clan system that has it's own b.a.s.e system that the leader can claim land for - separate from your mobile c.a.m.p. - and everyone in your clan can build in it. Maybe make it 4x bigger than the c.a.m.p size.
---
Zzzzzzzzzz
---
I would love a furious nail gun with faster fire rate with limb dmg. And I miss my LOVE &amp; HATE so much. Preferably with SS +1STR and bleed dmg lol
---
Sell yourself to 100 fat chicks for 10 caps each
---
I will sometimes kill a legendary enemy and when I go to get my loot the body glitches to a regular enemy with crappy loot. 
---
that's a bingo! hide and flank is the melee approach to win. also, let your allies draw agro for a bit lol, currently it looks like they'll "focus fire" on one target in a realllllly dangerous way, you want to drop that agro, and then re-engage.
---
I would love that throw dirt in their face move to return.
---
NP.
---
Okay good it was a one off
---
We still need a way to get legendary variants of new weapons. I think the new boss/enemies can drop them or rewards from the new quests.
---
"Action has been taken against a player you reported" 
---
Has been done in games before. No legal recourse. 
---
Man i hope they dont bungle the prestige system. if it comes out and everyone above 50, no matter how high level, can reset to 50 and get 1 prestige lvl, there will be problems.
---
I cant wait for the scouting quests and backpacks and merit badges
---
Still wishing for a proper bow here. Make it more Skyrim-ish! 
---
no offense, but are you moving? I don't wear PA and the laser is almost a joke, I just bait them into firing it, then sidestep it and keep killing them. the head-beam is never on me for long enough to do anything.
---
* Get Hard Bargain 3.
---
* Bulk and sell junk you aren't using.
---
* Build Water purifiers at your CAMP and sell Purified Water.
---
* Kill Super Mutants, who always drop a Cap or two.
---
* Always kill the Grafton Monster, who drops about 20 Caps.  Two in Charleston, very easy to kill.
---
* Pick up and sell guns from nearby battles back to vendors.
---
* Certain clothing is worth a lot.  I recently discovered I can craft Civil War hats that sell for 33 Caps a pop.
---
* Don't buy things unless you have a decent cushion of Caps first.  Make 1,000 your metaphorical 0.  You'll always have some for a rainy day.
---
Bethesda shouldnt listen to this forum regarding PvP changes.  (Im pretty sure they dont)
---
Actual PvPers are not represented and suggestions are completely one sided in favor of PvE 
---
Everything you guys suggest has a downside for the friendly PvPer. 
---
You guys keep downvoting PvPers and call them griefers and worse.
---
Your post isnt so bad. Just dont sweat a small bounty. Coulda been a work shop or mutation .
---
The mutations are all broken in some way or another. Just get rid of it if it pulls u into unwanted pvp
---
The downvotes tell me that is the case. 
---
Why are you so angry someone is calling out racism is my question?
---
It can be solo'd but you really need to be prepared. Bullets galore, as many stimpacks as you can carrry,etc.  And if you aren't attached to where your CAMP is, maybe move it closer to the start, because I noticed when I died a couple times in there if I was past a certain point it'd respawn me near the end and I'd have to travel back to the beginning elevator. 
---
Being in a team with at least one other person would make it easier, though. 
---
Ranger Outfits and straight jackets sell for a decent price.
---
ender chest
---
My guy I haven’t come across a single “game breaking” bug. Not one. You’re making a straw man argument based on circumstantial evidence. I paid $60 for this  game a few weeks ago and I am more than happy with it. I dare say it’s my favorite game in the past year aside from Red Dead 2 and God of war. 
---
You just seem to think that paying $70=the perfect game. And that simply isn’t the case. Sorry to tell you
---
Great write up!  
---
I would add a point of debate, the total stars obtained from an 3* is very fluid, I have one character that loots a 3*, off the same NPC, about a third as often as the second character.
---
Go into a nuke zone with greenthumb on, collect 120 flux and sell it, dont turn it into stable.. its worth 12caps a plant, easy and stupidly fast way of making money everyday. Allllways look for a nuke at whitesprings if youre gonna take that approach
---
This is amazing! Keep us up to date when you're going to have these events!
---
Pretty much. Something more like [this slamming of two pipes two fire a shell](http://concealednation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/oneshot_shotgun.jpg) the front pipe holds the shell with the back face open and is slammed back into the back pipe which has a form of “spike” to fire the shell out of the barrel front pipe. 
---
I hope they never add all the guns as i think them fixing the current weapons seems to be overwhelming. Problem 2 is even when things get fixed they often get reverted back to a broken state. 
---
  Though i love the idea of not having one type of gun everyone uses but a large variety each with their own perk. A real reason to have a diversified skill system.  Having one specific weapon stacked with certain op abilities is where we are at and its very disappointing. It's also something i hate that every game does. But in fallout your not a tank or a dps or a healer. Your just a dude smacking stuff to death. Why type cast melee or ranged to 1 or 2 weapons. They need to bring back uniques. Which  would make things like roller pins and golf clubs great. Unique grannie's roller pin. fire damage and a set armor penetration. POTUS golf club +20 liberty and justice for all. Instead it just simply adds +20 damage over a typical end game club leaving it a formidable/entry find.  They banked too much on the borderlands system. Something i don't mind in its own game but its ruining the fallout experience.
---
You're better off getting a T60 set from in game and do the Mayor For A Day quest once you hit lvl 50.  That's all you need to start farming away.
---
Lol you know something is going to be wrong when a shady stranger says trust me.
---
Its either Heavy bos combat armor or heavy metal. The metal has the highest damage resistance but has low energy resistence. The bos has a bit of lower damage resistance but has higher energy resistance than heavy metal.
---
If you don't want to sell it to other players, there isn't a way to sell it. I dump mine at Watoga train station in the suitcase with other junk I don't want, normally. 
---
Posted something similar to this a few days ago, got shit on by trolls who probably build their camps behind the golf club. It's a popular farm and nuke spot, having a camp with turrets behind it is incredibly annoying and makes everything lag hardcore when the stupid turrets are lighting everything up. If I see it, I level it. Repeatedly. Until the camp owner leaves. I literally don't care if I end up wanted or die a few times in the process, if I see turrets behind the golf club, Imma wreck it
---
Ah cook. Thanks!
---
If you’re open to trading with folks, farming legendaries can be pretty profitable. You don’t need 3* max level god rolls to generate offers on Bazaar or Market. Just need the right modifiers. I put up a few items yesterday and two trades later had 7k. 
---
Golf outfits/skirts are always good. Glowing steak. Raw flux. Excess junk/chems can be sold off. 
---
just a random thought:  what if every player can do daily quest that enables them to apply a random legendary attribute on one of these newly-craftable weapons for 1-star, maybe once a week for a 2nd effect, once a month for a 3rd.  i dont know.
---
I can't confirm. I'm only reading off the card itself. the nuke itself wouldn't be counted though since it's not an actual weapon.
---
Knew where this was going but wanted to look anyway, didn't disappoint
---
Yeah, variation on the theme is great. But don't just horde me with gutsys at every opportunity.
---
Kill enemies with expensive guns such as combat guns, assault guns, etc., then loot them and sell them with maxed Hard Bargain.  Fast travel with Travel Agent from place to place and repeat: kill, get guns, sell guns.  These guns get you 20-30 caps apiece or more.  Get 70 of these and you can comfortably sell for 1400 caps for the day.  Each location may have 10 to 30 enemies.  You go to only 2-4 locations and will be able to get 70 guns.  Pro tip: go to locations near train stations.  You will be overencumbered after looting a location and it's better to be near a train station.  Sell to the vendor there for 200.  Keep the surplus guns in your stash.  Go to a train station in another zone, pick up the surplus guns from the stash and continue selling them.  Go to locations near that train station and repeat.  This way, you visit a variety of locations and will feel less monotonous and grindy than, say, grinding at the same places over and over.
---
This actually got taken out. One of my teammates had their camp destroyed cause it was right in a nuke zone, and when they picked it up to move it, all their stuff was still broken
---
Lol 😂
---
Already built my X-01 using the plans from the Enclave and have an All Rise and Blade of Bastet, so I am set on that front. Thus, I would prioritize obtaining an ideal shotgun and/or hunting rifle over melee right now. When I am not rocking the PA, my current armor pieces aren't great, which is why I would like to improve on that.
---
100% agree something needsto be done about Energy weapons. They are underused and weak. When they should be futuristic baddies.
---
Have you shot a P90 and a MP5? (which I think the 10mm SMG is loosely based on) If you're a gun enthusiast, the difference is everything. Differences in the kick, reload, DPS, etc. 
---
I've own a Remmington pump shotgun and a Winchester lever action shotgun. They both handle differently and both have their unique charm. You don't simply shoot one and say "meh the other is exactly the same, I'll pass"
---
Bf1, 64 person chat per game. Don't overcomplicate it...
---
Graham is affiliated with the Watuga Station vendor??  I thought he was part of the Raider group...
---
Judges presiding in PA, Yes!
---
You forgot the perforators from the pit 
---
&gt; As we walk pass by eachother, he shouts "You nooooob". Once I reached his bag, it had a beer lol. Then he shouts "you tried to scam me"
---
How can one person be so completely and utterly full of fail. Your instincts were right.
---
&gt;I couldn't help myself, so I went to his junk bag and dropped the beer bottle he gave me back into it
---
And this is the part where the story went from good to great.
---
A 45 caliber tommy gun mag would hold 10mm with ease. 
---
Ive also seen 1911 45cal drums. 
---
And c96 mauser "broomhandle" drum mags. 
---
And i know this is crazy but the camp unit.. is a milling machine. As a former machinist.. i can assure you.. imagination is the only thing that lacks.
---
I'd be interested to hear where you farm at for the 3*, as that's really all I'm after myself - god tier 2* and 3*.
---
Sounds like a "shitty" idea..
---
~~I had to, I'm sorry~~
---
Disgusting, neo-vaginas are literally an open wound that has to have a dildo shoved up them to stop it from healing and shutting close. I didn't bring politics to this sub, you did, so here we are. Call me transphobic if you wish, but I refuse to allow gender dysmorphia to be acceptable in society. Sorry all for my tangent and gruesome description, but this shit is enough.
---
Dont forget the unequip one of your weapons when getting in or out of power armour, or when fast travelling, or when going in or out of a building, or just cause!
---
You can do what you want, but don't be surprised when we do what WE want and level your turret base...
---
I get the screw thing you did, but nothing beats Spoiled Meat in a paper bag!
---
I picked a death tambo off a L6 scorch during path of the wind.
---
It deals nearly as much damage as the furious fire axe\* (dmg 73, slow), but at medium speed, the death tambo is faster and much lighter.  
---
It also seems to last a long time before needing repair.
---
In the same session, I picked up a mole miner claw.  The MM deals slightly more damage (upper 70s, IIRC) than the tambo, but (in my experience) needed repair much sooner, and at 12#, is a lot heavier than the death tambo. (and I have melee weapon weight perks).
---
Bonus - the little clapping cymbal noise every time you swing...Priceless.
---
I hope he found that bottle. He could use it after failing to pull such a low and sleazy scam.
---
Pretty sure he shares a pool with Watoga.  Not that it really matters cause no one is hunting him down to do their daily vendor cap run.  
---
Key is at Fort Defiance in the room to the left I think. Along the left wall on a desk when you walk in.
---
I didn't know that, thanks. That is unfortunate too.
---
Ok thank you but this post is very old and I found out by now lol. How did you find this post anyway?
---
honestly from what they posted, this seems like the direction they want to take things: specific solutions, to specific problems.
---
which is good... IF you know what you're going up against. having to keep and store 3+ sets of anti-very-specific-creature armor and weapons is a stash nightmare.
---
that said, right now with gutsies being the top-tier-threat AND being in the silos, troubleshooters is the most bang-for-you-space that I see for the non-PA players.
---
It's depressing out here, no females that I can find. 
---
I've seen this brought up before by players and have mentioned it in the past to the Dev's. I'll be sure to include this in my report again!
---
I won't lie, I have a beefy PC, but I run a YouTube channel that does heavily modded Fallout 4 let's plays and I stream sometimes too, so it was needed (and it's a tax writeoff on my revenue, so there's that). 
---
The specs that matter:
---
i9-9900K
---
2080 TI XC2 Ultra
---
16 GB DDR4 3200mhz RAM
---
This thing has been a dream to play so far. Now that said, I assume most people will be happy with 60 FPS in Fallout 76, and while playing at nearly max settings, I get 120 FPS with both running, and I never get FPS dips. I turned down shadow distance and a few other things that have absolutely zero noticeable graphical effect, but massively improve performance - there was a Reddit post by a guy on here a while back that really helped there.
---
I had a guy put an item armor for sale, that was 3* but two useless perks that we didn't agree on. He bounced and I learnt my lesson. Then this dude comes by lol.
---
Its great. Look for a big cuddly bat. They are friendly and will give you rides across the harsh, unforgiving wastel- uh utopian paradise. 
---
Why not just leave the server
---
Just gonna throw this out there, but it was a level 45 tse shotgun. You were being WAY over charged. Sorry you got screwed over dude

yes and fuck yes, this is so easy as well, so please add them bethesda

Lol if only I had one. Would have sat in there really good.
---
Workshops struck me as the kind of places you would see settlements form around in other games (e.g. Wade Airport, Red Rocket Mega Stop, etc.).  They also have the resources to provide incentives for players to hold a location.  If you integrated a faction system into the game, you could get some fun game play.
---
Workshops currently start off with free materials.  Selling off bulk scrap to vendors isn't very immersive.  Contributing bulk crafting and building materials to a faction's workshop store would make small acts like grabbing a beer bottle or a bag of concrete feel connected to other people and the world.  
---
A faction exchange would make things more engaging.  I'd much rather contribute to a group than sell stuff to a vendor.  Give players the tools to work together.  
---
TL;DR: Workshops turned into TOWNS could be fun.
---
I get enough shit from those winged assholes already (love the idea!)
---
“We want you to drop a nuke on an ant colony in the mire”
---
 -oh shit giant ants!
---
“We want you to drop nuke on a Grafton monster in the toxic valley”
---
 -oh shit, a giant Grafton monster is on a rampage 
---
“Nuke this tick nest that scares me”
---
 - oh shit, giant ticks... log off 
---
I’ll check
---
Coolness is an important factor. If you can dedicate the time, go for it!
---
I have an furious explosive 10mm sub (that I bought from the train station by whitespring after someone apparently sold it there). I would also love this.
---
Reddit Admins are site wide staff members. There are no subreddit Admins, there are moderators (who are volunteers). 
---
I am a moderator here / fallout subs that I have either created or worked on for years while developing the Reddit Fallout Network with u/shaka1277. 
---
No, just no. SBQ is one of the worst raid bosses I have had to experience. 0 mechanics, 0 danger, 0 challenge, humongous loot pool, accessible to every low level- It is literally made for idi\*ts. 
---
Funny but not surprising, it's the same in Fo4 with the rifleman perk's "ignore X% of a target's armor".
---
I wish...  I'd love a raid on a King Megasloth or Master Behemoth.  There was a post a few weeks ago about Boss fights by region, not sure if bethesda is thinking about that however. 
---
3k won't go very far - probably best off using it to get a 1-2* shotgun/hunting rifle, not those armor pieces.  You can just use power armor until you get better armor pieces, at some point you'll be swimming in armor pieces.
---
Bring back the Chinese Pistol and the Anti-Material rifle. Please.
---
Thanks for posting this! The basic concept was brought up in a s[imilar post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/auzzde/camp_towns_idea_i_was_told_to_post_here_think_itd/), so I've already passed this request along, but I appreciate you taking time to post.

Any idea what kind you want? You looking to spend 3k per or 3k combined?
---
Noted! I'll pass that along. :)
---
I'll help out with a silo run if you'd like. I've helped a few random people I saw running them solo. Having someone to share aggro helps a lot.

D'aww, Thank you SantiagoCeb, Thats much nicer than the other things we're usually called in Modmail / DMs about how we should burn in hell :)

No, just get 1 piece of Chameleon legendary armor and you are always invisible as long as you crouch and don't move.

Moonshiners shack near vault 76???

Please add more Not Shotguns so I can go around not using them because Shotgun is the only viable weapon."

There are 7 constant unique vendors. Responders, Raiders, Brotherhood, Free States, Watoga, Whitesprings, and Enclave. Graham has his own pool too, but he is difficult to find. They have 200 caps each. Sell them shit every day. You figure out what to sell. It could be excess chems, excess junk, or in my case, high condition assault and combat rifles. 
---
Charisma is not the only determination for how much you get for stuff. Luck increases condition of found items. Condition also effects value. A 120% condition assault rifle gets me about 44 caps a pop. I just farm high level super mutants and scorched and sell their shit.
---
Also, a neat little tip, players have caps... You have gun... You see where I am going with this...?
---
Yeah, i'd say that'd be fair. You've got a few minutes to run back from wherever you have to spawn in and get your stuff, it's fair game. Make it 15, and it's half the log-out timer,   and provides for more "I have to kill things to get there" time. 
---
Shrek and his family moved into town. Don't know what happened to Donkey but one of them has a cow. They like to give high -fives and talk about grilling
---
I do as many drops as I can, but sometimes you die _when you're doing a supply run_. I mean, this isn't a hard issue to grasp. The current system is garbage, and "you should stash more" isn't useful advice. 
---
Best bang for the buck, preferably. However, if there is a weapon/armor piece that is excellent for 3k, I wouldn't be averse to doing that.
---
Is there flying koala bears?
---
You can make 1400 from all of the vendors every day. You can also sell decent loot to other players for a few k here or there. Hard bargain and some consumable for char helps.
---
You can complete events (These also give out plans) or do cap stash runs (though these aren't as good as they used to be.)
---
Two Vaults are opening up this summer that are going to be high level raids.

Point Pleasant and the road to the south.  Also, (not sure of the name) the lumber yard close to Vault 76.

It hilarious when he plays a game he doesn't like. Such as Ryse, where [he rages both about the gameplay and the historical inaccuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LizNHHPMPUI&amp;list=PLwH1xJhcXG0cpqbkC3c1wCDs-EKE8vEEk). It's beautiful.

If you look a person or persons has set up bots to auto down-vote EVERY new post on this Reddit. Generally post votes will stabilize but I always get 2-3 down-votes immediately after posting a new topic.
---
Man I wanted too so badly! I think I could have probably two shotted him but I was still in no PVP mode. Oh well...:)
---
Well players are doing it anyway and there is no way to stop it since you can just use a friend as middle man to transfer your items so might as well make it a feature and let everyone enjoy it without bothering your friends or using randoms and hoping they wont server hop.
---
Get rid of your pool tables and paintings in camp. Use the additional budget to grow tatos, sell rinse and repeat...... with green thumb and hard bargain you will be stacking mad caps.
---
Pretty sad of them.

I would love to stumble upon the holy grail of sniper rifles in 338 LM !

Why not just ban toxic players? Not enable them.

It's utter chaos....  Dogs and Cats sleeping together and everything.

If I'm at any sort of range, they are able to track me with the laser. If I'm at point blank range, I can get behind them and the laser isn't any threat at that point. But they seem to pivot on me when they are firing the laser and I'm outside of VATS Melee Range, roughly.
---
Dropped bags do eventually de-spawn when you log off, but it takes a while, usually at least 15 minutes.
---
I have 2 Xboxes, and see this regularly when I drop goodie bags for newbies.
---
Nah. It doesn't fit with the feel of the game at all. Too angry, too edgy. 
---
Bethesda takes these kinds of things very seriously, [as evidenced by past disciplinary actions](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-30-bethesda-bans-fallout-76-player-for-life-following-shocking-homophobic-attack).
---
Yeah, i havent encountered any diseased supermutant so far.. 
---
More than you can count.
---
I get more damage from a Gutsy then from a Scorchbeast its ridicilous. 
---
Not sure if you are talking about the silo nukes or the Fatman mininukes. My bad, I should have said mininukes' radius intead of nukes'.
---
Maybe it's just the Fatman having more range than it looks like or me being terrible at staying far enough.
---
I’m pretty sure the incinerator wasn’t in fallout 2
---
He facing the wrong way though.
---
Yes, there are some "flavors" of power armor that are available at different levels. You got lucky and found the lvl 25 flavor. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power\_armor\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76))
---
Was doing Battle Bot, got a Fat Man and one mini nuke as a reward? just for shits an giggles i find a scorched wanderer...get on a hill, launch it 70% vats chance, its hits and doesnt kill. I shook my head with laughter. 
---
Probably why i dont use it or really see anyone break it out at the SBQ.
---
But yes it is probably the most iconic Fallout Weapon.
---
Those are really cool and simple. How much did they charge? lol
---
thanks for the reply, I tend to bum-rush everything which is probably why I haven't seen this.
---
you can definitely play a "what attack will they use" dance by moving in and out of their melee range to bait the head-laser when you're close, and then smack em in the back.
---
Or maybe they could spam bloody screech attacks 
---
Cheaty? How so?   
---
Pay to win? Yeah I can get behind that. We are essentially buying a second copy of the game to use additional the same feature multiple times.  
---
But explain how this is cheating?
---
I would assume it does increase the radius. To add, do you have the MIRV launcher mod? It appears these rounds detonate on proximity rather than impact like the standard launcher.
---
I *believe* it’s working as intended but to make sure I’ll check in with the Dev’s on this one and update you on this when I have an answer.
---
Just south of Vault 76, there's a house that spawns 3-5 tucks for me. 
---
I think there are reasons that the NV specific weapons are not....legally allowed to be included?   But I would like to see more "named" weapons in the game.  Beyond just legendaries.  
---
IMO: All named weapons should come with a plan (similar to the Mysteries weapons) that allow the owner to upgrade them.  Example, if you follow the story you'll probably get ahold of an almost uselessly low level copy of the Summerset Special and the Perfect Storm.  Not to mention some of the armor pieces like the Trail Blazer.  Why can't they come with a plan that has the existing weapon as one of the components that allows you to up-level your named unique weapon?  
---
As for weapons that exist in some form which I'd like to see inlcuded?  There's a whole HOST of melee weapons they could include....even if they code them into place as essentially re-skins of existing weapons.  Why can't I have a Katana? (just reuse the code from the Rev Sword, with a new skin).  There are guns we could see added....Give me a Spartan Laser please (some kind of continuous beam weapon rather than the multitude of beams that the gatlas gives you),  Why not more weapons that share ammo?  Can we have some kind of mid-level plasma weapon that actually makes use of Plasma Cores as its Ammo?  How about a Grenade Mod that uses a plasma core as its primary component (overloaded Plasma Core....treat it like the unholy offspring of a Nuka-Nade and a Plasma Nade)  
---
And then...options:  
---
I want more options for the grenade launcher (perhaps launching actual grenades (timed detonation) instead of impact ones?  Or an upgrade to nuka-nades (dmg, radius), or fragmentation ammo (piercing, reduced explosion radius)).  More options for missiles please (Different types of missiles, different ranges, different damage amounts....why can't I stick a Nuka-Nade as the payload for a missile and then launch that!!!!).  Stuff like that.
---
What if they just got rid of all the crap useless weapons currently in the game? 
---
Anecdotal, for sure... but:
---
Every nice, generous, mature player I have encountered in this game has emoted their way through interactions with me, and has been a joy to encounter.
---
Every. Single. Player. with a mic has been a foul-mouthed, racist, troll. Without fail. And their king has to have been the 14-15 year old kid that followed me around repeating "if you can hear me, pick  up the (insert random item here)" and when I still refused to do what he asked for the 30th time, he began with the "Pick up the f*ckin (item) you g*ddamned f*cking N***er."
---
So yeah, I'm gonna say thats o far... emotes are where it's at.
---
Besides, they give the game a cool "feel". If I wanna hear bratty incels yelling racist busllshit, i can play any number of other games.
---
Gillman Lumbermill south of V 76.
---
Just saw your were on XboX RIP i'm PC :(
---
Oh yeah, it definitely works that way too, I’m just a bit irritated that I basically can’t do ranged with cover when I’m suddenly getting blasted at a range by the head laser, and the only way to the Assaultron is to go around a trench and up a staircase because of the railing in the way. If I meet them head on its no problems usually.

I agree, so take down-votes during the first 12 hours with a grain of salt.
---
No worries.
---
I can start building treehouses with those wood armor pieces. 
---
I think the values (atleast for the purpose of two shot) were a bit extreme.
---
TSE was a nice and strong combo on most guns. Practically the only way to make any sort of energy weapon viable currently. The issue was TSE shotguns, where each pellet got boosted. And in reality that issue was just the explosive legendary's interaction with shotguns.
---
While it's good for the health of the game to tone down TSE. The 'nerf' should have been in the Explosive area. As well as making sure shotguns in particularly were toned down by the changes. As it stands no one wants a TS weapon anymore due to the 25% value. 
---
I think 50-75% on TS would have been the right call. 25% was too much of a dip for healthy balance.
---
And now my dreams are shattered, wiping away tears of disappointment I will crawl back to my camp and craft glue :(
---
Here is what I do. Take a screenshot of the people in your server. Move both alts to the same location (a secluded train station works best). Deposit whatever you're trying to transfer into a suitcase. Rejoin server with another character and retrieve the loot.
---
Chickenshit commie tactics
---
Do Gamma Guns heal the ghouls? I've got an Instigating Gamma Gun and it'd be fun to keep healing them while destroying their turrets with it.
---
If you take butchers bounty while farming you collect about 1/3 more tick blood when searching them after you kill them, just dont let them explode. Use a quick melee weapon for best results IMO.
---
and a suppressor please!
---
Come on out... we have chocolate. 
---
We're discussing some different options on what to do for the Whitespring CAMPs internally. I know that doesn't exactly help you right *now*, but know we're aware players are doing this and are working to address it.
---
Virtue, as clean and glowingly white as Swan's wing O.o
---
The shit's going to hit the fan with a schreech..
---
I'm finishing off the rations in here. You'd be surprised how many people walk by useful shit. (My game has 10 more GB to download, and I'm cooking KFC rn)
---
You think your report is going to jump the hundreds ahead of it?
---
Lolz
---
Great story shame you couldn’t share his GT
---
You lose caps when you die? I thought that’s when you did to real players only. 
---
When did this come to the store? Just today?
---
Cheers to u/Nathan_TK(the guy in the clown outfit) for introducing me to this game a while back.
---
May we continue to ride through Appalachia and slaughter more dragon bats for months or years to come.
---
Bump 
---
A suppressed 10smg!
---
I just want the heavys and flamer to be balanced before they add anything in.
---
Seriously they're still so underpowered 
---

You've reported it, move on and play the game, the world is full of dicks, the anonymity of the internet inc games brings them to the surface like sewerage scum.
---
Fort Defiance, the colored ones have a small chance to spawn in place of the weathered/dirty ones
---
use the vendors, and set the things you wish to trade at the same cap values.
---
Wow. That's actually awesome that there is even discussion about this. I kinda thought it was one of those things that was within the rules so people just had to deal with it. Ooc is there also talk about the CAMPs near the queen? Though this one isn't a nuisance to players it does allow CAMPs to assist in taking her down.
---
"We're all mad down here!"  
---
Also that's me in the clown outfit, Nathan was wearing the bag on his head XD
---
You talking about marine tactical helmet? Those are legit. Not the one we are talking about
---
Oh man if only this was tomorrow lol.
---
they do, I read a reply not long ago that said they do just that, heal the ghouls with the gamma gun until the base is leveled
---
ive gotten most of my armor farming the high-level areas like whitespring or outside of watoga..sometimes i get so many legendary items that i dont realize i have them in my inventory until a few days later..i will say to myself when did i get this? lol
---
I believe they put it on a curve so higher health is less damage than prepatch, low health is about the same or a tiny bit higher.  Someone should tell Bethesda they are doing a great job of communicating stealth nerfs and balancing adjustments.  I think the new table is in the post about the data changes that someone puts up every patch.
---
There's a shack SW of Harper's Ferry, not too far from a river, that has a bunch of them. If you know where The Mire Treasure Map #2 leads (should be able to find it online), it's just a bit north of there.
---
Thank you for the reply, i guess this is not an option for me since my computer is no way close to your XD.
---
i guess i will just keep bothering the few friends i have left playing until bethsda implement something to solve this.
---
btw can you tell your youtube channel name,You definitely earned my sub with your reply.
---
Thanks again
---
Well if no one hits me up while I’m on today - I’ll update this post to let ya know. :) 
---
Ah fuck, forgot about that XD
---
Thank you! Do you know what part of it? Are they just sitting in rooms?
---
Thanks! ;)
---
I heard that this no longer works. I tried it recently against normal ghouls and it had no effect, I haven't tried it against glowing ghouls.
---
I want one that sells things.
---
How is this game still riddled with bugs and how do you decency to call it "good"?  
---
Asking for a friend. 
---
I haven't been too lucky at Whitesprings, as all I've gotten a 1\* legendaries without the desired effects. The best I've gotten is a TS crossbow but crossbows are terrible. :P
---
Same, need Torso and Arms... have Caps...  Xbox
---
Defiantly get the perk cards Fortune Finder - (Perception) and Cap Collector - (Luck). You will find all kinds of stashes that you'd never see...I almost made 400 caps at the  Eastern Regional Penitentiary off stash boxes that I 100% missed the first time I went there.
---
### 
---
The one thing I want to see removed is the Stalker legendary effect for melee
---
all over should be a walk in the park, don't bother with weapons.
---
 How the fuck does one prove a negative?  - You might not need to if you stopped making baseless assumptions.   
---
 If I hear **nothing** from Bethesda, and get downvotes when I mention it, what the hell am I supposed to think?  - The downvotes are inconsequential in this context and are probably a result of how ignorant you come across.   
---
 If they mention they are fixing one atom shop thing, they should be really fixing the other busted atom shop things.  - and they probably are. What makes you think they aren't?  Because they didn't mention it in a post that specifically asks about a completely different item?   
---
Oh you mean raider can be found at lvl 25? I didn't know that
---
OK
---
By the way; healing factor doesn't work in combat and reduces the health you get from healing items. (Food and medicine.)
---
Just want you to be aware before you grab it. However outside of combat it's great for restoring lost health from a previous fight.
---
Just start a vegetable starch farm.  Corn, mutfruit, tatos.  Those plus purified water makes vegetable starch which scraps for adhesive.i sold 5 bulk off just a few mins ago and I’ll have 100 more before tonight’s over.
---
Oh thanks for the catch, it was a typo. Meant Fallout 3
---
What lmao
---
sounds pretty trustworthy. will leave armor at home, too.
---
I'm sorry that happened to you. Bethesda really needs to get that PVP server crap going, and let those of us that don't want to be ganged up on have our own servers.   
---
I was gang murdered a few weeks ago. Ran into a group of guys, did the "Hi!" emote, they did the "Angry" emote and then shot me over and over. I tried just walking away and they followed me until I was dead. It's pretty messed up that people like this are supported in the game. It's like, if you get your joy out of killing people WAY lower level then you, there's something wrong with you.  
---
I'm all for "Raider"  characters, but stick to your own level players. There's no way a person that's a level 100+ should feel good about gunning down a level 30 character. Literally no way to fight back? You're not being a Raider, you're being a classless dick.
---
Cool. This isn't regarding a mod application but I would like to message you about another issue if you don't mind.
---
And let us name our guns again. I can't get as attatched to them in 76.
---
I’ve got it now so that when I first enter, I will stand completely still for 30 seconds to a minute and that eliminates the freezing on the pip boy screen. And as far as enemies go, the main thing that pisses me off is when I kill a boss level enemy, of any sort, and as I walk up excited the damn thing turns invisible and just leaves a blood stain!
---
Oh my gosh, I would repair stuff just to listen to it.
---
But if they introduce the .22 pistol they'll have to nerf everything else again, so what would be the point?
---
Or just combat armor.  or any armor.....  This is why we miss raiders and the Gunners... a chance to reliably find armor.  Since we need it more than ever to scrap for mods.
---
These plans do exist in the wild still, and can be found in the Cranberry Bog at fixed plan locations as well as the Toxic Valley. They're significantly more rare than they once were, though, due to being inadvertently removed from vendors.
---
Pulled from our [Known Issues and Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) list;

&gt; **STATUS:** We’re rebalancing multiple Heavy Weapon types to improve their utility. We’ll update you on timing for this patch as soon as we have it. 
---
Psn, he is on playstation.
---
Ye, shame indeed. I see him around these forums every now and then. I have a feeling he will smoke himself out.
---
Out of curiosity, what are you running? I think you could pull it off with low settings on a 1080 or 1080 ti. Maybe even a 1070.
---
Here's my channel https://www.youtube.com/c/thewandererplays , but please don't feel obligated, I'm not here to be a shill and I hate that behavior. I just know if I don't say it, someone will be like "Dude, you bought a 2080 TI? So overpriced, should have bought ___, that's all you need for gaming", but people don't complain when they know it's for streaming / making videos.
---
Not sure if the this has been cha he'd but the pipe pistol with a stock on it counts both rifles and pistol perk all together so it should do that vest damage per second. But not sure if this was patched. Worth checking out
---
And just unarmed weapons with more than one mod.
---
Ahahah I HEARD that when I saw the image!
---
The link doesn't work for the pics. Can you repost?
---
Don't buy plans from Vendors until you have a nestegg. Find stuff other players want, and sell it to them. When you see a nuke Zone, go in there and harvest ALL OF THE PLANTS. Easy caps without lugging heavy crap all over. 
---
This is so cute!
---
Somewhere in the 3rd floor if you can access the elevator
---
I want mail boxes that you can use to send specific items to players and other characters. It could use caps as “postage fees” for delivering items. 
---
Behold the power of Atom!
---
it should be a hunger games with some kind of legendary items that CANNOT BE WIELDED FOREVER, when they break (or get claimed by another player who takes you out, a king of the hill aesthetic needs to exist here both about locations and about the ones who have managed to claim the rare loot), you need to gather a new one or the right materials that can only spawn in legendary locations with a chance to spawn an actual weapon but usually just components for repairing, bottom line is that the players will encounter each other at the locations where the rare things spawn that everyone wants, Karma system will set apart neutral, raider type, or vigilante against raider type, with specific benefits and drawbacks to any of these 3 pseudo factions (delineating who is fighting who and why, the Bounty mechanic simply won't work for this kind of mode)
---
Yes please! I saved mine, had 8 mini nukes, took it to my first solo Scorchbeast fight, and it did squat. Barley damaged it and I had to take it down via small arms fire and a fire axe. Great fight, but damn I though the Fatman would be a lot more help. 
---
I wish you the best of luck.

P.S. There's no santa.

Dolly Sods campground has a bunch. But beware of Yao Guai and Fog Crawlers
---
I always leave fertilizer, I think the message is pretty clear.
---
You can get several it's max level is 45 I believe
---
Then again, that's why the karma system is gr8. It does say alot in a way. Otherwise, the story would have been a "i have been scammed post". Lol
---
Now we're talking. This is great. Edited the post.
---
I will have to give that a try from now on. It’s almost like I’m making it think too hard when I first spawn! 
---
I have my CAMP on the green of one of the holes further down the hill from the clubhouse. I'm just hoping that the solution won't be to just make the entire golf course a no-build zone lol
---
Ok so it’s only 3rd floor
---
I'm more likely to have spoiled meat on me, but that works too!
---
i kill him easily with any gun i have, whether its BE handmade, EE 10mm sub, TSE Combat, whatever. people overrated how difficult these guys are to kill. they are just a nuisance due to how much damage they deal, so fire from cover if you aren't in PA. you know, like you'd do in a real gunfight
---
Alright! Thanks
---
I love the look and size of my 10mm long barrel and suppressor. That shit practically drags on the ground while sprinting.
---
My new method is just to crouch by the poolside window and repeatedly draw aggro.  The ghouls won't usually go into the lower corridor which is where these camp mostly are designed to shoot.
---
Couple of days ago I did that and the team that was CAMP farming came over and tried to slap damage me to death with  TSE shotties. I hit them repeatedly with the taunt emote and then ignored them.  
---
they eventually server hoped but not before nuking Whitespring as revenge (?)  - Hey free legendaries for everyone!
---
TIL why some assholes have been breaking the gen in my open plan camp, despite the camp being placed 3x the turret range away, out of direct sight of, and literally rotated on it's side facing away from the golf club 👍
---
How can colonel gutsy kick my ass when he has no legs!?!?
---
I'm not sure if there's any conversations on CAMPS near the Queen. If it comes up more often I can take a deeper dive looking into it, but as far as I'm aware it's not a big discussion with players.
---
Unless somehow these new craftable only guns are competitive with legendary weapons no one would buy them outside a small niche who just want to look cool.
---
Personally I really don't like a system where you are at the mercy of an RNG system with massive odds against getting what you might actually want.  
---
Regardless if it's plans only or new guns just added into the loot tables and enemy spawns, I want a way to earn specific items even if that means a massive grind so long as at the end I'll wind up with what I want.
---
Yup, lots of them are event exclusive ones, I saw a list here on reddit back in December, it was not complete but it had a good start to it! 
---
You were chosen as an inhabitant of Vault 76 because of your brilliant mind and you have a responsibility to fulfil. Not gonna lie, the world out here is dangerous and at time you're going to feel like you're living day-to-day. Hand-to-mouth. But we're living and that's really the whole point of this Holotape. Life outside the Vault; THAT is living. You're just killing time in there. Don't give in to the fear. You're either gonna die alone in there without meeting your lifes true potential or you're gonna die out here a hero, trying. Don't be a coward. Take the big step. Take a leap. We're here for you man.     
---
P.s. please bring rations out with you. I miss MREs and I'm tired of eating Molerats and Mac &amp; Cheese.
---
I love my daisycutter - even if I kill myself with it 5 times out of 10.
---
We need M16s in the game with short barrel and double drum magazines as mods. That way we actually have The Patriot in a way. 
---
Did all my treasure maps in the bog and Savaged divide last night, a lot of nice PA plans, but not a sign of any BoS plans :/
---
Do you have any known spawn points ? the train car outside watoga train station only seem to spawn marin and linings plans, tested for a week :/
---
Same goes for the transit station and drop site 2..
---
Clearly you don't know any actual colonels.  Now if it was a chief warrant officer oh, that's a scary thing.
---
I JUST got a 2 shot fatman last night farming. I can't wait to find one of those bases. I'm saving up my mininukes just for this.
---
It’s funny how folks here are so quick to yell victim when they could’ve easily avoided by asking questions and googling
---
Upvoting your post because you care about your game UX.
---
I want my Ballistic Fist. 
---
All the Girls are Guys. It's like the internet but irl
---
Using current "scrap to learn Mods" method, and Legendary Loot table drop mechanics adding these weapons to the game will add, "uses calculator" 2.45 bajillion years to the game. Nice. 
---
Giant rubber dildo for my melee character?
---
If I know I'm going to be involved in some PvP, I stash all but a few fertilizer, so even if I lose, they get crap.
---
Are u on ps4?
---
Yes, it's available in level 15, 25, 35, &amp; 45 versions. 
---
not being PC does not give you the right you to be racist. 
---
Dude... it’s Fallout. 90% of the technology in universe is fictional. That model of 10mm SMG doesn’t exist in real life; so there is nothing stopping it from having an equally fictional drum magazine. 
---
Different events, miscellaneous quests. 
---
I don't think players mind it. I was just curious if the whitesprings CAMP was part of a bigger discussion.
---
You know as a kid we used to do burning bags of poop for devils night!
---
All that SBQ Guano, id like to leave that as a present for some griefers
---
My strategy so far is basically this (many of the legendary farmers use similar)....
---
- Always hunt the right hand side of the map
---
- Anywhere instanced (you need to load in) is potentially gold. Many of these areas have a 3*, and since they're small it can be farmed fast.
---
- Always (ALWAYS) do AWOL Armaments and One Violent Night events
---
- Always do Horde events - location does not matter. Low level gear can be absolutely incredible. Case in point - I love my level 5 TSE shotgun. Rather, my alts do. Thing is worth a fortune. But it's mine :P
---
- Whitesprings is a trap. Yes, it's bugged to hell and you can respawn the ghouls in the clubhouse infinitely, but 1* are worth less than nothing and you'll do 100 runs before you see a 3* mob.
---
- Some outdoor areas are OK to farm, but not many - you'll need to go where nobody else does. Examples include Gulper Hollow, Big Maw and similar areas, but I have had limited success and generally don't bother anymore. Reasonable routes are from the BOS vendor in Watoga to the train station - you might get lucky with a 3*, but it's rare. I just run it as part of my route and don't stop for non-2*-3* mobs.
---
- Some events actively work against you. An example is Monster Mash in Watoga High School. Don't bother. Server hop or wait til it's over - a non-monster-mash run is always better.
---
- Deathclaws got nerfed, and I haven't seen a legendary one in weeks. Abandoned Waste Dump, power station north of Watoga are not worth bothering with.
---
Some areas I farm in my route are: Watoga High School (non-monster-mash), Watoga Emergency Services, AMS HQ (Watoga), West-Tek (this one most of all), Spring Grove (rare legendaries but springs!), RobCo Research (lots of Colonel Gutsies, so be careful).
---
I farm some others as well which I'd prefer not to post, but here's one last tip:
---
- They respawn after about 30 mins or so, and if you hit a 3* the first time round in an area, it's VERY likely (certain? Not sure) that you will get a 3* on subsequent runs. So make a route, make it last 30 mins, and hope for the golden map. I do this all the time starting with one place. If it's a 3*, I continue, if not, I server hop.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Yeah! Knowing Bethesda, it'd cost a couple caps per item, but I guess that'd balance it. I have two characters, one of which has an item I'd like the other to have. 
---
Explore.
---
All i want is the m16 from nv
---
&gt;But at the same time, baseline 76 *is* something of a casual game. ... When Survival and perhaps Nuclear Winter come around, it will offer more for those who want a hardcore experience.  But I don't think it's a stretch to say that I, and many others, turn to 76 as a game for vegging out.  
---
Agreed entirely. I agree that the game could certainly be more difficult, but I don't want to have that forced on me. What if I just want to get smashed one night and have some fun in Appalachia? Obviously if everything is killing me left and right I'm not gonna have a lot of fun. I think Survival mode will help that immensely. 
---
Is be happy if everything hit like a truck. I hate unloading 70+ rounds into the face of one singular super mutant to kill them. It changes it from "gunfight" to "boring resource tax" when they just slowly advance, eating all the damage, and eventually step up and whack me in the head.
---
U on ps4?
---
Thanks was wondering whether they were worth it:)
---
The 3rd floor has been the placr where they were accurately seen, on top of the beds and in the bathroom but might as well explore every room. Happy hunting, wastelander
---
At that level be sure you've cleared the ash heap and toxic Valley. Then I would start doing the raider quest line 
---
can we just get something for scrapping the dozens of duplicates we have when we already have a full set at max value?
---
Your power armor is bad @$$!
---
Wait you can wear leather under pa?
---
Wait what?? Like...the horsemen of the apocalypse? Fuck I need those. Damn
---
You're not wrong!
---
Okay thanks I’ll look into the raider quest line
---
Lol! 
---
Not actual friends then, just online ones?
---
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes.
---
Thank you lots! I appreciate it
---
seems the other two are broke this week since the holotape says "..." 
---
Starts at the top of the world in the middle of the map. Happy hunting! 
---
when I find one of my weapons near the 100% point, and I want to top it off, I just bash something with it a few times, robots are great for this.
---
Seems like a silly answer, but if your goal is XP the fastest option is to **kill enemies**, particularly super mutants. That's about the best xp there is. 
---
I actually just installed it from disc last night, and as i recall the initial install was about 9 gigs followed by another 9ish gig update
---
I’d appreciate that mate. Currently at work now unfortunately. Working in Milwaukee.   
---
Wow!! I need to get on that! Thank you dude. I’m currently working but may be able to open my laptop up for some grinding 
---
PC
---
vendors reset their caps about 20 to 24 hours after you first dip them below 200 caps.
---
vendors of the same factions share a cap pool (and the watoga station bot and graham share a cap pool)
---
I'm more interested in weapon variety than finding specific weapons. Also buffing base weapon stats will make using them much more viable. 
---
Moving my camp will actually help alot, thank you :)
---
I know that. So he should HAVE ENOUGH caps right now.
---
Ye, you gotta use whatever resource you got when you want to trade in this game. I only trade on reddit, because I trust the karma system. Hence, I would have been scammed.
---
I don't use the discord chat for trades. Those are loaded with dupers and scammers. I always see players saying they get scammed etc. In the discord chat. I dropped out when I saw a few of them pop up.
---
Bethesda could polish the trade system. Like have a proper trade item for item kind of thing. At least allow us to inspect perks.
---
So when you go to fort defiant take the elevator to the 3rd floor then exit left go to the end of the hall the rooms on both sides have a chance to spawn colored uniforms. I’ve spent a lot of time there farmings also the yellow,red and forest have the lowest spawn rates better drop chance from events for those
---
The Gorge Junkyard often has 3 or 4. 
---
The hats are all over the fort
---
Sometimes you have to sell an item to update the caps. If he still has 0 caps, item doesn't get sold. If he has caps and it just displays 0, it will sell the item and update the cap display.
---
Was it 0? Because sometimes it shows zero but it is actually 200. The vendors reset every 24 hours so there is no reason you shouldn't be able to trade with him.
---
This reminds me of an episode of jojo’s bizarre adventure. 
---
OP:”I knew you wouldn’t drop the item. Now you’re gonna say ‘you tried to scam me’”
---
“You tried to scam me!”
---
(Surprised look on his face)
---
its like 57 gigs
---
Yeah except i paid 80 dollars for this game that apparently is going to free to play and they havent offered me so much as a sorry for the fact that i paid entirely too much for the content they delivered. So i feel justified to ask exactly what is going on. Is there a plan or just a series of knee jerk reactions? Im not saying that they should do one thing or another, im just perplexed by the fact that they made everything "too good" and would need to nerf it to balance it. They can also balance with buffs which they did for automatic weapons. 
---
Please, this. You know we're just going to give items to a friend to swap it to the character whose build it suits anyway. It shouldn't require a second person to just swap a few items back and forth.
---
Yeah I rebuilt the cores as that seemed the easy thing to do. Where do I buy this born survivor perk? Or do you mean invest as in pick it when you rank up? 
---
I am interested in a jet pack for T-51b.
---
Sh-sh-shaw!
---
Like an eBay 3rd party escrow system ingame?
---
excellent! make lots of noise too... walk right in and OWN the place 
---
The game remembers you have equipped them but they have no effect, nor do the underarmor and overarmor have any effect. Still, they *may* indicate a preference for the loot drop system, if such thing is in the game - which we don't know.
---
Inside RobCo.  Lots of desks, usually find a few.  Lots of fans and typewriters to for screws.
---
Full game size on HDD? Or is that the initial download?
---
You can still buy some of the TSE shotguns and levers for under 3k because they were so heavily duped.   Then, as noted above, do Mayor for a Day post level 50 and get All Rise.  And you’ll have everything you need for a long, long time.  
---
What's the general consensus of people's opinions on the perk-card system as opposed to the pre-Fallout 4 perk system?
---
New here and never played 4 so I missed this discussion.
---
That hazmat suit is blasphemy. Kill the heretic!
---
Your sheet has pleasant valley station listed twice, row 379 and 411.
---
Maybe they could just limit PVP to the workshops.   Leave wrecking peoples' camps to the survival mode crap.
---
Trust me, this dude was a masterpiece lol. Like a character straight out of borderlands.
---
It's simple; everyone who builds at white springs has to pay a tax, to be collected by a dapper yet very ghoulified tax collector.  A troll toll if you will.  They gotta pay the troll toll to get in.
---
dont listen to these people lol. The 3 star legendaries are only worth what people will pay for them. Sure i Have seen people trying to get 5-10k out of weight reduction tses and some deathclaw gauntlets, but I personally have never spent more than 3k for a weapon, and I have 5 different 3 stars. 
---
They should just make the autonomous PAs from the Creation Club into enemies
---
Trading needs double authentication( agree to trade and when all the items are placed and zeroed out and locked in, agree to the trade again), this is exactly why I never trade unless I don't care if I get scammed.
---
The answer is Lockpicking and Hacking are only single level cards so that they could space out the level requirements, and make it so that you could only get access to certain areas after reaching a high enough level.
---
And I'm trying to sell. When I click on sell. the literal Notification Message:
---
Vendor does not have enough caps.
---
Shows in the top left.
---
No, Vendor does not have enough caps is the notification message when trying to sell.
---
While I would love new weapons, I would prefer having many more mods for existing weapons. FO4 weapons and some new ones like the pump-pump-action are fine as is, but many weapons like the single action revolver, crossbow, LMG, .50cal, instrument weapons, black powder, etc have basically no mods. There needs to be many more mods, especially ones that either increase damage on weapons that don't have mods like hardened, or ones that change their classification or how they're used. In that sense, the ballistic fist mod for the power fist is a great example of this, or maybe one that makes the 10mm SMG function as a one handed weapon like it did in FO3/NV, or a gamma gun mod that makes it fire EMP that shreds robots like the pulse gun you mentioned. Or make the crossbows fire different bolts similar to the stringer that have differing effects. Or have a blank receiver for the pump action that does much less damage but knocks enemies down. Or have a breeder receiver for the laser/ultracite laser gun that does less damage but uses a recharging source of ammo separate from cells. The devs should get more creative with the weapons they already have in the game, rather than bloating the pool with other weapons with almost no mods.
---
I never used eBay for this game,
---
But I could imagine it would be like an option to allow items to be part of a trade.
---
So say I can put items and caps in the trade screen with an approval button.
---
He sees what I have and I see what he has in the trading screen.
---
The trade doesn't happen until we both click approve.
---
That's what I did after running around trying to find them for 20 mins. Ha. First solo run with no spoilers it was fun. Ah sorry yeah it's a perk in agility I think. Like ur auto stim gear or emergency protocols. Injects a stimpack when u get a certain level of health like 20%. And the first aid perk in intelligence improves the effectiveness of stimpacks upto a max of an extra 45% 
---
Sure, but doesn't change the fact that all perk levels having their own cards is the best fix to this leveling card mix. Especially when they nerf cards so often.
---
That's a new one to me.  Sorry i can't help. 
---
I want a gun that shoots melee weapons as my tse is poop 😀
---
The most fun I had in this game was when someone had their camp set up outside the clubhouse and he and his friends were pulling the mobs over. I joined in and we all made sure everyone got a hit on everything (as much as we could; sometimes there were a LOT of ghouls)
---
It was great having his camp right there for me to break down stuff or use the stash or whatever. 
---
I've never placed my camp there because I like it where it is, but I've never had an issue with anyone else's camp being there. It would be a bit of a waste to just leave it and the turrets kill stuff without anyone there to tag the monsters, I guess. But I always assumed there was a good respawn rate.
---
stupid question, but are you absolutely sure that enough time has passed? I signed in thinking I would be able to sell before but my timing was off and had to wait another hour.
---
Exactly. Most mmo games that allow trading are like this. 
---
It works perfectly.
---
I would love to see the return of weapons from Fallout 1&amp;2.  There's a lot of high quality stuff there that has been unfortunately left in past.
---
Please just don't do something like disallow building there. Just disallow turrets within that area. That's all it would take 
---
Do you legit like it?  If so please explain your perspective - I want to understand.
---
Why would there be problems? It's probably more for balance reasons. Not to mention getting rid of oddly high numbers
---
Players using other players to do it seems more in line with how it should be. I just feel it can be an unfair advantage, to say a new a player or a player who actually likes the challenge of an rpg and is not constantly looking for ways to make it easier. Be it, duping, server hopping, trading duped items, etc.
---
  Because really a lot of these posts on here are just about making fo76 easier. And I am not going to answer the rest I am pretty sure you can figure out how it could.be an unfair advantage game breaking to share seamlessly between characters 
---
Pocket sand
---
Which ones do you have, if you don't mind me asking?
---
This^ find an area with good mob concentration, clear it, scrap loot,  server hop.
---
OR: take over a couple workshops and just keep doing defend events.  Good xp and lots of plans. 
---
I’ll give that a go dude, thank you! 
---
If youd like you can look through my weapons and I will help you out, send me your Gamertag and I will be online within an hour
---
You’ve already created artillery as a remedial option.  
---
Thank you for all will do a grind
---
I’m PC, thank you never the less mate. 
---
Perfect.
---
Atoms glow!! Great shot :)
---
Thanks for this! What's your opinion of nuked Whitesprings, keeping in mind that I can nuke it, then clear it over and over for 4-5 hours by keeping my 2nd account logged onto that server? And keeping in mind that 3 star ghouls are more common there. Am I still better off doing a route like that? Do the ghouls there (even the 3 star bloated glowing ones) just have that bad of a chance of dropping a 3 star legendary?
---
bloodied explosive handmade (forgot third perk), furious weight reduced grox axe, bloodied weight reduced mr handy buzz blade, Prime TSE handmade (Ultracite shells) Prime TSE Shotgun (Ultracite shells) 
---
I attack higher levels on my alt. Mostly just for fun. I figure they are either bored and being helpful or bored and up to no good. It gives them a reason not to be bored. 
---
Lmao. Noted! I do loads of pvp, and this is going to be really creative if I lose.
---
what lvl are you? past lvl 50 levels just tell you how many caps you will lose in pvp.
---
if you killed that "lvl" 256 you would have gotten 256 his/her caps if my understanding of pvp is right.
---
Or fertilizer.  Because it's the closest thing to poo
---
Thank you! I’ll take all information. Also, I picked up a lot of military ammo bags on my first run. Now, I don’t really find any. Is that the same for the hats? Should I not be picking up the whithered ones because it might make it impossible for the colored ones to spawn later? Or will have to wait a couple days until I get those items to spawn again? Is that how item spawning works in this game?
---
What lvl are you? After around lvl 70 most people have the build they want anyways so there’s not too big of a difference in lvls after that
---
Moonshiners Shack and Gillman Lumbermill are both close to Vault 76 and always have ticks :)
---
This was happening with supermutants and frag grenades awhile ago but they resolved it.   I think it’s just a visual bug. 
---
I won't be on for another four hours, sadly. However, here is my GT: GuineaPirata. If you're on then, we can chat further.
---
I spent 2,000 caps for a 1\* quad double-barrel shotgun on PC. It's not the most powerful thing out there, but it's a ton of fun and it's less than two-days worth of vendor caps. It was a big upgrade over my previous non-legendary modded pump. 
---
At least with shotguns, you have options if you're not picky between double-barrel, pump and combat. 
---
They are doing it because they want to pvp. People seem bored now a days when looking for pvp instead of using the hunter radio they look to see if someone has a workshop and start shit with them. 
---
No prob! I love talking this type of stuff...
---
IMO Assassin is only worth a full set if you have some pieces with multiple stars. Yes 40% dmg reduction from players is good, but you'll be missing out if you don't temper that with other stars like vanguards or bolstering. I've also heard of Sentinels, , but I've never seen it myself in game or on a friend.
---
For weapons in pvp, I think armor piercing is ok, but only as a supplementary star. The hardest hitting weapons tend to be bloodied, two shot, and explosive, but depending on your build there are some other strong pvp weapons as well. Armor piercing is nice, but even when I've had a lot it's not a game changer by itself. 
---
Yay! Thank you for trying to get stuff the community needs through to the devs. 
---
I just wish people would buy a freaking mic for their game.  I can't tell you how annoying it is for someone to wander up and start doing a bunch of emotes without context while I'm talking to them.
---
Stop harassing the players using camps at the whitespring golf club. It's fun to make a ghoul farming camp. I laugh and laugh hopping worlds while shooting up the whitespring golf club full of weirdo ghouls.
---
Will do.
---
This is my opinion too.  If they want to make enemies able to kill you easier then I'm all for it.  But players should do increased damage also.  It shouldn't be where everyone needs AAE or Bloodied build to be able to kill something without wasting 50 lead and steel in ammo. 
---
This is amazing 😍
---
I'd love to see a power armor gauntlet with mole miner blades welded to its wrist. Imagine how cool that would look. 
---
Thanks.
---
The gutsy, sentry, and assaultron all do. The rest do not. 
---
Also the front sight needs to be added as well as more sight options in general.
---
What do you play on? If I get an extra fat man, it’s yours. 
---
Gutsy robots are too powerful with their ballistic weapons and have broken defenses.  IF they're using lasers, they're basically a non-issue, but their .44 or whatever is deadly powerful.  I still don't understand why Fallout 4 changed their plasma gun to a damn ballistic weapon from Fallout 3.  It's silly.
---
Frankly, what needs to change is their defense.  They can be powerful, but they should not possess 110 ballistic defence, and 100 energy defence.
---
They're fucking robots, their energy defence should be half of that, maybe even less.  Give them, and all robots a strong energy damage weakness, and suddenly the prospect of using energy weapons isn't so bad anymore.
---
It's ridiculous that energy defence is so high when metal armor is explicitly mentioned to not protect against lasers and energy weapons so much.
---
Aaahhh This post is so wholesome and wonderful! This brings tears to my eyes, I am so happy you found such a great friend with Fallout 76. I hope you're doing better, and thank you to u/oldirtypunk for being such a great friend to u/bamalambambi :) Friendships like these are hard to come by!
---
Level means nothing after level 50, so whether a level 50 or a level 256 takes it from you, the result will be the same. Only thing is if you have more damage than him and hard to tell who has TSE's, what perks they have. A level 40 with the right perks could clap you ass just as easy, don't under estimate a good build with the right cards.
---
Don't spent a lot of time setting up a workshop, make blueprints of any builds or things, for instance I have a blue print of 8 water pumps and a fusion reactor, I just plop it down in 2 seconds. If someone walks in, don't fight or waste caps, as soon as somebody contests your workshop, don't wait for the contest to finish , leave immediately and change worlds so you don't lose any caps, because as soon as they contest is finished he is going to shoot you and take your caps. 
---
If you into pvp, go ahead and enjoy the fight, if you like most of us, just change worlds and take the same workshop in a different world and hope it doesn't get taken. Also take a lessor likely workshop, if you going to take a popular one like the landfill, Jorge's junkyard to ammo factory, people are going to take them.
---
if someone takes my workshop, I just switch worlds asap, so they get nothing from me .. I have lost caps before and learned my lessons .. I rather be a wimp and keep my caps
---
I haven't seen that personally (and there's probably at least a few online games I don't play :P ), but I can see some of them going that far.  I personally would make a more neutral statement, but what you saw is probably still safe.
---
Lol tru dat
---
Every set of raider armor I ever found was too high level for me to wear. I had to settle for T-51
---
He means people whining.
---
 It wouldn't be a problem if it told me who is trying to claim it.  I guess vulgarity was more important to you than reading comprehension. 
---
This is a great suggestion, thanks for posting!
---
You can build in such a way to have a camp help with the queen fight.  
---
The turrets won't survive though.
---
This case doesn't bother me and I would leave your camp alone. However, having a camp in a highly trafficked area makes it an easy target for trolls and people looking to get a large bounty to bait with.
---
Equal chances of a 3* legendary item from any 3* legendary mob, so nuked WS is absolutely a profitable run. If you're comboing that with logging back in to respawn them, using your mule as an anchor, this is probably as good as you can get in the game for farming. I have noticed though that the little cabins tend to spawn more 3* than the golf club - could be anecdotal.
---
I just personally find it extremely boring after about 20 minutes hehe.
---
That’s actually a smart move. Thanks for the tip. 
---
Yup! u/RabidBadger67 is correct. 
---
I have been noticing this. I have been wanting to use heavy weapons but i use up all my ammo before the weapon breaks and i kill less things than with my pipe pistol...
---
I play pc. But I come across them often enough that I can get one if I really want it. Thanks though! :)
---
Damn rip
---
Interesting info! Thank you :)
---
Yea I totally forgot about the different lvls. Just knew it was the earliest one to get but I had never found one in the wild a higher lvl till now
---
Does this mean the Bethesda plz list will actually be enforced now?
---
No problem at all :)
---
 Wallace had Heavy Combat Arms today, now I have legs and arms. Its very rare indeed.
---
Very cool to know- thanks again!
---
But they aren't wrong. F76 is bad. It is not bad because it is online game, it is bad because it was designed bad. 
---
Yup, here's the reddit post with images. The black rider is top of my wish list. It would be even better if there were going to be unique weapons available for each armor. I want a scythe for the black rider. 
---

---
I'd actually buy this one from the atom shop, as long as it came with an animation.
---
Honestly, either of the two 3D Fallout perk systems would be better.
---
New Vegas/3’s traits, skills, and perks were fun to use and definitely helped character progression. I didn’t like how a lot of the perks were hidden until I got the prerequisites, preventing me from working to them if I didn’t know them.
---
Fallout 4, even though a lot of the stuff was simplified did show everything pretty much. I knew the prerequisites for everything.
---
The perk cards are made for swapping imho. This keeps roleplaying minimized as swaps can occur at anytime. Plus, the system is way too random as for when I can get a perk. The cards even get crowded as I get too many card packs.
---
But they could just as easily space it out by only acquiring them at specific levels from card packs ie 15-20-25
---
Ah I'm one of those weirdos that can go for 10-12 hours farming no problem. What I've been doing is double dipping on the golf club with nuked WS. I get my 2 characters up there by the bus, run in with my main, aggro everything, sit behind the bar so nothing can hit me, tab over to alt, run in with my alt, tag all the ghouls, tab over to main, kill everything, loot, exit and rejoin to get load screen going, then loot everything on alt. I get double the legendaries AND I get to power level my alts, which I've been taking weight reduction perks on to increase their stash space, since you can only carry 1500 max weight, but that can be a lot if you take EVERY weight reduction perk.
---
What is this, a family reunion or something? 
---
I would grind literally any system they put in place to increase CAMP size.
---
I understand their reservations, server load, balance, etc but damnit I want it so bad!!
---
Happy tears are good! He's honestly such an amazing individual, helping me out through so much just by, well,*being there*. I'm honestly doing a lot better, thank you. Sure, it's going to take a while until I feel content, but I'm making myself realise that it's a series of milestones towards the finish line I need to reach, rather than only focusing on how far away that line may sometimes appear.
---
Thank you for being involved in such a great game, and my unexpected conduit towards a brilliant friendship.
---
wat
---
I think this will help explain why a slider will help: 
---
It sends a single command 
---
Create Stimpak: QTY 20, remove &lt;components from player inventory.&gt; 
---
Server sends back: Confirmed, Stimpak 20 add to &lt;current player inventory quantity of Stimpak&gt;
---
followed by a verification which then removes the build components.
---
instead of:
---
Create stimpak, remote &lt;assets required for crafting.&gt;
---
Server sends back: 
---
Confirmed, Stimpak. add to &lt;current player inventory quantity&gt;
---
remove assets. 
---
continue this until QTY of 20 is reached. Add in a perk like Super duper, and you are now also including an RNG queue for each individual item created instead of using a formula that would roll the dice once and generate the super duper quantity based on that. etc.
---
With each creation required to send updates to the world, master asset server that tracks all inventory between servers, player, etc. 
---
This is actually one way that duping was possible. Before the asset server could update the client with the confirm, remove asset from player inventory the client would crash. So the player would come back with their previous inventory since it was never confirmed that the "transaction" occurred, so it would hold onto it. However since part of the process already completed you'd encounter the server holding a duplicated item. 
---
Player position also is just an x,y and maybe z value that is updated unless all the players are within draw distance and then it would include animation information and character outfits/armor/weapons etc. And at that, it's only updated from all players when you hit the map feature, which is why you don't see people move in real time on the map. 
---
Does that make sense? 
---
Yeah I saw the table, I just didn’t dig into it...
---
No problem. Don't forget the construction perk card that reduces building costs also reduces repair costs.
---
No way, legendary drops would become so hard. There's no need for this amount of selection. I would like to see different ammo types receivers on the guns we so have though. 
---
The few times I've seen it there has been a team standing up on a platform with them repairing it constantly. But you're right, you have to dump a significant amount of resources into it to keep it going.
---
To the left of the thumbs down. It's the same message
---
Someone gave me a missile turret last night. That thing wasn't playing when a few super mutants headed towards my camp. It took them all out. I could only loot one though. Couldn't find the others. Lol. Maybe the efficacy of the missile turret depends on the PVE enemy. With my lower level enemies, it seems a step up and does the work of several low level turrets. I think it's a level 28. 
---
He also gave me a heavy machine gun turret. I still have two other regular ones. I had five turrets. Scraped three in order to build the missile and the heavy machine gun. So now have four total, with a little more available budget than I had before the upgrades. I do like my turrets as warning signals for PVE enemies approaching. Then I can stop crafting and run to my roof and see if I can get any shots in.
---
Damn. I want that war one.
---
Yeah agreed
---
Some of Atom's children cannot handle the glow and are allowed to scrub themselves of the glow periodically, the hazmat suit is accepted for these children of Atom.
---
It's a really good method, and I think you'll hit gold with it. The only real difference between your method and mine is that you're doing reliable quantity with immediate results, whereas I'm gambling on more consistent 3*s, but far less of them. I think both are equally viable, tbh, as we need to acknowledge that 80% of 3* items are crap too :)
---
Guess I just go for the thrill (yes, I'm sad :P) of a 3* drop :)
---
I could sell you 5 cores 50 Caps each. I’ll give you the highest I got to the lowest I got. I’ll just go farm some more no problem. The good thing about farming cores is that you can do it at any level. With two Xbox Ones and 2 Fallout 76 games I get twice the amount of storage and cores :)
---
Here is one of favourite you tubers who talks about his builds. One day I want a build like him for fun, he talks about what cards he uses [https://youtu.be/PVsj5E3tb9o](https://youtu.be/PVsj5E3tb9o)
---
I don't necessary like what he does, but he does it in good spirit .. but you can see how he drops people in PA, PA is actually worse for you.
---
That only makes sense,  i know i'm not going to scam someone,  people have trusted me to give me the item first then i pay them.   The one time i gave the item up first the other player was at max caps and had to buy a bunch of stuff off other players so he could take my caps from me.   I was a little nervous and very new to trading/buying.  It worked out in the end,  but took several minutes.   Seems like a huge oversight that you can't trade.  
---
Same can be said why can a lvl 55 kill a Lvl 155 easily .. its obvious the the lvl 55 had duped gear that survived the purge and is able to 1 shot said 155. The balance is just so out of wack .. Also have they nerfed melee yet.  I worked hard for the tse I have and it don't scratch anyone or anything anymore .. 3/4 of the damage erased. I am still trying hard I don't wanna change my build but appears like I am forever doomed ? any updates or perk advice someone has for still using the TSE weps?
---
Like 99% of Whitesprings camps are fine, you just have to do something about this ONE spot that for whatever reason doesn't have the same no-build radius around it as almost any other fast travel spot.
---
So, not perfect, but the versatility might be a good direction in a game less designed for multiple playthroughs and more designed for continuous development of one character?
---
Do you know if the auto grenade launcher is part of those?
---
My suggestions would be easy: make it show a green line if you have the perks like for regular grenades, and (if that is not yet the case) make it's area bigger if you have the perks.
---
It's a good weapon but currently to weak.
---
I need you in my life when I repair and build rebuild my CAMP. I usually forget that perk card until I’m 80% done with everything. Thanks! Tips for days. 
---
Ps - love the mothman 
---
You guys are missing the best thing to drop in the bag... salt!
---
Oooh... there's an idea... have the WhiteSpring robots attack any turrets placed within certain areas... but that's probably quite a bit of work...
---
Could we get burning bags of poop to leave or throw at griefers?
---
I may lose caps and mats but knowing I threw crap at some asshole just before I died doesn’t make me feel so bad
---
Both can be made to fire a projectile of sorts.(an energy/ice ball)
---
I had a TSE Tesla I found in a vendor 3 days before the nerf hit I used as a Shotgun on a melee build before passing it to a freinds energy charecter.
---
I meant the lawsuit comment, was not asking where the angry emote was :)
---
This is a game set in the aftermath of a nuclear war, with bodies everywhere, and we routinely as players bloow mobs into bloody chunks (see the Bloody Mess perk). 
---
Not to mention the word "Fuck" makes hundreds of appearances in notes and audio throughout the game.
---
You SERIOUSLY think that a middle finger emote IN A GAME LIKE THIS is lawsuit territory????
---
Get a life man, seriously.
---
Good point! 🤔
---
Im on xbox. I can make you a serum if you bring me the materials. Marsupial and Bird Bones go really well together.
---
Wait what? But who's that old guy who keeps visiting me at night for milk and cookies O\_o
---
Are scorched supposed to be intelligent? Or more feral and instinctive? They obviously know how to use weapons so they're at least 1 step above feral ghouls. If they are supposed to have more intellect why not have them armor up. Maybe more ragtag than a typical raider or what they had before the scorched disease killed them. More leathers in the forest, raider gear in the savage divide, power armor and heavier components in the cranberry bog. I think it would add more depth than just better ghouls. Soldiers and citizens that fell to the disease and are still trapped in what they were wearing and doing before.  Granted I am NO expert in modeling and design for video games. Although I already see soldier ghouls with combat armor so I know the effect is there.
---
Tl;dr heavier scorched sub bosses would be cool. 
---
I just put three walls and a doorway around that opening, with a single piece roof on top. Then the floors around it are my rooftop deck and sniping spot, if necessary. All except my lower level turret sit up on the "floor roof" as well. 
---
I downvoted you because this was a stupid post to make. You heard someone say something mean and you opened a ticket. There was literally zero reason to come here and make this post, doubly stupid is saying "Glad to see the fallout community promotes racism" because they downvoted your stupid irrelevant post. This isn't logical thinking, it's downright ridiculous.
---
&gt; Downvoting usually means you disagree with something.
---
Maybe one day you'll look back and go "wow, I can't believe I actually thought like that when I was younger", hopefully you do - because it's not how sane rational adults think. Again your post was pointless and downvotes aren't because people "promote racism". 
---
But if you can see what’s missing won’t you get angry if you don’t get what you want?
---
THIS is the correct answer. This game needs more mechanically interesting bosses, not bullet sponges with add spam and TERRIBLE loot design.
---
I wouldn't mind if BGS took a page out of Bungie's playbook and copied some of Destiny's more interesting bosses for 76's raid content.
---
I'd rather just be able to break them down. I have way too many cards to sort through as it is.
---
 There are 7 sets of 200 caps:
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
 Farming them efficiently is left as an exercise for the reader.
---
Im 55 in Texas.  superkill64 on xbox.
---
Sorry for the delay on this, I was waiting to over repair my set! I don't think i'm using any perks to boost anything. I do have Scaly Skin which adds 50 to BR/DR. Here's the stats when I'm at max health:
---
Standard condition:  
---
Chest 45/9
---
Arms &amp; Legs 22/6
---
My total = 358/258
---
Over Repaired:
---
Chest 63/9
---
Arms &amp; Legs 40/6
---
My total = 448/258
---
I don't think the DR actually matters in this case.  I'm pretty close to 400 myself.  Every shot directly depletes about 1/8th to 1/10th of my HP, and they usually shoot in pairs, so you can see how quickly things can go south when there's more than one of them.
---
You're my hero!! &lt;3
---
The way it was done was easiest way. You're describing an entirely new mechanism.
---
No, the last time I logged on was a couple days ago because I was only playing d3 and bdo this week
---
or trading duplicates for another card... I have a level 25 character and I have 6 Traveling pharmacy cards... why on earth at lv 25 do I need all three ranks of the same card... So I have rank 1,2,and 3 seperately because there was no use just having 3 extra rank 1 cards...
---
I'd like my split beam automatic laser pistol not to break after 3-4 clips...
---
Or the assaultron head not eating up all our ammo.
---
Maybe worry about the stuff that's been broken since day one first. 
---
Not within the same game, every now and then it wont boot certain games up in hdr, but restarting the game usually fixes it.
---
I'm gonna start building at all these sites, just because of the tone and condescension. 
---
Should've dropped a Screw along with one of those wooden toy blocks. Specifically, the letter "U" block.
---
Have you put points into luck?
---
I can personally confirm that I've found the BOS Torso plan from the train car outside Watoga Station since the patch when Bethesda removed the plans from vendors. I also traded with someone yesterday who claimed to have found BOS Legs somewhere else in the Cranberry Bog recently (they didn't say where).
---
The drop rates might be low, but you also have to realize that if you pick up the plan then it goes on cooldown for your character for 3 days.
---
Yea I guess if they tried something new it could reverse the sb screech to them flying around shitting on everyone
---
If you get nuked it'll still be destroyed. Otherwise it still works.
---
I totally saw a behemoth turned to scorched in front of my eyes.
---
I was at bog town and the behemoth was the enemy guarding the workshop,when a scorchbeast came. I just enjoyed the fight instead of wasting anmo.
---
But then almost at the end of the fight,the beast did the carpet attack and they inmediatly stopped fighting as the behemoth was now scorched.
---
Behemoth might be a powerfull but less refined fev creature.
---
I've brought it up at every turn, and have written tickets.  It's frustrating to get ignored.
---
But you know what?  It's fine.  If they don't fix it, it's not the end of the world.  I'm just going to refrain from buying any atoms outright, and only spend the ones that I get in-game.
---
I can't get too annoyed about free.  I'm over it.
---
With super mutants and the BOS in the game keeping it lore friendly would just be an excuse for Bethesda to be lazy at this point.
---
Yeah I just got my set as well, thanks for the follow up though!
---
 My first was level 30 too. Took a long time and I broke my Sledge and almost broke my Hunting Rifle. Finished her with a Bayonet. They are quite strong with the right perks and equipment. 
---
You should post his name. This will stop this from happening in this subreddit. We shouldn't witch hunt him but it would be good to know since I'm on here trading a lot. 
---
They are playing the Raider life as expected. Do you remember some of the letters and console entries by raiders in Fallout 4, killing or torturing those weaker than themselves is precisely what they would do and hunting in a gang is lore friendly.
---
Some of the Fallout 4 raider stories made me feel sick they were so violent, this is after all the Fallout universe.
---
If I come across such players I log, no questions, or die, my choice.
---
M rated game. Idgaf about your kids. 
---
If i were to trade a item for another item whats the safest way to do it?
---
I agree a buff fat man is much better than just a fat man, think about all the stuff he could do if he were buff. 
---
Not yet as of level 91. Haven't seen the cabinets plan (metal workshop cabinets) either. I went to every vendor (including every one in whitesprings and the bunker but not grahm because he was hiding) this morning and none carried either one.
---
This is why I carry a full set of troubleshooters armor in my inventory at all times.  It goes on as soon as I hear the gutsy, the assaultron, or the sentry bot.  It actually makes these guys pretty easy to beat.
---
Hmm
---
Tell him to search out CommunistRaptor I’ll hook him up
---
Yes I do think this is lawsuit territory. This has happened before. You might have been too young to know (I don't know you) but Left 4 Dead 2 had a cover art controversy with an offensive gesture and had to change it.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2#Controversies
---
Mario Kart also had a similar controversy and has censored offensive gestures.
---
https://gbatemp.net/threads/splatoon-girl-hand-gesture-removed-from-mario-kart-8-deluxe-deemed-offensive.470949/
---
Life is about seeing prior examples and trends and acting on that knowledge. IDK if you're telling me specifically to get a life or offended people. Either way, kinda douchey.
---
r/woooosh
---
This is why people want a middle finger emote.
---
Nobody wants to talk to you, they'd rather flip you off.
---
They were replying to themselves with "let me explain" so I'm a little weirded out.
---
Bump
---
They’re too scared to do hunter. So much easier to screw with someone you can bully then the ones you can’t 
---
I just bank the mats and server hop
---
Nah just a flag "you cannot place turrets near this location" would be enough 
---
That is just a poor excuse to not put a mic on. Let alone overly presumptuous of you.
---
I would love to see new weapons.  
---
But first I want to see energy weapons fixed, and mods for various weapons that currently only have 1, or can't be modded at all.  
---
I'm using a bloodied swing speed Bowie knife, but that is all it can ever be.  No spiked handle, no serrated blade, no poison tip...
---
Yes you can get legendary Powered Marine Armor. My chest piece is Powered Sentinel Assassin 
---
This would be a very cool idea.
---
So far all we know is that the new Legendary Vendor will let you scrap Legendaries to have better chances for better ones.
---
How much control you have and how random the process is, is currently unknown.
---
Personally, I'm betting it will be something like the Grinder from Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.
---
How would it make them useless?
---
Simple. They spread their infection via spores. The spores are spread via the scorched. Armoring them would make spreading the plague harder.
---
The Hivemind wouldn't want it's slore carriers armored, it's entirely counterproductive to it's survival.
---
I’ve had this happen a lot lately.  You’re not the only one dealing with the bug/issue.  It’s bad enough that some mobs are bullet sponges as is but when half your damage suddenly reappears back on the health bar it’s super frustrating.  Think I’m going to be taking a break from 76. 
---
i am the one outside the window
---
eh, I'd rather they buff them :)
---
someone who is lvl 300 should have more prestige levels on day 1 than someone who is lvl 50. thats all im saying. 
---
Light bulb!  So I just need to make a Bethesda account for an alt with one of my other emails.  Great.  Thanks.
---
Did some more digging on the ToS thing. So, interesting, I couldn't find a ToS for Fallout 76 - just for Zenimax, which covers all BGS games. There is nothing in there that I could tell about using two accounts. This is the closest I could find to that:
---
&gt;You agree not to use any hardware or software or any other method of support that is not authorized by ZeniMax or that may in any way influence or advantage Your playing abilities, or influence or advantage Your use of the Services. Third party tools, the use of ‘bots', "speed hacks", "deep-link", "page-scrape", "robot", "spider", algorithm or other programs that copy or monitor any part of the Services (including, but not limited to, the Game(s) and/or forums), software that transmits, manipulates, or distributes (including, but are limited to, "mirroring") the data stream or any aspect of the Services to another computer, server websites or other publication or distribution media, or software that permits You to use Services without human input are examples of methods not authorized by ZeniMax. 
---
So specifically, you can't hack / cheat / use 3rd party software or hardware that allows you to bypass human interaction. I know for Blizzard, they actually allow multi-boxing in WoW, which means using one keyboard / mouse to control multiple accounts simultaneously through the use of macros. This has been confirmed by Blizzard responses to player questions on the forums numerous times. Basically Blizzards says "Well, technically they ARE pushing the keys to perform the actions... the program just happens to send those keys to multiple accounts". I think Blizzard also doesn't care that much, since they're getting paid monthly for each of those accounts, regardless of how many players are paying for them. In the case of Zenimax / Fallout 76, I think they probably would not be so lenient, however, as long as you aren't using any 3rd party account - I'm literally just alt-tabbing between games, I think you're fine. I'd love some clarification form Bethesda on this though.
---
308 mod for combat/pipe rifle(fo4)
---
A lot of the reports on "Bethesda plz" topics are not in the list and are approved because they keep getting spammed incorrectly. Many people seem to think that anyone asking for something added to the game is instantly "Bethesda plz", even if not on the list.
---
Outside of that, the moderator who was working on that has had some things come up lately so it is not fully up to date. We will work on fixing that. 
---
Yep I have high hopes the legendary vendor will help remedy the whole "impossible odds RNG" system we have currently.
---
Lolz that last sound he heard was his ass passing through his face 
---
They should add some more unique guns from previous games too like Lincoln’s Repeater!
---
I agree with that, it may end up being every 50 lvls but I could see them changing it for balance reasons
---
I’m upvoting because I get griefed by higher level folk.
---
An alternative to selling plain purified water is to craft radaway and then diluted radaway with chemist and superduper perks equipped and you get more caps per unit of purified water actually consumed.
---
It's good I'm not the only one experiencing it. Actually it's not good as that means other people suffer because of it but you get what I mean. There's nothing more frustrating getting a great hit on a scorchbeast and then seeing it regen it all back 
---
I can get behind this logic. 
---
This is stupid. This inability is exactly why we are asked if we want to combine perks, or why we can still get dupes after the perk is already maxed.
---
If you blindly level up, *that is your fault*.
---
So is that the best armor besides PA?
---
Yeah that went right over my head lol maybe an emoji would’ve made it more clear since we were talking about scorchbeasts
---
I'm 44 years old. I've had a lifelong interest in gaming, which includes several years in the gaming industry. Let's quit the patronising now.
---
Left 4 Dead 2 were stupid enough to put it on their cover, which was visible to people under the rating in any retail outlet. That's why they got done.
---
Mario Kart was rated as being suitable for a lower age audience - indeed, actively marketed this way. So yes, the gesture didn't fit.
---
What you're ignoring is the context.
---
FO76 is an adult game, on an adult premise, with adult themes.
---
We do NOT expect 8 year olds to be playing this game - if that's happening, it's on the parents, not the publishers.
---
I apologise for the "get a life" comment, but you need to step back and start taking context and intended audience into account. Your comment was ridiculous. It just was.
---
If you think Colonel Gutsy is broken, you should've seen the Annihilator Sentry Bots I ran into this afternoon. As a melee build they were impossible to approach at any close to medium range. Their back-mounted grenade launchers literally never stopped firing, so I'd just get stunlocked by explosions and die.
---
And my axe. 
---
I am running an old gaming laptop  ASUS ROG G750JM i i7 processor and NVIDIA GTX860M 2GB graphics and 8 GB ram.

i move a lot due to my work so a laptop is more suited for me and i mostly play RTS or base building games so i don't really need top of the line PC to run them but i think i definitely need an upgrade in the near future.
---
I am so glad i asked about your channel name, so much good content
---
keep up the good work 
---
I was neglecting the card would then double up the effect. I was doing the math wrong in my head.
---
Squeaker
---
Im really getting mad over it to lul
---
I don't have a source for that, but it makes perfect sense in terms of parasitic symbiosis.
---
This is why the Scorched eventually freeze up entirely. Those are entirely composed of spores, having replaced the former person entirely, hence no cognitive function of locomotion.
---
By my camp... There's a shed that has 5-7 all the time. [https://i.imgur.com/org2a7M.png](https://i.imgur.com/org2a7M.png)
---
It wouldn't double up the effect? It would simply calculate with half the weight it did beforehand.
---
I know of modmail, and 99% of issues get handled that way but the issue is about a moderator, so that's likely not going to help.
---
Not going to go into details publicly, but I sent you a message and I hope you'll take the time to read it. 
---
Not *exactly*? No, it's not at all.
---
Lol what the heck
---
bUt ThE gUnS nEeEeEdEd NuRfInG.   
---
Seriously I haven't played since the last update I'm tired of my guns being near useless even all perked out. I have to repair everything after nearly 4 mags and it still doesn't do the damage like melee does and I hate melee. 
---
Third this.
---
If you have reason to not trust someone, then use an intermediary.  Though then you have to trust the intermediary too.
---
Fallout 1 and 2 had Desert Eagles. The divergence isn't meant to be a hardline cut-off point.
---
Um may bro
---
double up as it start from the proposed 3lbs.
---
What 
---
I think they're probably aware of them, but it's probably low on the priority list. A few days ago I had an objective to kill a huge creature, and I did just that, killed a diseased mirelurk queen, and it didn't update despite that.
---
I remember a month ago I also tried to take a picture of the Mothman statue for an objective and that didn't update or work either.
---
Most challenges work, but quite a few still seem to have unusual quirks, or don't work. The picture ones in particular are prone to being very finicky, or simply don't update.
---
Wish i could, but the reddit rules here wouldn't allow it. Although, the karma (-/+) works just fine for me.
---
I have not been Scammed in a trade so far, but I am careful trading with anyone who does not have a good reputation, and if it's a random, they will have to trust me, cause I don't randomly approach anyone to trade.
---
I rarely trade with anyone using my main character, unless it's a prearranged deal, and I'm travelling to them (never sell Materials/Junk that way), and some players get pissed when you won't trade them, but all they do is request my primary weapons, regardless of the great deals I'm offering.
---
It would be nice if we had a way to designate items as locked (not for sale), that would not even display in the trade menu.
---
I don't understand why we don't have the ability to inspect items in the trade menu, when you can while trading with a vendor.
---
There should also be a "Confirm Trade" button required by both parties to finalize a trade deal once everything is offered/accepted.
---
Found the melee player
---
Ah, ok
---
You know legendary enemies regen their health after you knock it halfway down, right? The same thing happened in 4. 
---
The cemetery north of the Nuka Cola plant.
---
Does this mean we are adding a bunch of new ammo types? I can't handle any more. It's rare enough already that I pick up .50 cal ammo.
---
I'm completely aware of that. This regards normal enemies as well, you do damage, they regen all the damage you just did
---
It's a silly ass bug 
---
wtf this lvl 10 i wanna hang with them irl
---
Please don't interpret this as anything other than me trying to be constructive but I don't really see what discussion is needed?    
---
If there was an exclusion zone that prevented players from building camps that literally sit on the absolute edge of the clubhouse you solve the problem.  The exclusion zone only has to be large enough to prevent turrets from automatically attacking enemies immediately when they spawn.  
---
I get it that developers want to make far reaching decisions that are well considered and planned out but this one is pretty simple.  The way the terrain slopes down all we need here is maybe the equivalent of \~200 or so yards of exclusion zone.  
---
i like to leave 1 salt when i mess with people
---
Powered only means that it increases action point refresh speed
---
Unfortunately, trading items for items requires a bit of trust. I have traded successfully many times before. It ain't wrong to trust, then again. You got to know who you are dealing with.
---
Players that are dedicated to trading, like vendors are always trustworthy.
---
Pretty sure you only get that much water if you collect the max amount of water the second it is entirely filled up, and do that for the entire hour. Same goes for extractors.

Meanwhile I work on Microsoft SQL Database, Server 2008, 2012, 2016, IBM M series servers and VS 3700 arrays, for 417 hospital's that handle patient information across the U.S. I have the DFA and HIPPA on my ass if I mess up once. 
---
Sorry, no mod experience.

heehehh someone likes IASIPhilly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Huh. I haven’t seen this happen since they said it was fixed. 
---
And i text bethseda about it nothing happen no text meassages either
---
Gatling Guns are really good with the melee swing speed perk (it works for it too) and the "speedy" receiver. It even does good reliable damage vs. SBQ. An Anti Armor or Bloodied with Fire Rate on it is great vs. the queen. Even without legendary effects, it's reasonable. And the Gatling Laser is actually really good in terms of DPS. It just kinda blows vs. the queen due to her 300DR / 300 ER.
---
Glad you support racism. 
---
It does with bloodied weapons especially 
---
0 danger??? they wreck me with those blasts...
---
Of course, the pipe gun drum magazine only holds 18 shots, so be careful what you wish for :-/
---
That should be upped...
---
Yeah mostly everyone i have traded with was honest.  Too bad we got bad apples like that one. 
---
My (first pass) idea would be, once you get over 50 (or maybe it caps at 50), you can 'prestige' and start over at level 1, but all your special stats start at 2, not 1.
---
I can see that getting overpowered pretty quickly though, unless they kept the individual special limits at 15.
---
Yes. If you go in there and you don’t see any colored uniform, do not pick anything up. Leave and find a new server. Continue to do that until you find a color you’re looking for or whatever. Then you wait I’d say maybe a day or less than that to do it again if you found the one you want and are searching for another. 
---
I’m totally cool with camps at WS.  I had mine on the golf course for a period of time.  
---
Setting up a turret platform behind the GC though is totally lame.  I busted up one the other day on principle alone.  Even worse the owner was nowhere to be found or I would have blasted them too. 
---
100% agreed. I was thinking of this when I was trying to speculate his item.
---
don't suppose you still have a plan for sale do you?
---
Got it. Thanks!
---
I thought it implied they had a screw loose lol
---
Oh ok thank you
---
No I lost that account to the ban wave in Jan and am restarting now.
---
£50 each, they charge by the hour even though they only took about 35-40 minutes each. 
---
Well. My point still stands. There is no drum mag for 10mm.  It may be possible but there is none.   Everyone here makes great points. But the thing is, I was just giving a possible reason why it’s not in the game.  
---
And if you could machine a tommy gun drum onto a 10mm gun and it actually function, or create a 10mm around the tommy drum, then you could become very wealthy. So id say get to work on that 
---
I completely understand the comments about not having very many friends playing to hold your stuff while you switch characters. If you're on Xbox, hit me up, I'm always glad to help others in the wasteland. GT is Broughsiff. Happy trails!
---
it's a crazy DR that's for sure! It's basically power armour levels
---
I kind of saw it miles away, but was tempted by his fake offer lol. He baited me, otherwise i just ignore negative karma players.
---
My story is a lesson for thinking otherwise.
---
I’ve found 4 different colored ones on the 3rd floor in the BoS rooms and in the bathroom on a bench in front of the showers. I have not seen them anywhere else in there. 
---
Just make it so you can set a filter on any container that only shows one version of your loot (or different containers have different filters).  Ammo box, weapon safe, drug cabinet, clothes closet, armor stand, etc.  Not separate inventories, just a different view of your whole stash depending on the container style.
---
I was only able to get 3 on my first try. 
---
-The fusion core generator at MBTY was empty
---
-PA set missing in front of Abandoned Mine Elaine
---
-PA set missing at Belching Betty
---
never made it to the last bunker (lol)
---
Still a good run. Thanks for sharing :)
---
This. The problem is not the level of the player, it's that melee is absolutely broken right now in terms of it's damage output. 
---
**We REALLY need to stop saying things like "player with level XXX killed me and that's unfair".** 
---
No. The player with the far better gear and build killed you, and you know what? Someone has to win, and that player has invested a ton of time into farming and trading for the best gear, researched the best builds, and optimized. 
---
Got it! So the ones right by the elevators right?
---
Best to read, never comment, there.
---
I got banned from there because I answered the question "what makes Diamond City so defensible, is it the walls?" With "Helm's Deep will never fall, as long as her walls are defended."
---
Either they don't like real answers worded as jokes, or they hate LotR references.
---
Weird thing, either way.
---
None of the subs I am aware of support giving negative trade karma. Or do you mean you went by his Reddit comment karma?
---
The Transistor was invented in Fallout, just about 70 some odd years later than we did.
---
this is covered as a core suggestion in my Inside the vault Response (Jan 1 edition call for feedback), the need for types of containers to accomplish supply or some type of interaction between different characters, whether your own or your friends or community / clan like group. ways to solve item transfer to finish the very first gen feeling drop bag that cannot be used for ease in many situations and many other situations cannot be used at all really
---
Why should there be. By design it is supposed to be high risk/high reward thing, where PVP is the high risk. Sadly it is neither. Never has anyone attacked my workshops and neither are they producing any high rewards.
---
&gt;  I think you could pull it off with low settings on a 1080 or 1080 ti. 
---
That's...a bit of an understatement. I'm running i7-6850k, 1080ti, 32gb ram @ 3200 (all OC, but nothing insane), and seeing max refresh rate (100fps) at 3440x1440 with ultra everything aside from the shadows/blur/bokeh/etc tweaking. Running 2-3 client instances without altering graphics settings hasn't been a problem. 
---
I'm wondering this too. I haven't traded with anyone - at all! I see these posts and wonder if it matters if I trade or have grind for hours that I don't have time for.
---
FWIW a lot of posters in this thread actually think Col. Gutsy should be the norm and favour making other monsters in the game more challenging.
---
This doesn't mean amping up their health. Col. Gutsy is a great example of a monster who is dangerous but fairly fragile.
---
Respect the determination :)
---
I want the acid material requirements to make fuel be sane.
---
Oi ye got a license for dat common sense there ya cheeky bugger?
---
But then I'd be perturbed! I hate power armor and have only worn it by accident. If power armor users could use fist weapons then I'd no longer have a niche! Ugh, it hurts to even think about
---
thank you. we are kindred spirits.
---
Given that, you should realize, that while this game IS soloable, you did buy an online MMO...
---
Yea, If I was below average, didn't understood the perks and had 0 armor, I would take the damage too.
---
Why's he looking for the .50cal Sniper? Hunting Rifles are common and the Hardened Receiver Mod is better than the .50 currently. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I just hope the dude knows
---
Hi are you on I found a torso for the jpack, hope to hear from u.
---
I have some experience with various firearms and other weapons. I know those guns will handle differently IRL. The grip, the balance, how they reload, recoil, rate of fire, aiming, accuracy, ballistics, sound, etc, all combine to define the experience of using them.  In game though would the difference enough to make me consider one over the other?  Would the devs be able to capture the essence of the differences and would players who are not firearms enthusiasts be anything but confused by so many choices?  And why stop at firearms?  What about pole arms beyond the spear?  More varieties of swords or bows?  I don't see where the game would benefit from that level of choice, though I do appreciate your enthusiasm.  Maybe there are some gaps in the game arsenal that could be filled in with some of what was listed, but too much would be counterproductive IMHO.
---
Yeah, I have my FPS limited to 120 because if you go much higher, the game locks you up as a security measure (due to the whole "speed hacking thing with high FPS).
---
Yup. Just go up the elevator and go right in the room in front of you. If it’s not there then check the next room in that hall on the bed. If not there turn around and go into the bathroom and look on the bench :) not there? Then leave the world and try a new one. Don’t pick anything up though. If there are enemies you can kill them, won’t hurt it. 
---
Hi are you on very interested in that plan if the offer stands . Thanks again.
---
1080, 1440, or 4k?
---
Would love to see classics like the .45 auto pistol, and the hunting revolver.  Appalachia needs the .45-70 ammunition to be reintroduced so we can get stronger lever-action rifle receivers, and a hunting revolver.
---
We definitely need an anti-materiel rifle chambered for .50, since the hunting rifle .50 receiver is a joke.
---
Modern guns are probably out of the question though, I think it goes against the style.  They appeared in Fallout 2, but I feel like the only reason they appeared was because the developers thought they were cool looking and figured they'd add them in their game.  
---
I've got a level 50 perfect storm, what is it worth to you? (Xbox1)
---
Yeah, ix1805 has a spreadsheet showing all of the outfits/cosmetics obtainable from events. You really have to grind though; I've been going through responder events all week trying to get the fireman outfit.
---
Got it and do you know how long if need to wait if I did happen to pick things up for it to respawn?
---
There is a hard limit on CAMP resource production.  More purifiers doesn't make it produce faster.  What it ends up doing is just make it so you can hold more between collections.  It's not well spelled out anywhere, but it's how it works.
---
So you just load up on the amount of purifiers you want to hold your stash between collections.  Personally I find 10 storage to be enough for me.  Where I'm located that is 5 small purifiers.
---
I did at one time locate myself on a river and put 4 Industrials, but rarely would I ever be away long enough to get 20 waters (unless I was real busy).
---
I’ve been told wait a whole day but you can try sooner than that. There hasn’t really been a time stamp though 
---
Oh nice, missed that response but this is great news.
---
I got some laughs from some randoms last night when I stood against a scorchbeast alone in my wood armor and my underwear.
---
Would love to see the 12.7mm pistol and SMG in this game. Had a lot of fun with both weapons in New Vegas. 
---
Awesome! Thanks I lot I appreciate your time and knowledge
---
You need some proper time outside
---
Just 1440. I just got one of those ASUS ROG Swift monitors - 144hz, 1440p, IPS, g-sync, etc. I thought about going 4K but I've seen 4K in person and while it IS a bit better, I didn't think it was worth the performance hit. If I was using a larger monitor I might consider it, but 27" 1440p seems just right for me.
---
No. It depends upon your play style what the best is to equip 
---
Yes please! If abusing is a concern maybe put some weight per day limit or item per day or something. 
---
Most players will probably use it mainly for exchanging weapons/armor/serums and other build specific items
---
Sometimes the RNG gods are unkind! May you have better luck in the future 😊
---
I clicked on his name from the chat and i saw -15karma under his name.
---
I appreciate your response. What I'm more specifically referring to is things that *are* on the list, but still manage to be a top post (can I name my power armor plz?!). Is it possible to have an auto-moderator remove posts on the lists? Otherwise you guys have a hell of a job and I don't envy you!
---
It does work.
---
It doesn't work the way you want it to.
---
I am! Just doing my vendor rounds. Jump im my game I'll in watoga
---
I would love to see a gun that uses the flare ammo. Like a machine gun or reloadable pistol magazine.
---
wow, you are a fuckin asshole edgelord.  kinda feel sorry for ya.  but hey, you can stroke your e-peen about a video game! hooray!
---
&gt; Glad you support racism.
---
Hahahaha, ok dude I'm done talking to you now. 
---
Makes sense to me; the 34" ROG 1440 with gsync has been a good pairing for me with the 1080ti and aside from issues with 21:9 in certain games I'm now a widescreen convert. Looking forward to seeing if the 2080ti's successor is enough for one card widescreen 4K.
---
No problem :) 
---
It happens when you leave the area and come back too it isn't just when you log out. 
---
It's a shame because it's a good design and it's not like it was a cheap skin either. 
---
Yes caped at 50 for now
---
Yep, 45/50 is the cap. At least for now.
---
each time i get that message, and i try to find another world, i get an infinite loading screen and have to shut down the game
---
Have any X-01 shocks? 
---
and the pvp
---
I’m in watoga also lol what your gt!
---
The only reason I didn't go with an ultrawide is because it doesnt work well for recording / making videos, and all of my hardware upgrades this year were literally purchased with ad revenue / donations from YouTube heh. I wish there was a good solution for doing ultra wide and also recording.
---
100% Correct! Didn’t notice before but you are right!
---
Shame they don't drop good loot, hell even the lvl 95 variants drop like prime receiver plans at best
---
Btw, is it immediately when you get in the fort?
---
Now this is a fantastic idea. Would making retrieving excavator for nuke zones so much easier. 
---
How bout a high rad low health heavy gunner with bloodied and unyielding gear
---
have you ever gotten nuked there? 
---
If you can clear out some high lvls in the savage divide let’s say a small group of mutants or ghouls you’d get let’s say 500 xp depends on the lvl and amount but doing small raids like that is a good idea 
---
Alternatively: some mods for the currently existing "new" weapons

Would be nice to get something like a sight/scope/bigger drum for the LMG, or pretty much anything for the new melees. Maybe a recipe for the chainsaw so we can make level 50 ones? It might be a bit optimistic, but maybe something like a speed loader for the dragon (four pipes attached to each other to clean all the barrels at once) or the ability to make a standard .50 cal receiver, hence making the prime conversion not a permanent choice
---
It's been inconsistent since the start for me. Some times I take no rads at all, others I'm like a rad sponge. I just keep plenty of radaway on hand.
---
Luckily not an issue for me, but I'm glad someone's doing it - will definitely check out your channel later today though. Some of your graphics mods stuff looks like good advice as I start trying FO4 with the Frost overhaul.
---
initial..it took FOREVER to download
---
This is amazing. What a lucky guy 😍
---
There isn’t one
---
You are amazing. 
---
This happened to me today! I popped a radaway. And then a radx diluted and then a radshield and my rad exposure was still maxed on the hud of my PA. No idea of there's a fix. This is the first time I've seen it 
---
That works too lol
---
Most recent patch notes fixed the Gatling gun benefitting from that perk
---
Just for future reference, Reddit doesn't show the *real* negative karma to prevent negative karma farming so that -15 could have easily been -10,000.
---
So.. yea.. don't trust negative karma cause it's so easy to stay positive that anyone in negative is either a troll or a really really shitty person.
---
Same thing happened to me. Ive done all of the daily's there once and never had them trigger again. I still get the occasional event though.
---
Frost is so good. It takes a certain kind of person to really appreciate it, but it's amazing. I played that mod more than I did Vanilla Fallout 4.
---
what about plasma weapons?
---
I’ve addressed it directly by starting the Whitesprings Turret Enforcement Agency. I give a firm verbal warning when the offender has live turrets present and if they do not comply, I lay the smack down on their turrets until they submit or rage quit. So far, it’s been working out pretty well. 
---
I’m fucking TRIGGERED that you included all these overly detailed specific weapons and didn’t include the Bumper Sword. 
---
I’m only half kidding. 
---
I would love this! 
---
Also you could assign the power armor you want to use since we can't rename them , put the one you want on the D-pad . 
---
because they aren't listening to the player feedback that action bar customization and the ui to go with the equipment and combat controls, and did no testing to gain that feedback before releasing the game
---
BB gun, just for lulz
---
On market 76, you only get it by receiving it from other players on the comments. Players can farm it by holding grahm for example lol. But if you try to spam it, an automated system rejects it.
---
However, in this sub, players can give negative karma the same way they hand out positives.
---
Couldn’t you still apply like a type of leather armor or combat armor but have it torn showing the spores?
---
Any chance for more atom content coming? I'd spend my atoms in good stuff. Really want to Rp atom priest.
---
Yeah, part of the whole problem with white springs is that the ghouls aren’t able to get at the camp turrets from inside the clubhouse, so the campers just wander off and have fun while their camp grinds away for them.
---
I typically fight her in Excavator armor lvl 45. My only real perks card for damage resist is 1 point in fireproof, 1 point in born survivor (could be replaced with a torso mod if I want to give up what I have on it.) and 3 points in serendipity.  The fireproof is the big secret for surviving SBs. Even back when they were spamming the blast, with just 1 perk point in it, I didn't have a problem with them as long as I'm in power armor.
---
In post-apocalyptic Russia, chair sits on you?
---
I remember walking somewhere in the savage divide doing a mission at a really low level, and being scared shitless when both a group of level 30+ scorched and a bloody missile suddenly appeared. Shame I was dead before I could see it take off properly
---
I use this with marsupial and utilize positioning advantages and the vats strike. I feel like the marsupial or maybe agility stat and a card to go with it should improve the range of the vats strike with unarmed. you have to move in and attack and get back away from any other enemies, and go in circles, sometimes circle backpedaling works if you aren't facing any ranged and you have a herd of ghouls just trying to rush you
---
Sorry to hear that pal. Hope you manage to still have some fun with the game. 
---
The only thing I could think of is that every time you dye it spawns a new bag and delete the old one the only evidence I have of this is a running with a Yao Guai that flat refused to be put down
---
Not only teammate camps, but camps in general. I know they did it to prevent griefing with turrets or maybe the turret AI went screwy, but the distance in which a camp can prevent the placement of a nearby camp is way too big.
---
The no rads glitch is my favourite in Nuke Zones.
---
I don’t have any info on that currently.
---
*karma thank you so much!!!!!!
---
because its a little after the bombs fell, everyone died, and there is literally no law instrastructure or security, its why any player can choose to destroy the base, there is no ruling force or place to settle that would have security against that, the only thing is other player responses to the attacker since the rest of the population is dead dead.
---
It's a common misconception, but ESO isn't actually a Bethesda game. It was developed (and continues to be supported) by ZeniMax Online Studios. Bethesda actually acquired Battlecry Studios to work on putting multiplayer into Fallout 76, and that was re-formed as 'Bethesda Game Studios Austin' shortly before the game released.
---
There has been plenty of times where I've  been playing with friends and I'm the only one to see a magazine sitting on a table/counter...so I'll pick it up a deposit it in a container for a friend to be able to see and pick up. Same goes with holotape games .
---
Just to clarify. A golf club base is one up near the back door of the golf course. If ya out on greens to me that's fine. But if it's up between them big trees right behind the back doors of the golf course with alot of turrets and a fusion generator. Its what Richard would do.... do be a dick. It's going to, and should get smashed. 
---
You’re correct. I finally farmed the plan for the hat 2 days ago.
---
New legendary merchant is coming, perhaps along with an overhaul of legendaries in general?
---
I'm not sure if the loot/junk baggie stays after your second death. You drop your loot on first death, then, as far as I have thought, you need to be a considerably more cautious person going back for it. Not 100% on this though. If you haven't obtained any new loot then it kind of makes sense that there isn't any baggie waiting for you next time.
---
I got caught with this a while back - Blindly ranked up before I realised I needed 2 perk slots to use the thing, then couldn't rank down again.. 
---
I forgot how many cool guns F2 had that never made it past that game. 
---
You're entitled to your opinion but this comment was totally uncalled for and disrespectful. I didn't bring any politics here and I didn't try to force anything on you. All I did was state what I am. I hope you can be more kind to others in the future. 
---
Thats true and its my duty to comfortably ween my self out of my preferred comfort zone. 
---
Gee golly, that sounds great, whippersnapper!
---
please don't, this isnt something we need.
---
I just saw a ghoul flying across my screen when a nuke hit it
---
Well it seems either way I'm wrong. Either budget does in fact increase (which I doubt, but I've been wrong before) or I was wrong about how lany turrets you'd need to fill up the budget.
---
Hell man, I feel bad about how easy it is to switch into Power Armor sometimes.  I'm in this game for the survival and the struggle, but I can hop into my two-legged tank almost as easy as putting on anew hat.
---
Probably had time left on the contract, and the license wasn't limited to a specific game.
---
Stealth--all perks. I would be careful of how many enemies you take out at a time, as they can still find you. Either 1 or two, or all of them. Speed Demon helps with this and helps you escape if you need to. Without writing a book, you still have to be careful and play with caution.
---
Be careful when you open the lab door at WT. You have to kill fast and loot later. 
---
is it more profitable than just selling the junk without scrapping it?
---
I feel like its already too powerful, especially with legendary effects.
---
Yeah i put up a 20k armor peice for sale. The amount of people that lowballed me and tried to hustle me was insane. But those people atleast didnt try to steal it from me. 
---
All I want is my chinese assault rifle damnit. The one that was in 3. Best fallout gun ever.
---
I don't see why. There's a Wendigo tied to every fifth story quest, it feels like.
---
True...now the server keeps dropping me everytime I'm close to launching a nuke from the silos. I swear it knows when I'm almost done and then WHAM disconnected again! 
---
You lunatic!
---
Yea I'm having the same issue. No real complaint here kinna figured it low on priority. But i do like to accomplish some just to kill time now and again. Thanks for your insight was hoping i wasnt  losing my mind lol

Server hopping and looting armor spawns
---
I use glowing blood packs.  Rad-x nerfs my mutation and I run the radicool perk in nuke zones anyway.  The glowing blood pack gives 75% resistance and gives some health back too.  Keeps the rads manageable.  They're not hard to make ( glowing blood + bloodpack ) use chemist and super duper and you'll be swimming in them in no time.  Just my opinion
---
Are u on Xbox? I've got one in storage. 
---
yes please
---
I got mine during a defend workshop mission
---
There was a mod I found on PS4 for Fallout 4 where I could control the weather and spawn rad storms. There was also a setting to allow ghoul hordes to attack during said rad storms and the severity/frequency of the horde. I turned that shit up like Lil Jon.
---
I would get swamped by 15-30 ghouls continuously...that's what I want in this game.
---
Ah OK, good to know. They've been bugged before I think.
---
My first camp was also very close to that location for much the same reasons.  I also loved that it was super convenient to Wade Airport as well. Anytime I'm in the area, I still get nostalgic when passing by.
---
It's all good nothing I can do about it now.  But yeah I still enjoy the game just trying to get back where I was is a long road
---
You get plenty of duplicates. just make a 1,2,3 version of each.

Don't want to control the weather?  Too bad, pretty sure that's what one facility in the area is for.
---
great tip!!! once i get that card to show up i for sure choose it! thank you!
---
Damn... ok.
---
It does not. You have to use radaway and pray.
---
So disappointing :(
---
When they first updated the ghouls for fallout 4 they scared the crap out of me the first few times they’d crawl out of under a bookshelf or wherever. 
---
Ps4 ty though :)
---
Lol sure if that’s true I have a mansion on the moon. I’ve been planing 300+hours and have found a lot of plans and recipes from taking over workshops and stuff and have never seen it. Could be super rare but idk
---
The eggs are not working like they used to for me
---
You will get a wide variety of answers here. With 15 luck and 6 charisma, assault rifles give me about 44 caps each. Most high level super mutants drop those so I only need to kill five of them to empty out a vendor.
---
That's what works for me. Sometimes I find radium rifles and Gauss rifles, those get me about 150 caps each.
---
Saw one at the Watoga train station last night for 49 caps. I'm on PC and have one in my stash if you want to buy it. Was hanging onto it just in case.
---
Flux. Get 120-130 of it at whitesprings during a nuke and youll have 1400 in no time
---
Ok, honest question here, what is the proper way to do a trade, both as the seller and as the buyer to avoid getting scammed out? I've started to accumulate a selection 2* and 3* weapons and armor, (mainly armor) that I'd like to parley into items I need/want. As caps have little to no value for higher end gear, how do you go about it?? Sorry for the noob post, but hey, i gotta learn it somewhere! 👍
---
Mine too, except for the no damage glitch, which I get once in awhile.  Fell in a fissure once and couldn't die.  Everyone was standing around looking in, laughing.  Couldn't get out though, had to disconnect. 
---
cool list, and it is a pain, a little suggestion that would help, with the weapon mod section at least, if you grouped them by type, then alphabetically, instead of just alphabetically it would be a bit easier to find the mod
---
Not too much, but we can try to bargain. I'm on Xbox one too. Send me a message for my gamertag and add me.
---
No. The Hivemind wants to spread it's infection. Armoring your carriers in any way hinders that spread. I get from a gameplay point, enemy variety, etc. But from a scientific, naturalistic, and logical standpoint, no. It wouldn't even use people as carriers if the spores were viable as an airborne infection.  
---
The point is the carriers force you to spread the infection for the Hivemind, by killing them, period.
---
Keep in mind, the player character would have become a Scorched, if they hadn't been innoculated.
---
This would have happened, just because the P.C. remotely enters the space of someone infected.
---
Now, if the Hivemind's intent was an actual, standing army, you'd have a point.
---
Just give me a Proton Ax and I'll use that thing for hour's.
---
Lot of good info posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/av7bq0/fusion\_core\_farm\_route/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/av7bq0/fusion_core_farm_route/)
---
Almost everything I have tried isn’t working 
---
I really liked the smoking mod in fallout4.  
---
you completely missed the point, like less than one percent of the playerbase even knows your spreadsheet exists
---
Should be. the room to the left once you get in. I found a security key there for Camp Venture. 
---
I’m talking when there isn’t a nuke
---
I agree! It would be great to see what we haven't unlocked yet (maybe just the name with strike through). However, since it's not in the game it's like a little mini game for me.
---
That sounds like a dream I once had except the other Vault Dwellers were my schoolmates and I wasn't in a fissure, I was at school and naked and everyone was laughing at me. 
---
I don't know if I find any of the creatures in 76 outright scary, but I do find the Mirelurk Queen unnerving, just as she was in Fallout 4.  It's the tipsy, top-heavy way she walks around.
---
I also used to find the bugs in 4 rather gross because you could shoot off their legs and they'd just keep going, but that's been removed in 76 as far as I can tell.
---
Play with your mods on your weapon, you can easily double your weapon condition with proper selection of mods.
---
Check out weapon artisan, rank 3 allows you to repair to 200%.
---
Also if you have INT slots open, equip the melee/guns perk that decrease the CND rate drop.
---
I can easily get close to 1000 shots off my handmade before repair, or solo a silo with my SkiSword and still be near 100% CND on it after.
---
wot?
---
The game is trying to encourage player trading in a very inconvenient way. Vendors buy everything, but a lot of players only want one or two of your items, max, and will usually refuse to pay full price, despite it being far cheaper than VendorBots who will grossly overcharge you.
---
Camp Venture storage key, you were right, I just need to test it out, thank you for the key tho, even tho I don’t know if it’s correct xD
---
I want like a true post apocalyptic crazy weapon for instance a sling shot that uses 50cal balls or like a glorified BB gun I’ll even take a spinning fan blade attached to some wood 
---
Become a carnivore/plague walker
---
You can find this pretty frequently at Watoga and Harper's Ferry, yes, but not on every server every day.

Hell, I’d love to see more of that kind of “revenge”. I don’t often have time to run through that whole mission and I need flux, just so much flux
---
I will try that, thanks!
---
I play an unarmed melee build and if I see one I can take it out fairly fast, but if there's several, and they're usually are since they like to hang in groups, I hop in power armor. The dmg loss I suffer makes up for the armor I get in return because yeah, those guyschew through my armor super fast when in groups.
---
I like these ideas a lot. 
---
Does it actually continue from one login to the next?
---
I had a thing where I continued to get blasted by Rads every few seconds long after I left the blast zone until I restarted the game.  I think it has something to do with the SBQ's dusting attack.
---
Nah, there are already benches within 5 minutes of where you are most of the time.  Besides, it would mean more to lose if you died/ get murdered. 
---
It's not griefing if it's for the common cause! 
---
Yeah me too. There was one that acted as a quick save for Survival that was awesome. 
---
I'd just be happy with another sniper rifle or two. I'm all about sneak 'n snipe.
---
Actually this is what happened to me yesterday. I blocked these strangers back there in December because they shot slap me for no reason, kept attacking me even though I didn't want to fight them. Long story short, I was capturing the bog town workshop for the weekly challenge, and then 10 minutes later there was a message telling me that my workshop is being captured, gave me a quest to seized the intruder. I let him to capture that workshop; thinking that everyone else need to do the weekly challenge.
---
After he captured the workshop I saw his name through the new UI on workshop (who owns it) and his name ring a bell to me, so I checked my SOCIAL - recent list and saw the blocked people in my recent list. I was wondering why would I be in the game world with the people I have blocked? so I quit the game and re log back in and guess what? lol I was being put in the same world server with them AGAIN.
---
So yeah, BLOCKING doesn't mean anything. It just makes you hidden from their map but you still can find them in the world. Switching server also won't guarantee you that you will be placed in a different world server with the people you have blocked.
---
It's just another lazy programming by Bethesda I guess.
---
Ok. Maybe try a little server hop at Wat ago 
---
Enjoying it a lot so far, though all my FO4 play was permadeath survival so I'm likely the mod author's target audience. Weird that I've yet to find any npc with whom I can have any kind of interactive conversation, though. 
---
Okay thanks man:)
---
^THIS.  1 cloth  to craft + SuperDuper.  Weigh .1 each
---
Yeah no this was a horrible idea tried it
---
 I ran right into one while chasing a Scrochbeast a couple of days ago.
---
 Was being harassed by Lurks and did not notice her till I literally ran into her. She's like 2 stories tall. I briefly considered getting out my new dagger but common sense kicked in and I ran. ;) 
---
I used to really fear the "Controls Locked" monster. Haven't seen it in a while.
---
But everyone knows that lunchboxes have to be bought
---
Well, you fan go visit Slash Gear's article about it, which points out that the material is not mentioned to be glass any where in the advertisements. 
---
You can also clearly seen in the SS Bottling video from early December, that the actual bottle is a plain glass bottle. 
---
I like the marine helmet (the one that looks like a bug. They're fairly cheap to produce, weigh close to nothing and reap a pretty good return.  Make 20 or 30 a day and you can sell them anywhere. 
---
I'm sure they'll break 3 other things implementing this
---
Hmmm purified water.. or go around, collect every last bit of junk you possibly can, dont scrap it and sell it lol, thats what i did till i realized i could make 1400 in about 20 min if i just server hop till i find a nuke on whitesprings
---
&gt;But I always assumed there was a good respawn rate.
---
Not really. Enemies tend to respawn when a new player who hasn't been there yet, enters the area. In WS golf club that happens quite often.
---
I'll usually screenshot (xb1) and download them to my phone from the xbox app then upload to imgur. 
---
Poseidon Power Plant
---
Anything else is wasting your time. 
---
Take Poseidon, than power Armor hunt if you have too. 
---
You can easily get 6-11 cores from Poseidon in 1-2 hours. 
---
I do agree that the first time I ran into a Wendigo it was a total jump scare moment.  
---
I do hope that with the new Cryptid update this spring we can get more interesting and better encounters with all the unique characters in FO76.  I am very impressed with the lore of all the new creatures, however have been disappointed with how infrequent they are found or how not challenging they were.  
---
Well it plays out like this.
---
You have the item, you see the offers. You accept. They trade first because you posted it and they want in. That is the way we all go with.
---
If I have the item up for sale and you come to take it. I am taking your offer first, then I will give you mine. If you try to scam, the buyer can get back on you by dropping negative karma on your post. This will warn others and make their trading more difficult as seen in the story above. However, if you give first, and the buyer decides to bounce. You do not have any sort of way to get back on him/her.
---
You could get a middle man from some sub reddits, but that is kind of a hassle. Most players aren't patient to deal with that.
---
I find if you play in the dark with the right sound system which I have a 7.1 and I sniper/sneak so If I get sneaked then the check my pants option is checked often... normally from Ghouls due to a respawn or a Mirelurk respawn due to someone fast traveling into my area just as I am thinking I am finished clearing it...
---
And aren't turrets then the best way to farm them?
---
I like it because the current perception of firearms are that they are vastly inferior to melee all around. As such, they should be tiny in size. I have been figuring out damage per second calculations for my automatic critical headshot 10mm build and am getting around 1200 damage output. That's enough to kill the average player 4 times over within one second. That is death .25 seconds into shooting someone. Everything I shoot melts. The massive size of that gun just feels appropriate in my head. It just looks like it was heavily modified from this dinky little handgun into this massively powerful hand cannon.
---
Does that make sense?
---
If you go to fort defiance and get all the straight jackets they sell for 50 a pop and there is like 15-20 in there at a time also golf outfits sell for 30 caps both are plentiful so you shouldn't have a problem buying out vendors bulk junk is another way if you have extra and dont need it.
---
I do not understand why this gun has no tactical optics. Its a strange oversight
---
I am having troubles find those 
---
Bravo and Charlie still unsolved at NukaCrypt. Please share so we all dont have to hop servers after 1 nuke.
---
You have to find the plan.
---
The plan can be found on a Civil War Re-enactor corpse.  It's a random encounter and a somewhat rare spawn.  I found mine in the area between Summersville and New Gad.  But yet, 1 cloth, .1 weight, sells for 28-33 Caps apiece.  It's dangerously trivial for me to hit the Cap limit now... I always have to remember to leave one vendor untouched so I have a place to sell worthless Legendaries or excess bulk.
---
Just run through the place kill all the enemies and you'll find plenty of them 
---
I've never even heard that feedback before. What the crap is an action bar?
---
I’m having troubles making lots of those 
---
The president is Donald Trump. You might be best waiting in there a few more years.
---
Everyone has a different strategy. I like to find a outfit to craft and sell. Light and easy. I do Halloween costumes. 
---
I guess I need the plan for that
---
My understanding is that there are a limited number and they don’t resistance often. Since the Whitesprings is constantly farmed, it’s hard to get them... I’ve been playing for months and only have 2 under my belt. You just have to constantly check in and look for them. 
---
Ah jeez what fucked up vault tech experiment are you trying to pull on me.
---
Hmmmm maybe
---
He's not affiliated with Watoga, per se, but he shares his cap pool with him. Anyone know who the random Responder Protectron Vendor shares with? I know it's not responders as I can sell to both him and the Charleston Station at the same time. 
---
Do you have chemist and super duper perks? If you dont, you should.
---
I don't remember if just fast travelling fixed it or I had to log out.  It's been a couple weeks since I last had it.  The SB radiation attack does continue for a few seconds though, kind of like with the gangreous ghoul aura.  You might of had a disease that didn't announce on your screen, that happens fairly frequently to people. I've started checking my effects screen fairly often during and after an event.
---
Ok
---
Would you settle for some legendary power armor limbs? I'm always in power armor and the mods for the arms kinda suck but most want you to fist things.
---
So annoying, I only ever saw 1 and the bloody robots killed it!
---
This is a common complaint.
---
I've killed a couple.  That's about it.  You need to luck into getting Whitesprings in a relatively pristine state.  Because once numerous players start farming there, nukes drop, etc., it gets screwed up.
---
I had to look this up after your reference and I did not know about this.  This is awesome and I hope it is available soon as I enjoy unique cosmetic effects.  This also makes it more possible to just use that same lunch box for a paper bag replacement.  Thanks for the info!
---
I am just happy to know I am not alone.
---
Yes it’s getting the stuff to make them is problem 
---
I find it a lot when the enemies aren't taking damage like they're supposed to. My instigating war drum doing 300 base damage should one shot most everything out of a nuke zone. But it doesn't, the first shot takes a small fraction of their health instead of double and the second takes 3/4. I could be swinging at a super mutant 3 or 4 times and it does nothing at all. 
---
Why should I have to change servers to get away from a toxic player? 
---
:-/.... you do realize I just described a loot box designed to look like the lunch box right?
---
I honestly don't even see the point. I can clear it just as easy without the turrets.
---
Yeah its happened the last two attempts at entering a nuke zone, with about a week in between.
---
The responder bot shares with the other responder stations
---
It is in the ESM, but leftover from Fallout 4 and doesn't drop in the game (it's not on any levelled lists). The templates for those wiki pages were generated by extracting data from the ESM and they list lots of things that can't drop in Fallout 76. You can see all that can and can't drop in my plans list here:
---
It took me three months.
---
Yeah, if you can't cripple the Spouts on her head, that corrosive acid she spews is no joke.
---
Sometimes the capitol building has two. They don't reset as often as they used to. As someone else said the easiest way is to take over a plant yard, you'll be set for awhile.
---
Random drop from completing the Quest: Signal Strength. So only one chance per character. And it isn't a guaranteed drop.
---
I second Poseidon Energy. Restart the factory (imho, easiest of the 3 power plants to get up and running) then connect the already existent fusion core generator to a now active power box... boom, 3 cores every 15 minutes or so. 
---
If it’s correct one? 
---
They should probably fix the existing weapons first tbh...
---
We all know about energy weapons, but the Gauss rifle currently has 3 different bugs causing it to get stuck ADS, as well as the iron sights not even being accurate.
---
And by the way 2 of the 6 or so grenades don't function properly either. The Nuka quantum grenade has a blast radius about 100x too small, and the Frag MIRV splits into grenades which immediately explode and don't have time to spread out
---
They are not too hard to get rid of but I can't stand Fog Crawlers!
---
Yikes!
---
I have this bridge to sell you, its near Flatwoods. 10k caps
---
Wasteland on the Apple IIc for me...
---
There's so much melee weapons that were in past games but not in Fallout 76, I can't remember them all lol especially ones added in NV/Gun Runners. 
---
Because you announced you wanted to PvP when you took the workshop. Eventually someone who is into min/max'ing their build will come by and challenge you for it.

It's not their HP that got you (HP accrual stops at 50), it's the fact that the person's build is highly specialized in melee damage. But that doesn't make them invincible. If I see someone coming at me in melee I fade back and engage at range.   
---
In short, stop complaining and try different things. I killed a melee griefer (130 Wanted rating) at Whitesprings over the weekend. He was naked wearing a deathclaw gauntlet. He ran at me when I spawned into whitesprings.   
---
So I ran backward and went to Black Powder guns. (I over do them, 8 in my favorites). 3 Shots in (swapping weapons), right before he could land a hit, he was down.
---
I'd think they need to balance + add more mods for current weapons as they feel a bit under powered - I'd love end game weapon mods that gave me more options as well and more ammo change receivers letting us expand play styles 
---
what are you shooting 70+ times into a supermutant face? 
---
I wanna buy you a beer, dude. :D
---
I needs me Model 1887 Lever Action shotgun..
---
shotguns break in about four seconds anyway, why wouldn't you want to fix that?
---
Oog
---
It would be hard to farm glowing blood and not end up having a ton of glowing blood packs. I leave whitesprings nuke zones with way way more packs than regular glowing blood.
---
Motion Assist is my default non-jet pack.   +2 STR is nice enough.  
---
I had a jetpack and honestly didnt really like it and thought it wasnt necessary after about a week. Gave it to a friend and attached the reactive plates. Enjoying it more in my opinion 
---
Every time I see a post like this, it makes me wonder what you lot think about the raiders in all the other games. 
---
On psn? I'm sure that zerkour_fox fella was helping me out in a nuke zone earlier. 
---
I’ve got 6. 368 hours in.
---
Action bar is a system for activating both abilities and items in games that feature player choice of what to get / use / equip. Fallout 1 had a small action
---
Bar where ap was shown and you could switch between two weapons and select how to use the weapon (throw if applicable, sledgehammer had two
---
Different ways I forgot
---
What they are called) 
---
Going to inv to use things or change equipment cost ap and so it was better to be prepared to the extent possible via that action bar tool. 
---
76 has the favorites wheel, that is its non customizable action bar right now along with d pad and the buttons that share functions you can't unlink and customize into the action bar framework. 
---
Many mmo games have used a fully customizable onscreen ui and control config option for the action bar. In 76 while you can rebind certain functions , this is truly only a basic remap. You have almost no action bar customization functionality. The d pad area is accessed via g, h, and I think F on pc. There is remap but no way to change
---
The functionality. Pc does have number key action bar bindings which go on the favorite wheel. That's what it has now in comparison to action bar, you can map equipment / aid to these hot keys. But you cannot configure the ui or recustomize the controls for your abilities, items, and equipment.
---
This responsiveness and usability improvement / finishing to the action bar, so players can reliably set
---
Up how they will Use their Chosen items And skills during a live battle, should Come as a priority before
---
New Game modes and higher tier raid Like content
---
Bases by Charleston station right where the rare vender spawns stoo him from spawning and I'll run a high bounty on those cribs too. Eventually people will learn
---
Username checks out. 
---
My group is planning a Signal Strength farming expedition where one high level character escorts a group if lower level characters through Signal Strength, collects their drops, and then we repeat with new characters. That should eventually get us all the raider armor plans.
---
"The Purge" didn't "Take away gear" from dupers, EVERYONE was left with 1 of anything that was duped. So people using duped gear are still out there, it just stopped it from spreading anymore.   
---
That being said, still has nothing to do with the topic, min/max'd builds with Epic Gear (from any source, legitimate or otherwise) is still out there, and once you flag PvP (by taking a workshop), it's ON and you don't know who you will attract.
---
I'd like to not have to pay almost $20 for each one too, that'd be swell
---
As others are saying, I just hit lvl 50 and I'm actively enjoying taking out level 100 - 200s with little work. You gotta reclassify your perk cards and equip pvp armor to optimize your stats. With enough specs into Anti Armor, busting through power armor is like butter. 
---
I like those camps because you can climb up next to the turrets and tag mob spawns, let the turrets kill them, then go grab the loot in safety.
---
What actual problem do they create?
---
Not a creature, but the entirety of Lucky Hole Mine is just creepy as shit.
---
we need a cheer emote too, it'd be perfect when the noob you're chaperoning does something cool
---
"Childish_dipshit" was taken so he had to go with that, still fitting though
---
Just yesterday I ran into a lvl 50 behemoth and completely forgot it's in the game &amp; how huge they are! Completely fucked me up 
---
Its the one enemy that still makes me think before I act. Pls no nerf.
---
I finally got one yesterday, and I'm level 42! My first. I could hardly believe it when I saw it walking towards me.
---
And the devs behind those terrible physics refuse to do anything about it! Isn't it great??!!!!! ^sobs
---
I make marine helmets, just needs 1 glass, 1 plastic and 4 rubber, sell each one for 28 caps, so need 7 per vendor. 
---
lol... moderating takes a lot of time and yes, at some point you need to gain experience from somewhere.
---
I used to help run the European forums (French/English/German) as an English moderator for Dark Age of Camelot back in the early 2000's... it takes a lot of time and patience.  Not everyone is cut out for the task.
---
I must say that I have so far seen pretty good performance from the existing team.  But Admin/Mod work is for the long haul.  Good luck to anyone taking on the role.
---
I rotate between bulk junk and excess aid/apparel. 
---
It works well for me, as when I run out of aid and apparel I have restocked my excess junk and sell that, then run out of excess junk I am restocked on excess aid/apparel.  
---
I never really have to try for the 1400 caps worth of stuff to sell.  
---
 Got mine today! ;) About 50 visits to the smiling horror, to get my X0-1 Jet Pack. 
---
Guess I can not find the plans for that
---
Wait can you not add PA to your favorites bar? I know you can add other non PA Armor so that would be crazy if you can't.
---
Yup. I take far more dmg in my power armor vs troubleshooters regular armor from those things.
---
They are an actual standing army, they waited for the Scorchbeasts to start the attack at Morgantown. This was decided by the Scorchbeasts but it does mean the faction (Scorched/Beasts) have a depth of strategy to them
---
I have tried lots of stuff and I get screwed over in some ways
---
I was a huge fan of the double shot 5 crank laser musket I had in Fo4. If it was in 76 tho it would probably just heal robots because they need to fix laser damage still
---
Yeah, sorry. I guess I accidentally replied to the wrong comment. I meant to reply to shadowwolf. 
---
The hermit crab was the scariest, went to explore a nice looking truck on the road &amp; it started goddam moving which resulted in me screaming 
---
I usually only get the magazine every other day at best but it's definitely there. There is also a bobblehead by the tent on top of the high school too on the way to the gnome...
---
they listen to suggestions on the forums all the time, they love the feedback, just look at all the dev responded posts
---
Thanks for posting this and shining a light on something positive we can all share in.
---
Same. I honestly was kinda disappointed finding out that this wasn't on Xbox, so something for the Xbox community could be pretty nice
---
 So hopping on the the nearest bus, roof, whatever and dropping mines on a horde of Ghouls is not fun? I have no other use for them but that is entertaining. ;)
---
Applied, good luck to everyone! 
---
still banned. no communication from bethesda. I bought a new account on monday. I expect to stay banned for months based on the total lack of communication.
---
Don’t be afraid to ask for someone to team up. There are higher level players with not much to do. I’ll be on in a couple hours on PS4 if you want to grind a bit. 
---
You have my condolences, staring at MODUS for 50 trips is an achievement! 
---
Yea, PSN. He didn't attack me at first, the mafia guy did as he was wanted. I didn't attack for a few minutes til he kinda annoyed me, so I shot back. When I did, the fox guy killed me. So I left it at that, they then proceeded to follow me around, I couldn't fast travel, couldn't go back to my camp. All the while the mafia guy just kept wasting his ammo. 
---
There is no "them".
---
They are part of a hivemind, a singular brain.
---
They are part of an army in the sense of fighting, but the infected people aren't meant to survive a single encounter.
---
They waited because they were told to. By itself. Because "they" are one.
---
The infected are a means to an end, not the end game.
---
I was about to comment that don't work too hard for that weapon. Bethesda fixes all player benefiting glitches pretty fucking fast.
---
They only spawn as low level ghouls, you need a low level player to be in the area to spawn them. I mostly see them in the guest houses when they do spawn.
---
Nope,I am on the cliffs above the mines. I have watched a few nukes hit Whitesprings and recorded them. 
---
Sure but it's not quite the same effect when taking off a vault-Tec jumpsuit. 
---
I agree OP, and I hope the 4 horsemen skins are applicable to other power armors not just the ones we see currently modelled. 
---
Sold!
---
&gt;The playing field needs to be evened somehow, and not just by creating a PVP specific map...
---
Yeah give us a pve specific map with no pvp outside of workshops!
---
Erm, the raiders in the other games didn’t have a choice about being a dick?
---
You seem to think the Scorched have anything to do with people or giant bats.
---
It's a fungi. It's beyond what it posseses.
---
The Beasts don't control the people, the hivemind does, as it does the beasts.
---
They are legion.
---
the first time i was in Helvetia was when i seen it..it walks on two legs when it is not in combat mode..i had no clue what this was..and almost had a heart attack..i remember backing up..and making sure i not try to aggro it...and watched it from a distance..scared
---
I agree that the wendigo was the creepiest creature, even hearing the “tales from the West Virginia hills” for the wendigo was creepy but interesting .
---
No, the shotgun takes 10 seconds to break.  It's other weapons like energy guns, explosives, and heavy guns that take 4 seconds to break.  It's unbalanced as shit already, this would just be a gigantic buff to every common weapon that enemies can use as it would negate the need to ever repair them while doing nothing for already shitty conditioned rare weapons.  Then Bethesda will notice everyone is using shotguns and hunting rifles because repairing weapons is a huge fucking pain in the ass and they will nerf repair costs across the board and completely fuck over half the weapons in the game.
---
If Bethesda ever adds cross platform, you've gotta shoot me an invite and maybe a friend request ingame, this looks awesome!
---
Does anyone know if all the colors can be found there? Is there any like event only colors? Iv found a few already but don’t want to waste time looking for a color I can’t get. 
---
Marsupial works just as well if you ask me lol :)
---
The easy answer for the first point is only allow karma for people who are on your recent players list (and not allow it for people on your friends list.) But hopefully they would test and allow player feedback!
---
Mire lurk king in caves terrifies the shit out of me 
---
I can tolerate NPC raider attacks. But not people who just plain want to annoy you and ruin the game for others. I wouldn't mind but I was going around trying to help people defend outposts. And they started griefing me while I was helping them defend their outpost. 
---
So why did the Scorched wait for the Scorchbeasts at Morgantown?
---
yea it sucks cause i want the outfits that are only available through The Mire events/daily's.
---
I am surprised that there isn't anything like that already, the game encourages selfies and teaming up....I actually never thought about that or noticed until now...
---
Don't use strange in numbers
---
Boohoo. Stop being a crybaby. You’re playing an online game with PvP and roleplaying. 
---
Unpopular opinion: i like it. I mean if the world ended and i had a valuable resource and you supposivly have one id be sketched out, untrusting. I like the how the ability to be conned contributes to the whole "theres a few other people around but youre alone in this wasteland" feel.  Dont get me wrong i get why you dont like it, and maybe if i set up trades ahead of time like you id dislike them just as much. But its kinda cool. 
---
I recommend Thunder Mountain power plant over   Poseidon. Less likely that anyone will try to contest it because it's in a tougher area of the map and is attacked by nastier enemies. 
---
Stealth boy mod for the chest has always been more practical for my play style, sure the jetpacks are fun but how often will you really use it? 
---
Or you can 50 by server hopping
---
I've got no problem with PvP. Assholes, I do have a problem with. 
---
Point in fact, none of my hazmat suits ever break. :)  Even my favorite level 50 prototype.  It's especially nice because it has 1000 rad resistance which is amazing.
---
 its a bit limited compared to the Jet Pack, but yeah for most situations is just as good. I have met people with Marsupial, Bird Bones and a Jet pack and they can fucking fly.
---
 I'll get to mutations in my own sweet time. ;)
---
Best mission in the game, hope we get more like this in the future.
---
Because the hivemind uses the beasts as shock troops.
---
Ground troops supporting air.
---
You do know what "Hivemind" means, yes?
---
All of the Scorched, from a tick, to the SBQ is infected by a fungi.
---
The Fungi controlls all life infected.
---
The beasts are just the biggest,  scariest lifeform in Appalachia, that the fungi has infected.
---
You are far to kind Karth.
---
Wait, can you add armor to your favorites to swap in a quick manner?? :o
---
Huh, I always felt like Fallout was pretty customizable (I'm on PC) compared to most shooters, but I can see where people who are coming from MMOs would be disappointed.  
---
That said, I suspect (based on very little experience with game engines) that that stuff would need some pretty significant engine rebuilding, compared to the things they've got planned.  
---
Does anyone with more game programming experience want to weigh in?
---
Sorry to hear mate. I've been fortunate really and not had to put up with anyone fucking around with me while playing. Maybe just server hop in future if people are persistently trying to piss you off.
---
I know right. So I want to farm these events but I cant. I just love doing the Hoard missions in this area because they always seem to be like a war zone when I spawn in them. Some good times. 
---
Does it grant 100% stealth if unarmed?
---
At first, I thought this was corny, but those last 3 lines really hit me.
---
Actually enjoyed this, thanks for sharing.
---
Good question, maybe they will have an extended shelf life while in the vending mechanism, I don't think completely freezing the condition bar while in there is a good idea it would just become storage for players to exploit .
---
oh the mirelurk king is beyond scary too..deathclaws are scary..but they are a fallout staple..and sooooo fun to fight
---
I found them in the train wagon west of Watoga station
---
 Thank you ... it is. 
---
 As I walked from the Mire for most of those with only 2 server hops per trip it took a long time. ;)
---
That’s...that’s literally what raiders do though. The raider NPCs, if we’re gonna look at it lore-wise, only care about themselves and being dicks to everyone else. 
---
Yesterday I had a large amount of crashes in a short amount of time. Very frustrating. combined with my carelessness it had me lose a few hundred junk scrap. (Die then immediately crash)
---
Yeah, I don’t get why it doesn’t let you inspect items in the trade menu 
---
No problem. Sadly only fists count for unarmed in PA. Be nice to see a raider arm mod or something for PA that took the place of the unarmed weapons.
---
I'm sure this has been suggested before, but I like the idea of the handwritten notes pinned to the map...nice idea!
---
You mean Raiders. You have a problem with Raiders. It’s like you want to hold hands with each player and go frolicking in the meadows of the post-apocalyptic world. Stop bitching. Raiders have always been part of the game. 
---
This is my first time having an issue with anyone, in fairness. I thought maybe they would go away if they saw I wasn't going to fight back. I would have server hopped but I was in control of 3 outposts I was farming. 
---
I've been jumping servers to farm the golf club (during times when it isnt being nuked) and have been running into quite a few level 9 golfing ghouls , usually on sleepy servers when I'm apparently the first person to pop into the white springs golf club.
---
I feel you my friend
---
Ah. Fair enough. I will admit, though, this is actually a really impressive and original idea!
---
You’re looking at it too literally. Let’s say Fallout is real. The NPCs now have choices. Those people then chose to be asshats to everyone. 
---
I'd be happy with crossbow mods and different arrow types
---
Whatever you say buddy
---
My ign is newt341.
---
Do certain types not break? The one I grabbed from Dyer Chemicals degrades really quickly.
---
What is the full name of the plan?
---
I actually like taking Manuguh or whatever it’s called instead of Poseidon. It’s smaller, less players and crowds, and easy to defend. 
---
Always take the freebie on the table if the area is reset and fresh. 
---
Another cheap way to get cores is to kill Sentry bots at Whitesprings then run/server hop. 
---
Just marine helmet or marine tactical helmet?
---
You said it yourself at the beginning, they need to balance the existing weapons first.  People need to seriously stop suggesting a bunch of stuff for them to add that they think would be cool.  People need to start suggesting and demanding fixes.  The time spent on adding new weapons seriously needs to be spent on existing weapons first.  There are already weapons in the game like the LMG that are completely unusable.  They can "add" new weapons just by fixing the ones that no one uses.
---
Yup. Me. Game runs perfect for me everywhere except Charleston. I avoid that whole area as much as I can. I also get crazy frame issues at Morgantown Airport and occasional crashes during SBQ. Guessing it's a Game issue cause I upgraded my rig to play this
---
ADD IT TO THE ORIGINAL POST YOU MONSTER. 
---
**screeches in melee**
---
308 relievers for combat rifle and pipe revolver...
---
But you only get Xp if you shoot each one right?
---
Dude wasteland theme cool.
---
Item trading shouldn't have that. If you want a true wasteland theme, we could kill eachother and loot everything lol.
---
I'm jumping on in a sec if you need some supplies and a base to rest in
---
Yes, the queen counts as a scorched 
---
IGN dannyvrsty
---
Okay thanks, ill be sure to tell my team not to share it lol
---
Well, I *could* help you out, though I’m level eighty...six think? I mean I won’t just kill everything for you, but I’ll help you stay alive and the like. 
---
I'd suggest a bit more than 50... as some weapons can be quite heavy and logging in and out multiple times is a pain.
---
The problem is how big, and of course, would people just use the transfer stash as just another stash?  (I know I do this in other games...)
---
Of course, you could add it into the lore and maybe have secure 'drop site' safes that you can use at Train Stations that have a time limit on them and are accessible to only your account.  Anything you don't collect after X days/weeks gets auto-sold to the train station bot. :P
---
Yeah, i can understand your reluctance to server hop under those circumstances. 
---
He's not a big problem if you're used to his attack style and have some half-decent armor
---
I've noticed more of them since I got my 10. But it was definitely a long time between hitting the 7th before the 8th showed up, probably longer until the 9th, but then the tenner was not too far away. 
---
How so?
---
No, you can't upgrade the level of legendary items. Only some quest item's level can be upgraded, like  the mistress of mysteries quest items.
---
Would be super appreciated, I'm still on the like third mission tho. So still close to the vault 
---
No. You’re doing something wrong. 
---
Thank you! Definite answers like this are really great to hear
---
Hey thanks man! I just took my love of collecting power armor and turned it up to 11. 
---
Yes 
---
Especially considering they could have just done a basic rocket go up in the sky and disappear and that would have been acceptable. They put in extra effort there.
---
How much for a set
---
There are tons of them, they are everywhere. If you’re having trouble finding them then that probably means someone already ran through and took them all.
---
600 for a pair. 
---
since u are not speaking about flux..u can
---
* make sure u have green thumb equipped (2 times all flora picked up)
---
* go to vault 76..pick all of the soot flowers..after 15-20 mins you should have over 100..you can actually do this throughout all of appalachia..not that fun..but there is flora everywhere
---
* go to any area where there are a ton of enemies..clear it out take everything they drop and sell it..a good thing about this is u can possibly get legendaries but will also net a ton of xp
---
* whitespring golf club has a ton of clubs, shirts, skirts..the clothing nets decent caps..sell them
---
Agreed. The only time I've died when I wasn't just fucking around was when I first found the AWOL armaments event and got demolished by the like 7 Gutsies
---
Would also be appreciated for teaching. Could be sort of a mentor
---
Mutations add a completely new dynamic to the game, just like the jet pack. If I happened to get a jet pack before i gotten my mutations you best believe I'd be using it, haha. 
---
If you are on PC, I would be willing to donate an instigating 3\* FatMan to the cause.  
---
Damn I’m sorry to hear that 
---
And the Mantaman gloves. Please!
---
To a degree I can understand such errors in vanilla clothing, but on content you pay for, that shit better be spotless.
---
And as a "would be sweet", perhaps splitting the mantaman suit into the suit and the cape as their own items?
---
For me there are a few issues I have with them. As soon as the ghouls are spawned the turrets will open up on them. When they do this it drags the mobs out through the back door, eventually killing them. This then makes me scramble to get tags on everything before the turrets kill them. In addition the mobs will swarm me while the turrets fire down on them putting me potentially out of reach of something in danger of being killed without me first getting a tag. This is generally easy enough on my ranged character, but still a nuisance. On my melee character, it's even worse because I don't have a decent way to get tags. 
---
Another problem is that if I have a bounty the turrets will actually target me. So not only am I fighting enraged ghouls but I have camp turrets firing down on me. At this point I have no choice but to either leave the area or kill all the turrets. This has been made a bit better with the recent patch, tagging camp parts. Furthermore, if I accidentally attack the owner of the camp the turrets will turn on me (this happens often when fighting mobs with other players).
---
How much for a Jetpack mod?
---
This is the story on how this player's karma became -16.
---
Yeah, for sure man. My Beth.net is Nathan_TK. Should be on tonight, and definitely this weekend. Happy hunting out there in the meantime. 
---
It's weird how instead of hiring testers in the industry, they're laid off and their jobs outsourced to customers...
---
Sweet, shows you're offline.
---
Gt:Fmolina1 
---
500 for a T series, 600 for an X-01
---
Thanks mate 
---
They also gave us a power counter item they probably wanted to work, but it doesnt, as it sends the power all the time. Its not taking advantage of glitch to ruin the experience for others. Its using the nuisances of the building mechanics to make cool stuff.
---
Honestly, the first time I fought a wendigo left my heart racing. It was a ridiculous fight.  
---
But also the Fog Crawlers. The first time I saw one was a random spawn near my camp. It was actually foggy, I remembered hearing something outside, and wandered off into the forest to go deal with whatever spawned. I thought it was dogs or wolves or whatever.  
---
Wander out into the foggy forest, looking around. Suddenly giant scythe bugs walk out from behind a tree.  
---
I got weird looks from my wife because I legit yelled, "WHAT THE FUCK, KILL IT WITH FIRE." in the middle of our living room.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Ok nice, I think I'll test out using zealot melee weapon over anti armor melee weapon against queen, feel like when using maxed incisor perk zealot better option
---
U/srsly_dang ... well TIL
---
Anyone on ps4 have one I'll buy one pm me.
---
Yes - apologies. I tried moving my albums from blogger to imgur and something bad happened I think. Here is a link to the images from this post: https://imgur.com/a/JwZ4HKM and here is one to the build that replaced it: https://imgur.com/a/YwhlvLR . Thanks for the interest. Always enjoy exchanging ideas with fellow builders!
---
It was a sad day for us all
---
My camp was attacked by a low level player.
---
This was after I tried to protect them from a scorch beast and used hundreds of rounds on it. It finally left and I showed this guy where my camp was so he could repair his stuff, even offered to make him new stuff but he declined.
---
I leave him to it, about twenty minutes later I get a message my camp is being attacked and he has a bounty on him.
---
I beat to death a level 15 trying to xp farm in whitesprings. 
---
Sorry not sorry 
---
For reference if you ever level a new toon and want PA early, theres a raider spawn in a locked room on the east(?) end of the bridge above flatwoods that i've only ever seen spawn as level 15. Key is on a dude on the rollercoaster at camden park. 
---
This is coming from the Fallout Wiki but "The Scorched plague also seems to have become symbiotic with the scorchbeasts because these beasts retain their individuality while other infected creatures become part of a hive mind, connecting them to the beasts and giving the beasts the ability to control infected beings to some extent." So it does seem like the Scorchbeasts are handlers of the others, which means there is some strategy and thinking
---
My tactic is to hang out _with_ the turrets so that the mobs getting pulled out the back door helps me. For melee, I like to hang out at the back door in my Tesla armor, which tags each as they come out, with the turrets finishing the job. 
---
Also, I don’t go around killing people and accruing bounties in the first place so that last one doesn’t matter—you can always turn on pacifist mode for the duration of your stay at The Whitespring and avoid the issue altogether.
---
These camps also usually have workbenches, making it easy to scrap and bulk your loot without having to run back to the shops.
---
Seems to me shifting tactics to adapt to the conditions is what’s warranted, not a ban on these camps altogether.
---
Seems legit. 
---
Why though? 
---
I understand the whole raider lore side of things. But some people have zero interest in PvP. 
---
Because he was under leveling the enemies that I came to farm xp for. 
---
Go do the main quest bruh 
---
Oh shit! The more you know!
---
Same issue, have no idea how much I lost, other than a few stable flux
---
This, seeing a van suddenly start charging at you when you're short of ammo and in the open is no joke.
---
Honestly, the first time I fought a wendigo left my heart racing. It was a ridiculous fight.
---
But also the Fog Crawlers. The first time I saw one was a random spawn near my camp. It was actually foggy, I remembered hearing something outside, and wandered off into the forest to go deal with whatever spawned. I thought it was dogs or wolves or whatever.
---
Wander out into the foggy forest, looking around. Suddenly giant scythe bugs walk out from behind a tree.
---
I got weird looks from my wife because I legit yelled, "WHAT THE FUCK, KILL IT WITH FIRE." in the middle of our living room
---
You were defending on to something the other night, guess I still have some remodeling to do 
---
Then it's bad writing. Bethesda having cake and eating it, too.
---
The Hive, if it's an actual hive, which the game states it is, has then given leeway to the beasts, because it can't entirely control them.
---
Problem is, the entire plot logic is now extremely flawed.
---
So either the Beasts happen to want to kill everything, and the Hive goads them towards it, allowing them control over localized forces, or Bethesda has a bad concept of hiveminds.
---
Symbiosis with the Beasts still doesn't chance the fact that armoring the Scorched goes against the Hive's intent and survival.
---
Perfectly - I guess I come from an opposite perspective.  I like how pistols are understated in size but dangerous in action.  It feels wonky to me to have a giant gun that I would want to be moving around like a bullet ninja.  I suppose it's why I liked the deliverer so much.  Small but potent.  The revolver's look appropriately weighted but I prefer semi-automatics in form.
---
The energy pistols are just crazy huge.  Especially if you put more advanced barrels on them.  The look is good! The size just burns the shit out of my fourth wall.
---
The fungus was already ridiculous itself, there are no examples of a fungi making decisions like that, all fungus spreads in the simplest most efficient way possible. I wouldn't have liked the idea of a "thinking fungus" anyway and would have called it bad writing too
---
You'd probably have to continuously yield for every play period selling whatever you can within that time frame. 
---
Throughout the fallout games, the fat man was a feared weapon of the wasteland. But in 76 it is a peashooter 
---
this game isnt for kids fucknut who cares what parents think lmao
---
Well, here's the thing. I don't have any problems killing the mobs, I don't need the assistance of the turrets and I don't want it. Without them I don't have the headache of making sure I tag everything. I'd rather just kill it on my own at my own leisure. 
---
I do occasionally get a bounty. And I like engaging in pvp, so turning pacifist on is gonna be a no go for me.
---
To be clear, I didn't call for a ban of them. I just said I think they're annoying and will kill them if I see them. Take that one up with the Bethesda employee who responded, who also didn't explicitly say they are going to be banned.
---
It doesn't think. It's biological imperitive.
---
Google it, there's a species of fungi that does exactly this to insects.
---
Luckily it cannot pass species barriers beyond what it can...so far.
---
Your problem is in thinking that it thinks.
---
It doesn't. It's not sentient.
---
get to loot them twice if youre fast :) 
---
Thanks for all the info guys!!!! All make another run when i'm higher level still would like to solo it if possible. Spent a lot of time with those turrets!!!! Once again thanks!!!! 
---
The Scorched waiting on the scorchbeasts shows actual strategic thinking, a real fungus trying to spread as efficiently as possible wouldn't have waited like that
---
do you post to Australia?? 
---
Have explosive guns been completely removed from loot pools?
---
A laugh emote and a dance would be swell
---
Ha, if they could pull that off, more power to them, but I would think being associated with raiders would bring your Karma down pretty quick!
---
I don’t think Fallout is the right game for you. 
---
And you were preventing the unruly golfers from spawning.
---
Go nuke fissure prime bruh
---
But these raiders never wield pipe weapons while wearing sack hoods and harnesses it’s immersion breaking.
---
Deathclaw sanctuary, FONV
---
False. It simply reacted to not being able to conteol the beasts.
---
You're not getting the point. The Scorched are ONE ENTITY.
---
There is no compartmentalizing the people from the beasts. This is all one action by one entity, as part of one strategy. Consume.
---
It's reacting, naturally, to resistance, not "thinking".
---
Playing with marsupial is a game changer. 
---
Yeah cross referencing to out of game tables suck.
---
I started a subreddit just for fallout 76 updates and to report bugs and post features I believe everyone would want in the game. I do massively dislike when someone joins a subreddit to troll and non stop hate on it while others are just trying to enjoy the game. Hopefully I can help out with managing this subreddit 
---
A dog knows when it's hungry. It doesn't think it needs to eat.
---
It knows. Your perceived intelligence of the fungi doesn't change the fact that what you see as intelligence, is not sentience.
---
If the strategy is consume, then why would the Scorch not march straight to the airport?
---
It’s the game Bethesda wanted, not the game you wanted. 
---
Them sum'bitches need ta get 'er done!
---
This, and a slightly see through circle on the map resembling the radius would be nice.  I also frequently get told "no artillery available", when I do in fact have one hooked up to power.
---
I wasn’t aware it was a full 20 hours after the first purchase. I just figured they had synced it to reset with the daily atom challenges timer.
---
For me it's more leisurely to tag and let the turrets complete the takedown- makes farming there easier.
---
I generally run around in pacifist mode to avoid accidental "friendly fire" bounties, turning it off when I find someone with a bounty that needs collectin'! 
---
So I think we'd get along just fine in-game: I get to use the turrets and collect bounties, and you get to smash up the camps to your heart's content.
---
Upvoted for much needed QoL feature
---
Why suffer the loss of mass? The Beasts .ake consumption easier. You do understand, that if we had never stopped the plague, and it consumed all, it still wouldn't control the beasts, right?
---
At that point, it would have to destroy them, bevause the beasts would become it's final femaining threat. 
---
Not that i have researched it, but in previous games it's a matter of charisma/perks to get better prices
---
Yeah it adds a star in that is something funky that modifies the weapon but it’s pretty weak / poor. You can also buy all the mods from the firehouse. 
---
Why stop at turrets/generator? I destroy anything in camp that can be destroyed, walls and anything else. I always close the downstairs doors too, it pleases me to do these things
---
I would probably assume putting a price on an item to trade would work. 4K caps or so then they put the same price and everyone walks out at least winning. So if they do try to scam you, you don’t lose it all. Of course I do t trade much. I have only sold a few things but never item for item. It just seems like this would be a logical way to prevent scamming, unless you are at max caps. Just my. $0.02 as someone that does not trade. 
---
Processing ... processing ... mandatory coffee break ... processing ... mandatory crash ... have a nice day
---
You can establish communication. Most folks even without mic have area chat on. They'll hear you. Throw a "Jump Once if you can hear me" then once you know they can hear you then you can take a guess at the emotes in response to your questions.
---
Love my jet pack. The medic one is ok (but I’d like to be able to put that on any limb, as with armor) but generally I go for +2 STR.
---
I have been toying w/ the Tesla one as a tagging mechanism in nuke zones.
---
power armor has been a staple of the franchise, personally I love the option to run around in a tank, that said, it is almost necessary in this game, whereas the other games there were other builds that were just as viable
---
I think another work around would be to have the vendors keep the exact amount of caps you give them. For example I buy something for 100 caps. That vendor should have an extra 100 caps for me to buy back. That would at least give us more options.
---
You forgot the best gun in any fallout, That Gun!
---
I raised this very same suggestion here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aukk43/suggestion_allow_bulk_reset_of_all_special/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
This is wat ive been waiting for. Make missile launchers and fat mans viable
---
I see that the fallout 76 edition of the xbox one x is 100 bucks off right now which is why i'm thinking about getting a new one.  Don't need another copy of the game but I'll still take the discount.
---
I said something because I was sick of the argument "this is fallout 4 with coop stop complaining you got what you wanted", no it's not what we wanted, its a survival game it's completely different. That is where my comment started and ended. No one can use that argument at all, it has no legs to stand on. It's that simple. You completely brought it off topic and started having a go at me. You mentioned features were missing etc. It was fantastic and fun with afew mates, but we all know it is missing stuff. I wasn't defending the state of the game, I was just stating this comparison is a load of bollix.
---
But this is over something said about 4 months ago, fuck it pal I genuinely don't give a shit anymore. I hope all is good with you and you're playing some new shit. Try metro exodus its fucking class.
---
Anyway peace out pal me no spek englo v gud

Right as he said go, the scorchbeast's body landed on the silo door.
---
And my bow
---
The first time I faced nightkin in the basement of Repconn in NV scared the dickens out of me
---
There are a few I really tense / worry about even though I’m generally able to deal with them all now.
---
Wendigo
---
Legendary Gutsy
---
Flipping bears who get you in a minor stun lock
---
Ticks
---
Nasty giant mosquitos
---
I already included it. Its the .223/5.56mm pistol. "That Gun" was just a unique variant of it.
---
 PC is my way. ;)
---
That’s great! Thanks for sharing!
---
What would be nice is an loot opt in system that would allow players to specify their "spec" or preferred loot type, But only being able to select from Heavy, Explosive, Commando, Rifleman, Guerilla, Slugger, Pistol, Unarmed or Gladiator types.
---
Even if the system simply checked what cards you had equipped and increased the chance of finding Rifles if you had more rifle cards than any other perhaps.
---
Ah, gottcha...if you were on xb1 I'd hook you up with some free mutations 
---
Oh man that would be AWESOME.
---
Don't get me wrong, I use T-51b Armor and that Pale Rider looks sweet. But it would be great if I also had the option to use the Plague Rider!
---
Gatling plasma is king... if it didn't break after 25 seconds. Neat balance bethesda.
---
Are these ghouls dressed in golfing outfits, or just named differently? I have one killed and was wondering the same thing
---
Wendigos took some time to get used to. Farming the Golf Club got me used to them. I’m just glad that I don’t have to wear the clown outfit again. 
---
Tbh, and this might get downvoted by NV Boys *cough all of r/Fallout* but I'm pretty sure for all the guns you listed, we don't need that many in the entire game. We already have tons, and id rather not get another piece of shit pistol, e.g. the Colt or another revolver. We already have the regular one and I think the western one? And from what I remember in NV, hence the top of this comment, is that all the guns were pretty much the same, except dealt a bit more damage and has some small changes. So then, if I can get a Cowboy repeater as often as a lower tier version, then what's the point? For example pipe weapons. Good early game but literally no use mid game and onwards, despite some challenge or roleplaying aspect. Sure their ammo is common but they can barely put a dent compared to a .308 or lever action. 
---
And all those laser and plasma weapons would be cool! if those guns already in the game weren't so neutered. 
---
I’m saving as much of my legendary stuff as I can for the new vendor they mentioned in the roadmap. Could be worth hanging on to that piece if you like it in case you are able to do something fun with it. Worst case, you used up some stash space for a few weeks. 
---
Here’s what I did when that happened to me: they followed me all around. I found a nest of enemies that was stronger than them, and led those idiots right into the nest. Watched them get murdered and did nothing to help. Then logged out and back in. 
---
Lol you win
---
They all look great, except the helmet on the t60...I dunno why, but I just can't stand the way it looks...I'd definitely have to use my Blackbird paint on it if I can't use the 4H paints on different models. 
---
Na, he didn't reply straight on my post, he started a chat with me directly. So i can't negative karma him. Although, I could write about our nice transaction lol.
---
Should share the name, let us know who this scum bag is and publicly shame him. Its the only recourse these days. It also warns others to avoid him. Good read, thanks for sharing. 
---
The Mirelurk Queen for sure, I triggered bloody mess on the last one I killed, it was truly nasty. 
---
 Well thanks for the thought. ;) I have to get some perks in order to do it and I'm still leveling other perks. 
---
 I have 2 Luck and I think that should be enough for the 2 Starched Genes and then Class Freak 2 as well. I'm not sure actually. ;)
---
Correct, turrets killing enemies helps no one.
---
I frequently go to West Tek, and there is always a suicide mutant out front.  If I shoot his hand and get it to go off, I would expect the whole of the area to be a mini nuke zone, complete with rads, and absolutely destroy any non legendary enemies...but even the mutants he is passing the pipe with don't die when I sniper his hand.  
---
Buff mini nukes in a huge way. 
---
 5.56mm or 7.62mm Chinese Assault Rifle (F3)  for the win.  LOVE this weapon in FO3..
---
You got chat muted? Can't tell if you can hear me
---
I cant hear you no
---
If your trying to trade with people with only one or two of the scrap your looking for your trying to trade with the wrong people imo
---
That’s the point of workshops. It even warns you about pvp before you capture it yourself.
---
What if the first person to go first pays a certain amount of caps (a reasonable amount but worth the item at least) then when you go you pay that amount directly back for their item? So it obviously clears its self out. I get that wouldn’t work on most occasions but something to make the first to trade have some sort of insurance maybe.
