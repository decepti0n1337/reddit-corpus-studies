Also thankyou 
---
---
---
Brotherhood made Ad victoriam. It means something I just can‚Äôt remember what
---
It‚Äôs kinda bland, don‚Äôt ya think?
---
It's really nice the west virginia one is ugly af imo
---
It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to leave it more than a day, or maybe bring it back for a day every now and again
---
A poor accounting of a mundane pvp exchange 
---
A code would help me not depend on that damn disc 
---
Its decent.  I currently have it.  Nothing special though really . Wish it was a bit darker in color 
---
What's underneath the blackout? Can you reveal please?
---
What do you need for it ? 
---
Looks like a watermelon , kinda wanna get it since it‚Äôs limited but aesthetically don‚Äôt see it shining on any variant.
---

---
Somebody convince to get it , or not lol 
---
You are my hero 
---
I have marsupial, but a friend of mine who does NOT have marsupial jumped straight across to the ledge and got the keycard fist try no issues. 
---
I agree! I‚Äôm going back to my vault boy paint. 
---
Your opinion =/= the entire core fanbase. Also, 1, 2 and New Vegas weren't done by Bethesda. Bethesda did 3, had Obsidian do New Vegas, and then did 4 and FO 76. They did the entire Elder Scrolls series though.
---
They the FO76 market subreddit or Looking for Group from the multiplayer tab on xbox (or the app)
---
When in doubt get one variant of each you won‚Äôt regret it 
---
that's pretty cool
---
Well the fermenter only allows you so much you can ferment at a time.
---
A fridge would be along this line. You can store a limited amount of food in it. 
---
You‚Äôd still be limited by the stash limit total, so that prevents hoarding like your thinking.
---
So it‚Äôs not a bypass the mechanics as a way to manage resources. Which do you want to save for  later (like cooked scorch beady parts)?
---
Get yourself a bloodied handmade.  Explosive proffered.  Full commando perks in perception as well as nerd rage.  Just make sure you get the first shot.   Also full sentinel armor would help alot , but impossible to find unless bought.  Another good option would be an Anti-Armor explosive handmade 
---
Not to mention most of the complaints were because it was different. Which is stupid, because if you want a game just like FO3, go play FO3. Same with New Vegas, or FO4. If you want a game EXACTLY like another game, then go play the other game. That wasn't a majority of the fanbase. That was the vocal minority. Very easy mistake to make, people make it in politics all the time.
---
Grahm sells them, but he may not always have them in stock. They're also a possible reward from claiming workshops and can randomly be found in some toolboxes.
---
I am assuming by ‚Äúbase captured‚Äù you mean that a/the player(s) arrives at a Workshop you currently controlled and are paying caps to gain control of said Workshop, initiating pvp.
---
If so, this is working as intended. 
---
Workshops were designed as a map feature to allow players to have an ability to acquire certain items at a faster rate as the cost of paying a few caps up front, as well as willingly subjecting yourself to potential pvp. These are intentional game mechanics that cause intended player interactions.
---
When a player pays to control any workshop on the map, he or she has virtually flagged themselves for PVP. The immediate effect of you being flagged takes place when another player enters the vicinity of your workshop and is able to pay caps to claim it for themselves. 
---
They cannot always do this right away though. If there are things like an Event going on they will have to wait until its over. If there are enemies in the area, enemies must be cleared before a workshop can be claimed, even if it is already currently claimed by you or whomever. 
---
What will happen next is, said player (&amp; their friends) will immediately find and kill you if they didn‚Äôt already know where you were. In most cases, they may have already scouted you and have a shooter already on your location. 
---
Here‚Äôs the tricky part. 
---
If your level is high enough in the cap gains of your death vs cost of claiming the bench, said player will run outside of the claimed workshop they just paid for, leaving control back to you when the timer resets.
---
As soon as your location has been re-discovered, (you respawn in location) they will again claim the bench, and kill you again. Wash repeat. Draining you for caps equal to your level upon each death. 
---
You get one shot cuz people have good weps, an hell they even just make strong builds with good synergy. Doubt any cheating happened from your description though.
---
Personally I find the system is flawed when it comes to workbench pvp as well as the whole caps based upon level thing, but I don‚Äôt mind either cuz I don‚Äôt claim benches unless I have a team going ready to fight.
---
Hope this helped! &amp; Watch out!
---
Hey what ur price.
---
Already got a 2* furious cryo with 20%faster fire rate
---
Rare but not impossible like a bloodied explosive weapon is to find lol.   I have found a few and I farm a ton 
---
Awesome will check it out thanks!
---
Yeh no yoi say that so did I got a 2 shot Gatling laser.
---
Must be just explosive they removed
---
 A while ago i had a deathclaw but it was killed when my camp was attacked by raiders
---
I figured it out, the stairs were bugged and I had to store and place it again. Thanks though.
---
From hiw I have seen and understand it is melee only
---
I've been comboing Sunkissed with Ghoulish.
---
It keeps my health topped off and removes rads at a fairly reasonable rate, I only really need to worry about hunger/thirst...hence my love of melons.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I have another character with a luck build and she's loaded with Dog Food.  Pretty sure she's forgotten what regular food tastes like.  LoL
---
I currently have an almost complete assasins gear , and I have 3 of these weight reduction ones , one with a ammo reduction for 20 and another for junk reduction ,  so as for bloodies I had gotten 3 worth keeping weapons but only a handmade level 25 
---
If you need help you can join on me whenever.  Name is the same as it shows here.  
---
Grahm sells them, but doesn't have them every time. They're also a possible random reward for claiming workshops.
---
‚ù§Ô∏èüíïü•∞üòòüéàüå∏
---
My man!
---
Maybe you have to come from away?  My camp is east of whitesprings and I hop to 76 when going to that side of the map to save caps. Once a day when I "materialize" at 76 it fires. 
---
I second that notion.
---
You‚Äôre able to move it, but unmoved, it should be in the direct center.
---
I know they made it and said it throughout fallout 4, I'm wondering if it was used before or if it was something elder maxson junior made up
---
Bar is closing soon. No customers thus far, so maybe bring a friend. Gonna be open for less than an hour.
---
The original guys made it. It says in for defiance
---
It‚Äôs melee only.
---
Fort*
---
Good catch! This really well explains it all, and it also makes sense if you reason that they fucked it up in attempting to tweak fermentation rates
---
They sent an email notifying people that they were suspended. I thought it was pretty noticeable when they started to suspend accounts. 
---
I still need the plans for the arms
---
Couldn't tell if that was sarcasm. Either way, bar is closing in less than an hour.
---
Wow I know this is old but how many times can that happen? Like what if I need a peaceful trading area? Can I kill my pet multiple times and will come back every time?
---
Nooooooooooo! My Flash rp is ruined!!! 
---
just exit and re-enter workshop mode fixes it for me.
---
Hey there what's your screen name you said you would be on tonight to be able to sell me D marine armor plans for the arms
---
I was server hopping for the plans (1 plan, I'm not collecting multiples to make a plan blanket or whatever) with the key and it took about 30 tries, where I was unlocking doors to do it. So if the plan respawns I'd imagine it could spawn in after I left to try a different server.
---
Thanks for pointing this out, much of the weapon weights don‚Äôt make sense.
---
There was a hotfix to address an issue with nuke launch timers. 
---
Yeah, it's a real bummer. I too wanted to go fast once... :'(
---
I have a related question... does anyone know now how to get rid of your pet permanently?
---
Got keycard 1 but on the little ledge where keycard 2 is supposed to be, there‚Äôs only a trifold US flag, I server hopped a few times, no keycard 2 üíî

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

You can get the plans in dome 3
---
This has got to be a troll. 
---
Yeah... Legendary drops are broken in so many ways still üôÅ they took the first step last patch though
---
My plasma Gatling was pretty effective at Whitesprings during a nuke zone.  Chewed through the ammo like an SOB though...
---
Missing my point. I like this game. Wasn't my opinion. You're out of touch with the core fanbase. People have been asking for traditional Beth games with Co op since 2007. If you can't see that then you're just blind. Dunno whay else to tell you. 
---
500! Sweet deal no wonder lots of peeps were server hopping , yet again I‚Äôve spent close to 2k caps nailing the process right until I was able to get the dome key 
---
Well, there goes my whole night!
---
I was just gonna post and ask if the camp kill switch had been fixed today.
---
Clearly not üôÑ
---
Last time i went at Camden to check them, there were two invincible bloatflies.
---
Does this mean like not been in a group with you ever or just for that session? I‚Äôm about to kill my pet tonight üò¢
---
Many didnt get one. There were numerous posts of people who just got the error code
---
Probably because if we could we would have been on reddit complaining that the recipes were using our purified water
---
That's kinda funny.
---
Omg. 126 days later, and this is still a ball ache. I‚Äôve been stuck on this for 20mins too. Then I saw the above comment about pressing enter after logging in to claim promotion. There‚Äôs no other time u need to do that, and it doesn‚Äôt tell u on screen either. Lol, what a pain. This for asking this question because otherwise my monitor would have flown across the room lol.
---
Question... is this necessary to do the pvp first or can your friend just kill it while not being on your team?
---
Different ranks for the t60 paints ?
---
Its an atom challenge and k.
---
So in the book that came out a while back there was steps on how to complete this quest that came out last night?
---
I always forget about this. :/
---
Yeah I've had initiate and knight cpt and now knight sgt
---
What platform are you on?
---
Hear our cries!
---
It's called Deathclaw Island
---
Interesting analysis. I think Build Order might be a factor as well. 
---
Strong Back is a perk that becomes available at level 26, whereas Travelling Pharmacy and Thru-hiker can BOTH be fully leveled up by level 9.
---
I also consider "carry" items (chems + food) vs. "stash" items (junk and ammo).  Thus i tend not to take Pack Rat, since it only affects junk while you are carrying it, and the game has so many workbenches to scrap with.  Every once in a while I try to purge the more useless junk that accumulates when I'm not paying attention (at one point, I had over 400 raw asbestos... I don't think I could ever use all of that even if I was a full time Armorsmith). 
---
The nice thing about the swap-able perks (particularly later game) is being able to tweak and experiment to see what helps more. :)   
---
I've also picked up a couple of armor pieces with weight reduction legendary effects. Very hard to trade those out... ;) 
---
J.J.A.\* meetings will be held each Tuesday at the meeting room in Flatwoods.   
---
(\* Junk Junkies Anonymous. Our twelve step program can help you overcome that scrapping and hoarding problem that bothers so many of ... excuse me, is that a CARLISLE Typewriter behind you? Let me just pick it up for a second...)
---
 
---
I'm pretty sure one of the free staters mention. A device that can bring down a scorch beast and prevent it from flying away. I was expecting we would unlock them to craft, the lore is their for such a device. Unless I'm remembering wrong, in which case ignore me 
---
Flamer fuel. Just search this reddit for flamer fuel. Please look into this issue. 
---
There's not the steps how to complete this there is a guide on where to find the notes that tell you how to do this. I'll see if I can get him to send me a pic tonight of the page
---
also just because it came out last night doesn't mean they weren't working on it or had it planned before the book also includes all the new stuff that's coming out including the sheepsquatch and aliens that are not in the game yet. 
---
It was the official guide not some random guy to put out by a random company this is bethesda's guide
---
Somebody posted this early on when 76 released. I think it's great.
---

Good to know. Thanks!
---
Why does the short barrel weigh more than the long barrel? Because Bethesda...
---
Eating nachos and watching futurama with my wife and kid. Won't be on for a while lol 
---
I got one from grafton 
---
Yay!
---
Xbox
---
I never mentioned feelings but if they aren‚Äôt fighting back then you are just being a shit. 
---
I will go stash my stuff and meet you 
---
Starts this quest.   
---
Server disconnects.   
---
Stuff gone forever.   
---
Perhaps a bit pessimistic, but a real possibility. 
---
I have a 3 star leg that has +1 strength, health regen in non combat, and 20% weight reduction of weapons. Sick üôÇ
---
I love being nude in fissure prime. Really gets my juices flowing.
---
I got an extra for anyone on Xbox 
---
Alright, my gt is a7xogg. I'll b on 2-6pm est. I'll go ahead and add you and join ur server if ur already on when I get on.
---
grats, where do you get them ?
---
If thats true then im definitely gonna get one if i still can. Kinda bad how bethisda would give you steps on how to start a quest when its not even in the game yet throwing a lot of people off.
---
Check back Monday afternoon, eastern US time. Also, Seymour is best boy.
---
IMO there‚Äôs more sense on carrying lots of weapons rather then having an unyielding set 
---
I just got one yesterday and I was happy now I realize there‚Äôs more then one lol 
---
Savage divide is level 1-99, so if someone lower level than you just went before you then the spawns will be lower until enough time has passed for them to respawn. There's a map of what level each zone is, let me see if I can find it...
---
Weapon weight is a balancing mechanism and isn‚Äôt realistic at all.
---
Name same as reddit.
---
Hey can I buy it from ya? NY Steezy
---
I was helping a buddy build his camp right before servers went down for the hot fix. We still had budget before it went down, but when he logged back in later to keep building, he removed a box and wasn't able to replace it due to being "over budget". Has anyone else encountered a similar issue?
---
Wish I had as much luck, have been on 20 servers so far, and they are gone. I got locked inside the keypad room the first time.
---
Im so happy I can make my own whiskey and everyone is looking for nuka qantum‚Äôs to make nukashine or hunting the new nuka quantum paint job. And a new daily quest that gives recipes and new plans. 
---
I was actually looking up buying one myself right now I messaged him he said he'll get me a picture when he gets home but it's license Bethesda and put out by prima I believe he said.
---
When he bought it apparently it was a hundred and fifty Canadian. 
---
And it's in one of the side quest things. 
---
The guide also shows you the four horsemen of apocalypse power armor paint jobs that aren't out yet I was hoping they came up with this update but they probably won't be out till the summer. 
---
when I get a pic or at least the exact name of the book I'll send you a message with it
---
I mean caps are happily accepted but I was giving it out for free lol 
---
And AFAIK there's no real good spots to camp out at. For seclusion, sure. But resource wise, it's not much to go on.
---
Awesome! Those two look to be right up my alley, thank you. 
---
Omfg no please wait I‚Äôm running late. I‚Äôll be there in 27.5 mins. Please don‚Äôt close!
---
Shooting will only degrade armor IF you are using a explosive weapon. A rocket, grenade launcher, or your favorite weapon that has the explosive legendary effect will degrade/wear down your armor ONLY if you damage yourself with said splash from the weapons. 
---
Thanks. Still can't find it. I think I moved it ages ago, but can't remember where or see it anymore. 
---
Ok can I buy it from ya then :) 1000 caps 
---
Seems I joined the wrong server.  Someone else added me I thought it was you lol 
---
You think there are more?
---
What platform are you on? I could paint yours for you on Xbox. I'm sure after a few days the hype will calm down and it will be easier to do. I was surprised it was so easy but I did it at 2-3 pm eastern 
---
Get plans from FO76market sub or LFGs
---
Eh. Pretty expected. I mean, it's noble you didn't take his loot, but you're also justified in taking his as retaliation of his breaking the 'gentleman's agreement' on loot.
---
That sounds like a great idea
---
Joining on now.  Do you want to kill me to revive me ?
---
I still wish I had got the fruit basket hat.  I never would have worn it, but it would have been nice to have.
---
My point is that just because you agree with a handful of people doesn't make you guys the core fanbase. The people you see stomping their feet are the vocal minority. Not the majority.
---
I'm on ps4
---
Thanks so much! Have a great weekend!
---
Kk are you in now?
---
Just tried that, no good
---
Can double confirm this issue. My husband and I were doing a nuke run the last 2 nights and we had gutsys, protectrons, and assaultrons exploding. They make a beeping noise for about 3 seconds and bam, they explode. I just thought it was a new mechanic.
---
making sure you always got one or two o those in your bag for when you needa haul extra loot is amazing.
---
even more so since it cant spoil
---
it‚Äôll scrap the current paint which is: none. if you equip a paint it won‚Äôt effect any other mods expect for the paint, which in this case is none. 
---
Doesnt appear to change any of the effects. Im on PC with all mods disabled, still happens.
---
Finishing a movie lol 
---
Sorry! Bar had to close. Personal events going on in life. I'll be on Monday afternoon, eastern time.
---
I guess I forgot to mention I have the vault tec paint. So it'll just remove the vault tec paint and not my jetpack? 
---
Fallout: Hotline Miami Edition. Great pic!
---
it‚Äôll remove the paint and the paint alone 
---
Thanks, I've been in Fullscreen and fine until the update. I'll be interested in that thread sure.
---
Lol hope your bar doesn‚Äôt burn to the ground in a fermentation accident. 
---
They did say that up till now a lot of items were lasting longer than intended, so maybe everything is finally spoiling when it's supposed to and we just aren't used to it.
---
Thanks I just tried this so we'll see how it goes!
---
This is odd... As if they haven't added the ingredients yet?
---
My two guesses would be Ash Roses, and also Thistles (Although there are literally like 4 plants in the whole world, fuck knows why).
---
I could be entirely wrong, but shooting a weapon that does not produce some sort of AOF from explosives shouldn‚Äôt damage your armor. 
---
Yeah, and it's not like you can get the plans any other way, IIRC. Like, I basically just got a more reliable way to make whiskey while everyone else gets alcohols that increase their damage output or makes them temporarily invincible or whatever the new effects are. The fact it's been present since the game's release is even more upsetting, too.
---
Thanks, I was worried. 
---
I know this is already answered, but it‚Äôll only scrap whatever you are changing. No way would it scrap a jet pack while changing paint. 
---
Fallout isn‚Äôt about happy, relaxation
---
In West Virginia?
---
They were available during Christmas. Maybe they‚Äôll release them again during Christmas later this year. 
---
'Sweating nevrously' That... Definitely hasn't happened to me before.
---
Why have I never thought of this? I‚Äôm making low level stuff for newbies all the time and they always run away from me. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm always in either the ritual mask or X-01 armor with glowing red eyes and have a flaming pitchfork equipped? No, they‚Äôre just nervous nellies 
---
Haha ok lmk when you‚Äôre done :)
---
A few fish ideas  
---
**Salmon**
---
info: fished in any river source.
---
food raw: 15% food, 5% disease chance  
---
food cooked: 15% food. (only fish to not have rads.  
---
**CAT FISH**
---
info: fished in any lake source. rare and requires stink bait
---
food raw: 30%, 100 rads, 30% disease chance
---
food cooked: 10%, 5 rads. When cooked provides 5 catfish strips. (so 50% from one)
---
meals
---
* deep fried catfish bites: requires one cat fish, 10 oil, 2 spices, one strangler pod. gives 10 deep fried catfish bites which fill 15% hunger and give +1 to strength, +10% damage against mirelurks, and +10 poison resistance.
---
  
---
**Glowing cat fish**
---
info: like standard catfish is fished in any lake. Requires glowing lure bait.
---
food raw: 50%, 500 rads, 100% disease chance.
---
Food cooked: same as normal but when cooked gives 15 strips and two glowing meat.
---
OTHER: can "butchered" at a chem station for scales and bones which are worth a lot of nuclear material and balistic fiber.   
---
Have you played New Vegas?
---
I am on Xbox, would be nice of you. I just got sniped for it.
---
I'm on now, GT Captain Itis. I'm not actually sure how it works but I guess if you trade me the pieces I will color them and trade them back. no charge.
---
Thank you for providing this guide.
---
Let me offer a few clarifications to others doing this quest:
---
* Once you get the keys to TNT Dome 7, you can sever hop until you can find the plans inside the dome
---
* The keys are named  "TNT Dome Key 7" in your MISC inventory
---
* The doors may be open or closed on the server you hop onto to find the plans, this does not determine if someone has already taken the plans. 
---
* It may be beneficial to use your friends list to hop servers by joining them as well as just quiting and rejoining since the VMs that you'll connect to may not be performance/location based (you'll hop to servers in a different data center)
---
* It took me about 30 hops to find the plans
---
thank you
---
It‚Äôs a glitch happening to many of us. Bethesda won‚Äôt even acknowledge it after mentioning it repeatedly the past 2 days. Keep your camp simple for now until they fix it. The game is confusing no build zones with someone being in your camp spot and deleting camps saying it‚Äôs a no build zone. 
---
no new dailys anywhere on the map for me since the update :(
---
Yep, unfortunately released only in a large package at Christmas. There's always the plain blinking lights. They also had red and white 1s limited time at Valentines. Maybe they could be re-released at Easter?
---
Same! I've observed at Harpers Ferry near the vendor bot, and on the WS golf course, heading north from the south fence (past a small cave with a yao-guai) my fps goes from like 120 straight down to 40. Really bad that they're managing to implement this...
---
The one clue I have is that if I continue walking through the laggy areas out the other side, eventually it'll return to normal, if I then go back to the laggy areas, they'll perform as normal until next time.
---
How sounds 2k + some ultracite, if you have
---
I would guess it just means someone who is not a friend or teammate, i'm going to just try and find someone to do it. I had a new friend drop over for a trade today and he couldn't do any damage to it. So based on that it may have to be a random player on the server who's willing to take the bounty. I'm just pissed that they don't seem to see this as an issue or bug. Considering the number of posts here on just this problem I can't believe they are saying "too bad, so sad, just deal with it" to paraphrase.
---
Really? I must have missed those post, but that sucks if that's the case
---
That is true
---
Sent ya a message and a request says you are offline
---
Weird because I just saw your friend request. I'll join your game.
---
I would say it‚Äôs more like a slab 
---
Farm bears! 
---
I think there are a lot of people doing that, also like any world spawn item a character can only get one every like 24 hours from every individual spawn point just like caps stashes. So if you want to get a second to sell it or something you probably need to wait a day. 
---
Go check out the r/fo76filthycasuals sub.  You will find many people to play with there. 
---
It has to be a regular ole whiskey
---
Did you try ferment it? 
---
The app doesn‚Äôt even fully work with 4, Far Har and Nuka World maps don‚Äôt work correctly 
---
Ok üëç there‚Äôs like 10 mins left
---
I just saw your reply, I will stay in this server, come to the train car north of white spring station.
---
"The player can cast the sports rod at any body of water. Shoot casts, reload reels in..."
---
I liked the idea, sounds fun to me. Especially if you get some sort of permanent alcohol related buff at the end of all of it.
---
"acting badly to other people"
---
Do onto others as you would do onto yourself. The golden rule. 
---
I simply do not empathize with players being upset witht he way i play the game. I dont think i even have to, or that im supposed to. 
---
Players getting upset is the bad behavior. I shouldnt enable it, encourage or even acknowledge it. You guys cant walk into a game and decide you wont follow the rules, and i have to treat you special. Kind of arrogant isnt it? Its your duty to hops server and run away. Because you are choosing to opt out of PvP.
---
How am i supposed to know whose ok and whose not ok with PvP anyway?
---
Please wreck my camp. Id be happy to host a PvP battle. I will extend the same courtesy to you.  The golden rule. 
---
Please leave your emotions aside when playing rated MA multiplayer pvp games. Its not my job to manage them. Im just playing a fun online pvp game. Nothing shitty about it. Theres no greifing going on. Frankly the whole attitude that your entitled to pacifists *even though its not in the game* is arrogant and dilusional from my perspective.
---
I just got mine to work. At first, I sneaked normal. Killed all sorts of things. No effect.
---
I took off my chameleon gear. Success. If you're wearing any, test that. 
---
Dang, that‚Äôs cool that putting your weapon in worked tho. That‚Äôs good to know! 
---
Man that needs a video just for the lulz
---
Building bars:  use dressers turned backwards.  I used the ones that are also stash boxes.  
---
Almost 100 sure we will get all the ranks available on creation club 
---
Anybody got a pic of the paint?
---
You got me good. 
---
The players aren‚Äôt breaking the rules of the game by killing your camp. Yes they don‚Äôt gain anything out of it unless they farm you but they certainly aren‚Äôt breaking the rules by being a dick to you. What you are saying is the rules should be changed so that players cant harm you. And thats fine you are entitled to your opinion, im just saying that it makes for a boring experience if everything that happens to you is good and thats my opinion.
---
These must be the sneak nerfs. üòÇü§£
---
There's lots of casual fun there. No age restriction.
---
thank you.  I've been leaving those in there for nothing Appreciate the clarity.
---
I want it! Won't be on for a little bit. Any pics of it?
---
You may have to scrap it all by just putting your camp down again and start over, which as a base builder like you I would be real pissed at having to do, mine take 4-7 hours to build, the first foundation alone may take a couple hours to get in just the right orientation. I feel for ya dude.
---
The key card is under the flag.
---
Actually, the plans are in the leveled lists for food containers.  So basically, any cooler or anything that sometimes gives a recipe can also sometimes give one of these recipes.  Or at least should.
---
Most important thing to me
---
I hope this is true. Might have a look around a few kitchens tonight. 
---
Go directly east from the spawn point at the site, the first Rocks you see are the back of it and just the other side(east side) is the door, it's north of the road across from the site proper.

fresh from the bottle, does not matter the age of the bottle
---
Hmmm interesting.  Thanks.
---
The 45 smg is a really underpowered weapon, the anti armor prefix can‚Äôt help that pile of garbage.
---
I've been playing a lot the last couple weeks (PS4), only one disconnect that entire time.
---
Same thing here. It first started in the Mire, none of the dailies there work for me. Lately, the Camden Park quests stopped working for me 
---
Wow I actually just found it server hopping!
---
Oh! Don't know how I managed to miss that. 
---
Congrats 
---
Anybody got a pic?
---
Or maybe Bethesda could just fix it? 
---
Lmao
---
Just a whiskey, not a fermented one
---
It's all random. Lever Actions have a low drop rate.
---
Ok so basically what your are saying is its not ok for your camp to be severely damaged and you don‚Äôt want it to be costly in the slightest, because you just admitted that an NPC deathclaw comes to your camp it doesn‚Äôt have the intelligence nor the in game strength to severely damage your camp, but a player does.  Say in theory bethesda created advanced AI that prioitised rad showers and generators and could 1 swipe everything. You‚Äôd not be ok with that i assume?Ok that‚Äôs your opinion and i respect that. I disagree because that would make the game boring this is a multiplayer game and you should accept that interactions with the world and the players can be negative or positive.
---
Anybody got pictures?
---
Nice find! The problem is they are too noisy. I try to place generators and turrets far enough from my living space in my C.A.M.P., so I can't hear them. Soundproof walls are needed.
---
You guys are letting the raiders win. Stop whining and fight back. 
---
I normally go over there for the canned coffee so next time I'm on I'll check for you. I'm on xb1. 
---
Thank you!

---
I also have Knight SGT and Officer 
---
I also have SGT and Officer now if you're Xbox I can show 
---
Yes please!
---
this is not on op though, if he doesnt do it somebody else will. this stuff isnt hard once you know what to look for. 
---
Which is the coolest looking?
---
I've had my spot taken within the last two days and got my camp back just fine on relog.
---
I‚Äôve had to get the damn keycards and codes over and over again had and tried it about 4 times and the keypad won‚Äôt let me put in the code every time. I can‚Äôt leave the keypad otherwise the door will close. Has anyone had this issue?
---
20 hrs from when you sell to them. 
---
Alright thanks!
---
Honestly they all look really similar they just have like different markings and symbols. I haven't even looked st officer yet 
---
[removed]
---
Not at all in the last two weeks, and rarely for some time now (PS4). The last time I was disconnected, though, seems to make up for this, seeing as it was immediately after completing a full restoration of the Monaghan Power Plant all by my onesie, but before being issued any rewards. No rewards upon logging in again, either.
---
I would highly prefer that result but I wouldn't hold out for it.
---
ive seen one at the pond just E of lucky hole mine, one on the cliffs west of arkos, and one if you ran a line from AVR medical to camden
---
Your welcome, hope it helps.
---
Well that's not so bad. Still would prefer the dailies to actually work, but at least I'm not straight up locked out of the new content.
---
Oh one will find you sooner or later
---
Why is the Blueprint budget smaller then the Build budget?
---
It's not Bethesda's responsibility to make sure that some dumbass' mod doesn't break when they update the game. that's the mod author
---
No reason not to. You already own it. Dl it over night and do the limited time content.
---
Thanks I picked up the flag, there was nothing underneath 
---
Did they notify you that it was lifted or did you just check?
---
This is the thread, drop a comment and maybe the OP will reply

I need to drink Whiskey and land a sneak attack. It'll register that I've drunk the whiskey, but not any sneak attack.
---
We're the Tunnel Moles and we R-R-Rule!
---
Im just playing the game and not breaking any rules... So any "grief" someone might feel isnt really my problem.
---
Being upset over the things i do isnt a justifiable position. You arent entitled be immune to raiders. Not until they launch survival and change pacifist.
---
Bethesda sold me a survival pvp game. Im playing it. Sorry you refuse to acknowledge the game your playing, but people like me are a constant. We are part of the game. Expect us and prepare for us. 
---
Your kind of greifing yourself by having this wild expectation. Why should i bear the cross of not playing the way i want, just because your upset about the way bethesda rolled out pvp? Thats your cross to bear man. 
---
Im not going to adjust the way i play to cater to other players. 
---
So rarely I can't even remember when the last time was. 
---
Yeah 748250 confirmed opens the door.
---
No notification 
---
This may sound like the generic ‚Äúdid you try rebooting?‚Äù advice, but....?
---
Seriously, any time there‚Äôs a client side patch it‚Äôs probably worthwhile just because Xbox might still have some random relic from an older install floating around in memory somewhere.
---
After that, just for an additional piece of info, maybe try a new character and see if whatever it is is specific to that one char.
---
Super long shot, but before anything drastic like a uninstall / reinstall cycle, try equipping a chameleon armor piece and do a crouch, fast travel, uncrouch.
---
Good luck, hope these help...
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I NEVER saw one mothman, other than that quest you do, until I went to the mothman museum and took all his eggs, and promptly ate them. 30 minutes later I had just dropped an SB and took a lot of damage, and the bastard jumped me. He doesn‚Äôt like his eggs eaten. 
---
If you saw, I dropped some water and canned food over there. I also dropped some ‚Äúuseless‚Äù ammo up on top of the sign. By ‚Äúuseless‚Äù, I mean ammo that I don‚Äôt use because I don‚Äôt use the corresponding weapons. 
---
"Is this the new quest zone?"
---
Dead noob on Deathclaw island
---
lolol. So you think Nazis are the good guys?
---
The enemies seem to respawn once a new player enters the area, so I usually do a circuit of areas within the zone to get them to resoawn after I clear them. For example, at white springs, you can clear out the cabins, then proceed to the garage by the entrance, then go to the golf club, then go to the disposal site, then repeat the process. This method works fine for me, unless someone else kills all the ghouls at the clubhouse before I get there.
---
Ill see if eating its eggs makes it hunt me down
---
Omelettes for everyone. 
---
Where do you get these at?
---
Anyone else get booted?
---
Yup. Whole server crashed thanks Bethesda 
---
Such a bummer. My camp is no joke, people love it. 
---
They are in the Frat house. I found mine in a room on the second floor.
---
I‚Äôll try another ticket I guess. Been waiting since January. 
---
Same
---
I hope not. Why introduce a new crafting system that requires a bunch of ingredients with condition, then make all of that stuff spoil very quickly?
---
No. We don‚Äôt need Fallout to become Fortnite. 
---
I'm unsure if this is the same issue, but back in December I had the same issue. I would delete several items in my camp and my budget would never move. Switching servers would fix it and I would receive my missing budget back.
---
However, if the quick serve hop doesn't help then I'm unsure. 
---
My guy found one somewhere
---
I have a lvl 74 and a lvl 30. You have to finish the main quest and you will notice how empty the game becomes.
---
What exactly does the legendary mole miner do? Can he dissemble the Legendaries‚Äô features and put them together per our request? I.e. if I have a two-shot one star shotgun and a vampire shotgun with explosive bullets, can he put the two together and make me a TSE (while scrapping the other two)? 
---
FYI
---
I case ya'll don't want to waste your time, you can just server hop to get this.
---
Just like the Nuka Cola armor, I did all the thing to get it, just to get to Dome 7 to find it open and pilfered. I hopped 3 times to find the same thing, until one was open with the plans. 
---
Right now is your time to hop to get this. 
---
Bethesda needs to find a way to make the work find this shit personalized so that we don't waste all of our effort to get nothing. 
---
If anyone needs a free dome 4 or dome 7 key, it's all yours, I never got to use mine.
---
It awkwardly shows up through chameleon (that transparent look), doesn't do it on my other character though. 
---
If youre on xb1 I could make you one for cheap.
---
You still banned today?
---
That is where my camp is as well. Extremely popular spot. Took me 4 tries to log in last night. Beautiful area, just no enemy spawns there so I get bored.
---
Probably not, but we don't know exactly what he does.
---
Used a mod that did that in Fallout 4. It was an absolute must for me.
---
I was at 8 am 
---
Agree, since the patch I am getting disconnected pretty regular or it will just freeze and I have to shut the game down to get out, also noticed that food spoils far quicker now and the buffs like well tuned and well rested do not last very long any more, so called fix one problem create another, go Bethesda. 
---
I think it‚Äôs supposed to draw enemies towards it, so it‚Äôs useful for defending workshops 
---
Hah
---
Try again
---
I found one too, dropped it because I thought it was ugly 
---
I have a gunslinger type build stealth/vats heavy
---
4str. Lvl 2 traveling pharmacy  and lvl 2 bandolier 
---
12 per. max lvl concentrated fire and all 3 rifleman perks maxed (lever gun for range I feel it works with the gunslinger idea and adds some balance to the build)
---
Like 2 endurance and 3 char I think
---
Think 9 int max plumber, and gunsmith 
---
15 agi all gun slinger perks maxed, sneak rank 2, eascape artist, and sneak attack maxed
---
12 luck bloody mess maxed, starched gene maxed then mix and match four leaf clover and other perks i cant think off atm
---
Same here. Had a sloth a LONG time ago. Haven't seen that thing in forever. Log on after new patch, there's a radstag in my house
---
When melee and ranged fail, your only option is a dance-off.
---
I had this earlier with wine and trading. I quit for a hour or so of trying to get it to work. When I relogged it had fixxed itself and now needed me to drink vodka and eat spoiled food. It happened to work after that.
---
Thanks, looks like I‚Äôll have to keep checking.
---
It‚Äôs caused by getting in/out of Power Armor, been around since the last patch 
---
I dc a few times a day. Mostly during combat and using a melee weapon in vats.
---
I have one flamer mod and 1 chainsaw
---
It was some type of missle launcher. Didn‚Äôt pay much attention since I don‚Äôt use them. I‚Äôm a stealth, sniper build. Being 65 years old makes me stay back and hide! Missle lauchers and missles weigh too much for my build.
---
It appears that you have confused a shield with shields. OP isn‚Äôt requesting a passive extra health bar that is your shield, they‚Äôre asking for equitable held shields like in Skyrim. And I think it‚Äôs a great idea 
---
I'll buy that mod!
---
Caps? Or 5mm?
---
Hey if I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve already got my money‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôm lucky though only having paid ¬£10 for it. Even so, if you‚Äôve paid ¬£50 for it and played for 50 hours (which we know is not the suggested amount of game time), that‚Äôs still a good price to entertainment ratio.  Hell, ¬£5 an hour is good if you compare it to the cinema.
---
Having said all that I take your point. But, once you‚Äôve done any game and spent 100 hours in it it‚Äôs bound to get stale. I know of people having played 400 hours and I wonder what on Earth they‚Äôve been doing!
---
There are no exploits. Whitesprings is boring, clear West Tek instead.
---
Or you can skip through all of this and glitch through the domes with a power armor frame.
---
Caps for sure. I don't have much 5mm but you can have that for free.
---
Yep, even the BoS vendor in Watoga says it from time to time. 
---
There was a bass fishing game on the Sega genesis I got into as a kid
---
I was thinking something more like a roguelike mode with the blackouts... you drink it and you wake up in a random dungeon you have to escape from or something like that i dunno...
---
Ok. What can u give caps wise?
---
Few times per session. Xbox one 
---
Hmm. Name your price, I guess?
---
Already did and they don‚Äôt respawn fast
---
Heya JuiceHead, you're the one that makes camp build video's right? if so, they are awesome and I love them! Thanks!
---
This! I have stopped trying to kill the queen because of this. I would show up waste all my ammo/stims for her to quickly become unkillable because people show up then leave. I dont think she needs a nerf because if everyone is actually trying then its really fun and possible to complete. A rework needs to happen.
---
I hope not
---
Tell me what u feel comfortable with. I don't want to be a dick! Lol
---
Somebody nuked Morgantown and I got close to 200 raw cobalt.. And 40-50 of the other fluxes. Sadly I didn't farm the other mats needed to make them stable so I'm going to have almost 100 raw wasted. 
---
There was a nuke zone up by pumkin house that had a ton of plants that spawn the other day when i was on so i would say nuke there also a fissure but beast arnt thar bad
---
Would you take 250?
---
It‚Äôs almost impossible to get now, I‚Äôve server hopped like 50 times today and there‚Äôs no plan in sight
---
At least a couple of hours by my own experience. I've returned to drop stuff at least two hours out and had things still there from my drop (unless someone else dropped exactly seven Fancy Lads on the same server while I was playing, which I assume definitely did not happen).
---
Sure man. Carcass_stew. Come to me please?
---
One piece is put on cool down each time it procs. So it stacks but as someone who is actively using auto-stim sentinel on a tanky PvP build it's not the most useful thing. One piece is likely enough for PvE as it shouldn't proc so often and you can control how long you wait between fights. In PvP it's not really doing much to protect me from high DPS low damage heavy guns like I wanted. If someone has a build that can kill me there still going to kill me even with this armor.
---
That said it does have a special case use with the Gatling Plasma because I can kinda get stuck waiting for the reload animation and the animation can prevent me from using stims. So it can be emergency situational protection.
---
This and the born survivor perk work with super stims if that's all you're carrying. Field surgeon and first aid do affect this as well. Perhaps with many ranks of first aid it would be better. I run 1 rank.
---
Bring those 5mm too
---
Will do! Appreciated!
---
Yeah, slow to reload but the damage is pretty nice especially if you have good legendary perks and from what I‚Äôve seen you can snipe pretty descently with em
---
Why is it whenever someone gets a bad run they immediately jump to the conclusion that something has been stealth nerfed? 
---
Is that why I keep getting disconected today ? Because this week has been without any issues, but today i get the "server not responding" thing every hours !
---
No prob
---
It would be nice if the defend workshop events escalated to the extent that they became difficult events requiring multiple players, like the SBQ
---
I think the ones I've found were on deathclaws and wendigos
---
I have no clue why things like the keycards or plans would be world based and not player based
---
Good stuff.
---
I don't take loot unless someone seeks revenge.
---
Hopefully you don‚Äôt experience it. The bug is widespread. Some folks might be assuming they were in a spot they shouldn‚Äôt be but I‚Äôve moved my camp a few times or even rebuilt in places it was deleted from and it keeps happening. 
---
Yeah I did a lot of choosing for perks but wanted to make sure with the nerf that this build was still worth using because they nerfed explosive dmg and two shot legendary.
---
I just send a friend request through ps4, right? I've actually not bought anything before. 
---
Ha, ive only been finden 100% ones whats your luck mine is 14
---
I know this is a little late, but just timed how long it takes to produce 1 purified water from an industrial water purifier. 5 minutes, so only 12 an hour. Sure would be nice to have this issue patched so it would work correctly
---
I noticed this also!
---
Did he kill you through slap damage or how‚Äôd it go down?
---
Or maybe some people like the game?
---
Sounds like a latency issue. I had a 390 cap bounty from leveling a turrent base at whitesprings and I had no problems getting killed afterwards
---
I just do the quests and follow the story. I leveled up pretty fast. After 115 though, it‚Äôs slow going for me. 
---
Aww hell yeah brother I knew there was a better in game paint job for xo 1! Mad props to you!
---
Yes ps4. Accepted request
---
I‚Äôm on my 3rd character lol
---
Wow
---
Daily quests are on a screwy timer that doesn't work properly i wanted to get mr fuzzy tokens everyday and by day 3 daily was bugged and hasent been fixed
---
Oh haha. I couldn‚Äôt make another character. Too much invested in my original. 
---
Good luck on that Behemoth. I'll dig a grave for you.
---
I gave the dude an All Star chain wrapped baseball bat and I had the smallest amount of health:(
---
How bad is it?  Because I usually blow up cars for fun with my hammer and don‚Äôt take any damage.
---
It could be but when I was in game around other people it wasn‚Äôt being laggy or anything everyone was moving around attacking things. I restarted my router and pc and its still happening. 
---
Bummer, are you a bloodied build? Definitely sucks that slap damage can kill you tho. 
---
It seems to be random.  I've noticed that they tend to immediately blow up directly in your face more often than not, and sometimes don't 'splod at all.
---
I got this [wazer wifle](https://imgur.com/A7bhzDc) today, which I'm looking forward to trying out as I slowly gather ultracite laser mods.  25 base damage seems crazy low for a semi-auto lvl 50 weapon, and I had 30% pistol damage perks and bloody mess active.
---
Later on, I got [this one](https://imgur.com/vPpWNos) at whitesprings.  I guess today was my wucky day.
---
Nuka cola perk card should have a few ranks that make the cola bottles glow and that sound the bobblehead, caps and magazines perks card makes but for nuka colas
---
The sound could be that sound effect then a bottle opening 
---
Sorry, I should have specified. The vertical half walls. 
---
I did the generic reboot on my character's life, I stripped him down and committed suicide and that worked!
---
I have around 100 hours of playtime but I wouldn‚Äôt call all of it fun. I had to do a lot of things twice or more because of issues with the game. It certainly didn‚Äôt provide what was advertised and that is my main complaint. Hopefully it will get better with the upcoming updates.
---
Huh I do then probably a rare bug
---
Yes, this, please.
---
I kind of thought it was funny waking up in that trailer in the Ash Heap. Kind of reminded me of the Skyrim quest "A Night to Remember", accept no angry priestesses were yelling at me and I wasn't married to some strange creature.
---
Damage wise it‚Äôs viable but your defense is distance. If they rush or sneak up on you expect to die and often. Once you get used to the play style tho you should die less. I don‚Äôt carry important junk on me anymore because of this 
---
Oh damn,  we need to try to keep a bottle in there at all times.
---
It also spawns in the laundry room. Took me a few tries, but it‚Äôll pop up. 
---
Oooh thank you!
---
Take all of the whiskey you have in your inventory out and craft a bottle of whiskey and ferment it then drink that one you've fermented. 
---
If you were in it from the start I completely understand. I‚Äôve only suffered one crash and that was tonight. 
---
Yessss. Thank you! If you cone across more, let me know! I will look out for 5mm!
---
Hey in the spirit of love for pancakes. I've heard for some it went to spam. But those I know irl who were banned. Of the 4, 2 go nothing at all
---
Hop servers or get a lot of steeal and aluminum and a high level friend and tag the vertibot at posiden plant and then you and your friend kill it fast, repair it and repeat 
---
1 down! Any takers for the other 2?
---
Just found the officer and it changes your arms and chest to Orange looks awesome 
---
Yep, 2 nukes dropped in my session tonight
---
Yeah, I've been roaming around not doing much of anything except enjoying the scenery. What's a TNT dome?
---
Melee is op, more mutations directly apply to melee, 75% anti armor perks, unyeilding. I have zero melee perks and the only weapon I can get that's higher than a bloodied fire axe is my bloodied Fatman.( Which I still haven't seen a screenshot or a melee weapon with a higher damage output) melee could swing 3-5 times before I get 2 shots out though
---
**IF YOU WANT THE KEYS:**
---
With the minimum amount of effort.
---
Often times people will beat you to them, and even the method of just server hopping by the TNT dome until you find the door opened by someone else won't work because people are trying to hoard the plans to sell, and they won't be there.
---
What worked for me:
---
Server hop at the TNT dome until you find the door locked. This ensures that someone else either hasn't gotten your world's keys, or is still in the process. You then know in advance whether you have a chance to get them. 
---
If the bathroom door in the Nuka Cola plant is un-locked when you get there, or the framed American flag that covers the second key in Tangara Town is missing, you are probably out of luck, as this likely means someone is ahead of you. You may want to give up and try another world.
---
You may also skip the step of getting the Nuka Cola Marketing Access Code from the suitcase under the crashed plane if you got it once already. This stays in your inventory, although you lose the keycards and one-time code when you open the secret doors in Overlook Cabin. This can help you beat people racing you to the keys.
---
Once you obtain the keys, even if you return to the TNT dome to find someone has server-hopped there with their own set of keys to farm plans, you can just hop yourself till you find a world with sealed doors. 
---
Good luck!
---
Could I get you to paint mine?!
---
Shields can be used with 1h melee or pistols only. I could get behind this. 1 step closer to dark souls. Lol
---
Cool, thanks for sharing!
---
I play on PS4, and what I get crash-wise is "the application is corrupted", EVERY TIME it updates.  I still haven't been able to play it, no matter how many times I reinstall it since the latest update.
---
I got the charisma with vodka challenge today and completed it no problem.  I got a mimosa recipe that requires a champagne that I don't know how to make.  LOL.  I got some kind of tequila that gives you a vampiric effect with melee, but the drawback is extra disease chance.  Seems like a win/win since I have plague walker.
---
I think it could be from the new NukaShine items. I was on some the new drinks while I murdered the person for the bounty inside the speak easy. 
---
So as if the paint job being In nuka world wasnt lore breaking enough...here it is in West Virginia...
---
You using a Tesla Rifle? That always happens to me when I stow mine.
---
No more nukashine for you
---
Doors are open. GT: BeardedOne13 
---
A million thank yous! If you find another, I'll buy too! In the meantime I'll horde any 5mm I come across!
---
If that really is the case, then I guess I'm not cut out for this game, because if I have to drop everything to feed water this overglorified sim every 5 minutes, it's just not worth it to me.  Especially since it takes so much of everything to do so now--  I have to drink way too much water, even with Dromedary 3, to refill the meter, and don't get me started on how much effing food I have to snarf down...
---
I‚Äôm there also but got rid of the extractor to get a bigger base. Acid wasn‚Äôt that necessary for me.
---
Mine are all consistently 90% my luck is 10
---
Will do
---
I don‚Äôt think so, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. No character is actually killed by hunger or thirst. It just reduces health down to 5%
---
Awww, you twoüíñ
---
They don‚Äôt show you a roadmap, but you can trade out perk cards as you need to. It‚Äôs not perfect but if you can slog it out for a bit while underpowered you eventually get to where you want to. 
---
I mean I used a shit load of mods on fo4 but that was an offline game ya feel. I just don‚Äôt think people should use mods in an online game because it could ruin other people‚Äôs experience... depending on the mod not saying your naked mod is ruining other people‚Äôs experience 
---
Don't forget to fix the firecracker berry bush volume too, it suffers the same bug whenever one pops.

Love this idea! I love my big, sprawling build in the northwest, but I wish we could take a small camp with us on the road. Something resembling what you have here. Super cool!
---
My luck is 15. Pre-patch all of mine were 80's or 90's. I've had a streak of exactly 25%, so just trying to see if others saw the same. 
---
You just have to server up they'll be there eventually once somebody is taking them off the server they're not available.

Message me my gamertag is jeanzyy

I have him all my leather and plastic in thanks, and I am still trying for the paint myself while watching the game, have seen them twice since and have been sniped twice since.
---
I wouldnt bank on that being a hotfix. I would defintly send a ticket though and keep your voice heard but like it was said before the fastest fix is to redo it all. :/
---
Try relogging?

Good luck

You: a poor accounting of a human being who games.
---
It's entering The Forest that triggers it, not just hopping to Vault 76.  You can also trigger it by crossing a border from one of the other areas. Hopping to 76 is just one way to enter The Forest. 
---
Samsquanch!
---
I personally think the SBQ is buffed far too much at the moment, to the point where it's simply not worth killing her and where I don't really blame the adds for focusing on the mob instead.
---
The last time I did it successfully, there were only two other players at the start.  So, you'd think she'd spawn in a fairly minimal buff state.  But nevertheless, over the course of the battle, we had 10-12 high-leveled players join us, firing constantly, and she went down *in the final minute*.  So yeah, I think she might be a bit too strong right now.  I would have expected us to kill her with maybe 5 minutes left on the clock.
---
They're random, and I don't think the event is time limited.
---
I love the NPCs in this game tbh
---
I hate the toxic valley, it's so ugly and the monsters are terribly difficult.  If totally could use more stuff to draw out the pain.

That‚Äôs what happens when a body falls on a rad roch

You're in your 30s, doing Poseidon won't be a thing at all. The hardest part will be finding your way around and not getting lost before the time runs out. You should be able to do it in 30 min even getting lost a couple times. I'm terrible at combat and I did it several times solo in my early teens. At level 24 I made my way along the railroad tracks to Welch, Lewisburg, and ultimately Watoga and Harper's Ferry. If I can do it, anyone can do it. I was scared crap-less the whole time but I did it. Regarding Poseidon, you'll need to find a hazmat suit (in the locker room and one on the roof) or have lots of rad-x and radaway for the reactor portion as it puts out a lot of rads.
---
Hmmmm...
---
Interesting. 
---
? These stairs have been in the game since day one?
---
What?
---
It's a issue when you have mods enabled
---
Not only was Wild Appalachia announced, but they also announced a bunch of other free DLC to come out later this year!
---
"Why is the sky orange? What's that rapid ticking noise? Oh look, a bat. Oh, it's a big bat. And it's screaming at me...." \[You have been critically wounded\]
---
Nice. Haven't been by there since the patch but I've stumbled on those steps more than once
---
Sounds like someone here exploits this.
---
As someone who has lost multiple legendaries between simple logouts and logins, this was 100% my first thought.
---
You'll have years to complete the daily quests. I'm sure you'll catch up eventually.
---
I found a bunch that were low, but then I found one at 85ish today in the Bog at a firebase.
---
This guy wasnt dead. After watching him make a few rounds, i shot him and he flew and disappeared into the wall of computers. 
---
Oh that seems to cause it thanks its been bugging me
---
fresh whiskey comes directly from the teet
---
I did notice some health bumps when shooting enemies today, but the bump was small compared to the damage I was inflicting, so they still died from ranged fire.
---
Then the quest does pop and my reward is 1 single bottle of fucking beer... No recipe 
---
I could be mistaken, doesn't the queen only spawn if you directly nuke fissure prime?
---
So can someone try finding a working code and using it on the keypad door in tanagra? The keypad became available in this update and the number of digits is the same as the code for getting the done key, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find a server where the code wasn‚Äôt used yet
---
Did the hotfix address the "Swarm of Suitors" event.  The mayor's dialogue won't play, and the quest won't recognize the island being occupied.  This happened at least three times on different servers, since the patch.
---
They have not been buyable though
---
&gt;Im not going to adjust the way i play to cater to other players.
---
In other words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to bother considering anyone else‚Äù.  When one shot slap damage was killing people targeting lower levels just to kill them when they weren‚Äôt fighting back was greifing and it was shitty to do so.  
---
I hope you don‚Äôt complain about declining game populations or declining resources for the dev team then as attitudes like yours keep new players away from the game and like it or not new blood is always needed to sustain games like this. 
---
I never use melees, so I don‚Äôt know a whole lot about them, but I think the shishkebob does less damage because it‚Äôs damage is split between physical and energy, and both of those damages are quite low for it. The weapon definitely needs a buff but I think it benefits from the same perks other one handed melees benefit from
---
I've picked three today off of power armor frames and all were exactly at 25%
---
New Vault?
---
When it died, it did not disappear from your budget. Bethesda's fixed this by giving you a radstag.
---
Your post sums it up pretty well. I agree with most except one point: 
---
I sincerely think being a "raider" is much more discouraged than being a "peaceful player".
---
Destroying a camp or engaging in pvp costs much more resources (bullets, time), and has way less benefits (IE rewards), than fixing damage or fighting raiders back because of their bounties.
---
The issue lies entirely in another issue in the game: resources might be too abundant and there is not enough content to keep people busy. I'd love to play a raider, but not a griefer. Going around the map knocking on people's door demanding caps etcetera. But that's different than actively being bored and locating everyone and destroying everything for no reason (I think the map player icons makes it a lot worse, just like being able to destroy repeatedly) .
---
I think more content is the best fix, though
---
Ok, kinda sucks to hear but looks like I have to stick to another melee weapon for a while.
---
Yes, but it doesnt have to be a direct hit. Fissure prime only needs to be within the circle.  The SBQ will come to the fighters that stand outside if the radiation.
---
Please never fix this.
---
This made me laugh. also as a fellow parent I often dont use a mic due to background noise, my kids will just randomly walk out and high pitch scream for no reason.
---
It's considered a One-Handed Melee Weapon. Though I'm not sure how the actual damage may fair out. The best advice I could offer is checking the Stats with different perk combinations activated and seeing if certain ones hold different effects.
---
For all we know, it could be one of those situations like the Auto Grenade Launcher where, although it's a Heavy Explosive Weapon, it really doesn't gain many benefits from Heavy Weapon perks.
---
You can acquire the plan by completing the Powering Up (Nuclear Plant) quests.
---
Yes very strange, I also found it while adventuring vault purple(65)
---
Not that I remember, however there will be an Overseer's Log at the silo chastising your behavior.  
---
Were you inside?
---
Only if you nuke something other than fissure prime
---
Ty for the advice, guess I'll wait a bit and see. 
---
There's several in the silos too. 
---
‚ÄúBears‚Äù have springs.  Farm white spring club house for the wendigo.  Rinse, Server hop, Repeat 
---
Update your custom ini
---
Hard to explain look in front page of this sub reddit
---
No your fine 
---
Yes I have been inside
---
[This](http://imgur.com/gallery/9HlYXwV) has a picture of what it looks like inside as well as some from around the area
---
Where did I put that now, it's been a *while*
---
Because to use different types of waters for the same end product requires a lot of duplicate recipes in the recipe list due to how the game engine works. It would be good to have recipes to downgrade waters though.
---
Yeah I have one handed maxed out so I guess I'll have to do some experiments.
---
DOCUMENTS&gt; my games
---
Motherfucker looks like it‚Äôs about to get a pail of water dumped on its head.
---
They buffed Power Plant Workshops, if you have at least an hour, you can walk away with like a dozen 100% charges if you're continuing on having difficulties.
---
Wow, that is incredibly devious... upvote.
---
And if you don't mind, how exactly would I update it? Just delete and let the game remake it?
---
S-S-SSAPSAQUATCH!!
---
The one at the ammo plant is better as it's a lvl 50 and awards ~300 per cycle for the same mats cost. 
---
yes sadly shishkebob sucks compared to most other one handers 
---
Never one shot slapped anyone. I believe you had to stack bobbleheads for that?
---
The rest of your comment is just opinions. You can have them, it doesnt mean its correct. Maybe the "new blood" likes to pvp too.
---
At least you concede to the fact that i am not greifing?
---
Switch to the alternate view. 
---
Agree
---
‚ÄúIs that guy made of shit?‚Äù Lawl.
---
 I have like 2 of these in my base, except they are metal and not wooden.
---
I think that's because its classed an energy damage which is weak vs a lot of enemies.
---
Do you know if the log is available at all the silos? I did my launch at alpha but I will eventually head to bravo and charlie and do theirs. It would be awesome if that log is included at all three silos and not just the first one you launch from 
---
Hateful troll
---
Still can't get anything to work for me. I don't wear chameleon armour :(
---
Welcome aboard. 76 is fun to play, and there's some cool new stuff on the way.
---
If you keep your camp simple to begin with and use the blueprint feature, you can move around very easily any time you find a new spot that catches your eye. Personally, I put my camp right on the line between the Forest and the Savage Divide, because the central location is good for fast travel and because I have plants from both regions growing right nearby.
---
Loser
---
Since you said it looked like the sewers at dyer, arent there terminal entries about opening a pipe somewhere at Dyer to redirect flow or something or is that somewhere else? I never found anything else about it but I remember coming across that, maybe opening a pipe or drain is how we'll be getting in there 
---
Just saw this as well, it's really funny to watch. Reminded me of the opening to The Happening 
---
I think it's just the original one you launched from, and as mentioned, it occurs when you hit somewhere other than Prime. It basically says you were supposed to use the nuke to deal with the Scorched not destroy the world all over again. 
---
when they are in negative caps like that they do 50% less damage already
---
Filthy Casuals doesn‚Äôt want players like you who complain and talk shit when somebody disagrees tho.
---
Oh nice thanks
---
My whole thing is, what‚Äôs the point in attacking someone who you know isn‚Äôt attacking back, has no weapons close to the power of yours and is obviously just going on with the main quest. If that‚Äôs fun to people that‚Äôs pretty sad, I kinda get the camp wrecking but this was no camp situation I was down in the mistress of mysteries bunker, crafting, and all of a sudden I‚Äôm getting swiped in the back of the head by a death claw gauntlet. So I evade up into the mansion try and go out the front door, nowhere close to death because I have multiple life saving armor parts and then my game bugs and I get booted back to the home screen. That‚Äôs the most frustrating part
---
It‚Äôs lame 
---
Welcome man. You‚Äôll realize most of the negative reviewers on YouTube are full of shit. I got the game about a month ago and only took a break because I finally got God of War. After that I was back to fallout 76.
---
TSE Explosive Weapons benefit from Demolitions Expert and Explosive Related Perks. You should see if the Shishkebob benefits from Energy Weapons.
---
No. Just more and more people are realizing the game isn‚Äôt as bad as the reviews make it out to be.
---
Try the blade of Bastet, it‚Äôs a pretty good one. I use it occasionally when my gun breaks or runs out of ammo
---
That only applies if you have a bounty and can't pay it off. It's also a temporary 4hr debuff. 
---
gotcha i dont pvp so wasnt quite sure how it worked
---
Stalker's pipe wrench
---
How is it a "leak" if they existed in the game forever?
---
....you guys aren't all polyglots? Jeeze. Just pick up base German, French, Spanish/Italian and a little Russian to cover the Eastern bloc.
---
Simpler solutions to capless PvPers.   
---
1) If someone collects your bounty and you can't pay, you're forced into pacifist mode and can't join a team for a set period of time (teaming could be used to circumvent pacifist).   
---
2) If you are killed by a player and want to seek revenge, you must have enough caps to cover the cost of losing again. If you can't, you can't seek revenge.   
---
Countless times I've fast traveled to events just to have them completed already.  Waste of caps and time
---
Is it a numbered Vault ?
---
Devs are telling you that your camp blows. Move to a different spot and build something else. Or keep testing the definition of insanity and whining about on here. 
---
My scorched did blow up tho
---
Replace it with this one. (As long as better inventory is your only mod, that one will work)
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32?tab=files
---
You don't actually go negative, just hit zero. The effect is a "disease" called bankruptcy and applies a 50% damage reduction in PvP for 4hrs. 
---
If you're capless, you can "seek revenge" and lose all you want without the debuff, a mechanic in desperate need of attention. 
---
That sucks but I'm not at all suprised. I don't trust anyone other than the people I play with.
---
It‚Äôs not rare. I found it just laying around in the frat house. 
---
How can you live so close to a fissure?
---
You can watch something ferment and the bar will visibly move.  Feels like they applied that timing to the other food items in inventories.  
---
The dailies being borked even more...sigh.  I've been doing Cop a Squatter and Camden Park dailies since nothing else pops.  And now I can't even do those.
---
Fix your custom.ini
---
Should look like this:
---
are you finding them in chassis? or lying around ? because the ones lying around are usually always 100%
---
Great, also the gold bar in Pleasant Hill cemetery is possible to pick up and a few more things that I already forgotten.
---
I found two in the same frat. One upstairs, one downstairs. 
---
I remember meeting four guys who played instruments through their mics as they followed the roads. Cool dudes, hooked me up with some radaway and went off into the sunset.
---
I second pumpkin house. Vegetables turn to cobalt, so even the back of the steakhouse in Watoga would produce alot
---
Be warned: Only 1 key and 1 plan are available per server. If they are taken, start server hopping. Took me more than 2 hours to get my paint job tonight.
---
Purified water restores 25% without any perks, so with dromedary 3 it should be close to 50%. Salisbury Steak is my go too, or mutt chops/wolf ribs @ 20%. If I don't have either I just make a metric crap-ton of soup. Either way, I have never had to stop every 5 minutes or ingest whole stacks of anything, even when the meter is red. The only food perk I use is thru-hiker.
---
Any timetable on when details for the Nuclear Winter mode will come out? Around the end of Wild Appalachia? I'm antsy about that one! Lol
---
Ok so!! I encountered this bot AND THE VENGEFUL MOTHMAN in between the place and the ski resorts. At level 12. What are the chances. And AGAIN (just the bot), but by Deathclaw Island. This time, I decided to shoot out poor friend. Upon doing so, a paper was deposited into my inventory. not gonna  spoil, but here's a hint: [SOCIAL EXPERIMENT BOT](https://www-m.cnn.com/2015/08/03/us/hitchbot-robot-beheaded-philadelphia-feat/index.html) 
---
This is absolutely awful, actually.  I get the need for the hunger/thirst mechanic. It *is* a survival game. But not only are my hunger/thirst bars depleting *way* too fast (thirst halfway down in ~10 minutes????), food and water don't satisfy as much as they used to, either, and food is spoiling *way* too fast.  It's all I can do to keep my overglorified sim fed and watered, I am so busy constantly micromanaging that I have no time to do anything else. I personally hate the mechanic, but understand the need for it, however, it's really driving me away with how broken it is right now.  I was really hoping the hotfix today would fix it, but, if anything, it actually seems worse.  Please.  ***Please*** fix this asap, or I will be forced to quit playing for a while.
---
Repeat that again in English, if you would.
---
The way it‚Äôs presented can be boring. And the basic story of following your overseer can be bland. But the bigger story of the mining companies, automation, the cryptids, the enclave, that crazy bastard Eckhart, ect, is all very cool and some of my favourite fallout lore so far. 
---
Thanks so much! Good luck in Appalachia!
---
Amazing
---
Who woulda thought somebody would kill you in a PvP game...
---
Was it mumbling ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy‚Äù?
---
I wouldn't say boring but I just cannot get immersed in it.  Too shallow for me.  Still a good game though
---
Kill people 
---
That explains the pile of piss-soaked clothes and the radio on full blast, but not the Molerat nailed to a tree with railroad spikes, or those glowing eyes in the woods that keep following me...
---
You buffed every energy weapon except the one I want to use, Plasma.
---
Still has the same durability (super low), still has the same dps (mind boggling low)... still no where near viable for mid to end gameplay. I have every single stat and perk planned out and set up and... nope, **I would actually be better off using weapons I have ZERO perks in. How can that be the design you want?**
---
I came back to the game for patch 7 after a month away because I thought this would finally be the time that Plasma would feel at least decent, since you had been talking about energy weapon buffs...
---
Nope, I still spend pretty much all my time gathering resources for ammo and repairs (even with gunsmith 5/5, weapon artisan 3/3, ammosmith 2/2, and super duper 3/3) . Not fun.
---
Wish I felt like starting a new character but I'm not sure I do. I could convert this character over the next 13 levels or so... but... even that sounds like a drag.
---
Thanks.
---
P.S. scorchbeasts still almost never land and they still fire their FUS-RA-DO, non stop. No way in hell its 10 seconds in-between.
---
It's still not officially released 
---
I haven‚Äôt been disconnected since I turned of my ‚Äúconvert incoming voice chat to text‚Äù option a few weeks ago 
---
The key was not there. The quantum paint is friggin ugly anyway
---
I picked up a 92% core from a PA suit today. My luck is crap, too.
---
Since some people wear mixed sets, I wouldn't even care if they simply let us number them. 1,2,3 etc. Just some easy way for us to personally discern one from another. 
---
Legendary in Collision Course?!
---
I've done that event at least 3 dozen times, never seen a Legendary in it, I'll have to keep trying.
---
I have an anti armor, faster swing speed, power attack boxing glove. It‚Äôs extremely viable. 
---
That Thompson should be pretty good if it's max level. I have a 2 star zealots Thompson with +10% aimed damage and it does way better than its damage numbers would make you expect.
---
Its a known thing with logging in
---
Had a guy come and attack me and my sister in Welch. I decided to pvp him cause I needed the kill for the achievement. Kill him, look through his loot bag but don‚Äôt take anything. Guy seeks revenge and comes after me again. So I kill him again. And again. And again. After like the 15th time I take his loot and send him a message that if he just stops seeking revenge I will stop killing him. He gives me flack. So I keep killing him as he comes after me. Killed the guy like 20+ times before he left the server. He killed me like 2 times. Did get the achievement though. Lol. 
---
Combine the two ideas. Go negative, force pacifist while negative, drop team and can't join any team. 
---
Point 2 is good
---
Fortune Finder and Cap Collector Rank 3 + Cap Stash farming
---
Lol
---
No there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a texture where the number should be yet it is just a purple rectangle 
---
My og characters a 93 so if it were about revenge I would seek it. But I just wanted some explanation on why people antagonize other quest line players. No reciprocation included with the minuscule damage should give them a hint to move the fuck on.  And in regards to your arguments, this had nothing to do with a camp. I was nowhere near my desolate camp location, for the talked about reason specifically. Nobody‚Äôs going to stumble across it unless they‚Äôre just exploring for locations but again there is nothing around it so they wouldn‚Äôt even wander there. This is about attacking a player, who obviously is not attacking back. Has extremely weaker weapons and armor so this specific instance was just like you said, someone being a dickhead. Which I know now to be ready for because ill just switch characters and give them dirt naps until the cows come home. And ruin the experience for them too. Trust me we all have high level friends 371‚Äôs aren‚Äôt the easiest to kill especially in large groups. Guess we‚Äôll see next time who laughs last but thanks all for the input. 
---
I found the plan, but can't pick it up, can't pick up anything in the dome.
---
I mean it's less buggy, and the servers are a bit more stable. You can't go 1500lbs over your carryweight anymore. There is a new quest in Morgantown for brewing alcohol. Otherwise nothing's changed. 
---
Thanks for the good fight.
---
Two-shot explosive. Two-shot used to add 100% damage, and explosive also used to add 100% damage. They were very op. 
---
I followed the instructions and the key wasn't there. :/
---
Ok cool. Was just worried that I wouldn‚Äôt know what was going on lol
---
I'm cool with that. Swing fully negative however much your bounty was and every cap you earn goes to paying it off.  
---
This also means no fast travel and no contesting workshops.
---
Nuke the grafton monster, get giant grafton monster! 
---
Most important addition is legendary hunting rifles now exist
---
Thats awesome!
---
Was deff a good run anytime 
---
Interesting.
---
I'm just hoping it's not pawn stars rick trapped in that mining suit. "I see you got a level 35 three star two shot exploding Handmade with +10% aimed damage here. I got a pile of these in the back and I can't sell em. I can give you this Junkie's tire iron for it, best I can do."
---
A similar effect can be had with the assaultron head weapon. Charge it up and when you stop it, you'll have a healthy warm glow. Just maybe don't fire it unless you are familiar with it's glitches...
---
Awesome that bugged the crap out of me. 
---
Find either Marine Tactical Helmet plan it any of the Halloween Outfit plans (witches, skeleton) make those and sell to vendors (helmet sells for 36 I think and the outfits sell for 45caps assuming you have hard bargain rank 3)
---
Well, I'm glad that things are peachy for you, but they aren't for me and a lot of other people.
---
He hung around my camp for a while today. All he did was follow me and say things like "Halt." "Stop." "Please wait." 
---
He never insulted me. Didn't try hitting him. He seemed to want to follow me indefinitely, even when I left camp, until I fast traveled. He can teleport to you to get around obstacles.
---
Where is it exactly I would love to visit it
---
You were right, it didn't address the hunger/thirst/spoilage crap. 
---
I‚Äôm finding my heavy weapon deterioration rate has increased rather than decreased as was suggested in the patch notes. I appreciate it‚Äôs not particularly relevant to your post, I went off on a random rant. Sorry.
---
It's the best area for acid, there's loads up there. There's also a spot where you can get 2 resources together ( lead and junk so kinda handy ). Most my camps are on acid veins but I rarely bother with Toxic Valley because it means travelling is going to cost way more and they'res no other reason to go there.
---
Yup it was discovered yesterday. No info about it what it‚Äôs for
---
The marine tech helmet , mothman eggs, killing people, selling aid you don‚Äôt use , trading stuff you don‚Äôt want with people , selling purified water, oh and the new legendary trading shop ... doing all that I can make about 2K a day 
---
So far ive tamed a stunted yao guai, a scorched megasloth, a sluggish megasloth, and what led me here is that i just tamed a diseased snallygaster.
---
how do you get the marine tech helmet
---
I bought the plans off someone tbh. Idk where to find em. I was charged 1K for it but in all honesty it‚Äôs not hard to make and you‚Äôll make that grand back in a day. So it‚Äôs worth it
---
It's implied to be a part of the sheepsquatch questline - there's a screenshot of someone's map of sheepsquatch events and the previously empty location of the vault is marked.
---
Man, I found that log at level 15, no nukes launched obviously. Made me feel like a dick for nothing.
---
Ah
---
I'm not on the game right now to get the exacts but it's on the top left of the map - east of a lumbermill (the very top left drawn location) and directly north of a farm. 
---
if anyone has vintage nukashine could they add me ghostboy1225 to help me with the new quest?
---
True shit. They even downvoted me to oblivion for saying punctuation is important. All hope is lost. 
---
My goal is to get people to empathize with PvP raiders and understand we are an intended feature of fallout 76. 
---
I am pure love‚ù§üíúüíöüòç
---
Theres no greifing in fo76!
---
There was a post on the main page a couple days ago. There is a image of the map location there. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0t23g/found_a_new_vault_not_located_on_map/
---
Why did you take a picture of stairs before the patch?
---
Worked for me earlier. Had to drink new river ale, purchase item. Drank, went to vendor, bought item(900 caps for plan I didn't have),backed out of vendor and quest updated. Then it said to buy another item, I did(20cap nuke quantum) return to biv.quest complete.
---
There is a door at the crashed space station that's closed and can't be opened, I'm thinking that it's  going to be used for future content.
---
i is think say he done system this support in start again time though
---
does the quest still say to drink nukashine or do you have a nukashine label in your inventory (under notes)
---
 Those "steps" and basically any small pebble that blocks my walking always irk me so much having marsupial + strange in numbers. 
---
hi non pvper here , I've had a goodly amount of cavalier drop as well as orher nifty things ( quite a bit of epic junk too )  if you play /grind enough you will start acquiring all sorts of things .  I will say my full unyielding armor set look like a raggedy man and often the various pieces aren't the perfect level or have weird secondary or tertiary powers . 
---
I found this out yesterday with my melee character. Normally I can OHK legendary bots in Watoga but since that patch every time I kill them they explode and fly off. Found one a few hundred feet from where it died on top of a bus. 
---
Also it seems like sentry bots do this as well even if they are not legendary. I can't even grab one thing from them before they explode and all the loot is gone. 
---
There's a small, hand-held Sonic Emitter in the New Vegas DLC, Old World Blues, I doubt we'll find any in Appalachia.
---
But there's also Sonya, an eyebot with a sonic pulse modification to it from the Big Dig quest in Fallout 4. This one was built from scratch and is large enough to fit as a heavy weapon. 
---
No, not working. I opened at least 4 sealed doors. Only one with the plan, but can't pick it up. 
---
You can use all three vendor terminals again as well.
---
STASH box now holds 800 units, and there's 1 new  booze related questline. ALOT of bugs are fixed, TSE weps are no longer god-tier. 
---
That trailer is for some stuff we got already, but also some stuff coming in the next month or so.
---
I'm willing to bet that a timescale multiplier was applied to a timescale value referenced elsewhere.
---
Yes it‚Äôs one of the best ways I‚Äôve found if you have two doors and you want me to have separate power
---
I can''t agree because my opinion differs.
---
Try it again with lvl 3 GunFu, and a Calibrated/Severe Lever Action or Tweaked Automatic Handmade/Combat rifle.
---
You'll run out of AP with a Hardened Hunting Rifle before you kill anything in VATS with it.
---
Key is once per server.
---
If someone already got it, you're out of luck. And if you used your Keycards, you'll have to get them again. And they are ALSO once per server.
---
It's not fun.
---
I went there three more times tonight, and it was unlocked and only had a purified water in it each time.  I have not seen it filled and locked since the update.
---
I guess it's possible that each time I see it someone had already unlocked it and took everything except the water... but not very likely, I think.
---
Correct spelling, have an upvote.
---
Nah, it's not in yet.
---
The bulk of items in his room aren't available for CAMPS. They haven't even been datamined as upcoming Atom Shop items.
---
Someone beat you to it.  Better luck next time.
---
Too bad it still has its seat.
---
They're unbanning a lot of people so congrats üëç I'm hoping I'm soon. 
---
Just to night I sat waiting patiently for a 2 to take his first steps out of the vault. It felt like it took forever for him to come out but when he did I drew his attention to the brown paper bag I head left on the ground. He finally picked it up and took off exploring the area just out side the vault, I sat invisible watching him for a few minutes before I finally sent him a message telling him to drink it. I continued to follow him from the shadows without a reply. Down the hill he went. He made his way to the little shack and started playing the banjo, all of a sudden I had lost sight of him, so I circled around the shack to see if he had jumped off the other side. Nope he wasn't there, so I opened my map think he just slipped by me but he wasn't in the area. I started searching the map for him, I finally found him a little east of the Toxic Dried Lakebed. He stayed in one spot for about 10 mins, I continued to check on him via the map as I set the trap for another unexpecting new player, continuing to check on him as I waited. He made it to Eastern Regional Pen before he FT back to the vault where he saw me waiting with another brown paper bag. I kind you not he ran over and took the other NukaShine and quickly ran off. 
---
I about died laughing during this whole process. And as mean as it may sound i think I have found my new favorite hobby.
---
Yeah I found that the first time and then had to get get them again. That‚Äôs why I asked before opening them again. If I hop servers do I need to get a new keypad code? Cause I‚Äôve been hopping servers trying to get the key. 
---
No idea on Adrenal but my bloodied are doing the same as before.
---
It would be a nice mod for power armor.
---
One less thing to think about when you're nuking.
---
Would you happen to know if once I get the key pad code if that changes if I server hop
---
Yup.
---
AND if you generate a code and someone goes to the location after you to generate their own code, THAT code will be the one that works, not YOURS.
---
Gotta do it FAST.
---
Whoever made the comment just now just message me on here on my account as a personal message because I cannot see your message on my post

Ugh üòë 
---
All new content are coming one day a week so until 19 on this month you can brew and get drunk a with BiV 
---
Find the civil war top hat plan. Only takes 1 cloth to make and sells for an obscene amount of caps.
---
Rhe metamorphosis is complete, Sam's an ACTUAL caveman..
---
Do you mean the Tinker's workbench where you can bulk junk? Usually if it does what you described it's because the bench is placed where the animation is being blocked by a nearby object. They just changed the animation for that bench so it's possible the new animation might be interfering with a nearby object. Move the bench to a more open area and see if that does it.

radscorpion egg omelettes. Regular ones cure one addiction. The tasty ones cure them all.  
---
\~1/5 chance of spawning a wave (or more) of them at Hemlock holes workshop.
---
So this new patch is only for this week? Sorry, im confused. (which isn‚Äôt out of the norm)
---
Any updates on this?? Sadly I'm traveling at the moment and as such can't log in to check myself. I'd just got a nice bloodied/adrenal/nerd rage stack going at 19% HP before I left and if it's been nerfed while I've been away I'll be pretty disappointed :-( 
---
Sure you were the only one. 
---
Phew. Lol. Thanks. Hopefully they add it in
---
On top of a red rocket store by Morgantown.  I never knew it had Help spelled out on top of it until I get spawned there. 
---
Just traveled up there to see and yes a vault has been added and terrain changed a little. Use to be a cove with a couple chairs and collapsed tent but all that has been removed and the vault added. 
---
Same :( I just made a ton of plasma cores and found out everytime I fast traveled I lost a core and when I swapped weapons I lost core..... ammo amount would be core count....
---
To add to this they should let us take level 35 legendary pieces and upgrade them to level 50 like with the blade of bastet
---
Yep, two of my three attempts my code didn‚Äôt work. The third attempt worked, but the keys were gone.
---
I gave up lol
---
Go look in the small bunker looking buildings in cranberry bog they are frequently there. Currently have legs and wetsuit for marine armor
---
Did it happen to look like this? [https://imgur.com/Hvitytv](https://imgur.com/Hvitytv)  
---
I ported to the same event and landed there... I didn't want to get banned and right after I ported in someone dropped a nuke on Fissure Prime Site so I left and went play with the queen.
---
What I really want to see with the purveyor is the ability to upgrade existing legendaries to not only these mods/stats but also bump the levels.  Get a sweet level 30 sword?  It doesn‚Äôt become junk, you can invest a bit and upgrade it to 50.
---
Why do you ASSume he immediately jumped to a conclusion? 
---
And of course, once of the shield options needs to be a STOP SIGN shield, just like in the old Gamma World module cover, "Famine in Far-Go".
---
Skyrim with guns 
---
Level 5 btw best game I've ever played btw
---
I just need the arm plans have everything else
---
anyone know if once we get the actual TNT Dome 7 Key if we can server hop with that? i‚Äôve seemed to have kept that like the others but the plans aren‚Äôt showing up even when the door is locked.
---
Think the blocking action, but useful. 
---
As someone with hundreds and hundreds of hours in FO76, I can definitely say every YouTube review I've watched has had many valid criticisms about the game. I don't think Bethesda would even deny that. 
---
Another thread said they had to interact with Biv multiples times to get him to activate the quest.
---
Asking the deal questions
---
It's been a couple of months since my last disconnect. 
---
Could look into Remote Play?
---
I really wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing the zone mob level bumped up to savage divide levels.  It‚Äôs such an under utilized zone and has the best ‚Äúpost nuke‚Äù feel of any of the others.
---
In all honesty all the zones could use a second pass on just adding some baselines quests.  The valley just needs it more.
---
I already thought about this as I'm currently on vacation myself. If you have a PS Vita you can set up remote play to access your ps4 away from home. You can also setup remote play on a pc or laptop.
---
Unfortunately I don't have a PS vita and I didn't bring my laptop so I was unable to do either. I have, however, successfully used remote play previously on my laptop in the past and it's not bad. I don't suggest it for actual game play though due to latency and the devices have to throw and catch signals.
---
Hope this helps. 
---
Headcannon: personal vault. 
---
Disable or fix your mods.  "fucking moron".
---
maybe search for the issue and see its your mods causing it.
---
What did the op post say
---
Disable your mods and/or custom .ini file. 
---
Not Bethesda's problem you fucking moron
---
Sony recently added Remote Play to iOS devices if that helps
---
Nice searching for an easy fix to a common problem, you (not gonna insult).
---
Probably an 8 year old. Good job!
---
It does. You need to confirm the key is there then get your code and book it back to the key.
---
Griefing is any action with no objective in-game benefit which results in the frustration, annoyance, or harassment of another player.
---
Destroying someone's CAMP and/or following them doing SLAP damage until they leave the server is absolutely griefing.
---
I know this is 3 months old. But I still have to let people know that for whatever reason super mutants carry far more pipe rifles now than they do hunting rifles. I just killed about 12 supers and only one gave me some 308s. Has the previous been changed to your knowledge? If so what is the new best way to find 308s?
---
It wouldn't let me pick up the plan either, but I checked my inventory and it was in there
---
People like you who do these PSA‚Äôs are fucking saints just helping the common man and I thank you 
---
Lmao search bar you fucking moron
---
This happens when the .ini file in the Documents/MyGames/Fallout76 folder (not the .ini in the game folder) is marked "read only" and doesn't update the lines that load the texture files. If you're running mods you need to update the custom.ini archives lines with the new ones from the Fallout76.ini file. If it happens when not running mods it's because the Fallout76.ini file was either marked read only by mistake and couldn't update or there was an error downloading the update and the Fallout76.ini file in the game folder didn't update. Make sure the .ini files are not marked "read only" and use the Bethesda Launcher to verify the integrity of the game files. Once that's done it should be fixed.
---
I tried to find remote play for android as I have an Xperia phone, but apparently my device is not supported. 
---
Most people learn after like 2 or 3 deaths. Not 20+. 
---
The almost look like some sort of radar, or a radio transmitter of some sort. Maybe to either locate or attract the squatch?
---
Good point. The ones in chassis were 25%. I'm not sure I've picked up any lying around since the hotfix. I'll have to keep an eye on those. Thanks. 
---
It's an alarm clock. Just a nod to the original Pip-Boy from Fallout 1, it doesn't do anything in Fallout 76.
---
Well, I know what I'm doing next time I log in.
---
CONFIRMED: you don't even need the key to get the plans. You can skip all the steps. Fast travel to black Mountain ordinance works (TNT dome 7 is a 15 second run from the spawn point) server hop until the door is open and the plans are on the table. This literally only took me 5 tries!
---
Scrap all your crops and place them again. It did it to me and all I did since the update was plant razorgrain and corn so I figured it was related to that and it was.
---
Nukacola quantum X-01 paint is cool too. Not as cool though. And its free with a little in game work. 
---
I'm having this issue on XB1
---
Well there it is, because I'm usually jumping from the savage divide (camp) to the Forest (Vault 76). 
---
Most of the content is permanent, but there is a limited time event going on that has to do with fasnacht masks.
---
nope.  Love the story
---
All 6 that I‚Äôve looted today have been at exactly 25% and my luck is at 13. 
---
yes. just keep trying. took me about 30 hops
---
No I mean each weekly update adds new contents to the game . Brewing is Not limited time is a quest and repeatable ones . You can now obtain milk from Brahmins , a new random vendor that sells lemonades and there‚Äôs a Nuka Quantum paint for X01 available in Game now 
---
Next week there will be the first limited time event Just for 7 days
---
Therea a good amount of more building limit as well.
---
Really? Ill have to red up on that. Thanks!
---
Fervor the best part. Guys best comeback was calling me a libitard, and accused me of wrong doing after I told him to stop seeking revenge. 
---
ok cool ty
---
Awesome! Thank you so much!
---
I‚Äôm so excited üòë
---
Reporting is the new toy to try out for some people.
---
After the initial reporting wave, it will slow, especially when nothing seems to happen, as you will not get any feedback about your report, so you will never know and the incentive to report for no reason will lessen.
---
Launch a nuke on the queen and tag all the enemies that spawn. Don‚Äôt do it to someone else‚Äôs nuke tho or you might ruin their queen fight. 
---
Some dev stayed after work and fixed that on their personal time because it bothered them so much. I only suspect this because it's something I'd do.
---
I think it has the most unique story in the franchise 
---
I mean he is a drunk robot. It would kinda make sense that you had to try and get his attention. Just like getting a drunk in real life to do something for you. Lol. It is the DMV realism all over again. 
---
Nice mods, you fucking moron.
---
do they have the same attatchements like barrel and stuff.
---
Watoga is littered with dog food. 
---
The irony is that it was already figured out before either of you, so neither of you originally found it. Not trashing videos, by all means, just silly to be going "Give me credit, I discovered this!" (Which I'm not accusing you of here, G\_Patch).  I just didn't post the steps and gave only hints to get folks started, hoping to maintain some of the actual mystery behind the puzzle. :P
---
If everybody pulls their weight she‚Äôs not too hard to kill. It‚Äôs all about DPS so heavy guns and melee works really well. Anti-Armor guns shred her aswell. Try to have at least one shotgunner with rank 3 enforcer so she stays crippled on the ground longer. 
---
I‚Äôd be interested to know what guns/ builds you and your friends are running because it sounds like y‚Äôall are almost there just need a little more DPS. 
---
The one thing I will say is her loot pool is awful, killed 5 queens today and on 2 separate occasions got 1star wood armor. That should not be a thing for an end game boss enemy that‚Äôs a total bullet sponge. I honestly thought BGS had addressed this in the last patch but I guess not.
---
What console do you play on? I‚Äôd be happy to join y‚Äôall for the next fight and lend a hand if you‚Äôre on XB1! 
---
I think you might be exaggerating the severity of the situation. 
---
https://thebestschools.org/magazine/15-logical-fallacies-know/
---
Just because you and a couple other people perceive this to be an issue doesn't factually make it an issue. 
---
All the this right here!!!
---
Lots of comments on this, but was this fixed today?
---
Yeah but... I‚Äôm just trying to wrap my brain around how a big ass wooden or metal shield makes a non-battle royale game the same as Fortnite.
---
Nope.
---
My Brahminshake brings all the boys to the yard,
---
An they‚Äôre like, it‚Äôs better than yours...
---
Any area in particular I should focus on or just hunt and peck?
---
This. 
---
I wasted about 200 caps fast travelling back and forth multiple times recollecting the key cards trying to get the key today. Beyond frustrated - it's the same curse as the Kill Evan quest..
---
Instead of implementing penalties nip it in the bud.
---
In order to be able to deal any damage to other players one has to have enough caps to cover the cost of one's death.
---
If this condition is not met one cannot deal any damage to other players.
---
Has anyone nuked Silva Homestead? That place is covered with corn. So far, though, Morgantown is best. 
---
It's not too bad - just be sure to check first if the doors are closed, go grab that keycode and keep an eye on the map to make sure there isn't anyone else lurking the areas. Be sure to use the keycards in the right order though - I didn't think it'd matter and that was an extra trip around the map for me.
---
He has a lot of razor grains and corn, I'll tel him. Thank you!
---
I went to the cabin 3 different times, the door was closed all 3 times, and no key inside.
---
They‚Äôve already said they‚Äôre looking into changes and making your C.A.M.P. invincible too when in Pacifist mode. I‚Äôm too lazy to link it but just do a search and see that they‚Äôve responded to complaints like these. I get your frustration but it won‚Äôt make them release it any sooner. 
---
Yes! Absolutely! I hate having to line up my 5 power armors to see which one is which üôÑ
---
I think you can make it at the food factory but I‚Äôm not sure 
---
Wouldn't it be one step closer to Skyrim?
---
Yea, I played through the main game without setting foot in that area once. They should put another big 3\* nuke boss like the SBQ there.
---
I don't think you're a moron. I think you're pretty neat.
---
My apologies, you‚Äôre absolutely right!  I forgot about this - I tried once, found it broken, so never went back.  I‚Äôm going to check on it tomorrow to see if it was just a one-time glitch or if not, if it‚Äôs been fixed. 
---
I hate Stingwings.  Although the scene was funny in the movie Caveman.
---
I still just want to know why in the world we can't favorite power armor. 
---
If you think that's a good game, play Black Desert with me. 
---
Hmm - I suppose it's vaguely similar to cheating if I use something to make it easier to manage items in my inventory and give me a clearer, easier to understand listing of weights and ways to orgainze items listed in my inventory.  But, i don't think any significant number of reasonable people could have the kind of negative outlook on such mods as they would with something like aimbots, wallhacks, or exploits which enable your character to better resist damage or otherwise be more powerful in relation to other players in combat?
---
Great battle. What power armour and weapons were you using?
---
That part isn‚Äôt bad it‚Äôs all the server hoping involved haha
---
Chemed out Shady Sands Shuffle
---
I'm not even from Florida....
---
Let‚Äôs duet 
---
I'm in the same boat, I really hope we get another bump in budget once we can place items. 
---
Damn i could've saved 126 caps if i knew about this spot before
---
This will allow for my Captain America RP...unarmed + shield + patriot paint combat armour
---
Are you able to see the pillar before swiping the cards and before imputing the one key generator if so don‚Äôt even bother generating key code 
---
I've seen several on the cliffs in the southern part of the Savage Divide.
---
Same for me as well. 
---
Can you wait a few more minutes, adding you now! esimpson212
---
Just bought the game tonight and no alcohol for me.  
---
I will keep reporting them until the support team that has to go through each report finally tells the devs to give us both seperated PvE and PvP servers so that the asshats can go to the pvp server and leave normal and sane people alone.
---
Blue screen. I've gotten this error daily since I got the game. I've seen these errors very frequently in FO4, one of the reasons I stopped playing fo4 as it made the game unplayable. RIP. I didn't get this crash until I started playing that game. Apparently it has something to do with corrupted memory. There are a few methods to fix your memory such as a database rebuild, but it didn't seem to help much for me.
---
I'll dump a few good legendaries at your feet  if you wait
---
I thought about trying black dessert but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a pay to win like neverwinter.
---
17 gigs of updates, and STILL this is a problem. My main quest now is to trick out all the power armors, and this makes it near impossible.
---
So... RP as Trevor from GTA V? 
---
I just get it off ghouls and super mutants
---
Server went down about 5 minutes in. Sorry my dude.
---
Stuff like that is really dope and I did shit like that on 4. I feel as long as it doesn‚Äôt interact with other people‚Äôs game then go for it. Just don‚Äôt do anything stupid and get banned lol
---
Hah, yeah - if it helps it only took me a couple tries to get the key itself and once you get it that's the last you gotta worry about that part. It did take a few tries to get the actual paint plan but the plus side is if you have the key for the other nuka cola silo (#3 I think it is?) you can go farm some colas and maybe get some quantum in the process. 
---
:( it's okay
---
Yep,I‚Äôm mad now.
---
Don't use mods in an online game. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
The riverside walkway with covered tables and the cafe-esque room connected to it behind Phoenix bots shop is where I go.
---
Can Do perk and anywhere with lots of trash cans, like the Whitespring. 
---
This is Travis BTW. Unblock me dude
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôm going to try and wait till I can get my friend on. So they can confirm that the doors are closed while I get the code and fast travel to them. 
---
I dont understand what makes it 'skyrim' makeshift junk weapons in the a post apocalyptic wasteland would be largely melee and close quarters which would mean there would be a large need for melee protection more then a bullet proof vest right, I mean if a dude with a lead pipe and a stop sign shield seems skyrim to you then I don't know you would use in it's place but it seems to fit the theme to me
---
I make a whiterun food run every once in a while and this keeps me stocked up even at just rank 1 of the perk
---
Just finished feed the people event and got crash, opened my pipboy got a crash, disconnecting from servers for little stuff. Feel like with every patch this game goes 10 steps back 2 steps forward.
---
I'll 3d print you some power armor 
---
Assumed someone is insane for wanting to pvp is wierd., but they've already said they're looking into separating these 2 playing styles completely. 
---
How are you seeing this trend?  Do you have access to the reports that are filed?
---
If you like the effect, the white lights project the same thing!
---
The hotfix corrected the problem with my main. I'm back in business. Still need work done?
---
No, only that people on this sub are calling out for others to report it. My point in to counter that, and say dont muck up the reports for devs when there might be real harassment going on.
---
Same. Can Do is the best because the food doesn't spoil, and Good Doggy on top of that makes it very worthwhile. 
---
Fixed, thanks guys. Pwnd.
---
That is awesome!  A worthy tribute to Mothman!
---
I did this and it seems to have helped substantially:

Does it fit the dark souls theme to you?
---
I proposed a while back a new heavy weapon at the end of that quest chain you could learn to make, a sonic emitter. Kind of like the gatling plasma, but with a big speaker on the end. They disrupt the sonar signals that Scorched/Scorchbeasts give off. Have it work on a fairly narrow cone, but wave it at Scorched and they stop being able to tell friend from enemy for a short while... They frenzy, essentially. Aim it at a Scorchbeast and they become disoriented and can't fly.
---
In a group it would be great because someone could be designated crowd control and keep the SB's grounded. It's also good for disrupting masses of Scorched. But it's not great solo since you have to keep swapping to a weapon that does damage.
---
Balance factor would likely be weight and chewing through energy cells at a pretty high rate.
---
scorched killer receiver?
---
Want to play tommorow? Like none my friends have 76 and I need a teammate so if you're down thatd be great
---
Your not a moron, your special.
---
Only alcoholics go to meetings, and those meetings cut down on my drinking time.
---
I want some explosive bullet turrets like in Harper's Ferry. Those things are nasty.
---
Alright thanks
---
Why?
---
Because I was halfway through it and you ruined the surprise dickhead.
---
Bet, message my acc and ill join you tommorow, its viv198222
---
Can Do and Whitespring. On it. Many thanks. 
---
The only person without a pair here is your spoiling ass.
---
I recommend doing this after an update, especially one as large as the most recent one. After the ps4 boots up give it a few minutes to refresh your library. I've had it take 10-15 minutes to retrieve all of the thumbnails because my library is so large. 
---
Since when do you have to buy them,they come with the basic building kit everyone starts with?
---
The only I ever got from there is Canned Stew and that was from completing Feed The People. 5xp for an hour but it spoils.
---
Wait! How‚Äôd u get them??
---
You win the internet
---
Thanks I tried that but the launcher still does not work. I am happy though I have a work around, really appreciate your help. 
---
From other reports it actually looks like the sound source is offset from his location. That's why it's louder from the tattoo parlor.
---
Are you the person who killed me today?   =) 
---
Have it do minimal damage too so the support player "taps" for loot.
---
Farming lots of technical data. I‚Äôm able to message ppl screenshots?
---
I‚Äôm having trouble as well - I can‚Äôt find it in the build menu, and if I read it at a train station, nothing happens.
---
Has anybody figured it out, or is it a glitch?
---
If you could please do message me the screenshots
---
The ole switcharoo. I remember doing stuff like this in other games. 
---
It's not out yet, so nowhere.
---
Alright will do
---
PC but the quest seemed to be fixed after completely restarting my PC
---
This is something they should‚Äôve added to fallout 4
---
Send me a screen shot
---
I listen to random goth playlists, or some creepy atmospheric stuff, or Fallout '86: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/39mBSpsdsYgfa438eU8mJa?si=SBBAhS9VS2CDnPwYXY4GKw](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/39mBSpsdsYgfa438eU8mJa?si=SBBAhS9VS2CDnPwYXY4GKw)
---
Ok, that's neat, but how do you GET those recipes to complete the daily? 
---
I saw a picture of it in the Atom Shop on the Tour Guide outfit?
---
Platform? I have 30+ cans you can have on Xbox.
---
They literally employ people who get paid to do that. Are you hoping costumer support people lose their jobs or something? Like... what?
---
Shush you. Don't give away my favorite campground.
---
it was drink nuka shine   
---
but it did fix itself for some reason all my quest items where invisible until i restarted my PC
---
Its not out
---
Yep, logged in after the patch and now have a dirt road, power poles, alongside my [Camp](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/that-bluesman/screenshot/11733968#), had that spot since beta, there goes the neighborhood. 
---
Bah, PS4. The offer is greatly appreciated however and I thank you.
---
Yet you‚Äôre still crying about it. Understandable 
---
But the Grafton monster also spawns at Poseidon Energy/Charleston Train Station.
---
I found a fix, but you would had have to create a blueprint of your base sometime before scrapping, then you can place down the blueprint of it for free (because you have the components).
---
When I take bounties, sometimes I cannibalize the corpse if it's hanging around. 
---
But I always leave fertilizer, spoiled food, and whole bones inside of their loot bag (I never take anything myself).
---
That‚Äôs mama dolces not the factory lmao 
---
The community is what does it for me. Both here and in-game. 9/10 players I encounter are nice. The gameplay can seem a bit empty, but I like it like that. I kinda get to make my own adventure.
---
Sure the game had plenty of problems early on, but Bethesda has, especially recently done a lot of work getting things right. The coming updates look killer and I'm hoping it continues past 2019, and have a good feeling it will.
---
The city employs people to pick trash up off the streets let me just throw garabage out of my car window. Dont want someone to lose a job. Makes sense 
---
Lol contract a fallout 76 mafia hit...kids,lol
---
The Black bird paint came out when I didn't realize how PA worked. I never really use PA but 4 I collected everything including them, I was reeling from the fact I couldn't have am insane selection of legendaries or even a camp decorated with stuff I found. I questioned (and still do) Bethesda's model, how could they sell atom shop stuff if we didn't have enough space to store them. I also thought that each set was going to take up ~70 stash space + a chassis to swap parts out to. So at the time painting PA that I never was going to hold on to wasn't a concern. 
---
Top hat plan also.  Craft for 1 cloth shells for 30-40 depending on charisma
---
How do I do that? 
---
I just looked through my crafting table, and the basic laser pistol at level 5 now does 21 damage. The 10mm only does 15 at the same level. I think it is right where it needs to be, and even has a few extra points to make up for lack of penetration.
---
Most griefers are players that have like 200+ hours and are bored of the crappy end game.
---
Good point haha 
---
They have it made, but they haven't released it yet.  It will come sometime within Wild Appalachia.
---
If your on xbox I can try to help.
---
Ahh. Sorry, just looking strictly for dog food. Thanks though.
---
My standard level 15 does 115, only have 2 stars of shotgunner so far. I'm stoked to finish this shotgun build.
---
Good grief..... Some will never learn. 
---
Same thing happened to me except I had to drink wine.  Beer is much easier to come by than wine. üò≠
---
I think they should work with one-handed weapons only in order to give those weapons a niche. Alt-click could raise the shield instead of ADS/power attack.
---
It should‚Äôve been prioritized a long time ago though... but good to hear that it is finally in planning. Was on vacation for a few days, didn‚Äôt read the latest patch and headed online straight after the update downloaded a few hours ago. I was just furious that it‚Äôs still possible to die by slap damage. But if this is true with the camp, I hope You can choose this. Because I still want to interact with people, just love it when someone comes by when I‚Äôm at my camp and they check it out. I just don‚Äôt want to get bothered from other players anymore when I don‚Äôt want to. I did pvp quite a lot though, but just when both parties where alright with it. 
---
No I‚Äôm saying that the factory  makes dog food lmao 
---
Preach br√∂ther! I completely agree. Somethings gotta give here. 
---
Why not just make the flare-gun do that?
---
Yours might have been the post I seen
---
 Like I said it wasn't a video just some steps 
---
According to the wiki they do not. I'll have to look tomorrow to be sure.
---
My BE laser one shot everything with few a exceptions maybe you don't have the right build?
---
I'll just want to see if I could kill it. 
---
Oh I swear you could make it there. Sorry for wasting your time mate 
---
Yeah. They use to be snakes but mutated together. 
---
are you talking about shields as a concept of self protection or are you talking about stop sign shields being dark souls? Cause I'm pretty sure there isn't any junk weapons in DS. 
---
Asking the meal questions
---
You can see some fish in this game. 
---
PC too
---
That‚Äôs not how mutations in the Fallout universe work
---
It seemed like it worked, you just had to kill the thing you were hunting before whatever the local spawn is.
---
And I hate anything flying in the fallout games. Not hard to kill, but hard to hit. Those cazadores or whatever they were called were awful.
---
This mutation is a joke. I can deal with the negatives of all the others but this one takes the cake for most useless. 90% of the time I don't even go into last stands because the damage overkills me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
No reason
---
No anti armor perk?
---
And you didn‚Äôt sell off a farmer‚Äôs goat to a Giant.
---
No, brother, you weren't wasting my time in the slightest. I had never heard of doing before, tried looking other sources to confirm and planned on checking tomorrow. If you hadn't said anything, I may not of even known of it and for that I thank you.
---
Then they should gr!ef each other but leave me and others alone... I get it, there is not much of and game besides circlejerk farming at whitesprings or fishersite, Iam lvl 160 with my main and 80 with my second so i know how it is. But again, boredom should not result in this behavior and that this game makes it still rewarding (slap damage kills) is simply annoying at this point. Pvp can be fun, I do it here and there with consent of both parties so no one loose valuable junk for example. But Iam questing/ crafting it‚Äôs just a b!itch move to attack me... 
---
Yeah I just went back and found it. So does this mean the overseer is alive since she knows you nuked a location that was a fissure?
---
Good news, you don't lose the quest if you DC. You do have to start from the beginning, but hey, it's a step up.
---
I like the idea of a throwable emitter.  Perhaps something that fits in a teddy bear.
---
Xo1 has the best stats but I like the way t-51 looks more. 
---
It's the other way around, the daily gives you the recipes. I did one with regular beer and got the recipe for Pickaxe.
---
I'll do whatever it takes to survive. Even drink some toilet water if they added it in. 
---
If your running a bloodied build why tf do you have empath??
---
Try the commerce area of watoga
---
I don‚Äôt see how that stops radiation from making him huge, and even more enraged then normal. 
---
You can.. You make a text post and link the screen shots and videos in the post body.
---
I fuckin doubt that. How would you have known to find them cards and the exact locations without knowing what you‚Äôre going after. Stop the lies homie. 
---
lvl 1 drinks and ends up inside the Wendigo cave 
---
I've been doing them on multiple characters.  First thing is it seems to not trigger until a full 24 hours from when that character finished the last quest (not 100% sure but some characters had to wait hours to do even though others could do as soon as I got home). As for rewards, he either teaches you a new recipe right away (like blackwater brew) and asks you to craft it (then does not reward you with a second recipe because you just got one) or he asks you to drink something and test the effects of it (and that will reward an actual recpie plan to click on and learn)
---
It doesn't need to add a buff or anything. It would just be nice to have to flesh out the survival gameplay and add more to the world as a whole, so it feels more alive. 
---
Ive gotten 1 so far and it was only a champagne that makes you fall faster
---
I know. But who is to say that there can't be other ways. ;-)
---
White lights? The disco ball?
---
Yep, both stock, same level, one 2 star one no stars, same dammage.  I hope they change it
---
Snaptail Reed makes sugar. Load up on that and get xp while you're doing it. 
---
No the dangle lights, white bulbs
---
I can't access the damn keypad :( 
---
The lore, which is extremely important to the Fallout world. Fallout lore shouldn‚Äôt be changed so we can have snake squids...
---
I used to have a base up there cos you can get lead near there, here is a permanently respawning M2 and the monsters are easy prey for points. It is also within quick walking distance of some civil war stuff giving you easy access to extra steel it is rather bleak and empty. 
---
They last until taken or the server resets.
---
Well there was sort of a nerf, but I think it was about 3 updates ago. And I‚Äôm not sure it had much to do with charge amounts, I think it was more about the frequency of cores found around the world 
---
Just chiming in to say that this is the first spot I went to after opening the game for the first time after the new expansion.  Cheers!
---
Bet what ur psn name
---
But those are for Linking. I play on console like Xbox but I have Xbox app that allows me to save footage and screenshots I can upload.
---
Where is a good place to find that?
---
The stairs have a slightly different design then the ones already in game 
---
My b I‚Äôm on XB1, I‚Äôm still down to duet tho 
---
Speaking of, did you see there a new unmarked quest for X01? 
---
I've seen 2 vengeful mothmen.  The most recent was a bit north of Pleasant Valley Station on the railroad tracks.  I should note that I was also wearing the Tin Foil Hat, so that possibly could have contributed to the sighting.  I used the same route twice in 2 days with the hat, and saw a mothman both times, one wise, one vengeful.  Haven't tried it in a while as the hat makes you look like an ass.
---
How can we do that?
---
if you on in the next 30 min still ill throw you a few of those for free bud
---
Get green thumb perk and run the water near flat woods.
---
Yeah but when survival mode comes man I'm I excited if the can pull it off man that will be fun not gonna lie. Even the little gameplay we saw looked fun and challenging.
---
Never mind I found some thank you (:
---
Can't even take a picture of some fucking stairs anymore without having your motives questioned anymore, unbelievable. 
---
Its from daily quest.nukashine dlc . If y interested to buy the high voltage hefe , come visit my bar üç∫üëç
---
You can be in my FO76 band, we still need a tuba player and we can skype you in. Gonna rock this wasteland like its 2076 and get wasted on Nukashine!
---
I really hope there isnt one or two players with 15 copies of this. That would be such a dick move. 
---
Uhhh, in April
---
My luck is 10 and the 3 I looted today were all exactly 25%.
---
Trimming armour 10k
---
The most commonly  nuked spot has all flora except Violet. The Whitespring has tons of Yellowcake and Fluorescent but also good amounts of Crimson and Cobalt. Your can make at least 4-5 of each of the latter depending on where the nuke center is. 
---
Will definitely try it too, I mean there‚Äôs no b!tch!ng in survival mode from me then haha. You know what could happen and that is the special thrill, but it has to be separated in my opinion, because I still want that ‚Äûnormal‚Äú fallout gameplay with looting, exploring and questing. 
---
I think you‚Äôre getting some bad luck. I found two just recently that had over 90% in those frames.
---
Two of those used to cost me about 50@% of my budgrt
---
Can't get Skype sorry
---
https://xboxclips.com/ just use this site for that for now to link to here put your gamertag in there
---
It's every 20 hours.  You have to go talk to him.  
---
It just slowly ferments fermentable alcohol. Obviously its slow, but it's quicker than letting it ferment in your inventory.
---
This would help a lot because I have a xo1, T-51 nuka cola, and a ultrasite set and I have to place all of them out and pick and choose!
---
I think it takes around 10 minutes for it to ferment
---
I like the way x01 looks with the red lamp on so I use that. I say just use whatever pieces you have parts for though. Have t60 calibrated shocks and x01 jetpack? Slap those bitches together. I also carry excavator set on me incase I run across a bunch of ore to mine
---
Yeah I was lucky I had free atoms when it came out. That one day skin crap was the greediest bullshit I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
There‚Äôs no other skin that compares in sheer badassery so far. I just hope they make it free in game for all you people instead of putting it back in the shop.
---
That wasn't possible. TSEs didn't do any damage except a sliver. If you were hitting back when you heard the TSE sissle noise, you had it coming. 
---
Melee damage in pvp is perfect. Armor and perks are more important than your weapon in a melee build, but you still need to be able to kill quickly if you want to survive. My bloodied dclaw would be worthless if I crumpled at the feet of every foe, riddled with bullets and failure. That said, the only reason a good melee player should ever even be able to beat a good ranged build is by just being good at using that play style. I often engage people in wooded areas, so I can sneak through bushes to avoid a vats crit headshot. Or dart behind corners or above ledges in urban areas and go in for the batman drop attack. Ranged weapons will always have the advantage. Just get the kill before I close the distance and one hit your ass. If you don't die in one hit, I'll rage message you and whine on reddit, maybe report you to Bethesda for being a cheater and claim that you duped your way to superiority. Or I'll just leave because, let's be fair, that is WAAAY less effort than the former option. 
---
Can't wait for pacifist to disable pvp altogether, some of the people that all got unbanned today, some of them are griefing trying to make people leave the game with their duped equipment letting them one shot almost everyone, it's ridiculous.
---
I'd love some bos plans can I get in on that too?
---
Requirements would be materials and the level armor you wish to upgrade to
---
Platform ? Caps ?
---
And that would be perfect incentive to re-add the M1911
---
White springs on the river steam there‚Äôs 4 plants easy to spot 
---
Curious on where anybody even gets these plans after they updated the vendor lists. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. 
---
What legendary trading shop? I thought the exchange vendor was a future patch...
---
Only, I didn't GET this one today. So what you're saying is, bethesda is forcing us to trade with other players for the shit we haven't gotten yet? 
---
That's...annoying. w
---
Ps4
---
70 caps each
---
I must just be really unlucky. Why would they target their camps??
---
It's not at atom shop item though, it's under security I believe or floors. That stair object is an item you can actively use right now since launch
---
They were selling this one day skin with no announcement back when the game was such a broken mess that you‚Äôd have had to be insane to spend $20 on the skin. The ‚Äòexclusivity‚Äô of it is due to corporate greed and the game‚Äôs failures. 
---
I have the skin, and personally want it to be either put up again or given free in game.
---
This. This says it all. 
---
bos plans? you mean the armor mod?
---
Yea, as long as we understand what he's saying, it's okay. Not everyone needs to be a fuckin grammar Nazi or constantly pointing out "you're supposed to say whilst, not while." And OP might not be a native English speaker sooo 
---
Make it so.
---
Drop cite c2 will spawn the officer suit, just haven't had any luck yet, also flooded trainyard and forward station delta will spwan it too, just no luck myself yet. Also turning in technical data will reward you with various bos stuff, I got thr knihht paint today for the t60 armor. 
---
And here I am hoarding my 220+ cans of dog food for emergencies
---
Either or just looking for one's I dont have. Will pay up for bos combat arms or legs plan.
---
It was. It was a 1 day only 1800 atom release back when no one really had enough faith in the game to drop that much money. That and it was unannounced. Most people didn‚Äôt realize until someone put up a PSA here
---
I was literally thinking about this earlier today!
---
I love the way T60 looks best.  I wish the quantum paint was for the t60 instead
---
What system are you on before I get to excited.
---
My son started a game and I play it with him a little.  We used that area for our first camp. All we got was a frame and pieces he can‚Äôt use yet.   The building is pretty good tho.   We have since moved camp in between train yard and airport until done with responders quest line.  
---
Yea I'll be on man. My gamertag is dominashun28, greatly appreciated. I can paint your t60 power armor to Knight if you'd like 
---
I think ultracite PA has better energy and radiation resistance while x01 has better ballistic resistance.
---
I just love the idea behind X01.
---
I use level 50 T60 simply because it's so dang cheap to repair and all mods are easily available from the Watoga vendor.
---
If anyone wants I can paint power armor to BOS 2 Knight paint. 
---
I‚Äôm the monkey in charge of bananas
---
People will be able to interact with you and your camp but supposedly not do any damage. Everybody‚Äôs got their own criticism of what should or should not be prioritized but at least they‚Äôre working on it and not abandoning the game. 
---
At the end of the day I‚Äôd much rather have stable servers than what you‚Äôre proposing be prioritized. And also they‚Äôre releasing Survival mode soon so they have been working on fixes, just in a way that helps the whole community and not just PvE players. 
---
You can still get one shot with the right build. TSE doesn't have anything to do with it. It all comes down to how you're perked out 
---
Is there a PlayStation equivalent to this?
---
Already confirmed to be worked on kiddo
---
Here's a fun solution.
---
Nuke their camp. I frequently find groups of griefers in little griefing communities. Makes them real easy targets for some nuclear slap damage. They either leave the server or be forced to rebuild their camp. Some of which looked rather expensive.
---
What I was thinking, lure it in somehow
---
Well it does say you only get a chance at a recipe
---
Alright thanks adulto! 
---
OK, I just combined the composition with the picture I took earlier for explaining the entrance of the Fort Defiance Before.
---
I must've gotten insanely lucky then,  did everything on my first try... I'll farm the plans once a day then and after a few days give em out to unlucky players
---
Same. Threat timer is either instant or really long.
---
Why does a game stealth change so much stuff instead of announcing changes?
---
You should get the good doggy perk.  Makes that dog food last longer 
---
&gt; Do onto others as you would do onto yourself. The golden rule.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I simply do not empathize with players being upset witht he way i play the game. I dont think i even have to, or 
---
&gt; that im supposed to.
---
Not surprising. Pretty consistent with the kind of personality flaws that tend toward taking advantage of any situation in order to be cruel to others, as long as there are no consequences. (and just FYI, it's "Do *unto* others...")
---
&gt; Players getting upset is the bad behavior. I shouldnt enable it, encourage or even acknowledge it. You guys cant walk 
---
&gt; into a game to tell me how to treat people.
---
I'd argue that since Bethesda seems to have promised a change to camp pvp, what you are doing isn't much different than taking advantage of the other various flaws and exploits that have been in the game. By your logic it's all fine as long as the game allows it right? I'm sure you never did any of those.
---
Oh and I've tried server-hopping, and 9 times out of ten you can't even get that done fast enough to avoid major or even total damage to your CAMP.
---
&gt; How am i supposed to know whose ok and whose not ok with PvP anyway? 
---
Maybe stick to workshops or attacking players outside of their camp, where slap will serve its intended purpose and you don't have a clear advantage. But I guess you can't deal with a fair fight.
---
&gt; Please wreck my camp. Id be happy to host a PvP battle. I will extend the same courtesy to you. The golden rule.
---
The golden rule goes both ways. I wouldn't wreck your camp if I could. I'd just feel like an asshole, and more importantly I just wouldn't do it anyway because I think it's a shitty way to treat other players. I don't want to PvP battle either. I don't feel like bothering other people and it's just a huge waste of caps and resources to me either way.
---
&gt; Please leave your emotions aside when playing rated MA multiplayer pvp games. Its not my job to manage them. 
---
&gt; Im just playing a fun online pvp game. Nothing shitty about it. Theres no greifing going on. Frankly the whole attitude
---
&gt; that your entitled to true pacifism even though its not in the game is arrogant and dilusional from my perspective.
---
If you knew anything about game design you'd know that developers are actually trying to appeal to and generate emotions in players. That's what keeps people coming back to games. Given the number of people having experiences like i have where someone can in minutes destroy hours of work, I can say that Bethesda is really not doing that great of a job at generating positive emotions in the game. So yeah, you are just straight-up wrong about that.
---
In any case yo it's pretty hard for everyone to completely put their emotions aside when playing games, in light of your little manifesto about how you think people should act. I'd counter that it's much more useful for you to try and remember that there are actual people on the other end when you antagonize and harass players. Given your statements here though, it seems like you really just don't care about other people so I'm not holding my breath.
---
This is not the path I want to go down.
---
https://youtu.be/QBV38QlmayU
---
Yeah, and I was thinking there could be a daily upkeep of the robot for it to function. Like a daily quest to go retrieve a certain junk component the repair-bot would need to continue functioning, or even a bunch of scrapped, raw components it would need in the pretense that they're for repairs for the CAMP.  
---
I dunno, it seemed like a good idea when I thought of it. I like the idea of having another thing to build and throw into my camp; like a sarcastic Mr. Handy floating to and fro complaining about the state of things... plus the idea of not seeing a bunch of nearly empty condition bars over half the things my CAMP would be pretty rad.  
---
I'm still having fun playing the game, despite some of the persistent bugs. Once those get smoothed out, I think it'd be cool to see some options like this.
---
What does the empathy do to the bloody build
---
Then it's not a hotfix, lol. 
---
But HOW? How do I get this "high voltage hefe" recipe we need for today's daily challenge?
---
Dude, I got it and have considered it one of the best perk cards for any build. I'm not saying it happened, but, after this last update is when I seemed to burn through them more. It's like my hunger just got a big ol' boost.
---
You on PC?
---
Don‚Äôt genderfy toxic valley my home is there and I‚Äôm very rarely bothered 
---
I have the knight one 
---
Please don't touch warframe. I have groups of friends who all got banned after 1k hours. I got banned after 2500. DE is just as bad.
---
There is no such thing as X weapon is the best. It all depends on how you like to play. I personally prefer gauss rifles. I would say most think handmades are the best. If you want raw numbers, you can find that on the wiki I believe. 
---
Ah yes
---
I'm suffering the same issues with a TR 1900X 2080 Ti 32gb RAM.  Talking in circles with Beth for at least a week.  It doesn't make sense to me that the game should hang/crash/go unresponsive over network issues.  I can understand the rubberbanding and disconnects, but the way this is breaking right now makes no sense to me.
---
"I'll pour you a drink and you can tell me about your troubles." (in drunk mumbling robot voice)
---
Me as well on PC
---
That's a really good argument. Take an upvote kind sir. :)
---
Raw numbers is what I'm after but the wiki is really incomplete (or atkleast the one I've found) so was hoping someone would know 
---
Asking the squeal questions
---
Sadly, nope. PS4.
---
Addiction chances seem pretty low in my experience. Only time I've ever gotten addicted was when I popped 5 or 6 buffout in 10 minutes by accident.
---
A variant of the Atomic Shop ‚ÄúString Lights‚Äù. The ‚ÄúTwinkling‚Äù variant of it is bugged and projects the same light effect as the lamp. 
---
That sounds pretty awesome. Perfect name for it.
---
Good luck, it‚Äôs gonna be hard to find a full set of matching Ass/Sent armor like that. Definitely check out the fallout76 market and bazaar. You‚Äôll probably be better off piecing it together. I‚Äôve got a trapper right arm with +1 agility I can sell you if you can‚Äôt find the matching set. 
---
Some non nuked plants as well, such as firecracker berries.
---
all i really have is just a few of the suit plans and i have an initiate t60 paintjob so i getting on now let me see if i have extras if others are interested
---
I've noticed that and it seems like there are less cores per server. I just recently built up my core stash thanks to the Poseidon workshop.
---
/r/unexpectedNazeem
---
At that time there was barely anything  you could spend these atoms on anyway so not sure if 20$ argument is even valid.
---
You could literally buy 2 of these easily for free atoms if you just played the game to provide beth support feedback on found glitches instead of whining in the comments.
---
Pretty sure that crapstorm that'd arise if BB is released for free would leave the canvasgate forgotten. 
---
I had the same issue, but i cant get the ADS to work, im not falling through the world anymore. anyone have a clean ini file?
---
Lol üòÜ 
---
Enforcer is such a ridiculously strong perk against almost anything I find. I love it.
---
That lemonade guy ?
---
Ultra lame. I was hoping both Party Boy and Nuka Nut would stack on nukashine. I want beer muscles when I tickle the SBQ's nipples. I also want to go on drunken rampages and wake up in a ditch with a wet leg, a wanted level, and 1100 pounds of someone's junk, but somehow missing my house keys because the bartender thought they were car keys. (F*ck you, Mike. F*ck you very much.) l don't know a bartender named Mike, but I'm imagining the one in question here is named Mike. Naturally. 
---
Okay then I'll to help. By dp do you mean two shot?
---
Asking the heal questions
---
Datamining the game files, that makes it even lamer that you tell everyone about it:p
---
Yeah it has happened to me a few times in exactly the same spot and when I joined it was back at Blacwater Mine as per usual
---
Asking the veal questions
---
I've been getting lots of strange loading problems since the last patch, also xbox. Not horde event related though. Mostly loading screens not showing, making it seem like the game is frozen, more frequent disconnects during loading, and much worse game performance immediately after loading.
---
Disclaimer: wtf OP is doing solo bloodied empath.... No clue.
---
But.... you can make yourself (nearly) invincible. It's like being a glass cannon but you're made of just more cannon.
---
You need the serum recipe or someone that can make them, though, and it was a lot easier to do a few patches ago.
---
If so, please take some pointers from farcry.  Fly fishing was very decent 
---
no i was referring to dps which is usually per second and then also "per-shot" later in the comment but my phrasing was confused. Tomorrow i'm gonna craft a bunch of level 50 weapons and compare the damage without perks on
---
Big Sale.
---
... but less seriously Martial Artist, Incisor, Gladiator.
---
Getting similar problems too!
---
I've also noticed that a pose I purchased that is set as owned when you see it in the Atomic Shop isn't showing when I'm in photomode... Weird!
---
I run Sutton down to Charleston. Super easy super mutants are often their. I use my 10mm since that ammo is super easy to accumulate. I can get a few hundred caps that way without any effort. Then I go to Wes Tek and farm the mutants there. You could always farm cap stashes as well but for minimal effort Sutton to Charleston works for me on the regular. 
---
But isn‚Äôt slap damage limited to 5hp per hit? So it would take at least 50+ hits to kill you? The DC gauntlet does not swing fast enough to do that much damage before you can get to the menu to turn off pacifist mode. Now if you take a workshop or a teammate takes a workshop, I could see you getting killed before being able to turn off pacifist, but not from slap damage. 
---
I am not trying to take away from your argument, just trying to understand what you are talking about. 
---
I get this recipe 
---
Get used to it. I had 3 level 150s jump me today at the food factory. Had to 1v3 them all 3 times in a row b4 they hecked off.
---
Fast forward to after work. Have another 1v2 at the food plant for another hour until those 2 heck off.
---
The jerks are many, the solid allies are few. Welcome to the wasteland. &lt;3
---
Oh you want the actual possible dps of every weapon? I know how to do the math but I don't have all the data, fire rate, damage, etc. But I will tell you that this is going to be an undertaking and I wish you luck good sir.
---
I think i got this recipe yesterday . But i glad to help ppl for complete daily challenges &amp; i sell cheap only for 25 caps each
---
yeah gonna probably just figure the ones i use now andd hope someone fills in the rest soon and TY
---
I've got one, 3 pieces are heavy &amp; the chest has the dense mod.
---
I'm looking for better unyielding arms with ap refresh &amp; fd&amp;c weight reduction &amp; a BE gatlin gun. Caps aren't a priority as I already have over 40k, but if interested make an offer. I'm also not on for another 4 hours.
---
Its worse when you domt have the armor and you try to take a bounty only to find out you are basically doing slap damage 
---
Welcome!
---
Where did you get the hat?
---
Near top of the world, whitesprings, glasses caverns or watoga, flatwoods. 
---
You would want to be close enough to be seen or a short walking distance...
---
Every location always has people of every level looking or needing something...
---
Hope you find a good spot! What platform are you on I could be a customer üòÄ
---
Raider, since it‚Äôs the only kind I can use.
---
Lol oh my goddddd the Bethesda circlejerk goes hard on this sub
---
Unyeilding and weight reduction isnt a bad gig or just vangaurd they all have there perks
---
I'm of two minds here, on the one hand, the BB paint is awesome and more people should have it, and on the other, my PA paint would then be slightly less cool due to being more common..
---
But see, now that it's been patched, no one will know why the guy in power armor died at that spot!
---
I bought this entire set for 20k. Even with it I was getting killed with 1 punch with a deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
I‚Äôll buy it off you if it‚Äôs full bos 
---
Yeah, i've done it a few times. It's so long... Bought the fusion somewhere.
---
I'll even admit it's an apples to oranges argument but I'm sure they didnt hire some new team to deal with this stuff. No ones job is on the line.
---
So there are two things that matter: Percent time elapsed and percent goals complete. Why not show them both? 
---
MILFslayer420 was my old account. Banned for repeated harassment reports.
---
She went down tonight several times. Was my first time ever fighting her with a bloody build. It definitely made a difference. Maybe you should rethink your build. 
---
So you are suggesting we create extra unnecessary trouble for someone just because "it's there job to do so"? As the OP has said, you don't throw litter onto the floor because it's the cleaners' job to pick up trash, I don't see how you should report players unnecessarily just because it is the costumer service's job to sought through the reports to verify them.
---
Not a single time today for the first time. Had a couple studders but she pulled through. 
---
News flash!  The perks don't stack additively. 
---
They still offer obscene damage reduction, but bloodied melee also offers obscene damage.  Also, anyone wielding a DCG is also going to have Talons. Guess what Sentinel Assassin armor doesn't defend against?  That's right. Bleed damage. 
---
Arent we all 
---
I'm only assuming it does. I always have scrapper on when I'm farming or just screwing around. It doesnt take me long to be rolling in screws. Enough that I've gone and found low level players and dropped 80 at their feet because i remember how hard it was for me to find screws before. 
---
Perk card says more components from scrapping weapons, which is how i farm. I get bored looking for fans and clipboards for hours on end.
---
I love when people kill me with one shot with a power fist or deathclaw gauntlet from slap damage when not in PvP.
---
7 tries tonight and the secret door, where the TNT card is located, is always open. If you use cards and enter the code, it is always empty. I dunno.... 
---
 Is it bugged now?? 
---
[sorry it‚Äôs not help but] I‚Äôm in the same boat I‚Äôm level 131 and have done it almost 5 times now and after I scan the two key cards the secret door doesn‚Äôt open... real lame (even hopped servers). I had a decent sum of caps and now I‚Äôm down to 700

Addicted Gary!

A friend of mine reported someone just a few days ago for sending him harassing messages and voice recordings threatening to get 100 people to report him for cheating. The dude was just absolutely FLAMING that he got melted by a tesla. My buddy had emergency protocols on, too, which is just an instaban flag to the uneducated. I might just be stoned, but I'm pretty sure that dude got banned. My friend, while still HIGHLY offended by said transgressions, has shit himself laughing multiple times about it. I guess one can say, "Cry wolf and be... something... something about irony. Or whatever." 
---
I just want stable servers AND co-op only gameplay.  Pretty tired of GTA-tier griefers in Fallout...
---
I still can't use my t60 :P
---
But soon I will. It's still a good source for fusion cores and a central location in the forest. Helps for quickly traveling around the map. 
---
Why are you still clinging to bad game?  Reddit said bad game
---
You're :/
---
Did you ever find out? Thanks!
---
Dc‚Äôed out of a silo at 75% launch prep yesterday.
---
What about the one on fusion generator? It was my main source in FO4.
---
What do you think is better, unyielding or bolstering. Both depend on less life.
---
After looting the Sugar Grove, National Isolated Radio Array, and the National Radio Astronomy Research Center... I walked away with a staggering 32 screws and 45 springs. Thank you to everybody who helped give me suggestions :)
---
Haha princess Gary, I love it
---
Unyeilding for better damage and carry weight bolstering is just nice if you cant find any unyeilding 
---
Text please.
---
Who would've thought an online game that allows mods would have technical difficulties after every patch for every mod user out there?
---
But it's not just mods.  I was on PS4 and fell through the pond outside of Charleston Station.
---
I think we had the same idea, with the same scorched. So photogenic.
---
[https://imgur.com/xHza7co](https://imgur.com/xHza7co)
---
I quite enjoy the game.  :)
---
If PC, you trying to sell/trade it off?
---
I'm sure it's been asked already, I dont wanna scroll all night. What console are you playing on, new guy? Also congratulations on making a smart choice and giving a game a chance without caring what the world has said. We the 76 COMMUNITY welcome you. 
---
I don't want to sell it because it was expensive and difficult to acquire. I'm replacing it though with more effective pieces.
---
I‚Äôll give you 20k lol
---
"If you dont want your stuff stolen put a lock on it ü§ó" I will now think of you every time I see this on the loading screen.
---
Also I was playing and I found a bitchin place that was pretty big. We wanted to check out the inside but it was locked. Maybe it was you lol
---
This guy mutates
---
Have you thought about using powered doors? Can‚Äôt pick those
---
Ultracite, probably cause blue is my fav color
---
Keep at it, definitely go back and spice up the writing in some parts.  Don't let criticism deter you either, if you've got a story to tell then tell it.
---
This is my favorite one yet.
---
Had to fast travel 4 times to the event marker for uranium fever to register that i was in the event and for the map to update, thank god i made it before the time ran out lol
---
This would be a common sense quality of life improvement
---
I am xbox 1 
---
The perks are supposed to stack. Otherwise there would be no point having sets of things and would be better to have all different perks. Bleed damage is supposed to take time, dieing immediately from one shot isn't bleed damage. Funny how quickly Bethesda needed the TSE guns but doesn't seem to want to nerf unarmed. 
---
it does teleport you out of the fight
---
There is no "unnecessary trouble", the entire point of a job reviewing support tickets is to **review support tickets**. Some will be nonsense (and frequent false-reporters will eventually get flagged) and some will be valid. It's a paid job to sort through them. OP should suggest that people who eat out at a restaurant also offer to wash their own dishes.
---
Throwing litter on the ground is against the law. It's already against Zenimax code of conduct to abuse the report system ("Improper use of the in game support or complaint buttons or making false reports to ZeniMax staff members is forbidden. You may not intentionally submit misinformation or abuse the help system in any ZeniMax Service.").
---
How do you feel about cavalier?

Wait.. what, there is a 50 light budget now.....

unfortunately, drinking nukashine during that fight would just cause you to blackout when the drink wears off
---
I‚Äôm curious to see what experiment had taken place here, considering how interesting Appalachia‚Äôs vaults are
---
So true, especially given the favt that the atom store mark is the only thing to tell two frames apart.
---
However, behold of storing TWO atom store-painted frames in stash: couple of times this cost me a non-deployable armor that you could not do anything with. 
---
that would be one hell of an introduction to the game üòÇ
---
Just because someone used to stab people, but quit doing it, doesn't mean the rest of us should have to feel guilty about enjoying our time in a virtual, violent, post apocalyptic world containing knives. I'm more offended by the fact that you can't poop in this game, yet there are toilets and tp everywhere. Lets tackle the real issues here, folks! I've been stacking meal after meal in there, and the brahmin milk isn't agreeing with me. 
---
The devs added a new reporting feature. Maybe it's what they talked about?
---
I don't know why they attack other with junk on them. I drop mine in stash at every train station, red rocket and anywhere there's a stash box.
---
I actually thought that‚Äôs what blood cleanser did. Boy was I wrong. I thought it cleaned rads from your blood stream 
---
Anti armor gauntlet ?
---
I never said they don't stack. I said they don't stack additively. There's a difference. They stack multiplicatively. 
---
Nope, I didn't. I only ever used the discord group myself.
---
Nuka Cola plant has about 8 scattered throughout it
---
Keeping true to your analogy, what OP suggested is more of "don't think it's make a mess just because there are retaurant workers to clean up after you".
---
Also, since it's against the code of conduct, shouldn't it already be understood that no one should abuse the system? Why are you still arguing that it is okay because it's the customer service's job? 
---
Keeping the legality of things aside, just because their job is to review the ticket doesn't mean you should submit unnecessary reports. Just like how you don't throw the trash on the floor because it's cleaners' jobs to pick them up, or make a mess at the restaurants' tables because it is the waiters' job to clean it up.
---
I don't really keep track of where I find my canned dog food, but something that helps me build up allot is to have the green thumb and at least 3 melons at your camp. As long as your not a carnivore you'll always fill up your food and water and it makes it easy to fill up and keep the canned dog food for long emergencies when I can't fast travel back. Also herbivore will help greatly with this method 
---
Those guys with bloodied unarmed builds have it down pat. You can spring in VATS. Just spring towards the target until it goes from 0% to 95%, then swing.
---
Like the outrageous melee damage, this too is broken, especially since you get a lunging attack by using VATS. 
---
Chewy.com has some good prices
---
Are you getting staggered when they hit you and/or could they be using crits. Both scenarios ignore the sentinel effect of your armor
---
Not a 6 foot thick lead wall, nothing goes through that shit. 
---
Let me guess, you owned a workshop?  
---
Its just fine playing on your own, that's what i do you basically just explore and do quests with no human NPC's
---
Can you remind me where I said that I believe people should submit false reports?
---
Ultracite is really clean with the blues and reds.  But mods are hard to come by,  so I've recently switched to x01.
---
In terms of defense, x01 has the better energy resist.  Ultracite has superior ballistic defense.
---
I owned several for the challenge, but I wasn't near them. Did they change something with the workshops?
---
They needed the TSE guns for being overpowered. Now they need to focus on this.
---
Jeebus! I noticed that event doesn't pop up at Blackwater Mine!
---
Not staggered. Just dead. Lol
---
I‚Äôm a 100+ hours in now, and have only once encountered a person wanting to PvP me. Every other player either ignores me, or more often the case, will help me if they‚Äôre a higher level.
---
Lead bottles then?
---
Doesn't matter. If someone tries to take a shop from you, you (and everyone on your team) are immediately flagged as hostile to them and the rest of their team. 
---
This allows someone to stay at your shop, hidden, while his teammates track you down. Once you're in range, they'll make a claim on your shop, turning you hostile. Once this happens, their teammates can gun you down for full damage. 
---
Workshops have always stated that taking them opens you up to PvP.  
---
I was WAAAAYYYY within, my weights at 185. I think I had pressed take all on a bag with a bunch of rare stuff awhile back but had put it all back so when I came back, my inventory was the same. 
---
Hmmm, how would that work?  Inquiring minds want to know. :)
---
You man the quantum paint?
---
As someone with 14 suits of Power Armor, I agree
---
Let's be 100% clear. In this exchange, you are the asshole.
---
I know, but I thought that was for defending them and such. That sucks, and is kind of scummy.
---
Guess I'll just never take workshops again.
---
They autoflag you for pvp.  Even if you're in pacifist mode. 
---
Its been a fine single player experience for me. No issues with players that I didn't start. Stick to yourself and wave at others and all will be well.
---
Sometimes I message them first &amp; there still not interested. Normally takes me 3 goes before I can get a low level to take stuff.
---
Too many petty posts on this sub, i'd appreciate collecting this stuff and deleting reposts with extreme prejudice. Especially the perk stuff, pacifism, and fridges it's so boring:
---
We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
Anyone feel like FO/76 would have been considerably better as co-op only and not PVP?
---
Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
Passive mode should make it to where other players can‚Äôt kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable
---
Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
[Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
I‚Äôm quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
Please let screws be one of the materials gained from scrapping weapons, like in FO4.
---
Free Fast Travel between stations?
---
All Bulked Items Should ‚ÄúWeigh‚Äù Less than the Sum of Their Components. 
---
Travel Agent perk-lvl2 move your camp for free or at a reduced price. Lvl3 fast travel while over encumbered(free or pay caps)
---
Instead of expanding the storage limit, how about craftable Stash boxes with weight reducing properties? 
---
Give. Me. A. Fridge. 
---
For the love of god make VATS stop targeting friendlies if i'm in passive mode. 
---
The studio's enthusiasm needs to match the player community or we won't have the stamina to last until changes are made
---
Bethesda please give us the ability to either sell or scrap ammunition 
---
My one wish from Bethesda is more stash space
---
Now that all the duped items are gone, can we get an increase on vendor cap limits?
---
Let technical data stack, and give us a bigger reward for more data.
---
Let us keep learned plans across our different characters
---
New stashbox to trade between your other characters 
---
You have to get the plan called powered gates. If you have it unlocked already then they‚Äôre all the way at the bottom of the list of walls in the build menu
---
Move the "(Known)" plans to the bottom of the tab so that we dont have scroll through every known plan we have just to get to the ones we don't know. It would make checking vendors and other players for things we don't know, way eay easier.
---
Mine either :

Made mine on the toxic river. See my other comment in this thread for picture if you want.

Chances are, probably not. :)  That being said, my place isn't big.  2 floors, but just enough room to fit everything I want in it.

Will you trim my rune pl8 to has gold trim??  No wait.  Zaros trim!

Oh, wait.  Wow, woah.  Just had a flashback.  Damn it Runescape, GET OUT OF MY HEAD!
---
I personally use the keypad version with a pressure plate on the inside that opens the door automatically when I step on it. It‚Äôs a little tricky to get wired up correctly but once you do it‚Äôs great 
---
Then please explain why you attacked the OP for being concerned about Bethesda staffs sorting through false claims and telling people not to do it?
---
Sorry if I misunderstood you, I'm not a native English speaker so I may not have catched on.
---
Do tell, I'm interested in how you did this.
---
For the most part you can remain free of grief from other players, although engaging in certain activities makes it more likely you'll have to deal with pvp. As long as you dont engage other players (turn on pacifist mode) and avoid taking workshops other players will only do "slap" damage which is next to nothing. Worst case, you can go to a different server.
---
I've been solo 95% of the time, only grouped up with a couple people who gave good vibes and even then didnt really do anything of consequence I couldn't have done alone.
---
It was when i fast traveled to join the event the first time which suprised me, i had to fast travel to the new marker a 3 times lol The bugs on this game definitely keep things interesting. Favorite so far is the loot window. Enemies despawning a couple seconds after they die and having to rush to loot or your SOL lmao
---
I may be able to help you. I am building on a cliff and I got that error multiple times. First, it appeared to be random, but latter I found out that it only happened if I put my C.A.M.P. Inside of my building, 
---
As long as C.A.M.P was outside and on the floor, I did not get the relocation message. I do not know if this applies to all camps, but it works if your are building near or on a cliff.
---
Lol maybe they think you drop mines in a bag. 
---
it seems you have to trigger it manually by talking to him again, it's the only way it has worked for me, done 2 dailys so far since the original quest
---
Underrated comment is something we have here, Sir! 
---
Too bad everyones server hopping to grab them all so people have to buy them from them, even encountered a guy outside of the bunker who tried to sell me one and had like 30 something in his inventory
---
It is boring.
---
It's like a miner stumbling upon a vein of fools gold, with nuggets of actual gold hidden all up deep inside that vein.
---
You gotta dig through the worthless crap to get to the good stuff.
---
I did it 5 times - no keys. 
---
Lvl 75 isn't too bad but the lvl 40ish chars would have ramped her DR up to make her not just a bullet sponge but a bullet black hole.... 
---
Honestly I just drop it all in suitcases and various containers around where low levels have to be for quests and usually when I go back someone has taken it all. A lot of low levels seem to think everyone over level 80 is out to murder them for funzies so they just run away when they see you on the map ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
It IS a waste of recources. I see no point in doing it for a 1* nocturnal woodleg and some plan
---
I'll trim just come to wildy I'll show you a spot where you cant get attacked 
---
I see the plans but never thought about it.  I'll have to buy them and start figuring it out.  Thanks!
---
Killing high level people or selling lots of marine tactical helmets usually works well for me.
---
Are blocker and dodgy equipped? (Sorry just trying to help a fellow PvPer survive in the wastes)
---
When I was your level I would barely win fights with her. I thought the same thing. But now I‚Äôm a level 136 with better weapons and the right perk cards equipped for the style I play and I can take her down more frequently. Haven‚Äôt failed one in a while. Only when none shows up. 
---
You can still take workshops man remember there like no penalty for dying. You can always get more junk. 
---
Im lvl 279 completely solo, imo its nice as solo
---
&gt;gold bar
---
Guh, just had a Red Dead moment...  You totally mean gold scrap huh.
---
Level 40 and never played with someone in party. Very good experience so far. 
---
Report them for what? Were they being racist or abusive? 
---
I use bloodied powerfist but i die quickly against any one with the deathclaw gauntlet i domt really bother with pvp but ive had less rhan 200 caps recently so i just mess with people who purposely get bounties 
---
Check the bunker first. If its already open you cant get the key. Its limited to (1) code (1) per server 
---
OR ELSE HE'LL KEEP REPOSTING THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY ON REDDIT! WE'RE THE HOSTAGES SOMEONE SEND HELP!
---
If she is I demand a face to face confrontation so I can explain to her my actions.
---
*ROOOSE*, I had to, Overseer.  I.  *HAAAAD TOOOO*, SHE'S *SOOO...  AGGRAVATING!!!*
---
This isn't happening. Stop spreading lies. No one is one-shotting anyone through slap damage unless you have 5 hp or less. 
---
If you're getting one-shot, you've engaged in PvP through some other mechanic. The most likely cases are a teammate got you flagged as hostile or someone tried to claim your workshop (or that of a teammate). 
---
It‚Äôs great. Played basically solo (occasional teamups for defend events) until level 40ish and now I mostly play on a team (or a few teams, depending on who‚Äôs on) and it opens up so much more gameplay. And stuff I never knew about the game. It‚Äôs a blast, but I‚Äôm also super glad I played solo for the first chunk of the game since it‚Äôs hard to absorb the lore (holotapes etc) when other players are in your ear. Enjoy :)
---
You can actually just store the walls in the way, run the wire, and then install the walls afterwards. It looks a little stupid, but it works.
---
"Fishersite" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
(Promise I'm laughing WITH you, not at you)
---
If only we could get a temporary agility boost from using them.
---
To each his own I guess. I just build a minimal camp. Easy to move and easy to repair. I came in to this game with the mentality that "if you build it, they will come." 
---
Keep it simple and it won't matter. If building camps is what you like, then fallout 4 is what you need. Just my opinion of course. 
---
One of the things that woefully absent from this game that was present in the early turn based games is the openness about calculations and basic mechanics of combat. As a result, many don't understand that slap damage is limited to 5 hp. They don't understand that taking a workshop opens you up to PvP while in pacifist mode, even though it specifically warns you of this (though it's easily mistaken to think it means only inside the workshop). 
---
Thanks, this tallies in with the build I've made on nukes and dragons so I think I'll give it a shot
---
The secret door opens and the code even works but the TNT key is Never there. 7 times..., ugh 
---
Idiots will be idiots.
---
Ignoring the fact that the game devs obviously aren't the ones reviewing the support tickets as the title suggests, it's just ridiculous to suggest that Bethesda will regret implementing a report function because players might abuse it. People will always report other players for stupid shit. That's why safeguards are already built in to the system (people are paid to review tickets, submitting a false report is against terms of service, troublesome reporters will get flagged, etc.). Honestly it's a bit insulting to the company to imply that they aren't already fully aware of and able to handle this basic aspect of the report function. The post itself is also patronizing.
---
Another petty complaint:
---
 [Dear Bethesda, let me edit my power armor names (or make them reflect what power armor is on the chassis)](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1nggl/dear_bethesda_let_me_edit_my_power_armor_names_or/) 
---

---
It is an immersive loneliness.  I would have to stop playing an talk to my wife at points while leveling just to take the edge off.  As you are listening to holo tapes and reading notes you realise all of these people are dead or turned and you wonder how you will overcome the wastes.  I felt Bethesda did a great job making it enjoyable and immersive as a single player.  Now that I am a higher level I enjoy both the solitude when I have it and playing with my friends that I have met when i get the chance.  
---
It‚Äôs lonely. But I think it‚Äôs lonely in the best way possible. It really feels like a post apocalyptic world.
---
Oh, by the way, most players you meet will be nice to you. There‚Äôs only a very small group of people that will want to grief you.
---
Thanks for the idea. I have a similar rifle build on one character but was keen to see if there was a pistol version that actually is viable
---
We know. This is the zillionth thread about this. 
---
I finally got the plan!  I can confirm that it is a scorched earth reward for successful completion the first time at level 25 or above, and it does not need to be looted.
---
Whitesprings man. Some of those ghouls used to be the PLUG plug judging by all the product they're packing. 
---
Twice today she went down with levels ranging from 40 and up. Several were bloody builds that do alot of damage. Just depends on who you play with and who joins. I've lost many of battles with her but it's possible with the right people. You need mele, explosive, and rifle builds to all work together. 
---
Make sure you've removed all mods, other than that I have no idea, was having a similar issue but repairing worked for me.
---
Yeah I want it too, it's cool.
---
&gt; am ready for something different.....
---
Get a team. Git gud.

Dont do it

Have u installed any mods? Delete ini files inside Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\

There's an acid/??? Can't remember double node west of Waroga in the savage divide. One is at the top of the cliff, the other is at the bottom in a cave. Pretty nifty setup of you're after acid. Also the golf workshop up north in Toxic Valley has 3 acid nodes, and you get attacked by anglers and radscorps and other fun stuff.
---
Actually it's happened several times when I'm at full health. Always someone with a powerfist or death law gauntlet.
---
üôåüèø
---
That's another problem with PvP. The caps exchange. 
---
I have been solo to my current level (47). It is alot of fun but it can be lonely. That being said, post apocalyptic would be pretty lonely.....
---
That's how I play mostly.  Move my camp as u get invested in different regions.  Right now my garage is right on the line where Mir ed goes to Bog on the map.  Open to any travellers!
---
Do know they share caps per faction, so all Whitesprings vendors share the same 200 caps, as do responder bots and raider bots.  Watoga is its own faction.  Harpers ferry is too as is the BoS vendor in Watoga shopping plaza.
---
Higher levels scare them. Maybe they have been hoarding stash and just don't want to loose those 10 screws. I'm sure we all know the pains.  They will figure it out without your help. Just play your game and drop at certain stations. Someone will pick it up. 
---
Thanks for the feedback everyone. It kind of sucks because I have a very limited window to play, when I actually get to play. Eventually I guess I'll get these recipes.
---
Here‚Äôs an idea: let‚Äôs everyone post about this exact same topic multiple times a day to the point that everyone‚Äôs annoyed, when Bethesda‚Äôs already got stuff in the works addressing the ‚Äúissue.‚Äù Consistent complaining really does make all the difference. 
---
True but when it comes to dicks who get bounties to bait then idc they're base also is free game ive gotten 3 people so far today a pretty impressive house as well but the guy is notorious for gettign high bounties and having people kill him no one likes him
---
Yes, I use the anti armor perk but it does not apply to emergy rifles at all. Hence, I am asking that Bethesda add it or energy pen to the rifle through component upgrade or perk card.
---
Hell yeah, I love the look of that playlist too. I'm going to have a little variety for a change. I appreciate the links. 
---
Yup I noticed that after I posted this. Not sure it's a useful buff though can you I.agine using it then being transported away just before a boss dies?

Ash Heap vendors apparently: Camden Park, Lewisberg and Welch.

Solves the problem of fighting randoms. Solves griefing. Uses forums for their logical purpose. Creates an end game. Make friends to protect yourself with.

Someone raiding you? Say "you're a wimp for picking on me and not joining joloda's faction war!" Except joloda is hiding in a bush somewhere waiting for Bethesda to turn this into Overwatch, next year, maybe, splitting the whole player base, and no one is footing the programming bill.
---
Why is reddit so soft and weak. No other developer would delete PVP it's so backwards you're like the Amish of video gaming.
---
I lost 180ish caps per death, that's a pretty big penalty for me. I'm too short on caps for that.
---
Maybe they decreased energy weapons‚Äô deterioration while increased ballistic heavy weapons‚Äô deterioration speed in order to balance it? Never will we know what they did to fine tune the setups. 
---
Maybe you dropped it without knowing? Many people just drop their weapon while consuming radaways. 
---
Yes plz I'm on Xbox I'll message u when I'm on üëç

 **Challenge Tracking** I seem to be having issue with location tracking for example Cranberry Bog area has two ticks, one against Watago and cant remeber the other one but three (Robo Reseatch, Cranberry Glade and another I cant remeber!) but I have discovered all of them?

Wow that's shit

No! I purchased atoms to get mine thinking this was exclusive reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
I see where you're coming from, but from what I see, the OP only wants people to avoid sending unnecessary reports, that's all. The "regret" part is just a use of words. But yeah, I get what you're saying, thank you for the insightful discussion :)
---
Fuck, I thought they at least fixed this game a little.

No, it hasn't, you just don't understand how they got you flagged as hostile, thereby eliminating slap damage reduction.  If you own a shop, or a teammate owns a shop, or if a teammate isn't playing with pacifist, you can easily get flagged as hostile.
---
Just because you don't know how it happened doesn't mean someone is cheating or using an exploit. 
---
Hope for the best mate 
---
I get armor crafting plans once every 10th time or so. It seems to mostly give the MA plans for t60, t51 and t45 though. Anything in particular you are looking for? 
---
It has something to do with adrenal reaction mutation changes
---
Since only the latest patch? 
---
Also shotgun‚Äôs behavior is changed. Normally when I aim down the sight, fire a shot, the gun will stay in that position for subsequent shots. After the latest patch after the first shot, the shotgun will go into hipfire position automatically, this is very annoying since I have to press aim again and again for each shots. What in the world are they thinking when they mess with settings that should not to be changed. 
---
Aye
---
Casual players cannot kill her. Not with the most recent changes to her. You now need about 2-3players who are spec'd and decked out specifically to deal with her, The casual player using the 130 damage hunting rifle isnt going to do shit to her.
---
Wow that‚Äôs a lot of loss. I will check to see if my shotgun shells loaded into the tube will go missing too when I log out and back in. 
---
You can't kill someone from slap damage unless they have next to no hp. Stop spreading lies, and reposting the same trash.
---
Didn't own a workshop and wasn't on a team, wasn't wanted and didn't agree to PvP.
---
I mean, how in the fuck that's two seperate menus.
---
And nah, I just had it about five minutes before it disappeared.
---
Like, I had it in my weapon wheel, I go to swap weapons after, slot is empty, it's gone.
---
I'm mostly mad because I got it off scorchbitch, it had sentimental value, even though it's only marginally better than my backup.
---
my buddy and i are always looking for low levels to give our unneeded plans to and they usually run away from us and crouch somewhere lmaooo
---
I love when I'm doing PvP and I lose over a 100 caps when I die but only gey 5 caps when I kill them. Lol
---
Thanks for telling me about it. Gotta try it out now.
---
It almost makes too much sense.
---
Psycho is a hellaov a drug
---
What I'm talking about is, pressing R while you are on stats menu on a pipboi lets you consume radaway. Some people use radaways that way. The scenario is, in a middle of an intense battle, you open up your pipboi and spam R without knowing that your pipboi is displaying weapons tab on items menu. 
---
Given player base has dropped for this game getting multiples of this power armour will be easy
---
Lock Jointed Mr Handy! Useful!
---
Hey thanks for the info! 
---
Thanks that‚Äôs awesome to know. Yes it‚Äôs level 50 i believe. I added a suppressor to it today to make it look more badass lol 
---
They stack multiplicatively, no additively, so it's not 75% reduction, it's more like 45%.
---
Like borderlands 
---
You can end up just deleting your selected items. I mean it's Bethesda. absolutely possible
---
The lever action isn't the best non-auto rifle for either dp-sec or dp-shot, although it's a good balance between the two. The gauss rifle and hunting rifle both exceed it per shot, in the latter case due to the perforating magazine. The handmade rifle has far better dp-sec, especially if you take account of reload time.
---
I could get the numbers tomorrow if you really care, although I don't think it's close.
---
They exist, and will attack your workshops
---
Got my defense to glitch for a second 
---
Yea could be it, completely RNG just like the legendary drops themselves, and in most cases a three-star turns out to be one. 
---
Ah fair enough, I'm on PS4 myself so slightly different button press, but I could see how that'd happen.
---
No that's not me, I was just farmin whitesprings when it happened because it's where I was when I logged off so just doing a round before starting the new questline.
---
And wham bam, my favorite gun is gone.
---
idk why people have been saying this, if anything my damage has went up. i used to do 1500-ish with my dcg, and now i can get it up to 2200 using the same tactics as pre-patch. 
---
Agreed, she gets tougher and tougher as more "min/max players leave and these casuals that play for exploring and just enjoying the game. Dont get me wrong ,  ppl can play how they want thats fine by me.
---
But the cold facts like u wrote ppl with a 130dmg rifle or a 50dmg  auto weapon will NOT be able to take her down anytime soon
---
It is there! And a Nuka-grape I couldn't pick up is also in my inventory.
---
Take your good ideas somewhere else (unless you make them a mod them so we can steal them later and give you no credit).
---
Might be real. All the cores I found on frames today were 25%. Found a 78% on a bench though. Before this patch 50%+ was standard on frames.

I seen some level 5 guy wearing a hazmat suit join the fight and all he did was tag every single mob spawns. Absolutely shameless.
---
I don't mind the exploding, I just hate when the body launches itself somewhere here and the horizon. 
---
I honestly do most of my playing single player. My brother and I team up sometimes, but most of the time we're doing our own thing. 
---
Then I doubt you actually had pacifist mode on, as it's impossible to one shot someone through slap, at this point. I screw around with friends a -lot-. Ive tried everything. It's not a thing. The damage a pacifist takes, is capped. 
---
Im an unyielding, bloodied build who uses a gauntlet, btw. Now... when they don't have pacifist mode on? Yeah, they can drop in one hit.
---
Must you get the keycards and the code on the exact server you are on or just jump to get an unused server
---
I don't bother locking my doors because if they want to break in they're going to, and why lock the decent people out?  Even if you don't have doors at all, they can just shoot down a wall or whatever. 
---
I went to the TNT done after the keys stopped generating for me...
---
Door was open, plan was just lying on the table! Result!
---
I dunno, I love fancy camps, and I've only been attacked a couple times. Just hop servers if you don't want your stuff damaged. It sucks, but soon CAMPS will be safer, or so they say. 
---
This would be cool. I thought it would be great if we could raise chickens. I only run across them once in a while, and all I get is a lousy chicken thigh.
---
Oh so you have been to my camp then? Don‚Äôt worry the eyes are just Mr. Cuddles my glowing Deathclaw....
---
Unnecessarily causing a player disproportionate loss or resetting their progress **is a form of Griefing**.
---
this game needs more hubs tbh.
---
whitesprings is one but faction orientated hubs would be awesome
---
I did all the steps up to the card swiping... Ended up giving up trying to find a room that hadn't been unlocked... upon my 10 trip to Dome 7 I found the plans just lying there... so still have all the cards, just no key yet...
---
I normally see a lot of dog food around Watoga. 
---
I noticed the marketing access code stayed in my inventory, thanks for letting us know we can skip that step a second time.
---
I WANT that lamp.
---
which is awesome, i'm glad people are doing what you're doing, it's just nutty that they thought this mechanic was a good plan. "hey, lets tie atoms to shit most people can't get!" 
---
Lol yeah as a matter of fact it does extend the phantlm device stealth mode. 
---
I lost a 2 shot fatman, a few armor pieces and several bulked items in the last 3 patches.
---
*casually sitting at the scorched drop zone with a minigun*
---
You don‚Äôt say...
---
This is hilarious honestly and satisfying 
---
Yea they buffed her cause when you had 1 or 2 fully decked out characters we could legit kill her in less than a minute/30 seconds. They then nerfed the weapons and buffed her as well so now its a bit harder for us, but in turn also made it IMPOSSIBLE for the casual player. I mean no offense to them, its just statistically impossible now, and if you arent gear for it I wouldnt even go waste your ammo.
---
Wait the fuck?? Why would you want that....?
---
I mean at least the tick blood mixer plus plague walker is a fun combo.
---
Organized fights aren't going to solve griefing. Most current PvPers clearly prefer the one-sided murdering, otherwise they'd go play a proper PvP game instead.
---
I want this so bad, especially for rare outfits.
---
no daedra in-game...yet.

the conduit is actually only leaving to the north, but i could easily apply the same conduits to the south and could leave the building there also.
---
Could you please correlate your understanding of griefing to the points previously made, so as to present a logical counter-argument to the conversation (Griefing vs Not-Griefing) and provide a basis for why your position on this should be respected?

People downvoting you probably don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre commenting the top comment on Imgur

The only problem I have found with pvp is that there is not enough of it. The people who want to hunt bounties can't find them and the people who have them can't find people who claim them. While farming I'll server hop, the first thing I do is scan the map for bounties, its hit and miss. When tired of that I'll server hop till I find someone built at Charleston station and blocking the special event vendor, blow up their place as a community service and get a large bounty. Even then it seems like its 1/5 servers to find some one who even attempts to claim it. Work shops are hit and miss if I take one they usually leave uncontested. If I hold one I'll get some guy who will try to to bait me into trading and attempt to sucker attack, after they die they usually just leave the server. I have a feeling the pvp servers will fix this to some degree.  As for the gear issue I don't think there is one, open world pvp games are gear and skill based. Play the game you bought, alot of people enjoy the challenges of finding and gearing up piece by piece. If you want 100% equal footing with everyone geared the same I sujest a first person shooter, there are plenty of those games out there. I did read your post though and I think the game might be more balanced than you think. I recomend looking closer to pvp counters ect. I have found no build that does not have a counter or gear for that matter. Some gear is better some builds too, have yet to find a pvp meta.
---
One of the many threads on this subject has got to get some attention at some point.
---
Which I don't get. It's usually not profitable to kill the low level guys anyways. 
---
I usually drop my stuff in an overseer's cache. Occasionally a mailbox or trash can or something  near a train station. One day I dumped off 1k of cloth that had been cluttering up my stash, along with a bunch of glass and the like.  There were two low levels there.  I never saw it go in the box lol. They'd take it as soon as I put it in.  
---
Psycho is for babys, Psychotats is where its at.

Once I have the TNT 7 keys do I just keep respawning or do i have to keep re-doing the quest?
---
Can wait to raid and pillage your C.A.M.P with my fellow Raiders üòéüòú‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ
---
With every "patch/update" they break more things than fix. So nope, not yet. still patiently waiting...
---
That's not an excuse to not even try. Just as long as we all agree there is an alternative but you all prefer to be boring. 
---
Living within cages of tight rules is the only way you can imagine gaming.
---
This reflection of how boring and toxic humanity can be even when endowed with miraculous levels of technology is precisely the theme of 76. Reddit could be the hub to Valhalla but instead...this is what we get. Blame Bethesda.
---
My man Meeseeks looking out!

Enjoy your oblivion Mr. Meeseeks!

You actually lose all your photos that you've taken.

Seriously, you had to open yet another 'is it worth it - reinstall edition' thread? 
---
I started playing the other day too. Im level 9 and the people on Xbox are pretty cool, I traded a black  pistol for some gears etc I'm still having trouble finding Miguels Robot and the fire man responder mission disappeared on me;( games pretty fun tho I like it alot 
---
So that new "dlc" is trash too?
---
It'd be griefing if it weren't legit fun for the other person, I bet that's one drink they'll never forget.
---
Well i don't follow anything about this game so. Yeah.
---
yeah its awful and really makes me just want to play something else. sometimes i can go a full hour without it happening  and other times it happens every 5 mins. if you manage to find a fix please let me no and ill do the same :)
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but even with pacifist mode off so long as you do not engage another player you still only take slap damage right? 
---
I like the new content but they broke a lot of things in the process.  Like nuke lauch times per player &amp; per silo, not being to inspect vendors items, team members not showing on HUD, more than normal glitchy spawns, etc. Just to name a few. 
---
Are you waiting 3 seconds between activating the 2 key readers?
---
The first time I did it, I thought I had to activate both of them within 3 seconds, so I did one after the other and the door didn't open.
---
Then I got another pair, and swiped the first, waited 3 seconds, then swiped the second, and the room opened.
---
Bless the fellow OCD bros 
---
thanks for putting me down a rabbit hole of that legal advice subreddit haha! 
---
Same, let me huff my toxic powder and gag on toxic water in peace.  My 10 missile turrets are for people, cause normal monsters know better than to bother the stash box and all crafting benches sitting at my stairs.
---
Except for that one super mutant to the east who snipes my metal wall.  That guys a dick.
---
On a side note, if you ever come across a camp with a stashbox that says 'help yourself' with crafting benches behind it and water purifiers and a garden in front of it, well, help yourself to food and water, cause there's a llotta toxic inhospitable irradiated fuming stuff out there and Mothyman and dem Gnome Gods know its hard to last out there.
---
If you use the xbox app, you can save screenshots and video to your phone with little to no quality loss. Tara how i keep all my xbox screens hd
---
I use a TSE handmade with stealth commando and vats
---
Damn Bethesda just cant catch a break with this shit. Every time i hear about it, its something negative. Oh well  thanks
---
Correct, however in crowded environments (like the golf club or FSP after the event ends) it's very easy to accidentally slap other players, meaning they need only slap you back and then it's on. 
---
I am not sure It must depend on the team. I only once had the queen not die. Sometimes in the TSE era she was down in 5 minutes. After sometimes in 15.
---
But also in the last five happened quite often. Maybe it helps when some people have some support perks, or just good damage builds.
---
I swing for at least 600 melee with armor penetration of 75% (furious grognaks much str and all perks.).
---
Some bloodied builds will ez. Top that. I am not sure why the difference is so big sometimes though.
---
I've killed it with 6 or even with over 12 people.
---
You uninstalled for your own reasons, no matter what we say, only you can decide.

I say yes give it a go, it is a lot better than launch

This is awesome, really. I knew the traders belonged to different factions. But I didn't know where some of them were. It appears there's one more, the trader consoles in Whitespring Bunker are separate from the Whitespring station. So there's another 200 for ye.
---
They should. They needed guns twice already. 
---
Uninstalled cause there was more bugs than there is content. I guess ill try it again ü§∑

---
I had this problem since before the patch actually.  I'm not sure what reason there is to even bother with it. It doesn't award legendary gear, and gives plans for PA mods and pieces that are some of the easiest to obtain in the game already.   It has been doing that even before the patch for me.
---
For Pve or Pvp?
---
Accept Your Gift Dont Ask 
---
Pve
---
It just randomly transports you I'm not sure if lvl has anything to do with it 
---
Throw Pharma Framer on, in my experience you only need one rank for really good results. Then get way used to checking everything, drugs are on the loot table for all containers, including bathroom mirrors and those brown doctors bags in clinics.
---
I have way more then I ever need doing this.
---
If you‚Äôre on XB1 I‚Äôll give you 30 bufftats, got way too many lol. West Tek has lots of containers for chems ime
---
That‚Äôs a lot of time spend doing stuff when all you had to do was use search. 
---
Yes it is. That's  part of the questline where you drink the nukashine and blackout. The only thing is....wherever you wake up at is random. I did the quest and woke up in a river in the Mire and others have said they ended up in other areas as well.
---
I mean, the good news is with few locations it's a prime place for future events/locations. 
---
I'm also a fan of the area. So that'd be nice 
---
I have been having the same problems on xbox with the lag and crashes I had to give in and abandon my quest and just turn it off
---
I'm not sure if it's the patch or the return of the dupers with there excessive carry weights 
---
When attacking the queen only attack her in small groups (3-5), her health increases due to the amount of players around her. Don‚Äôt get too distracted when I comes to dealing with the scorched spawns. I‚Äôd try and find servers with players of lv +100. And most importantly work in teams, if you disconnect it‚Äôs game over. I wish you good luck when it comes to getting rare drops.
---
Best Damage Resistance and Energy Resistance is on the T-51. The X-01 has worse ER and Ultracite has worse DR. But they both have best Radiation Resistance. Which the T-51 has the worst of the 3.
---
T-60 has worse DR and ER than the 3 above (still better RR than T-51) but is cheap to fix. T-45 is a weaker T-60 in everything. However with Power Patcher lvl3 any Power Armor lasts pretty much forever, so that's a moot point IMO. 
---
That‚Äôs really cool, thanks!
---
There's a nice spot with a junk &amp; lead pile. Not too many 2 resource camp spots. 
---
Your welcome
---
Please show in vendor windows, a brief description of what power armor mods actually do. I have no idea what kinetic dynamo what's it means. 
---
And is it really that hard for plans to show an image of the item it creates rather than a piece of paper? 
---
Daily quests should never require you to drink 50 of a beverage, and then make that beverage a challenge to find or make. Some of us only get a little time to play. 20 is a challenge. 50 is ridiculous.
---
Can we please fix the plants in nuke zones that dont let you harvest them? I was working on flux tonight and at least 10 plants in whitesprings change color but arent pickable. 
---
****and my biggest PLEASE Bethesda.
---
Change the way legendaries drop. If I encounter a 3 star enemy I should be guaranteed a 3 star reward. They rarely spawn as it is but most drop one star items. Why? It makes no logical sense at all. Make the stars match the type of drops they give. And remove the damn drill from the legendary list. 
---
Also please make lockpick and hacking passive and attached to level ups. There are just not enough safes and locks and terminals to merit card swapping all the damn time. 
---
I keep helping, but I'm still here...
---
Seems your looking for an I win button. Thankfully, there is not one. All the armors have counters same for the builds, the gear only helps. There are 3 builds that will cut through that armor.
---
I went through the whole thing up to the key cards. Has to server hop 13 times to find one basement that wasnt already looted. 
---
Swiped both cards and NOTHINF HAPPENED. 
---
Started over again from the beginning on yet another server... swiped the first card, ran over to swipe the second, turned around and the keypad wall CLOSED. Apparently one card had opened it and the second shut it again. 
---
The cost of fast traveling all those places, twice, pisses me off so bad. To have this be something you have to continually sever hop for is kinda ridiculous. 
---
I noticed the same thing. 
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/137

LOL sometimes I seriously wonder if I should hold onto this random terrible stuff to see how many I‚Äôve picked up.  With my hours and level it‚Äôs got to be hundreds of wood legs and trapper right arms.

He's so drunk he didn't notice!
---
I think you are in the wrong forum?  Have you tried Match, or some other service?
---
Seems it depended of regions we played in, the dark zone I played was mostly toxic and I got fed up of being exposed to someone else's hatred. FO76 is rather a peaceful game in my eyes (also might depend on regions) , whenever I see someone wanted with a high amount of bounty, I block the player or just hop into another server. Mostly peaceful playing alone, though.
---
Sadly PS4
---
Ultracite mod Plans, prime reciever Plans and flux 
---
What builds cut through it? Got me curious and wondering so I'll know how to have a chance at an opponet wearing that armor 
---
Bless you my child. Maybe Bethesda can steal this mod and save us all some time.
---
I hear the dork-web is good for that kind of thing.
---
OKAY SAME.  Where is your camp?  Seneca? 
---
Doubt you‚Äôll see visible holstered weapons any time soon.that would open a Pandora‚Äôs box of clipping nightmares.
---
Near Watoga
---
I've fought her after every patch just because this refrain is common. I don't have issue with killing the queen. I think people are just trying to take her on with bad specs and under geared. 
---
And that's not to say you need god tier armor. Most of my armor is 1 star unyielding gear and I use a 1 star bloodied buzz blade. 
---
Yep. Got an rx580 with 32gb of ram. it's nothing to do with your pc. It's just the game sadly.
---
I‚Äôve got the BOS combat arms plan, was saving them for a trade sweetener but make me an offer on them if you want.
---
I've noticed that the protectrons at watoga sometimes spawn and die instantly since this last patch. 
---
Well shit, I'll definitely check that thanks for the tip.
---
Melee stagger cuts through, shot gun stagger builds, or any ranged crit vats build. Ranged crit beats Melee and stealth beats ranged crit builds.
---
What kind of build do you want to run as far as weapons?
---
The queen is only easy to kill, to those well prepared for the fight. The right character can solo her in just a few minutes. So perk build and equipment make a huge difference.
---
So weird.  Popped up for me yesterday and hasn‚Äôt gone away.  I‚Äôve just adopted mine haha! 
---
The faster fall drink "Lead champagne" has other benefits when it reaches vintage stage. Damage resistance at least.

when a normal person gets bored with a activity they find some other activity to do for fun
---
running around and destroying other peoples fun in the boring activity is not normal behavior
---
Yea but I dont want to use alot of time, the scenario I describe we kill her sub 2/3minutes.
---
The generated Code is for the while server, so if you generated a Code went to the cabin and someone changes it you dont have the New one 
---
I cook a lot of Corn Soup.  Easy to grow Corn, easy to get the Dirty Water and Wood to convert to Boiled Water.  
---
Corn Soup weighs the same as Canned Dog Food, but gives 12% to Food and 15% to Water.   
---
Also, it gives 12 HP, 1 HP per second, along with AP Regen +3 for 30 minutes.
---
I vendor all the food I find.
---
I‚Äôll take the 4 and 7 and pay you caps 
---
I had that too, a relog fixed it. 
---
These are not dailys its a repatable quest so it wont disapear when you log back in
---
The problem is the key code changes for each server you join. So collect the cards, get the code and open the door must be done on same server. If you are server hopping for multiple parts don‚Äôt get the code until you have both cards.
---
IIRC T-51 is the best armor but lacks rad resist
---
I think the requirements to increase an items level should be the materials required for crafting a new one at the desired level +50%, as you wouldn‚Äôt have to craft any upgrades for it, balances it out a bit.
---
I don't need or want an i win button. I had that with my TSE weapons that were nerfed. A let's be on the same playing field button would be nice. That won't happen until they need the unarmed like they did the guns.
---
My favorite petrified scorched to photograph is the one kneeling near the water at Nuke Base Alpha entrance. It‚Äôs morbidly beautiful. 
---
Large map and low population servers means you will never see anyone unless you want to. I've been attacked by players twice, they can't do enough damage to kill you and while it does break immersion that some doofy is flailing at you, both times I stood in front of them and spammed the ?? Emote until they just gave up and moved on. 
---
The only piece of advice is just ignore that public workshops (the turn on pvp for max damage) are in the game, even though I have never been griefed using them there are people who will hunt you across the map.
---
Regarding GTA I agree but guessing you never figured out how to make solo public lobbies üòâ
---
We've already been over this, it's the chlorine. You want to cook with chlorinated water? Weirdo.

It‚Äôs not you finding it, it‚Äôs when it finds you üò®

Same thing happened to me
---
Few swings of a super sledge and they are toast, easier than lockpicking and the bounty is still 5 caps.
---
I do think that might trigger turrets though. However turrets are less than useless against players.
---
Damn I'm on ü§î well good luck! 
---
*I‚Äôm going to do my best to make a point here* ‚Äî ** The nature of PvP can cause grief on the side of the loser**. What might be considered griefing in one area of a game may even be an intended function or mechanic in another area*, but this is not the point being addressed*.
---
In my personal *interpretation* of the conversation, is that **Griefing** is unanimously felt as: 
---
‚ÄúCausing a player disproportionate loss or resetting progress.‚Äù **in a manner that is not specifically sanctioned by the developer**.
---
So, **unless** Bethesda **says you SHOULD**, for a given scenario, **then** YOU **should NOT**. 
---
AKA ‚Äî Just **because** you‚Äôve discovered it‚Äôs possible to play as a cancerous douchebag, **does NOT** sufficiently **authorize you** to accurately portray one *in-game*.
---
What are coolant bottles? Do they give acid? I smelt but I just farm bears 
---
Go wanted for 5 or 10 caps prior. You'll only lose your bounty.
---
Rifles like the handmade
---
I like the bos armor its a good all around type armor. You can farm glassed caverns to get it
---
Worst thing is the neon letters count as 1 each :-(
---
Probably a bloodied bolstering build. Nothing could touch me really in Pve with that build, Rifleman/Sniper. 
---
For PvP I go Sentinel Assassin. 
---
Depends what you can get your hands on, what you find, what you can craft... And what you can buy, caps can be scarce in Pve, I farm caps in PvP. 
---
Shhhh! That's where i get my corn and razorgrain for bourbon and whiskey
---
Last I remember empath lowered your damage Resistance and bloodied builds are already low health... I am that build and had empath for a while. It fucking sucked. I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs using it
---
Melee only has one thing going for it,big burst dmg right off the bat at close range. They win if you attack them first or if you have a bounty and they get first attack. With any distance they are very beatable. In fact, my guess is there will be some very upset melee players when pvp servers open up. When it's a free for all open world, Stealth  builds and ranged crit will eat them up.
---
Yeah crashes very regular now after the last patch, I have played today for about 6hrs and it froze/crashed 5 times, people are saying it is down to the dupers again but it is very coincidental that we get a patch and suddenly we get more crashes/freezes, map markers (uranium event) being in the wrong place on the map, food spoiling quicker etc etc.
---
Also a distinct lack of scorched earth events, I may just have been unlucky but since last Tuesday I have only seen 2 nukes dropped and both of them were in useless places, before the patch I was seeing at least one every few server hops even if I had missed the initial impact I could still see the red circle but now hardly any, maybe it is just me!!!   
---
Yeah. I was originally doing 900 Reggie now I do about 1200 at 20% (I don‚Äôt have a bloodied weapon yet )
---
I found it in camp venture in the floor safe in the main compound area... 
---
PvP events like monster mash allow them to be unbeatable. Unless you can one shot them, which is highly unlikely since they needed the guns, they can take a hit and get to you and kill you
---
I don't use a team for PvP,  I can hit grounds 100s of levels above me. Cap hunting is fun. 
---
Just to many ppl not willing to take part in Pvp even though it's by far the best way to get caps, big caps. I can make 10-12k in a day, two online periods of 8 hours. Not to shabby ey? Got all I need to win against anyone and PA is no match for a good PVP player. 
---
I‚Äôve had issues with the challenges just being gimmicky... ‚Äúlevel up while wearing a beer hat‚Äù... ‚Äúkill a death claw while wearing a clown mask‚Äù. Why not give challenges that actually.... challenge us? Or give us ideas on how to tackle different game mechanics. Not just a silly time waster to earn 10 cents worth of atoms. 
---
Even better to be able to transfer legendary affixes. Got that sweet sweet lvl 45 dense marie chest armor with a giant CND bar (from having max INT) and a lvl 35 3* marine chest. Moveit on over.
---
And for me 50-75% of the time I fast travel to vault 76.
---
Um where is this? The place your square is , is a fissure but it looks like that is in ash heap
---
Armor pieces with +1 perception are good. There are some pieces that have flat weapon weight reduction of 20% which is nice since rifles have no perk card weight reduction at the moment. Chameleon pieces are nice for rifle builds as well. Are you building crit or sneak?
---
you need one? i gotchu for a decent price. 
---
What do you got? I‚Äôm a melee build. 
---
meathook and dcg. both with +ss +rw. i have a personal dcg with swing and str, and thats the one i get 2200. my meathook it around 1950
---
Yes - crashes a lot since patch 7. A few times just picking locks. ( PC).
---
I explained it several times already, but again: I didn't say that the alcohol in the game makes you wanna drink, promotes algoholism or that I disapprove. I have not said that anyone should feel guilty. 
---
I wanted to know about a personal experience, that some of us might have that I have no knowledge about. Asking questions is a way of aquiring knowledge.
---
Take your meds
---
This thread is about making PvP better, no a way to boost your E-peen.
---
You on ps4? How much would you want
---
I'm not really going serious on a build. I just wanna know what the best armor for taking hits are like should i be using combat armor or marine or what else.
---
Yeah, remove slap damage, so that everyone is taking full damage.
---
Ok thanks. Now that I think about it, I pretty much never have my camp just sitting out there. I'll give that a try and see if I have any success.
---
yes. i could do you some odd 4k or whatever you think is fair. i dont use it anymore so. 
---
I've been playing solo for 350 hours.  Been in PvP maybe twice.
---
&gt; hunt down rouge agents
---
Rogue.  Unless they're commies, in which case maybe rouge is ok.
---
What‚Äôs your psn brother
---
You're the only one who doesn't seem to have a life with all of that trash-speak.
---
You missed the point. Why do you assume I4m ba
---
Defo on board with that, it's fucking ridiculous the damage output some melee weapons have. It's very annoying but I've found Vats and a jump in the air headset drop these dress wearing, claw wielding dildos fast. 
---
whats yours ill add you mine is complicated lol

What are your special stats?

---
I had too many fusion cores fucking up my stash and carry weight so I wanted to give them away. You would have thought I was in a van labeled "free prostate exams" spray painted on the side
---
A lot of those videos had some odd knit picky issues though. The game definitely had problems, no doubt, but some people act like graphical issues (sun rays passing through solid objects) were game breaking as compared to, say, real issues like loot lag, disconnections, or the damage regen bug.
---
They sometimes focused on some really weird issues instead of the ones that mattered.
---
Hungry Vault Suit?
---
I'm level 170 and play single player, no problems. Most people I meet seem to ignore each other.
---
Useful once again this week! 
---
This is a great help. I recently walked into Morgantown station to a suitcase of awesome gear irradiating machine gun. Thank you random citizenüëçüèª
---
On my first guy i had problem that everywhere i went following quests direction i would encounter ennemies way higher level than me. Later i learned that if an higher level player goes through the area just before i do, everything scale for him. On my next guy i use server hop until i see lower level ennemies.
---
About PvP, it happened a few times i was killed like a oneshot, but that was for having a workshop. I play pacifist so that my terrible aim don't start PvP with anyone. But pacifist doesn't protect you (currently). They will change a few things, but not sure how.
---
The other day, i went the house some guy had built in the middle of nowhere. I was going through the forest on foot. I rarely fast travel. The owner of the house must have checked the map and he fast traveled to his camp, went all the north to where i was and began firing at me, killing me very slowly. He was lower level, he wasn't doing me a lot of damage. It was like some annoying mosquito.
---
As long as i don't fire back at him, he can't really kill. Might make me waste some stimpack though. I really don't understand that behavior. I don't kmow if it has something to do with bein on xbox, but this happen very rarely. I mean, sometimes people fire at me and i just go away and they don't follow. But that guy followed me on a long trek. Weird.
---
Yes, we know, everyone posts about how much they love the game and are only level 5 haha just wait, man
---
Just had the daily quest at fort defiance pop up for me 
---
It‚Äôs called the broken window fallacy FYI. 
---
Just bought a brand new PC. It arrived literally on Monday. 1080ti and 32gb of ram, etc. Getting at least 3+ CTD's per day. And getting Disconnected From Server at least once a day too.
---
Last week I had multiple days where I had 5+ hour sessions on the 1 server, playing on it until I was the only person left on it. The longest I stayed on one this week is 3 hours before a crash.
---
I have those, I will have to check it out tomorrow. Thanks for the info.
---
Lack of Scorched Earth is probably because many people who launched a nuke right before the patch dropped are getting 7+ day long cooldown timers for launching another nuke. One of my alts cannot launch a nuke, with over 220 hours still left on its timer.
---
Did you also update your graphic card since?
---
Everything looks much more beautiful on the second capture. Could it be related?
---
New dlc dropped a couple of days ago so have a read at that and also of the road map of up and coming dlcs ect. Alot of new content in the pipeline. What platform do you play on
---
I engaged in PvP once, failed epically but I suspect that if I was any good I might actually enjoy it. I fully accept that if I take a workshop, it may be contested, it is then my choice whether I want to fight for it or simply walk away... or reach out to other players and share resources, even those doing the contesting (it does sometimes pay off).
---
The OP comments that Raiders are part of the lore and uses that as a justification for PvP, which is a perfectly valid argument. By all accounts they were a bunch of sociopathic asshats before the bombs, and if you're a sociopathic asshat in real life, then it makes sense that you're going to fall in line with the whole raider narrative.
---
Contesting workshops, picklocking at camps for resources is raiding. Wanton destruction of a camp for the sake of it is being an asshat. 
---
Thats a consequence of slap damage that will not be part of survival mode. That is not part of balance of the perk and item system.
---
So the string lights as the other guy called them. Cool, thanks for the info. I'll definitely be looking into it. Hopefully no hotfix anytime soon
---
The day you get banned will be a good day.
---
Having literally just come from being falsely banned due to what I can only assume was an automated system, I truly truly hope you guys get it right this time. 
---
Awesome thanks for the answer :)
---
The game is actually really really fun. It's probably at a launch quality state right now. Unfortunately, the last 4 months did nothing good to bring players in.
---
Would definitely love to see scorched BoS soldiers in power armor with heavy weapons in the future. Regular scorched are just annoying now.
---
Same here! Messed up the first time the 3 seconds thing screwed with my head, door didn‚Äôt open. 
---
I have a door system with a level three lock and a keypad door behind it once they get though the locked door there is a turrent waiting for them and a window so that I can shoot them before they can even begin to guess the code.
---
200 lights?! Blackpool illuminations? 
---
With the blade of basset, you learn the crafting recipe, so I believe that you can make a new one at a higher level at a weapons station, can't you?
---
If Peggy Hill got plastered on nukashine and had to get a protectron home.. also I'm filthy mister handy, thanks.
---
When i post about that around, i often they the reply that a lot of low level don't want free stuff. They want to find their own.
---
I wonder what will happen when player vending drop next month.
---
Just discovered this place yesterday but had no idea where to get the passcode! Cheers :)
---
I can predict that nobody will play the designed PvP mode because it's actually way more fair than this one (albeit fruitless)
---
They only want no-risk involved PvP. 
---
Had to move my camp in the new update because of the new build restrictions. When I threw my camp down a tamed rarstaff came out and started kicking the crap out of me (does not damage but is in your face). I haven't had a tamed pet for a while so I guess I am stuck with him now. Pacified it with the Animal Friend perk and he just ignores me now. Weird update :P
---
True. Happened to me. A lot of work for nothing as of now. 
---
Got a few on xbox one x too.
---
Noticed that today, some reason had a big smilenon my face about it lol
---
You were all lucky compared to me, turns out you consume your id cards when you go to get the keys, somebody took them before me, now I have to get them again.
---
Havent seen that info anywhere on the web. I record the stats on all my trade items. Theyre pulled from a level 2 mule (thus no perks, mutations, etc modifiers. Ive just realized all my "Berserker" numbers would be perked by the lack of armor on my mule) and during the least damaging phase (ie: i take "nocturnal" stats during the daytime.)  
---
Certainly not complete, and not perfect (as there isnt a quantifiable # for durability) but it should give an idea of the ranges of weapon damage based on type and level (condition also affects damage)  
---
Heres my list for reference. If you make a copy (file &gt; make a copy) there are two hidden sheets (armorV and weaps, reveal them via View &gt; hidden sheets) that contain all of the unfiltered armor and weapon stats for my collected gear.

---
Sssshhhhhh.
---
I'm always torn with wanting to disseminate info for other players but also BACK OFF THAT'S MINE THIS IS A SURVIVAL GAME GET YOUR OWN. 
---
Legendary effects are the main concern with armor. Depends on if you are wanting a full health build, glass canon build (low health, high damge), low weight sneak build, etc.
---
I can see yet another PvE person for which PvP people are all griefers that prefer their enemies not to shoot back. There will be no discussion here.
---
Totally. I had legendary assaultrons explode and I couldn't see what direction it flew and had to look all over for ten min to find it.  And then I had a legendary town guard land on a building roof.  The problem for me is that you can't see what direction they fly because it happens so fast so you can't claim your loot.
---
This is 100% wrong. Who the fuck is upvoting you? And why would you attempt to answer a question that you clearly do not have the answer to?
---
The game as a whole never considered the difference in player skill, or desire to fight in PvP. The PvP mechanic is either abused, or you lose.
---
Just a heads up, found him near the Charleston shop. If you fast travel there, he was to the left, across the small pond (look for his balloons). Seems like he triggered when I ran to the bridge
---
Stability improvements sound good. Ever since the new update, I've been having lots of trouble with my CAMP build. I've had to rebuild from scratch at another location since my original one was placed off limits after the update. Since then there are times when the response has been slow. I press the button to bring up the build screen and it doesn't work. Then, 5 minutes later when doing something else,it would pop up. Press a button to attach a wire, not work,jump instead. Build something, and not get the "cha-ching" sound and points to level up. Annoying stuff like that. 
---
I think getting low kill times is just a matter of luck in her landings. If I get lucky with the landings, I *can* get sub 2-3, but no matter what I'm seeing her dead in 2 landings and it's sub 10. That was true in patch 2 and it's still true after the most recent patch. Until I see it take more than 2 landings with a capable team, I'm doubtful that anything has changed with the queen. 
---
I guess i want a good health good damage build?
---
Just place your CAMP over a wild acid deposit spot and have your own base farm it using an extractor. Did that and now I dont need to worry about acid anymore.
---
This. Before I found that mod I would get irritated whenever I found a Legendary Light Left Leg when the rest of my characters armor was Legendary Sturdy Leather. Was a pain trying to keep my armor type consistent.
---
Paragraphs please bro, wall of texts are hard to read.
---
The last update broke placing new powered doors. At least it broke the keypad once. I havent tried the other ones.
---
I dont use it myself, but I'm sure you only need one chameleon piece equipped to get the overall effect
---
If anyone is looking for drugs, please come by the Appalachia County Sheriffs Office and ask for your local drug dealer. We‚Äôll give you all the time you deserve.
---
It‚Äôs a known bug. If you equip chameleon armour and remove while the effect is activated it will remain when it shouldn‚Äôt. 
---
It‚Äôs been tested. But the more chameleon armour you have the more clearer you become thus making you harder to see. 
---
As a gamer who really cares about gaming but has little time for it (lvl 39), I'm really not looking forward to my attempt to taking this beast on. Gonna have to find some dudes to help in a few months.
---
Hard out I agree man spending all my caps and sheit
---
It can take some time to learn we have to press two times the enter...
---
Same, was very stable until patch 7.  Now have had two or three CTD.
---
If I kill you, I 100% take your loot.
---
I've been playing solo since Christmas and think it's really fun.  Most people on there are are fine and aren't trying to start PvP.  
---
It's not nerfed to oblivion. It's still the most damaging build in the game just doesnt necsarilly outgun guaranteed head on anymore. Either way i still feel way more powerful than others damage wise.
---
I find it helps me keep points concise aswell. Formatting makes you organize your ideas in a way that‚Äôs easier for others to consume and respond to. I don‚Äôt say it maliciously but just for the benefit of everyone. 
---
Had this happen to me as well, not during pvp, just during a high level super mutant battle. Every hit they did lands, so I'm taking constant damage, but I had to hit each mutant 5-6 times for damage to register..... incredibly frustrating. Having to use stims in a fight that should have been a cake walk, was annoying as well
---
Ive tested all of this and bloodied and adrenal DO stack.......(just take a fucken rad x and you can see that). They either made it non multiplicative, or they nerfed adrenal or bloodied individually idk which but i can tell you for a fact adrenal and bloodied still stack
---
This game is absolutely an MMO. If you need that explained to you, then you are probably ~15 years old and you think WoW was the first MMO.
---
That would make a good high level vault run quest. Make it some sort of vault tec experiment that got out and spread like the FEV.
---
Troll. You‚Äôre not wanted in the game.
---
Best advice for now is to shoot them from far away. At that point it‚Äôs 50-50 if they blow or at all. The legendary bots are suppose to. 
---
I‚Äôve killed 45ish today and only lost 2. One that got stuck on the ams building and the other turned into a pile and got stuck under a car because anew legendary bot spawned taking its place. 
---
They carry miniguns sometimes but never drop the same weapons when they die.
---
Yeah, once I found out they could kill you anywhere on the map, I stopped claiming workshop.  There's nothing there I can't scavenge just as quick somewhere else.  I think it would make more sense to have a 2 min timer count down when they contest the base and you can return to your workshop to duel it out or you can just let it go.  Really dumb how someone can stick a bullet in your back at any time, anywhere on the map and you won't even get a warning.
---
You‚Äôre getting downvoted by assholes 
---
Just do it
---
Metal armor, preferably with vanguard, 1 perception/luck, and probably weapon weight reduction. Probably want a dense torso mod and the other pieces are more of dealer's choice.
---
Nope, they are literally just playing the game, the way it was designed. Not sure why OP thinks he was "harassed". Typical reddit snowflake.
---
Here‚Äôs an idea... it‚Äôs called lobbying and your side is losing
---
If you put in a ticket. You need to do it under a category of like "download error", for it to actually go to a human being. Otherwise they are pretty just putting your request in the bin. 
---
Wrongo, turd.
---
Some notes on armor:  
---
100 damage (all physical) incoming  
---
392 phys resist (no lone wanderer or other % reductions) = 30.39 dmg after armor.   
---
100 phys resist = 50.03 dmg after armor  
---
now lets add 3\* lone wanderer (-20% dmg)  
---
392 resist is now only 28.44 dmg 
---
100 resist is 40.03.
---
Another way:
---
392 resist/no lone wanderer is barely better than 100 resist with 20% reduction from 3\* LW. (30.39 vs 40.03) A single piece of appropriately matched -15% armor brings this down to 32.52. 100 resist+35% dmg reduction is almost at good as \~400 resist. (eg: wearing 1 each of mutant slayers, trouble shooters, and ghouls + 3\* lone wanderer is nearly as good as my highest nonPA defense. That includes mutations and perks as well. So the 100 resist is actually pretty low. Im pulling 137 resist from just perks and mutations.)  
---
Conclusion: Legendary effects and perks are far better than pure defense. Basically you wanna have \~1.5-2x as much armor as the incoming damage you're taking. beyond that is severely diminishing returns.
---
Made a spreadsheet for doing exactly these types of comparisons. Herd mentality isnt working on it ATM, though ill prob fix it tonight at some point.  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ztGhctDRwctfsJLPq86VJ8OE9MYvrSJRvvBKspWZMQc/edit#gid=178350603](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ztGhctDRwctfsJLPq86VJ8OE9MYvrSJRvvBKspWZMQc/edit#gid=178350603)   
---
Might be neat paired with some acrobat armor.  
---
Not very useful, but it could look cool falling from a high place... I guess...?
---
And yes. Ive been successful with getting a refund, but it was under different circumstances. I bought the Christmas emotes, I complained about false advertising, fake discounting, and misleading information of the item description. They refunded my atoms and let me keep the emotes
---
I ran into a scorched wielding a 50.cal but he held the gun 90 degrees rotated to the side so I barely recognized it. When killed him the 50.cal was replaced by a combat rifle. 
---
Vanguards is good armor for keeping your hp at full. Gives +35 damage resistance at full health. What platform are you on?
---
just go for it
---
&gt;  one of the players threatens to ‚Äúcall a hit‚Äù on my account
---
Normally when I take workshops, it's just for challenges. I rarely find them useful, I'm not interested in min-maxing resources or whatever. Free fast travels are nice I guess but not necessary. Certainly not luxurious enough to require me to be in PVP all of the time.
---
You seem like you are just playing like some regular Joe and not maximizing your build, which is fine. In that case, heavy combat armor is tougher than marine and heavy BOS combat armor is even a little tougher. Like the other commenter mentioned, you can farm the BOS stuff in the Glassed Cavern on the dead soldiers (especially Taggerdy in the end). You can buy the plans for regular heavy combat armor at vendors.   
---
There is a mod what does that
---
Asking the teal questions. 
---
Depends on if it's the armor or mutation. You need to be crouched for both I believe. Berry mentats highlight living characters which negates chameleon as well.
---
Not everyone wants to or can play with mods. 
---
This should be a ingame function. 
---
I‚Äôm not risking getting banned for using mods. 
---
Do you know which vendors have the heavy combat armor plans? Every vendor i've seen has almost the exact same plans with only heavy leather plans.
---
Yea, I'm usually met with "You still care about that crap" etc
---
Marine plans spawn often in the bunk house in Camp Venture. I pick up 2-3 a day. Look on the shelves in the kitchen.
---
Just keep in mind if you connect a power line directly to the keypad it will be open at all times, so you‚Äôll need to connect a power line to the switch box at the opposite side, the door will give you a preset code for the door so make sure you remember it, I use a keypad power pylon to open the door on the inside, but to do this you‚Äôll need to run a cable from the keypad power pylon directly to the keypad, or to a pylon connecting to it, the keypad power pylon is timed so it will close behind you, alternatively you can use a pressure plate, you can also control them with a terminal but they don‚Äôt shut by themselves, and I don‚Äôt think you can control individual doors
---
What are you playing on ?
---
Add TheNinjaSloth  
---
I have a chest piece I'd like you to mod &lt;3
---
Don‚Äôt let it get to you. Someone will grief them in return.  All things come full circle. 
---
Hey. With that said, though, I'm kind of liking the thought of fishing in Fallout. But only if I can hang the biggest, ugliest god forsaken fish on my wall.
---
I have the Margarita version. You'll need the Tequila first.
---
Might seem obvious, but now I have to wait until I find that recipe. 
---
I dont have a mutation and i dont use mentats
---
Unless you can come up with combinations that don‚Äôt exist now. Seems unnecessary. Not to mention it would mess with the power curve.
---
It would be cool however. 
---
"Today i had a totally average gameplay experience!"
---
True. Maybe one day.
---
Recon scopes and the recon mod for PA can highlight you before you become corporal. 
---
so, you're a mirelurker
---
Oh that makes sense, thanks !
---
I was going to say the same thing. I use the Xbox app to post my screenshots to the fo76 market or imgur and they're still high resolution.
---
Plus, the interface of the Xbox is app much more user friendly than the one drive app on the Xbox.
---
Dopey Dogmeat! Not even madüòÅ
---
#header1 WHY DO I SEE EVERY BOTTLECAP
---
I'm guessing it's going to be another "impacts some players" thing.  I just hope I'm not the only one!
---
I would love to see more deadlier chems. Heavier side effects. Getting kinda tired of seeing airhead melee players hopped up on psycho running people down. 
---
Maybe twisting the effects to be the strongest when consuming and getting weaker.  
---
Also more mixtures with calm-x would be cool. 
---
I was thinking of setting up camp on that junk pile near the Top of the World train station when the vending machines are added to the game and I was going to sell what the bot sells and then some at a lowered price, hopefully stealing his business, even in the end of the world robots continue to steal our jobs, what‚Äôs a robot gonna do with caps? Don‚Äôt buy from a robot, but from me lol 
---
You aren't an actually bloodied build then. Im sick of clueless comments honestly
---
Thanks I'll try this. I just can't believe for the price of $14 there's no confirmation message. I knew it was going to burn me when the purchase button is also the preview button. I feel like they know what they're doing by making these the same button. It's in the design to accidentally purchase an item.
---
Didn't think of it that way, thanks 
---
Yup, don‚Äôt gotta get those cards. Just hop sessions until they show up. But be warned that it‚Äôll be a couple dozen server hops before you‚Äôll see a plan and a bunch of players doing the same shit. Preferably past lvl 100
---
Yep, I have one piece only and it works
---
It‚Äôs crazy for ‚ÄúServer Hopping‚Äù to literally be necessary to advance this quest. I don‚Äôt mind the plans being like the t51b as like 1 per server but the dome 7 key is stupid.
---
What system? I hear more Xbox people complaining than the other 2 platforms. I personally use ps4, and rarely have any issues. Ps4 is hardwired, and I play probably 16+ hours a week. Things are getting fixed decently from what I can tell. 
---
The game has gotten better. Dlc just dropped (well) the first part of it did) still has it bugs from time to time. Pvp is a hot mess. But it‚Äôs still fun. 
---
i have bought several games from there without any problem
---
It is in the OP's post: 748250
---
I really enjoyed playing it solo. The loneliness of the world helps you be immersed with the holotapes that are left behind. 
---
Got an alert while I was at work, got on with my buddy to try and at least get a key for both of us.
---
Decided to check the Dome first when I signed on, it was already open, got the plans. :)
---
We then went through the steps to get the cards and keys.
---
The cards were easy enough to find following the video. We then started server hopping to try to get the key. 
---
The generated code is server specific from what we found, while if you have the key cards they can be used once, but on any server.
---
Hopped until we found the door to the key unopened. Figured out we had to get a code for that server, so my buddy got one while I waited in the keypad room, then he got the key. Unfortunately, the Dome door was opened already, so he hopped several more times at the Dome until he got the plans. He then helped me get the Dome key with my cards.
---
Ended up hopping at least 30 times. Only ran into other players at the cabin a couple of times, so I think most people already have a key and are trying to get the plans at this point.
---
Good to find out the cards are good across servers, just need a new code to made them work.
---
They should have added a slope because the smallest items on the floor can stop you walking in your heavy power armour.... 
---
People here don't seem to understand the workshops. You're not automatically opened up to PVP, rather if someone starts to contest the workshop it throws you into PVP. Before they go to it and push the button to contest, you take slap damage like everyone else. I play way too much and almost always take a couple or three workshops, so you can trust me. If you don't want to PVP just leave the server when you get the notice it's being contested. Honestly, it doesn't happen very often. I've played over 300 hours, taken countless workshops, and had maybe five contested. Take them for the xp, the plans, and the resources. They're great. Or, just help defend other people's workshops for the same things minus resources. 
---
Watoga emergency services. Equip the perk to search containers. I can walk out with  8-15 on a good day. 
---
Ammo just collect the mats you need. And get ammo Smith 2 and super duper. And have fun. 
---
Meh, I prefer the prototype paint job anyway, already had to craft a whole new set (including mods) just to get it back lol
---
I agree matey, I bought this for ¬£13 for it brand new on PS4 and within 48 hours I bought a second copy for my GF to play with me. I get peoples criticism and why its not like other Fallout 3D games but I enjoy what they are aiming for with a more survival vibe than traditional Bethesda game. Anyway level 14 so far so good.

If anyone wants to play with us my ID is mr\_pattybean

Bethesda's money back guarantee- 'we guarantee under no circumstances will you get your money back'

Playing Bethesda games without mods that's like trying to eat frozen pizza - it's possible but why the fuck would you do that :-D

Aaaah, good to know, thanks!

Yeah noticed it myselfe after a short time,  that the noise really borders me lol.
---
But it's still better than the constant high pitched humming of the fusion generator. That drives me really crazy! 
---
Thank you!! :D
---
You should have got a pop up saying your workshop was being contested. That's a good time to leave the server. 
---
That‚Äôs your problem. You shouldn‚Äôt be spending caps on either. Stims come from events mostly, you can also get a luck perk to increase your chance to find them in the world. Later game you get the recipe to craft them.
---
Craft ammo too. Get lead and steel from killing robots. If you need more lead, go to Lucky Hole Mine with your excavator armour and a ton of lead to smelt.
---
I'm having the same issue. This sucks.
---
Only if it brings honeybeasts
---
That's some powerful stuff. Why does everything taste purple?
---
How the hell did I get here?
---
Grab Hemlock holes when you login. Check back every 20 min. 60 acid/hour (which will net you almost double the 5.56 vs ammo factory, with far fewer round expended to defend it)
---
Lead ore: Lucky hole mine + excavator PA. 400+ ore, usually over 1200 scrap with super duper. 
---
Iron ore (steel): Hornwright test site #3 (right next to vault 63) theres a bunch right next to the spawn point. (the rocks just above) also a bunch more towards the hill in the distance (think its NW, but im not home to double check.) Basically go towards the hill and keep an ear out for the super mutants that are pretty much always there.
---
Coincidentally, I was trying to get this yesterday, and I can‚Äôt even get the key at the Nuka Cola plant. May as well just wait for something not terrible to turn up on the Atom Shop. 
---
You can‚Äôt justify baiting PvP, there‚Äôs a reason it has to be mutual, aside from having a bounty and owning a workshop, saying you‚Äôre just ‚Äúplaying the game as it‚Äôs designed‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make you less of a dick for doing it, especially if you‚Äôre like 60 levels higher
---
Yup, you win the Internet today 
---
I mean if you go through all the stuff to get the key, then all you have to do is go to the dome to find the paint job. Once you have the key, that's it. That's all you have to do. Or you can get lucky like one of my teammates yesterday, who came across dome 7 that had been previously opened, and the recipe was STILL there. He didn't even have the key!!
---
Speaking of trolling low-levels, I‚Äôm actually positively surprised I‚Äôve never seen Flatwoods/Vault 76 get nuked. 
---
The trick is to get the two keys. Then head to the secret room and see if the secret room door is open. If it is jump servers until you find one that‚Äôs not. Then you go get the terminal code. Then hope once you open the door the key is actually there. One you have the Dome key you don‚Äôt lose it after opening the dome. If the plans not on the desk you can server jump and keep looking.
---
It's super easy if you have a bunch of bloodied builds to kill her, or everyone comes kitted out with tonnes of prime ammo. I've been at queen fights lasting less than 5 minutes. 
---
I think the issue comes when casual players turn up with their 300 rounds for their gun doing 180 damage. They *think* they're helping and they have good intentions, but they're just buffing the SBQ's health and not really adding to the takedown. Other people just get distracted by the trash mobs and end up out of ammo for the queen. 
---
I saw a team of about 6 players nuke fissure prime three times in a row a few days ago, and they had her sorted every time before the timer was half done. 
---
I never had this problem with the new patch,was worried so I shot on and creeper up on it expecting it to go boom.
---
Collecting soot flowers and bloodless in the forest is trivially easy. Craft healing selves and save your stimpacks for when you really need them.
---
I fucking hate mole miners...
---
I managed to get it after about 2 hours of hopping. The fact the cards get destroyed on use and the passcode resets if you quit is extra frustrating. Then even when you get the key most servers are missing the plans even if the bunker is locked. Plus the normal nuka paint looks better. Finally put it on my armour and thought 'is that it'?
---
I guess it's good news that I've just opened up 3 new spaces for perks then...
---
You should have no problems with them.
---
They kinda look cute, I‚Äôd like to have one in my camp while I am watching Star Wars on my tv for more immersion 
---
Xbox. 
---
I read through the newest update right before it came out and it made me feel like ‚Äúokay just do it‚Äù but I also know how complex this game can be and wasn‚Äôt sure about new features that might have come out in the interim. Are player shops a thing yet or still just trading? 
---
Power-fist, block, shield-bash for the stagger, and WHAM power-attack. Heads go POP, Arms explode...
---
It's kinda like Turbo Kid! 
---
i nearly always spawn in in Hemlock holes and have had him appear there quite a few times on my initial load in. 
---
Prob around 5% or so of the time. Which is pretty high considering i went 130 some levels between finding him on my own. (found him the first time @ level 10ish)
---
I got either the marine arms or legs and artillery plan, I'm low on caps but you can name a price for caps and if I can match that I will. 
---
Ammo is easy to craft and stimpaks that I find while exploring just weight me down because I have so many I'm constantly selling them
---
So what is the deal with Deathclaw Gauntlets? I'm level 80 and got 3 shotted by a guy who had one on but he was only level 40ish, is it bugged or something?
---
How much for a max LVL set of xo1 and jetpack cost?
---
...lets be honest. No one really uses it everyday life. Maybe people who try to get screenshot of big damage do it for temporary, but everyday life you don't bother with. Especially when you aren't melee. And that is a 4 point sacrifice for temporary boost.
---
Never gonna happen. Scorchbeasts are somebody's Mary Sue Villian. They gotta make you feel awe about how Powerful and Serious they are. Irradiated bats grew 70x their normal size, gained sentience, can breathe energy blasts, bleed radiation like a fart cloud, and have personally turned every NPC into ghouls or statues. 
---
I made so much gunpowder with that cloth. Thanks.
---
I phased FD out of my route for that reason ages ago.
---
I might go visit it again just to bask in the glory of patched stairs
---
But where does that passcode come from ? I'm sure the idea is not to try 999,999 random numbers in the hope of hitting the jackpot
---
It is
---
Having no Grape Mentas, not much of a big deal. I have never used it and I never seen reason to use it. I even take the "Hard Bargain" off, because I always have more stuff to sell, than they have caps to buy.
---
Well looks like ps4 servers in Asia Pacific are tapped dry - 20 server hops and no keys.
---
If you wait 5- 10 seconds in the basement the secret door will open if you have already used the code or  if someone else has (not sure wich as I did use the code in one world without seeing if ) but all have had the key taken ...
---
Where do you get the pressure plate plans?
---
Omg we are neighbors! I‚Äôm on the cliff face on the right there. I‚Äôve never seen another camp there or not been able to place mine. It‚Äôs such a pretty spot 
---
I just bought it again, pretty keen to try it again
---
I think one advantage they'd have over other creatures is the fact that they have guns, so they can attack hostiles from a distance. 
---
Could get creative and have no doorway into your house at all.  Saw a house with no imediately visible way in a couple days ago out in the Savage Divide; so out of curiosity, I made my way to a higher elevation point within sight of the roof and sure enough the roof had a hole in you could drop through.  The problem is it was too high for marsupial, so I wager someone with Marsupial and a Jetpack built that house.
---
I personally did something similar, but the only way in normally is through radioactive water.  So either have Aquaboy/girl equipped a Hazmat Suit or PA(which would take forever.  But from the outside, you can't even tell there's a way in.
---
However, no matter how creative you are with not having a proper entrance, or even if you use a powered door, griefers only need to destroy a wall to get in.
---
What did you use as the bar?
---
Am I missing something or did 2 extra stairs actually put a smile your face?
---
Yeah I agree, just imagine taming one with a missile launcher x)
---
You can't put a nuke there there's a restriction to some areas or something
---
I've always been a solo player, have never played multiplayer online games, so I was concerned that I might not enjoy this game. However, I am a Fallout fan, so I had to at least try. It took a little adjusting for me, mainly because of things I've never done like events, and trying to hide from other players because of all I had read about griefers. I have been playing solo since the BETA, and I'm hooked. There are some quests I find that are difficult, some I just can't accomplish, because they are meant for a team to do it, but I just don't worry about that, I enjoy trying anyway. Very few players have bothered me. And only one that flat out attacked me (well, my camp), and I'm guessing I probably placed my camp where they usually do, and wanted the spot back. No biggie, I just quit the game and came back on another server, and fixed the little damage he did and continued my game. All in all, I would recommend at list giving it a try. It really can be fun. Regarding the loneliness that others are talking about, I did go through a short period where I missed NPC's that aren't robots, but I've gotten over that. I hope you try it, and hope you enjoy it!
---
Too many people have done that now, I can't find any servers with the basement doors closed.
---
The most of the forest region cant be nuked due to it being a low level area. When you decide to nuke somewhere, there is a big green safe zone on most of the forest that prohibits griefing against low levels
---
I just lined up a bunch of small bookshelves, worked better than I expected! Tis a lil fiddly and cant get the side entierly flat, but hey nothing is perfect in the wasteland =p
---
That‚Äôs too bad. It‚Äôll die down after a week or two. If you‚Äôre PC I can paint your PA for now if it helps. 
---
What was fixed? All I see are two more steps.
---
Great map for vendor factions.

---
My play-times that are all over the board, so I made a bunch of FO76 tools to help with tracking. Vendor timer lets you select the vendor (by faction or location) and set a timestamp for when you sold to them. Then it auto-calcs the time that vendor will be available again. Just make a copy (the linked one is open access, so people tend to mess with the unprotected boxes. EG: your data will be overwritten)

Sorry lost connection to the server, Will be back in a sec! at the moment i also have chorditis so i cannot speak sadly.
---
I just read this a few minutes ago, found the comment where the guy said you don't need the items. So I start F76, fast travel, door is open, I grab the plans, and paint my armor instantly. Feels bad, wish the door was just locked forever unless you do the steps. Id like to do them.
---
I'm about lvl 40, haven't teamed up with anybody so far, and I'm really enjoying it. I LOVE the camp feature (settlement building was my favorite part of F4), and adventuring is great. Still lots of story in the game, and it is about as fleshed out as any of the other games. I have only run into like one quest so far where I am waiting until I can find at least one other person to help me with it.
---
I'm sorry, but I've list my account and I'll need that kind of help myself in the future. Look at my post in the profile for details...
---
From some event. It's hard to get it but it's been duped to shit so globally not really rare anymore. 
---
Thanks but ps4. Just need to be patient I guess.
---
Ah what the heck
---
Downloading 
---
The stairs at ft. defiance were just a little too high to just walk up before the patch. You'd have to jump to clear the steps or you'd just be stuck running into the first step lol Not a big deal but with the marsupial mutation it makes it a little more annoying to deal with.
---
But yeah either way 2 extra stairs made me pretty happy!
---
But still, where do people find the code?
---
While I was hopping for the quantum paint job, there were several occasions where one or even two people were waiting outside the locked tnt dome, waiting to yoink the plans from someone who did have the keys.
---
On one attempt, where it was already open and looted, a guy told me about how he snagged the keys from a guy who had just opened the secret door at the cabins.
---
I dunno if this is strictly griefing, and I try not to be a pansy about griefers, but it's a lot more dickish than I've come to expect from the general community.
---
Asking the wheel questions.
---

---
I think of these as being a bit different from Camden Park. When I can't get that daily to trigger, most players I come across either have 0 tokens or don't want to trade. 
---
But many players have already begun hanging out at the bar and roleplaying bartenders and selling drinks and ingredients, building their own camp into a bar, etc. So apart from the crafting challenges it seems like many could be purchased from other players who already have the recipes 
---
This is the difference between steps (bottom) and obstacle (top)
---
I don't understand the problem, I'm missing something?  
---
If you pick a lock you get a bounty, when you are wanted everyone can attack you and initiate PvP at will (turrets are going to shoot him too).  
---
The only difference is that if you kill him you will only get 5 caps, but if picking locks made you hostile to the owner, every griefer would do that to get a chance at killing the owner (like with the workshops).  
---
I'm new to it too. I am enjoying it, haven't had any bugs yet, but the lack of NPCs is kind of shit. I'm enjoying it though, and I got it for 15 bucks. 
---
It's in the atom shop.
---
front entrance whitespring
---
Pacifist doesnt affect incoming damage. at all.  in any way shape or form. 
---
It stops YOU from damaging THEM. 
---
Its only function is to prevent accidental shootings of players &amp; workshops.
---
I have actually put conduits on trees to get around that problem. lol I don't care what it looks like.
---
You need the original so yo hi still ok not get one
---
25% Damage Resist and 100 Rad Resist, which stack with Med-X for the Damage Resist or Radshield for the Rad Resist.  So if you are still taking too much from Ghouls/nuke zones even in PA, add Lead Champagne to the mix(preferablly with Party Boy/Girl so it last longer.
---
Also, If you have Marsupial and don't have Bird Bones, the faster falling can make for quicker intervals for you evassive hops.
---
Other than that, it is pretty meh.
---
Atom shop
---
+karma thx
---
Again... 3x3 building. Go from one wall to the other. A 1x1 square may not accumulate as much overage.
---
(Note that this may be easier to align on a PC, I'm using a console on for both games.)
---
By the time I reached the far wall the overhead lengths were a hair too long.
---
I didn't try with just short junctions.
---
I might have been able to slightly skew the entire run to fudge the distances as there must be some hypotenuse that can solve the triangle.
---
It would be better if they'd just do the really simple math and give some snap to the pieces as spending twenty minutes with a console controller to properly string an electric grid, and needing to make it crooked to boot just wasn't pleasing. I ended up tearing it out for now.
---
Any worthwhile rewards? 
---
oh didnt see it ill have to look
---
I'm about 70 hours in and all of that I spent playing alone. 
---
My experience with Camden Park has been that I usually have to fast travel either there or near there. Otherwise it's not listed in pip-boy and typically doesn't pop up notifications. Something about putting the camden park employee outfit on and then removing it has seemed to have an impact too. 
---
Most of the time when I travel there from elsewhere with the outfit on the daily quest appears. But not always, and I haven't figured out any other factors yet. It doesn't seem related to whether any other players are there
---
Awesome! Glad you‚Äôre back in action:-)
---
Curious, what platform are you on?  I can guess.
---
Initially I was super pissed because my CAMP got hit by a no build zone, was too close to Harper's. ~~how are we to rebuild america if we can build in and around towns that need to be rebuilt~~
---
This budget increase helped me get over it. I still miss my old spot and wish I could've seen it more decorated, but I was able to build something similar nearby and with more detail. I'm really proud of it, even though there's still one area I can't figure out what to do with still. I even had a group of people swing by and start playing the instruments on my patio/balcony. I have one of each buildable instrument there and they were all being played. It really made my day.
---
FC's in PA and Generators are 25%.  FC's from mobs are 50% are far as I can tell.  FC's that are lying around(like next to the Poseidon FC producer are 75%.  And FC's from said producer's are 100%.
---
Before the patch, you could find them at % other than multiples of 25.
---
Ah, good to know, thanks. I've launched a nuke once, but being the first time, I went straight to Fissure Prime without exploring the map.
---
I run a sniper build and can also confirm that stealth is not working properly. I'm still getting those same eternal \[DANGER\] problems, \[CAUTION\] now means "you killed a level 3 scorched with a suppressed shot and every enemy in the entire town knows exactly where you are", and Escape Artist doesn't seem to work at all anymore. I feel like I'm a walking bottle of Nukashine.
---
Flatwoods area is my most common spot to find him. 
---
I dread to see him now, he costs me a small fortune. I just have to buy something from him each time.
---
Although his words of wisdom are priceless!
---
Keys drop as loot?  What game are you playing
---
I don't think you can tame one. There was a YouTube vid that claimed you could around the time of the TSE nerf but I never saw a post showing you could so I dunno where the information is coming from haha. Could you link where it mentions that in the notes?
---
Nice!
---
yep, there are many stupid tricks that can be used.
---
But camp and base building is hugely aesthetic if you go even one step past necessary, so doing the thing that looks stupid makes the whole thing a huge "why bother".
---
Like I said, the math Shouldn't Be That Hard‚Ñ¢.
---
Indeed, I think I could put the first piece in "slightly skew" to the wall and make it fit with "enough" monkeying around. But getting exact placement with a PS4 controller when viewing the screen from my couch is already tricky enough for large items. 
---
I've plays over 300 hours, all solo. I enabled pacifist mode as soon as I could, so I've never been in an actual pvp fight. I've had assholes contest a workshop I'd claimed so they could one shot me, but that's only happened a few times (3 times max, and I've claimed workshops dozens of times). 99% of the people I come across wave and then go about on their way. Team-ups aren't that common, mainly due to the bad UI the social menu has. Of the few times I've had someone invite me to join their group while we both explore an area, I can't even see the invitation to accept it half the time.
---
I don't recall even seeing another player for the first time until after I'd already been playing til level 15 or so. 
---
Most of the time you won't run into other players unless you specifically seek them out.
---
Set up a 3x3 or 3x5 building and try it. using at least two "long" horizontal segments. In my 3x3 building the run ended up too long to place the second pass-through.
---
Because of trigonometry I know that I could guess some angle theta so that the resulting hypotenuse made the components fit, but the guess then try then tear-out then guess then try cycle, using a PS4 controller and the viewing distance from couch to television promised an experience disjunct from the realm of "fun"... So I came here to complain. 8-)
---
Shill
---
Yeah it isn‚Äôt that rare anymore I seen them go for under 1000 caps
---
So I did this last night. And I purposely quenched my thirst with sink water. It worked great, but I did find myself acquiring disease several times, even though my health was robust while drinking. I guess I'd rather carry around a bunch of disease cure than all of the food and water I'm trying to manage. I still brought purified water with me though, as a crutch.
---
OK, but it wasnt an event, it was an early quest, I got it last week ago with a new second character, very early in the game.
---
Welcome to the wastes

Sorry i already got them thanks anyway though :) Updated Post

very sly comment sir, take my upvote.
---
We should be able to mark certain things in our inventory as "for sale" so that when we present it in the trade menu only said items appear in it.
---
And while I'm already commenting. Please give us the ability to name our weapons which then would exempt them from scrapping right away.
---
Sweet, I had a hunch as thats what I did too lol
---
if you've never been to defiance those steps were not climbable, you had to jump to get up them.
---
Uranium fever still gives 2+ star stuff. I've run into a few during the technical data quest but it seems to really be dwindling. Harper's Ferry used to be decent but now it's pretty sh\*t. I'd understand the nerf if nuking areas and the scorchbeast queen drops meant some better loot. I rarely get serum recipes from the queen anymore. I don't know why drills and syringers are in the legendary loot pool. I'd rather a foam middle finger sign so I could at least enjoy showing it off to other players.
---
Melee is generally easier to be better with, especially early on. There are plenty of ways to do decent gun damage but then crafting ammo becomes a concern that melee players don‚Äôt have. 
---
All that said, I play with guns because melee would get boring. 
---
Askin the McBeal question
---
Well done m8!
---
Both of those would be very useful. The trading system needs some major working and sadly it went a step in the wrong direction with the removal of item effect viewing in this last patch.
---
I love them served up with a side of bullets. üòâ
---
Yeah thanks for the valuable advice. Can you read? Any other tipps? What are you doing? 
---
Kill a deathclaw while _only_ wearing a clown mask, would that be challenging enough for you?
---
When I was at a low level I had a terrible time with killing them, I‚Äôd only ever run into them when I had zero stimpacks and little to no ammo.
---
Their species is now my characters arch nemesis.
---
*by defending him.
---
Get it right.
---
Same.  
---
Implement percent completion.
---
All cases of non robot mobs exploding(or catching fire when you criple an arm) is from them being "fused" in their coding with either a legendary robot or as of more recently, any robot.  This happens in any area that could spawn robots or a type of non robot.  Also, at least before patch 7, robots that spawned in those areas would have a blood effect when hit.
---
I sure do! That one seems like MUCH more of a challenge ü§£ 
---
the perk system is absolute torture
---
Yea the General‚Äôs Steakhouse has been pretty barren as well.
---
I‚Äôve had pretty good luck with the Super Mutant shack just north of Whitesprings.
---
Melee and unarmed are ridiculously overpowered. They need to be needed just like the TSE guns were nerfed 
---
What system you on?
---
Where are you finding bears to farm?
---
If you are meaning human-power?  I bet not.
---
Alls well that ends well.  Especially with Nukashine.  üòâ
---
Speech to text,  easy to do.
---
I was playing last night and got a couple legendary protectrons at watoga within 5 minutes. Haven‚Äôt checked out westek since the patch but i often run from the northern part of the mire down to watoga for legendaries, a legendary deathclaw also spawns (occasionally) at the thunder mtn substation just north of watoga. Lots of places in the mire to farm!
---
Agreed... can't complete half these challenges
---
Came back to the game after about 2 months and didn't realize this change had been made, so I smashed a legendary with my hammer and instantly died. Tried to respawn nearby and my game crashes.
---
War, war never changes.
---
Melee scales better with special points. Gun damage picks up later on with perk cards and seems to rely more on legendary effects. As far as straight time investment and points melee is probably the easiest.
---
I just wanna cook some jet. 
---
Platform? 
---
Considering that SPECIAL stats are non-refundable, you may want to start over.  
---
IMO, wait a few more patches.    
---
Focus on exploration.  Its post-the-apocalypse, whats the rush?
---
What am I looking at here?
---
Tried multiple times, but everytime it fails while enter code...
---
Invalid or something...
---
Will keep trying, but fast travelling all the time is depleting my caps to fast like that
---
I understand. I too want to buy some Atoms but it is not available in my region. Seems many good looking skins will be sold in this patch, so need to do the chellenges and save us enough Atoms.
---
Just be happy you weren't taken to a Nuke Zone.  At least I didn't get a good mutation, so I didn't feel bad about curing it.  And luckily I wasn't on a low level character so I had the caps to fast travel back and Radaway to remove the Rads.  Still, be careful drinking Nukashine, you never no where it will take you.
---
Griefers usually are in teams, they can crash there game with 10 seconds left on a nuke countdown and just relog and there base will be gone for the explosion and reload back in unharmed. Plus they usually have a large amount of junk... from greifing 
---
Sorry, XB1.
---
If someone gets enough reports they get flagged. Then a human checks the reported out. 
---
Exactly. And you didn't make a post online she you died?  
---
Did u get credit for the fight or did you have to fast travel back ?
---
I would wait til next patch if you are on pc. I've had a lot of crashing issues in this most recent patch. Characters should be fine if you are 20 hours in unless you are really wanting to do a min?max build.
---
The same nonsense every day on this sub. People post the same topic over and over to try and make it seem more important. The latest is *Griefers, griefers everywhere!*. Seriously? They can't kill you unless you stand still for 5 minutes and **let them**. Use 2 stims and it's 10 minutes. I still people saying they get 1 hit by other players. No you don't. This game wraps us in cotton wool from other players already and that's coming from somebody that doesn't even PVP! Tried it once in 500 hours.
---
People around here don't know what griefing is and don't know how good we've got it. Come play GTAO in an open lobby on PC for a few hours with 'modders'. Even that game has a cooldown on passive mode because it's a bad idea to let people toggle it on and off if it protects you from damage like you're suggesting.

---
Two shots with a non legendary gama gun can do it
---
I‚Äôd imagine they would also look for patterns of complaints for an individual. If I get one complaint for harassment it might not do anything but if I get 5 complaints from different people it might raise some flags. 
---
Go back to playing the sims
---
Of course, but how can someone from customer support know if who got reporter was really harassing another player or not?
---
Just keep doing events. I know it costs to travel there but they reward you with 30-40ish caps each time you complete one. 
---
i have 26.400 caps, the problem is not the number, but the fact that i don't own the caps, they poped in, i never earned that much caps
---
When you already feel awful the withrawal isn't as noticable I guess!
---
The post "\[PC\] Useful ini Settings Everyone Should Check Out", will be of interest.  
---
Mama Dolce's Food Processing Plant has like 10 cans lying around
---
Glad I did it right when the servers came back on yesterday. Didn‚Äôt know it would be this bad for people üòÖ
---
Oh ok, I thought you were looking for somewhere else to grind legendaries.
---
Well, some of the stuff I do in Fallout 76 is..
---
Help other players complete quests.
---
Give excess stuff away or sell it.
---
Hang out with my friends hunting large prey.
---
Look for a nice new C.A.M.P location.
---
Move my C.A.M.P and completely rebuild.
---
Take over a workshop and build something cool and crazy for free.
---
Explore the areas inland around the marked ones and try and figure out a back story.
---
Try whenever possible to achieve the ultimate end game... a "Perfectly Preserved Pie"
---
Nice, I‚Äôll take the shells &amp; wouldn‚Äôt mind taking a look though your plans. 
---
With the chemist perk, you can craft two stimpacks instead of one, and you can turn one stimpack into four diluted ones. Dilute all your stimpacks and use a first-aid perk level two or three, and those diluted will be plenty of health for you. Plus, crafting four at a time, they start piling up quick. 
---
For ammo, I just farm all the materials I need and use the ammosmith leveled up to get the most bang for my buck. 
---
I also end up getting a ton of ammo I don‚Äôt use from fallen enemies and just give it away or trade for stuff I need. 
---
Yeah, but if my entire Discord of 10/20 players start reporting someone because we don't like him?
---
You aren't the only one.  The Camden Park dailies don't pop for me :(.
---
I would figure the weather in this zone would at least require some breathing apparatus because all of that questionable white dust flying around in the air can't be good for the lungs at all. It's the same train of thought I get about the Ash Heap and its soot, though.
---
I also buy Atoms monthly to support the game.  No money means no new content.   
---
I got it today and am in love with it, thanks for this! 
---
Just a tip: the dome key is a world object on a pedestal (as opposed to an instanced object in a container like the other dome keys), so it can be taken before you get there and you'll have to repeat all the steps again. If the door in the Nuka Cola plant is unlocked when you get there, server hop til you get a locked one.
---
Free rider.  
---
Consoles have no access to mods sadly
---
Ah yes this will revolutionise xp glitches.
---
&gt;See you at level 500 folks.
---
Might be too OP but its effects should be like increasing melee swing speed, reloading speed and moving speed, thinking how they worked in Fallout 3 and 4.
---
Filthy Cowboy!!! YaHoo!!!
---
Yeah, it's also fun killing them afterwards since most of the time they dont fight back
---
Fast travel to crevasse dam and keep server hopping...
---
You'll get him 
---
Yes. Very rare. Supposely can occasionally be found in the mire. 
---
Well, I was using one of the workbenches in the shop in Whitesprings. I could not test with the one in my camp yet. 
---
I‚Äôd think it would start an investigation. Not saying it‚Äôs impossible the Bethesda would be lazy about it but if they don‚Äôt use due diligence they‚Äôre going to piss off a lot of people... then the ‚ÄòI got banned for NOTHING‚Äô posts start up again 
---
I‚Äôd also hope that they‚Äôd look at people making excessive complaints as well. 
---
You online?
---
I'm willing to buy atoms if there's something I want in the shop.
---
So far I have bought the few bits and pieces I want and still have 4k atoms left over.
---
I always log into the Emergency Services in Watoga during my vendor runs.  Filled with random drugs and chems. 
---
And to think I'm still playing after getting my pie from a machine...
---
Hmmm Mine is stable, never have issues like others report.  
---
Oh that‚Äôs right, I don‚Äôt run mods.
---
üòâ
---
Could be a fun Combo with marsupial and/or jet pack with explosive vent power armor
---
got any shielded plans?
---
there is a static plan spawn at the archery range at the pioneer scout camp.  its probably not the answer you want but it opens you up to crafting one.  thats the only static spawn i know for it
---
Many things the game needs,but a freaking stash between characters !!
---
This is dumb af. 
---
What a smart funny and unique post 
---
Happy Cake Day 
---
I usually get the daily from biv after interacting with him 4-5 times, so its sure is scatchy
---
Cant w8 till they will divide pvp from pve permanently. 
---
I cant understand why to bug some one that obviously whants to be left in piece. 
---
Even if some one is a pvp player isnt much more fun and challanging to actually fight some one who is prepared and whants pvp as well? Unless maybe bullying is in them nature and they know they dont have a chance with one as strong as them.
---
, .
---
I've got a 3* legendary one if you wanna buy it I'm on ps4.
---
Only looking for 1500 caps 
---
?
---
Have you tried selling or buying something to/from a vendor? It might just be a visual glitch.
---
If it hasn‚Äôt been back in by now I‚Äôm kinda wondering if it‚Äôs not gonna be back in and that all the other items that were sold might not either unless has anything else that released re surfaced yet? It‚Äôd be nice to be able to craft it for others as a way to help those that didn‚Äôt get it out and to make a small market for those that have it to get alittle caps
---
Hahaha, well I did have one that I got on the first try.  
---
But I accidentally, unceremoniously arte it when clearing out stuff.....  I intended to gift it to a friend üòÖ
---
Yeah, GT is Tapewyrm0 
---
Why would any griefer bother with picking those locks? And what was the point of locking those doors anyway, if your base was to be public? I mean, what could griefer do anything else in your base than none griefer? 
---
I'm just as the shop, let me go home and check how many caps I got and I'll reply to you again if I've got it :) 
---
gonna go Darrel in the wasteland, Eh?
---
Ill craft/drop ya a legendary if youre on PC. have a lvl 35 &amp;45 AntiArmor, and a 45 TwoShot.
---
I‚Äôm going to be honest. I give everyone still playing props. I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre sticking through this game. 
---
Gotta be honest, I'd appreciate it if they actually put this in the patch notes. They've missed out stuff before that turned out to be huge nerfs and pissed off a lot of people. I appreciate this is literally stairs, but it seems to set a bad precedent.
---
Hater!
---
I must be dumb... you just want to run a single wire from a generator on the outside of a 3x3 building, directly through the building to a powered object on the other side? There are a lot of ways to do this... the problem is conduit lengths aren't exact or?
---
Whoops! First try? Maybe you should play the lottery. 
---
I'm sorry that I believe that donating money to a multi billion dollar company is pretty fucking stupid.
---
So back to playing the sims
---
They will ask you to submit video or photo edivence after the fact you already put in a ticket.
---
So everyone will report expecting a solution and weeks later Bethesda will come to people and ask them to submit evidence of this or else his is no proof.
---
So you will report, wait a month get a response, be asked to submit evidence by which most people will not of saved the evidence as it's over a month since report.
---
Therefore Bethesda won't do anything and tickets will be binned. Not a great solution needs an option to submit video/photo evidence when reporting as this process will be fast forwarded by so many factors
---
I launched a nuke at the capital building I think it's called?
---
My friend had a base there so I wanted to troll them... but ya lots of quests in the area. Felt like a dick afterwards. 
---
Also.... no good enemies lol.
---
as of right now only events drop BOS
---
Lolz.. 
---
you and I agree, you should be sorry. Go take your game hate to anthem.
---
 ï ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î 
---
We already payed 60 dollars for the game not exactly free riding
---
They are legit. Reasonably cheap, very reliable and they have an excellent customer support. Humble and GMG are my #1 source for game keys.
---
I know what you mean but I don't see how it would be different than fallout3 or New Vegas there was some clipping but nothing crazy, I imagine something like no holstering in PA, and with regular armour it could change position depending on the armour type (robot torso the weapon could be on its side), the game destiny manages do pull it off quite well for instance and it has a much greater variety of costumes and armour. The vanishing weapon is the main immersion breaker for me that's why I'm always advocating for it hahah :) I can live with a little clipping, there's loads happening in the game right now hahah
---
I use them frequently. They‚Äôre legit
---
If you go to a movie, you will spend $5/hour for content.  A big game is similar in scale and expense.  So you broke even after 12 perfect hours of play (perhaps 60 game hours given the state of initial release).  After that it‚Äôs just gravy.  
---
So I learned my lesson today after setting up shop and inviting players on the server. Don't make turrets. Again, if you are going to be selling junk do not have them out. I had a dude walk up with a Fatman, blast my shop and when my turrets activated he nuked me and snatched up probably 8,000 caps worth of junk. Being in pacifist mode meant I had no time to react, fun times. 
---
The real problem is that if someone harassed or insulted you, there's no proof.
---
I don't think that they have enough manpower to start all these investigations, and actually have a way to verify the reports.
---
Gimme ten.
---
Alternatively, just go to dome 7 and check if its open, or if it opens regardless. I gave up the keys and all since 3 times i got stuck.
---
First time i didnt see the 3 sec message next to card 2 and the door closed while i looted a safe, doh.
---
2nd and 3rd time i generated a key, traveled, made sure nobody else was at ingram mansion, and both times it denied the code. I wrote them down both times.
---
After that i said fuck it, plopped my free camp since i got booted from solomon pond as a no build zone (potential new stuff there?) Right in front of dome 7, server hopped, somehow opened the door without the key (all hail godd howards bugs) and got the plans after 2 hours.
---
It made it a fun experience and story
---
Boo no the miner gauntlet is what saves my ass  at my noobish low level.
---
I smell a workshop involved in this.
---
Nothing beats excavator carry weight, im not bothered about resistances.
---
Chinese spy planning to sabatage the BOS objective at Fort Defiance. 
---
My and my friends camp is in whitesprings, and we had an issue yesterday where this full team had all rises and MIRVS and repeatedly blowing everything up. Myself and my friend kept on killing them until they gave up. (Bare in mind we started non of this, we were just building the new brewing stations) but as we finally fixed everything they wrecked (the entire building) they returned and wouldn't leave us alone. I went from 6000 caps to 250 caps. We had to change server, but they kept on following us. This had never happened before 
---
It can be hard enough for a lot of adults to schedule time to spend with their irl friends between work/education/family so while of course it would be ideal for people to come together this way it‚Äôs easier said then done. Some players are pretty casual &amp; want to pop on to play for a bit without having to rouse an entire 25 man army. I don‚Äôt think this is people with poor imagination but rather limited time &amp; focus.
---
This guy gets it
---
Idk I have class freak on with speed demon but it feels like it‚Äôs normal speed but when I have a new character I feel like theirs drops the same speed as my character with speed demon on.
---
I'm imagining the ground ripping open and Graham clawing his way into the world 
---
I found the chest plans at camp venture or whatever its called.  And that was after they stopped appearing as randoms at the vendor.  However, ive been trying to find leg or arms plans since time began.....no luck for me. 
---
A bit late responding but:
---
The first time, it doesn't trigger until you are close to the water treatment plant. After you've done it once and it becomes a "daily", it will trigger when you load into The Forrest. 
---
They said they increased the size of some areas that cannot be built on so my guess is where you had your camp is an area that can no longer be built on. 
---
I want to spawn on top of you. Where's the farming location? 
---
Wut
---
Yeah, lazy people. They don't realize that it would take them less time to do it themselves instead of trying to steal it from other. 
---
It took me literally half an hour to get everything and the plans.
---
Talk to Biv, he gives a daily challenge that has a chance of giving you one of the new drink recipes to craft for the quest (another quest is to drink a specific beverage and complete a task while drunk, which I don't believe rewards you with a new recipe)
---
Nice that they fixed that. But they didn‚Äôt fix the giant nuka bottle at the nuke plant lol
---
Yeah it's pretty easy and took me an hour cause I stupidly was not making sure no one had been through to get the keys was gonna get 3 plans so my buds didn't have to deal with all this but servers seem tapped on xbox rn üòÜ
---
Unmarked questline.

this is now a 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 tile west-east conduit passing. the schema is always the same, because all conduits come in 3 different lenght:
---
A = 1/3 of C
---
B = 2/3 of C
---
C = exactly the size of a foundation
---
regarding the placement. i've done this on PC which is actually worse to put then on console, because on console you have some allignment buttons which are not available on PC.
---
When you left vegetables in your stash before the patch they would spoil? When I did that the condition bar disappeared and I could store them in there for a long time I thought that was normal till this patch now when I place vegetables in my stash they spoil but I still have vegetables in my stash from before the patch that still don‚Äôt have a spoil timer on them.
---
T60 brothers
---
Thanks for the quick reply! I'll get cracking on with the events. 
---
That's where I met him last night! He was crossing the bridge and singing 
---
Well, if you go to the website and open a ticket to report a player, you'll get the option to submit some kind of evidence.
---
But if you report someone in game with the social menu there's nothing else to do...
---
When I reported someone with the new system, I only got an E-mail in SPANISH (I'm Italian) that was suggesting me to block the player.
---
Ah I thought they might have stopped appearing at the venders. Thanks for the info!
---
Over some aluminum and wood? Yet you made a ticket and reported people. It's a online game ffs reporting people for this stuff is pathetic.  
---
 I totally agree, still haven‚Äôt done that for 76 cos I‚Äôm waiting the right moment, but I definitely did for Fallout Shelter. For me it was a great game, and it was free. So I decided to support Bethesda by buying from the store. I enjoyed that game so much and I thought they deserved it.
---
It will definitely be the same thing with 76, and I think a lot more than shelter, cos we have to keep alive the game and the new content. There‚Äôs people working hard to make us have fun, they must be supported, they deserve it.
---
Maybe once in the past month?
---
This was actually something I wrote up as a suggested activity after the technical alpha/ stress test. Yours is much more detailed, and I really like it. I would love to see fishing! 
---
They are going hard in the paint
---
Yeah indeed seems to have popped off as they say 
---
I run solo mainly, i dont mind helping ppl but i just havent really found alot of players to travel with on pc, besides that im constantly looking for a spot to call home and plop a base on
---
This. Also, if you are there to leech and not contribute in anyway, do not brag about it area chat. Did one last night where a lvl 36 and 54 stood on the roof of the shed and literally talked about how they just want to tag everything and get free rewards. A someone who is investing the time and resources to actually fight her, it is mildly infuriating. I would imagine you'd make yourself a prime target for pvp after the loot drops too. 
---
Since they are in irradiated area, maybe have them glow a brightish green. Similar to glowing ones, but would be a little easier to see the difference between.
---
Which is why publishers need to provide special spaces for abnormal and asocial people who do play online computer games. 
---
IRL we have prisons, here they could be called PvP servers.
---
It's like what glowing ones did back in fo4
---
Plants are not a problem, getting hardenned mass to made enough of stable flux, that is a timetaking task.
---
&gt; turrets are going to shoot him too
---
That's the point. If you pick a lock, the owner's turrets just sit there and stare at you. Turrets should open fire on lock pickers. 
---
Holy shit it‚Äôs Wendigo Jesus!
---
They could also add a new location called 'Ricky's Used Shit.' 
---
X01 looks great to me, always did since fallout 2's variant. I love the design of it and when painted right it can be intimidating.
---
You are acting as if the report function was something completely new and unexplored in the gaming industry. Other games (most of them) have implemented it successfully - this will be no different.
---
Pvp? Idk
---
I do... still haven't won anything üòê
---
Yes, it is so strong.
---
I did the same thing.  after nukashine i was like...heres a digital pat on the back
---
This happened to me. I've done it four times now and cant get the keys.  Maddening. 
---
Picking locks should make anyone hostile. When they updated the supply drops to specific users, picking locks to get the drops content makes you wanted.
---
The issue is The turrets. In the past they light up when hostiles enter camp, robots, muties, scorched, rats.
---
I don‚Äôt know why  they‚Äôre not firing anymore. But it‚Äôs frustrating AF.
---
My camp has turrets pointed directly at doors, and they‚Äôve been ineffective.
---
Cool, hope this is intended!
---
You find it in enclave bunker, on a terminal.
---
Oh my God. I can stop jumping into the front door. Bless. 
---
Hello, are you on pc?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs for pvp.
---
Imagine a full set of Assassins cavalier.  It pretty much removes any of the drawbacks of running a melee build.  Just sprint at your target and one-shot with your 3000 damage and that‚Äôs it.
---
Totally.  Imagine 75% dmg reduction for a set, plus the assassins adds, what 8% per?  Add unyielding making your SPECIAL hit up 15 pts per (no end).   Add in nerd rage and other perks, a bloodied weapon. You're a little murdering tank.
---
Dont trust this guy hes clearly a cop
---
Idk. it looks ugly.
---
Its cuz you ate the pie...
---
drink it!
---
Double stacking percentage Dr for pvp. Cav for melee / sent for ranged.
---
Thanks, but I‚Äôm on PS4 :)
---
DEE-FENSE! DEE-FENSE!
---
Looks alright if your a fan of blue reminds me of ultra-marines.....what I'd do for 40k skins.
---
Where in Whitespring? If it's a turret camp behind the club house you'll get your camp levelled all the time.
---
Yeh no probs I'm not online atm am away but will be back in town Monday or Tuesday if you give me your psn I'll add you when I get home abd can do a swap üòã
---
Yeh that's not a good way to deal with reports.
---
Asking the victim to just block them lol come on Bethesda
---
Or implement the syringer more and make a round filled with cryo or something that will temporarily make it so they cannot fly. I'm pretty upset about how much the syringer is ignored and can be used for so much more.
---
...The one where i never said they dropped as loot?
---
They're on a pedestal, on the other side of the room from where you type in the code to open the secret door to the pedestal room.
---
So the guy that yoinked it waited for the guy to punch in the code to open the pedestal room and grabbed the keys before the guy that punched in the code.
---
I don‚Äôt put much value in that build because right now for me pvp is such a small part of the game. So why bother.
---
No player shops yet or legendary vending but they should be hear pretty soon :)
---
It's going to all become a very expensive niche purchase once Bethesda makes the pacifist changes.
---
Once that is done, the only pvp you will see will be among those who want to pvp. And the prevelence of these super rare sets (thanks dupers) will make pvp a rich players game. 
---
This has been talked about before but the main reason is because many people don't close the door behind them when they leave.  So a ghoul will be eating your generator when you return lol
---
Asking the Neil questions
---
Maybe it‚Äôll just be a bunch of guys on the pvp severs slapping each other for eternity cause they can do any damage to each other.
---
Free huh? I bet you get a lot of takers. 
---
One of the few well scripted events.
---
I was farming for screws at sugar grove and got a legendary Assaultrons and protectron which I hadn‚Äôt seen before. I wonder if they spread out the density of legendaries. 
---
savage divide treasure maps, rare drop though
---
They reported them for saying that they were ‚Äúgoing to put a hit out on my account‚Äù.  That‚Äôs clearly harassment and it is against TOS. 
---
Well, I play few online games, so I'm inexperiented on this stuff.
---
I know that on console private messages are checked, voice chat too?
---
On Pc you use the Bethesda launcher, there's no Steam or big console company that oversee everything.
---
I also want to know if there's any privacy, if one guy from customer support can hear everything I say (or said) on the game and so on...
---
If reports always need "evidence" from who is reporting, well, they're quite useless.
---
I mean, how many players are always recording and have time to edit a video only to report someone?
---
I'm on xbox but 90% on the time while on a team it keeps flickering the team hud on/off. Been having more game freezes and other weird bugs happen.
---
No D: .Just decided to keep it in the end lol.
---
How do you mean. What's clueless. How about educating instead of insulting 
---
I play solo. Just bought it and I'm really enjoying it. It's had a load of much needed patches and it hasn't bugged out on me...yet.
---
He said nothing before this? Someone was going to rape my mum the other day. I just moved on. 
---
One of my buddies says his jukeboxes interferes and shutdown his radio. Try moving or storing it and see if that helps 
---
When you say "steal it from others" what do you mean?
---
If you're on PlayStation, I'm your guy.
---
Mine didn't play right away it took a little time
---
How about stop telling people how to play the product they paid for, it is so immature to make these demands over and over.
---
Biv is my fucking favorite. I love the atmosphere of the speakeasy as well
---
Thanks a bunch this helps a lot 
---
That would be hilarious. Lol. Max Dr is 99% so they would all be doing 30-50 damage per hit with there multi thousand damage melee.
---
Sorry, I should clarify. I have two characters.
---
Character 1: Placed several radios which "placed" then disappeared. Finally placed a radio somewhere different and it "worked" and stayed there after switching out of build mode. Radio does not work.   
---
Character 2: Placed a jukebox. It worked well. Placed a radio, it did not work, jukebox continued to work. Deleted radio, placed somewhere else, radio didn't work. 
---
So it's possible that on character two that is the case. And I don't need a radio on that setup. It's character 1 where it doesn't work at all. 
---
The system has already been explained by a Community Manager on this subreddit.
---
If someone is reported a number of times, they will assume that there's something going on, and they will look into the reports personally. With all the possible evidence from the reports, and seeing if they describe more or less the same behaviour, they will take a decision.
---
And no, probably they can't hear all you say unless someone is recording you and sending it to them. 
---
As for taking evidence of someone to report him... well, if you care enough about it to report, you should care enough to record a short clip of it, take a picture or whatever.
---
Too late.. :( 
---
Honestly, this is the first I'm seeing about this
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek
---
Middle Mountain Cabins spawns 3 of the same type of creature; I've seen yaoi guai, honeybeasts, and scorpions.
---
Do you have any mods or a custom .ini file
---
thats a real logical and sane jump from one topic to another.
---
Keep changing servers for Watoga is my advice. I had some instances with no legendary enemies there last night before I found a 'golden' server (my own term for it) with &gt;6 legendary protectrons roaming the streets. And don't forget to clear out the EMS building, sometimes up to three legendaries will keep spawning in there. Still, one run of Whitesprings usually drops 20 to 30 pieces of legendary loot for me, and so the LPM (loot per minute) is still best there.
---
Found nice stuff amongst the crap, too, like a max. level Quad Pump Action and a three-star Dragon, and it feels good to just drop the lower level guns and melee weapons in front of unsuspecting newbies, and the ~lvl.10 legendaries into the Overseer's Cache.
---
TL,DR; : What nerf? ;-)
---
I bought the overalls and didn't like the way the looked.  I put in a refund request and they refunded my atoms.  
---
Dope this is huge thanks 
---
If you‚Äôre gonna ask for shields, I‚Äôm gonna ask for dual wield for Miner gauntlets and blades.
---
Is it bad that I automatically checked to see if uranium fever was up on the map...
---
She dropped a 2 star AA Handmade rifle for me when we killed her last night.   I also got two really good ultracite plans.
---
 I'd say that was probly the best drop she's had for me in 20ish kills.
---
I am also looking for PC version. If you find enywhere cheap, please PM. Thank you.

For example, when I finally got to Dome 7 to open the door and take my plans, someone in Chameleon was hiding right by the door, waiting for me to open it. When I did, he sprinted inside to the table with the plans, but I was faster. I can only assume that he then hopped servers to try it with someone else, and that there are others doing the same thing.
---
I did too, since there was a couple things I wanted for my clubhouse. But after I did so I realized I had literally spent $5 on a digital dartboard, when I could have literally bought a real one (cheap one maybe). But that kill laugh love sign was too good to pass up.
---
Hi ! since the VTU jacket and jeans and cap spawn in the frat house, are you willing to sell the cap ? if so, how much ?
---
Yeah, I know üôÑüòìüò´
---
Look under your Aid tab for Vintage Nukashine, not Nukashine. It‚Äôll be toward the bottom. Drink it and you‚Äôll move on. 
---
I did Watoga for a good 45-60 minutes last night. Had probably 10 legendaries in that multi loop run. Had 2 3* in that group. Unfortunately I didn't get any keepers out of the run but that is a separate rng issue.
---
Ok this is getting out of control, how about you people start your own game and leave this up to BETHESDA  
---
I see timers on events all the time. The enclave ones for antennas and the robot protection 
---
Whats the purpose of the page, if you don't mind me asking?
---
Isn't that quest bugged though? They just stand still after the quest is finished when they're supposed to, you know, go on a PARADE, explore the surface, have errands to run.
---
I love doing the quest, but it's a shame nothing comes out of it and how literally no one seems to notice...
---
It might have actually been prioritized for a long time. Game development is complicated and sometimes there is a thousand different things to discuss with other devs, and X affects Y. Making camps harder to destroy increases opportunity for some to grief by locking people in deathtrap/prison camps, for example. There might be a lot of discussion on how to implement this, without breaking that, or inviting problems from something else.
---
Just give it some time. Things might be more complicated than they seem, especially with how ready the internet is to crucify them for even minor mistakes for years
---
I'm closing in on 300 hours and I've always played solo.  I've had one time when someone attacked my camp and I've only had to deal with 2 griefers.  Bethesda has said they are looking into making it so you can turn off all damage from other players to you and your camp.
---
There are some outfits that you can only get by completing events/daily quest. They are very rare.
---
There's a video with more info and some of them showcased: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1av-wwg2\_dc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1av-wwg2_dc)
---
Moved it twice to see if I could replace. Ended up rebuilding. Out some caps, but digs feel fresh.
---
Brilliant! Thank you - it‚Äôs there! 
---
... now for some adventures!! 
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
Until they add a text chat (probably wont)o am going to completely ignore every player I see.
---
I mean, I put them in on patch night, tried them again the next day at lunch, and then tried several times last night. I will of course keep trying, but I have to assume something isn't working 100%
---
That my friend is where the trusty gamma gun actually comes in handy.  You can irradiate them to no end because the 15% reduc doesnt work against radiation 
---
I got one a while back and it seems it was rare then.  I recall several posts where people were trying to find them.  I haven't played since the update so I'm not sure how rare they are now.
---
Thanks DR8.
---
This is the real problem with C.A.M.P. and it's implementation. The system requires a relatively flat piece of land or situated in a geographic area that doesn't affect the game mechanics. So leaving very few locations for the players to design and build their CAMP. Also if Bethesda make any alterations to a map or location, an unintentional consequence is that the C.A.M.P. position could become invalid, as in my case.  
---
Go to the 3\* locked door on the roof. There were 6 quantums in that small area.
---
I actually have a few of these that I haven't done yet. Thanks!
---
PVP isn't going anywhere. I wouldn't get my Hope's up. Just grow a pair.  
---
Maybe you smell? They have very sensitive noses you know.
---
He was floating in the air above the canal. I just turned off the depth and moved so it looked like he was standing on land
---
They know whose on your friends list, the reports all have a tinestamp, and they said the system isn't automated.  It would be really obvious to a human what you and your discord are doing.
---
I haven't seen this myself, but I would *love* to strike a deal with the Golf Club wendigo: I don't kill you, and you can keep reviving the legendary ghouls after I've looted them!
---
Fort defiance is super bugged for me, ghouls on other floors know my location, when they die they teleport back to their spawn location in their sleeping form. Invisible, invincible molerats hurt me through the floor. Headless charred ghouls moonwalks through walls.
---
Idk, wendigos can call on ghouls, but fort defiance is just haunted. It's an asylum, like not an asylum for containing crazy, it's just crazy.
---
Where?
---
I haven‚Äôt done the boot camp quest yet so can‚Äôt get to military wing 
---
Omg thank you OP.  It might be months before I tried that.
---
That is some straight up bullshit.  
---
Are you running a TSE rifle?
---
I placed a huge farm camp right across from Top Of the World/Pleasant Valley Train Station and I see him most times I spawn into a server
---
Why the downvotes?
---
Fort Defiance, in the mirror cabinets.
---
Hmm, I did drink some Nukashine earlier and ended up near there, which is why I went near that fissure in the first place. But uhm... I can't recall what happened in between sitting on my porch watching the night sky with all those pretty colors and waking up somewhere south of Camp McClintock... Maybe in my drunken stupor I ate some garlic? 
---
Sorry to hear that it was great they put them in the game don't understand how Beth didn't know how much we liked the radios should have been there day 1 good luck hope it gets fixed for you
---
There isn't enough content for people to not get bored with the PvE so they do PvP instead.
---
Bump.
---
Cant have all three effects on the same piece. Sentinel and Assassin or Unyielding and Assassin. 
---
Honestly, I'm pretty sure it's situational. Perhaps it has to do with camp budget adjustments, or lights, or electric, or sound settings. I understand these things are complicated, just wanted to draw someone's attention to it. 
---
There always be ppl wanting to profit from others hard work.  
---
This game needs more garlic
---
Much appreciated, devs! I also noticed that at least dead BoS knight in T-51b (the one next to the vertibird in Watoga) had something other than Pre-War money on them (a laser rifle and fusion cells - fitting!)
---
When I swap my rifleman cards in or out, my reported (inventory tooltip) damage still changes appropriately. Are you saying that number isn't changing? 
---
I sold my 3* to the vendors. I listed it for three weeks and no asker's so I sold it for a measly 48 caps 
---
Yes everything should do just 1 damage to make everything equal
---
Just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should,
---
Consider this a teaching moment.  You wasted resources for an event you weren‚Äôt prepared for.
---
Figure out what you did wrong, and why and then change it.
---
I'm not a PVP person either and was really worried when 76 was coming out that it was just going to be hellish for me.  Having been playing it since the Stress Test, through the BETA, and then the full game through today, I have NEVER felt this was a PVP game yet.  Just about the only time I even SEE other players is when I find a strange building and realize it's someone's CAMP and sometimes when doing events (especially when exploring nuked sites).  The maps are huge and currently only allow 24 people max on each server so meeting up with someone feels like a random encounter, not like someone is hunting you down.  Sometimes people will want to PVP, but you can just ignore them or (worst case scenario) leave your current server and log onto another one to hop away from them.
---
I will say that I have heard of people becoming Wanted just to lure the unsuspecting to their doom, but in general, if someone gets a Wanted level, I just ask them if they want me to kill them to remove their wanted level and watch over their paper bag of junk until they respawn and return.  I believe there's some new stuff coming for people who do want to PVP, but Bethesda in the meantime has made sure that 76 is just as fun for the fanbase from the original games to minimize griefing.  And the easiest way to deal with being killed by someone (or even just being killed by creatures) in the game is to just try to swing by your CAMP or a railroad station to drop off stuff in your STASH as often as possible so when you die, you don't lose your junk and have to contemplate whether it's worth it to go back and pick up the stuff you lost.
---
And if you want to hang out with some great casual players, check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals to see how we're all enjoying the game!
---
been checking this a bit, cant see any differences between one or 4-5 chameleon pieces, has it ever been proved or look it to more "scientifically" ? :)
---
Yeah takes a little time to start up, had the same 
---
Ok. So the only saving grace I've ever heard from people about this game is "I get to play fallout with my (friends/spouse/siblings/etc).   
---
That's not why I bought the game and I can honestly say that, no, this game is not single player friendly. I'm not talking about difficulty curve though. Aside from exploring, there's almost nothing to do. There's a handful of quests given out randomly by the system or by a few robot NPCs, but that's it. The lion's share of the game is wandering around and exploring.   
---
Imagine fallout 4 but with every single human/ghoul npc deleted. So it was ONLY the map, and monsters. So the only thing to do was explore and kill stuff. If that's the game you'd like to play then go for it. It's a beautiful map. But it's a map with no soul to it. There are no NPCs or storylines or events that give it life. It's just an abandoned area filled with zombies and feral ghouls.   
---
Combat isn't a saving grace either. Most enemies are ghouls, robots or gun wielding zombies. The big scourchbeast bat dragons are just reskinnned Skyrim dragons except instead of dropping powerful magic, dragon souls, or gold, all they drop are low-level loot like leather armor and pipe pistols.   
---
My advice; skip it if you want a game to play solo.   
---
Maybe turrets are broken? I like taking workshops but 9 times out of 10 any turrets I put up will just sit there not firing at invading mobs. 
---
This one will probably go too. No substance lol 
---
Bump. I drop and loot stuff at luggage in train stations.
---
In the link there's a shot of the map, I'm in the northern reaches of the Ash Heap, west of Belching Betty. 
---
There is just the usual crap
---
Ah man, I don't play the game often enough to check on the marketplace. I wanna get into it though!
---
Ask away friend. My purpose is just to create a community of traders and people to group up on the xbox one. Just a place for people to help each other trade and just general things falloutüòä
---
How did I not think of that, I have the app on my phone as well, cheers mate! 
---
I have triggered the daily for Camden by traveling to lewisburg vendor.
---
I‚Äôve gotten plans for power armor and weapons I didn‚Äôt know how to make yet. Idk. I used to hate messing with them but now all I want is the cranberry bog ones. 
---
Proof would only be necessary for something really egregious which would probably also result in instant action.  As I understand it when you get multiple reports your account gets flagged.  If you're consistantly getting reported from unrelated people its evidence of a pattern of behavior in-game.  
---
savage divide can drop BOS paint so you might wanna dig those (5k+ per plan atm)
---
Yes. My number didnt change. Damage stayed at base damage. 
---
Beware the power armored Mutant Sock!
---
Thank you.
---
No. Not even a legendary. Just one I made. 
---
Ran Wes Tek several times last night and not one legendary. Did get alot of caps and ammo though so it's not a total waist. 
---
Second note. We did kill the queen last night and the loot was total garbage. Not one legendary weapons or anything over a 1* armor. 
---
GMG is my go to site, they often are the first and/or only site for a discount even on Steam games they sometimes have discounts that Steam itself isn't offering.  Just make sure of the region, sometimes the offer is only good for specific regions.
---
Right? Everyone knows dropped items persist until you hit F5.
---
I've just gotten one (no legendary, lvl 45). If you are on PC I can give it to you :)
---
What when I suggested this I got down voted
---
So, so wrong, but feels so good.  Wish there was a way to film the response...
---
The Buddhist temple in the savage divide has a static spawn 
---
Someone commented that all legendary protectrons explode upon death but their comment wasn't displayed. I can say that I killed another one about 5-10 minutes after the first exploded in my face and it did not explode. It seems to be intermittent. Unsure what causes it.
---
They aren‚Äôt going to make new content for free.  
---
I  just found out last night when I updated. 
---
and the old light nocturnal robot right arms
---
Odd? Not sure then. My non legendary lever action does 173.
---
Yes, Glowing Ones can revive nearby corpses, regardless of species.
---
In my opinion the enclave combat armor is the best, it also looks really cool 
---
I used to be such anti griefer, like to a point I would rather hop servers to avoid shit. But recently I‚Äôve been forced to equip other measures. And last night was the last straw.
---
Me and my two buddies, we farm legendaries, drop a nuke or two and then kill the queen. We‚Äôve got pretty good at it. We can do it just the 3 of us.
---
But last night I seen someone picking on someone else after the queen fight. No doubt to get their loot. So I got involved and we killed him. 
---
I left his loot coz I wasn‚Äôt interested. 
---
I didn‚Äôt pay attention if he sought revenge or not. He waited and got me from behind as I was in my Pip-Boy, took my stuff and left. 
---
I was pissed but couldn‚Äôt find him on the map. 
---
Then he came back for my friend aj. 
---
Aj would literally not hurt a fly. He jus does his thing, makes stuff, still can‚Äôt quite figure the perk system or the mechanics of how to have high damage output but who cares, he has lots of fun.
---
And that was the last straw. Coz aj is like a puppy. And just happened to still be carrying a full days worth of junk. 
---
Long story short, we have someone in his friends list track him for us.
---
We‚Äôre gona go level his camp tonight. We may not be able to get aj his loot back. But we will at least make sure that guy has to use it to rebuild his camp.
---
Think what you like. This situation has called for some griefing. 
---
They're fairly easy to see and you can hear them a mile off.
---
I'm on PS4, thanks anyway. And good on you for just offering it! Have a good day :) 
---
Hey man how much would it cost?
---
I have one. It‚Äôs yours ... what platform?
---
Yes. It's part of my stealth commando build
---
Has anyone else tried this? 
---
Thank you for responding! 
---
Usually turrets will engage a wanted to player to nominal effect 
---
How do you get junk from griefing?  Pretty sure killing another player isn't griefing, and destroying a camp doesn't give you junk..
---
‚Äúreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee‚Äù
---
Fatty McGhee, you set off the fire alarm again!
---
Op only had to try 748250 combinations. 
---
I would get this but it doesn‚Äôt look to good. I got the t-51b cola armor very early on and the quantum seems to dark
---
I almost literally never get bothered by PvP players.   
---
It might have something to do with being 100+
---
Turn off any mods, and/or remove your custom ini
---
I worded it terribly. You're right.  
---
there is only a few items that actually matter, everyone would just save all their scorch beast parts, making them always available and easy to collect, making the whole game much easier. 
---
Started running that build couple weeks ago and its been most fun ive had in this game, respecced to max perception commando, ground pounder and tank killer 
---
My CAMP got moved recently too, I was down by the river near the haunted log cabins, yet to check out why!
---
PS4, do you have an account on there? 
---
How about 500c and I will provide the mats and throw in a bright headlamp if you want one. 
---
No problem. Good luck finding it. Cheers!
---
XB1 :( I‚Äôve had a few, this one a got from a forest treasure map. 
---
You can‚Äôt get stuck. Fast travel to 76 is always free.
---
Word , pretty much unplayable 
---
Toxic Valley, Pioneer Scout Camp.   
---
They're not good at all, though. No offense to dude, but I wouldn't pay that many caps for even a 3 star.   
---
They scale with rifle perks. They should be like, the extremely common first starter rifle you get your hand on tbh, not a rare. Because they're just a worse rifle. 
---
Snallygasters are Maryland exclusive
---
Enjoy it while it lasts, soon you‚Äôll be bored when you can kill almost everything with one hit
---
From the Terminals in the Enclave Military Wing. It's called the Remote Lab 1.2
---
Self loathing and determination. At least that is how I do it. That game has improved quite a bit and good people make it very worthwhile.
---
I agree, I dont really see what pvp does in this game. Sure if you want to take part you should, but for me not being able to turn it off completely is very strange when everyone in the wasteland is almost like family, close friends at least. Being in the vault with each other for years so going straight to killing each other seems weird.
---
Yes please that‚Äôs a very good deal, are u on Xbox?
---
I'd probably ruin your day if I told you there was a spot where a perfectly preserved pie spawned in the world.
---
I'm confused too
---
I made a new char, cos I haven't played in a very long time, so far, I've been attacked by 100+ people who offer me stuff, only to try and trap in a cell and kill me through the bars. I've been experiencing a lot of people who have rooms in their houses made for trapping and killing other players. there was even one guy who had this shop sign on his house, with what I think was a make shift trading post
---
To be fair most mo games don‚Äôt have as many friendly players. When you‚Äôve been playing gta online it takes time to get rid of the instinct to stay away and not trust anyone who is approaching you. 
---
I am actually. GT is Captain Itis. I can hop on now if you're available
---
It is a LOT more stable now.  And most of the material bugs have been squashed (although each new patch breeds a few new ones to iron out).  The new content is thoughtful, clever and well-executed.   IMO they‚Äôve saved the game.  
---
I wish they wouldn't try and attack people, it ruins the game when they just hunt people for no reason
---
It's a rad revival up in here.
---
That's good to hear. Is it more enjoyable to play aswell tho? Are the quests interresting? Or do you still have the feeling like you're just walking around aimlessly?
---
Google good spots for the materials to craft your own ammo.  
---
Do events for stimpacks.  
---
I regularly end up with 45+ stimpacks without knowing where they came from. 
---
Speaking of the Sheepsquatch, I had a notification when a workshop got taken over, that is was Sheepsquatch that were there. But the UI said scorched instead. Wasn't able to check it out as just before yesterday's hotfix.
---
This is promising. Thank you for commenting this.
---
I believe that's an occasional reward from back on the beat.
---
So what you're saying is, I should pop off a Mini Nuke at the entrance to see if anyone reacts?
---
I set my base on a ship so i dont care
---
This complaint is overtired, you bought an MMO yet feel the right to not be attacked because you 'don't want it'. Don't worry, they'll give you invincible friendship mode soon enough. 
---
Don't trade, problem solved. I'm 56, traded exactly 0 times and got attacked once by some 150+ stealth asshole when I was defending workshop and didn't notice it being claimed.
---
We don't need more nerfs. They need to buff the weak stuff.
---
I don't see any issues with my rifleman build. I have a crafted level 30 hardened hunting rifle with base damage 75. If I equip Rifleman 3 and Expert Rifleman 3, I get 105 damage (I'm only level 34 with this character).
---
What I would do is stash the guns, remove the perks, logout, login, pick up guns, pick perks again.
---
[Save Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148) is basically the same mod, just being updated for the more recent versions of the game.
---
I don't really fuck with other peoples camps. Or other people.   
---
I'll jump to their workshops when there's a defend it event going on, offer them a party and help defend it regardless and then I'll go on about my day.  
---
I really don't find the issues other people do. Any time someone has tried to PvP me, I've blown through their power armor and kill them.   
---
Got enforcer now, running shotguns. If someone runs at me with melee, I'll probably just keep crippling their legs. It'd be much more rewarding to have them spam all of their stimpacks to un cripple themselves than it would to just kill em.   
---
But if someone doesn't come at me, I don't do shit to them. 
---
Then go ahead and leave server and come back. You'll come back to a heavily irradiated house where you either need your hazmat suit, pa, or a ton of drugs. A perk card shuffle maybe. Even better, maybe you left your server unprepared and repeatedly spawn at your house taking 70 rads.
---
The point is theres ways to grief them back.
---
Man, I was just there looking for the regular T-51b NC paint, the door was open, and this was on the table instead. I don‚Äôt know whether to be ecstatic or disappointed. 
---
Thank you for the info.
---
But how can I record a clip if that already happened? I'm obviously not recording my entire playtime.
---
Most people won't have evidence, so the reports will be pretty useless...
---
What platform are you on? damage has been really hit or miss for me since this last patch. I run an instigating hunting rifle that used to one shot lvl 68 scorched and I had it doing less than 20% at times after the new patch. The damage seems to be pretty bugged. I couldn't one shot lvl 21 mole rats for a while. My damage was bouncing from mid 90s to 140s with 4 points in rifle cards.
---
What he said
---
I've had to rebuy items I didn't wish to sell many times.... This is a good idea. 
---
I had to gutsy just blow up and vanished. No loot. 
---
Tattoo parlour is not open yet but you need to go in through the back door. 
---
Xbox 
---
Yes I‚Äôm on atm 
---
It's not just scorch beasts.  There's been a noticeable uptick in what my group calls "greased up deaf guy ai."
---
You'll be fighting scorched or ghouls and a three star legendary will spawn and the moment you look at it it'll book it.  It's obviously intended too because they don't run randomly, they specifically pull you through other mob spawns...even targeting hostile mobs and YOLOing past them at Max speed. 
---
Np
---
Griefing how exactly? Because PvP isn‚Äôt it.
---
Anyone else have issues with scopes completely being unusable? Log in, press RMB, nothing happens, press alt f4 and queue up Netflix.
---
I'm talking about the back door, was fine yesterday, but today it wouldn't let me enter.
---
Did the same thing at my camp, I jump up on the bar and drop random drinks so that the paper bag looks like it's been served. I'll leave random drinks up there if people come by while I'm away.
---
Where's the starting point for the quest? I'd like to do this with my pals today
---
The map has zones. The forest is the beginner area, then toxic valley up north, getting harder then is the savage divide, and ash heap to the south. Finally the cranberry bog around watoga, and the eastern swamps. Also any area a high lvl player has gone through will have higher scaled enemies.
---
I wish fallout as a company would embrace the modding community instead of acting like they don't exist for a year then stealing their code. I know many of the devs most likely praise the modder fixes to no avail with the upper management. 
---
I finally met him last night, been playing since B.E.T.A. His selection was underwhelming. I milked Chally.  It felt weird. 
---
that you didnt list, 
---
1. lead champagne mimosa, + fall speed, - rad damage
---
2.fermentable mountian honey moonshine (not sure of effect i havent made it yet)
---
Theres a guide on youtube I suggest looking it up and I wouldn't get your hopes up on getting it atm the plan is hard to come by atm as its one per server.
---
Sneak is your friend. Sneak seems to be the only way I can play Fallout 76 in solo mode. When you sneak you don't show up on the map.
---
I started noticing players floating around the Whitespring waiting for players to show up and generate respawns so they can steal your spawns. The answer?......you guessed it sneak. 
---
A good number of my PVPs have been mutual with roughly even deaths on both sides followed by a spontaneous ceasefire with thumbs up and waves before parting. By 'abuse' do you mean 'participated in as designed'?
---
If you play on Xbox you can download the Xbox app sign into your profile then you can download your pics straight off your profile I think you can do the same if you have the PS app not sure though.  
---
I've learned that alcohol is a solution.
---
If you shoot them in the legs, there's a big chance they will not explode. It worked for me on my last run around Watoga. 
---
Oh dang, thanks for that last part. I'll just get the plan and hand it off to my friend who uses power armor, she'll put it to better use than me
---
I‚Äôve always wondered whether there was a crowd control mechanism - day more than 12 people in a closed-in cell, so no one else can get in until someone else leaves...
---
if this game is too easy for you while you run around in the best equipment possible, then maybe change your equipment.
---
have you tried solo the SBQ with an unmodified level 1 pipe pistol?
---
no?
---
so, then lets go.
---
Try hopping servers. Fixed it for me.
---
Basicly what I did but got lucky on another run GL!
---
Awesome thanks.
---
What about missile turrets?
---
Nah, they can just deal massive damage especially with strength and anti-armor perks. They also benefit from unarmed buffs.
---
Or at the prime fissure site lol/Glassed caverns
---
Melee is more efficient with perks and special, since strength is really the main special tree. With guns you generally need to invest in multiple trees to get the same benefits. 
---
Getting the plans just requires server hopping..getting the keys is the worst part because once you use your keycards they are gone and you need to get a new set and a new code.
---
Weirder still, Grahm mentions Chally is a HE! 
---
Plan: T-60 BOS Knight CPT Paint.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ZGzdHmb](https://imgur.com/a/ZGzdHmb)
---
I have yet to receive a 2nd T-60 BOS Knight.
---
A lot of server hopping and luck to be more specific.
---
Built around a junk pile! Tame some cats and put em next door, sell 10k of vodka from time to time...
---
Just place some punji boards around your generator. This will keep ya generator intact but obviously they then chew though ya walls and stuff. 
---
My gatling was nerfed badly in the patch. Not even worth using. It seems like something unintended happened.
---
If I'm not online just msg me here or on XBOX and ill get back to you ASAP
---
I am on Xbox1. 
---
+1 for the use of "YOLOing"
---
You can get the plans for the regular body parts from Taggerdy's terminal in Fort Defiance.
---
I dont play any more... but a friend does, so I logged in and gave him all 8 of my nuka quantums, then killed a mole rat, and logged off for likely the last time.
---
Thanks. I will try that
---
True, but it is annoying to have to walk back to Morgantown and coupled with having extremely low health due to rad damage, until you find Radaway, you'd need to either purposefully die a few more times or be careful to avoid mobs.  
---
Only child who's never seen a group of bored teens? Absolutely normal behavior for primates, which we are. 
---
What does that have to do with the PA paint? (Serious question)
---
Thanks I will definitely check that out, appreciate it.
---
What build do you have to get 170?  Best I have been able to get is 140

When you fast travel to mountainside bed and breakfast you go to the train tracks on the left and follow the train tracks the exact direction you were looking when you fast travelled.

You run down it about 10-20 seconds and you will see some overturned carts next to a radio tower/power pylon (something large like that anyways) and in a 50m radius around the train carts it will 100% spawn 2 bears giving you around an average of 11 acid per hop plus you get about the same amount of springs as well.

I‚Äôve been running challenges for my atoms up to this point, buying things mostly on sale or if I ‚Äòneeded‚Äô it (Hotrod x-01? Take my atoms). 
---
After the latest patch I‚Äôm definitely ready to open my wallet again. The Power Armour edition burned me, but it‚Äôs healing again. 
---
The more Nuka Cola themed atom shop items they drop, the more I‚Äôm gonna end up spending. 
---
Well,  better to roll out and hotfix stupid shit like nukashine and parades than fix some of the (remaining) major glitches like scrapping bulk junk, allowing dupes to still exist, I could go on and on.  Kudos to Bethesda for addressing some of the concerns but close the damn loop already before introducing new items or features. 
---
What do you think raiders do?
---
You got down voted by a griefer. Personally, I like you. I wanna go full SAW with my main character after dealing with griefers nonstop lately.
---
Just log out. If someone is dicking around with you just leave. I've had plenty of people mess with me after I was well over lvl 100. A lot of people are bored and looking for something new. If someone starts destroying your base or repeatedly doing slap damage leave. I am at lvl 210 now and there is rarely a point in pvp unless you have a build ready for it.
---
I still cant explain why I was just walking through Watoga, not fighting anything, and just instantly died to a player wearing a fasnacht mask while I was in pacifist mode. something just doesnt seem right. Pvp was never initiated, was never taking any damage, I never shot him, I didnt even know he was there until I just randomly dropped dead.
---
I would argue that melee is where it is supposed to be...so they should have legendary ranged weapons that can compete. What if there was a weapon that could shoot two bullets at once or explode? Oh, wait. They did that, had parity between ranged and melee, then nerfed it so ranged sucks now unless you go sniper.
---
Yes---I'm still salty. Might as well go back to Age of Conan if all I can do is melee anyway.
---
Done ranting. Sorry.
---
This doesn't work here. We already have rigid rules of engagement; you want an RSVP before getting aggro? 
---
"Lalalalalalalalal I can't hear you"üòÖ
---
Use that trick to make walls from concrete foundations. They are un-destroyable. The big problem is that monster will spawn inside and those concrete foundations will likely take at least half your budget. 
---
Agreed üëç
---
This needs to happen with general QoL improvements for crafting. 
---
Sliders for creating more than one.
---
Returning items to stacks now that the duping loophole has been fixed. 
---
Showing what can still be unlocked by scrapping/plans
---
im with you! love building in 76
---
I'd try hopping servers if you notice a big damage disparity. Servers seem to be really hit or miss at times and if your main build isn't doing what it should it's worth hopping to something else. 
---
If you are high level and own a workshop, teams of people will come kill you for the caps. One will wait at the workshop and the others will find you, no matter where you are, and line up their VATS crits. As soon they are ready, the 1 person at the workshop initiates the contesting and the others open fire on you.
---
No warning, no chance to leave the server, just instant death.
---
PVP in this game is broken. If you haven't had issues with it, that is only because you are too low of a level to be worth it to the PVP exploiters.
---
I'm a data monkey. 
---
Also built some other tools.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hgL2TUetOLtVIpsEH8HSKXbZtavKZqs-xgWBXQLLdg4/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
That didn‚Äôt last long
---
Talking about the BoS paint thats been in the game or a new one?
---
Only one limited item has returned to the shop and that was the mothman photo frame during mothman week.
---
What didn't last long?
---
Just did this, it worked but I used the plan and it doesn't seem to have unlocked any Underarmour. 
---
It's new I also have Knight cpt SGT and Officer which makes the arms Orange it looks awesome. I just got paladin now and want to see what it looks like 
---
It is not uncommon for a quest to fail to register upon login.
---
Fortunately logging out and in again fixes it.
---
This^^
---
 I have my character as my Xbox profile pic too üëç
---
Hahaha, that would be nice to see! Just be aware that there might be someone trying to steal the plans from you, that's all.
---
Probably because Bethesda banned thousands of players all at once without investigating any of them and just using an unfair automated system so people are sketched out about taking anything from other players. 
---
Enclave bunker seems to be the main source of it. Are you not to that point in the quest or trying to get it on a low level character?
---
The link to your group.  You can‚Äôt post that self-advertising stuff here.  Personally I think you should.  But oh well
---
Able to get a screen shot of um? Color me interested but sceptical.
---
Sugar Grove is another good place for it.
---
I don't know how it works on PC, but on PS4 when you hit the record buttong, it saves the 15 previous minutes.
---
I rest my case your honor.
---
Uh okay
---
I can‚Äôt find 50 bottles of alcohol to consume in one day and if I did, I think my blood alcohol level would be a solid .30 and I would have just embalmed myself 
---
Asking the feel questions!
---
I'm genuinely curious myself.
---
I think all the comment's from people to you saying things like you cheated and good riddance and stuff like that are pretty shitty.like these people have soooo much blind faith in Bethesda lol I've seen people who actually duped get off Scott free their systems have flaws guys,hate to break it to you
---
I‚Äôm very high level. Like level 139. I‚Äôm just getting bored server hopping and then fast traveling and then server hopping and fast traveling......... you get what I mean.
---
As far as i can see there's no rules on unless i'm incorrect.
---
When I first started out I build camps in the different regions as I discovered them. So I can do all the things I wanted to in the area, quests and whatnot, and then move to the next region. So that I can always come back if I ever go anywhere else and finish the main quests in that region. I finally settled in cranberry bog, which contains most of the endgame content.
---
Sorry, I don't understand. It's bullshit the fact that he was waiting there, or you think that I'm making this up?
---
I'm not a native English speaker, so I don't know what you mean here.
---
Why do you think it got removed? lol
---
It‚Äôs a no no
---
Where is that located and how much TC do you usually get?
---
we've clearly become too lazy as gamers when we can't be arsed to push the jump button once in a while.
---
Seconded
---
Not spreading lies. Stop trying to accuse everyone of lying just because you didn‚Äôt have the problem yet. Iam an unyelding build, do i have not much hp anyways, and that one time i got killed it was someone with a really fast op combat knife. Got killed while I was trying to get into the main menu... 
---
I am a mostly solo player and I‚Äôm about 200 hours in. I‚Äôve had one or two meh experiences, but mostly you meet people at events and check out each other‚Äôs camp and play together for an hour or two. 
---
It's not been removed thoughüòÇ 
---
The nuclear option is best for workshops. If you nuke a camp all ot takes to repair is 40ish caps. Just replace the camp and the whole thing is saved as a blueprint and repaired.
---
Gotta get AJ to scrap-n-stash, Big Dog. Good luck on the juicy raid (which ain't griefing btw). 
---
Are you on Xbox? I can show you cpt sgt and Officer in a screenshot 
---
Your link was removed.  Deleted.  Whatever
---
Yeah shoot me a msg gt Lanxmixpunk
---
His stash is full üôà lol he cannot go past a piece of junk without ‚Äúneeding‚Äù it lol
---
Sounds like a good come up on caps
---
Mine play but it‚Äôs so incredibly quite that you can‚Äôt even hear it, and that‚Äôs IF the game music ISNT playing over it. They need to fix it 
---
It‚Äôs the shielded lining mod for enclave under armor. You will need to buy the under armor and craft all the previous lining mods before you can make it shielded. The suit and previous mods are available at enclave military wing vendor
---
They actually added some other stuff to without notification....my base was in the Mire built around a tree that had a limb with no branches....after patch released limb had branches protruding thru my camp walls...spent 4 hours yesterday rebuilding
---
Well guess i'll be unfollowing this subreddit if they're going to be dicks about it. What platform you on?
---
What specifically about cranberry bog ones are good?
---
I haven‚Äôt had a chance to play since the recent patch. Planning to play a bunch tomorrow. If you are on PC I will give you 500 caps for each of those, always can use more.
---
Fuck em up
---
But but that's "griefing" lol
---
I have keypads and i got a ‚Äúcamp under attack message‚Äù came back to find a giant circle hole where the doors were and just the brick! ha.  
---
  my sugestion is just try to keep a bit of an eye on your base, dont just forget it while you are out. If its under attack, go to menu as quick as possible. get players name (optional) incase u want to get revenge or watch for him/them following you. immediately go under your name on right menu and leave world.  If you want to minimize damage to important things like rad shower ect. this is the best thing you can do. when you log back into a server then fast travel to assess the damage. go to your camp box and ‚Äúrepair all‚Äù. If you try to fast travel to engage you are just giving them all your loading screen time to break more of your stuff!
---
Not as bad as a level 10 mission sending you to fight a level 30+ wendigo 
---
I‚Äôll give it a try rn, thinking about it that‚Äôs probably the problem with me üòÇ
---
Yes that's the only downside to this technique. Rad x helps increase immunities, but supress mutations. Theres a serperate perk to reduce the chance of getting disease from water but it doesn't seem worth the investment to me as I am a low endurance class. 
---
Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to pay for more music licenses. Hell they‚Äôve been so cheap that they been using Butcher Pete since Fallout 3 and that song is terrible 
---
I‚Äôm actually looking forward to survival mode. Stuff like this will be actually harder to do because people aren‚Äôt visible on the map by default. I‚Äôm not mad that you are playing a raider. I am happy actually. But pvp has too many weird kinks right now for me to partake too much in. 
---
Why do you keep saying it like that Bubbles? They don‚Äôt exist.
---
Depends on why your killing me
---
You're totally right, my bad. I misread it. Thank you! 
---
I died from this yesterday 
---
As you can read from many true fallout fans on here, you and me are lying. It isn‚Äôt possible to deal so much damage! We are clearly lying just to get attention... Srsl, what is the deal with these guys. It is still possible. But yeah, with all the perk cards and a bloodied DC gauntlet you can deal extreme damage. 
---
thx this will help a lot!
---
Uh... wow.  
---
Look, self promotion isn‚Äôt allowed and they always remove the links. 
---
Have you even spent time on this subreddit? You‚Äôve got an account less than 30 days old.  I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd miss you much if you scooted along. 
---
Byyyyeeeeeeeee
---
I just had someone come in where i was and randomly attack saying i attacked and killed him last week but I dont pvp and I haven't been one in two weeks and he was  Relentless. Like he popped out of nowhere. I have not been attacked lime that since the game first came out and he learned his lesson not to do that. That annoying and he was waiting at my camp and destroying stuff like why.
---
Oh yes, thanks 
---
Those are future dlc locations which was changed in Patch 7.
---
Keypad wouldn't work when I tried it last night. Thinking about just buying it.
---
I usually take everything and leave 1 Salt. When I'm safe I'm dropping that 500 wood scrap in a bush.
---
Strange hmmm.
---
Or both ... rogue rogues.... or maybe some rogue rouge?
---
I want this so bad to stomp around with in power armor. 
---
I wholeheartedly agree, this is needed, I don't only drink whisky in the game.
---
Yup I noticed this last night as well. Was at Whitesprings all by myself and spotted a legendary glowing deathclaw between the main resort and the northern buildings.  Shot at it with my auto grenade launcher and did about 30‚Ä∞ damage and it just booked it! By the time I got it to stop running and engage me we were past the tennis courts and on the fairway!! Of course the golf club ghouls and wendigo joined the party at that point :) weird that they run like that! 
---
Ya was playing with a friend last week who is only level 10 and he wanted to explore the cranberry bog. I took through big bend tunnel and on the other side a level 120 wanted to fight us. I did it because I have been working on a really good melee build and I killed him
---
High Voltage Hefe: +15% energy weapon damage and durability loss
---
Hoppy Hunter IPA: +10%(I think) damage to animals, better scoped aiming, minus vats hit chance 
---
What system you play on Mary? Revenge is one of my favorite flavors.
---
I‚Äôm so down lol
---
I have burnt through hundreds of those in all regions, not once I 'dug out' a legendary item.
---
However I did obtain all the T-51b, T-60 and Raider PA part plans among other goodies.
---
This was before one could just walk to a vendor and buy them so it was a rather joyful find.
---
The real boon for me however was the inordinate amount of mods I unlocked 'for free' just by means of scrapping weapons/armour unearthed from those mounds. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for survival! And a good challenge üí™ I‚Äôm hardcore BoS to the bone, and I‚Äôll wipe you filthy raider scum from the wastes (all in good fun of course üëçüòÇ) 
---
You can only grab one piece at a time so not matter where you go it's the same. Most repeatable quests are fairly redundant and don't offer substantial rewards. 
---
The fact that they released a game and went this long without report functionality or any type of GM or ability to reset quests or restore in-game items tells me that they are clueless when it comes to building or running an MMO.
---
I hope the report function gets abused. They released a broken game, took everyones money, took no action to fix the game for the first 90 days after it was released, then made horrible decisions trying to fix it.
---
At this point the game is at the bare minimum quality for release. And it has been 5 months.
---
I will report every player that looks at me sideways. I will claim that anyone PvPing was mic spamming the n-word. I don't give a fuck. I will re-report every day I don't get a response on my initial reports.  This team had no business making an MMO and they need to learn that one way or another.
---
You can get the frat party poster free in the atom shop to put anywhere. It also starts the quest. 
---
From what I‚Äôve seen, the forest will probably give you loot like pipe weapons and stuff like that. I‚Äôve gotten a map for cranberry bog and learned how to craft some power armor pieces. Idk. Just feel like the cranberry ones are better, in my opinion..

The codes are server and player specific. You have to get a new code every time you enter a new server. Try getting a new code and then that door and see if it opens 
---
Considering this a new account i've been on reddit alot longer. But nowhere do they state you can't advertise a group. Maybe the tryhards should actually state that in their rules rather than be complete dickheads about it. Looks like you're just as bad as them byyyyeeee tryhard
---
Well, I would love to laugh too, but really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs so funny about it. Isn‚Äôt this the common name of the place where you fight the queen? Lol... I swear I read that many times. Btw: English isn‚Äôt my first language, in my language it‚Äôs called RISS STANDORT PRIME.

Kinda knew it would happen when I got dced the first time I used the key cards. Second time I tried after getting new cards and the keypad wouldn't activate. Only the emergency exit button would work...

I'm on ps4...thanks for the response though
---
Adios

Thanks for stopping bye and showing your true colors and being a true dick.

Its random, go to Big Al‚Äôs Tatoo parlor and talk to Biv.
---
its well-worth the errand, the SPECIAL perks are fantastic
---
I learned tick blood tequila
---
Imo whilst a select few number of quests are fun, most quests you will enjoy will be because of the story. gameplay of the main quest line was extremely boring it's mostly just repetitive fetch quests with the reward being you get to find out more about what happened. 
---
The heart of this game lays within end game content. For me that was trying to get the best gear for my build. Other people it is trying to get all rare cosmetics and plans in the game and others it's just killing the end game boss over and over to get some good loot and plans for mutation serums or mods.
---
The gameplay aside from quests is fun. I've always wanted a multiplayer fallout and when I was playing with my friend (he's a sniper I'm heavy guns tank) it was quite an experience I enjoyed killing enemies and then right when I go for another my friend would just pop his head off from afar.
---
If the end game sounds boring to you then don't worry it will only get better they have a roadmap setup for inclusions of extra content for that.
---
Are quests interesting? Yes. Are they fun? Not a ton. Most quests have you going around doing all this stuff and and trying to do a ton of searching all for npcs that don't exist and you will never find. All you're left with is a holotape and this gets pretty old quickly. What I explained there just spoiled a lot of quests but the thing is you spoil them yourself because you know there isn't any humanoid npcs and these quests lead you on a quest to find them.
---
You don't live in a city, do you? Literally everyone does this. And they probably use the same argument to justify it. I get the point you are trying to make, but you kinda made the opposite point.
---
Sugar Grove is the facility where you get the data for MODUS and the 'technology' for the Voice of Set in the Mistress of Mystery quest line.
---
On a good day 6-7. On a bad one 3-4.
---
It is however on my 'farming route' so is all pretty seamless for me.

We really need this, I already accidentally scrapped a shielded underarmor and sold a Two shot explosive handmade because of this.
---
Also make cannibal synergise with carnivore :)
---

---
Did you own any workshop? People can start claiming your workshop, fast travel to where you're at and kill you there.
---
That use of bullshit was about the guy waiting there. 
---
They stay hostile until you change servers 
---
139 is not a very high level
---
on my way, lol
---
Im just glad with the new mode I can shoot first and ask questions later. None of this "waiting for them to become wanted" bs. 
---
I've never accidentally dropped a weapon i really liked while playing this game intoxicated. That must have been some other guy on my account drunk in a whitesprings nuke zone. I am certainly a fine upstanding citizen that would never participate in such uncivilized activities.
---
I've always interpreted that song as some guy who runs around rapeing women? Is that wrong or ... ?
---
People use Excavator for the extra carry weight (I think it gives +100?)
---
Others might use different PAs for the looks, too. For me, the best is X-01.
---
This. Would love if Bethesda could regularly update the radio 
---
Really? That's lame. Yeah, I did have the ammo factory at that point.
---
Have you tried turning off then turning it on?
---
Butcher Pete is great. You shut your whore mouth!
---
I have the excavator for junk runs, X-01 for everything else.
---
Also have the Ultracite and some Nuka Cola armour but only kept them because I like them and would like to hopefully display them one day üôè
---
Someone found the code for that door - it's 748250 
---
Huh.  In the past, they seemed satisfied with killing me once and letting it go at that.  
---
So I just lost all my junk?  That seems stupid AF.
---
Okay sweet, my gt Is TWEAKD SKWURL I would like to help if you ever need anything 
---
I run a stealth build so I prefer the Excavator for hauling my loot home when the mission is done.
---
No clue why you're being downvoted here. Everything you're saying is absolutely true. 
---
I ran Party Boy for the AP from wine and STR/carry weight from whiskey. Now rad ant lager outclasses whiskey for non-STR builds. I'm considering dropping Party Boy now since I dont think JUST a 45 +AP bonus is worth the perks. Assuming new booze doesn't also outclass wine

4) I cannot access the tinkers workbench (possibly related to my current quest 'flavours of mayhem') or aim down sights in first person
---
It was pretty scummy, yeah... but not totally unexpected. I've seen other players saying that someone waited in the secret room to get the keys of the Dome when someone enters the secret number.
---
Thanks, very nicely done :)
---
Ok thanks
---
I was just looking at dropping a C.A.M.P there  yesterday, glad I decided against it!

Wonder how big the exclusion zone is, does it expand to the pylon behind because hat could be a good alternative location.
---
Please give me ‚ÄúWalking After Midgnight‚Äù

I scrapped a Mr. Fuzzy hat the other night.  It was not a good time.
---
We need this in the worst way.
---
I did my first solo run at level 37 with no real problem. Just take a few stempacks and you‚Äôll be fine
---
Easiest thing to ask for is the vault tec building plans, those walls had build it conduits so no wires or conduits needed to be built to supply power as long as on wall is connected to power and the rest of the walls/floors are connect to that wall. Plus they were neat and clean 
---
you're welcome, have a nice day
---
Idk why I was downvoted, but I was just asking. I didn‚Äôt realize it was patched.
---
SO much this. I wanna set my prices once. not every time i load up a trade.  
---
Also a counter offer option would be nice. Not everyone has/uses in game chat (which is dumb IMO, but hey, what you gonna do?)
---
Same for me. I have no problem for example when someone slaps me one time to see if I want to engage in a pvp or not. Sometimes I did, one time I had a real hunt down in watoga, killed him 3 times, he killed me 4 times, then I called it, hit ‚Äûignore‚Äú and when we saw each other again we gave each other the thumbs up. That‚Äôs absolutely fine.... but these buggers who are following and harassing you and you are forced to change servers, hate that. 
---
Do the keycards stay with you forever? If you have to sever hop, do you have to redo everything?
---
Well no offense but good. Sounds like you‚Äôre one who blocked the Charleston vendor bot from spawning for people. 
---
Platform?
---
Yea sorry man I meant what that guy did was not fair/nice.
---
The problem is now the reward isn't worth the preparation and ammo expended to kill her.
---
thanks
---
Someone has the OCDs I think lol :p
---
It's stupid that they didn't just launch the game with such features.
---
I scrapped my fully tweaked combat rifle last night. Ugh. Terrible.
---
PC!  Sorry. I should have said. 
---
It doesn't, I'm just pointing out that he's not exclusive to Grafton, kinda like the Mothman isn't exclusive to the forest region
---
YES! I normally get really bored of the music on the radio. Would be awesome if they updated it.
---
I saw bases up on the ridge west of the station yesterday. 
---
How much are you charging for the quantum paint?
---
Yep same here, water, beer, steak.  
---
From the hotwheel a few times aswell...
---
Nah man, my bad, I didn't understand.
---
Yeah, it was pretty bad. 
---
What‚Äôs behind the door?
---
Well, I don‚Äôt read each and every new post on this subreddit, only the hot stuff most of the times. Another dude posted a link with exactly one other complaint similar to mine, which was a few days before. But yeah, you‚Äôre idea is great! Because the more complaints there are the more serious they‚Äôre taking this problem. I really don‚Äôt see the point in all this anger towards this topic on here, in general I see this quite a lot, people who are just defending every inch of this game, no matter what. A real downvote army. 
---
Yes.
---
Esp when "you can see I have three ranged weapons ... a quad fire rate gauss, a TSE gauss and an instigating vats gauss ... why would you think I want to sell those?"
---
It all depends on people doing their fair share of damage. I've been early to the fight and, with 2 others, taken her health down by a third of her health 2 minutes.
---
Then other occasions you have a bunch of people hiding in the nearby barn, f*cking it up for everybody by raising her health and doing nothing to help. Shooting her for 5 minutes with no effect? Yeah probably that.
---
Sidenote: melee players! Take a gun for heaven's sake. Use it while you're waiting for her to land.
---
I've played 95% (at a guess) of the game solo. Most players I wave. They wave back. Then that's kind of it.
---
Yes, usually after a workshop takeover that happened prior initiating pvp mode.  This is the missing variable in this equation. Ask yourself, did I own a workshop just prior to being one slapped to death?
---
I‚Äôm bad at Reddit. My tone isn‚Äôt hysterical enough to be a complaint that gets gilded by haters nor filled with arguments for wish fulfillment for the ‚ÄúI love your game but give me everything with no effort‚Äù crowd. Ah well, I didn‚Äôt want votes just an answer. 
---
Take screenshots, email it from pc to yourself, open email on phone and download.
---
I was killed from workshop PVP and I still don't understand. If they wanted to have a system where you can challenge a player for the workshop, why does that mean a player can murder me without warning in my camp miles away from the workshop? If they'd claimed the workshop, I wouldn't have cared. The game needs to explain stuff properly.
---
It's a real thing, folks are paying caps to have people hunted down
---
You‚Äôll want a strong rifle or other gun to take out all the turrets. 
---
What are the special buffs for shielded?
---
Thirdeded
---
This.   I hate when people put their CAMP their.  
---
With a few perks, and a few bottles of booze, you can get an unarmed character doing over 20k damage a swing. It's not a glitch. They broke their own game more :)
---
I either saw the same house (but in whitesprings) or some one else did the same design. It was like a pyramid of concrete. It was built too far away from a high point to see if there was a door on top but I'm assuming that was it (and I think the owner did appear from top at one point).
---
Same,  on PS4 too
---
Seems legit 
---
A lot of people got un banned the other day. Could have something to do with it.
---
Why are you snooping around another players base anyways? Let them build what they want-- if you got trapped by a trapper, it sounds like he knows what he's doing. I don't see anything wrong with trap bases, all of the items are there to do it in the building menu. If someone is unlucky enough to fall into a player made trap once, I don't think he will fall into it a second time. You live, you learn. Maybe you should be a little more careful out there in the wasteland. ü§î 
---
Sorry for your loss, but thrilled for those of us that want to shop the vendor bot.
---
Just wait a week my dude. When it all settles down. Right now it's like opening weekend for the next marvel movie you go every one and the dead ma going and making things awful. Just wait some time it ain't going no where.
---
Just goes to show that the planet will always be inhabited by assholess, even when there's hardly anyone left. Instead of looking out for humanity in general, they'll be the ones harming others for their own enjoyment, not realizing the person they just killed could have helped them survive later. 
---
that sounds like it could work, thanks! :)
---
It takes effort, that‚Äôs for sure. 
---
Run troubleshooters armor. % reduction is far better than high def.   
---
115 resist with 45% reduction takes  about the same damage as 600 def with no % reduction.   
---
EG: run Lone wanderer 3\* and two pieces of %dmg Reduction. Even with crap gear, youll take less damage. (\~91% as much.) Toss on a third %dmgReduction, and your down to 60% of the damage you would've taken with 6x as much defense
---
That‚Äôs debatable but you can‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs at least something new for the X01 and THAT is likely the driving force behind this.
---
Oh.  Im I able to buy TC btw form players or no?
---
They should at least make pacifist mode make an exception for anyone that attacks you. At the very least. Pacifist mode makes you a sitting duck for any griefers and the whole point is to stop griefers.
---
I've scrapped 6 syringers I modded in the last 3 days. I feel your pain. Any chance you are on PC? Be happy to mod one for you.
---
Even better, get some proper bluegrass and some backhills music... most of it's in the public domain (anything written before 1924, for instance!) and you can easily hire a small band for a few hours to churn out a ton. I've considered tapping a few family members to do some of that myself and being, like, "Hey Bethesda! We'll sell you tracks for a buck!" just to mix it up.  
---
At the very least, we need some Woody Guthrie.
---
I have 2 characters both about lvl 90 one is played with a friend and another by myself! I think you should buy it, it's an amazing experience pakying on your own, no stressing though quests and so on! I actually prefer playing ut alone because I can tanke my time to explored The lore :) there are many quests and more is coming this year :) 
---
I found this shack in the Ash Heap (I camp very close by) too and figured that radar thing might be new. Presently a fair number of ghouls and a Wendigo spawn in the pond behind the shack, so be careful if you go exploring. 
---
that sounds handy, unfortunately I'm PC...or, fortunately, depending on who you ask lol..
---
TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN. 
---
If they banned legendaries from survival then it would be infinitely more fair and balanced.
---
Nice! I dig it!
---
Nope
---
That's happened to me before. I got a very brief pop-up saying that I had successfully defended my workshop, then some twat 112 levels above me turned up at my camp and killed me. It's stupid. This shit should've been fixed in beta.
---
Wait... so if I open a workshop I'm open to full damage even when I'm exploring elsewhere in the world?
---
I would love to have multiple ones stored. But no matter how many things I get rid of, I am always near the stash limit.
---
[Stuff.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1qib7/shielded_enclave_underarmor_plan_now_spawning_on/)
---
&gt;Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to pay for more music licenses. Hell they‚Äôve been so cheap that they been using Butcher Pete since Fallout 3 and that song is terrible
---
Agree 1,000%. It's why I always turn off the radios in FO games. 
---
I'd like to see that as well. Gt is l naderade l (with L's)
---
Yes and he will make attking animation's/sounds but do no damage 
---
Thank you for not being sarcastic and/ or insulting as many others who are generally against my statement. I had no workshop claimed and was not in a team at thar time. That time I got killed was with a combat knife, definitely with swing speed. While trying to get into main menu, the game froze for quite the time and I got killed. Since Iam an unyelding build it is still possible with all what you said, which I won‚Äôt doubt! Maybe I should‚Äôve have explained the situation in more detail, because many on here basically accusing me of lying, while I never said I was ‚Äûone slapped/ shot‚Äú. 
---
Glowing ghouls can revive and heal other ghouls with their rad-burst thingie. Seems plausible that other Glowing [Somethings] that has a rad-burst ability would do the same.
---
I am on PC, and I appreciate the offer, but I'm good. I scrapped it at a workbench out on a mission so I was forced to use an assault rifle I had on me, and so now I'm just rolling with that. :)
---
Some one posted and I'm not sure if you saw the comment that apparently if you take a workshop you are open to pvp even when you are not at the workshop (that's really stupid imho but apparently that's what happens). Is it possible you had claimed a workshop at some point in that server?
---
It‚Äôs in the 100‚Äôs..... being over level 100 is high level I. My book. I wouldn‚Äôt say very but it‚Äôs high.
---
I agree, although maybe they went insane when they found out that we're all immortal, teleporting coma patients who keep waking up in different dimensions. lol
---
If they wanted the game to have PVP they either should've had living factions or some plot where you can't tell which players have been infected by the Scorched plague. And then they should've made it good PVP.
---
Thanks, already bought mine so that won‚Äôt help me any. I‚Äôm still gonna check it out though. 
---
worked for me
---
I use a troubleshooters spear and xo1. Im sure I could do it out of PA if I brought a good rifle too.
---
"BUTCHER" Pete. Hackin' and slashin'. The chorus is about butchering not raping. The title, the lyrics, everything points towards hacking people up. Not much of a hidden meaning there. Lol.
---
If you reported that comment that player would likely face consequences especially if they are on Xbox. 
---
Saying you are going to put a hit on an account implies the intention to engage in harassment of said player. 
---
Last night I was finishing up doing the quest to get the normal red nuka paint and just popped over to #7 to take a look. The door was wide open and the Quantum plan was just sitting there. 
---
If you don't feel like being disappointed at getting shot down on the quest, just server hop til you find an open door. 
---
Music licensing can be very expensive. That's why there are so many relative unknowns. Licensing per product for usage could be cost prohibitive.
---
So while I agree with you, don't hold your breath.
---
i like my T60 for the lower repair costs, and i like how hotrod looks on it
---
I imagine that it's random stuff, though if I'm wrong I'll be happy to know that that's the case. 
---
at least in fallout new vegas when they put in ‚Äúwhere have you been all my life‚Äù from the early 2000‚Äôs, you couldn‚Äôt really tell that much as it didn‚Äôt stand out from most of the other songs but the beach boys doesn‚Äôt really fit the country feel of appalachia radio (not going to lie i still like the song though)
---
YEAH
---
Yeah I generally don't seek PvP out. It always always always comes to me though. I love it. Gets my blood pumping. No other game has made me feel this much adrenaline (except maybe vanilla WoW).
---
Yeah, a common interpretation of butcher Pete is about a murderer but the song is about a butcher who sleeps around. There's a part of the song with women posting his bail and were waiting for him to 'chop their meat'. It's also just a silly song of innuendos. He tries to chop the wind and rain, an old woman who's 92, and electric chair. You can imagine a story of a small town where all the women keep going to the butcher's shop for some reason.
---
Finally a worthy opponent!  
---
Our battle will be glorious!

The code is 748250, not much in there besides random junk a nuka cola quantum and a randomized plan

Kicking. Check you DMs, my dude.

All right except the the plans are also 1 per server 
---
I never saw a video bring up a single issue like that for a minute or longer. Maybe something to mention for 30 seconds. It was never the focus of any of the many many videos I've watched. It was more so something people used to poke fun at this game. 
---
Nope.  Same with Master level. 
---
I've played GTA. The point is I'd hate to see this game become like GTA. One of the things I love about this game is that there aren't many griefers. And it seems Bethesda (unlike Rockstar who wants and encourages griefers) is honest about wanting to stop them. If there is an issue, I like people bringing it up so that Bethesda knows. The more uproar the more likely they'll do something. Look at GTA, a community that until recently would defend Rockstar no matter what (which was really annoying cause you could not say one constructive criticism without people having a hissy fit at you) and look at what GTA has become. 
---
No sir! As I replied really one minute ago to another comment: I got killed from a player with a really fast combat knife. While trying to get away by fast traveling I got froze in main menu and since Iam an unyelding build with not much hp either the guy had enough time to kill me. I should‚Äôve mentioned that scenario where I got killed a bit more detailed I guess, my bad. But all these guys simply accusing me of lying, come on. I see this so often.
---
in a full set of assassins gear @ 100 resist you will be taking about as much damage as the dude in 400+ resist. 
---
Now add the 75% reduction from sentinel and youre mostly immune to damage.  
---
Unyielding is for the bloody builds. they get +12-15 to each special (which boosts resists via barbarian and evasive)
---
Can pull \~175 phys resist from perks and mutations on a bloodied build
---
It needs more music of any sort. I got bored of the radio stations after about 3 hours. It's like they know they want people to play for 7600 hours (which is ludicrous, btw) but they don't want to pay for more than an hour of music.
---
Those are quite steeply priced. I usually go for discounted photomode poses. I did buy one outfit on discount: the Western Duster, because I like how it looks. I've never paid actual money for atoms, though, but I may consider that in the future if I have disposable income. 
---
First of all, how dare you.
---
Oh my God, yes! Also, Wanda Jackson
---
It looks like you just want EZ PvP because you lack skills.
---
It's literally happening every time I play now. Usually in mobs. I'm reporting them all, but until there is an official response, I have to assume nothing is happening.
---
I encourage everyone to report griefers for harassment.
---
Looks like the code for that door comes from a terminal in the enclave military wing so it may be a static spawn for the lining plan. 
---
The best part has to be testing out different types of headlamps with the new paint.
---
[Purple or Blue...](https://imgur.com/vXmFa24)
---
Been chasing Mr. Squeeze down for a while, thanks for the heads up!
---
Depends if you supply the materials then no but if not I‚Äôll charge 100caps for the whole thing 
---
I agree. I honestly am with you and don't mind seeing some one complain about problems there might be (as I don't like griefing and as I replied to some one else who tried to say it's not GTA that the point is we don't want it to end up like GTA. That game does not have a fun playerbase to play with).
---
Can confirm the Inspector outfit.  Has done that since release of the outfit.
---
Silver Shroud keeps the underarmor on.
---
Absolutely. I‚Äôd quest for more songs 
---
You can skip straight to shielded, you don't have to apply each lining in order.
---
Ye me too, these rng encounters are sometimes frustrating. You're welcome, have a nice day
---
3 strength, 2 perception.
---
Yeah my stash limit is a daily struggleüòÖ
---
Should have stashed your junk. 
---
some hank williams would fit well also
---
I totally agree with you! And they could use the money from in game purchases to cover the cost of the new songs. 
---
And to add insult to injury, after I died I went back to my workshop, only to be spawnkilled by a different lvl 250 player because they found my welcome mat. Before I can even load in I start taking damage, and I die within one or two seconds of loading in. Couldn't even see where he was, must have had chameleon or something.
---
It‚Äôs fissure. Has nothing to do with fish. 
---
How I get my revenge, at least once a week: go to Welch Train station, from the platform pick off the ones around Welch one by one with rifle.  I‚Äôm a stealth sniper build, so I can usually get almost all of them before they even know what hit ‚Äòem. The boss usually figures out my general location and starts firing missles.  I lol and cap his ass too.  I clean up any hiding in the houses with my double barrel shotgun, point blank.  Very satisfying.  
---
Peace
---
Still happening
---
Wait, that is still in the game? The concrete glitch with a campfire? Is that where you can stack them?  
---
It‚Äôs a PvP game 
---
I think the general consensus is that it‚Äôs a bug and they for whatever reason didn‚Äôt address it in the hot fix yesterday. 
---
I think they should make it to where we can purchase new radios or songs for the radios with atoms.
---
cool vid
---
Fourthed
---
Apparently. It happened to my whole team last night. We figured the attack was isolated until they stalked us on the other side of the map after not doing anything with the workshop. 
---
Probably data mining on PC, two elaborate secrets ruined in 24 hours. 
---
The voice work on this one is a delight. I wish it would spawn more frequently AND that they institute a timer to let us know how much time is left on events.
---
I know right, would be awesome if you could encounter patrolling Enclave Robots once you unlock that faction. Add a bit of RP to the world.
---
nice
---
This is what I was expecting (and why I never turn it on). It's surprising you have to ask for it.
---
Are you serious Haha
---
Do you mean Johnny Caps and Gutsy Cline?
---
Again. Not my opinion. I was speaking for the fanbase.
---
If you think it's such a small minority id like you to explain how TES3MP or better yet Skyrim together got so popular. How much money were they making a month on patreon? Like 50k or something? And that's for the shittiest version of Co op possible. Having your team members puppet a npc. This community has been jonsing for a proper Bethesda game experience but with a friend or two. That's not my opinion. That's a fact. Deny it if you want. There's nothing more to say if you're just going to blatantly ignore that people have been asking for Co op long before 76. 10+ years.
---
Personally, I've come to like the MMO lite game that Bethesda gave us. It's focus on looting and player trading is very intriguing to me. What it lacks in a good roleplaying and narrative experience it makes up for with interesting looting and build ideas. Obviously it needs some major balancing and meta changes. And I wouldn't be opposed to proper modding that gave us a traditional experience similar to r/beyondskyrim or something like that.
---
At first it felt weird having quests rewards magically appear into my inventory or having so many similar quests. Not being able to interact with NPC's like rose and biv still makes me a little bit sad when I remember the roots of FO, but ultimately this is a different game. It's not FO4 or 3. I'm OK with that. I just hope Bethesda nails their next rpg experience in terms of dilaogue, choice, story, freedom, and roleplaying. I'm sure they'll be using what they learned from 76 to add Co op to something like TES VI and hopefully they're not too far gone to make that game a proper rpg looking back to Morrowind and taking inspiration from NV. 
---
But for now. I'm fine playing 76. I have 4 or 5 characters. Most above level 50 all with different builds. The game doesn't really require defined roles, unfortunately, but I still like making builds and trying to synergize with my team anyway. 
---
Yep, this seems to be the case for most people playing, I imagine. You will run into far more friendly people than bad. 
---
So consider me a trade mercenary if you will, but I just wanted to share an observation from server hopping to pick up a second set of plans to sell.
---
I have found locked doors to the bunker multiple times (indicating someone has not yet opened it) but no plans after I learned them myself.
---
Perhaps they no longer appear (or are not visible) if you know them?
---
Came here to say this. 
---
There's a good 12-15 plants at the whitesprings front entrance. 
---
The main thing seems to be plans for an enclave underarmour mod
---
Only if I have the option to permanently delete Johnny Cash Radio. No reason to have that juat to scroll passed lol
---
It‚Äôs never been they kill you once and satisfied. If it happened then it was a bug. They have always killed u til server hop 
---
Yes
---
Underrated comment 
---
asking the teal questions
---
I'm guessing he's one of the ones guilty of the antisocial behaviors...
---
Ill definetly message you later on when im online
---
I'm having the same issue. Never had a jukebox and first time ever placing a radio. Placed it on a table and turned it on and no sound.
---
I never claimed I got 1 slapped/ shot. I never said it happened fast. I just said it happened, to assume I‚Äôm spreading bullsh!t is just beyond me... as i commented earlier under another response: it was a fast and strong combat knife, Iam an unyelding built and on top I froze in main menu while trying to fast travel away. Maybe I should‚Äôve specified it. But under these circumstances it seems that it‚Äôs still possible to get killed in pacifist mode. 
---
This is great news
---
You can't get gears and screws from a workshop unless it has a junk extractor 
---
So much yes!
---
Because the whole "support the game" by buying in-game currency for a game you already paid for is a false narrative that was created by the marketing departments for these games.
---
Whether people are making micro-transactions or not has no bearing on whether new content will be released.
---
Fifthed?
---
I would sell so much bulk junk that I max out all the vendors, and still be at max again  the next day.
---
I think people confirmed that while it appears you can only hold one there are additional benefits for gathering up to 5, this could have been changed though. 
---
That would be awesome, almost like how the new quest line with brewing and finding new recipes.  There has to be some crazy robot DJ out there somewhere!
---
Sixthed 
---
Manta man keeps your underarmor on, but the enclave one clips through it
---
They werent doing it intentionally, so I suppose they aren‚Äôt assholes.
---
It would be cheaper to have their own band make music and/or do covers.
---
Oh yeah I'm not saying it's a low level, but if 139 is a very high level what would you call a level 420?
---
They would have to to pay for the license fee to use the song XD
---
Ok I keep that in mind 
---
Ooo that would be good.
---
Or those twice damned feral golfers 
---
Yeah I should of said something else instead of very.
---
You haven't played a lot of games have you? Some of the best, longest running, strongest player-base games release new content, on regular basis, for completely free.
---
They promised to give us a game with constant updates without charging any more after the initial purchase. If we start and uproar for more radio then they have to pay for the songs and then we start having to pay to play.
---
Hopefully not! I heard the max is 2.
---
It's quite clear you can't be 100% anything, except trash. Why come in here to sling mud on someone trying to enjoy their experience? You know who does that? Damaged people. I hope you heel. All the best to you. 
---
I thought mine wasn't working after placing but it started working after awhile.  Flipped it off an on a couple times.  Got rid of my jukebox too
---
For walls theres already a conduit that is designed to go through walls, I think its even called that
---
I know that‚Äôs why we would have to pay for it same as skins and stuff. But I understand a lot of songs are expensive to purchase so I‚Äôd assume they would have to be priced very very high to were most people would have to use real money to buy it.
---
I know they where not doing it intentionally, I just want a system to prevent people from unknowingly screwing the people actually fighting.
---
It‚Äôs the white knight downvote army, aka ‚Äûdie hard‚Äú fallout fans who will defend this game against every inch of criticism. I mean i love this game too, but some folks on here are beyond me with their ‚Äûlove‚Äú. Look at my comment, -7 downvotes... how and why? 
---
Back when I was around 35-45 I was doing some exploring. At this point in the game I felt pretty invincible. I end up filling myself up with loot to the point where I couldn't fast travel and I'm taking a shortcut through Clarksburg on my way back to a stash. 
---
Next thing I know I see 10 or so lvl 50? Behemoths walking single file through Clarksburg. "Oh neat!" I thought, "Some free xp and maybe more loot!" Then I proceed to get wrecked. 
---
I have never seen it again, but now that my build is complete I'd love another crack at the big guys... Just make it an event and call it "What's the BIG deal with Clarksburg?" or something.
---
T60.
---
Cheap to maintain, mods are layed everywhere, BOS paintjobs.
---
Plus it looks cool af and resistances are balanced enough to run everything, even more if you can over repair it. 
---
All I run for melee is lvl 2 incisor and my combat knife does work
---
I'll keep trying it, and hopefully it will start at some point. It's not a huge deal, just wanted to make a post so in case anyone from Beth is watching and can take some notes, maybe it will help them narrow down what's happening. 
---
Which roof?? There are many. 
---
It‚Äôs really just a game mechanic, and Bethesda have a bit more in their mind then that
---
lol it's no big deal just commenting 
---
You‚Äôd think so, but I server hopped for 2 hours last night and didn‚Äôt find an unlooted TNT 7. This morning on my 3rd server hop I sprinted past two guys who were walking toward it, opened it, and found the plans. Apologies to the guys who got there just behind me. I know what you‚Äôre going through...
---
Also why he would end up in the electric chair ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Uranium fever is notorious for timing out before you can get to the terminal. I would say it's 50/50 at best because of all the mobs present that are between you and that terminal. If I don't have a solid 3 minutes when I get there, I don't even bother trying.
---
Thanks for the info! More hats!
---
Happens a lot but how can you level lock an event on an open world map? I've put so much thought into and cant come up with a decent solution. They'd have to make the event occur in a separate area you load into and people that haven't yet launched a nuke or people below X level wouldn't be able to load there. 
---
Its not just for pvp, for pve its great too
---
Xbox my tag is Wildestknight18 i must see this
---
Given the amount of people posting negative comments about it, it will never be unpopular, so this also means more players in the future.
---
Do you really need to craft the previous versions tho? I didn't with the BoS underarmour. Skipped right to Protective giving +2 special bonuses
---
What an amazing story thanks for sharing 
---
They're just sponges. 
---
I dont care who you are, you are not surviving almost 60 10mm rounds, mister lots of eyes mutated headass
---
And those games don‚Äôt use voluntary micro transactions as a source of funding?    How do they pay their employees?
---
Only if it isn't pure.
---
Vault tech still better. 1 st, 2per, 2end, 2lck
---
I can name 5 MMORPGs that have already solved this problem. There are a bunch of solutions. Any of which would work fine here. The problem is that you have a studio and a team that has never made an MMO before and it shows.
---
Have you unequipped, and equipped your perks? I've been loving the extra damage on my Gat build. I just wish it fired faster. Right now it's basically a 500rd semi-auto. 
---
The idea is you can do full damage to them once they pick the lock, I've often waited for people to pick my lock just to sneak attack them and one shot them. If you aren't geared for pvp that's another story. 
---
You don't.
---
Why? So you can use your mutations to one shot people with our overpowered deathclaw? Good luck finding people to play survival with of thats how you‚Äôll treat them. Think about it, if survival turns into gta online then nobody is going to play survival. You‚Äôre not a raider, you are a griefer. There is a massive difference. 
---
If someone else on the server does the steps to get the keypad number, the game will only allow the last one, so your number became unusable basically
---
Sure, the new quest is 20-30 minutes and its pretty enjoyable, the new brewing system is awesome in my opinion 
---
It was hot when I zoned in the game, outside the main building.  I managed to get my hazmat suit on in time to not die immediately, which I thought was pretty good, given I hadn't had my coffee yet.
---
But no, I did not run in, wait a minute or two to zone, stash my shit, and run back out, wait a minute or two to zone, and then get my game on.
---
I did not do this.  ***Because it was awash in glowing chubby fellows trying to eat my face.***
---
They could still go to the area they just couldn‚Äôt join the scorched earth event. So they wouldn‚Äôt get the rewards which would discourage them from showing up and messing with the queen.
---
Even if you shut your door they just spawn inside. That's why I started putting generators and crafting upstairs behind a second locked door. Take that mole rats, mongrels, and ghouls.
---
Why not just go back to D1. Everyone just wanting every old gun from D1 instead of having the devs make new guns that are cool.

Really? 100%? Because this definitely applies to junk, according to Bethesda: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44292/kw/player%20inventory](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44292/kw/player%20inventory)

"**How do I avoid losing my junk?**
---
The only safe place to store your stuff is in your Stash. "Stash" containers can be found throughout Appalachia. ¬†Any other location or container, including corpses, power armor, or your base that's not your stash, will result in those items being lost. Don't drop items in the world to trade with other *players*. Be sure to use the Trading system built into the game to avoid losing your stuff.¬†
---
If you crash or log out, any junk left in the world that was not in your Stash or character *inventory* will be lost.¬†"
---
So, not 100%. Try again, champ.
---
Alright, thanks. I thought it was a junk extractor. 
---
I know the feeling - I started trying to farm them yesterday and the find rates seem to have been nerfed because for every place that people claim to have been able to find 4-5 I only ever find 1 at most. 
---
Well, considering I have played those 5 you could enlighten me? 
---
Go back to Fortnite, child!
---
I almost never need to repair my x-01. I've only repaired it like twice but never because I've really needed to. still had like half or more than half its durability left and I use it a ton over weeks of playing?
---
as a member in good standing of the Order of Mysteries, I agree
---
Weird.  I've seen other people mention this as well.  The bots outside are hostile / KOS, but you run inside and everything is chill and groovy.  It's not just me.
---
Is the door at the top of tanagra or the bottom? I‚Äôve never found this door myself but heard about from friends and others, not sure on location. 
---
I would pay for the return of Jingle Jangle and Johnny Guitar
---
Well here‚Äôs the thing: I don‚Äôt read each and every new post on this subreddit, most of the times only the hot posts. So yeah, of course someone else has had these experience. Now it isn‚Äôt allowed for me to post about that topic bc some other dude did it? Or are you really assuming that‚Äôs me with another account? What the heck man, get a life. The die hard fallout white knights who are downvoting every inch of criticism is strong, but it seems not strong enough when i look at the response of this post. 
---
This has nothing to do with the location of your camp.
---
There is major bug affecting certain people that prevents them from placing their camp anywhere. It will display that message no matter where you put your camp. It has something to do with what items you have in you camp.
---
I mean stop do do dmg when reach 20% of your health
---
Got any legendary handmade left?
---
Thank goodness! It was so annoying before! 
---
I just beat her the other day for the first time  with 8 people. You just need to work together. Ignore the scorched people. Only focus on taking out the bigger and stronger enemies. Take plenty of stimpacks and chems. Your main focus is to fire at the beast when she‚Äôs in the air and melee her in the head when she‚Äôs on the ground. 
---
Ok, guess I'll try it again
---
They should make certain world items instanced per player, every other online RPG does.
---
Yeah there isn't a new exclusion zone or anything, it is a bug affecting certain players' camps. No matter where he put that camp he would have gotten the same error message.
---
It‚Äôs a personal decision that must be made.

Junk extractor. And pick up every typewriter you can find. Vault-Tec Agricultural Resource Center has gears and screws in small boxes  inside the building and in the outer building closest to Flatwoods.
---
Don‚Äôt be mad.  It‚Äôs just roleplaying. I hope to roleplay with you soon!
---
  Keep, sell, scrap.  K, S, X.  Easy to flag at the time, and as things are fluid (power armour / outfits) some items appear unequipped even though you need them.  When you get to a vendor/work bench, you can bulk sell or scrap as appropriate.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ys6bo/loot_resource_locations/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share this post gives a bit of guidance on where to find certain junk. For Screws I suggest going to sugar Grove Desk fans) and if you've unlocked it the whitespirngs bunker military wing (desk fans)

So she wouldn't get a buff from or aggro to the people that lack the requirements to be there? So the event would essentially pretend they don't exist?

Has anyone who already knows the plan tried this out?

What happened to player vending?
---
They couldn‚Äôt deal damage, the queen wouldn‚Äôt get a buff, and she wouldn‚Äôt aggro on them, and they wouldn‚Äôt get rewards.

Can you send me your build?

I really want to kill the queen, but my build has almost nothing that specs into one weapon other than melee

If a cannibal eats another cannibal and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

Dammit, yes.  And Hank Williams.  I would also be most happy with some Flying Burrito Brothers.  Because they're awesome.

More importantly, why the hell do you want a garbage weapon like that?

I like this plan

I feel like the song ‚ÄúThe Highwayman‚Äù would fit really well in this game.

the crossbow? dunno, im doing a no guns character and scorchbeasts just never land. So now im doing a Geralt from the witcher thing where its melee only and i'll have a crossbow

Well I will be avoiding survival mode in order to avoid people like you. I‚Äôm not mad in the slightest. Just dissapointed that people actually play the game like that. I mean you literally use a map and stalk people. Raiders don‚Äôt have a map to stalk people. If you were ‚Äúroleplaying‚Äù you‚Äôd do it like a proper raider and just sit and camp one spot. But no, you‚Äôre a griefer and you have to fast travel everywhere people go with your map that shows you everything. So you really aren‚Äôt a raider because in the lore the raiders don‚Äôt have that technology. It‚Äôs not really roleplaying of your ignoring certain parts of the lore, is it?
---
Gta is the worst... thar game was dead for me when they introduced flying vehicles with rocket launchers on top. And as I said in another comment, Iam not your wannabe hater or something, it happened to me and I was just furious. I mean it isn‚Äôt as easy to kill someone with slap damage then it was like 2 month ago, that‚Äôs a good thing I guess, but it‚Äôs still possible under certain circumstances, like being an unyielding built with low health, main menu froze and your opponent has a very fast combat knife for example. 
---
That's ridiculous. If anyone is genuinely that persistent in trying to kill you, just fast travel to camp or something.
---
I have an Instigating The Dragon that I use on peoples faces when they slap me. Works like a charm.
---
 If you've added me, please join my world so I'm not jumping all over the place. Thank you :) 
---
I don't play anymore this was made 1month ago lol
---
Early game is meh. I found myself running all over with a knife. Mid to late is where it's at. But imo, 76 is better with friends. Start a looking for group post. I found a really funny group a couple days ago.  Even sold me a level 40 suppressors ripper for like 20ish caps.
---
Looks really good! Nice work.
---
Use the search function in the main fo76 sub, you will find many people are experiencing the same issue on pc. 
---
What are you locking people out of though? The only thing you need to defend is your crops, and only if they want to destroy them
---
I've had 0 problems with raiders ever, only the occasional weirdo in a straight jacket doing slap damage against my pacifist character. 
---
This is the worst..speed demon helps with getting the loot bag back
---
And I see person who knows shit yet deems themselves in position to be the judge. If not for your lack of both knowledge and skill, you would not say something as untrue as that the game completely lacks balance. I am disinterested in opinions of PvE snowflakes who think all PvP people are griefers. You deserve being griefed. Cya.
---
I would hardly call this new content. There is a new short quest, and a new crafting system for alcohol.
---
The new Biv NPC is hilarious though. I forgot how good the past couple of fallout games were because they put effort into developing the NPCs. Nice that they finally did that for one NPC in 76. Only took them 5 months
---
Oh ok well sorry for remembering a word incorrectly. Shame on me and my family. 
---
Ah yes, the infamous glowing twinkies of death and DESTRUCTION!!!
---
Good idea. Where's that highly radioactive water at?
---
No, so I dont have to get slapped to death when trying to ignore pvp, now I can shoot first instead of waiting, Jackass.
---
I want Wayne and Gucci's 'We Be Steady Mobbin'.
---
I would volunteer. I‚Äôve been dying to make a Fallout based song. I might make one just because. 
---
I support this mostly; better trade etiquette and efficiency, but I'm not on board with mic chat on every trade. 
---
Theres something that really pulls me out of the game getting on voice chat with randoms. I'm walking around in the post apocalypse like a badass god, virtually invincible with my fresh gear blinging. Now I gotta have a voice conference with some brat to exchange one item we've already set a price for in text or post? Nah, I'm not here to socialize.
---
Mic for complex deals and quantities, sure. Simple trades, unnecessary. I also think everyone should be crafting their own ammo after Lvl 50. 
---
Thank you! Well according to some experts here we are liars. This isn‚Äôt a problem and we should shut our mouths!! Some people...

This lol. Jesus christ I can't escape these angsty teenagers to save my life. He says it doesn't matter what level, but predators almost always pick weak easy targets, so I guarantee most of his "role playing" is against low level players. I've been level 15-16 and had groups of 3-4 70+ and into the 100s hound me, destroy my camps, workshops, follow me around the map, and it's just frustrating. Like, go pick a fight with someone who might actually beat you.
---
That‚Äôs an arbitrary comment.  Just because it‚Äôs free doesn‚Äôt make it good. 
---
There is a place near the ferris wheel North west of the vault, might take some exploring, but there is a junk pile next to a decribit trailer that you can set up your camp and place an extractor at, thats where i set up my camp permanently, and constantly getting screws and other useful junk.
---
if you don't use the key cards they should stay in your inventory while you server hop if you do use the key cards and enter the code then they disappear from your inventory and when you server hop you will have to grab them again

Er, what?

The only place I know them to be is behind dyer I think they glow green. I‚Äôve been back a couple times to make radshield  and was able to find them

I know there will but damn, have some shame and try to keep it on dl.

That would require Bethesda to acknowledge NV in any way.
---
OMG the legendaries always do this at Harper's 
---
Since you‚Äôre suggesting restricting areas of the open world from access by lower level players, thereby impacting their gameplay, there should be concessions made by higher level players.  Nuking an area other than Fissure Prime that is normally accessible by lower levels should no longer be allowed, ie. Whitesprings.
---
Mine won‚Äôt be a popular opinion, because so many players complaining about others having negative impacts on their game ignore the consequences of their own actions on those others.
---
Mine is a bit more normie as its just a house the the east of Morgantown with a nice view and 3 floors and a viewing platform. I'm not home now, but I'll get it to you asap

I placed 2 radios in my camp. Turned them on. They weren‚Äôt working so I fast traveled and roamed around a bit. I got disconnected. Then I loaded into a new world, went to my camp and they were working.

It was a joke on me.. not angry about your comment 
---
Thanks for the reply. You bring up a couple valid topics for discussion.  I agree with you totally about raiding being more discouraged than friendly play in general because you actually have to become an "outlaw" with a bounty to raid in the traditional sense.   Raiding other players can never be overly profitable in this game as it stands if all you can get is some caps and whatever junk a player has on them. There will be some that take issue with that statement, but profit isn't always defined simply in caps, at least, not to me. PVP Workshop raiding is a whole other topic really and isn't under discussion here. I think we both understand that. I was mostly focused on the "griefer" type player specifically and I should have said, " lightly encouraged" as I have in past posts. I mean. come on, they give you the plans and ability to build lavish dwellings and shops (at least by Wasteland standards), and they also give you a perk card that lets you do more damage in a camp. Because it is a choice that has been provided by the devs., then the players who like to harass and bully will try and exploit it to their advantage. Some are not even trying to get caps out of the deal. That's when they actually quit being mischievous and annoying as a choice and become "griefers" by design.  I try not to overly judge anyone's behavior in a video game, especially an RPG game.  A lot of people don't keep that Role Playing part in mind, but everyone knows that some players are just out to play "Ruin Everyone Else's Day", no matter the real title of the game they are actually in. I believe this leads directly into your main point: Content.  I have played this game since day 1 and did not experience the sort of griefing early on that we are seeing now. Totally separating the PVP/PVE people in the short term until major new content comes out will ultimately be the best solution for all in the long term.  As you pointed out, a lot of these people are just simply bored.  Having "no damage" for pacifist players will alleviate all griefing against them when the new content runs out and boredom sets in again though.   
---
oh man really? i've spent so long on a melee character and killing scorchbeasts are just tedious now due to them never landing.

I had no jukebox in my main camp. Maybe I should build one and then scrap it?
---
I mean, we have the exact opposite opinions here. I want more songs like The Beach Boys.

Fallout being a retro-futuristic 50s doesn‚Äôt mean that the only music that existed was shit that sounds like the background of Steamboat Willy.

In your rush to tag as many mobs as possible, you became sloppy.  Actions and choices should have consequences, even in a video game.

Okay - that made me LOL. Too funny.....
---
I noticed that as well. Followed the video online to get plans and when I finally got the keys to the bunker I had to server jump for an hour and a half before I was finally able to find one. Same with the first Nuka cola paint as well. Such a cool secret it‚Äôs a shame people are farming it. Hopefully Bethesda can find a way to improve upon this with future additions. Maybe put the plans in an instance box or something and have the box tied to each account or something. That way once a character gets the plan it doesn‚Äôt spawn back for them anymore. One and done. 
---
I don't know, I have nevee tried sorry.

Go back to Fortnite, little child.

Honestly if they made em purchaseable it'd offset the cost of the licensing

Have you tried getting good?

It's not griefing. PVP is currently a part of the game whether you like it or not.

It‚Äôs been a known bug with other weapons as well.  We were hoping that it would have been fixed by now.

I try not to mess with the when below level 50. Last time I was there... on accident, level 38.  I took my damage with pride and stayed with the group skiing what I could. Crit vats with black powder still does something useful... even if my 1 damage per shot to rebuild my crit doesn't. I had eagle eye too.

Anyway. I agree. If you can't contribute... at the very least don't screw everyone else by running.

The game seems to load the boarded up version of the new buildings first then in time it gets around to loading the accessible versions.

I'll often just walk away for a bit then walk back and the doors have loaded and become usable.

I will not allow Johnny Guitar in this game.

I refuse to have to listen to it every other song.

No need to shame casuals. I don't exactly have decked out gear or min-maxed perks, but I've helped take out the queen several times. I use a bloodied lever I found and a two shot handmade. With weightless armor I found (people just throw this stuff away) and chameleon I can consistently get sneak multipliers and crits on her wings from range and just spam ammo into her face when she lands. 
---
Point is, you don't have to min max your character and have a super gun or weapon, but it should be better than a base weapon and you should know how to use it effectively.
---
You failed to identify any problems
---
It‚Äôs fine. Just asking 
---
Didn't know that existed! Thank you!

Someone who gets it
---
Ill submit an official support ticket as well then :)

Why some people would thumbs down such reasonable response is fascinating. The entire pvp mode of this game is to encourage player on player violence, if you haven‚Äôt noticed already. Making pacifists killable and reward the aggressor with victim‚Äôs caps is the very core of this game, no matter how they dress it up with fancy emotes and fantasy monsters. Meanwhile the dumbass griefers are perfectly protected by the ‚Äòbounty‚Äô system, just shoot a piece of wall and you limit your loss at 5, the fun begins from there. 
---
I‚Äôd LOVE to be able to play this game like the Free For All mode in COD, but no Bethesda thought that would be too brutal for the dumb griefer crowd who can‚Äôt really play a real shooter game in hardcore mode. So they came up with this elaborate pvp mode so that you don‚Äôt need skill nor tactics, just buy a magic standing-still armor off ebay and start killing new players. 
---
Most people don‚Äôt understand the implication of what Bethesda is doing. Companies are working on crypto-tokens across games so that you can mine and earn tokens in this game play and use it in other games, essentially a game currency that goes beyond certain titles. Bethesda is setting up a precedence in the gaming world so that your game currency can be robbed and stolen in the virtual world just like in the real world. Instead of rewarding people with system caps, they let players rob each other, and force pacifist players to either die and get robbed or GTFO of the server. Virtual murder and robbery is the underlying core structure of the pvp mode. 
---
Its just as tedious for ranged characters. I believe the trick is to kill the scorched on the ground they summon and then they land for a bit and when they take off they summon more. Otherwise melee would be impossible to play against scorchbeasts
---
 The two junkyard... the food process factory... Tyler county... all have junk nodes. Take all 4 and you'll have 6 junk extractors running.  Find a good campsite and you'll have 7. I managed to hold that in a stable server for 4 hours one day.  ... so much junk..... so very much....
---
Yea it stacks, with 5 pieces you have 75% less overall damage, and with assassins you take 40% less from the damage that comes from players. So youre left taking 40% less-of the 25% overall damage coming from a player. But yes while shooting it still counts, you just cant be staggered or walk or else it wont work
---
Amazingly some players will give them for free , in return I‚Äôll toss in a legendary or a costume or some booze and food
---
Most people misuse the term griefer, because they‚Äôve had very little MMO experience.
---
Dat hangover, doe...

I just turn the music off and listen to a playlist of classic country I made on spotify. Cause I 1000% agree where is my girl Patsy!!! Let me know if you want a link to it man I update it with more tracks from time to time

---
The strength benefits my character better than the vault suit would.
---
Its amazing isn't it...
---
Because they make a lot of changes. Find me a major game that announces every change they make even they update. Rockstar certainly doesn't do it. 
---
They should make adds that are perma aggro just to under leveled players. Also have them camp their loot bags
---
You don't own the fight or the map so adjust and deal with random stuff like that happening. You'll never have full control of that situation so go in realizing that.
---
I would suggest at least trying to go for the keys at least now and try for the plans later. Do that for the standard nc paint as well. Those will stay in your inventory once you have them and you can check the bunkers periodically.

Yes. All they have to do is initiate a claim on the shop and it flags you as hostile. No slap damage. There is a timeout on it, though I don't know how long. A solo player can mark you on the map, claim, then jump nearby and look for you. Teamed, they can set up ambushes with one claiming while the others take out the owner and anyone teamed with them. 
---
You could roleplay a nomad or exile from the chapter

Pretty sure keypads don't have any effect. Did they fix them?

No need to correct yourself.

No.

If you already dropped the game and have just resorted to posting on forums asking random strangers to explain why you should return, while not bothering reading the other 45 posts a day from like minded individuals, no. You are not the droid we're looking for.

Thank you for this response. I mean I‚Äôm not full of myself or anything like that, I accept that there are different opinions of course. But I wondered what was wrong about my comment. I didn‚Äôt trash talk or anything... and yes to all the things you said. That‚Äôs really on point and I don‚Äôt know how anyone couldn‚Äôt agree to this.

How much should I sell it for,I don‚Äôt really know 
---
Knowing that I made someone and their friend mad makes me happy
---
If you have time to shoot, you have time to scoot
---
The only problem with that is they can then come back and kill you. IMO, if someone is wanted, they should go back to being non-pvp when the bounty is cleared.

Okay just making sure you knew I wasn‚Äôt trying to mock you for being ESL. That would be an awful thing for me to do. :)

Wow. Lots of mad folks around these parts. I think the post was derailed by all of the uppity prey. Back to the topic at hand. Any raider gangs recruiting?
---
I got everything I need but every time I went to the dome it was ransacked. I spent 2 hours server hopping and every single time someone was in there before me. Ugh. 
---
Good luck, these things are bugged as fuck. Make sure you have green thumb perk equipped so you get 2 if you manage to find one that is harvestable. I server hopped probably 25 times before I got one.
---
Some buildings definitely reflect a great deal of light.  Many flora really do emit light.
---
I've been doing each and every card and code collection on a single server.  I only hopped when it didn't work for me.  
---
Theyre not additive. Eg 75% sentinel +40% assassins doesn't make 140% dmg resist.
---
We don't have exact data (that I've been able to find) but it seems to apply in layers. 
---
100 damage in becomes 25 from sentinel.
---
25 becomes 15 from assassin
---
Yeah I found a Wendigo there as well, was pretty pleased as they're my favourite new enemy besides Scorchbeasts
---
Give me Word Bearers!!!!!

Maybe the harshness of the wastes isn‚Äôt for you?  Perhaps something lighter and more forgiving?  Maybe, I don‚Äôt know, Mario Party?
---
There's a subreddit for raiders, but it's almost empty...
---
Anyway raiding in more then 2 players it's not worth the effort, playing in a squad of 4 means that you get 1/4 caps for every kill.
---
He has very interesting videos, like the series "What Happens if You Nuke...".
---
I really recommend his channel.

It really fucks with me that that song is actually from the 60s. You just don't think of it being that old. 
---
For items like lockpick,..master lockpick. I think it would help if you could rack and stack

I see them a lot at watoga. But be warned, the cabinets that go on walls are still bugged pretty sure so they clip halfway and go through the roof

Sorry, my astonishment was at the lowest price yet... I see people trying to sell it for 5k or more. 
---
Yes.  The game is stable now and there is a roadmap of continuous new (albeit light) content.  
---
I have my generators walled in and connected to my house with garage doors connected to a switch as the only way to get to them.

"The legend of John Henry's hammer" would be amazing

Its labeled as cabinets yea
---
Melee is super crazy ridiculous OP stupid strong.   
---
It's so bad, I would report it as a bug/glitch/exploit if I wasn't too lazy to do so.  
---
Guns, like Rifles, feel like pea shooters by comparison - particularly as you move up over level 50/60 or so.  
---
I think they made some adjustment with the latest patch and my ballistic weapons don't quite feel like a joke anymore, this makes me happy(er).
---
Lolz bump.
---
This is exactly why griefers exist.  Too much too soon. 
---
Read again - I said other people said about being 1 shotted all the time. And it is bs.
---
My criticism of *your* post is that you're claiming you were killed so quickly by slap damage that you could do nothing about it. I'll say this again: it's **not quick**. It takes ages to kill somebody with slap damage. Use a stimpack or too and it will take a few minutes at best. Unless you were in PVP: it's not true. That better?
---
These posts are ridiculous at this point. There's genuine stuff to work on and improve. Spamming stuff about 'griefers' is stupid. This game has the least griefers I've ever found in an online game... except Payday 2. Don't think I ever had griefing in that.
---
Meh. I usually pay about 15/20 caps to fast travel to a workshop, and about 30/40 to claim it.  
---
For what? If I kill a level 30, I only get 30 caps (15 if I'm in a squad with a friend).  
---
I scrap them even ditched my 4barrel dragon too.
---
Got it using remote play the other day, mid-day is key.

Like the Whitesprings' 7 hole Golf Course, the Robot staff has no mercy.

Sniper was \*awesome\* from levels 15 - \~45 or so.  
---
Once I started going up over level 50 or so it was like WTF happened to my sniper, did someone replace my bullets with tiny marshmallows?  Because it felt stupid weak, pathetic.
---
Wouldnt bother. Epic does, and their dataminers are even faster. BECAUSE its a challenge it attracts more talent.
---
Much appreciated. I actually understood all of what you said. Thank you. 
---
Need both - they need to eliminate the ability of "min/maxers" to achieve insanely crazy high damage in the THOUSANDS that one-hit kills you even if you have high health and a good set of armor.
---
A dozen or so stimpacks. Hacker 3 and Lockpick 3 (mostly to skip reactor area totally). 1 furious sharp super sledge, 1 tse combat shotgun (splash to swarms and fastest core killer), 1 tse handmade (turret killer). Modded excavator armor + my mutations.
---
Less than 30 minutes per nuke.
---
Which is ridiculous when considering tamed creatures will attack players just passing by and the turrets start attacking them, too.
---
 Slow and steady. Be prepared to stim. A lot. Hacking and lockpick are useful to skip stuff or control turrets. Anything anti robot you own is also useful. Other than that... have fun
---
Lmao sounds like a blast

Just prevent crazy stupid high max damage from people that exploit the optimal combinations of multipliers and get damage in the THOUSANDS - it's beyond stupid if they can get a golf club to do more damage than a nuke.
---
T51 with T60 legs. 
---
I don't know what to tell you man, that sucks but they got you. Raiders are scummy people, expect to see scummy actions. Did you ever see the movie Book of Eli? Just remember you could be ambushed by a clever setup. It's not all puppies and rainbows out in the wastes--you will die, and it will be frustrating. Remember slavers from previous FO games? Trappers? Cesar's Legion? Relentless and unforgiving. I think it adds immersion to the game. It's in the lore some of these gangs would set up ambushes and take down defenseless merchants. 
---
Meh. That‚Äôs why they make the big bucks. Change the culture that irresponsibly abuses false reporting.
---
What system?  This sounds awesome.
---
I got really lucky yesterday and got it without the key. I went and got the first two keycards and before trying to get the key I decided to pop over to the TNT dome and the door was already open. The plans were just sitting there on the table and no one was around.
---
Posts like this are goddamn cringe.
---
Same, been hopping looking for the plans
---
&gt;No money means no new content.
---
They haven't earned the money they've already got.
---
I've made a habit to dump stuff in containers in train stations. The bag next to the door at whitesprings, the suitcase in the middle of the room in Watoga, etc. 
---
Same here, for the most part, though by pestering Biv enough I've been able to get some daily booze-quests out of him. None of the other dailies are showing up, though. 
---
WTF are you like 8 years old? Why dont you log on and decide for yourself and stop wasting our time with your dumb weekly posts.
---
Who down votes Merle?  Go uninstall, jerk! 
---
I'm on PC, as of the latest patch (3/14?) I am missing Gunsmith level 5.  I still have level 1.  I don't know if I'm missing any others.  This is really frustrating, to say the least.
---
It likely does. Not right now and not this year as all content is already planned before the game released. However, moving in to next year and beyond it seems highly probable that micro transactions would have some influence on the continuation of new content. 
---
dr counts after % reductions
---
bethesda is destroying our LoRe!
---
BLOCK THEIR GTs First,  THEN server hop.
---
Not that hard in avoiding asshats.  
---
Many people have issues with camps at white springs. Some people have set up camp as close to possible to the back door, with turrets, which robs other players the chance to kill the ghouls in the prespawned locations. These people do deserve their camps getting wrecked. My guess is that hate has led to some people thinking that anyone on whitesprings can get hit. I would never hit anyone‚Äôs camp other than the people that make them at the back door. 
---
I have Ammosmith 2 and Ammosmith 1.  There's absolutely no reason for me to keep the level 1 card - it's not like some other cards where it makes sense to have another, lower level one.  
---
Like Gunsmith.  If I have a spare Int slot, may as well equip Gunsmith Level 1 and have my guns break slower.
---
"Free" Yes, I remember paying zero dollars for this incomplete and half-fixed game.
---
You can only get them from treasure maps
---
Probably company employees, the guy at gamestop, and a couple of dimwit griefers lol. 
---
I fully understand your frustration, I haven‚Äôt been griefed but I‚Äôve seen many times a group of them (they can‚Äôt do anything alone, yes they are that dumb) wait outside WS golf club and watoga station and keep attacking new players for caps. Since Bethesda protects them with the 5 caps bounty, nobody goes after the griefers because it‚Äôs simple not worth it (each shotgun shell sells for 4 caps at the vending machine). Bethesda set up the perfect system if you‚Äôre into robbing others. 
---
Billing homestead/Silva homestead will net more that 100 of corn and razorgrain. (Green thumb and potential verdant season while picking).
---
Pretty sure the "harvest nodes" regenerate every few hours/day(they'll regrow but remain unharvestable if youve already picked them recently)
---
yep!!!!!! 
---
By selling games. Its not complicated, unless you're willfully ignorant.
---
I'm level 46, never Silo'd before. Would love to join a team to do it.
---
I mean, it gets pretty boring pretty quick, but if you're ok with it then you might not get as bored as I did so quick.
---
Only the owner can access the fermenter, so it must be a glitch. 
---
I was a little drunk the other day whilst playing and write this little jingle:
---
Gonna launch some nukes gonna kills some ghouls gonna do it in the name of Jeeeeesus.
---
Gonna kill a big frog gonna grab a little log
---
Gonna send a moth man to Jeeeeesus.
---
I sing it to myself sometimes. üòäüòä
---
That‚Äôs the spirit!
---
Seems a little extreme considering you chose to get involved.
---
Poor hoarding AJ lost his shit because of you. 
---
Surprised I had to scroll this far before someone else mentioned this.
---
I'm under the impression that wendigos are technically a variant of ghouls that instead of rotting they actually mutate before becoming immortal.
---
Agreed
---
I'm missing one of my Perks - specifically Gunsmith level 5.  I still have Gunsmith level 1, but I really need the higher level one - I'm sitting here with awesome new weapons but they need a ton of mods and it's so sad that I can't.  I really want to try them out!
---
(I just got a Furious Explosive Combat Rifle, and it needs: Suppressor, new Receiver, new Barrel, new Stock, new Magazine and a Scope!) 
---
Sure they have.  Take your hours played and divide it by purchase price.   What is your cost per entertainment hour?
---
So if you fast travel to Tanagra town and run around the structure to the left, there should be like 3 structures there. One of them is a house/bunker and inside there is a keypad and door.  So it‚Äôs not actually apart of Tanagra town but literally  like right behind it
---
Tbh I just do this every single new Power Armor paint goes up on the store (the sole exception being Playtime paint)
---
I'm a simple man. I come frpm Destiny so I have my priorities straight (namely, making sure to have dozens of different colors for your armor so you kick ass in style)
---
Good to know. Have a source by chance? (Not that I don't believe you. It just means I have to fix some stuff on my tools if you're right. And I'm sooooo lazy)
---
Only you can access the fermenter. I've noticed you can access what's in it from your stash box so check that you've not done that accidentally. 
---
Some areas are now reserved for future content. You are the unlucky winner, unfortunately.
---
Ever run a business?
---
lol
---
I mean, I'm not caping for the inclusion of new music or anything. I legit don't care even a little, I don't listen to the radio in game. I'm just saying I thought there'd be more area appropriate variety to the music is all.
---
I think we need a mix of other genres from the period, not just country.
---
Some Dolly please!!!
---
Yeah I have relogged. It just doesn't want to go.
---
Same here. Slight movement of my camp and back to normal. Mine is across from the cat lady house. It's not even a no build zone that I am aware of. It'll probably happen again. It is a known issue however. Bethesda is aware.
---
Sounds like a witch hunt... But good luck mate.
---
I think your friend needs to learn to manage his junk better. I suggest him starting by pulling out all stored aid, ammo, and gunpowder (unless he crafts ammo). Getting rid of any ammo he doesn't use and not own more than 10 fusion cores max. These are tips I give to all of my friends to lower their stash weight. 800lbs of stored crap is a lot. If he has a lot of excess junk then maybe he should start crafting and scrapping to acquire unattained mods and plans. 
---
Great, raiders are a scourge and deserve to be hunted down and harassed so much that they quit playing. 
---
I don't recall ever having to jump. 
---
The game is not nearly as challenging as you all make it sound.
---
What were the circumstances if you recall?
---
Was it nighttime? Was heart of the swamp active?
---
Or is it absolutely totally random?
---
no, I think that to lure a new player under the guise of wanting to help is a scummy thing to do, especially when they make out that want to sell things to these people.
---
Creating NEW content will not sell an appreciable number of new games.  The cost of original content was priced into the business case for the original price.  
---
Yeah I was aware that's the best place to find them, but I must have server hopped over a dozen times and never found them blooming
---
Enjoy the experience he already had by further clogging the sub with uninteresting, poorly written gloating? 
---
You went from 'you are 100% trash' to 'hope you heal, all the best' in three sentences. We are all damaged people, and in regard to this exchange,you are still the virtue-signaling asshole. 
---
You have to do the daily quest from the booze-bot biv
---
Nah I got a bounty today because while killing ghouls at a friends camp I accidentally took one of their razorgrains. 10caps seems fine for a small mistake.
---
I heard the FM can be summoned by eating 10 feral ghoul golfer corpses. 
---
I think the best step forward from here is to form a minute men style group, It's a right annoyance when they attack anyone who helps you in return
---
True. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt make financial sense, but raiders gonna‚Äô raid. I do it because it is my calling. 
---
So awesome! I gotta go with blue :)
---
Go away
---
BOS combat armors are just regular heavy combat armor. Just crap them to unlock need mods. You would need to crap around 200 get most mode unlocked. Only thing you can not unlock by scrap is BOS mod.
---
Love the diverse responses to this thread.  
---
This is why we need factions.
---
Respawns patched? Might I ask what you mean.
---
Ey, so for those who like to find things ourselves, can you please put a spoiler tag on your datamined "discoveries," please?
---
Nou
---
That comes later I think beginning in April is what the roadmap said
---
Are you talking about when I was showcasing an obvious glitch (automatic The Dragon) that was used against me?
---
I saw him just last night passing my by close to CAMP. I had to save him from high level Colonel Gutys and a sentry bot. He never passed my CAMP  before in all the months I've had it so I wonder if he has new paths in general.
---
It‚Äôs the last Beach Boys Song I would have picked. I would have picked Sloop John B before Wouldn‚Äôt it be Nice, it I guess that would have been better for FO4 than anything else
---
There‚Äôs also a random vendor that sells hard lemonade, found him last night near Watoga. 
---
I was one of those locked out who was waiting on yesterdays hot fix to access that character, so maybe its still not fully fixed.  Figures.  
---
you should start treating your shizophrenia if you are so mentally ill to think all criticism comes only from a single person instead of the many, many people who see a lot of things in this game which are fucked up.
---
I listed it there but no one wanted it so I just sold it to the train vendor. 
---
Do they have a map of what‚Äôs reserved? I‚Äôd love to not do this 10+ in search of a decent camp spot.
---
I am missing Gunsmith level 5 as of the recent update (Wild Appalachia)   
---
This seems slightly different from your issue.  But, people always say "Search first before posting a new thread", so, I'm commenting here anyway in case others come looking at your thread with an issue like mine.
---
Other than the repeatable quest from Biv, and the hard lemonade from mr squeeze. Dont know of any.
---
Good or Bad News for you I guess... One of the 'Four Horsemen' skins that were datamined looked like a plague marine if you wear the X-01.
---
Now I have to go back and see if he played guitar on Wouldn‚Äôt it be Nice because he backed The Beach Boys for a while
---
None there or my personal inventory and Ive only drank 3 total of the new drinks, and that counts the one you drink during the initial questline.   Has to be a glitch if others cannot take them from me.
---
I was able to get the key on my first try this morning! 
---
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
---
Fallout is Fallout. It's an open world RPG where you can decide your character and path. If I get tired of killing things and farming for XP/legendaries, who's going to stop me from starting my own moonshine buisness? Bethesda won't ban me. It's all about doing what YOU want in a lawless wasteland, not what everyone else wants.
---
Glowing ghouls have the ability to revive other ghouls. Wendigos are technically ghouls albeit ones on crack/cocaine/steroids. It makes sense that they can do it as well.
---
I know that and one of the t60 looks like a khorne marine too
---
Are you a post-apocaliptic Crusader?
---
PATSY CLINE!!!! please.  Walking after midnight would be fantastic.
---
I'm missing one of my two Gunsmith cards as of the most recent update.  I'm missing the Max (level 5) Gunsmith, I still have my level 1.  
---
I've tried cycling through all the different "filter" views etc, exiting, reloading the game etc.  No luck, it's gone.  
---
BUT if I go to the "Select a new perk card" menu (I have multiple "Level Ups" saved) it \*does\* still say that I already have Gunsmith at max level.  So, in one since the game still knows I have it, it just won't let me select it (yes, I do have enough empty slots under the appropriate S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat).
---
We vote with our wallets.  Good on you for joining us who do so.  
---
Deathgod905  psn
---
I get that, but I‚Äôm so sick of griefers man. Watching that guy just harass someone for their loot pissed me off. If it wasn‚Äôt aj who lost his loot it woulda been that guy and whoever else he was griefing.
---
Imagine a world, where FO76 has the same amount of music than GTA.
---
Why would you pay 1000 caps for that?
---
I haven't played in literally forever but I'd be down in about 30 minutes or so. My PSN is FlapMyJacks_ 
---
&gt; PS: No, I don't want to go on a free for all PvP server. 
---
If you want PVP, then you should be force to play on a server where every single person is exactly like you. 
---
I know you don't like the sound of that because no more easy caps  of course.
---
So again, as long as other players don‚Äôt impact your game, you have no concern about your impact on theirs.  Level of commitment and effort is relative to the player.  
---
I think so....not sure..I stopped playing for a bit and returned recently.  Anyway I tried to use mine and forgot the code and couldn't.
---
Why do the graphics look so much better, too?
---
cant wait for your account to get banned
---
According to the datamines everything up to the May update is already in the game. They just have to activate it
---
Not all the time, but some of them are rapey. Sometimes it‚Äôs just sex so good they‚Äôll pay his bail
---
That is correct.
---
ManHands329 PSN
---
Ugh! Me too!
---
It's been an interesting pseudo-singleplayer experience for me, in that I can be doing an event and someone will run in and start trying to (badly) melee what I'm shotgunning. Bit like skyrim NPCs in that effect.
---
The other difference is that occasionally, if I get bored, I can put on a funny outfit and run around dropping stimpacks and molotovs for low levels, like a fuck-em-up fairy. That's always fun
---
I think they want us to be so frustrated will drink irl.
---
Don't worry, Bubbles in my beer already does that.
---
Isn't licence for music limited to "date of death" + 70 years? We are in 2019, which means every song whose singer died before 1949 is copyleft. A bet a lot of them could fit fallout universe theme.
---
Superhero Drop In.  Definitely, superhero drop!
---
Now that I'm paying attention to it, I'm finding stuff everywhere.   I discovered like ten wild blackberry nodes right next to my house this morning lol
---
Short answer is yes. 
---
There's already extensive research on subjects such as this from FO4. This game uses a lot of the same stats, numbers, and mechanics as FO4.
---
Here a link but you can do further research yourself.

---
Maybe 10 caps for "stealing", and 100 for aggression. Most of the time I see a wanted person and just notice how low the bounty is. Like, I think it would be fun to hunt wanted, but the caps are just too low. 
---
GTA actively encourages it, absolutely. If you're doing something on the server it actually *tells* me to ruin your experience. Tbh it's amazing there's not even more problems. That's just legit gameplay too. Modders on PC making everybody have ferris wheels in their apartments or having 100 NPC copies of you attacking you randomly. Never mind actual players on oppressors.
---
I wouldn't worry about this game becoming GTA. It's has a different demographic and shares very little in terms of... well anything.
---
Found BoS Torso plan in a shed in either the mire or savage devide like a week ago. I totally forgot where i found it lol
---
^this too!   Blue Grass is old, sometimes very dark, and well.... Murder Ballads!!
---
Can‚Äôt pick walls either 
---
The song that was in fallout 4 wanderer

Northwest corner of the Morgantown airport has a decent farm too, just inside the fence. 
---
It takes like 10 seconds.  plenty of time to loot and scoot
---
Next you‚Äôll say stop the SB queen from moving around, it‚Äôs very frustrating that I can‚Äôt keep shooting her in the face. The robots are so nice and easy to kill, nobody ever complained about it yes? 
---
Overheating? check heat sinks.
---
Where is the keypad door?
---
Interesting! I'll give them another shot... Few months ago at least I tested them with friends and even people out of the team could open the door without the code.
---
I agree. There should be real joinable ingame factions with faction rewards as well. Maybe if you wear a faction uniform or a specific full armor set then you gain a small stat boost or access to a specific faction radio signal or faction events or something. ü§î
---
THIS. Died three times yesterday taking on legendary robots in Watoga as a melee build with an instigating axe so I pretty much one hit all the robots in the area. Took at least five minutes to find the loot once and for the third one I didn't even bother because it was in AMS HQ and pretty sure the corpse either despawned or flew into a wall when I came back to find my loot bag.
---
Man, I never even thought of this.  Thanks!
---
Holding out hope that we get this in the future, myself 
---
Yeah I wanted to test it out more but I was too busy brewing lol.  Lemme know if you discover anything xD
---
Thanks very much!
---
Thanks
---
We already have swing and doo-wop, and...there really isn‚Äôt much else left to add once you include westerns. 
---
No, I've never heard of that. However, anything prior to I believe 1922 is now automatically available for free. 
---
Copyrights are held by publishers or writers, not necessarily singers. Most times it's a publishing house (Warner, BMI, etc) that holds the rights. It's entirely possible for an artist to see very little profit from licensing depending on how their contract is set up.
---
There are also different kinds of licenses for different types of distribution whether it be TV, movies, video games, etc. Some are restricted to a time limit and others to format. 
---
One example is, a filmmaker could get a license for a popular song to put in their film for film festivals only, but if the film gets picked up for release, they need a new license which would cost significantly more.
---
Edited
---
Thanks for not lashing out when I defend having raiders ingame. I'm not a raider myself but I do know they are supposed to be in the game.
---
Still hasn't come back. I've given up on it. I put in a ticket with Bethesda. Maybe they can figure it out, or at least give me something for my trouble.
---
About the same I out in every game.  200-300 hours nonstop then I just quit and return to it casually during/after updates.   Which is why I'm reading this Reddit now, because of the update. Lol
---
Hoping 8th try is the charm atmosphere lol. Where the fuck did you find paladin paint?!!!
---
Dude happened to me and my friend i sever hopped from 5 in the after noon to 3 in the morning and couldn't get the key piece's 
---
Sorry about your luck.
---
The items will remain until taken, server resets, or that specific item's loot table is refreshed.  It was the same in Fallout 4.   You could place your items in any container and it would be fine most of the time, but if you left it in after a reload or really long period of time it would reset and populate random items - depending on the type of container.  This is why they tell you in both game that your own boxes are the safest.
---
a couple pieces of t-51 lvl 30 and the rest was lvl 15 raider armor. the weapon was the all rise hammer and a laser scatter gun with a gamma mod for burn damage
---

Playful Seeecrets ;) and Yeah GL! If you wanna see it check my recent post's little lackluster to some I bet but I love it!
---
That's like over 300 days. I doubt anyone will be getting it for a while.
---
It happens to me since I use a sniper, but then farm low leveled scorch for the .308 rounds. And the drop lots of hunting rifles. And then I equip the wrong rifle. 
---
Diabolically hilarious prank.
---
It's from my own experiments, there is a chance a mess up something or it was changed in patches as i tested it 3 months ago
---
Yeah I did the card &gt; key thing in one go. Got no problem, took my time since I don't have marsupial serum. Took about 10 min and saw no other players, on a full xbox server..
---
Once I got the key, I knew I was alright since it's just a matter of finding the plan on your server dome. 
---
tldr: People, get the key. you will be safe and have it forever. That goes for all the keys :P
---
I know it's a tad out-of-period (1971, same year as Country Roads), but Paradise by John Prine would fit this game *so god damned well.*
---
This update really made me sad... didn‚Äôt add really much content at all in my opinion, I mean I haven‚Äôt played more than 4-5 hours but there isn‚Äôt anything I see from it that makes me want to do anything apart from my routine legendary /vendor cap farm and then logging
---
And plz delete the Beach Boys.
---
Check under the trifolded flag. It was hidden for me under other junk items. 
---
The red paint is in another dome.....
---
&gt;If you crash or log out, any junk left in the world that was not in your Stash or character   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;inventory  
---
&gt; will be lost.¬†"
---
This statement isnt saying things instantly delete when you log out, but acts more as a precaution warning that your items are not guaranteed to be there.   
---
I have seen items I have dropped stay for hours on the train tracks. Long after my mule account was offline, while I was playing on my main.
---
darn people.. and it would take less time for them to do it legit. If they do it on a server opening a door, the chances of it being empty are bigger
---
‚ÄòWalking After Midnight‚Äô would obviously be my nocturnal sandman sniper‚Äôs favorite tune. And I agree, The Beach Boys is a bit of a hard transition... though I do understand why they might‚Äôve picked that song, since it‚Äôs about being ‚Äúfinally together,‚Äù and in this sense the unofficial theme song of a multiplayer 76
---
this needs to be in next patch
---
Sooo... what‚Äôs the point of there being (at least) two variations of it?
---
Getting upset over downvotes shows you're easily frustrated, not just from the game.
---
Thats.. actually let me see into this. I never bothered to check my temps. Hold on.
---
Also, in all the other related threads I can find there seems to be no solution yet, so it seemed double appropriate to post a new thread about the issue.
---
My keypad door works. I‚Äôm not sure about the keypad switched pylon though. I know it used to be broken and could be switched even without entering the code
---
Fantastic
---
Would be nice if we could set our workshop to have our plan, so people with access to our benches can "use" our plan.
---
Happens to me all the time, mostly when getting in and out of PA, also my hot key resets every time I log in to play and i have to reset it. The struggle is real.
---
Noise Marine is coming! 
---
Nice! Hope getting the power armour plans goes as smoothly
---
Got any screenshots? I gotta see this 
---
Very rare only one plan per server and most of them have been snatched up, besides its 750 caps
---
They really should up the Atoms Rewards for that
---
I don‚Äôt care about imaginary internet points, I simply don‚Äôt understand what was SO wrong about what I wrote in that comment, nothing more. 
---
validate game files if on PC
---
People who build the concrete bases usually just go into build mode and remove a foundation to get in and then put it back. 
---
I could just be denser than a chest mod, but I can't find these stupid things. I've crossed oceans of servers scanning all known and reported locations and zilch. It is shocking. If you've got one or more in your inventory and you can spare them, I'll buy it at a high price.
---
Yeah, the flag was there the first time I hit the spot today, and I grabbed it to check - no card. And now that I picked up the other junk there, there is no more flag. Just a bare floor, with only keycard 01 showing in my inventory.
---
I fully expect your enjoyment of the game to increase significantly as a result of your change in outlook.
---
When you look at each player encounter as a high possibility of PvP and look forward to it, the suspense and thrill elevate the game experience to new levels.
---
Inventory management is critical for the chance of player encounters.  I don‚Äôt like losing my junk to other players, so I do what I must to protect it.  
---
In every example of post-apocalyptic or collapse of society I‚Äôve read or watched, I‚Äôve never encountered a happy, cooperative, risk-free scenario.  The Rule of Law is gone.  Your neighbor may become your deadly rival.
---
Just make slap damage always 5 damage instead of a percentage. It's not hard.
---
Used as a game time record.
---
Hmm strange , it worked for me. But the quest giver is buged, takes several tries to get quest and to leave quest. But i guess it could be that he is drunk too ;)
---
Which platform you on? 
---
I don'y think it's wise to do silos at this level.
---
Hit Uranium Fever for the loot heavy mole miner mega spawn.
---
Last night they were exploding instantly after death for me. As soon as the final shot hits them, boom and gone.  Happend with at least 4 lengendarys 
---
I beleive cushioned mod for legs helps with sprinting.

You can't drop or store keys. Once you get them, they are yours forever. I have a number of duplicates and triplicates and i can't even get rid of the extras.
---
i cant stream this game with the radio on lol
---
What do these look like I may have the suit already
---
Dunno in fallout76 but in F4 they use script extender (fase) so any mod or fix they do, Bethesda can't because they need to work with the original code and not these patches above the game with these scripts. It's not like they don't care but they need to find their fix
---
Next update: wheelchair access ramps to all public places. :3
---
The Brotherhood quest will take you there, and you'll get full access to it as you complete the questline.
---
I think the effects stack if you equip both since they are technically different perk cards. I haven't tested this but that would be my guess. 
---
Been happening on PC for months, had two weeks off so will try again after game updates, hope they fixed it.
---
Yeah, just went back to try again for the red paint and realized it was 07, not 03. I think I may have unwittingly stolen it from someone else. :-/
---
Well, it was not that slowly either, as I said numerous times by now. What you obviously didn‚Äôt read either is the part where I froze and being an unyielding built. Why is it so hard to believe that? It definitely took no 5 minutes, neither did it happen in only cafes seconds. 
---
At least they'll be adding content weekly now. There's loads of unreleased content in the game files.
---
Ok thanks, and how do you start the brotherhood quest
---
I would really like more of a rock/rockabilly station on the radio 
---
\^\^This, annoying but not game breaking.
---
Asking the real questions!
---
Was lucky enough to get the plans today. I had lost hope after constantly running into people and already open doors. 
---
But I just happened to try again and even though the door was open and the Dome had been looted, the plans were there! Huzzah!!
---
Indeed I agree. Me and many others have tried very hard to help aj with his stash, when I met him he was at full cap over-encumbered which I believe is 1500 lbs. sat with him for about 3 hours going through his inventory till he was 1lb under his weight and he was so happy coz he could actually fast travel,
---
He‚Äôs got better but when he finds a legendary that he doesn‚Äôt want, he would rather try give it to someone else instead of a vendor, which is another reason he has so much shit. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt care if they charged for additional radio stations. At least you could have good stuff playing depending on your preferences 
---
Yeah. People are stupid and greedy. That's humanity. GG
---
If anyone in the server grabbed it, just server hop, luckily I finished all of it in one run!
---
Yes they‚Äôve nerfed everything. If something is mentioned here, players will go there to farm in droves, so something has to be done to discourage that. From a dev point of view they want players to spread out and play all places not just camping in one location and raking in all the Legendaries. 
---
Yes I can confirm westek sucks, awol now gives me nothing but wooden legs and stalkers walking canes valued at less than 20 caps, watoga bots loots are always one star no matter how many stars they show, and mostly garbage armors and rolling pins. If you read it here, they‚Äôll nerf it, period. They spread out Legendaries so you just need to go to random places. 
---
Yesterday during the hunt for the nuka cola paint I came across a three star glowing wolf in the Mire area which I never go for farming, it dropped a level 50 three star Regenerating Sentinel combat armor, much better than the stuff I‚Äôve been getting from ws ghouls and watoga bots lately. 
---
750 hours, still enjoy the game and a big fallout fan.  If you like this style of game, then there is plenty to do.  Play on xbox and have few issues.
---
It doesnt seem to be overheating. The temps go up to 60¬∞, but no overheating so far.
---
Downloading 50GB takes like 30 Minutes ... I download with 40MB/sec ;P
---
The hot fix was so those locked out of the game entirely could access it again, aka fixing what they epicly just had broke. It wasnt as much to tweak the drinks themselves, outside of the fact it was the station and drinks causing the game breaking glitch/bug.  If the hotix wasnt fixed as quickly as they could, it would have ended with anyone who used a camp and fermenter being completely locked from the game.  That's kinda a priority over User Interface quality of live improvements.
---
well shit, must be the patch
---
Ah and juat 1 crimson flux short of making it too... damn. Got the plans though. 
---
Elevensies? Man im hungry
---
Restart your game. I had that happen to me at whitespring station on PS4 
---
it seems all steps need to redo again.. my ID cards are all gone after server hopping
---
Aaaahhhh. I didn't realize that he gave quests out
---
When I went next to Dyer Chemical at night I was able to find about 6 of them. It could have been 8 but 1 wasen't blooming and 1 was bugged. Heart of the Swamp event wasen't active at the time and I'm unsure if it was active before I went in the area.
---
Yeah, they're ramping up the difficulty on the dailies/weeklies. Remember when you'd get 30 atoms from just scrapping 3 bulked junk items in a day. I think it partly has to do with the fact that they've got lower prices for new atom shop items. 
---
If it's a quest to craft alcohol already found in the world, buying it from a vendor \*cough\* whitesprings upstairs bartender \*cough\* will get you completion on it. Probably not intended but hey I'm not complaining
---
Half the time you have to drink it and do something while under the influence so buy a handful if you can
---
I've hopped a dozen times already, no luck.
---
What system?
---
ps4
---
Some new locations for current and future quests, the Wasted On Nukashine quest and the repeatable daily quests, small bits and pieces, some 'secret' items, heavy weapons have been buffed... 
---
Sorry if this isnt explained well but I haven't played 76 in a long while. There is a farmhouse really close to vault 76 and a note upstairs mentions a place called Abby's Bunker and marks it on your map, go there (its towards the top right of the map). This place is connected to the free states questline, but you want to use Abby's terminal. There is one entry about the BoS, reading that will start the BoS questline. Follow that questline to get into fort defiance. The location of defiance is towards the bottom of the Savage Divide, slightly north of the tall monorail location, it's hard to miss.
---
It was a glitch and patched out. Existing CAMPs can stay but you can't move them and maintain the placement glitch.
---
How do you get it?
---
Of course that would be CPU &amp; GPU temps to check. That seems perfectly fine if  60¬∞, validating game files in Bethesda Launcher would be another Captain Obvious suggestion.
---
Close out any other applications you can before trying again.
---
Yeah, it's not a lot.  But the brewing is a cool feature to start things off at least.   We will see if they can keep up with the content add ons.
---
The other people that have had this bug said it eventually works, so I'm just going to keep trying.
---
That sounds like it's the copyright duration.
---
Licences are for whatever the business arrangement is.  Could be a day, a year, or the duration of the game's life.
---
IIRC some remakes of games have even had trouble securing the music used in the original.
---
Updated above.
---
That's actually still there. 
---
Updated the original post above.
---
At the time there was over $700 of stuff in the shop. Plenty of people were out of free atoms. And we were posting bug reports. They just weren‚Äôt getting fixed.
---
Like I said, I already have the skin, and would absolutely want it rereleased or put in game to be earned like half the atomic shop should be.
---
Don't know why I'm so fascinated with trying to explain all this everyday, at least 3 times a day to everyone who gets traumatized by griefers, I guess because this topic is the biggest discussion on all the forums about 76 and has been the subject of much lively and spirited debate.  I'll skip all the point by point analysis and simply say: "Changes are in the works, be patient, it will all work out in the end!"  
---
That's awesome! I wonder if this means that mole miners mated with mole rats... Don't like the implications of that!
---
Yes they now have triple shot explosive guns 
---
(There's a mod for that)[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/637/]
---
As far as I know it‚Äôs still in the game, I don‚Äôt think Bethesda can do much to stop it without overhauling the collision interaction that is to say I can‚Äôt be sure as I haven‚Äôt built any concerts structures recently but generator is sill enclosed in concrete and punji boards. 
---
By the way, you‚Äôve never actually need a campfire you can do the same thing with a carpet or lamp. Fires are just cheap and have other uses. 
---
It's the quest where you learn a new recipe, craft it, and then bring it to Biv for him to test.
---
So you're telling me if I buy it, it counts (for the quest) as crafting it? Because I picked one up that I found spawned in the world after I got the quest, and it didn't register that.
---
I had my base there too! I was wondering why i got relocated. Nice
---
I've done that, and it was playing fine, up until I had to fast travel somewhere and the game just decided to close on it's own and open discord for some reason
---
That‚Äôs fair enough. I‚Äôve only become wanted by accident cos when I see other players my first thought is to wave hello lol
---
Oxhorn, a youtuber, had the same problem on his stream the other day, but managed to fix it 
---
Discord LOL, the game wants in on your hot gaming chat :)
---
Thanks for the feedback. I guess I just gotta do some extra server hopping.
---
The samsquanch!
---
Reduced falling damage lol 
---
Still I wouldn‚Äôt mind that 
---
Unpopular opinion: everyone in 76 is dead, who would be changing radio songs? My head space just says it got left on loop before they succumb to their eventual demise.
---
That said, a quest line to change/add songs, or even a player run radio station would be spectacular. 
---
I mean nobody forces you to read secret quest items guides on reddit if you don't want to know. 
---
Had to log off, sorry!
---
Back up your *Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76* (with all the ini files) and then delete your ini files and try starting and running game with the default replacements the game will create. 
---
Made a few caps from this paint by skinning people's Xo1 just doing my bit 
---
The old blackbird skin on jet pack t-60 is basically raven guard.
---
For the sake of rping, yeah. When I feel like being goofy I put in a pastors vestment and a foil hat and preach the word of God. I'm trying to figure out a good segway into being a little "child of atom". 
---
lmao probably 
---
You may be the first ever.  
---
I've seen it work from either buying it or having someone drop it in a bag and picking it up.
---
Had three nuke zones yesterday. A Whitesprings nuke, a random fissure site for some reason and a Queen fight.
---
Did you already complete mistaken identity before the patch?
---
I go with bloodied heavy weps and post-patch I'm finding the minigun suddenly kicks ass.  It still chews through ammo, but now it chews through enemies with ease.  Yard trash is mowed down, scorchbeasts can be killed before they pull themselves out of the fissure.
---
The gatling laser has been very underwhelming, same perks/health &amp; bloodied yet it's showing half the damage of the minigun and I'm not sure why.  They're both relatively standard, not prime or anything.
---
I think stabilized also has a big impact since it doesn't help energy weapons.  So right now all of the ballistic heavy weapons are pretty good, and the energy (laser &amp; plasma) are lackluster.
---
Though the improved durability is very awesome.
---
Yes and next to the front entrance (if you were to spawn to the resort) there's a stairway that leads to a path to other side of resort..at the bottom of the stairs there's 7 or 8aster flowers ..with green thumb equipped that's a decent amount 
---
I'll follow suit anyone on Xbox wanting Xo1 or T-51 Quantum feel free to message me ApologiseMeow 
---
You have to finish the raider's quest line at "The Top of the World", then go to "Abby's Bunker" finish their quest line.  Then you finally get to go to "Fort Defiance" and do the Brotherhood quest line.  Should note, there aren't really factions like the previous Fallout games, you can "join" all of them, but you're just doing some quests for them.  More like an errand boy really.
---
I just wish the paired keywords were 1 time only so I could stop picking them up, using them, and having spent 60 caps travelling for nothing. At least if I couldn't find the fist key I'd know someone was already running through that server. I try to leave doors open along the way to warn anyone behind me on the server to just jump then and now. 
---
Had one on PS4 last night around 11pm, eastern time.
---
I'm on PC and I'll do it for free. 
---
Just fixed myself, updated above.
---
Thanks friend
---
My god you beautiful genius thank you 
---
Isn't fissure for the queen? I must have been unlucky in my server hops..and none of them had glowing ones which would have indicated that the server previously had a nuke zone..I guess I've been really unlucky..usually takes maybe 2 or 3 hops to get a zone
---
I‚Äôve got my camp here but you put it to shame.  Funny thing is I was there weeks before I noticed the acid vent!
---
Nuclear Winter is coming...
---
Also curious. 
---
I thought they nerfed legendary spawns too, but on my last Watoga EMS run I found a 3 star mutie. He dropped a drill. I was happy to be bummed
---
I get a lot of caps when I raid alone, but sometimes you lose the tracks of your prey when you fast travel from the workshop to his actual location.
---
With a friend usually it gets more proficuous, you are better organized and can target stronger players.
---
In a squad of 3/4 players you get few caps, in this situation we usually get a bounty on the lowest level and use him as bait with high level players, or groups.
---
I'm not going to lose caps killing low levels or getting a huge bounty for a destroyed Camp (one of us always keep his account at 0 caps so he can fast travel to a friend for free and destroy everything he wants).
---
I'd suggest just keeping your camp away from in-game locations. Build something in the woods of the beaten path.
---
For energy the Gatling plasma is good.  Haven‚Äôt tried the Gatling laser myself.  Stabilized helps the Minigun a lot.  Can‚Äôt tell you if Bloodied is scaling right with energy though.
---
PS4
---
120 hours or so split between at launch and in the last week. I've really enjoyed my experience, I'm at a point where it's just a relaxing chill out game to put on in the evening and play for a few hours. 
---
Verticality isn't taken into account for enemy alertness only distance is. 
---
If one enemy sees you usually the entire building will be alerted to your presence and location.
---
Well sometimes the Scorchbeast doesn‚Äôt even spawn at all. 
---
Did you complete Death from Above for yourself quest first ?
---
Yep and I was on at the time ..I was disconnected from the server several times yesterday ..at least I kno they are back..just not as frequent ..my alt is level 44 need to get them leveled up
---
Yeah it looks amazing 
---
Had they added anyone since launch. The  soundtrack was Very short on release.
---
Log in and see!
---
Lame. 
---
I wreck people CAMPS, Farm players for CAPS, and PvP everyone on the map. Thats what I do. It isnt "greifing" its part of the game. Its not personal. 
---
Could you imagine if i had a buddy friend someone so i could jump into a world just to target them?
---
Thats harassment and its against the terms. Your breaking the rules FYI. The guy you met wasnt breaking the rules. So why are you mad???
---
I think what I do isnt wrong. What OP suggests is. Do you guys see the difference? 
---
Or would it be ok for me to keep a list of igns... Have my buddys try to friend them then jump into servers to target them?
---
No it wouldn't. Its wrong. You should have fought them when you had the chance. 
---
They did a hot fix for the silo cool downs taking 300hrs? I didn't hear about it. 
---
Actually I think it‚Äôs more likely for them to introduce a subscription service to support the game in the future.
---
If not temps or hardware is must be software, either the game or OS has somehow become corrupted. If your internet speeds are reasonable reinstall the game, but I'd also refresh or reinstall the OS first, presuming you are running Windows 10, it's pretty straight forward.
---
Obviously, back up, back up, back up important data first.
---
Killed the SBQ twice since the patch, both times succeeded. You really need several people armed with explosive heavy weapons such as 50 cal and gat and hammer her non stop to be able to take her down. Even better if the weapons are primed. It‚Äôs not for pew-pew semi-autos and casual players. Not even for explosive shotguns because of the range limit. The rewards are ok so far, better than the tire irons and golf clubs I used to get. Got an instigating sniper rifle yesterday. 
---
I don't get to play but a few hours a week.  My main is 24...
---
I have 325 hours on my main, can't remember how much my beta character has. I'm pretty happy with the game. Yeah the new patch didn't put much in, but I'm looking forward to then next ones. Backpacks, new quests, vaults opening up. It's gonna be fun. And it was cool checking out the new vault door added into the forest (no number on it, just purple missing texture). How much you like the game depends on how you play. I revisit locations and re-explore areas. Just be careful out there in the wastes. Not all players play nice (had a guy walk up to my camp and they just started shooting at it). And pick your perk points wisely as once you're level 50 it will be hard to change your character build (level and moving a point, over and over).
---
East of the tower 
---
How did you fix it?
---
I love messing with the super mutants there..that shack has good loot inside too
---
Of course!  It‚Äôs the Power Armor.  I use it mostly to fast travel when overburdened so I had assumed it was a fast travel bug. 
---
And hot keys are a hot mess, so I gave them up months ago
---
Your dumb
---
I'll do it for PC as well
---
Thanks for the solid information 
---
Old comment but I was hoping this wasn't the only one this happened to. I hit the button, one whole scorched appeared which I killed straight away (I'm like level 16). Then I just walked out the other way and it was completely empty. Very anticlimactic.
---
I like the outfit though.
---
i can't do anything, as soon as i spawn i fall in the void, when i teleport to a location, i can walk for 5 meters then fall in the ground. It's no fixed (tried 3 days ago) , i didnt try today tho
---
I paid straight out of pocket, no credit card.
---
Basically PayPal. I didnt make things up, the dispute asks for a reason why I want a refund, and the option I chose was "Product not usable", which is true since I have the product but cant use it.
---
the game is angry at me for playing apex i guess xDDD
---
Yeah I'll probably reinstall my OS, this has been happening a lot and I just want to fix this. I just never knew how I can do this, but I'll look around. And should I just put my important data on an external hard drive and then put it back in later? Would that even work?
---
Just fissure prime in the Cranberry Bog will summon the Queen. The fissure site that was nuked was the southern most one in the Savage Divide.
---
I dont think its fraud. I used PayPal, and I disputed the charge saying that the product was not useable, which is true since I have the product but cant use it.
---
You farm players for their hard earned junk and caps and YOUR taking the moral high ground? Take a walk buddy.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs where you find the alien blaster pistol 
---
Same on xbox1x, and PC. Quest is broken af
---
Forest camo jumpsuit? They go for 8k
---
Data miners ruined a cool Easter egg experience and produced a video showing us all how to hop around the map collecting key cards and get a new xo1 nuka quantum paint.
---
It can be opened. There's a keypad next to it and you can find the code hidden nearby. There's unique loot inside.
---
It‚Äôs perfect for 76. I hadn‚Äôt really used the radio feature much until we got them in our CAMPs so I heard it for the first time in game the other day. Made me day. 
---
ive had that happen before try reloging it helped me
---
I wish I could say I found it that way. I found it on the map, but the water makes it one of a kind. It is a little out of the way though. I hope I can attract enough travellers to my vendors.
---
Why not just launch your own? 
---
Three variations, and it's to give flexibility in your build.  You can take all three ranks in all three levels if you want, or a combination.  Most people take the first rank in each one so you can get 30% damage increase for only 3 slots, as opposed to a 60% increase for taking up nine slots. 
---
I dropped one on WS yesterday around 6:30 pm EST. 
---
I'm late but, if you still need to know.....
---
Blood packs and antiseptic can be farmed by killing ticks. 
---
Some perks I recommend for this would be Butcher's Bounty, Chemist, Super Duper.
---
Butcher's Bounty allows you to "search" the ticks for more tick blood which is used to make blood packs.
---
Chemist for making double stimpacks. 
---
Super Duper for a chance of having double yields when crafting. 
---
For the ticks you can always find some at the Moonshiner's Shack and the Lumbermill that is south of Vault 76.
---
It‚Äôs almost like the game fucking sucks. 
---
I can‚Äôt be the only one that puts on ‚ÄúBulls on Parade‚Äù during this event and sings it as Bots, can I?  Weird Al where are you when we need you...
---
Greifing in fo76 is only:
---
 - Chasing a player into a new server
---
 - verbal harrassment
---
 - threats involving the real world .
---
Literally everything else is fair game, encouraged by developers. Wrecking camps to bait a player into pvp. Slapping people, workshop ganking. Its all fine. I can slap someone for a half hour if i want. Once they use the tools they have to avoid me (server hop) i must stop.  
---
Do u have the healing salves recipe? U could craft them and never worry about stims..which ammo are u using? I can tell u which enemies/areas to get them from
---
Alien Blaster
---
You can‚Äôt just wait for a new person to spawn and have all the ghouls come back to life they‚Äôre on a cycle now. So if I killed ghouls 2 mins ago no one else in the server can. Unless I misunderstood the patch notes 
---
Is it fraud though?
---
My dispute was about the product not being useable. Which is 100% true. Bethesda had 10 days to respond to the dispute and they chose not to, which lead to me winning the dispute and getting my money back.
---
Thanks man!
---
I think I'm just gonna give up. My problem is most likely my CPU and ram. I guess I'll have to upgrade my pc before I get to play this game again.
---
I think this is the rub for getting good stuff in the atom shop:  the free atoms don‚Äôt just happen with 5-10 minutes of work each day + a level up.  Gonna have to work for free atoms now.
---
When the game came out only two dome were accessible, now a new TNT dome has been given content, dome 07.
---
Other than paying for DLC content which is a slightly different thing , my first purchase for in game currency was in Destiny and I felt guilty of all things.  I have since gotten over it.  We or someone who cares about us earns our game currency in one way or another.  By completing a game challenge or completing a report in the real world, it is still "earned".  Don't let others make you feel bad because you spend your money the way you want to.  It's called "Freedom" I could get very political here, but I don't think this is the sub for that, so I'll simply say, "Enjoy your purchase!"
---
It has the best rad resistance of all the armor sets.
---
Your use of the license was revoked by the owner (Bethesda).
---
That would be like refusing to pay the remainder of your lease because you got evicted for setting the building on fire.
---
If you were able to create an account, log in, play the game, you had fair use of the product.
---
Ahh ok
---
Glad I don't really like this paint scheme. I'll do the quest in a week or so when things calm down
---
Absolutely, depends how much of course, USB thumb drive or HDD or online backup service. If Windows 10 and you set up One Drive your documents folder will back up to the cloud anyway and pictures and videos folder, whether you'd need to buy more storage than the (I think) free 5gb will again depend on how much you have sitting on the PC.
---
Good luck, never fun to have to do all this just to play a game.
---
Think about it this way.  Take the first rank in each.  You have 30% damage increase for the cost of three perk cards.  Which is plenty for most content and frees up slots for other cards. 
---
Hey I can help, what‚Äôs ur gt
---
Yes I‚Äôm so bored of listening to the same songs I turn off in game music and play oldies on Spotify lol I shit you not 
---
I look at it this way, if someone whacks/shoots you and you dont engage it's done. For the person to keep doing it, follow you around, basically interfering with your game play then its griefing.
---
If you take a workshop you are asking for pvp, or if you fight back its pvp.
---
Only if you dont engage and they continue then its griefing, and saying it's part of the game is wrong.
---
Report them, block them, and jump servers problem solved.
---
Or build a toon that can fight back and start taking names and get some revenge. 
---
LordRazumdar
---
I have the high ground Anakin. 
---
Bethesda sold me a survival PvP game... I follow the rules... You are literally posting about targeted harassment.
---
I earn my shit by being the baddest raider on any map. I dont need to chase people around servers and harass them. Thats wrong man. 
---
Your in the wrong here. Sorry.
---
Come on, the game was broken from the start. Youre just being blind if youre saying that they were correct to band all those people.
---
Wait, plural? I only knew about the one for the T-51B Nuka paint and this one.
---
Same here.  I picked 72 corn and 72 razor grain and it spoiled after 30 min of gameplay.  I have 196 spoiled veg and 44 spoiled meat, all of which spoiled after 1 hour of gameplay.
---
Also they probably would shy away from still living artists after the Dion drama
---
I suggest the young woman use the emergency call button or phone in the elevator to call for help.
---
You already own and like the game, but you want strangers on the internet to tell you to play it?
---
You may well have to, 8gb is pushing it as this game is no slouch when it comes to size. Your GPU is fine though, no problem there, maybe cut back of texture quality and try hiding the grass. Here are the edits in my *Fallout76Custom.ini*
---
    [Grass]
---
    fGrassStartFadeDistance=1000.0000
---
    fGrassMaxStartFadeDistance=3500.0000
---
    fGrassMinStartFadeDistance=1000.0000
---
    bAllowCreateGrass = 0
---
Killing the grass made all the difference to my lack lustre GPU. And other settings high only.
---
Ray Wylie Hubbard! 
---
I'll look into this then, but I'll definitely have to upgrade it at some point. This has just become unbearable.
---
My bad. There was one that reduces sprint ap usage, I forget what it's called. 
---
Alright I'll be on in a few hours then for the rest of the day msg when your ready
---
I had a full set, seen the stats, and sold it. I found out it is the best non PA if you put dense mods on it.
---
Ive seen a few streamers find the things after 1am game time, and only after fast traveling to the chem plant. But my luck sucks in getting them, too. 
---
I don‚Äôt recommend drinking Nukashine while overencumbered.
---
Good luck mate, new hardware is always fun and is an exciting journey.
---
It sure is! Well, apart from gathering the money, of course
---
Hmm, money, sell a kidney?! :)
---
I‚Äôm not talking about being able to kill, read what I wrote, they explode and rag doll making it unable to locate their remains at times.
---
Vague. 
---
This game is a survival pvp enabled game. What i do is encouraged, intended and constant. Its a path to farm junk and resources available to anyone who wants to be a raider.
---
Its literally not greifing. Its just a playstyle.
---
Lol cause launching nukes suck I personally have only done it once in almost 500 hours of play..honestly I don‚Äôt even go into nuke zones just not worth it to me
---
ü§î
---
Agreed. This is a home run improvement.  Now I can actually see it Haha
---
Yeah never really understood this, other games have a way to convert it to plain text, I forget which game did that, but I would of expected an option to convert it to a much easier to read screen especially for a game to relies on notes.
---
Just confirmed it, very nice :) 
---
Nope just nukashine
---
Kill the grass and experiment with settings @ High to medium. Will be fun to try regardless.
---
What‚Äôs your GT so I can invite you to my team
---
It‚Äôs all good. The lists online are kinda all over the place
---
That's fair if you don't participate in the event yourself.  I just keep seeing a lot of people complaining about not being able to farm them because "no one" is launching nukes.
---
Close to 400
---
But Violet Flux, I just live for Violet Flux :))
---
Or use a doorway/window and then replace with a normal wall after wiring .
---
It's in the edited text of my post above.
---
I think Brad Paisley would make sense as well since he's from Glen Dale West Virginia
---
Give us your home address and I'll send you one ;-)
---
How many technical data did you turn in
---
I've had skeet smarter than you, plebtroll 
---
Ok thanks for the info and effort
---
Sell your laptop and buy a playstation. Problem solved. 
---
I'll join if y'all aren't already full 
---
i don't have mods.
---
even reinstalled game 3 times. checked that all files were deleted.
---
still have all the ini type problems.
---
the reason for my post was to point out the none-obvious which is shown in picture number two.
---
the circuit is going through THREE walls using TWO passthrough conduits. the walls to the left and to the right are passed using passthrough conduits, but the wall in the middle is passed using a normal inhouse conduit.
---
Ha thank you
---
Thanks for all your suggestions!
---
If the bathroom door is picked and opened at the nuka cola plant then hop server until you find the unpicked locked bathroom door.

Nexus mods are your friend, unless you are on console... then :(

There we go, I found it. It's called "custom fitted" for leg armor and it reduces sprint ap drain. I was close! 
---
I just lost glowing meat steaks, spoiled in 30 minutes I can‚Äôt gather or cook and eat fast enough to keep up....
---
None of its greifing. 
---
I got a vintage tick blood tequila as a mission reward so there is that one aswell
---
Yeah I would think that eventually if they aren‚Äôt making enough money they would shut down new content for it
---
There's something very interesting about the design of the game. Most online games like this are designed to keep the player coming back every day and stay playing via grindy missions, resource caps, faction grinding, and other methods. Fallout 76 seems to be designed not to do this. The Brewers quest has a daily to get each alcoholic plan, but it's trivial. There's atom challenges, but everything is cosmetic so it's not a big draw for me at least.
---
Other games would have introduced a brand new alcohol crafting material you can only get from a boss and also the material only drops 33% of the time. But in Fallout 76 you do the quest and you're making beer immediatly, no need to wait.
---
I wonder if they will continue doing this. If so, I wonder why they are making the game non-grindy when compared to other online games. Online games live on keeping player counts high and grind is how they all do it these days. I'm not complaining, I like that they are not turning new content into a horrific grind feat.
---
I‚Äôve never seen that one but thanks for letting me know I was uninformed 
---
May have forgotten the install location, reinstall but remember to point the game at the default location, hopefully still existing game folder.
---
Presuming you are on PC.
---
Try a full shut down and database rebuild, it could be a corrupted file. 
---
Ok sure my gt is on the other comment 
---
Near that little river, Oh..

Mr cash would be an excellent addition as well as an outfit of the man in Black!

Just don't look it up and avoid spoilers... sorted.

50gb download is a big deal for some people. I've been waiting all morning to see the new patch, and here I am, while it's still downloading, wanting to read about what's different from 2 months ago.
---
It's weird because some of them are really bright and clear, and others are super dark and grungy to the point of illegibility. I like that they're trying to make them look different depending on materials/location etc but they need to do something like add the text to the data tab on the pipboy or something, because otherwise I'm missing lore.
---
What I was saying is that people will always complain about certain difficulties in the game. The bots are so easy to kill nobody ever thanked the dev for that. Now they added a small challenge everyone is moaning about it lol. Yes I got killed by an exploding bot too after the patch and another one landed on a rooftop where I can‚Äôt reach, but it‚Äôs just an in-game mechanic that we need to deal with as players. 
---
Oops
---
Definitely worth it 
---
I use the Excavator with calibrated shocks because I'm always getting overencumbered lol
---
Yea definitely makes flora hunters‚Äô lives easier! 
---
Cool I‚Äôll have to check it out.
---
Thanks for your advice.
---
Yea I‚Äôve been able to read 1 or 2 so far lol just give me an old gamer mode that makes them look new or something.
---
Yep on PS4 and not easily mod‚Äôable  :D 
---
No, go away
---
Just sharing my findings! I‚Äôm sure there will be more :) 
---
...its hard work. üòÜ
---
You don't see timers on the map. I fast traveling to events all the time just to have them end as soon as I get there. Waste of time and caps.
---
Visit Detroit while wearing a clown suit, good luck finding a Wendigo.

Super Mutants are asexual, so he probably just doesn't know there's a difference. Or maybe he was raised by Centaurs and just assumes Chally has a bunch of penises?

lololol

If you can take junk and server hop, then I can hop after you to get it back. 
---
And if someone I know happens to have you in their friends list?
---
Like at what point does harassment, griefing or a fair raiding cross into one another. 
---
Do you think the people you grief and raid are happy at the end of it? No their ass just got raided. 
---
They think what you do is harassment. 
---
Don‚Äôt try make me feel guilty for raiding a raider.
---
Coz if the tables were turned and u seen me online on a different server, your ass would be on me quicker than the server knew wtf was going on.
---
So don‚Äôt give me ur troll shit.
---
I haven't been able to. Launch bug . But I've seen a couple nuke zones yesterday 
---
How did you get that power armor station paint
---
peeps gettin stable flux off the black market
---
Haha awesome. So these mods have to be bought I‚Äôm assuming?
---
Didn't know they changed the nuked flora look.
---
Ring of Fire would be great! YES PLEASE!
---
So get rid of the need on TSE weapons that was done to make things fair if you aren't going to nerf other weapons. It's silly that people can be shot in the head with explosive weapons and then kill people in power armor with one punch.
---
It is really good armor. I have a set of sentinel and it's very good 
---
I assume everyone who does the half wit "everything is literal" thing is just lying.
---
450hrs.
---
So that's why Morgantown gets nuked
---
Yup, happened to me while trying to drink purified water from my inventory. And happened again when trying to use radaway at a SBQ fight. 
---
Only if you wanna work on your camp.
---
You can add a distillery and a fermenter, but it will only add a little bit of fun. The patch take over an hour depending on your pc.
---
Due to time restrictions you can only progress with the current quest line for all recipes one day at a time üòê
---
Yes they literally glow now, it‚Äôs a big help for flash fern because they were really dark in the past and hard to differentiate from ordinary mutated ferns. 
---
some heros don't wear capes.
---
I don‚Äôt get u
---
Not necessarily. I've attained this mod from repeatedly crafting lv 1 leg armor with super duper and then scrapping it all to learn the mods. It works, however certain armor like trapper is quite resource heavy to craft. I never thought I would wish I had more rubber. 
---
Yeah the other night it told me I had a 40 hour cool down.  Tried again the very next day and was able to launch it. Bug is stupid but it only happened once to me and it was a lie.
---
Seriously. They need to update this playlist. I like it don‚Äôt get me wrong but they need to add and subtract some music. Please Bethesda? Please?
---
It seems even at whitesprings the enemies don't respawn as much as they used to
---
They can kill you if they get one of their friends to claim a workshop you own across the map and the other guy follows you around.
---
^ That shit needs fixing. Workshop pvp should be limited to the workshop zone. Period.
---
This is my build pretty much done, but I have a friend I always team with who shares max Nerd Rage as well.

Even the 1050Ti will run it at much better fps than the PS4. I see 20 odd PS4 crash posts everyday, I have crashed like twice or thrice since launch on my laptop.
---
Yep, Fort Defiance is definitely bugged. I've had a Wendingo put me in caution when I'm on the third floor. They've even teleported to my floor. My favourite was the invincible Rad Roach that followed me up the lift.
---
I had the 190+ cooldown but yesterday's hot fix corrected it. I was able launch 2 yesterday on Xbox. 
---
Fallout 76 has always been worth it to me.  Sure, there are issues with it, but with 144 hours in the game, I‚Äôve received my money‚Äôs worth several times over.
---
That‚Äôs the thing that irritates me when I‚Äôm beat up with broken equipment and overloaded, dragging my limping ass along. I come across a home, but it‚Äôs locked up.
---
Like, what the fuck purpose does this serve? I always use the ‚Äúguest bed‚Äù if they have one. I always close the door. I always leave something. All you‚Äôve done is unnecessarily deny an innocent player a helping hand, because any other type of player will just blow your wall open and use it anyway.
---
I‚Äôm not, so I limp away frustrated. It‚Äôs enough to hope a selfish asshole griefer comes along and destroys the selfish asshole recluse.
---
What are the effects?
---
Okay so bare with me here. First off, I recommend reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), the OP is an absolute hero, who has worked with this engine modding and ect. since skyrim, and fallout 4 as well.
---
For a TDLR, delete your current preset files from config (under my games fallout 76 generally) with the game turned off. Then boot up the game, Select Full-screen, and the Medium graphics preset. Then from there you can change some settings like textures, however make sure shadow distance is set to low, and DO NOT TOUCH ANY FADE SLIDERS.
---
Basically, the presets for High and Ultra aren't meant for 60fps gaming, they're there for cinematography and ect. The OP of that post I linked explains how the medium preset for fallout 76 actually sets values higher than ultra fallout 4, to put it in perspective. So when you're using the medium preset, then for instance upping texture quality to ultra, you're getting the same visual experience as running it on the ultra preset, except ultra runs in general 15-30 fps slower ESPECIALLY in places like harper's ferry.
---
Hope this helps man, I've dropped the same knowledge bomb like 5 times in 3 days, thinkin' this stuff needs to be in a sticky thread.  
---
Follow these steps as well and I figure you can probably run low-medium. 
---
Ur google broke?
---
Depends on how many plans your have discovered before treasuring hunting. When I first started going for the treasure I wasn‚Äôt a big collector of plans. So I got a lot of ones I never had. But now I get a lot of duplicates and usually a worthless weapon or two.
---
If you were being honest, you'd also mention how ps4 fallout 76 runs much worse than pc. but hey, can't fanboy for a massive corporate unfeeling entity if you actually used facts. 
---
Your face would be if you spoke like that to me irl bitch.
---
But nah, tbh just want the patch notes in broad strokes.

Dude with a deathclaw gauntlet and a couple of his friends tore up my buddy's brand new camp site until there was literally nothing left but the foundation. We didn't care so much since our mutations make us virtually immune to slap damage as long as we don't engage, and we likely already had enough materials to just fix everything afterwards. Still, it was clear that these guys were just running around with a suspicious quantity of extremely OP equipment, just trying to ruin someone's day (even if it wasn't ours).  It just shouldn't be that easy to demolish camp after camp and still be so easily untouchable.
---
(Unfortunately, my buddy DID have his day ruined literally moments later when the server crashed and the game failed to replace anything but the basic camp unit upon our return. Camp actually gone for good after all that, but simply because the game just randomly up and f-ed up and nothing to do with the greifers. That really sucked.)
---
where do u found it?
---
Random is random.
---
I would like to see perk loadouts tho.
---
&gt;http://imgur.com/a/sZzEFVu
---
This is true. In my early fo76 days I got rekted in workshops by assasins/sentinel armored players so I decided that when they try again atleast I will be ready for it. Also the PvP servers are coming so it will be interesting to see if this setup is viable in there
---
Right? Once your build is done, solo nuke launches are a literal cakewalk, and good exp. People are just lazy and want to mooch off others I guess.
---
I think this particular choice has to do with the actual lyrics of the song.

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long?

Right on. Feel free to hit me up for grouping or trading if you fell like it. I always enjoy folks and helping out with quest.
---
WTF are you eating to crap 200 pieces of armor?  Also RIP poop chute.
---
I‚Äôm going to disagree with you on on some of that the exploding part and dying isn‚Äôt an issues that‚Äôs expected and acceptable is just that if they didn‚Äôt rag doll when they explode. If they explode and stay where they are at no issues it‚Äôs them flying.
---
Yea just check your default 76 Directory, if its still there, you just install it in the same place, and the launcher won't actually re-install it, it will just use the already downloaded games. The launcher likes to forget where it put 76 from time to time for some reason

No. I'm not asking for repeatable immediately, if you read what I wrote. I want to be able to play one quest per day without having to wait until 11:30 pm. Do you understand?

You're projecting.

That would be fine to. It's silly that I can head shot someone with an explosive weapon just to have them kill me with one punch.

Someone had made the suggestion that wanted players have the ability to have ‚Äònegative‚Äô caps in the event they couldn‚Äôt cover their bounty. Basically they have to pay that off before having the ability to earn any money in the future (or sales/bounty hunting first gets put toward their debt). I thought it was an interesting solution but I don‚Äôt know how widespread the issue of zero cap players griefing people is. 
---
I feel like you're right. I guess they enjoy being in load screens more often, trying to server hop, than taking 20 minutes and launching their own.
---
Launching your own gets you at least 3 quests completed , a ton of robot XP, and lots of junk.
---
Your comments funny bcuz that's how I mentally explained how our characters can go out in a blaze of glory only to wake up in a random location with their pockets turned inside out lol

They want me bad but just not for evolved gaming; just to be boring like you.

White Russian, Ballistic Bock, Oak Holler Lager
---
Never say "literally" ever again it's idiotic.
---
Read the roadmap. They're rolling out parts of the expansion one week at a time. Player vending isn't until April.
---
it is part of it, they are just drip feeding/releasing it in pieces.
---
vending is april 9th as of now 
---
Actually, that's not a bad idea. A mine that blows amber shards and boiling honey onto a foe. Bleeding damage and slowing applied. 
---
The expansion is being brought in over the course of the next month so end of april we shall have it all its non traditional dlc

I have 2 mutations going currently, seems unlikely to get a 3rd without screwing up and using Radaway without thinking and lose Marsupial.  And I ain't losing Marsupial!  It has saved my sorry butt so many times . . .

See, I like dog food for basically 2 reasons: a perk card specific for it and it doesn't rot. In FO4 all I lived on was noodle cups and tried to do the same here. The food condition was what nixed it for me.

Either way, my head canon says don't drink the "milk"...

U can buy speed demon from the market subs here..it definitely helps while sprinting to your bag while they are shooting at u
---
Yeah. Posted this to keep the awareness up. 
---
So you mean if you do the quest at like 11pm you have to wait til 11 pm the next day? It would probably be better if it was 12 hours between
---
That could mean as little as he is logging on tomorrow and will look for you on a random server.
---
Check out this post this guy is proud of the very thing this reporting is for.

https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1tna3/from_raided_to_raider/
---
Yeah, it was just revealed yesterday and there is only one keyset per server, so if someone has already got it, then you're out of luck. 
---
Yes. Exactly. 
---
Ok cool
---
Hey Adolf, ya bought an MMO, k?
---
Pretty sure you move slow
---
Yeah thanks, you too.
---
It's been 11 minutes, you should create a new post about it!
---
I knew they shared storage I just thought you had to physically empty it before logging out based on the info I was reading about the bug making your character unusable if you did
---
How are you even at that stage of the quest line at level 24?
---
Thanks, that fixed it, really strange.
---
I'm level 120something. I play everyday, and every day I take workshops. I'm not saying what you're saying can't happen, because I know with the current mechanics it can, but I am saying that it's never happened to me or the about 30 people on my friends list. If it did and I died once, workshops would still be worth it to me. I don't think these murderous teams are rampant, and telling every new player to avoid them is ridiculous. Might as well avoid Whitesprings. Idiots think they own the mobs there and can get touchy about it. No, play the game. 
---
I see timers for local events I‚Äôm nearby e,g. Walking into and out of.
---
Come see mine tonight! I‚Äôve got the coolest one! GT:Rocky Two Milli
---
Read the patch notes 
---
You on PC using mods? If so, reset your custom.ini file and check for mod updates.

Really odd, looks like logging off for a bit and then logging back on fixed it.

Griefers don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about your cutesy little lock system. They just blow the walls down. All you‚Äôre doing is keeping out honest players.
---
This is just a theory but if you create a new character and run it through the main nukashine quest you should be able to get the dailies from it too. Some of them have you auto learn the brew while others just require drinking some booze and doing a task and then you get the recipe as a consumable. You could then have a freind or secondary account do some switcharooing and you now get more than one recipe per day.
---
Like I said havnt tried so just a theory I thought of.
---
Over 300 hours so far.  I'm having a bit of a break from the game at the moment in the hope that I can do dailies when I get back on.
---
Camden Park: I'm looking at you...
---
You can't use VATS, I think.
---
Another option that has been posted before is that crafting perks are always passively active and don‚Äôt need to be equipped. Personally, I would prefer this option.
---
I thought you get one for free from their quest?
---
The last holotape was chilling.
---
Thx
---
You get it from a responder quest. Pretty easy to get, so it's not likely very rare. 
---
Rare in the sense that the only way to get one is complete a quest or buy one from a player who has completed a quest. 
---
Well outside of quest you most likey wont find it
---
That was the point, it had a lot of traffic. I passed free things out to the people waking to Overseers Camp or anyone in general.
---
I thought it was a 20 hour timer, like most online stuff nowadays?
---
I would if I had instructions. I have no clue how lol
---
I'm keen on this. What's the cost in materials? I know I have a 2nd set of T51 available. For the whole PA paintjob please.
---
No action points no vats no run or sprint
---
Without FC, you can't run or sprint (only walk at a slow speed), can't use VATS and can't use your Jet-pack. The weight is unaffected by the FC.
---
You are born, You become a fuck boi, You buy OP armor on eBay so you can ::ahem:: stand still in combat with 90% protection

There‚Äôs a few now in that mechanics/robotics area too (can‚Äôt recall the name of it)
---
I thought I did but I will try it again. Thank you! 
---
Worth it if you can get it on sale
---
Nice calculations and what you stated cant be more true. I believe that I have seen some of those armor pieces in few places so there is a high chance that some or many of them are duped. However I got every one of these items by trading them to something that have dropped to me in game. For example I found max lvl bloodied/swing speed/+1 strengtht Meat hook that I traded for 3 of those armor pieces and 3\* BE handmade. I had no use for the meat hook since I am not melee character so I was happy. I like to min max my builds in every game and this is pretty much it for the fo76. 
---
I'd love to hear some Rusty Cage, A Boy Named Sue, Daddy Sang Bass, One Piece At A Time, Ring of Fire, man, there's so many great JC songs.

i didn't read every thing but , just one question .

did you change the Password and secret question when you bought the game ?

if doesn't, why O\_o ?

What's also fun is I started the daily with him yesterday. Got disconnected from the server and when I got back in game it didn't show I had the daily active and it won't let me talk to him to reactivate it. So by time I can talk to him again it will have been over 2 days since I've done his daily. 
---
The game has all the instructions.  Also,  the internet. 
---
However,  a quick rundown.
---
1. In Enclave bunker, the military wing, there's a terminal to activate the mission to get a nuclear keycard.
---
2. Do mission. 
---
3. Go to any silo. A, B, or C. You'll get mission once inside. 
---
4. Do mission. 
---
5. At the end of the silo, swipe keycard, put in code, launch nuke whenever you want. 
---
I think New Vegas nailed it with the Western Swing.

Had a guy yesterday using the always invisible glitch . For ten minutes I tried to line up a shot on him. I know that there are multiple ways to go invisible, chameleon armor, cloaking , stealth boys, and chameleon mutation. I remember a few months ago seeing videos posted on YouTube teaching players how to do the glitch. Just wondering if there is more to know. I been playing since launch, lvl 220 now. I don't know of a legit way to stay invisible for that long. He was never hit with melee to trigger cloak. I use guns. And he was hopping marsupial style constantly. So I'm pretty sure chameleon requires you to stand still or be crouched. Could have been spamming stealthboys. Just hoping for some education. Thank you for any knowledge.
---
I so want that orange. You charging to paint?
---
The stealth builds seem okay at endgame, especially compared to regular ranged after the TSE debacle. So I really should have said stealth rather than sniper.
---
Next question....where is said Bunker? Level 39 
---
You know, I'm offline right now but I want to say Watoga and Harper's Ferry. Definitely higher level areas. I'll check for sure when I do my next vendor runs though.
---
Also remember polymer is the toughest you can mod combat armor up to. It'll make quite the difference once you're able to do it. Just craft extra low level arms and chest pieces to scrap to unlock the mods. Oh, and scrap any extras you find. 
---
Also, Critical Hits seem to negate all those Resistance stacks. So VATSing an opponent‚Äôs head with a relatively light weapon is a very good option. If they start using Stealthboys to negate VATS I‚Äôd recommend countering with a Gamma Gun. 
---
I don't think so? 
---
The only ones that I know give set plans are the power plants, it's an easy way to get all of the generators. But, I also got the large generator plan from the bog town workshop.
---
Yeah. kinda sucks datamining is a thing nowadays. Wish they would just keep it to themselves.
---
Are you being downvoted because you misspelled get gud lol
---
I‚Äôm lvl 63 and I‚Äôve never found a power armor mod. Found them for sale in Watoga but never could afford one. I suck

---
So that post and others I've seen don't actually quantify the effect of pounds of armor weight on sneak but I did a quick test with no armor vs various combinations of ultralight/lighter build combat and marine armor totalling about 15 lbs of total weight. While I can't quantify it either it seems to me that every 5 lbs of weight puts you more at risk and the most foolproof you can get with sneak is to have armor weight of 5lbs or below.
---
Quick test:
---
No armor, I walked directly in front of a level 62 ghoul (all sneak perks, nighttime, no heavy weapons equipped, etc) and didn't leave hidden until my second circle around him. I walked away and never entered danger.
---
In ultralight marine armor (same scenario but with 5lbs or so) I was able to walk circles without danger, but I hit caution on the first pass.
---
In light/ultralight heavy/normal combat armor mix, (about 15-20lbs total) I went into caution upon approach but was a able to pass through without going into danger. The other ghouls in the group started looking for me right away.

I would guess going above 25lbs of armor would make it very difficult to sneak, even with all other sneak modifiers positive (nighttime, no lights, no heavy weapons out, pipboy off, all perks, stealth boy etc) because the sound aggro of the armor weight approaches some kind of zeroed out value for sneak benefit. There doesn't seem to be any sight aggro issue besides being in daylight / electric lights.
---
In the meantime you can always fire up the Spotify app and play better music while you play.
---
Thats what I don't understand,  I wasn't out of luck.  I never got the keys, yet still got the plans, and am my char is wearing newly painted X-01. Was kinda wondering if anyone else has had the same obvious glitch.  Should have worded my post better, but I'm a bit of a storyteller and tend to wander around of point when I write.  Like right now
---
Have you still got any pure violet flux for sale?
---
Appreciate it.
---
I have some vintage lead champagne :) not sure about other types yet.
---
Oh
---
Did you buy it and place it in a camp you had set up already before you bought the workbench?
---
Well.  Day four, third time in Flatwoods, and it was locked with all the usual supplies intact.
---
That was the longest looted streak I have ever seen on that Stash.   Odd that each time the Water was left behind.  
---
Very witty.  Thumbs up
---
Musics not free
---
Good reference. I think legendaries are exhibiting this behavior to make them harder to kill.
---
Get off my lawn you young punk!
---
Oh, heh, yeah.  I should do that.  Any idea as to the cost?  I've wanted a speed demon / marsupial build for a long time, but wound up with healing factor accidentally, which I don't mind at all.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Might come back some day. Who knows. 
---
I made it after buying it 
---
The reddit crowd are a cruel bunch tbh. Most posts get hit by auto downvote bots.
---
Where did you find it?? Turning in technical data? Or other? 
---
50 cal is great in imho. It was 52 dmg (using a couple of perks). It is now 62. Together with a belt of 250 rounds, you can just keep on putting the rounds in. Just use short burst, because accuracy is not what is was made for. The ammo I have to keep making, but it is doable. Using the Excavator PA, so I can gather plenty of steel and lead for the ammo. Also using Super Duper, so every now and then I get some extra ammo, but that doesn't really make a lot  of difference for me, since the chance of that happening is currently only 10% with my perks. Love the sound though :)
---
Just checked, and it won't turn into "Vintage" moonshine, it stops fermenting at regular, just like whiskey, bourbon, etc...
---
Looks like they made some improvements to non-nuked flora as well. 
---
Never realised there were 3 firecracker berry thing plants right outside my front door until this morning.
---
Legendary robots will explode so you have to loot them as Soon as they die. Alll legendary robots.
---
Make sure the back of it isn't clipping into a wall or anything. 
---
I am not 100%, but I do a lot of workshopping and yes, I believe the loot tables give different plans at different workshops. This is purely anecdotal, as I suggested this before and the reply that impressed me the most was: 'Yeah, all workshops in the Forest have same loot table, Ash Heap another, Toxic Valley a third, etc. And when I saw different repeats after taking the workshops over and over, it looked like different workshops have different plans, when in fact it was the region that was different'
---
which was also never proven but makes sense!
---
The dead robots actually have sparks and smoke effects before they turn into metal piles, so they are not very hard to find in the city. Dead scorched in Cranberryborg is way more challenging for loots. 
---
You're the 4th person to post about thiis 
---
They go for like 200 caps each for the serums..sometimes less...would u like me to refer u to ppl I kno who have them??
---
Is it that shielded lining everyone's raving about? Personally I don't like enclave armor and I rp as a raider. But I was really hoping for it to be a dungeon similar to the ones from the trailers. 
---
Yeah, I normally wouldn't, but I usually log out inside Whitespring because I craft ammo, repair, etc., so I don't log in with broken gear and bad surprises.  So that put me right outside the building in the fray and 3 guys in PA kiting 20 or so glowing chubbies.
---
You go around telling people not to come back or play the game. Yet you seem to be actively playing it yourself. Hmmm
---
the only jetpacks i have not see so far are excavator or ultracite.
---
One of the better ones and actually one where npcs. would not have improved it. 
---
That‚Äôs right the blue glow of the firecrackers looks awesome too
---
It‚Äôs clear of everything 
---
So...trade it instead? 
---
It sucks but that's the risk you take if you drop items.  It becomes fair game. 
---
Easy like putting a magnifying glass on things you want to scrap but can never remove lol.
---
done selective startup. repaired visual c++. rollback of gpu drivers.
---
tried uninstalling software installed around the time my problems started. (just before 1.0.5.10)
---
different windows account made the shop work. weapon wheel still bugged. 
---
other char has same problems.
---
been through 2 rounds of support.
---
I dont know it was pretty good minus npc's what would the npc's have added?
---
LOL should have traded your buddy instead
---
Are you on PC? Please add me so I can visit, skinnyhb
---
I'm not hoarding legendaries for it, honest. 
---
Same thing for me, after having no luck i said screw it and opened the doors on a new server with no key and grabbed the plans
---
I have a gatling gun that does 340 per shot
---
Timed refunds for the same rate sounds hot af. 
---
Does the keypad actually work now? Use to be able to just pull the lever without entering the code.
---
Xbone. Just go where I specified. 
---
I did loot a legendary 50 cal yesterday with Explosive and Armor Piercing but I really wanted to use the LMG since it looks cooler
---
Appalachia radio needs some Spike Jones, Allen Sherman (Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh!), The Playmates (Beep Beep song), etc... 
---
It‚Äôs not 5hp/hit, otherwise things like the minigun and LMG would be griefer tools. It‚Äôs 5/hp a second.
---
Your problem seems unique. So I don‚Äôt know what to say. But if you look at the Bethesda forums you‚Äôll see 50 people complaining about this and deleting the ini files fixed it.
---
Honestly I thought so. My friends who claimed to have it never got on to show proof of existence, and ive never seen anyone walking around in any power armor that's not excavator, X-01, or T-60. I noticed T-51b isn't as popular as it was in fallout 3 and it's a tad disappointing because it's a very aesthetically pleasing set. 
---
That's pretty rad.
---
*loads up fat man*
---
5hp/sec, not per hit
---
He is a random spawn sadly
---
Yeah I was sitting here saying omg.  
---
Went through almost 10k rounds on my furious minigun at a SBQ event and it didnt break my gun #blessed 
---
its so odd, that's like the first perk I thought of when they announced this patch...but...they didn't think of it at all LOL  
---
I'm not sure what it is intended but they should at least reword the perk or something :P  (I think it should increase duration rather than the effect)  BUT so far it seems not to affect the new drinks at all.  I have only tested the 4 that I have.  
---
I did, I already know the plan and it was sitting inside.
---
I don‚Äôt know how many materials right now as I‚Äôm at work. I‚Äôll be back home and online around 6 so I‚Äôll post a comment on this post with the material requirements!
---
There is a Civil War Era Suit and the Tricentennial Suit as well. I don't know which of them count as Formal Wear or as a Suit for the daily/weekly challenges though.
---
10k rounds is a fuck ton though. I currently only maintain around 2500 5.56 for my handmade and it isnt even automatic
---
Watoga robots, uranium fever event, whitesprings ghouls, leader of the pack event 
---
Lots of variables. I usually sneak all over the place, carrying up to 700lbs. 
---
I have 2 pieces of chameleon armor, max stealth perks, and the chameleon mutation, plus lots of weight-reducing perks. 
---
I can sneak right past low level creatures or have some mid level and high level walk right past me, if i'm crouched and still. 
---
Is Paladin different than the knight/capt/officer paints?
---
WhiteSpring, Uranium Fever, WestTec
---
That would be nice. 
---
With the recent updates I actually have a reason to grow my own crops. 
---
Blackwater Mine Event 2-3* , Horde Events all over the map , whitespring golf club , battle bot mount blair Event 
---
Yeah, if you direct message me, I'm grateful.  On Xbone, though.
---
You're post endgame level. I'd agree with you. 
---
Maybe start a new character to get them to level 50 so they can be legendary when the update drops?
---
I don‚Äôt know how many materials right now as I‚Äôm at work. Once I‚Äôm out of work I should be home and online around 6 so I‚Äôll post a comment on this post with the material requirements!
---
Ah ok well I never got the person nearby spawn thing I could never get it to work so if it did change then it‚Äôs normal for me lol
---
I‚Äôm sure my level 1 turrets will save me...right??
---
I have been very fortunate I guess.  I am in the forest and have an open camp surrounded by the concrete Jersey-like barriers.  Any player can easily get in, but the "local residents" are blocked entry.  All the people I've had come by, when I was there, jump around all excited and those with mics provide compliments.  As I said, I've been very fortunate... touch wood.
---
Hell even adding a new drink with the dlc for it would work. 
---
I've read that your stealth isn't affected by enemies running into you but it is if you run into them. I've also read that your armor weight only matters when you're moving and carry weight doesn't matter at all.
---
This is a ‚Äúwait till the hype dies down and then go do it‚Äù sort of thing. 
---
This will be kinda long winded so here it goes. This is what I do. I play together with my wife who hasn't done any brotherhood quests. Because of this, when she collects data it keeps them as individual items unlike someone who has done the BoS quests where no matter how many you collect it shows as one only in your inventory. 
---
So she collects it all, we travel to the camp and she gives me one data, I turn it in, quest complete. She gives me another one immediately after, it instantly activates the quest again and I turn it in again. Quest completed again. Copy and repeat for as many data as she has. Doing this reduces the amount of fast traveling you need to do and saves on caps. 
---
This method will only work if the person holding the data hasn't done any BoS quests.
---
Or psychbuff depending on my char build ... juice for the queen
---
Was gonna post same thing till I read your reply.  
---
But it has no stars. Just a plain gutsy
---
emergency protocol chest mod is the closest thing if you could call it that.
---
So my level 21 deathclaw was replaced by a level 4 radstag what in tarnation
---
You go around???
---
The op asked a question.
---
I have the same opinion as this guy due to the still on going issues like hackers and not enough people on a map to even kill a sbq due to the main issues.
---
Part of the ‚Äúdisconnecting‚Äù issue is also related to the users connection to the game server and internet...
---
I genuinely thought one of 76's potential benefits would be a rotation on the radio stations. I also thought there would be either a robot, or somebody broadcasting one way from real far away giving in canon news about emerging communities (likely mostly ghoul) adding "flavor" to the background of the world. Kinda disappointed nothing like that happened, though if it was ever even a thought, they've clearly had a lot more important things to do.
---
Cheers, appreciate it. I'll have a look at the cost for other paint jobs and see what's common between them.
---
I had the same issue when I got it as well. It did it for me because as far as I can tell it was from being to close to the wall. I moved mine away from the wall a little bit and it stopped doing it. 
---
Yeah the lining is in there, and stat wise with a +3 str it's one of the best. I was hoping for way more, but it's still nice to know all that work wasn't wasted. That plan is a nice little boon.
---
And Sugar Grove
---
About how many TD did you turn in to get it?
---
Strength 15 points
---
Use these perks in strength all lvl 3 cards
---
Slugger
---
Master slugger
---
Expert slugger
---
Incisor
---
Martial artist
---
Max 2 hand damage and excellent swing speed
---
I also use a max lexel bloody mess in luck
---
Yea i do know that, but ever other game works on 40 ms for me. Lol, csgo, dota 2, cod. All are good except fallout 76
---
Yeah, I was experimenting with them last night 
---
Yes, I was experimenting with them last night 
---
I used to be a T-60 loyalist for the cheap repairs (the BoS skin and very common mods didn‚Äôt hurt either).
---
But I haven‚Äôt had to repair it in like 2 months, for some reason. So now I‚Äôm considering other options, maybe T-51b
---
Oh yeah, I didn't even consider that some challenges want formal wear, I just want a suit and a fancy helmet to be wasteland Daft Punk.
---
Thanks, I forgot the Civil War Suit. I'll give that a look before I throw down the atoms on the tux.
---
I'll cut your grass for a violet flux Mr!
---
Third story roof I believe. Dark metal double doors like a basement entrance.
---
Also being able to place stash items in camp is coming the 9th also I can‚Äôt wait for that patch
---
Before this patch it was atleast playable 
---
Gamer tag?  
---
https://imgflip.com/i/2w7cz2
---
This really needs to be a thing!
---
Other variables you can think about is the sturdy frame perk, which lowers armor weight, and the legendary weightless armor. I imagine this would make all armor weigh less than 5lbs if you had all weightless. 
---
This may be your internet or home wiring that's dropping speeds.
---
I'm on this game for hours at a time.
---
Once in a while I'll get DCed.
---
Make it a hidden quest.  When you unlock the last door, you hit a button inside or a terminal and the quest completes, you get your item no matter how many peeps are there. 
---
Yea i want to listen to listen to mo bomba while walking in slow motion throughout the wasteland.
---
\*farm location noted\* I was looking for a good place to pick for "Brew a fuckton of booze" challenges. Thanks.
---
Nvm I downloaded the fucking beta lmao
---
Patsy Cline would be a phenomenal addition
---
This is genuinely good idea
---
Same here because I did the quest at around 12 pm my time and today I did it at 730am. I thought it had a specific time it reset.
---
Did you read the plan?
---
U just reminded me I have the decontamination shower plans..I need to to build the shower for my camp..got them months ago üò≠üòÇ
---
I am glad to hear that. I dont think thats it about my internet
---
Kool.  Glad someone else had the same experience as me.  Kinda glitchy quest and  from what I am reading, it opens up a griefing exploit to steal the plans by hiding and running in under stealth to grab them before the mule (you and me) can get them.  Lol I love this game 
---
Lol, yeah I hear ya. Your comment made me think of explosives though. 
---
Yes i read i got on video in case
---
Yeah, robots are randomly exploding immediately upon being killed. So if you melee it makes the day entertaining to say the least. 
---
You can toggle it on console its either start or the option's button
---
I'm on Xbox
---
I've been considering it just to be a part of the statistical data that demonstrates that fixing the game = more profit. That and the new CAMP revamp makes me want to collect everything!
---
Funny thing is I got one of the vintage lead champagne varients ... before the actual lead champagne lol
---
Okay.... What's the issue?
---
I do not work for BGS, but maybe some experienced players or reddit users can help you figure out what is going on. 
---
They aren‚Äôt stocked and you need to get them with treasure maps or drops 
---
Yeah just click the button opposite of start while in pip boy i cant remember its name
---
I received plans for the fraternity letters in my workshop as a reward as well 
---
Leader of the pack for low level items.
---
Uranium fever for mid (up to lvl 40).
---
Watoga, whitespring, and west tek for lvl 50 items.
---
You had it mixed.
---
OP only got a account name and password to use. I would think that changing your password requires a validation email so he couldn't do it. 
---
Myself I created the account around summer or so when the game was annouched, and then the keysite just gave me a code to register the game into my account. I don't see the keysite I used as highly dubious, although it was my first time to try one. After all the game was not released when I brought it. OP brought it from private person.
---
Just to be clear, that was actually a joke, I don't have access to nuclear weapons in real life.
---
Reddit can be such a queer fish at times :)
---
Pretty sure its a bear skull, could be wrong though
---
Which tic blood the regular one or one of the two varients? I got the sunrise but can‚Äôt make it yet
---
Apparantly every time in the game got broken in this update. Nuke timers are off, food and hunger are off, respawn times are off, dailies/weeklies are off
---
Yes it looks awesome 
---
I dunno man, Just seem odd to me. 
---
"No don't buy it, I still play it all the time, but shouldn't get it." 
---
Just a straight up "no" with no reason of why from some who still seem to be quite involved with the game just seems strange to me.
---
Maybe it's just me but I would still be using any product that I wouldn't recommend for others. 
---
I've always thought they need to add Pandora or Spotify into the radio
---
T51b has best ballistic protection except rads so if you frequent nuked areas get a bunch of Radaway ready, otherwise it‚Äôs the best. Excavators are great for farming and visiting vendors. 
---
Ok I was wondering what the condition effect meant
---
Outstanding move.
---
They take awhile to turn on *each time.* They turn off when you log back in. So you need to turn them on each time you log in and wait like 5 minutes in your camp. 
---
One of the few bugs i regularly experience
---
If you got 100gb+ of disc space to spare, sure. Had to uninstall so I could play other games while waiting for more content.
---
So many things can cause intermittent problems with connection.
---
Sometimes it's:
---
A faulty modem
---
A wire being"grounded out"
---
Neighbors over using your connection
---
Microwave ovens
---
Cordless phone (or anything riding the same megahertz frequency)
---
To say it's not your intent is a vague claim.
---
Agreed. Or more tracks like Blind Willie Johnson's "Nobody's Fault But Mine".
---
In West Tek, and from AWOL Armaments event as well
---
Cool, will have to go explore up there a bit more see if I can find it
---
Yes it‚Äôs really annoying. Also when your weapon breaks it should automatically switch to your prior weapon, buy no you‚Äôre left with bare hands and have to fumble through menu and hot wheel (still broken) to look for it. No other fps games are as broken as fo76. 
---
That looks great thanks for telling me how to get this
---
That sounds like a baller legendary. Mine does 120 something, with 30% more on ghouls and 50% more limb damage. Makes it great for nukes at whitespring though
---
I've had some connectivity issues since the latest patch as well. Not nearly as bad as what you're saying, but I've had it drop a few times. As with a couple of the last updates and patches, there are probably a few things that unintentionally "broke," and will need to be fixed.
---
Wait the nuka paint plans also apply to X-01? Or did they add in the other plan?
---
Open the Pip Boy and there will a button to change the view.

They have Tennessee Ernie Ford on it and he was born where I live in the town of Bristol on the Tennessee side in a little old white house that I drive by daily and never realized it LOL!

Yes sir I have a new one which is paladin and it's so awesome 
---
I don't even know :D

What level are you? 
---
Out of combat use food for HP...

Yeah Bethesda has responded to posts like these and are working on it.

I think the regions have set pools like you said but each workshop has a couple of plans tied only to it, or each has their own loot table. You do end up with repeats at a particular workshop, sometimes right in a row. I take lots of workshops and some plans only ever seem to drop from one, others multiple. That's my anecdotal evidence. 
---
Also got this message after the update. Strangely it seemed OK to just rebuild exactly where it‚Äôd been, so I did (Having to rebuild from scratch, because it never allows the whole thing to just be plunked back down). Next login, I got the message again. Pretty sweet ‚Äî make up your mind, game.
---
Agreed on all counts. But that's not what people are claiming.
---
I have tested ballistic Bock and that does not vintage as far as I know I left it in for 24 hours and nothing, same for hard lemonade.

Accidentally deleted my reply.

It just seems odd to me. You have someone who still seems to be actively involved with game saying just "no" without  providing any reasons as to why. 
---
Maybe it's just me, but I still wouldn't be using any product that I wouldn't recommend for others.
---
Okay so it seems that some stuff does become vintage and some do not. Just gotta work out which is which
---
Added in Quantum paint for XO1
---
It depends on where the leader of the pack is. If it's in the Mire or Bog it'll be higher level.
---
You on now?
---
I wondered if it was just me. I bought those plans, read them, and can't find it when I go to build. You are not alone OP.
---
Same here , ever since update it's been super laggy on every server and Crashing when in nukes zones everything just went really shitty .  I hope every update doesn't do this or pretty soon it'll be unplayable .
---
Before this update my gameplay was running really smooth as well.  
---
You can‚Äôt sell the blackbird paint just fyi

I will play around with it and see what I can do. Thanks

You‚Äôre telling me there isn‚Äôt a single Dolly Parton song on the radio? This game cries out for *Silver And Gold*.

thanks for your reaction, had not gone into detail again since most people don't care / or think it's funny that someone has problems.  a copy paste from a previous post: 
---
"long story short, while playing yesterday i noticed that the damage input of all my weapons had gone down to like 50%
---
contacted bethesda and they give me this advice:
---
I looked into the issue, and it seems some players have found success in doing the following:
---
Unequip all Perk Cards
---
Unequip all Weapons and Armor
---
Cure any disease/mutations/addiction
---
After unequipping everything, log out and back in again
---
If the issue continues, unequip Perks/Weapons/Armor again
---
Try server hopping
---
Re-equip Perks/Weapons/Armor to check weapon damage
---
did this today and it worked...... for ten minutes. I made pictures yesterday and the damage for my dragon for example was 186, so very low. after doing all the stuff that bethesda had suggested it went back up to 311 (this is one example, it's the case for all my weapons).
---
i started playing an hour ago, happy happy and did this:
---
    i fast travelled from my camp to sutton station, took a grape metants for better prices and sold aid items for 200 caps
---
    i fast travelled to lewisburg station, looked if the power armor was there , shot two bugs, sold for 200 caps, bought a mod for 50 caps.
---
after trading i checked weapons damage again and yes, way down again. the dragon went back from 311 to 186. i did not get sick, addicted or mutated, i did not change perk cards."
---
i tried again today after the big update, same problem. unmounted all cards, weapons, armor, restarted ps4, worked normally for like 20 minutes and then the problem came back.  about to give up on fallout 76 and bethesda.
---
Check some other threads about the vault tec bed - I think the one people are thinking about (wood headboard with vault tec comforter) is actually called something else, while the vault tec bed is just a mattress and frame. I have the vault tec 2  bed - same frame but with pillow and blanket.
---
It's not that we don't understand that it was a joke.  It's that your comment: 
---
1. Didn't answer the question. 
---
2. Didn't add anything meaningful to the conversation. 
---
I've had things spawn inside my locked house, so to me this isn't even a factor. It's part of why I don't even have doors now, lol. Only door is into the bathroom cause a wastelander gotta have some privacy. 
---
Found 1 plan in Blackwater mine a couple weeks ago, it‚Äôs just really rare now 
---
That might be it someone else posted they got a knight plan to
---
I do a lot of horde events, ones in the mire and cranberry bog seem to almost never require fast travelling, and give mostly max lvl loot, all the other zones tend to give lower level loot and require travelling. I would only do mire and bog ones.
---
Ive been switching my build from rifles to heavies since probably level 70. It just seems like a more viable way to have damage output, even though taking down SBQ is halfway impossible.
---
351
---
I've tried it 3 times now, and it's not worked once. 
---
Ballistic Book and Lead Champagne, also bought Hard lemonade/lemonade from Mr. Squeeze

Just saw the article about you on Kotaku! Congrats!  https://kotaku.com/strange-man-lures-unsuspecting-fallout-76-players-into-1833215849
---
ƒ∞ looked every bed if i am wrong but no its locked
---
Fully agreed
---
I mean, Rose does talk about the gourmands.
---
Wow. Nicely done.
---
How long did it take?
---
PC or console?
---
Did you put the walls up first or second?
---
I was doing passthrough, long, wire-tap, short, long passthrough on a PS4 and always comming up a touch too long for a three-square second floor.
---
In Fo4 I cheated with a three-way switch in the corner in one base, and making a sub-assembly of two passthroughs and a four-junction in another. 76 wont group-move.

Meanwhile I still haven't gotten a single plan for handing in the data, I might give up soon. I've handed in 153 data(yes I've been keeping track)

Im not sure about the button layout on ps4 but i know on pc it is VERY easy to accidently press drop and open perk menu at the same time, and if you do its really not obvious that you dropped something. I lost a mutant slayers explosive shotty to it, and almost lost a god roll rolling pin yesterday, luckily my friend noticed i dropped it
---
Exactly.

I stumbled upon him earlier, but was nowhere near where you said lol.

GTA: San Andreas had some songs removed later on, for one example.

You can calm them just like in 4.

Tbh when I launch a nuke I'm dropping it in a random place in the Mire just to see what comes out of it

Yeah paladin looks like the orange but it is more blue on the legs and has symbols on the arms in orange and my GT is jeanzyy 
---
because it's only 1 part of like 8
---
To me it looked like it had curled horns and an open mouth 
---
It's server specific.
---
Yeah it changes if you hop servers.

There were Gourmands in Appalachia. That could be a reference, or just a coincidence. Your cynical mileage may vary.

Okay so I went back to check the Inside the Vault for this update and this is one of the bullet points for the fermenter

Some drinks require fermentation time before they‚Äôre ready to be consumed. Wines and Spirits can also be aged further to gain additional, more powerful effects.

I'm not, I think it will make game a lot more interesting

Their "help" is utterly laughable. I've had two issues, and both times they said things like "Is your PC capable of playing the game?" "Is your router working?" and literal garbage like that.

If you know a good Gulper spawn I suggest trying that. Glowing Gulpers give like 400xp each which would be good for leveling up, but I've never found a good reliable spawn for them.

Not anymore. All good.

I removed the mod files in Data but I must've missed something because uninstalling from the launcher wasn't enough. Better to uninstall then delete the remaining folders by hand.

We need that and then some, I need songs like 'This Magic Moment' and shit, especially since it's a live game where the radio's the same for everybody, I know for a fact I've been using my phone on youtube with the radio off because every time I turn the damn thing on somehow it's on the five songs in a row I've heard too many times, more beach boys, they could take notes from a majority of the fo4 radio mods, and if they ever implemented newer songs that were from the 70's/80's, well, I know the first two games had no set lore that the only music out there was like doo-wap, am I wrong? I heavily recommend Doom Metal if you listen to other music. Lately, I've been listening to:
---
THE SWORD - Age of Winters/Warp Riders
---
ELECTRIC WIZARD(DISCOGRAPHY)
---
SLEEP - Dopesmoker(1hr long song)
---
PALLBEARER - (DISCOGRAPHY)
---
and a lot more but those are cornerstones\^\^
---
If you don't like anything like that but enjoy Black Sabbath indoctrinate yourself listening to the song 'Black Sabbath' from Black Sabbath while playing this game and you will understand what I am talking about, and all of these albums enhance night time to a near horrific degree depending on what you're up to!(Only thing that comes close is running through the Mire at a low level as that Beach Boys song comes on, but I'm conditioned for this Doom Metal Radio, and honestly as far as royalties go, do it! There are alt-realities, this game is proof of one, so have a few more radio stations, they've always done a disservice I'd say with the vanilla radio, I can appreciate oldies, but when they don't even get  alll the best oldies, I'm like oh...
---
Just gotta keep following that public domain release schedule lool
---
Probably would just drop it at Gulper Lagoon, although Gulpers scare the shit out of me so I kinda don't to
---
Actually, I subscribe to three different FO76 subs.  Many of the posts I reply to are made by people crying about random drops being too random, being attacked by other players and generally wanting an Easy mode.
---
You made yourself sloppy, got yourself killed and you don‚Äôt like the consequences.  
---
Did you drink it and got so drunk you forgot you drank it?
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a civil or naval Swiss flag,those are rectangular,not square.
---
I don't know anything about this lol. What door? ...wait is it the one in the shack below the weird plant thing?
---
I spent all last night trying to do this damn quest and I kept fucking it up. 
---
A lock function would be most helpful indeed. I accidently sold my instigating Sledgehammer and didn't realise until the next morning I'd done it. It was only a 1 star weapon but it made for a very useful backup as a non-melee character. 
---
Alcohol in your fermenter is accessible from your stash, you may have grabbed it from your stash on accident.
---
yeah this keeps happening to me! I've rebuild my camp about 5 times now and I'm tired of it every time I log back in my camp is gone. because placement is being blocked by the game! if you want to block the placement of my camp do it when I try to build it! clearly there was nothing wrong with the way I built my camp when I did. so why do I have to place it everytime I log in it insane!
---
Hahahahahahaha, I see what you did!
---
You placed them too high üòÖ
---
And? Am I supposed to feel bad that I want the first to figure it out? Or that I'm part of a group trying to help people by providing information rather than keeping it to myself? Next time you say, or type something, stop and ask yourself "Should I say this? Is it in any way relevant? Will I just sound like a dick?" When someone tries to be helpful, don't shut them down.
---
How about you read da whole post it's not my job to read for people
---
Pretty well every other time I log in, my camp can't be placed. Acid and water are very important to my game, so it will be hard to move. There is another acid + water location that I'm aware of, but it is in the middle of the toxic valley, and there are several rad spewing geysers near the acid node.
---
Haha no I would remember drinking such fine alcohol....or perhaps not 
---
EVERYONE did this at some point or another. EVERY SINGLE ONE.

I probably did....

I wonder if there's a website out there that has listed almost EVERYTHING that any radio in the game has played?
---
At first, i thought i was listening to computer-generated music.

But if they're all real, i wonder what i have been listening to, since Day One?

Oh. I well I think all my friends joined the brotherhood already lol. However my friend has a sly account but he doesn‚Äôt really use it.

"For the Olympic Games, for example, Switzerland uses a rectangular flag. This is because of an International Olympic Committee ruling that all national flags must have the same dimensions.

The Swiss civil ensign is also rectangular when flown by Switzerland‚Äôs sea-going merchant ships and maritime yachts."
---
Those seem to be the only cases where its rectangular

IDK man... I drank so much one time I woke up in a pool in the middle of nowhere, and later on I drank so much I woke up in the woods on top of a mountain... Point is, who knows what happens when you drink too much.

It was the other way around.  My thought is as she laid there shot she realized the error in her ways.

Ah God I hate when people do that lol.  I personally never have.  I put mine higher up in the savage divide 
---
It's your mods/ini file
---
I don't believe you... Either that or you didn't know you could pick through the piles of anything your turrets killed.
---
It‚Äôs your mods.
---
The pass code is set for that server if another person gets a code it changes it for that server. Good luck
---
I‚Äôm glad they enhanced fireberries too, now I don‚Äôt stumble into them and set them off anymore lol

It's only happened to me once since update, I feel the most stable since the BETA tbh
---

If you have marsupial you can jump to it from inside. I'd recommend being in team with strange in numbers on to make it way easier. If you are inside the building it is in the production area.

Yesterday there was Sheepsquatch Horde event on the map, but when I arrive it changed to ghouls.
---
T51b is actually the best pa in fo76
---
It would be awesome to be able to play your own playlist on there too!!!
---
It‚Äôs one of the better and more rewarding quests in the original game IMO
---
I don't have any mods. I had to make a fresh install because it wouldn't update to my SSD because it needed 50 GB to update. It has done that every time I update so I just moved it to my HDD. I used to have mods but don't any more.
---
Look in the challenges. They're listed there. 
---
It would be nice to lock specific pieces, even if only to prevent me from accidentally selling them.  My power armor melee character has a set of weightless conventional armor, and it's sometimes hard to figure out which piece I'm wearing and which weightless piece I recently acquired while I'm selling in my power armor.  Sometimes the armor is marked as being worn, and sometimes not.
---
I tend to accidentally sell my diluted rad-x instead of regular, because I'm not paying enough attention.  That's slightly annoying if I'm far away from a chem station or have limited water.
---
I don't understand why I've seen much more of players asking me to trade, then requesting all of my good gear.  I'm only carrying two rifles, a knife and a couple grenades.  Obviously I'm using them.  It's like players are just entirely unaware of others, or so selfish that they just don't care.  It's not like they can somehow steal them, strongarm me or intimidate in any way.  It's a futile gesture trying to pot-shot me with plinking damage afterwards.  I just block them and swap to a different server.
---
They should've made a radio station for jazz, another for classical, and another for both kinds: country and western. But seriously, I would love it if there was a separate folk music station.
---
I don't think it does need more country music. 
---
It needs more folk music. WV has a pretty rich folk music history, which BGS took inspiration from (look at the types of instrument we can play for instance)
---
You may be feeling like "It's country, John Denver, Country roads.... That's country"
---
But really that song is more of a pastoral folk tune. 
---
I'm a big Canadian Folk music fan (Stan Rogers, Lightfoot, Neil Young [the big 3]), but I'd love to hear more Appalachian folk music added.  I often listen to Sundown by Lightfoot while 76'ing, I think it'd be a good fit. 
---
I feel like Cash would have been more fitting in NV, and we can leave Kline out of it all together. I have little love for country music, it's shallow,  leeches off its own stereotypes, and there hasn't been a decent country musician in decades. 
---
Doesnt bother me you dont believe me. Do I actually know you? I didnt do it because I was too busy looking for a place that I could keep my base and wouldn't have the "Your camp could not be placed" message. I also didnt want it to be nuked when I was actually playing the game. I did spend time running around whitesprings leveling up however but never wanted or felt the need to exploit it. 
---
Hahaha!
---
I just like having a swanky home i dont like the foundation stair method
---
I know we got the new drinks was wondering about other stuff added like the paint.
---
People are either f-ing stupid, or, greedy - otherwise you'd have NO downvotes.  
---
Check the pictures from this thread. Sometimes the CAMP items aren't the same as the plan names. I think it just shows up as "Bed" in CAMP.

---
Nope. Not once. But I really hate repairing my base. So I have it hidden away where barely anything can touch it. Aside from griefers that watch the map. 
---
The Custom INI file is causing it.  Even if you don‚Äôt have any mods currently. 
---
90% of the nukes I've been in were dropped by me or another member of my party, so it's easy to not get your camp nuked when you're dropping the nuke.
---
The quest wants you to go in the cave. 
---
go inside wendigo cave should always be one at the waterfall in the back of the cave.
---
So you‚Äôre already warned when you‚Äôre in the vicinity of a player with a bounty and they do appear as a red dot unless they‚Äôre sneaking. There definitely needs to be more consequences to being wanted or PvPing without caps, it‚Äôs getting pretty widespread.
---
The idea that a wanted player that‚Äôs killed can‚Äôt PvP until wanted again is gonna lead to a lot of wrecked bases. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the end of the world I‚Äôm just letting you know. 
---
Your first point about a free for all PvP system is basically describing survival mode, and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have a lot of support  trying to bring that to adventure mode.

I love that new content is being added,thank you, but how come I all of a sudden can't inspect items vendors have for sale? Was that planned and intended? We didn't need that taken away from vendor trading, we needed the inspect item prompt ADDED to PtoP trading. Please fix that.
---
Took me a long time to figure this out after taking it out of the fermentor and placing it in my stash and the. Going back to the fermentor to find it and repeat the process .... multiple times...... more so then I would like to mention..... on different occasions to..... 
---
How do I fix this?
---
Yeah, but newer music would have likely been entirely digital, so boom, no more new music. 
---
And scrounging in the wasteland? Old vinyls seem more than setting appropriate, and would explain the music style. 
---
I generally run my own playlist, it's got a lot of folk/folk rock which is quite fitting.
---
Dude why'd you wake him? He was just trying to rest
---
Cool so that's your story. Back when that place was actually good to farm everybody was dropping nukes there. Youd join a server and you could almost bet within 30 min of joining a nuke was hitting whitesprings. 
---
Okay thanks 
---
I haven't had mine there for a while now, not really worth it since the Nerf. Keep mine down to the far south by the edge of the map. There's a nice little lake in the woods with flatland for farming.
---
Yep really appreciate their hard work, even in areas where people didn‚Äôt have much complains 
---
You'll float, too! 
---
You sound like my parents.
---
This guy killed the only npc in the game....lmao
---
People are lazy. Seems to be a big influx of younger players. I've just about gotten to the point of shooting a few to convince them I'm not selling my 3\* weapons for 100 caps. I've had some follow me and spam trade while trying to buy weapons that sell for 5k caps or more.
---
I was trying to place conduit throughout the building with the wire connection points sticking out each side so that I could power things inside and out without wires dangling inside, and without going around the ouside of the building with pylons (because the building is "floating" on a set of 2x1 stairs).
---
So the core building is two concrete foundations with a 2x1 stair, five (metal grate) floors wide, then another 2x1 stairs on a pair of foundations. Then the 3x3 building is centered "south of" the span of gratings and the east and west side has is flanked by gratings as well. There's an atomic generator on the east side, and powered turrets on both the east and west side.
---
Posts "hold up" the south edge of the platform, and the farm in the ground below the building between the foundations.
---
Now that the camp budget is less stingy I wanted to remove the under-slung wiring and re-add the lighting I had to remove to pay for the turrets.
---
Whole thing is wood-and-steel (original tile set) except I spent Atoms on the clean-and-new water purifier and I made a vaulted roof with the barn roof(?) tiles. 
---
The whole thing is easy to place on most lots because you only need to match up four foundation blocks that with the five tile span so  any even-vaguely flat terrain will do.
---
(I do wish the lights had a longer shine distance to make the place more visible from the road, to welcome passers by.)
---
But the goal was to retrofit the conduit without having to store and re-place everything.
---
Since the building is floating getting the connectors in place from the outside is problematic since the optimal placement, counting the slight hill, is almost three tiles above the terrain in the back.
---
But "fiddling" is difficult and tacky looking for the asthetic I'm trying to complete.
---
The large building over large farm is super space efficient as well.
---

---
I know you‚Äôve said you don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs your connection, but it may be. Not too many people are experiencing connectivity issues as of the most recent update on consoles or PC. 
---
May be worth checking your own connection - it‚Äôs possible you aren‚Äôt getting the upload and download speeds from your Internet Service Provider they say they are providing you. Not only will it improve your Fo76 experience, but you‚Äôll notice a better quality of life using the internet in general. 
---
Hope this is of any help! 
---
I used a bloodied gating plasma with adrenal reaction and 10 percent health. Pop a few scrubs so my adrenaline goes to max and a psychotats and omg I was shredding that chick. There were 15 players fighting I had to do at least half of the damage done. It was glorious. I used 9 plasma cores that fight before she went down. Died 3x as well. But damn it was fast. 
---
I just disconnect from that server as soon as they show up and move to another one. I think it‚Äôs funny that they‚Äôre standing there watching my CAMP disappear. 
---
You can delete it, I believe.  Or you can find one of the other topics on it with what you need to add to the file to make it stop.

I‚Äôm on mobile right now so searching myself is clunky.

Ok üòÅ

Find a lead node and put your camp down, you get access to a lead extractor then
---
have you tried the ammo factory workshop
---
I would look for places with dumbbells and barbells. Charleston Fire Department has so 160 pound one. Pick up all and scrap at the workbenches that are there and you can gently keep 120
---
What did you buy? :)
---
Nope, I got it today. Still working :)
---
If your still offering this service, I'll do it, GT: PeteMcNasty74
---
If find country to be so jarring. 
---
There's a very finite era of country that has redeemable qualities. 
---
Country music is now a parody of itself. It's pretty much boiled down to "Redneck lifestyle" songs. And "Trying to not be country music while being just country enough to warrant being considered that genre" songs. 
---
Moon River and Don‚Äôt rain on my parade, plus every song from new vegas
---
I must have angered the Gods of RNG
---
Lol the characters you meet on this game  :)
---
No joke I thought dang got a glitch then I was trying to figure out how to stop it I found out there wasn‚Äôt any in my stash and did it a few more times figured the glitch was it was reverting back to the fermentors inventory so I gave up. Did that a few more time today and realized that all 7 of my drinks kept going back gave up again then a few hours ago I noticed the number up top still said zero ...... the saw the bottom of the menu lol
---
Point is, there is a vast majority of people who placed their camp there, much more then those who didn't. 
---
Hell yeah I would love to hear burning ring of fire while exploring
---
I help too
---
I hardly ever go there, precisely because there is so little to do up there. That said of all the regions I've explored (still haven't ventured into the Mire and Cranberry Bog) Toxic Valley has the best soundtrack. 
---
I would like to see a major city in each of the sub regions on par with Mogantown with multiple events and lore related quests and locations as well as dispersing the concentration of Legendaries the likes of which are found at Whitesprings.
---
Given the expanse of Appalachia, the developers could easily squeeze in a few more towns and cities. 
---
FYI, all the special weapons aren‚Äôt able to be built again if you ever sell it. You can upgrade them to a higher level, but must have the original. You can however build the phantom device. 
---
Illegal Smile would also be a good fit. 
---
And angel from Montgomery with or without raitt.
---
Even better is that if you eat too many, you start to turn...
---
Wish you could display them in your camp

Got a instigating hunter. Couldn't justify turning it into sniper stock due to the cnd lowering
---
Lucky hole mine.

Watch out for Cthulhu.
---
I don‚Äôt get it either when I had turrets killing random enemies I had to tag them in order to get credit. Are people running in and pulling them out and using a weapon also or did they change it to reward eco without taging them?
---
I had found another very cool iron + acid area that would be possible to get both, but it‚Äôs right beside a fissure. Not worth it.
---
Nah, it naturally grows on trees. A few of them are in the Top of the World area, but kinda spotted about.

---
There have been a million posts about this since the update. 
---
That may be true but a lot of people have not because it drove them nuts when they were trying to farm it for themselves and someone's turrets were getting aggro/killing their ghouls. Especially for the golfer ghoul quest. 
---
The internet has many dark and shadowy figures in it.  Some of them know basically everything about how to find things in video games. 
---
Lucky hole mine.  Use excavator armor. I walk away with close to 400 ore each run
---
Thx i found it 
---
Nice, but _way_ harder to do with a console controller compared to a mouse and keyboard.
---
Clipping the conduit through the walls by removing and replacing the walls instead of using the pass-through connectors is a workable "cheat" since it exploits an error.
---
I'm working "overhead" on a second floor so placing those corners nearly three stories above the ground is problematic at best. 
---
I find it‚Äôs more about DPS than scoring critical shots unless you play a bloodied build. Personally I‚Äôd recommend trading for a heavy gun and if you have the resources prime it. Using the stabilized perk give you +30% armor penetration. Sadly the TSE really aren‚Äôt the best anymore.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve just had some bad luck with lobbies too which sucks but keep trying, use perks like bloody mess and tenderizer and adrenaline to max out your damage. You‚Äôll kill her eventually for sure and hopefully you get more than a 1star wood leg lol!
---
As true as that may be I found excavator PA is much more common amongst PlayStation players I've noticed. 
---
Fair enough. I don't like that music either. I just thought it would make sense. 
---
The golfer ghoul quest is a pain in the ass anyway because the enemies that spawn scale with the level or surrounding players. It's a bad place to have that quest.
---
Fallout needs more radio songs and stations in general. 
---
Yes-ish. I am making an asthetic build and trying to do it without any clipping tricks (like placing the walls after words because the wall placement will clip through arbitrary items).
---
So we found out that we agree on that and we can agree with the statement that no one will dispute that claim. 
---
I actually had this problem briefly on XBox yesterday.  When I first logged into the world, I was at my camp and sinking fast.  I was overencumbered so I couldn't fast travel anywhere either.  Eventually I made it back to land (my camp is near water) and it seemed to clear up.  Wonky.
---
But yeah, it's crazy how many people make new topics about it when there are so many topics here already devoted to it.  People will try all sorts of remedies, post videos of their gameplay to YouTube, composed a new post here, blah blah blah.  A ten second search of this subreddit would've saved them the trouble.
---
I feel the need to do some research on why people submit instead of search, and what kind of people are more apt to do that.  But I'm also lazy, so here we are.
---
a bit of furniture for my CAMP

This is exactly what I want as well, it‚Äôs annoying not having that one plant because I can‚Äôt put it in my own camp, and having to travel across the map to get it
---
I had one guy on a facebook page make a suggestion as to how they could do this and its my favorite idea now hahaha. Prety much just make the songs holo tape plans and random holo tapes you can find. And i thought this up later much much later. But since they are giving us player vending. They could also make it so we could set up radio towers that would broadcast playlist you have made of the songs you have found and make us player radios also. 
---
&gt;Cheap to maintain
---
This right here is the main reason I use it. With power patcher and fix it good it only takes a handful of plastic, steel, and a couple other common components, and it lasts forever.
---
Make sure no one else has done it because I did the entire thing and at the last door those was no key card so now I have to do it all over again. A big give away is if the bathroom door at the nuka cola place is already open.
---
Or at least at the top of the actual post. I don't want to read about him I just have to go straight to the place to do a thing and get some stuff. There's usually some sort of hunt involved, and that's at *least* half the fun. 
---
The events in this game are alot of fun, swarm of suitors is a favorite as is Grafton day
---
If this doesn‚Äôt help, see if you can plug your machine directly into your router via Ethernet cable rather than using WiFi. I‚Äôve also had experience in the past where my router was ‚Äústuttering‚Äù and my connection to it via WiFi would drop for just a blip of time, enough to where it wasn‚Äôt noticeable, but just enough to disconnect me from an online game. 
---
It‚Äôd be nice like snap tail the way to plant it could be a little pond
---
I‚Äôd love a Cranberry, Diseased Cranberry and Tarberry farm!
---
No! Where that located? 
---
I‚Äôve found loose plans as recently as 2 weeks ago so I think they‚Äôre just really rare not specifically tied to treasure maps.
---
The new workbench don't seem to work with super duper nor have the ability to scrap items. But others need to confirm, maybe I'm just unlucky. Or maybe it's intentional. 
---
ok do u mean the building with the hole in the wall, where u find the scematics on the groundfloor in the glassbox?
---
on the second floor is a rocket launcher spawn but no bathroom?
---
"I'm enjoying the game by making everyone else's experience suck. I constantly see people complaining about my behavior but you should let me do it because I'm having fun by making you have a bad experience.  It's not fair that I don't get to enjoy what I want to do because everyone else complains about. Everyone complaining about my behavior is an asshole even though I'm the one causing them to complain about my behavior. I just want to have fun.  Why can't I have fun by destroying all your stuff? "
---
Even if they don't place a camp there, people are still farming the surrounding area, so they wouldn't spawn anyway.
---
You have a crop plot to place indoors? Unless they patched it you can place a crop on top of the fire light it‚Äôs hard to do but I‚Äôve done it with corn just to test it.
---
Same here BUT, plus side, I have a bunch of nuka grapes now along with my paint!
---
I think it starts when the next song does, not right away. 
---
I tried and it seems to be patched but even if it isn't that's very ugly and costs alot of budget. 
---
either way is plausible depending on how you look at the vault, i dont think food rationing was that bad, by looks of the party remains.. maybe a lil out of shape if she didnt use the weight room in the vault. or laid around shirking duties and so on.   
---
but yeah running around the wasteland swingin a super sledge gonna buff her out quite a bit..
---
You can craft a level 20 weapon. You can‚Äôt upgrade it to a new level.
---
He contributed his reddit tears to get that perfect shade of paint.
---
After the patches they dont spawn in vendors anymore
---
The C.A.M.P. radios work fine.  They just don't start audibly playing until the next song starts (in the server-synced radio station playlist).
---
We all just want to have fun playing the game, don't judge me for what I define as fun in this game, as it was intended for people to play as raiders, so I don't see why we get so much backlash when it's literally designed for us to do this kind of thing. It's just like with ark and conan, these groups exist whether you like it or not and nothing will change that, so stop complaining about your camp getting destroyed and grow a pair, pick up your gun and fight back, that's literally all we want and if you can't handle that I'm sorry but you should find another game to play. 
---
I got the Knight this morning from the technical data quest.  Paladin coming from there as well?
---
I agree that you shouldn't be reported. It's not against any rules to play as a raider. However, you literally said you get no benefit. So, you get nothing out of it and the person you attack has to rebuild everything you broke. So don't be surprised when people get mad. 
---
Where exactly is the spawn point?
---
Hmm well I don't know what your loadout is but if you are relying on legendary effects such as bloodied, the numbers vary quite a bit and are inconsistent due to varying effects such as food or chems increasing END. This could temporarily put your HP above the threshold and make your damage output lower.
---
I believe a couple have mentioned stealth buffs/nerfs not mentioned in patch notes. I would look at like the 186 is your min damage and 311 is your max damage. Similar to old school RPGs where your damage is not a consistent number, but a range.
---
Is this the only weapon effected? 
---
So, people should stop complaining because you're RPing a raider, but all those people RPing bounty hunters are a-holes? Pot meet kettle.
---
My strength is 3. It's all the mutations I have which lower it, but increases my unarmed damage by a lot.
---
I got the armor just to cancel it out.
---
True words
---
That makes sense.  I had some squeaky voiced lvl 30-ish tyke decked out in excavator armor annoy the hell out of me about a week ago, trying to get my *** anti armor super sledge.  He could barely speak english, (not that it makes a difference, just weird that he was on a US server) and had probably half a dozen various two shot weapons in his inventory ranging from 2-3 stars.  How does that happen?
---
Have you done it before just curious it‚Äôs a very tiny spot to place it‚Äôs annoying to do and but as far as it goes that‚Äôs out only options. It would be nice to have crop planters and green house walls and sloped roofs.
---
East of ws , as the mountains rising behind the power station thing
---
Same, stacking concrete was funny while it lasted. I had one of those for a while. Now I just have a quaint little metal shack in the woods, on a lake with some water purifiers and flatland for farming adhesive/alcohol.
---
It's a two way street bud. Never claimed to be a nice guy. I said Im a raider.
---
Ash heap trees have been nice to me in terms of resin. There‚Äôs usually a good amount in close proximity to each other 
---
Had the same thing happen to me but only after going to all the trouble actually getting the key 
---
What he said. And get any instigating grognak's axe or a lvl 50 all rise if you can wait long enough to do that quest. You'll basically one shot everything in the game.
---
Also invest in 5 adrenaline. And 3 bloody mess. 
---
I had to server hop a few times then realized that I should just go directly to the dome 7 doors and somebody will have already opened it already,save a lot of trouble.
---
 I use all those perks 
---
Ugh that's so many screws.
---
Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore has also always made me think of Fallout.
---
My weapon does 190 damage per shot 
---
I've actually thought about that, and really love the idea. Maybe there could be a subscription service of like $5 a month, where the radio stations can be updated with appropriate music. 
---
Past days it happens to me also often... ‚òπÔ∏è (ps4 Europe) 
---
As nature intended 
---
you can build this fast. i'm on PC.
---
as already mentioned, do it with 1 foundation first. get the in-and-out on both sites correctly. i normally go in both directions, north-south and west-east, which helps to see if i am alligned correctly. if you have one foundation that fits, then you can add more foundations and extend your structure and it will fit again. from this point it is basically just dropping foundations and adding conduits to your existing structure.
---
Ah, the lead + acid cliff. Yes, investigated that myself.
---
With Greek letters saying lamda lamda lamda and Omega my.
---
That seems to be nerfed in last patch, 160 pounds is now 16 lead, at least for men know, twice...
---
Nice! I‚Äôll look for it, haven‚Äôt seen it yet in cranberrybog and WS 
---
If you think that‚Äôs a lot of mats wait till you start on the excavator PA quest.. 
---
Start collecting screws now, you‚Äôll need them for the rest of the game.
---
So cool how the acid is in a little cave. But that SB would just not leave me alone. And then I found this place.
---
Gyms...
---
I have done it before 
---
No you cannot upgrade the level of a weapon, though you can modify it until you find a better one. Lower level weapons have a lower damage output so it's wise to keep your weapons up to your level as well to continue doing decent damage. Higher damage output is always good due to enemies gaining more armor and Dr at higher levels. 
---
I remember stumbling upon the final location of the quest during the Beta and thought it was just a place to get a cool dress lol!
---
That would make perfect sense, only when I moved the curser (or the dot) over the bodies, the one with the dark hair (Shannon) was cradling the body with lighter hair (Olivia).
---
Incidently was Brody's body found? 
---
People who buy this stuff online are definitely culpable in making the servers unstable by feeding the duping market. 
---
I‚Äôve managed to loot 3 pieces of this armor in game and trade god roll melee weapons for the other 2. I‚Äôd like to think there‚Äôs a difference between those who grinded for this gear and those who paid real world money and still suck at PvP lol. 
---
i've never used console, i only know from youtube videos that there is some button combination (not only one button) that you can press on console to have a very smooth movement while holding a structure. 
---
No that's a different place. That place looks cool (and creepy) too. This appeared to be a working raider camp, definitely brighter, active. Looks like they have lots of cool areas to be released! 
---
Id back it fully but Im quite sure I get more musical-chairs plans from the farm south of Flatwoods, too coincidental to not be so
---
This is the issue with this game. You people take everything too seriously. It's a game not a d*ck don't take it so hard. This is a designed mechanism in the game, it's a game meant to have pvp, it's meant for people to antagonize other players, you have the option to leave the server, nobody's forcing you to stay and have your camp destroyed.
---
Place them on the edges of rugs. You should be able to pickup the rug with the plant on top of it and place the rug wherever you want. I know for a fact it works with corn razorgrain and tatos. You can also clip planters right through the crops and make it look like they're potted.
---
I never have done. If you are well equipped, farming becomes a breeze 
---
This made laugh so much, thank you kind sir for this comment.
---
Windows 10 updates are a lottery, thanks for the info.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs definitely true, I‚Äôm just saying that they don‚Äôt only spawn in treasure maps although it can seem that way since they‚Äôre super rare now. 
---
Some of them just appear on the crafting bench I think. Check there.
---
Ah, but farming while away from the springs, going back and picking through the piles, is a breeze too.
---
There's a Greek Letters plan, I'm told it's a a random daily quest reward from Biv.
---
i want the ability to play your own music, connect to spotify 
---
Optimized bracers don‚Äôt even work. Well, they don‚Äôt work for melee. I‚Äôve heard they work if you‚Äôre unarmed. But you can‚Äôt use unarmed weapons in PA, so they‚Äôre trash. 
---
Need some freaking Stabilized bracers and shit...
---
I did, nothing. 
---
Just use normal wine, not wine you made, if it bugs just relog and it should work
---
Build a greenhouse.  Put down foundations but leave a 2 by 2 (or whatever size) area of ground in the middle of your structure and farm there.
---
"The way you have fun is wrong. Go play something else. "
---
Fire station, any nuke silo, flatwood motel.
---
Looks like some kind of mod conflict
---
So far, this has really panned out. Already found 4 clusters in a short time.
---
Really. Wtf......
---
Well fiddles, went over there and it was a plan I already knew. Oh well. 
---
I have only found one so far lol but at least I'm getting plenty of scrap I suppose 
---
I haven't gotten fuck all either,and I'm lvl 98
---
It also doesn't have to be that wendigo. Any should do. There's one that spawns in the golf club at the springs from time to time, any decent melee build can 1 shot him.
---
Right, now this is done can we sort the *real* problem?  
---
*Obviously* the floor by the Harpers Ferry vendor is a death trap, crouch by the beer crates and try walking/shuffling towards the cash register. You get caught on the join between the floor pieces and have to grind your way to the right for the tiles to line up so you can walk passed.  
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Yep I brought all of them for like 15k lol
---
OMG yes.  I used to have to hunt around with my headlamp on in order to see flashferns.  The nuke zone can be really dark and monotone down  in the far southeast.  Very much appreciated.
---
Check your aid, you may have been given one, not the recipe for it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the semi auto aspect that‚Äôs limiting your DPS tho, take my .50 cal for example. It does around 65 damage per shot but the fire rate is something crazy so in the time it takes you to fire 5 shots I can probably fire 25 and that adds up over the course of a fight. 
---
The two biggest points ill make are having a dedicated shotgunner with rank 3 enforcer and priming your gun for an extra 30% damage. Pop some psycho tats for extra damage aswell. Keeping the queen on the ground and doing as much DPS as possible is paramount to having success. 
---
Only have the map mod installed, no one reported this on the nexus site either 
---
This seems to be a problem with a bunch of plans after that update.
---
It's listed in the known issues thread, so Bethesda is at least aware of it.
---
Makes me wonder if OTHER Shielded Plans spawn in the world now...
---
I would ignore it. I have exactly 0 interest in anything to do with PVP.
---
It would be funny to watch griefers rage though. 
---
&gt;Nice, but *way* harder to do with a console controller compared to a mouse and keyboard.
---
I'm on xbox :p  
---
&gt;Clipping the conduit through the walls by removing and replacing the walls instead of using the pass-through connectors is a workable "cheat" since it exploits an error.
---
Use what works in my opinion... why over complicate it? I could likely do it without clipping through the walls as well but if you want a better aesthetic that will remove bulky connectors. The tools and the objects that are there are what we have to work with and how we use them is up to our own ingenuity.  
---
&gt;I'm working "overhead" on a second floor so placing those corners nearly three stories above the ground is problematic at best.
---
Just build a temporary half-floor walkway around the outside on the second floor... sort of like this:

First off bud, I'm playing the game as intended so if you got a problem you can go play Minecraft or something because quite frankly I don't care what you say. I'm trying to make a point to improve my own experience as well as my friends because it's almost impossible to have fum In games like these when all we get is hate when all we want is to have a good time like everyone else, if it causes you pain or discomfort, boo-hoo here's a tissue. 
---
Are you sure it said recipe and not just tick blood tequila. Yesterday I completed Biv's quest and thought that I got a recipe for the ballistic bock, but instead I got the item ballistic bock and the Greek letters plan for my camp. 
---
That's the place.  
---
I think the rocket launcher spawn is supposed to be a bathroom, just half of the house is missing.  
---
I've been through there *several* times but only had the helmet spawn once.  
---
It spawns as the item not plans, but you learn the plans when you scrap it.  
---
If you're on pc I can craft you one this evening.
---
Time restrictions? Can you elaborate?
---
Say what?
---
Yes ^ 
---
I‚Äôve lived in Morgantown pretty much since day one and he for sure travels through there.  He‚Äôs stopped by my camp several times.
---
The mountain trail near Cliffwatch in the Savage divide has at least six.
---
Good laugh. I guess you and your whole party isnt reported to oblivion for killing others in Pvp.
---
You could pick through the bodies of anything your turrets hit.
---
Yeah this is awful. I wish they'd just reset at midnight or something logical, not the last time you did a thing. 
---
Sorry I misread your post. I thought you meant that was happening since the 76 update. You'll probably get better answers in the Nexus forums if it's an issue with the mod itself.
---
Not much to eat there, really. They're supposed to be pretty emaciated.
---
kinda the thought i had, "oh i cant raid the minutemen wont stop hunting me!! its not fair!" 
---
after standing on a soapbox about farmers complaining about raiders.
---
I don‚Äôt even listen to the radio anymore I‚Äôm so over all the songs.  This would bring my love back for Appalachian radio. 
---
Fallout 76 demands more than those games 
---
If they have some nice skins for weapons especially my beloved shotguns and 50 cal, I will definitely buy them. Different camos for PAs would be awesome. Come on where is my digicamo, desert tan? Flecktarn would be perfect for wooded areas. I‚Äôve seen the ‚Äòfour horsemen‚Äô designs but aren‚Äôt those a little too much for post-apocalyptic scenarios lol. Awesome for office desktop figures though. 
---
Yes our wallets are our best voting machines. 
---
Oh right. You see that requires 0 skill, and is that really a fun way to spend your time?
---
They still haven't fixed the dumb scrap all junk bulk issue rest in peace
---
&gt; Yeah, but newer music would have likely been entirely digital, so boom, no more new music.
---
Holo-tapes. Hell, 80s-era video games are Canon. There would be plenty of shit around. 
---
Hahaha, good point üòÖ
---
I'll check again when I log back in later, but I hadnt seen it previously. 
---
I've been arguing this point a lot recently as well and I'm not even a raider. Some people have suggested that you dress as a raider if you are rp-ing as a raider. Others have suggested you simply use area chat and make your intentions clear-- "gimme your junk or I'll destroy your base". Even others have said to save it for workshops only or wait for pvp servers. Either way people really don't want to see raiders on pve servers even though raiders have always been a part of Fallout lore.
---
And the other thing is most people classify all raiders as griefers. I believe there is a fineine between raiding and griefing. 
---
Indeed more old country or bluegrass would be good as well as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsnZxfkkoKQ)
---
Yea sir but I have a better bos paint which is paladin for offer my GT is jeanzyy msg me 
---
No he probably has an extremely op build with a two shot armor piercing weapon or explosive would be my best guess
---
i just crafted a combat knife and it registered (yesterday)
---
I'll check again later, started getting frustrated in my 4th comb through my Inventory earlier and just logged out. 
---
Is that the quest you get from the broken holotape? 
---
10x your level?  The reward for the wanted player surviving the event should be the same, then.
---
I should mention, no I was not wanted, he had not started capturing the workshop before shooting me but I would be curious if that matters, the dude was just going around taking workshops from low levels, clearly a nice boy
---
Me neither, mate. And it seems we're a rare breed...
---
I fought it out for about 30 mins with a level 250+ griefer yesterday.  I have a large amount of missle with a few heavy laser and heavy machine gun.  The second he started firing they opened up.  He'd hop all around but they wouldn't miss and it took considerable health off him.
---
Skill? You mean like buying sentinel assassins gear from eBay and trolling people, or walking arround wanted waiting for someone to claim the bounty so your friend can kill them and take their caps and any junk they had on them?
---
I need that carpet for my bar, thanks for the screenshot.. 
---
On my way home üëçüòä
---
Wait. You mean that there is a radio?
---
Guys I was just looking for an honest opinion but please don‚Äôt argue with each other it‚Äôs not worth it. Thanks to everyone who gave me answers, I will most likely get fallout
---
I've been looking since then as well. Tried to farm place where people say they spawn to no luck.ivw done a bunch if maps to no result as well. 
---
Well bud, if you don't care what other people say, why did you post your gripes/complaints on a social media platform built upon other people responding to what you are saying?
---
You're not going to get an improved experience, bud.  People in this subreddit (the majority)  don't give a shit about PVP and hate people who are RPing as "raiders."
---
 If you aren't having fun follow your own advice and go play something else instead of complaining about it, bud.
---
Bud.
---
Darmok and Jalad
---
Would that mean I could infect my trees with a glowing resin virus or something?
---
That‚Äôs a good idea, no extra stuff to add to the room. Just awards it to you automatically when complete. 
---
I use it automatically 
---
Likely mods, could be corrupted files. 
---
I didnt hear an explosion (weren't they supposed to have fixed those?) 
---
Fun game
---
so, i tried to find the combination that you need on console and found it for PC ...
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yd3pc/pc\_camp\_building\_controls/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yd3pc/pc_camp_building_controls/)
---
something similiar should be available on console.
---
Just like in real life, the lock is useless.  If someone wants to get in, they will.  They'll shoot out a wall, (or break a window in real life) and it slowed them down by a few seconds.  The strange thing is that there's nothing to steal in 76.  
---
I don't lock my car doors anymore, nor do I leave anything remotely valuable in it.  I got sick of spending $300 to replace a window once or twice a year, not to mention hauling the shop-vac from the basement to clean out all the broken glass.  I still find pieces here and there.  The worst I get now is an open glovebox and maybe my seat put out of position.
---
Yep and imagine how hard it is when you have a purple headlamp on your PA, that‚Äôs me lol 
---
Not mods for 100%. Also he reinstalled the whole game and it didn't help.
---
In the 100s here and solo the whole time. I still have lots of fun and most of the people I've run across have been fine. Just a handful of griefers and dbs that I've been able to server hop away from. 
---
They are on Ebay for around $40-75. Skip a night at the club and get a set
---
You are correct in saying the above doesn't take skill, but it's irrelevant to this discussion
---
You‚Äôre a dirtbag.  
---
X01 is best for nuke zones with best radiation resistance,
---
T51 has the best ballistic and energy resistance but low radiation resistance so it is not suited for nuke zones.
---
Ultracite kind in the middle ground between the X01 and T51
---
Exvacator best for farming with an extra 200 weight bonus
---
So it does depend on what you will be doing
---
Did any one actually look at the picture? It's a shit load of spotlights. üòÇü§£üò≠üëå
---
That's because of 2 reasons:
---
1) available from early lvls,
---
2) only one offering up to 200 extra carry weight
---
Apart from that stat wise it's good enough for any pve situation.
---
I don't think there is a plan in the game¬ø?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong. 
---
The skill in this game is severely lacking, so why make things harder on one's self by not just going with the flow. Monkey see monkey do man.
---
&gt;he had not started capturing the workshop before shooting me
---
You can contest a workshop from anywhere inside it now.  Since the update before this one I believe.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take much of a build to do enough damage to one shot people.  So claiming a workshop leaves you open to be killed quickly.  Even at high level can be one shot.  
---
And that's my issue, we're stigmatised as grievers from the get-go and I and my group don't use any exploits or those god forsaken two shot explosive weapons to attack other players and we mainly only attack workshops. (Should've added that to original post but there wasn't room) and it's understandable to make the assumption that raiders are grievers but it's just not fair to those who are legit doing it for RP reasons and not just to be an Asshole. 
---
No plans.  Only loose mods from the Enclave Armory. 
---
the truth
---
And it burns burns burns
---
Check out the subreddit FalloutTradingPost 
---
No plans exist.  Mod only.  Go to the Bazaar or Market and buy one.   I have only seen three of them in four months‚ÄîRNG will not save you.  
---
each person on the map gets their own station where they can play their own music üòÇ
---
What a lame design choice, thanks for the info
---
Yup. That one is a good spot. I went there for my razor grain, since I don‚Äôt have any at my camp. That‚Äôs also where I originally went to get my crops for my adhesive farm. 
---
When you take a workshop you get a warning that you open yourself up to pvp. If he wasn't actively contesting your workshop it's possible one of his teammates was, which allows him to do full damage. If you hadn't claimed a workshop he would have still been doing slap damage and youd have been fine.
---
I boiled water
---
Bethesda has never actually fixed anything, they've always relied on the modding community to do their job for them, fo76 is a different beast all together though.
---
Thanks :) 
---
Someone posted this playlist very early at launch. I use it A LOT.
---
That would be very interesting and would make living next to trees a bonus.
---
Yeah I had to steal the sword back from an alt. Sadd
---
FO3, NV, and 4... I always had the radio on. No matter how many times I rehears the same song. 
---
The djs made it worth it with different quips and intros and game world updates. 
---
I don‚Äôt bother with the radio in 76. 
---
What if a billion dollar company ran on making money from good games, not working on donations like it‚Äôs taking charity 
---
Hope this helps man, I've dropped the same knowledge bomb like 5 times in 3 days, thinkin' this stuff needs to be in a sticky thread.

reposted from earlier this week
---
Perhaps 10X is too high, but it should be high enough to create a disincentive to wanton destruction and attract players to the event. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be opposed to a higher reward for players who survive, just tossing ideas around really. 
---
As for an accidental disconnection, maybe that‚Äôs the risk one runs when attacking others? 
---
I'm currently level 82 with a instigating super sledge, 40% swing speed 90% less carry weight but when it comes to behemoths I seem to struggle to do damage specially if they legendary (I get the job done just takes longer then needs too) 
---
When I see these,it calls for a orbital strike,done it a few times,and will continue to,ppl harvesting xp when there not even there to earn it,fuck that.
---
In your pip boy, yep
---
Sweet! Time to secure my camp!
---
By T-51 do you mean ultracite?
---
I completely agree. Before I even knew this update was coming out i had bought all the atom shop bar signs and the valentines day fairy lights and turned my camp into a bar. Now I just feel more stuff will make the environment in my bar feel better.

Visit her bunker its ne on map. Check her terminal. No need to complete other quest, i went  straight there

Are movies that are twice as long twice as good?
---
I'm on now, hit me up. PSN Attinctus
---
With the amount of turrets we can have now, I witnessed first hand that they do cause considerable damage.  Several missile, heavy laser, and a few heavy machine gun, they take a good bit of damage quickly.  Enough for me to see the alert and server hop before any real damage is done.  Whether defending in person, or server hopping, the most anyone has ever done is knock down 2 walls or hit 2 things inside.  
---
How much for two handmades
---
They claimed to fix two shot explosive weapons but it's still a guaranteed one shot on wanted players. 
---
Not for that door
---
That‚Äôs what she said.  
---
I have, and in on Xbox.. major stuttering, and a lot of crashing. The game freezes with a loud buzzing noise, and either crashes to dashboard, or i have to manually close the game
---
That‚Äôs kinda a horrible idea - I can see paying for a radio once but no one is going to pay 5 dollars for an Ingame radio when you could pay 10 dollars for Spotify premium and just listen to whatever you want

These plans exist afaik, maybe not small scale so I agree but I think there‚Äôs a few things 
---
The skill is clearly lacking on your behalf, many people play this game to have fun. But you do you
---
If you‚Äôre already running around Whitesprings, there is the dumbbell in the fire station, cans everywhere, and rat poison. 
---
If you have caps to burn, you can always buy bulk lead from vendors if you‚Äôre desperate enough. 
---
when i try to allign it i start with one foundation and 3 walls. i place one passthrough first into the first wall and look at the outside. about half of the black rubber should sticks out of the wall. then i extend the conduit by an angel to the other corner and attach another passthrough conduit there and adjust this setup until both passthrough conduits have half of the black rubber visible on the outside. after this i extend to the opposite wall and "hope" that the   
---
 rubber of that passthrough conduit also sticks out about half of it. the smaller the building is the less critical is the "about half of the rubber" part. the building in the picture above is not perfectly fit on both sites but it is still ok for a 5 foundation building, so it is quite forgiving.
---
I‚Äôd like to know what perks you‚Äôre using to get it to 190 per shot. The TSE I have is semi- auto and with full rifleman perks does 148 damage per shot. I logged in to give you accurate info so my TSE .50 cal does 94 damage per shot at a fire rate of 90, with the prime receiver it‚Äôs closer to 120 DPS.
---
Depends on what the player is wearing and their health level, type of gun used by douchebag, and many different factors. Asshat could have used a bloodied/instigating/anti armor, could have been running an unyielding melee build. Point is, trolls will allways troll. Report, ignore, hop.
---
Chaged XBOX ONE X now !
---
Yeah that's a pretty common occurrence, but earlier the door loaded in and said "inaccessible", very strange but i joined a different server and everything was back to normal.
---
I was just thinking the same thing when I logged out.  I think my character is going to have acute pancreatitis soon.  He's been on a non-stop bender ever since the update.  I mean, yesterday he drank a full bottle of rum, vodka, bourbon, whisky and several local craft beers, and I "went easy" today by just sticking to beer.  I think I had the better part of a 30 pack while vending and taking a loop around whitesprings, watoga and harper's ferry.  I quit playing for the day while passed out on a rotten mattress just outside of Pleasant Valley Station.  
---
My sniper is going to have some heavy DTs tomorrow.  Paranoia, shooting at peripheral flickers, can't keep the rifle steady, dropping ammo everywhere....it's gonna be a mess.  
---
Maybe a lil hair-o-the-dog hoo boy, but then I'm quittin' fer good \*hic.
---
You‚Äôre right- I thought I saw them a lot at Watoga, but I haven‚Äôt found them lately. But today I was awarded one Chainsaw Flamer mod from a treasure map. It‚Äôs yours for 200 caps if you‚Äôre still looking for them :)
---
My first spawn after the servers came back up was the re-enactor.  I‚Äôve saw him three times yesterday. 
---
Certainly lacking in the Super department.
---
I‚Äôll give this try, thank you for the info!
---
Whitesprings station right at the spawn turn right. One right on the tree there then run west for another then south down the road above bunker is two or three more
---
I just tried boiling water, didn't complete the challenge.
---
I just crafted a combat knife and that did complete the challenge.
---
Then why play for 850 hours if you're not having fun???????
---
Yes this has been a major pain in the ass since two patches ago. It appears that in one of the patches they truncated the objects‚Äô ID so that the items can no longer be properly identified. 
---
A quick example, I have four pump shotguns including a TSE, a quad, a bloodied, and a vampire. If I place them all in the stash and pull one out into my inventory, the system will always flash the 3D rotation thing on screen, with the wrong weapon name. The system can no longer tell which is which.
---
Yes the hot wheel has been broken ever since. I used to be able to have all four shotguns on it, now every time when I log off and log back in, three will go missing, the one left will have wrong name. 
---
Looks like the global ID of the items have components that are either missing or aren‚Äôt being picked up by the system. Maybe they should add a local ID specific to individual players‚Äô inventory so each item can be properly identified. 
---
I anecdotally am seeing the same issue. Much, much reduced spawn rate. Also, they haven‚Äôt fixed legendary drops. Had a 3 star drop nothing (waited 10 minutes) and I received a shiny syringer from the Queen. I don‚Äôt get this need to nerf legendary items. 
---
All I can think of is just build at an unnamed raider camp, there‚Äôs quite a few in the savage divide near the named ones
---
Awesome feature would to be able to snap roofs to the posts that are under the stairs section so we could make a canopy style roof without walls so it could be wide open.
---
All the commando perks so 60% damage 
---
Bloody mess 10% 
---
Tweaked receiver better damage automatic and Armor penetration 
---
Stinging mag Armor penetrating 
---
The perk for rifles that ignores 36% armor
---
Adrenaline 60% damage when getting consecutive kills 
---
The gun which is TSE 
---
Xbox has been a giant step backwards. Lag/Disconnect. It‚Äôs like we are back to pre patch 5. 
---
Congrats looks awesome got my first one last night at LVL 120, the knight version. Maybe chances for the paint plans are better now?
---
They really just need to hurry up and separate the PvP and PvE players. It would be a better experience for everyone involved.
---
Yup. Set your pip-boy to your stats screen. You can see your AP in the lower right. Exit pip boy, start a power attack, open pip boy. Check AP loss. Now put on (or take off, depending on the order you‚Äôre doing this in) a Modded Arm. Do it again. No Change in AP usage
---
I second this notion
---
Getting down votes for wanting a fair pvp system smh
---
Agree. Make it So Bethesda!
---
500+ and full steam ahead!!!
---
Are you on PC? I love my raider underarmors and would love to get them decked out. I'm not rolling in wealth, but I can bring mats and tip.
---
Maybe they need to separate PvP and PvE players, because PvP is supposed to be optional, but clearly it's not. When someone's reduced damage can kill me in seconds while I'm at a vendor, something is broken.
---
I did my first nuke launch today. I play solo so it was tedious. I finally launch a nuke on WS and there's like 3 ghouls to kill. I'm incredibly underwhelmed by the whole thing. 
---
Just remember to ask for the extra sauce.  They don't just give it to you, you gotta ***ask***.
---
Too much to post.  Just read the patch notes yourself on Bethesda‚Äôs website. 
---
Nothing with nuka cola, just an enclave laboratory.
---
I've been playing Bethesda games since Morrowind, I'm not going to let a few angsty youngins ruin all my fun. It is aggravating that "opting out" isn't enough though.
---
The change that needs to occur is remove player markers on the map.
---
So you‚Äôre factoring that into the damage, what is the base damage before all those perks. Only the rifleman perks
---
Started it during the BETA and it was what got me hooked. What really blew my mind was discovering that we end up being the original &gt;!mysterious strangers.!&lt;
---
125
---
I switched from prototype to Vault-Tec paint after thirsting for a better blue a week or so back. Annnd here we are with the Quantum paint. Basically Vault-Tec minus a few of the yellow details and a different logo. 
---
Still like Vault-Tec more, but mannnn I looked awesome sticking out as the only blue sore thumb at the SBQ....
---
Yeah dude 40 ms is horrid.
---
just to let you know. you also use normal conduits to go through indoor walls.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/SYnhbHY](https://imgur.com/a/SYnhbHY)
---
we have wall A, B and C. the circuit is going from outside-A-B-C-outside and the passthrough wall B is done using a normal conduit.
---
125 damage 
---
I like that idea better. It's just with how the gaming industry is, you know subscriptions are on their way. 
---
Good sign I suppose! I heard something about like 153 bug fixes 
---
Meh, suite yourself. I'll have fun farming more efficiently then you, and selling my wares to the people who kill you, to take your caps, so they can buy more stuff, from me. At least untill they make it a no build zone, then I'll just go back to farming watoga.
---
Datamining is such a cheat way at finding new stuffs.
---
Needs more outlaw country!!!!!!!
---
I miss the pre whitesprings nerf when it was pure chaos after a nuke would drop. They really need to buff areas with more hoards and mini bosses. Nuking whitesprings is fun because you would kill 100 or so ghouls and new you could possibly get a god roll item. I truly love this game but they need to add more hoards in areas so there is more then just a few places to nuke, and have them set in a wave style or something so it feels worth it to nuke places and it‚Äôs not just 3 minutes or fighting/running around then it‚Äôs done. 
---
Yep, I sold mine and luckily caught on to it before I sold the voice of set. That one upgraded to lvl50 is pretty decent against robots. 
---
*H20Delirious heavy breathing and exclaiming ‚ÄúTeddy Bear, I found you!!!‚Äù intensifies*
---
There's some really classic reddit posts there, if you sort by top you'll see some...pretty interesting things.  Plus, tree law!
---
I think that would solve this issue but, honestly, I hope Bethesda doesn't make that change.  I like to travel to lower level characters and give them level appropriate gear that I think they could use.  Sometimes I will build fully modded low level guns for them, sometimes I'll give them low level legendaries.  
---
I do it on a whim if I pick up a piece of low level gear and will specifically look for players in the world who are at an appropriate level to use it.  
---
It would kind of bum me out to not be able to do that anymore.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
This tactic/exploit has been around for a while now but it has become increasingly popular recently. I assume because a lot of the un banned players are salty and want to take revenge any way possible.
---
THIS IS GRIEFING. Using an exploit to kill other players is definitely griefing. There is no reason why you should be automatically flagged for pvp across the map outside of the workshop area. The people that do this are the lowest pieces of scum in fo76 currently. Stalking you and exploiting the fact that you can be open to pvp *away* from the workshop. Its not a fair fight in any way, shape or form. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt want to spoil anything for you.
---
Wow didn't even know you can do that. That's bugged I think. You should only be allowed to fight at the workshop area. That's some evil shit lol
---
If fo76 gets any sort of subscription based service I would not think that many people at all would continue playing so I hope they don‚Äôt cuz the new updates are dragging me and some of my friends back in
---
My baseball bat can.
---
Yes, if you haven't done it, you should.
---
So here's my problem : Fucking with people's camps is currently not balanced. If you destroy someone's radiation arch, it costs stable flux to repair, which as we all know could actually take at least a couple hours to farm if you're solo. Also, if you destroy just one thing in a cap, your 5 cap bounty works as a "cap condom" so you only lose those 5 caps when you die, but if someone engages you and loses, they lose the full cap amount.  
---
So with all that, I'm pretty sure people like you who role-play "Raiders" also understand all of that, but don't care. So yea, Its tough for people to be okay with what you do when you're using game's system to make the way you play basically have you lose nothing while others lose hours of progress.
---
I was looking for stuff to do today too lol 
---
Suit* also, I don't have any caps so PvP isn't an issue. I probably have farmed way more legedaries than you have anyway
---
I want to rebuild the Order in another Fallout game.
---
Most folks who are inconsiderate like to justify their behavior by falsely claiming that ‚Äúeveryone is doing it.‚Äù   
---
I haven't picked it up in a while. 
---
Dang :/
---
Its against the terms to chase people into servers and attack them. 
---
What you are doing is a bannable offense. Im just letting you know. 
---
This post should also be removed for witch hunting. Reported.
---
Yeah before this weekend I hadn‚Äôt played it since January so I hope they take it the right direction but idk
---
Should I report them?  I don't want to be *that* person but, I have to admit, I'm really irked by this.  
---
Oh well, time for day drinking.
---
Yeah your setup isn‚Äôt bad but I‚Äôd definitely prime that gun and maybe put the drum magazine on it so you don‚Äôt have to reload as much. Makes me wonder if your friends are pulling their weight. Just keep in mind strategy is everything. Having someone who can keep the queen on the ground is almost necessary. A couple bloodied melee or heavy gunners will do work aswell. 
---
Just picked up the under armor plan! Thanks for sharing this with us! 
---
You go to the right into the social menu. Then look on the list of recent players. You'll see a white dot next to the person who invited you.
---
Some workshops just aren't worth it anymore. Especially food and ammo. But overall, I've noticed that pvp'ers like to go there when others are around. I'ts the only pvp zones in the game, so i don't blame them either. I just claim and leave. 
---
If you really need a lot of one type of resource, build your camp at an extractor mine. 
---
They fixed or mostly fixed the problems you mentioned. TS and E is nerfed, apparently the gatplasma doesn't break instantly but I haven't tested it myself, it saves your camp so you can place it again, wait til next time, or go to a server where your camp is. The duping keeps getting fixed and dupers find another way. Your camp budget will be better as will your stash.
---
This is not GTA5 online
---
"Insert stupid hive mind observation, pun or joke." Collect karma. &lt; reddit in a nutt shell
---
Look under social&gt; recent &gt;"‚Ä¢ 'player name who sent the invite'"
---
I don‚Äôt either man I play as a trader for my team (8 of us total) and buy and sell a lot of items. So this bug is kinda ruining it for me. Really love the update except this part. I got 2 steel from a 2 star Gutsy last night as well after doing AWOL armaments which is usually a incredible event for me. Pre patch we‚Äôve ended up getting a bloodied explosive western, a two shot/ + 25% faster fire rate crossbow all kinds of cool things but now it‚Äôs just different. 
---
You may OCCASIONALLY be griefed. I've had it happen a couple times, once by a crew of 4 dressed up as the Suicide Squad. If it does happen just jump servers. Other than that though, most people are wanting to give you stuff, because inventory space is so limited and they don't want to just throw it away.
---
Not sure where it is in the build menu but it‚Äôs posted at every train station so go to one of those if you really wanna start the quest line. 
---
I think my problem is teammates not pulling their weight 
---
Believe he was referring to the new quest that was just added. You go and get a quest to get a drink recipe, once you have completed it you need to wait 24 hours before you can go back and get another. 
---
If you are playing from the beginning I wouldn't be too concerned with that. I have over 130 hours played and still haven't completed the main quest line. I could have done it much sooner but spent a lot of time just messing around. 
---
There are no time restrictions in regard to about you can play the game. Just ones for some quest and vendor cap resets.
---
You bring up a good point
---
Can confirm. Legendary Protectrons blow up instantly on death in Watoga. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Lootable corpses are not able to be found after explosions for me sometimes. 
---
I think awareness of work shop mechanics is important because this is a common tactic but it's part of the work shop design. Why do you think you should be able to hold a world shop with out defending it ? If I want to keep a work shop I usually hide with chameleon and wait to defend it. When I do leave I stay on sneak mode. 
---
I couldn't find it either. Just find the poster on any train station and search it. It'll start the quest line.
---
Could be one of the "stores" alt account. You'll probably see these rifles resold for 3-6k at some point sadly.
---
You have to get it from the Atom Shop first. Once you have it, it'll be in the category where the paintings and other posters are.
---
If you use 5 cap bounties to reduce your cap losses in pvp, you're griefing. Its unfortunate, but right now its not balanced for the people defending their camp. Other Pvp is fine, but not surprising that people get upset when you destroy thier camp since the punishment currently doesn't fit the crime.
---
My technical data turn-ins stopped working; one of the reasons I stopped playing a while back... Have they fixed the gatling gun to where you can properly aim down the sights? The 5mm crank one.
---
Cute, you know I'm right, and not having any better argument you go after my spelling, score 1 for you I guess. Hey, if you need some caps I got plenty. And I doubt it. There aren't that many people left that have put in as much time as I have. My main is 213, and I've deleted characters from lvl 50 to lvl 100+, over 600 hours in game, not the most time by a long shot, but no slouch either.
---
They don't like challenge in PVP, because every day they face mental challenges IRL, their brains are mediocre...
---
Wtf am I even looking at? 
---
Lucky as ever.
---
Thanks!
---
I wish they would add a channel that lets you use your own music files.
---
This "exploit" has been around for a long time now so I'm pretty sure BGS knows about it. I think people effected should keep being vocal about it and save video footage showing exactly what happened. Your description of what happened what very detailed so I knew exactly what you were talking about. It's on you to decide if you should or shouldn't report... Do you want to see this happen to other players by the same guy...? 
---
81 days later and still awesome.
---
That's where I got mine yesterday
---
Ooo maybe I‚Äôll be able to see them now.
---
Aww man triple flora? My god ..but with super duper u can essentially craft quadruple things (double the flora picked..and then it produces double of those) if u see what I'm saying 
---
I have a [steel lookout tower](https://youtu.be/1I6T0Hls00k) at the moment.
---
I had a [church in the mire](https://youtu.be/pLIos9gVrZ4) before that and my next one is going to be a trading gatehouse. I have it half planned in my head already.
---
Btw those are YouTube links above. I know some people don't like video links.
---
Now that you mention it was a combat knife and you run an unyielding build it makes sense. I was thinking you were talking about at full health. 
---
There was a reason to do that. They would just board off the workshop area and make it impossible to contest, so it needed to be changed.
---
There‚Äôs no meat on them to eat.
---
Pretty sure hes a random spawn in that location. I jumped 1 time and got him my second time.
---
I think I should have the option to defend.  I didn't.  At that moment, if I realized someone was claiming, I would have just let it go.  I was doing other things.  Instead I was hunted down and killed before I even knew PvP had initiated.  
---
If I hadn't been in the middle of something, I would have stored my junk and gone to defend.  And I would have *known* that I was entering PvP and would have been as prepared as they were.
---
Some of the team based quests have been scaled now so that they reflect the number of participants, so they are doable by one person. Back on the Beat and Feed the People can still get a little froggy because of people in the area that add to the participant total but aren't actually there doing the event.
---
Actually you only get a bounty the first time. If they seek revenge it marks both teams as hostile towards each other, thereby bypassing the bounty system. I did get like 68 caps for the first kill though. 
---
Which quest?
---
Yup, I've put in over 400 on my Xbox, and close to 300 on my pc. Got 10 characters in total, all are over level 60 with my main on Xbox at level 215 and on pc my main is 190 something. I've put in over 700 hours in total, been playing since beta. I rest my case
---
Not sure if you can report someone for using a function in the game but if you want Bethesda to sort through another report that won‚Äôt matter, sure why not! 
---
At the end of the day when you claim a workshop it tells you that you‚Äôre enabling yourself to PvP, a lot of people think this only means at the workshop but now you know that‚Äôs not the case. Bethesda is working on changes to these things but at the end of the day workshops give you an advantage so it should come with some kind of detriment aswell. Hopefully Survival mode will give us PvPers more chances to engage with people but until then I‚Äôd expect this to happen most times you claim a workshop. 
---
probably would ignore it altogether, have no interest in pvp at all, did it long enough to get the achievement going after bounties back in beta but other than that unless they standin right next to me i dont bother with it.  
---
someone attacks my camp i force close game and come back. really have no interest in it.   
---
if they were fast enough to level my camp, pretty sure it still works i can move camp and pay a few caps to repair it, so thats not much of a complaint from me.  
---
my gear is set for pve, i havent invested in invincibility gear nor want to carry a set on me to equip when need arises, when i met a wanna be griefer couple weeks ago, right before tse nerf and a 1200 dmg per shot shotgun to the face and chest did nothing to his health bar tells me pvp is broken and pointless.   
---
i get that some people wanna play "raiders" and i dont care if they do, but if a see em ill just jump servers, however many times it takes to find one i can be left alone in.
---
Seen him near the overseer camp
---
Camo rouge
---
That‚Äôs awesome, there are some amazingly nice people out there.  Happy wastelanding! üëç
---
And it burns, burns, burns
---
/u/JagerMU Did you get the Paladin paint from the drop box for tech docs? I always farm docs, but haven't had any luck with any new paints.
---
Normally it resets every 20 hours 
---
This happened to me an a level 34 I had been hanging out with for a few nights in a row last night.  A level 200 something waved at us and then one shot us with a combat knife.  I didn‚Äôt even pull out a weapon as I just assumed he had all his PvP perks on and was below 20% health and I had all my quality of life perks on.  I knew it was due to someone in his squad contesting a workshop across the map but the level 34 just logged off.  I felt bad for the lower level, if you are just starting the game and don‚Äôt know that mechanic it‚Äôs not going to keep you playing thinking at any time a high level can one shot you.  If you‚Äôre more than 100 yards from the edge of a workshop then you should not be in PvP as it‚Äôs really not a contested workshop it‚Äôs just griefing.  
---
That's normal ghoul behavior. They do that in Fallout 4 too.
---
Its 20 hours from your FIRST Transaction AFTER they've refreshed. 
---
Say you dont play Monday. You hit vendors between 1145 and midnight Tuesday, they'll refresh by 8pm Wednesday. 
---
you are all playing it wrong. sentinel armor/serendipity/dodgy is essencial for this build. i kill 99,98% of the players i pvp with and i can easily solo 3 scorchbeasts at once without dying
---
Pls fix, Bethesda!
---
The majority of us are! 
---
Yeah, a month makes a difference in knowledge, I run all those now and slay pretty much everything w/o dying. 
---
Yup. It would be cool to have gotten the Mysterious Magnum like in FONV though.
---
Find the mothman poster in your camp build menu and then scroll left to see the party invite poster.
---
Hey man I finally got the key butt not the plan :/ thanks tho
---
Thanks! It was there for me in the Mothman menu. And yes, it's to the left, which is odd and probably part of why people miss it - you would expect new things to be to the right of the previously added things.
---
And no I do not use any mods 
---
Yeah i noticed it aswell, reloading goes slow 
---
Could be.
---
Know your enemy.
---
Wow, do you even know what a vagina feels like bro? And I thought I was spending too much time in game. take a shower man, walk away for a bit, you might just get over yourself for a second or two. BTW I ain't that far behind you, and could probably catch up real damn quick, apparently I just have more shit to do outside of the game then you do.
---
Ha I‚Äôve been hoarding them shits in the hopes we get to display them with the upcoming feature.... but I have a bad feeling it‚Äôs not going to let us decorate like we think we should.
---
The Voice aint bad though. I don't know if it has random effects or if it was a bug but that thing was setting mutants on fire for me once. I was hoping we could trade in the dress for the coat.
---
I think it might be. The terminal, perhaps to do the transaction, and the dispenser spits out your purchases?
---
Amen.. 
---
alright thx bro, was now hoping about 20 times and just one combat helmet but i got the right location :))
---
Are you sure it isn't in the patch notes? Most patch notes read like EULA agreements. As in they have an unreadable ammount of text. 
---
Awww, man.
---
I liked being one of the few with the keys to that bunker.
---
Not because of the paint.
---
I used to take the outfits and leave them at the Overseer's Camp as a nice little surprise for people.
---
500+. I don't feel so bad though because some people here have 750.
---
I also have this problem 
---
No what I mean is there is this extreme brightness to the game. Like someone cranked the brightness slider very high up. Notice the white haze at the top of the screen, which goes away when you pull up the pipboy.
---

Just got the plans at Watoga and stared unlocking mods like crazy. I'm level 120 so it's definitely not locket to lower levels anymore.  Can craft up to level 50 handmades.  Need more springs... 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs my heavies main gun... and it still, it‚Äôs off and to the right with the he Gunner scope. Tech data still works, still insane RNG. I got 3 initiate paint jobs in 100 turn ins.. none of the new ones yet 
---
&gt; saying they get 1 hit by other player
---
Which is always someone who never paid attention to the prompt that pops up every single time you take a workshop.  The game isn't glitched, it's not the other player has an overpowered duped weapon, it's not some exploit, it's the failure to pay attention to the warning prompt that you're opening yourself to PvP.
---
A lot of melee damage can be gained with the right buffs, using things such as chems, alcohol, and food. Fury is my drug of choice giving an additional 30% on melee damage, with the perk Party Boy maxed out whiskey will give you 6 more strength, and glowing meat steak will give you an additional 10% melee damage.
---
Along with that, mutations will help a great deal. Twisted muscles for starters, and carnivore will double the benefits of meat food, increasing the benefit of the glowing meat steak.
---
If you want even more damage, you can always go into the full on bloodied build, taking the nerd rage perk and adrenal reaction mutation.
---
With all the above, I crank out damage well into the thousands, one-shotting most everything other than the SBQ. Hopefully this helps!
---
Thanks a lot pal, I find that they are a pain.
---
There's not many interiors in the game, actually. If you notice most towns and areas don't have any interior cells, to cut down on load times. Though they could have made one a bit bigger
---
Here's the issue, is that if it wasn't map wide, you could easily cheese defending workshops. Its also possible that its a game-play restriction, like the system needs to mark you as hostile across the map so that when you go to defend you're both contesting the workshop and hostile to the attacking player.  
---
I understand being frustrated that you were hunted by other players, but unfortunately, workshops are not your personal camp, and are balanced because of that. You just can't take a workshop if you aren't willing to handle other players.  
---
Don't blame this on pvp, its the fact that people have a general misunderstanding about what workshops are. They are the INTENDED PvP zones, and are supposed to be treated as such. Basically, taking a workshop is effectively flagging you for pvp. That's the trade off you get for passively getting a ton of resources. 
---
lucky hole mine, easy to walk out of with over 300 ore in less than 20-30min with excavator armor.. smelt it down for a ton of lead scrap. absolute easiest way to get the most lead in the game.  
---
took a new player there last night i slow walked him through the mine showing him how to find all the ore nodes and i am pretty sure he missed quite a few but he left with 384 ore, smelted about half of it and had 554 lead scrap and still half a pile to smelt when he built up more acid. 
---
I stopped doing challenges because they never track correctly.
---
Like the one where you have to kill all the "big" monsters like Scorchbeast Queen and Behemoths and stuff.
---
I did those all several times and it *still* hasn't completed for me.
---
Well, right now I'm melee and have all heavy metal (brutal). Energy resist is only aabout a 120, but around 500 ballistic resistance. Can't remember what the full marine resistance was, but just remember it was much lower on the ballistic resist and the ER and DR was lower than the heavy combat armor. Doesn't dense only protect you from explosives? How much does that help? 
---
That makes sense then. Thanks. 
---
and thx for taking time
---
True but I don't technically consider this griefing either. They are adding much risk to their own game play by making other players invisible on the over map and bounty hunters will target them. A nice fix to this particular "grief" would be make the wanted players team also wanted and not show other players on the map. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Enclave Modus terminal has had them
---
I get it can be a bit of a shock if you don't understand how they work. When taking a work shop you basically enter PVP no matter if you are pacafist or not. It does warn you when you claim a work shop but I feel a lot of people don't take it seriously. Any time you hold a work shop trust no one . Sneak everywhere and never carry junk. This is pretty much bound to happen of there is more then a few ppl on the server. 
---
I could see an argument for some sort of counter to where you could relinquish your claim but I am sure someone would exploit it in some other way lol
---
During the SBQ fight they do spawn with different weapons. I've seen:
---
* Salvaged Assaultron Heads
---
* Miniguns
---
* .50 Cal
---
* Gamma Guns
---
Gamma Gun Scorched are actually dangerous if you don't have power armor on.
---
I‚Äôve noticed Phoenix (?) wanders off a lot less lately to fight every bot in town. Perhaps he‚Äôs been warned by HR about his extensive coffee breaks? 
---
they show up very rarely
---
I think buddy's point is claiming it in the first place was you opening yourself to PvP.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a future dlc thing. Or in planning event. 
---
Would be cool to go into one as a team and race against the clock to loot as must as you can.  While fighting the ghoul customers. 
---
Or don't use the designated PvP zones.
---
Freedom 76! 
---
The game will run well on medium setting around 50-60 fps. My laptop is an i5 with 1050ti, I get 50-60 fps on medium. 
---
Yeah it's new since the patch.  Bunch of people are posting about it 
---
Fixed it. Turns out it was an outdated version of Baka file tool in my /Data folder
---
I thought about reporting it when it happened to me, but it is a game mechanic.  If Bethesda let us know they just planned to put people reported a lot on the same servers I would have.  
---
Nice! I love playing heavy guns (cal 50 and gatling) with bloodied/crit build. Best thing ever
---
Check if it‚Äôs the base one or the aged one. 
---
Why?  Because immediately after Patch 7, there was a game-wide issue that applied a long wait timer to  'most' people trying to launch nukes.  This was confirmed by BGS as a bug, and they took the servers down again for 2 hours yesterday to apply a fix to the servers.  The issue has now been corrected, and nukes have been launching without issues since yesterday morning.
---
Meh. I've got a TSE 10 mm pistol and still have to put 2 clips into a level 68 mutant.
---
To be fair, I noticed this in the previous patch when they said they "fixed" speed demon initially. 
---
It's interdiction of enemy forces. 
---
My group wants to capture a workshop,  for example, you  simultaneously initiate capture and prevent defense of it from the owner by destroying the owner via ambush. 
---
Not fair at all. 
---
Neither is war. 
---
 (Probably will be changed in the future)
---
I'd help but will probably spawn tougher enemies. I'm level 180 or something.
---
Seriously though I'm happy to help. I have more stims and radaway than I know what to do with.
---
Dear diary,
---
Today I learned that expecting a game world to make sense and not break my immersion is entitlement.
---
I just wish all that stuff would respawn at midnight or whatever. That way you wouldn't have to keep timers of when you went somewhere.   
---
For me, I mostly play after work, so most of my stuff resets between 10-11pm. But that means on my days off, I can't sell ANYTHING for HOURS. 
---
Definitely the quest that had me most invested. Ending was great 
---
I would like sunglasses to actually have a visible effect.
---
You need to really watch how insensitive you are. What would happen if I was ill? Thankfully I'm not, I just have my brother play for me and fyi my private life is of no business to you
---
You don't get xp unless you actually hit them yourself. But you do get to pick through the meat piles, either way, the point is, in the picture he's using the lights that you can find under turrets, and not actual guns/rockets. I didn't catch that at first.
---
Look at this goody two shoes. 
---
Not to be a huge dick, but honestly you can really only sell to them once a day anyway, so why don't you just sell to them at the same time every day, then you'll never have to worry about checking the time.
---
I mean shit bro, you got to dry erase for laying around the house, paper, pen, canvas, paint? Just set an alarm on your phone for the last time you vendored and set it to the next day.
---
Also if you really want to point out that you can vendor to them every 20 hours, why the fuck are you checking in with vendors every 20 hours on a game that is almost dead? Don't get me wrong, I have hundreds of hours on this damn game with multiple characters, but is four hours really really going to kill you? I would imagine most people still playing the game to this day have almost Max cap limit on most of their characters... can't imagine another reason to visit a vendor other than weight and the possible new plan...
---
Yes, HR had to inform Phoenix that he couldn‚Äôt take a smoke break every five minutes.
---
Impressive numbers you are putting into fo76! I am excited to start playing. 
---
No its totally griefing man. You only risk 5 caps, the other player risks their lvl in caps, as well as whatever you decide to destroy for 5 caps a piece. If you got a 5 cap bounty, but also lost your full amount of caps, then It wouldn't be a problem, but that's not how it works.  
---
If you are using a system like bounties, meant to punish players who mess with others, to benefit yourself by reducing the risk you're taking in pvp, that's 100% griefing. 
---
Fallout 76 was not ready for the world. 
---
Nah. There are plenty of vids out showing players how to achieve 2k damage. 
---
Not that‚Äôs what happened to you. People are just fan boying/girl over insane damage. Because what‚Äôs left to do. 
---
Come join my server and I'll craft one for you. GT Kasv0tVaxt.
---
I would be fine with that if anyone who entered my PvP zone was immediately PvP, I just don‚Äôt like what they get to choose when PvP starts.  
---
I find the power plants the only ones really worth taking and i always leave the fusion core generator open.
---
Hoppy Hunter IPA is a beer, so there is no vintage version. I drink a Hoppy Hunter IPA that I crafted and the quest changes from "Drink a Fresh Hoppy Hunter IPA" to "Craft an item". But then I craft lots of different things and that doesn't complete. When the Hoppy Hunter IPA effect wears off, the "Craft an item" goes away and is replaced with "Drink a Fresh Hoppy Hunter IPA". I don't seem to be able to complete the "Craft an item" step no matter what I craft.
---
That is also valid
---
No, once you have a workshop you can be killed instantly anywhere. It really sucks. 
---
no problem, I like having raiders in game, it makes it more imersive
---
Use this map to find a lead node and camp on it. 
---
Fallout can only have music prior to the 1950s.
---
The community for this game is generally pretty good. I‚Äôve only had one bad experience with another player and I‚Äôve put plenty of hours into the game. I sometimes leave some stimpaks in the overseer stash in the Flatwoods church too. 
---
I would love it if I could drop my own mp3 files into a folder and be able to play them through my Pipboy. 
---
I‚Äôd see if you can forget the quest and start a new one. 
---
If you can't tell the difference between an actual defend and being 1 shot killed multiple times then come on dude. I'd be totally fine if I could defend, but it's ALWAYS super high level characters that can 1 shot me. That's not defend-able. You just die over and over until you leave the server. 
---
LMG is much better now but still goes through ammo super fast despite the lower fire rate. Consider Lock &amp; Load perk if you expect to be in the middle of a big fight (like SBQ).
---
Only a few are truly dicks. The rest of are nice as hell. ;o)
---
I'll give 250. Let's do this!
---
Again, you're holding a place that *passively gives you important or rare resources.* You initiated pvp with anyone who wants to fight with you the moment you captured it.
---
Take a lap or two around Watoga. Most of the bots drop lead scrap. 
---
needs more old crow medicine show and George straight tbh
---
This, I spent four days server hopping back in the day to get mine. Not sure if they changed the rng, but it‚Äôs better to just buy one from the market.
---
Is this a tie-in or is it a local thing?
---
Nah I knew that I was talking about the one shot part, I've been part of the 20 minute power armor fights which are extremely unfun for their own reasons (it was amusing the first couple times) but I could at least give up and walk away ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Agreed they should lose their own level in caps + bounty. It would be more incentive for bounty hunting. üëç 
---
Exactly so I should be able to shoot anyone that walks in and not have to wait for them to initiate PvP 
---
I‚Äôd definitely jump in on it! The problem I‚Äôve had is some of the true griefers (not legit PVP players) will intentionally run with very few caps on them so they don‚Äôt lose big if/when they die. There would need to be a system in place to deal with that. Maybe some sort of debt mechanism? Caps are automatically paid towards the debt as they are received from quest reward and sales? I don‚Äôt know, but I do like the idea of a server wide bad guy to fight. 
---
Yeah I've still never had anything spawn inside my house.   Might have to do with C.A.M.P location?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, according to my wife this happens to most men, eh, robots.
---
Might be coming up on the home strech. Anyone else have any Chainsaw Flamers?
---
It's a two shot explosive at low health with adrenaline fully active it's around 700 per shot
---
Reject isn't an option for this quest. I relogged and now cannot get a new one. I'll try tomorrow, but I've heard other that had this daily bug out in other ways and then are never able to get another one, even days later. :(
---
Yeah.
---
The easiest way to test is to put a bottle of something into the fermenter and then highlight it. IF it'll ferment into "vintage" booze there will be a  CND bar that acts as a timer. If not, there won't be a bar.
---
I'll try that hope it works.
---
:::raises hand:::
---
I saw him at New Gad yesterday. 
---
I'm calling BS on this one, as the only reference to a "Vault 65" is in a fanfiction wiki for Fallout, and it's not even located in WV. It's in Vermont.  
---
 [https://falloutfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Vault\_65](https://falloutfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_65)   
---
So unless they are going to screw with Canon again, this is highly doubtful.
---
Should be getting their level # in caps / your team mates per kill unless they're bankrupt. Bounty only rewards the bounty value, so its usually less, actually. 
---
Yes. I killed most today from range but one surprised me up close and then at low health exploded killing me.
---
I think the locker is where the stuff is kept and yes the terminals for the transaction.
---
Guns and armor can very by level intervals, some are five, fifteen up to forty five, others are tens. Upto fifty.
---
Ok thanks I'm gonna go check it out. Thanks
---
Use spotify. 
---
Think about it. This is the wasteland and you should assume everyone is your enemy unless their your friend. If your having a problem team up with higher lvl players who like PVP. I take work shops sometimes and wait just hoping someone will try to take it. 
---
Yup, that happened to me too when some of my mods was not up to date. 
---
I'm not selling them. I'm giving them away. 1 free to each who needs one. Once they are gone, that's it.
---
It‚Äôs 50-50. Some pop on the spot others just lay there. 
---
For me that would 100% make it a lot more balanced. I don't actually have a problem with pvp in general, I just want people to have the same risk vs reward.
---
OOONNNEEE PUUNNNCCCCCCCHHHHHHH
---
I'll do the same on Xbox
---
Sorry. That's what worked for me. Those are so buggy.
---
Just do what you can. Hopefully a fix is on the way. 
---
So much easier to spot now. 
---
I've had this problem for quite some time.
---
Yaa just found that out...if its a part of the game... I guess I'll start lollll
---
Voice activated!
---
I had a 4* serrated (modded) Vampire dagger I gave to a buddy, it definitely exists. I have yet to come across another one after 700+ hours of gameplay tho.
---
Future content?
---
Million and one now, üòâ
---
So you can accidentally scrap a hunters long coat.. duh
---
i knew about it but i agree to the second part, there is a huge difference between contesting the workshop, and hunting down other players "for the lulz"
---
Volunteering to do the same on PSN, just provide mats. PSN: Skizzunky
---
It might be a pain to get mods for, but I love this armor. Definitely an updated T-51 in the same way they updated the T-45 with the T-60. I'm a fan for sure. 
---
Not the door wih the space suit inside, there is a wrecked section of station near there with another door inside.
---
Would be awesome and some hank Williams sr as well 
---
Is it possible that you're thinking of the machete with the four stars?
---
This dagger isn't legendary and it has no star.
---
I completely agree. There are still a few kinks to work out such as what you mentioned as well as the workshop/stalk exploit. I think pvp would be a lot more fair if these two problems were addressed soon. 
---
You're ignoring my point. If I can be 1 shot killed, there isn't a "defend" that is possible. I'd be all for shooting it out with people to contest a workshop. But if a level 300 whatever decides he wants it, he's just going to take it. It has nothing to do with liking or not liking PvP. It's literally IMPOSSIBLE to actually fight it. You either die, as stated, or leave.   
---
If you get off on dying in one shot, that's great for you, but most people just get frustrated when there's no way to actually have fair battles with other players. 
---
Actual balanced PvP would be fine. This totally one-sided thing is not.   
---
Which terminal
---
My brother and I both got Adrenal Reaction recipe from the SBQ in the same fight.  Killed her a few times since then but haven't seen anything. 
---
OK so it isn't just me then! I rock a TSE double barrel and noticed reloads have been absolute crap since the last update. Time to invest another point in Quick Hands I guess...
---
Would also be awesome if they added a blues station with Artists like Muddy Waters and BB King
---
That‚Äôs pretty awesome ü§©
---
Hey, I've been hoping to find someone to do some good old fashion raiding with, especially once the the new survival mode drops. I'm on PC too, so feel free to DM your ign, I'd love to team up!
---
Yes it was shown in the trailer https://youtu.be/CIZ-LGaRB6M
---
Not sure what platform you're on but social menu has been giving me some trouble since the last patch. The only solution has been to fully restart my PS4.
---
Im a rifles guy myself, I like the spears and axes too. 
---
And my axe!
---
That just gives you a massive advantage against people, with no recourse for them. Your holding something that gives you a ton of resources for free.   
---
Its as if you have shot everyone on the server, and its their choice, not yours, if they want to fight you.  If it worked the way you're saying, attacking workshops would be way slanted in the defenders favor, and break the global defend workshop events by allowing the workshop owner to just kill anyone who comes to help.   
---
There's a reason bethesda has things the way they are, You don't get to have the munitions factory and have first shot on any player who just comes near. Your taking a risk by taking the workshop, opening yourself to pvp, and your reward is all the resources that you get. The way you describe would limit your risk while giving attacking players even more for less reward. 
---
I did all of it myself and the plans weren't there.  I've been server hopping trying to get it since.
---
Starting to feel like old vendor hopping
---
We don't need 50 people repeating this same thing.
---
Open map - left bumper - down on D pad (8 options down) - press A - press A - down on D pad  (3 options down) - right or left on D pad - press B - press B - press B - press B 
---
Dude, it just works, no need for a quick button. 
---
That is a local thing. https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/36015/141071/
---
Hehe, nice. 
---
Sorry I may have missed something but you can absolutely run wires however you want. Somebody here mentioned about storing walls, egg and yeah that works. But there's other ways and you can make them all look tidy too.
---
I don't think the tile sets are identical between PC and PS4.
---
I've added a video of my problem in the main post. It either comes up long or short when spanning the room on a PS4.
---
And it's _soooo_ much more painful without a mouse.
---
Lol same but I heard there‚Äôs bags of cement around Poseidon power plant but if you get anything else could you tell me where 
---
Check out the video I added to the original post.
---
I don't see where I could do anything different.
---
I had that problem with testing my luck (drink a beer and score a critical hit), getting kicked from the server and reloading fixed it. So maybe relog?
---
Cool. Now where can I find the crafting recipe? I'm thinking 3 razorgrain, 3 boiled water, 3 corn, one snaptail reed and a torn Mothman wing.
---
My door is on the accessible part of the house the other side is hanging off a cliff so they break the wall or they unlock the door they are gonna have a turret waiting for them. Believe it or not my door system actually works.
---
Try the top of the monorail elevator there's several sacks of cement there
---
So much yes. This is the topic of the week and should be addressed ASAP. This most certainly is griefing and quite frustrating to boot. Especially when you are halfway across the map and some dude one shot you in the back with no warning at all. This is a completely unfair and broken mechanic. I'm all for pvp, but only if you accept pvp. Yea if you had a workshop you agree to pvp, I get it- but it should be limited to the workshop area only. 
---
Praise RNGeesus
---
But does it ask you to do it everytime you place it in the same spot and relog?
---
Check most of the mines. Always a bag or 7 around. 
---
Now hopefully they made all the flash fern in the sbq area actually harvestable that would be a great improvement!
---
Try the Fallout reddit Marketplace?
---
Acting like you can simply walk into the Enclave and pick one up hahahahahhahahaha.
---
I want some cannibal recipes.  Dine and dash would be really useful for this game, would love to make some strange meat pie again.
---
Workshops are not your personal camp, they are PvP Zones. You initiate pvp the second you take one, and your reward for that risk is getting resources *for free.*
---
No idea why people get so bent out of shape about this. Without pvp, taking workshops has literally no risk, for way too much reward. That's why the cheese strategy of blocking workshops was patched out, because they are powerful points that need to be contestable to be balanced.
---
Likely was a machete. I have 4* myself. 
---
Nice!  I love black IPA‚Äôs 
---
I am slowly building some Spotify-based Fallout playlist ‚Äúradio stations‚Äù
---
Here‚Äôs my usual go to:
---
‚ÄúReclaimation Day Radio‚Äù
---
https://open.spotify.com/user/hobbesdream/playlist/1VE2ZbMClKzoCDTeTWWrXQ?si=PVAto7amR5efJCG6oAZQ3Q
---
Basically songs that I think have that optimism and can do spirit of ‚Äúreclaimation.‚Äù Also stuff about houses/house building.
---
Generally fairly optimistic, and it‚Äôs got about 800 songs on it so far.
---
Also if you are having issues with greifers try out the homebody and happy camper perks they are a big help in dealing with them. If you are being greifed by an invincible person wearing sentinel armor or some one who's just massively higher level then you, open up the social menu block said person and change servers. 
---
Read the whole post lol
---
Bloody griefing players. Poor NPC was having their one morning off in a week and they ruin it.
---
Maybe, but that slap thing ain't gonna fly. What if you're in the middle of PVP with someone else? 
---
Hmm maybe. I could have sworn it was a dagger, it was like the blade in Fallout 4. I'll have to ask him.
---
Itll just remove it again, some areas are marked as future content but arent no build zones
---
A lot of people leave the heavier barbells because they don‚Äôt want to be over encumbered. Keep in mind there is a bench around the corner and you can scrap it all.
---
Agreed, I made a pretty awesome playlist for playing Fallout specifically. Plenty of Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline on there.
---
While we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs add Liberty Prime and the Transformers because I like things that are cool and don‚Äôt fit into the game!
---
expecting and crying are two diff things.  put that in your diary, cupcake.
---
That's how I got all of my x01 mods, dumped a ton of caps with that vendor
---
Down to the explosive zealots handmade

Right on the fusion core
---
Just going out on a limb here, do you happen to be in a PS party chat? Sometimes this happens to me and I don't realize it for freaking ever. 
---
Seriously, or a traveling leather coat or a BoS jumpsuit. Something that is super rare and impossible to get back (especially on PC)
---
The keypad on the wall with the powered door works for me. Idk about the pylon keypad though. 
---
Yeah they should
---
I love fo76 but this makes me gloss over so many documents when I really do want to dive more into the lore. It's so difficult to read anything scrawled on crumpled paper on a 65 inch TV. I'm guessing it's easier up close on a pc monitor but the lack of plain text is just amazingly shortsighted for a game that relies so heavily on holos and notes. 
---
I would be fine with a loop of country roads 
---
Honestly 
---
I would pay for that 
---
Focus on the end of the apparel name.
---
Only scrap legs arms and chest pieces.
---
TELL IT TO ME 
---
TELL IT TO ME
---
That's my guess as well, but I haven't test it yet - have you tested it?
---
Got one last night 
---
I've tried it with game chat prioritized and not in a party, area chat rarely if ever works for me anymore.
---
Not personally but ive seen a lot of people post about this exact thing. If you want to  check just place it back and dont build anything, then server hop incase. If it stays you could rebuild, if it doesnt stay then youll know for sure
---
"LET ME GRIEF YOU SO I CAN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME PLAYING THIS GAME, DAMN IT" - stupid ass OP
---
Yes, and if they are PVP zones, only they should be PVP zones. You have to invest time and effort into defending your workshop, not leave it alone with locks and turrets. In fact, this encourages PVP, because now the owner has a reason to stay and fight instead of leaving the place alone to churn out whatever resources it does. Either they defend that workshop, or they leave and someone else takes it over instantly. It shouldn't allow an aggressor to repeatedly attack the owner when the both of them are halfway across the map and nowhere near the PVP zone.
---
Bear in mind I'm not advising making workshops PVP free, only that the potential for griefers to abuse the system be lessened. And they're not free, you have to spend caps to take them, as well as invest materials into defenses for some of them if their personal pools aren't enough.
---
People are getting bent out of shape because between losing up to as much as 120 caps per death and getting repeatedly killed by fully specced PVPers when you just wanted some acid, 2000 miles away from the actual PVP zone, sucks. That's all there is to it.
---
Sure np. I‚Äôm on now, so I‚Äôll add you :). See you in a few
---
I've been on multiple servers this week without a single claimed workshop on it. I server hoped multiple times for a vendor and noticed maybe 1 or 2 (by level 10s or so), the other vast majority are now unclaimed. What's the point if no one uses them anymore? If I claim, I IMMEDIATELY server hop/quit. Just ... yea.
---
I love the music in this event, i want a jukebox with that song and the songs from the atomic shop. Chill elevator music!
---
In a shed in the grounds of the church near the Nuka Cola factory. There is at least 5 bags.

Someone once posted here that their game glitched and the companion commands from Fallout 4 became active on a team mate.

Don't tell me that you haven't visited Super Duper Mart, where you will find amazing deals on the finest foods, the future of grocery stores, the best place for Super Duper deals!

Harpers ferry at chembench if not looted 4 bags.
---
actually let beth publish a map with non build areas highlighted aht we can toggle in game so that we can see what areas are unbuildable
---
Conduit, not wires.
---
That requires like half of the budget if you want all crop tyoes.
---
Heh, there was one a while back to take a photomode pic naked except for hat / helmet. I got a mental image of someone at Bethesda harvesting all the saved photos for, uh, ‚Äúresearch purposes‚Äù...

I had at the billboard above blackwater mine, said something about having to move it

I almost scrapped my leather coat üò§
---
I 2nd this

That happened to me in the brief time I had a brahmin pen. I assumed it was my plague walker mutation, but I could be mistaken.
---
do you have mutations? 
---
My gt is ‚Äúget sneezed on‚Äù send me a message and we will play later I just started 2 days ago. would love a friend who is low level to play with 
---
also look at your traps/defences tab when building... some look verry raiderish.. as to actuall spikes with skulls havent seen any yet. whis ya luck
---
The Enclave is the only way to get X-01 mods. However, it's not as easy as just walking in there. You have to server hop, a LOT, and hope the RNG gods favor you. It's not like all the mods are available at once.  If you're lucky enough to get an extra jetpack/calibrated shock, you sell that puppy on Reddit. 
---
That's a fair point. Given that the slap damage system can determine individual relationships and states between players (white, yellow, red, etc), the best option would be to only reset said slap damage mechanic between the aggressor's fireteam and the owner. It wouldn't affect anyone else, since you have to be in the same fireteam for PVP to proc when claiming workshops, so this should work without affecting the current owner if they're in PVP with someone else.
---
Yes. If my mutations are damaging my own brain this is a bug that needs to be addressed. 
---
People be acting like you kicked their dog if you break a wall. Overwrought sob stories over a little wood and steel. 
---
Nice! Thank you! Offer stands of you find another!
---
The potential loss to gain ratio is a bit too low at the moment.
---
I really would love to see them add the ultracite jet pack to the game.
---
do you have plague walker? i can see that one causing damage with the poison aura
---
Of for sure. They should all have it. Plus the design potential is huge for the ultracite version.
---
If plague not bug
---
RNG gods must love me, got the jetpack, shocks, etc. Also grabbed the Nuka quantum paint on the first try, found the lemonade vendor first random spawn spot I looked. The randomness favors me heavily it seems.
---
Exactly! It‚Äôs a wasteland man, lego world is over there? Aha
---
You can get 1400 a day selling to the vendors. Then you can make a bunch doing events.
---
It does thank you!!! :)
---
It's ok to share, spoilers though shouldn't be in the title, so people that care about discovering them, they still can.
---
Eventually you run out of stuff to buy. Endgame players can get 1400 a day by selling to robot vendors - best thing to do after that is have valuable things to sell on trading forums. Legendaries, mutation serums, rare plans, and so on. 
---
The wasteland needs Johnny cash!!!  I can hear Casey Jones playing as I lumber down  a Iong ago abandoned  railroad track in my trusty x-01.
---
You got a jetpack and both shocks in one go? Go back in there, get them for everyone else, share the wealth. 
---
Agreed. Something broke when the fixed legendary drops. I wish I knew how to data mine to see if a variable changed. 
---
Patsy cline has fantastic lyrics for wondering a wasteland.
---
I go out waalkin, after midnight
---
Out in the moonlight...
---
While i sneak through the mire. 
---
"I was a Highwayman" please I love this song.
---
More Megadeth
---
Thanks, yeah, I eventually logged on and found that out myself as well.
---
It‚Äôs also possible to sell items you find to other players. 
---
Yup I sell easily 1400 caps everyday..just collect junk and bulk it hell you can do wood easy..get woodchuck and you can get like 300 wood each run through the lumber mill
---
It's not the coolest, or most creative, but I sure as fuck do love it. This is right across the road from Morgantown Station (in back of the Airport), and has basically all passersby might need: all crafting stations, purified water, a water pump (it's not a stream, so it's slow, but what can you do), instruments, a bed, and some razorgrain/corn out back for brewing. There's a small patch of vegetation closer to the tarmac, as well, that has tatos and other things. I have plans for a decontamination shower, but until pacifist mode makes CAMPs safe, my paranoia will win out.

---
It's always a scary feeling. I'm about to get a back up for mine.
---
Mostly events. And for me, having a brother that doesn't care about CAMP plans, so he's always got way more money and when he hits his max he gives me some lol. 
---
As well as the headlamps, the arm mods that I forget what they're called. I want to say I blew through 3000-4000 caps on mods that trip.
---
Sorry but in another room, another woke and attacked but didn't get it on video.  
---
So i thought i'd grab the next one. 
---
Unless all were different????
---
I love how you turned someone not letting you in their camp into making them a horrible person just because they don‚Äôt want to do what you think they should do. Get over it, stash boxes and crafting benches are super abundant in this game, you‚Äôll live walking an extra 100 meters for it.
---
Just because you want someone to do something and they don‚Äôt, doesn‚Äôt make them a selfish asshole you moron, it makes them a normal ass person doing wtf they want to do and it just makes you a baby back bitch for whining that they don‚Äôt.
---
Behold our new hero (‚óî_‚óî)
---
Yep. Totally agree. I don't want to play a drunk character and the game has pretty much shut me out from doing dailies/weeklies. 
---
I would have much preferred these as just regular content challenges or maybe only taking up at most a slot or 2 to still lead completionists by the nose but leave the rest of us alone to not feel like these next few weeks are just a bust in terms of earning atoms.
---
I have like 80 hours give or take, and I‚Äôm still enjoying it 
---
Sorry, I was off for a little while, getting back on now, I'll message you, I have two T60 suits, so was looking to get one painted knight &amp; one Paladin if you can, I've gotta go scrounge up materials though, got disconnected while trying to get back to my bag of loot, so lost a lot of scrap!
---
Yeah, that's the way to make it look nice. Have a conduit on both sides of the wall. Looks nice and neat.
---
I have no diseases and even if I did it shouldn't be affecting my own brahmin.
---
Maybe there was a glitch and it had every mod at once, lol. That's never happened to me at all. Most people, if you read the forum, are on the same boat I am. I've luckily gotten my jetpack and shocks, but it took quite a bit of server hopping. You can even get 5000 caps on the marketplace if you have spares. I found an extra jetpack and sold it for 4000 caps. 
---
I contend that it's one of the best quest lines that BGS has ever done. Not sure if it tops the epic Dark Brotherhood quest that most people laud but it's certainly up there.
---
Just finished testing, the CAMP stayed at the exact same spot even after relog.
---
Plague walker is a mutation, not a disease. 
---
I think either Johnny Darrell's or Porter Wagoner's version of  "Green Green Grass of Home" would be a nice addition 
---
I misunderstood that challenge completely. Apologies to the Bethesda employee that opened the email with me in my birthday suit and a horse mask.
---
A huge missed opportunity was "Salt Pork, West Virginia" by Louise Jordan and the Tymphany Five

---
It says right on it it harms friendlies, too. 
---
This is partly the mod's responsibility too but the mods are really hands off regarding issues like this when they shouldn't be.
---
Mine was on the edge of some rocks taking tiny falling damage rapidly until dead... moved off rocks and was fine
---
I grab random junk &amp; outfits I don't need &amp; sell to vendors. I tried cap farming mutants, slow af getting a good amount of caps imo
---
It wasn't an instant discovery.  Even the data miners had to spend time looking for things.  Granted it was a lot faster when you knew what location to look but after that you still had to look under every object. 
---
This is nice and all but doesn't fit into the lore or style of the Fallout world. Unfortunately, suggestion destroyed.
---
yes honestly sad the ghost riders song isnt Cash 
---
Why? It‚Äôs a consumable .
---
Don‚Äôt you remember the Nuka Dark Rum scam??
---
Lead Champagne Bellini- fall faster (?!)
---
I'm looking at it.... it doesn't say that. And it's only supposed to happen if I have a disease.l, which I dont.
---
Just finished testing, it appears that 2nd time's indeed charm in my case - CAMP stayed at the exact same spot after rebuild &amp; relog. (Gonna try blueprint next.)
---
There are 3 bags I know of, 2 on the left and 1 back on the right at the back catwalks
---
I agree with you. Getting tired of gearing the same songs that was in the last two games.
---
I'm going shopping then to see if I get them all again.
---
Yes, but plague Walker is only supposed to deal damage scaling with you disease. I have no disease and therefore it shouldn't even be active at all.
---
They patched both of those. The firepit and the rug glitches. I was so sad that i couldn't my windmill back on my roof using the firepit glitch. It looked so good with both of them in place. ;o)
---
Those feels when criticizing a corporation for lacking basically competence is crying. Do the boots taste good?
---
Nah. He's on solid ground and only takes damage once I get close to him.
---
13 Bags at the Bog Workshop, 4-5 bags at the cemetery near the nuke cola plant, 4 bags not the west bridge neat Flatwoods, all garden gnomes found at Flatwoods in green houses, vendors and anywhere else
---
I have a buddy who crafts a bunch of marine tactical helmets every day and with a maxed out hard bargain he makes like 26 caps each, and they‚Äôre super cheap to make apparently, he gave me a few to sell and I cleaned out like 4 vendors
---
What level are you may I ask?
---
Ok fam just finishing up school and when I get home I search up your name my username is ‚ÄúItsMajoraMask‚Äù
---
This right here. What's the gain from taking them?  A couple plans you might not have and some junk which is literally everywhere.  That's not worth having to worry that someone might claim it and then have a teammate immediately kill you with zero warning.  
---
On a side note, nobody ever seems to do hunter vs hunted.  I stayed on it for 4 hours the other day and nada.  If you guys want pvp that bad get on the radio already! :)
---
And this is what encourages full-priced (at launch) AAA titles to include microtransactions in their game. 
---
It's fine if you want to support a company and its games but this just rewards them for using toxic monetisation practices when they're already earning money from selling the base game. 
---
Free to play games like Fortnite do perfectly fine without the need to also charge full price upfront. BGS could have done the same. We shouldn't reward them for double-dipping.
---
&gt;only have the one handmade left, but sure, come and get it
---
Dense mod, now it does 0 dmg. See how easy learning game mechanics can make things for you and everyone else who won‚Äôt have to read your stupid post?
---
It wasn't really a scam, it was never advertised as completely Glass in the first place
---
Hell if youre strong enough to hold your own in and around harpersferry, just go in and take out every enemy you see. Loot all of the weapons you can. Then sell them to the vendor there. When I do my vendor run I never need to prepare for this sale. 
---
Nope all my weapons.  And all go down very suddenly .  No buffs or mutations involved :( 
---
Put in a door piece, then conduits either side of opening, connect with wire and then change door pce out for solid, kapeesh 
---
Top right
---
That‚Äôs always been a part of the fallout charm for me. No real music has been made since the bombs have been dropped let alone distributed. Listening to the same few songs on repeat imo adds to the dreary monotony of wandering the wastes. And I like that. 
---
Great  so i can probably forget about getting help :(
---
Because the minigun is still leashed to the super mutant it likely came from, and even on that body it still has to roll for chance to drop.
---
When an enemy picks up a loose gun from the environment, it's sort of a paper copy. 
---
Scorched half naked holding a minigun with 1 hand isn't how they spawn.
---
Would love to see a scorch heavy that did lug around real firepower.
---
Still waiting for a scorched stuck in some power armor or something, that'd be sick. Maybe a dilapidated Excavator armored Mole Miner?
---
I use Spotify in the background on my PS4 to do just this. But this would be amazing so my music doesn‚Äôt play while I‚Äôm on mic üòÇ more stations pls ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Eh I‚Äôd rather it be data mined than players spending months trying to figure out a key pin for a random plan 
---
I believe there is an ini file in c/users/user/documents/my games (not sure if that is exactly right, but hopefully close) did you delete those too? 
---
I make Civil War Era Top Hats for one cloth and sell for 35 caps and troll around all the vendors. 
---
Glad you enjoyed my version and recipe of nukashine 
---
Whitsprings under the steps of the cotteges closest to the clubhouse. 
---
It‚Äôs good but you really have to have suspension of disbelief for the last one. If it‚Äôs been THAT long since they died together then the bodies should be way more decayed than they were 
---
they are okay if you also invest in crits but will always be worse then every other build, big issue is you cant get legendary pipe revolvers 
---
There‚Äôs always the metal helmet. The only gear you scrap and learn. Kinda useless 
---
OK, there isn't even a custom ini.
---
Well as I have already stated, I dont really play any more.
---
He stated something about Nuka Quantum Paint, and I figured that had to be something to do with why my friend wanted Nuka Quantum.
---
But holy hell, people down voting this into Oblivion... if only oblivion here was a good thing like when we talk about Bethesda in Oblivion days.
---
Without seeing your situation and I can‚Äôt say for sure if this is a solution, but it did solve a similar problem for me. Instead of trying to attach the wire to the power connector on the other side of the wall, try selecting the conduit itself and attaching the wire in the opposite direction.
---
In my case I was unable to attach a wire in one direction to the through the wall power connector. It only worked when I went the other direction by selecting the conduit on the inside of the wall and then attaching the wire in the other direction to, in my case, the fusion generator. Hope that helps. 
---
Funny thing about that crashed plane. I was wandering through the forest down by whitesprings and happen across a supply drop. Ok, I so I drop the scorched in the area and check it. Nothing interesting, but one of the scorched has a holo tape on him. Which I find weird. Play the tape and it talks about the downed plane. I then get a notification of it being added to my map. So I‚Äôm wondering if this is the trigger to allow you to complete the whole quest line. And if you didn‚Äôt get the trigger that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing the glitches cause you jump into it mid way. 
---
Curious to know how people would find then without knowing what server your on.
---
i had the same issue with the sneak attack one from drinking vodka. all you have to do if it doesnt work is wait for the drug to wear off then server hop and try again by drinking again. just keep trying that till it works
---
Sort of.... You just can't trigger or get to any of it yet
---
What if you had a suit of mis matched amour? How would that work?
---
No.  They're trickling new content out weekly instead of dumping it all at once.  The roadmap shows the dates each thing drops
---
Yes, i will give a shot thanks
---
Daily vendor runs with 2 characters. But mostly from PvP.
---
Love all the local beers around the country. Best ipa I've had is this stuff they sell in Grand Rapids, MI they call dirty bastard. Wouldn't mind trying that one.
---
I feel like they replaced a lot of rhododendrons with firecracker berries. I hardly ever saw them, especially in the forest and now they are everywhere and they glow. Freaked me out the first time I saw them during a particularly dark night. Thought I was surrounded by mothmen. 
---
Or platform, but it‚Äôs a kind gesture, thanks!
---
Thanks 
---
I agree with the TLDR in general but now I lost track of what we're supposed to be arguing about 
---
I may be wrong but I thought it was 4 hours.
---
Use a doorway.
---
Put connection on it towards the top
---
Go through the doorway and then turn it into a solid wall.
---
Put connection where door is supposed to go Other side than the top of doorway.
---
Turn back to doorway and connect wired.
---
Or you run the wires next to the corners where was connect.
---
YouTube has a few good videos on it.
---
My LG plasma has this issue with the Xbox version too and cuts everything off on the screen edges.
---
Also when ever you see cloth money or anti freeze pick it up till you have around 200- 300 of cloth and acid you will be set on gun powder then.pick up any thing with plastic you see while your playing. Find around 2-3 lead spawns like weight rooms, Loot and scrap them once a day. Use ammo smith and super duper. Then make shot gun shells once you have 3 to 5k shells you can sell them to another player for .75 caps each. Its something very simple you can do extra that will make you around an extra 5k each week for only around 10 min per day.
---
Glad you saw this! Hooray community 
---
It's plague walker. Even without disease animals run from you. Like the dog up on the cliff by harpers ferry, he'll jump off the cliff if you get close =|
---
Spread the word! Please add this feature Bethesda, I‚Äôm begging you.
---
yeah, seems more / most of this brewing events are broken for most people, we have a thread over at the Bethesda forum about the critical hit event, same thing there, work for a very few, but dose not work for most.. :/   if somone that know how to tag someone from Bethesda in here, please do, so they know..
---
I'm not sure but even if you could attach a number to each one it would help
---
i just started to watch your pain ;-) and i got one tip already.
---
when you try to add a conduit at the top then remove the roof. if you want to add the conduit to the bottom then add the roof. this will make snaping alot better.
---
dont ask why. "it just works ..."
---
When I tried to back the conduit passthrough away from the wall it went all the way back in.
---
Something is just fishy or something. I may try again with an empty cube room to see if I can get different results. /sigh
---
It's just _so_ painful with a d-shock on a console.
---
I want a pipboy version of Untappd to check in the beers I try
---
That needs to be fixed 
---
There's a perk card for that.
---
Or Spotify! Some solid 76 themed playlists on there. 
---
yeah, that works, but you use a lot of lead on them to get some lead, lol
---
Thanks, I'll have you check that out.
---
Where do you get the plan?
---
In Morgantown, the same shop where the robot comes out of for the ‚Äúback on the beat‚Äù quest, is a robot repair shop. Has about 3 boxes of screws/gears plus scrap metal/lead and copper. I farmed the shit outta that place server hopping to build the excavator armor. You may also have to hop, but it‚Äôs worth it. Also, sugar grove. You‚Äôre welcome. 
---
xD exactly
---
I can't help you, it does what it does. It also makes you tagged for PvP at all times, so instead of getting slap damage you can just be 1 shot killed. I had it for a while, and when I realized those negatives I stopped using it. 
---
Mabey renaming could be a thing :o profanity filters are a thing so it would be fine :)
---
Depends on build. Just craft a rifle with a hush tube and get a sneak attacks in. Then track down the bodies. 
---
It doesn't make any sense as a competitive PvP mechanic though. If you need the resources, XP and low-level camp plans from workshops, you're not going to be equipped for PvP. Hence workshop PvPers rarely bother taking the workshop after getting the kill. They just server hop for their next victim.
---
Speed demon is broke. After they "fixed it" class freak no longer reduces the negative effects either it now drains foid and drink super fast as well.
---
I'll have to try harder on that, I tried to select the through wall conduit on the outside but I only could select the wall. That horizontal conduit is what says its floating. I was able to attach a conduit and run wires on the inside of it. I didn't have much time so I'll have to play around more. 
---
I've been thinking about the power substation right by the whitespring train station. Large focal point most everyone sees when doing vendor routes at the station and the bunker. Deck out the exterior with flashy lighting and everyone who fast travels by will notice it.
---
You do get "extra" power from the substation box on site if you power up the power plant, going from a base of 10 to 100. In my experience though, it's frustrating building anything that depends on the 90 extra power coming out. 
---
The main drawback is going to be the enemy spawns. This CAN be managed pretty easily though. After logging in and out at the substation a few times, you'll learn exactly where and what enemies like to spawn in the area. Set locations like substations are more predictable with spawns. You can then just set up low budget death traps and never worry about them again.
---
You can get pretty creative with your structures at the substations. Give it a shot sometime maybe. 
---
Sorry I can't remember where I got it. Another idea is to collect the golf outfits at Whitesprings golf club.
---
227, been playing since beta
---
https://youtu.be/K_9tX4eHztY
---
Below lumber yard top left of map. Gotta hop servers...... a lot.  But you can get all the civil war plans and trapper plans there too
---
Check for gnomes. Huntersville has a creepy collection of them.
---
Go to the bazaar or market subreddits.  Buy the cheapest set of 1* unyielding armor, and the cheapest bloodied weapon (preferably melee, preferably swingspeed).   Buy an adrenal reaction serum. The grab nerd rage perk. Class freak 3, starched genes 2.  
---
Wooooo Grand Rapids!!!
---
I don't exactly know, but I've heard it over and over that it is the best with dense. You can also take notice how valuable 3 star marine armor gets compared to the rest.
---
Personally I play the game solo, with a good focus on exploring and terminal reading. The content of these terminals is the best in a fallout game yet, IMO. But you are right that the general flow of the game is a bit more rough due to the online nature. 
---
There is no ‚Äúeasy‚Äù mode though. This game definitely demands you to manage things a bit more than other games. Luckily, I enjoy that micromanaging just as much as the exploring. 
---
and my second observation watching your video. your first passthrough is way to deep in the wall. after you placed your first passthrough, turn outside of your building and watch the outside. about half of the rubber should be visible on the outside.
---
Also if you consume the Whisky then someone else hogs the vendor long enough you have to rinse and repeat.
---
This almost happened to me on the second try.
---
I noticed that. One of the reasons I was wondering. I find a lot of three star marine armor, which is the other reason. Ive been saving it but I'm not sure why. 
---
It already has it.  Find a lake with mirelurks in it.  Toss grenades :)
---
Actual fishing would be kind of fun though.
---
Don't need crits, just stealth boosts. 
---
I can 1 shot level 68 super mutants with my muffled .45 pipe revolver - it's not even legendary.
---
Hmmm... Maybe it's a display error or possible corrupted file? Try a database rebuild after shutting down your ps4 for 10 minutes. Your problem sounds unique and frustrating. 
---
How quickly can I do this and, will it make my character some sort of sponge or tank? I never thought of purposely seeking out vendors over the internet. This is an interesting concept
---
Eat food, drink water. Water down your rad away and stimpacks at a chem station. Get the perk cards for helping reduce rads when eating and drinking.  Stay in low level areas. Do low level events, eg Fertile Soil. Make or find armor.  If you can't find chems in the server you're on, hop servers. There's a decent amount in and around Flatwoods, so you shouldn't be running out. Learn how to make healing salves, if you haven't already. You can just make them from the stuff around Flatwoods. If you're having a hard time with specific things, lemme know and I'll try to advise. 
---
 I'm much slower at leveling than other people who have my hours played, but I also prefer the solo exploration of Fallout games. I solo explore 90% of the time. Sometimes I group with my brother, but most of the time I'm climbing through wrecked buildings alone.
---
What console are you on? I might have some plans laying around you could use. 
---
That‚Äôs part of the fun! 
---
One the ones down on the left as you enter the Military Wing. There are only 2 working in the rows of desks.
---
Ah the wall piece ok..I'll try it
---
When I first started 76 I was dissapointed too. I've always played games to escape and 76 felt like a chore at first. However, you've got to give to get back with this game. I didn't understand why I was always so low on ammo or had crappy weapons / aid - I had to go, do the challenges, story missions, events etc in order to be rewarded with better tier items. 
---
My advice is to do as much as possible until you get to a point where you can comfortably walk around and not be two hits away from a fatal blow at any point! 
---
GL x
---
^^^^ common sense really 
---
What doesn't cost a bunch to buy the rights tho? That's part of it. 
---
I've had it for months. I definitely still take slap damage. 
---
I used to think so but today drove me crazy I had 4 different people trying to attack me in the whitespring 
---
I thought how unlucky can I be to come across so many children at the same time
---
Of course I'm not going to PvP when I'm fixing my equipment and sorting out my junk üò§
---
Nothing is up with it
---
Yeah I scored about 10 critical hits in a row after drinking my fresh rum, and it wouldn't register it at all so I can't complete the quest.
---
There are set places where random event happen. Learn where 5-6 of them are, and check them all out. If you don‚Äôt find the plan, hop to a new server and recheck the spots.
---
It took me about an hour last night, but I found the plans for the top hat.
---
I'm an explorer too and tbh I can also consider myself a filthy casual lol.
---
A few essential perks maxed would greatly help you
---
Pharma farma (luck) : I never seem to run out of any chems with this, exploring I find first aid boxes everywhere and most often when I click search it has extra med stuff
---
Super duper(luck) : if you can manage to find the plan for stimpacks,radaway etc.. this perk can when making the item make an extra one for free. Also works with any other thing you make 
---
That one in Watoga is pretty nice but it‚Äôs too small. A large one would be nice to go to
---
I'm on Xbox one. I never thought of just staying in the same area all the time. Would be better if they had the suggested level of each quest listed so I had a better idea of what to grind for. I'm level 15. Immunized against the scorched, firebreather trained, and I think the game wants me to go over the divide already. To the top of the world resort. But I don't know if that's a good idea. Seems like pacing is an issue.
---
Thats lucky, maybe you were right in the edge of the no build zone or something
---
Yea, but when I tried to slide it out of the wall a little bit it kept sliding back in.
---
I'll make another go when I replenish my frustration buffer.
---
But really, rational snap points and a way to drop things optimally (by, say, _holding_ the placement button for a second) could really make all this go away.
---
Hence my wish list.
---
Same problem after the update. It has a option to store the blueprint, build it again.
---
It's the shielded operative underarmor plan
---
You can try, of course. I just don't bother any more, and try to find help here. 
---
I agree
---
you should probably let the r/iamverysmart sub let know of your superior intelligence and your masterful skill at recognizing evil conspiracies where people who seemingly find obvious flaws in an unperfect video game and wish to talk about them, are in truth all one and the same person in real life and only YOU were smart enough to figure it out.
---
Go on, pls tell the sub your supreme truth and let us dirty peasants know of your grand and vast wisdom.
---
Haha üëç
---
Really want this so much.  Even if it is just "power armor 1", "power armor 2", etc.
---
Glassed caves in the mine at the end there is a boss body that has the armor on it one or two parts but you can only get it daily so you will need to do several runs to complete it,I've got a set in my stash :)
---
My gf and I just finished the mission after putting it aside for a while, and the ending got us both. Overall I loved the mission though
---
This is way too trivial to flag Beth in the title
---
That‚Äôs a good sign that my advice may help. I was also only able to select the wall in my case. Fingers crossed!
---
Got any .45 submachine guns? 
---
Yeah, i have some.
---
Same here buddy started to collect the tokens for my Mr fuzzy and can't go forward.
---
AGREED, MORE BILLIE HOLIDAY, MORE JOHNNY LONG, MORE INK SPOTS
---
they already said it's on the way
---
It's a ps4 thing too. I thought that they would have fixed it by now. I made a comment about this on reddit a while back and some nerd explained to me why it can't happen and why it's impossible to become an adjustable feature. I can't remember why  but I remember wanting to punch them in the nose for having such a technical nerdy reply. 
---
Well now you can get all them items that fell though the world of legendary's now :)
---
this would only get abused with one guy intentionally damaging his buddys camp to get the event started, then have his buddy kill him so they can cash in on the bounty and the event prize (the 10x your level bonus thing) and end it in seconds. I know people are already doing this right now and have their friends take the bounty off of them but this would push things into the extreme as it would be vey lucrative.
---
I would like to see more nuka Lore, Always liked Nuka world.
---
How do you get intoxicated???
---
and...
---
I think the whole base game as we have known it so far is built for DLC's.  Which I think is bloody genius! 
---
This is actually really cool! It even fits the lore in a way! Man if I felt I could enjoy playing I‚Äôd love to help or something lol
---
Wtw
---
Thanks! 
---
Yeah, I'd get a few more levels before doing the Divide. The Forest is the "beginner" area, everything else is harder. [https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc](https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc) this is a map of "suggested" levels. Take into account that as you level, things level with you somewhat. You can explore wherever, but some spots, like the Mire and Bog can be pretty difficult early on. Toxic valley looks scary, but as long as you're not standing in the water, it's not as bad as you might think. But there are more Big Bads up there.   
---
It's rough in the beginning, because there aren't that many quests, and you think you should just focus on those, but really they want you to be in a group. So take your own time, and just explore the Forest and get some levels.   
---
I echo getting perks like Super Duper, it's great for getting you a few extra bonuses when you craft. 
---
Also, remember to scrap your junk often. It weighs less that way. And store it. When you die, the only thing you lose is your junk. You can always go get it, presuming you don't die trying to get it. If you store it often, it's less of a big deal if you die. 
---
If you're concerned about your base being damaged a lot, don't. Early on the stuff you need to fix it are pretty easy to get, mainly wood and steel. And if you set it near a Train station,  you'll always be close to a place to sell stuff. Since Vault 76 is a free fast travel point, what I did near the beginning was set my camp on the other side of the Forest, so I always had fairly cheap travel costs. This link has a map of resource deposits, which are really helpful, if you want that spoiled for yourself. I used it to find lead deposits and put my camp on those. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i\_made\_a\_map\_of\_resource\_deposits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/)
---
I'm on PC so I can't help you with plans, sadly. 
---
i've just made a 3 minute video showing howto allign. it's currently uploading. i'll update when done.
---
Purified water.
---
Unfortunately you're gonna have to rebuild since there's stuff you don't have unlocked. That's the downside of having other ppl build things you haven't unlocked, if you move your camp you end up having to rebuild everything.
---
the ammo vending machines count as a vendor for the quest, better yet is nobody uses them so its always open.
---
We so need a scorched goldfish in the game :)
---
They added more firecracker berries and other flora!
---
Try uninstalling your mods and deleting your .ini file, then report back.
---
If you're om Xbox I got bos knight under armor plans
---
Gah, it infuriates me that a day 1 gun is still broken 6 months after release. I'll still probably reinstall just to be able to finally deck out my camp though. 
---
Now, the only limited time stuff is the fasnacht event coming up, right? All this brewing and drinking stuff is a permanent addition to the game, correct?
---
Thanks boo boo
---
What level are you verses the level of people slap damaging you? Cause I ran with it for about a month, and every time someone slapped me after about the 3rd slap I'd die. 
---
I'd even settle for adding the music from Fallout3 and Fallout4 to the rotation. I sure do miss hearing Sid Phillips' Boogie Man
---
Tricentennial edition is what they own
---
if you are on XBone I can show you
---
Hey u/ladydevann I have an Idea. What if for a future dlc, you get some sort of quest from bubbles (the whitesprings nuka cola vendor) to go and find some rare nuka cola memorabilia. It could involve one of the tnt domes and after you complete the quest, you unlock a nuka cola crafting station and recipe to craft the different kinds of colas. (They would of course take nuka cola bottles and some rare ingredients to craft) and bubbles now sells new nuka cola items for your camp.
---
I think you're mistaken about what pacifist does
---
&gt;You mean  Fallout76Custom.ini? He doesn't have it.
---
Its actually not available as far as I know my friend traded it from someone who got in a dev cell so Im enjoying its limited exclusivity xD 
---
I play solo and had a similar experience with my first character. So after a week or two break, I started a new character knowing what I know about the game and took my time. Took my time going through the main quest. Spent a lot of time just exploring the areas I could handle, leveling up my character, and gathering as much materials, heals, and food/water. I would definitely find a build you like and go with it cause I didn‚Äôt do that on my first character and the game was a lot harder. So yeah basically make a good build and just grind in the low level areas. 
---
I had this issue on PS4 as well and with some other games, I checked the options on my TV and found out that the 16:9 resolution option was causing the issue. By changing it to fullscreen, the edges stopped being cut off.
---
1k a peice if still looking 
---
I'd like to see if I have them or not. Will you be on in 2hrs? What's the price your looking for?
---
It's fun, though. \*shrugs\*
---
I always see like 6-8 civil war suits on vendors, must be you selling them lol \*joking\*
---
I have one right leg, level 50! My gamertag is Cubic Kenshin
---
Please yes. My mutation makes drugs less effective, but food is unaffected. I want to have a lush garden
---
Look up a vendor map and make sure to clean out all 7 factions each day. If I only have a couple minutes that‚Äôs what I do. Crafting outfits is the fastest way to go. If you don‚Äôt have plans make that the first thing you purchase from someone or find one. 
---
On top of that you could collect bulk items like plastic and steel that everyone needs and sell that on the market as well. 
---
I will be on later tonight, my GT is Kaise7en. I can offer tons of help and advice. I've been running around the regular lower areas since beta. I'm maybe level 78 and I've barely done the main mission. I just enjoy the grinding and I have my base at the bottom of the stairs from vault 76. I spend half my time making gear for lower level peeps! See you in the wasteland! 
---
What is the deal with lemonade stand? Can you explain? 
---
The promotion of drinking in the game this week's gonna result in a lot of alcoholics.
---
&gt;Brad Paisley
---
Missed? this song is in game.
---
Go one, hurry up, it's not like he is waiting for you with a sniper rifle, lol :D  (just kidding, i hope ?)  :D
---
It‚Äôs a rare random encounter, you can by plans for lemonade and hard lemonade from him.
---
In for answer. 
---
Would be great and more radio serials like the silver shroud and the other Unstoppable and also the mistress of mystery I love that stuff 
---
Yeah but imagine how hilarious it would be to see people shred high level creatures with infinite ammo
---
I'd suggest creating additional characters..when you max the cap limit with vendors..u can earn more caps with the other character so u don't feel stuck or bored..I watched a fo4 video not too long ago..and it was showing all of the NPCs which made 76 feel very lonely..I liked 4 it was actually my introduction to the series..but I honestly think I played 76 more in a week longer than all of my playtime in 4
---
I think I might start over so I will negate the potential bad perks I took because I didn't know what I was doing.
---
I saw and bought those plans but I dunno what make those plans special actually never used it since. 
---
Im coming, thanks!
---
Thank you. I'll send you an add now.
---
Negative.  Have a Handmade, Lever Action, Shotguns, Prime Gatling and an anti armor grognaks.  
---
You're wasting everyone's time 
---
You can have 5 char in one account. 
---
1400 main
---
1200 alts * 4
---
You can get 6200 caps a day. 43400 a week. 
---
If you have two accounts, you will get 12200 a day and 85400 caps a week. 
---
Some people have 2+ accounts. Especially traders or hoarders. 
---
Caps are pretty easy tbh. 
---
There is a saying if you sell something in caps. It basically means it‚Äôs free. 
---
I'll do it for 450
---
I see well that's creepy 
---
I‚Äôve spent hours trying to get it to spawn XD
---
I'm with you on the vendor caps. I max out the 1400 I have access to every day, drop goodies for low levels, discard unwanted ammo and still have a butt load of things I'd love to sell. Granted, it's low-level legendary items and explosives that the trading forums won't touch but still.. I'd rather make a few caps than just dump it into the ether.
---
then why are you wasting your time replying to this if your saying nothing usefull 
---
My girlfriend is still annoyed I played FO4 for everyday close to a year and I still didnt ‚Äò‚Äôrescue‚Äô‚Äô my baby. üòÇ I told her if I ever go back now that im playing FO76 I promise to go after Shawn/Shaun from the get go.
---
I'll be on, say 150 caps maybe
---
Be me
---
Fresh out the vault
---
Walks down stairs and sees other vault dweller
---
"Here try this" says vault dweller
---
Sure why not
---
Drinks it

"Thank you for the buffs friend"
---
VD stares at me with a grin on his face
---
Suddenly everything goes fuzzy
---
Suddenly things go dark
---
Wake up
---
Feel something in my hands
---
A large smelly egg
---
Drop it
---
Egg breaks
---
Hear loud noises approach
---
Turns head
---
Oh fuck
---
Mfw I'm in a Deathclaw nest
---
they have useless weight too
---
I'll be on, say 150 caps
---
I believe there is a post where someone charts the effects, but I would go 3 Bolstering and 2 Vanguard to have health across the spectrum 
---
Alright I'll message when I get on. I will buy it if I don't have it already.
---
Messaged you on Xbox
---
If you have the space, get blocker, incisor, martial artist too.   You will die in one or two hits.   But you will kill most everything in one hit yourself‚Äîehether by stealth melee or stealth sniping.  Which means if you are sneaking while exploring you will rarely die. 
---
Also:  once you get class freak 3, get the speed demon, marsupial and healing factor mutations.  I also like carnivore. These serums will be around 200 caps each on bazaar/market.  
---
If you do these things the grind will  notably change to more fun. 
---
Go wherever a vendor is..find the closest enemies and defeat them..take all of their loot and sell it all..and repeat at the next vendor..u have to do your homework on each area..and remember..each vendor belongs to a particular faction so once u clean out one vendor..make sure your next vendor is from a different faction
---
Oh yes please! I find myself using Spotify a fair bit, there's just something fitting about Walkin' After Midnight by Patsy Cline playing while cruising around Appalachia!
---
I grew up on country music, my dad loved Marty Robbins so whenever I played New Vegas and Big Iron would play I'd always think of him (just like Patsy, Johnny, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, etc).
---
Waste waste waste
---
Is the game worth going back to? I'm trying to get back to playing video games and i feel like I'll be joining too late in the game. (Level 15ish?) I'm on PC btw
---
There are a bunch more masks coming next week. I share your heebie-jeebies. 
---
13 luck if luck is a factor. Don't know the rest atm not logged in.
---
I got to the cabin and used both cards only to find the key was not there,so I server hopped whent to the basement and the wall opened up again,did this 4 times and gave up on the key.
---
I think this game was primarily made for Fallout veterans and people who like online games.  
---
In regards to the settlements from FO4 I really loved SIM settlements, totally over-hauled the gameplay for me. Im pretty sure they added the survival element in this game to add more content because without constantly fixing weapons and consuming food I honestly think Hoarders like us would have swamped the servers with data usage. One of the things I enjoyed with a near limitless camp in FO4 was collecting all of the unique legendarys, I honestly wonder if its system generated or if there was a set amount of weapons generated. BGS had some good ideas in this game, if they can add some more DLC story content, and honestly, Id take some robot settlers for my camp to tend my crops I could really see myself investing more time into this game. There is alot of potential, but the horrible start really pushed back the time table on content.
---
This is a fantastic idea. I'd also love to see a timer in the quest log for daily quests too. Just a QoL thing but would be super helpful given how many times you'll need to run quests for Biv to unlock all the recipes.
---
Would be an idea, why not have it so we can purchase new songs from the store, that way, licencing can stay lower then it would be for all to listen to?  If they were cheap enough, I would shell out a few cents for this.
---
Behind the agricultural building in the pool
---
Ahhh THAT makes more sense :) Gotcha!
---
And this is exactly why I‚Äôm happy my keyboard has macros built in. 
---
Sure thing man, just lmk
---
Nope, just trying to do something nice, kind of a treasure hunt. However, I guess the downvoters don‚Äôt see it that way.
---
Your comment raises more questions than it answers
---
The workshop south of the Poesidieon Energy Plant has three junk collectors. I would say that's your best bet, but be careful when using a workshop. People may use your workshop as an opportunity to get a free kill on you. 
---
Yeah, something needs to be done to mitigate that. As you said, it‚Äôs already being abused in a similar way. 
---
With that said, there would be no cap gain from that. One would just be passing caps to the other.  The wanted player would lose those caps.
---
Perhaps those on the friend list of the wanted player but not teamed up could be blocked from the event? Or if they‚Äôve been listed as friends within ‚ÄúX‚Äù amount of time prior to the event. It could still potentially be abused but it would take some effort. 
---
There is probably no foolproof mechanic for PvP events, but I agree that some mitigation would certainly be necessary. 
---
What gt? I'll be about an hour and a half.
---
 If you have time, stop by the ATC conservancy real quick. It's a very cool place, and pretty significant as it relates to the Appalachian trail. They have a lot of cool history there. Also, if you look near the bridge you might see vertical white paint stripes. Those are the white blazes which indicate the trail. 
---
yeah, was only kidding, nice and well done of you, pretty weird that someone down votes this :/
---
I‚Äôm not able to pick up the wheigts for lead in Charleston fire station for over a week now.
---
They disappeared from vendors a while ago. I had a couple but already sold them. Still have one dual bar that is also missing from vendors. 
---
I do have my personal saw that‚Äôs dual bar with flamer I‚Äôd sell for a decent offer. 
---
well the stash don't have enought place in my opinion , outfit have weight and they are unusefull  my  weight is to 1200 and i can only remove to 700 max
---
Ot probably had the sacrificial blade mod attached
---
I still need that plan I had so many wetsuit plans..never the helmet 
---
We‚Äôd all like to see mod plans there 
---
Yeah send me a message
---
Haha that works. How does 500 strike ya?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve messaged you
---
Hi there, still holding him ? was on my way to log in now :)
---
I say this person should get a caps reward for that solid bit of advice.
---
The Wanderer by Dion üòÄ great song! 
---
Still holding, tyt. 
---
that happened at a messenger event with radstags I laughed so hard ‚Äò‚Äôits raining radstags‚Äô‚Äô
---
No, i dont "go around".
---
If you need to be talked into or convinced like the 50 other people, maybe the game isn't for you. Thanks for policing my opinion though :)
---
how much would you offer for bloodied tesla rifle or LMG? not sure if i want to sell just curious
---
&gt; with 5 pieces you have 75% less overall damage,  
---
Basically my camp was in the area til the latest patch where it got removed, post-patch the area's been modified and some strange pylons have been added (new assets), presumably prep for Wild Appalchia DLC
---
Thanks, on my way :D
---
Upload speed is 4.5 mbps and download speed is 10 mbps
---
Ooo, cool, haven't seen that yet! Anyone have any images?
---
I have a whole pile of them, people keep leaving them behind.
---
The archive list in the ini should look like this:
---
\[Archive\]  
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2 
---
That's the vanilla version and you should no longer fall into the void.
---
Debatable, I have 5 pieces on and its definitely not anywhere near only half damage lol
---
I am on PC.   IGN: Ocoma
---
The only mat I remember because I don't have any and couldn't immediately do my own was 4 pure fluorescent flux. The rest of the mats I have plenty of. If you happen to have 8 of those flux I'd be happy to do one for you and one for myself.  :-)  I'll be on around 8pm PST
---
Same as my reddit name, I can also paint power armor to bos initiate,knight,and knight captain,and can also make combat armor chest and legs to bos
---
Ok, so I have zero idea how you do this.  I tried and tried to figure out something with the keypad door, but all I could ever get it to do was open from the outside, shut, then never open from the inside no matter what I did.  Right now I've just got a powered door with a switch on the inside.  I remove a wall when I want to get in, put it back, then switch the door open while I'm there.  Switch it closed when I leave and fast travel out.  :(
---
Yesterday a level 180 was using the follow me emote directing me to the overseers cache in the church at flatwoods..it was full of great junk including 
---
* 20 ballistic fiber
---
* 15 fiber optics
---
* 75 purified water!!! I was running low too
---
I'm usually the one who is always giving away things but that was definitely the best free things I received from another player..I was using my level 44 alt character BTW
---
RIP my XO1 calibrated shock leg i accidentally scrapped when my scrap menu lagged. Definitely need a lock option. I get anxiety selling and scrapping now lol.
---
It scraps for salt too.
---
That's me. Anything at vendors that you see a lot of, are worth making and selling üòä
---
I completely agree! I didn‚Äôt get through the content quite as fast as you, so I never really had to take a break from the game, but the new content is so welcome and gives me hope for the future of the game. 
---
One of my favourite aspects of the game is the photo mode feature1 because nothing makes me happier than having a load screen pop up with a silly picture of my friends and I playing together, or a reminder of an exciting discovery playing solo. :)
---
I might make a showing. Ears will bleed!
---
wall of text where is TLDR
---
Eh, it fits better than Kokomo I suppose
---
You‚Äôre right, but I hope they put it in Fallout Miami
---
Are the new BOS paints from technical data?
---
What level are u
---
No I think he saying as a world spawn not a paper bag drop
---
If you need a lot, your best bet is the Poseidon workshop. There‚Äôs a gravel pit node there. 
---
A Floridian Fallout it would definitely work for
---
Sounds fun! I might be there
---
That's cause other people are getting there first. 
---
People like you are what suck about this game go attack peoples workshops and leave innocent people alone, you peice of shit.
---
Met a fella last night called DangerousEinstein on Xbox and he was level 24 or something and I‚Äôm level 4 he gave me a bunch of free stuff and let me use his house!
---
Don't take this as me being a smart-ass but u can set your camp up close to your favorite flora 
---
I had this happen back in December. I couldn't get it to stop without closing the game. Fun fact, you can open doors from really far away. It's fun to mess with people like this lol. Wish I knew how to do it at will.
---
Device?
---
If the guy was sleeping the ghoul would attack him tho
---
There's a couple bags in the Super Duper mart in Watoga. And the gnomes all have concrete, I think.
---
You're correct, feel I've never heard it on the in game radio.
---
The only problem with going back to fo4 now would actually be the lack of multiplayer. It definitely adds something to the game, a sense of danger or just pure randomness that can't be obtained with scripted characters. 
---
That'd be super helpful. So you know they wont do it. xD
---
Yeah, they're in the locker A LOT. People just aren't picking them up with the plans.
---
Not 1?!?!?
---
How much to paint me like one of your french ladies
---
I found that 10-25 can be a bit of a pain in the ass. 
---
First suggestion, stay in the forest for a while, and complete lower level events like "Feed the people" and "Collision course" they'll net you caps, a good chunk of exp, usually stim packs/rad away and other goodies like plans. I did these events often for a while. Good item returns plus plans. 
---
I don't know what you're using for weapons but I largely ran a machete (serated if you can mod it at your weapons workbench) and a hunting rifle. It's a good combo, wear em down and then hack em to bits. A few perk cards boosting your melee style of choice makes a big difference at low levels. 
---
When ever you kill animals take their meat. Cook it. It doesn't spoil after that and adds buffs, but will also keep you fed. Water can be gotten any wear, just boil it at a cooking station.  Soups like corn soup count as food and drink so those are always handy. 
---
Setting up a camp with some water purifiers definitely makes water management easier.  I generally will prep a bunch of food, eat, drink etc before wandering off questing. 
---
I also tend to make sure I'm crafting new armour every 5 levels at lower levels, to ensure I'm getting max damage protection. 
---
You can also put a few points in Charisma and take lone wanderer which gives you an AP and Damage reduction boost when playing solo. 
---
You can still absolutely be an explorer, you just have to avoid wandering too far into areas meant for higher level players. You are just kind of in the slog area level wise for 76. Soon you'll be in your 20's and it'll be easier. 
---
Damn. I'm afraid I can't.
---
I found out when I harvested an area and went somewhere else, the system will grow them back shortly, but I couldn‚Äôt harvest those new ones. It‚Äôs probably a mechanism to satisfy multiple players but one can‚Äôt harvest them repeatedly. This even carries over to the next game you play. After I harvest an area, quit the game, and on another server I couldn‚Äôt harvest the same plants. 
---
The problem is ASCAP. They have to pay to use most of the songs they use. There are a bunch of songs that are recorded with no copyright or other rights covering them that can be utilized for free, or for a very nominal charge. 
---
I personally would love some Hank Williams Sr songs, especially his last recording/release  Kaw-liga and Your Cheatin' Heart. I do like it when Bob Wills comes on. I may be too young to have heard a lot of the country greats when they were in their prime or still alive, but I still love listening too them. Anything but the Bakersfield country, I just never liked that type. 
---
I'm gonna finally explore tanagra town now 
---
I noticed this as well. It seems Lots of flora have been enhanced for better visibility.
---
There is a buildable spot near the graveyard. I have my house set in there too.
---
haven't tried it lately, but for whatever reason you used to be able to eat scorched Wendigo. 
---
I did Feed the People for the first time in months and maybe had 12 enemies spawn the entire time. A single mole rat on the first phase, and a handful of ghouls on each of the next 2. I‚Äôm lvl 96 and the other person was in his 70s. I‚Äôve done it solo before with dozens of spawns per round. They used to scale up the more players there were. Now it‚Äôs just sad. 
---
Same with the Enclave bot event. Did it prepatch and was overwhelmed with super mutants. Post patch I got one at a time for the entire timer. A second wouldn‚Äôt spawn until i killed the first one. 
---
Yea, the stash space has doubled since launch but we could definitely use a bit more wiggle room. I like the 1200 number. I'm hoping we get there when the player vending comes out. 
---
I've been playing since the beta, and my biggest advice is don't be afraid to start a new character. I've started several characters as my knowledge of how the game works has expanded. My current main is only level 21, but I have the background information -- where plans spawn, secret spots, events I like, how to use the perk cards -- which makes her easier to play. 
---
Yep very thoughtful touch to enhance the game experience. Thank you Bethesda! 
---
Firecracker berries look amazing now..we can actually see them
---
Man, I remember exploring that place in beta wondering what the purpose of the special "growth serum" recipes and computers hooked up to machinery was going to be for.
---
GET IN LADS
---
I‚Äôve had the same experience! Hundreds of hours in the game and I‚Äôve never had greifers coming into my beautifully decorated home trying to PVP when I‚Äôm scrapping and crafting and subsequently blowing up and wrecking the place UNTIL this new update. Since then I‚Äôve had this happen multiple times! 
---
New radio station on update 9 sounds appropriate.  The songs are always epic.
---
Giving lower level users stuff is practically my favorite thing to do in game. 
---
get the good doggy perk, equip it (when you go to eat dog food. dont full time it) pick up any dog food cans ya find, equip slow metabolizer.. thru hiker and good with salt as well. Now, yes those will take place of some more useful perks but the trade off on those is two dog food cans fill the food bar, thru hiker reduces food weight 90% less, good with salt reduces spoilage rate so if you male something to eat it takes about 4-5 (actual) days before it spoils.   
---
there is also a perk for water you can equip to drink directly from streams and such.
---
cook and eat whatever you find stockpile dog food for emergencies.. grab all meat the drops and cook it. 
---
also you can invest in the cannibal perk and never have to worry about food again, and can heal off the corpses you just killed to save stims.  
---
water keep enough large purifiers to make a minimum 30 water, raid it either at log in or log out for next play session, try to keep round 40 on you at any given time, put any extras in stash, but keep stash limit to around 20ish to save weight.  
---
use food to help heal yourself and water works to heal you as well save your chems for during fights, look into getting the healing factor perk. i used to have a hard time with stimpacks until i started using food and healing factor outside of fights exclusively to heal myself.  
---
as far as respawns, not much can be done other than running with a partner to watch your back while ya in a terminal and so on. someone passing by can cause an area respawn ive had that happen to me at westtek a time or two and it gets hairy when it happens.
---
if your on ps4 add me psn: Silune can give you a helping hand, or you can come raid my water purifiers as needed, or tag along or whatever trouble im gettin in to. also run with a pretty good group of men and women that would gladly toss a helping hand or play guard duty for ya if needing to spend time in terminals.
---
To shorten loading screens? üòÇ
---
I'll take this over the 50 asking why they should bother coming back to this game or purchase it daily...
---
yay im in!
---
if you need any extra food or chems let me know. I am on xbox as well and can spare lots of food and chems if you need anything. 
---
Mate I jumped endless times and guess what I did that before and kinda know how long it takes to get them. 
---
Never thought about those.
---
That would make sense because I definitely noticed more by my camp this week.  
---
&gt; It doesn't make any sense as a competitive PvP mechanic though. 
---
Doesn't seem like bethesda agrees. They are Public, with-ought pvp you could take a workshop and never give it up.   
---
&gt; If you need the resources, XP and low-level camp plans from workshops, you're not going to be equipped for PvP.  
---
Until they nurf Sentinel legendary effects, most people aren't "Equipped" for pvp anyway. Its again, the risk you take for grabbing a workshop, is someone might come take it from you, or kill you.   
---
How do you suggest people get workshops from others if you can't pvp? because you just holding it because you got there first doesn't feel fair or deserved.
---
That's what I was thinking, too. 
---
Same here 
---
I've done the same thing at the Inn outside of Flatwoods, sometimes they're there and sometimes they aren't for ages. 
---
Nice one guys 
---
Then don't take workshops, but frankly removing pvp from them doesn't make them more balanced, just makes it exploitable by one guy claiming everything and not allowing others to use them.
---
Ya I noticed that too but there is or was a bigger issue where you could not harvest all of them even if you hadn't been there for days. I actually just did my first run sense the update it it went well had 140 violets. They are much easier to find now! 
---
Yeah. Compare to the beautifully enhanced species, red hot blooms (aster) could use a little boost, their dark red color isn‚Äôt very easy to find in the dark orange atmosphere. 
---
Doing it solo is the easiest way because there are less bot spawns 
---
damn ! ok
---
&gt; People are getting bent out of shape because between losing up to as much as 120 caps per death and getting repeatedly killed by fully specced PVPers when you just wanted some acid, 2000 miles away from the actual PVP zone, sucks. That's all there is to it. 
---
Then don't take workshops? I don't get why your entitled to having a workshop but being immune to pvp. Doesn't matter the distance.
---
Ps4 at least allows you to use Spotify simultaneously. Just drop the music volume to 0 and use spotify. 
---
How much for escavator shocks
---
Please devs, just make it so that any item that is currently equipped or favorited can't be scrapped.
---
do you know where to find plans for the missle turret? 
---
Trueeee..at whitespring I'm pretty sure I memorized all the flora and their exact locations tho üò≠üòÇ
---
Got three here to join 
---
of course there would be a cap gain, not only if simply the wanted player doesnt have caps on him, but especially because as you suggested the idea, there would be additional caps awarded based on one players level. That of course adds caps to be gained as well.
---
We just need seperate and pure PvE and PvP servers as quickly as possible no matter what. As things are right now, this cant go on.
---
Yeah, that'd be nice. 
---
can't wait starts on Tues
---
Fallout 76 was not ready for release 
---
Nice bro. Join if you can.. server may be full
---
I believe you have it already.  But you have to equip the home defense lvl 3 perk card.  I "think" anyways.
---
Raider type here. Bring it. 
---
A server full of under-geared pve weenies? 
---
Lol no problem. Me and my buddy attacked a group of 12 the other day. I initiated/baited by orbital striking the CAMP they were hanging out in. We farmed them for caps until they asked us nicely fo stop. (Which we did).  We must have killed the whole group 4 or 5 times over... I didnt die, my buddy only died twice. 
---
I would argue the 10x bounty is bullshit. Thats 10k caps. This would bankrupt most players. That would probably make it so the only people wrecking camps are bankrupt anyway... I dont like that at all. That would basically put an end to CAMP raids all together.
---
Remember the bounty displayed is only half of the real bounty. You see 500, i lose 1000. Todd takes half. 
---
A flat 2k caps would be better... but i want a reward of 2k caps taken from the players in the event "hunting" me if i win. Over and above their junk and normal caps lost at death. 
---
In reality tho... No one would ever join. Most pve types dont want anything to do with pvp.
---
Makes for a great ghillie suit for hunter/hunted in the Forest region.
---
Damn that looks awesome. Was it tasty?
---
Just a guy gushing about a game he likes, it's nothing. 
---
Keep up the good fight üëç
---
World full yeah best of luck 
---
Many of mine are too. I have filled the map as well but many of the places I've found don't count. The one that angers me the most right now is the disease one as I have just a couple left but no matter how many times I get sludge lung, it doesn't count on the challenge.
---
Cheers bro. She will die lol! Keep trying to join if you want, will be dropping another 2 after this one dude

i moved my camp out near bog town to be closer to it and watoga, bog town always seems to be a hot bed for quite a few things, and usually some pretty good fights.
---
I think they need some Elvis
---
Eventually everyone will have it, and it just won't be special anymore,dangit.
---
That must be profitable, though.
---
God rays lol
---
Yea there are a few that‚Äôs indeed not harvestable near glassed cavern. Also in WS there are a few rhododendrons refuse to mutate, they always stay purple never turn fluorescent. Un-mutable itself must be a new mutation üòÇ
---
I really just need to spend some time with it and play around. Cant a man have a detached garage?!
---
asking the seal questions
---
I was actually cheering for the raiders in that story. Because someone so dumb to believe you can go and play superhero secret agent in a post-nuklear world is just insanely dumb and deserves to lose. If that mistress really had such vast ressources and personell able to come up with good weapons they should go and help either the responders or the free states with that instead of trying to go with their little james bond cult. Even more because they werent fixing anything, they were only going around and killing people they deemed a threat (or gain intelligence in order to find out who needs to die). This isnt re-building stuff this is just fighting symptoms of a larger issue.
---
Good to see this comparsion. Im mainly using BE .50 and Gatling Laser. I thought about trying the LMG, but its just too expensive to craft ammo in large amounts, compared to the .50.
---
Math isn't debatable. 
---
Finally did it! Ran out of ammo and was down to some melee nonsense, but thanks everyone for the tips!
---
Not sure about your fist question, but I do know you can find WS plans in the wild in containers. I‚Äôve found 3 so far. One was in a locked metal box inside WS. 
---
One of the biggest problems I've had was accidentally allocating points to SPECIAL categories because I pressed the wrong button. When you first go into that screen, shit is confusing.
---
Ha when they make them all glow you‚Äôre probably like ‚ÄòOMG never realized there‚Äôs some more here‚Äô üòÇ
---
Well redo your math, its definitely not 45%
---
To be more specific to my problem, it just randomly crashes at the exact moment when you successfully pick a lock. Doesn‚Äôt matter the type of lock. Every once in a while (sometimes it‚Äôs the first lock I pick, sometimes the 12th) at the very moment that I hear the ‚Äúsuccessful pick‚Äù sound (the click) my game crashes back to my Bethesda Launcher. Just kind of ruins the momentum. 
---
These have been at the soda fountain store in the whitesprings since launch, so no, it's not a new item.
---
Got the key, but have yet to find the plans or Nuka Grape inside after opening the door
---
Sir you are not able to remove the sun from the game. It has been said vault tec looked at ways to see if they can adjust or use rays from the sun to have a different effect on the scorchbeasts. The research failed! 
---
My advice is to not look directly in the sunlight. The effect is a stylized choice by bethesda and is not too bad. Its light shafts.
---
This sounds hilarious and awesome, time zone is crazy different for me but I‚Äôll try to be there üëçüèº (Lady Rot Roh)
---
I'm working on a similar build. Primarily high health. Here's my thoughts:
---
No Vangaurds. At high health without Vanguards, there's time to pop a stimpack or whatever you use to heal. I tend to find fights over rather quickly without taking too much damage. There are also some perks that can bump up DR/ER, such as Evasive, Ironclad, Barbarian (DR only, pair with leather armor), and one of my personal favorites, Blocker, as melee is where I seem to take most damage. You don't have to have them all and you might find Ironclad a waste. Evasive is great if you rely on agility while Barbarian is great if you desire strength.
---
Unyielding, while tempting, should be used if you're going all-out low health build. You could work in a couple of pieces. The extra strength (carry weight/melee damage if you use it at all), charisma (for bartering), and agility (for sneaking) is nice, but not necessary. The downside is to truly benefit from it, you need to be at fairly low health and there's no Endurance bump. Defensive perks are highly recommended.
---
So that leaves Bolstering. As I touched on above, fights are either over fairly quickly, or you're in a bind (think West Tek) and need some stiffer DR when in a good fight. This can buy you time to pop another stimpack, especially when you realize that lvl 52 Mister Gutsy pop gun hurts! Couple that with Nerd Rage, Dodgy, and/or Serendipity and that will help you win when your health gets low. The upside is that you don't necessarily need the defensive perks, but at least 1 or 2 will greatly help.
---
There are numerous ways to combine and mix armor with perks, but most of it boils down to what you're willing to sacrifice.
---
Yeah? Well I'll do it for 400
---
Nice thanks. I'm just looking for advice and I will take whatever you can offer. At this point I'm desperate and would settle for spoiled items. I feel like I've been playing dark souls
---
I'll try this out later 
---
Oi make your own posts
---
Ok I'm not going to argue basic mathematics and game mechanics with you. If you want to believe that 15% stacked multiplicatively equals 75% then you do you. 
---
And sometimes I see them but can‚Äôt pick them up and they just vanish in fornt of me. Same goes for the ones in the hotel north of flatwoods.
---
Ok bud
---
Such a shame. AWOL still had the same amount of enemies in it at the same scaling rate as pre patch so it seems as if it maybe only some events? I‚Äôm going to test other nuke sites and see if it‚Äôs similar results tonight. I pray it isn‚Äôt because I really do still enjoy nuking places. I think it‚Äôs the coolest mechanic and has a lot of potential but it is getting worse. 
---
Scorchbeast King!
---
One way you can sort of do it, is by painting one of your sets.It only distinguishes the one in the list, but since I go around with my excavator set and my fighting set, it helps me out.
---
Welcome to the community üòÄ If your looking for a sweet beginners camp location, there is a junk pile just on the river to the left of Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm. You can build a Junk Extractor as well as a Water Purifier to help with resources and water starting off. 
---
It is nice how friendly players are. I accidently shot someone in the face,  i was startled. I sat there and waited for him to end me. They just walked away.
---
Actually, I am not an IPA guy, but the Black IPAs are tad smoother and not as hoppy. And this one in particular was tasty and refreshing. I bought it for the FO connection, but enjoyed it after all.
---
Gorge Junkyard workshop has a concrete resource extractor. 
---
I wasn't saying remove them from pvp, just saying there really isn't an incentive to take them, and the mechanics allow for too much cheesing.  Maybe just have a timer before you can attack the person you're claiming it from so they can at least have time to react.  Like give notice, you have 5-10 seconds to prepare. 
---
This x2
---
Do you get bloody screws? I have 1200 units of steel,  3 screws. 
---
Love the idea!
---
I've never even seen one decent piece of wood armor.  Does anyone actually even wear wood armor?
---
Just an update: After server hopping around 20 times or more last night I gave up in disgust &amp; went to bed. 
---
After pottering around this morning I decided to log in and try again - first server the secret door did not open in the basement so I rushed to the manor, generatored a new code then went back &amp; &amp; opened the secret door.... SUCCESS!!!
---
Fast traveled to TNT &amp; got my plans.
---
So be patient anyone who can't find it, looks like they may respawn after 4- 8 hours.
---
I think you're just making it too complicated... if you don't put the wall connector too close it should be about the right length:

Bethesda did not properly design the interface to accommodate overscan, which most TVs are set to. You CAN manually fix by setting your TV to ‚Äúfull mode‚Äù instead of 16:9 and/or setting your TV to full pixel from widescreen or full mode. Graphics getting cut off has been bugging me since I started playing 76, so I just set my PS4 HDMI input to full pixel. Bethesda does need to fix this thought, it is a bug and should not require users to reprogram their TV just to play the game. 
---
There's an emergency button in both secret doors.
---
Maybe ass holes do.
---
This is me vomiting.
---
&gt;Theres no way to buy more caps with real money which, imo, is super annoying.
---
Am I reading this right? You want FO76 to have micro transactions for caps?
---
I saw that I earned something Jefe (Big Jefe or El Jefe I can‚Äôt remember) from Biv and I couldn‚Äôt find it in my inventory right after earning the rewards.
---
Could be something to do with not knowing the name but it didn‚Äôt seem to be by my recipes...
---
Anyone know what that is let me know!
---
Teddy bear Teddy bear turn around!
---
No unfortunately, but if you need to know how to farm a lot of lead for bullets, i can show you how to do that, you will realize that your eating through your steel
---
Cool...so the owner does not need to be around? Just set items, set prices and anyone can walk up and buy stuff?
---
Agree, it's getting really ridiculous for a DAILY challenge. Yesterday we required to drink 50 alcohol in  single day, while the weekly challenge require us to drink 76 alcohol. It just doesn't make any sense anymore.
---
Maybe next time they want us to kill SBQ THREE TIMES!!! while wearing wood armor and sacrificial dagger for the daily challenge. /s
---
Alright. Send me a DM here so we can talk about it, and when I can play later I‚Äôll make sure I have everything for the mod. 
---
^This right here. I can't put the game down! 190+ hrs since Christmas.
---
The issue isn't caused by the locked items (I still haven't unlocked the Bearskin Rug, Nuka-Cola machine or Fusion Generator, and blueprints with those items place easily). It's not even due to the new patch.
---
The game has always been irritating in this way. Even if it's green, properly sunk into the ground and has plenty of room, larger buildings won't place. It's not your fault, it's been a big since launch, like walls being difficult to clip into stairs, walls being hard to replace on two story buildings, the single stairs having massive invisible pillars at the end, etc.
---
I adore CAMP building, but it is a very broken system. Bethesda is working to improve, but it'll take time.
---
Unfortunately you either have to build an.extremely ugly upside down pyramid (one foundation on floor and inexplicable, floating house on top) or rebuild it every time you move.
---
I'm not exactly sure how to check or do that update reversal, but I'll look around whenever I get home. I still think it's my shit CPU, but I'll see.
---
No it isnt. I get an chance at an objective benefit. If they attack me (my goal) i get to kill them for caps AND take their junk. 
---
Its literally an advertised aspect of the game and not greifing at all.
---
Had this happen to me (used cards keypad wouldn't work). Got new key cards and code - keypad worked, got dome keys &amp; plan. I start with checking the dome to see if the door was locked, all the ones I could open the dome door the keys had already been picked up.
---
I know where to farm, but it is a chore. 
---
You know,  I play when I don't have to do chores....
---
High strength &amp; perception (12ish) These are for all damage minus pistols.
---
Low Endurance. (1-3)(more HP but less special points to focus on damage)
---
Charisma 9 (to share a rank three perk card)
---
Intelligence 5-8 
---
Agility 4 (depends on build, only four sucks but it‚Äôs not for damage)
---
Luck 5 (rank two starched jeans and rank three class freak)
---
My main character has 15s/12p/3e/9c/8i/4a/5l
---
I plan to sacrifice intelligence for agility. It‚Äôs perfect for heavy/melee/rifles, so pretty much everything.
---
My cowboy is something like 12s/9p/1e/9c/5i/15a/5l
---
Also strong with pretty much everything. This time with specialty in pistols too.
---
And he for sure checked that specific file path to make sure?
---
I‚Äôm really really hoping that the wastelander DLC adds human NPCs in some fashion, even if it‚Äôs just a small outpost of new survivors moving back to the region 
---
AHAHA
---
I have a two shot not explosive w silencer
---
100% grief all the time
---
Constantly, it probably has to do with the underground locations from the dlc
---
Apples and oranges
---
This is correct, you just need to have home defense level 3 equipped.
---
Any armor?
---
It‚Äôs actually a way to let you know the lode bearing event is up. 
---
That happens to me all the time, but it's because I have latency issues with my internet. So the world will load in, and it looks like everything is there, but when it actually loads in things will be gone. I have to wait a few seconds at the new Tattoo place Biv is in, because for me it starts as a plain board before becoming the door it actually is. 
---
When you reach level 50 you'll have a chance with each level up to move points around. But that is also the cap for your points. 
---
I'd start out with perks that will make your guns better, like gunsmith and whatever weapon you use most like shotgun or rifle perks. I also went with the basic crafting  perks and storage perks first when I restarted my character. 
---
I just started playing today. Got ganked by a level 100+ player and their friend as a level 6 trying to learn how to play. It was pretty shitty because I lost all of my junk.
---
On the flip side, I LOVE it as under armor for vault tec painted leather. Bought it knowing it went underneath. It's nice getting to see my armor I've slowly accrued with the right armor types and legendary affixes. Still have a few pieces I need to get that out class or are equal to my min/maxed clown suit armor combo, but its given me something to focus on acquiring rather than just hoping I get a lucky drop.
---
Favorite look right now has all leather with:
---
Chest- Light
---
Arm- 1 Sturdy / 1 Heavy (might be 1 Light / 1 Sturdy, not at my PC)
---
Leg- Sturdy (honestly Light/Sturdy/Heavy all work great here, I go with Light or Sturdy so the focal point is still on the big ol yellow running shoes and the fact that I'm in a track suit/running a heavy AGI build)
---
Makes for a really cool ensemble. I'm sure the vault tec combat armor paint can look pretty sick too.
---
Really glad they made it under armor. Definitely not enough variation for the category. We shouldn't need to put on a cover-all outfit for every attempt at style. I've honestly gotten really tired of the outfit rotation I've been doing between level 30-160. Its nice to see armor again!
---
Still might not be ideal for you in the short term, but chin up! You bought one of the few outfits that's technically useful with Linings and such. Happy little accident!
---
Use the Swimsuit outfit or just go commando 
---
I also often load in as a naked level 1 character and then Blip! I'm a level 100 wearing power armor. 
---
God damn it I remember looking for the things back there and couldn't figure out where they were. Never once looked in the pools.
---
I live within 15 minutes of Point Pleasant, and I can remember probably three years ago, during the Mothman festival, their was a vendor selling those exact beers and they weren‚Äôt checking IDs lol.
---
Indie artists would be MORE than willing to work something out for cheaper. The exposure alone would be priceless to them.
---
That sound really fun 
---
Nah. Lots of people have not. I have not. I just orbital strike the people that do.
---
Did you take her down? I tried and failed earlier today. Almost asked for folks to join on here before. Did anyone take you up on it?
---
Guess so...getting downvoted for asking a few questions...
---
Haha, this does sound like a challenge. Time how long it takes to get home. 
---
thanks, I'll check it out
---
Its patched
---
Maybe... Could be fun...
---
[SBQ still](https://i.imgur.com/BlihlBh.png) [crashing server.](https://i.imgur.com/BlihlBh.png) Also got another disconnect on a nuked zone early on. Other than that it's better.
---
Yeah. It's getting really risky to give your fully modded armor chassis just to apply the paint job. What if that person just log off with my fully modded power armor chassis calibrated shocks x2, jetpack, and HUD.
---
It would be nice if we can make a MOD to sell / trade.
---
I've read about a couple other people this has happened to, I'm jelly. I live on a cliff, though, so I imagine if I did get a magically gifted radstag, it'd probably just fall to it's death. :(
---
Check your settings and see if the chat volume is turned all the way down. It randomly happened to me after playing for months. 
---
You would think with all the technology someone would have dropped a fully charged  Ipood so i could listen to my own music 
---
Agreed. I use those turret camps to my advantage as the perfect spot to drop orbital strikes. I never found a use for orbital strikes out side of these turret camps.
---
Thats a bummer, but there is a good chance the next few players you encounter will be nice. In my experience as a low level over the past few months about 75% of the higher level players have dropped me a few plans or useful items, and the other 25% have just ignored me or waved and went on with merry way. 
---
Welcome! I do suggest working through the main quest line, it nicely ramps you up with plans, XP, knowledge, weapons, tutorials and lots more. And yes it‚Äôs a very fun game!
---
So the keypad door has a hidden power connector inside the wall in the center at the top of the door. You have to send power to the pressure plate and then from the plate to that connector and then it should open when you step on the plate. 
---
I wish they'd add weapon/armor racks to 76. It'd be a cool way to store all the stuff we currently have hoarded in our stash. 
---
It's tied to level. Once you get past 150 you'll start getting the good mods showing up. They're almost common for me now. Got so many jetpacks on first try, had a calibrated shock show up in my vendor run. That one is sort of rare, worth buying if low level. The shock and targeting hud are the ones harder to find.
---
Ugh, right? Noooo thank you. 
---
Ah yes I had this. It seems to let you place it again, even if if shouldn't.
---
Move it another 100 metres up the road and it might be ok.
---
I learned in AA that that's not the only solution
---
Max Lvl? How much do you want for it? 
---
I think it did that before, though.  Could be wrong...
---
Right on. I‚Äôve had some better experiences since then.
---
Games good :)
---
Well done   :)

Some would, for sure. Look at the resurgence of a John Denver song covered by a previously unknown (to most) band..
---
Same thing occurs when I changed my TV resolution, I have two options, wait for Bethesda to fix it, or get a new TV.
---
1. It's a glass bottle.
---
2. The Nuka-Dark Rum incident wasn't a scam, it wasn't ever advertised as a glass bottle. Furthermore, Bethesda had nothing to do with the manufacturing of the product, which was carried out by a third party. The nylon bags _were_ a scam. The bottles _weren't_
---
3. You wouldn't wanna waste that for some plastic. Sell it for twice the price when player vending comes out. Low levels who haven't met Bubbles yet will pay for it and you'll be richer!
---
I have one character build I call "the bottom feeder". It's mostly quality of life and fun perks. What platform and level are you on?
---
For PVE, one thing that is handy are a few big damage instigating weapons. Once you get a decent one, you consumables from PVE go way down.
---
Ouch and lol!!!
---
A glitch stopped me from finding the meeting place and its still my favorite story in the game.
---
I would recommend any/sentinel and/or any/cavalier. Ideally maby like 2 vanguard sentinel, 2 bolstering sentinel and 1 unyelding sentinel. Could also be like troubleshooters (or some other useless primary effect) sentinel/cavalier since I prefer damage distribution over damage resistance.
---
My camp is on top of Seneca rocks, so until I can hitch a ride in a vertibird I'm going to be stuck
---
Also a side note, INT effects the amount of junk you get from scrapping as well. +20% at 2 INT, Peaking at 6 INT w/ +50% and tapering to +66% at 15 INT. I'll post the link when I find it again. 
---
Unfortunately no matter what setting I use, even 16:9, I still can‚Äôt see 5/10% of the screen. Even Full Pixel doesn‚Äôt show everything. I‚Äôm praying that Bethesda fixes this soon, I‚Äôve heard that Fortnite does something to make it full screen on Overscanning tv‚Äôs, so it‚Äôs possible.

It's an alternate reality, several things are not the same as our reality.

I asked him if he used mods and he denied and I also specifically asked about that file in another reply and he also denied having it.

Do your still have one?

Round 2 coming up
---
I love how the room of the daughter who worked with the raiders reflected her heart.
---
Sorry both are a kind of ammowaste. Thanks for your offer
---
That happened to me as well.
---
Think it's the same as adrenal reaction last patch. Works fine on my post patch character is broken on my pre patch characters. I guess remove and reapply.
---
I need this recipe! 
---
Some of the rewards are just drinks, like I got Tick blood tequila sunrise drink and lead champagne recipe 
---
Thanks for the feedback. I'll have to try some. Used to love IPAs but trend of making them as hoppy as possible turned me off to them so this sounds good.

It‚Äôs always done that. The area is not at all stable due to the heavy mining activity and the coal fires.

That being said behemoths have a LOT of hp

This is the correct answer. I put a bunch of different drinks into the fermenter that i picked up in the wild and nothing happened. If the drink doesn‚Äôt have a condition bar, it can‚Äôt be aged any further.

Every single one I and my teammates have found in power armors since the update have been exactly 25%.

Talking dozens.  Watoga, mama dolce, etc.  doesn‚Äôt matter where.

Yeah, I'm not sure what happened but a lot of people are missing their photos.

Planting nuked fauna next to your fusion generator or having to have a base near the nuclear power plants would be kinda funny.

Its a fucking SURVIVAL video game your point is null and void

A few of the dailies I usually run when I log on don't work any more after the update, Camden being one of them. I hope they're aware and get them fixed soon. I'm at like 300 tokens too; so close. 
---
Just remembered as long as you don't fight back they will get a bounty, then there are players like me who live to collect bounties.
---
It's been a known issue since beta, but I don't think Bethesda has worked on it yet. Sometimes, it will remove your characters hair as well
---
Same for me. 
---
I'll check there.. its been a few weeks i've been searching for them.. did 30+ maps, events, server hops, ect.. 
---
Every damned update since the beginning has wiped my pictures.
---
Okay, I logged in earlier and my place didn‚Äôt get removed. It‚Äôs along the river on the West side of the map that runs along that big forest area you can‚Äôt go to, so perhaps I‚Äôm just suuuuper close to the no-go line? 
---
I'm closer to watoga (stone arc), so it will be a walk...
---
It‚Äôs a little hard in the beginning but it gets easier as you go. Use strategies as if you‚Äôre in a real life scenario. Don‚Äôt go into a fight where you can‚Äôt win, figure out ways to fight enemies one at a time instead of taking on a whole group at once. The terrain and structures are fantastic for guerrilla warfare. Some parts of the game engine is broken, i.e. stealth doesn‚Äôt work at all sometimes. But a lot of the mechanism do work. If you can play other first person shooter games you‚Äôll handle fo76 no problem. 
---
If you're launching circa 10 PM EST post and I'll join the battle

Oh alright. I don't suppose there's a way for her to recover them?

Jesus. I'm sorry, Dude.

Yeah but it popped up on screen, Recipe: White Russian. So I dont know. Not that big a deal I guess just have to hope to get it again.

Sorry, the handmade are gone. I still have a level 35 bloodied explosive pump action shotgun.
---
Thankfully I‚Äôm on Xbox though and screenshot them after taking them in game.
---
I like everything except losing your gear. No friggin way.
---
Pretty dumb that there‚Äôs only one per server.
---
You can buy them from the vendor in whitesprings for about 55 caps. As you enter the main doors.. up the stairs to the right and then just hug the left hand side wall. 
---
I'm not sure. If you find a way, lemme know lol. :(
---
Yep.  
---
I'd also like a radio station with a load of classic labor songs, to go along with the Big Ernie Ford numbers.
---
Unrelated to your business but can you pm me a screenshot of your perk loadout? I have a merchant character in the works and I wanted to see how similar my projection is to someone who actually does it. Keep doing what you do mate. 
---
Wait what?
---
That's pretty smart! I'll let her know to do the same. Thank you
---
Most of the workshops on the divide and east side of the divide give ballistic fiber as junk rewards.
---
Is a generator with the best budget to power ratio,  generate 100 electric units for your camp. 
---
Does no require cores, nor it produce cores. 
---
Will do! Same to you if you find any information. 
---
I‚Äôm fine with them. The Quantum puzzle had no logical sense nor progression from a certain point onwards so...better that way then roaming and searching for literally random stuff
---
Thanks. I will see what I can do.
---
Yes I noticed firecrackers mixed with rhododendrons too around WS, hardly encountered them before. Rhododendrons are about the same so probably they just added some firecrackers? The more the merrier! 
---
My vendors have always reset one hour before daily challenges reset (you can see that timer in the challenge menu)
---
But why do you think the Bethesda app is saying that my system does not meet the requirements if, as you say, it can run well?
---
That was awesome! Thanks!
---
Now the ferns are screaming ‚Äòlook at me I‚Äôm here!!!‚Äô ü§©
---
Can I create a fusion core generator at my camp with the right plans, or do I have to repair Poseidon and use that to generate cores until someone else takes it over? 
---
No squares allowed
---
In a FONV DLC you can encounter the mysterious stranger's son and obtain his pistol. I forget exactly where tho.
---
I agree in some extent. But I don't think its the game people are pissed about if we paint the bigger picture...The whole bag stuff really put a bad spotlight on bethesda (I was even disgused by it) but I like fo76, but I get why people despite it as well. Launched as a buggy experience. I played the beta and I didn't like it back then. They improved it but theres a long way to go for Them. But hey atleast, fo76 are better recieved than anthem.
---
Justthepther day this level 60 something came over to by base with his pack of level 5 players and we just kinda followed the lower levels and helped them with their airport quest
---
At your personal camp, all you need to do is learn the plan and then you can build it. I'm still slightly confused about what you mean about Poseidon 
---
You craft it. It doesn't produce fusion cores. Its basically the one around the world that you can get fusion cores from, except it just powers your camp with alot of power. Takes a few flux to build though.
---
I‚Äôd do 700. Or if you wait a couple days I‚Äôm going to be going crazy trading everything for the parade masks. 
---
Thank you
---
Ohh no sir. Last time I trusted someone to put some gold trim on my armor I ended up in some dark corner of the wilderness. I'm not falling for this again.
---
I personally wouldn‚Äôt mind if they added some songs by Loretta Lynn. Quite a few of her songs would fit in well with the game. Hell, add more classic country and western musicians from that time period. Listening to 16 Tons, as much as I like the song, over and over again, can be a bit of a killjoy.
---
Sounds like you are confusing the power plant quest with the workshop item.   The generator is only for powering your base and this does not require anything else.  The power plant required you attach other generators to it(like windmills) to get it powered and creating the fusion cores.  
---
If you learn the plans you can build it just like every other set of plans you've found so far in the game. The exact materials to build will be in the build menu like any other generator. Good luck!
---
I really only want the mod. I appreciate the offer, though!
---
Awesome topic! Please Bethseda we need some new songs to croon too
---
Yes please  
---
lost my silver lining that way
---
Ooooooooh. It took a little bit of head scratching to understand what you meant but no, you cannot have a fusion core generator at your base. The only ones on the map are at the power plants. 
---
It‚Äôs worse than that :( if you have the same weapon in your inventory it gets fucked up. I‚Äôve got a Vampire‚Äôs 50cal on my hotwheel. I recently picked up a bloodied 50cal, but I haven‚Äôt favorited it. I‚Äôve died several times now because when I hit 5 (should be vampire 50) and start blasting away, expecting it to be healing me up from low health, I die and find out I‚Äôve got the bloodied one equipped. The hell? The hotwheel even shows the vampire‚Äôs name.
---
My fianc√©e had his camp by deathclaw island and it made him move it 
---
I'm on PC so it's probably different, but after doing some digging I notice they're in a new folder.  What's weird is that the game doesn't seem to access anything from that folder. 
---
What bloodied fire axes do you have?
---
4. Jokes aren‚Äôt funny to you
---
If this was in real life i would have to call the authorities 
---
Big iron on his hiiiiip
---
The one person who appreciates a joke. Thanks. 
---
Not sure what server lock means. They can‚Äôt log out? Maybe just have it retrigger every time they server hop until they ride it out? The time could stick instead of starting every time I guess. You want an event but you‚Äôre describing a death sentence IMO.. and maybe it should reward something like a SPECIAL point or a SPECIAL reallocation. I‚Äôm trying to think of something good that isn‚Äôt really exploitable.
---
I fell asleep really quickly on his lounge after I drank his orange juice he gave me though
---
Cross the map claim + kill is a bit low but if lvl 300 comes to your workshop and one shots you then it means you are not strong enought to hold it at that time, end of case.
---
It was never meant to be solvable by one person. It was a community scavenger hunt type puzzle.  We were supposed to all do it together, thousands combing Appalachia for clues. A grand community effort... But alas, that was taken from us.
---
Fuck I‚Äôm definitely getting banned 
---
I agree.  Drinking 50 alcohol beverages for 10 atom is annoying.
---
Orly. Lmao weird. Bah I love that outfit tho. Wore if in fallout 4 with no armor as well. Think it was a ballistic armor tho
---
Word.
---
F...
---
He wants to make fusion cores at his base, is my understanding 
---
Bug.  Switch servers
---
That is what I thought. I should have said can I create a workbench at my camp to generate fusion cores for my power armor.
---
So WHERE can I get the plans? Certain vendors? Or a quest? Or event?
---
I'm not crying you're crying
---
I‚Äôll sell one
---
If they make it extremely rare to spawn a three-star creature, I‚Äôm totally ok with it. Legendary is supposed to be... legendary. But giving the players a three star creature to get their hopes high, making it more difficult to fight, then in the end dropping a one-star cheap item is an outright insult to the players in my book. 
---
Oh dear well I'm certainly not up for explaining this late at nightüòÇ
---
Go to the top left part of the map by the unnumbered vault and there are tons of them. Otherwise I haven‚Äôt seen any in the savage divide. 
---
Yes, exactly
---
You said you have them
---
Congrats on the Paladin paint.  I still only have initiate.  Still farming the tech docs.
---
This gives me hope, because I tried the keycards 3 times and the door never opened. 
---
In all fairness despite it being asked a lot, nobody is forced to respond. If people want to respond it is their choice. If they don't because the question gets asked a lot then that's their choice too.
---
People will continue to ask the question in more weeks/months to come considering they are constantly making the game better from its rocky start and people are wondering if it's worth getting or what it's like now.
---
I was legit just thinking about the guaranteed legendary.  I think if that were the case you'd see a lot more claimed, particularly in the higher level areas.  Which would be great because you could either join in when the defense pops, or try to take it if you're after a little pvp.
---
The only "faction" I've been interested in roleplaying so far. Im still sporting my tattered dress and veil of mysteries 20 levels later. Just wish you could mod the voice of set.... 
---
Just be mindful, the explosion can damage your camp stuff.
---
I've tried to do it between 20 and 23 hours after previous completion. Makes me wait a full 24 hours as far as I can tell.
---
Pretty sure you'd have to pay a "licensing fee" to Rosie after getting her plugged into the airwaves. Don't think she'd give it up for free now. 
---
I'm still waiting for her soothing little voice booming into my ear with a "Hey, hey, hey! Long time no see! Didja miss me? Iiii've gotten myself into a little pickle over here and may need a little help. What d'ya say? I'll even promise not to shoot you in the back on your way out! Deal?"
---
Does not require flux. Does require nuclear material. 
---
Check your bios to see if you have any kind of overclocking. I had the same issue and it was caused by my bios defaulting to a slight overclock and caused the system to be unstable.
---
You can only craft fusion cores at a workbenche and requires stable flux. The generator just powers your base most efficiently
---
This idea could use some fine tuning, but its not a bad idea. Honestly when they initially announced the Wanted system for murders I thought a semi-event route was what they were intending. Instead its a bit too simple and easy to manipulate as it is. 
---
There should be a radio station run by a human NPC who is behind a secure bio barrier and who won‚Äôt broadcast with food and water donations plus daily quests for music holotapes.
---
Same here i just run it over. I normally get the exact era roughly on music and just jam to it.
---
Just wait till you play literally any other videogame
---
Well the team that heads all of the work has limited experience with the creation engine betheda austain used to be battlecry studios
---
Honestly.. even if they'd added tags, we were still robbed of an amazing community experience. This should have taken the entire subreddit weeks to puzzle out /together/ and it's gone. 
---
I get that this franchise attracts alot of folks who are more into shooting things than solving puzzles, but these miners have done a major disservice to those of us who actually enjoy these sorts of puzzles. 
---
If it'd been a normal puzzle, the sort one person is supposed to figure out, it would have been fine. You just don't read the spoiler. But this wasn't a single-person puzzle. You can't solve this by yourself. You /have/ to work with the entire community to figure it out, and that is impossible when the information is already public knowledge.
---
With everybody asking for fishing and expanded farming options, Bethesda should just make a Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon game
---
ok heard there was a recipe for making disease cure 
---
from plants in the savage divide 
---
but sounds like BS maybe 
---
I could be wrong but thought I loaned some to my buddy for his. Maybe that was decontamination shower.
---
My camp is all the way by deathclaw island so this will be a fun challenge 
---
I have a plan called Fusion Generator:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Generator_(Fallout_76)
---
Which I thought generated fusion cores, but it is just a large generator. 
---
I WANT to generate fusion cores...that was the question...
---
My favorite heavy gun is the Gatling. Decent, hard hitting damage and range. Use the regular receiver (not speedy,) and it's frugal with ammo. Bullets are cheap and you can make 180 rounds a crack with ammosmith perk.
---
That's not the intent.  It's an apocalyptic wasteland, not a cotton candy snuggle hugfest.
---
Yes decontam shower does require flux. 
---
It isn't unique to the game engine.  Any game that introduces patches can create bugs that don't show up during testing.  Moreso in an online environment. 
---
You killed his mutant hound and he just.. gave up...
---
Yup, brewing is permanent, fasnacht event is limited time starting on the 19th, going for a week I believe!
---
So...only power plants can generate fusion cores? There is no plan to build a fusion core machine to generate fusion cores at my CAMP?
---
I‚Äôm not sure I can check when I get home and I probably have an extra if it is a thing I could give you if your on xbox. 
---
You literally described the daughter. 
---
Didn‚Äôt know about the level 150 thing but it‚Äôs not that rare to come across shocks and jetpacks. I‚Äôve been trying to find a reactive plate though and have never seen one before. 
---
Oh, I'm totally looking forward to the parades, just not the masks. Masks are just so creepy, and I say that as someone who teams with several guys who wear wear them in game. Weirdos. 
---
Same happened here actually.   It was as if the game knew I was done and threw me a bone lol
---
I got murdered after claiming a workshop earlier. Didn‚Äôt know this was thing but I certainly won‚Äôt be claiming another one soon.
---
Whitespring manager's office computer
---
I would be willing to pay for a dlc that gave you a quest to raid an old abandoned radio and salvage their music collection to load into the radio tagts playing. So that you get extra songs, they charge could help pay fot subsidiaries for said songs. 
---
While inserting old timey radio adds not real adds but for breaking up the music. 
---
Maybe a bit of spotify and include adds for real stuff to earn extra income not against it. 
---
I would like a clean mesh overlay of spotify into fallout, where my pip boy would manage the spotify for me to an extent but that may break the atmosphere, or cause problems. 
---
Right. The only thing "fusion generator" produces is power for your CAMP. The "fusion core extractor" is *ONLY* found at the 3 power plant workshops on the map. 
---
Yea i get it, but still, there were zero clues, literally, between the Marketing Password Holotape and the next place to go to...random places to find aren‚Äôt engaging. At least put a puzzle in or something
---
I believe that it may be CHR that increases the drop rate of rare items during events? When you get the time could you tell me that info? Thanks fam.
---
Since you can‚Äôt understand let me try explaining again I‚Äôm not worried about the explosion doing dmg to me it‚Äôs when it rag dolls the mob out of reach or glitches it into disappearing. I do understand game mechs.
---
More potential players for a game seems like a good thing too me!
---
Correct. However you *can* craft fusion cores at a workbench but it requires rare materials. 
---
There needs to be more information displayed as well, to be honest. Like the workshop owner's level in general, because attacking a guy who owns a workshop while they are less than lvl 50 is almost always a waste of time if you're not interested in the workshop's resources but the junk/cap reward you *could* get if you kill them.
---
With Zeal
---
Be really nice if you could play your spotify throufh al oud speaker at your camp
---
Well , can you ferment something already fermented ?
---
lol 
---
I‚Äôll add that 
---
Sounds like some good ideas but I think for the time being the survival mode will have to suffice. 
---
It's all a Vault-Tec experiment to see how we deal with insanity. All the baddies are also immortal teleporters. I've seen them appear in front of me like it's bloody Star Trek.
---
Did we ever find out what happened to Shannon's husband? 
---
  If it was in the quest I missed it but I had a messenger quest lead me to riverside manor and spoiler alert the robot said "your husband was killed in a work accident. Please return any company property" 
---
Indeed I love all the backstories, but hate that I cannot read half the lore in the game.
---
For sure. Sorry- I was fiddling with my mic and forgot to set it to area chat. Anyway, glad you got the mod you‚Äôre after and if I find more I‚Äôll let you know :)
---
I tamed a rabbit at whitesprings it finally shows up at my base i run over to say hi he runs off into a damb firecracker berry bush and dies lol
---
Yes!!!!! 
---
Do u mean the flooded trainyard? 
---
Hmmm...so if you want fusion cores you have to redo the event every time. That‚Äôs kind of a bummer. 
---
Well that's only possible by taking the power plant work shops 
---
Its something. 
---
I can‚Äôt imagine any circumstance where it would be beneficial 
---
Not a problem at all! Only second time buying from a player and both have been super positive experiences!
---
Heyyyy we're already friends. I'll keep an eye out if you still need them.
---
üé∂ TO THE PLACEüé∂
---
Should you come across another, keep me in mind!
---
Yes. What else would it be?
---
He‚Äôs wondering when he‚Äôll become a legendary. 
---
I wish I was more than a no life chimp. I'd give you gold for this suggestion. But, life can be cruel to the unlucky.
---
Oh. Maybe thats why i got disconnected from gta so much. Well, i will try that, thanks
---
I think that would be "Spoiled Nukashine" or "Vinegar"
---
There's a bunch at Solomon's Pond
---
5. A requisite for a joke being funny is for it to actually be a good joke, bby
---
Fucking faggot
---
Now 3 ? 
---
Can confirm, I got the Greek letter plan and the mountain honey moonshine recipe after doing a quest for Biv after Nukashine
---
Yeah, that what I used to do before I got my third and fourth set. 
---
Ok, awesome to hear!
---
And straight jackets!
---
Yeah number 3 now then will be switching servers and doing another 3 dude 
---
the daughter went drunk on power and wanted to be a raider. What im talking about is putting the ressources and abilities of this "order" to a good use, neither for selfish raiding or hero purposes, nor simple killing but more for creating a new society where people get some form of basic training from skillfull people so that more survive in the end instead of superhero wannabes that may kill dangerous people, but in the end still dont truly change anything. They just get rid of the daily foe until the next one steps up. It doenst do shit. Its basically just grinding.
---
Boiled water is super easy to obtain, but you'll need some wood and will get some rads.
---
1. Install a hand pump well (or find one)
---
2. Drink from it
---
3. Spam the collect button really fast. You should get several each time.
---
4. Boil the water at a cooking station
---
95% of people are great in this game. I‚Äôve been bored lately so I craft sweet level 5 shotguns and ammo. Drop them to any under level 5 players I see. Keeps the game interesting.
---
30
---
Abandoned Bog Town workshop has a few bags as well as concrete nodes.
---
Take 30 circuits with you. Hacker 3 and Lockpick 3.  Pick and hack will allow you to skip the reactor part which is... slower and time consuming solo. Look for the level 3 door in the reactor room. Circuits are for the next area. You may need them, may not.
---
This is way easier solo. My first couple we went in pairs, then i gathered the courage to try solo. Unless I'm carrying someone now and showing them how to do everything, solo is the only way i go in ever.
---
Thats almost word for word what her motivation is! 
---
I came here to say this. 
---
Yeah, 12 minutes she went down
---
I think a big part of this problem is people don't understand what it means to be a raider. Raiders steal and prey off others. This does not mean go and destroy other people's stuff. The Raiders would actually profit more from everyone else having better stuff, more food growing better scrap to collect. The only time the raider faction in game ever just destroyed anything is when david thought the responders killed his girlfriend. 
---
If you wanted to role play as Raiders you would have to survive off stealing/killing. The point is Raiders dont want to do any hard work like farming. Gathing scrap or purifying water. As players dont drop anything but junk you cant really rp a raider properly. All you are foing by destroing bases, even you you aren't using up weapons, is role playing as a psychopathic idiot that wants to see everyone fail. If the raiders had burned the farms rather than just stealing the crops they would have starved too. 
---
Because Bethesda put mechanics in place to prevent greifing thus mking it so pkayers cant lose their good stuff as well as making farming/survival very easy you really cant be a raider at all.  All you can really do is make the game less fun for everyone else without actually gaining anything. 
---
I think that was the main game, wasn't he part of that talent scout quest? 
---
Non-auto pistols are certainly very viable, but they're absolutely inferior to non-auto rifles in nearly every way. They pretty much only work with crit builds. You can one-shot most enemies with a revolver crit to the head. Blackpowder pistol crits from stealth will one-shot deathclaws, yao guai, fog crawlers, etc... Instigating revolvers can do work on lower tier fodder enemies as it one-shots ghouls, scorched, and standard mirelurks on headshots. 
---
But they're all outclassed by rifles. I would've expected pistols to have lower AP costs compared to rifles, but the cost difference is either minor or non-existent. Non-auto rifle crit builds even get access to The Dragon. You might be able to one-shot a scorchbeast with just an instigating Dragon stealth crit.
---
There is actually a way to walk/run/climb up the North peak without having to have either jet pack or marsupial.
---
Improper QA
---
No public test servers
---
Can I get the two shot handmade. That would be amazing 
---
Sure you will have tried this, but try starting a new character to see if it at least loads. Seems a really weird one. 
---
From the watoga station run south and get in the water there is loads down there
---
But is his pistol the Voice of Set? I‚Äôm still confused on how that makes us the Mysterious Strangers
---
No her motivation is more using the skills and powers for her own good and not for that of others. Thats the entire point. She wants to be a raider, maybe even possibly be the big boss and order the innocent people around based on her being more powerful than them.
---
What Im talking about is using all the asses the order had as well as the skills of its members for the actual greater good.
---
Correct, and finding them around the world. I had like 15 to 20 saved up by the time I got my first PA at around lvl 20
---
Enclave events don't usually count toward event challenges. Better skip those if going for challenges.
---
NUKACRYPT.COM and Keycards are all you need.
---
Just hold onto it, it'll self destruct on Monday. They're used to decipher the launch codes on nukes, you will collect them often.
---
Nothing. Just enjoy the game. (:
---
You‚Äôll know when you have to worry about that kinda stuff.
---
I‚Äôd LOVE to play it like the Free For All mode in COD. That will make it a real survival game mixed with pve elements. However, the way Bethesda currently set it up, you need to empty your account in order to avoid losing caps, because Bethesda let players rob each other instead of rewarding the better player with caps from the system. This mechanism essentially encourages the penniless to rob those who take good care of their balances.  Because they let you attack others freely when you have zero caps.  So essentially you have to gang up with someone and transfer caps back and forth between the two. This is cumbersome and ridiculous, only good for those who have too much time on their hands. 
---
This should be an actual drink in the game that increases your chance of encountering a mothman while under the effects of it, or give you night vision or something.
---
Awwww. 
---
Would you rather no one told you how to get the Quantum paint job and instead sold it to you for 1000's of caps? It is already happening with players server hopping to get multiple copies and hoard them for themselves to make caps off them.
---
I have an extra if anyone needs it, and if it can be given away. On PS4 
---
Got one from enclave early days, not seen another or any calibrated shocks ever. Should be be able to get one from market for around 2k 
---
Console or pc?
---
Ive found the fastest way to grab dirty water imo is to spam the pickup button in a body of water. Theres no animation like the pump. It just gathers to your inventory. 
---
Also, use super duper 3 while boiling it!
---
If you already own the game and want to give it another go you don't need strangers on the internet to make up your mind for you. Also Bethesda has released patch notes for all the updates, you can read about what changed and what's coming in the future for yourself.
---
damn. i had no idea. guess i gotta go next time
---
Really? That's extremely weird. I can't imagine that's intentional 
---
That's where i am too. I'm about 50/50 on whether my camp gets placed or not. I want to move but it's such a damn good spot.
---
What I do is put on Spotify in the background and listen to "50s hits" or "Rockabilly mania", then go into system settings and turn the music down enough where I can hear the game.  Whole new experience.
---
Considering how long the game has been out I think it‚Äôs reasonable that someone might be bored or feel like they have completed everything if they have played for almost 1000 hours, just saying. 
---
I think you play fairly above the average. So you may need to expect to wait for more content than the average player too. 
---
Your lack of worship of best waifu MODUS disturbs me.
---
Don't wanna be that guy but among more reasons why 76 is criticized over lore
---
Vault was fine. Came out.. ran for 10 secs and fell through
---
There actually always was.  But it was not accessible.  If you had the Fortune Finder on then you could here it.  I guess when they started to update the tattoo exterior they relived the glitch.
---
Same here, I don't think it works 
---
And 2-3 more close by. One in a bus nearby. And one in the largest tent in the tent area. 
---
One on top of a tall building with a climber poet (havent checked this in a long time so not sure if it's still up there).
---
Are you saying that only high level characters have the right to play this game?
---
As Warhammers orcs may say : Its not easy being green ...
---
Nice! Didn't get shit from that queen so far, but what u guys are doing is awsome! Karma from me! 
---
Yup - that one's pretty epic! Gamertag: Rocket Radcoon 
---
I'm not advocating it's good but I'm willing to give my 3* to u if U still want it as I'd like at least to try it 
---
It's kinda funny how many high level players want to 'adopt' new players, my main is in the early 90's so I started an alt for PVP and storing my unwanted legendaries  and like four tried and I had to message them all going 'thank you for the help but this is my alt'. I'll occasionally rock up to new players and drop them stuff or just spam drop the government drops on flatwoods. 
---
Thanks for shopping! Hope you enjoy the new bloodied's! 
---
I just had my first server disconnect in weeks. Also nothing really resets after a disconnect, occasionally you'll have to do a quest checkpoint again, and you lose any workshop you had, but everything you've collected, all XP and loot and everything else will be exactly where it left off.
---
Thanks bro. Dropping another one on her in a few mines just waiting on launch prep 
---
I'm a healthy balance of both. I have identical Sharp Furious Heated Sledgehammers for silo runs and mobs, a tse 3* armor piercing handmade for ranged kills and turrets and a 2* tse combat shotty for splash and mass extermination at closer range.
---
Im not doing max damage by any means, but i have absolutely no problem taking on a few level 80 scorch beasts.
---
Lucky to be you then
---
Console 
---
Which is why im letting Bethesda know. That there is a bracket of their player base that is getting to the end and fairly quickly. Something easy to setup such as a hardcore server could keep us going for 100's of more hours. 
---
No, only characters strong enought have the final say when and what workshop they want to own.
---
I accidentally scrapped the dress before I could finish augmenting / upgrading it.  It's a shame bethesda can't fix the litttle things.
---
Also you can loot ton of those off supermutants, typically 101 rounds but some carry 501 rounds. 
---
Hmm, I‚Äôve not had issues. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. 
---
I did get a frozen screen at the SBQ, but I think that‚Äôs because there were a ton of people. 
---
7 I think? A floor for trading, crafting, cooking and dining, music room, bedroom and lounge... ok I'm forgetting one... and the top is a sun catching area with a lookout and sirens.
---
Basically it's all weight perks under maxed-out strength (e.g. strong back, bandolier, martial artist, traveling pharm) plus batteries included under intelligence and thru hiker under agility plus deep pocketed on all armor. The real key though for me is in the legendary armor - I've been at this a while and have managed to collect 4 pieces that each reduce weapon weights by 20%, so that's why I vend mostly weapons, because I can carry tons without being encumbered! So it depends on what you want to vend, but there is weight reducing armor for other categories of stuff too (junk, food/chems, etc...).
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty random, was by where the chest is and the boss enemy 
---
Ok I‚Äôll join right now 
---
I'll do it for 20 caps each don't let this scammer fool you
---
Nuka grape is a very strong rad remover. There also Nuka Orange, Nuka Wild, and Nuka Dark (Which is Alcohol and thus falls under Partyboy and Cola Nut)
---
This was it!  Thank you so much.
---
I'd prefer it if they would just change it so any recipe that calls for boiled water can also use purified water. 
---
You'll want melee then, but that was always the case even before the nerf. TSE is still good and viable, and provides way better DPS then melee. Don't just look at the damage when assessing a weapon, look at all the stats. A Bloodied Explosive .50 Cal, perked correctly will annihilate anything that gets in front of it before a melee has a chance to swing their weapon.
---
Game becomes less of a grind and much more enjoyable around lvl 40-50 when you have the perks and gear to survive. Personally I did not leave the forest before lvl 60 and now I am lvl 170 and have done maby 1% of main quests
---
Being able to recharge fusion cores in our fusion generators. 
---
Vendor cap update. 200 caps a day, gimme a break. 
---
More reliable legendaries. If I kill a 3\*SQB I should get something better than a level 5 nocturnal wooden leg. 
---
Companion animals/robots. 
---
Nothing was taken from us. That Tanagra town keycard would probably have never been found by any player. It's underneath a junk item on a tiny little ledge that no one would ever bother to jump up to.
---
That‚Äôs really decent, do you have all the heavy gunner perks maxed out? Mine is a bloodied explosive so theoretically the damage could be even higher if my health is low enough. 
---
Ok, I just saw the thing that looked like a switch on the upper left hand side, that doesn't switch.  :)  I'll have a look later tonight when I get on.
---
Ooh, like a Spotify subscription, but an in-game, context-appropriate version. Tune-Boy or some-such. Sure, I'd pay a little for something like that. Win-win, they get a regular micro-transaction from me and I get some extra tunes and immersion... though, idk what it costs to license well-known music like that, it might be astronomically expensive.
---
Trivial to suggest a quality of life improvement. Ok. Noted
---
i think its the tattoo parlor
---
Absolutely astonishes me that there is no testing server. Have thousands of players play a week or two pre update and fix things before they go live. This game wouldnt get half as much crap from people if they tested before releasing. 
---
On the fusion core thing, let us save old cores and recharge those, too. Why are we tossing empty cores? Makes no sense. 
---
flatwoods by the greenhouses there are two pools. There are 3 plants in one and one in the other so with green perk can get 8 total here. 
---
Looking at it again, locking to a server is probably unnecessary. They‚Äôre automatically losing if they server hop, which should be incentive enough to stay and try to win. 
---
Er... Take what?
---
There is a disease cure recipe for the Savage Divide but it's different ingredients than the one from the Forest. Firecaps only grow in the Forest area.
---
 Ery nice write up. Thank you for this and you are spot on. At the current rate casual and honest gamers will never have a chance at top tier pvp. Pvp is and will remain broken. 
---
With increased be efits of survival mode Beth has just ensured dupers will benefit the most. They should have wiped all the popular duped items down to zero i stead of 1.
---
Hey man, I managed to get one in the end! Thanks anyway I really appreciate the generous offer :) 
---
It‚Äôs definitely in need of fine tuning, and probably a few swift kicks, but I thought it might be fun to throw the idea out there. 
---
That did it. Dropped perks and stored guns. Everything back to normal. 
---
If it's near the Overseers camp you can just drop it in her stash, or in the toolbox.
---
Well it‚Äôs about a 19gb update for me to check it out and I‚Äôm limited monthly so I figured I would come to a discussion board about the game to you know...discuss it. Thanks though!
---
Then they shouldn't make owning workshops part of the daily/weekly challenges. Personally, I get one for a challenge, and then hop servers. I have zero interest in this PvP dick measuring behavior.

You do not have to redo the event. You just have to take the nearby workshop and build your newly learned fusion generator to power the fusion core extractor. You do not even need the generator if someone has done the "Powering Up  Whatever." It makes a fusion core every 5 minutes. 
---
For a while I had a cult compound on the hillsides of Helvetia, after that I lived in the tunnels of the Somme (Cranberry Bog), Tried to have a home bordering Vietnam (Mire) and the Somme, and as of now I'm living happily in a hunting lodge in the woods. Feel free to stop in and stock up on your travels fellow Xbox users, play our banjo, brew moonshine out back, and get disappointed the the astronomical lack of literally any wildlife in the area!
---
You can have someone else look in the bag, that'll keep it around for a while even after you log off. 
---
 Also if you don't have anyone around to look in the bag for you, you can use 'world containers'... I have a first aid kit at my camp that was there when I moved there. That's a world container. I can leave unlimited stuff in it and it will be there until the server resets.
---
Some world containers have weight limits, some are unlimited. 
---
AFAIK those are your only options. 
---
I love building fusion generators for low levels that have five or six generators 
---
thanks but i'm on pc 
---
Thanks for this! 
---
March 26th sounds like something close to what you are looking forward to is coming out. I‚Äôm looking forward to the higher stakes survival, but I really dislike that you can switch characters between casual and hardcore. It‚Äôs going to cause a lot of imbalance, and people will just run away from survival mode back to casual when things start to get tough. Defeats the whole purpose. 
---
I play mostly solo. But I‚Äôm always open to some organic multiplayer experiences. I really look forward to the time that this game actually encourages and facilitates better player interactions.
---
I thought if you claimed a workshop and left, no matter where you were in the world, you are automatically open to PvP. So if I grabbed Grafton steel and went to whitesprings, someone there could kill me immediately without the slap mechanic. 
---
Or how about link your Spotify subscription, and they play only context-appropriate playlists
---
Nuka Orape
---
But IMO the best camps go to the guy who keeps trying to kill low level players with ovens and death mazes, and the guy who built a pyramid. Shame Bethesda patched that though
---
Fun as fuck dude, just recently started playing myself and when I played last time the hit detection was off heaps like you‚Äôd shoot something then couple of seconds later the enemy would get hit. Now it‚Äôs seamless, looting is awesome, base building is slick and world building and atmosphere is second to none.
---
What are you doing tho?... PvE, PvP? Grinding mobs, SBQ focus? Solo build? Team build?
---
No build should be defined by your weapon. You can no longer crutch yourself on a single weapon. You need a comprehensive build. Thats why TSE was nerfed. 
---
You used to be able to rely soley on a TSE. If thats what your looking for get a + 40%Swing Speed bloody deathclaw gauntlet, adrenal reaction and run around naked. You will be fine. Dont even get perks. Max out wood chucker. 
---
Plenty of ranged builds are still in a good place. Bloody and Anti Armor explosive weapons are in a good place. 
---
Id go with a bloody ranged build close to what you were using when you stopped playing. It would be the easist switch, and probably the build you *want* to play. What do you want to do? You dont wanna chase whatever is meta on the most recent patches do you?
---
Lots of things are relevant and competative. Id argue the #1 very top tier build is a ranged build for PvP. Its not even melee. Melee is #2.  (Specifically unarmed).
---
So what were you doing? What do you want to do with your time in game? And what kind of build do you want to play?
---
Wait how did you get the station flame color?
---
Thanks skizzunky! I‚Äôm good I drank all the wine I could until I fell over and woke up next to a death claw. 
---
I like the idea of using a world container, there‚Äôs a chest I can use so I‚Äôll probably do that. Thanks for your help :)
---
100 dollar caps you say? 
---
I saw X-01 Reactive Plate there yesterday, I'm lvl 101. 
---
Is that a good torso Mod?  I normally go for the +2 strength instead.  What if a player hits me attempting PVP?  Do the reactive plates automatically reflect his attack back and initiate PVP?
---
It's a bug that was introduced in the last patch. Bethesda has been made aware of it . 
---
Blackwater Mine, one on the ground by a metal drum near the steel building covering the mine entrance, and another can similarly be found on the ground by another identical barrel, this one with a yellow floodlight atop it, beside two open dumpsters behind the building containing the power armor workstation and weapons workbench.
---
West Tek Research Center, in the green trailer at the entrance to the front area guarded by super mutants.
---
2x General's Steakhouse. One bottom floor, Northeast corner, on a metal desk. Another behind the main cashier's counter, through a door with "coat check" on a small plack above it. The stash is directly through the door on a metal shelf.
---
Dyer Chemical, in the brick reception building in the main parking lot. A small office inside contains some writing on the walls and a trail of caps leading to a cap stash in the corner on a bear trap!
---
Appalachain Antiques, upstairs by the fancy bed, in the small shelf between the bed and railing.
---
The basement drug lab beneath the Palace of the Winding Path, near a chemistry workbench on a stack of blue steel drums. You can get to it easily by hacking the terminal in the small rock cave out back of the Palace at the end of the road that runs along the Palace's Eastern side.
---
A second stash in the Palace can be found by entering the temple through a side door which is up the hill from the small cave mentioned in the above stash location guide. Directly to your left upon entering is a door labeled "Employees Only". Pass through it and follow the hallway strait ahead all the way to a gilded staircase that leads downwards. Beside the staircase on it's left side is a set of steel lockers. The stash spawns atop them.
---
Inside the red train car with open sides right near Grafton Station (towards town). Do the Grafton Day event real quick + kill/loot the Grafton Monster for another \~40 caps. This is a great spot.
---
Above the Clarksburg gun shop (Last red brick building on the South-eastern end of town), there is a higher level only reachable by a fire escape. At the top of the fire escape is a single room with a green loot trunk. The stash can spawn on some boxy metal ventilation duct work overhead in front of the entrance to the room.
---
\^Also in Clarksburg, at the exact opposite end of town on the opposite side of main street, is a hardware store. The stash is not in the building, but on the lower far Western roof (Above the "Employees Only" door) beside a green water tank with a teddy bear holding a teacup sitting atop it. This stash will require a jet pack, the Marsupial mutation, or some very creative climbing to reach.
---
And finally: Poseidon Energy. 2 in the little protest camp by the dry riverbed, one on a barrel against a big tree, the other in the easternmost tent with the red couch inside, under a small wooden coffee table by a mattress. An average of \~4 more scattered various places on the roof, one on some metal boxes by a forklift carrying a red metal crate on the ground in the parking lot area. Marsupial mutation or jetpack power armor recommended/required. 3 can also spawn inside the cooling towers in the scaffolding, but the steam will kill you quick if the plant is active. Don't forget to kill the Grafton Monster that spawns in the dry riverbed by the power plant for around 20 caps to cover your travel expenses. ; )
---
**That's all for now!**
---
These are personally verified by myself to be working AFTER the last patch AND hotfix. I will add more as I find them.
---
So how'd you get the code?
---
crap, i just realized that i will most likely accidentally sell/trade/scrap my legendary gear (that i intended to keep) when the new legendary trader is released...
---
There's been a few times where people appear to have left gifts for me, but I wasn't sure.  One time it was right at my camp so I figured it was a safe bet, but once it was at one of the trading posts and I was like "I better leave it alone, in case it's for someone else".
---
Thanks for the help :).
---
The easy way is taking over the workshops at the power plants. The hard way is farming all the flux and ingredients needed to craft them. Or you can always go to locations where you find a fusion generator and hope you find a core in it, but they'll mostly be at 50%
---
How long until it ferments?
---
I disagree with a lot of this. One of the strongest I‚Äôve ever seen in PvP; and I can tell you, sentinel is very very very very overrated 
---
Well, you don't have to. I've got X-01 and T-51 already, so I don't need the sets, and I'm not looking to gain anything out of this. If you look through my comment history, I like doing things for people. It's your prerogative, but don't make it sound like I'm trying to screw people.
---
Okay yes i can see that red circle and I've been saring at this thing's ass for a solid minute and i give up.
---
What is it about him am i supposed to be noticing?
---
10X might be too high. It‚Äôs a simple number for conversation. A flat bounty could be a good way to go, but 10X a level isn‚Äôt that crazy. A level 100 would get a 1k bounty for example. 
---
I agree that something would need to be done to prevent bankrupt players from triggering. That would require a change in the wanted mechanics as a whole, which isn‚Äôt impossible and should be done anyway. 
---
Enjoy!
---
One day Atom shop thing a while back when they did the Hot Rod PA skin.
---
or stand in a damn lake and spam collect.
---
You should be able to get away with ultra settings. It's a good-looking game, but they're not exactly bleeding edge graphics.
---
That's fucking amazing 
---
There's a regular Nuka Cola skin for the T-51 set.
---
Strongest at what? Randos on a regular server? I bet you get eaten alive in Survival
---
And then some dude rolls up on your CAMP which you worked so hard on, drops a few orbital strikes and you're back to square-one grinding nuke zones to fix your base. It was enjoyable for a minute.
---
If it's in your build area put some letters on it or near it saying 'free stuff' 
---
Shit, i wanted that
---
I don't know why the app say so. My system also do not meet the official requirements, but the 1050ti 4gb can handle the game well at medium settings. I got half the frame rate at high/ultra settings, so I switched back. I also use a program that turns off all unnecessary background system activities (google for Razor)
---
I play for nearly 400 hours now, mostly on laptop and got only some lags in heavy crowded nuke zones.
---
üé∂ WHERE I BELONGüé∂

Todd Howard stated that ‚Äò‚ÄôIt just works‚Äô‚Äô
---
We‚Äôre u the one I brought the mutations from?
---
Me and my team just did this! We took some pictures in the bar naked and played music. After this all three of us got drunk and we tried to reach two low level players bevor blacking out (but we didn`t). One spawned at flatwoods, one at the little street base in cranberry bog and myself spawned near a cliff with a rope, to walk over to the other side. We had a lot of fun talking "drunk" to each other :D !!! 10/10
