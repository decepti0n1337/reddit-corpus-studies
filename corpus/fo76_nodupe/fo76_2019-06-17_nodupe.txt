I scrip bloodied and only have one 2 shot.

---
OTOH, I do like my vampire switchblade...and its buddy,  Vampire Gatling Plasma....
---
---
---
I'm not upset??? Huh???
---
lol wait, we're the good guys? oh oh oh yeah right, something something freedom
---
Yep lvl 300 now and nothing really to do now, went to try nuclear winter and that wasnt so bad but without a steady team you are doomed with the fools you get assigned too....
---
Ah dang it!
---
Well hey I really appreciate the offer anyways!! I'm sure there's a PS4 player out there who will love it! Seriously. I appreciate the thought!
---
The Sheepquatch Assaultron Head is not a skin.  It is a separate crafting item, so your Quad Assaultron Head still has no skin.  I believe the same problem exists for the Invader atom shop item.
---
People can buy from unpowered machines.
---
Team members can edit your camp
---
I will fight with the brotherhood I will die with the brotherhood
---
Sorry your rant, insults and aggressive language confused me
---
Yes, you will.
---
I try to get junk when I have too many caps.
---
I tried doing the same, I even wanted to collect the specimen jars with scorched parts inside, but I‚Äôd always accidentally scrap them all. Yes I absolutely wish there was an option to favourite junk items.
---
Huh what insults? And what's a ran?? And what aggressive language??? I'm so confused lol
---
I blast them from far away... they are dangerous
---
What was the invader supposed to cover?
---
East of National Radio Astronomy Research Center and north of Kerwood Mine there is a rock arch on a cliff side that has amazing views over the bog. Had my camp setup there for a while, you should definitely check it out.
---
Yes but I‚Äôve never seen text got etched in the wall, those small letters only go on the surface, right?
---
If you were PC I'd join you, but le sigh, no cross-play for FO76
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty worth gauss mini gun is good as well if you‚Äôre a heavy gunner
---
Oh nice, I have to visit than, ill look for it shoot one for you. Thanks
---
Ha ha excellent I should probably rename it as that! "Fleetwood Mac encounter" brilliant :-D
---
Idk about that I‚Äôve never seen one in many hours. Could it have been the tracer thing lagging or something?
---
I dont work for bethesda but that's one of my favorites when someone has a differnt view.  You said you hadn't given them money since paid mods so you got the game for free?  This is just so small potatoes compared to corporations are doing I find bitching about it a waste of time..
---
[removed]
---
Which one gives that.  Settlers or Raiders?
---
And ‚ÄúAppalachia was our home, we actually lived here first‚Äù is enough of a reason in itself for me to side with the raiders in this case.
---
'Ey man yougotaknow I don' got like... Y'know...
---
Honestly I can't write Boomhauer properly, all I can do is summarize it with *Illegible Boomhauer Gibberish*
---
I also wish to share that King of the Hill so far is the most enjoyable cartoon that I am watching at present.
---
I stared at it for about 5 seconds in disbelief and then scrapped the letters.  I‚Äôm in Vancouver. That word isn‚Äôt heard here ever. I have accepted team invites. Can they do it? It was in the wall I think so I‚Äôm now going to take camp down completely now.
---
Oo nice.  I loved that display case but was disappointed it wasn't functional.  This will look good.
---
RNG sucks when it doesn't work in our favor but feels like winning the lotto when it does. I've been rolling legendary scrips since it came out max scripping every day and have only gotten one "god tier" weapon.
---
What sucks is these new weapons is locked into the player... No trading. That's the big blow.
---
Wow. Level 191 and didn‚Äôt know that.
---
It‚Äôd probably be simpler to add an in game auction house like most mmos
---
I wish this was true lol
---
Gives you high highs and low lows. It‚Äôs a unique experience
---
PC or console?
---
In hindsight the letters were probably visible and I didn‚Äôt notice them until highlighted.  My bad
---
That helped a lot! Much appreciated üëçüèª
---
I maxed them both equally with a slight lag with raiders by only a day. I only did the dailies for each faction, photo opportunity to favor rep toward foundation and the mirelurk daily for raider.
---
You won't get banned for 160 large presents. No one cares. Enjoy!
---
Uuuhhh like an actual live baby deathclaw or taxidermy?
---
*If taxidermy then*
---
***NO***
---
Don't craft repeatedly on the same server. Mmurgh is the same way. Certain servers seem to favor certain mods.
---
Yup friend bought the game for me as he wanted people to play with. And so what? That's like saying complaining about plastic straws is a waste of time because that's such a small thing? Every little bit helps? The less corporate greed companies get away with even within something as meaningless as the game industry the better? Shit if everyone took your attitude video games would be nothing but lootboxes and casino machines like they were on course for prior to the Battlefront 2 revolt.
---
Turns out it's a modded weapon. I did some researching and found someone selling it on Ebay.  [https://www.ebay.ca/itm/Fallout-76-PC-Bloodied-Explosive-25-Vats-Handmade-QUEEN-KILLER/224040295880?hash=item3429d79dc8:g:Gm8AAOSwh-Je4Chv](https://www.ebay.ca/itm/Fallout-76-PC-Bloodied-Explosive-25-Vats-Handmade-QUEEN-KILLER/224040295880?hash=item3429d79dc8:g:Gm8AAOSwh-Je4Chv)

---
That's mine. Evolved a little for stealth, which is really powerful. I flip between commando and rifleman.
---
I'd take out a couple of qol perks like travelling pharmacy - just get the chemist backpack mod from raiders.
---
untill you learn to shoot them in the legs with anything and its free exp.
---
I would think Bethesda is more concerned with large quantities like 10k. If someone says they were banned after picking a bag up full of x duped product they are usually lying and we're duping. Enjoy the find!
---
turns outs it's a modded gun
---
Yeah, But we can get them and they suck
---
Still waiting for them to fix the gold paint skin for the handmade.
---
Well they're supposed to be high lighting stuff on June 18th at the IGN summer of gaming event, so? Maybe by next week we'll start getting new content like meat week and 'colossal problem'? Idk, the delays are a bit concerning, like, did you hire a monkey as their project manager or something?
---
Well I'm sure they appreciated your friends money and your player count.  I know little guy is gonna rise up and take the world back.  Let me know when you get them to fix everything you find to be wrong with that game.  Peace be with you my friend.
---
Vats can be useful on a 50cal to quickly switch your aim from one enemy to another, especially when there is limited visibility like in a nuke zone or with noisy flying bats. What I do is use vats, fire a short burst then immediately push aim and start unloading.
---
That's true and doesn't make sense
---
Ah I see. I ran into a player with a Fatman that spammed mini nukes like a machine gun... Odd weapons do exist but I'd think mainly on PC.
---
I‚Äôve tried the hopping server method and it never works for me lol.
---
It must be really nice to find some one like you, I bought the game on Friday but I just have been able to play for a couple of hours, I think I am at level 7.
---
For now it has been a nice experience I have enjoyed the game but I wish I could find some one to play with, I feel the game is much more enjoyable this way, talking with someone doing missions and what not.
---
Unfortunately I haven't found someone who would play with me, is either that or the fact that I have been to shy to even invite some level 50+ (players I have meet) with a rookie like me lol.
---
No way bethesda could add that, their no where near competent enough
---
I‚Äôm hoping soon. I‚Äôm assuming a delay is due to the community outcry against the legendary perk system. At least they‚Äôre going to take a second look at it but who knows if it improves
---
Also vats headshots on a primed Gatling gun = heavy weapons rifle. Great for clearing out mobs while conserving ammo.
---
Ooo that would be dope!
---
Gimme gimme
---
That's also a hacked weapon, pc only thankfully
---
What a shite analogy. Car companies do not manufacture phones, drinks or women they are understood as being part of the aspirational lifestyle with the vehicle. Where as where do you purchase you FO76 items from if not the Bethesda atom shop? 
---
As Bethesda &amp; only Bethesda sell items like these for atoms which in turn can be purchased for real money then there may be a case. If someone could reasonably have bought atoms in response to advertisement images including items that are not available &amp; there is no disclaimer then yes there could be a case.
---
Yea :(
---
You're welcome.  I am happy I could help.  :)
---
When some twat says they have a "modded gun" what they actually mean is they're too much of a wuss to admit to hacking.
---
Your not wrong, but at least this is a fuckup in the players favor for a change.
---
That's not how any containers work, not sure what you're complaining about. 
---
No one else can "loot" your containers.
---
It‚Äôs quest that gives you a random location to clear out. Another player can clear it for you and you get the rewards
---
James Brown disapproves of this post.   Awwwwwww man.
---
Yea definitely hacked. I've seen some crazy stuff here.
---
You need to quit.
---
They should but I bet this spaghetti code can‚Äôt handle separating it out.
---
I know what he means. However it‚Äôs not someone taking the loot but it‚Äôs just the game not loading loot in the crates
---
Edit: I meant to put it‚Äôs not someone
---
Yeah and this kind of behavior show mentality of pvp community. They cheese the game as much as they can to grief and they go reeeee when Bethesda do something about it. I can't imagine the amount of pvper rant and riot when Bethesda decides to delete all hacked weapons. They gonna try and sue Bethesda I'm not joking. It's all about cheesing no skills
---
If you have looted a spot recently and too often and return (I forget the reset time), place will be empty. I didn‚Äôt know this initially and thought it was a player doing it. But if you‚Äôve never been to location, player might have been there recently, and monsters reset before loot does. Bad timing, and also definitely lame.
---
Heals you and nearby teammates. Pretty rare plan, seen it at a few vendors for 5-8K. Pretty useful if you don‚Äôt play solo.
---
If you're on xbox PM me with your gamer tag and I can hook you up with a couple cobalt.
---
With great difficulty or pay out the butt at whitesprings, then farm nuke zones, then craft.
---
Well, it‚Äôs a pita, let‚Äôs be honest.
---
No it isn‚Äôt.
---
&gt; Hacking max rank, lock pick max rank.
---
Definitely, made my silo run so much easier. Disabling all turrets, picklocking and hacking my way through made it easier than I expected.
---
Actually all the pvpers on pc want the hacked weapons deleted, even the ones who abuse it
---
I feel like the obvious solution if they don't want people building literal towns is to create a Clan system which will allow people to merge camps together and have higher build limits.   
---
I am not even that social a player but it would be cool if several players could setup a camp together as a Base of Operations for them all.   
---
I honestly don't get why they haven't already got a proper system in the game for social groups like that.
---
They were just fine in Fallout 4, why did they need to heavily buff them while the Deathclaw is *still* a joke compared to Fallout 3 and NV?
---
Yeah, but it sucks so much that we DO understand only because you learn so quickly that the basic things in this game are so much broken.
---
Also me when you are not around

With troubleshooters armor they're a joke
---
Is that a brown bear outfit in undamaged condition for 350 atoms? Damn.. been saving up tokens for an outfit that'll look worse than the stuff I could just buy. Guess I shouldn't even be surprised anymore.
---
Yeah I just hope it isn't my character that's screwed up and just the guns bc I can get new guns it would just suck but I don't want my whole character and build to change bc bloodied guns are just screwed up on it
---
Yes if they‚Äôre your teammates they can edit your CAMP.
---
Use power armour and a heavy weapon maybe!?
---
Lol, but really, my first and main character is this.
---
Have one nice melee backup weapon for running out of ammo - your lvl 50 Watoga sledge works really well for that.
---
Get a Gatling for daily easy clearing of pests, but also a weapon with over 200 fire rate and one of the golden legendary effects so you can melt the queen/wendigo/etc.( watch angry turtles YouTube vids)
---
I found excavator to be the best pa for carrying stuff, so I just use it and nothing else. Dr is meh in this game.
---
Gear wise, those are the best tips.
---
Yeah so I meant to say it‚Äôs not someone taking it but the game is glitching and not loading loot. Happens to me all the time
---
Nonsense.
---
Known bug since WL release. Two months, never fixed.
---
If containers are empty, loot 60 containers somewhere else. There's a counter that you have to reach for loot to respawn. 180 items for open world items that anyone can grab and 60 containers that are personal to you.
---
Told you man. They are actually using them. Everyone want them deleted. But there are some of those people that want to make the most out of it until they are gone. They abuse the shit out of the game like there's no tomorrow
---
It‚Äôs not true. You have to loot some number of items before previously looted containers or world spawns reappear. You can‚Äôt server hop and find the same container full and why am I even explaining this again,
---

---
There's a way dude
---
hey free pride stuff so that's nice
---
A lot of this is wtf territory. No blocker? No perception cards? No need to read any of this tripe.
---
Jesus Christ on a stick... op shouldn‚Äôt listen to this garbage. He‚Äôs trolling you, I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
Care to explain or elaborate then? 
---
Because some crates or containers just don't have anything in them, whether it's because they've been previously looted or when server was spun up the random world generation determined that loot pool on that container was a null. 
---
You can determine if it's permanently empty container vs random generation null by going to the same unopened container in private world to see if still empty or new random loot pool. 
---
I'd also recommend trying the 180 refresh, meaning fast travel to a different area that would require spawns reloading loot 180+ random world items, and then head back. Even better when it's 4+ hrs after. 
---
I think most people just may not understand how world containers work, this became abundantly clear when private worlds were first released and people were insisting that someone else already looted their world - and while few were due to friends joining their private without them being aware - most were just people trying to reloot containers they already looted.
---
Dude, you do know that the majority of these hacked weapons are being used by pvers right? So we should ban all the pvers and remove pve!
---
When did you explain it before? I didn‚Äôt see you post it? Chill out.
---
I‚Äôve been to fresh areas that literally give me nothing in containers, hell I‚Äôve killed numerous enemies, some legendaries, who‚Äôve given me nothing
---
Live, hopefully making little baby growling noises when enemies are nearby.
---
Gotta be creative. https://i.imgur.com/Z4O5Wo8.jpg
---
But yes I wish there was more static junk you could place on shelves, and not have to use camp tricks to make it happen.
---
No worries, glad someone hooked you up.  A lot of other helpful Vault Dwellers out there.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work that way.
---
Cool.  Thanks.
---
Sweep the leg. Do you have a problem with that?
---
I thought this exact same thing during Beta. I thought I'd pulled off the score of the century when I emptied the stash of a camp i stumbled across.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôd be happy to help you level up and explore. I‚Äôm on at weird times, usually afternoons if that works.
---
Cringe
---
Lol you obviously don't pve. Pve don't need those hacked weapons cause 'magic' weapons actually do as much damage.
---
Thank you for your informative help. I know so much more now. This was a productive conversation
---
Agreed!
---
My hubby and I launched our first nuke a few weeks ago. I heard about the robots down there... but nothing more.
---
We didn‚Äôt watch any vids and it was the best thing ever. We fought our way through the bunker for 1,5 hours. Solving all that stuff ourselves. We arrived at the last room without stimpacks and barely ammo.
---
But dammit was it satisfying to see our very first nuke getting on its way!
---
I wish we had a little camp fire on that cliff while watching the nuke going down... üíô
---
My guy, I've seen 3 people at the queen using hacked 50 cals
---
The responder fireman outfit is only dropped as quest rewards. It‚Äôs not lootable.
---
It's a rare ass outfit, of course it won't be located on the body.
---
I think they nerfed that. Used to be a nuke would create bunch of ultracite veins. Last week I hit it with a nuke and was only two veins. So... not sure about this, but sure seems like they nerfed that. Annoying. Was a great place to stock up on high radiation fluids. Ugh.
---
Dude, you only need to read other posts in this thread if you‚Äôre too lazy to google to understand. I‚Äôm leaving the explanation to the informed members of this sub, tonight I‚Äôm simply pointing out the misinformation.
---
I'm sure they did? And who's going to rise up and take the world back from who? Lol the way we're going we'll probably all be dead within the next century or two anyways? And why would they fix everything wrong with the game? That would make the game perfect and I've never played a perfect game have you?
---
Ah that looks awesome. Shame I missed out on that cool clock.
---
When this happened it made the game feel like crap and broke any immersion I had in it at the time - it was a garbage move that totally disrupted the whole setting, so YES, it most definitely needs to be undone now that the vendors share a pool of caps.
---
Bad devs doing easy fixes= bad game
---
If you don't use energy weapons get the grounded mutation.
---
If you're in a team, this is a good way to counter a troll.  You basically get up in their face and circle around them.
---
The Syringer was probably an attempt to initiate an exploit that overrules Pacifist Mode, so you were right to jump when you did.  Sounds like this other player was a real treasure.
---
It's because they're called *salvaged* Assaulttron heads. ;)
---
Say "I JUST CAN'T SHAKE THESE NIGHTMARES, OF FLOATING OFF INTO SPACE FOREVER.... JUST... WHY?!?!?"
---
Then proceed to give them a fetch quest.
---
Thank you.
---
And that provides an ‚Äú easy‚Äù player experience but it‚Äôs totally NOT what the whitesprings is and goes against every bit of fluff in the game regarding the area.
---
Best of both worlds would be to add completely new dailies that are tied to these new NPCs. Each day you would rotate between either the ones that the automatons offer or the human ones (kinda like how the crater dailies rotate between Wren and Rocksy) . Besides, ain't like the dailies are too complex of a thing to make anyways. Most contain minimal dialogue and are like:" go to point A, B, do X thing" and boom you get rewarded.
---
Yeah cause those are the people you hang out with. I block all those hackers so I don't run into them
---
You do not know who I hang out with lmaooooo
---
Someone mentioned the same thing (I guess its due to "Persistent Loot"
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bxsvs6/i_hate_persistent_loot/
---
Nah dude it's just a skiing for the paperbag when you drop stuff, kinda useless for 500atoms
---
Thank you for explaining the way it works. The spread of misinformation on this topic is brutal.
---
Chill out
---
Shotgun the legs and half the time they blow themselves up.
---
So you were able to also get the frequent spawning of scorched?
---
Well bunch of hacker pvpers I assume?
---
I wish they‚Äôd stop trying to promote real world social agendas in a game I play to get away from the real world.
---
I'm on a PC, in New Zealand so not sure of the time frame with you, usually on  afternoon NZ time.
---
What platform?
---
No. Like I said, seems nerfed. Two veins, both activated scorched and that was it. Finished. Finito. Basta. Fine'.
---
Remember alcohol (all types) are a single addiction and real easy to keep covered by constantly being drunk, leaving just four real addictions to deal with.
---
Is there any more information I can read about instanced camps?
---
I‚Äôd be more chill if you stopped wasting your time trying to get the last word and more time learning the facts.
---
This my friend is where we vary. I don‚Äôt think them (Bethesda) putting a rainbow flag in the game is catering to a social agenda. They did it to celebrate their LGBTQ+ members. As a matter of fact, the only ‚Äúagenda‚Äù I‚Äôm apart of is trying to figure out what I‚Äôm going to have for dinner tonight.
---
Full scout polymer with SS chest and LL both buttressed all troubleshooters and they've wrecked me.
---
Word
---
What I'm complaining about is puttting a 1/2 hour into killing a bunch of freaking monsters and going back all the loots is gone OR
---
Killing some of the monsters on the edge of an area and then going in and finding out that someone came in and killed everything and looted all of the freakin' containers and other monsters making all of your effort WORTHLESS!
---
Yeah no thanks.
---
Oh, it's absolutely his fault.  Think about how Ward entrusts you to retrieve the stolen tools, no matter how many times you double-cross him.
---
No, I've ranted at length before about how Ward is part of a one-man killing spree across Appalachia.  He "loans" you some tools?  Better watch out.  That's his mark of death.  He'll send his personal hit squad after you.  And he'll settle for nothing less than your cold-blooded death!  Otherwise, he'll badmouth the player at Foundation and *lower their rep*, which is something neither Rocksy nor Wren ever do at Crater.
---
Blocker has diminishing results inside power armor, even more so when you slap further damage reduction on it like Emergency Protocols, Nerd Rage and Lone Wanderer. It's very good outside PA, don't take me wrong. As for Perception... Glow Sight and Grenadier are perception cards? I just said I see no point in Butchers Bounty and keeping lockpick on instead of just using it when you need and then taking them off, not that I see no point in having perception.
---
Ok, that sounds cool
---
That's completely bullshit

That‚Äôs what it seems. There are a lot of people lower level than me with significantly more progress. Thanks
---
No i knew that its just kind of a kick in the shin that i cant get it but a corpse can lol i know its supper rare but i guess seeing a corpse has it on maybe my luck will turn aroind soon hopefully
---
Someone else killing your mobs is annoying and I get that, perhaps try areas that aren't high traffic. Things like white spring or SBQ are often flooded during nukes, but it's a large map and many areas don't have frequent players. 
---
But to be cleared, absolutely no one can grab loot from your kills or your containers. That's not possible and not how kills or containers work.  There's many legitimate things to be annoyed about, but this particular thing isn't possible. 
---
So, I think you're either confused or explaining poorly. I'd be happy to better elaborate if necessary.
---
So what would happen when you've built your camp in one of those locations, but then you go to a public world? Your camp wouldn't show up and you'd just... not have a camp I guess?
---
Thank you - that was exactly the thing I was wondering about.
---
No i know i was just saying it sucks that i cant seem to find it but a corpse that is normally in the regular firebreathers outfit can have it on now lol
---
I just hit lvl 130, I think it slows down the higher the level you are.
---
Yeah, I wonder if it ever stops increasing at a certain level.
---
Does using random things take up the camp budget?
---
They should just make stealth boys and teslas the same as they are in Nuclear Winter.
---
It can. I think that shelf was around 400-500 (4 or 5%) for all the pieces + the mats.
---
lol i can run endgame content with NO ledgendary gear, under leveled and with no distinct build. OP needs to get good.
---
yes, the meta boils down to invisible dopes farting enough voltage to power a small village
---
Under this logic, it‚Äôs ok to have kkk white ghost suits, black lives matter billboards, make America great again hats , etc etc in game.
---
Fuck all that noise. I play games to walk away from these agendas ( and that‚Äôs what they are), so I don‚Äôt need any of that noise in game.
---
I mean, does anyone in a nuclear wasteland scavenging for food and eating radiated roaches whilst hiding in bushes from deathclaws, really give a fuck about what‚Äôs between their legs and how they plan to use it?
---
This is fantasy and it needs to be that- not a social platform.  Hell, we‚Äôve too many of those as is.
---
I can't get their priorities. Why 'fix' this? Did it hurt anyone? Taking into account the time to do the silo run, it's only fair you could earn something valuable out of it. At the same time they have basic things being broken since release, year and a half later.
---
12. Contrary to popular belief, it's called the "Whitespring" and not "Whitesprings" or "Goodsprings" or whatever :P
---
I'm on PS4 but new (2 months), older (52) player myself.  Just wanted to say welcome - this is a fun game.
---
Kinda bare bones again...but fine by me since it means I save money.
---
Bethesda said that Private Worlds are going to have a bigger CAMP budget so they're going to need a solution for when you go to a public world since that would put you over budget so I figure they can just use the same solution they'll do with the budget for placing CAMPs in locations
---
If I had to guess they'll make it so Fallout 1st members get two separate CAMPs: one for private servers that have increased budget and can be placed anywhere and a separate one for public servers
---
"pounded from behind by scorchbeast blasts"
---
Rough day huh?
---
Nice
---
I see what yer saying. It‚Äôs bullshit it‚Äôs on a dead npc but we can‚Äôt loot it off said npc.
---
I mean, I suppose with Fallout 1st, the expense isn't as bad as if you purchased atoms.
---
To be fair, VATS makes aiming obsolete with any weapon. Tesla has crappy ammo capacity and reload. I‚Äôve just never been wrecked by one but I don‚Äôt pvp much so there‚Äôs that.
---
Do settlers to get the stealth Chinese armour then indefinitely join raiders to get the ammo making machine that's how Im playing.. But just depends what you want :)
---
I bought it but it won't let me put it on. I have a standard jetpack on my x01 power armor and I have the materials to put on the moth man one but I lack requirements.
---
Sheesh. Once the instance home bases drops, I'm guessing that we'll have more build budget.
---
Lol I literally asked this 10 min ago
---
Has he done anything new I used to love him
---
I leave the game on and do other stuff let my resources build up and wait for the queen
---
Definitely! I was lucky to have 2 other people with me at the time on a private chat. That player was definitely toxic... but i assume you must be pretty bored of the game to be trolling other players at level 396
---
if you crouch it's almost impossible for vats to detect you, and a lot of people I know have quads just for pvp
---
True, Maybe I just want bigger doors in Fallout 76üòÇ
---
If you want to buy a set that you can have (without legendary effects of course) your better off doing the Enclave Quests line to unlock access to MODUS and buy the Scout Armor. 
---
I'm a non PA Heavy Weapons user and I use the same Weapons as you got now (Except my Minigun is a Zelot) 
---
Those Energy based Weapons you mentioned do count as a Heavy Weapon but as you what's the best? Watch this when you get a chance: https://youtu.be/sWkklNsa0Fw
---
Yeah but either way atoms can be spent on way better things
---
Its just kind of a slap to the face lol i dont even care if its rare i mainly want it because of the color scheme and im running a completely reponder based character
---
And they said paint is coming too, although not sure when exactly.
---
Considering how utterly ridiculous it looks, particularly the shoulders, I just use cosmetics anyway.

Not sure, used to listen to a lot of comedy on my commute. And it sounds so close.
---
My ally only wears a party hat. Shes cool with it.
---
I carry a tesla rifle for doing events when lots of peeps show. it allows me to get hits in before everything is one shot by others.
---
Raiders
---
Thanks, I have the zealot as well, will watch, thanks.
---
Any thoughts on the light set?
---
Check the trading sub reddit. I would link it but I'm pretty sure I get banned for it as the mods on both sides are children. Just check my profile and you'll see the sub
---
Each level takes more exp then the last though I think a some poi t its just like a 1000 exp more for each level
---
lol two shit is garbage. double dips on item degradation, less damage increase than AA, major penalty to accuracy.
---
You can also max both it just takes time
---
i was thinking raiders because you can get a legendary plasma rifle called the slug buster in vault 79 raid, but an ammo machine sounds great too. might just go for them
---
That's the meta. Teslas, legacy energy weapons with scatter nozzle, nuke miniguns, pvpers try as best as they can to compensate their horrible aim
---
Yes! That'd go perfectly with my Deathclaw mask! The gator one would too but who knows how long it'll be until those return
---
So it just goes up forever, huh. Thanks for the info :)
---
why the FUCK, we cant have a gramophone as a camp object is beyond me.
---
I think every subscription in the world works like that. Hbo, netflix, newspapers... when you sign up the assumption is you want to keep going until you tell them you want to stop
---
I use a legacy laser with scatter and honestly if it isnt bloodied it's not even crazy, but people with bloodied teslas? instantly dead and theres nothing you can do about it
---
Umm... You do realise that Bethesda tell you exactly what you're paying for, right? So even if they show "aspirational lifestyle" stuff, there is no confusion. They literally tell you in legible print right below the image.
---
i do skip usually, i will try that tomorrow, thx for the tip!
---
I use a bloodied tesla for the same purpose but I'm not a bozo so I don't use it to pvp because it isnt fun whatsoever
---
That needs to be tightened up.
---
If you wait longer than a minute then 'cancel' and try again, you'll instantly get in. That happens to me sometimes.
---
Course less people could be playing now since there aren't any new rewards and the seasonal challenges ended.. but I'm sure there's still people that actively play it.
---
In org runs were you respawning the mobs or just looping around I circles? 76 is coded weird AF, and you can get mobs to spawn again and again in a nuke zone.. Just have to tickle the server the right way.
---
Look up angry turtle farming whitesprings in the last few weeks on yt if you want YT see the current timing and tweaks.  I personal use whitesprings a private server and. 2 characters to farm mats but I should try Tanagra next.
---
Theres Also a fly thru half the silo thing thats been reported to Bethesda for months they haven't bothered to fix and considering how many botched bugged silo runs I've had I don't feel bad using it.  It's about 8 mins from entrance to nuke launch.
---
Oh man I need all the mothman stuff but I soooo can not afford to spend money on atomic points. I had juuuuust enough to get the mothman bed though!
---
I‚Äôve finish AT collection, so it must be spawning now
---
Ahh, didn‚Äôt consider that. Quad would probably make the Tesla more than useful then. Also didn‚Äôt consider stealth, kind of makes that obsolete too.
---
Yeah some of these bugs are just stupid at this point
---
There was lots of Free States stuff a few months ago, like everything for weeks was Free States
---
You are getting downvotes because this question gets asked daily and you could have easily used the search function.
---
Played since launch and not once did I scrap or vendor something I actually use
---
The mob was just constantly respawning in that one spot. We posted ourselves on the path that leads down to where the veins and head are and just rained fire as soon as they spawned in. Didn‚Äôt move anywhere.
---
K then that was bugged AF
---
Farm the daily BOS quest you can redo it constantly with no cooldown as long as you access the terminal use the unlimited script to get the weapon type you want it is slower but more reliable.
---
I didn't see it mentioned here yet, but I think camp aesthetic really helps
---
Go for settlers as drag suggests if any interest in the Chinese stealth suit. Will get plans for it as a quest reward and save several weeks of grinding gold bullion.  You will max both factions out in the end
---
Yes it‚Äôs as random as the others now.
---
I just saw one in the wild the other day.  Wish I would have grabbed it.
---
Renaming is a really good idea. I scrapped my chest piece once and was devastated.
---
Slow down is the best I‚Äôve got.
---
Live until I stuff it full with all my heavy weapons.
---
which quest might this be?
---
Really? That‚Äôs crazy because I feel like I‚Äôm extra cautious about stuff like that but it‚Äôs happened at least 4 times to me and I‚Äôve only been playing for a few months. It‚Äôs only happened when I‚Äôm in power armor though since it unequips the rest of my armor.
---
i use a minigun with extra bash damage and a shredder for the memes sometimes
---
Fortunately I took my time and heard about this before committing. 
---
Don't think that I have a superiority complex. I'm one of those that scrapped their ultracite PA.
---
The one where you open the terminal at fort defiance then it tells you to get sb dna then go to the university to put ot in the machine
---
This game really really needs QoL features added, its an ok game but its frustrating as hell.
---
Thanks for the welcome, appreciate it.
---
16 tons ist also my favourite in this game. Justhas this uber cool vibe to it.
---
Hert of the enemy
---
Bummer if you were on Xbox I would hook you up
---
This is true. I used to craft/murmrgh on the same server with all my scrip at hand, ran into many occasions that same prefix would drop consecutively. Like three ghoul slayers something in a row is very common. Now i server hop every three items, the result is much more random and chance for a good roll is more predictable.
---
Is it really that the Assaultron is tough or is it that you are simply distracted by that fine Assaultron mechanical booty? This whole issue might just be user error.
---
I really really think there was a scorchbeast floating around outside though. Cause they‚Äôll spawn a mob, right? 
---
But there isn‚Äôt a fissure sight nearby.
---
Ah I‚Äôm mostly on Xbox. Well you‚Äôll definitely find people this is really a great player base!
---
Ah darn, thanks anyway though.
---
I've noticed all containers are empty when i first load in and come back an hour later to see them full.. I think these servers are beyond broken..
---
My quests don't even load for 10 to 20 mins after i login as well..
---
I have 800 hours in game and have less than 400 levels across my 4 characters I think
---
ph right yeah I have been doing that every day but only getting like 8 script a day from it :/ on top of my other dailies getting around 200 a day per character
---
Definitely!  LOL  :)
---
Scorch will cause spawn adds but its like 5 scorched every couple of mins... And in diffent locs useally that then come to you. Ya whatever setup you had at the time was bugged AF.
---
It‚Äôs all good. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll snag him one eventually
---
Haha
---
I got mine from a wolf horde event. I feel obligated to wear it everywhere I go now
---
It‚Äôs great that they made Fasnacht masks non-scrappable, I hope they can do the same to all event-rewarded clothing items such as jump suits, scout masks, leather coats etc.
---
I should have one but I can't get on right now.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs probably this. Since A TON of my time was being spent scrapping/organizing/selling I decided that I needed a safe way to make it go faster. There‚Äôs just so much prep work for everything. 
---
I definitely don‚Äôt waste as much time as I did in Fallout 4, building settlements from the ground up and gearing every individual settler. Then micromanaging so there wasn‚Äôt a single ghoul outside of the pool settlement (it was more for a haunted house theme than for segregation but I‚Äôm not sure that makes it better). That‚Äôs not to say I don‚Äôt miss that aspect because it was probably my favorite part about Fallout 4.
---
If melee, sneak up and one shot them, if ranged, sneak and one shot them from range!
---
If shotgun, cripple their head then their legs!
---
The AAE , TSE, and QE versions of the laser all hit extremely hard just like the BE imo. The only ones I think hit less are the ultracite versions. 
---
I personally prefer the QE on the laser for obvious reasons. There‚Äôs no escaping lol.
---
I also carry a Qffr fr tesla for those that choose that route. I‚Äôve also found the new SS armor to at least take a few more hits before the tesla melts me, but that‚Äôs also partly build.
---
Niceee dude! Yeah man, doing them on public server is awesome, I never really liked private servers just cause no friends that are dedicated as me, and it just feels empty when I joined someone‚Äôs private server.
---
You‚Äôre equating a hate group (KKK) to a movement that is working towards equality. And this one day after SCOTUS ruled in favor of equality protection for LGBTQ individuals to prevent them from being fired for their gender identity or sexual orientation. 
---
Sorry, but you‚Äôre on the wrong side of this issue.
---
And that‚Äôs coming from an old, straight, white male veteran.
---
Add in that you‚Äôre trying to put a negative spin on another movement with a purpose to promote equal civil rights for a demographic that has been systemically oppressed and treated negatively?
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre definitely on the wrong side of history here.
---
Thanks!
---
You don‚Äôt need the codes? At all? I mean in your inventory.
---
Was it the pack leader one alot of people say they get it from that one
---
Whooooa
---
Soviet Anthem*
---
What about 999 caps?
---
Someone gave me this link
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php](https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php)
---
You don‚Äôt need to have any codes. You just need to be correct when you enter the code.
---
I always position a bathtub in front of one of my purifier taps, they never use it!
---
That‚Äôs fine my psn ID is Topsykretts12349
---
Yeah, the Chinese Stealth Armor is like that too. You can‚Äôt vendor it but you can‚Äôt scrap it either, which is good because it‚Äôs a ton of expensive mats.
---
The only things I‚Äôve accidentally scrapped now they put that ‚Äòfavorited item‚Äô speed bump is when I‚Äôm scrapping while wearing my power armor and I happen to have one random regular armor I was using that wasn‚Äôt legendary. 
---
That sucks. But if I‚Äôm already using a non-legendary, it‚Äôs kind of like, guess I‚Äôm building me a new one.
---
I have not tamed anything - however, I am constantly going to different random spawn points looking for the witch costume. Using that, I have run across random deathclaw, sloths, sheep, and yao gauis. These have usually spawned alone (although sometimes in pairs). If you are planning to target any of these creatures for taming, just look up the spawn points for the witch costume and server hope until you get the spawn you need.
---
I have hound all magazines and bobbleheads. Too bad they use 45% of my budget and I won't be using them for display though
---
After leader of the pack there is a second event ‚ÄúWolfe horde‚Äù.
---
If you can wait until tomorrow after 1pm EST and are willing to trade dog food for it, I can hook you up.
---
Oh also forgot to add if Ward gets 2 dialogue options before you have the option to say 1 then he will glitch, forgot to add that this is fixed by backing out starting again and not skipping.
---
Sometimes he will glitch and say 2 lines of dialogue even if u dont skip that's why it's important to watch out for that, that's been my tell tale sign that rep won't be awarded....
---
Rep grind is brutal enough for settlers without the main daily having a glitchy mechanic that causes no rep to be awarded cuz we don't wanna hear ward lines after 20 times.... We just wanna skip em üò≠üò≠ but alas we can't cuz we need that rep. I can say once your maxed there is no worries üòÇ
---
Thanks
---
Sign me up!
---
Thank you
---
I‚Äôm in the Same boat, what lvl are you?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tradable. Unfortunately you‚Äôll need to save up gold.
---
I hate all Mirelurks, but especially Mirelurk Kings!
---
Also: How does that Mirelurk Queen scuttle so fast? She‚Äôs friggin enormous. She should be way slower.
---
107
---
Hmmmm. It‚Äôs interesting cause the guys I was with were two randoms. One was level 600 something, the other was 90 something. So I feel like they knew about this exploit. And to specifically nuke Tanagra of all places. 
---
Now I just gotta figure out how to duplicate that bug.
---
I sadly got scammed for my QE90 laser and I've since only used an aae ult laser rifle, maybe the ultracite is making me not hit as hard, because I also have max tank killer and I should be ignoring like 95% of armor?
---
Hey if you find out the secret tickle dm it to me...
---
I bet they‚Äôre not so fun at parties then after all.
---
Ah, I would but I only have 1 can.
---
No worries some one gave it to me just passing it on.
---
I just bought it but where where you trying to get it from? I thought that when I looked online at so you could only get it in the atomic shop or I wouldn't even have bought it. Is it on the mr. Fussy reward list and I just missed it?
---
Lazy? Doubtful. Understaffed? Definitely.
---
yeah theres just no getting away from a tesla user unless you have the range on them, and I only use auto rifles and heavies so it's kinda hard to kill a 3 foot tall man crouched jumping 50 feet into the sky while coming towards me shooting 10 million volts of electricity inside me
---
I didn't get the plan from the event until after someone dropped it for me at fashnacht.
---
West tek prostitutes. The shit they can do with their tongues...
---
Ok..uhh, any rubber scrap? I'm always looking for that.
---
I‚Äôm hoping to get some more feedback from someone who has experienced what I went through. And hope they have more info on it. 
---
It would be nice to have a new reliable farming spot.
---
I paid 4k for one about a week ago.
---
You should prime it and keep it. You‚Äôll have fun with it.
---
lmao every time emerson visited he was halfway through the floor like they'd just finished cartoon fighting
---
Was in the same boat . You don‚Äôt get plans via settlers but you just learn them from a settlers mission. So you now have to save up 4000 gold on your main character to buy the plans . Also you can‚Äôt transfer the Chinese stealth armor between characters
---
You can cheat with the instanced Grafton Pawn Shop, but I decided I didn‚Äôt wanna do that.
---
Oh okay i never seem to get anything from the last wolf at the end maybe im just unlucky or something i do get like the small rewards like chems or ammo or whatnot though
---
16/6?
---
*Communist target acquired*
---
This has more to do with your hard drive and internet connection then the server you're logging into. 
---
The quests are there the moment you login, it just takes the 10-20 min for your local system to process all the provided information.
---
Since not every individual logs into the server at the same time it can't be the server itself that is lagged here. It's how long it takes for you to catch up.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly how it‚Äôs happened for me lol. I‚Äôm only at 67 so I haven‚Äôt managed to keep a full set of legendaries that I like so I‚Äôve been sticking with my shadowed or enameled combat armor... I care more about aesthetics than I probably should but I refuse to wear leather pieces with anything else but more leather, and robot armor just looks horrible with anything else but more robot armor... I could just wear an outfit over it but...
---
As soon as you hear that laser charging you immediately start looking around in panic!! Lol
---
Do you have a list of different locations for this?
---
It‚Äôs actually multiplied and not added with AA so you will get diminishing results if I remember correctly. I know there‚Äôs been lots of posts about it here.
---
Maybe try taking tank killer off and see if it‚Äôs harder.
---
There‚Äôs not an RPG/MMO out there doesn‚Äôt have at least a few enemies that far outclass the most geared character.
---
This is why you NEVER accept a random team invite. Rookie move but at least you know now.
---
I think I have close to 200... I could all of that and something else.
---
Being oceanic there is nothing i can do about it, all the servers are either in Asia or the USA, so i'm stuffed. Also my ally quests don't update at all sometimes and my dailies are every three real life days now.
---
That‚Äôs good peace of mind, we need that for all rare items, they can be so easily destroyed.
---
You could make a lot of money if you found the right buyer for a video like that but you could also get arrested so... Hey anyway that jumping thing is also completely ridiculous.
---
So then why are you saying the servers are broken?
---
im definetly will be looking for those signs from now on, cant wait to be done with these lol
---
its a jetpack reskin for power armor to use it you need to know the jet-pack plan for a class of PA you want to add it to. eg t-60 t-51 etc (if it has jet-pack option) you got to a PA station bench and can add it on the torso instead of the reg jet-pack
---
I know, right?  I remember how shocked I was the first time I fought a mirelurk queen, and I saw how FAST she moved from long away to right on top of me!  When it comes to the kings, I seriously dread seeing one of those, more than an assaultron!
---
Good luck!!
---
Yes, this video was extremely helpful [https://youtu.be/sWSqTmjz8GE](https://youtu.be/sWSqTmjz8GE)
---
Btw, if you do happen to find the witch costume while trying to tame - treasure it. Going on 10+ hours so far
---
Dude this is RAD thank you for sharing!
---
Workshops will bring the griefers too, best bet is to find a private server.
---
Don't really need anything else. I'll tell you what, if you're on right now, give me a little time and I'll hop on for a minute and get you your hat. I just need to get out of bed and turn everything on.
---
maybe the money would be worth it so I could buy a hacked weapon on Ebay or something to finally kill everyone with Tesla's
---
She scares me. 
---
But what really kills me are the elemental balloons. In multiples, it‚Äôs a shitshow. I‚Äôm running around, doing drugs, sticking myself with stims, crying like a little girl.
---
Can confirm
---
Try another sub. This one has rules prohibiting bartering posts.
---
does the armour have legendary properties?
---
Wow I defiantly owe you big time.
---
No I mean it looks as if people have jetpacks WITHOUT power armour on
---
Flashbacks to my poor sloth :( i still miss him everytime the photo i took pops up
---
Take out their knees.  Whatever crippling skill you have, or something with limb damage in an Assaultron area, and they are WAY easier to deal with.
---
Lt. Dan your way to dominance.
---
No but you can go invisible while crouching but doesn‚Äôt go away when you move
---
I'm waiting till they add a skin to make the backpack look like a quiver for all the bow users, also really want bethesda to ad some nice skins in for armours that have been in the game from the start like marine armour or a nice scout armour skin not bright orange! like how on earth is that camouflage who wants to look like a clown fish monstrosity? add a katana skin in for the shish kebab! we got the samurai outfit! now finish it off bethesda
---
Haha I vibe with this xD thoes things are pain in the ass to deal with.
---
Oh sorry I‚Äôll take it down
---
yeah sorry I couldn't have gotten back to you sooner, as already stated though it was in a collectors edition for fallout 4, official make. really nice piece, I've had it on one of my fallout walls on display for 5 years, love it! hope you can find one!
---
I really wish they would have put foundation in a cooler place like ok i get that they are far away because you know they hate each other but i feel like where they are is so bland like it would be way better if they were in the mire they could somehow incorporate all the roots and vines into the builds and they could have possibly done something with the heart of the swamp for a main quest line
---
thanks!
---
Something tells me that one guy hammering that nail into that mailbox in Foundation will be hammering away at it forever, the poor guy.
---
Bethesda should remove the cap limit. its a player market, players should be free to set what ever price they want, and be able to be as wealthy as their hard work and luck allow.
---
No worries, the rubber will be enough. :) I'll have a mic but you don't need one.
---
Because they are and should not work that way its why i've gotten bored and stopped playing.. the weight mechanics, the survival stupidity all just makes me find another game..
---
Seriously bad design. P.s. they lost a sub.
---
A.T.H.E.N.A. notices you watching and turns to look at you.
---
  
---
You stare back and a still silence ensues until you hear the sacred words:
---
"Another bird! Adding to current tally. Bird count...increased!"
---
Just waiting on the damn PC 2 to finally release.
---
It‚Äôs 200 XP to go from level 1 to 2. Each level after that requires the previous level‚Äôs amount of XP + 160 XP. 
---
200, 360, 520, 680, etc. 
---
Take your current level and subtract 1. Multiply that by 160 and then add 200. That‚Äôs how much XP you need. 
---
So, at level 200, you need (199x160)+200 or 32,040 XP to fill up the XP bar and reach level 201. 
---
[Reference Link](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level)
---
Absolutely. I‚Äôm not going to let it ruin my day or anything but it was pretty disheartening. The 25k weapon was an Ultracite Gatling F/25/15R so it was quite good and very rare.
---
(imagines the guy from South Park's Warcraft Episode)
---
I would say unlimited isn't really needed (would be nice though), but a limit of 2000, maybe even 1500 would be just fine.
---
I agree with this. But, can someone please guide me to where I can find a backpack because I have absolutely no idea. ü§£ I‚Äôve looked it up and for some reason I can never get the quest or whatever it is to get one
---
You're gonna have to be more specific. The different 'biomes' of the game play different music tracks. For instance, the Savage Divide has a completely different soundtrack to the Ash Heap.
---
Whereabouts in the game are you hearing this? Or are you hearing it on the main menu or somewhere else?
---
I wish we could at least put down our survival tent in the middle of a town in a private session. I hate running around like a head with my chicken cut off trying to find a place to set that thing.
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 I‚Äôm down to help you out, I‚Äôm only level 33 but I‚Äôve got a good build and chems to share :)
---
(Uses metal shelves to create annoying see-thru maze for Ally)
---
[edit: ... annnnnnd camp budget full... dammit]
---
Then you'd probably be a better candidate for steam solo pc play since it can work offline from what I've seen.
---
The weight mechanics is absolutely not hard to figure out at all. 
---
It's all an intentional trade off, if you put all your perks into damage dealing, obviously you lose quality of life perks. 
---
I'm running a decently strong rifle build but trade some crit and sneak damage perks for quality of life and with the right armor I rarely have any issues with what would be thousands of lbs of ammo, aid, weapons and armor on my character at all times. 100k + ammo, 10s of thousands of aid, 100s of weapons or armor. Zero weight issues and half my stash box open if needed. 
---
If people bother to learn how to play the game before complaining about how it's designed it usually works a lot better.
---
So take up stash space in hopes you will drop by to take loot off our hands for free?
---
Half the weapons in the game are useless, just have like one good melee, heavy weapon and 2-3 rifles and it's enough.
---
Secret service armor
---
That show is a trip even more so when you realize Seth McFarland is the one who made it if I remember correctly from that to family guy.......  Got dang it Bobby.
---
Dude, if bow ammo didn‚Äôt way so much I would absolutely. But it is just so heavy it fills up my stash so quickly.
---
Its why i stopped my stealth arrow build, bows are so inaccurate, the ammo is expensive and rare and the vats is busted.. I gave up.
---
My camp is called paranoid paramedic, I sell stims, chems and other similar items cheap via vending and offer beds for rest and free food.  I would love a brief description for my camp on the map.  I play PC and my name is the same as my reddit name.  Im usually near a lower level area near a train station.
---
You don't have a settlement. You have a C.A.M.P. You also don't have settlers, but you do have Allies. Bethesda said you can only have one until they find ways that it won't affect stability. And if you think stability isn't an issue, well my 12 FPS sometimes begs to differ.
---
Could be more like market in nuka town from fallout 4
---
Yeah, idk what Bethesda's logic is on the current cap limit. My gameplay wont change much from having 30k caps or 3 mil caps.
---
Yeah like that
---
Certainly!
---
Steam solo play? wtf is that.. also i never said the weight is hard to figure out i said its just a garbage mechanic, which annoys me daily.. as does the tacked on survival..
---
I'm just bored of fallout after the stories finished so fighting with garbage mechanics is not why i play gaming..
---
What does the written description say?  That‚Äôs where you could have a case.
---
Submit a refund request if you‚Äôd like.
---
Donate to the Robin Hood Rambos of Appalachia
---
I did 4 pills at mumbles. 2 harpoon guns. FML.
---
I wouldn't have a problem with that if they deleted every present from the game.
---
Finding out you can hold the crit button down to uses it as soon as you fill the meter changed my life
---
You can have the 7 arrows I have in my vendor for the listed price, 1 cap each.
---
Southern lookout tower and cranberry glade, those are my places, I tamed a mega sloth at cranberry glade three days ago because my deathclaw died RIP Clawford
---
Uhh. All helmets do that.
---
A legacy explosive laser will one tap mirelurk queens just hit the water or ground in front. Same with mirelurk kings. After all the distractors are gone switch to a Primed 25ffr limb damage handmade to take down the dragons ;)
---
Between Picketts fort and knife edge there is a blown up shack with rad bears, commander chubbs and more. Quite a few. 
---
But they are all in the to of the shack and a pain to get to.
---
Imagine all those settlers saying their redundant annoying voicelines - all at once! It would be beautiful!
---
I pick up #4 all the time. In the past two days, I've found it probably 3 times. I've sever hopped a bit and basically went around farming for materials and doing dailies.
---
I sold two of them out of my machines.
---
That one is definitely not a rare drop for me.
---
Almost any automatic weapon can conceivably have a very low or nonexistent AP cost with the -25% AP cost in VATS attribute. Always make sure in addition to your automatic receivers to throw on an aligned long barrel, either aligned or forceful stock, a reflex sight, and either a quick or swift magazine. All of these attachments are confirmed to reduce AP cost in VATS. The game doesn't tell you this sadly, but trust me, there's material to support this. The most popular commando weapons are Fixers and Handmades for obvious reasons, but Fixers tend to win in the AP department. I haven't used much else.
---
Yeah, I'll never willingly show off that ugly ass armor.
---
The small backpack plan is in Morgantown airport. Go into the terminal building and through the various tunnels to where you will find a non hostile npc, in that room is an overseer cache, the plan is in the cache. Th small backpack has half the capacity of the normal one.
---
The normal one you get for completing the pioneer scouts "order of the tadpole" mission, requiring you to revive a player, do certain events and complete three of the tadpole world challenges under the challenges list. 
---
You craft the backpack at an armor bench.
---
Actually they fixed crouching. Vats can still target you even if you're crouched.
---
I was pretty hyped about the skulls in one of the pictures, but they weren't in the bundle. Pretty lame.
---
If you're on xbox one I'll make a shit ton of arrows for you for free
---
Junk sells good as well. I can't keep enough in people buy it up so fast.
---
Lmao
---
Sadly I doubt this will ever get fixed. 
---
Shame too, I was really considering picking it up until I saw this. 
---
Thank you for sharing, and I'd suggest submitting a ticket for a refund request, might at least get your atoms back, bonus if they let you keep it.

Honestly I'd just be happy if I had anything to spend money on. We don't have any cap sinks, or interesting things to buy. Beth is so focused on EVERYTHING being Atom shop that I just struggle to care. I'm still stockpiling caps, but not for any real purpose, but theu keep rolling in so I keep dumping them on alts.
---
I've been using a troubleshooter + fire rate + reload speed flamer for running nukes and it makes it so fast and easy. Easily run through 500-700 fuel per run though.
---
The only thing thats predictable with the old hag is that she will give you shite 90% of the time.
---
Oh for sure it‚Äôs a rare drop. It was only the one time I got it. It was funny because it‚Äôs on my nuclear winter character who has never done any of the quests and only done a few events in adventure mode.
---
5-10k easily, 15-20k if you're willing to hold out
---
they should NEVER have created them in the first place. i remember when i realized they could drop caps i was like "oh nononono thats a problem" lo and behold, they got mega duped, as if it wasnt obvious that was going to happen.
---
I guess there has never been an MTX for the SS Jetpack? I was just about to buy but luckily I checked here first.
---
I farm legendarys at whitespring golf club. Just sprint through the place to trigger all of the ghouls, jump on top of something, and wild out with a tesla rifle. 1-2 legendarys each time.
---
1k hours in. Level 335
---
Preferably not a atomic shop item hear me out, alright so theres a new quest and a small settlement added u go there talk to a few of the settlers starting off a few of the settlers want u to retrieve some items to upgrade the place the place u do so and after a day or so u return theres new building, crops, cattle, right so then there leader tells u that the last few nights some of the live stock has been killed so u investigate and your investigation leads you to a yao guai u kill it return to settlers they reward you another 24 hours pass you return and they tell you that the attacks continued so u investigate again and  u uncover whatever creature kill it return for the reward, well another 24 hours has passed u return to the settlement and everyone is dead ur investigation leads you to a deathclaw nest with a level 100 deathclaw once u kill it you investigate the best and find a little baby deathclaw that u can now have at your camp and can craft the backpack, now for all the people whose first thought is they'd never do it not without putting it in the atom shop well at this point u have unlocked a few varieties to purchase in the shop, such as baby glowing deathclaw, chameleon, etc

Why tf does nothing work with the T-65
---
Jeez, 45%, I never realized how much they take up. Probably gonna end up removing them too, they just add a nice touch in display
---
Even though I‚Äôm on this sub constantly I‚Äôve seem to entirely missed why we‚Äôre mad at Bethesda this time. Can anyone fill me in?

---
(Beth reads this)
---
B1: "They want us to raise cap limit"
---
B2: "Ok, but what's in it for us?"
---
B1: "Well, we could make caps have a carry weight..."
---
B2: "Yes!"

(Caps now add inventory weight like ammo)

I took them out and have a 4x7x7 fight club now
---
I can't answer that lol. I'm honestly surprised nobody else heard it. I'm assuming the volume needs to be low otherwise it just sounds like music. I've never head it loud and don't think I've ever played the game with volume up listening only to the game. It's always been just loud enough to hear whats going on and quiet enough so I can listen to whatever else is on. I just had to ask I've been wanting to for a very long time. Gotta be other people. has to be.
---
I want content that isn't about acquiring yet another currency and/or buying shit.
---
Alright a general tip for those who aren't stealth cheesing their way through.
---
Inside each area there are two prespawned assaultrons, these are the single greatest threat to your life, take them out first before anything else, only laser turrets and col gutsies are worth dedicating time to killing until both assaultrons are out of the picture.
---
Do not kill protectrons. These are low threat, and slow. If there are too many robots alive the game will not spawn new ones, and the more bots that get spawned the more likely it is that a really nasty one comes out, like an additional assaultron or high level gutsie. 
---
do not clear out early areas, if you lock 3 mr handies in the first room then the max number of robots spawned through the whole rest of the silo will be reduced significantly. This is why sneaking past makes everything easier, the more stuff that is alive somewhere pointless means less stuff somewhere important. It is entirely possible to have the final fight area not spawning robots to attack you during the final defense event by simply having enough bots alive in other areas.
---
Like the game itself.
---
No point buying the plan unless you are flush with caps. Ask on the market guys will do it for a few hundred caps if you have the fluxüëç
---
OMG XD
---
üôÑ we didn‚Äôt ask for your bad take bye
---
Nah. To do it right would require persistent servers.
---
Best to just come up with some new form of currency and bullshit rewards for people to grind for.
---
No, no deep pockets for the limbs. It‚Äôs either an oversight that will probably never be fixed, or a trade off for the high resistances of the armor.
---
Well too fucking bad. You've got it. What are you going to do? Whine?
---
you join public teams for different types of things. hunting, rp, events, building ect. and you get different buffs depending on your "bond" with the other members of that team. the "bond" only last until you leave the server. so you get like 5% buff to exp for hunting for being in the team for a hour 10 % for 2 hrs and up and so on. then you leave the server, game crashes, you are done playing for the day ect and the "bond" is gone .
---
The small things like that are what drive me insane.. such a small fix.. that will never happen. The game is full of these problems. Things that should take someone an less than an hour to fix, that have been in since beta.
---
I'm level 378 and that's been the story of my life. The "game" for me is getting the best legendaries outfits plans and other rare stuff.  That keeps me quite busy. I haven't been bored but I also don't mind all the odd stuff like inventory management (across many accounts) cap scrip grind etc. It sure as hell isn't as story based as previous iterations and yes the upsell to FO 1st is real... A life of gaming convenience behind a pay wall.
---
Yep, it is quite frustrating
---
Dumb question, does the welcome mat in the atom shop function as a fasttravel point?
---
I dont know about any spots but all I do is take every duct tape and wonderglue I come across by just exploring normally and I get hundreds
---
Do allot of queen runs to get the repair kits also white knight and lucky break. Under agility and luck
---
Those all say ‚ÄòMASK‚Äô. Not ‚ÄòHELMET‚Äô. 
---
Submit a refund request. I hope it works out for you.
---
I think I remember reading that they are gonna be adding pocketed to limbs and it was missed or something. As well as mods for the underarmour. Something something test server
---
Fireproof at max is the only thing that stops it from just melting anything
---
If you really are running low you can grow your own? Make vegetable starch. I feel like duct tape is everywhere though
---
The value of the marine tactical helmet is that you can craft it for dirt cheap (1 steel, 1 glass, 3 rubber). And with hard bargain it sells for 27. 
---
Makes a great way to git your daily 1400 caps.
---
Hearing the laser charging when you don't know where it is coming from is the most horrifying experience in the game
---
In case you don't know, the jet pack will replace deep pockets.
---
Step 1) get the green thumb trait
---
Step 2) build a ton of tatos, mutfruit, and corn at your camp
---
Step 3) place a water purifier 
---
Step 4) combine all 4 of these into vegetable starch at a cooking station 
---
You can break this down into adhesive. Essentially unlimited adhesive. And once you get the super duper perk it‚Äôs even better!
---
I have my eye on you.
---
Make a vegetable starch farm at your CAMP. From memory it‚Äôs Corn, Mutfruit and Tato. 
---
Equip Green Thumb perk (or whatever it‚Äôs called) to farm then Super Duper when you start crafting.
---
Thanks, but I'm only lvl 47. Lol
---
What part isn‚Äôt clear about metal mothman mask?
---
Tough
---
It's like the devs don't play this game.
---
How are these changes justifiable, how are they even a priority. There are way more important changes to make. Launchers are shit and will always be shit because the way condition loss is calculated IS STILL NOT FIXED AFTER A YEAR. Who is going to play with a rocket launcher or mini nukes, it breaks in five hits? Why is energy damage calculation in relation to armor penetration handled different than ballistic, causing it to be shit. Why can I still stack armor, bobbleheads and food? Why are shotguns only viable when I have to resort to what's clearly a bug. If you have one conversation with three completely random experienced players you'd have a list of bugs to that need to be fixed ASAP.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Dev's if you're clueless that's fine, just reach out to people actually still playing
---
I have had to resort to intentionally spreading a bug after reporting it literally ten times to bethesda over the last year. Now I'm one shotting every Queen I get my hands on. Killing foodbuilds with trap bases and straight up griefing with whatever I feel like, and my bag of tricks is deep and everything has been reporting multiple times.
---
And then I read these changes
---
Astonishing.
---
Why not a pride flag camp item?
---
Not sure why people are downvoting this without explanation. It's a well-known trend.
---
Yao guias too
---
Mutefriet Tate‚Äôs and corn with purified water can be cooked into vegetable starch under the utility tab. Super duper (luck perk) can squeeze extra adhesive while cooking. If you have max affinity with settlers you can get a item called the turbo-fert grenade which instantly replenishes crops. Green thumb also helps a lot.

Assaultrons can catch you off gaurd its probably the only time I die/come close.
---
Stimpack when low health legendary/perk can be quite useful. While I rarely die to them I will admit I would a lot without it.
---
You don't have to launch it whenever someone nukes prime or encryptid pops do it for the rewards.  Hell, it is a great event to farm a lot of XP by tagging all the ads for a low-level character.
---
I was afraid of that.
---
I'll still get it to try and see if the 10 lbs of carry weight is worth losing.
---
I'll hold off on the rest for now
---
Thanks for the tips, however, I only have the small water purifier, the others can only be placed on water. Should I move my camp just for this? Took me a while to build it and I know blueprints are broken in this game.
---
You can get linings for the UA in PTS shielded is OP as F, never checked on deep-pocketed for limbs.
---
It does work... those pods that spin up, and than usually spit out a collectron bot. Sometimes those spit out an assaultron, and even thou it happened to me just a handful of times, i always flinch when i hear this spinning up, and look for the pod. Reminds me a bit how first dead space built tension and fear with sounds.
---
So out of curiosity, is the Mothman Cultist Bundle going to be around as long as the Mothman Traveler bundle?
---
So you‚Äôre telling people what to sell...in their own vendors...in their own camps. Okay Karen.
---
Oiya. What special do they buff? Need to change from was considering using scout but if the ss is good might use that as i have the plans alredy
---
The part where all the images are plastered with people in power armor wearing the mask and a "mothman red headlamp" which is no different than a normal red headlamp.
---
Using repair kits when all you need is adhesive is poor efficiency. Those should be saved for emergency field repairs. 
---
Especially for a newer player that is struggling with Adhesive.
---
you can wear that mask while in PA, just take off the PA helmet and you can look exactly like the picture.
---
Take green thumb, and collect the red pitcher plants in the cranberry bog before they open and spray. You will get digested goo from them (2x with green thumb). Each goo scraps for 4 adhesive, meaning you get 8 per plant with the perk.
---
Sparse sundew grove in particular, it's in the southwest cranberry bog area, south of fort defiance and west of watoga. There are 4 plants right close to each other on the south east side of the grove, and another 6 nearby. For a total of 80 adhesive per run. It is also a safe area, with almost no enemies spawning there most of the time. There are more plants to the north of the train tracks from there, but they are spread out and can be difficult to find.
---
Search up the Youtuber Angry Turtle - he did a guide on his Berserker build. It involves a broken Chinese Stealth Suit. You reap all the perks abide from it abide for the DR, and it won't bug out Berserker prefix to grant you the full damage.
---
Todd said, "it just works."
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Moving on to Fortnite style backpacks lol!!
---
A: why would they?
---
B: why would you want them to?
---
Because it‚Äôs not meant to be.
---
Did you read the description at all? It says you get the paint job and two masks. It has photos of the two masks along with the other items in the bundle. Just wear the mask with your power armor problem solved.
---
Ye but the underground bases are pretty cool you cant lie
---
The giant pitcher plants in the bog give out digested goo, which is worth 4 adhesive. Green Thumb doubles that. White Knight under agility will drop your repair costs for armor, as well as make them break a little (20/40/60%) slower.
---
Why do I need to pay for custom skins for the survival tent got for the FALLOUT 1st membership I already pay for... Bethesda your hurting me üò©
---
Really? You dont think it's perfectly fitting with the game for players to live in their own custom underground vault? Sounds pretty fallout to me.
---
Damn, You aren't on xbox and willing to sell that by chance.
---
How does one customer buy 40k worth of weapons at one time?
---
I'd prefer that they focus on bugs that negatively effect game play.
---
4 Str 2 Per 4 End 15 DR/ER/RR.  Pretty nice.
---
Yes, I read it. And it wasn't clear by the way it was written what parts were what.
---
And wearing a mask instead of a helmet with power armor is kind of ridiculous. You lose out on the DR and functionality of an actual helmet.
---
Oh damn that's perfect. Now I don't regret buying the plan
---
My commando build seems to take them out pretty easily. I think it's the perks that negate armor plus I have vampire on my Fixer. I just have to avoid the laser beam. But she definitely still takes chunks out of me when she gets close as well.
---
I'd recommend 12 Str for the 3 heavy perks and switching blocker, bear arms or travelling pharmacy as needed. 
---
3 in Per for locks, glow sight or grenadier as needed.
---
End is up to how tanky you want to be, though 3 for fireproof is great for sorchbeasts.
---
Since you run as a team, 4 in Cha for inspirational + a single tenderizer could be a good bet. 5 if you're both running mutations.
---
9+ in Int, for both core perks and stabilized. Though power user isn't as important without a gatling laser and could switch to nerd rage if you go bloodied down the line.
---
8 in Agi for adrenaline, and switching dodgy, action boy/girl or thru hiker as needed.
---
11 in luck for class freak, starched genes and bloody mess, then switching ricochet or one gun army as needed
---
Leaving you 5-6 points to spread however you'd like.
---
Better yet, how come when I make something from scratch It's broken and dirty.
---
Did you see any other photos of the metal mask mentioned in the description?
---
0.o other than the legendary PA like Solar and such, is there is a T- series PA that is gold only?
---
Jesus, I am behind on my gold farming... have too much on my list to buy already and stopped looking for things to add.
---
Sorry.
---
Just because the market subreddit doesn't have many PC folks you're allowed to break the rules. Rule 10, no trading.
---
It's interesting broken Chinese armor doesn't break the effect, but legit methods in the game do.
---
Can you explain this? I've done the daily's she gives for a while now, but ig I haven't picked up on that?
---
Why would you have something for sale for 25k if you have 12k on you? Consider the caps lost as caps spent on a math tutor.
---
How about if I‚Äôm just asking for charity then?
---
Awesome, I was building a new camp and was pretty bummed to figure out those display cases were useless.
---
i think they one of the CM's said in a stream they did, that those camps were fine.
---
stop trying to ruin peoples harmless fun OP. its lame.
---
u might of wasted on deep pocket in my view. 
---
get ultralight torso. then jetpack mod. need ultralight to change weight from 7 to 1.4lbs to carry scrip from the worthless rolls. if u always have plenty of scrip then skip ultralight mod and carry what u can. 
---
 once u get a worthy roll, get jetpack mod and u will never regret it. so much more value than any mod in the game. "cant leave camp without it"
---
Lol. The fact the you think I am offended is hilarious. It simply isn't relevant. It isn't any more relevant than the last time I played baseball is relevant to my understanding of the sport. I played the sport. I follow the sport. I'm interested in sports in general and baseball in particular. I follow the players and the managers. I watch the sport. How long ago I last threw the ball from home to second isn't relevant to my understanding what I'm talking about.
---
I went back tonight on my main character and they're all there. I picked up my missing holotapes tonight, so I'm down to just 2 remaining issues of the Unstoppables on Collector. Time to start learning the magazine spawn routes, I guess. :)
---
If you want to shoot a bunch of amno go and launch the nuke yourself.   It is not hard and you won't have to wait on the efforts of others for your enjoyment.
---
I just want the mod. Will they show up in the bunker? And how long do I have to spend server hopping lol
---
Just accept it....I‚Äôve accepted in full power armor I am no where near as  tanky as a low health build.  It‚Äôs fo 76.
---
Happening to me right now.
---
A lot of people still have holiday gifts to give them extra caps on the spot, or they could trade with teammates. Honestly if you sell good legendaries it's very very easy to hit max caps and then lose out on profits
---
Just go and collect heaps of water from a nearby river and use that. 
---
Also under Luck there‚Äôs two seperate perks that can repair your weapon or armour once it‚Äôs fired or hit.
---
yeah fallout is know Pb for never taking any sort of political stance. Especially 76 with a majority of the faction leaders being women of color as well as protests and pollution across the map.
---
imagine wanting to ruin one of the few fun things we can do with the very limited tool set we have to make unique camps. why do you want to kill other peoples fun?
---
I had a similar experience the other day. A much higher level douchebag in a Jester mask hung out in my camp, waited for me to work on the benches, and proceeded to shoot me with some weapon or another. It could have been my mutation effect as there was a fireball, but since I was in the Armor Bench screen, I could no longer see him clearly. (I'm level 151 and I've been playing since the Beta days, so I'm not new.)
---
I didn't even have anything on me and I just closed the game out, so nothing lost but my time. I was only doing housekeeping stuff to be able to start fresh the next time I played.
---
99% of the time, there are no issues and people come to my vending machines or my workbenches and water purifiers, and they're free to use all the time. I don't even lock my resources because I am overladen with water and junk, so it's a free for all.
---
No wonder so many of the lower levels run like hell when they see me. I just try to drop all sorts of plans and excess aid and they're running as fast as they can.
---
its easy if you can have an alt join the same world. i do it all the time to buy something that is more caps then my main has.
---
if you have an alt account, you could log them both in at the same time and buy someone out.
---
Just sweep the leg Grasshopper
---
And neither of you used the search function. 
---
;)
---
Only the specified type of rifles
---
Yeah, got a B2525 Gauss pistol in one of my inventories... my junkie. It's a terrible shame they're not at least tradeable among your toons.
---
Yea I got the tombstone for this reason it's super tall and easy to find
---
Well that‚Äôs unfortunate. At-least I didn‚Äôt waste perk points on it.
---
Well you ruined it already
---
So it would be a deliberate thing knowing that the vendor will not get paid?
---
LMAO!!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
yeah.  mostly vendors for me.  my latest build was mercifully spared from lag... but alas, i might not be so fortunate if i decide to rebuild this camp.
---
had a melon plant and a candle fell through the ground during my final touch up pass.  also ended up having to do two trimming passes to get it all built.  part of me really wants to try and swap out some foundations for floating floors, but the increase in things i could build, might not be enough to convince me to deal with the lag rebuilding it all.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch. It ain‚Äôt meant to happen. Get over it.
---
because you don't find one until you do this quest then they appear on bodeis
---
Think we‚Äôre already past that point üòÇ
---
Only rifles (semi and auto). No lmg or laser/plasma. If your rifle has 'anti-armour' perk then it cuts perk card % in half (last I checked was late 2019, might have changed, idk). *Bonus* it works for pistol style pipe rifles (which then also get both rifle and pistol perk card bonuses!)
---
There's anti-armor perk for each weapon type
---
They aren't vaults.
---
So if I find some way to glitch out of the map and kill you all I‚Äôd get reported but y‚Äôall got camp glitched out and that‚Äôs ok üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah ok buddies üòÇ
---
Probably had super duper on it works with creating power armor just created extra pieces
---
Does this give me more protection/mod options than having standard 1 item per slot?
---
They‚Äôre not active 
---
Jump into the frame, you will see no extras equip
---
what difference does it make to you if someone has an undergound camp? bethesda doesnt care about this glitch and neither should you it doesnt hurt anyone. its just people like you who want to fuck everyone else over because of "mEh ImMerSion"
---
get bent tosser.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I have a stealth character around your level and have cleared all of Whitespring, occasionally without ever getting detected.
---
Are you maxed agility and loaded with legendary sneaky armor?
---
The difference is they‚Äôre not hurting anyone. They just want a cool camp spot.
---
LOL
---
I didn't say it was GOOD at that, but that's the goal. lol How is it not an MMO? Too few people per server? What would be the proper term?
---
Oh your post just screams maturity üòÇ
---
the odds of any random spawn being legendary is 1% per 10 levels for that mob up to 50.
---
0-9 = 0%
---
10-19 = 1%
---
20-29 = 2%
---
30-39 = 3%
---
40-49 = 4%
---
50+ = 5%
---
This only goes for truly random spawns, such as enemies called during a horde event that have no modifiers applied.
---
Enemies spawned by the world can have various modifiers applied to increase or decrease their spawn rate. for example scorched will never spawn legendary by default, but events can spawn legendary scorched in scripted events, for example as the leader of a horde. And while love level enemies will almost never spawn legendary, they can do so during events, or in specific spawn locations that are scripted to spawn legendary enemies a higher % of the time than normal, although these locations have been largely removed because they were too farmable, being normal boss enemy spawns now.
---
If you want more specifics on where spawns legendary enemies, how events work, and other details those are handled server side, meaning they can change without an update at bethesdas whim, and are not visible to us in any way other than brute force observational experiment.
---
I've been having it happen in vats lately too. With my automatic rifles.
---
Irrelevant. This sub isn‚Äôt for bartering.
---
If I don‚Äôt have a jet pack, will this give me one then?
---
people shopping dont care about the sellers caps, they cant even tell how many they have. i guess if people wanted to grief someone that way with xmas gifts they could.
---
They're not charging up at all at the moment. You don't even really notice their face laser's charged up half the time before they're using their head laser attack. So there's two problems right there. 
---
-- No visual indicator that they are at their most deadly moment in a fight [Bright red head]
---
-- No sound indicator that they are charging up to said deadly moment.
---
But nah, I'm sure getting blasted by their head laser the instant you see an assaultron is intended, and definitely not bugged up the behind.
---
I would settle just for a chance at that croc backpack, missed the event and saw someone  in fascnacht with one looked great. Unfortunately all I find is head plans XD
---
How do you put it were you can stand and shoot on the drop site is there a picture to do it
---
So does a bandana
---
That and then they can get off on doing a deathclaw event where u start off fighting a horde of deathclaws and then a behemoth deathclaw 1.5 times or twice the size of a normal that health scales off the number of participants, awards could be a BP mod that restore health outside of combat, increased unarmed damage, thendeathclaw mask maybe a variant and a unique deathclaw hunter outfit made of deathclaw skin
---
Yeah man I‚Äôll help 
---
Give me 5 mins
---
imagine you post getting demolished and having to dig though post histories because you have no rebuttal.
---
just sad.
---
thank you so much
---
I see Todd sent out his boyfriends on Reddit again to defend Bugthesda
---
So make one by a lake üòÇ
---
I'll put this here for the sake of it fallout first would stop a server of lvl 200s from insta wiping the nuke zone
---
How old are the yt videos you watched? Because most of those videos are ancient and advise people to farm the Whitesprings golf clubhouse for legendary ghouls. That doesn't work anymore and got patched out.

üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ *your a funny one you are

Is this some kind of tank meme I'm too sneaky to understand?
---
Rifle gaming constantly mentioned white springs D: that is heart breaking to know
---
Thanks for letting me know, you just saved me many atoms!
---
What i think would make sense is that it would be 2 separate camps, a private one and a public one, they dont transfer over, its just 2 different designs
---
Message me your tag and I‚Äôll add you :)
---
As others have said, you can make vegetable starch. Plant yourself a garden and equip Green Thumb for picking and Super Duper for processing.
---
You can also ~~equip the Scrapper perk and (Nope, doesn't work for that; forgot it's weapons/armor only)~~ go around to different locations and pick up duct tape and wonderglue, of which there are hundreds.
---
Honestly, I haven't struggled for adhesive in a very long time because it is so plentiful in the world. Almost everywhere has wonderglue and duct tape, especially if there are desks or garages.
---
Let‚Äôs do this üòÇ
---
clearly everyone here agrees with you.
---
oh wait, this post is getting ram fucked because its a shit take.
---
Too slow in a team 
---
I'm 42 and when my friends and I team up we're lucky if we're even out of our camps in an hour. Then another 20 minutes deciding what to do. Then maybe we'll make it there or get side tracked somewhere else. Granted we all have a couple of character's all over level 200. But that's half the fun of playing is dicking around with your buddies.
---
Maybe I'm a stick in the mud but I kinda resent the utter clown show circus they turned the Fallout aesthetic into.
---
Also, I thought I was going to get a Fixer weapon from the Purveyor without knowing the plans. How silly of me. But how could I know. LOL
---
There should **not** have been a single shelf put into the camp system that either wasn't able to hold something on its shelves or came pre-decorated with something.  That was just lazy on Bethesda's part.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking the only reason I even modded my xo1 arms was to have a fully modded suit. Maybe it could be a plan you can find from those expeditions on the road map.
---
So far the experience seems good, lots of quests and things to do!
---
PS4 achievement rate for allied with Crater is 1.0%. Rate for Foundation is 0.4%. Reading reddit you‚Äôd think everyone is rocking gauss weapons. This subreddit is literally where the 1% go to bitch.
---
Gtfo with nerfing anything and swap your food build  and you dont even need any legendary gear
---
This is great and super helpful. It would be so excellent though, if you could go just one step further and sort this sheet by the ‚Äúworth bulking‚Äù column. Any chance of that?
---
What do... what do you plan on doing with that corn...
---
It's the latest fad, I see ppl standing around at Line in the Sand, Lode baring and riding shotgun.
---
Its always appreciated when they die and dive-bomb through the ground into oblivion. Thanks Bethesda truly a memorable game.
---
What do you want us to use, broken handmades and Fixers? Everyone runs steathboys too, now that they've been duped a metricfuckton.
---
Yeah there's an easy 5,000 hours of content lmao
---
Is your hard drive mostly full?
---
Otherwise, don't know. Try crafting the armour elsewhere. It doesn't have to be within Garrahan.
---
What platform and are you on right now? my ps4 camp is set up for adhesive farming - you are welcome to take what you need.
---
Has something changed recently? Very very early on it was worth doing a number of them but that since shrunk down to just 2 - aluminium and lead.
---
Are you sure this isn't old info?
---
At least people show up. I think I‚Äôve seen maybe three that other people actually showed up for.
---
use what you want, but I don't see the fun in just holding the trigger
---
Out of every multiplayer game ever made - a Bethesda one blows my fucking marbles. How anyone could rationally think this would end well is clinically insane.
---
They can‚Äôt even debug their games. They have been known for longer than most of you have been alive - for making broken games.
---
I would argue it can be a form of manipulation since, where it is true you see what you get in the description, they have a bad habit of showing off cool items that are not anywhere in the bundle nor the game and it would be understandable if they plan on releasing the content shown soon, however just like most preview images they have yet to do so.
---
If I'm not mistaken I think the shielded mod for the under armor is still in the public test server for PC only.
---
I want a radium rifle skin sooooooo bad
---
this lol.  the undercamps suck, especially if they have vendors, you travel to it, and can't find your way down to them.    buuuuuut.... yeah.  real bugs first, then they can come for this kind of goofing off.
---
The what now? lol. Im 2 days old on here.
---
I read about this happening there somewhat regularly as a bug....but no idea how to reproduce it consistantly
---
It's a surprise tool that will help us later!
---
If you can get a SINGLE person that can follow simple instructions you can get the best rewards out of the event with no hassle.   The more people that show up the more chances you get for idiots that can ruin everything.  I just ended a run where the entire server showed up and we timed out with just barely enough ore turned in and a single npc at less than half health.
---
I‚Äôve always found it incredibly annoying that Scorchbeasts turn into rubber bouncy balls upon death.
---
Yup. That's why I'm here! Haha.
---
I always drop a loot bag in front of my machine for the things I don't need, but won't sell.
---
Many people do.
---
Also keep an eye out for blue suitcases at NPC vendors. Lots of dumps there too.
---
But everyone else is right, vending slots are pretty important. And nobody wants to hold any weight for no value. So you aren't going to see zero cap slots often.
---
Are you referring to getting the launch codes?
---
It would be cool but they can barely get jumping and falling to work consistently.
---
Not that I know of. I only know its on the roadmap.
---
I was with people who just weren‚Äôt collecting any ore, just killing ghouls with explosive weapons...so I collected as much as I could.  went back into stealth, put it in the store then got up high and watched the irradiated deathclaws do their thing.
---
Was great
---
So you can have ultralight and the jetpack mods together?
---
Resetting the build mode can help. Also build walls, then roofs, delete the walls and that usually let‚Äôs me keep placing.
---
I just do the event with my friend...hes got a sick commando build with a legacy laser explosive...i tell him hold it down and ill go get the ore...anyone else shows up cool.
---
we regularly get 4/4 but no rad barrel yet
---
*Seems* to be more of it since Fasnacht
---
I heard from Bathesda and....   
---
" Please note that Bethesda Customer Support is not able to restore any items. "   
---
So,  Balcot is humped.
---
That's why I started using them, if you can't be em join em. Maybe pvp with get fixed when they rebalance the weapons.
---
It hasn‚Äôt really changed. The other items make a difference but it‚Äôs minuscule. If you‚Äôre holding enough of that stuff for it to amount to even a few pounds of difference, you‚Äôre holding too much of it.
---
The search function. It‚Äôs a feature in all subreddits. Usually at the top of the sub‚Äôs page. 
---
Makes things a lot easier to find and saves you time.
---
Worst one ive seen so far is a group at Feed the People who grabbed all the mixes and never deposited them...let the time run out while me and three others searched for any...now thats assholeish
---
i can forgive some low levels standing around...more exp for me an i always watch the objective...if i know i cant solo an event i dont go...the only one i cant solo is the queen (people always show up an i dont have fo1st)
---
Everything in this game just turns into people trying to farm legendaries. Even fasnacht had that issue. People that are like level 300 would wreck the level 20 sloth in a moment for no reason and newbies or people trying to grind new characters were just SOL.
---
You say this as if the materials you're using to build with aren't literally made from junk scraps.
---
lol calm down.
---
Have you learned the plan for the regular xo1 jetpack yet? This is just a skin so you still need the normal plan unlocked. 
---
Would it let you create a non-mothman jetapck?
---
What platform do you play on? I'd be happy to run Radiation Rumble to get those rare plans out of the way if you're on Xbox. I snagged the barrel plan myself really early on after Wastelanders launched, so I'd be playing to get that special hazmat suit.
---
RIGHT???
---
Might need the normal jet pack unlocked to apply it
---
This. Besides you can get launch codes at Nukacrypt
---
I know this is a little time on now but I second this post I have a tse tesla with shotgun barrel and after the wastelanders patch I was one shotting myself whereas before the patch it would only take a third maybe half at most
---
I like that it's small.and hard to see. Makes it more difficult for others to get your loot. LOL
---
Got my ally, my two scaver dudes (NPCs) and my scraptron robot thingy. They play instruments, sleep in their beds and for some fucking reason one of them likes to belch in my ear every now and then! :D
---
You don't need 4/4, data miners looked at the event when Wastelanders released and the only factor that affects your rewards is the ore turned in.  NPCs are just the failure condition.  If you hit 75 ore, which needs at least two people collecting due to the poor respawn on the nodes, then you can qualify for the rad barrel.
---
Frankly, you might get them in the first try or you can spend half a day and not be able to get it, purely luck (your real-life luck, not the SPECIAL stat haha). Yes, they will appear on the terminals inside the Command center (where you learn how to launch nukes and get the X-01 plans) under the modification sections. If at any point you give up on trying to find the mod itself, you can get the plans to craft the mod at all times on the production terminals.
---
I'm level 502 and still haven't figured out where that comes from but hear it all the time.
---
If it has not been changed scrapper only works on weapons &amp; armor
---
Both parties come off as punk ass bitches.
---
If you can't derive joy from ritual and repetition than this is the wrong genre for you.
---
I hope Ward turns out to be a synth. Guy sleeps too much to be human.
---
Hey, just a correction: you can buy a total of 300 gold from the NPC on the Wayward, not 600. I've bought from him twice now and been surprised by this fact but nonetheless my brain keeps farting in this aspect. By the way, which platform are you on? If by any chance you're on PC I'd be glad to play trough events with you, I'm pretty lucky and always get servers where people collaborate on events.
---
this event isnt even hard, i can solo it and still have npcs survive. you only need like 2 people to do the event 100%.
---
This. Lead &amp; Aluminum are the only ones worth bulking, and only if you‚Äôre willing to give up some Plastic. If you‚Äôre going to be selling to vendors, bulking is good. If not, it‚Äôs a waste for most scrap.
---
How is the possible? I feel like I played a lot during the lockdown and I‚Äôm just now working from neighborly to ally at Crater.
---
"Borne," not "beared." Just a heads up there. It's a weird outlier for past-tense words.
---
this has been suggested many times
---
Chemistry workbenches upstairs in the big two-story room and there‚Äôs a tinker‚Äôs workbench against a wall in the big vat room that opens to the back door.
---
Niice
---
I didn‚Äôt know that ty for letting me know I‚Äôm not usually on this sub
---
This. Just like backpack plans, you need the actual jetpack unlocked first before you can apply a skin
---
Thanks. I think i just saw the big vat room.
---
Bloodied:  lower your health = more damage per hit.  *Edit:  but you can die more easily.* 
---
Bloodied:  lower your health = more boosts to all SPECIALS except endurance.
---
A full-health player using a bloodied weapon is not getting any benefit.
---
you have to admit, RR is quite confusing at the start. first time playing it made me a headache. 15 guys jumping around, green goo everywhere and once i turned around to have a deathclaw yelling at my face. the second time i slowly got, what the objective is and since then i tried it 2 times, sitting in the locker next to the spawn and waiting if someone shows up - what didnt happened.  
---
im not saying the 3 guys were noobs, just wanted to mention that especially RR is quite confusing.  
---
but overall, i second your post - ppl joining events and go afk should be punished.
---
BFFR 50cal is a beast. You coulda got way more for it. Honestly it‚Äôs a trade only.
---
lol at dumbass people who keep defending the limit and want to game to have constant restrictions and limits that no previous fallout game ever had.
---
there is a reason that pretty much all mmos dont have such low limits on the main currency, its so people will grind out gold/money. i dont know why bethesda does this shit, its clear they dont have any idea what they are doing,
---
Haven‚Äôt touched it since I finished the story...
---
no, sorry to confuse. its one or the other. it took me maybe 30 or 40+ rolls to get 2 of 3 desired effects. 40x7lbs is a lot of carry weight to lug around. who knows how many it will take to get 3/3 effects. 
---
investing in ultralight torso mod helps me b/c i dont have gobs of spare light weight scrip on hand. since u cant sell SS armor, u either ditch it or scrip it.
---
 if u always have spare scrip to trade in then it might not be worth getting the ss ultralight mod.
---
Yeah.   I would love to have that 50 cal.
---
Well an MMO is literally "MASSIVELY multiplayer online" so I really wouldn't consider 30 people tops "massive"? Plus you don't see similar games such as Rust, Conan, Ark and so forth called MMO's and most of those have larger players per server too.
---
Why would your character realistically just duct tape concrete scraps together instead of using cement. Or take loose glass and stick it in place instead of a full pane. Even though we are taking scraps of something that doesn't mean we're just slapping it all together as the barn walls are made of none coloured wood scraps (which more often then not we find not in plank form) and we both cut it to size and paint it. Why go through the trouble of painting your home to look like a barn and then not use glass that's not broken.
---
That‚Äôs been requested since at least FO4.  I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs some programming/memory reason why it‚Äôs never been implemented.
---
Yea, shame on me for slapping the fuck out of some wanna be griefers ü§£. If you‚Äôre gonna send me butt hurt messages after you picked a 4v1 fight and got rinsed, I‚Äôm gonna troll you until you block me. It must suck to be such trash you have to accuse everyone who beats your ass of cheating, you PVE guys should stick to farming instead of failing at bullying lone players. Aren‚Äôt you always on here whining about people taking your workshops? You guys should really go play ARK or something.
---
I'm a mothman fan, and I'd buy into the Fallout 76 Mothman stuff a lot more if the cultists weren't instantly hostile. I got a bunch of the early Mothman Cultist stuff from the Atom Shop, and I wore the ritual bindings when going to visit a Mothman Cultist location for the first time and they still attacked me. Now I have a lot less interest in any of the Mothman stuff.
---
Not on a lever
---
Lone wanderer doesn't effect your damage dealt, you're also missing Adrenaline Reaction to make it deal It's full potential damage. And at full health Bloodied is less then ideal. Also Nerd Rage increases damage.
---
If these people had gone afk that would have been preferable, what they did was arguably worse.  If you show up to Radiation Rumble to notice that the other people are all hiding in a corner somewhere then you know the event is going to fail and you can leave.  These people were so not afk that I actually believed we were completing the event and stayed around wasting my time and resources so they could farm and watch the event fail.
---
They can handle it similarly to when someone has a camp in your spot when you join a public world. Give a pop up telling you your camp can't be placed in that location and why, give an option to leave and join a private server or stay without your camp.
---
Yeah year old here every time I use the search it just pulls up new subreddits?
---
Starch needs purified water, dirty, boiled or toxic won't cut it.
---
Do you meet / have the perks equipped? 
---
No clue other than that. Sorry.
---
Damn sorry I said anything? Im already downvoted into OblivionüòÇ
---
.45 Gutsys are too much man
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure I pick up cement bags, it might scrap into concrete but I'm fairly sure it's not already mixed and solid üòÇ
---
Ah, shit. That's right. I forgot.
---
Exactly, so why do we mix it and it becomes dirty as hell?
---
I can get on board with this! I use the SS jetpack too but avoid using power armour.
---
All hail the mothman
---
I usually look for rare clothing, plans, and explore. 
---
Collecting rare items for my camp displays.
---
Except...you know.. pistols, semi auto pistols, and explosive weapons
---
Cross your eyes a bit and it starts to look like Jar Jar Binks with flaming lips.
---
There is no good answer for that unfortunately. I get when we use scraps but it defeats the purpose having both dirty and clean options ingame and forcing us to use them like they are.
---
Personally I'd like it all broken and dirty but they can't really go back to that now in 76 so I'm just hopeful the next singleplayer fallout learns a thing or two.
---
Aw stick around a bit, there's tons of nice folk in here.
---
I think 2-4k is a solid price for it. It's fairly uncommon but people can grind for it so it's not super rare.
---
Just my two cents.
---
I'll give you 5k for one though if you're on Xbox.
---
Time it takes? The assaultrons you've fought actually charge their laser? Mine just instantly shoot it over and over until I'm a pile of Ash.
---
&gt;the most amazing thing about Fallout 76.
---
Pickings are pretty slim, lets be honest.
---
Do you play on pc ? because I bet you're a hoot. Hit me up if you ever want to romp with a level 444 hermit who occasionally likes to team up and slay stuff
---
I think it's just in FO3/4 that Deathclaws ignore armor. They might have some kind of armor bypass in this, but it's nothing like it used to be.
---
Which (kinda) sucks, the gauntlet in 3 had the ability to ignore armor, though I could see something like that in here being way too broken.
---
Called flairs, hit the three dots in the top right corner of the subreddit front page.

So, on a side note, I have researched just about everything there is to know about taming. Part of learning all the things I stumbled upon many different ways your tamed animal would randomly disappear, especially a deathclaw. I logged on today after about a month and a half to find my deathclaw has magically disappeared. So until Bethesda actually takes something like this post into consideration don't bother getting a pet since they now will randomly disappear even if you do everything right. I personally love the idea for the caged pet or maybe even a good bowl or something literally anything that would just let you repair it. It's not easy to find the one you actually want and now come to find out even if you take every single precaution any guide out there has to say about why you lose your pet you still lose your pet randomly.
---
They changed the pathing of the ghouls inside the clubhouse to be less of a gaggle.
---
You're wrong. Any mob can be one shot with either and when fighting something that can't be such as the queen or imposter, instigating only works once. Bloodied is the better option in every situation
---
Its the fact that when the community were shouting for stash limit increases they used server stability as a prime reason it could not be done. Only to turn round later and package unlimited junk (weight) inside of fallout 1st.
---
Never felt like a huge problem for me since i tended not to hoard and never really used power armour but the lack of honesty and increase in other shitty practices even outside technical performance will forever have me questioning their motivations.
---
You guys are right I‚Äôm a fuckin idiot
---
Thanks a bunch ü§ó
---
This. I know there's a mod to turn meat piles into balloons, and pretty sure there's one for loot bags.
---
Personally use the mod to just make them glow a pale yellow and makes them easy-peasy to find, even at range. Granted, if someone uses the ATX ones, those don't glow.
---
Go for the legs.
---
Not as much as I want to punch the Settler Wanderer and I would never lay a finger on a woman.  üòÉ The same incessant song is driving me insane. Lol
---
Happens to us all sometimes. No worries. 
---
At least you're one of the reasonable enough people to admit it rather than turning this into a 6 page complaint about how this is all Bethesdas fault.
---
If your fighting the queen with a lever you need your head examining. The lever is a one shot rifle. The best on it you can have is instigating. I‚Äôm not arguing with you. It‚Äôs a fact. If it wasn‚Äôt instigating would be below furious in terms of desirability in levers.
---
Oh ok thats not bad none of us care about xp when we are farming and most of us dont play on official teams just with our friends lists and following the leader as he hops.
---
The Atom Store features the same duck. It's 500 atoms right now.
---
*Bethesda advises we are looking into an issue relevant to the new Cosplay duck duplicating into multiple ducks, vending is disabled at this time.*
---
Definitely my fault for being an idiot haha. Thanks for the helpful advice though, seriously
---
Most people do. But most people don‚Äôt purposely go looking for fights and then get big mad when shit doesn‚Äôt go as planned üòÜ. I get killed all the time, but it‚Äôs always in good fun, some people just take this game far too seriously.
---
What do mike miners have to do with backpacks?

Hey thanks for clarifying. Unfortunately I‚Äôm on PS4. Hopefully one day we got cross platform on fallout

What's up with the huge herds of Ragstag?
---
the farm area you‚Äôll be there alot
---
It should work. Liberty prime and the horsemen do. Have you tried it?
---
You may want to consider trying a stealth commando build.  You still get to do stealth sniping but with more punch.  I used to be a stealth sniper and made the switch.  I use the Chinese stealth armor, and I carry a furious combat automatic (suppressed), anti-armor auto handheld (suppressed), and the anti-armor old guard's 10 mm just as a hold-out.  I scoped the handheld and  bumped it up to ultracite ammo.  I usually use the .45 for everyday kills and reserve the handheld for heavy hitting. I still get to snipe a lot but the auto option lets me double-tap most mobs, killing them faster.  Where I usually got my hindquarters handed to me daily, now I solo most everything I need to including silos.  If I get the drop on Assaultrons, I can usually take them down with a clip.  At a minimum I ruin their head laser and spare myself that problem.
---
BTW, congrats on an awesome day!

i was jumping around the last night seeing what ppl had for sale and come to a camp and hear her voice coming from behind me something about nice to have a visitor and  i dont see her... oh theirs a port-a-jon ... and shes sitting in it talking to me with the door open .....red dress fancy white glasses, covered in filth .. legs spread .. guess they dont program her to sit like a lady or at least close the door when she goes in the jon
---
that'll be 500 atoms
---
I already made a write up on the sub about it but the thing is people just downvote things like this since nobody wants their bloodied to be non-meta anymore
---
I'd like to show you up say say "Yeah but I'm almost 400" but you got me beat bud. You and me are on some wild trip and people are down voting us looking at us like we're a bunch of rubes out on the midway paying a nickel to see the bearded lady sing to a real life mermaid. It's only you and me bud. I'm not alone so at least I have some kind of self deniability to say I'm not a crazy person as I walk off into the freak show picking up all those caps in a crate you have to knock over to get them all. Then they go flying all over the place and I can't find them and say screw it. But seriously where do they all go? 
---
Anyways It's weird tho right? It's a windows sound 100%.

I solo run silos with my Chinese stealth suit, so it's more a matter of play style I guess.

Looks good to me. Pretty much the exact same as mine, but I don't run life giver.

As for lone wanderer you can always throw in inspirational and strange in numbers when on a team
---
You are not alone! I‚Äôve been having the same issues.This has been going on for 2 weeks now. I also have a pro. I seriously think something broke in the last update. I‚Äôve tried resetting my console, router, turned everything back off and back on again. Honestly not sure what else to do. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything we can do at the moment. I have just been reporting the issues and sending clips via ps4 report system.

I'm so hyped for the mothman stuff. PRAISE THE MOTHMAN

White Knight is a Perk under AGI that causes Armor to take less of a beating and cost less to repair. Very handy. \\m/

Was this before wastelanders dropped???

How long does it take you? I'm genuinely curious. I feel like the stealth style would take a really long time.

For Easter, if you‚Äôre good.

You realize the larger private 1st camp budget is gonna be all in internal instanced camp right? Not on the live game server but your instanced vm that since your paying a sub they'll splurge a little more for ya.

No facts for this just a long long history of watching video game companys pull shit, an basic understanding of it infrastructure, what would be least amount of work for them and pretty good understanding of how they can say and cliam what there claiming and it cost them the least to fulfill so in keeping the most profit.  I could be completely wrong here but don't think I am.

I don't particularly appreciate her calling me "friend" after I literally saved her life, jumped through hours of hoops and let her wear my clothes....  #friendzone

Well I legit throw all of my trash legendary items to my lv 4 mule to roll lv 1armor just for my berserker. Now I'm going to have to rethink my perks and addictions to increase my damage. It was okay for a bit but I wondered why I wasn't hitting as hard.
---
I walked by that house about a week ago while I was looking for good camp spots by the road! It's such a nice house, it's too bad the garage and home are boarded up, it's got such a unique look to it all
---
I‚Äôd rather get fucked up by a Deathclaw than an Assaultron. Getting absolutely deleted by a Deathclaw makes sense. Since it‚Äôs the closest thing to a living meat tank besides maybe a Behemoth or Mirelurk Queen. But an ASSULTRON? They‚Äôre just OP for literally no reason. A Deathclaw would 100% win against an puny skinny Assultron if it was realistic. (I know it‚Äôs a game, but come on you gotta admit there‚Äôs no consistency with the strength of the various things out In the wasteland)
---
I am a not so poor and very not so innocent soul, but I would also like to know.

Which is a bummer the data mined verta bird jet pack looked sweet. But since I've got a jetpack on my arm I won't be using it haha. Love my free chest space to much.

That being said if they come out with a pa I like better than my sh il leave it in a heart beat. I don't need an extra chest mod now that I'm not bloodied haha

Would I pay for a single player release, set 5 or so years before Vault 76 opens, so you could play and experience the fall of Appalachia due to the scorched plague?

Probably.

Yeah. Here is the write up I put on it as well if you‚Äôre interested

Personally I have my new main as a berserker build but it‚Äôs disappointing to see it fall out of relevancy endgame. You take all the damage, deal no damage, and can‚Äôt be in nuke zones until legendary perks come out.
---
all the time I can 1shot most things with my commando build but most of the time I need to shoot 10 shots to take something down due to the hp bar just keep refiling.   
---
This bug has been in game since day 1 so dont expect it to get fixed.
---
I totally understand, and I agree they are sold as functioning add-ons.  I think it boils down to what they can do, what they want to do, and what they have done.  So if I looked back and saw that most of these things we put out work, but sometimes they don‚Äôt...and it occasionally takes a long time to fix them, adding a function where the patron could return it, for instance, within an hour of purchase and putting a disclaimer on it I think would allow them to do their best but manage expectations...or something like that.  It‚Äôs not ok to sell it and just not care, but I also don‚Äôt want QC to the point that we are offered 30% of the items that work 99% of the time, as opposed to 100% which work 96% of the time.  I canny get through that last sentence without thinking about anchorman lol.  But I respect what you‚Äôre saying for sure and I appreciate you responding in kind.  Hope to see you out there in the wasteland!
---
This is why you don't accept random invites. If they'd place enough small letters in some hidden area of your camp, you'd be at max budget and have to scrap the whole camp to find it.

I've got a jffr and vffr. I absolutely love my flamers. They are perfect for hoards of enemy, and radiation rumble
---
Just let me use the tricentennial paint job on the T-65
---
I‚Äôm having a hard time comprehending you thought but I‚Äôll give it my best shot. The point is to keep the current cap limit. The extra caps that you gain from the vendors that cause you to go over the cap limit would be deposited into a separate account that isn‚Äôt accessible to the player until he or she spends the caps they currently have in their pocket. As I said in the post above they could invoke a 3 day limit on the excess caps to encourage players to spend the caps so they don‚Äôt keep piling up. This keeps the economy at the same level and will keep players happy.
---
Are they duplicated? There is an infintismally small chance that they are legit, like less then 1%. 
---
Does anyone in a position of power care? Absolutely not. Open to your hearts content. If they banned you, they'd need to ban everybody that opened duplicated presents and that means a significant chunk of players would just be gone.
---
and black titanium
---
Because if they added it to the existing they wouldn‚Äôt get that $5. Video games do this now. They release a game that‚Äôs buggy as shit with about 40% of it behind a paywall so you have to pay extra for the complete game. Maybe they‚Äôll fix the bugs but they will assuredly cram shit that‚Äôs ‚Äúworth‚Äù $5 in your face
---
Ugh.. thanks!
---
You are so misguided its insane.  Why do you think a be25 lever is the most sought after? Because its the best. I have 4 characters and one is a bloddied sneak sniper. Yes it's not the best option for a queen but if that is your build then you go with what the best gun is for your build. Furious is horrible on anything but heavy guns. You really have no idea what you're talking about but im done arguing, i was simply trying to offer this new player sound advice. Not argue moot points. Peace
---
Yeah, everything gets destroyed. You can either repair it &amp; use a bunch of mats or move your camp which stores everything in good repair, thereby saving you mats.
---
dig at night, duh
---
Raising cap limit to something easily achievable like 50-100k will lead to absouletly same situations, people will come here complaining they had 95k caps and lost tons of profit selling a 25k item from their vendor eventually. It won't change a thing.
---
There must be no cap limit period.
---
Wait, you can use Fallout 1st to trade items between toons? How so?
---
What does instanced mean?
---
Sorry I forgot to mention, Im not an english person :p
---
Preach it!
---
Mine wears just a party hat.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch, should you be pissed if it doesn‚Äôt work?
---
Shhhhh..... don't tell anyone about this in case they decide to fix it.  It's been 2+ weeks since I've had to actually do the foundation quest.  I consider it my little win since the grind in this game is soooooo long to get anything accomplished.
---
Now I know why I prefer Beckett hahaha XD
---
I have run into pretty much all of the new Random Encounter Vendors at the Camp Davenport sends you to for the Photo Opportunity daily. He sends you there if you offer to take pics of Crater. Its North of Sacrament in the Northern end of the Savage Divide.
---
I love the place - unfortunately doesnt get much vendor traffic as so far out the way. But certainly pleasant!
---
They don't say they do anything, but if you use them they heal like stimpacks
---
Yep and I bet u think bloodied is best for all
---
Weapons?  Tesla? Gamma?  It‚Äôs not an argument. The best, and look at the comments, is insta on a lever. On 95% bloodied is best. It‚Äôs all weapon dependant. Faster fire is highly desirable in almost every weapon. On a lever it‚Äôs worthless. Personally I think explosive on a sniper is also bad as it gives your position away every shot. When I ran sneak rifle I had, and still have somewhere an insta 50 vats fr which is imo the best sniper vats weapon. Again with vats 25 on. A lever really isn‚Äôt needed as your firing so slow staying in vats isn‚Äôt really needed. Now I run sneak bloodied commando. All the benefits of sneak rifle with a far higher dps weapon that is perfect for almost every situation.
---
I found a female settler vendor in a set of tents across the road from Gorge Junkyard.
---
As far as I know, most of them appear entirely randomly.
---
Server hopping work?
---
Even though i dont have that jetpack yet i definitely agree with this.
---
Photo Opportunities, from Davenport? Not sure that counts as a Foundation daily, for several reasons...
---
No, ive spent 3 days trying to get it to work
---
Buy the model assembly one, it looks awesome.
---
Good job man.
---
It's one of the places I'd go crazy decorating if we had access to mods or a creation kit tbh. It's got such a great homestead vibe.
---
Huge Borderlands fan here... level 15 on my first toon and not sure I want to keep playing. WHAT did they DO
---
All of them? I have the ones I need but am still missing like 3 plans lol
---
If you do the Queen alot you get like 3-6 improved repair kit each time she go down. I've got like 90batm and have thrown hundreds on the ground. Haven't repaired weapons or armour since we're released
---
Probably referring to the [Crocolossus backpack](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Safari_Crocolossus_backpack).
---
The NPCs in Fallout 76 are horrid. Just pure shite.
---
As far as I'm aware switching weapons is enough to fix the bug. Works for me at least when I hop in/out of PA.  Would be nice if it got fixed but I find this bug far less tedious than the fast travel bug.
---
Looking at statistics avalible online and assuming average of 1.4 accounts per person we would have average of 3000 regular players across all platforms and all regions and  + - 5000 occasional players jumping in every other week or so.
---
of that you've got 52% PlayStation share , 29% Xbox Share 19% PC share
---
39% US region servers , about 50% Australlia + Asia and the rest is EU 
---
You do the math.
---
I have some common and uncommon ones if you‚Äôd like to give those to him
---
Does this count for LMGs as well???
---
Thanks! Can you tell me where these percentages come from? Some things in the .esm are easy to figure out, but others are quite difficult. The lists for legendary loot are a little confusing, too. Let's say you kill  a legendary ghoul in the Cranberry Bog. What list does the game pull from for its item?
---
Its like some of the new interiors so what you see is unique to you.
---
Like the interior of the wayward or foundation for example.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instancing
---
Yes anything with fire rate over 200 for heavy guns, so lmg, minigun  gatling laser with 25 % faster fire rate, look up angry turtle magic weapons on youtube
---
This is the ‚ÄúHeart of the Enemy Quest‚Äù but I‚Äôm not following what you‚Äôre saying, mind explaining it a bit more?
---
Nah not really I was just heated and wanted to rant
---
If you need lead, I find the quickest is to go to lucky hole mine, have excavator PA on, and loot all the lead veins, repeat. I get 800+ per run
---
YES! Thank you so much! Worked.
---
IKR?  I can't help but accumulate as much scrap as possible. I want to fill that bad boy up
---
Honestly not a fan of the new stuff
---
1. There is info in the town about duchess BUT you are right that the quest shouldn‚Äôt appear until you read the info.
---
2. To be fair, all scorched people look the same in the game.
---
3. You can use the L1, L2, R1, R2 buttons on PS4 (or their Xbox one equivalent) to jump the scroll bar larger amounts.
---
Oh, okay. Thank you for explaining. I suppose I should have googled it but, as ridiculous as it sounds, I don't always remember I can. Lol
---
finish the daily burial quest with style?
---
Ricochet that shizz
---
Thanks someone just gave me one for free after i got scammed
---
Yeah.... like is this guy blind? No offense to OP obviously. But just turn on the ‚ÄúTag for search‚Äù thingy and just continue playing. After playing for 10-30 minutes you‚Äôll be swimming in duct tape n shit.
---
I've server hopped and can't get past the part where I pick up the card. When I get to the vault, all the enemies are already dead and the door is already open. Can't flip the breaker because the door to the room is stick shut and the key card reader is busted.
---
Sure! The only ones I have right now is giant, goblin jester owl skull soldier and sun. Trying to get like the death claw and old man king too
---
Trying to read this hurt my brain. It‚Äôs as if you glitched while typing it.
---
It doesn't even take that long to max your rep legitimately. I did it in two weeks and didn't even play every day.
---
"WHALE-FARE". I love that. Also:
---
Fallout 4 was great until the damn Creation Club. UGH that was such a dick move
---
I'll have to check that out. Thanks
---
Heck yeah, I'd totally wear it if it drew in deathclaws, that's a bonus.
---
the fact that they can chase me into a building that a deathclaw cant squeeze into is scary enough
---
if they made a super tanky tick i'd be pissed off because insects happen to know how to open doors in this game as well
---
Its cool. I think everyone does sometimes
---
I'd actually say /u/Wark_Kweh has been absolutely patient with you and went to great trouble to write out some very well thought out answers. Shame you don't actually 'get' any of it but oh well, I enjoyed reading Wark's posts on this, very insightful
---
Ohhh nice thanks
---
Try placing a mat down. Then the shelf on the edge of the mat. 
---
Mount the boards to the wall and load your guns. 
---
Grab the mat and move until the display case clips into the guns BUT not far enough to show the boards.  
---
It will look perfect. 
---
Come by my house and check it out. 
---
I like your idea too btw. Didn‚Äôt know that way
---
You had nerd rage proc'd on your Bloodied character... You obviously did not on your full health character. Also the base damage of a 50 Cal should be around 77 or so... You had some kind of debuff that you overlooked as well.
---
very cool! you should hook up older speakers for Appalachia Radio tunes too.
---
76's battle royale mode is baffling to me. I mean I know some people are really good at it but it's so ... clunky. I can play other games in multi-player... I've won a few rounds of COD:MW in my day... I can do Dying Light etc. But Nuclear Winter, man I can't hit shit. I can't hit a damn thing so I hide the entire time. It's embarassing lol.
---
I disabled her and worked on Beckett for a quest or two, then reloaded her console. That worked for me when she glitched.
---
I'm surprised Beth hasn't introduced the Creation Club to 76... mods for sale for F01st or some shit.
---
Until supermutants discover secret wonders of stealth boi :D ... Then bunch of nightkins will terrorize appalachia :D
---
Real talk thou they needa fix this... Been around forever (reload and ft bug)
---
I do have an old telefunken portable radio, which i upgraded with a 3,5mm jack, which i could use.  
---
Thanks for the Idea!
---
Thx
---
Lol, I think I know which one you're talking about. was about level 35 last time I tried and I might has well not bothered since the breeze did more damage then I did.
---
I want this so bad
---
Hope it works.  She glitched a lot for me and that was the only thing that worked.  Good luck!
---
It's a huge deal for heavy users, especially in PvP.
---
I would expect the sentry bots to be far more lethal given the amount of lead and explosives they can put downrange.
---
Sometimes it seems like they can charge it without warning you -- I've noticed that some are able to charge it without glowing or making a sound.
---
Have you tried giving her a back rub? It sounds like she is hitting on you.
---
Yeah... that will be expensive... forget caps...
---
There's some serious ways to cheese it. Power armor glitches can rush you to the final event in less than 5 minutes.
---
Explosive weapons shred the room where you have to break cores.
---
I would like to have the free states combat shotgun skin coming back,   
---
because i have found a nice combat shotgun and i would like to paint it somehow.
---
Hello
---
1. I encountered ,, cant respawn bug ,,. I ve done a bit digging and found out that it happens when you have equiped perks or stats with weight reduction to certain group of items.
---
2. I ve encountered .. cant respawn bug ,, but it was different, I was not able to spawn at all, only thing that helped was restarting the game. This happened to me just once and I am not aware what it caused.
---
Start private, use in world container. Leave server (you have about 5 minutes) change characters, return to private (don't f&amp;$k that step up and go public) retrieve items from said container. I have it disconnect me entirely from Bethesda and I quickly rejoined and got the same private server. Never had a problem in six months. That being said it's a risk, but it's just a game.
---
They ignore armor in NV too.
---
Idea: Have the legendary from a killed enemy deposit itself into your inventory upon death.
---
\#2 is a mod available on Nexus Mods.
---
For heavy your better off going PA with emergency protocols, since the int perk stabilized (armor pen and accuracy) only works with PA. If you want to not use PA the rad resist from regular legendary armor is not worth going for, I personally found that if I'm not using PA with my bloody heavy that I like bolstering, with just uny I get shit on (not much stealth with heavy)
---
What am I doing wrong?  I grind for days and only get to 5k.  The idea of having 25k just blows my teeny tiny mind.
---
I want to actually raise a deathclaw pet from an egg... been saying that for forever.  I also want legendary chainsaws but I never get what I want üòÖ
---
some of the most annoying shit in the game honestly. hitting enemies for a bunch of damage and watching it undo itself before your eyes.
---
Okay I‚Äôll add you when I get online tomorrow? Sorry I‚Äôm not on now. But I want to say I have the toothy man one and witch for ya. I‚Äôm trying to get the winter man and the raven :(
---
I scour the land looking for new places to build. I love building in places no one else has or few have... I just discovered a place I've never seen a camp at; along the rail road tracks near Monogah overlook. It's a tall railroad building with no doors or windows but there's a hole in the roof you can get through...once inside you can get back out via a jetpack or fast travel. I put my nuclear generator in there... never going to have to repair it as long as I stay camped there, which is a huge plus lol
---
Great, thanks! It never occurred to me to try. But I do need to transfer a jillion Fasnacht masks lol
---
I'd prefer it if I didn't have to use a huge portion of my camp budget just to fill shelves. A static shelf with specific decor on it would probably save some of that.
---
I'm having trouble keeping up with all the changes in Wastelanders... how do you use the claim tickets if you don't mind me asking? Thanks in advance
---
what patch/update? don't see anything for today or recently
---
It‚Äôs a giveaway where you say your opinion on the upcoming patch to get rid of some stuff for pvp
---
&gt; Either that or she just hit her head really hard when she took off again and got scared lol
---
I NEEDED a laugh, thanks ; )
---
https://imgur.com/a/hnJrDhR
---
Forgot about the raven! Okay thanks appreciate it! Definitely looking for a winter man as well.
---
Or like Borderlands 3, have it go SOMEWHERE you can find it later.
---
I have found the Scavenger Trader frequently:
---
* in the dry riverbed between Flatwoods and Charleston, just on the edge of the treeline facing Flatwoods
---
* on the northern side of the river up from the Wayward, along the river, heading toward Slocum Joe's
---
* on the southern side of the covered bridge near the Wayward, along the river toward Flatwoods
---
So far I've encountered a general goods vendor, selling a plan for the Bow, a Chems vendor selling chems and the recipes for them and an apparel vendor.
---
What ballistic weapon actually does any damage to her though? I use a Zealot's cryolater on her, personally
---
I use enforcer plus limb targeting perk and my exploding shootie to wing her...she comes down pretty quick after that. Also, people can use explosive bait to get her down... in case people didn't know...
---
Wait, red dresses off claim tickets? You can get the red asylum dress with pleasant valley claim tickets?
---
it‚Äôll still be there, you can access whenever but you can‚Äôt add anymore until you renew it.
---
it stays in the scrap box. you can take stuff out or craft with it you just can‚Äôt put anything in anymore.
---
&gt;I skip through his dialog (which you really shouldn't do if you want reputation) 
---
I skip all dialog... no wonder I've hardly got any reputation with the settlers lol
---
I have a small buzzblade problem... I now have a good bloodied, junkies, and vampires that I have acquired and sometimes it's fun to just run around shredding things.
---
That's what I don't understand. It's it like nocturnal, except +75% when low health,  -75%when high health? I took off one of his heavy gunner perk cards, and it surely lowered the damage. The way I figured, I was getting a base of 35 or something.
---
Well they have to put some kind of cap on it. Borderlands 2 was great with like a 999,999,999 limit but anything over that WAS counted only just not on the official counter because it didn't go that high
---
Nice to see a fellow Buzzblade enthusiast
---
We can team up sometime and i can help you level if you'd like, my ign is: mageharmonic
---
I'm in U.S cen timezone and play at random times though not on right now. I play a standard heavy gunner / power armor character.
---
Yeah the last major back pack everyone wanted was the croc back pack you had to farm mile miner treasure hunters in the ash heap I grinded for days with out sleep and didn't get it so I'd rather not go through that again lol
---
Yes
---
Oh yeah, adrenal reaction, I forgot. Both characters have it, but it doesn't trigger at high health
---
Make 5.56 ammo and sell for it one cap each people buy it.
---
IF you are on PC you can go into the game files and have grass not render. This helps tremendously to find loot bags :)
---
No, it does not reduce damage at full health.
---
I really don't have time for trading. I haven't been to r/fallout76marketplace in so long, I forgot how to properly format a post
---
In new Vegas that would be the scariest thing ever, fallout 76 fails to deliver that terror unfortunately.
---
I like the premise though.
---
Reminds me of Jurassic part 3 where the young archiologist takes the raptor eggs and the pack follow them across the island.
---
You are on PC? I'm on PC, I'm 57 and high level. I play almost daily and love making new friends. If you'd like to hang out, my IGN (In-game-name) is ZeddtheRED. shoot me a friend request :)
---
I mean... trap camps and destroying people‚Äôs camps make sense in the lore
---
Well, yeah, setting the limit to some unachievable number for most players (except obvious hackers) would be fine. Also, it might—ç–º—É made it easier to track and ban said hackers.
---
This is how it works with the private test servers so we know they can do it
---
Sometimes u gotta take inspiration from great movies happened alot in older games unfortunately now they just have the same repeated formula go here kill stuff go there pick plants
---
i'd be ok with an internal instanced camp if it had an entrance that enticed people to enter from the main map
---
Reddit marketplace has been dead for a long time I feel. I haven‚Äôt traded anything in close to a year but still come here to browse since it‚Äôs my only social media I use now.
---
I had an issue with this a while ago, turned out to be my internet connection. Did a full reset of the router and deleted/rejoined the network on the console and have barely had an issue since. 
---
Sucks you're having issues but give it a go, got nothing to lose
---
I"m so ready for a bot you can summon to pick up your scrap and take it back to camp for you
---
This is the best source on the topic at the moment.
---
The only thing that still scares me. I've punched the SBQ in the face, but if I can't sneak up to a yaogui I run away.

Going to report this to the Devs. Thank you for this mate

Fair statement but we used to help each other to fight common enemies it‚Äôs not like NPC raiders are coming to do it
---
Happens all time with my shotguns in and out of vats
---
True
---
This is so awesome :D
---
Lmfao
---
Awesome, I appreciate it.
---
your kidding I had no idea about the small backpack been grinding to get the normal one
---
My psn is x-Rickrock-x,  if you ever need help with something let me know
---
There are so many levels of noobism.
---
This this this. Target the combat system in VATS and turn her lose on all the other robots.
---
Trade only? I got pretty damn lucky then to get it for about 6k caps from a vendor
---
It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that your opinion is only that, your opinion. 
---
Nuclear Winter isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù at all. I understand the vocal wish more attention was paid to it which I can understand. 
---
Bethesda have shifted away from pvp in adventure mode, but they expressed surprise at how few people were interested in pvp. Remember, they have statistics building up from raw player data, not ramblings on reddit. 
---
Additionally, survival mode was discontinued because very few people used it. 
---
A better suggestion though equally pointless may be ‚Äúcan all you other players please play more like me so the elements of the game I enjoy can get more attention?‚Äù
---
Any limit will be a limit. Unlimited is the only option.
---
Good for you
---
you just have sell a decent weapon or armor to someone. you have to start learning what is valuable and what pricing will be like, then undercut from that.
---
Just spread those around to new players. You only need one set.
---
On xbox
---
VATS is worse tbh. At least it‚Äôs broken rn so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it, but they should make teslas not arc off of the ground. Teslas also seem to damage armor very quickly, and the high stagger rate makes effects like sentinel and assassin less useful than raw ER.
---
Scavenging for junk I need is half the appeal for fallout for me, so I don't think I'd ever buy it even if I had infinite caps.
---
Is this your first MMO? Welcome to the endgame that never actually has a "game" to it. Every MMO is the same. Log in for the same repeatable dailies and earn the multitude of currencies to buy today's best gear. Next update, it starts all over again. Every MMO I play, I catch up on the story, spend a reasonable amount of time getting good gear (I never go for the highest tier stuff, it always gets outdated fast) then log off until the next major update or expansion. Case in point: FFXIV I never go hog wild trying to get the best gear after finishing the storyline in each expansion because when the next expansion drops, the first random npc you find ends up selling you gear that's better than the previous expansion's "endgame" gear. It's just ridiculous how devs never value your time in MMOs.
---
The problem with pvp is it was a fun game mechanic that quickly became a way for trolls to screw with other players. For every one player that wants to show off their builds and battle against other willing players. There are way more that want to be jerks and ruin the game for others.  nothing chases off new players like taking over a work shop only to have it stolen by some high level player. Jumping servers then have it stolen again by another high level player. I don‚Äôt mind if Bethesda keeps pvp. There just needs to either be a separate mode for it or some major changes need to happen to it. 
---
I think Bethesda should do a few things to keep everyone happy 
---
1. No more contesting workshops or pvp in adventure mode. 
---
2. Bring back survival mode in some capacity. Make adventure mode 100% pvp free and make survival pvp mandatory. 
---
3. Adventure and survival mode should both have an arena where players can fight it out with each other. Allow players the option to tweek the setting as well. Have a terminal where players can select the conditions of the fight. Things like weapons break faster, slow health draining over time, randomly spawning in enemys. Everything from mole rats to the grafton monster. Maybe even have the option for players to win prizes. Like repair kits, ammo, scrip.
---
Sadly, you can not trade new gauss weapons. Only one gauss rifle can be traded.  
---
But I can be wrong, I do not play on xbox but it should be the same.
---
What ones? I'm on ps4
---
This.
---
Bloodied is so much superior to other affixes that got their drawbacks since it's basically stripped of any (higher risk of dying is not even worth arguing about, death is a mere inconvenience in this game and also there are tons of stuff you can use to prevent health loss at low hp)

I agree and that was well spoken. They need to make a change to it and not take it out completely.
---
What item doesn‚Äôt work, might be able to help
---
It's meant to be a way you can show off the results from your grind. If you can sell it then Gold Bullion and all the plans are useless
---
If we're talking realism, deathclaws and a majority of the mutated animals would die to bullets/lasers rather trivially. A .50 calibre-converted rifle would be one-shotting every mutant possibly short of a scorchbeast at a baseline.
---
As it were though, the assaultron being so strong doesn't really make sense in the context of everything else around it (in the sense of military grade equipment and robots) not being near half as strong. It makes me wonder why the US Army wasn't focused around those things instead of PA infantry.
---
Not really, what about the BOS and Wendigo Colussus events?
---
Croc BP is a treasure hunter item, cat BP is from the atomic shop.
---
Well darn
---
Occasionally Grahm appears out of nowhere at my camp and goes to town on my rustic water mill.
---
Like I KNOW it‚Äôs meant to turn dude but hitting it doesn‚Äôt fix it this time
---
Can't wait for another power armor skin
---
I'd expect PA to be a near-unstoppable form of protection if we're going by that metric (seeing as they were the main focus of the US military and it's surrounding research companies), and it just isn't.
---
It's Pride Month though. Every corporation is doing something to show they pretend to care or are aware. Not trying to diminish Pride Month or anything but it's just a stupid tactic that corporations do to tug at your heart strings to get you to open your wallets.
---
Assaultrons are easy.
---
Now Mister Gutsy with ballistic weapons, that's another story.
---
But in all seriousness, I worry about the DoT from the Mirelurk Kings than Assaultrons.
---
Second point should be unyielding.  (I know you know, just pointing it out for people reading)
---
Since unyielding provides so many other benefits I like it over bolstering. I am currently rocking a mix of both with secret service, and when you utilise dodgy with such high ap, I find it works well, then you get all the other unyielding benefits like more carry weight etc. Plus serendipity helps
---
unyielding is way more op than bloodied people just forget about it

My camp is on the river right across the street from Slocum Joe's that's just north of Wayward. I've had it there since like the first month of game launch so it's awesome having a vendor in Duchess so close. I get the Traveling Merchant and ATHENA at my camp all the time. Also I'll get a trader camp plopped down right next to mine. It's where I got my Hunter's Long Coat and I've seen her sell a clean ranger outfit, fisherman's outfit, purple and white ski outfit and the clean spacesuit and helmet. Once when I logged in I had the traveling merchant and ATHENA at my camp, the trader camp up next to mine and of course Duchess down the road. Being so close to four vendors like that is awesome. It's got to be a popular spot for camps as I usually can't drop my camp and have to switch servers.

I remember when making bulk items with super duper equipped would give you duplicates.
---
Endless resources!
---
I know my opinion on something is just an opinion but I‚Äôm not asking for other people to play my way I just want bethesda to pay a little more attention to the PvP side of the game.
---
Hmm.
---
Obviously bloody SS armour would be the BEST for you but...you‚Äôre best off getting armour that has the effects needed first, and best DR second.
---
Bloody, AP refresh (or poison resistance on two pieces).
---
975 with the current discount, I'm trying to earn another 105 atoms to get it, whats the problem with it? Is it the smoke machine?
---
üëç
---
I do spread them around! But I like to spread them via my alts. Everyone runs away from my main lol
---
Overwatch is a great game
---
‚ÄúSandwiches, subs, hoagies, and grinders are all the same at Sunny‚Äôs. They are all ravioli.‚Äù
---
The Secret Service Backpack also clips through scout armor. Backpacks in general need a big overhaul.
---
Days gone, god of war, the last of us, uncharted series all amazing playstation exclusives
---
you can't get close to half of the stories in this game if you just follow quest markers and mow down mobs. you can probably get all the participation trophies or whatever they have on consoles that way but this game is a lot more about environmental storytelling and putting things together for yourself. i was bored to shit by fo4 and 76 is my favorite one so YMMV
---
Lol
---
IMHO you dont really need the CSS. I also run stealth unarmed ninja. Five pieces of Uny SS plus sneak perks do the job just fine. CSS may be better but I like the added protection from SS armor.
---
Jup. They simply have no clue
---
But of course. Unyielding is a staple for a bloodied build, but we were speaking about weapon affix specifically.
---
Good call. I now that problem well , my solution has been the gift with the gift emote and no mask on.
---
I can't use the bed, but I can use my other buildable beds :(
---
Yeah see. I don't even know how to trade anymore. I just kept it, so I wouldn't go over my cap limit. If I had thought to do it after getting my bullion, I could've charged 16k
---
Yo. You on PC? Got lots of freebies.
---
Ah. Never got far enough in NV to get one.
---
Just get binding of Isaac and call it a day
---
Does it say it the Atomic Shop those things are included? No. Not false advertising at all.
---
Yeah man. If im in a private, ill be trading or XP farming. Public games is where I team up. You'll inevitably have to meet my friends, usually 4 of us that play. They are chill stoners though üëç
---
IGN is Sergeant-cabbage
---
unyielding is so powerful with adrenal reaction nerd rage serendipity radicool etc. you can use basically any weapon the bloodied star is almost extraneous except against mega bosses
---
You can buy the crock bp plam from a player. It will cost an arm and a leg, and your soul.
---
The cat bp is an old atomshop item. It may return some day. It is not that expensive (500atoms). You can get that much until it returns.
---
I made my entire build to survive these guys. I use full set of vanguard's SS buttressed armor, dodgy level 3, scaly skin and grounded. If I'm strafing I can tank two blasts before I'm a bit under half health. I've been testing it and I couldn't survive a sustained blast (just standing in the blast on purpose) until I surpassed 700+ ER.
---
Heh sounds great. I'll look you up.
---
Please, we need more dangers, not less, don't nerf them.
---
It's my level. People just run or log out lol. But yeah I forget about the gift emote
---
There was an exploit last Christmas that took place in glassed cavern whereby one would go through it, not pick up any ultracite, scorched would spawn get the xmas gifts andthen jump into the lava like pit. 
---
Then respawn at the entrance to the cave and do it all over again. Maybe this was what they were doing.
---
Fully agreed. It‚Äôs too bad this subreddit is filled with excavator boys and beta males that just want to play barbie dress-up and farm their black titanium instead of surviving a ruthless apocalypse.
---
While I agree with you in principle... You don't really think this exact message is going to get them to do anything, right? Your message looks like it was written by a 12 year old.
---
Also, they have mentioned perk card loadouts are coming, to help with swapping them back and forth, so there's that. If you're on PC, there's a mod for that.
---
Ok so option to join the Mothman Cult coming when?
---
Yeah...I know why we can‚Äôt have nice things...but I can still dream! Lol
---
Roh!
---
umm, as a note on the clean ranger hat, it can also be found in a porta loo near the the radio relay tower near tyler county fairgrounds
---
My mates Dbol and Lordo can destroy it in like 43 seconds.
---
Hey sometimes your statement needs to be loud enough for them to hear
---
The Liberty prime shadow should come with the marketed silent mode. But while you can craft helmet that won't do voice lines, the chest still triggers them.
---
I've made ticket of that previously and answer after two weeks was "we cant forward these messages, you should try to send feedback form"
---
Just another thing on the list of exploits Bethesda keeps ignoring. If you have a karma syringer, you can hit someone and then throw a nuke mine/grenade at them. Even if they haven‚Äôt engaged in pvp, it will kill them. You can also catch a bounty, and just keep hitting people until you find someone running electrically charged. That mutation will ‚Äúattack‚Äù you and if you‚Äôre wanted, it will force the unwilling into pvp. I think trap bases are hilarious, and i love pvp, but this griefing bullshit by abusing exploits is just trash.

I'd love to see a video of you playing on that üòú

---
This is correct. Gauss Pistol, Shotgun and Minigun, plans or weapons, cannot be dropped or traded.
---
What I'm saying is that Bolstering on Secret Service Armor is already overkill and a waste of a good legendary slot. :-)
---
Scaly Skin to offset the DR/ER penalty of the high capacity backpack mod sounds defensible to me (even if I personally think that good inventory management is a better long-term strategy than hunting for every bit of carry weight capacity).
---
Life Giver is essential for bloodied builds due to its interaction with Speed Demon. I would leave it off with a full-healthy Junkie build. The best defensive perks in order are Serendipity (for low health builds), Blocker (against melee attackers like ghouls), Dodgy (if you don't have a better use for AP) and Fireproof (good against Scorchbeast screams), in my opinion.
---
i think these apparent discrepancies are due to rounding while having weight reduction perks on. for example the pipboy reports cork scrap as .01 when it would be more accurately .008  
---
it's just aluminum and lead unless numbers have changed in the last two updates
---
What level?
---
I do believe I launched my first nuke with a base Combat Rifle with a few mods and a level 10 combat armor chest piece on.... Just the right perks together is enough to get the win in PvE. Most things work at endgame. 
---
As for what I've seen with bloodied etc, I'm afraid that if I try it the game will blue screen (too OP to function lol).... Yes, there is a significant upside to it (and other types) if you wish to invest the time, caps and tears into chasing godrolls. I for one am far too fuckin lazy and can't stand mmurghs face anymore.

If peeps want like &lt;20% of a health bar I think they're paying their price for the power.

---
As somone who usually has a team i am glad the solo players have a group finder type option. I dont think we need incentive to group up outside of it. If anything the bonus should be with ranos as tou are less likely to have the efficiency and full participation than that of a premade
---
learn how to read
---
The only time I can think of this bug happening is when you enter or exit PA which isn't something you should be doing in the middle of a fight, PvP or PvE. Is there any other time it happens?
---
I think they said that technologically it's extremely difficult to add more camp space at this point unfortunately
---
Whats the explosive meta? Yes for explosive secondary demolition expert is the perk. But iys not a huge dps increase as ita a % of a %
---
Actually it's a pretty simple statement, and if its incoherent to you I'm sorry I'll try to simplify it for you. Bethesda add passive card slots. Simple enough for you?
---
Sorry I meant to say buttressed not bolstering! Thanks alot for all the help!
---
FO4 had a side quest like this. I‚Äôd love something like this. For instance, a Mr. Handy asks for help walking fluffy, whom has become too tired to walk and needs to be carried in this backpack. Please take her home. Reward for dealing with waves of deathclaws thinking it‚Äôs their baby and other predators trying to kick you out of their territories on the way to momma deathclaw matriarch is a buildable deathclaw nest that spawns an essential deathclaw at your camp as an ally plus a deathclaw baby pack.
---
Clone the quest for sloth.
---
I have one legacy left... Hhmm
---
They disabled queat sharing of the leader so his choices don't affect yours for wastelanders. Even though the choices are not too much do or die.
---
So the Mothman plushie is a backpack skin, hmm, tempting, also I'm loving the blood-red brick wallpaper, very tempting. Time to spend more of my Atoms, yay!
---
Well it's just I see a lot of people go for the explosive stat when it comes to big guns, I'll start maxing out that perk, see how it goes.
---
I‚Äôm an old diehard (which it did) Diablo II player Trapsin wwsin Firesorc classic WWbarb PvP is in my blood and PvP doesn‚Äôt exist within fallout in any way shape or form. 
---
I‚Äôve seen some brilliant trap camps but it‚Äôs griefing every time and it‚Äôs not funny and annoying.
---
Thanks for the info I have a difficult time keeping up.
---
When will you be on
---
I just got the game yesterday. I‚Äôm a long time fallout fan. The perk system is odd, and I do prefer the other methods. I am a very visual person I liked being able to see them laid out, and what level you need to be to unlock the next rank of a perk. 
---
It would be nice if we could build different ‚Äúhands‚Äù, and be able to swap them out or something  
---
But what‚Äôs baffling me is the storage limitations. I hate not being able to have my designated boxes for different things. Saved guns. Guns for dismantling, saved meds, etc. 
---
I‚Äôm breaking down weapons as soon as I can pretty much. But holy shit I‚Äôm used to saving and hoarding in this game. I already hit capacity on my ‚Äústash‚Äù. Is there any way to deal with this? I‚Äôm very new to the game, and the community so sorry if this seems like it‚Äôs coming out of no where.
---
I'm confused, are you saying the people who have the benefit of having friends they can group with should get more of a benefit than people who use the group finder?
---
time to take a break. you can return whenever the battle pass started with new content.
---
I got fallout first for it but if u been breaking stuff done then bulking it, it should help with the weight problem
---
Just sent you a PM, would be happy to team up.
---
Losers on social media? Say it's not so. Oh right, this is a social media platform, meant for everyone, but sadly includes the self-entitled petulant butt-hurt snowflakes, oh well.
---
It would be... cute? :-)
---
If ur on now I can give u some plastic for the bulking
---
Don't pay attention to the images, its not false advertising if you simply assumed something was included because it is in the images. There is a listing of every included item in the description for the bundles on the atomic shop, that is what you need to be looking at.
---
More garbage that only be obtained through money money money
---
I'm on quite randomly. My IGN is ZeddtheRED. Maybe see you in the wastes!
---
Stan Smith, is that you?
---
444 or so
---
*Scrapes it with a cap
---
This game used to have quest sharing? Damn, I only started after Wastelanders and was intitially levelling alongside 2 others, quest sharing would have made the experience 100x better :(
---
Do you really only play this game for PvP??? Seriously? So what do you do? You keep shooting to other players and see if they want to shoot you back? I‚Äôm sorry but I will never understand this....
---
fuck this glitchy game, started playing after the update and currently lvl 125. wish they cared about this game
---
I want a big flag that says 'been playing this steaming pile of garbage since beta' and lol.
---
You had 12K caps on you already, and yet you were actively selling a 25K cap weapon. So if that 25K cap weapon sold, you would've already lost 7K caps, regardless of whether that 15K cap weapon sold at all.
---
Having that 25K cap weapon for sale when you were well above 5K caps was your own mistake.
---
Never going to happen, they did that and they'd lose a very significant portion of subscribers - myself included.
---
I just got off üò¨ sry.ill try to be on tomorrow, my life fricken sucks rn
---
I‚Äôm working on breaking stuff down now lol i keep forgetting about the bulk processing. 
---
I‚Äôm probably going to get off in a bit, but thank you. 
---
If you play on ps4, you can dm me your name and I‚Äôll add you.
---
Sorry man I'm on xbox

Ty for the offer btw:)

Ahh no worries

Well for the queen (mine to explosive)  I look for faster fir rate and such

This is what happens when I click your link https://imgur.com/a/zMIMiE0

It's honestly surprising OP isn't asking for the players/NPC shown in the images to be included as well.

I love your videos, the attention to detail, the small funny stuff is what I love the most! There's a friend's music project you may like actually;

---
It's a 12% increase in damage at lvl 5. It's usually not worth it on most builds.
---
Look. The fact we can work as a group is amazing.
---
Once u get more into it and start having to constantly swap out cards you'll understand why this post is
---
Until they're something better to hoard at a z level we will have stash for stuff
---
Hahahahahaha well summarised.
---
What unique effects does the free States jetpacks have ü§î
---
While they're at it, make it actually acts like a skin and not require you to craft a whole new one.
---
I like to cripple all the ghouls with enforcer then kill them one at a time with my ghoul killer switchblade lol. Good stress relief
---
Exactly.
---
Whether one agrees with the 30000 cap limit or not, we can all agree that having something for sale for 25000 caps, while already having 12000 caps, and while clearly being aware of the 30000 cap limit, is just a clear mistake.
---
Had the only weapon for sale been the 15000 cap one, the OP would now be sitting pretty on 27000 caps, while still having a 25000 cap weapon in the stash.
---
Mistakes were made. Time to admit them and move on.
---
Right now I'm running that 50 Cal and anti armor faster fire rate minigun, then I think I'll unlock Gauss Minigun and see how it goes.

Yes, and tearing them down is as much erasing history as eastern Europe traring down statues of Lenin or Stalin

You can‚Äôt .The seller should have had enough time to take his store down even if the buyer opened gifts right on the spot. It must have been two people or....

New here?

&gt;When finally getting to Welch for the first time you are given a quest to find the duchess' treasure. There is nothing else that triggers this short of simply arriving in Welch
---
Well thanks, I had no idea lol. *headed over to Welch
---
About an hour ago I was thinking about it, because right now I feel like the hack/lockpick cards are taking up space that I could be utilizing better.
---
That will do it, I'm 285.
---
When people talk about bloodied being super strong they're normally talking about weapons and not armor. People who use bloodied weapons normally use unyielding or bolstering armor, or power armor in the case of most heavy gunners.
---
On a similar note are they aware of the Flamer range glitch? Non-default nozzles that add damage overwrite the range bonus of the long barrel. Making the Flamer behave as if it only had a Short Barrel.
---
The work-around is uninstalling and reinstalling the long barrel but this only temporarily fixes this until you connect to a new server.
---
There's dozens of us.
---
Yeah I'm waiting for them to remove critter spawns
---
Yeah, I'm at a serious point of frustration with them tbh. If I'm going somewhere and I hear them I basically give up cause I know I'm gonna die. There are main quests I've started doing that I have yet to finish because the  Assualtron  just screws me up each time. The quest in VTU I've not gone back to yet and a few others.
---
Hell I was trying to get the damn Miner Miracles quest done. When I first got to the location I didn't see an Assultraon. Had to exit the game, come back and there's one in the last room. I throw plasma grenades at it like CRAZY and some how when it's just about to die it STILL managed to kill me
---
I haven't even finished the raider quest yet cause of a Glowing Mirelurk King.  That's a whole different nightmare.
---
A pride icon and a pride photo frame. Which has been free for a year? üåà
---
I‚Äôm not saying that. The public system gives special stat bonuses and large exp buffs to certain activities. The private system lacks anything similar, and I can see myself and a few people I play with taking a public team for those benefits and leaving the other system to the wayside.
---
I have seen so many post here some people couldnt claim for a few weeks or even since release of wastelanders and no there is no fix
---
What a sad attitude. You were new once too.
---
r/fallout has Fallout posts, and it includes 3 :)
---
No
---
Did you drop it?
---
Thx :D
---
Yes at that stage before you purchase the item with atoms, if the image is shown elsewhere without the disclaimer enticing you to buy atoms then there is a potential case.
---
- Fallout 76 is not an MMO. 30 players on a server being "massive" is hilarious. 
---
- Even if 76 WAS an MMO it would be atrocious as it's "endgame" 30 second loop is incredibly dull and offers no real reward that makes it feel worth your time. There's also really no progression. 
---
- The literal point of traditional MMO's is to offer a carrot for players to chase? If they never added better gear and gave players something to work towards literally every MMO would be a barren wasteland? It doesn't sound like traditional MMO's are for you if you don't like that. Most players are on the complete opposite side of the fence from you.
---
Tell me more...
---
I often find that I miss, or misunderstand, quest instructions. The first time I tried it, at level 75ish, I had no idea I was supposed to have killed 8 scorched officers and decoded the keycards. In searching the web, I found confusing information about that part of the process. Would have been pretty annoying to get to the end and have no idea what to do.
---
Well, there's new, or noob, and then there's 'blindingly incompetent'  
---
I can't count the number of times I was at Encryptid with everyone running around shooting bots, trying to shoot the Impostor Sheepsquach and failing to damage it completely ignoring the pylons.
---
Clever girl
---
Acceptable Overkill, Night Light, Salt of The Earth, and Whistle in the Dark. There maybe some others I missed but those are the other legacies I remember
---
I‚Äôm level 154 and I still don‚Äôt understand project paradise. I think your viewpoint is skewed. 
---
In a game where 90% of the quests are very straightforward and explanatory, you‚Äôre easily caught out by the odd event that works in a way that isn‚Äôt explained. You‚Äôre telling me you immediately knew that encyriptid works the way it does? Highly doubt it. Either someone in game told you, or you read it online. And when the rest of the game is spoonfed, it‚Äôs easy to think you‚Äôre the stupid one. Especially when other players berate you.
---
How does that work tho
---
I placed it down like I was going to get in but I was just going to see what kind of armor was on the chassis
---
So far everyone I've met in a Mr fuzzy costume has been sketchy lol
---
That's the cargo bot holding pattern area, duh
---
Well basically melee range and riddiculous spread don't help either.
---
I was in the room in fort defiance with paladin taggerdys terminal (the room that is locked until you complete the rest of the mission)
---
The mods hid this post :(
---
Haha, well gathered info session :D
---
Besides the quest details missed by some newstarters the root cause must have one additional item: rewarding.
---
Lets say I enter rad rumble or project paradise and I choose to do objectives which leaves me on guarding a friendly animal/gathering ore. Meanwhile others just killing mobs and legendaries for loot and they as well earn the end reward. While I missed the legendaries and a big heap of xp. And this is not rewarding at all.
---
There are working solutions in real mmos. Event/party wide xp, loot.
---
Swamp ass
---
Yo but have you ever tried to make bread from the yeast infection in you bellybutton? Now that a complexity we should be discussing
---
Beautiful story!
---
If you don't mind me asking, why do you lock the content of your camp away? It always irritates me a little when people have their stash boxes and workbenches behind locked doors, as after wandering the wasteland for a while, people could do with using them!
---
I often get in anyway (marsupial + jetpack gives a lot of potential access routes - a guy yesterday seemed very confused to come back to his house and find me inside!), but I've never understood the reasoning behind it.
---
Can post the build you have right now, give me an idea of the build you would like, and what's your equipment that your using?
---
u/valseek
---
Let me ask you out of curiosity, if they said they could do that the next 6 months, for instance, and hypothetically let‚Äôs say you were going to pay the next six months and would not have a problem with paying...so they will open it up to everyone, and it won‚Äôt affect you at all because it will change nothing about what you were going to do personally.  However, in order to do that, every person who was going to pay the next 6 months would have to and be able to.  (So it‚Äôs not like they would be locked in and lose a job and have a problem, etc...this is assuming they would have been fine).  This is just one of those ethos type questions where there are no right or wrong answers.  So hypothetically in that situation would it bother you to pay knowing others were getting that same thing for free?
---
I was new once, and I was easily able to read the instructions on the screen telling me exactly what to do in most cases.  Also I never said "new" players to begin with, some of the people I've watched face plant their way through these events had many hundreds of levels under their belts.
---
Yassss
---
The picture is hair, since the strap comes above the head, not sure it can be worn with the hood.
---
Wow that is weird.  And this is going to sound like a stupid question, but the chassis is not in your inventory right?  What system are you on?
---
ah dang i haven‚Äôt played for like 1 year so i didn‚Äôt know about that change
---
A few initial reactions:  
---
1. It's important for you to know that charisma builds aren't a thing. It's not really possible to build around specific special stats, simply because the buffs given to you by special points are meant to be supplementary to your build, and the main function of pumping points into special categories is to allow yourself to equip various perk cards which shape how your build functions.  
---
2. You really shouldn't bother worrying about a build until you hit level 100 on your main toon, particularly if you don't know much about how endgame builds work, and also if you haven't completed the main storyline yet. The original questline from the basegame is meant to be completable by players without builds, and the average level that most players finish the story and launch their first nuke ranges between 60 and 80. The smart thing for you to do would be to double down on quality of life perks, wait until you're level 80, and then start planning your build as you save up levels, so that you can use those levels to buy the perk cards you decide you need and transfer special points between the categories.  
---
3. You should cancel your fallout first subscription until you reach the endgame. You genuinely genuinely don't need it right now. There's simply no function in it for you. You don't need to fast travel as much as a person in the endgame, so you honestly don't need a tent, and the scrapbox is useless if you aren't able to farm for large amounts of junk. Trust me, until you reach a point where you need it, it's best to not have the expense every month for the subscription.   
---
4. In my first playthrough, I got lucky and managed to find a phenomenal BE combat shotgun in my first queen fight. It's very unlikely that you'll find a weapon that great as you level up, but you should consider basing your build on a specific weapon type and buff mechanic, depending on how you enjoy playing and which rare weapons you're able to find. That being said, you seriously shouldn't worry about any of this until you finish the storylines and are at least level 80-100. Do research about builds bit by bit as you get there, try testing out different types of weapons and play styles until you find one you like, and then when you know which type of build you want, look up perk loadout examples and match yours to one of them.
---
Yeh I thought so, I would imagine that it can't be worn with a hood, just thought I'd ask first.
---
I‚Äôm in but I agree, atom store it or put it in their battle pass.
---
So edgy.
---
How did you get that backwoods bungalow?  Was it an atom shop item?
---
It can be kind of difficult to figure out how everything works when also having a bunch of things attacking you. I tried Radiation Rumble once and didn't know the trick is to just not kill things. People are supposed to stay alive and things are trying to kill them. Anyone's first instinct is to kill the bad things. I think part of it is also that if someone is doing objectives instead of killing they pretty much just get exp for completing the event and everyone wants exp. If everyone in the event area got at least some exp even without tagging creatures it might encourage people to do more than kill stuff. AFK will always be an issue to some degree. Right now some people just avoid the events altogether.
---
I tried the Nightstalker event once where you're supposed to make a bunch of noise. I showed up after it started and turned on the jukebox and started to play music since the meter was hardly full. Someone kept shooting me like I was doing something wrong. I have no clue if I was or not.
---
Yes. I would not have paid for first for a private world I don't use and a tent I don't need. If scrap box was free I would never have bought first.
---
The thing is not only new players act this way... I can totally tolerate lvl 40 not having clue. But fucking lvl 140 shooting explosive gun should have idea what to do in theese events.
---
Ty for the tips
---
Exactly yeh. When you‚Äôre being surrounded by ‚Äúenemies‚Äù (red names) you‚Äôre gonna start shooting. And when you‚Äôre told to do something (make noise) you‚Äôre gonna do it.
---
Love the reference to JP. Very true.
---
Literally dozens
---
Sell purified water to bot vendors, easy caps.
---
Haha welcome to mmo
---
Me too, so frustrating...
---
This is an excellent idea I have always wanted, because you could come back to your base and see the offers.  If the person sold it, the offer is not there anymore.  It would seem like, ‚Äúwell everyone will just ask for this gun or that gun,‚Äù but most items sold are not guns by volume...not by a long shot.  So, it is really cool because you can go around and be helpful if you want.
---
Who plays Fallout to pvp?  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What other incentive would people have for 1st if they did this? Those of us with it don't get discounts on the Atomic Shop, the "rewards" are pretty much non-existent, just all around, this is really the only reasons for 1st.
---
Yeah this is something that would be great to have in the game , at the moment I usually just spell out a message on a wall if I'm after something , I've only had two people so far track me down to trade with me so it does work but a permanent solution would be swell Bethesda.
---
Very helpful advices!

The thing is, i can barely do the questline as my character is right now, without spending thousands of caps on stimpaks because of low dmg and no survivability, which just in the end made me enjoy the game less, because of how demotivating it is to not be able to loot junk because you die to same level super mutants

Unfortunately I have to agree with you to some degree...

Speaking as someone who regularly plays FFXIV it's really staggering how bad people are at following THE most simple mechanics I have seen in a boss fight/event outside hit the thing until it dies. I ran into this exact same scenario when I was playing Monster Hunter World and Capcom had a cross event with FFXIV where you fought and killed a Behemoth and the Monster Hunter Players where wiping in that Quest so much because they couldn't wrap their heads around 3 simple mechanics. 
---
Now it's understandable not knowing something the first time around but I seen players who consistently run around like chickens with their heads cut off in some of these events.
---
How do i do that?
---
It literally explains the event when you fast travel to it... Collect meat/sludge/kelp and put it to the feeding through. Fill the the counter on feeding through. Protect the 3 animals that spawn from 3 enemy waves that attack them. After that kill boss. Players usually wait and emote to group up... Thats it...
---
They created a problem and sold you the solution. They know 100% what they're doing
---
Yeah I go daaays without finding a trap base to blow up it comes down to luck tbh ...all the game is for me is let‚Äôs kill SBQ in silence then leave ...I leveled my character basically from 0-90 holding down 5 workshops and doing the Fasnacht parade all day most days I had two shops taken that whole time ...this community is still vastly co-op also try a discord faction  even though I wanted to be a wasteland badass my nature tends to be the vanilla good guy but groups like the responders make it interesting
---
The point is that it's still grindy to roll for new weapons and armor. It's just objectively so much easier to roll with legendary modules and be able to control which weapons and armor you're applying the perks to. It's honestly broken, so broken in fact that beth knew it was necessary to make the new weapons and armor untradeable. Idk wtf you even have to complain about here. Would you rather that the new items were just added to the legendary pool and you had to spend 100 scrip to have a small chance of even getting the weapon you wanted in the first place? smh you're living proof that if bethesda gives us an inch, people will ask for a foot.
---
The last couple times I‚Äôve joined, everyone‚Äôs ignoring 2/3 of the friendly animals and I didn‚Äôt understand why.
---
Run events, you get pure water from them regularly.
---
Go here make the build you have: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks and post the link.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing, I have t-60, ultracite, and x-01. I really only use my x01 because I have calibrated shocks on it
---
I wonder how many of you seeing people focusing only the vulnerable iss and ignoring everything just to rush looting it before it explodes and possibly disappear.
---
This actually happened a couple weeks ago at my previous base design. It was a mess of a base, I was trying to figure out a way to lock away my vendors for when I reached my cap limit.
---
My current base doesn't even have doors. It's actually a pretty cool base.
---
Goood flying doggo
---
I don't want to admit how often my toon died trying to get past the Kings in Wendigo cave for Rose's quest. I rage quit for a while after that. 
---
The Wendigo progenitor was easy to deal with in comparison.

I would love to know that too... Maybe because they can't shoot the sludge and kelp so everyone is shooting stags...
---
Thanks for indulging me with an answer.  It was more  from a psychological perspective to see if that concept would bother you, (and not specifically you...you are just one of many people I have asked this question which is similar), regarding the general principle of whether it bothers one to pay for the same thing for which another does not, if hypothetically that payment was expected anyway.  It does not bother me, and I am not sure why, because I practically can understand why it would and should bother a person.  So when given the opportunity I have asked this question with regards to similar situations on random occasions because I am trying to understand why it does not bother me, as I have learned it would bother the vast majority of people which makes sense.
---
Who cares? Just form an event grinding group like a normal person. Play with streamers. Make a friend or two ingame ffs. The only event that it's worth bothering to start/participate in on public servers every time is scorched earth, because it's so damn easy at this point. Everything else should be taken case by case. Don't see a lot of high levels on your server? server hop until you find some before you start encryptid. Have a group of less than 5 running project paradise? That's more on you for even bothering to show up than on the people you're playing with. If you play the game for long enough, you get a feel for which events are doable just based on who's participating in them. If you're still having trouble, it's just because you aren't experienced enough to be able to judge whether or not you're capable of properly completing an event with the people you're playing with.
---
Isn‚Äôt it a glitch where they fucking rapid fire the laser and won‚Äôt stop especially the one in the silos or is that just a feature
---
I mean all I can say is welcome to mmos. Fallout's an incredibly grindy game, and levels 30-60 are some of the most difficult for new players to cope with. If you can't survive in the mire/bog yet, play in the savage divide. Whitesprings is a good midlevel grinding zone.
---
Yeah, the smart thing to do would be to up the limit and invest in the roleplay aspect of it. Maybe even create a way for people to make their own quests.
---
Like imagine having a clan, say role-playing BoS and the leaders can create quests for other players to complete. Make it so they can even make dialogue and such.
---
Just an idea that I had because I'm getting near endgame now and realising that I'll be in the same shoes soon
---
I'm not sure about an explosive "meta". Many legendary effects don't add dps, but explosive is one that does. Faster fire rate is too. 
---
It's less about perks and more about gun type. If you fire one shot every two seconds that adds x damage VS if you fire 20 every two seconds that adds x damage, explosive does 20x more damage for the secondary.
---
The thing about the demolition perk is that it's only buffing the explosive aspect of your guns damage, not the entirety of the listed damage. 
---
It's also not a weapon type that usually constitutes using an entirely different perk set, except maybe gunsmith since explosive weapons break faster.
---
A couple of gym items are being added with SCORE
---
Because the point of the new system is to incentivize grouping up with people you don't know. adding an additional exp boost to private groups would essentially be a flat buff to inspirational. It's pointless, and accomplishes literally nothing new.
---
Don't apologize for your opinion, stand behind it.
---
yes i understand this, my point is that bloodied without unyielding is not that great and unyielding without bloodied is more or less just as effective
---

Get **outta** here, illuminati scum! Thanks to you, I have to kill queens *all* day!
---
I feel like the shotgun was only 500. But either way its 3 or 4 days longer to get the t65, which isn't a big game changer anyway. Sadly defence numbers don't mean much after 350 or so
---
Toxic.
---
New players need time to learn what you‚Äôve so meticulously ranted. Maybe if it‚Äôs such a pain in the ass, you could play another game for a while?
---
Was new with wastelanders amd quest clearing meaning anything
---
Hm, what will you say to a 30k cap stash to the vendor machines where the vendor will deny buying stuff if the cap stash is not enough to store.
---
And if you want to get cap out of the stash you need the space as well.
---
Minigun being more then the shotgun would make sense I guess, unless I‚Äôm remember it wrong. And yeah it‚Äôs not a big deal at all I just can‚Äôt bring myself to get rid of a it but I don‚Äôt want it taking up space lol. That, and I could have gotten a 3 Star with that 100 scrip.
---
Probably woulda been another Nocturnal legendary anyways :/
---
Bethesda never took active steps to make pvp worse in Fallout, it was just never all that great to begin with. Right after launch was pretty much the heyday of true competitive pvp in Fallout, and back then people would run around killing new players for the hell of it, forcing fights, and stockpiling chems/buff items for the garbage fire that is Fallout's fighting system. It was always meant for PVE, and because no real PVP communities developed after launch, all pvp really was was a bunch of high levels running around fucking with people until they got bored with the game and left. PVP has always been the most toxic part of the Fallout 76 community, and NW is probably the best thing that ever happened to us, because it cordoned off the vast majority of the toxic pvpers in their own gamemode
---
You could always play a solo game where the learning curves or casual playing styles of others won‚Äôt ruffle your fully peacocked feathers.
---
The whole concept feels like a place holder.
---
Faction... um, SETTLERS!
---
city name... um, Foundation!
---
"Hey, did we ever find a permanent name for these things?"
---
"No, well too late now"
---
I would of preferred having Vault dwellers rebuilding a few small settlements scattered around the map having to deal with a large group of organised raiders. With an expansion on the existing faction quests. Where the new Responders start taking the fight to the Raiders and the Brotherhood also have their own plan.
---
makes your junk harder to find when you buy the farm
---
Or when their corpse landed inside a fissure
---
I agree with you but have had trouble putting my finger on the problem.  To me Crater feels more like Fallout should, but one of my biggest issues with the game is that it's not far enough removed from the Great War.  
---
A lot of the magic from the other games came from a sense of discovery and unique history for different locations and factions.  That's a FAR cry from "oh, we were police/firefighters before the war... so we just, um... kept doing that"
---
I paid 7k for the croc backpack, just shop around.
---
Offfff
---
Yeah that's going to need some work I'll give you my thoughts later as break is over but I'll think about your situation in the meantime
---
Its untraceable because eal Money Transactions have gone rampant. The current system is WAY better than the last, but if we get 50% of what we want by the time BOS and ne armoe comes out what's the point? I feel we will have a new grind in 6 months
---
Aha, so you're suggesting me to find a spot with enemies i actually can kill, and grind it?
---
Pvp damage is capped at 110 so it really wouldn't matter there lol
---
Welcome to mmos i guess man. Fallout is notoriously grindy, as are most mmos. Every event is really just a way to introduce new items and gear to grind for.
---
Yep!
---
They are the only thing that makes a solo stealth nuke run even remotely challenging, that final room where you get a couple defending the robots, serendipity has saved my ass more than a few times.
---
do you play evrey day between the 8th and 17th ?   
---
..iam ask only smily act rly strange sometimes by me too \^\^   
---
i think it CAN BE that it count if u are "7 day's ingame" online ,   
---
not in the regular realtime/date ?!?   
---
...just some thoughts about the probs with smiley...
---
\*sry my english is not the best atm, long time ago if i have to speak/write in english\*

I'll be posting my thoughts in about 3~ hours
---
Cards are based on your base special stats
---
Brilliant, I would love it if they bought them back.
---
So it‚Äôs just my imagination? Damn, second L I took today.
---
So you can only do 110 damage a hit in PvP? I swore my new PA would give me an edge :(
---
Nukacrypt, as the two above me pointed out, is your #1 place to go. Their team is insanely dedicated.
---
Also, if you're on ps4, add me and I'll run you through my silo route until you get it down. Always happy to help.
---
Awesome thats what i was hoping! Thank you
---
Why not a MAGA flag?  It's a video game not a bumper sticker.
---
Inmost MMO's I can do raids or gr0ind for 2/5 to 4/5 of the gear d0oing end game. In fallout I justly in 1/day ro do the same. Im use to grindy and even "we want momey" but wtf is this
---
So, i've read that the smashing the golf clup and world hopping should be good grind, but i sometimes find myself dying alot there if the mobs are 40+, so any other suggestions?
---
rant is totally justifiable. The game is really starting to feel like a chore. Been playing daily since beta but the last few weeks I take a day off here and there. The FOMO isn't high enough anymore, and it feels liberating.  
---
I see more and more high level players getting bored with the game.
---
How about we keep the politics out of video games?
---
A guy did a bunch of tests with the t65 and compared to the ultracite and t51b it only took 3 less damage a hit. From a level 95 behemoth doing a power attack
---
I thought so too.
---
Where tf you see politics mentioned??
---
did a trade yesterday, couple of my guns for a B2525 Combat Rifle
---
it was a risky for both of us since you just met the other person, in the end we used trainyard suitcases on a private server to each drop our stuff in, it all worked out in the end, but it was a nailbiter until it was done
---
so yeah 100k cap limit, and a trade item/s for item/s option while trading
---
The people, that is the only thing that keeps me playing, our nice little group of friends.
---
You are absolutely right, the game has become a list of chores.
---
thanks for the link, so can I enter the launch code that's on the website into the silo keypad without having to search for the ghouls? Or do I still need the 8 codes from the ghouls to launch it?
---
Im on ps4 and down to play with you on my off days! Im 22, but for whatever reason my right hand (im right handed) is stiff as hell. I also have bad eyes so we can be slow together.
---
Here: "Come on Bethesda why not instead make a new Pride item instead?"
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Yeah, Scorchbeasts are programmed to go to the last known area where you where when they lose track of you. You see it happen a lot with Bloodied builds where you have full Unyielding; their Perception isn't high enough to defeat 25+ agility.
---
You don't need to search for anything. Just get to launch prep, enter key card, enter code, and kill a sbq ‚úäüèª
---
I‚Äôve never used the strangler heart tbh, thanks for the recommendation and the info. Atleast the PvP gap is likely to just be reached by bloodied builds with one shotters (my junkie handmade usually only does 60-70 per shot in PvP)
---
not if you get stuck in a long loading screen, which happens alot.
---
Where in that sentence do you see me mention something about politics?? Piss off Karen there‚Äôs no manager here
---
Only 500?
---
Thats not so bad, expected 15 points in charisma already :-)
---
You mentioned you die a lot, leading to frustration. I would suggest to invest in blocker and serendipity as soon as possible. Till you get your defense up, you could consider using a PA like a level 40 T60 (400DR+PA bonus) for a few levels with a 1-handed weapon. Once you got enough defensive perks and gear, go back to normal armor.
---
I would not worry too much about following a questline, if you can't do it right now get a few more levels and gear and try again. Most people I know including myself finished the 'old' main quests somewhere between 55 and 65 if playing solo.
---
I love this. Very apropos.
---
Cant say, though, there are plenty of yt videos (I think) that show how to do it. If I link, I might get a slapped ass by the mods...
---
Wait... The parachute bag is a physics object? Looks like Fallout 76 needs an Atomic Shop PTS so the customers don't have to worry about buying broken micro transaction items.
---
Totally agree with this.
---
I actually post poned wastelanders and took a break off 76 like a day after wastelanders came out, and didn't really watch any videos. I was burned out, just from scraping stuff and doing pretty much nothing and didn't want to ruin my overall experience. 
---
It was hard but started playing a day after they released the road map! Most likely will do the same with steel Dawn.
---
It‚Äôs easier to group up and protect one animal than three. Especially with a small group
---
You were doing the right thing with One Violent Night. The Nightstalker is attracted by the music and there's a timer for it.
---
I guess because getting that vault armor when Vault 94 was available was a massive grind too. It probably wouldnt feel fair to those who did grind for it back then if it were easily available now
---
That‚Äôs all fun and games until they pull any endgame events out that aren‚Äôt just tank and spank because they‚Äôre ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù (eg vault 94)
---
A great tip! How do i get the t60 ?
---
I just use it since I got it from the raids. I also have a jet pack in an arm which is nice haha. Having 2 chest mods definitely made it more attractive imo
---
If they raise max caps I believe caps will be worth less over time and the rich and poor gap will only increase this leading to more duping when possible.
---
Have you tried server hopping?
---
I tried ESO thinking it was "Skyrim:Online" 
---
Didn't really enjoy it. 
---
Went into Fallout 76. Thinking it was "fallout online"
---
and yeah it totally is, I like it way more then four just because I enjoy the environment in Appalachia. Reminds me of my old home town during fall, and the combat is pretty much the same from four? I could be wrong.
---
DR higher than about 300 doesn‚Äôt make any senseb
---
I assume people let the event linger on as long as possible to increase the chances of other legendary mobs appearing on top of the nightstalker.
---
Then with 3 minutes or so they clear it
---
While I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding you correctly - yes, it would bother me to pay for something others get for free. While I'm not opposed to 'crowd-funding' things, unless it's something I value very highly(aka select creators on patreon that release their work publicly) or something essential(aka charities) I'd simply find it unfair. 
---
In this case in particular I find Fo1st to be not worth having if it wasn't for the scrap box for several reasons: 
---
I don't particularly care about the ATOMs that get bundled, as the store very rarely has anything I'd want and when it does I earn enough through playing to easily afford it.
---
The service fails on delivering on its original advertising - there are no exclusive discounts and such, it's been discussed on this subreddit a million times.
---
It's very expensive for what it is and doesn't offer any flexibility on the features it offers, instead relying to cramming the kitchen sink into it and going wax lyrical about all of the benefits included. 
---
Bethesda's approach to 76, the abysmal QA, the bugs that never get fixed unless they benefit the player base etc. 
---
Having said all that I've cancelled 1st after a few months at the end of May, primarily on the grounds of the last point.
---
A grind isn't really determined the time it takes to get it. It's the amount of work it takes this is just waiting or logging on daily I have everything I need I just can't get it until another 3 days
---
That being said if an addiction lowers your chr you can't share cards. Unless they ca
---
Hanged it when they made uny not effect card sharing
---
It's kinda like scrip and bullion they refresh daily not like shops
---
[Whoever informed you of that was plainly lying.](https://youtu.be/Mx_VNBR5468?t=148)
---
Thanks! 
---
I want to add a prime junkies gatling laser in my arsenal for scorchbeasts, but didn't know which one was better.
---
Bethesda is trying to artificially draw out the game and force you to login to the game more often. 
---
Rather than potentially blowing through your requirement and get exactly everything that you want all in one go, you have to get it over a number of days. More days means more opportunities to potentially influence you into buying atoms to get something from the Atomic Shop and means it takes that much longer for you to run out of things to do during the end game.
---
It feels patronizing to explain, but Pride imagery represents a political agenda.
---
Cool. We had a 486 (I think) with a screen that had green pixels only, that would've fit nicely.
---
That was what I thought. There was a guy crouched on a wall who just kept shooting me like I was doing something wrong. So I just kept playing music and it ended up failing. It didn't help that I had to stop playing a couple of times to protect myself and heal because he wouldn't help me.
---
No. Vault steel and modules reset when you hope.
---
When you cripple their legs they get fucking sassy with you, while still killing you.
---
But am I wrong? No.
---
Really? Well this post was useless I had tried that and still wouldn't show I guess thanks might have been a glitch or something
---
Asshole
---
How about the flair gun shoots UV flairs that highlight the dead bodies' blood like the SCI shows? (I know blood absorbs UV) Legendaries could have a different highlight?
---
Oh I had no idea it had two chest mods, nice
---
Well it dosent any more. They changed it in the last patch unfortunately
---
don't forget to refresh nukacrypt website every time so you don't enter last weeks codes. Been there done that...
---
Lucky. I wish I could find it for that cheap
---
Found a Deathclaw last night, almost dead, it managed to kill 2 of the 4 glowing ants attacking it, it was about to be killed by the other 2 before I killed them all.
---
How do 4 glowing ants kill a Deathclaw?
---
Kinda sad that deleting a Deathclaw is easier than killing those bear mofos.
---
Yeh i did see that on another thread which is what made me think it lowered the base stat
---
Be me. Jump in and try to activate the body to loot before hitting the ground, fail, die and loose all that flux from the SBQ as well.
---
Just happened to me after I preach to turn them off at 25k. Had some one just clean my weapons out 20 k worth in seconds lol good luck to who ever got the quad gamma gun at 10k caps I saw 300 caps of it my fault not theirs. I love you idea anything is better than what we have now maybe we have 30k per character and if it goes over it spills into other characters balances.
---
Check out the marketplace subreddits for fallout 76. Tons of stuff you can look through for the shotgun of your dreams üòâ
---
It‚Äôs the Fallout equivalent of hearing a WW2 air raid siren.
---
Yup, can't find it anywhere. Chinese commandants spawn dead and I can't loot them.
---
caps are worthless already, noone wants to even deal with the hassle of trading with them specifically because of the limit.
---
I didn‚Äôt do much. Grinded a lot of Treasury Notes when it came out, after a while I just logged in for the 3 dailies and turning in notes every day. It‚Äôs not that it was much to do - just locked behind a gate. Roughly 20 minutes per day. Doing more wouldn‚Äôt have speed it up
---
[Here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76)) is a list of possible PA spawn locations, you could ask around if someone could craft you one as well. 
---
Please note, you have better chances to find parts on a public server due to spawn mechanisms. It might take a few server hops to get a full set, I would suggest to not pick up anything from a frame if you don't need it - if I remember correct the game sees the frames as loot container, once you 'loot' it it may not spawn other parts for \~20hours if you visit the spot again. 
---
Just saw T51b has a level 40 version too, that would be even better. If you have no luck getting the full level 40 version of T60/T51b, use some lower level parts from Raider/T45 till you find what you want.
---
Oof
---
Yes, they used to be apex predators.
---
The Most important thing would be an option to hide the jetpack
---
They did change that. Only base special effects card sharing
---
Like the animated packs from fortnite?
---
Just chuck a grenade or sum into one of the rooms and you get like 1/5th or 1/4th of the bar done lmao
---
Jes√∫s you liberals need to find something better to do.
---
Because rainbows are more appealing than a sload's banner.
---
Rad thanks for the new info!
---
Same. Dont even get me started on the imposter sheepsquatch.... good god
---
Confirmed, just tried it myself and the modules and steel reset so I can buy them again.
---
I‚Äôm not runnin unarmed, totally usin melee weapons the 3x modifier is devastating
---
My forager's chair is behind my bar, he wears the meatweek outfit with a bowler hat.
---
I've always asked myself why the US didn't just dropped a shiton of assaultrons over china. That would have ended the war rather quickly.
---
They honestly did the Deathclaw dirty as fuck. They were a force to be reckoned with In FO3 and  FO:NV. But now they‚Äôre easy as hell to kill. While it may seem strange to say, I wish i still had the feeling of dread when a Deathclaw might be nearby like back then.
---
OH NO!
---
There are none. The only mod for it is Shrouded, which is gotten from a quest. Also, he was being sarcastic.
---
Yep, no coming back from that. Delete your account and never return.
---
My main weapon is a "magic" weapon that I didn't know about being bugged, it's really disappointing.
---
I got a Bloodied, Limb damage, 250 resist while reloading LMG a few months ago when 250 while reloading was still a bugged legendary so I stashed the gun waiting for a fix.
---
The fix finally came and my LMG went from being useless to being stronger than a legacy.
---
My LMG does the "magic" damage cascade that drops the SBQ in seconds, she can't even do her legendary regen. She just dies under the overwhelming power of this gun.
---
The entire game is just silly, there is no challenge for anything when my character is immortal with full SS armor and a weapon that drops everything in the game without reloading.
---
And before you mention trying other builds, I have 6 fully leveled characters, on 2 accounts. I have played every build and every mode and I immediately stopped playing all my secondary characters when wastelanders dropped. It's too much uninspiring grind to just keep repeating the main wastelanders story for each character. Don't even get me started on the reputation grind for multiple characters...
---
Ward is the black market kingpin, his hencemen steal the stuff and sell it on to blood eagles or raiders, then he sends you after the stuff again, why else would every stolen bit have a tracking thingie on it...
---
We won‚Äôt go quietly. The Legion can count on that.
---
I think they have given up on setting hard deadlines long in advance. Might be for the best though
---
Oh shit, okay thanks for letting me know chief!
---
Bethesda does not give a single flying fuck. They got paid. Bethesda is just another shitty game company. How long before Fo76 has real world advertising in it? Bugs are just annoyances for the players. As long as they don't interfere with the grinding or money going to Bethesda, they don't give a fuck.
---
I'm tired of having to unequip/equip perks entirely and I'm not even far past level 80, it's ridiculous you can't earn any more slots at this point.
---
Haha yeah they right, people don't want to see foul language while chem'd out our heads. Wouldn't be appropriate :P
---
I know right? I shall throw myself from the highest height, quaff the most poisonous poison, enslaved within the deepest dungeon... All because u/Lcreasey127 said I am an asshole.

Ok cool, thank you!

I like the "more complex" events, to bad nobody shows up

yeah then I'll just do a silo, together with the queen that should keep me busy for .. half an hour maybe
---
You know, sometimes it just be like that
---
Oh no!
---
You will be able to use it through the life of the subscription but once it runs out, you can access your existing scrap but can't put anything new in.
---
Well-stated, stranger!
---
Sure but if it‚Äôs not unlimited capacity then it would be just a small stop gap.
---
&gt;Just form an event grinding group like a normal person." How does one do this?
---
I have multiple accounts and 7+ characters. I did wastelanders once for my main character on each account, then did it once more for my pvp character, and I am completely burnt out and I gave up on the reputation grind.
---
My other characters are now completely neglected, why log into a character with no jetpack just so I can play with shotguns? And because I'm not playing multiple characters, I'm not logged in as much. Since I'm. Not logged in as much, I don't need fo1st anymore so I canceled it. Now it's expired and the game is still playable but even less fun without my tent.
---
It's like Bethesda wants us to cancel fo1st. I don't understand why they sell a monthly unlimited premium service but it doesn't unlock the daily scrip timers that wall off the content.
---
OH yea make a group and server hop until you find event you want to do... Don't you just love watching that loading screen with different photos of communications center in crater. Great fun... 10/10 game design.
---
Looks pretty good to me, maybe find a way to add blocker from strength and you should drop ammosmith for adrenaline. Swap ammosmith in when you craft. If you don't use vats, I'd also consider dropping action boy/girl, and go full adrenaline for the damage boost.
---
Tanky tick has a ring to it. I like
---
Feels like that's the point of it. Cool stuff
---
Thank you. I'll put adrenaline. I always forget about it.
---
For blocker... nothing realy can touch me, I just fly away or melt them with the flamer.
---
Okay so I had the same problem, then someone suggested doing something, and it worked for me.
---
Ill try to find that post I made so that you can read it and try it too.
---
..wait. we have rings..?
---
I like them too, the thing is, the reward isn't worth wasting your time on them.
---
Can you build things into the middle shelves without tricks? i remember in FO4 it used to always "hop" up to the top unless using a "place anywhere" mod of some sort (Looks great btw)
---
People were farming too much bullion so Bethesda stealth introduced an RNG component for Smiley to not reset to slow down the gold bullion acquisition.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't fu\*@ing know! But Smiley hasn't reset for me for weeks now, I've given up and no longer bother with any in game grinds.
---
Gosh, I hope it's not weeks haha. That secret service armor looks so goofy when you're missing the legs and helmet haha.
---
In that case I'd go full adrenaline. Blocker is one of those subjective perks that you may or may not need, but given the mobility you gain from the jetpack, I'd leave it as is.
---
For reals! Hopefully they figure something out.
---
Theyre missing a big opportunity really by not giving us packs of clutter. If they can give us plushies then why not place settings, food items, tool racks with tools etc as static single units
---
I sure do! I do all my dailes and such after work every day :) But that is a good thought! Hopefully they can figure something out.
---
Fuck those guys. Worst than assaultrons imo
---
Its was also technologically extremly difficult to add more stash weigth... Unless you pay 15‚Ç¨ a month, then you can have unlimited weight for scrap...
---
Bethesda must be aware of it unless they truly don't even read Reddit subs or [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) comments or maybe they just not give a fuck?
---
I one shot those 2-3 Assaultrons at Watoga with my legendary black powder rifle. It's like hog hunting.
---
I.FUCKING.HATE.WARD!
---
If the helmet is worth 1650 gold without being better than any normal gasmask is the question tho but if u go for looks but damn
---
That pride icon. The ATOM shop showed the green free tag for weeks, and I couldn't figure out what was the free thing. It didn't occur to me to look under icons, why would we want a free icon? Then I was proud for a long time, because unbeknownst to me when you "buy" the free icon you activate it as well.
---
I'm sure me and the other gold depraved wastelanders would appreciate it a bunch! I keep seeing people with the full service armor and the jealousy is building haha!
---
I can 1 shot them as well. I deal like 3k dmg to them with my unarmed build that's not the problem. It's seeing them and being able to react to their death laser that's the issue for me lol.
---
From what I know screws are one of the few junk items that comes not in bulk and are not available at vendors in this variant
---
I can't play with out Scrapbox. It is like playing a diffrent game with it.
---
I swear I‚Äôve seen bulk screws in vendors before. I might be tripping
---
It is pretty steep price wise for sure. I definitely plan on getting the legs and mods first!
---
If your in power armour you don‚Äôt really need the third rank of fireproof
---
Gosh what an awesome photo. Would make a great wallpaper
---
I think I went to whitesprings looking for screws when I was trying to build one of each power armor set and couldnt find any.  Had to buy the junk items that broke down into screws and whatnot.
---
No worries, I love my PA as well. I usually run some sort of stealth rifle build, full health or bloodied. 
---
For a change of pace some days I get my X-01 with jet pack out of storage, grab an explosive minigun, slap on a few heavy damage perks and go have a blast.
---
Bethesda should really fix this. getting tired of all this little crappy bugs that they arent fixing.
---
Their laser being strong would be fine if it wasn't just unlimited
---
Some do sell them in bulk but ensure that you're going to ALL of the vendors, not just some of them as you said. 
---
I've found generally you'll get usually no more than 1-3 sets of bulk screws at most, so if you're looking for a ton of them, this isn't the way to go about it.
---
Also, don't forget, a lot of these vendors sell junk items with screws too. Don't just go looking for bulk screws.
---
Yeah, it rocks. Different playstile then a stealth build.
---
But both has different benefits :)
---
Lmao yeah I feel you! Its frustrating. This game has alot of minor bugs, but they are really starting to take a toll on me.
---
oh well Ill still start em solo for the mob farm, some xp and loot, 
---
like why do people at PP always pick zone A with the radstags: better mob loot (crickets=acid, YaGui...=acid, Honeybeast=adhesive) the other zones have worse mobs, and the Boss is a Leggy sheepsquatch, while in the other zones its a leggy grafton monster or so
---
and at RR, if I'm there solo and on my bloodied char, I can just sit in the middle top and oneshot all the ghouls, Ill fail the event since I dont collect ore, but Ill gain 2 lvls and the floor is made of rottin meat at the end (I know about the shotgun-pellet-to-the-knee trick but dont play shotty)
---
I am going to all of them. I‚Äôm trying to make a bunch of gauss miniguns and it requires a lot of screws
---
"complex objectives" uhhh no Bethesda just did a tremendously shitty job at explaining the objectives of each event lol
---
put a PA chassis in the door frame, they can't get ya
---
I had the same thing but didn‚Äôt realise till around lvl 100 lol it was a pain but I‚Äôve finally fixed mine now
---
They might have noticed a decrease in server or client performances when/if several players had two running fog machines
---
Shame i have no atoms to spend aha
---
You mean the instructions that pop up on a split second loading screen? Those ones?
---
I judge a game how much I enjoy it. I really enjoy FO76 ever since Wastelanders.
---
So definitely an upvote from me for the screenshots and such.
---
Have you.. tried moving the C A.M.P. device?
---
For sure, it's the polar opposite play style wise. It's heaps of fun to just jetpack into a group of super mutants, hero landing in the middle and then blast them all to pieces with a big grin on my face!
---
Equally, if I want to do a nuke run, slap on the chinese stealth armor and stroll through the bunker with impunity.
---
According to the wiki, the Raider-aligned vendor bots should have them (Sutton, Sunnytop, Pleasant Valley, R&amp;G stations as well as the Pleasant Valley vendor bot). I'd try the more out-of-the-way vendors first, i.e. R&amp;G and Sunnytop.
---
Robots in this game are ridiculously overtuned in general, I feel. Mr. Gutsys and  Assaultrons have it the worst- At least Sentry Bots are supposed to feel like bosses.
---
My strategy for Assaultrons is to cripple one leg first then pepper them from afar or around a corner so their laser can't kill me. This is probably easier as a stealth sniper build than others but I figured I'd offer at least a bit of insight.
---
Still no idea how to handle Gutsys other than "kill them before they see me" lol.
---
i think less "rare" and more sold at specific vendors.  i \*think\* i've seen them on some of the rando traders that wander into your camp.  only bought it once, and that was at my own camp i 99% think.
---
overall it is an uncommon enough of a bulk item that i just farmed the ever loving hell out of them from in wold.  fans, typewriters, accordions, whole buttercups (and certain body parts)
---
helvetia has a few typewriters and fans.  enclave bunker a good handful of fans.  overseer's house has a few fans and an accordion.  whitesprings mall has a whole buttercup in captain kidd's.  i don't think the scrapper perk will get you any from guns like in fallout 4, which is kinda bogus as you'd think screws would be easy to salvage off of guns.
---
Ok thanks
---
How does this explain why he can't remove the door from his camp? Chill out, Hackerman
---
There's the wedding ring, but I don't know of any others.
---
Hey there, we are aware of this issue but I don't have anything to share with you on its status at this time I'm afraid. 
---
Please could you submit a ticket for it if you haven't already done so? It'd help our support team keep track of how many players are experiencing it. Thank you!
---
The ally quests are fucking terrible. Literally go kill someone, come back and repeat. There aren't even any interesting things that happen at the locations: you just kill everyone then get told to go back.
---
Just skipped through all of Beckett's dialogue because he's a boring character I don't care about and haven't even started Aguerre's.
---
Consider yourself lucky - at least you don't have nightmares you just can't shake - floating in space forever... just... why.?
---
I want comical giant gorilla gloves or hulk (super mutant) hands.
---
What game can you play for hundreds of hours? Dota 2. Played for 2.7k hours watched probably about 5k hours. The need to play it still comes back.
---
It seems you just have to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
---
just place some more, and 2 is more than enough for you char alone
---
like 3 or 4 total is enough if you do the adhesive craft I think (depends on how much ofcourse greens u plant ofc)
---
I have no soul, and don't really care about it, but would like if someone explain for these good people up here
---
The defend workshops count for this challenge, as well as any event either public or the normal ones you find.
---
As to the building supplies I honestly cannot recall if scrapping weapons counts. I dont think it does though. Steel is pretty easy though. A good source is those can chimes you find- there are several in both camden park and pleasant valley, but can be found all over the place really. Any tins or metal containers, buckets etc.. oil tins are good as they cover oil too.
---
Copper is also easy. Look for lamps broken or intact. Fuses too.
---
Basically just pick anything and everything up. You can complete this challenge pretty easy doing so.
---
All scrapping counts - junk, weapons, armor, even repeatedly bulking and then scrapping the bulked scrap.
---
I'm not entirely sure about the workshop events, but I think they should count. I've never bothered with those because it's not hard to find 10 events in a week that are more interesting or give more loot that is relevant to what I'm doing right now (read: treasury notes)
---
I find trying to grab them from vendors is a bit hit or miss, so I prefer to farm them myself.  
---
Try the national radio array building, the astronomy building down the road, sugar grove, and the main building in abandoned bog town, you can drop down the elevator shaft from the roof to find a load of fans and typewriters. One farming run through all that and you should have plenty of screws.
---
The backpack too
---
That's fair, I get wanting to be able to lock away vendors. Also being able to lock away crops (now that planters are a thing) for those more precious about them.
---
My camps is all platforms because I love the view. The only full size wall I have is to hang my map on.
---
I dont think any of us knows yet!
---
You are better off with the gattling plasma. Have not tested with my bffr mini vs my be gp. But with my vffr mini vs the Ve gp the vp is far better.
---
of course I remember the ring from FO4 but honestly I've never encountered one in 76..learn something every day in this wasteland :)
---
cool, cool, cool. Yes this is an amusement park not a wasteland.
---
I initially thought you were making a joke, but the comments doesn't seem to think so. If you are indeed joking regard my first sentence as such.
---
Jump, move laterally, a perked stimpak with faster heal should keep you alive np.. at least when you have energy dmg resist mutation or you know, when the server allows it. -_-
---
I often meet the  Scavenger Trader at secluded campsite i HAVE TO TRAVEL TOO EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN DAY for Davenport. (And can we just make that a fast travel point PLEEEAAASSSEEE)
---
Nuke silo when all assaultrons are dominators is challenging i admit that. When you see the laser first stimpak or two. Then shoot back. I use hg and tankier stealth commando build. Enjoy the challenge and try to overcome it. Quik stimpacks, good weapon/free aim and using stealth or tanking it. If you are to slow it's byebye. Stay far from assaultrons melee range that staggering and dmg is harsh.
---
Yup, quantity makes up for low prices.  I usually only turn on my machines for a little bit every week after buying bullion.  Spent 7k Sunday morning on bullion and bow plans and by Sunday night I had to shut them back off because I was back at Max again.
---
Only problem is that it's a pain in the ass to keep restocking multiple machines worth of plans.
---
Hmmmmm ü§î
---
I think it's great.  We need more enemies to fear.
---
it' s cool to have an enemy to fear ;)  
---
I usually sneak attack them, when I can
---
I'd nix full charge. Also you'll probably want batteries included or you will have a ton of weight in ammo. I'd cap demo expert at either rank 2 or 3. And bring down gunsmith to make it so you could run batteries included
---
I didn't even know the game was released on discs. I heard about boxes containing cardboard discs with activation codes on. My move when it comes to the next console generation is to refuse to buy one until  know exactly what's what.
---
There is also the old ring. Not sure where you find it though
---
Yeah that would be great thank you.
---
typical lazy bethesda
---
Same here, i didn't even buy bullion last week and also no option
---
I run PA Bloodied Heavy weapon build and for me explosive gatling plasmas are overhyped and unwieldy. It's only advantage is ammo - you can overcharge them and multiply why crafting and they weight less that thousands of 2mm EC's, especially ultracite. And I used the "best" BE90 GPlasma for some time. Now I have Bloodied Gauss Minigun and it's much more accurate, actually useful for SBQ and Wendigo Collossus and it's much more difficult to accidentally kill myself with it. Obviously you can't trade for it but you must have luck crafting one for yourself.

a furious rolling pin isnt going to be worth 100k just because a limit is removed. the only difference will be, is that items that are worth 35K or 50K or 150K can have an actual caps price tag and be accessible to anyone with caps, instead of how it is now where the only way to get that item is a private trade only deal.
---
This is literally in some of the more recent datamines. Should be able to find it if you just search ammo converter in this sub.
---
As far as i know, ps5 will be backwards compatible with ps4 games. Albeit they only plan on doing the top 100 on launch and then eventually the rest. I don't believe fo76 is on that list, so might not work on launch day. No idea on timeline of when they would get the rest to work though...
---
lol, why didn't I think of that?
---
The only place I've found it is on a dead radroach wearing a bowler hat sitting on a toilet in a house between the Nuka Cola factory and the theme park with the dailies.
---
Placeable Camp objects use more server resources
---
Really? I haven't heard of that one before.
---
I recall seeing october's datamine regarding it and then went nowhere. It's nice if it comes out rather than a cancellation - thanks
---
All scrapping and all events count.
---
I once bulked and then scrapped some springs and it pinged the challenge as completed.
---
Just looked it up. It's in a bench, under a hat, in summervile
---
I prefer a Sniper build of which I have a ShotgunSniper which I really enjoy playing. Gear is a problem as Legendaries tend to be more difficult for me to take down.  
---
Can search for and request someone be a Friend in 76?
---
Its for the battle pass type thing, whatever that was called, thats coming with patch 20. was only first found with the public pts, which was after october
---
Liberators still attack me when I wear Commie merch. I‚Äôm just grateful they gave us bad-guy items
---
will tromp over there and grab that, thanks! 
---
(wonder if I can sell it for a 1000 caps in my vendor?)
---
You are right about the rolling pin but items that are wanted will just keep going up. Happens in any game with no cap to currency.
---
Of course Bethesda replied on this post lol. We ignore all bug reports but uh oh atomic shops bugged better get right on it
---
Great tips! Upvoted for visibility üëç
---
Warning: the purple Mothman bed is very small
---
I don't think Bethesda is going to be touching a game that was literally being given away for free within a couple off weeks of launch in terms of a new version they couldn't shift the original version and unless you think the small number of people who still play the game could fund a whole new next-gen build of the game.
---
I would be surprised put it that way.
---
Yea they probably do. Maybe developer should think about that when making online game that has theese features...
---
Same here!  That was my first experience with a mirelurk king, and I probably died four or five times during that particular quest.  Of course, just the regular mirelurks were difficult for me, back then.  I remember FINALLY defeating that mirelurk king and when I saw the wendigo coming I was wondering how many times I was going to die fighting him.  I easily defeated the wendigo without dying, because he was not nearly as tough as the mirelurk king!
---
I literally only care for my vendor cap limit. I leave my scrap bot and roof garden open to those who need it. I've got enough adhesive to not care about farming starch.
---
I do the same I give them what they need
---
Nice. Something to go look for.
---
Probably not 1000, but you can grab it every day and sell a bunch of them. It's a good area if you have a need for combat rifle plans, too.
---
Because they are ridiculously OP.
---
I feel from the beginning of the games launch, the game was launched as more as a online cooperative Fallout. Basically, it was the gameplay from 4 with multiplayer slapped onto it. I wouldn't necessarily call it a full fledged MMORPG since most of the content can be soloed, and imo it doesn't rely on other players as much as other games. The "build a character" thing is also evidence that they weren't going for a more traditional MMORPG, you can build a character how you wanted, not dictated by a class specialization as in an MMORPG. I think introducing a lot of mechanic based events would alienate a lot of the playerbase, most of whom are more used to FO4 than traditional MMORPG mechanics.
---
It also doesn't help that a bunch of players are bloodied. I ran Imposter with my brother once and we were the only high health players there, we ended up activating the plyons and dying multiple times and the bloodied players killed the imposter before we got a tag. If there was a more "traditional" mmorpg, with a tank activating pylons, dps killing robots, and healers healing, imposter would be fairly easy.
---
For the complicated events, I think it's a lack of text chat, and the fact that we can't make actual public groups (which will be fixed later). Both of those would help with the more complex events.
---
At the end of the day though, it depends on the playerbase. I doubt players will watch a video on how to run project paradise, and would rather rely on the few players who know what they're doing. A lot of the gameplay in 76 is shoot first, as questions later, and when you change that players are going to have a hard time.
---
In the past 3 days? Sounds about right.
---
I do seem to notice a small decrease in blue screens when I use an extra fan to cool down the PS4.
---
So you need to press and hold Attack, than release Attack button the moment you press VATS button?
---
Yeah im 3 and nv you were scarred of deathclaw untill end game (im not taking about breaking a game and shooting them from some unreachable place). In nv entering this cave or crossing the river to their side was scarry even in the end.
---
Oh so everything is our fault? get the fuck out of here.
---
It was just a link to the picture seems the picture shows automatically on mobile on mine?
---
It is my private collection
---
Event objectives pop up on top right corner of my screen when i'm doing events. It shouldn't be that hard.... Arctos pharma is littlebit maze in first runs but then you learn it. Stags are easiest to collect solo. You can get the full 60 but other two  rooms i always get stuck in 35-39. "Food" just doesn't spawn. And usually no one or 1-2 random  come to do it with me when they see that 270lvl dude is in there.
---
There‚Äôs the scavenger that only sells chems and chem plans. Random encounter - I‚Äôve seen her a few times at Silva Homestead, fast travel there then look for the person nearby.
---
Oh for Petes sake he really believes he stole from you üòÇ I like the cabbage insult though

Who else loving the new loot drop? When you die it‚Äôs impossible for others to see it on the ground so as long as you remember where you die your not getting your junk snatched, but on the other hand if you don‚Äôt remember then... rip. It‚Äôs a blessing and a curse haha!
---
Did you need to reinstall the game for any reason? I‚Äôve had this happen to me as well. Now I save every good photo through the system interface (Xbox in my case) so they‚Äôre backed up somewhere.
---
You're such a charmer.
---
IGN is Sergeant-cabbage. I'll be waiting babe. üòò
---
"shitty job"
---
- added list of objectives to loading screen
---
- objectives literally glued to top corner of screen during the whole duration
---
- depend on event, giant pop up in the center of screen what to do
---
üòÇ I don‚Äôt even know what system you‚Äôre on
---
Holy sh*t I wish!

Does it not have glowy eye effect? that makes me sad.
---
I hide things when they are a ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù.
---
If you really wanted me. You'd hunt for me.
---
Your awesome man! Thank you I love this
---
What a never ending supply of junk and meds ;) I bust out my gatling laser and happily mow down everything that dares go into that corridor, I just pay attention to the ores, if things are dying fine I'lltake one for the team and pop out that sneak suit and go mining. I think its not because people are stupid but too lazy and selfish. For example those people sat on the roof in encryptid when you grab 2 pylons yourself and they could help by grabbing 3rd but dont want to use stimpacks so stay there. This is coming from bloodied build itself you can easily take 3 just means you need to dip into your stimpacks a bit
---
What's the point? That is my question, it's a MMO... kind of. I just have a shack and have no collectibles and few camp Atom items, but why spent the time and Atoms/money to just hide it all away?
---
I just don't get it.
---
But equally, I know it doesn't matter in the slightest, just a question I had.
---
ATHENA once got angered at my turrets and started to fight them. I had to store them all to stop that fight, and then that mad robomaiden demolished my scrap collector and tore all cardboard VaultBoys... :-)))
---
Fair point.
---
That sounds awesome! Could even start making bets on it and try to make money from it lol
---
Angry Turtles video on ammo farming has a great section on copper. 
---
[ammo farm](https://youtu.be/XxFu4SnTb8c)
---
Ah... i putted a wrong one:
---
I use batteries inclueded, not power user (since I do not use gatling laser).
---
I gave a B2525 Handmade that I got from Mama Moleman and I traded for the JE gatling plasma (2*).
---
With maxed demo, the unnerfed explosion effect has a big difference between ranks.
---
I think it's more about rising your irl luck stat
---
Bloody mess. It's not even a contest.
---
Interesting..... Until I read the whole thing, I was thinking you were leading to a full alphabet you flick on and off for spelling things out like an elaborate chat window.... Or Stranger Things when you're stuck in the Upside-down
---
Exactly. If my budget wasn't already overflowing. I'd attempt it (I love my base) .  My 2 close friends have just started new camps. So I'm nudging them to create it.
---
Your so passive-aggressive
---
For Xbox it's 100%. For playstation, who knows if 76 is in the top 100.
---
You‚Äôre so passive-aggressive
---
I‚Äôve head tenderizer is really good tho? Any way you can prove it‚Äôs better?
---
That's a fucking cool idea also. But alot of lights. You won't be able to place any other lights in your base.
---
Bc you are a noob
---
Yes, it is chem that goes away faster than stimpacks. And how easily every critter sends his germs through my Power Armor...
---
:-)
---
I was told from a friend that once you have finished the final quest that you can either loose all of the settler rep or all the Raider rep depending on which faction you choose. Either I heard him wrong or he was wrong with either way thank you for the answers.
---
Wrong on that one. You realize Fallout 76 wad released less then 2 weeks before games usually go on 75% sale for the holidays? 
---
Even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was $25 at that point, even Red Dead Redemption 2 was at that price. Holiday sales. Think next time before spewing nonsense.

How much some usually cost when in shop? Must reserve a budget
---
Thanks, i will try this.
---
I've done it a couple times, usually theres like +-10 people jumping and spamming around, trying to loot in between spawns,
---
1 time I did it solo, it seemed like I would trigger a new wave if I interated with the ultracite vein on the bottom of the pit in the middle, but after a time or 20, I couldnt get the scorched to spawn anymore
---
The loading screens are brief and objective descriptors are often vague, sorry you hate other players though.

YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!

Not much on scale percentage. But I believe theres a certain amount of (lights) which you can place.
---
I've had this problem making my sign for my vendor. Then had to remove lights from my inner base. Just to add a couple of letters.
---
I'm at the point now where all I do this event for is xp and loot. No one seems able to read. I solo defend a single scavenger, and even when people join they're all over the place, don't pick a spot, and don't kill everything making it past their area. Rarely will anyone get ore. Idk if everyone who wanted the plans has already done the event right and moved on, or what. It baffles me.
---
You'll like the fog machine in the cultist bundle. Literally a fog of darkness.
---
Thank
---
wanna tell me what's vague about:
---
- defend the brahmin
---
- activate pylon a/b/c
---
-defend friendly animal a/b/c
---
- gather ore
---
- defend the scavangers
---
sorry you cannot read __on screen__ instructions and hate passing events
---
Well I'd love to see it happen so if they do you should totally post it
---
Yeah, with LMG and flamer you should teach yourself to fire in bursts...
---
Will do!
---
Well, I mean I don't just let every random stranger walk into my house in real life to check out all my stuff I own just for their opinion or approval.... That's just weird.
---
Gatling Plasma's explosion effect is legacy effect and its is pre-nerf state (so its 100% damage and not just 20%). Use it with the beam splitter, it rains hell.
---
Fine by me, mechanics get in the way of shooting stuff.  Admitedly the mechanics we have in the events you mentioned aren't hard but it makes them annoying still, that's why I barely run them, takes too long.  Imposter sheepsquatch is easy to solo with stealth and a good weapon anyway, can normally kill it before the annoying pylons kill me.
---
"Tenderizer is better than you think", see link.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a80jf8/tenderizer_is_better_than_you_think/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Imo if you've only got 3 points to spend I'd have both, 1 point in Tenderizer &amp; 2 in Bloody Mess.
---
Because people keep leaving the damn door open when I don‚Äôt have a lock on it!
---
Best bet would be both. Tenderizer is very good because its the last damage increasing effect to be calculated, so its a 7% increase ontop of all other increases, meaning it actually combos really well with Bloody Mess.
---
Pretty sure the changes to the team PVP is due to the new public team/team finder system that is being added in patch 20.
---
I see, I only really have a choice for one, which one would you recommend?
---
Most everyone did. Fallout 76 was like walking through the aftermath of a big party that you weren‚Äôt invited to.
---
Bruh. I killed 2 level 49s today easy with my gattling plasma. I‚Äôm level 61. :/
---
Sadly in FO76, Deathclaws... really aren't a threat. Fucking Ghouls are more dangerous x.x  
---
Sucks as they're meant to be THE apex predator in the fallout universe.. yet they're just stupidly under powered
---
Can't really tell you with the available, can you tell me your whole build and what gear you want to use?
---
Because it breaks and range resets back to none existent.
---
i loved doing raids, but given their removal and people not being able to read the top corner of the screen i have no hope in seeing anything interest happen in end game.  if its not "w+m1/LS forward+RT" then it seems the general public will be unable to complete it
---
During the Mole Miner event last month, they dropped Pails of different value with differing chances of containing rare plans like the Crocodile backpack skin..  
---
Some folks opened literally over a thousand pails and never got anything but common plans and scrap... and to BUY the pails from vendors cost thousands of caps per pail.. for plans worth 50caps
---
Take the door off, solved.
---
Gauss Minigun has explosive effect out of the box.
---
That's an awesome pull and an even better trade haha. I'd give damn near everything on my mule for a je lol. Mainly to have it, live my Ve a ton
---
yep, i agree also with Option 1 here, no. 2 never happend to me yet.  
---
In General:   
---
I guess the whole respawn bug is most likely to happen if you're overencumbered (or at least get that notice when you die (or you can see this sometimes when you logon for a sec). 
---
You can check this when you get to select a respawn point on the map (vault 76) after you died. In the lower right corner you should see you "weight" info, and you also should see that you are overencumbered. Even if you were NOT overencumbered before dying. 
---
I can only assume that when you die (or login) the game does not "calculate" your armor bonuses/perks to carry weight etc. and because of that you must respawn at Vault76 for example. And because of that you are not able to respawn "On the go" at the event itself. Happend to me also (quite a few times), but i was eligible to get the Event reward and i was able to loot the boss after teleporting back to the event site. But yea, this behavior really sucks :/
---
Probably not what you want to hear, but i'd strongly consider starting a new character. I appreciate that you've invested time into your current character, but by your own admission your current character is broken and not enjoyable to play.
---
Take it on the chin, take what you've learnt from mistakes made, start again from scratch. It really won't take long to get back to the same stage you're currently at (with regards to level and progress, not broken characters).
---
What the hell did i just read
---
I had same issue in can't complete quest, Chloe essentially tells me to go away and let her get some rest. This broke after wastelanders update and has stayed broken. I'm on PS4 also. Same for daily Mistaken Identity, that never comes up as an option, found out it is not a daily quest, in reality previously completed side quest, so cannot complete the 19 task atom award....ü§îüò° Managed to reset Play Time  after feedback noted from Bethesda, you go to Data, Daily and choose reject quest option. Hopefully will start after cool down time........
---
Will update comment if this works.
---
+1 if anyone decides to do it
---
I remember having a beefy PC on Fallout 4 with huge glitched bases, over 25 all over the map and the game really struggled, things would load in late or early and I'd see things falling through floors that weren't there yet etc...but saying that, compared to what we are allowed now, I think they have a lot of leeway but they're just being cautious.  Also can't see why we can't have a few settlers roaming around.  I had Athena, the woman ally, another trader and an engineer woman all at my max base the other day (certain areas spawn npc's) not to mention my collectron and brahmin.  Game ran fine even with all on screen at once.
---
We just had a 168 events where people showed up to a parade with a gatling laser, so....
---
Here's a link to a Gauss shotgun review.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1bsLevJAdU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1bsLevJAdU)
---
Lmao. You seem upset.
---
Thats bugged for a long time now as I heard. Just make it a normal switch and cut the wire when you want to prevent others to enter the garage.
---
I believe you hit Send before finishing your thought. Would you mind finishing it for me so I have idea what are you trying to say?
---
yeah Flamers are awesome,
---
my main used to be a melee before I switced to Heavy (ful health), and flamers are like easy melee mode, you just run up to things and they melt, only thing is, the durability, they break super fast, and my explosive flamer double as fast xd, for ammo, I just buy it at player vendors for one cap since nobody plays flamers, so I run around with 4 flamers and +10k fuel
---
also the burning corpses that you leave behind is just so nice
---
I'm forever the only one collecting ore, and also usually having to protect the scavengers coz people just have no clue
---
On console it seems to be the lack of high level players that know what they‚Äôre doing, on any one random server. We desperately need the ability to  have servers populated based on level.
---
1. Get a shotgun preferably limb damage.
---
2. Don‚Äôt equip shotgun dmg perks.
---
3. Equip enforcer perk.
---
4. Aim for the ghouls legs (no vats)
---
5. Blast away legs but don‚Äôt kill
---
6. Now you have a bunch of ghouls lying on the ground and no more new ghouls will spawn.
---
7. Go wild and gather all the ores, take your time (40 ores total per person).
---
8. Wait until and make sure everyone has enough ore (total 100).
---
9. Deposit all ores.
---
10. Success.
---
That 100 at launch is games that will be playable in ‚Äúboots mode‚Äù 
---
Every single ps4 disc will play on ps5 at launch
---
Damn nice strategy üëç
---
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't gooooooooooooooooo~
---
Settler Wanderer is a dirty hippy, you realize
---
You beat me to it lol.üëçüëçüëç
---
Thanks mate!
---
The 100 game‚Äôs refers to the games that will be playable in boost mode on ps5 
---
All ps4 disc will be playable on ps5 at launch
---
Even on my steath character who only has 5 strength if I swap enough perks round and grab a suit of PA and a fast firing heavy vampire weapon it's hard to die. With a dedicated build I imagine you're pretty invincible while doing damage.
---
You can install calibrated shocks - one on each leg for extra carry capacity.
---
Nuka girl suit has a stretched skin bug around her midriff.
---
No. Just honest. I did have a baby sleeping on me. And I did search for it when she woke up. Over a month ago. 
---
I try to keep my aggression straight forward so people don't miss it.
---
*Grabs flamethrower from the garden shed next to the pool*
---
Oh really?! Cool üòé Do you know how much extra carry capacity they give? üòä Is there an equivalent for arms &amp; torso?
---
Or the alternative route.
---
1. Go in with your ‚Äúgodly‚Äù weapon and 0 preparation.
---
2. Start the event immediately and ignore the f*** out of other people even if it‚Äôs just you and the other guy and he prefer to wait for more participants. 
---
3. Fail to defend even one wave of ghouls and die.
---
4. Fail to save scavengers.
---
5. Run away/Event failed.
---
6. Start a post on reddit, blame Bethesda and the community on how impossible the event is and downvote every other post that tries to teach you how to complete the event.
---
Yeah. I my toon is a junkie. But I tend to run vamps 95% of the time and only pull the junkies guns out for the bigger fights
---
I'd love to do this event but no one ever does it
---
That's what I was figuring. Try n get a decent vampire minigun (Mains got nearly 15000 rounds of the shit x.x) along with upgraded power armor n perks... just sit during the Scorch Queen event tanking shit xD
---
Those BE gattling plasmas are probably the most dangerous thing in the game. 
---
 For the user as well as the enemy.
---
Calibrated shocks give +50 carry weight on each leg
---
This has been asked countless times but as always Bethesda conveniently looks the other way and comes up with some excuse as to why it can't be done but they still persist in tempting you with more camp items via atom shop, why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we can't fit the damn things in Bethesda, either stop with the camp items or give us more space for christs sake
---
Not originally by me, I can‚Äôt find the original person who came up with this. But I want to thank them and help spread this.
---
When ever I find a locked house I do my damdest to break in. Even if it's a simple wooden shack. Its just a challenge I set myself. After 1k+ hours I need something to do lol
---
Ooh bonus üòÄ Thanks! üòä
---
I dunno man. There‚Äôs already no glass in my window panes. Can you imagine how damn drafty it will be if I remove the door as well?
---
It‚Äôs why I made the post. The more people know of strategies like this the more confident they‚Äôll be in attempting Radiation Rumble. Next thing you know people won‚Äôt be scared to do it. That. Or it Radiation Rumbles ends up being like Project Paradise even tho it‚Äôs hell of a lot easier
---
It'll end up being another Project Paradise, guarantee you
---
Thinking that a lvl 140 should know what to do or cares about what to do is disproved by an entire week of heavily armed high levels showing up and ruining the event for others.
---
Each calibrated shock adds 50 carry capacity, so 100 unless you grow a 3rd leg. You can add Motion assist servos to the torso to gain +2 str, that will all a little bit more. Most people prefer to use something like Emergency protocols or Jetpack on the torso, though. Arms/legs don√Ñt help with carry weigth.
---
Try Rebuilding the database on the PS4. 
---
Had 3 blue screens in an hour, just after Wastelanders dropped. Done this (Plenty of YouTube Vids) only had 1 blue screen since, wasn't even playing Fallout (watching Netflix). Hope this helps.
---
Yes I‚Äôm very salty after failing this event so many times. But it can‚Äôt be helped, this event is relatively new and requires some teamwork, need more people to know the tips and tricks.
---
Ah yes people who share may pain
---
Yes it is.
---
If you're on ps4 and don't know the plan i can put them on for you
---
Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôm not on PS üòû Appreciate the offer though üëç
---
Wow haven‚Äôt thought of that! /s
---
I like the location, it‚Äôs on the edge of a cliff with a nice view in a convenient area and I got a lot of time into it, I probably will end up moving it someday but I don‚Äôt like the idea of starting it over, at least not yet anyway.
---
The inventories for the vendor are different most of the time so depends which server you're on. Sometimes will have them and other times something else.
---
Ruin how? I have never had that event fail and  finished with with all 5 bots no matter how namy people showed up.
---
Me too, I guess that's why these secretive people put all the workbenches outside and no chairs or beds near windows to prevent glitching through. but PA!
---
Yea i agree with that. Even though im bloodied myself, whenever encrypted pops up, i hop into my decon shower and get into my Power armor, switching up Some perk cards and i join the event. I swear everytime i attend encrypted there is at maximum 1 guy doing pylons and then usually get completely shreked while all the others unload all their weapons into the invincible imposter... good Times.
---
Last Time i did all the tanking myself semi succesfully and then i dont even get a drop from the imposter cause i didnt even had a Chance to get Some Hits in.. pff
---
Yeah definitely, furious for tough fights
---
I hate that, we had a nice mod in FO4 with undamaged glass, looked nice.
---
Well I try to form a mini faction. Just a thought. Fo76 never had ( big ) player factions that I know of.
---
Sounds like they were trying trying to farm the spawn on ‚Äúnightstalker‚Äù, which I‚Äôve found to be pretty tedious to try to run that timer out. If they want to sit undisturbed they should do it on a private server. On public server I expect that the event be done quickly. 
---
I think all these problems can be fixed by level capping servers. Keep all the lowbies who just want to dicker around and have fun on their own on their own low level servers, and let the high level players who want to do high level, higher complexity content, populate servers together. 
---
I‚Äôm lvl 200+ and usually one of 2-3 50+ players on console and dozen or so low levels sprinkled around the map. 
---
Of course this will create another problem in that higher level players congregate to a select number of highly sought camp spots. Damned if you do damned if you don‚Äôt.
---
Why not use both?
---
Does it matter how many scavengers die as long as at least one survives? Reward level 4/4 gives you a shot at rad barrel anyway?
---
I would have embraced the dark side and snuggled up for a bbq.
---
thnx for letting me know about the syringer
---
You were welcoming them to the bbq lol
---
Not sure because not enough people do this event because they‚Äôre not confident they will succeed so they choose not to waste time, ammo and meds. I figured that my post will A. Get more people to do R.R. and B. More people will be able to reach that 4/4
---
Blocker perk + let them get right on top of you so they dont laser your ass. Keep a Vampire swing speed weapon on switch if you're melee or a vampire explosive if youre gun based. 
---
I love how deadly they are.
---
Then others came and started a smaller party about to get drunk and get hit by a car.
---
I picked up 10 bulk screws from the whitesprings station the other day, first time i had seen any for sale in a while
---
Best rolls are faster fire rate and faster reload. The primary depends on your build. But bloodied and junkies are meta. As for mods the tri barrel and which ever capacitor that gives better energy damage
---
I played it yesterday bc there were about 5 lvl 200+ players when the event started. One guy had a great strategy, he used power armor frames to block off the hallways. Made it really easy to mop up the mobs. Took about 12 frames though haha, but super effective!
---
Yes.  
---
I‚Äôve been using vampire weapons since L20 - made 203 last weekend.
---
I alternate between regular armor and Excavator, and use vampire switchblade, vampire, 50, and vampire gatling plasma.
---
All events that shown on map as event counts besides some Enclave ones - I have no idea why?
---
Scrapping weapons and armors counts, same as scrapping bulked mats.
---
I forgot about that strategy. Sadly I don‚Äôt have the storage space
---
You can easily tank the queen with a bloodied pa build using emergency protocols on torso, life cover rank 4 in endurance, adrenal reaction and speed demon mutations even in t45 armour. 
---
Impostor sheepsquatch is the place to use a vampires heavy build to tank a all l 3 pylons and the impostor.
---
Itd become an event with a 0.01% chance for the backpack to drop
---
You should create a separate post for this idea, I think it‚Äôs excellent and would be a huge addition to the game.
---
Just a visual bug but brotherhood fatigues and military fatigues don‚Äòt show if a lining is attached. I accidentally scrapped my fatigues a couple of times because they don‚Äôt show up as ‚Äû[shielded]‚Äú.
---
Thank‚Äòs in advance.
---
Like someone suggest that you start over, I agree to that since you haven‚Äôt invested too many hours into your character and it‚Äôs relatively easier. 
---
But if you want to continue I can suggest you to try to get your hands on a pump action/ combat shotgun. I believe they drop quite commonly on scorched and mole miners. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a legendary too. Try if you can one shot a lv 68 ghoul in WhiteSpring in vats. If you do, craft/farm more ammo (never buy) and farm your level there.
---
Another good strat: bring a Shishkebab with the Friendly Fire perk. You can use it to heal the scavengers if they lose health.
---
Bonus points if you have a swing speed Shishkebab and use Friendly Fire level 3 for max bonuses.
---
Flamers _used_ to work for this (and quite effectively too!) But wastelanders broke them and now they only work on bash.
---
On my PA rifleman main, who is by no means min maxed, (basically riflmane perks and perks for mailing weapons and OA durability last longer, with most the carry weight perks. I run two vampire heavies for big boss fights, I never die.
---
Yeah, my highest level character is a PA heavy gun tank. I use T65 with either a vampires explosive .50 cal or vampires Gatling plasma. The only time I‚Äôve died since I optimized my build is when I‚Äôm tanking all the pylons in encryptid and get hit directly with that OP laser beam. Other than that, you‚Äôre basically invincible. I kind of got bored of using that character though. So I recently made a stealth VATs commando/rifleman build.
---
I can help yu out if your on PC, unless it's T65. Havent been able to pick it up yet
---
YES!! I remember the joy I felt when someone actually brought that. The only thing is that after that one time I haven‚Äôt seen someone do anything similar since
---
Also, have two people equip a shishkebab and use friendly fire to heal the npcs!
---
Also you need to understand combat &amp; utility perk, and that you can swap them situationally. And dead man sprinting is not as useful because it doesn‚Äôt stack with the mutation speed demon. 
---
You might want to look up for mutations and perks under Luck that helps sustain and benefit them.
---
This and not accidentally scrap it.
---
I have one hotkeyed and basically bring it to every relevant event (Fasnacht, Free Range, Rad Rumble, etc) because people rarely seem to protect what they're supposed to.
---
I pretty much never fail Rad Rumble with it, even if one or two die because I'm collecting ore when people stop protecting the scavengers and decide XP is more important.
---
Tenderiser is fine and under appreciated generally speaking but if the choice is one or the other, like I said, it's not even a discussion. 
---
The problem is that you're fixated on numbers and not looking at the big picture.
---
Here's a few things to consider of Bloody Mess vs Tenderiser
---
* 15% vs 7% damage boost
---
* After 10 seconds, it's 15% vs 0% damage bonus
---
   * So for any fight that lasts more than 10s, Tenderiser is dead weight.
---
* 3 luck perk points vs 3 charisma perk points
---
   * Luck contributes to faster crits. Charisma gives you 1 perk card you can share with a team.
---
   * If you use vats crits, luck is hands down a boost.
---
   * If you work in a team, you get nothing. Only your teammates benefit from the shared perk card.
---
Like I said no contest. 
---
The only case for Tenderiser over Bloody Mess I could ever possibly make is if:
---
* You're always in a team
---
* You use a ton of damage buffs and with those buffs can kill a boss-level enemy within 10s plus or minus a few.
---
I do find that people just run around without any actual task. One person can lock down the first two rooms from on top of the fork lift and another can lock down the rear two rooms from near the turret. Yet even when it‚Äôs clear that this is happening people still don‚Äôt use the opportunity to collect any ore.
---
Yes, that sounds about right. Let me tell you why this event sucks! Blah, blah, blah...
---
I don't know how important the ore is to the success and rewards of the event.  It all comes down to keeping the scavengers alive - of which you only need one.
---
With this in mind, you can solo Radiation Rumble.
---
It is relevant. Had you said you haven‚Äôt played since beta, that would make your opinion hold a lot less water than someone who played recently. The game mechanics have changed a lot and the impacts of the store are often overblown in news articles. I was just confirming you actually have 1st hand experience in what you talk about. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve played recently. I completely disagree with your opinion but respect your right to have it.
---
This instantly reminded me of the second Jurassic Park when the T-rex's go after their baby.
---
Yes it was about a month before I believe
---
OK let's do a bit of clean up before we move on:
---
Strength: 
---
You want to focus on on both 1 Handed and Unarmed Weapons at all time? Because trying to focus on both at the same time will neuter an extra 40% of your 1 Handed Melee attack power. Normally people focus on one Weapon type at the time. With that said Strength Builds benefit from being able to effectively switch between Unarmed,1 Handed, 2 Handed and Heavy Weapons on the fly. 
---
Endurance:
---
Any reason you want Ghoulish? 
---
Are you going for a Bloodied build? Because I want to know why you grabbed Radicool.
---
Charisma:
---
- Happy Camper is an extremely useless perk
---
- Squad Manuevers is also consider useless (along with other movement increasing perks) because the Speed Demon mutation achieves the same rsult with wasting perks
---
- Do you REALLY need Travel Agent? The Perk has it's use but personally I don't use it as keeping up with the caps isn't hard to me. 
---
Intelligence:
---
- Again are you going for a Bloodied build? Because there's no other reason to pick Need Rage otherwise.
---
Agility:
---
- If you're not going for a Sneak Build than Escape Artist is not a great choice for you.
---
- Dead Man Sprinting is once again useless because Speed Demon mutation exists not to mentioned the max movement speed increase in this game is 20% (which Speed Demon gives you) so you wouldn't be able to stack.it with Squad Manuevers anyways.
---
No. Base SPECIAL affects your perk card allotment. Even if you get a negative state because of chems or whatever, your base doesn‚Äôt change.
---
Tactical shotgun skin, Handmade skins.
---
No. Number of points in a special = number of card ranks you can equip. Effects like perks, chems, mutations, legendary gear don't change that.
---
I do love the passive aggressiveness of your comment, but mostly I'm proud of you using punctuation! Look at you, buddy. Soon you'll be up to complex sentences!
---
That aside, like I originally said "I agree with you in principal" and I still maintain that. You may have worded your original point poorly, but you make a decentish one, though it's been mentioned a lot before and I kind of doubt they'll bother with it, especially with the perk loadout system coming, but who knows!
---
Same here. Not enough people do this to the point that you can experiment with how much work = the value of rewards
---
And that is why organized groups do these events on private servers. As long as Bethesda (not us, we'll never reach the entire playerbase or even enough people) doesn't increase the information IN GAME on these events, the situation will stay like this and the experienced players will do these events on public servers less and less, making the situation even worse.
---
I don't like the situation but that is how it is for many experienced groups. Why risk going to public servers when you have a 100% succes rate on private servers?
---
See thats what I use now. Bloody Lever action, Unyielding armor, stealth and vats perks. One shotting most everything from stealth now, and that's without chems or mutations n the like to boost it further.
---
Average scorch beast takes 4-5 shots using regular .45
---
Also double check which silo you‚Äôre at before you type in the number, been there unfortunatelyü§§
---
Imagine writing an entire post thinking I would read it saying that we are idiots and don't know something about something tldr.
---
It's a recurring strat for most timed events that spawn enemies, e.g. the nuclear launch (you can stop Assaultrons from spawning by crippling instead)
---
I have a soul but I just want to know about this hecking backpack
---
Dude, I've been playing MMOs for 17 years. I know one when I see one, they're all the same at their core.
---
Oh yeah!
---
There are 5 spawn points for the vendor bot. Charleston Station is only one of them.
---
*well, there it is.*
---
who hurt you
---
A baby grafton monster backpack: it just a small grey mass of muscle that leaks oil sometimes
---
I like playing this event solo ... just sit on the collector behind the quest giver and stealth headshot ghoul spawns on one side, turn around and stealth headshot ghouls on the other side. You usally can kill 170-190 ghouls in 10 minutes ... thats a lot of XP. And you can also loot 4-5 legendaries, 4-10 Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets and a lot of stuff, chems and ammo from the ghouls. When I play solo everyone survives, but the events still fails as I don't have time for collecting ore.
---
I always craft a bunch of lvl 10 10mm and a crap ton of ammo in front of V76. All in separate bags, 1 gun, 300 rounds. Like 10 separate bags. Lol.
---
I'm going for a bloodied DCG build
---
I get it, but he constantly avoided simple questions I asked. He said he wanted them to rework monetization. I asked how. Crickets. He said hundreds of online games offer new content without mtx. I asked to name one. He said it was a stupid question. Finally he said he wants us to have to pay for DLC one by one (finally answering my original question). This is a micro transaction and personally one I think that is way more offensive but it took a lot for him to actually be clear on what he wanted. It‚Äôs fine to disagree on things, but there is no need to tell someone they have a stupid question that was asked in good faith. It is not hard to have a civil discussion.
---
I think the downvotes are probably because of the formatting, not because of the content?
---
Hmmm, I like that. With a zipper running up its belly, and its hands and feet are augmented into the backpack straps.
---
With fire coming out your a** instead.
---
Tips from the wasteland.
---
Has it actually been confirmed there's 76 content on there?
---
There's a glitch that can make you phase through lock doors that a high lev guy showed me.  I'm to curious a person to not look, so I'll go in look around through a thumbs up or 2 if guys stuff is nice.  Plus it's always fun to see the ??? Pop up when I'm in there base and not wanted
---
Basically, found this DCG build on YouTube that i liked and it seemed not impossible to turn my current build that way
---
There was an event where we had to hunt down mole miners and get boxes from them, the  mole miners were rare in the first place and the chance you'd get anything good (like special plans that were just for the event) from the boxes was almost 0.
---
Thanks! Will try the shotgun advice
---
Dude, I like what yer sayin but please use paragraphs. Hard to read the huge continuous block of text.
---
I agree. I was a little disappointed with just how many markers there are. At least a few quests make you need to actually be close to the stuff to figure it out. I wish there was more puzzle solving. This is one thing outerworlds actually did better that I liked.
---
Yes. The disc shows you have the rights to the game, so the Xbox Series X or PS5 will download their respective versions of it, with whatever enhancements they bring.
---
Yeah, chainsaws are sad underpowered.  Would be great if they did devastating damage with the trade of of breaking fast. Totally worth it. But no, they're crap.
---
I usually do project paradise by myself even when no one is doing it. Is easy to solo . And usually when the event is about to end a few players show off. People just don't want to "waste" their time
---
A lot of people's problems on this sub would be solved if you played the game with other people.
---
One of the vendors at Whitesprings sells them.
---
No, Tank Killer is for single/auto rifle weapons. 
---
The LMG is a Heavy Weapon, ‚ÄúStabilized‚Äù is the armor penetration perk for Heavy Weapons, it also reduces recoil and spread by a lot, but it requires the use of Power Armor.
---
The one in the bunker or the train station?
---
If there is enough PA users they can place the PA to block the way and make the enemies stay behind
---
There a trick to help with this
---
Pull ok your pro snap (camera that you equip like a weapon) and aim like your gonna take a pic, and in the top right it with have text telling you what your looking at.  So in your case it should say ash pile
---
Our problems would be solved if we had friends to play with or random people showed up to at least attempt the event with us
---
This and more stash space.
---
Power armour frame walls are an added bonus
---
Somewhere along the line, game designers decided that making "events" overly convoluted was a good idea. Who knows why, maybe because time spent figuring out what should be clearly defined counts as added content.
---
Here's an example: Destiny raids. Those first groups to run them would spend 10-15 hours "solving" them, and Bungie could crow about their work, showing how they pushed the skills of a six person team. A few weeks later people are running it in 30 minutes. This is just lazy design, and to me it's just as disingenuous as fetch quests in anything Ubisoft makes.
---
If designers really want to impress me, make content where the objectives are clearly defined, but make them a challenge even when players feel they've mastered the task. I can't tell you how many times I've just given up on games because all this content is unclear in the way its execution is structured. All it does if frustrate people.
---
If I was you I‚Äôd have a look at different build ideas on YouTube specifically Angry Turtle. Find what you like and plan accordingly. Head to an area where you can easily farm enemies for xp and keep leveling up. You‚Äôll eventually get to a point where you‚Äôre back on track and enjoying the game again.
---
I get you and your frustrations, I also play solo, but I just accepted that other people are usually clueless and thus don't do most events unless I see a group doing it already.
---
This is worst on the encryptid event. No one activates the pylons, just run around like headless chickens. That's why I prefer to do them in private servers
---
Still does not work. Killing a SB, taking a picture at a fissure site and roasting some enemies with a flamer are the easiest/fastest way to complete it.
---
My only issue is not being able to navigate the place because it feels like a maze. That can be solved by doing the event more though. This is a fun event but you need a few people to be able to do it right in all 3 sections.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll run bloodied with mine. If I get some get bloodied weapons I will but right now all I have is a bloodied explosive fast reload black powder rifle. But that doesn‚Äôt work well with stealth obviously. I‚Äôve got some good unyielding pieces that I transferred from my PA build too though. If you make a PA tank then it‚Äôll probably be a nice change of pace for you. Especially with vampire weapons. You won‚Äôt be dealing as much damage as a bloodied commando, but you‚Äôll be able to stand there and take a beating while laying down constant damage.

---
And equip the Excavator PA? Does that work for this type of Ore?
---
25 ores is the minimum I think before timer runs out and you fail, even with everyone alive.
---
And that‚Äôs where these kinds of posts come in to at the very least boost the confidence of the community so that way people will at least go for it. Not only because of the advice the post gives, but also the other strategies shared from different perspectives
---
You can buy it from vendor bot Phoenix in watoga
---
I mean, we have display cases, why don't the shelves function like this? It makes no sense. What is the point of shelves you can't put anything on?
---
Classic problem with DPS focused players.
---
Focus is entirely on getting the most kills/highest damage to the detriment of the rest of the "team".
---
Anything more complex than shoot something in the face will result in an event fail as they never pick up/defend objectives or downed players.
---
Just sit in strategically useless areas killing everything that moves.
---
Well you could just watch and learn. Monkey see monkey do. First time I played paradise I figured out what to do by observing what was happening on my screen. Same with project paradise. The simple fact of the matter is most players lack critical thinking skills in this game.
---
Where can I find the bot?
---
upset? no
---
disappointed that we will never get endgame content that is not a bullet sponge because of this? yes
---
Does not work. I use heavy guns and armor and doesn't works by switching guns. Still needs to unequip and equip them
---
The super duper mart. You can also go to the whitesprings and find the BOS vendor in there
---
Don‚Äôt know. Bethesda thought ahead- for once- and made sure that the amount of rads in Radiation Rumble would kill you too damn fast if you tried to use Excavator
---
Doesn‚Äôt the plan only drop from bog events? Thats what the fallout wiki says.
---
Problem is that people on reddit are mostly "good" players who know what they are doing, since only people who actually care about the game would read this sub. Clueless people don't care.
---
bloody hell, the thought that he would be such a twat to begin with is just annoying though, when i first joined, at around level 10 i came across a player called little Rhodesian, lovely guy, he was at somewhere around level 140 to 200, he gave me a brotherhood sniper rifle and modified my current gear, he gave me stims radaway and even some armour, honestly without him my process to level 60 would be a lot more grinding and a lot more painful, we are friends on the playstation network now and i am just waiting until my birthday when i can get a playstation plus pass, so i can play online again and we can hang out again
---
So true and so sad
---
I mean if this post reaches only one person who didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôll mean there is one less clueless player
---
Sure, because this is *so* much like real life. Lol
---
Says it‚Äôs tomorrow not today
---
There's nothing on today. Says tomorrow 18th. Thought it'd be a Bethesda showcase but just seems like a trailer, I'll just wait for YouTube. Thanks for heads up though.
---
Project Paradise is broken and won't update the quest to represent anything I add to the troughs.
---
Encrypted is easy though, rarely ever fail that!
---
Unless they buy the no tray version of the consoles
---
Cool üòé Thanks for the detailed info, awesome üëè
---
figured this out during my last run. unfortunately there were randos that walked around killing them anyway because they got bored of standing in place bc they clearly didn't understand that we were supposed to be getting ore.
---
I had great success as a VATs abusing bloodied build sat on top of where you deposit the ore. Great sightlines of both entrances.
---
Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôm not on PC. Appreciate the offer anyway but üòäüëç
---
Lol. It might do but the Fallout wiki is massively out of date and has inconsistent data.
---
Until there is a serious community push to improve the content and accuracy of the wiki, I'd take anything it says with a grain of salt.
---
I've seen this done before you just have to be creative
---
Use a half wall next your vendor and use the small letters to right out what your looking for for example 
---
Lookin 4 lead pm me or what ever you need I have one that says want bloodied pm will pay
---
Rifleman? I use rifleman for myself but when it comes to events like Radiation Rumble and Scorched Earth I use commando to combat the hordes of enemies
---
Make a public team request and then have ur friends immediately join
---
Per PlayStation, a [majority of PS4 games](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/03/18/unveiling-new-details-of-playstation-5-hardware-technical-specs/) will be playable. The list isn‚Äôt out so I wouldn‚Äôt trade in your console till you‚Äôre sure. 
---
Xbox will be [backwards compatible with every game](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-differences-between-the-nextg/1100-6477643/) sans kinect.
---
Yeah once in a while I'll craft a bunch of low or mid level stuff to get a little xp and lighten the load of junk in my stash, then go hunting for lower level players on the map to give away.
---
But I don't drop them in bags and walk away, as sometimes someone, like me, will scoop them up if they're just sitting there.
---
I make sure the player knows I'm giving them something and drop them specific amounts of certain things, and spread it around to other player's. If they don't take the stuff, like a level 20 guy did before I chased this guy (he just shook his character and walked away) I'll pick it up and find someone else who wants it.
---
Not sure if that's accurate my dude.  Have completed the event with 0 ores.
---
Locked doors in the wasteland makes me laugh. If I can't get in any other way, I'll pick the lock. The "no one closes the door" defense is silly and there is no privacy, it's just a game. When molerats stop spawning through concrete and steel, I'll stop breaking into locked camps.
---
The camp owners don't have to build for anyone other than themselves. No one is entitled to any part of the camp that the owner doesn't want to give you access to.
---
Nope, that's it.
---
They should just make it so that atomic shop camp items take up no camp budget
---
You don't even need a Vampire Weapon. If you have the perk blocker and using a PA you're already invincible except from those nasty poison clouds or poison dmg in general
---
I just checked and he only has 2 mods for the weapons and not the weapon itself.
---
"**My presssiusss**, not yours, **mine**!!!
---
I use squad maneuver and everyone in the group is happy
---
I've gotten a full 60 with a group of 4,bugs still spawned, the quest just refused to update to acknowlege our contribution...
---
I did not say I am entitled to anything, just curious why this is so common, calm down Karen.
---
It takes 2 modules to craft a weapon 1 module for armor
---
Weapons cost 2 legendary modules &amp; armor costs 1. Whether you get a 1, 2 or 3 star is random chance.
---
A fast travel point like in fo4 would be awesome
---
Noooo cant do that cuz then all the PA players would cry about how it's not fair and there's no reason to use PA
---
oh okay perfect. Thanks for that
---
It‚Äôs random - so the cost to craft is the same each time (no of modules required), there is no control over whether the crafted item is 1, 2 or 3 star .....roulette time....spin that wheel!! üëçüëç
---
good to know. thanks
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten the picture at a fissure to work, what did you win your camera at?
---
I was going to do this event for the first time and someone like that showed up. I haven't touched it since. I was shooting legs and he was just blasting, then he ran out of ammo, died then I was alone and got destroyed
---
It's random what star lvl you get. On my SS armor I get two stars often. Last time I made about six pieces of armor and half were two and the other half three.
---
It's a game that includes collecting and displaying in game items, yet people hide it all away in locked rooms, just seems a bit pointless.
---
If this was a offline game then OK but we do share the world with others if playing on the public servers.
---
Silo code challenge has never worked, it always says 0/2 no matter how many you collect.
---
I just really feel like RNGesus is watching over me today.   
---
Thanks man
---
I also failed to pick that up. Users‚Äô names are so tiny on my phone. I never read them.
---
You sure it protects from waterborne as well? Most helmet descriptions I have seen just mention the airborne.
---
It's not us, it's that astronaut lady.
---
oh okay nice to know. So it aint all that bad a chance to get something decent. Thanks man
---
Do it in photomode, for some reason it doesn't register with the camera.
---
1. Be in power armor wielding bloodied junkies ray gun of death
---
2. Ignore the scavengers and instead kill ghouls 
---
3. Fail the event
---
4. bEtHeSdA fIx ThIS
---
Get off my lawn...
---
Yeah, but there are no hacked weapons on PS4 to record...
---
Defend friendly animal is vague when it spawns nowhere near the feeder, and gets killed before anyone can find it!
---
What  I do to mitigate this is go into a camp mode, find the camp unit, and move it to the furthest point from the actual building, literally right on the green border.
---
Now people and myself spawn at my camp below the cliff face, with cardboard vault boys directing them to my camp.  No more issues.
---
OK, good answer, I'll respect your property, I'll respect your ring piece üòé
---
Were you at my event earlier this morning? This is exactly what happened.  =)
---
Your fast travel location is linked with your actual c.a.m.p. unit. Move it to spawn in elsewhere. Generally, wherever you place it, you‚Äôll spawn like 10-15 yards north east of it, so just plan accordingly
---
Well obviously it's not, but at the same time, why do you give off the impression that you should be allowed inside other people's camps to look around?
---
It's like the people who come on here to complain about others setting up traps at their camps.
---
It's their camp, their base, their home.... Not yours.
---
I usually have a room, or sometimes an entire floor locked off to others where I keep stuff I like, or have the area set up for my character and nobody else.
---
My current base has a door specifically designed for curious nosey people, where on the top floor, there's stairs leading to a door to the back of the building. If you open it and rush through, you fall a few floors down onto a walled in platform filled with spike traps a fire and a scarecrow. Once you struggle past all that, your only option is to jump into the irradiated river below, then surrounded by my locked water purifiers..... If you get past all those, I made my base extra wide, so you still have to swim a distance to make it back to the shore.
---
With a little luck, you take some damage, a bit of radiation, maybe a disease and a dent to your pride. 
---
There's flashing lights, a Safety First sign and a sign saying Employees Only, so if you go through, you only have yourself to blame.
---
I‚Äôve read that under 2/4 the plans don‚Äôt drop and the chance only increases with higher ranks. 
---
Unfortunately there have been a lot of posts like this and people still don‚Äôt read.
---
I do only have 2 gigabytes of storage saved
---
They were there in the BETA but players started to set fast travel traps with them on cliff edges etc.
---
Thanks. I think I can craft flamers so Ill try that one instead.
---
I collect in excavator on RR quite often, drop in rad resist card, pop rad-x , slam that radaway.. I can avg 20-30 ores per session this way while holding down ghouls with the spinner.
---
For bloodied and junkies: faster fire rate, faster reload. Get the tri barrel (dont use the penta) and prime the weapon. Much easier to craft a hell lot of ammo for it needs and deals better damage as any tesla capacitor.
---
Beth forgot to turn of critter spawn after Fasnacht?
---
Give the more complex endgame content 'unique' incentive? 
---
Atm you have an higher change to get a B2525 fixer from running around whitesprings with a tesla (due to mob density) than putting in a fair chunk of ammo and a good weapon killing the queen. Strangler Heart gear was such a driver to learn the vault raid! (Atleast imo). I reckon these new features should be reasonably challenging (need to be in a team of 3+) and offer exclusive rewards that alter weapon specs or something along those lines.
---
I normally team up &amp; share Rad Sponge perk, problem solved there, but I never did check if Excavator PA collects extra...
---
Yeah this is what I ended up doing, using photomode in the Chinese Stealth suit at the fissure down the road from Bleeding Kates
---
What i suspected then. Oh well Ill just pick something else I guess. Thanks for the confirmation
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt like playing with militant Nazi jerkoffs that yell in their microphone like it‚Äôs the single most important thing in life and the world will come to an end if absolutely Everybody doesn‚Äôt do Exactly what they say.  So yeah, despite knowing how to to play the events, I just don‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt get the noob, you get ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù.
---
they are also very hard to place I find, and dont want to go on foundations ...?
---
You put thought and work into a complex trap camp and deserve all my junk, you're not really the type of player I'm talking about.
---
Solomons farm , then hop,down to whitespring station, wear excavator PA.. copper problems gone after a few days
---
Impossible. I already erased her from existence to help with her headaches.
---
This is quite an overreaction to an issue that YOU can easily work around.
---
Definitely don‚Äôt forget to deposit ore. I‚Äôve had a few times where I‚Äôve seen other people running around in the tunnels presumably collecting ore, and then when time is running out I deposit my ore, and no one else deposits anything.
---
Agreed, tbh, this event is what heavy is for. =)
---
I saw someone during scorched earth yesterday that had this glitch happen to them too
---
Sounds like a cool trap, I'm in. I've run into a few trap camps in my day, some of them pretty inspired.  Always make a point to travel without junk when I snoop around in camps.
---
Yeah well Fallout 4 allowed you to do the same thing and it was indeed, a single player game. Some people still play this game single player and don't team up. They designed the game with both types of players in mind.
---
I have stuff on display but I design my base as I see fit and don't seek approval from other players in what I do in the game or my camp. My displays and my building is for me, not others.
---
I'm tired of losing imposter sheepsquatch kills because the fucking body disappears.
---
Sorry to upset you, you do you man... peace out!
---
Ha well I didn't make it to take peoples junk, it's more of a prank. Only maybe the lowest level player might come close to dying. I got a junk collector and a collectron getting plenty of junk and I do regular runs. I have no interest in taking peoples stuff.
---
Behind my locked doors are vendors with free ammo, aid and 3* weapons and armor.
---
You'll find like minded people here: 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) as the name suggest we play casually/ slow.

These guys are great, always willing the help: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PKOA/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKOA/)
---
All the time! It seems to happen when I'm online for a while. It might be a bug related to server uptime.
---
Bethesda, No! Wait. My mom. No! Wait... Bethesda.
---
 tried this and caused dmg to them instead of healing them.
---
Go with gatling plasma. Gauss minigun has issue with ammo being too heavy and expensive.
---
I'm pretty sure it happens on flamers more than shotguns, flamers are just used less so it's less documented. 
---
source: I get this bug a lot and use both a flamer and a shotgun, it ALWAYS occurs on my flamer first. (when it happens on my flamer it's usually only a matter of time before it starts happening on my shotgun though.)
---
Scout is better than marine in everything.
---
Marine is,stat wise,one of the worst armor.
---
Thay said,if you find or trade a top roll like that on marine,it'd still be extremely valuable and usable.
---
Huh, you sure a ghoul or something didn't hit them? I don't even know of any ways to damage the scavengers.
---
rad resistance.
---
There's a static spawn of one at quarry x3.
---
Same. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MgPV0IWWrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MgPV0IWWrk) 
---
Any newes about fixing it?
---
the hp bars are shown, it tells you to defend the animals, and animals have questmarkers on them, that is far from vague as far as the event goes.
---
an argument could be made about server lag delaying things, but that is an issue with the server(s), not with the event being "too vague."  (i do think server lag needs a fix, dont get me wrong there)
---
I was wondering how I can help her, thank you.
---
But why? Very few people play pvp and those that play are toxic as hell. Bethesda want you gone, not improve pvp so you keep playing
---
Yeah it's along the western river, so you can't swim to the other shoreline due to it being the end of the map.... If you fall through that door, there's only on way out of that mess.
---
Of course if you have aqualad/girl and a marine wetsuit, it's only the spikes you have to worry about.
---
And that's the one door that will ensure I try to get in.
---
This is a big brain moment.
---
Like leaving a crawler on CoD Zombies, but better
---
Absolutley agree with you! I feel like this game is MOSTLY meant to be 1-4 ppl content and not whole server content (with the exeption of queen and earl williams). I wish BGS added just one feature (hopefully like the expeditions) that is more complex than some of the current events to satisfy the playerbase who enjoy that strategic stuff (because we do exist). Ideally that'd require moderate skill &amp; gear + a team of 3-4. I hope they add in game text chat I feel like that would make the teamplay/social interaction smoother. 
---
Add some expedition scenarios each with 2 or more bosses/enemies that have some actual fight mechanics!! PLEASEE!!
---
Seriously OP, either move your CAMP module or just fast travel out.
---
All good, I'm not upset in the slightest. Just having a conversation.
---
Rad resistance is useless. You'll never reach the ability to survive a nuke anyway. Choosing rad resistance over damage resistance for the occasional swim in the river,is a terribly inefficient decision.
---
For my 4 man group, after 60+ food added to the troughs it spawned just friendly bugs, and they spawned in a hallway full of stingwings, they instagibbed within the 2 seconds of us finding out where they were!
---
That's why I travel to a location near the camp and walk
---
This was the way it was suppose to be but I guess it was to big of a task so they just watered it down to Settlers/ Raiders. So disappointing when they announced it.
---
Ash heap between striker row and hornright testing site in the hills there's a lot of copper ore, also loads of blight and ash roses.
---
Letting them know how thay will feel after there frist blue screen
---
  I may still have a multi-star legendary in my inventory.  IIRC, one of the stars is reduced reduced weight. Don't recall the other two.  doesn't suit my build, so I'd be willing to let it go.   
---
 aj-98 in game. psn is aj ninetyeight
---
tbh that was exactly what I was thinking of as justifying their actions
---
they have a point, and really I hope they'll explore the differences between natives who see their home being invaded and colonists who see themselves as enlightened settlers among savages, and force you to make long-reaching moral decisions. As it is you're still friend to all, enemy to none, no real penalty for any decisions (aside from one legendary mask, and my money says you'll be able to get one later, because money)
---
The caravan bungalow now lets you walk trough the window side walls and jump trough the roof on the sides.
---
I didn‚Äôt buy this pack when it released, so I don‚Äôt know if it ever had porper meshes, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt have them now.
---
if you got 20 food in each? iirc level 1 is bugs/weak friendlys.
---
60 in each? (180 food) then that is definitely a bug that happened.
---
i already covered the markers in my last comment.   
---
none of the above is related to being vague
---
Reporting it now to make sure they are
---
The public team system is a step in the right direction but guaranteed some exploit will come out and they‚Äôll have to be disabled for 2 weeks
---
Everytime I‚Äôve attempted this event it‚Äôs either just been me or with 1 other person. I didn‚Äôt know it was new at first and when I tried it I kinda saw how impossible it is on your own. 
---
All them Ghouls are bad but then the Albino Deathclaws start popping in.
---
&gt; aged
---
Exactly this!  Drives me bonkers to come back to my camp and see the door left open and the rad shower running!
---
It glitches out like that every time we run the event, public or private server. And the vagueness is them spawning in an area you have no hope of reaching to protect them! It needs to point out the spawn point before they arrive otherwise you have no hope of protecting them!
---
Well here's what I came up with based on my experience and the general opinion of other players regarding these sort of builds which include the mutations if you scroll down:  
---
[Blodied Unarmed Build suggestion](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3458ab&amp;d=s92sf2ss2sg2se2eh2eu0cr0ir2a72a12a00lt2la2l71i44c72au2pe2lu2&amp;w=ce0c13i30ia0i50pa0p80p90&amp;m=2cef8gh1&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w0&amp;wm=112133)
---
Let me know what you think and if you have some questions.
---
Do we have a full list of SCORE rewards yet?
---
Whenever I see a locked up camp, where the vendors are outside and everything else is squirreled away, I make it my mission to break in and leave a propaganda flyer or insult note on their bed.
---
Added
---
not necessarily. as a bloodied stealth build, nothing is more dangerous than environmental rads.
---
I die more to radiation from the fissures than the actual mobs.
---
If only you could tame them.
---
What system are you on?  I would join you in shaming the bastards.  I swear two months ago people knew how to do this event.  Now no one even shows and if they do it‚Äôs a shit show.
---
Did you get the sweet RAM expansion for your Amiga 500?
---
Good luck finding either of those sets for sale mate, expect it to cost a fortune (you probably already know that) I'd go scout out of the two, if it were me, which will likely be the more expensive option as well.
---
For the notes I assume
---
In the hotel lobby, lower level.
---
Yeah that was the last one of the original quests, the only thing to do after is grinding all the wastelanders stuff ad nauseam.
---
&gt;animals have questmarkers on them -snip-  an argument could be made about server lag delaying things (like the markers), but that is an issue with the servers,
---
as seen above, i have already mentioned the markers.  they exist meaning it is not "vague" and they are marked.  the problem is the latency of the servers causing a delay on the markers appearing.  it is a server issue.
---
Yep - on the characters I have running Thorn (scout base, no native rad) I have to use the rad backpack and/or carry lots of rad shield.
---
Even a few points is super helpful on a bloody build.
---
If 3 points is all you have i would go  tenderizer 1 + bloody mess 2.
---
Tenderizer is bot worth 3 points when the 1st level is already 80% of it. But you'd still have that nice lvl 2 bloody mess.
---
Yes, that is why I said in PTS.
---
Private servers with all team mates coming from the same country shouldn't be causing this type of lag!
---
You can scrap anything at any bench. No cooking stations though.
---
Marine would be less expensive....but Scout Armor is better, although you have to buy the mods from MODUS.
---
I have three complete Scout sets that I‚Äôve retired because I got SS armor that‚Äôs substantially better.
---
As someone with an elaborate camp, I don‚Äôt understand it at all either. Only door I lock is my jail cell
---
Why are these pics so cruddy?  Beautiful mask...lousy pics.
---
true. I feel 50~100 RR is the sweet spot. more won't make any difference (about 1 less rad damage for +50RR) but at 0RR you take a ton of rad damage. the difference is quite noticeable.
---
And her nightmares... Why just why?
---
Grabbing a workshop is cobsidered a quest,but defending it is an event.
---
For the material,the easiest way is to simply bulk your needed materials and break those bulk down again. You'll lose about 50 plastic,but the challenge will be completed in 1 minute.
---
I have hardended, Extended, Aligned and perforating. Sights not needed.
---
it's what i've seen recommended the most.
---
If private parties ha ether bonuses then no one would really do the public groups. The point is to give people a reason to do them with randoms
---
I literally can tell the content by just looking at the title. Really do think there's this discord that prioritize in spamming same thing over and over on this subreddit I swear
---
I would just like to see more baby versions of creatures in the game. And children too.
---
So the mini 106 with 11 electric damage took 50 shots
---
The gp is 142 took 9 shots 
---
Both are vamps. The shot count is on a level 95 behemoth. Same perks no adrenalin. No demo expert. So yeah the gp is much stronger
---
older guide but mostly still viable  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
They were datamined with the PTS.
---
Nice one, I honestly will start doing the same, even though they may never find it still, it's the thought that counts.
---
Can I do this with a non legendary shotty?
---
This. When you get to the point that you can even survive the sbq, go. If the others kill her, you will get your repair kits.
---
There was an event that spawned legendary mole miner "treasure hunters" and the rare bag was a .01% drop. Or you could spend 6k caps a pail and also have a .01% drop chance.
---
Cool, do you know where I can find this? Sorry reddit search function is shit
---
Your next quest is to keep launching nukes until you've nuked every part of Appalachia
---
They‚Äôd lose money on backpack skins so that isn‚Äôt happening
---
unless you're bloodied and/or speccing specifically for carry weight, I find regular armor and PA balance themselves rather well when it comes to that. my PA/non-PA builds always end up with about the same total carry weight. not to mention excavator.
---
DR and ER are all but useless, too. past a certain point at least. you get diminishing returns around 350? some say it's less, some say it's more. but it's there. and PA have more than enough DR/ER. that on top of innate damage reduction AND rad resistance.
---
I'll give you the unarmed bit, though.
---
Did this get fixed?
---
it was during fashnaut, and i had lvl 3 friendly and a faster swing  Shishkebab . there where no mobs around and  i tried to heal them. watched the yellow bar drop a bit when i hit instead of go up thought oh shit and stopped swinging.
---
you only need to scrap one. doesn't work with the marine one, by the way.
---
Must have missed you on Monday due to pesky timezones I saw your message from 5:30 am at midday üòï
---
deleted my previous comment. misread your post.
---
you can scrap any piece of combat armor to unlock the helmet recolors. light arms are the cheapest to craft.
---
I haven't used a flamer in 76 at all so I have no experience. I know flamers just got a big buff to damage with wastelanders though. While shotguns haven't been touched since their massive nerf almost a year ago.

Serums.
---
will it also give me the helmet recipe tho
---
What do you mean, not enough favorites? Is there a limit on how many things you can favorite that I don't know about? 
---
I just favorite all the things I'm currently wearing, problem solved. If I have to switch outfits for a challenge or when I'm in PA, I just don't scrap what has a little heart next to it.
---
I normally don‚Äôt run into that issue because when I do run RR I‚Äôm already in a party with people so I can tell them when we can deposit the ore all at once
---
no, for the helmet itself you need to scrap another helmet. it's a 100% chance though.
---
I like this, but why not go for ironclad?
---
It gives the effect, but only for an hour as I understand ?
---
How on earth do magazines and bobbleheads that weigh 0.1 each take up 45% of your 800 lb stash budget? That's 360 lbs. There aren't 3600 bobbleheads.
---
Is there a walkthrough guide on IGN or somewhere?
---
Yea and if I find out someone slept in my bed and ate my porridge too... That makes me angry. Someone could say it's unbearable.
---
Nope, it gives you the effect. They also remove the negative effects for an hour.
---
well i have scrapped around 5 of them and did not get the plan
---
No, it gives the effect permamently, it reduces the downsites of a mutation for some time.
---
No, it's not 100%, chance is actually 20%. I've helped one guy lately - he was lucky to get it learned after two helmets scrapped, but I get it after around 10-12 scraps.
---
I've began to grow attached to the idea of building miniature town like camps. You have a big enough building area to realistically create the illusion when you're inside of the compound. The problem is trying to do this most often results in my building limit being left with like 25% just for decorations. So I end up with build limit to really decorate interiors, since the rest needs to be dedicated to street lights and exterior decore. 
---
A compromise I found is just locking the doors to prevent exploration into unfurnished buildings.
---
it is? wow. I did all the helmets in 2 characters and learned the plan first try every single time. thanks for the heads up.

Nobody is learning history from these statues, they‚Äôre a piece of oppression from the past and should only exist in a museum

would you be able to assist me   
---
its okay if not
---
I run one point of tenderiser and full bloody mess.
---
Wait, you loose the card if you put in the wrong code?
---
Beats me?  I will occasionally lock essentially the utility area to corral a collection if I have one out.
---
Then again, my wife thinks that it's "cute" that half the time I've barely decided a CAMP is the way I  want when I have an idea that probably requires a complete rebuild and I'm off running.
---
Exactly
---
Sure, can help you today evening, around 8PM CET, my ign is Baronik
---
Interesting thanks, I just gotta find the Australian email address now
---
Oh hmm, either a mutant shot it from a distance or it was a visual bug I'd say.
---
Although that would be interesting to try to replicate in another event if it was actually a you doing the damage. Did you get a hit marker / damage value pop up?
---
Herd mentality has a bug where it may not show in your pipboy. You may well have it - try teaming with somebody and see if your SPECIAL changes.
---
While yes there are some dumbasses out there. The issues is things are so spread out. I spend all my time doing rep grind and mire events hoping for leather coats (never gonna happen), so I‚Äôve never done Radiation Rumble, and only did PP and Encryptid once or twice. Many people have their own routines so they might join something for the first time even if they‚Äôve played for years and are going to be trash unfortunately. Doing events like you mention unfortunately all but requires   you have a solid team of your own, relying on ransoms is never going to work.
---
Pvp is dead and with the way the balance is in this game no way to have a good pvp experience. So unless they nerf some of the one shot builds pvp will always be a troll way to play nothing more
---
Interesting thanks, I just gotta find the Australian email address then!
---
Look up AngryTurtle. He has some *amazing* videos. In one of them he shows you how to solo the Sheepsquatch with power armor a 1* Bloodied war drum. He uses Scorchbeast meat instead of Nuka Cola Quantum which is somewhat easily farmed.
---
I have an explosive shotgun to cripple the legs and I leave the ghouls laying on the floor but EVERY TIME some chameleon twat with a silenced auto handmade sits on a barrel killing them all. This goes on for a while until I get sick of trying to explain and I just go get ore. We fail most of the time because they think they are rambo and half the ghouls get through to kill scavengers. Which they do nothing about from their barrel.
---
What could we possibly do about it?  If you don't like it don't spend your money on atoms.  And even then I promise you that will not do anything because for every person that says "im not going to spend money on atoms anymore" there are 10 others opening their wallets.
---
I wish we would get discounts on bundles as well if we already had some of the items but I'm not sure what we can "do" about it.  I'm not going to "boycott" atoms for this cause because I don't think it's worth it and I like to spend money in the atom shop.
---
ALWAYs carry a spare card and be extra careful putting in code
---
Can you do Metal helmets? If so, can you help me crafting some? I provide mats, we can do 5 pieces batches and 200 caps (or one flux) for a batch.
---
um im not able to be up at that time  8PM CET is 4AM AEST
---
A surprising amount of builders don't account for the marsupial mutation. Or put workbenches by the windows. Rookie mistakes.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I will do that from now on thanks for advise.
---
Lol I saw the same glitch yesterday
---
I'll be online probably until 11PM CET if that help
---
What's so scummy about this?  The cost is the cost.  If I own mass effect 2 from the playstation store and then I buy the trilogy they dont discount me because I already own mass effect 2.  Dont buy stuff from the store if you cannt afford it or grind more shoot robots with a banana cannon  challenges.  Help me understand your view here.
---
"I built my camp in a bad spot and now I'm angry at everyone else even though it's my own fault!! grrr!!!!!"
---
Thank you, so are you saying going in, collecting ore and depositing it straight away is bad, i have never understood this event so i have just left it.
---
I would heal, but if you aren't on my team, well...I really cant
---
My stepdad hurt me. Then Bethesda hurt me in different ways.
---
Yes, but need enforcer card to get the best results
---
Olay so where else does Bethesda show those images with no explanation? Nowhere that I'm aware of. On their site they always list the names and prices of new shop updates
---
ill add you and see if i can find time before school
---
when you talk to him he rises through the top bunk of the bed as well, hilarious XD
---
I get them often from the riding shotgun event. They are on the list caravan guards.
---
That‚Äôs only what, three perk points in agility? A worthwhile investment I think.
---
The patch just makes ganking harder to do.
---
Are you talking about french doors or do you literally mean two doors stacked on top of each other in one door frame?
---
Beth should make the syringer have healing bullets, which can hit players.
---
You have to search while *in* the subreddit. It has to include the subreddit name, like ‚Äòr/fo76 raiders or settlers‚Äô.
---
I feel the same way but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs scummy. I mean look at how Bethesda reacted when people started cancelling fallout 1st when fascnatch was suppose to start but didn‚Äôt because they couldn‚Äôt get their shit together.
---
Tbh I lock my stuff inside just incase some one finds another glitch to hijack my stuff.
---
Yes, you just need the enforcer perk equipped.
---
[Here is a guide on stocking your shelves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPtspIGzBtQ)
---
Yup. Which is why you always keep some spares on you.
---
This guy has to be the most buggy NPC in the history of video gaming.  I can't even begin to count the weird places and positions I have found him in..
---
what's NCR?
---
This is a very rare glitch and it's only possible for the first 15 to 30 secs after joining a server.  And if a theif wants to take your stuff bad enough people will always find away so I dont sweat the small stuff
---
yeah, sure. don't worry about the mats. I'll take any fuel you can spare though.
---
you'll be on around 5:30 hours from now right?
---
True, if instituted with pool selection. Was thinking side quest, not event or daily - like Heart if the Enemy or Mayor for a Day, which have a guaranteed reward.
---
I'm a relatively new player and got the bundle with the jetpack. It seemed like a fair price to me, 500 for the jetpack alone, 500 for the wallpaper alone, and 500 for the backpack alone, or buy it together to get it cheaper in the bundle. 
---
Is the issue that you already had the jetpack thus making the bundle pointless? (Not being funny just trying to understand what you mean)
---
Because it costs gold for the plan
---
I can't be that business is trying to make money. How very dare they!
---
Did not know that. I once had to do a run twice cuz I had to abruptly leave after using one in Charlie. Went back the next day and just typed in the code. But I never mistyped the code before.
---
It's like the band nickleback, nobody admits to paying for atoms or first but I dont need to jump more than 3 camps to find a scrap box and nuka cola decorations.
---
Thank to him I **can** kill queens all day.
---
So I could actually solo this with enough practice.
---
Don't really understand this rant - are they forcing you to buy those cosmetics? Will it give you any advantage if you'll buy those items? It's simple - if you like something, you can buy it. If you don't like or don't have enough gained Atoms you don't buy.
---
Hmm you think that was the reason why they reacted quickly?
---
If you run Speed Demon, it overrides the reload legendary boost.  In that case, I‚Äôd say 90% reduced weight is the only beneficial minor effect on a heavy gun.
---
Lmfao thats a good comparison
---
elaborate please
---
Excellent, I'll be around 7PM CET and I have around 1,8k fuel to spare ;) I think we're friends already, if I remember correctly (if not, my ign is Baronik, remind me yours).
---
I'm always looking for this event to spawn, but try to give other people time to join before I start it. The last time, I had been on a server for several hours waiting for this or PP to pop up. I saw the notification for RR, and hopped back to my base to offload my crap, and grab my shis/change loadout, and FT'd to the event.
---
I got into the lobby &lt;2 minutes after the event started, only to see an "Event Failed" notification, and a level 30 in janky PA running back up the ramp. There wasn't even a single dead ghoul in sight.
---
I am always conscious of my actions in game, and try to be always respectful/helpful, but holy hell, that time, I gave that newb a thumbs down.
---
A simple text chat would solve all of that instantly. "Hey guys, make sure we're all doing 'x' and do NOT do 'y'."
---
Here we go lol it‚Äôs scummy because instead bundling all relative items for what most bundles go for at 1200 they are trying to trick us by saying a bundle is on sale for 900 but the one thing that‚Äôs missing from the bundle is 500 more atoms. I mean if you can‚Äôt see that you‚Äôre part of the problem
---
lol
---
it's funny how they insult you when you are standing close then go into dialog and they are polite.
---
"i don't trust you, no offense"   
---
"finally, someone who can help"
---
There are multiple spawn point there's a main (which is 90 percent of the time) and secondary spawn locations for if code reads there is something ( an enemy, player or npc) are to close to main spawn point.  
---
This may not be the same for everyone but its what I have experienced. I spawn in at the same spot everytime I log a my camp unless I show up and it's being attack then I log farther away
---
And that would be me... Veteran player, first time trying it last night. Not a clue, just went with my instincts. My main character, tank/melee. Just locked down one hallway/passage by myself. Held the line, not one enemy got by. Too focused on the task, not  helping with collecting.
---
In full disclosure I know I heard something similar from a comedian but since useless quotes is something I pride myself on I cannot identify the correct one
---
When I do this everyone just goes around headshotting all the ghouls I‚Äôve imobilised rather than collecting ore.
---
My bobblehead collection is for my benefit, not anyone else's.
---
I believe so because you can actually not only cancel you‚Äôre fallout 1st but get a full refund, at least on Xbox.
---
I got a better idea. Remove pvp entirely
---
Please stay on context of the discussion if you have nothing to add please don‚Äôt
---
I have hope that the new public teams feature coming will alleviate some of this. Better to have a group ready and communicating than rely on randos.
---
no, on PC all 3 most popular ones with those stats (Heavy Combat Armor, Marine and Scout) are "duplicated", not that rare anymore.
---
There are other ways to implement lategame.
---
Additionally, I can't see working complex objective mechanics, regarding how bad and unprecise movement and aiming is + the lags.
---
This game is for ppl who just want to chill and take it easy. Give us some rewarding grind mechanics that everyone can play in their own tempo (no timegated seasons) and everybody will be happy.
---
If no one shows up I've just been doing it solo and failing it just to farm XP off the ghouls. Although I just got a junkies shishkabob for my junkies melee and with friendly fire I can heal the NPCs and do almost 1k damage per swing. Now to find that in game unicorn of competent randos.
---
What problem? I got 17000 atoms because I find that store be be woefully underutilized.  Pricing wouldn't matter if they would actually focus more on the prefab, gun skins, and building kitsch instead of this kiddy northman obsession or "OMG julie likes nuka cola so let's make a quest for her and I'll decorate my camp so she will visit me the poor lost soul!"
---
I explained in a earlier reply. If you still don‚Äôt understand my opinion please let me know
---
Tested, it does not.
---
If only there were some way for people who know what their doing to group up easily.
---
After you clear the four sections, the ore respawns slower, it's beneficial to have someone else with you who is able to swap roles, and actually keep NPC's alive
---
If that's the case and someone wants to donate a set to a good cause...
---
I didn't realise, but I'm not too surprised tbh.
---
Swapped out a Vamp Combat Knife for a Buzzblade and now I go around thinking I'm Leatherface!
---
that's perfect, thanks. I probably don't have you added any longer, had to nuke my list a while ago. ign is helltoast
---
let me know once you're available. just to clarify, you mean the helmet itself right? not the recolors?
---
I‚Äôm not argue if that and agree with you. I‚Äôm arguing the fact of how they are trying to pull a fast one on us and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying is scummy
---
What's out of context? You're complaining about a business trying to make money. Are you planning on arguing with everyone that points out this bit of common sense?
---
&gt; You‚Äôre telling me you immediately knew that encyriptid works the way it  does? Highly doubt it. Either someone in game told you, or you read it  online. 
---
Pretty sure you can figure it out based on terminal entries . . . I mean, I never googled it but I caught on pretty quick.
---
*Then again, I actually take the time to* ***read*** *terminal entries . . .*
---
Lol ok
---
be sure to remember to bring a keycard.  
---
I think the silo reminds you when you enter but if you leave to get one, you have to get back before it refreshes.
---
my plan just went from op to p
---
I never lock my doors, I even leave my water purifiers and scrap bot unlocked. And my door is usually wide open lol probably extremely unsafe within the wasteland when I think about it.
---
It would be fun, but we‚Äôre talking about F76 here.  They pushed back two of the four features planned for p20, one of which was planned for summer 2019.  Wastelanders was pushed back about six months.  75% (or more) of the new content arrives with bugs or instability that need to be slowly ironed out over the course of the next few weeks or months.  I feel like dynamic shifts to the landscape is just asking for trouble.
---
It seems like the studio has all it can handle as is.  They barely have a handle on what already exists.
---
The what now?
---
With every gun I've used that has fr it dose work. So does lock and load with heavy guns.
---
So u just didn‚Äôt read and now you are mad? I hope they don‚Äôt refund you just because of this huge post for nothing.
---
There's two timers now. Letting the event linger in the hope that everyone will suddenly start playing instruments just in time while mobs are bashing at them, seems like a good way to fail.
---
It's not they're everywhere and are worthless, but when dupers multiplicated whole sets, they're more easy to trade - I get get my Heavy Combat set for free (long story...) and Scout set I traded for 2 legacies and one good weapon. Marine is crap, so I didn't bothered.
---
Go play fallout 4 if you want a settlement
---
Not really. You could maybe down all the ghouls alone, but you need I think 3 people's worth of ore to complete the event.
---
Ah, crap. Well that‚Äôs a shame.
---
Please actually respond to the comments.....your making this alittle cringy!
---
New California Republic I believe
---
When you are doing the riding shotgun event you have to find the 4 missing crates of loot. The guards next to the crates usually have a cowboy hat or a combat helmet on them.     You can do this event every couple of hours I believe. I‚Äôm on PS4 or I‚Äôd save helmets for you
---
So they are still worth a lot, makes sense, basically god rolled stats.
---
And people wonder why pvp is dead in this game
---
thanks
---
Yes, need helms to scrap - I'm completing my craft and mod abilities and just yesterday found that Metal Helmet is also craftable and I can't craft it, so I need to supplement it ;)
---
Please leave if you‚Äôre not actually going to discuss the actual issue or bring a actual point of discussion
---
Much like Bethesda do, board up the buildings to save server load, makes sense to be honest.
---
I swear people like you are precious jewels! Also people who use Cryolators in sbq fights.
---
This game is hardly an MMO, but could easily be and more readily attributable to say, Destiny 2. The issue with the loading screen instructions is that if you load too quickly, or even just look away, you'll miss it. No further prompts. The on screen instructions in the corner are great for status reminders on where you should be and what you should be doing. The issue here is that a lot of the more complex objectives require either coordination (in a game without text chat) or doing something other than shooting something.  
---
Look at Destiny's public events (haven't played the most recent ones) or even their Forges. In Forges, you shoot things, shoot bigger things, get orbs, throw orbs at big thing, continue shooting things. In the end, if you completed all objectives, you're rewarded with a decent reward for your effort. If you failed, you're still rewarded for trying, but with what is essentially vendor trash. Now of course Destiny has raids and strikes with more complex mechanics, but typically, you just flat won't advance until you figure it out. Their's less of a timer, so that's not really a fair comparison. With public events, you just won't find many objectives that don't involve shooting something, whether it's a weak spot, shiny thing, big thing or tall thing.   
---
I think the secret is reworking objectives in a way that they can be done by fools looking to blindly shoot everything, but if you pay attention just a tiny bit more, the reward will be greater. These events need to offer proper compensation for difficulty and time. What's the harm in a 3\* leggo chance for each successful completion of a more challenging event?
---
&gt; my problem is carry weight 
---
Of course it is. You want to have your cake and eat it.
---
I take it that you're a newer player. People easily forget that back before the Wild Appalachia DLC, people were constantly complaining that they were forced into power armour because of the carry weight. 
---
Then backpacks came along and make non-PA builds viable since carry weight was comparable. Backpacks don't dominate vs PA under normal circumstances.
---
Carry weight difference between 15 raw strength special vs PA is only +20lb. Add deep pockets to all armour pieces. That gives you +50lb. Add the backpack +60lb. +60lb again for high capacity mod. That's a total of +190lb.
---
Excavator PA gives you +200lb. +210lb if you factor in motion assisted servos.
---
That makes them comparable. Under normal circumstance that any average player could get to without having to rely on luck or trading is about the same.
---
Where things fall apart and the only case where it does is someone using unyielding armour where it blows it out of the water. 
---
It's funny that just by eliminating unyielding would blow out the normal vs PA unfairness out of the water except for the very edge case of weight reduction legendary effects on armour that are so uncommon that even discussing how unfair this effect is is moot given the situation.
---
\+190lb vs +210lb. Outside of talking about how unfair unyielding is, there really isn't much to talk about.
---
I love getting excited to go to Radiation Rumble because there's a bunch of people of people there and when I get there every single one of them is just killing ghouls in the main room. Literally nobody getting ore
---
Yep, I still use them and slowly working towards the SS sets, but my luck is crap - only set for my Uny Unarmed character is acceptable - my Heavy gunner and stealth commando still trying to get good rolls.
---
Thank you all for your information. I‚Äôve only done this event twice and failed horribly. Now at least I have an idea of what to do.
---
I just tested this on my sniper, and by Jove you‚Äôre right.  The difference is very small, at least between Fixers.  I had to do it 4-5 times to be sure.
---
"bad and unprecise movement and aiming is"?
---
Do you really have that much issue with it? I don't use VATS, and I have no issues with movement or aiming. Usually I'm hip firing without even bothering to ADS, and haven't experienced many problems at all.
---
I want more complex events. I really enjoy Paradise, Rumble, and Encryptid. Just killing bugs to keep pipes/bots alive is boring.
---
What's the reason for waiting for everyone to deposit the ore?
---
"What's your thoughts everyone?" *gives thoughts* "Leave if you're not gonna say things I agree with"
---
Just don‚Äôt use pa if u think it‚Äôs u set powered easy
---
They do. It's rng.
---
Your thoughts on what I‚Äôm trying to discuss not shit talk you can leave as well :)
---
Two reasons actually:  
---
1- It's too expensive your paying 5 perk points for and extra 50 DR and 50 ER when Barbarian can give you up to 80 DR for just 3 perk points and Dodgy can give you up to 45 DR and 45 ER for just 3 Perk Points.   
---
2 - Diminishing Returns the benefits for DR / ER start plateauing around 300\~ / 305\~ so Ironclad/Barbarian/Dodgy lose their purpose once you get your hands on the current end game armor Secret Service Set   
---
For legendary armor effects specifically, the diminishing returns beyond 300\~ DR/EE mean that 15% damage reduction gives you more protection than the 175 DR/ER from a whole set of Vanguard's or Bolstering  armor. So look for Troubleshooter's, Zealot's, Mutant Slayer's, Ghoul  Slayers pieces, as well as 3\* armor with the 15% reduction while  blocking/standing still/sprinting effects and just so you know Lone Wanderer is one of the best defensive cards in the game because that's a flat damage % reduction.
---
For plans worth exactly zero caps because they were super duped.
---
1. Get ur self to 20% Health
---
2. Equip Glow sight
---
3. Get ur Quad FF -25% Handmade/Fixer ready
---
4. kill kill kill
---
5. loot loot loot
---
Dun care about colleting Ore, Teammates or what ever...
---
I believe I‚Äôve replied to everyone else just except you and the other brilliant person
---
Ugh trying to roll Uny SS is a ballache, I still only have a Uny chest I think.
---
The BoS under armour gives me +2 strength and my PA gives me +1. In under armour I can carry more and hit harder than in my fusion powered robot suite. Not to mention the back pack.
---
Watch yourself profligate.
---
To add to this, Private teams are already likely to have players with perks suited to their party members needs,  whereas mostly solo players won't.
---
Not all solo players want or need the extra XP and quest rewards, so this gives them more options if  they choose to group up with other  players.
---
And I asked and/or care why? You just replied to me now and you sound like a pretentious ass. If you're gonna open something to discussion don't tell those you disagree with to leave because it completely counters the point of a discussion.
---
I always solo the event... dont even get hit or loose a scavanger.
---
Impossible Event? Its way to easy!
---
I actually enjoyed vault 94. It was actually tough especially when the timer was getting low. Then again I ran it with 3 other guys who knew what they were doing. We all had a part and were able to consistently beat it daily.
---
Just give us the equivalent of D3 rifts, with a sliding scale we work up until we find the sweet spot of what we can clear before it's too challenging. 
---
We don't need complicated goals, or a timer breathing down our neck.  
---
Just give us massive waves of enemies attacking us.  If I have to defend a place from a few hundred charging scorched then there's actually a use for me to spec into high explosives and make use of the auto-grenade launcher and fatman to blow holes through their lines while snipers &amp; melee deal with the stragglers.
---
The more ores you deposit the more powerful enemies spawns: floaters, deathclaws, I don‚Äôt know what else. But it seems even if no ghouls can spawn, these higher level enemies will still spawn.
---
I was going through JC's list myself a while back. the radium rifle is hell.
---
all good, then. 7PM is a bit late for me but I'll be around. just hit me up once you're online.
---
I went to the Crater and Roxy was sleeping, I was almost afraid to wake her up.
---
Saw it at the skii lift up to the top of the world, followed me for a split second than snail walked down the mountain getting stuck on every other stone. Just killed it and got some hide I guess
---
People post notes with the small letters looking for stuff all the time. Usually saying PM me. Put it buy your vending machine.
---
I‚Äôm not telling those that don‚Äôt agree with me to leave I‚Äôm telling the ‚Äúoh look a business trying to make meh meh meh‚Äù to leave. If you can‚Äôt read my previous replies idk what to tell you I‚Äôm not going to keep repeating myself if you can‚Äôt scroll up a little to read
---
No..
---
For ammo efficiency gp definitely wins, many creatures and events drop cores, but not a bunch 2mm ammo.
---
It helps if you look at the game as if it was put out by a scrappy, little independent studio. It helps you get over the fact it's a buggy, hot mess where the common issue you're having would have been fixed long ago.
---
Yeah it can take a while to find a good legendary for specific guns sometimes since there are a lot of weapons that can drop so for that reason I just created whatever guns I wanted to use until level 50 and just saved up scrip until then. 
---
   You can send a friend request by opening your social tab i just press esc then c to bring it up but it can be buggy sometimes so I'll send you an invite too when I log in
---
That's not how that works but okay!
---
also if you FT to your camp while being in your camp you'll also have a different spawn point though I've never encountered any difference to when my camp was under attack, each time loaded in in the same spot even with enemies spawning right in front of me
---
Sell to robots ontrain stations (limit 1400c Daily)
---
Put some stuff in vending machines in camp and trade with players
---
Selling purified water for 1400 caps per day helps.
---
I sell mothman egg omelets along with whatever excess junk and chems ai have on hand to make daily caps limit..
---
I just picked up a pretty good bow and crossbow. I‚Äôm looking forward to switching up my build a bit.
---
Number two has happened to me a few times when in PA, now I wear Troubleshooters armor and it doesn't happen anymore.
---
Anything added is part of the discussion. You are telling them to leave, and for what reason? And again you went pretentious "I'm not gonna keep repeating myself if you don't scroll a little to read." You tried to hold a discussion while looking down on people you disagree with. That was your major mistake.
---
Sure. I have problem with Pipe Gun - game lists 66 mods to unlock, while I have unlocked 65/66 - problem is I went through the list of the mods and I have them all available to craft?!?! Wasted like an hour yesterday and can't find the missing one.
---
‚ÄúGood. You‚Äôre not awake. I‚Äôm impressed.‚Äù
---
I mean.. really. You seen how those pvpers tried to crash servers using hacked weapons as a protest against bethesda? I knew they was all hackers but this is too much. I'm not kidding man. Pvpers are like poison in this game. They need to be stopped
---
You can add pockets to any (haven't checked every single one though) armour and use a backpack on all. For your comparison to work all PA should have the excavator bonus. This would be fair comparison if the backpack only works with say leather armour. The BoS under armour gives me +2 strength and my PA gives me +1. In under armour I can carry more and hit harder than in my fusion powered robot suite. That's not taking into consideration any bonuses from legendary armour like +1 strength per piece.
---
Most peoples endgame is showing off how much crap they bought at the atomic shop...
---
And of course hinding  vendors so u have to explore their entire damn camp.
---
Now hate me Foodbuilds!
---
Prior to displays and vending I felt it unique to have a powered door with the access code below the keypad. Complex camps kinda drive me batty when I'm looking around for vending (vending that is underground, locked up and my personal favorite to date a stack of picnic tables) and checking out their collections. 
---
I don't have a crown jewel collection but,  no longer have a powered door in fact I try to have a flow to my camp... one enters through small farm towards garage, where my vending/displays and a few benches from there the house where one can derad and sleep (some more displays inside) after leaving the house there is the fire pit where one can cook. The only thing not in the mix is my "shiner shack" which if someone follows the lamps will be able to bullets, booze and bunky chems.
---
1. Sell in your vending machines things people want. Many things sell. What you find in other people's machines is unsold merch, so you should do your own thinking on this. Price to sell. Restock often.
---
2. Explore and collect caps around the Wasteland, aided optionally by perks that increase what you find. Maps to caps stashes are also an option.
---
3. Sell to the vendors things players won't buy from vending and you don't want, to collect your daily vendor limit. Then, spend with vendors for things you want, then sell more to the vendors to collect the remaining percentages. Some folks farm junk (any item they find, for 1 cap each minimum) and some folks run purifiers to farm for water.
---
Jeez I can see what you guys are talking about now I apologize. Looks like my phone didn‚Äôt actually reply to some of you and instead just kept posting down the thread. Just to clarify Bethesda has gotten in to legal trouble for saying bundles where on sale from 1800 atom to 1400 atoms. now they are splitting items from bundles in disguise of sales but we are still going to end up paying 1400 or 1800 for what should‚Äôve been in the bundle. They are creating essentially the same situation now
---
LOL. The level of condescension from you two is wild. It was a mistake on my part for sure, doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the limit needs to be raised. Good try though.
---
Yes it was in the atom shop around the time wastelanders launched.
---
Sorry about that went over my head to say there would be spoilers.
---
You're so over dramatic, and very much generalizing. I've seen PVErs do the exact same shit, but sure, whine some more. 
---
Imagine thinking people are toxic for enjoying PVP, frankly, you sound pretty toxic yourself. Get a grip.
---
Heavy
---
You're early. The NCR won't even exist for another 80+ years. Shady sands is still a shanty town at this point.
---
Sorry for raining on your NCR parade.üòâ
---
Awesome thanks for the in depth reply! I will starting by selling a lot of my junk to the vendor so I get the 1400 to start with :) thanks again!
---
Really? Have you actually went through and cancelled first? I have and I‚Äôve gotten a refund and so has my wife even months later.
---
Will give this a go only have the 1 purifier at the moment
---
I tried to look this up and mabye because my phone is se to Amerika but could fine this.  Can you support a link?
---
My vendor is outside my house. My garage has all the stash, scrapbox and crafting stations open to everyone.
---
My house it's self, I lock the doors. Some times I just want to idle or tinker undisturbed.
---
Apparently that's a no-no because everyone and their scrapbot will PA glitch or find a piece of furniture a pixel too close to a window to get in. Throw flares and grenades all over, open every door inside, turn off all the lights and emote in my face until they get bored that I'm not reacting to them and fast travel out.
---
Seriously, wth, people.
---
If I leave my door open, sure come in and look around. If it's not, and you're done with shopping or crafting, move along quietly.
---
Sell everything you don't use, farm purified water, complete events (level appropriate)
---
Yeah I used to be a pvper myself. Was quite devoted to be honest. And I was considered rather subtle among my group. Hope this gives you an idea
---
From the bank or bethesda?
---
oh boy free stuff \*oneshot deathclaw\*
---
The animation being left-handed, and the arrow sitting incorrectly on the arrow rest make the bow unusable for me. I was so looking forward to bows, but the animation just hurts my brain
---
you have the scorched killer mod? it's not on JC's list.
---
other than that the only ones that come to mind are the two prime receivers. and the plans you have to buy.
---
Yeah. It makes a pretty big difference on heavy guns. I can certainly tell with my 2 gattling lasers. And when I ran lock and load it was incredibly fast(when it didn't bug out and make it super slow lol)
---
Was about to post something similar. Deathclaws used to be the alpha predators. Now it's the player. Definitely not a fan.
---
It's actually not designated yet. In PTR none of the legendary perks work on it (according to Angry Turtle).
---
Thanks man, unfortunately I'm on PS4, keep doing what you are doing to PC players its a great help
---
I mostly started converting over to a kinda stealth bloodied build, so with the bloody gauntlet which that effect i got randomly i wouldn't of tried bloody without it lol but since i got it I love it, I now run perks a long with my low health and bought adrenal reaction recipe anyway on radiation rumble I mostly run back in forth between both sides and with my gauntlet also glowsite perk I can one hit most of the ghouls coming in. So I try to protect my teammates while I let them collect
---
You need charisma for selling to robot vendors although you don't necessarily have to invest points in it. It's a good idea to have 3 points in hard bargain. Grape mentats improves char and prices. Certain booze and foods like sweet rolls will also boost that stat.
---
Taco Bell confirmed canon?
---
I've never been a dick at someones camp, I always close the doors and leave presents in bags if I think the camp is clever and the owner is actually there to see it.
---
I do sometimes glitch into camps through doors or windows if possible but just to look around, then Fast Travel away.
---
I guess some people are just bored so make their own fun?
---
Imo it mostly comes back to ignorance. Even games like world of warcraft that, historically didn't but now, basically spoonfeed you what to do yet people still can't figure it out, because they either don't pay attention, skip quest text/voice over, or just don't care. Fo76 is no different.
---
Oh, well I'm going of what the community told me when I asked a while ago. Does it work with any of the existing perks?
---
Luckily, you only need to input the code once per silo, per week. Once you've entered the right code, the next time you do it will tell you you've already entered the correct code....
---
Last week I soloed the event with 0 deaths and 0 ores and it was failed for me. Don't know where's the threshold.
---
You would think that, 40+ SS chest pieces with anything but butressed/vanguard and everything from breathe underwater to scorch damage but no + agility or perception lol.
---
Exactly! I barely use the existing Teams system as is it, since XP isn't shared for some asinine reason, and Events always feel iffy, too. Fortunately, I'm usually more interested in trying to get the completion rewards (still hunting the last two Raider underarmor linings), but otherwise...? Teamwork would be much more appealing if it didn't mean essentially missing out on all the rewards you'd get running around solo just shooting stuff in the face.
---
Same here, I can stand right in her face and never die with my Vampire Gause Minigun.
---
Yes, I know how the events work because I know how to read loading screens and corner objectives.  It‚Äôs a joke that some level 200s still can‚Äôt comprehend the simplicity of Encryptid
---
Yes! For sure thanks! Hit me up with your username on a DM and I will definitely add when i got the time.
---
I'm soo lucky every time i do the event there are ppl who know what to do and some noobs.
---
PS4
---
Same happened to me but with different dialog of hers. Try switching servers it fixed for me eventually
---
I know
---
 Love him and mitzees work^^ 
---
Most of the Times im just caught off guard
---
Ok who was I looking down on? Please tell and I will apologize. I don‚Äôt disagree with a lot that was said. I actually said I agreed with a lot of it. You‚Äôre attacking me and getting upset because I asked to read an earlier reply I made where explained my point of view. I was asking the one person that was saying something about a business trying to make money. I‚Äôm not arguing that point and it sounded like the were just trying to troll.
---
You.. I like you..
---
Ok, will do.
---
The fact that it says in the top right corner. Defend until Pylons are active, activate Pylons then a giant message appears in the middle of your screen telling you that "The Imposter Sheepsquatch is vulnerable" . Pretty hard to figure out /s
---
It took me a grand total of 1 minute to understand that was the objective of the event. Even Project Paradise tells you exactly what to do, it's not vague in the slightest...
---
Yes, downloaded it yesterday from the Fire Department terminal, but turns out it didn't count towards the total number 66. Check this awesome spreadsheet with all mods in the game ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=1792554793](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=1792554793) \- for both weapons and armors) and I have all mods listed there (both that counted towards the total and those which don't) and can't find the missing one...
---
I normally use excavator for everything. Yes, I'm poor. It does NOT grant any extra ore at all in RR.
---
Yeah I'm sure your bloodied Power armor food build was so great. I really don't care. It gives me 0 idea and I couldnt give a single fuck about your group or how "subtle" you were. What does give me an idea is your trades and how little you seem to grasp the worth of items or even the usefulness of them. So yeah I doubt you PVPd much Mr. Subtle. 
---
You're a turbo nerd who doesn't enjoy something so he has to bitch and whine about it every chance he gets, and literally everyone that does enjoy it is toxic? Seems pretty toxic homie.
---
And the gain from lowering endurance?
---
Don‚Äôt forget that you can often take other people‚Äôs water. Sometimes it‚Äôs locked but sometimes it‚Äôs not.
---
I thought it was weapon artisan that repairs guns to 200%. Not sure if it works on bows but the fact is says weapon artisan and not gun it might work?
---
People are just guessing at this point. My personal guess is that it will be sturdy. I base this on the fact that it is using same material mods (buttressed etc etc) as trapper/marine, both of which are only available as one type of armor, and are in fact classified as sturdy.
---
Oh, okay. Thanks for the clarification
---
I heard a player say "oh, is like the ender chest" when he understand how stash box work
---
Using his guide and using stronger buffs/better armor it‚Äôs actually really easy. I have a set of Ultracite Power armor and a BSS pole hook, as well as Nuka Dark and Quantum. Dark gives me 6 strength per (although it should be 9 because triple 1 is three and triple it again is 9.)
---
I don‚Äôt agree in this particular instance. 90% of the game is straightforward and easy, and then suddenly there‚Äôs a couple of quests that aren‚Äôt obvious. That‚Äôs an anomaly. Humans learn by mimicking and watching patterns form. If you‚Äôve got a pattern of explanatory and easy quests, you‚Äôre going to be surprised when a quest isn‚Äôt as straightforward as the already-set precedent.
---
I switch between my prime bloodied ffr fr and my junkies ffr lvc both are god tier weapons. I suggest running the default barrel. I hit 110s at render range with the right buffs.
---
 
---
### 200617-004743 is the ticket number in Bethesda's Support site
---
Very nice!
---
i can help, ign Ruskes
---
AHHH! I mean like French doors yeah
---
Lol you are the one to be talking about being toxic. I'm 100% sure you're a pvper as well. You have that toxicity. I can tell
---
I had a similar thing, but mine was actually a problem with the quest log. She gave me the Wastelanders mission, but the quest marker for her pre-Wastelanders quest was still saying to talk to her. It might be worth checking that the game didn't activate the wrong quest.
---
I almost never see it pop up. I love going to it, but I can be in a server for a few hours and it won't show up.
---
Then when it does no one collects and no one protects. They all just go after kills and then the scavengers all die :(
---
I am such a fooking idiot lol. Half asleep and doing a Reddit post ain't a good idea. Let this be a lesson kids.
---
Gonna leave it up so I can be down-voted to oblivion for my stupidity lol.
---
How do I check?
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6unw9/bethesda_why_are_you_saying_things_in_the_shop/
---
That‚Äôs where it was discussed when it happened back then which led to their change in price and what I‚Äôm referring to as to them being scummy again
---
Where does it explain what‚Äôs happening when you suddenly start taking massive amounts of damage, which is a unique situation in the whole of the game? 
---
You‚Äôre missing my point. The game is very straightforward generally, and then suddenly a couple of events and unusual, don‚Äôt work the same as ANY other mechanic in the game, and you‚Äôre surrounded by other players all doing different things - half the time, there‚Äôs a level 400 making fun of the newbies or saying they‚Äôre shit and aren‚Äôt helping. You‚Äôre contributing to that
---
Legitimate question buddy!
---
I run max bloody mess and 1 rank of tenderizer on my junkies commando.
---
Bethesda but like a said I‚Äôm on XBOX!
---
Where does it explain what‚Äôs happening when you suddenly start taking massive amounts of damage, which is a unique situation in the whole of the game?
---
So you contacted xbox support or bethesda support?
---
Pure evil! I'm in pacifist mode because I have no interest in pvp but I'm a bit trigger happy. The last thing I want to do is accidentally shoot a level 100.
---
Yep, a waste of time imo
---
O a reddit comment not a news story got it.
---
Just say it "ppl are stupid" it diesnt hurt. Its a fact
---
I've played since BETA and haven't used a syringer yet, this would at least give it some practicality.
---
Yep, the exp you can get soloing it is just nuts. With heavy PA build and 60% bonus damage to glowing enemies, it's almost non-stop killing. Went up two levels in one run during the last double exp event.
---
Go to a workshop and turn on build mode. It‚Äôs still in game my friend.
---
Doesn't it say in brackets (my stashbox) or something to that effect? It was never explicitly explained but I thought it was fairly obvious.
---
I went to my fallout first account and it gave me two options cancel and refund or stop renew. Do you even have first?
---
THIS! 
---
The bow is the only left handed weapon in the game. Why? It looks odd and takes up half of the screen. 
---
Bethesda needs to look at other games for bows work.
---
You already struggle with staying alive, do yourself a favour and don't go down the bloodied route till you are really ready (in terms of perks and gear) - you will die even more, takes some time to get used to.
---
I usually sell my limit to the vendor then i collect and sell a lot with my player vendors, especially tbh me getting serum recipes helped me a lot ive made the money back off of them so many times that i usually buy another recipe
---
I'm level 260 and 175 and stay in pacifist mode all the time. But for trap camps and trolls you gotta use it against them. They set their camp up to kill people or are PvP set up there's not much you can do but be devious if you want revenge.
---
Give me all of your caps and I'll tell you
---
*World of Warcraft PTSD intensifies*
---
So what do you suggest? And if i do a new character, what path should i then go to end up there?
---
I had the same thing. I think it was something to do with my budget being more than 50% full, and it was confused that it was over 50% full but I wanted to build something more than 50% of the budget, and it couldn't quite do the maths properly in typical Bethesda fashion.
---
HOWEVER... Deleting the "blueprint" it made broke my camp down for me, saving me a bunch of time in the long run.
---
I do love me some junk
---
Open your Pip-Boy, go to Data, then Main.
---
I‚Äôve done this event many times.  I‚Äôd say about half the time it fails because people sit back and don‚Äôt do anything or they use the wrong weapon (melee) which makes the rest of our jobs more difficult. 
---
The name of the game is choosing a weapon that has a FFR and causes splash damage.   Grenades or mines are also very effective.
---
No, it won't have any end game content cause Bethesda insists in making content mobile like with daily caps and daily cooldowns.
---
Wait, are you saying if im using an anti armor lever gun and the perk at the same time, the % from the perk will be less?
---
The lock on my door is to keep out the ferals, everyone else is welcome
---
You throw around toxic inreference to people enjoying themselves and group every pvper and griefer in the same exact category with no distinction like its going out of style, and then just want something flat out removed cause you don't particularly find it enjoyable, and you don't find that mindset toxic at all?
---
Stop projecting and quit. You're bad.
---
I'll happily explain to a player over the mic how to do it. I'm level 120, I'm never toxic over it. The fact that you say it's barely explained is completely wrong. The more I look at posts here the more I see players not so much as not understanding the mechanics but not willing to learn the mechanics and then proceed to be surprised that they failed the event and wasted somebody else's caps. That last point being a reason I don't buy recall cards.
---
Right like I‚Äôm in constant need of acid and lead. If ward just slapped with in the face with some of that I‚Äôd be gucci.
---
Herd mentality doesn't show up in specials but it takes effect, i been using the mutation for a while even got the serum recipe for it. And the first time I randomly mutated myself before serums as soon as I got carnivore I cured myself xD because I wanted herbivore because I have a garden plus spoiled food boost my food i may get a disease but I use that to my advantage with plague walker
---
what happens when you nuke crater tho?
---
thank you for donating the "very last and impossible to replace microscope" that you had to kill some random person for. Due to my buggy ass state, I will give you the Treasury Notes, but because you skipped my lines, you will not gain any faction rep. Please try again tomorrow when someone steals the exact same microscope.
---
So I'm asking you a serious line of questioning and you reply with do you even have first?  Yes I also have todd tattooed on my ass crack.  If this is possible in my country it would be great for alot of other services.  So if you have some magical way to get refund on a prepaid service then mabye I was hoping to learn something from you.
---
You know for sure if it‚Äôs ever released people are just gonna put a pressure plate on the welcome mat surrounded by rad emitters in a locked room to kill players fast travelling to their camp
---
Bugthesda.
---
Between the stealth suit and the SS jet pack there already is no reason to use PA. The only thing PA offers is rad resistance and a jet pack at the same time.
---
Yes it moves when you move your camp but where ever you move your camp it will run there like it did when you first tamed it
---
I always break down whatever non legendary weapons or armor for extra scrap
---
It was strange bedfellows
---
Have you submitted a ticket?
---
Or a text chat to explain the event. This does happen a lot in ESO. But then someone explains the mechanics and it usually ends up happily for everyone.
---
Jesus christ. That is ridiculous. Can't you craft new mole minor pails as well?
---
why not make it so you could use PA jetpack skins on the Secret Service Jetpack
---
Thx so much for your quick answer
---
"Did we test this?"  
---
"Nope"
---
...
---
"Good job boys that's a wrap! Ship it and sell it!"
---
it took me forever to notice i wasnt getting rep from him
---
Also get some water purifiers and sell the water. Good luck :)
---
I've been using a legacy cryolator in queen fights so people can take her down quick. Works like a charm. You can keep her frozen in midair and she won't be able to move.
---
Make a skin that hides the backpack and sell it in the store
---
I have been an auto rifle build for the last 200 levels.  I love my handmade and combat rifles.  But I‚Äôm strongly considering moving to a heavy build as I have some decent weapons and have about 60 perk card numbers I can use to respec.  I also run a fully modded T60 BOS PA most of the time.
---
Have got hard bargain so will give that a go with the vendors :)
---
Well that silly smile is already a deal breaker for me, not surprised its bugged tho.
---
Sometimes nukes do cause the golf club to bug out and you'll get either nothing or a bunch of protectrons or eyebots. Just unlucky this time by the sound of it. If you want flux mats Tanagra Town can be pretty good.
---
Vats grenades definitely needs to be removed.  There is quite literally 0 skill involved in using this tactic and it is way too strong.  
---
The ADS glitch is soooo annoying and it has been around forever and I can't believe it hasnt been patched.
---
I would also move the noob tubes to the orange crates instead of the yellow crates.  There is no reason there needs to be so many of them on a map.
---
The animation REALLY threw me off at first, I‚Äôm used to it now though. I‚Äôve been too used to Destiny‚Äôs now animation honestly lmao.
---
Seems like the XB NW population has taken a nose dive recently. You're most likely in the que, waiting for a server with at least 20 people.
---
I try not too take others but will keep in mind if get really desperate:)
---
Yeah, I only learned of this near the tail end of the grind.
---
There was always a massive disparity between my toons in their faction grinds.  The ones which sided with Settlers were pretty much neck-and-neck with the Raiders in terms of reputation, while the one who sided with the Raiders was about a half-bar ahead of the Settlers, like you'd expect.  This never made sense to me, until then.  Ward is screwing players out of reputation, which just provides another reason to hate him.
---
I have no idea why we have to loose it, if I had known that before hand, I would not have switched to Red Rocket armor.
---
Exactly my thoughts! :)
---
Yeah have seen a lot of people selling serums am not near that point yet unfortunately
---
Why do you have to wait to deposit the ore? I only did it once, collected 60 ore myself while everyone else let the people die and farmed, so I'm asking out of complete ignorance
---
Start with chems, water, and any ammo you don't use I always tried to keep my vendor near the queen stocked with all the big guns ammo for the queen fight can usually make a couple thousand in just ammo
---
Sounds like a plan I'll let you know today
---
What is the reason for not depositing the ore in step 2?  
---
From experience I've completed the event 7/9 attempts so far. I can confirm the following:  
---
\- if you collect 4 levels or ore, the event completes right away
---
\-if at least one scav survives, and at least one ore level,  you complete
---
\-If all scavs die, you fail
---
\-if 0/4 ore levels collect, you fail
---
Given that, your step 2 statement to "wait" on the ore deposit, seems to seem there is a trick that can skip you from 0-&gt;4 levels of ore completion. Is that what you're doing?
---
I‚Äôd say about 80-90% of the community is nice/helpful. I‚Äôve never been attacked by another player and I‚Äôm almost level 100. Have so many near stories about people giving me stuff or just being nice in other ways. Really solid community, the subreddit is 50-50 though because everyone here is biased and ready to defend this game to the ends of the earth if someone has a complaint or issue.
---
Mostly, but there are trolls. So watch out.
---
Depends. Where does your opinion stand on murdering people and bouncing their corpses around with a grenade launcher?
---
no.. everyone is definitely not nice.. for now
---
the way things are going soon there will be no choice..
---
This happens on high RoF weapons (including shotguns due to pellets)
---
Basically the server can't keep up with all the individual hits and only registers say 1/5th of them.
---
Your client is meant to simulate what should happen in-game so you get immediate feedback from your actions, and then the server is the "master" of this client-server architecture and it periodically sends your client an update of the status of everything nearby.
---
Because the server got it wrong and your client got it right, but the server is the one in control - the server overrides the health of the enemy *back up* and hence the rubber banding.
---
Bethesda mentioned a new ‚Äúinstanced‚Äù camps where they basically are load zones into an interior of a persons camp.
---
It would allow people to have a lot more budget because it wouldn‚Äôt matter how long it lol to load in the assets.
---
Did you try today or earlier in the week?
---
Smiley resets at 8pm EST Saturdays. The bug is that if you don't buy from him by some point on Monday (I believe) then you can't buy until the next reset.
---
Am still below 50 so havent tried any queen event and barely have enough ammo for myself lol
---
I'm not sure if it's possible but crossplay for NW between the two consoles would be nice because I've noticed watching twitch that it seems like PS players have to wait quite a while for lobbies sometimes while you can pretty much find one instantly at any time of the day on xbox.
---
Idk what to tell you or what country you‚Äôre from but it is possible in America and if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into good for you. I didn‚Äôt need to know what or who or where you get tattoos of. My magical way btw is reading. It was not as obvious an option as the cancel and lose access to first at the end of billing cycle. The other option was cancel lose first benefits right away and get refund. Hope that helps if that option is available in your country
---
Out of curiosity is the scrapper perk in FO76? Like where you get screws n shit from weapons and armor?
---
I wish I could figure out how to force this glitch
---
People who know what they are doing got the rewards they wanted and don't need to do it anymore. Think of how often you see riding shotgun trigger now. All that's left are the random "oh look a public event" people :)
---
Hey. Gotta be toxic to toxic people. I ain't no saint. I'd be lot less aggressive if I didn't know how these pvpers rolled. Sucks I used to pvp and know something and talk shit about them, sorry to say. Good luck trying to coat them with sugar
---
No you just need at least 1 level or ore collected and a surviving scav by the end of the timer to complete. having 100 ore just insta-completes, and gives better rewards.  
---
Solo you will need to wait the timer out and also get less rewards
---
I mean, there are plenty of negative posts that are allowed to stay up.
---
Yes I think the mods are way way way way too strict with enforcing rule 10.
---
From my few months of experience, most people are very kind and helpful.
---
But like anything online, there are those with Anonymous Social Syndrome.
---
My original response was that your analogy was shite. Advertisers are allowed to show products in settings &amp; scenarios that show ‚Äúaspirational lifestyle‚Äù without the ‚Äúreasonable expectation‚Äù that the lifestyle comes with the product.
---
The above can not be applied to FO76 as it is Bethesda‚Äôs world, everything in it they create.
---
I then went on to say that IF Bethesda used the image WITHOUT DISCLAIMER, then there MAY be a case.
---
I don‚Äôt believe if could be applied to the spending of Atoms as they are not legal currency. However, if the image was shown (without disclaimer) and this led an individual to purchase Atoms (with legal currency) in order to purchase items shown in the image and those items do not exist there MAY then be a case to answer. 
---
You tell me the images are nowhere without disclaimer then that‚Äôs fine. Your cocky car analogy was still shite and a complete non-sequitur.
---
I'd love to have some nice gunfights with the PlayStation players!
---
&gt;10  Do not make trading posts or posts that contain retired Bethesda Plz topics...
---
Find Super Mutants, kill, loot and sell. Super Mutants nearly always drop weapons which will go for anywhrre from 5 to 50 caps plus. 
---
Make sure you have the Charisma perk for more caps at vendors.
---
Any good crystal farming places, 2 crystal for 1 acid is awful
---
I can't tell you how many times that I was the only person actually following and protecting the objective in Project Paradise.
---
I suspect that oftentimes people know to be the conduit but don't want to take on that responsibility and are just hoping somebody else will do it.
---
The issue has several facets. In-game documentation for these events is not always clear, quest objective descriptions prefer brevity over clarity, and people are oblivious. It's surprising to enter into a group event and have a level 150+ player go "okay how do we do this."
---
Out of game documentation also kind of sucks. The wiki is just hard to navigate. Youtube videos are forty minutes long. The subreddit is full of whiners complaining daily that SBQ doesn't drop a three star legendary. There are a couple of fansites out there but a lot of their information is outdated.
---
A text chat would be a massive help. Shockingly there's no emote that communicates "go collect ore" or "stay here and defend" or "hey you can leg the ghouls." Not everybody has voice chat on. But if I could cut and paste a rough and dirty "okay two people collect, everybody else defend, say now if you're gonna collect or defend" it would be so much more clear what to do.
---
It's a frustrating situation because the game desperately needs more events with actual mechanics. There needs to be more encounters that require more strategy than "shoot a lot of bullets at it." But without decent documentation or the ability to communicate it's always gonna be a struggle.
---
Especially so when many of those placeable objects may cost real money to buy.
---
Why don‚Äôt you lot start taking down the ‚ÄúNW needs an overhaul, NW needs to be balanced‚Äù posts I see 10 times a day. That‚Äôs not retired yet? But the cap limit somehow is? Oooookay. LOL.
---
My friend had the same thing happen, he said he went to go to Abby's bunker and that fixed it. It's never happened to any of my characters though.
---
I tried to remember and I think no.2 happened to me when i was killed by pylon during encryptid.
---
This does absolutely nothing.  I've submitted three different tickets about smiley since wastelanders.  Every single response is: "We are aware of the issue with Smiley and appreciate your patience.  Keep your eye on our official forums for more information!" 
---
My last one was asking for reimbursement for all the weeks of gold I missed out on as now I am way behind where I should be in terms of progress of getting every bullion plan.
---
I think so, I‚Äôm mostly new to the game been playing on PS4 the past month with my gf and someone dropped by her camp and gave her a load of cool plans for her camp. I‚Äôve only had people be nobs during events or NW.
---
It stands for New California Republic. The NCR are a major faction in Fallout: New Vegas. Definitely worth trying out if you haven‚Äôt played it before.
---
Lucky hole mine has about 300 crystal in the middle part if you use Excavator PA.
---
Alright, I'll try that. Thanks
---
I made a post asking about heavy builds, and had a couple heavy weapons I picked up asking if they were decent enough to build off of or if I should scrip them, and one commentor said the T word, not even offering, just said I could probably do it, and my post got deleted.
---
Lol if you keep talking about it enough I'm sure it'll be true. Stay salty carebear.
---
It's mostly good for steel, assaultron helmet and super supper is what gets you screws.
---
I think fully automatics need to be removed or drastically nerfed. Its way too OP. 90% of the time I'm killed by a bunny hoping machine gun. The other 10% is multiple hoppers at full Auto.
---
I will have to look for that option with hulus, Netflix and the rest.  Good to know.
---
I think you hit almost all the sore spots. Personally, I don't think they should nerf the gauss shotguns until they do something to counter auto/semi grenade launchers. Those things are still way to prevalent, and the gauss is at least an effective counter.
---
Also, the multiple glitches after being downed (auto fire,  3rd person ADS, etc..) need fixed too.
---
I run NW specific characters most times, so never had any conflicts with SPECIALs.
---
I dont see why not
---
This happens to me if I'm on fire after the Encryptid event. Its a visual bug only, and my other friends don't see it So you probably looked normal to him.
---
I addressed the fact that my post didn‚Äôt meet those requirements, the only one it could have would be that I was talking about removing the cap limit. But I see the same posts every day talking about how NW needs an overhaul, or rebalanced and I don‚Äôt see those being taken down. Try again.
---
I think you missunderstood (could be my english too, not a native speaker) - of course it is okay to aim for a bloodied build and the one /u/Xion_Stellar suggested looks good. 
---
I just wanted to warn you to switch to bloodied too early, this would lead to even more frustration. Finish getting the perks you will need, collect/buy unyielding armor pieces and a good weapon on your way there and once you got all you need to make it work - go bloodied.
---
Yeah you'd wish I didn't pvp lol
---
Had you already done the Freestates quests? The issue seems to be that those are prerequisite but Bethesda has made a hash of putting it all together.
---
I use Action Boy, in agility, and AP Refresh armor.
---
Before I was using the hunting rifle a lot, so there isn‚Äôt TOO much of a change weapon usage wise. Bow has disgusting VATS accuracy as well.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to getting the compound bow! Not high enough level for it yet unfortunately.
---
When it comes to weapons and armor, you can sell some of them for caps. However, it is a balancing act because you can actually learn mods by scrapping them. So you will have to decide whether to scrap the item or to sell it.
---
Hmm have you tried just talking to you ally and see if they give you a new quest?
---
Happened to me as well after I waited too long to complete it. But I was never unable to receive a new quest
---
I think I remember that post.  Rule 10 covers 2 things.  Trading posts and posts from the Bethesda PLZ list of topics.  I think you were talking about how the cap cap needs to be raised.  That is probably why it was taken down.
---
Be on fire when an event ends. Kinda hard to time unless you are doing something like encryptid and just wait for the ISS to use his AoE fire then waste him.
---
Ha, I like glitching through their doors right in front of them. One guy had a bunch of locked doors and as soon as I went in he opened a door. He locked me out again so I glitched through again. This went on for five minutes or so until he messaged me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your problem kid‚Äù.
---
I messaged him back and said ‚ÄúI just wanted to show you your locks were worthless‚Äù which sent him on a tirade. It was great.
---
By getting rid of Iron Clad you went from a base 290 HP to 265 HP and those points went towards a Max out Makeshift Warrior which is far better than an extra 25 points of health.
---
Maybe make the explosive damage deal true damage
---
What is that even supposed to mean. 
---
Like really. Get your head checked and fuck off.
---
It's one of my favorite events so I appreciate the post regardless.
---
Would be nice if more people chilled with depositing the ore. Like, I'm always collecting. Ever so often though, people will keep depositing during the event, progressively making everything messier. But yesterday we were on track to get the 4/4 (and we did), but apparently 2 scavengers went down and one of the players did the angry emote. We ended at 4/4 with 2/4 scavs.
---
I'm always short on screws and adhesive..!
---
In regards to the shotgun crippling method...do the turrets finish off the ghouls?
---
&gt; You can add pockets to any (haven't checked every single one though) armour and use a backpack on all. For your comparison to work all PA should have the excavator bonus. 
---
It's not any, it's most. That minor issue aside though, to address the rest of what you said, it's not every PA vs non-PA situation. 
---
Let's take just the underarmour example (I actually forgot about that with my calculations), are you factoring in the motion-assist servos. That'd negative the underarmour effect since they're both a +2 strength bonus. Even addressing the +1 strength armour pieces. You need 4 pieces to be equivalent. 5 to top it just by 5lb.
---
However, this is all kind of moot. I was talking about averages. You can factor in one little bonus here or there like you mentioned to close that gap ever so slightly. The only thing that massively skews it that is reasonably common is unyielding, like I mentioned. That doesn't just skew it, it blows it out of the water. Add those +str legend bonuses plus weight reduction ones and it becomes ridiculous. 
---
However, how much of the player base in that particular situation. A decent bunch for unyielding given the meta but for the rest of it...? I would hazard to guess that those numbers are pretty low.
---
On top of that, this is purely about carry weight. We not even considering the other benefits of PA over normal like the inherent rad resist, lower weight and maintenance requirements and so on. There's a reason why most of the heavy hitters during the SBQ event are all heavy weapon power armour users. They don't need also superior carry weight options too, let alone all the other suggestions the OP made, some of which I'm not entirely against.
---
You might need to quit the game and try again. There have been a lot of quest bugs recently. You can try changing servers first.
---
I just don't see the appeal of pvp in this game at all. Plus isn't the other game mode more for pvp? They should go on that one if they wanna kill somebody. I have enough trouble with the bloody bears lol.
---
With the legendary effect of 50% more limb damage you will indeed
---
The fact that you can‚Äôt post pictures in this subreddit... even though the game has a photo mode.... was a huge red flag when I joined up. After that it‚Äôs just been made clear that if you are going to make a post about issues or things you‚Äôre unhappy with, you better be prepared to have it removed if you didn‚Äôt triple check to make sure you‚Äôre not even vaguely breaking a rule.
---
a conduit and some rugs are not really a huge portion of the camp budget.
---
Alright
---
I'm not 100% on that it was a buddy that had it happen to him. He waited for about a week then out of no where, some time after going to the bunker her dialogue fixed.
---
Stop fucking ghouls...it's weird.
---
Does anyone else never even have to go get the equipment? For me it just completes the quest when I talk to him. ‚ÄúI see you have our missing equipment‚Äù is all I hear from that guy.
---
I've got an exploding zealot's radium rifle which picks away at her nicely.
---
Well it doesn‚Äôt give Xp so few people go for it.. I don‚Äôt mind it really because with all the commando and heavy gunner builds my pistol build rarely gets a good shot in with its revolver.
---
it's so god damn slow though. like, it can totally save a situation and all. but once you start shishkebabing it's like, that's all you're doing. at times it seems better to just kill anything incoming so they don't get damaged.
---
All my doors and stuff would be left open, that's why I've officially made an outside base for everyone to enjoy
---
Yes I haven't had any problems running nw mode only characters too! Thing is it was just a qol suggestion for players that don't want to use a different character from their adventure without having to change the adventure modes build to run a preferred nw build.
---
"no way" is not totaly correct, it is possible to let snapped items drop down by picking and placing the shelf on a uneven surface.
---
If I see someone new, I try to pop by and see if it‚Äôs just a mule or a legit newbie. If they seem receptive to assistance, I‚Äôll drop them some basic gear and supplies, maybe some decent under armor or ammo, couple plans or whatever. I don‚Äôt use them, and it can go a long way for a fresh start, so why not?
---
I wish you could at least choose
---
‚ÄúAye man thanks for finding my shit for the 45th day in a row don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt keep up with it. Ite do you want some weapons and ammo or you want some fuckin garbage and food‚Äù
---
Allowing the mods to deem what is and what isn‚Äôt ‚Äúretired content‚Äù is the main issue. The community should be free to discuss any issue they have with the game, and acting like you have some say on and what can and cannot be discussed about the game on the.... SUBREDDIT FOR THE GAME.. is horrible.
---
Yes sorry should have mentioned the steps I took to "fix" the issue. She refused to give a new one after speaking. I tried scrapping/replace her station, also a different ally, also server hopping, also close application and reload.
---
Nadda.
---
I'll pray is resets on the timer from when i started the quest (11:30pm) and not 5:45ish PM when it dropped because I doubt I'll get it today if thats the case, I usually don't play mornings but had a trade lined up..
---
PS4 player here. Met more nice people than nobs. First guy to ever "grief" me immediately gave me free stuff, so I can't help but like that guy.
---
I have a habit of dropping Stimpacks or Purified Water around new players, just because I can.
---
You're first time?
---
I joke.
---
I like getting non legendary weapons and armor for scrapping for mods/junk but I really agree the misc. ammo rewards of like 11 .38 rounds and 17 rounds of 10mm is really stupid.
---
I'd say above 90% of the player-base are nice.
---
But the 10%...hackers\\duppers\\griefers, ect.
---
I would argue that is a trick, possibly even a glitch.
---
I have to confess, I sometimes when walking nearby, if there are a few minutes left I will stand there to take some easy reward, I'm sorry guys but don't have enough level to be helpful so just being a smart ass
---
Wait, what is the EM hazmat suit?
---
Good luck.
---
Lol they had (2) Red Rocket shop updates. I think they‚Äôre trying to get as many atoms out of us as they can before the seasons begin. 
---
PS- look up the owner of Zenimax media and read about his court case in the early 90‚Äôs. Bethesda has been pure scum since 2013 once the original owner was for ed out.
---
Action boy/girl and if you use VATS - grim reapers sprint. AP refresh armor helps a lot too, and of course using weapon mods like 'aligned' or reflex sight to keep AP costs low.
---
shotgun excels at this event too, just time the reloads right.
---
I‚Äôm mainly arguing that mods shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to deem content as ‚Äúretired‚Äù. That gives them the power to stop discussion on important topics simply because they think it‚Äôs talked about too much. But that‚Äôs not the only problem, they aren‚Äôt consistent with that rule unless it‚Äôs directly opposing something about the game. What about all these NW posts? How it needs to be rebalanced, the rewards for it, etc. How is that not retired yet? It‚Äôs very clear bias.
---
Yep PvP is dying and will be dead soon.   
---
I rarely do PvP but I do consider it the only challenging part of the game. The rest is to easy. Other players are much more of a challenge than any boss.
---
I had this problem while.
---
I suggested a "confirm trade" option.
---
Had quite a few up-votes.
---
But it was taken down due to rule 10 :(
---
They enforce on stuff that are related to trading too a small degree...they need to back-down on that....
---
Yes. Excavator looses it carry weight bonus if you mix it with other parts, though.
---
Rejuvinated in endurence is also good. Only 2 points to max out and its easy to stay hydrated and fed
---
I can always guess how good someone's vendor prices will be by if they lock their water purifiers or not.
---
I don't even get why people lock them. They produce water quick enough that there's no benefit to doing so.
---
You're right, it's a good suggestion. It would be nice to swap perks around in NW a little easier to tweak builds, or run different ones on the same char.
---
Well, posting criticism of the game in this subreddit is the equivalent of sticking your head through a noose..
---
To get the rare drops drops from the event you need to have the max amount of ore deposited. If you deposit no ore, then you will fail the event even if you kept the people alive.
---
Cool thanks 4 the help bro!
---
&gt; the dedicated high players who can't stop farming the queen for god knows what reason
---
same question, I ask myself every day.
---
Not really, though. We would still be left with overpriced redundant legendary perks with RNG dictating how many points you can spend, with a significant penalty to anyone who is already high level.
---
They should get rid of the scrapping cards for perk coins, and instead let us scrap basic cards to unlock the gold animations, rather than encourage us to trash our animated perks.
---
Make the perk coin system a static amount based on your level. Two people who are level 100 should have access to the same amount of points.
---
yeah. don't deposit straight away. straight away bad. close to end of event = good.
---
I mean if you play in a group you can keep track of how much ore you have and insta-complete the event at the threshold. in public though, heck I even lose track of how many I have. I just wait for the last 10 seconds or so, get some XP for everybody too, and then deposit.
---
when you deposit early you'll have deathclaws etc all over the place and it tends to get messy.
---
Doubt you'll see pvp enhancements anytime soon. The data suggests there's not a big demand for it. Even Bethesda said they overestimated how many people want pvp.
---
I don't see Bethesda ditching their roadmap to focus on Pvp, especially when you can't even field a full 4 person hunted team via the radio channel.
---
The mods are biased. You have to remember, these are people who are volunteering to spend their time, monitoring the forums. But what that really means is these are people who like having control over what other people say and do, based on how they feel at any given moment. 
---
There is literally no accountability on the part of the mods. They tell you all this stuff about being fair and whatever. But it's bull.   
---
I made a post with a link to a picture. It was of a dead ghoul slouched against one of my vending machines. I'll I said was, I hope vending gets turned back on soon, as I've got customers dying to shop. Nothing more, nothing less. It was taken down within minutes. And no reason given, like violates rule #.  [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYTL28iWAAAqIQc?format=jpg&amp;name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYTL28iWAAAqIQc?format=jpg&amp;name=large)
---
Ive seen about 2 greifers in 2 years, theres almost no ace ues to do so in this game past nuking fasnacht or killing a player pet
---
I refused to res a guy that died at the end of the event because he just ran straight in starting the event, while I was patiently waiting for more people to arrive. I feel you.
---
I just kill everyone and hope for a pleasant valley ticket...
---
Priorities get weird in end game.
---
Ah yes I should have elaborated yes I use commando. The AP reduction from using a automatic receiver and all the AP I have from running bloodied basically means I press Q to win on events like that and especially Line in the sand.
---
Jeez. Yeah, rule 10 is a joke because it‚Äôs actually two rules, and on top of that ‚Äúretired content‚Äù is vague and leaves too much power to the mods to decide what is and what isn‚Äôt worth talking about. My post had 50 upvotes, for a criticism that‚Äôs a solid amount. So they community agreed with me, but the mods clearly didn‚Äôt.
---
I've come I late seeing they're about to loose, it is important to have someone doing it when you're loosing people!
---
Imo this could all be fixed with simple text chat. Just look at the guilds in wow that compkete raids with no voice chat...
---
I'd say that people (including myself) don't do PP or RR because they are not entertaining, not because of "wasting time." This is a video-game and should be fun. I suppose there are critical flaws (about being entertaining) with those quests. I hope we'll have better quests in the future.
---
Aha okay, i see! So untill i'm ready to go bloodied, what do you suggest i use as weapons?
---
For a while, a lot of the mods of this subreddit, were also mods over at the general fallout sub. And that one was totally biased against 76. Even the mods there were attacking 76. So it was pretty clear how they were handling this forum. It's really is biased.
---
so I checked and counting the mods I'm missing (all plans), I'm at 65/66 as well. I also compared that list to JC's, since he based his off the game files, and it checks out. so whatever we're missing was added recently-ish. I'll have to dig through the files to figure what it is, specifically.
---
I'm online now by the way, so whenever you're ready!
---
It's bloody stupid, rule 10.
---
I always thought it was "Don't post trading post's", AKA, don't post stuff that are for sale...
---
Not "Nothing to do with trading what-so-ever".
---
lol.
---
That could be the case. I find pp fun, because of lots of stuff to do. But well it takes a long time to complete
---
LOL that‚Äôs a hilarious picture! A cheeky joke shouldn‚Äôt be removed at all, but isn‚Äôt there a rule about memes? You couldn‚Äôt even call that a meme really but I guarantee that‚Äôs what they used to remove it.
---
There is a list of retired content linked in the sub rules. It‚Äôs to prevent the same types of posts over and over again.
---
So in that case, will players who only buy digital versions be able to play them too? Or is it only disc versions? I have most games digitally due to not having space to store all my games, would be a bummer if it‚Äôs not possible to play them on PS5 on release
---
ive dont this before but like by accidentally locking my door üòÖ my favorite is getting into those buildings because a cooking stove or chair is right next to window
---
We need end-game progression content for groups.  Something that you have to put time and teamwork and practice into in order to complete it.
---
I really don't get it.
---
It should be no-one allowed to post "WTS\\WTT" posts"
---
Not "Saying the word "trade\\trading" gets the post removed".
---
Yeah, this is going to be hit with a Rule 4. I hope your tantrum was worth it.
---
You can always go to the SBQ fights.  If u can deal enough damage u get repair kits. 
---
I havnt used a bench to fix my armor or weapons in months.
---
But it's not a meme, and you are allowed to show pics from the game. It was exactly that, a cheeky joke.
---
Virtually, yes. Late game players get duplicate plans and an excess of consumables regularly so they its better to not let them go to waste.
---
If you're running solo, Lone Wanderer is pretty great for 4 points into charisma. Take 20% less damage and gain 30% AP regen.
---
I feel you are being extraordinarly negative. 
---
Yeah, sometimes it's a complete shitshow. But often it's smooth as butter.
---
The events you listed are definitely some of my favourites, and sure it can be annoying. But at the same time, I too was clueless at first. Reading the objectives is one thing, until you've actually participated in the event a few times you can start improving on the nuances. I'd like to think more people are like me and want to get better at it with experience and not just dumbasses.
---
You'll find all kinds of posts about bad trades, that don't get taken down. The mods will tell you that generally they just do it when there's someone reporting the thread. But no, that's not true either. They just pick and choose what they feel like dealing with. And if you complain, they will give you a temp ban.
---
thanks for the response!
---
You still have to type the code into the keypad every time before launching the Nuke.
---
Mods are available at settlers/raiders vendors once you unlock certain reputation levels.
---
BuT it HaS A vENDInG mAcHInE iN ThE piCTuRE
---
Well, you can complete it afaik. You just wouldn‚Äôt get the highest tier rewards. Kind of like project paradise. 
---
And if you are hella fast, it might be doable solo- the ores respawn. Not sure if they respawn fast enough to pull 100, though, along with the initial time to cripple all the ghouls.
---
Thanks!  I'll make a detailed post or video later.  It's something I've wanted since beta really.
---
Nope. You don‚Äôt.
---
Only once, per silo, per week.
---
right, right, right.
---
This wasn‚Äôt a tantrum and I was perfectly civil LOL. If they feel attacked by this it means I‚Äôm right and they‚Äôre overly biased.
---
Sony confined that all ps4 games either disc or digital will play on the ps5 and you can even still play multiplayer with ps4 players 
---
The 100 list people keep talking about is ps4 games that will run in a boost mode which I‚Äôm assuming just makes them player better
---
Action Girl/Boy and Lone Wanderer. Though doing both gives you diminishing returns I believe.
---
thanks for the response mate! no luck with SS yet
---
This has being civil so far.
---
We had that already (a raid) and it got removed because not enough players were playing it to justify the amount of time it would have taken them to repair all the bugs in it. Thus they just removed it.
---
See, they have already deleted your post. LOL. Knew they would.
---
On the same server... when you swap you still have to input the code before it allows you to launch a Nuke. I used run Alpha and while it only take a few secs you still need to type it in every time.
---
Awhhh thought you had a secret junk spot XD
---
Yeah moments like that I bet it's pretty damn rewarding to flip the momentum.
---
I think this event is possibly the most disliked event. Normally it's either just me or a random,  yeah teammates don't even like doing it. Trying to balance mining and protecting nearly impossible for me and leaving the random to protect the crew and myself mining/ repair... fail everytime.
---
The mods are biased and pick and choose based on whatever mood they‚Äôre in. I‚Äôve had posts be removed that did break rules, I‚Äôve had them break rules and still not be removed.
---
I was on break when V94 was out so I never did it, and I'm sad they removed it, but on the other hand, I mostly solo, team up with some randos for a short time here and there, and I dont think V94 is something to do with randos, u need some communication and understanding
---
so yeah, hope they bring it and more raids back in the future
---
I think if they actually made success matter more, people would care more about being successful. Doing more work for 5 scrip at the end or for a .008% chance at some item... not to mention the fact that it‚Äôs a thing where you could put in the work and somebody else kills the legendaries quickly and you don‚Äôt get anything. I can understand why people don‚Äôt care as much about trying. ‚ÄúOh we failed, oh well probably was a one star leather left leg reward anyway.‚Äù
---
From my experience everyone is nice, just make sure you have pacifist on I can guarantee you will accidentally shoot someone in an event
---
Aaaaand it‚Äôs gone!
---
And I am afraid that the upcoming seasons don't ad much to the endgame. I have not seen a game with intresting seasons. I hope that I am totally wrong.
---
i wonder if he robs ender chests in minecraft
---
Retired content isn‚Äôt vague. There is a list you can view. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz
---
so what if I wanted to solo?
---
Then3 guys I was running with were all randoms to start but once we got the hang of it we kind of just stuck together and grinded it out
---
Maybe the reason nobody played it was due to how buggy it was? The concept that "nobody is playing this broken mess so we wont bother with it anymore" would kill the entire game seeing as how nearly two years later we are still seeing some of the same bugs in the main game.
---
Did that with the pinkish energy. Mr. Gusty killed and I turned to ash, respawned with engulfed. Spent the rest of the time like that until I got disconnected.
---
Do you play on PC? I play on console and have to say that I rarely played games that felt so bad as fallout. Don't get me wrong, I love these games. Fallout 3 is my all-time favorite, but they feel so God awful it's like playing some ps2 game.
---
Compare that to a game like destiny for example. Those raids are unthinkable with the fallout movement / aiming (on console)
---
It will give you a reason to keep doing the same crap over and over. At least youll be rewarded properly for doing so. I think seasons will help, but not completely fix the issue.
---
I just meant if you had done  those quests that's why it wouldn't happen to you but would them. I had the same issue on one of ny newer characters which is how I found out about it.
---
I was wondering what the hell happened to my flamer!
---
I'm finishing work in 27 minutes, but will be coming back around 1-1:15h. I'll catch you as soon as possible.
---
Awesome thank you so much :) only saw people talking about disc, it was probably obvious if discs were going to work then digital would but had to make sure xD appreciate you answering me
---
And it was the best god damned piece of content this game ever had and ever will have.
---
We ran that raid every day 3 times a day for months on a private server and I can count on one hand how many times I had an actual issue.  There was a clear and easy work around for it.   "the vault raids were too buggy" is just false information spread by people who went in one time on a public server on the first day when everyone else was also trying to do it and they got a bad impression.
---
Almost every time I talk with someone who didn't like vault 94 they start by saying "Well I went in there once....."  
---
ONCE.
---
Eh. For me just making the number higher still kinda sucks. I mean, sure the bonus makes you OP but it's not that interesting. Hardly feels like a legendary perk.
---
I'm more interested in diverse effects that can really differentiate different loadouts from each other so people don't end up being all same-same. Kind of like class elite jobs/professions that other MMOs use for next tier character classes. Like how they branch off and makes you stand out, not just a stronger whatever you already are.
---
The posts need to be reported for them to get removed. Someone clearly reported your post. Don‚Äôt know why I am getting downvoted for just trying to share some clarity since you appear to be under the impression that they just remove whatever they want and call it ‚Äúretired‚Äù. There is a specific list of retired topics you can reference.
---
This happened to me last week. Server hopped several times but the game would not let me place my camp anywhere in the original circle that I had just occupied. I eventually give up and placed it outside of the original circle.
---
Something else that helps reach the 1400 cap daily vendor limit:
---
Butchers Bounty perk, kill animals, loot more meat, cook it, sell the cooked meat (cooked sells for more than raw).
---
I remember when they added The Burrows, that was supposed to be a repeatable end-game dungeon intended for a full team of 4 high level players. It was sort of fun, but honestly didn't accomplish the goal it was meant to. Aside from the odd legendary ghoul that spawned down there, you didn't get any rewards, and honestly aside from the better atmosphere it turned out to be about the same as a Whitesprings run killing swarms of ghouls. If they'd just made it a quest with a pool of worthwhile rewards at the end, it would've been so much better. As it turned out, we all sat there waiting for it to open, then ran through and said "...so that's it?" For a company with a record of incredibly interesting and varied quests in numbers that were almost overwhelming in previous games, they've really dropped the ball when it comes to interesting and repeatable content after finishing the main questline.
---
Can anyone share more photos of this bag on the ground?
---
Lol. Someone is downvoting every comment on almost every thread I‚Äôve looked at today. 
---
But on a different note, the game has always lacked a solid end game. Wastelanders was great, but it felt like the best appetizer you‚Äôve ever had with 3 day old left over meat loaf for the main course. Literally grinding old content to get a new currency to get new weapons and armor to use on the same old content. 
---
I love the game, just needs some more meat on the bones is all.
---
Prepare to be disappointed though. Most tamable creatures die within a few days of being tamed either dying to the world, despawning, or dying to a player.
---
I'm on board. This is going in my CAMP. .....as soon as I figure out what to delete, i have absolute zero budget left.
---
It might not be in the atomic shop right now
---
Alright, I'll play devil's advocate, here is my opinion about Rule 10:
---
The "Bethesda Pls" list is comprised of issues that have been raised repeatedly and/or prominently. According to the mods, Bethesda is aware of the list, and has used it to mould content in the past. So, if an issue has been added to the list, the implication is that Bethesda is aware of the community's desire for the fix/addition/etc. With this in mind, I can see why the mods remove posts that are a rehash of other previously raised issues. The goal isn't censorship, it's to reduce the volume of same or similar threads which can detract from other discourse.
---
You: "I didn‚Äôt insult anyone and I wasn‚Äôt rude."
---
Also you: "The mods on this subreddit are a joke"
---
LOL ok bud.
---
Just search paratrooper, newest posts. There was atleast 1 other post with a picture
---
I can't remember flamers _ever_ working with friendly fire
---
It‚Äôs from the Atom Shop called contraption building set i believe
---
At least it'll make me feel slightly better about enduring the never ending drudgery that is already present because I will be rewarded more for it.
---
I recently had a post removed that wasn't even uncivil about letting us display power armor in our camps (as many people have requested since launch), but pointed out that our Allies' can be customized so it's not a resource issue like many people thought.
---
As a footnote expressed disappointment in how we feel like we need to point out monetary value for a feature to get implemented. I mean how many posts have you seen where people say they'd be willing to buy it from the atomic shop? And I said the same thing about power armor skins.
---
Apparently that was enough to get rule 10ed.
---
Hmmmm crippling them so they don't respawn is a good idea, getting people to join is the hardest part lol
---
Contemporary building set*
---
Mine doesn't work anymore, does it have to be the crystallising barrel?
---
That‚Äôs it haha
---
flamer is viable as a side, main, top. it was buffed with wastelanders. fuel is still a b to craft, though.
---
I leave my door open to all guests, but my camp isn't too exciting. I lock my collectron and my ammo machine, but not my water purifiers. Also, if you can find an open window at a locked camp, and can use a workbench, sit in a chair, or lay in a bed through said window, you can teleport in lol.
---
Brilliant, thanks!
---
just take hemlock holes workshop for acid it has iirc 5 spots for extractors 
---
bonus points for super duper
---
People know what to do.  The game tells you.  They're just lazy and don't care if it's done right as long as they get kill xp and loot, and hope someone else does the ore.  
---
I don't think they care if it fails because again, xp and loot.
---
I pretty much only do this event if I have friends with me because wild players are just too selfish.
---
There's a mansion that has a ton of crystal decanters, the Mothman cult took it over after WL. I'll find the name when I get back on
---
Other builds are just as viable as long as ur perked out for it.  
---
Will they get the damage numbers of bloodied or junkies? Prob not. But doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt viable.
---
Even a normal, not legendary DCG or mole miner gauntlet with extra claw/blade will do fine for now, if you can find one with instigating or vampiric effect - great. 
---
Visit player vendors if you are close, maybe someone is selling a bloodied 1\* max level version for a decent price if you don't already have one. Same for unyielding armor, for a start even 1\* max level (45/50) versions will do even if you don't use it right now.
---
Glad to help. As someone mentioned before, it may not be available right now. Also worth noting, if you get the full bundle it comes with some really nice matching porch bits that aren't included if you buy just the wall set.
---
It's my favorite!  It's the wild players that are the problem.
---
I stopped playing World of Warcraft because people suck. A person can be good but hell is definitely other people. 
---
I see no reason Fallout 76 will be any different. I‚Äôll keep paying the fallout 1st single player tax and having fun.
---
Hmmmm crippling them so they don't respawn is a good idea, getting people to join is the hardest part though ha ha
---
I played the raid about 4-5 times. Every single time I played we were unable to finish because something got stuck or didnt progress like it should. This is an issue literally everywhere in the game (something not progressing like it should, requiring one to swap servers and hope for the best) and so it obviously was going to be a problem in the vault raid as well. Rather than fix a years old problem, they deleted content from the game that suffered from the problem disproportionately.
---
Power armor displays is a retired topic... that is why it was removed. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz

Figured it was just auto correct, but wanted to make sure there was no confusion. üëç

I have yet to successfully complete this event, so thank you for the tips! I'm going to have to go back and try again.

Hi, if you're on PC, we can play together.
---
I'm level 200+ and I finished all of my main quest. If you need company to do your quest or event in groups, I'm happy to join. Don't worry, I won't hog your kill or anything. I'm mostly support the team or solo. 
---
If you're on PC just add Tsumz
---
Grahm.  But it's still rareish.
---
I play always invisible in stealth armor so I don't have to see it :)
---
I still use the Burrows as easy XP for boosting my character during 2x XP weekends. If there was say... a button on opposite ends of the burrows and pressing one would spawn more enemies. Once you cleared them out, you had to run to the opposite button to get more. This adds repeatable fun to the game, is very simple to create, and maybe cap the amount of button presses per day or something so people dont exploit it.
---
Had this issue last night, i logged off and havent got back on yet. It was only doing it to my second and third character
---
I couldn't agree with you more but I get the sense that it'll sadly never happen, not without a significant change in management.
---
It's very clear that this product is a low effort, minimal resources, maximum revenue kind of game. They'd need more staff to keep up with fresh content. I mean they miss deadlines all the time and constantly have issues with execution. I don't ever see that changing without more people working on the game.
---
Ha, yes, most folks are nice or merely oblivious -- but don't worry, there are some real monsters in there too.
---
As far as I can remember from a post way back, you can turn in two for a cap increase but that‚Äôs it, only the ones you pick up will trigger the event
---
I loved vault 94. Best end game content this game had, now we have to wait for dungeons.
---
Don‚Äôt forget PA has an unlisted perk that reduces all incoming damage by 40% and with emergency protocols, another 50%. 
---
PA is very good for defending yourself. It is also really cheap and easy to get there. If you want similar stats and DR you need to grind a long time to find perfect pieces and maintain them. 
---
The system is balanced as it is right now. The only issue I can see is the introduction of the 3 legendary perks for light, sturdy, and heavy armor sets.
---
Don‚Äôt kill things on radiation rumble? Why?
---
Hmm... seems that mods think otherwise.
---
I got tired of people running up and punching me in the ass while im in my base, I gave them a smaller camp within my camp to entertain themselves.
---
\#WeWereThere
---
I'll keep checking, was starting to think it was a big at this point.
---
I saw several comments on this recently that made a ton of sense, but I've never actually tested myself as I can't afford to miss a week. They all said you must buy from Smiley sometime after he resets his supply around 8pm EST Saturday night, but before the Fallout 76 weekly atom challenges reset (Noon on Tuesday?). The weekly challenge reset supposedly breaks the other weekly reset for Smiley.
---
I buy every Saturday evening or Sunday if I forget for one day and haven't had a problem yet. Good luck.
---
the pre scortched food chain responders kill scortched raiders kill responders scortched kill raiders, 76 opens and the residents listen to people crying over holotapes.
---
Ya but they gave me a DLC they didnt make me pay for and I only really need 1 month of fo1st to get my junk in a place I feel very comfortable with. It's a online game with no charge to future updates. Nobody works for free how else can they support a living game?
---
That‚Äôs fine, I just wanted to know what to look out for. Yea the porch looks great. Seems like I started playing after it went from the shop but hopefully it‚Äôll be back soon.
---
The ‚Äúguard‚Äù scavs will take damage, stupidly enough. The essential technician scavs will not, and be healed.
---
Huh!  Neat idea.  Can you place the neon letters such that they overlap each other?  Seems like you could make giant faux [nixie tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube) that way.  Of course, that would be budget intensive and hard to control.  But if you could overlap the X and O, it seems like that'd work if the click areas for activation are restricted to the lamp tubes themselves (as opposed to a broad volume encompassing the letter).
---
Wish I could try it out, but I'm too poor from the bullion grind to dump 10K caps on the neon letters plans.  If someone works it out, definitely post pictures!
---
Sure, but "retired topic" is a ridiculous idea. The game changed, there is new information to talk about that affects said topic, and we're not aloud to bring it up?
---
I'm not into PvP either, but ever since wastelanders I've noticed an up tick in trolls and trap camps. So I got a few things to at least hold my own if people start griefing me. I never initiate, it but I will fight back.
---
Idk about "zero skill," but I will say there is little to no counter play to it. It definitely warrants removal on that basis alone.
---
1) fast travel to your camp  
---
2) stuff the bullions in your stash  
---
3) switch servers  
---
4) get 100 bullion out of the stash  
---
5) travel to vault79 and redo the final part of the quest  
---
6) collect 900 bullion, and now that you have 1000/900 the quest will complete
---
The bug's totally ridiculous, and would take like 10secs to fix :angry
---
Was this when the vault first launched on a public server?  If so then I believe you having these issues.
---
Update: 20 min on one server, vats reappeared. So...Yay? Real pain in the ass for certain events and builds.
---
I realized that I have both the radiation barrel and the hazmat suit and I have no idea how I got it since I NEVER completed radiation rumble before
---
I don‚Äôt see how this is shady.
---
But it does suck that you don‚Äôt get compensation for items that you already own.
---
The best thing to do, is just not buy bundles that you already have items of. The maybe they have incentive to change it.
---
This. Don't get attached.
---
That is fair. I was also thinking why not another SPECIAL attribute point every 50 lvls? Im only saying these more simple ideas because I know Bethesda will not want to put too much time into it; they thought they were done
---
&gt; I've repeated Forbidden Knowledge to gain the BoS paint jobs and experienced the normal bugs where the technical data doesn't stack
---
That's not a bug. That's by design. 
---
Those "results" you're sharing is very old news. I mean it's always good to highlight it for anyone that's missed it but like I said, not a bug. All intentional.
---
99% of the time, yes. But last night some dude came to my camp and kept attacking me while I threw hearts. He shot me with an explosive shotgun at close range and blew himself up. 
---
Nice little giggle for me!
---
Green screen would have been way old for a 486. Super VGA monitors were standard/commonplace by then.
---
Todds busy with ps5 release of skyrim. Check back in a year.
---
That is incorrect. Speed demon stacks on faster reload roll. The FMSWA is the perk that does not stack and is considered worthless.
---
##ITS GRAFTON DAY IN GRAFTON
---
Well it requires no aim at all other than being able to toss a grenade in the general vicinity of someone.  It takes very little skill at best.  
---
Yes there is no counter-play either.
---
There are mods available at Foundation, from one of the sunny vendor bots. They're pretty expensive though, around 1,000 caps. They have mods for bows and crossbows.
---
Apologies I didn't get this last night, I'm in the UK haha so there will be a bit of a time difference
---
Perfectly fine. I got caught up playing Alan Wake lol.
---
Best way to be I always help out as much as I can makes the game more appealing
---
" Holy F, a Flame Atronach ? Todd really want to put Skyrim everywhere ! "
---
They reverted the change to flame damage that buffed it. Still a great weapon though
---
as a retired paratrooper.... sometimes I felt half buried when I landed sooooo....   LOL
---
This is it exactly! It worked with Faschnacht, so why not all events? The way they doled out rewards for participating made it not nearly as bad missing getting a hit on the sloth that was slaughtered upon spawning every stinking time, so why not have all events work like that? It is especially needed if the corpse of the legendary enemy you just unloaded all your ammo into decides to glitch off map or into the ground.
---
I wonder WHY they got rid of the post...
---
We really shouldn't be lowering the bar for Bethesda. They already do a good job of that as is. We should be pushing them to do better, much like we have with the legendary perks and why Bethesda are looking to possibly rework them.
---
Ah gotcha thanks
---
I carry a cryolator for queen and imposter. Finding reduced weight weapons let's you carry a lot.
---
I've had it break on Monday after not buying Saturday. Seems like you have a very narrow window before he bugs out.
---
Prefer toxic Larry's and crickets;)
---
Ohhh nice one
---
Please don't nerf the gauss shotgun, if they nerf it in NW they will nerf it in adventure also( handmade drum magazine)
---
Yea dude every once in awhile you'll get that guy that tries to kill you over and over again even when you try to ignore them or server hop then blame he fallows you and continues griefing but those are far a few between if your under lev 20 expect lots of freebies and friendly high lev players.
---
Also do to lack of real end game content me and lot of my higher lev friends have made an end game being a body guard to lower players still doing main quests
---
They take up stash and display of you display them.
---
It can be kind of frustrating but for me, I just tell myself I didn't need another piece of scrip or whatever.  I like going out and playing the objectives too sometimes.  makes it more fun. I'm just a glutton for treasury notes even though I already have so many I cant use so as long as I get those I'm a happy camper.
---
But yeah it would be nice to have legendary enemy loot rework for events.  Honestly if I go to like uranium fever and there's already 5-6 people there I'll just wander around and pick the junk off the ground and shelves and wait for my notes.
---
Gunsmith slows degradation of the weapon you have equipped, and it does work on bows. You're not an idiot OP. I would, however, recommend using Weapon Artisan instead - as you don't need to keep it slotted 24/7 to benefit from it.
---
It's quite nice. I bought just the walls because the bundle included other things I wasn't as interested in, but I didn't realize the porch was exclusive to the bundle. Slightly disappointed but the walls are still really nice anyway.
---
I wasn't using the crystalizing barrel and it worked fine.
---
they did? when? at least it's still silent I guess.
---
If not " not every PA " then its a very specific case. Only excavator? Then you can be specific and use unyielding combined with the back pack for instance. Or you have to say PA in general vs non-PA.
---
If you just take the PA vs non PA situation like you said. On my BoS RP character when I'm overencumbered, I just get out of my PA to get the benefit of my back pack so I can get somewhere to sell/scrap/stash. Don't like the idee that I can carry quite a bit more out of my robo suite.
---
" You need 4 pieces to be equivalent. 5 to top it just by 5lb. " unfortunately underarmour and PA doesn't stack, not even BoS under armour that was designed for PA. That would have been great though.
---
As someone who had to work hard grinding these plans through kills of the queen or trades I have to say I am against this.  Nothing is rare or special anymore if everything is just available because you did daily quests for X amount of days.
---
need a Stealth Suit Jetpack btw
---
Crystallizing barrel seems to work better in my experience. The standard can freeze but it seems like it‚Äôs slower to do so and takes more ammo.
---
\*You hear something behind you in the darkness\*
---
\*You can't make out the sound\*
---
\*You're too late, a deathclaw just killed you\*
---
\*Your junk goes under the map\*
---
\*You rage-quit\*
---
Some really cool stuff in there imo.
---
Care to elaborate how? I try to do that, if you deposit the ores they actually respawn but stronger enemies will spawn too, when that happens it‚Äôs really hard to keep all of them alive. Of course your goal will be just 75 ores by the end of the event for best reward, but fighting floaters and keeping scavers alive and collecting ores is too hard for me...
---
That seems fair enough! Unfortunately my strategy is panic lol
---
I've had this problem with my camp down by the queen I haven't been able to place my camp for a day or two mainly due to people nuking farther north of dropsite v9
---
Not sure when exactly. But it was pretty quickly. I still love them though, probably my favourite heavy
---
Thanks done
---
I tried it once...
---
I miss my legs...
---
Was this the guy on PS4 who had buildings both sides of the road? I had similar the other week, like, just disconnect them!
---
Events were never source of good gear ( damn I curse that fasnacht :D ), for farming is better to run locations. And, Uranium fever is great event, but not that good for loot ( no max lvl weapons / armor ).  
---
But I know what are you trying to bring up.  
---
We need event loot distribution system based on contribution to the event.   
---
It is easy to say .. but .. the hell comes with implementing ...  
---
How could you measure players activity during event ? What if he participated but there were too many participants ? If they fail on the event contribution system, most events become AFK fests.   
---
TL:DR :  
---
We need more end-game content with more balanced rewards :)
---
I might be guilty of this. Could you tell me if this is a good weapon?
---
Revolutionary sword lvl 50
---
+1 Strength
---
Faster swing speed
---
Furious (consecutive hits deal more damage)
---
Electrified blade
---
By all measures it sounds godly, but even with Master Gladiator 9 chopping down lvl 60+ gouls takes forever.
---
Am I doing something wrong?
---
There are a bunch of random glitches if you have multiple weapons with the same prefix. I.E when you have multiple two shots. I have 18 weapons on my heavy and can‚Äôt quick change weapons with out playing the lottery of which one I get, I have to use the favorites wheel. I also have to refavorite all my weapons every time I log in
---
Patch 19 I think.
---
Idk about 90%. If you join queen fights a lot some use it for better dmg resist
---
I didn't know I needed this until I read it. Thank you.
---
Damn. I was hoping those players had solved it and it was avoidable. There is enough possible problems that people seemed to indicate early on could cause it such as visiting the way ward in between and not buying when first available, entering wayward in groups, private/public servers, not buying the max 300 at once,...  Way too many suggestions that I always try to buy the very first time I log in Saturday night. I wonder if there is some other stupid one like playing NW at reset time breaks it like it does by auto completing daily atom challenges. I guess there is no answer yet.
---
They have a rare chance of spawning on the raider robot vendors too. I've seen them at whitespring before.
---
Heavy weapons need power armor to max out.
---
No, I'm on XB.
---
One X, wired connection, just recently switched to an SSD. I didn't have many issues with lag outside of long SBQ fights but even less now.
---
Compared to Destiny, 76's movement/aim is worse, but it's never been bad enough for me to take note of it.
---
PA gives you good damage and energy resistance plus decent radiation resistance, but not much more than that
---
Haha love the perspective
---
I did see a couple posts, but not a lot of photos posted showing the item in different settings. This one has it on the stairs, I was just wondering if others had photos they could share.
---
I always tell other players to help themselves to water or crops
---
You just slayed me with "Bless his cotton socks!" I'm officially dead.
---
PA is worse then regular armor
---
I make my camp tastefully complex and cool looking because I think it's cool looking when it is tastefully complex. I make the workbenches and stuff public use but the rest is for my amusement. Also, every time I leave anything unlocked someone comes and mini nukes my bathroom or something similarly annoying to fix.
---
Oh, looking at how some people have their Camps set up, I'm pretty sure their brains can work out complexities. Maybe it's just that their fun in the game and their end game lies in another direction.
---
A workaround existing doesn't mean it's not bugged. 
---
It just means they won't prioritize the problem with the quest trigger.
---
about 100 levels below you and I've only seen it once unfortunately
---
NW isnt off the table for me. I play it a lot now.
---
PA builds are really easy to play with
---
Isn't that like... everything you could ever want?
---
Power armor is only decent with heavy guns. And it can be used as a base until you get a good set of legendary armor. But in everything else, up keep, carry weight, sneak, ap regen, perks that work with it, extra effects. Normal armor is better at. And now with the Chinese stealth suit you don't even need pa for nuke zones
---
Wow mean
---
The explosive aspect now adays is way overblown. Explosive is useful in a lot of disruption but if you want pure damage it is not as useful. 
---
The reason you explosive attributes on specific weapons always being asked for is usually they are talking about legacy explosive effects which were never nerfed. 
---
For example, currently explosive adds 20% damage to your base damage of your weapon. My commando handmade does 600 damage a shot and about 60-80 extra damage from the explosive. For something like a B E energy weapon like Gatling plasma it is in its unnerfed state of adding 100% damage to the weapon.
---
Why not?  Let me in!!!!
---
They should have a trading post somewhere in the game that works as a master auction house. People would all meet up there to check for interesting items. Maybe have some sleezy npc running it n taking a larger cut of the profit
---
Honestly, I only use PA for events like Scorched Earth for the Damage and Rad resistance. 
---
Otherwise I just stick to my usual outfit.
---
That said, I only don't use Power Armour for aesthetic reasons, not for META. I prefer looking like a character, not a tank with legs.
---
A decent horde mode would be great maybe like when we fought in the area. But obviously longer and more waves the higher you go the better the rewards. Like a guaranteed drop of a plan you don't know etc
---
Not when I can get a jet pack that doesn't drain cores like crazy plus I can stay in stealth easier then pa
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
still need alot of work and make them synergie with more perks (first faster reload) to make it great but this gameplay is really satisfying and interesting
---
not viable for the endgame tho, and thats the big problem
---
I was under the impression that spawning 3 fully ranked animals, and keeping them alive until the end, would result in better rewards... possibly some that cannot be acquired otherwise.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they upped the drop rate several of my friends cot emergency protocols and calibrated shocks last week. I had already traded for them
---
I used to jump through my windows all the time it‚Äôs a bug they never fixed.
---
Also, if you have an explosive shotgun, equip 3 levels of enforcer and just shoot the ground around the ghouls until they are all crawling. It's faster than shooting their legs and easy enough to do solo as well. When using this method, make sure to not repair the turrets. Also, the NPCs will occasionally kill a ghoul so you need to cripple the new ones that spawn.
---
Same, I'm still a bit salty that you can get the vault gear at all after I ground my way threw it lol. When everyone's special no one will be.
---
yep
---
There's a girl on YouTube that shows you how to use conduit and welcome mats to glitch stuff onto lower shelves. You can use wee Atom Shop items and such for basic upper shelf stuff though. It's not perfect, but it fills in the bareness a wee bit. She even managed to get stuff into the (formerly) uselessly empty glass front white trophy case display thingy.
---
I've been using Legendary gear that fits the characters and then scrapping the rest of script and it adds up to 1 or two chances at getting one. I've had very little luck despite the free 50 after doing the start of Wastelanders.  
---
I did get 2 weapons 1 for 2 char's each which are useful but came from that Mystery box for 60 script deal recently.  
---
The only friend I have to plays the Fallout series doesn't have a PC good enough to run 76 and HATES the idea of a Fallout MMO. He plays on PS4 but it's his brother's and schedules and all. We both prefer solo games.
---
plus if you open perk card pack with bandolier inside it will get discarded (deleted)
---
Just keep spamming the "interact" button to advance the conversation, until it takes. It's worked for me through multiple characters.
---
These are things Bethesda is already aware of and have been discussed as nauseam. How many times do we need to talk about power displays? At a certain point it just clogs up the feed.
---
I wish you could lock the windows like basic wood shutters
---
Scavenger here. I use excavator for the carry weight and no fall damage. Lately I‚Äôve been carrying over 1200 lbs. I can‚Äôt fast travel but I don‚Äôt need to travel that often to my camp.
---
is it a new mod you have to craft or just a skin for the existing jetpack? can I use it on my jetpack arm ultracite armor basically
---
There's a covered porch from the contemporary bundle
---
The perk system in this game is hilariously bad
---
I mean, I resorted to learning how to solo standard Dead in the Water on my private server because all my friends hated V94.  I grew to somewhat enjoy DitW and Washout, but I think they could have done a lot better.
---
Maybe try changing the atom skin maybe it's recognizing both as one due to that I'm not sure
---
huh. Never thought of doing stealth with heavies
---
It's only the one brick window, if you use another one you can't juno threw them
---
It happened to me long ago because I kept die of lasers from robots, didn't knew if it was permanent so I left the server
---
I would join a new server then spam for like, 2 minutes then join a new server and rinse and repeat.
---
Wow thank you for that detailed reply.  I have not read, (or even heard), someone use ‚Äúwax lyrical‚Äù in quite some time so I appreciated the throwback.  And I can appreciate what you are saying completely.  
---
It was probably a poor comparison for me to have you use this subscription as a basis for my question, but still I appreciate the time you took to write the answer.  
---
It‚Äôs sort of off subject, but I just bought Fallout 1st to support the game.  When you look at what mobile games make, they can make more in one month than these sorts of games can make in the span of a lifetime and it doesn‚Äôt take long to see that rpgs and long-term experiences like this will be a thing of the past over time as they simply make no money by comparison.  But none of that has anything to do with my question or your reply...I guess I was just saying it as I saw a video on YouTube that echoed that sentiment yesterday,
---
Power armour is THE way to play a heavy guns build, so that's why you see loads, it's fun and it's easy to play. 
---
I prefer my legendary stuff as well usually, but it's nice to switch things up sometimes.
---
It does not say it's compatible with Ultracite, so I'm going to bet it won't work for you.
---
Ultracite Armor was designed post-war. Regs wouldn't have access to the plans.
---
Me too dude.  Me too.  Making all of the vault rewards available for bullion was literally a giant kick in the nuts to all of us who spent time and effort grinding 94.   Ive never been more upset with 76 or with Bethesda than i was over that
---
Flamers and harpoons count as silenced ;)
---
Yes. Because you definitely took the time to read that article.....
---
It's talking about stores in Austria and Switzerland. Hugggggeeee game consumer Juggernaut countries. 
---
Love headline readers.
---
You have to do a certain amount of damage I think
---
Hopefully tames get incorporated and overhauled in whatever pet update they have planned. I wouldnt mind this feature in the interim though. I've learned not to get attached to pets, they die too easy :(
---
You need to do more damage.
---
SBQ seems to be the exception.  I do not know the exact damage number but I believe you have to hit her for ~1,000 damage to get credit.
---
A thousand thumbs up. I had to abandon this perk card all together
---
At least the jump suit, emote, and normal icon are legacy I guess. I really feel like at least the mask should have been made legacy as well
---
taht would be cool, also whats the deal with brenda?
---
Even with my low level characters, I only pull it out for specific tasks, mining for lead, for instance... or prior to wastelanders and the stealth suit, going into nuke zones 
---
The people that wear it all the time, I liken to dudes that drive around in giant lifted trucks that are never off road or used for work... compensation
---
Anymore, it‚Äôs a zombie walk for me. I collect one, turn it in, loot the camp for ammo and ammo making materials, sell my dupes at train stations, and start the cycle all over. Of all the capricious slot machines this game makes me do, this one bothers me the least because at least I can make the trek over there count for something. If I get a cool reward like a bomber jacket or BoS plan or something, it‚Äôs purely a bonus. I am so beat down by the RNG, I stopped caring what rare tech data rewards are possible. I‚Äôve actually had better success finding plans and magazines lying around the fort than with the tech data rewards.
---
this most recent I only got a few hits on her, but the previous time with my bloodied gatling plasma, I was definitely moving her health bar down a lot.
---
There's a guy in a sack hood on PS4 , always trying to kill everyone he sees , he must have a bottomless supply of bullets.
---
On the SBQ there is a damage threshold you have to hit to be able to get loot. 1000, 1500? I can't remember exactly tbh.
---
I suggest you turn on damage numbers under the display settings section so you can see how you're fairing, she has huge DR.
---
Clearly fictitious. Deathclaws are neither scary nor deadly.
---
Same here, but I dont demand that people interact with me.  I say HI and if you dont respond I'm out.
---
Lmfao get this.  So i only did the raids on my main because i was grinding for a perfectly rolled solar set and on the last day of the vault i took all four of my alts through on expert because I wanted the mask and i was like "there's no way the mask isnt legacy!"  Boy was i wrong lol
---
I did actually get some decent gear from completing fasnaght...
---
3* anti armour bow with 10 damage while aiming and 50 damage resistance while aiming
---
3* bolstering +1 endurance sentinels secret service leg piece
---
3* anti armour faster fire rate 250 damage resist while reloading tesla
---
and many more... aside from the 4 power armour helmets I cant do anything with
---
maybe to kinda to make it so you get inclusion rewards they could track how much the player has  moved and how much damage dealt over all?
---
it‚Äôs a bit buggy like that... i read ( a bit back ) they fixed issues like this to where everyone in the event should get something from a dropped legendary.  But times like what you‚Äôve experienced clearly proves they didn‚Äôt fix the issue.
---
Single windows have been like that since launch, it's why most people use the double windows.  Alternately you can use the new drapes to prevent people from climbing through the single window.  Just make sure you dont have anything people can reach THROUGH the window they can interact with like a work bench or a piece of furniture or they will just glitch through the wall entirely.
---
It's like you don't understand what dealing with the average case means.
---
Like I've already mentioned, you can pick out specific situations and the dynamics shift a little. Let's talk unyielding aside since, like I mentioned, it massively skews everything and I content THAT is the problem more than PA not having enough carry weight.
---
You go normal armour with full carry weight mods vs PA full options and you end up with the case I mentioned. You could also pick something like X-01 and it gets outclassed in carry weight but then it's better in other areas like rad resist and armour (in most cases). Skew the argument the other way and go full ultra-light mods and armoured backpack mod and suddenly wah PA has too much carry weight advantage.
---
Then what about Chinese Stealth Suit users. Shouldn't they equally be demanding that they have equivalent or better carry weight options than normal armour or PA users?
---
Do you start to see how the argument starts to skew to the ludicrous? 
---
I want my Chinese stealth suit, and all my armour mods, and all my legendary effects and my backpack and its mods. Take away the CSS and it's still the same - I want all my normal armour benefits AND also use power armour. It becomes very much a have your cake and eat it scenario and it shouldn't ever be that way.
---
Once again, since you keep missing it, by the averages. By the averages, both normal and PA are mostly the same. You're not forced to do one of the other because the benefits are mostly in a similar ballpark. Not the same, just similar.
---
Except for unyielding. That's my point. It's not the PA that's the issue, it's unyielding.
---
Might have been at max caps and didn‚Äôt know you should disconnect or store your vendors
---
Now use the cannibal perk
---
I love the Brotherhood Recon rifle for this. Fully molded God  gear at that level
---
Ghouls and Scorched are dropping claim tickets that you turn in up at the bot in the basement of that store at top of the world.  It‚Äôs got a few rare things with a shotgun and revolver I guess, but I was happy to get the western and chaos outfits.  Kind of sad it is no longer rare, but I wanted them.
---
Pretty sure you need to do a certain amount of damage. This is probably to encourage people to actually attack her instead of standing there leeching, since she supposidly scales up with the amount of people attending the event. 
---
Not sure if the last bit is true, just something I've seen floating around on here in the past.
---
Well it is kind of legacy, it lost its vines. The crafted one still have them lol. Same with the solar and thorn. And newly crafted pa has vines show threw paint jobs
---
Had it happen on private you just leave the area + server then rejoin but not sure how to fix this on public. Maybe you could try rejoining server if you had a friend in it.
---
Can you tell me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username?
---
Ward has been maddening to deal with lately. Even when you are super careful to not spam the button to skip dialogue, he still will just say his first line and then stop and either walk away or go into the "I've got my eye on you," crap. Look, guy, I'm just trying to turn this in and get that last little bit to FINALLY be allied, but you make me want to shotgun blast you to the face right now, tbh.
---
Umm... it's not a bug because Bethesda explicitly stated that this was the intended effect that they wanted when they changed it to be how it currently is.
---
My issue was I jumped out my window while building camp. Never noticed the issue before.
---
No just the sparkly one that is common, you can grab it at white springs.  Looks sexy, but yet to find anyone it looks good on.  That red outfit is ultra rare and not in that loot pool of tickets I don‚Äôt believe
---
he was over level 100
---
Yeah i think it looks ugly without the vines tho like a regular scout mask.  I liked the vines on the armor.  I made ticket about that months ago and nothin ever got done
---
That would work
---
Yeah but would be nice to clean her up
---
Because we still like Power Armor even though Bethesda doesn't give two shits about it.
---
You can still shop on a vending machine without power. Only guaranteed way to prevent shoppers is to scrap/store your vending machines.
---
She doesn't scale. It just appears that way because more players increase the lag.
---
It's a decent exp farm, no doubt. But they hyped it up a lot when it was added, and it ended up just being a bunch of ghouls in some tunnels. I think a "clear all ghouls" daily would even be fun, with a slight potential for some unique reward at the end. This would give people a good reason to repeat it as well, because that reward could be sold or traded. Farming exp doesn't mean too much to some people once they're over 50 and don't intend on changing their build. Though when legendary perks come out there'll actually be a point to keep gaining levels for perk cards to cash in.
---
Seriously! I've bought more pointless CAMP crap in the Atom Shop for apparently no reason, since I can't use half of it due to budget constraints. Lovely.
---
I use a vampiric flamer as a side weapon. It is excelent in Ecrypted and when a million of ghouls lungs towards me (the crazy bastards... I hate them).  Or on enclosed places where I can not fly away with my jetpack.
---
Honestly, I just put locks on for the roleplay reason. I live in a deadly wasteland, why wouldn't I lock my doors?
---
But, I'm always happy for players to explore my camp. Hell, if I see one in there, I usually open the door for them (despite the fact my house is small, and doesn't have much).
---
Okay, check this out. You need 100 pieces of ore to complete event. As you deposit ore, the levels go up... 
---
at level 0, ghouls spawn. 
---
At level 1, ghouls and snallygasters spawn. 
---
At level 2, ghouls snallygasters and floaters spawn. 
---
At level 3 ghouls snallygasters floaters and death claws spawn. 
---
Waiting for a team to collect the ore and deposit it all at once makes the event more manageable.
---
If you only want a bit and want to have an easy time go to the Whitespring resort and take the magnifying glasses that are all over the place. It's not a crazy amount but it's good for a quick easy loot, plus loads of steel from coat hangers
---
That‚Äôs is unfortunate and just funny. Gotta embrace these ‚Äúgifts‚Äù
---
" But..but Morrowind just told you a description and left you to fend for yourselves to figure out how to go there. These darn kids these days and wanting a quest marker or glowing trail to hand hold them. Mrghmammph !" /s
---
Then let there be a single topic for each "retired" topic that isn't archived/locked. It won't congest the feed, and will allow us to add to the discussion as new things comes up.
---
Being able to customize our Allies is the only reason why I purchased the RR robot helmet. I would also be purchasing power armor skins that I though were cool if I could display them. Now that we can display our regular armor on allies, why not our power armor on chassis? They've shown us that the capability exists, but they applied it to something that almost no one was asking for, rather than something many people have been asking for.
---
I‚Äôd like to think people understand when I do a thumbs down and heart emote right away as a, ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù lol
---
The main time I see people in PA at events is fighting the SBQ when someone drops the nuke where we can't fight her outside the radiation.
---
Other than that I would say its about 50/50 on people in and out of PA.  Some people like they way the armor looks.  Personally I have never been a PA fan so I don't use it.
---
Yes, you're not doing enough damage. You have to do at least 1,000 damage or you won't get the loot off her. Just being there with the quest active will get you the 2* combat armor drop and the treasury notes, but not the flux or the loot off her.
---
Redditors are all OP non-PA killers.
---
Non-redditors are all squishy food build PA noobs.
---
Everyone who talks in absolutes are clueless dongles.
---
Fairly mediocre tbh. Furious on anything requires really really fast swings to be if any value - think combat knife for melee and even that's kinda slow. It's really only particularly good on automatic rifles.
---
Swing speed only affects power attacks from what I've been told, so that doesn't help a lot with the furious. +1S is nice, though. Honestly if you're going melee you want junkies/instigating/AA for full health builds and bloodied if you want to max dps. A 1* of any of those is better than your sword since it will take 3 hits to start doing the same dmg as AA and 5 hits to equal junkies with max 5 addictions. It will never be nearly as good as instigating on a full HP enemy since it caps at +50% damage.
---
Yes yes yes
---
Always been the case and tbh it's great. I just stopped using my doors.
---
The ghouls come in hordes, both ways charging in. Not a lot of weapon choices  are quick enough to take them down swiftly, not if you‚Äôre alone and have to care for both sides. (Only fast firerate explosive gun or shotgun that hits like a truck, normally junkie/bloodied/two shot)
---
Hence the shotgun method, and no damage perk needed for the shotgun only enforcer, so you would keep your main weapon damage perk in case you need to quickly kill the ghouls that got too close to the scavengers. 
---
Melee is not my expertise, however I can say it‚Äôs not the weapon you want to run when there are not a lot of people in this event. (Less people require you to be able to either cripple all ghouls, or kill the waves fast enough) 
---
Shishkebab(any kind) however when pair with the perk friendly fire is able to heal the scavengers when you hit them. So you can help defend and heal at the same time.
---
Same. The think the pa looks cool with the vines coming threw. To bad i won't waste steel on making a new set. And definitely not now that they made it to where you can't place a jetpack on the arm
---
Bethesda.
---
You sold that for only 10k?? If it was only a 2 star you were looking minimum of 20k and any 3rd perk you shouldn‚Äôt even sell it for caps. Really a trade only item. 
---
The person who picked that up was having a GREAT DAY!
---
Holy crap! Same! I tried to put my wanderer in the tattered dress because I NEED the Order of Mysteries to survive somehow, and it was awful. I live right by the water. I wish I could throw her in at least to wash off some of the surface bit if nothing else.
---
Had that happen last night. VATS just refused to engage for like 15 minutes. Then it would for a few minutes. Then it wouldn't again. No idea how or why.
---
One point in tender and all in on bloodied is a pretty solid choice
---
I have had this happen before, after doing a fair share of damage.  ‚òπÔ∏è
---
The decontamination shower doesn't turn off by itself? Oh.........
---
If you do not want to smelt ore, you can go around the interior of Whitesprings to pickup the telephones on the desks.
---
oh man, i had this happen to me when a farmhand killed me at vault tec. really cool to have an infinite flame engulfing my character with parts of her skeleton poking out lol; had to grab a video of it as a keepsake before hopping servers (bc it eventually got old)
---
Around 1500 damage to loot her, it‚Äôs to discourage people only tagging and not helping.
---
I have a one star furious flamer, and I took down a level 91 glowing deathclaw very fast last night. Not running bloodied or junkies, either ... just a regular guy melting a lizard. It deals heaping damage to a SB on the ground, too. I used it in a SBQ fight, and it really helped with the mobs. Love it. If it weren‚Äôt for the high material cost to make ammo and how quickly it burns through fuel, I could and would totally use this as a main.
---
i tried vats grenading a supermutant with a minigun and it exploded right in my face.  i guess they figure the counterplay is to shoot an unnatural amount of bullets at the target lol
---
Bethesda just needs to make loot drop for people doing objectives too and it will probably get way better since I think most people refuse to do objectives because they're tunnel vision on tagging legendary enemies
---
There is a Scrapper perk in FO76 but it doesn't give you any of the more rare scrap like screws. Instead, it increases the amount of steel/wood/rubber/etc. that you get.
---
It's great for stocking up on steel (combat rifles, assault rifles) and plastic (laser rifles) though.
---
Yeah after participating in the lighthouse event, I finally made my way down to the mothman museum. I thought it was such a big deal seeing as how there's the museum, comics and references throughout the world. I was just disappointed to get there only to kill a bunch of cultists and have no quest or anyting fun or interesting.
---
This is why I love my Quad FFR Tesla (unsure of the third effect atm). If others keep one shotting everything in the event I start spamming.
---
Well shit, I changed my whole build for this weapon... I guess I‚Äôll have to find an instigating weapon. Thanks
---
Maybe they have.  Been playing just shy of 2000 hours since BETA.  I have only joined killing the queen once in the last 2 weeks.  Most of my time in game now is grabbing treasury notes across 4 of my characters.  I recently stated using Ultracite PA on my BOS roleplay.  It sucks losing carry weight when jumping in that PA.
---
The new crafted strangler power armor can't have the vines hidden anymore? I have an old set painted blue camo so people didn't know you were the one lagging the SBQ lol and the vines are totally gone with the paint. So a new version would still have vines displaying over the paint job? Are there any paints that actually look cool with that effect?
---
Only problem is your going to need Flux, which is an end game crafting material. Which PA you using? You on PC?
---
Unless you're standing on the fence or tents during scorched earth, then you should be yelled at
---
No, there is not bonus damage for attacking a crippled limb. Limb damage doesn't affect enemy health either.
---
I've seen bulk screws in several vendor bots. They are ridiculously over-priced like everything else vendor-bots sell. I think the last time I saw them for sale was at a train station (Welch?). But before that I'm pretty sure I saw them for sale in one of the shops at the Whitespring Resort.
---
Bethesda is too stupid to fix this bug apparently.
---
\^This
---
Ah I miss a detail, you can either slowly deposit it and it will spawn stronger enemies, or deposit all 100 at once and end the event.
---
Not everyone‚Äôs toxic bro, you‚Äôve obviously never have done pvp in this game because after most of the fights everyone‚Äôs chill
---
man that sucks, but I can't say I'm surprised. ultracite is always the middle child when it comes to cosmetics
---
Oh, got a link?
---
It has some of the bigger ones show threw the paint. It dose not complete cover the paint job. I think it looks bad ass with any paint job lol. And yeah that's why I ground nw so people didn't know I was using it
---
I use it when going into events /areas with many high level enemies because the power armor can take a beating and last longer without repairs for me.      Normally I use regular armor and kill things from as far as possible using my rifles and sneaking.
---
I made a bar near Pickaxe. Light up arrows pointing to the right when you enter, to a sign above a door which says "shop" in neon lights. Half of players go into my bar, don't immediately see vending machines, and walk back out. Half of those then walk all the way around the building before leaving.
---
The kind of person who is going to take the time to explore your shit, isn't likely to then jack it.
---
A few vendor bots have ONLY bulk junk items. But I can't recall which ones they are. I think one of them is in Whitespring Resort. IIRC it was the one with all the crafting stations on the shop floor.
---
Yeah I was saving up my Atoms to buy the red rocket bundle but now the mothman stuff is coming out and I'm very torn because half of it's on sale!
---
Encrypted is a very straight forward event, game tells you to activate pylons and it tells you how many. 
---
PP is also straight forward but you learn tricks to make it easier as you play more.
---
PA actually has a unlisted benefit of 40% damage reduction for just wearing the PA. Paring it with emergency protocols you can get upwards of 90% damage reduction on top of you damage resistances of your PA.
---
Not only that, but everytime I visit ward he is stuck in to bloody stairs and I cant talk to him. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I run a junkies build and got a junkies gamma gun. It does almost 300 damage and 125 radiation damage. Its got the automatic dish on it and empties 8 shots in about 1.5 seconds. Most people don't have a lot of rad resistance especially the low health builds. It shreds them and weighs 3 pounds of stash space.
---
Yesterday/last night the game was extra fucky. I had items disappear from my inventory and show up later, other items were showing the display and stats of another item.
---
And the recent proliferation of jet packs.
---
It's really rude of you to not validate OP's narrow-minded opinion.
---
Also don't build a work bench on the other side of a window. I have used this many times to access a stash box in some ones locked house
---
You can say ass, its reddit.
---
Oh man finally.
---
All y'all idiots that argued with me that gold grind was endgame can suck it. Dont know how so many fan boys always defend it.
---
Looks like your post pushed through the auto downvote warriors though. Good luck
---
I can't agree with the premise that the player base is too stupid to figure out endgame with objectives.  It may be true that a lot of players aren't familiar with MMO type games, but I think there is just a learning curve like with other online games.
---
I used to regularly solo paradise. Me and friend ended up with all the plans legit. Free Range is a easy solo. Encryptid, still haven't solo'd this but I have a vampires ffr flamer picked up, just haven't got around to doing it. It's pretty easy with a dps guy if you tank the pylons in troubleshooters/med-x or magazine. Radiation rumble, I've seen video of it solo'd, but you need ore runners. It can be cheesed putting pa frames down and crippling the mobs. Vault 94, there was a guy who completed dead in the water on expert solo. I'm sure there was others.
---
They changed a lot of the way the game played in adventure. You used to be able to blow up camps, the tse shotgun was so ridiculous back then. They had duping problems, so people who love trading left. I guess that's the only people who stuck around was the crazy guys.
---
That I was aware of. I used that a few times myself.
---
Ive been bouncing back and forth between the PTS and standard versions of the game. The legendary perk system is incentive enough to power through some levels on my main build. That way when update 21 comes in the distant future I will already have some extra perk cards to throw away
---
Anytime
---
I have everything minus the stashbox, scrapbox and one vendor outside, I left the door code right next to all of it. Can‚Äôt have a vault CAMP that doesn‚Äôt feel secure.
---
I rather be rewarded period, quests and events are way too unrewarding.
---
I've rejected it multiple times... that didnt work for me...
---
Yes. All of the nw skins except the 3 inferno paints work on the ultracite pa, including the sh
---
I'm the opposite of you, I love Power Armor and feel like a 40k space marine with the heavy guns but have branched out to try the non-PA builds for fun on alts.
---
I think as others have said it's very easy to get a suit of PA compared to a full suit of unyielding or vanguards or whatever marine/combat/SS armor with the right legendary stars.  And it's still very effective, honestly even lower end PA is pretty good.
---
I think PA needs some love, even just natural poison immunity would be awesome.  Hopefully the Brotherhood of Steel focus they're roadmapping will have something beyond just new skins &amp; models.
---
Yeah, how dare they build up Camps and stock their vending machines, and take heart emotes in Photomode.
---
Lmao exactly.
---
? Get a mule so you don‚Äôt have to carry every single thing on your character. 
---
I recently took the time to build a perfect weight reduction alt. Full set of unyielding weapon weight reduction armor and all weight reduction perks. 
---
I had 3 alts with 1300-1700 lbs each on them plus their stash. I combined them all into my new alt where it all weights only 600 lbs lol.
---
Damn that sounds kind of cool. But not sure I want to craft another set just for it. Especially since my current set has an irreplaceable jet pack helmet, although I really wish I had done the arms instead if I ever thought they were going to fix that glitch that had been around forever.
---
Suggestion: Build smaller. No really, not being a smartass. My camps have 4-5 buildings that are heavily decorated, no bigger than maybe a 3x3 footprint on each (usually 2x3 plus a 1x3 porch). A 2x2 room is much bigger than you might expect once you furnish it.
---
The gold bullion system was always going to be a disappointment from the moment we were told how it would work. Its just repeating dailies over and over to get plans that you still have to toil over endlessly to get the "right one".
---
Occasionally my SS jetpack glitches and goes invisible, this is pretty much what it looks like.
---
"like Satan himself" I'm crying ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ best.glitch.ever
---
I actually make a "Find the Vault Boys" game in all of my camps, because it gives me an excuse to rebuild regularly.
---
I see them constantly at the raider vendor in the forest.
---
You can just say that already. You really think that people that will ignore someone telling them something in their ear with their own voice are suddenly going to care when it's typed in tiny text letters instead? I know some of you would rather die than use your mic because of mental issues but text chat is simply not going to help.
---
I don't know how, but I went to WS station and in a suitcase found the rad barrel plan.
---
great, thank you. i use different perk :)
---
It‚Äôs already been discussed ad nauseam as I said. There is little value to be gained from the same conversation over and over again. Bethesda is aware this is a highly requested feature, hence why it‚Äôs on the retired topic list. I agree it would be nice to be able to go in there and find 1 thread you could add discussion to for each item if you wanted. 
---
FYI a lot of people have requested to display armor and clothes on mannequins. Doing it for allies is a better version of that request IMO, though it is only 1 set. Hopefully we get more displays in the future.
---
Same reason why I won't craft a new one haha. And yeah my jetpack is on an arm. Like having the targeting hud on my helm. And the arms are useless lol
---
Sometimes you can trick the angled roof into working as an awning, but I feel like it's a combination of luck and placement to make it work.
---
There's also the porch from the Contemporary set.
---
But agreed: it would be nice to have a clip-on awning that would go over doorways and exterior walls.
---
I‚Äôll gladly Sherpa anybody on PC that wants to learn events.  I‚Äôd enjoy it.  I‚Äôm just saying bitching on reddit every single day doesn‚Äôt do anything.  Just fuckin google it if it‚Äôs so mind-boggling difficult to comprehend tapping ‚ÄúE‚Äù on the three pylons that have diamond markers over them with the guidelines of the event in the top right of the screen.
---
I've done something similar myself. I'd drop low level weapons, ammo, stims, Rad-X, and Rad Away in bags outside the Wayward. Before that, I would leave them outside of the vault. Really, that's the thing I love about this game. As a community, the majority of us are helpful and welcome new players.  It done for me, so I'll do the same.
---
That sounds awesome and super fun!
---
Power armor is lacking apart from one area and that's rad resistance and that's why a majority of players wear it at the SBQ so they don't glow in the dark in a nukezone.
---
I believe this is the cause. Because I can always buy if I do it on Sunday But the two times I didnt buy on Sunday it bugged and couldn't buy until the following Sunday.
---
As someone else mentioned Grahm sells them and their ‚Äúmall vendor‚Äù bot inside white spring can have them in its inventory too. You might have luck server hopping him instead of trying to find grahm.
---
How can you stay chilled when half the participant's using aimbots and be swinging them hacked weapons around?
---
Make it a Fallout 1st perk
---
You can also just connect them to a powered door like I do so when I want them on I broadcast, doors open and when I don‚Äôt door is closed. 
---
Benefit of having base in the air, no one can run into the base while everything is losing.
---
Newer player (lvl 53 started last month), and FO76 lurker here - haven't posted yet. In the first couple weeks, a few generous players dropped off plans,  stimpacks and a few legendary items that l've hoarded, I mean hung onto, until I could finally start using them. But since I hit about lvl 30, those have stopped visiting and only have had multiple griefers much higher than I grace me with their presence. 
---
One lvl 240-ish? in particular started hitting me with a paddle ball back at Fasnacht and followed me back to my camp to continue paddling me and my bf for a full hour while I tried to remodel my basic beginner box-style building. We got tired of ignoring him and went into a private game. Last night, a 170-ish came into my camp while I finally tried to remodel said box, and was slashing and throwing grenades at my bf and I for about 30 mins while we ignored him. Some random dude strolled up to watch as he stepped in and out of his PA over and over and took some blows. Not sure if he was an accomplice, cuz he didn't throw down but he also just stood there voyeuristically. Forgot to check our health and the other one eventually killed us off a few seconds apart. Whatevs, he saved me from my FO4 hoarding ways. Bfd dude, hope you display all 7 Mr. Fuzzys I was collecting as a memento of our cherished time together, since my chemo brain keeps forgetting which ones I already have. 
---
I've read so many great stories here about the FO76 community kindness, and heck, I've handed over some care packages myself to pay it forward. Fingers crossed that I'll be able to finish switching up my camp one of these days. 
---
TLDR: newer player had only helpers stop by in the beginning, now mostly griefers
---
So glad they overcame that hurdle, I know it's killed a LOT of that sort of mod in the past. Really hope they get all the way to release before inevitable fo6 draws attention away
---
You broke the misinformation chain, we are cursed now
---
I do the sort of opposite to accomplish this. I rename anything I am willing to scrip to the name ‚ÄúJunk‚Äù and only scrip items named ‚ÄúJunk‚Äù since I have A LOT of Legendaries I don‚Äôt use but keep for alternate builds and trades. I only use about 10 renaming instances for my top UNY and top VNG set.
---
True, but I think this is more of a "Taking time and spending caps to arrive at a closed store" issue, when if they were unplugged his camp would not have shown up.
---
I live life believing that there is no such thing as a stupid question, only a stupid answer!
---
As nice as this would be, the harsh truth is that if you take out the RNG/grind there is very little left of the "end game" to keep players interested. Its sad, but this is also why all of our currencies are bottlenecked - to prolong play time.
---
I took all the gold and fucked the Raiders.
---
I am unable to finish the astronaut's quest. All she says is "my back hurts" when I try to turn in the flight recorder. I try it every day and it's been 2 weeks. Any ideas?
---
Yeah, turn off area mic, switch it to team. I got tired of the snuffaluffagus too, I see a speaker symbol with x, take their stuff while they raging.
---
Thanks! Time to get my bush wookie on. Do you know roughly how long it'll take to get to 60 from never played NW before?
---
The only way to get killed by players is for you to damage them, and if you have pacifist on it‚Äôs an enemy not a player.
---
Good to know. Thank you!
---
With pacifist on, he shouldnt have been able to harm you (few exceptions not listed aside). Did you fight back? 
---
That is def not the normal play style though, it just seems like you ran into a jerk. Block him, switch servers and get back at it. You will meet many more nice people than people like this.
---
50 50 is fair
---
Just as with any other multiplayer game, there are nice ones and there will be not so nice ones.
---
You're gonna want some power armor, to utilize "Stabilized" in Intel. Beyond that, it's pretty much all the damage perks in Strength, and whatever utility skills you want. Fyi Serendipity doesn't work in power armor, so you can either put those points into another special, or use One Gun Army.
---
In all my hours of playing I‚Äôve rarely been shot at, and when I am being shot at, combat and real damage doesn‚Äôt start unless you shoot back. Just keep switching servers
---
Very true
---
PA is like rolling up your windows and locking the doors when driving through rough neighborhoods. And nuked Fissure Prime can be a very rough neighborhood.
---
This is the reason I wish you could have more people on a team at once... Me and like 7 other friends go to rad rumble when it starts 4 of us (the team I'm not on) defend and place PA down at the entrances. Then the other 4 (the team I am on) go down and collect ore. This has worked so far for the past 17 rad rumbles, we have done. With all 8 of us -me included- in a party with everyone there it just goes so smoothly. Thats why I don't get it when people say that the event is hard for them... Just get 2 teams and a party and your go to go.
---
P.s all of us are lvl 200+ if that changes anything.
---
Herd Mentality stopped showing in my pipboy with wastelanders unless I am on a team. I can tell I still have it when not on a team because my carry capacity is an odd number, 337. It doesn't show negatives for my specials either.
---
I know I didn't buy it I must have found it? Idk
---
I wont mention the Foundation daily bug Im suffering from where I dont have to actually find the stolen property, its just always in my inventory so it instantly completes.
---
Also, Foundation really needs to have a look at their security measures if all this valuable equipment is getting stolen every day
---
Yeap yeap
---
Saw another post suggesting it's based on one week from your last gold purchase versus your first gold purchase. Eg. if I bought 3k worth of bullion two days apart, it would reset 7 days after my second purchase. 
---
Can anyone confirm?
---
Everything in my camp is unlocked, even my ammo producer. I feel conflicted when I see locked doors and purifiers.
---
xbox stated when the x series was announced. all titles will be backward compatible . if you own it now it will work on the series x.
---
Just put in an automatic door that is triggered by the laser trip and set up a timer to close it again. I'm a noob in fo76 but fo4 my stuff was all automatic.
---
üëçüëç
---
T-65 too, for what it's worth. It always strikes me as odd that Bethesda would try to hard to avoid selling me skins, but us what it is I guess.
---
No one can pvp you unless you hit them back so your story is missing some parts it seems.
---
So if I wanted to have a different spin on it and say, "Bethesda Plz give us an ally who is wearing power armor that I can customize", would that be a different enough take to be considered a new request or do you think it would just get rule 10ed?
---
Who shat in your breakfast cereal?
---
That's completely fine don't worry about it. üòÜüëå
---
Today at a camp I tried to turn off someones decon arch and nothing happened, is it maybe only camp owners can do it?
---
I've noticed this as well. Locked purifiers usually means lesser product and inflated prices in the vending machines.
---
Did this quest marker happen to be for taking a workshop? Workshops open you to pvp.
---
That wasn‚Äôt the original point though - it‚Äôs obviously very easy to just google it and find out. It‚Äôs the fact that some people are bitching on the sub that people don‚Äôt know what to do. In a game where you don‚Äôt have to Google every event, why would you suddenly google how to do this one? 
---
If you aren‚Äôt in the group of people bitching about people not knowing, then cool. I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre arguing lol.
---
The turrets?
---
Yup I sweeped the whole room twice and found nothing thanks tho:)
---
And some people here will argue to the death that it's a great system
---
I literally didn't see him.  Does activating a workshop allow people to attack you?  Is that where I went wrong?
---
I don't think they do I think the crippled ghouls just get dissponded... If that's a word
---
Solution: Don't build doors.  I have no doors and it is glorious.  
---
If you happen to come across an Odd Museum near Helvetia with no doors...that's me.
---
Quite awhile. I did all of my grinding during double and triple weekends. And it depends how good you are at hiding. You want to hit at least the top 10 to get decent xp
---
My favorite is a huge building with nothing in the middle and all the furniture and workbenches along the walls. No vendors in sight. Then you FINALLY find them after 5 minutes of searching and they are just sitting on the ground in the backyard............
---
people can still get the gold boi?  guess i need to swap back to the regular one then, though that does explain why i have seen people not involved in v94 groups with it.
---
so glad the emote turned legacy, i grinded like a madman for that to add to my collection.  im just waiting for someone new to reddit to upload an image asking what the emote is.
---
Raider bunk has been blowing me off for 3 or 4 weeks now... I dont know what I did to piss him off.. but he hasn't been giving me quests. At least hes polite about it though üòÖ
---
I can't explain it then.  I am trying to figure this out.   Does setting up a workshop allow PVP?
---
A ghoul hiding in a hallway or adjacent room? It‚Äôs the room with the reactor?
---
Question: do you keep all of those perks active? That seems like a waste of special slots if that‚Äôs the case since they are very situational. Other perk cards that are helpful but also situational and should not be kept active IMO are white knight, gunsmith, and weapon artisan. 
---
As for your specific perk loadout and special point allocation I would recommend you visit the nukes &amp; dragons website. It general it‚Äôs best to focus on a specific weapon class to maximize damage (commando, rifleman, two handed melee, etc). Sneak cards are also good as they can further up your damage. I also like using Adamantium skeleton to eliminate limb damage. 
---
There really is no right answer here. It depends on your play style.
---
true, but turned off and inside does not anger people, cause they didn't spend caps to travel and shop.
---
Hey @Bethesda if we could get some flaming armor from the Atomic Store that would be nice
---
Ah, thanks! I have quite a few claim tickets and figured I'm stumble on what to do with them eventually. You've been a big help :)
---
Yes, activating wprkshops opens you up to PVP, it pops up a warning to that effect.
---
You're welcome. Don't forget to put Emergency Protocols into your torso also.
---
Yeah but only thing doesn't tell you is amounts. 40 and 60 will get you a better animal. And the rad kelp is is trap in itself. To get 40 by yourself you have to collect it all then put it in the hopper one time. If you put it on early you have kelp spawn problems. I like the level 2 animal in B myself. It's a snallygaster, the deathclaw is probably the worst animal because it runs so fast and will get itself killed. Shutting down the experiment makes the pets crazy too xD but that's the only way to get formula q.
---
Does setting up a workshop only while pacifist allow people to attack you?  I did that but I didn't set up any turrets or anything.  That might explain the level 76 thing.
---
I love interesting camps with different rooms, I explore, buy something to say thanks, drink from the (mostly empty) punch bowl, sleep, use the workbenches and sometimes enjoy crashing on a seat if the camp has a nice atmosphere.
---
I wish there was a tip box we could put stuff in including caps, I'd love that. I'm always max caps and would be a great positive caps sync.
---
Yes it does.
---
If you dont want to pvp, stay away from workshops
---
Yeah well, 60 USD. First and last pre-order ever.
---
Oooo nice
---
I doubt there will be any time skip whatsoever. Most of the roadmap looks like Bethesda is throwing together content to dress up the original main quest after the fact. I would imagine the upcoming DLC is scripted to be played immediately after or even during the Wastelanders quest.
---
Y'all can still talk to him? He won't even ask for my help anymore.
---
I have no idea. Why do you insist on talking about something that has already been talked about to death?
---
If you wire a separate switch in you can turn it on and off. The button on it doesn't work though.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
I'm on the exact same boat mate. I've got nout.
---
I figured it'd give us a reason to keep gaining levels. Haven't seen what changes were made to it but I know a lot of people weren't really thrilled with the choices announced previously. There were a couple I liked though, and I'm looking forward to seeing what'll be added to the selection with the changes they're making.
---
Yes they can kill you in pacifist while you are in your owned workshop
---
That's gonna be Siiick, can't wait.
---
Yes.  Stay away from workshops unless you can defend yourself.  It is ok to go and claim them for the quest rewards and then leave at low level I did this alot when leveling.
---
Honestly you should be pretty safe at workshops either way.  I claim workshops a fair bit on public worlds and in 1000 hours I've only been attacked one time and it was because some dude killed me while i was asleep AFK in a  bed in my workshop.  I promptly came back and turned him into an ash pile and never saw them again.
---
Pre order now for early acces
---
But they didn't make a full set.
---
True buts it's not really about what's best it's about how you wanna play, as long as you are having fun that's great. I am actually gonna start a pa character right now I'm a bloodied / unyielding build melee
---
HUH. Weird. Oh well.
---
My last Mega Sloth got killed by Grahm. I was filling a vendor and heard the commotion, ran over and it was too late. Mega Sloth is particularly squishy. Deathclaw and Mirelurk King are a little better at handling minor spawns. 
---
Anyway, I hope you‚Äôre right!
---
The Thing-To-Do right now is grinding the daily Atom Challenges before Bethesda shuts off the tap in the next update.
---
Nice roll.
---
Power armor, heavy gunner/expert//master from strength, plus whatever else you fancy, blocker., bear arms, bandolier etc.
---
Stabilised from the INT tree, maybe one gun army from luck if you can spare the points. If you're running bloodied you want emergancy protocols on the PA and you also want nerd rage.
---
Have fun.
---
Dang, I had forgotten about that. Is it still around ?
---
Any loading screen longer than a 30 secs And I force quit caps be damned
---
You don't have to... Its just that it's easier to complete the event if you turn all the ore in at once
---
Hmm, I remember a certain company promise cosmetic only objects in the store. So beats me how they could of avoided using game play mechanics to force you to use the store.
---
Also you honestly claiming you spend your money on 1st to only organise your junk and that's fine with you?
---
Maybe I'm checking again I'll let you know
---
Most of the electrical wiring functions don‚Äôt work in Fallout 76.
---
No it turned out that I made a mistake when I opened a workshop.
---
A tirade, about what one wonders. I suppose then some people don't understand the game mechanics.
---
yes, but if you only have 2 or 3 people show up that's really hard to accomplish.  So it is better to keep one alive and complete the event than just fail.
---
Seasons will help with the tedium until o realise that you wont me able to play as much as you like as there will be a score point limit per day :) Bethesda Style....
---
I love closing the doors and being respectful while visiting, not that anyone notices... probably :)
---
Exactly and if someone does take the water they'll be full again in a couple minutes. I usually have at least 200 purified water on me anyway so I'm just not bothered.
---
Some people's vendor prices are extortionate! I'm always lowering my prices as I think it's too much and then I go to someone's camp and they have it 4x the price lol
---
Now I know.  I think some player jumped in front of me when I was firing at an enemy on purpose.  Which apparently some higher level players do.
---
Unlucky. Think it's a 25% chance, but not positive.
---
Idk, maybe they should rethink "endgame" as centered around raid type events (those could still go on), but do something server-wide that would affect things server-wide.
---
My camp is about 100 feet off the ground, built into one of the satellites near the national array. I had a pet molerat who patrolled on the platform, but spawned on the ground level whenever I joined a server. The *one* time I didn't immediately spawn at my camp to escort him up the stairs, he got picked off by random spawns.
---
I suggested, a while back, that for "end-game" legendaries would have the chance to drop a variation on the "legendary module" - like Bloodied or Anti-Amor, followed by the other effects (like FFR , FR, LD, etc) - which we could then apply to an existing weapon.
---
To make it a grind, they'd still be incredibly rare....just a thought.
---
This is the way.
---
Omg that sounds amazing. I always get junkie stuff from the scrip person but I never use any of the meds stuff. Maybe the game is trying to tell me something.
---
Wow
---
But nothing smells the same anymore.
---
Thanks.
---
It's random.
---
Do the Operation Tidy (Kiddie Cabins) and Stings and Things (Dolly Sods) and those give possum badges too. Operation Tidy gives them to me a lot.
---
Damn, guess I'll have to keep doing it
---
You have to also remember there is no stop gap to run PA. It is very cheap to make and maintain and give a lot of benefits. 
---
Normal armor you need to find/craft/buy the perfect pieces for your build. It costs quite a bit to maintain and doesn‚Äôt have the same benefits as PA. 
---
For clarity I used to run a full excavator build and the. A T-51 &amp; x-01 pa build but now am a bloodied build with unyielding sent armor. It was much much easier to get off the ground with PA then finding everything I needed for my bloodied build.
---
I‚Äôm only level 18 at the moment, so thankfully the endgame issue is a LONG ways off for me. Sure it‚Äôll rest it‚Äôs ugly head in time.
---
I had no idea we can still damage peoples camp items, the decon arch is pricey to repair too.
---
I don't do this event to complete it, I do it for the Nocturnal Pitchforks
---
No worries, I just realised I said the same thing as /u/Kantusa, ah well. That about covers it anyway.
---
Also it turned out a high level character jumped in front of a monster I was fighting.  Probably on purpose apparently.  This was before i turned on pacifist.
---
Congratulations to your 50 glass shards.
---
That is interesting I have done it easily a hundred times and never got 1
---
Unlucky üòñ I found the most effective way to grind badges is through stings n things repeatable. Collect a bunch of the ingredients, turn them in, serve hop, then repeat. Boring as hell, but essentially unlimited attempts at your disposal.
---
Very good reason, I respect that, not thought really of the roleplay aspect, probably I'm being to selfish.
---
Yup nothing I think I'm going to reset the quest and see if that works thank you
---
Because, like I said, the game changes, and people have new ideas. If I have something new to say on an old topic, why should I be silenced?
---
For example, it would be cool if we could apply our photo mode poses if/when mannequins or power armor chassis are added to our C.A.M.P. displays. Maybe someone has mentioned it before, but if they did it was likely squashed by the moderators, so why would Bethesda ever think to implement?
---
when the reward is missiles and a missile launcher I feel I am being punished rather than rewarded.
---
I wasn‚Äôt even aware they were broken. Bloody hell, any one remember Beth promising us that Wastelanders would bring a substantial amount of bug fixes? Bleh.
---
He‚Äôs only level 60 as well. I planned out exactly what perks he would need and when I would need to get them using the various perk load out builders. Only took 2 weeks, but I also started a brand new character.
---
After reading more it seems like a high level player jumped in front of a monster I was fighting before i changed the setting to pacifist.  Apparently they do that.
---
Split second? You‚Äôre giving the game too much credit lol
---
Takes at least 10 seconds to load in unless you were standing right next to the event area.
---
Furthermore, when you fast travel to an event via the map, you get a little window that tells you exactly how the event plays out before you actually hit the button to initiate fast travel. People trying to pass off their incompetence or sheer unwillingness to read basic instructions by claiming there was absolutely no chance to have seen them is just laughable.
---
And EVEN then, the event hets added to your top right quest log whichs tells you exactly what to do. At this point at least there‚Äôs no more excuses other than complete illiteracy.
---
Maybe Events need some variety themselves. Have some catering to different playstyles (stealth, melee, have some where being in PA there's actually a penalty).
---
Invisible grenades, they get me every time because I can't stop myself from looting the imaginary ones some corpses contain.
---
Yeah you get the gold from crafting a full sh and full solar/thorn set
---
Idk if it‚Äôs like that on pc but not on PS4 where I play
---
Yea I wore PA frames until I got my uny, I'm still going through the process of switching everything to ss armor so definitely more viable to run pa early on
---
For me, I always set ammo at 1c, fusion cores at 50c and plans at 1/3 of their value aside from PA plans which will usually go for 1/3 to full price and basic plans needed for new players which go for 1c. If I've got mounted plans, they'll be free since no one buys them. 
---
Anything more is stupid. No one will pay it.
---
I'll keep on the lookout, sounds neat.
---
I had better luck with the two daily quests, particularly Operation Tidy, but RNG can be a bitch.
---
Does this mean series x players and xbox one players will be on the same servers?
---
Dodgy is needed also if running bloodied, not like you are running vats for the AP.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean. It‚Äôs a great early game choice and if you are a heavy build PA is kinda essential, so it just really depends on your build.
---
This, so tired of having to create a whole new jetpack to change the skin on it.
---
Also yes.  After reading a bit more the high level player jumped in front of a wolf I was shooting at.  Apparently they do this intentionally so they can kill you.  Then after I went pacifist after that I activated the workshop.
---
Isn't that a daily? Same with camp one.
---
well now im swapping back to standard, thank you for the info, everyone in my groups already had the gold icon so we could check to see that the emote challenge was legacy.
---
Re: the turrets, I think I remember several high up on the walls along with those posted low at head height. I missed one and my quest sat idle until I found it. Good luck!
---
Nice shot mate and I like the campfire lighting, I'm starting to do more and more in game photography. I enjoy shooting nuke drops, IK think I'm going to start a collection of differrent locations as they are being nuked, I have a few already that I like and they make for good loading screens.
---
Sharp looking uniform, General.
---
Exactly. Some dude gave me a Junkies Explosive 15 reload .50 cal for the emmett radiation suit when the event was new
---
Eh players like that are a tiny fraction of the playerbase. Myself and my friends are all lvl 300-500 on our mains and we don't abuse new players.
---
Please take into consideration that we exist
---
I main a flaming chainsaw and too fucking bad it doesnt work with friendly fire.. it would have been my new job healing on these events.
---
It is. It's great to see people notice the big sign board explaining the game, then start running (or at high levels, bunny hopping) around trying to find them. It's also hilarious because I am devious as fuck, which means there is always a few that require you to break your own search habits. Watching someone circle the camp for the fifth time, running past the last one each time, never gets old. I tend to hop on the mic and offer hints around then, but some folks really just want to find it themselves.
---
I‚Äôd rather have a unmodded .38 pipe pistol than a fucking missile launcher
---
At least I can switch between my waifu, Sofia, and my side action, Wanderer.
---
A flaming chainsaw would be rad as hell to use with Friendly Fire, shame it doesn't work :c
---
Well I was being a dumb noob and trying to figure out how to start the automated food factory thing when the level 75 guy came in and killed me instantly.  My love of preserved instamash did me in on my pacifist run.
---
Yeah. I wish I had the emote. Just couldn't bring myself to do it. Might have if it looked different then the flag pose
---
Yeah good point, missed that, also suppressor/tenderizer can be worth it sometimes too.
---
The Burrows? Yeah, but it hasn't been changed since it was added, so it's still just a bunch of ghouls with a chance at a legendary or two and the exp from killing them. I think a lot of us forgot about it after the first couple days because it was literally just another place to kill a load of ghouls.
---
Thats my favorite workshop!  
---
Honestly ive very rarely had problems there with any pvp.  Think you just got unlucky
---
Dont forget eating corpses afterwards.
---
I buy them from grahm and sell them for 1k a pop, though you can find but is rare at harpers ferry.
---
It really hurt when i found out it didnt! I have a dual bar mod on it too.. it looks fucking awesome.. i might try it once more without the dual bar mod on it but i doubt it works..
---
Oh god I remember when I wouldn't check my inventory after doing a quest and then trying to figure out why I'm overencombered. Only to look in ammo to find that I have 35 missiles and 21 mini nukes.
---
Missiles=2lb 35√ó2=70
---
Mini nukes=6lb 21√ó6=126
---
Ugh I found someone with 2mm EC ammo for 10 caps each earlier lmfao
---
All I‚Äôve heard is that they are delayed and won‚Äôt be on Patch 20, but that was just from one source so far. Hopeful someone else knows more with citable sources.
---
I went with raiders on my alt, killed johnny. My main went with foundation, johnny lived. Now a lot of times I go into raider camp (full rep too) my main gets called a sucker! My alt they talk about the snitch.
---
It's also a recipe for "Unable to remove. Part of the Structure will be inaccessible." Place at your own risk!
---
I always take 1 point in tenderizer and 1 star lone wander (swap for sup if in a group) since I take 3 charisma for hard bargain. Bloody mess is also a + since it is more damage.
---
I was thinking this, I have done all these so many times and have only ever got possum badges from the challenges, sad times.
---
I guess I did.  I got killed once with a high level guy jumping in front of a wolf I was shooting at.  And then I was dumb enough to start up the workshop and a level 75 guy was apparently just waiting for low level players there.  So yeah unlucky.
---
It's not so much criticism, it's posting something, and then a mod sees your post and doesn't like it.
---
ive never played this game less than lately. 80+ treasury notes on two characters that are both rounding 200, i could sharpen my pvp skills sure but then why would i even want to play nuclear winter when i can just get a good vats thing going in adventure to aimbot the masses? and what then? i‚Äôm becoming an events only player, better implement fasnacht year round lol üò≠
---
They're doing an admirable job considering that the Live Team's mission statement might as well be turning goat piss into gasoline with nothing but a coffee filter and high hopes.
---
Ive done it like 8 times and gotten 2
---
let me have my fun ;-;
---
I started over with Wastelanders and I specifically avoided the basement where the Vox quest starts specifically because I hated having a permanent syringer in my inventory taking up space that I couldn't remove because of the Vox daily quest.
---
Killed over trying to figure out how to make preserved Instamash.
---
Yes completely fine with me it's a living game, this game is a design with multiplayer in a singleplayer design is what I always wanted out of fallout. Plus I understand that companies need to pay or the game to get better. That does not happen for free.
---
The helmet is actually subpar compared to the standard ones, but I could see a paint skin being available. 
---
If you can make an Excavator suit look like Patriot Prime (‚ÄòPatrivator‚Äô), I don‚Äôt see why there couldn‚Äôt be a Steel Mill skin available.
---
The source you‚Äôre talking about is from Bethesda themselves, they made a post about it!
---
I wonder of we'd still be able to edit the outside because to me that sounds like a fixed exterior.
---
Dont be that dumb lvl 5 player who takes a workshop or that guy that clicks seek revenge
---
Don't worry about making an elaborate camp starting out. Keep it small, like a 2x2 shack, with all the benches, a stash box, and a bed and instrument. That way, you can easily move it around for an on-demand scrap/stash which will help immensely early-on. On my new characters, i only make a permanent camp when they've finished the main story. By then, you'll likely have way more cool camp plans so it's more worthwhile anyway.
---
Not a bad idea actually.
---
That‚Äôs not the source I saw. I was watching InnovSurvivalist. 
---
Do you have a link to the Bethesda post?  If so, that would be appreciated.
---
This. So much this!
---
The main quests being non-repeatable makes sense, but bugs the crap out of me... Think about how much Dev time went into them, how original and fun some were. ( I personally enjoyed the Mistress of Mystery chain a lot. ) All that time and effort just to be done only once per character... What a waste.
---
There should be an option to repeat them if chosen, where obviously the unique reward would be left out, but the basic rewards and exp wouldn't. That way you could have more to do than just SBQ and random Events at end-game.
---
Also... Why remove the only Raid in the game? With an already staggering lack of end-game content, removing something that big can only be seen as a mistake. Revamp it, sure... but to just yank it out completely? 
---
Bethesda, you're peeing on your own feet here.
---
Its not buggy, you just not doing enough dmg.
---
And these means what?
---
On a 13 year old engine with a multiplayer component crammed into it, no-less. Im sure the programming gymnastics required to accomplish anything on this is staggering, and the higher-ups clearly only care about hitting deadlines rather than pushing out finished product.
---
Lol this is the entire game, I'm surprised they didn't just shut down fallout 76 in the first week since no one was playing because it had bugs.
---
\- Bethesda: y no one on survival
---
\- Players: your game is unbalanced and it's broken please fix so we can enjoy this mode
---
\- Bethesda: Oh yea.. let's shut that shit down and try something else.
---
We had one die like that and immediately dunk her right back into the rift she came from. After a few minutes, her body respawned at the physical location that she died and fall to the ground. Might be because she fell out the world, who knows.
---
Best part? The asshole who bitched about other players wasting ammo shooting the queen (apparently, shooting her in any way now stops her from landing? All I know is the DPS put out when she landed was not really any better) got pissy, bitched for a couple minutes, and left seconds before I found the body.
---
Hey, I upvoted you haha. I was just being snarky #bufftheclaw
---
Well, naturally.
---
it was probably like tazbaz said 
---
" The ‚Äúguard‚Äù  scavs will take damage, stupidly enough. The essential technician scavs will not, and be healed. "
---
That is a useful "work around" to learn. Thanks.
---
I'd come and help but I need to figure out which 3 star items I need to destroy in order to be able to move first... so I can do an event and have a chance at a different 3 star.
---
If Fallout 5 aint out by the time Xbox 5 comes out what then? üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Non of the daily/weekly challenges bugs will ever be fuxed as they are gone once the season starts.
---
It would most likely be something like a door or maybe something like an underground entrance like basement doors, or whatever that would act as a loading portal into your interior. 
---
Something similar to home plate in fallout 4 I would imagine. You would still have your main camp and can decorate around the entrance but the primary thing would be the interior.
---
The workshop has a pop-up that wants you about this. And Pacifist only says that you don‚Äôt damage other players. Not that other players can‚Äôt damage you. 
---
 Consider it your trial by fire, and now you know more about how to avoid PvP. 
---
Most players aren‚Äôt like that. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll meet nicer people soon enough.
---
How are your perks? Is your gun primed? I've never ran in to issues with not getting loot from her
---
Automatic doors are ugly (and one of them still installs reversed. Wtf Bethesda?) and don‚Äôt fit the decor of my camp, unfortunately.
---
You can use vats with grenades? Da fuq?
---
Yeah this happened to me 2 times yesterday. I spent all my ammo both times. No reward...
---
It‚Äôs weird how Blackeye acknowledges your mirelurk meat contributions, but no other NPC makes note of your progress or rep after completing the quest line.
---
Active Redditors are *maybe* like 10% of the playerbase, plus a lot of people who post here dont even own/play the game
---
I have learned my lesson.  Preserved Instamash is not worth it.
---
But the first time I died was because a higher level player jumped in front of a wolf I was fighting.  I don't know how new players are supposed to know about all that nonsense.
---
Doesn‚Äôt change anything, when you are at max caps, you are essentially giving it all away.
---
A whole entire core, eh.
---
1200 damage to the 48000 life pool (after mutation)  is not an unreasonable ecpectaion IMO.  Thats 1/40 or 2.5% of her total m life.
---
Or underground
---
Well in theory you should get loot as soon as you‚Äôve hit your enemy just one time right?
---
Like OP, I‚Äôve missed out on a lot of loot this way as well.
---
My perks are for rifle unfortunately so they're not very good at dealing enough damage to her quickly. I have a bloody handmade but it always seems like less damage than just blasting her in the face with the gatling laser. None of them are primed, but I'd really prefer not to have to make ultracite ammo for any of my every day weapons just to kill her.
---
Completed beckets line and no daily. Sophia back pain bug I I want not even get her as an ally. Scavenger grandpa doesn't do anything besides try to get me to I'll his finger. Does anyone left at Bethesda know how to code a quest?!
---
Just wondering who‚Äôs we
---
Nothing works with T-65.  Better off making Strangler Heart.
---
I mean true haha, if you have an out of bounds house like in the side of the mountain or under the terrain good ways to protect them.
---
I'm just 3 levels away and will probably wait for the next xp boost weekend. The Nuclear Winter grind is real to a casual like myself, but I want that paint.
---
You missed the most important one, remove frog legs as a perk :P .
---
Other than that loading in at the same time and special being different in NW is very important.
---
I only do event when juiced up for exp point gain anyway....dont care if it fails or succeeds... as long as I get to kill stuff. Heck, I kill the remaining scavengers if it fails and consider it a few more experience points for my time. Yeh- I am a warmonger.
---
Slowly walks away backwards.......
---
Thanks so much. üëç
---
this happened to me during fasnacht but nobody was as astonished as I was so I figured it was only me who could see the effect
---
Yes and when you hit them in vats it immediately detonates them. If a grenade is thrown near an enemy you can just cats, wait for it to reach near the enemy, shoot. Most grenades will 1 shot the enemy. It is completely overpowered and required very little skill.
---
It seems that way, but it's really because the PvP mechanics have either been weakened to the point of not working or didn't really work to begin with. So, there's almost no point in being a dick to people, or being a dick takes a lot more effort. If it didn't take so much effort, FO76 would be just as griefy as GTAV in a heartbeat. That said, enjoy it.
---
Empty warehouses full of empty.
---
There's your problem. You need perks. Also a prime gattling laser is extremely efficient. 2 cores, 1 vilote flux, 1 ultracite. Gets you 3 cores with a chance at getting 5. They are the best gun to prime
---
PC players
---
I get this all the time. I (151) find low levels (usually 1-15) and try to drop my excess plans and aid and stuff just to help out like people once did for me. I'm usually wearing the all black FO1st gear or the Ritual Mask and Bindings and they immediately flee, even using friendly emotes.
---
I find that I have to put on something less threatening-- the Daredevil Suit or the Ratty Skirt with no helmets-- to get them to be less freaked out.
---
Never glitched Satan's Fire Halo, though. I'd buy a flaming armor skin.
---
Happens to me too on one of my characters
---
Showed someone the way inside my camp and they proceeded to drink all my nuka cola.. than tried to get into my punch bowl.
---
Normally you‚Äôd be correct, but with how insanely fast the thirst meter depletes now I jealously guard whatever my small purifier produces.
---
Same for me, I get level ups a lot without much effort, but im also the "if it moves, kill it" kind of player, level 1 tick or level 80 scorched beast, ill shoot at it if its near me.
---
Could even make it a time-gated thing.
---
No problem! If you're ever wondering how weapons compare just Google "fo76 weapon damage calculator" and put in your stats.
---
Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes
---
Well if you dont even do 1% of her hp have you really hit her?
---
I think this is just a visual glitch. I notice it from time to time while swapping characters but never tried to test out their usage.
---
I have a lot of gold but nothing you can buy with it interests me.
---
This sounds like the right way to me will have to give it a try
---
How many purifiers do you have? 
---
I've got six but that's only so I need to come every few hours to get more water.
---
According to the terminal, they were just waiting on production. From the helmet and the terminal entry, our character should be able to gage how it works, and since we can craft the normal skin, I‚Äôd argue we can figure out how to make a full set.
---
if you're specifically talking about the season pass which will be released in the coming weeks, the point of those is not and has never been to add end game content/ 
---
if you're referring to the seasonal updates, time will tell. The current belief is that expeditions is the second stab at a raid/dungeon mechanic with public teams being the first step towards them by acting as a much needed matchmaking feature to ensure the success of that sort of mechanic.
---
Daily ops may also prove promising
---
Well that‚Äôs discussable haha. But you can‚Äôt expect everyone to have a crazy damage build. 
---
So yeah in theory it should reward you.
---
You starting on Xbox? Been playing since release as well. happy to set a couple basic camp items down, craft you a decent rifle, and give you a little head start. 
---
Also happy to explain the meta to you, what you should be working toward, and what your options are!
---
Who says we can‚Äôt have a powerfist in every hand
---
It‚Äôs only subpar on the helmet you find it on, since it‚Äôs level thirty. It can be added to level 50 helmets, to become stronger.
---
Weird. I get a badge at least every four or five times on OT.
---
Did you get flux treasury notes and the 1 confirmed rare? If you did then you got the  take forever to load your loot on the Queen's body bug, it once took 5 mins to load my loot.
---
I hit her with 10 tomahawks and some gunfire at level 2 and got to loot her
---
Ok so if ur perks are either not ment for heavy, and your low level and only using one fusion core, do you think you participated enough in the dmg of the sbq to get rewards? Do you think you being there added a good benefit? Your one fusion core does not make hp for the extra dr u gave the queen and one fusion core is piss. So either your lvl and shouldnt be doing sbq or you have a foodbuild and should make a new character.   You probably did less than 500 with your one fusion core boss. You the kinda person to make the sbq fight harder
---
I thought it had lower stats even comparing level 50 to 50. I‚Äôll have to look again.
---
Maybe you missed?
---
&gt;  I'm surprised they didn't just shut down fallout 76 in the first week since no one was playing
---
dumbass statements like that ensure nobody pays attention to the rest of your comment, congrats
---
If they're using brick walls in their camp you can jump through certain windows. There's a window that has a beam in the middle and another type that doesn't. The type that doesn't is able to be jumped through
---
Unlucky.  But Campfire Tales really isn't the best way to grind for Possum Badges.  Your best bet is to grind the two Dailies, Stings and Things at Dolly Sods in the Mire, and Operation Tidy at the Kiddie Corner Cabins.  They aren't 100% chance by any means, but they are much faster to complete and can be done every day.
---
Nevertheless, expect that it's going to take 2-3 weeks.
---
my grew learned the strategy for weeks 1 and 3 and were able to run them easily and quickly with little to no issue.
---
week 2 was a bitch for us and we just couldnt get the final portion down pat
---
but to say they were buggy unplayable messes is a completely assanine statement
---
As long as you do your killing job well and keeping the scavengers alive there‚Äôs no complaint.
---
While I agree they didn't do much damage at all. The Queen dose not scale per player. That was disproved some time ago
---
I only switched over about a month ago. Before that I was a regular sneak commando and 2 handed melee build on my 2 characters. I just used weapon modifiers for extra damage. That being said I love the junkies build. Just look at your stats for the slots you don't use and get addictions that take away those. I'm hitting for 180 base damage with my junkies explosive combat rifle and it's automatic. 400 to 600 per shot with everything kicked in. I'm hitting 900 base damage with my super sledge going up to almost 1400 with everything kicked in and between 4 and 5k power attack damage.
---
Level 0 lock on everything to encourage wanted levels.
---
So please.. Come in, helps yourself to some lead and scrap üòâ
---
One small purifier. My camp isn‚Äôt near a body of water, and while I could build a few rows of the smaller ones I just don‚Äôt like the way it looks.
---
It was mentioned in the most recent ITV

#oneofus
---
my group ground out the full strangler completely legit and i feel like we were some of the rare few who did so.
---
actually got accused of purchasing and was being insulted a few weeks ago because someone didnt believe we were easily able to just grind out enough steel
---
Which side of Rule 10?
---
Retired topics or trading posts?
---
It isn‚Äôt, sorry.
---
Weeks 1 and 3 were great.  I will admit that week 2 was the only mission I did not really like because it was pretty annoying and could be difficult for sure.  For the final part we would use PA frames to block the doorways when protecting the geck.  worked like a charm.
---
Uranium fever is your best friend. Make sure you have glow sight maxed and you are good.
---
I'm only really trying to get the plans for the backpack, I really don't care much about the mods and stuff, is it still gonna take that long?
---
Cross platform with the same platform
---
I think they used to consistently, but got nerfed some time ago, and stopped dropping them for the most part.
---
I still have a 20% chance I get them from Campfire, but I stopped doing the dailies, as it never seemed to reward any, anymore.
---
At first I was on board with the post above you, but you make more sense.
---
Sparkllllllllllezzzzz
---
oh, so it's something that's attached to the camp and not separate? Sounds nice
---
Sorry I should've been more specific.  Posts related to "trading".  Retired topics seems to be moderated well enough.
---
The theory is they were removed as the upcoming Expeditions will be a revised and hopefully more polished attempt at a raid/dungeon mechanic
---
but really, they should have left them in, even if nobody really used them at least they would be there for people to attempt.
---
Thanks, man!  I figured Innov was accurate but I always like to see the source myself.
---
Bad design and no real reward to put the effort in.
---
Everything you mentioned requires having a decent build, i.e. basically being broken.  98% of players are not capable of dealing with 4 glowing ones simultaneously.
---
I did RR and was able to deal with 1 side easily thanks to being able to easily 1-shot things, had 2 other 100+ players in PA with heavy guns on the turret side and ghouls kept getting past them because they weren't capable of killing them.  We ended up winning because I kept going and killing their ghouls and we had other people show up to run ore.
---
I did PP, boss spawned, ran right at the bug and 1-shot it.  Loss since  the 4 of us couldn't 1-shot the boss.
---
Vault 94 was just a clusterfuck of memorizing where things spawn, hoping you guess right where they are and being able to 1-shot stuff at the higher levels.
---
And why should I put the effort in?  I need to destroy multiple 3 star legendaries just to cut enough weight to be able to fast travel to an event that will just give me more garbage to crap on the ground.
---
That means there is something extremely wrong with your build or playstyle, not the game
---
Do you have damage numbers turned on so you can see them? If not turn them on and compare youre bloodied rifle to the gat plasma. That plasma is probably only doing a few damage to her even though it feels like more. I bet your bloodied rifle does atleast 50 per hit to her head. You'd only need like 25 rounds to get credit at that rate.
---
It doesn‚Äôt show up as a reward and usually doesn‚Äôt even show up in the Pip Boy right away, but maybe 1 time in 5 I get a badge.
---
Yeah thats why i always ran my gold icon to prove that I built it myself.
---
I would imagine it would be part of you camp to be an instanced interior. Perhaps they do something different with it, but I would think that‚Äôs the easiest way for them to do it.
---
Alright!
---
wish we would have thought of that. would have gotten that strangler heart a bit faster by not having to wait a week.
---
My biggest annoyance is allowing the plans and steel being purchasable with bullion. I can understand the vault steel being available for people who earned the plans in the raids but could not get enough steel, but allowing the plans to be purchased is a bit of a kick in the teeth for those of us who actually did the raids
---
FYI, that bug only shows for you. No one else sees you on fire
---
Sorry but papa Howard most likely isn‚Äôt going to port 76 over to the ps5 I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôd be Skyrim instead
---
A lot of the trading post moderation is done via AutoMod because it's the most efficient way to cut down on the metric buttload of people making WTT/WTS posts without reading the rules.
---
We frequently approve false positive removals from that AutoMod condition, but you have to send a modmail for us to see it, like the bot says.
---
Does it say anywhere that you have to do a certain amount of damage to enemies to get their loot?
---
I‚Äôve had the same good build myself for a year now and sometimes I just don‚Äôt get the loot. 
---
That‚Äôs not my play style then.
---
I pumped 100 rounds(?) into her face, must be another glitch. _I've heard they're kinda common_
---
Someone bought all of the 7 food items I was selling (rare item recipes) and I thought that was pretty nice. I thought maybe because my camp is very spartan.
---
My fully perked heavy does about 2 or 3 damage a shot with an ultracite gatling so without you're going to he doing 1 per hit. When you hit. Which isn't that often with those things. So you have a max of 999 damage from a core minus misses. There's you're problem/answer.
---
Her humming makes me want to check myself into the asylum with the Wendigo as my warden.
---
Campfire Tales isn't worth the effort. You are better off doing Stings and Things. Just keep all the insect parts you come across and when you have everything needed you can complete the event in one trip in about 30 seconds.
---
Protips: Stingwing barbs will be the least common. Easiest way to get them is just to do the public Tea Time event, which will probably also net you a bunch of other insect parts (and some Treasury Notes).
---
You can go to Raleigh Clay's bunker just south of Dolly Sods (1 cap away) to get the Radroach meat.  Its also a good place to farm fungus for the daily atom quest.
---
I just starting using a PA heavy build with the a Furious Flamer. I‚Äôm having a ton of fun with it. I also use a shitty flaming chainsaw for laughs. I find that every week or so I mix up my builds and move my camp.
---
They need to take NW behind the shed and shoot it... and release non-battle royale pvp games! I've 99% stopped playing because I cant stand waiting in lobbies so much to play and sometimes getting killed within the 1st minute or 2 of the match...
---
Maybe...if it's already in your inventory...you're the one that's stealing it?
---
Do you sleepwalk?
---
Yeah, I hate coming back and seeing shit blown all to hell.
---
They should just give you bulk ammo scrap as a reward instead.
---
OK.
---
Is it the computer version or the Xbox version, because saying "CD" could imply every system and PC.
---
If its Xbox, unplug from the wall for 1 minute and plug back in, try it then
---
If its PC, uninstall and reinstall.
---
My CAMP is technically locked but it's only to prevent people from leaving the door open and enemies getting in, it's nothing personal.
---
I welcome visitors though and have made my CAMP extremely easy to "break in to" and even have arrows pointing to a break in window directly next to the locked door with the words "entrance".  
---
Considering how easy the majority of locked CAMP's are to break into, I imagine many other players are doing the same and aren't trying to keep players out (windowless CAMP owners deserve a nuke though haha).
---
I recently started locking my stuff - except for the main entrance with the workbenches. Had a nice outdoor garden for farming adhesive, an aluminum extractor and three medium water purifiers and scrap bot. Came back from a long tour of the country-side and found a level 171 in my garden (like 3x my level at that time), picking up the last tato. He had just robbed me blind. Even the water purifiers and aluminum extractor were empty. Which sucked, as I was both thirsty and out of anything drinkable.
---
Since then the garden is indoors and locked and all collectors are locked. Even that doesn't help much as I recently noticed, but it's at least a start.
---
It used to be a daily now its "repeatable" so you can do it over and over by server hopping. I noticed the change with Wastelanders but could have been earlier.
---
only the bigger windows.  
---
why lock your camp anyway? afright someone steal your workbench or dare to use it?...   
---
don't be a douche, let others see your camp! they can't do anything that harms you, so no worries.
---
Mine was freezing her fine. What are the effects on yours?
---
I think the freezing effect might be tied to your heavy gun perks or lack thereof. Since moving from a heavy to a commando my cryo doesn't seem as effective on her.
---
That said, I made the change right around when patch 18 went live, so it could have been stealth nerfed along with all the other weapon balance adjustments they made without telling us.
---
I had the same problem with him.  So I replaced him with Grandpa.  Then I thought "Let's give Grandpa this novelty eye-patch I bought from the Atom Shop."  But when I gave it to him, all of his other clothes disappeared.  And now I can't bring myself to play the game.
---
Play it like any fallout game, you wouldnt fight stuff stronger than ur lvl right?
---
Every time she goes on about how sweet Mirelurk Queen meat is I want to puke.
---
If you want to max out your damage output, use both.
---
Lol are you butt hurt because I said fallout was released in a disgusting mess and it surprises me that they didn't just take our money and run? Nothing I said there was positive enough to warrant anyone paying attention to it. I've stopped giving Bethesda the benefit of the doubt, they lost that from me.
---
My camp is open. I was just curious because I fell through my window building my general store.
---
Not shooting her when she's flying helps. You can shoot her a little bit to get her attention if she starts flying around too much but she definitely lands more frequently when she isnt constantly getting shot while she's flying.
---
I designed mine around the marsupial mutation. You have it all the workbenches and some free food is just a hop away, you don‚Äôt you gotta walk through the rest of my fancy camp.
---
At least it‚Äôs locked behind gold bullion. I‚Äôll be more upset when I see all of the things we are grinding for in the store. üôÉ
---
Backpack you get from the Tadpole quest that starts at the lake near grafton dam. 
---
The brewing station is from the nukashine quest that‚Äôs at Morgantown(I believe) in one of the frat houses on the outskirts.
---
You need to get yourself a few more! Hide them behind a fence or something. 
---
Or keep getting flux from nuke zones. When they decay, they turn into inert flux which is easy hydration.
---
To clarify jow the ADS (aim down sights) bug works --&gt; if you are sprinting and right click to ADS before slowing to a run or walk, the game will gkitch and pull you out of the sights into a hipfire pose instead including the inaccuracy thereto. The only way to fix the pose is by reloading the weapon.
---
Let's hope you or your visitors didn't just take some rad x!
---
Not in the slightest, just saying that the statement that nobody was playing a week after relase is entirely false and the furthest from the truth
---
I had a glitch were I was just a pile of ash
---
Ahh okay that makes sense.  
---
Im relatively new to this sub and reddit in general as i usually tended to frequent official forums so i was pretty unfamiliar with how moderation especially with automod works here.  Appreciate the explanation.
---
Everybody here also says energy weapons suck, yet everybody uses laser gatlings at Scorched Earth. There's a very distinct disparity between what this particular sub says and what players in game are actually doing most of the time.
---
Because Bugthesda.
---
Anything else I've missed and need to know?
---
I use 3 small water purifiers and it gives me plenty, it's worth it to use them. I have them in a row next to my camp and think it looks quite nice. 
---
Also I'd invest in some Endurance perk cards to slow hunger and thirst if you haven't already. The Charisma card 'Happy Camper' is good to slow it at your camp. If I didn't use these cards I'd literally be eating/drinking every couple minutes.
---
Happy to help.
---
We've actually made some adjustments to how AutoMod handles possible trading posts lately, based on community feedback.
---
Does the pa block trick still work ? Ie you take a shit ton of suits (0 weight) put them down and nothing can pass them?
---
Yeah it was super insulting but what can you do.  MORPG games are constantly doing this to their most hardcore players to cater more to casuals
---
you can get the small backpack in the morgantown airport.. 
---
the standard backpack comes from the tadpole missions
---
read the poster in a train station to start the nukashine/biv quests that give you the brewing station
---
Exactly. 
---
It seems that they are fond of releasing something geared for end-game, then yanking it, and claiming they're going to re-release it. They're doing it with the Wendigo Colossus right now, and it -still- won't be released in the next patch.
---
It's 'measure twice, cut once' not the other way around.
---
To start the nukashine quest, you have to click on a poster at one of the train stations (I believe).
---
I can't find the post right now, but someone data mined the event triggers a while ago and found that the rewards are entirely dependent on how much ore you collect. As long as you fill the collector you have a chance at the rare rewards, even if only one npc survived.
---
Do I just walk into the airport and pick it up?
---
My flamer build melts! I‚Äôve been using it as a primary. I‚Äôm happy that I can kill a gutsy in half a second as opposed to using a bunch of .50 rounds. But yes fuel sucks to make and I have to buy it from everyone as I come across it. But I‚Äôm having a lot of fun with it.
---
Definitely a step in the right direction.
---
I've been looking since vending came back, haven't seen a single plan from that event for sale. Lots of the outfits for 1000's of caps each though.
---
I can not answer for sure, and the only reason I  am is because I don't know if anyone can for sure. I've heard that tents down make her not land, that floating tents keep her up, staggering keeps her up, crippling keeps her down, stagger doesn't effect, blah blah blah. I think it's all conjecture.
---
Backpack with mods are Tadpole Quests....regular backpack is at morgan airport but you cant add mods to that one.
---
Brewing Station you get after you complete the nukashine quest...read the party poster in any train station.
---
In my experience, she will land specifically to attack a player.  If you observe scorchbeasts in general, when they land, it appears to always be swooping down on a player.  
---
I was in a server that did 3x queens last night, and the 3rd was a failure.  Plenty of high levels but almost everyone was sitting on the fences or top of the Bravo9 bunker.  The queen was just circling off in the distance.  Attempts to draw her over to the crowd failed.
---
On #2, The thing that stops her or slows her down from landing is when she is staggered.  So if you watch when a bunch of people with explosive weapons are spamming her, you can kind of see her animations stuttering.  If a constant stream of staggering happens, she doesn't appear to have a chance to move or land.
---
These aren't tested/scientific findings...just observations from hundreds of queen fights.
---
Sweet. Thanks.
---
Can't reuse them as load screens though. :/
---
The tadpole quest takes *forever* to complete, though some tasks are easier to do than others. For me, I did the Hunters Badge, Archery Badge, and Athletics Badge
---
you dont need possum badges to get the full backpack, just the tadpole quest (3 tadpole badges) and the other stuff. I got the full back pack and bought the chem weight reduction mod from the raiders for bullion
---
Who takes rad x when they have mutations? Gotta dilute that shit.
---
Tbh I'd actually prefer a tdm but we just have adventure pvp and nuke winter. I'd rather nuke winter.
---
You‚Äôre right, forgot to say this can also go for the Tadpole quest as well.
---
There are others after right?
---
I think the daily ops.will be this, rewards for clearing locations. I just hope it's not a "one dungeon a day!" Situation.
---
Lol..of course and I am very good at killing. If it crawls, slides, fly through the Wasteland...big or little...I kill the hell out of it. Most players withstanding. ;)
---
Hey sometimes you forget yourself in the moment.
---
Ritual Mask + Gift Emote is the Windowless van w/ free candy sign of 76.
---
I started playing in the first hour this game got launched (would have been first minute but ofc Bethesda screwed that up too and had to redownload a 50gb game). The game was a meme at the start, most people who played got bored and stopped in the first few weeks. If you want to take a few thousand people playing as a "There was more than nobody" kind of number go ahead but as much as I love this game to death, monkeys are managing it and people defending it like you give those managers the fire to keep this bs going.
---
To get here to land you want to make sure everybody is in an open area without obstacles for her. She'll never land if people stay on top of the dropsite or their tents. If you or anyone else has perks that stagger than yes, shooting her in the air will stop her from landing. Perhaps in the future they'll fix her so you can cripple her wings again, but until than it's best not to waste ammo and effort trying to shoot her while she's in flight.
---
You clearly have the guts to help. Good job vault dweller.
---
my teammates also had a datamine info where it tells it is sturdy, but i cant find it anymore.
---
I mean, he already brought dragons over
---
This happens all the time with Ultracite Legacies in PvP. If you ever want to greet someone like that again.
---
Back during the Christmas event I would hand out level 5 and 10 legendaries every day to new players. So many were leery... Had to build a bare bones camp with only a billboard a cot and a rad arch to help out the skittish ones at ease.
---
It would be nice if you could put a sign on your tent to tell noobs to friend and fast travel to your camp to get free stuff
---
I'm on Xbox one
---
I just tried what you just said but it still doesn‚Äôt work  :'(  
---
You think is the game or the "cd" (sorry i'm french and in france we use the term "cd")
---
Quite a lot, those ones were just the easiest for me, mostly because they didn‚Äôt require the camera and I had the prereqs for them
---
I did the same thing with a settlement that had cats outside. Left the cat in the entrance hallway in a bag with some salt. Yeah, the owner entered the house after seeing me with the gift emote, and started shooting me after realising what I did.
---
I'm a dog person anyway.
---
1,025% of this.  I have been tempted to trade some of my rare stuff on the trade subs to get my perfect weapon.  But then what?  What keeps me playing the game when I have all the stuff I want.  
---
Right now all that is keeping me playing is the weapon hunt.
---
If you think something will be squashed that you think is an important topic that hasn‚Äôt been discussed you can always contact the mods ahead of time.
---
You can also submit feedback directly on Bethesda.net
---
Please tell me she‚Äôs not more annoying than Beckett. I‚Äôm almost done with Beckett‚Äôs quest line and I can‚Äôt wait to not hear the same lines over and over again.
---
Thanks for the clarification and additional info on the bug! It's really annoying!
---
No, I mean after Tadpole there are other ranks or something?
---
It sounds like perhaps you loaded in at the end of the encounter , I‚Äôve experienced this before . It‚Äôs as if you were not fully loaded yet your ammo is still used , it Sucks Donkey Balls
---
I put an eyepatch on him and all of his clothes disappeared.
---
I can't...  I just can't.
---
Happens to me also that (randomly?!) my weapons loose their "favourite" status. It's not all at once (i only have 3 weapons on me), but i can guarantee that at least one weapon gets removed from "Favourites" every time i logon / switch servers.
---
Meanwhile i just solo it using chinese stealth suit, and a mountain of stimpacks.
---
Sounds about right. I have never seen a "fan base"(if you can call those people that) Like Fallout. When Fallout 4 came out there was a huge group of people that were actively putting spoilers for it all over reddit for about 2 months leading up to the games release. I have never seen that happen to a game before or since.
---
I dressed the Raider Punk in a space suit, bottlecap glasses and a tinfoil hat. Suits him nicely.
---
Main problem with the messenger is like many of the original event quest is it feels completely pointless from a lore and immersion stand point. Like "great I helped the robot do something pointless again" at least have it deliver supply's to a npc so I feel like I'm making a "difference".
---
Oh, yeah. There‚Äôs possum after that for backpack mods
---
It's happening to me as well, every day except some lucky days.
---
-How to complete Radiation Rumble
---
-Buy all the Event exclusive rewards from another player &amp; never play the event again.
---
I read the requirements for each badge though and I honestly feel like doing those challenges would take longer than doing the dailies
---
Can't find many for strangler either, I wish they all were compatible with just any PA
---
Iv tried that but I want to sprint!
---
I allways go collect ore if theres atleast 2 people top side. The problem is most people cant actually defend the scavengers. And these days Im encumbered because I play this game 2 much and the daily scrip limit screws me over, making all of thid more difficult than it has 2 be.
---
Works with any explosive shotgun as well. Without any damage perks the explosions only do 1 damage each. And if you just pepper the ground next to the ghouls it'll cripple then very fast. And the ghouls will still have some 95% health so even the NPCs will take a long time to kill them. 
---
Be prepared for the random other player who will kill any ghoul on sight even though you've explained over voice chat to not kill the crippled ghouls.
---
it's a shitty game for doing bets though, once you know how to play the one that goes first always wins or ties if the other one also knows it
---
Aarrgghh and I killed a Mirelurk Queen with just me pistol.
---
I've had the same observation about her focusing on an individual. She regularly focuses on me and I'm always on ground. I've seen her focus on someone standing on the fence or a FO1st tent, but she doesn't land to attack them. She hovers and eventually loses interest and focuses on someone else.
---
gmaat3. This is the same as my PSN.
---
Here is a video clip of the bug in action. You can see at the end the Fat Man‚Äôs durability has gone down even though o used the MIRV
---

---
Check the notice board at a train station and they'll start all the quests you need.
---
I build my camp for me, I lock all kinds of stuff. If I want someone in their I'll unlock it. Not seeking approval or compliments, just pretending to live in a digital wasteland , being cheerful and friendly is bad for my immersion.
---
Anyone on PC add me to play some tic tac toe IGN AlexVillalobos
---
They a pain as well?
---
I'm still waiting for the skull and crossbones backpack that was data mined a month after the game first came out.
---
I have an open-back second story so people can marsupial jump in if they really want to... perhaps some of those designs, like mine, are purposeful so randoms don't leave the front door wide open.
---
As in, player icons next to their names (e.g vaultboy)? A lot of the nuclear winter ones are bugged and invisible but beyond that idk
---
I took me a couple of days to get the tadpole badges AND the possum badges.
---
I‚Äôve done it on 3 of my 4 characters and it‚Äôs not difficult if you choose your route wisely .. on one character I got 14 possum badges over a weekend...
---
Yeah, I've not really bothered. But it is something I want to take up more of.
---
It‚Äôs atom shop duh
---
After your store is full of items to sell, I leave my character AFK at my camp and hope to wake up to some extra caps lol. I forget to take off my auto stimpak perks sometimes so I also wake up to no meds.
---
Yeah that's what I meant ,the icons you can buy in Atomic Shop that are next to your name.
---
I don't like the idea of removing the vats grenade thing unless they add some way you can cook the grenades 
---
As an explosive build, NW is the only time I feel like I'm remotely a threat lol
---
Yup, though you can thankfully have a chance to earn them when you do some of the Scout‚Äôs events/dailies/repeatables.
---
Hahaha man, welcome to the apocolypse
---
Because reddit is filled with the sort of person who can't play anything but the optimal build, then bitch because nothing else can compare that that optimal build and thus is absolute trash. Meanwhile there's the other folks, who just want to stomp around in our own tiny mecha bashing giant mutant bats in the face. And if it means that those bats fall 30s slower, that's okay, because I'm enjoying the stomping.
---
Aight cool. Thanks.
---
Crippling her wings used to keep her down, but since wastelanders that's no longer the case. Bethesda has said it's a bug, but the data-miners have apparently discovered that it was a specifically coded change. It could be a change that they never intended to publish, but I would think they would have reverted it by now if that were the case.
---
Ah that blows. I've used the PA but forgot to check how much I was getting each time. Thanks for clarifying.
---
We are all clueless dongle Sith Lords.
---
Dont build chairs, beds or anything at all that can be interacted with. If you can see the prompt to interact with an item through a window, you can get inside.
---
It's amazing how many people leave a way into a locked camp.
---
adding you
---
Doing the dailies once is a requirement for the tadpole quest anyway,  I did herpetologist, athlete and archery and it took about an hour
---
Props to you for doing a proper job recording details. This is the kind of report that might actually get a result, instead of "My Fatman is broke and breaks when I use the other one, bethesda fix it".
---
I‚Äôm pretty new, so I locked mine as I wasn‚Äôt sure if people can steal my shit or not lol. I don‚Äôt want my precious bobby heads disappearing! 
---
If they can‚Äôt however, then I‚Äôll whap those locks off this evening. Come on in lads, I‚Äôve got warm beer and no chicks but you can look at my Fatman if you want...
---
You were grouped with someone who did over 10k damage or your full of it.
---
K so 10k hours in fallouts was a 76 preorder rage quit from the shitshow that it was and just came back due to my kid.
---
Don't worry about your start for 1 you don't unlock good weps till 50 plus you don't unlock good camp plans till after you do workshop events basicly your first character will be a throw away story toon.
---
You won't enjoy the game if you worry about min maxing on your first character, best advice I can give you right off the bat is this do one story playthrough anyway you want. Then go back and plan out a build and you can go in with a plan and a method.
---
JPIII vibes...
---
still here. wanna join my world?
---
I also like how Blackeye will give you stuff as a way of saying thanks. 
---
The last time that I visited her she gave me a bunch of cooked Mirelurk meat.
---
I just want people to stop killing my brahmin. Brahmin number 47..
---
Naked pirate. Oh well...
---
Things tend to cycle every few months, at least as far as CAMP stuff. Save up (it was 1200 caps, if I recall), because it is the best bundle ever if you want something less "I hammered a nail through some wood"
---
Go to the deep
---
Scrap the armor, sell the ammo. One cap more than what it would sell to a bot for.
---
Try the market subreddit. They sells for worthy trades (godrolled weapons, legacies).
---
The bear rug is fairly cheap from the huntmaster trader. He's in whitespring next to the bos bot.
---
OK thanks
---
The deep or watoga emergency services.
---
Exactly. I can‚Äôt even load into castle but that‚Äôs because of the unlimited space mod. We should at the very least have the same amount or close to it as settlements
---
I make a killing from selling fusion cores so it's fine by me
---
The plan your after can be bought from robot vendors, try Charleston station I‚Äôve seen it there..
---
The game was literally a slapped together asset flip of fallout 4 with tacked on multiplayer to turn it into a FO4 with coop/multiplayer survival lite PvP game. It's not an MMORPG whatsoever and it was never trying to be so yeah it never will have meaningful endgame because the entire core of the game is fundamentally broken. It's a co-op game that does co-op poorly and only recently even got NPC's and the ability to have a semi decent story or living world. 
---
The game's just a purely monetization driven clusterfluff meant to tick all the boxes while succeeding at none of them.
---
Based on what I've read, enemies only continue to spawn if they continue to die. So you just cripple their legs and all they can do is crawl around and not really be a threat to anything. You can also block doorways to the NPCs with Power Armor for added safety. I'm pretty sure this is the safest way to do that event.
---
Prime Gatling laser with just one of the broken legendary effects being used to hit her for just 20-39 seconds is enough todo 10k damage and get rewards, regardless of spec.
---
You need to make sure it has one of junkies,instigating,medics,stalker, or one of the sub leg effects, limb damage, vats hit chance, or bashing damage.
---
Those mods on anything with a fire rate over 200 should melt shit fast.
---
Oh, she‚Äôs *way* more annoying than Beckett. The least annoying one is Raider Punk, and even then I can only tolerate him in my camp for a few days at a time.
---
It located outside of white spring golf. If u didn‚Äôt know about the exact location, u can find it on youtube, that‚Äôs easy
---
Games broken and full of griefers and cheaters, so yes it is.
---
Yeah, that's because they're using bugged ("magic") weapons to quickly bring the queen down.
---
Energy weapons as a whole DO suck, it's just that a certain combination of legendary effects on weapons with ~200 fire rate causes them to do absolutely outsized (read: bugged) damage.
---
While it's true that people could use these bugged guns during other times, SBQ is basically the only enemy with enough HP/damage reduction where it is significantly different.
---
I guess everybody with a shop has this kind of problem: OOOh shit, i'm near max cap, hopefully nobody buys (To be honest, that's surreal...i want to sell stuff and make money lol).
---
Well, i fixed that "sell" problem by putting my vendors into a garage, put a switch on the door (to open/close it) and a switch between my vendor machines (so i can turn them on/off). I put that switch somewhere where Players could hardly acces/find it).
---
So, when i know that i will hit the cap where IF i would sell my most valuable item i would loose money, i go to my camp, close the garage door, cut the power from the switch and then turn off my vendors with "other" switch.... problem solved :D
---
But yea, we shouldn't do this... no no no .. we should get a cap limit that is high enough  ... that's it. What's the purpose of a vendor when i can't sell anything? ... and, there are not enough ways (besides vendor grinding, -which sometimes also sucks after a few hours) to sink your gold into (in a meaningful manner). Ok, once a week i can spend 6k caps on gold. But let's be honest.. 6k? That's nothing ...

Lol I can‚Äôt believe people still play this, it‚Äôs literally a chore to play the game
---
I don't trade, I dont trust people to be honest, including "verified" third parties. That and I don't have any god rolls or legacies anyway. If I got one, I'd be using it instead of the junk I have currently. Now if Bethesda made a real trade system where both parties had to accept the trade before it could be completed, I'd be happy to trade.
---
I think these season passes to the loot based games is just a way to insert a illusion of activities to the people at endgame. The Division 2 and Destiny 2(not sure about this thou) for example. I don't think that those seasons were made a new player in mind, but a player that is in endgame grind.
---
Season passes to these games are just a cheap and lazy way to ad (endgame) content to the games that are already struggling with the endgame. Now 76 just follows that road.
---
You‚Äôre making a great point. Brahmin can be revived! So why not Mega Sloths! üí™üèº
---
It‚Äôs pvp on a single player game speedily and badly retrofitted for multiplayer.
---
Do not expect good things from something that started like that, even if they actually had good devs.
---
The vast majority of people in my experience have voice chat turned off. For good reason. So no that doesn't work. Text chat will ALWAYS be superior in every way imaginable.
---
Then u should meet 6 high level liberators there, on the bridge area
---
Is boost mode playing without disc. My PS4 quit playing discs two years ago, so I download all games I play now.
---
thank you very much for the help!
---
Low karma, new account from Bethesda says wut?
---
Garbage
---
‚ÄòPart ash‚Äô?  I‚Äôm not understanding this meaning.
---
And just to add on a less flippant note, I don‚Äôt complain about PA. I use it a lot for its base resistance stats and heavy gun stabilization. Can‚Äôt get optimized enough on a regular armor set for it to keep me alive everywhere I go. I am months away from grinding out SS armor to be able to compare to, so I roll in PA. Many complaints I see are about wanting quality of life improvements made to PA.
---
no problem bud. I still have a shielded harness you modded for me way back when, haha
---
and thanks for the fuel.
---
Shooting her doesn't make a difference. If she aggros someone that is in/on somewhere she can't land she will continue to circle. Fences, tents, tanks and anything else she can't land on will make the queen fight last a lot longer and waste everyone's ammo.
---
assaultron turns you to a pile of ash
---
This right here. The game is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and will never see more than the most basic level of support to ensure money keeps flowing in. The whole game has been designed as one big monetization scheme.
---
Seems she usually focuses on someone with a prime weapon, or someone that does a lot of damage to her and gets her attention.
---
Nah. I have non-magic laser gats and they wreck the queen. I've been at fights where they get used and where they don't... It's never a huge difference.
---
Ah. Makes more sense now.
---
that was my rant about being extra unlucky :\[  
---
gratz anyway, some good stuff there :\]
---
I mean they did it with doom eternal why not fallout
---
Ok that explains it cause i usually run full deep pocketed unyielding so whenever i hop into power armor im very over-encumbered so yeah, i struggle with weight management so i need alot of carryweight
---
I want to know the logic behind the compass showing less info in power armor. No indicator for elevation or distance, but non PA users do? Wtf?
---
Won't happen. That would alienate the solo players too much.
---
Where does it say you have to hit a certain amount of damage to get loot? I would really like to see that
---
according to all the Wiki's its a drop only?, ive cleaned all vendors out of plans over the last few days and i've not seen it
---
There's also the Old Ring found on a bench near the dryer lake bed. It's under a bowler or fedora with a note.
---
My shotgun character does 1500 damage with my BE Double Barrel. I do 1x7 per shot on the queen. I never got loot until I used grenades, Cryolator, and now Gauss shotgun. Endgame needs reworked because I used to cripple the queen and not get loot despite being the only one keeping her on the ground.
---
Why?  How does the game being 99.9% solo-friendly right now not alienate group players?
---
This is a multiplayer game you shouldnt be able to do everything solo.
---
Definitely do events in the forest and ash heap.  I completed my collection of the Responder fireman outfit last night
---
Community managers are useless. They've reported the same things to devs multiple times to no effect. They get paid to do nothing.
---
I tried to do a video, but this monitor runs at 50Hz (Europe)  
---
and it is impossible to film it, because all you can see is a flashing image   
---
on the recording.   
---
My camera does not have manual video exposure timing too bad.
---
I like building near pre existing buildings and integrating them saves a ton of budget for a large build
---
TF the OP making sweeping generalizations? OP comes across pompous and assuming. Point is lost in the condescending overtone of the post. Downvoted for bad quality.
---
Meh. You go on about mutations not being realistic when this is Fallout you‚Äôre talking about. Also, survival would be more of a challenge with people being able to use their builds and all of their gear, not running around with non legendary shit. Survival was fine the way it was before, and a good challenge. If you want PvP with non legendary gear just play NW.
---
This! They put it in game. Why the hell are they still handing out .38 and missiles as a reward?
---
Yeah same, I had the burning red laser effect emitting from my body it looked amazing.
---
Just double the damn budget and everyone would be happy.
---
I'm really tanky without power armor. I already take almost no damage from Scorchbeasts and am just using armor I have found along the way. Things that ignore armor can still murder me in 4 or 5 hits. I pop on my power armor for Scorched Earth or when I want the extra heavy weapon damage. I would probably use it more if I didn't have to see that landing animation so often when having the marsupial mutation.
---
I believe I was there with you for the 3x and everyone just sitting around doing fuckall
---
Troubleshooter armor for the win.
---
&gt;The people that wear it all the time, I liken to dudes that drive around in giant lifted trucks that are never off road or used for work... compensation
---
Is it possible that they just like Power Armor?
---
Yeah but then lots of people do play the game solo and Daddy Todd promised that "You can enjoy the game solo" and it's a fallout game which is a solo player series and Bethesda's all about trying to please every single player group with the game. So yeah adding in significant group content that can ONLY be completed in groups probably won't happen because it'll piss off the solo players. 
---
Don't get me wrong I don't disagree with you, just looking at it from Bethesda's point of view. The games an MVP after all so it's no surprise.
---
i actually use chinese stealth armor. really great, but the low defense annoys me
---
I just shoot them in the guts.
---
Nah, he annoys the living shit out of me too. He‚Äôs always talking about how much work he put into building the place (didn‚Äôt lift a finger to help) and tells me he found my house first. Bitch?!?!!?
---
China.
---
Most of what you are saying is not true.   I have successfully completed all of those quests many times. And yes, I have failed them too, but guess what?  That is in the nature of hard events. That's why they're called hard.
---
Defenders of the Vault 94 raids continually ignore how  laggy and unstable this game's servers are, because ***that is the only possible way that you can defend vault 94 raids.***  An event like the Vault raids is simply not sustainable if the  servers are laggy and unstable. Period. Because the servers are so laggy and unstable, the failure of Vault 94 was inevitbae.
---
It has nothing to do with the player base's lack of skill or the usual bullshit I hear.
---
I tend to go overboard with things. I save all those pictures to a digital photo frame. I get the whole 18 month experience in pictures all day :) and just the latest 50 as load screens.
---
Hey, someone's going to blame you for "not playing the event right" anyway. You do you, man. Be happy.
---
Well to be fair I was fighting a wolf then I extremely high level player purposely walked in front of the wolf so he could kill me.  That didn't happen in any of the other fallout games.
---
*insert surprised pikachu* Bitch.
---
He's still a piece of shit
---
Oh this trader often appears at the tents right next door to my camp, so I've managed to snag several outfits, since I often need to spend caps. Then I turn around and sell them for more. So I guess I'm not really spending caps...
---
:(
---
Yeah there are side quests and such. However, end game is more of a grind for weapons and armour really. Preparing for the next big update.
---
Right... because Bloodied builds make the game more challenging than basic gear.  Seems legit.üôÑ
---
* *gets popcorn* *
---
* *pulls up a chair* *
---
Because this game is 99% faceroll, so it doesn't really matter if you use something that's not meta.
---
I use chainsaws all the time.  I won't pretend like they're not trash but I don't need to be min/maxed to perfection to kill a fucking mirelurk.
---
True, and I'd support that as well. However Bethesda seems to be on a war path to reinvent the wheel in the most drawn out complicated way possible.
---
Check your misc item tab , somehow accidentally picked up an extra one of his quest items, you will know it when you see it.
---
Dude, you ever raid in WOW or EQ2? Fucking people stand in pools, can't joust or even activate 4 switches in the right order. It's funny sure, but really sad to when everyone knows the strats, but still can't pull it off.
---
Somewhat related:  Are assultrons immune to nukes?  I unloaded about 5 on one, at the feet, around it for splash damage, and one right in the freaking face and its health did not move one single bit.
---
Can the event beCompleted solo?
---
end....game? You do realize this is an open ended game which they plan to release continuous content for years to come?
---
Not being able to sprint or attack after using the Gauss Shotgun.
---
&gt;release non-battle royale pvp games
---
id love/play the shit out of an infection mode. it even easily fits in the fallout theme, ghouls vs survivors:  once a survivor takes enough damage/rads, they are now a ghoul.
---
Oh.
---
First of all, you're asking about *Tadpole* Badges, not Possum Badges.  To get the Standard Backpack plan, you need to get tree of those badges.  For the mods, you need to get Possum Badges.  The Dailies and Campfire Tales do *not* drop Tadpole Badges, and are actually of dubious value until you become a Possum Scout.
---
The Tadpole Badges aren't too hard to get.  I usually go for Athlete, Herpetology, and Swimming.  The Swimming one is easy except for the requirement to "revive a friend in water."  You need to coordinate that with someone.
---
Barring that, other popular ones are Archery and Mammology.
---
Grinding. Perfecting your gear and build. A bit more grinding.
---
Make it so that we gotta give them a golden Apple.
---
My wife, at level 20 with a regular handmade put about 100 rounds in her and was able to loot her
---
Always wondered why we don‚Äôt have anything to do that‚Äôs a long wave based repeatable dungeon? Would be fun as - like a wave after wave basis that can‚Äôt be finished or finished at a very high wave, if you get there you get a random mystery reward same as Fasnacht but only 3 stars or higher you go the better reward you could gain like a scoreboard type function that lets you travel higher and higher in the ranks until you die. Would act as an ammo dump for players with insane amounts of ammo and a tester for builds/time waster in the same motion. Something is definitely needed man feels like I‚Äôm at work doing these dailies and limited scrip sink.
---
Agree, no more legendary items, however, yes on mutations - it's quintessentially Fallout
---
This will be an interesting topic.  Sure you have BC.  But what about those looking to buy it for the next gen.  Will there be graphical improvements?
---
Also begs the question will they allow cross account purchases/progress to be opened up? As a PC player moved from Xbox, I'd love my old PA , progress and skins.  
---
.
---
I was gonna ask why you list one of the most easy to counter and kill builds in the game then I saw you‚Äôre a console pleb. 
---
And yes, it‚Äôs more of a challenge going against tuned builds and having a risk. I mean, who knows what gear and build your enemy may be rocking! 
---
People tune their builds for maximum effectiveness in PvP. If PvPers wanted to fight without legendary gear, they can play NW or set up matches. Survival was the perfect mode for people to show off their build and gear, and that‚Äôs what made it fun. 
---
Can‚Äôt tell you how much I improved thanks to survival. Started off as a foodie and I‚Äôve come a long way.
---
This is something that is not likely to change due to the way the Creation Engine loads data. It loads the ESM (base game), followed by plug-ins (DLC), and then any user-created plugins (player characters, camps). This order of operations has been in place since Morrowind.
---
Also regarding laser gatlings - if you combine batteries inc (90% weight reduction for energy ammo  including cores) with power user (cores last twice as long) then you get 1000rnds out of a single power core.
---
Given how readily available cores are (missions give them, they're laying around, PA suits have half used cores, and you can spin up a power plant to craft 3 every 20 mins for nothing) its essentially no hassle free ammo.
---
Theres no real rush to do the SBQ, so some of us just get out the free ammo gun and hold down the trigger and enjoy the light show
---
How is the game supposed to know the spot is taken before you even connect to check it?
---
Hey 76! Learn to pick a side
---
That's because the fat man is a terrible weapon in this game
---
Operation tiddy?
---
I've just experienced the exact same bug on my PS4. I dunno about you, but the one bellhop dropped me was a legandary variant? Put it on my rack thinking it looks cool... Came to load in today, and it was just a regular revolver... But still had the word "fancy" in its title. Renamed it, and changed it back to default and the fancy word reappeared.  Just not the skin lol
---
Emmett Mountain Hazmat Suit, it‚Äôs the one that you see all the npc wearing at the event
---
When wastelanders came , the first couple weeks , possum badges where dropping like crazy. They quickly put a cork in it, I used to farm the badges , did it since they came out, stings and things, operation tidy, every day. Big dupe wave a couple months ago, the dupers ran me out of business, drove prices for those plans down by giving them away.
---
Not everyone feels the need to show off. I design my places for me, not for attention. Add on that monsters can get in and wreck up your stuff, and some players think it's fun to destroy other people's camps (and I don't want to ruin my aesthetic by cramming a bunch of turrets into my living room), and it's just easier to have a public area with stash box &amp; crafting benches, and keep most of my decorations behind locked, guarded doors.
---
2 charged up shots with a bloodied gauss rifle and I'm guaranteed loot from the queen lol
---
I like to give away grape mentats. If you buy from my shop, I usually try to show up and give you a bonus too.  Had a player give me 25 super stimpaks back when I was low level and it helped me get to 20th lvl.  So I try to pay it forward.
---
Idk why they don‚Äôt just use private test servers to test increasing the budget. It seems like a fairly easy thing to do and it would make everybody happy
---
Abbreviate. My 3 Star Unyielding Secret Service Armor Left Arm with +1 Intelligence and junk reductions I do as ***UN SS LA +Int/Jnk. (Thanks AngryTurtle!) Always sorts to the top, I know the Stars and Legendary Effects and location/piece at a glance and off I go! I agree having to abbreviate is a pain and having the long names is easier, but as always, only a suggestion! :)
---
Edits: Horrendous typos.
---
So you're telling me the one time rng was in my favour was for the f*ing bladed commy whacker plan lol
---
That's actually good odds for those.
---
Since level 60, I've been giving random bags of building supplies, pure water, ammo, and non perishable food to anyone under level 10. It helps them survive and it clears up inventory space for me.
---
Apparently so :D
---
Is there a Mega Sloth backpack already ?
---
Trial and error.
---
the plan is in the overseers chest with the holotape
---
It‚Äôs inside the overseers cache in the terminal but yea basically. 
---
As others have stated go to any train station to read the 3 posters there for new questlines that will allow you to brew alcohol, get standard backpack, and the sheepsquatch questline.
---
That‚Äôs really nice of you! I‚Äôm on PS4 sadly.
---
Tyvm.
---
I thought this was going to be about the player base and came here expecting to see totally different comments...
---
With your suggestions i breezed through basic using marsupial serum. And bonus is ive made most of the caps back selling the serum. Thanks again people i can finally nuke stuff. Well soon.
---
Player clicks play - client notifies server that Player wishes to join server, their camp is at x,y,z their tent is at x,y,z and to reserve those locations if not taken - server responds these spot are available, client precedes to join.
---
This is all done on the backend, user does not have exposure to this process. It is not a complex programming challenge to address.
---
You're such a jerk
---
The same complaints found here are also found on steam forums. And to answer OPs question it's a really subjective matter. When i played a lot i rarely found people in PA. 
---
Even now during queen kills maybe 2-3 people are in PA the rest are in chinese armor or outside nuke zone during kill.
---
Bruuuh, I just farm off the ghouls for my caps n EXP lmaooo, then fail
---
I keep my whole house open to anyone that wants to come inside and see my decor. Water purifier is unlocked, and people are free to take anything from my rooftop garden. Plus they have to go all the way through it to find my benches and that conveniently takes them past my shops ; )
---
Only things I have locked up are my collectron station on the roof, and my ammo machine, which is behind a passcode door because my friends kept taking from it.
---
When I fire a bow( I'm a typical right handed person) I hold the bow in my left hand , draw to fire with my right.
---
Fashnaught you would occasionally hear people surprised that they failed. Why? Oneryone dogpiles on the sloth and ignores the wolves and insects, or in one case everyone went to the area around the bookstore and let supermutant suiciders in from the street side buildings
---
Now that‚Äôs a good scam. Steal the item, tell award sure, you‚Äôll find his item! Here it is! He goes back to bed and you put it back in your pocket...
---
I got stuck pink once from a flatwoods monster attack
---
You‚Äôll also want to claim and build the free personal terminal from the atomic shop and go through all the menus on it for a few additional little quests including getting the functional pro snap deluxe camera (investigate suspicious person).
---
Hundreds of queens, and nothing good. Hundreds of events with no outfits. But at least I go my bladed commy whacker. That I in no way at all farmed for. 1k hours in and that's the only rare thing that's dropped for me lol. Got to love it, really though. I do truly enjoy the game
---
On my main (heavy/demo), I pretty much only use PA during scorch events or when fighting scorchbeasts.  If I'm in PA, it's because I want to use the stabilized perk for armor piercing with heavy weapons or for protection against that green mist stuff.  Other than those two advantages, I'm gimped in pretty much every other way while wearing it...  Lower specials, less carrying capacity, less general survivability, etc.  The vast majority of playtime on that character is spent outside of PA.  
---
My alt (stealth sniper), has no need for PA.  Both characters are bloodied, BTW.
---
Preaching to the choir here. I've been maining a laser gat for quite awhile now, and my fusion core supply has been steadily increasing over time without an extra effort on my part.
---
Actually you're right, on top of all the game breaking bugs, they still have non-game breaking bugs
---
Ty
---
Yeah, definitely gonna be hard to find people to do the 94 raid with. Let alone grind it. I have 1 good friend who plays this game and he‚Äôs made it to lvl 30 in the same time Ive made it to lvl 90. 
---
I‚Äôve yet to see a nuke dropped on that mine up north that causes the windigo event (only know if it from YouTube).
---
And even with the scorched earth event, 30% of the time people start leaving because the thing isn‚Äôt dying fast enough. Pretty annoying lol. 
---
I do get it though, there‚Äôs ALOT of players that clearly are not ‚Äúgamers‚Äù, which is honestly one of the things I love most about this game. But goddamn, is it funny observing some people. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see what these expeditions are. Feel like I hopped in at a good time with the seasons and all that around the corner. Wish I was there from the beginning for all the legacies though...
---
Yep.
---
You're going to hear a lot of stuff, probably some/most/all negative, but the truth of the matter is that it takes a ton of hours to get through all of the quests, events, etc.  Once you finish everything, there is not a ton to do outside of your dailies, working on your house, farming materials, trying new builds, or PvP (I happen to really like NW).  Just don't expect some epic end game where you are running high level raids like in other online-only games.
---
Not sure if you can layer them, but if you make the grid large enough you should be able to put the X's and O's side by side in each square.
---
I agree ... But that isn't the issue here? There is a (presumably arbitrary) limit to the number of items you can rename. i found that limit. When I've got over my chagrin I'll have a count up.
---
I think if we had no dupes and restarted a character legendarys aren't so bad. The odds of getting a bloody handmade from even the purveryer is like 1/500 or something dumb like that so some would have good weapons some would have good armor, but without dupes everyone would be roughing it.
---
Im not an expert so idk for sure, but I heard (Maybe from Juicehead? Idk) that the way components are stored as data, it would take basically the same amount of performance to store one of each component as storing thousands of each. So the scrap box should just be free to everyone and if what I heard is correct, there would be no performance issues
---
What happens then if the camp location is taken on all the existing servers? Are we supposed to just loop infinitely, do we establish a new server? If its the latter, how many servers do you stand up before you say ‚Äúno, sorry, we have enough servers‚Äù
---
What that was is God mode  happened to me a while ago
---
You triggered a scorch beast queen like event. Sadly the game does a terrible job at letting the player know this. But hey if you guys completed it then awesome, this event has a fairly decent chance of failing.
---
The gist of the event is in order for the sheepsquatch to go die you need to activate 3 pylons around the area. The catch is that each of these pylons drains your health. If you activate more than  one yourself your health drains even faster. 
---
Also the sheepsquatch hits like a truck.
---
I have never used stabilized. Is it really that good? I havent had too many issues but maybe it's because I use gatling guns and energy heavies?
---
I think adding the purveyors mystery pick loot pool to all events would really help. Also awarding some scrip each completed event would as well.
---
Probably wouldn't hurt to start adding new rewards to old events. Like re-skin a new leather coat and make it a 2pct drop chance from savage divide events. 
---
This would shake things up and increase attendance by a lot.
---
If they automatically gave everyone in the event the kill loot, it would be even worse than now. 
---
No one would do anything. Everyone would find a corner and wait for others to complete the event so they can just scoop the loot without even wasting any ammo.
---
pvp does not equal nw and thinking that says that youve never played a survival game with pvp..
---
I have to agree, at least let me get something that makes sense. Ammo from the raiders and repair kits from Foundation, not just random crap. At least it's better than BOS and their magic mailbox that gives 3 rounds and a water.
---
They are one of the most common in player vending though. I know I just put a whole bunch in mine last night for 20 caps each, jet pack and all that crap.
---
I bae over 200. And ive been wondering how come i still have them. Now i know. I figured i would be able to dump all at once. But i guess thats not going to happen any time soon
---
It'll instantly go to level 4 completion if you deposit 100 ore. You wait to deposit it because at level 2 when the floaters spawn. They can hit the scavengers from range and in my experience the 2 scavs out in the open of the main room will die very fast to floaters.
---
believe the cap is at 50 - that‚Äôs a lot of custom names to keep in data per character, per player.  So I can understand a need for a cap.
---
LOL. The exact same thing happened to me at Level 40. I had NO idea what I was getting into. Thankfully it seemed to trigger an event that drew people in or I would have never completed it. I look for it to pop up now so I can ‚Äúhelp‚Äù anyone doing the same as we did.
---
Lol you went and picked a fight with one of the baddest S.O.B.s in the game haha.  Definitely a rough event, we like to do it here and there.
---
If you're on PS4 , I have a PA garage on one of my characters.
---
Definitely wouldn't be able to get the same person to bet on it that many times but personally if I run into wasteland tic tac toe I'm absolutely gonna bet a couple thousand caps on a couple games just for the memory and to say I did haha
---
Skyrim people occasionally got stuck in that one early dungeon because they Did not realize they had to look at the carving. Hell even Oxhorn thought all of the references to 8 was a street address elsewhere in the game and not the passcode to the assault tron room
---
I "close my shop" when I hit my cap limit so the vendors are inaccessible.
---
I use excavator PA because I want the insane carry capacity.
---
Someone (\~lvl 140) did this for me (lvl 24) the other day  and it was super cool. They bought something at my camp then dropped a bunch of plans for me. I have no use for any of the plans, but the thought was awesome.
---
To be fair, NW IS PvP. I cringe when people tell PvPers to go to NW, but it is PvP. It‚Äôs not fun at all, but still. Go ahead and make your assumption, I couldn‚Äôt care less what some mouth breather on Reddit thinks :p
---
Survival the way it was before the ridiculous nerfs was a real challenge, sorry that you and the other foodies can‚Äôt see that, and instead complain because they couldn‚Äôt farm XP without dying :(
---
PVP as a whole was a failed experiment.  The vast majority of players had no interested in the ‚Äúlittle bit of player drama‚Äù and had no interest in any PVP.  It‚Äôs highly unlikely they are going to allocate resources to recreate a new PVP mode.
---
They are until you find a trap camp and  they steal your FUCKING PUMPKIN SEEDS
---
Gotcha, I guess that's about what I expected. In other online games it's usually PvP/cosmetics grinding that keeps me in the game. I enjoy the gather/scraping/crafting cycle of this game so far, so if there is neat stuff to work towards crafting/obtaining after level cap then that's probably good enough for me.
---
Nope, that would be nice to. Could be a normal looking backpack with a little sloth hanging on to it.
---
the limit is 50 but there seems to be a problem that permanently reduces this. source, i can literally only rename 45 items and i dont know why, and only for one of my characters
---
If you can blueprint everything but the foundation. You can place the foundations manually at your new spot then snap your blueprint onto them. This will make it a lot less buggy trying to place blueprints structures.
---
All that workbench and vendor stuff is just a lure so I can watch you from my secret underground base, crouched, and laughing.
---
AAAAH HAA HAA HAAA
---
I put my Vendor inside my camp for this reason. Anyone who wants to shop must see my very blatant Faschnact obsessive insanity and display cases full of non-irradiated Fancy Lads Snack Cakes.
---
we do this all the time with a team of 3 or more. we have one person and one end, and another at the other end.  
---
the other person is the runner, they collect 10 from each area for a total of 40.   
---
they then guard and the next person does it. then the 3rd person then does the collecting they only need to get 20 as you should have 100 at this point.    
---
then you deposit it all at once. and guess what your done.
---
I've got a free vending machine full of all the ammo that I'm never going to use. I would be so so happy to find extra adhesive instead.
---
End game involves grieving other players. Trap bases, launching nukes at highly populated/clusters of camp sites, nuka mining AFK players and claiming other people‚Äôs workshops.
---
You wont be saying that when they release the Ammo Converter for your camp. Lol
---
I had that bug for awhile. It was awesome!
---
lmao yes. But it is not much of an issue. Has some sort of gamble since I have to guess the prices.
---
I respect your position on that, I'm very colorblind and would get headaches trying to see in the vault raids, couldn't mess with them. But even I wouldn't want to devalue the work of others , and in that spirit, will never buy any of those plans. It is dirt in the eyes of those that did do the work.
---
\*Level cap. In MMO's its usually considered "end game" once you hit max level. That's not to say its the "end of the game" but more a stage of gameplay. On the contrary a lot of MMO's don't really get going until you hit level cap/end game.
---
One of my teammates ***HATED*** that I did that. I was like MF, you want me to repair pipes or do you want to fail this 40m raid?
---
Holy shit dude ur message gave me cancer, if you knew anything about me youd know ive been fighting forever to get survival the way it was back. Nw is a battle royal and yes technically a pvp. No one is talking about battle royal pvp we want survival pvp
---
I like to sit in stealth, and when someone buys something I play this :
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h7OXlPeMQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h7OXlPeMQI) 
---
Over voice.  Great fun as they try and find me, and the howls of laughter it gets as the clip repeats when people are bulk buying.
---
Nobody has yet found my hiding place :D
---
if you play on PC, i could probably make you a mod that does that.
---
Or - Fasnacht, people so obsessed with getting a hit on the Sloth they just let the wolves and sting-wings through to attack the bots. These were 100-200+ leveled people. I'm sure they really needed a level 20 one star legendary item üôÑ. /s
---
Where's the motorbike, Ghost Rider?
---
I had a tiny city of one-room houses for one camp, it's a lot of bang for the buck.
---
Mr veterinarian for our camps
---
How do you do this? It always snaps to the top for me?
---
Literally 20 pounds of garbage that doesnt even sell or scrap for much.
---
What's sad/great is that, for some folks, you are 100% correct.
---
Get gud.
---
Burrows quest repeatable? News to me
---
It is, that's true. If they hadn't made such long auto names with the "useful bit" at the end then I wouldn't need to rename so many. Here is another example (approximately, from memory) ... Bloodied Marksman's Prime Automatic ... " What? I have handmade and combat rifle that have same first part. Daft example because ammo type is different, but I'm not interested in whether it's marksman or automatic, I just want to know "Bloodied Handmade" or "Bloodied Combat Rifle". Especially awkward in the selection of weapons for the "quick select pad" on XBox, where things like ammo type is not visible, just the list of names.
---
If you plan to use heavy guns, power armor is really important for the stabilized perk. Besides that a well set up unyielding build will usually have better survivability.
---
Color me confused, but in my limited time in this game, I have attempted to login multiple times and been prompted that my 'Camp cannot be placed', and 'would I like to try another shard or pick it up and place it elsewhere at no cost'.
---
Where are these folks at that keep getting logged to a server and having no option to move camp or try another server?  Are you simply clicking past the warning? Or is it something else that I've not seen?
---
I can imagine his thought process "THEY NEVER ADVERTISED DEMONS"
---
In the Mire ... Often get lvl 54 Liberators at my camp
---
And bows. We don't talk about those tho
---
I definitely will check, but it‚Äôs been a month of just handing in the quest without actually collecting the missing equipment I must have picked up a lot!!
---
I only care about their vendors and their work benches. I like the ones that put that stuff front and center.
---
I‚Äôm at 2 badges from 8 events. Fallout 76 players have a love/hate relationship with RNG unfortunately.
---
I use the glitch to please the steel beams on the corners of each foundation I use as a porch, so I can place railings as well. Then I use the flat roofs. It‚Äôs not an ‚Äúawning‚Äù in the literal sense but comes out well.
---
To be fair laser rifles are pretty unloved compared to other weapons imho.
---
Yeah so bring back survival how it was. If OP wants survival back with his suggestions, him and any supporters of this ridiculousness can go play NW.
---
I'm beginning to see that.  Looks like I'll keep it for entertainment purposes.
---
Wasteland dress up, camp building,  legendary farming, and gold bullion.
---
Thats it mostly.
---
Fight her solo on private then in a group there is clearly a difference.
---
bitching on reddit seems to be the meta...
---
There really isnt a max level. Im level 290 but i see level 700-1000's on some servers.
---
Theres a lot of challenges in the world and survival etc etc that are tedious but can be considered 100%-ing this game. 
---
Endgame for me, a player since BETA is trying to finish those, playing with my group as they do their main/side quests, finding all the asylum uniforms, going thru everyones CAMP for legendaries.....dropping legendaries for newer players, finishing my Possum Badges and playing around with builds and perks. And waiting on the new content...ive missed a lot of events (took 8 months off) so i guess finding people who have spare rare outfits
---
I find troubleshooter armor to be the best in the game(other than unyielding for bloodied). I used to have a separate set of armor for silo runs and encrypted. But really it‚Äôs all you need, the only damage you have to end up worrying about are from robots. No need for vanguard or anything else.
---
Did you skip dialogue?
---
there's always nukashine :)
---
I lock my water because it's always empty otherwise and I play casually, so I can't wait around for them to refill. My vendors are full and my prices are good though.
---
Perfect I figured a response like this.  Good it is worth more thought
---
When seeing the face-palming impatience and simple-mindedness of so many players, you'd think that Bethesda would do the one thing that would cater to this kind of mindset and just make a super, simple powerful raid boss with a complex battle arena so that different builds can have their various functions work together to kill it (elevated places with cover for sneak snipers, a level face-to-face with the boss for PA tanks, multiple ways to temporarily stun the monster for high limb damage weaponry/explosives, etc). There could be multiple tunnels that have mob adds coming in for other players to cover for, requiring the tanks to keep the boss' attention and the backline attackers to keep the adds from surrounding the tanks.
---
The main problem with the SBQ is that it's just a big, wide-open space with mob waves where it's just "unga bunga, shoot everything that moves", having no actual role differentiation for players and thus too simple to play around with in various ways.
---
Hell I had that as character limit rather than ITEM limit in my head since you were interested in the Arm bit, thanks for pointing that out. So, yes, that becomes even MORE frustrating when it caps the amount of items you can rename. I see another reply mentions a cap of 50...yuck.
---
Killing SB, flamer kills, and photography at a fissure site are by far the easiest.  I would just do those.
---
Captain noob did a weapon spotlight for a laugh on the bladed commie whacker, so I went out and bought the blade plan.. (which doesn‚Äôt add any dmg btw)try Sutton station or the mart in Watoga. üëçüèº
---
I definately remember buying this mod..
---
The helmet you pick up is not leave 50 but it unlocks the paint skin for the T51b helmet. The idea is that the helmet was created to development testing but the. The bombs dropped and delayed production (permanently :-P)
---
Yeah, I know. But since I play 1st person view, I forget what I'm wearing sometimes.
---
Like real life, I'm more inclined to be leery of the normal looking folk as they can give you a false sense of security.
---
Yeah, Shady Sands is barely 5 years old as of Wastelanders
---
I‚Äôm not gonna say no to increased armor penetration, recoil reduction, and hip fire accuracy. You‚Äôre definitely using the weapons that you‚Äôll notice less of an effect with though.
---
I will try it for 2 weeks and see if you are right that will be 14 attempts
---
I‚Äôll keep hopping all the vendors on each server see if I can find it thanks
---
Does the excavator PA effect the yield of those ores akin to any other ores in the game? I‚Äôve always wondered this.
---
For Adhesive, you could make vegetable starch. Have the plants at your camp. Couple that with the insta fert nade and green thumb and super duper and you should be set.
---
Oh my gosh! I can‚Äôt stop laughing!
---
‚ÄúWelcome to Hell!‚Äù
---
&gt; I just don't get it.
---
I don't get the alternative point of view. I build stuff for myself, not to show it off to other people, other than the fact that my base is really tall and has a wrap around deck on a couple of levels. Even then most people don't go up there since the vendors are on the ground level.
---
Well, we got private servers and people tend to form well coordinated groups that play more complex events. Yes, the majority of the playerbase won't play these events, but the ones who are dedicated enough always will.

The main problems I see here is that all this supposedly "endgame content" is absolutely redundant, the rewards are mediocre at best and do not make you any stronger then you are, and there are no dungeons with a (endless) difficulty slider to ramp up the difficulty at any time to test the group's power in extreme conditions and to push the limits even further.
---
And before implementing all this, Beth really needs to fix gear and build balance, making almost all (if not all) primary legendary affixes a viable choice for endgame builds, while reworking the perks to support these builds, making them even stronger.
---
After that, to accomodate ever-increasing difficulty challenge they'd need to introduce some sort of weapon/armor buff attachments, that you can attach to your gear permanently, boosting the stats (with a drawback of making the gear account-bound afterwards ofc). Attachments, that will have a small chance to drop every once in a while in the infinite difficulty dungeons I wrote about. That will give players a possibility to get truly legendary gear, that they'll be proud to have.
---
My 2c on endgame content.
---
For utility I would get chemist and contractor. Overall though I'd focus on what kind of build you want to do. Pick a weapon type and get all the damage boosting and armor piercing cards for it. Then see what kinda of damage boosting legendary perks you want to build around(bloodied,junkied,armor piercing, etc)
---
That's my only fear... The year long load times.
---
The Ohio River Adventures crew is my favorite.
---
I had gotten a real good mental image of a cultist chasing a terrified vaulter to no avail, then dejectedly walking over to the overseers camp and scrapping a bunch of low level modded weapons.
---
Those are the other casuals we're trying to help educate.
---
I think everything he said is fine except the legendarys. But it should be balanced like nw. No more battle healing and no more pvp vats at least
---
This. After messing around with rugs and conduits and having little success. Moving the shelf around on uneven terrain is so easy and handy
---
Which locations are you finding these deathclaws?
---
Yep! I had renamed useful things like !Gas Mask etc so it's at the top, plus other items I have to scroll to put back on once I remove the gas mask (cosmetics). Also as I have been bloodied for a long time I'm now experimenting with some full health builds and have collected Troubleshooter's and Zealot's armour and weapons. Hence being able to reach that limit of 50.
---
I wish they‚Äôd do it just to shut people up. If it works, fine. If performance tanks, so be it - leave it a week so people get the message and then put it back the way it was.
---
Once I was defending the census bot from floaters and the event ending right as a flamer floater incinerated me
---
The best part of being a melee build! Using the treasury notes and caps from events, literally nothing else
---
No. DR/ER/RR grants diminishing returns, especially when most enemies hit you for 25 damage anyhow.
---
%reduction from Emergency Protocols is the only real damage mitigation PA offers.
---
PA is not bad at all.
---
Most people play as a bloodied build, so PA is useless.
---
However, a heavy guns build non bloodied is absolutely awesome in PA because of the enemy armour reduction and accuracy perks.
---
It happens. If someone leaves and returns to the server the enemies will spawn. 
---
If you or a friend have a private server you can  nuke whitesprings and clear it out over and over again by having a player leave and rejoin to respawn all the mobs.
---
When
---
You're asking too much from the game, you may crash the servers permanently lol
---
Nuke bat. Shoot bat.
---
People just want to kill and fail. Especially the melee people in Power Armor who miss every swing they throw. I can nuke all the ghouls/floaters/snally/deathclaws I want. But if not one goes and gets the ores its a no go and when I go for ores, they can't defend for sh*t!
---
I think that I have given up on this game.  I haven't logged on for over a week, and up to then I had been playing almost every single day since BETA.
---
I think what finally broke me was the announcement that the Colossal Problem and legendary perks would be delayed.   The perks themselves have been criticized, but my real issue with them is the amount of grinding required to fully level up perk cards.  It's ridiculous and a punch in the face.
---
Colossal problem has already been delayed once.  It was supposed to drop with Wastelanders.   In a game desperately in need of end game content, this is inexcusable.
---
I accepted a long delay of Wastelanders with the understanding that once Wastelanders dropped, they would have an existing Framework to build upon would make it easy for new content would roll out on schedule from here on out.
---
It's  pretty clear now that this is not the case.
---
They keep using things like double XP weekends and an extra week of Fasnacht as a get out jail free card, a way of glossing over continual delays for new content. It's kind of insulting.   I think  I have had all I can take, at least for the moment,
---
I am not boycotting out of anger. I am limping away from the game, broken and exhausted.
---
I remember starting out on launch day after the Beta. I have a FT job and responsibilities so I don't have tons of time to play continuously. It was awesome when some people who flew to higher levels quickly came along and dropped stuff for a lower level like me. It's taken me a year and a half to get to Level 151 because I don't get to play as often as others.
---
I generally like to help people out where possible.
---
It's mostly due to people using the Gatling Plasma or an explosive 50 cal machinegun. PA is needed to fulfill the only non-legendary way to gain armor piercing on heavy weapons, so people lugging around heavy duty ordinance kind of have to do so in PA to not lost half their damage output right off the bat.
---
def would play indeed, though if budget allows connect 4 would be better as it's a lot harder to get to the tie level of play and thus allows for a better experience if you meet the same people regularly. Ofc you can be a god in that too but the odds of missing something are decent so it doesn't have that tic tac toe issue
---
Because my precious, that's why! Nobody but ME is able to see the treasures that lie within these walls.
---
Good luck mate!
---
I use it but the effects are not really noticeably anymore. They nerfed it hard with wastelanders and switched the area acid damage and projectile acid damage numbers (by accident) and so projectiles do next to nothing. They were suppose to make its stronger and work faster but not stack like it used to. But again as someone who tested and data mined the damage before and after the numbers were placed back in correctly in addition to being nerfed.
---
I use it because I carry it around anyway for when I need to mine.
---
Otherwise I've been enjoying my stealth suit as it makes hiding from the mean assaultron while I cry easier.
---
Same here, the event failed only once since it was in the nukezone and muties shot the bots instantly. All other 90 parades I attended went just fine.
---
Just one? It's not much really.
---
Well the dungeon is repeatable. The "quest" is pretty much just an introduction to running through to the end anyway. After doing that, you don't have actual objectives but you can repeat the dungeon as often as you like, going through the motions all over again. There's no special reward for it the first time, so doing it over again is the same experience. Granted, I first did it the day it was added so I don't remember the specifics of any objectives beyond getting to the end, but I remember that every time after it felt pretty much the same. It's not so much a quest as a dungeon, and there was nothing about it that stood out as more of a quest than just killing everything in sight and leaving.
---
Yup
---
Because that collection is for my eyes and my eyes only. I have my bobbleheads and magazines complete and I like seeing them myself without interruptions. I have an entire room dedicated to my collection .
---
Skyrim, coming to a pipboy near you.
---
It depends on how much time I can invest, short amount of time I can usually do dailys and maybe  check some vendors, but if I have more time I can do a queen or I'll run westek a few times for some xp
---
Considering how Deathclaws are nuisances at best, that would be more of a benefit than a problem to allow for easy Black Titanium farming (would be an amazingly convenient way to build the higher level Excavator pieces).
---
I'm guilty of such.
---
the first level of my camp is a workshop, I can "open" it since all the walls are garage door (also I'm a PA player, so I need my Iron Man lair).
---
I like to see it as my workshop, and i'm living upstair, sure you can visit my shop and buy or fix stuff, but you wouldn't go in the living area!
---
Same thing happened to me, I had a portable power pack
---
Sometimes looking in from the outside is sometimes part of the beauty.  It's like a diorama.    
---
that's one of the reasons I want glass roofs.
---
Let qui-gons be bygones
---
Got black titanium for days lol dont use it for anything
---
The crashes are what get me. It‚Äôs grindy enough as it is, but sitting through all of the loading screens and an entire match just to blue screen or get disconnected in the final circles is salt in the wound.
---
I don‚Äôt know how you even track the XP, but I‚Äôm just assuming it goes poof if you don‚Äôt make it to the final screen.
---
Deathclaws, the always-talked-about terrors of the wasteland: "Meh, no problem."
---
A Charred Feral Ghoul: "WHOA FUCK! Get that thing away from me!"
---
Oh yeah, but you should equip the Hard Bargain Perk.
---
I currently have about 800 caps, Imma start collecting junk and selling it. Hopefully I can get enough caps to buy it...
---
So... Combat wise T65 is just better?
---
Damn shame.
---
Unfortunate that‚Äôs with the perk equipped... :(
---
Good luck with your collection.  I'm so far away from completing that but enjoying scavenging for items, it's almost a sickness, LOL.  I pick up absolutely everything I see, so I expect I will eventually get them.  Currently I'm focusing on my last 2 bears and a grape nuka cola.
---
Hello! I have some tips for you:
---
1. Loot absolutely *everything* that isn't nailed down. Keep an eye on your carryweight so you don't go over your limit but seriously, loot all the cans, desk fans/typewriters etc you can carry and scrap them!
---
2. When managing power armors keep the pieces on the frame whenever possible. A full set of power armor weighs like 10 lbs this way, but if you remove the individual components you're looking at 50+ lbs of carryweight/stash capacity lost. 
---
3. Look for downed/fallen trees and little bundles of firewood in/near homes or camps and activate/use them for wood scraps. 
---
4. Prioritize the looting and scrapping of duplicate weapons that aren't upgrades, doing so often gives you the plans for mods like scopes, better receivers etc. 
---
5. Don't sleep on the ground (like on the sleeping bags). You can get diseases from that.
---
6. Fallout 76 also has waterborne and airborne diseases (the latter depending on the area), so keep an eye out for gear that prevents them like gas masks, marine helmet etc. 
---
7. There's a cow on the map near Vault 76, go to that location and look for a small watchtower: there's a chance to find the Wanderer NPC there, who can join you at your C.A.M.P. if you build her guitar stand/chair. (note: she can be in other locations but the cow spot is easy to check)
---
8. Build water purifiers as soon as you can - not only is the reliable source of Purified water great for your Thirst meter, but the extra bottles sell well. 
---
9. The Atomic Shop is blasphemous to some, but I'd suggest buying one of the Collectron Protectrons from it. They are an amazing source of scrap/junk, and enemies ignore them.
---
10. Hunt radstag and cook the meat! Grilled Radstag satisfies a big chunk of hunger and more importantly, it gives you a +20 increase to carryweight - anything that makes your bagspace situation better is a godsend.
---
Ah, you're talking about cheesing it, gotcha. IMO it's one of the best events in the game because it's challenging and you get a ton of XP from killing the ghouls. The trick isn't to "just not kill things," the trick is to do it with other people.
---
Definitely ... You can then craft lowest level handmades and scrap them so learn most of the available mods. I currently have 46/47 mods for handmade i believe, the ones you don't get by scrapping I think are night vision scopes and prime receiver (maybe the prime receiver). If you want things like Powerful Automatic, Hardened Receiver, Stabilized or aligned Barrel and stock, silencer etc then that's the easiest way to get them.
---
Yeah I saw one base where the vendors were as far a way as possible and hidden behind some trees and brush. I circled their base area a couple of times trying to figure out where they were at before widening my search radius and finding them eventually.
---
No. Here is a calculator:
---

---
I enjoy the foraging for different ingredients to make chems(formula P sells well), going around taking pictures with the in game camera, and generally role playing as the last survivor of the Helvetian Defense Force.
---
Each day I have a carefully set out plan of personal goals in the game.  
---
Then about 5 minutes after I log in something, be it an event, a camp I want to check on the map, or just not feeling like doing my goals takes over and I spend the time doing what I want.
---
Last night for instance I was looking to get 7 more treasury notes.  Then I decided to move my camp and the next thing I knew I‚Äôd spent 2 hours on that.
---
Are you on Xbox? I can give you some caps
---
&gt; If I can't get in any other way, I'll pick the lock.
---
Doesn't that flag you for PVP?
---
Or if you put on a HazMat suit and everything else comes off... Having renamed all your armor sets makes for easily sorted super fast reapplication. That makes way more sense now ESPECIALLY knowing you're carrying so many. Having just changed my build myself, I wish you luck in finding one that makes the game even more fun!
---
They just need an arena or area that allows mutual pvp. That way people can find eachother and not have to grief or pick on unsuspecting pve players.
---
Cool thanks for the info.  I will check that one out when I find another granade launcher.  I assume it will help since it was advised to use that for the house near Dolces.
---
I've got a quad one and a bloodied one, it'll test them out more thoroughly later on though
---
It's really no different than any other dungeon in the game, ie West Tek.
---
Not sure why they advertised it as otherwise.
---
Oh wow, thanks for the offer! But I‚Äôm on PC :(. Appreciate it anyways!
---
Mine is furious. Idk if that has anything to do with it. With the amount of tiny and odd bugs this game has it wouldn't surprise me.
---
Ah yes exactly ... I have been using the Chinese Stealth Suit and as you say everything comes off including underarmour.
---
I mean, Mirelurks and their queens are giant crabs which are delicious, while the Hunters seem to be lobsters and the Kings are frogs (French taste buds intensify). Eating Mirelurks thus would be like getting a person-sized load of crab meat which would be more expensive than most of the guns pre-war.
---
If you skip dialogue you wont get the rep.
---
Having not modded Gamebryo games much beyond Bridge Commander (which doesn't use the esm/esp system) does the CAMP get counted as a "player created plugin"? Cause if so, holy shit that's just BEGGING to be edited.
---
It didn't crash servers. It crashed clients. Instead of working out a way to protect computers (like the third party mod did) they took the "only tool is a nerf hammer" approach.
---
they're bitching about that feature, they aren't missing it, they are just demanding something the game engine can't do.
---
I have all my heavy gunner cards in for scorched earth, but I'm gonna try against her again later. Cryo crossbow was slowing her on every hit, although not much really. She had the freezing effect on but wasn't slowed that much
---
When I was level 15 I raided New Gad, Wade Airport, and all the junk in Flatwoods and sold it all to get enough for that plan. Then I walked to Watoga, as there was no player vending then. 
---
It was totally worth it. 
---
But you're going to need a bunch of screws so keep that in mind.
---
There is no need to be one so dimensional.   I am level 303 and usually wear my Unyealding to do everything except SBQ and a couple of other events, for that I have my T-65.   I carry a mix set of Troubleshooters and Vanguards as well.  I carry a few weapons and I am set for anything.
---
I honestly don't see it ever leaving beta. I have been grinding for Hellfire since there is nothing left to do in the base game. I think I see the same 25 players over and over. I only am in a full lobby maybe 25 percent of the time. The wait to play varies, and takes way too long typically. I just don't believe outside of a group of maybe 100 players that there is a huge groundswell of interest in the mode. I don't see Bethesda investing energy in a mode where you really don't need anything from the atomic shop and there is only a small player pool.
---
Just because I use power armor doesnt mean it isnt as good. I play what I want regardless.
---
The same thing can happen with the ash effect from lasers and the goo effect from plasma and it's so amazing to witness, my spaceman was all lasered up and glowing like a dark souls baddie and I was very sad when it fixed itself.
---
Why did this get downvoted?
---
The only one that regularly works for me is the grumpy old man, Probably the only thing regular about him. Although maybe not based on his comments.
---
It should be noted that the reason why the Bow is wielded in reversed manner is due to the pip-boy being too bulky to use it properly without getting in the way of the draw string.
---
I try to play as organically as possible, and not obsess over min/maxing anything. Having said that I'm still making that mile long trek through the last division for Ally status for both factions, so that's the only chore I do.
---
If a public event pops up I'll do it for the notes. Other than that it's looking at camps, sprucing up mine, and scrounging around for good scrap. 
---
Doesn't really sound like fun, now that I've written it out, lol.
---
You nailed it. 
---
There's no greater joy than a .50cal Power Armour build with a few card buffs. None of this overly specific mini-max blooded nonsense when more Dakka will do!
---
How do you lay things down in separate containers? I have been trying to do just that for two years now. If I drop one bag of stuff by the door, I can walk way passed all of the vehicles and drop another and it just moves my first bag to me and adds the stuff that I just dropped. I don't know how far that it extends to, but almost halfway to the overseer's C.A.M.P.. Please tell me how to do it! Please?!
---
So,  the query is there, they just want it to cue up before loading the entire server and wasting valuable game time.
---
Got it!
---
Gotcha, I‚Äôm currently raiding the Watoga high school for the caps. I‚Äôll keep in mind the thing about the screws, good looking out! Thanks!
---
I can get past that - it‚Äôs the differences between third and first person that get me you see bows in first person and it‚Äôs angled vs the dorky third person straight pose
---
It changes with what's available. Right now the focus is on getting each character through Wastelanders. After that I'll be finishing ally quests and working up rep for the plans. By then we'll have started the seasons so there will probably be more stuff to do. 
---
If there's nothing else going on, nukes are on the menu.
---
It's great to sell to the vendorbots. No bulking needed and so little of it is actually needed for non-Excavator that its a great caps maker.
---
Nope! I read about that a long time ago so I just sit and let it all play out and even count 1001, 1002 before clicking the "Donate" option.
---
Check outside the blueridge event. There's some that spawns on a shelf by the quest start guy.
---
Pipboy
---
Palace of the winding path,  in the employee only area
---
The Handmade plans are always at Watoga from my experience server hopping it, no need to rush and waste your caps unless you really just want it.
---
My argument for not removing vats grenading is that there is no way to cook grenades 
---
Lemme have SOME control over when the boom goes off after I throw the bomb and I'll be happy, otherwise grenades are gonna go from no counterplay to pointless
---
Especially since the game actually will show enemies that a grenade was thrown and fucking track it with an icon, that's so annoying as a PvP mechanic
---
Just have it sitting in my scrap box occasionally I see post on here and facebook people asking for help with crafting excavator so i usually just give em what they need
---
Certainly 40 hours and then some. Now, if you try to speed-run it then it will take less than 40, but if you listen to the tapes and read the terminals to get the full story then you'll be closer to 60 hours. Not to mention the side quests and missions. Plus just doing events and exploring is several hundred hours worth of fun.
---
I'm slowly losing hope for this game.
---
Even if they do add some great new style of event if the rewards are like they are now it'll just fade away. Nobody cares about 5 rounds of 5.56 and a stimpak.
---
Ah haven't done that in while. Thanks. Who's downvoting this stuff xD
---
F076 Space Marine....Word Bearers, Salamanders, Iron Knights, Blood Angles, Grey fangs, Death Watch....that would be AWESOME....
---
I enjoy stalking new level players through the flat woods forest, take a image of them, send it to them then block themüëçüëÅ
---
Its not that simple. I was using the term as an analogy. To my knowledge, the player data is saved server side.
---
Yeah basically, once I was just chilling at my camp and someone came by and dropped 40 stimpaks and 40 stimpaks:super which was great because I didn‚Äôt have any.
---
Blue ridge event? You talking about riding shotgun? And if so, which tunnel entrance? East or west?
---
stupid idea for an event.. but I really posted to ask the question..
---
why replace a once yearly event? just add another event...
---
It's all fun and games until they drop a nuke mine near your bloodied character.
---
Still worth it
---
Savage lol.
---
Server hop the whitespring resort chem vendor
---
One violent night event also!
---
There‚Äôs how I play the game and how I want to play the game. Right now this is my typical daily activity:
---
* Gather up the purified water and sell to the vendor (I‚Äôll do this a few times to try to get the 1400 daily caps)
---
* Do the 3 daily quests from the factions for gold bullion
---
* Farm someplace such as Fort Defiance for legendaries
---
* occasionally pop into an event (especially scorched earth)
---
What I want to do however is this:
---
* Develop a plan to tackle as many of the 25 daily quests in the most effective/efficient path (such as Fast Travel to 76, go to Morgan town to pick up the quest from Biv, head north towards the toxic valley for those...etc)
---
* Try to group with people more, even if its on my private server, to finish up quests.  I don‚Äôt need too...but I‚Äôd like to. Would be nice to meet Some more players, think this would add to the experience.
---
* Set some goals (depending on which character I‚Äôm playing) and try to do some of the things I haven‚Äôt done yet, like max out the casual underarmor and try to make a nice outfit that doesn‚Äôt rely on a single piece of gear that covers all the other stuff I have.  I bothered to earn the Wastelanders underarmor, gosh darn it I want to wear it.
---
I always take Wards coffee pot so the lazy bastard has to go and ask to borrow one when he wakes up.
---
Sounds fun... I've thought about actually starting to make more stuff to sell. Might have to get some new recipes and try it.
---
I use it because I like it. I like the DR it gives me, and the extra carry weight. I've used it in every FO game since 3 and I'm not stopping now!
---
luckily my life doesnt revolve around fake reddit points.. lol
---
I agree on most of these, but if you want to bring Fireproof into NW, I demand a ‚ÄûBulletproof‚Äú perk that reduces ballistic damage by the same amount. As an adventure heavy I‚Äòm stuck with the heavy weapons in NW and there‚Äôs no way in hell I‚Äòll let you guys shield yourself against half my arsenal without me having a comparable benefit.
---
I would add more to strength üëç
---
Yeah I had one time where everyone was defending super well, but I was the only one who got a large amount of ore. It‚Äôs like, you guys know you have to get the ore too right?
---
Haha yeah that sounds like me.  I like the distractions
---
Do whatever the guy in the wall tells you
---
Strength is max fren
---
Yea! That‚Äôs where I got most of the stuff I‚Äôm gonna use. I‚Äôm just impatient and need 1 more so I just think I‚Äôm gonna buy it if I can find it
---
I think instead of nerfing autos, it would be better to get rid of the single shot damage cap, it's pretty low for PvP
---
Tbh the idea was stupid lol.
---
Copper, lead, steel, plastic scraps.... You know, so we make our own stuff. I don't need handouts. I can make my own!
---
Because fasnacht is over...
---
Replace, verb:
---
replace implies a filling of a place once occupied by something lost, destroyed, or no longer usable or adequate.
---
I want to do encryptid with that guy...
---
Thank you :D
---
This game acts as if it has the same sort of construction of other live service games like Destiny but it has zero depth once you figure out your build and do the story....plus its extremely hard to take seriously with how much broken mechanics there are right now to essentially make you a god and Bethesda hasn't addressed any of these large glitches since launch....you should not be able to solo the queen with weapons that aren't working as intended or have permanent heath regen when you have life giver and speed demon mutations in effect....its ridiculous and people can use their power armor to glitch in areas and farm 3 star legendaries endlessly or skip the entire nuke silo....its become a joke
---
Right now I collect gold and roll my 150 scrip for armor that isn't going to have the right effects so that I can do the same thing again the next day. Then I play something else.
---
Great üëç
---
That‚Äôs the way it goes bud.
---
The no fall damage is sometimes the most fun. Just jumping off the highest building around...just for fun.
---
I haven't done it yet because I didn't want people to yell about me not knowing what to do. It's like the day after project paradise came out and I go in there and immediately someone is yelling about people not doing it right. Like dude calm down it just came out and not everyone can play as much as some other players who have done everything. Thanks for the info though now I can run in there and do it
---
I think it works by tracing enemies movement which releases a toxic gas
---
You can also pay a little attention to the position of your gun. 
---
If you are walking around with the gun in a let's say "relaxed stated" or if you prefer, the muzzle pointed down, just either crouch or switch weapons. This will put the weapon back on your shoulder.
---
Okay im willing to work with that.  Maybe need to make grenades less common along with that or explosion radius nerf?
---
To get the bigger backpack options you‚Äôd have to activate the Tadpole quest and you can do so by reading the posters on any of the train station .
---
I drop, move and drop. Never had that happen to me. I saw someone throwing items on the ground yesterday that wasn‚Äôt even in a bag, just items like you would find in the world. I wanna know how to do that!
---
It's a good way to encourage people to seek high damage cards and weapons. Otherwise you get people showing up with non-specced weapons and doing no damage and the event fails. Is there a better way? Maybe, but this one works pretty good. It *does* suck to show up and use a bunch of ammo, but it is good incentive to improve.
---
Yes every hour üëç
---
I'd get rid of pain train and full charge. Pain train is useless and you should have enough fusion cores to not need full charge
---
Dont you have to turn in the the syringer to complete the quest?
---
Great idea! Upvoted for visibilityüëç
---
Been on for a while now and haven't seen it
---
I didn't even think that was possible. Alone on a private server I can get her to mutate on a single landing, but killing her in the air that quickly in a group setting sounds like an exploit.
---
Yep!!üëç
---
You can actually find a Travelling merchant that sells the bow and all its mod plans, I just server hopped and checked a spot that has random NPC/Merchant there, till I found one. I dont think I even had started any reputation related quests...
---
I agree with all these suggestions. Sounds like a fun game mode and takes away all the overkill
---
At least she didnt fly off to the edge of the map......
---
you just playing via a backwards compatibility. it same same just on like a new computer. nothing has changed for you. if they released a series x version of the same game. it might have its own servers. but the probibility is high they would just run 1 sex of xbox servers. if they released a series x version of the game
---
As long as you're having fun!
---
Great suggestion
---
By the guy you start it. Forget his name. Be east
---
It's random what event will pop next
---
I have no problem with launchers anymore. There are ways to perk against launchers and still run what you want. Many perks work well with each other leading to opened perk slots
---
üòÇ
---
Yes! Got it. Thank you.
---
SH games put out A min maxed bloodied PA heavy build on yt last week adjust to taste.
---
I hate this glitch!
---
Yeah, I couldn't fast travel last night either--not sure what was up there. I didn't experience anything else (outside of normal glitches), though.
---
Ah right must've been in a group. Didn't click
---
I already feel like I get like max 3 grenades per round lol
---
I wouldn't mind a radius nerf but I don't see how that would fix the frustration issue for the receiver of the damage, I think it just adds frustration to the thrower 
---
So now both ppl are annoyed haha
---
Yes! üòÖ

The generals steakhouse has all those plants around back Im pretty sure.
---
You want to elaborate on that?
---
RIP Rufus
---
No.
---
Yeah I find Radiation Rumble much more fun if I'm not cheesing it. If it's just me and my wife in there, sure we cripple them. But if there are a lot of people running around, just let it play out as is.
---
That actually really sucks
---
Hopefully it will be fixed...
---
Agreed there is no need now for me to use my shotty on her because it doesnt make her land from wing damage. I get her to land and agro on me from the DPS I deal her.....

&gt;Lastly, we‚Äôre excited to confirm that the backwards compatibility features are working well. We recently took a look at the top 100 PS4 titles as ranked by play time, and we‚Äôre expecting almost all of them to be playable at launch on PS5. With more than 4000 games published on PS4, we will continue the testing process and expand backwards compatibility coverage over time.
---
Yup. Wish they made pp and rr triggered like encrypted
---
I like wasting three card spots for hacking, expert hacking, and master hacking.  I also love switching cards back and forth like super duper and ammunition.   
---
-said no one ever. 
---
(Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt really waste spots for hacking, picklocking, etc.
---
You may be dehydrated... it‚Äôs a weird bug
---
I'd be fine with a set schedule at this rste
---
Too many utility skills, and you dont have any mutations. I'd run this:

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c64568f&amp;d=sd2so2sp2p02as2l12c72a72a00id2ir2eu0sg2eh2l71lt2lu2cu0pc2a30lr0lv2&amp;m=15c29f3&amp;n=Shotgun%2FHeavy%20PA%20build
---
Wait so are they on a schedule or no?
---
I use Excavator PA because I NEED the insane carry capacity.
---
Without weight reduction legendary effects, backpacks and perks like travelling pharmacy (I need al STR points for damage and weapon/ammo reduction) I literally cannot move in anything but excavator PA. 
---
Powers armors in general need a lot more QOL changes to be comparable in terms of utility. Just making backpacks usable with PA would be a great help.
---
This is the Fallout 76 content we all deserve.
---
&gt;  fasnacht is over
---
correct.. 
---
not lost, destroyed, no longer usable or suddenly inadequate.. it will return again when its time comes..
---
what you want is a new event.. hopefully better than the one you described in the OP..
---
I made a lot of nukashine in my brewer/fermenter.
---
Quite handy when you are overencumbered and want to (try to) get to the other side of the map in a short amount of time.
---
is this on PC?
---
haha don't you love that,
---
He is saying that a random event will pop up every hour
---
That is very very true!
---
And I‚Äôm not saying that you should just come and fire a single round and just wait for reward. 
---
But In theory the game as it is right now is designed to give you corpse rewards either from hitting the enemy or be on someone‚Äôs team that kills it. 
---
I don‚Äôt say this is the best way either. But that‚Äôs how it is atm right? 
---
Am I totally wrong here or what am I getting downvoted like hell for lol.
---
I was just talking about this earlier with a friend. We were planning on doing 3 queen nukes but someone beat us to it. They dropped all 3 one after the other. 
---
Travelled to the site a bit late (thanks fast travel not working 4 times in a row) and missed out on the first, as it was literally over inside 30 seconds every time. 
---
I‚Äôm kinda glad we didn‚Äôt drop the nukes. I was already slightly reticent as it was by far the most high level stacked server I‚Äôve been on in months. There were 10 players over level 300 and one guy was level 900 odd. 
---
I would imagine the vast majority all had ‚Äúmagic‚Äù guns and were all worried they wouldn‚Äôt get damage in because of other users so didn‚Äôt do the etiquette of waiting until first regen before destroying her. Understandable for the guys launching I guess. 
---
I mean it‚Äôd not like they have to wait or not kill it instantly but still. Much more annoying if you‚Äôre the one who did the nuke run so sorry for that. 
---
I will say I‚Äôve been farming queen a lot the last few weeks and that was the first time I didn‚Äôt do the damage. 
---
I will certainly be paying more attention to the levels on the world in future though for my own nuke runs, as I‚Äôve never seen a world so stacked before.
---
Yes my bloodied explosive flamer MELTS through enemies‚Äôn
---
Oh. Ok cool
---
Hey, I just checked and wanted to let you know I was mistaken originally on furious - I was thinking it's 10% per hit but it's actually 5% dmg per hit up to max of 45%. So around 5 hits to equal AA and it caps at 45% so will always be worse than Junkies and only gets comparable after 9 consecutive hits on the same target.
---
Most players are decent humans and r kind but this game does have evil people lol
---
Thanks for the info tho
---
We just stood there and said what happened?? and there wasn't an extended burst of gunfire either so go figure.
---
On PC?
---
Frog legs is only beneficial for gaining height advantage. Watch where they are falling and aim there. On the way down, right when they are about to hit the ground, that's the absolute worse spot for frog legs.
---
Yes you can üòä
---
I can defend solo to the end and kill everything, but obviously not collect the ore at the same time.
---
The ore does not respawn quick enough for one player to max out the ore collection.
---
My advice is if you are solo, just do the kills for experience and let the event fail.
---
*Excavator Calibrated Shocks has entered the chat*
---
Dupers, bro.
---
Try keeping a set of troubleshooters around for anytime you gotta deal with them heavy leather, heavy combat, and secret service are going to help the most add the blocker card to cut down the blender hands
---
Thank you that looks very optimized
---
If you don't get top ten you get 100-150 xp per match average each rank is 2000 xp....... I gave up before rank 5 I hate br's I can't even be bothered to afk Bush wookie I'd rather spend time with the wife.
---
Yep good luck
---
I got sick of spending endless hours crafting my home to be as comfortable and realistic as possible for other players, only to have them leave the doors open, jump all over everything like an idiot, take all of my tiny collection of food, and kill my cow.
---
The occasional raving compliment wasn‚Äôt worth the other 90% of the time. Fuck all y‚Äôall.
---
"I've got my eye on you... no offense."  
---
"Those detonators..."  
---
"Thanks for killing that raider for the equipment we really didn't need..."  
---
"What, you can't even count on *mercenaries* anymore?"  
---
"Zzzzzzzz..."  
---
~~I think~~ I dislike Ward more than any other NPC in the game.
---
Yup. Wish they'd have a set schedule for events. Then at least you might see a steady group of people show up to specific events.
---
Mind you having all events scheduled in 1 hour wouldnt make sense. A quick Google search without much checking found 49 events, some lasting longer than others, but if each event was scheduled 2-3 hours repeated... I think that'd be awesome.
---
My friend tested it and never got conclusive results...
---
Remember talk of player factions? Remember talk of mods? Why is an annoying flying mob the biggest boss? Why are there like only one super mutant beamoth spawns? It's like others said none of this has or probably ever will happen. It's pretty much a wash and a game of wishes.
---
Send a support ticket to Bethesda or start a new character?
---
Likely an exploit / hacked in gear as even with legacy gear that's nearly impossible. Not everyone is an asshole that plays but epeen is real in this game. If you are on pc DM me. We launch dozens a week on a private server with a chill group of veterans.
---
Its be preferably I went around collecting bloodleaf and ash rose, to make formula p and now they just chilling and getting rotted
---
source?
---
[this article from Eurogamer last week says otherwise](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ps5-backwards-compatibility-ps4-compatible-playstation-6300)
---
&gt;It's important to note that only games from the top 100 games played by PS4 users will be backwards compatible by launch and, even then, the whole list might not be available. The list of backwards compatible games for the PS5 will steadily grow after the console's release, similar to, we imagine, how the list of¬†360 games playable on the Xbox One¬†has grown since it's debut.
---
[From the official blog post by Sony:](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/03/18/unveiling-new-details-of-playstation-5-hardware-technical-specs/)
---
I'd be on board with this.  I scrap all of the non-legendary items I get anyway, so just skipping the middleman and giving me some amount of bulk junk (or the equivalent in non-bulkable junk) seems pretty reasonable.
---
Cap stash‚Äôs and killing and selling enemy Loot - https://youtu.be/jroX92R8ALk (cap farming guide/s.)
---
You forgot to add taking submachine guns out of gun runner. 45 subs have a fast ttk the any other auto and having gun runner on makes it best in slot. Also capping fire rate for autos, jusg like they did for the gatling gun
---
Can a player kill it?? Friend shot it to test but nothing happend. (Not in team)
---
You genuinely have no idea what you're talking about. Just because you don't understand how others are doing much more damage than you doesn't mean they're cheating.
---
No they will just land (if sqb) or crawl
---
For my third slot character(alll solo) as I‚Äôm two commendations away from being General at level 66 I just got a decent crop of weapons to potentially earn those and take a nuke silo. I have been working a lot but right now, but my normal four hour run stands with workshops, earning ammobased ores like copper and lead. Lucky. Hole. Mine. I will swarm to most public events, and specfic hordes depending on if i think the legendary will level to me, (ore mining especially depending on how much extra beeswax(ACID) you harvested from Fasnacht) Make more ammo, and I‚Äôlll basically be repeating until i have enough to really sprint into the DLC for the third time. 
---
I wish there was stuff to do with my pair of lvl 180s rn but solo-speaking, theres nothing left but bullion.
---
4 leaf clover can proc off each pellet, so 1 value point is enough. Fireproof and blocker will make you nigh-unkillable with emergency protocols and lone wanderer. You don't need all those weight reduction perks, or full charge + pain train. Honestly better criticals isnt amazing either, but itll help max out your luck stat for more crits. Bloodied mess and adrenal reaction will be giving you about 60% more damage than the build you posted also. Lemme know if you have any other questions about the build.
---
Thxs
---
Yup and this is so rampant especially lately.  You hit the nail on the head.  Even the idea that there is an all around "best" build is a fallacy to those who have tried bloody, heavy weap, melee PA, etc
---
Lovely Skyrim/fallout bow mechanics, eh?
---
what they (‚¨ÜÔ∏è)said
---
I like to visit some peoples camps and check out what they got. I don't do missions much honestly
---
Yeah, that's a neat trick! I'd like to know that secret as well.
---
I know my way around a build lol. I just posted a justification writeup, lemme know if you have questions about perk choices.
---
Also they have increased damage and radius of explosion. Don't need any perks to ohk someone
---
But I do know where to find caps, friend.
---
lmao, doesn't belong.
---
That's a good laugh for a new defense too. "It's only benefit is the extreme advantage of gaining height'
---
Oddly enough I‚Äôve never been a fan of bows in any of the Elder Scrolls games. Fallout bows seem to be a different story lol.
---
I would do the main quest line up until you have completed Roses quests, then switch over to do the quests for Wastelanders and complete the vault.  You want to start earning your gold bullion and your reputation with the factions as quickly as you can since it will take you a while to get it done.
---
I think at level 39 you‚Äôre in a good place to start them up, you should be around level 50 when you get to the final heist.
---
Then You can go back and clear up the rest of the main storyline at your leisure.
---
Edit: Oh, and you might want to do the quest for the better backpack if you haven‚Äôt already (the possum scout stuff), the extra carry weight is worth prioritizing it IMHO
---
they do, but move a lot more
---
Yer I know but it still sux.
---
Thank you!
---
Skyrim and FO76 share the Same engine and same bow mechanics
---
If you're on PC these might've been my nukes, I've been launching a ton lately and do 3 queen's in about half hour, although I don't know how people kill them so fast.
---
The original questline wasn't bad for what it was, but I did enjoy the NPCs telling the story in Wastelanders better than the delivery via tapes and bots. 
---
Both are worth doing. Wastelanders has two main questlines... one that you get from the radio, and one you get from 2 NPCs outside of Vault 76. Maybe stop by the Vault and do that questline, finish the original, and listen to the radio one.
---
Got a friend who doesn't use frog legs and he just times his shots. Its not about where they are its where they will be
---
(Preston Garvey sends you a hologram (Leia/R2D2 style) using a modified eyebot)
---
It‚Äôs the Jedi way
---
If they rewarded us with lead and steel and stuff, we could make our own ammo...  (in the ammo type we actually are using)
---
I play as a ranger shock trooper with my jet pack, scouring the divide for legendaries and wiping out those damn mutants. 
---
I own a nice slot of land in the hidden southern mountain ranges, next to a pond, where I pump out ammo and stims both for sale and charity. I frequent the vault 76 area and provide goods for those below-level-10s, as I know the difference 30 and 0 stimpacks make.
---
A Stealthy jetpacker means I can also provide Overwatch for any other ranger or wastelenader that decides to play nice and team up. Yesterday, for instance, not a word was shared between a fellow other ranger veteran versed in stealth and myself. We took event after event together and never said a word to one another, filling this atmosphere of the grizzled survival types recognizing one another as equals and deciding to make the wasteland feel the wrath of suppressed weapons.
---
Yesterday I stopped fast traveling to my locations and ended up meeting twice as many people as I have in any other fast traveling sessions. I think just immersing myself and allowing natural human interaction in the wasteland setting has led to some of my better stories. It‚Äôs so cool cutting the lone wolf gameplay that I like with the odd alliance or gimmicky camp visit, some of the many unique scenarios I‚Äôve found myself in were from dropping some grind and just exploring West Virginia!
---
Unless you're trading damage for increased DR and HP, how are you perking against launchers?
---
Ironclad for increased DR, and Lifegiver for HP, I don't normally wear PA, and there's not many other options.
---
How are people damaging camps then, is this an exploit?
---
Double the Action, double the fun...
---
... That's the flavor that you'll savor with Double Action Gum
---
Just keep crossing that name off the list.
---
No problem üòÖ
---
Choose the raiders
---
I bought them last week from graham outside the Ava medical site on the northern end of the Ash heap
---
Like clockwork
---
MTG?
---
?
---
I'm tempted to.
---
because you get no legendary effects on power armor vs regular armor.
---
It's a likely result when you take a game that has no chat and very few people have mics, and then you add in events that require explanation. Oh, and then you announce the event server wide and provide all players on the server free travel to the complex event, incentivize them going with the promise of in some cases unique rewards, and make it harder the more players are present.
---
Unless they release a "activate all three pylons to damage the invisible thing" emote or a "don't shoot the ghouls laying on the ground" emote..
---
It‚Äôs a joke about a particular way to get very fast rep with the raiders.
---
When I was low level I had to find out the hard way what initiates pvp and workshops are top pvp places. There are tactics to workshops but overall it‚Äôs hard to defend against other players. 
---
Also people will purposely not join an event with lots of spawns to enable friendly fire when they show up. Can happen because of a glitch as well.
---
Turning on passive mode is the best way to avoid pvp and a necessity when using explosive weaponry but there are ways around it.
---
The mutation electrically charged will still enable pvp in passive mode if you have it and someone is smacking you. 
---
I heard things about radiation guns and bombs but idk.
---
You don‚Äôt get plans from scraping, you learn mods directly.
---
With the right build it‚Äôs not hard to kill her fast. Was probably a bloody or junkies build
---
Maybe it'll be in an Enclave bundle. People have been clamoring for one for a while now. There's stuff that has been datamined that wasn't released for several months in the past, such as the Responders stuff, so we just have to be patient.
---
I have those.  I gain weight (and lose DR) when I get in Excavator.  (I know, it's my own fault.)
---
Same ,ive been doing between 3-6 a day depending on cards mostly on public.its more fun.Ive watched the clips of magic weapons  but this was something diferent
---
Im in the high 200s and can solo the Queen but it takes me 15mins but this guy lol
---
Yes. I kept all of the gold, and have since maxed raiders. Almost maxed settlers.
---
PA for me is like buying that amazing sports car to drive to work 10 minutes from my house; sure there's a more effective way to travel but it looks amazing.
---
Troubleshooters armor is VERY helpful for encryptid. It can be done without it, but it makes a HUGE difference. Even a set of random 1 star troubleshooters pieces helps a lot!
---
I *think* I am...?
---
Oh really? Wasn‚Äôt aware the bow mechanics were the same! Probably because I never used them lol.
---
Magic: The Gathering
---
I think the original has a lot of quick stuff you can get out of the way, while giving you a decent map waypoint skeleton for wastelanders, for fast travel.(if thats of use to you) 
---
once you hit level 50, any quest you complete like ‚ÄòCold Case‚Äô will usually give you a level 50 iteration of the reward weapon, in this c a s e an incendiary 10mm submachine gun. very good for any built up 10mm ammo!
---
The current character slots i have filled, im actually doing one OG&gt;DLC and the other will be a mix. I think getting the first endgame outta the way will make wastelanders feel a bit more special!
---
Kinda, but the fog crawlers are based on Shrimp/Crawfish, in particular I think the mantis shrimp- they have legs, two arms, and an outer shell.  Slivers have a single arm (ignore any of the shitty 2014 slivers when they made them look like people and changed the wording to ‚ÄúYour slivers‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúAll slivers‚Äù, but I‚Äôm not bitter), no legs, and the pointy face Without eyes. 
---
Slivers I believe were designed to invoke the spirit of the Alien movie (hence the long head)
---
Oh lol
---
Yeah those random missles and mini nukes that I often get rewarded. I always,drop them because they are so heavy.
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Idk if you get tickets for receiving duplicate base cards.
---
Field surgeon and either a medicine bobble head and/or first aid perk card. There are only 3 straight damage perk cards per weapon. Taking off tank killer doesn't change damage if you have tenderizer.
---
Would need to reconcile this with the various electrified mods than melee weapons have, but cool idea. I would love to see a more lore friendly integration.
---
That‚Äôs perfect! I did Rose‚Äôs quests till I had to fight the wendigo and died twice so switched over. Did the first 2 quests for the settlers and got the Chinese stealth armor plans. Then started doing some raiders quest where I have to meet Johny in an arena or something. So that‚Äôs when I started thinking that maybe I should just stick to one main quest.  Thanks for the advice
---
The renaming system is total garbage!
---
At the same time, I‚Äôd argue our dwellers are smart enough to figure out how to add that plating to the rest of the suit.
---
I try to be thorough, wish more people tried too lol I know any little detail can potentially be helpful.
---
Yeah I totally agree, that‚Äôs why I think survival should come back
---
They need to add ammo scrapping. I wonder how many rounds of .45 I could get from 80 missles and 20 mini nukes?
---
The drops are only RNG. The only stipulation on loot with the SBQ is doing over 1000 or so damage to qualify for loot... What you end up getting is random.
---
If you claim a workshop it opens up a pvp area where passive mode will not protect you. Anyone who claims a workshop makes that ground a turf war where anything goes.
---
Troubleshooters armor makes them really easy to deal with
---
Alternatively, I am considering doing a No Camp run next. Every player seems to have a camp with all work benches and stash boxes, so I don't need my own. Losing a free fast travel spot will suck but will not be the end of the world. Vending is good but not necessary if you aren't aiming for high caps. I think it is doable and would be a fun challenge: Hobo Vault Dweller, wandering the wastes.
---
I live my X01 and Excavator with calibrated shocks, but I'm also in the middle of building the Secret Service setup as I'm interested in trying it out. As a casual player I'm loyal to no build. Lol.
---
NP :)
---
That's not 100% accurate I think.
---
The lady who takes the Photo Opportunity photos changes her initial dialog to say "welcome back" once you're high enough instead of being dismissive.  In random encounters, I noticed a new line referring to how that raider respects you not fears you that I don't recall hearing when just getting started.  I think people rushed the questline so fast that they didn't get a chance to hear the low rep lines.
---
I skip the dialog and still get the rep
---
No legendaries does make sense for immersion purposes. However, mutations are completely immersive in the world of FO. We already have to fight mutated creatures and its canon that humans themselves are no exception to mutations. Ghouls are the most abundant example besides super *mutants*. It would actually be less immersive if mutations didn't exist. 
---
 Survival mode should be much more challenging and restrictive though. Level caps, no respec of special, no changing perks in and out, no perks that reduce carry weight or that lessen the negative side of mutations. Requirement of sleep. The goal needs to be to *survive* the wasteland, with the odds always stacked against you.
---
Same I was enjoying the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fallout experience with NPCs but didn‚Äôt want to start rushing into one main quest and get stuck because of my level and have to entirely switch over! Thanks
---
The end game involves a kind and elderly lady sitting behind a counter, she‚Äôs so resourceful you don‚Äôt need to understand anything she says.
---
I love power armor tbh. Makes me feel like Iron Man
---
The end game involves waiting for an endgame.
---
Already implemented. The guass mini has the Tesla mod which makes it like an explosive laser of sorts.
---
I just started a new character with Wastelanders and did this.  You have to get to rose to do wastelanders so it is a good cutover, but with the long burn on wastelanders and great experience on the daily quests (3) for wasteland it is easy exp and  start building up bullion you will need.
---
I am level 115 now with that new character as I work a lot of side quests as it boosts exp and I also get the +60 weight backpack as that is huge!  That makes you do the tadpole enough to get that.
---
Try replacing bear arms with lock and load, gets rid of those long heavy weapon reloads
---
i've neever heard of someone doing that kinda dmage to her on console without melee even with the glitched fast fire rate guns
---
Thanks for the offer but im on PS4, yer that's what we thought,my mates got a bssa mmg and hes doing 8k+ hits and it still takes way longer than what happened here and she was flying.
---
That's actually an interesting restriction. If you pair that with no fast travel then that would be quite the survival playthrough!
---
I was thinking something similar but for other energy weapons
---
This
---
I just had a count up and I think it's 45.
---
Solo‚Äôd the SBQ and got one star tire iron. If it‚Äôs linked to damage it probably means the more i damage her, the more she hates me.
---
that guy is an Encryptid
---
Don't forget the Pink Floyd to set the mood.
---
The full set can spawn at 15, it's just rather uncommon. You'll likely hit the next level bracket (20) before you happen upon enough lvl 15 pieces to make a full suit. Unless you rush Rose's questline that is.
---
The only thing I hated about survival was the caps loss. I couldn't afford losing 500 caps every death. Lol. Then they made it insignificant, just can't win with Bethesda
---
I see this complaint all the time the game is so easy as it is so biulds are really only personal preference and what's fun for you to play. Who cares if one biuld type has better stuff or not I really dont get it.
---
And for all those that were around at the start like myself the main complaint i saw was non PA biulds weren't viable end game and that the game forced you into a PA biuld, now all of a sudden PA is trash??? Just cuz non PA guys finally got some love 
---
People are so funny
---
Try with another/new character, it‚Äôll be 50. I renamed 50 items 01-50 and did not get stopped until 51
---
Well I was pretty much 50 by the time I did everything past rose and I waited until then to do the wastelander stuff, kind of regret that now. I‚Äôd jump into the wastelanders quests and see how you get on.
---
Likely they were using god mode to stack bobbleheads. They need to fix this crap already. It ruins pvp.üò°
---
Camp stuff (stock the vending machines/craft ammo/bulk junk to sell/see if ally has a quest). Eat and drink something. Meander a bit or jump into treasury note reward event. Eat and drink something. Tackle a daily or two. Eat or drink something. Offload scrubby legendaries. Eat and drink something. Shop at player vendors. Eat and drink something. Forbidden Knowledge. Eat and drink something. Fix gear. Eat and drink something. SBQ fight if I‚Äôm up for it. Eat and drink lots of somethings. You know, just living my best life in post-apocalyptic Appalachia.
---
Yep and ive seen it done lotsa times but dying in the air les than 30 seconds after taking off from the fissure,she didn't even get to the bunker. Something a bit fishy going on here...
---
You can always use a Tesla like most of the kids with no skill in this game.
---
I‚Äôm not a PA build, and I don‚Äôt know why I think this but a giant fucking 8ft metal man yielding a Gatling laser bigger than most people should be more powerful than little man with assault rifle. But that‚Äôs really not the case, and it should be.
---
Ya I have the whole set but in multiple levels but i have 3 peace‚Äôs that are level 15 after spends 3 hours server hoping but stopped when it stopped spawning.
---
Because I like playing a stereotypical BoS PA Heavy Gunner. Mowing down SBs with a monstrous gun is a blast.
---
You can get a full set but the time and effort it takes you're better off levelling to 25 and crafting excavator.
---
Thank you. Yeah I think I‚Äôll keep doing the OG quest if I can kill the damn Wendigo. Third time‚Äôs the charm I hope and then move on to DLC to start getting gold bullions as one player replied above.
---
Pure RNG, only qualifier is doing 1K damage, if you don't meet the threshold you will get fuck all
---
You still share rewards they just don‚Äôt show the quest steps on the play screen anymore.
---
Head into the mountains. Along either side of the Savage Divide there's awesome views of the Forest, Mire and Bog.
---
This is why I dont have a spine..........I blew my back out
---
Im still going to drop missiles and mini nukes because they are incredibly heavy. I'm not lugging 20 pounds of missiles back to my camp just to get 50 5.56 rounds
---
Those Mirelurk Kings wittle yah down, and then the wendigos just like blaerghbg
---
"take my goddam gift and stop running away!" said the burning guy
---
You said you wouldnt display though
---
I know this is gonna be unpopular but I just gotta ask...why does everyone think this game has an unlimited amount of hours of gameplay? No other game offers an infinite experience? Skyrim? Main story or rebuild a new character. Fallout 4? Same thing, u can do different builds or play through the main campaign or side quests. I'm confused when people are like "I'm lvl 1100, and theres nothing for me to do!" Like...ofc there isn't? You've devoted hours and hours into beating the game. U have endgame armor. You've done the main quest. The side quests, ally quests, wastelanders dlc. Boss battles...like you've done it all. You can either wait for new content or go play another game. No game boasts that you can play it forever with new experiences everytime u pick it up. So why do ppl suddenly think this game will last forever?
---
I think you can go under Arktos any time. It's just the event doesn't trigger like it used to. Not 100 pct sure but you might want to see.
---
If you‚Äôre on pc hit me up and I‚Äôll run one with you at some point.
---
Ammo converter got datamine from first season rewards
---
Thank you. I‚Äôll try to that and get the best of both
---
I‚Äôve joined a couple encryptid events that failed recently. Noticed a lack of players willing to be the conduits so I had to jump in and do it myself. Problem is, I‚Äôm not built to be a conduit AT ALL. I‚Äôm a high health heavy build but I have ZERO sneaking ability, can‚Äôt fit serendipity, dodgy, or blocker, so I can‚Äôt just hide or tank the imposter when they come for me. What I excel at in that fight is doing massive damage with a legacy flamer to both the imposter and the giant Gutsy mob. But I can‚Äôt really do that when I have to try and run from the imposter‚Äôs that‚Äôs breathing down my neck. 
---
I will still take a pylon if no one else is, because I don‚Äôt want us to fail, but being a conduit is not the right role for my build and it hurts our overall chances of success. I get it, it‚Äôs not as fun, but when no one on the server wants to take that role, we‚Äôll never win the fight.
---
Also California is like 3000 miles from West Virginia 
---
The NCR will litterally never make it that far
---
Can you pin point a location on the map please
---
My play style changed recently when I hit the 30k caps limit for the first time.
---
Normally, I set up my CAMP over some sort of ore deposit in a high-traffic area, and mine something valuable like aluminum or copper. And my CAMP is totally focused on being a "service" for other players; open water purifiers, open Collectron, accessible workbenches, and I sell bulked materials and food/drinks for less than full retail price.
---
But... when I hit 30k caps, and couldn't sell any more, a switch flipped in my head.
---
I now have a CAMP with a view, at the edge of the map, and am just making a nice home for me and Sofia to live in together. All decorated nicely. A garden. A brahmin. No defenses. A roll-up metal door that I close when I'm not around.
---
I've gone domestic.
---
I still have the same stuff on sale for good prices, but I have few if any visitors, because I'm way off in the boonies. And I like it that way.
---
Tried to it said level 50+ but cannot enter till a later time
---
Bots I think? I'm gonna up vote y'all to make up for it. But you can do that quest any time you hop in a new server.
---
Hahahaha yup pretty much. First time used the Chinese stealth armor to try and sneak around but still had to fight 2 of them and when I finally reached the Wendigo he bugged out and didn‚Äôt spawn so had to redo it again and got slaughtered.
---
Thank you but unfortunately on PS4.
---
Oh dang. Ok then. Sorry for the misinformation
---
In FO4 the weight bench gave you +1 Strength 
---
Adding any more than that would be far too incredibly over powered
---
I'm sure this will get downvoted, but people need to build smaller buildings. I always come across these huge buildings that look like crap inside because they used too much budget on the building themselves. I have a decent sized house and have budget to spare and its packed with stuff, including the outside with crops I don't even need.
---
All good, ur just trying to pass possible information out
---
Yeah i know but its sooo mind bogling when you see to giant red rocket themed releases in 2 week but not one enclave bundle. I mean the enclave shoudl sell way better then Red Rocket stuff or am i mistaken?
---
Yes players can kill it, and they don‚Äôt get flagged as wanted
---
I like to grief people and on the rare instance I find an actual pvper to fight I do that too.
---
This happened on PS4 the other day.  Someone nuked the queen zone.  I fast-traveled to participate.
---
Once I loaded-in II heard a younger player voice-chatting with a older player regarding the best way to complete then event.  Older player says something to the effect of "watch this".  
---
5 seconds later the queen was dead.  The younger player kept asking how that was possible and how he could learn to do that.  The rest of us just stood around with no rewards.
---
I, too, would love to learn how to get close to doing that kind of damage on my bloodied build character.
---
70+ feral gouls in the burrows.... quite a few spawn legendary on any given run.  I highly suggest you give it another chance and throw it in the rotation.
---
once you get a familiar route it is does not take long at all.  This area is much better than the golf club and is a better place to Nuke if you are looking to hunt mobs.
---
True lol
---
Worth it, I got mine at low level too, no regrets.
---
It's not so much that power armor is bad. Sure, it can use some buffs and some attention but it's the fact that Unyielding just adds way too much. It is honestly a bit overkill how much Unyielding offers. A person in power armor should be able to carry more than someone not in power armor. No logic can argue this.
---
Dabney Homestead/Hemlock Holes(Acid)/ Billings Homestead-40ore/hr + fast travel points!
---
Stabilized is a great perk card, period.
---
how do you "repair" a once living being exactly?
---
Nice post. I just drop all the unwanted to the nearest player, if they dont want it, leave it..
---
Pitchfork, I wish try a 1 star Nocturnal Lead pipe.   First time I was part of a group that finished it and that was what I walked away with.
---
UPDATE: Just got bought it! I looted for junk for a bit which was kinda hard in Watoga because of all the high level robots üòÖ. But I just bought it so I‚Äôm happy! Thanks everyone for the feedback!
---
Mostly rng
---
They added NPCs but still feels like there aren't any.
---
loot everything you kill(if its lookin like theyre dropping caps anyways) decent amounts of enemies drop like 3-5 caps  from time to time, ghouls, mutants, even radtoads!
---
Seems like conversion rates are gonna be miserable though
---
Yeah i don't because each one takes about 1% of budget to display. I had all of the comics and bobble heads up, but after removing them I was able to build a 4x7x7 fight club arena
---
The fact that is was made by the Brotherhood and not the Secret Service might also be an indication.
---
Same way the Brahmin gets repaired. I guess a hidden team of specialists nurse them back to health or cultists raise them from the dead.
---
Camp placement depends on why you want your camp there.. Veiw? Extractor placement? Fast travel Centralized? Close to daily or farming spots? Really cool build?  Pick criteria and work down from there.. For me it was junk extractor/water for my water wheels/drug crafting /central fast travel so I ended up fighting over the central spot by pleastview trainstation. On one toon, on another I'm right outside crater on a lead deposit and 6 water purifiers.
---
Why determines where.
---
Good view flat covers a lot of spots a lot of witch changed post wastelanders btw.
---
Ward can go get pegged by a mirelurk queen. Hate that fuck.
---
Why are you carrying months worth of junk?
---
I've thought about using that before, but usually just focus on DPS, and/or movement speed. I'll try swapping those in, and see how I like it.
---
I was thinking view
---
This would be cool to set a favorites playlist. I‚Äôd also like the ability to permanently Disney Vault some of the recurring events/quests I do not enjoy, like being auto given the mission to take any workshop or power up any power plant I happen to walk by. Love to be able tailor the event/quest alerts around my play style.
---
Don't carry around a month's worth of a junk my dude.
---
(Sheepsquatch legend grows)
---
People would just build 700,000 plushies to try to crash the game
---
I had this problem. 
---
The only way I fixed it is by not talking to him for a full week.
---
So starting from now don't talk to him for a week.
---
Who is this Smiley and how do I find him?
---
Been playing since BETA and I'm an idiot, no doubt, but this is the first I've heard of The Burrows.
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda, so yes I‚Äôm sure they will release it for the next dozen or so generations of consoles if they‚Äôre consumers and fans haven‚Äôt completely abandoned them by that point.
---
I don‚Äôt have stash space and I don‚Äôt have the scrap box.
---
Really? When I got slapped into godmode (player overkilled me with a tesla in pvp) all I got was this disgusting reskin of my character where my spine was sticking out of my back
---
I'm like level 55 and have very little content left to partake in.
---
I don‚Äôt have stash space nor do I have the scrap box.
---
I have the same bug but definitely just stole it for the caps.
---
Seriously though, one day I found an extra Raider Thief that was already dead with a goober on his corpse.  The second goober never gets removed and is always what Ward is looking for.   I don't mind because screw him.
---
I didn't want to crush their dreams too badly üòî
---
Thank you for this information
---
Participating will still get you the 2* combat armor piece + treasury notes if you've completed the wastelander questline, but yes unless you reach the damage threshold you are not getting the flux or loot from the queen.
---
They should definately move with the updated hardware.. ü§ûüèª
---
Marine tactical helmets take 1, 1 &amp; 3 plastic, glass and rubber (I don't remember which quantity for which) to craft. If you craft these helmets (ideally with super duper) you can sell these to vendors for way more than the junk itself is worth. Selling these with high charisma and hard bargain I get 31 caps each.
---
Actually, I wouldn't be surprised to see the X02 as a fallout 1st skin. They usually release the nostalgia stuff there for maximum whale milkage.
---
After the endgame stuff, pretty much now I consider myself a guide for newer players. I have taken more than a couple players from under 20 to past 50. Created some great friendships. I almost act more, I guess, like an NPC and I just follow the newer players around, help them with quests, take them on experience runs, answer their questions about items and gameplay like weight management and stable flora.
---
Hopefully, I love the game but hate the framerate on PS4
---
If you think  that is cool get it from a tesla rifle and the flames will be blue
---
If you end up with to much scrap in your box sell off the access in your camp vendor. If it's not selling the price is either too high or something people don't buy often.
---
High levels will grab things like fiber optics, screws, aluminum, etc pretty often if the price is right. That and toss what ammo you dont need in there that way you can buy more of what you need. 
---
Fuel 5.56 .308 .50 .45 and so on move pretty fast at the 1 cap each price
---

Industrials don't really matter, the water collection is the same, the industrials just store more, not worth moving for just a few more stored purified waters. I found that 3-5 of the regular ones do just fine.
---
Then you don't need it and the game did you a favour.
---
Live free gentle butterfly. And you know, only pick up stuff you're going to be using in the next day.
---
I don't even understand the NCR love. 
---
They are the very model of an ineffective government on the edge of collapse due to a corrupt and over bloated bureaucracy.
---
After the new wastelanders quest line its back to " do dailies, get bullion, get scrip, roll new weapons/armor with modules, then try to find something to do" 
---
Its just very monotonous
---
well , you could do the patrol duty event for a random chance at getting the handmade plans , which is how i got my plans
---
That‚Äôs what I did early game. You can only make 5 in each purifier. I would get 25 from 5 every ten minutes. With hard bargain I got 400 caps from 100 water. Grape mentats will get better prices. It had draw backs because you need to carry it store all that water.
---
Can you still do that even?
---
It's more satisfying to use an explosive weapon and take out a whole section with one bullet much quicker lol
---
After a while it's a pain.
---
This is a live service game. Live service games by their very nature are supposed to have content flow. And we dont need unlimited content, just repeatable content thats worth repeating. Horde mode has been offered multiple times as a viable option.
---
This. Production is shared between machines. If you have 100 purifiers, you're just multiplying your storage by 100, its the same water per hour as 1 machine.
---
Sells gold bullion upstairs at the wayward
---
You lost a month‚Äôs worth of junk because of your play style. I‚Äôm guessing your stash is maxed and you‚Äôre walking around with hundreds of pounds of junk while using every weight reduction perk available. You knew it would happen sooner or later.
---
I got the plan on my first purchased pail. Only found a junk one in the wild.
---
Down just north of dropsite v9 makes a great spot to sell my ammo stores as everyone stops by for the queen fight
---
I miss vault raids.
---
I hope you never take workshops, cause somebody is going to cap your ass and take everything......
---
I've learned extractors are more of an added bonus than a camp feature. The amount of stuff you get out of them really isn't enough to make them the reason for picking a camp spot.
---
*slowly sips from his FO 1st account* sounds like a personal problem...
---
Well that isnt a problem for cause yeah i am one of the stupid people that would pay for it
---
Ah I see
---
Yep, very pleasing.
---
Yeah would be my choices too.
---
Personally i'd like to see an overcharge effect, chance of on hit of Electric (Small AoE, Chain lightning like telsa gun etc) / Fire (just a damage over time) / base damage (Basically a super charge, 40% extra damage or chance of chain lightning and Burn damage). That kind of thing
---
Somebody‚Äôs been watching Dinogirl or the Casagrandes.
---
after main quest, after perfecting Perks and C.A.M.P. and getting that legendary armor/weapon combo....
---
It's like what you figured, Finding out which lore holds water, which ones are bogus and a let down. 
---
(Nukashine Dreamwalker is still in the upside down as to wtf it is, "what is that?" -don't worry about it-)
---
What's nice, though, is being able to rearrange and swap out perks (lockpicking/hacking, crafting and salvaging perks can be used and put to the side as needed)... after level 50, your points are maxed, but offer per level point rearrangement and unobtained perk card additions.
---
NOTICE ME DWELLER, NOTICE ME!
---
Did it yesterday
---
They all sound like good ideas I think the overcharge thing sounds cool
---
Heavyweapon + Protocols and Field Surgeon is great
---
OK. I figured they would have immediatly patched that. I don't exploit but I may have to do that one. Only have a half bar left to go and it is soooooooo tedious
---
Are duped stacked bobble heads and BE / TSE The Dragon still a thing, maybe with a Crit headshot in VATS from that distance?
---
Have you been watching me play...?!?
---
2 weeks of same restocking line
---
Me getting spike-trap flung out of another camp right into a fissure
---
I like the sentiment, but you know that the first new player comes along is just going to hover up all 10 of those bags....
---
Then wouldn‚Äôt be able to move from all the weight. Lol.
---
Lol your story sounds almost identical to what happened to me.  Haha I just remember it being over and thinking "What was that and what just happened to me!".   The event is actually a lot of fun once you kinda figure out how it works so don't get discouraged.  I've had good luck doing it with a set of troubleshooters armor and a vampires gun.  
---
Also there is a 10 minute window from when the event starts to when you have to recall the imposter sheepsquash.  If you wait until most of the time is up it gives people a chance to show up and get geared up for it.  A lot of players need a few minutes to change armor, perks, etc around for the event.
---
ü§£ü§£
---
This made me happy. I may have created a beautiful friendship :)
---
I'll break down and get it one day I'm sure, at least for a month to cash in the skins. They just haven't really impressed me enough to fork over real cash in a while. I barely ever wear my elder battle coat that I paid real cash for as well.
---
Yeah, pre-Wastelanders, I used to wear my ritual mask because I thought it made me look like a total goth badass. After Wastelanders, I didn‚Äôt want to be associated with those silly Mothman cultists. But in the time in between, I noticed I would freak out players and wonder why until I remembered what I was wearing.
---
Nope, you‚Äôre limited to 15 ‚Äúperk‚Äù points in cards. Your STR can go quite a bit higher though.
---
Sounds like the NV mod, I think it was called rust or dust.
---
K if you look up fo76 resource map and look up junk pile there's a junk pile just se of foundation just behind south mountain lookout,  has an amazing view of cranberry bog, people dropping nukes, the massive monorail elevator and overall just awesome overall only reason I'm not there no open water.
---
People are downing the queen in seconds without godmode too.
---
I had the settler/chicken encounter myself the other day.  Thought it was kinda funny + I got free chicken!
---
It goes poof
---
Edit:  My favorite is freezing mid gun battle,  unfreezing to your body flying through the air
---
I like to play the Uranium Fever event. It's right next to a train station so you can easily walk over and sell all of the mole miner gauntlets and weapons you pick up. Be sure to break down the mole miner suits for black titanium scrap. 
---
Also, I sell all of my glowing meat.
---
Imagine tagging the CM's in a useless shitpost. What exactly are you trying to accomplish here other than complaining?
---
The chicken meat was the bonus üòé
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Also throw in events and other side quests (like unlocking Beckett) to break up things if you feel it‚Äôs starting to drag or get boring.
---
Are they adding tf2 tier unusuals?
---
My heavy weapons PA user has a chainsaw long bow bar and flaming mods I used for trash, low lvl mobs etc. It‚Äôs a riot.
---
I got it too, gonna contact support
---
This reminds me of when I was ten years old and I couldn't navigate a jump puzzle in Mario 3... It's the one in World 5 where you're moving upwards through the course up into the Cloud Kingdom.. That was tough. I remember screaming and throwing fits yelling "the game is broken the game is broken!". Eventually after some practice and learning to use the games mechanics to my advantage I realized the problem wasn't the game.
---
Just thought I would chime in really quick because I was banned initially for a month due to this post. I was coming from a place of anger which is never a good idea when trying to discuss anything. After a lot of heated back and forth via mod mail, we all finally calmed down and had a proper discussion. I conceded that I did indeed violate a rule, therefore I don‚Äôt contest the post being taken down. Other criticisms were brought up and addressed in what I would call an adequate manner. Once everyone had a level head it was smooth sailing, apologies on both ends were given and we all moved on.
---
No one is perfect, not us, not the mods or anyone else. There are things that still need feedback, and things that I think could be altered as far as rules and enforcement go. But I was wrong for coming at them in such a way, as it isn‚Äôt their fault really. They‚Äôre only doing what they think is best for the community and the sub. My month ban was lifted entirely after the discussions, and I hope in the future more open discussion can happen rather than pointless bickering.
---
Tl;Dr: The mods are pretty cool. Lifted my ban, had a fair discussion with me on rules and enforcement. Just talk to them and treat them fairly, even if you think you‚Äôre in the right, and they‚Äôll do the same for you.
---
I am on pc. It was actually really well done whoever did it, very experienced and confident of the kill (magic guns naturally) as they launched the second nuke as the first was just about to land and it worked perfectly. She spawned again literally 10 seconds after the first died.
---
that's cool had a PvP the other day with someone with an auto tesla I had the same effects only blue flames, didn't really clip sense I was in the middle of some guy trashing my camp and dashed and came back sense it was a huge giveaway
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I maybe able to craft the parts you need at the level you want.
---
There is note about this in the VTU terminals, it talks about Ogham, Basque. There is a woman called Jacquelyn that has notes about the runes and a translation key.  There is also a comment about Agent Wilson and Occam
---
Fantastic story - and yes, the first time is quite often just like that ;-)
---
Did it complete? And did you do a bunch of googling to figure out how the heck the event runs?
---
It‚Äôs pretty intense and can be quite fast.
---
The baseball bat to this is satisfying in some weird way...
---
He'd just slow walk down the hill and scrap it all at the overseers camp.
---
It's what I'd do if that happened to me as a new player.
---
Of course I've also played *Skyrim* so.....
---
I never at any point said that others were doing more damage than me. I have no idea where you came up with that theory. I've done bloodied/unyielding, junkies, berserkers, stealth builds, etc...I know how to do damage.
---
I also never said that I haven't used a bugged/magic weapon. I absolutely have. I have a Medic's Ultracite Gatling Laser that will melt a level 95 behemoth in under 2 seconds, at full health. No Adrenal Reaction or Psychobuff or food or anything else. Entirely the weapon and the bugged effect. And it does outsized damage to the queen as well.
---
I know *exactly* what I'm talking about. Here's a video though, since you apparently do not:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo_8XKVqGQ
---
Farm Cave Crickets and Yao Guai hordes. Keep the boss alive, and just let them spawn minions forever. You get acid, xp, and the chance for the minions to spawn as legendaries. I had a Yao Guai horde spawn inside the Valley Galleria mall, and farmed them for 2 1/2 hours. I walked away with a level and a half worth of xp, 20+ legendaries, and almost 2k acid.
---
Grind for gear, rebuild camp, churn dailies, new outfit, rebuild camp, read reddit, nuke bat, shoot bat, read reddit, complain about ATOM store, grind some more.
---
Exactly. I use a chainsaw for trash mobs to conserve ammo and because chopping up a ___________with a CHAINSAW is hella fun
---
I actually got one of the weapons classed as ‚Äúmagic‚Äù today from rusty pick but I was using my bloodied Gatling laser as usual.
---
 I have the most fun it being an actual experience, especially if some lower levels are around. I like dropping them for other people mainly (and some flux ingredients for my serum productions). 
---
Cheapens it a bit for me personally having the ability to totally trivialise her in seconds.
---
Where was the location? Is it bought for caps?
---
Ahh I remember when I was a peasant
---
I find it to be quite the opposite unless im playing  Scorched Earth or in a Nuke Zone, most players dont use PA.
---
I understand free range, I'm just the only person to show up. And then all the Brahmin die, because the game spawns enough enemies for a TEAM of players. Events should have a recommended number of players, as well as a suggested level.
---
Submit a ticket asking for a refund. Worked for me with the $30.00 free-states bundle a year ago...
---
The QA seems particularly bad this refresh. The paratrooper bag clips into the ground pretty substantially too.
---
I like the bow :(
---
You get it
---
Watched an Angry Turtle video...cryolator does wonders
---
Faction based warfare servers, no protections on camps. Faction bases and terriotry,  seasonal resets. They made an online fallout game, but kept it to close to offline fallout. They need more online based content. Players are the greatest end game bosses.
---
They are nerfing auto grenade launchers fire rate significantly but thats about all I know about.
---
It's because these examples are all things that require multiple people to do them in co-ordination in a game where you don't have to queue in with a ready made team / comms. They should make things you can do solo and make them involved. The reliance on the multiplayer side of things is what hampers it.
---
I would just want 1 star legionaries with the weight reduction stats for meds/guns/junk ect. Make PA compete with backpack and armor while freeing up some perks.
---
So there is no difference between industrial and the small collector. They collect at the same rate?
---
Ooo haven't seen that, bummer.
---
That still works?
---
I agree with you. I have been trying hard in Project Paradise lately, to gather as much material as possible so that stronger animals are spawned. I found out that most people are just  sitting there idle, waiting for the timer to run out. It is almost impossible to get 3 animals of at least level 2. What I learning from my experience with other cooperative online games (GTA Online for example) is that the more complex a mission is, the less possible for it to be effectively completed, even by the lowest standards
---
My goal is for our voices to be heard that‚Äôs all and it got a reaction out of you so it‚Äôs not completely useless
---
More dakka!
---
Funnily enough all my automatic weapons have dakka nickname variations.
---
It doesn't just result in better rewards, that's the ONLY way to get  the better rewards from the event.  The Bear Arm and Stimpak Diffuser plans ONLY drop if you keep 3/3 animals alive.
---
Yes, the industrial just stores more.
---
I'm a noob.. thanks.
---
And just a quick note, you most likely need to be level 25 since that's the level you can first craft one.
---
On a public server?
---
I feel like once I got my gatling laser around lvl 35 or so it was my ticket to easy mode. Before I couldn't go to whitesprings and a regular scorchbeast would send me running.
---
I agree. As a high damage, heavy weapons build, I automatically just assume the tank position and murder any ghoul in the hallways running towards the center. With my plasma Gatling, on my build, almost ever ghoul not legendary is down in 3-5 direct hits, and I pack plenty of ammo. Not bragging, but I know my role. Everyone else can do the gathering, while I do the skull fucking.
---
ROFL!
---
possibly ammo converter found in season rewards.. im hoarding crappy ammo for it.
---
" Seriously, why does NO dialogue change as we help and improve out  reputation with the factions. Why am I still treated suspiciously with  the Raiders even after becoming allied with them. Why does Ward act like  I haven't ever done a single thing for them even though I brought back  their junk they can't keep safe just the day before. "
---
Because the whole came is a single big SLOPJOB,  hastily cobbled together with lots of tape and chewing gum. its wonder that anything works at all...
---
Knowing your basicly immune to pvp damage and inciting encounters with others is harassment imo. Also most ppl may not catch on they are cheating until a couple deaths. Not the vats bug I'm talking about, this basic no damage exploit.
---
 Stuff like players exploiting things  and even some putting on yt for others has stopped my vending and and any pvp. Sad because I feel pvp, pve, and trading are really the big things to do, two of which I won't touch now.
---
Freezing was my problem?
---
Gurl there needs to be a flamer armor set for the gaymers
---
You're welcome to correct me if I am wrong please, but I believe smiley does a lockout after his reset which is approximately 8:00 or 8:30 on a Saturday evening I don't know the duration of the buy time but after it's past it locks out everyone.
---
This. So much so. If you haven't used something after a month you clearly don't fucking need it. There's no denying the game has issues but you know what's not going help? Someone walking around with a server's worth of shit on there person.
---
Something about "sweet" and "meat" makes me gag.  And the *way* she says it...she's practically drooling.
---
When the second shot lands you should see two damage numbers... A large one and a smaller one. The latter is the second shot landing. If you only saw one number you were missing one of the shots. Everybody is going to tell you the Junkies is better, and for good reasons... But at the end of the day it's the one YOU like to use that's going to be the best weapon for you.
---
The game has anywhere from 20-50k people online
---
Not really it was like 100 pounds and the only weight reduction I have is junk rat rank 1.
---
Skipping the dialog does not reliably prevent you from getting rep, but it seems to be one of the things which can cause it. The other known factor is Ward saying one of his generic lines or otherwise out-of-place dialogue lines while you're in conversation with him.
---
but pets are no structures...
---
Cuz fuck'em. That's why. Keep it all to yourself.
---
I mean in their defense, they are a LARGE company, and they have so many people to help, games to work on, and plus COVID-19 is limiting the amount of people who can be working for Bethesda‚Äôs Customer Service team.
---
I had like 100 pounds of junk that I use to repair and craft stuff every day.
---
Yeah I book marked it, just normally at work I just catch a few forum comments and hadn‚Äôt seen anything recently.  All good and thanks
---
Sounds like a fun and easy to implement idea to me.
---
A couple of things to note ... TS is generally much more inaccurate, and the 2nd shot dmg is ONLY on the base dmg not any modifiers/perks. 
---
Limb Damage is a good attribute, I love my limb dmg weapons in mobs as I get the rest limping whilst I concentrate on the nearest enemy.
---
I would go with the Junkies personally.
---
I wouldn't mind ammo scrap. Then we can craft what we do use, or sell it to someone
---
They / the other players (because I was hiding behind some trees like a coward - I couldn't figure out why my death kept restarting things so I was staying out of the way) did finish it successfully.
---
After it ended and I got over my "What just happened!?" panic / disbelief, I went back to my CAMP. Once I was safe inside those walls, I did start looking it up so the pieces started falling into place.
---
Power armor is a life saver for me.
---
It was really hard to see each of the numbers. That‚Äôs why I was guessing at the 560-590. I agree that it‚Äôs the one I like best. I‚Äôm trying to maximize my efficiency.
---
Nah, that‚Äôs not how those types of effects work in this game. Same reason when you craft ammo with ammosmith, and super duper procs, you don‚Äôt get 360% ammo, you get 280%. They work off the base amount separately, then add together. 
---
Whether you agree with that design choice or not is a different matter, but it‚Äôs seen in multiple places in the game logic.
---
I'm steering clear of the area for the time being. I'm traumatized. Of course, my husband still has to do the quest, but at least this time we'll be prepared!
---
All I know is Grampa needs to wipe better...
---
Sure but its still hell lot better than having 5k .38 on your stash and getting to attached to the mountain of useless ammo that you cant even drop it.
---
Did you pick up the prosnap camera from the dead tourist?

Sure they are.

"Fix PvP" isn't exactly a hot take. I don't see the point in making a post like this unless you've actually got suggestions to make it better. Writing a list of grievances doesn't really help anything.
---
I honestly think PvP in adventure is beyond saving. The demand is too low to justify the development resources it would take to balance it. I highly doubt the supposed balance pass coming after One Wasteland will address the imbalance either.
---
They removed survival mode, and NW is dying on the vine. It just doesn't seem like there is any desire at all from BGS to try and salvage PVP. I would not be surprised to see NW get removed in the coming months, and the complete removal of PvP soon after.
---
I guess maybe use the neon letters? You can get them from Grahm sometimes, or the ones in the Atomic Shop. But you couldn't put any of it on the survival tent. Keep taking care of those newbies thought! You are doing the good work!
---
There is an event in Eastern Penitentiary call Patrol Duty that rewards a random weapon plan every time you complete. I got many of my weapon plans there. Word is you can also get the handmade plan.
---
Dude you're being the karen expecting that people's camps should all be available to you.   And then fucking complaining they're not

I didn‚Äôt know that, wow. I always thought I was getting 360% more lol

Sure, I get that, however I put in a second ticket on the same matter, because I wasn't sure if I screwed up or not because the ticket is showing up under (Blank) for the Category and they closed the second Ticket as a duplicate three weeks ago, so they have been aware of my tickets for at the very least three weeks now.

I agree .45 subs shouldn't work with gun runner or modern renegade. The 45 sub doesn't have the best ttk by a long shot though. Ultracite laser, handmade, assault rifle and 10mm have better ttk. Even all 3 heavy guns have a better ttk. [Source](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gzuhC8yOxU6N8cDU4xLQwV2r4obU1Q_eb6d2Nf0AJsU/edit#gid=0)

No, I meant the instructions glued to the top right corner of the sceen...

I mean, chickens can be real bastards sometimes. Temperamental farm animals can be terrifying.
---
I think my funniest thing was when a scorched body got tangled in the shopping cart hanging around at the front of Camden Park and together, they swirled around and around in a strange waltz
---
I‚Äôve been trying to find that event, but it never seems to pop out for me. I don‚Äôt see any events in that area. Do I need to discover the penitentiary first?
---
Thay happens if the player who killed you has bloody mess equipped. You can do it to yourself. If you have life saving armor and down yourself with an explosive weapon and bloody mess equipped, sometimes it will glitch your bones out of your body
---
I really did think the first person who came along was a random chance of luck. I felt lucky that person was in the area. It wasn't until there were quite a few people that I realized it wasn't my good fortune that brought them to the area.
---
I won't be "helping" anyone for quite some time. I'm going to avoid the area for a while. lol
---
Nothing. Purveyor gives me combat knives and fatman launchers.
---
I cant even get a decent armor piece
---
&gt; It's a wonder we even have nukes going off considering the minor complexity required of running a silo but I guess that's helped by the lack of a time limit and ample access to step by step guides so simple a child can literally follow them
---
no, it's just that you can use exploits that were publicly known for i think over a year now to do it at no risk in under 10 minutes. If you had to run the actual silo, most high level players wouldn't even bother anymore
---
So how do you get the fire effect?
---
Everyone‚Äôs nice until I activate the Poseidon work bench...
---
I finished the main questline about a month ago. since then I have been role-playing as an loyal enclave sympathizer that believes that only they can bring the wasteland back to what it was before the war. i will randomly show kindness to new vault dwellers by giving them full sets of ultracite power armor and then giving them a small recruiting message and then be on my way.
---
I mean yeah, I do see how that is annoying. But I think the removable because of duplicate is just a bot checking the posts, however I do think that it is pretty annoying that there has been no contact what so ever. Good luck, hopefully you get an answer soon!
---
Thanks, but I gave up. I‚Äôm a stealth sniper now.
---
I heard how they reacted so dis tastefully so i kept that sh** . Easy to get rep but free 500 gold on my scale was worth it!!!!
---
But you do have a hoarding problem
---
It's really, really irritating at this point. Other users on the forums have been expressing their issues with Support too, like a user being told to Power Cycle her console when she's on PC.
---
I haven't seen you on NW in a long time. You still play?
---
Junkies fixer, best luck of my life and since I'm not a junkies build just sold it for the first guy who made a offer of 5.56, lucky guy cuz the rest of the offers were way higher than his üòÇ
---
The novelty wears off, still grenades and explosive weapons make it more fun
---
I might try that - you run a bloodied lmg ?
---
I was mostly just highlighting the mechanism that causes it to occur because devs need that information to fix it.
---
In terms of preventative, that's a solid suggestion (but still situationally impractical as it still leaves you vulnerable during the hotswap) - for my part I've just gotten really careful about taking aim after sprinting. Funny that I've never encountered it in Adventure mode. Definitely a NW bug that needs to be fixed.
---
Ouch, yeah that‚Äôs a big F. Tbh I haven‚Äôt played any fallout or Bethesda games in a long time, so I haven‚Äôt actually experienced their customer support, although that is very sad. I hope you get some assistance with your issue. Have a good day!

As much as I dont want to leave my legendaries and mutations behind I think this would be a huge success.
---
what he is saying IS true.  it is not a nature of hard events, __since hard events are easy if you can read.__ as an example, tell me which objective is hard:
---
- defend 3 brahmin
---
- defend scavvers
---
- collect ore
---
- press a button to activate pylon
---
*as a reminder, these are ALL on screen*
---
defenders of vault 94 know how to __separate server issues from the raids issues.__   vaults are gone but you know what still exists? all the server issues.
---
wanna talk about vaults actual problems? like unkillable ghouls spawning inside pipes/the geck, doors being perma closed for some users, pump codes you cant get because they spawn inside objects, or god forbid you run into the reactor not spawning items properly.  __all those problems gone now.__
---
no though, i guess we are throwing broken terminals (everywhere) as a vault problem, or pipes not repairing (silo/reactor) is a vault problem, or slow objective loading (questmarkers) as a vault problem.  __all these problems have existed and continue to exist__  *but nah, those problems are totally the raids fault, lets just ignore them instead of asking for them to be fixed /s*
---
you dont throw out a low battery beeping smoke alarm when the kitchens on fire
---
edit: another great example of separation of issues, raids ran near flawlessly on private/survival servers outside of the actual examples provided.  *"but muh server problems are the raids fault"*

I don't get how they're even Raiders. They're running a legit business that isn't a front for anything. Working instead of stealing.

Thank you, I hope to get some assistance too sooner or later. Have a great day yourself.
---
I noted concrete issues and some of them are fixable with just a simple hot fix pvp isn‚Äôt getting removed if they don‚Äôt want a uproar in the community
---
You're right, I haven't played in a while. Got on with wastelanders update to try out the bow and SAH fix for a bit. I still like the mode except for frog legs.
---
Very easy to cantilever upper floors over lower ones as awnings.

is that collapsing  cave entry and swallowing your junk event or other one?
---
If by 'countless' you mean a dozen, then yes. You're in the minority, sorry chief.
---
Good, show them with your money, but please don't complain on a Reddit mainly consisting of players where anyone from Bethesda rarely ever looks because at that point you are just pissing into the wind. It pointless and probably just gonna cause a mess üòÇ
---
Different player, but I can also confirm this has been happening for a few months. I managed to even get a [picture of it](https://imgur.com/n5URPh3) during the fasnacht parade. The one I am currently using is a two shot experimental MIRV, but shooting it broke the instigating fat man in my inventory. Both are equipped with the vault tec paint. I also think that durability isn't even draining from the one I'm using, because I remember the heavy explosive weapons have pathetic durability but I never really have to repair mine anymore. Bnet username is papa_shekels
---
This was just in another post. You need to have the jetpack plan unlocked first.
---
We could not talk about that bug in hopes it doesn't get fixed.
---
Nocturnal rolling pin
---
ahm... well... i stand corrected... o.O you learn something new every day :D
---
Yes indeed. It also would give greater emphasis to trading with other players. By minimizing stash use, I would have to offload legendary weapons that don't fit my play style much more frequently than I currently do.
---
I love my vampires ultracite gatling laser. Throw on tesla coils and not only are you immortal but you get to loot everything later. And 1000 rounds per core goes a long way.
---
Have you ever done that?
---
uhm just like it works right now, if a spot is taken, the user is given the prompt to try again or join the server...  
---
The difference being the user isn't forced to load the entire server before being given the prompt.
---
Nice list. Can you add the melee stim bug to the list? There's nothing worse than stopping dead to use a stim. Trying to heal shouldn't get me killed every time.
---
Also terror stop throwing grenades so much\~
---
To cry on this sub
---
Ya that's why I'm thinking PA needs love, we've seen the normal armor get backpacks and now frickin jetpacks.
---
I think rather than trying to just add legendary effects to PA maybe they could revamp the mod system, go for more of a sciencey / engineering approach where you modify the armor for different tasks ala Iron Man.  
---
e.g. they've got stuff that improves the unarmed PA damage but it sucks - maybe completely replace an arm with a giant melee weapon.  The downside would be you couldn't even wield a gun until you swap that armor piece out.
---
You can complete it solo if you leave the perch to grab ore with about 90 seconds left. You‚Äôll probably lose a few scavengers, but you won‚Äôt fail it.
---
Maybe she loves the Mirelurk meat
---
So SS is likely sturdy (buttressed) but scout armor might likely be heavy (polymer) then?  Seriously FML!

---
I've always been told that hippies are dirty and assumed that to mean filthy, until now...
---
I like PVP and I like NW, but I acknowledge this puts me in the minority of players. I don't think outrage from a few hundred players (tops) will sway BGS if it means saving development time and money.  The game has been on a PVE only Trajectory for a while now.
---
This is exactly i try to test my own weapons instead of holding other‚Äôs conclusions as absolute truth. As you know the color of your socks can affect your weapons‚Äô performance in this game. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt trust others‚Äô opinions, there‚Äôs simply too many variables that can contribute to how things work for YOU. If the TS works better for you, definitely go for it. Lots of vats users hate it but personally I find it more powerful than most other legendary effects.
---
And on rare occasion, clothes.
---
Cause too many cried about PvP.
---
countless = 5... jk, but pvp will never really work in this game, at least in the adventure mode.
---
TS gives a 25% damage increase while junkies gives 50% damage increase. The math says junkies is better as well as not suffering the accuracy penalty that TS has.
---
Doss this way work? Might try it
---
Every once in a while when im bored i might toss an artillery strike at someone's camp just to see the confusion. Cant hurt anything though, just for laughs.
---
Yes, just don't buy the PS5 digital if you want to play old disc games
---
That's all I see in almost every game sub these days.
---
The best gun that I got from the purveyor was a gun that‚Äôs called disappointment
---
still don't know if this or the extended limbs is my favourite glitch lmao
---
1 value point is really good, even if you manually switch targets. It prevents vats from closing between kills which can really up your effectiveness, plus the damage isnt bad at 10% for 1 perk point.
---
I run two characters. One is a PA build, the other isn‚Äôt. I honestly hate my PA build one sometimes. The constant search for fusion cores just to move, the smaller carry capacity, the lack of mobility, the absolute level of squish in PVP. It sucks. The only redeeming quality to it is my rock-hard erection as I unload a .50cal into the face of the scorchbeast queen. Otherwise I would nix it completely.
---
Quad FFR Tesla (it's 3 star, forget the third effect atm) I've named it "Thors Eye", it might now be the best per se, as I have had several TS/E but not to fit my build at that time.
---
Fought other teams? Hell yeah it‚Äôs fun af
---
At rank 1 absolutely, beyond that there are better perks to invest in.
---
Im a rifle build but i threw on one rank just to deal with mobs of ghouls and such last night. So far I love it.
---
no one says PA is bad, it just isn't nearly as good as it should be. there is no situation in which non-power armour should outclass power armour, except perhaps in agility, which can't be faithfully translated to ingame without just straight up buffing non-power armour even more.
---
there's also the weight thing, i should not be stuck at 240 carry weight in PA but have 310 without it just because i have a backpack,  *all* PA should give at the very *least* a 100 carry weight bonus, excavator should give 200 +. i'm not a fan of adding legendary PA pieces because i don't really want to have to play the slot machines for the forseeable future, but PA needs some serious buffs
---
Swing speed absolutely affects regular attacks as well - combined with martial artist you can \*really\* get some stabbin' goin' with a knife.
---
It‚Äôs useful but I wouldn‚Äôt put more than 1 point into it. The only problem I have with it is there is a bit of a lag before it switches targets so I reflexively start turning the right stick and end up changing my target from head to left arm.
---
Well it did work before. I have been around since beta, and the whole game‚Äôs life they have been slowly removing the pvp content and fucking replacing it with a garbage battle royal.
---
I did that on a public, and surprisingly no one interrupted my farming. But you can do it on either. Most players either don‚Äôt know you can farm them, or just don‚Äôt like to though.
---
Just build lol
---
I just go into the basement do a little fighting collect all the plants I need and I leave I don't worry about the event. I just want my formula p.
---
Good strategy. Worked good during Fastnacht and should have worked (but by some reason I didn‚Äôt see the effect) during Project Paradise.
---
Try to get her to focus you then run away from the bunker/tents that chumps like to stand on. Kinda funny you see level 100+ players doing that garbage.
---
This game has a poor design for low level gear.
---
While you try to farm or to find low level pieces, you will level up, so when you finally get them, they will probably be obsolete for your character.
---
The best bet to use low/medium level gear is to buy it from other players, exactly when you reach the targeted level.
---
Another solid way, for more involved players, is to have a main character, good crafter, capable to provide gear to other leveling characters.
---
great idea thank you, i coulnt scrap mine for some reason so now in use.
---
Sir, I pvp a lot. Like everyday, I am trying to shoot everyone I cross roads with. I fought godmode players twice. This is a very very rare occurrence. Most godmoders do it for the exp and thats it.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox sadly thanks for offering though
---
The thing that really pissed me off was how Meg flipped out when I gave a cut to Foundation. It was just Shitbag Johnny Weston's cut. The dude she forced on me that betrayed me after doing literally nothing to help complete the mission. She wasn't out a penny.

Lucky hole mine + Path to Enlightenment. And recently Fastnacht was a good source of acid.

If you use VATS extensively, yes. Otherwise Adrenaline is a better choice.

"Whats that? Our medical scanners thief was at fissure site prime mid nuke and you had to fight a scorchbeast queen to get it back? er, shit here, have a lightweight leather left arm.."

really? i hate my bow build. haha. got a sweet bloodied bow, level 66, all bow perks. i tested a sneak through white springs. doing 1800+ damage w sneak headshots....but missing with 95% vats shots a lot.

---
Oh, right, reasons.
---
At least put Grandpa in Boxers.
---
Hey, man, don't blame her options are slim...
---
I just wish i could find one that players will go to, I've played 1 since it came out due to nobody wanting to do it.
---
Because a lot of us just like PA. We aren't constantly posting on reddit or anywhere saying we like it. The majority of the times I see the PA sucks posts and just shrug and move on because I don't care what they think. I'm not trying to be a meta player. Just have fun. The Fallout series has always put PA on a pedestal as amazing to have and it gives a nice big stonpy feeling akin to a walking tank.
---
For all non pvpers who have been around since beta: What do you do in game to find a challenge? None of the pve content is challenging to me or the people I play with. What keeps us logging in is trying to beat other groups. If that goes away say bye bye to the mostly silent, larger than expected, pvp group. 
---
I know I‚Äôm pissing in the wind, but god damn I‚Äôm not the only one.
---
I might now, but I don't think it did during Beta. But I could be wrong.
---
Just meet them at a workshop and have both team initiate a claim. This even makes it more formal as your have boundaries to stay within. Honestly don't see the issue here.
---
Honestly it should return and there should nothing to gain but xp to ensure it's actual pvp as well.
---
However I think the thing that's been hurting pvp so much is the fact that the only pvp that people take part in is nuclear winter and workshops.
---
For some reason hunter/hunted, monster mash in watoga, and the battle that never was at prickett's fort never get much attention.
---
 I've even seen people waiting for hunter/hunted to kick for a couple hours before. I think it Usually gets disregarded because pvp only gets any attention when it comes to grieving others most of the time anyway. 
---
The grief also gives alot of new players and low levels a bad experience so they're less likely to be Interested when they do get to a point where they can obtain proper gear for pvp.
---
That's just my theory though.

50% dmg boost at 5 addictions, vs a 25% dmg boost, a debuff to accuracy, and a chance to miss with your 2nd shot to not do any additional dmg.
---
you never needed PA for nuke zones, i was a melee build before i switched to heavy weapon PA and i was able to survive just fine in nuke zones with DR perks (didn't have to compromise damage - they were always active) and a hazmat suit, the hazmat suit broke pretty quickly but as long as i didnt unequip it i kept the radiation resistance. i didn't even use legendary armour pieces ( and when i did, only one ) until i was almost done with melee and switched to PA, i took way less damage with my melee build in spite of these facts.
---
Well, I RP. My "Loner" character who ends up taking in stray people and helping them out, sorta like taking in stray cats. If a lowbie comes up to my camp, it's a diner/bar and shop, so there's usually a bag of food/chems/ammo/clothing/weapons on one of the tables for them to pick through. She's a mechanic by trade and I'll craft PA for em if they ask, or some under armor. Then when my buddy's on we'll go run the events. I like hunting down magazines and bobble heads to sell (I just finished the live and love and Tales of the West Virginia Hills collection!). Then I make little tweeks to my camp, or rebuild, depending on the mood.
---
And if I get bored, I tab out and continue writing the story I'm working on. Sure, there's lulls in the storyline as we wait for the BoS to come in, but it's still fun by other means!
---
Ya it's a pain to deal with sometimes, especially if they have explosives. If they get the first shot off with a tube or gauss shotty, you're screwed. I'd probably be fine with frog legs if explosives didn't exist.
---
The issue is that there‚Äôs no point of even taking workshops the whole incentive of them being in the game was to promote pvp and they‚Äôve been nerfed to the point they‚Äôre not worth claiming anymore they‚Äôre a waste of time
---
The truth is. Fallout 76 was rigged from the start... *bang*
---
They cycle often, though it may take a bit till it comes back.

Back from what? It was never in the game files as a model.

---
I normally only get a 3-4 hours once or twice a week if I'm lucky, so I'm still grinding thru tryin to get some levels.
---
I try to at least get two missions done per session. I find myself having to waste valuable time at this level looting crafting supplies for better weapons and the excavator armor right now as I'm between level 25 and 30 so I'm starting to get my hands on actual good armors and weapons.
---
I run gunfu @2* and adrenaline @3*
---
I've had it happen from taking a significant amount of damage from legacy weapons (explosive lasers and such) but I've also had it happen when I got smacked in the Imposter sheepsquatch event. I was killed by the sheepsquatch while standing in his fire, and when I respawned, had the fire effect.  I also had it on my gun when I went in first person
---
I'd completely forgotten about this film til you mentioned it, batshit crazy, haven't seen it in years. Yes to the toothy gun idea
---
My problem with all these posts neglect one thing.
---
Majority of the player base is bloodied, mostly running unyielding. I know for my situation personally, is that my stash is crammed full, im carrying 390/395 in my inventory, i just CANT get ore without it being an ap waitin/losing slog through rads.
---
Same with encryptid. I would get the pylons, but i die almost instantly.
---
I have thought many times to switching my build to something full health, if only to be able to collect ore/activate pylons.
---
I'm really looking forward to decreased load times.  Jealous of how quickly PC users get to start playing after fast traveling somewhere.
---
That rifle skin is much less detailed on ps4. And that settler outfit is a mod right? I don't remember any ouftit like that in game.
---
Rank 1 is absolutely worth the investment. It saved me so many times. I'm a stealth sniper build. It's just that good. After sharing this perk, I think my friends picked it up because they didn't know what they were missing. 
---
Having the game auto swap vats targets can be frustrating some times, but I find it's more worth it. I can drop 5 targets before my friends can target their 2nd one.
---
Me too, are you confident it‚Äôll be updated then?
---
Would be cool tho, I enjoy the little PvP the game has
---
even then, i see a lot of people at queen fights running non-PA heavy weapons builds
---
The criticism of the bullion grind is absolutely legitimate, but people should keep in mind:
---
This is an MMORPG.  MMORPGs don't have endgames - they have expansions.  What you're experiencing now is the same thing any of us who played EverQuest or World of Warcraft first experienced 15-20 years ago.
---
The only reason there's anything to grind out is because the devs want you to have \*something\* to do while they furiously generate new content.  New content takes a long time to produce - Wastelanders was probably starting its development cycle slightly before the initial release of Fallout 76.
---
Bethesda has two things it's known for:  Crazy, often-hilarious bugs (praise be my screen capture library), and deep storytelling that compels you to see things through to the end.  We need to be patient if we keep wanting more, especially at the low-low cost of Free.
---
every time you get the daily quest it puts the syringer in your inventory
---
bugs + exploits + malicious players = ripped players?

Sounds delightful!

So an exterminator‚Äôs pipe pistol?
---
Alternately you can run the party boy perk and just drink liquor.
---
Whiskey giving a strength bonus of +6 is pretty great. And the new Cranberry Moonshine is good as well.
---
I started a new character when Wastelanders came out and after finishing everything I went back to my main and did the Wastelanders quests only to realize there's basically nothing in the bullion shops that she needs. I suppose I could get the SS armor, but I don't really want to just do the same handful of quests that give you bullion every day. Considering the lack of good one handed melee weapons it's super disappointing that they didn't add one to Wastelanders. The cattle prod? I'll just stick with my 40% swing speed machete, thanks.

Right, but once update 20 drops you can meet with the team you want to duel and fight there. I'm assuming these are people you've organized with?
---
it's also possible that some people just like big utes, but you know, this guy says it's compensation because someone can't like something he doesn't unless they have something to compensate for.
---
I can help out. Only thing I ask is you check out my vendors and see if there is anything you‚Äôd like to purchase.  No purchase necessary.
---
What is with this Water purifier obsession? I see it everywhere. Is it a caps thing?
---
A E S T H E T I C S
---
Yeah, I wish it had just been a sack backpack instead of that metal frame but oh well. I still think the raider pillager backpack looks the best üëå
---
I seriously don‚Äôt get why people are expecting a video game to satisfy their every need. People expectations have become too high
---
The display of the SBQ loot on her corpse is indeed buggy. It can have a very long delay sometimes.  If you don't see anything on the first check try again a couple of minutes later before you head out elsewhere.
---
So kind...lol.
---
The one with the collapsing cave is called Lode Baring.
---
Sounds like one of the ‚Äòmagic weapons‚Äô. No hacking needed; just a bad design by Bethesda.
---
Turns out you have to return by closing the game and they will then hopefully spawn for you, hope this helps
---
No I‚Äôm talking about my friend and I being on a team we can‚Äôt start pvp with another team even if the other team wants to too like wtf
---
That'd be great, thanks! I'll PM you my character name. I'll come to your camp.
---
But I'm not really complaining, just asking a question.
---
But I now understand the many reasons people lock up their camps.
---
Hope you're not a teacher, you'd eliminate students everyday for asking questions.
---
It's kind of a meme at this point. Salt on the wound is all the promo stuff that features it, like the blue nuclear winter camo.
---
It doesn‚Äôt but that‚Äôs Bethesda for you. 
---
Just take my word for it, as it‚Äôs shit design, but you need to do roughly 10k damage or no loot for you.
---
If its doing that you have a glitch of some kind then. I've done the quest 3-4 times since they made it trigger reliably and i have to go to the terminal, pickup the Syringer from a container and once im done put it back. Next day if the event triggers again i still have to go start the actual mission and get the Syringer from the container.
---
really? i've found that gauss shotguns are pretty bad in NW, although that could just be the shitty hit registration
---
People act like spontaneous team v team pvp is super popular. Unless you've pre-communicated with these people, that just sounds like griefing to me.
---
Someone in the player faction I am in is like level 700 just insane
---
There's nothing wrong with getting what you pay for, but making demands, insulting developers and their product just to get what they want is childish. The loud minority of toxic gamers are their own sub-product of Karens themselves. 
---
Like, c'mon man, it's a game. Play a different one you enjoy more, or go make your own video game if you think you could do better.
---
Citation needed.
---
find a camp with a resource node and cryptid kill - the crypid will drop resources and weapons to sell etc  
---
I have had acid+grafton, junk+deathclaw and acid+random spawn of sheep/deathclaw encounter  
---
Also oil farming is great money for crafting those new outfit patterns from mole miner hunter event, 1 oil 3 cloth = 29 caps to vendor bot  
---
Right now my 3 accounts are parked on:  
---
Deathclaw+junk, Supermutant behemoth, oil+steakhouse(not cryptids but there is a lot of junk/ammo/exp in there also a fissure nearby as well for some scorch beasts and I turn the 5 oil every 15 minutes into 5-10 outfits depending on superduper procs
---
Why don‚Äôt you just turn on pacifist and be done with it then?
---
It's splits the damage between the two. Should be seeing 2 identical numbers 62.5% of the base damage. You might be thinking about tse. You'll see 4 numbers, it's the same two at 62.5 and 2 explosive numbers that'll vary with whatever you have demolition perk set at.
---
Shit design by a shit team of shit developers. 
---
Honest answer. 
---
The whole game is half assed, so why pick just one thing to wonder about.
---
Never happened to my tiny camp, guess I'm just lucky?
---
Just did this event last week not knowing what I was getting into.  Guy I was playing with helped a lot and we had about a dozen other players join in.  Beat the Imposter with 10 seconds left.  Won't be doing that again for a while.
---
when i load in after starting the game it seems to happen, but then again i load in and my weapon can't register the ammo in my inventory until i unequip and requip it anyway so that's the more pressing issue if i forget to do so before i try and shoot anything
---
Like kix, kid tested mother approved.
---
I don't think it will need to be, at least not to take advantage of some of the hardware designs in the new consoles.  For example, they'll have SSDs which will allow the game to pull data more quickly from storage when traveling to a new area.  The gains might not be astronomical, but loading screens \*should\* become lessened simply by upgrading to the new console, which should already be backwards compatible for current titles.  Barring any weird incompatibilities that prevent the game from functioning at all, playing on a next gen console should see some noticeable performance gains.  This may be further optimized as Bethesda releases patches for the game to account for the new hardware.
---
It's not bugs its called specail features
---
Tanagra Town is the easiest and best. The center of the place is full of Gold and Crystal veins that you can mine with Excavator PA and the center is also full of Cave Crickets to kill for acid.
---
Because aesthetic is more important than functionality, as the God Emperor decrees
---
Or leaving it in a vendor and not ditching it while you hang on to the faint hope that somebody will buy your 5000 rounds of .38
---
Why shouldn't we deposit the ore? Does it spawn in more enemies?
---
For me it was kind of a prestige piece for clearing the vault. Unless really lucky it took some attempts to clear it quickly with a pug group so usually a sign of alot of effort and pretty decent understanding of the games mechanics, your build, and teamwork.
---
Makes sense it going to cost a little much after the effort that was usually needed to clear that content.
---
Bonkers film. Highly Cronenbergy.
---
My nuka nades :‚Äô( thanks for heads up
---
I swear the "Claim Workshop ..." pops up if you even look in that direction.
---
I also have events set to auto enabled, and only about 1/2 of them show up on screen. I have to go to the pipboy an activate several every single time.
---
Just skip to the second part and cut the first part out. 
---
We‚Äôre all asking ourselves the same question for various reasons. 
---
Sorry fallout isn‚Äôt and never will be, a successful fortnite clone - that‚Äôs just not what this ip is about.
---
Are you on PC? If so you have access to the public test server.
---
No they don't lol, threw like 6 bundles of dynamite at one yesterday while she was grounded for big boy damage 
---
At least for a splosion build it was big boy
---
Oh trust me I do. People shooting me, trying to goad me into pvp, so their 3 friends can dogpile me isn't my idea of a fair fight. That's the only thing that is getting patched out as far as I'm concerned, and I say good riddance.
---
i play solo, farm events and build my camp. waiting in the hope that the next dlc will be better.
---
Yes absolutely and content will only get worse as we edge closer to Starfield
---
He's just out for a stroll, taking in the sights.
---
I'm waiting for the Thanksgiving display shelf that can hold 6 items to return. I suspect I am going to have to wait until next Thanksgiving. Lol.
---
This is why I don't use it. It's way too slow to switch off from a dead enemy onto the next.
---
I said grenades, didn't test out dynamite tho
---
This. It‚Äôs childish and those people are immature. At the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game made by people, there will be mistakes here and there. My perspective on life is this, don‚Äôt let what you can‚Äôt  control, control your attitude towards said thing.
---
Savage Divide has some nice overlooks, particularly of the forest. May want to meander about on the western cliffs and see if anything catches your eye. I‚Äôm also partial to camping near lakes and streams if I find a good spot. If the spot has a resource node, that‚Äôs even better.
---
Junkies explosive combat rifle. 
---
Or TSE handmade. I know people hate on TSE these days but it was a cool drop.
---
You have to be in combat for your character to enter or exit quickly
---
Unarmed can be quick with vats.  Just needx to down a sunshine oil, quantum, or similar first. My bloodied build with adrenaline and grim reaper sprint on can do the room. The problem is I can't go down and grab anything like that, and people seem most unwilling to.
---
No seriously, show me where you can prove explosives make the queen flee. That doesn't make sense.
---
I got a 3\* Legendary Two-Shot Blackpowder Rifle with 25% faster reloading and faster movement speed while aiming: I got it last night!
---
That's awesome!
---
Sometimes I've been able to cheat by using a 1x1 floor and using it to intersect another wall in the middle
---
I don't think it's intended because it doesn't work most of the time, but its been useful whenever it did work for me
---
Equip Blocker and they become chumps.
---
That's because you're not going to get armor choosing melee and ranged weapons. Try choosing armor. lol
---
I play on and off. Collect my gold and scrip and roll some gear, maybe play NW if friends are on or collect a specific resource if low on something, probably do dailes. Then play something else.
---
Junkies. No question. Don‚Äôt even need to read post.
---
What perk is that?
---
Dynamite is basically identical to a mirv grenade in practice tho
---
Also nuka nades
---
Kellogg's revolver had it in Fallout 4.
---
It's under Strength. Reduces melee damage by 45%
---
This is awesome. 
---
I was doing one with some lower levels the other day (I'm 288 and the rest were a 191 and 4 others between 45  and 90). We had 35 seconds left and she had 1/2 left in her last bar. She finally landed and we all leaped towards her and killed her with 4 seconds left! Such an awesome feeling. We were all freaking out.
---
QFFRFR Gamma Gun. It's my little bloodied killer :)
---
I really wish they just made that standard speed.
---
I'll check it out.
---
I have anecdotal evidence that the queen is glitched by any build that doesn‚Äôt conform to my play style. You should all play like me.
---
Very good advice.  Thanks.  I will probably do my best to avoid explosive weapons for the time being.
---
They adjusted the backpack placement with the recent backpack vanity update, even made some backpacks appear smaller. Not limited to the mothman backpack
---
Hopefully the next patch will fix it
---
Purified water with vendor perk card can net you a few 100 a day easily
---
It's super underrated. Ghouls will tickle you with it, literally halves their damage and that is *before* resistances so its probably closer to 75% reduction if you have decent armor.
---
I'm a melee build, grab some fusion cells and a Tesla with the automatic mod. It's an excellent weapon for tagging in events. That's what I do to not steamroll things in events
---
I was actually offended the first time I went to talk to Meg after finishing the main quest with the Raiders and she treated me like shit. What a bitch, we've been through so much together...I deserve some friendly lines
---
Honestly it‚Äôs just killing what‚Äôs left of the pvp community
---
Thank you. Will try it that too.
---
Wait... how did you lost a months worth of junk? Do you never go to your stash? That‚Äôs on you.
---
I am gonna defile the corpse of every feral ghoul after equipping that perk.
---
Sure will.  As long as they can make more money they will cycle old stuff back through.
---
And what happens if there is more than one person querying the server to see if there is someone there and another person finishes loading in first. It‚Äôs not so easy to code, especially when people server hop.  You can overburden the servers with queries that don‚Äôt end up accomplishing anything since the game state can be different by the time you load in.
---
It's either a behemoth glitching through a wall, or a heartfelt story of sacrifice
---
Yeah, I get it.  I'm too picky.  I'm looking for a gal that can make mole miner noises in bed.
---
Did the same thing here, only with a power door linked to pressure plates. It‚Äôs broken, for a long while I‚Äôve been told.
---
I want that legendary perk.
---
To be clear Im talking about getting all of the plans.  You have to be neighborly with a faction to get the compound bow and everything associated with it.
---
Just because you believe something doesn't mean it's a fact.
---
Step 1: Ignore the event like encrypted
---
 I use Daguierre's AB to tag (does like 20 damage, even with a full bloody build), but if people are dragging their feet and the damn legendary hasn't died in like 30 seconds I'm gonna put the thing out of its misery. For me, it's just as exhausting to have to coddle oblivious players as it is frustrating to have a legendary get 1 shot. Just my two cents as a patient (but not saintly) bloodied build.
---
Aww I love my little Mothman. He watches my back for me!
---
Why specifically do you want it at level 15? Do you not plan on leveling? You can outgrow that set in like 4 hours of gameplay.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one that does this, lol.
---
On those occasions where it doesn't lag out though, man is it a great perk lol. Clearing out the SBQ adds in like 30 seconds never gets old.
---
The plans for the mods are sold for caps.
---
Probably the same reason anal is considered taboo, yet get on any website and it seems rather sought after material
---
It was actually a bug with the purveyor a while back, did they fuck up again and reintroduce it?
---
When I'm at my base it's completely open, when I roam only the front room for vending is open
---
I will occasionally craft a gun that uses some ammo that I have a ton of, and use that for a while, to try to justify it to myself.
---
I once found a flat woods monster in there, just on it's own.  I wonder if theres a lingering cryptid spawn point or something, as I only ever saw it once in countless runs.
---
Nooooo don‚Äôt avoid the event, go for it as soon as you see it pops up. This event can drop the valuable plan for the Fixer rifle, only after learning the plan you get the chance to acquire it from the purveyor.
---
There's the pink power armor.
---
Amazing, thanks very much for your help. And your camp is fantastic, well worth the visit for the unique location, as well as your vendor items!
---
Honestly PvP has been on hospice for a while now. Gotta pull the plug eventually.
---
I know that I just would like to have a power armor.
---
West Tek seems to spawn in Cryptids now. I found 3 Flatwoods Monsters, one Wendigo, and now a Sheepsquatch. I guess it may be a matter of time til I find a Mothman.
---
I've also only seen a small amount of godmoders. Been accused of it a good few times thanks to the influx of newer players and even experienced not knowing about sentinels assassins gear. :(
---
Bugged for me again. Not sure why. It was working fine for a couple of weeks, now I can‚Äôt get him to engage in dialogue. Usually try to buy on Mondays.
---
No problem! I‚Äôm glad I could help! Thanks for the kind words :)
---
So why are you here?
---
I can't believe this has 9 upvotes and no comments üòÇ that would have scared the shit out of me!!!
---
Well you get a full set from rose‚Äôs questline. Not sure what level it is though. Honestly I would not worry about power armor at level 15. More hassle than it is worth.
---
I gave some gold to Gentleman Johnny with the intention on killing him after but I forgot that I can't do that. I hate him so much. Everytime I'm at the core I leave some spoiled meat in front of him.
---
I want to kill him so bad
---
Oh okay so fuck everyone who wants to actually do something other than collect junk and do daily quests right?
---
You can buy the grape from Bubbles in the Whitesprings, or try your luck with the random spawns in the frat house. I had to buy Orange because it never showed up there for me.
---
I pick up everything, too. I was awful in Fallout 3! I'm going to pick up every teddy bear I find and pile them all up on my bed. Oh, and let's collect harmonicas and put them on this shelf... And just how many coffee cups ARE there in this world? Let's find out!!
---
Thatta boy!
---
I keep getting limb damage powerfists and I remember Beth messing up the rolls before. I'd say based on track record there's definitely a chance they've messed up!
---
Its a new jetpack mod, unfortunately, you cant use it on an existing arm-pack. Tried it with my old strangler heart and it only works on a torso.
---
Works great for the Gatling plasma and Gatling laser
---
I'd be down with that. But I'd also like them to do another 3XP weekend.
---
Hahaha! I did the same exact thing when I first did the questline. I had no idea it ended with a major event, so I was unprepared.
---
I just pulled five TS pieces from my mule and gave it a try yesterday. They are indeed very effective, I died way less than before when I was wearing unyieldings. I didn‚Äôt use any mitigation perks such as blocker and serendipity, i imagine i won‚Äôt die at all had i put those on.
---
Thx for the share. This was a great story. Had me laughing with the lecel 30 breaking out the tire iron. A Wastelander has to do whar a Wastelander has to do.  By chance what system you running on?
---
I really enjoy the dramatic slow entrance sometimes, have it hold for slow entrance double tap for quick entrance. That way both parties win.
---
Easy enough to do in the camp, and I set up near the  vault for the Christmas event.
---
Most of the time it isn't of much value to build my camp nearby 76.
---
Being able to leave a message at a fallout 1st tent however, would let someone cheaply set up in the forest where the noobs can safely see it.
---
Otherwise I can just keep sending chat messages to them, but I'm not always in a good spot to look for level 1s near the vault in the map üòâ
---
I‚Äôll have to check, because now that you mention it I do notice I‚Äôve gotten a lot of limb damage weapons recently. Not sure if it‚Äôs every time for me though, I keep a lot of the melee weapons I get cause it‚Äôs just lightweight scrip to me, so I‚Äôll check my stash.
---
Also you get emotionally attached..
---
You can also buy the component you need to create the recall circuit from most vendors and redo the final event. There's some really cool, worthwhile items you can only get from this event, so it's worth showing up and helping.
---
A couple of hundred rounds, eh.
---
This is one weapon mod I‚Äôm super waiting on!!! Please bring it back!!!!
---
I‚Äôve got a lot of hours in this but now it‚Äôs just an hourly chore to get bullion a day(when I remember anyway)and that‚Äôs it. What you suggest is a nice idea and I highly doubt they‚Äôll ever do something like this.
---
Or could be an option you could turn on/off ‚ÄúFast Power Armor entry‚Äù or something
---
The level 30 with a tire iron takes this story from a 9 to a 10. I love it.
---
man, fo76 can't even build simple objectives. am i triggering this objective wrong? wrong trigger. or triggering at wrong time. or just bugged objectives. i don't want to run thru all the steps of a quest 3 times to trigger all the events right. especially if they're just throw-away quests and not even a good chain.
---
I would enjoy a harder survival server, but it would have to be where food/drink was made more important, diseases were more detrimental, and things like crafting your own weapons actually mattered - and you can‚Äôt be using your normal game character.  
---
I think legendary items could have a place, but it would have to be named legendary items, not RNG based but things like the quest rewards.  It would be easier to balance with them in mind.
---
Agreed, so few items and only so few letters for each one‚Äôs name, this is just pathetic.
---
Oh, for me a new one appears and it has to live with it's dead brother's corpse until I log out
---
Why insert bloodied builds into it? Dicks are dicks, regardless of build.
---
I wasn't aware that they did a fix. All I know was every time I logged into any server the first thing that would happen is I would get a string of daily quests added to my queue a long with the syringer getting shoved in my inventory. It was really bad if I was running low on space and would become overencumbered because of it. 
---
If they fixed it that is great, but I am still not willing to trust it because I was stuck with a syringer for months.
---
Would we really want to live in a world where we didn‚Äôt have both? I don‚Äôt think so!
---
That sounds boring as hell. They are just selling us something broken and then charging us for the fix or any additional features. What a scam this game really is. Think of how much cool pve content they could have delivered. Fun, challenging dungeons, bigger better world bosses, etc. I doubt we will see anything promising actually come to this game.
---
My plan is to have sex with every creature in the game. Snallygaster is next! Then maybe Ward...
---
Counter Point: Why should BGS devote time and resources to appease a tiny fraction of the playerbase? This is a question they have likely asked themselves, since the steady scaling back of PvP features is already apparent. Frankly, daily quests and gathering junk is a large part of the core experience, and those are activities that the vast majority of players care about. These changes are inevitable, and I doubt the scaling back of PvP stops with update 20.
---
It‚Äôs a cosmetic, something to grind for once you have everything else that actually serves a purpose.
---
Not me! You have to talk by all my camp awesomeness to get to the vendors. I only have 4 craft stations in my camp, the 4 I use. Tinker, Armor and weapon benches, and chemist station.
---
i highly doubt bethesda would invent time into overhauling the game for itot run better. the game is over a year old and they still haven't fixed day one issues.
---
I really started this game after these were added. I didn't know the Burrows was a special thing until like a couple of months before Wastelanders drop. I saw it as an undiscovered location, but figured it was just another instance to explore eventually like all the rest. When I did do it, I didn't even realize it was a special thing they added post launch. Because it did exactly what I thought it was, it felt like another instance like all the rest. 
---
This thread is honestly the first time I've seen it mentioned as something special. I had no idea.
---
I couldn't manage helping and staying alive at the same time. It seemed literally impossible. Though, I'll have to see about using troubleshooting armor (as was mentioned). I certainly appreciate that it's not easy though, and it wasn't just a failure on my part.
---
If you didn't do 1k+ damage you've not going to get loot. A couple hundred rounds and some melee hits likely wasn't enough damage.
---
Simple and utilitarian, I love my Seedy Shed has everything I need and always moves easily.
---
I approve!
---
Lol, I think many folks found out about this event this way. I play with 2 others and we first hit this event around level 70-80 and had no idea what to expect. Nobody came and we got destroyed. Now we jump to as soon as it pops up. We are all level 140-150 now and it goes much better, although we still need help.
---
I think it consistently spawns there, because that house is a reference to Monster Factory's "Final Pam"
---
Maybe some bug spray for the junkies, too?
---
Then why don‚Äôt they just take it out all at once then? Wtf take out workshops and hunter vs hunted station too cause I know those aren‚Äôt doing shit either matter of fact take out the assassins gear too cause its not doing anything oh also the intelligence perk to do more damage to player structures too and might as well take out chameleon armour and the Chinese stealth suit cause even if you‚Äôre invisible enemies still see you anyway since the AI is fucked beyond belief matter of fact why don‚Äôt they just make a multiplayer add on to fallout 4?
---
I like it :)
---
  I play on a 7.1 system - gotta give two thumbs up to the BGS sound FX people - great work.  
---
It's fun to watch my cat when I'm trekking around - sometimes she doesn't know where to look first - afraid shes going to get whiplash...
---
It‚Äôs on first floor sadly -have one foundation piece melding w a current structure. I‚Äôll turn it into a porch. Heck w it lol 
---
Cuz of course in this game we cannot add floors to the lower levels, only the cement blocks.
---
My citation is 465 levels across 2 characters. And numerous, numerous queen fights. On console. Things get to be repitious and you notice stuff out of the ordinary. That's my citation, my footnote , my bullet point.
---
That quest is not prepared to love you.
---
Reminds me of the end of the ‚ÄúBelly of the Beast‚Äù quest. I was not prepared for that fight whatsoever.
---
Sounds like the vats first shot issue. 
---
You can workaround it by retargeting vats or firing immediately as you press vats, I think, but it really should be fixed.
---
I was doing Miner Miracles on a new toon and there was one in Garraghan's. Great fun at level 26 with an assaultron invader thrown in for lols.
---
I have a floating camp, so when I need to move, I don‚Äôt have rebuild from scratch, I just break down the resource collector and water pumps, move the camp all at once, then build a new harvester. Single foundation, up 2 stairwells, to the camp. And put the new harvester down and new water collectors under it. Take 5 minutes.
---
Couple hundred?   I usually go through 3 or 4 fusion cored (400 shots each) while it's in the air and then maybe another 100 shotgun shells while standing next to it on the ground.   You need to do some more damage to be part to the drop.
---
It is going to happen. I promise you that. However, just not anytime soon sadly.
---
Right now the main endgame will become the following.
---
1. Seasons - Just more rewards to exploring the entire game. Not just spamming a few events/instances. It will be nothing new, just more incentive to do more things.
---
2. Temporary Events - Things like meat week, fasnacht, mole miners, etc.
---
3. Reputation/Currency Grind - as more DLC/content is released, rewards corresponding to them will release and will require new things to grind for.
---
4. One Appalachia will make the entire map more enticing to play. All rewards will be scaled to you. So doing back on the beat, exploring random locations in toxic valley, etc. It will be more rewarding and challenging.
---
5. New bomb drop events/bosses - The windigo is the main one we know about so far
---
6. Daily Ops - These we're not exactly sure what these will be. From what I am reading/seeing, this will involve doing specific instances/locations. Like maybe wes-tek one day, the mire mall, etc. However, this content will be scaled to you. So it wont be easy. Groups will probably be required. 
---
7. Expeditions - the off map repeatable dungeon like content
---
I bought a the cheapest plan from a vending machine, right in front of the owner. He was so thankful, I guess, he unlocked his Camp's inner sanctum and did the Follow emote and showed me his collection of Fastnacht masks, Mounted heads (which was pretty impressive to me), and dropped a bag of supplies. I was Lv. 20 he was Lv. 80.
---
What did you dupe?
---
I use it only in high rad environments and scorched earth.
---
It is most likely your internet. You aren‚Äôt running that much bandwidth over 3g and the fact the game is online. The other games work great because you are running internal files.
---
I really wish they would just add all three of the Vaults (adding 94 back, 96 and 63) and actually make them not have a time limit, not be so annoying and laggy, and decrease the hordes upon hordes of enemies that just continually spawn. Make it challenging but don‚Äôt make it annoying.
---
Nothing.
---
You have the option of keeping him alive? He betrayed me in the bullion room so I had to put him down.
---
It's because your phone is slow at telling your PS4 what the server is doing. You need to cut out the middle man.
---
The new weapons came out with wastelander does exactly that- roll your own. It‚Äôs actually cheaper than 2500 scrips if you‚Äôre lucky. I got a bloodied 25 LVC plasma caster within a few tries. It significantly increased the chance to get what you want, versus the gigantic pool of all possible weapons and combinations.
---
So if I can get 4G to cooperate I'm gunna have a better time?
---
The game forces us to be simple if we like to move. I like moving about the map, more interesting.
---
Dunno where to get them, but you after a certain set, cos I can throw you a set to see you on if you like? Got the BoS mod and almost all the rest.
---
5G would improve that right?
---
Writing the user name in the body of your post doesn't ping them. Do it in a comment, you'd also have better luck pinging a community manager.
---
Xbox my friend
---
Will the bug spray make me believe I‚Äôm a secret agent? Will it lead me to a quest line initiated by a giant talking beetle? If yes, I‚Äôm in.

It was pretty short-lived, so if you took a break from the game for even a week or two when it came out it would've been easy to miss. Nobody bothered with it much after the first few days since it was added because it was kind of a letdown. It does look cool and the environmental storytelling is really well done along with some notes and such, but they advertised it as this awesome end-game dungeon and when it came out it was just a sewer full of ghouls. There's really not much reason to bother with it after the first time, and even then it's really just something to do because it's there.
---
It‚Äôs still not a lot. The difference between 4g and WiFi is drastic. It will be better but to run your ps4 to its fullest you most likely want WiFi or an Ethernet connection.
---
well dang. was gonna throw some nuke cards to.you to pay it forward.
---
Really? I wasn't aware, thank you for that heads up.
---
As someone who has played on console (Xbox), and PC, fallout 76 runs like hot garbage on consoles.  Aside from the fact that you are on console, the 3G is not doing you any favors either. I‚Äôd put the blame on fo76, the console, and the 3G phone tethering. Good luck.
---
Lol I came here to say this
---
Dunno why you get the downvotes, that startegy is totally legit.
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Jeez, i couldn't imagine waiting that long. Props.
---
It's just seeing a legendary get called out then someone else runs and maces it within seconds.
---
Interesting mention about the AB, Maybe the terrible damage ABs do is useful afterall.
---
Exactly, I don't know why either. I mean, it was added awhile after the game came out so they wanted us to know it was a new dungeon, but it was pretty standard stuff once you went through it. Just another big place full of enemies to kill.
---
Well a couple hundred rounds is more than enough for you to get loot, you just need to deal around 1k damage.
---
That's how fast your phone gets it. Not necessarily the speed of your phone relaying it.
---
I move as certain junk gets low, lead, acid, junk, and copper seems to be places I jump too.
---
I would dispute that. I‚Äôm running it on the Xbox one x and 200 mgps WiFi and it runs great, better than most games.
---
Yer but you will also get corona
---
I just gave an example of a high damage build, which is easily capable of 1 hits.
---
Same applies to anyone my dude.
---
I will remember that name! So when it pops up, I will know something horrible is heading my way! "Belly of the Beast" Got it!
---
I hope they can speed up the slow animation a little bit.
---
Wait, I have a question:
---
&gt;!Did BGS actually patch the infinite size limit exploit for workshops(camps) from the engine since Fallout 4?!&lt;
---
I've got 600+ levels across 4 characters. Never noticed this trend, and have never heard of NPCs fleeing in response to explosive weapons like that. Curious if there's any datamined info to support this claim.
---
Player vendor prices
---
I'm always down to help people out, just message me what console you play.
---
I love my PA. Reminds me of the fallout 4 trailer with some heavily armoured war machine strolling down the road with his dog.
---
Also, I run a junkies heavy weapon build so usually using stabilised.
---
If not in PA, I prefer to be a bushwookie in a stealth suit.
---
Haha I did have 3 or 4 people upvote me initially. People get upset when you mention alts cuz they don‚Äôt have friends to help them move items.
---
If that's the case then that sucks because I've gotten a lot of duplicates lately of the base ones
---
Well they are literally the weakest enemy type in the game if you know how, you are just too new.
---
The comments in this submission are dumb
---
The real reason is the Events are easy enough you don't have to use your best armor and the only place to show off your cool PA skins.
---
That doesn't change anything about the main complain that it would be nice to have a reason to use the Power Armor.
---
Jumping on to ask if Monster Mash is part of the rotating quests or not. I've tried triggering it many times, but nothing.  Not seen it pop up either?
---
Well I've gone there plenty since the day it was added. The first week it was put in the game, my friends and I ran through it a few times a day. Every now and then I'll pop back in just for a change of pace but it comes off as just a cooler looking golf club, with the addition of an extra loading screen. The atmosphere is great, can't deny that, and it's not constantly cleared out like Whitesprings is, but it definitely didn't live up to the hype Bethesda gave it leading up to its addition to the game. They advertised it as some extra hardcore dungeon designed for a group of fully equipped high level players. Anybody over 50 with a moderately decent build and weapon can run it solo.
---
We don‚Äôt TALK ABOUT THOSE!
---
Pipe weapons are prewar. Due to the government collecting guns in order to keep the troops in China supplied with weapons, as well as being the primary weapon of Detroit street gangs. They are also featured on at least one prewar guns and bullets books.
---
All I got from the burrows was the gutter
---
that is about the only time I ever use stimpaks
---
wait what now flamers are heavy weapons?
---
It's a flex
---
I can't understand why they haven't put in place an ability to make sets that you have ready for certain situations. Its unecessarily time-consuming taking out the ones you don't need for a particular event, then having to put them back in 10 minutes later.
---
Exact same problem here... (PS4)
---
Ironically this game started as a multiplayer addon and then they slapped a coat of live service model paint on it and an RPG bumper sticker so that they could sell skins.
---
When I reached the endgame I set some rules for myself: 
---
\- Only FT from train station to train station, walk everywhere if I'm in the mood
---
\- Only look at the map max 3 times when trying to go somewhere (and I play with no compass and a plain empty map)
---
\- Only eat/drink food that I have made with my own virtual hands
---
\- I don't do dailies because I couldn't care less for the grinding
---
Since I love exploring and finding new places/people this is a really nice way to still enjoy the game now that there are no more new quests to do, but I get it's not everyone's cup of tea
---
Im level 101 currently. I don't struggle against them. It's just very annoying to kill one.
---
Wait until your maxed rep... you find little reason to log on
---
Considering that this is the updated solution to the camp placement problem, I doubt it will get much better. Back in the early days, you didn't even get a notification, it just auto stored your camp. Also, you can always just choose to play without your camp placed if you can't wait for another server. It will still be there next time you load unless you use the free move.
---
Gotcha. I wonder what that genre would be considered. I was genuinely curious since I don't really play online games typically.
---
Something I've done is that I've collected perk cards and designed my SPECIAL to be able to use any build I want, without VATs. 
---
So I take all this extra ammo and just switch builds to that relative gun when I fill up. I agree with your post that something needs to be done about the ammo. However, for now I just use it to switch to different builds and freshen things up.
---
As a side note, you'd be happy to know that it appears that something is coming in seasons that MAY address this issue. It's a bit spoilery (data mind), however I'm excited.
---
That honestly sounds really fun.  We need some drug fueled quests!
---
I for the life of me can't understand why people wouldn't do this.
---
The game weight limit makes the game completely unplayable/ way too focused on micromanaging and there is no actual real reason for it to exist. They just want to sell their subscription.
---
Also pc.
---
Also, to answer your question - my opinion is that they're taking a gradual approach because their "rip the bandaid off" approach has backfired spectacularly in the past (Survival)
---
Yeah, it really doesn't feel like anything special. It's like West Tek or any other instanced dungeon. But for a few weeks leading up to its addition in the game, Bethesda talked it up like it would be this awesome end game dungeon that would challenge the most hardened players. I'm not even a meta build and I blasted through it and kind of shrugged afterwards. It looks great and the atmosphere is excellent, but it's essentially just a bunch of narrow hallways with ghouls to kill. A better looking instanced version of the Whitesprings golf club, basically.
---
Hopefully Brotherhood of Steel comes back on time and we get more meaty content, they always had the best quests in the other games.
---
I got a legendary vampiric buzzsaw from fastnacht. Stimpacks have become useless to me as a sawing maniac.
---
I have an ultracite one i use for tagging - its good fun. I long for the day when they fix the balance on them though. Till then i'll have to main with my gauss rifle
---
This is how I do it by myself most of the time.
---
Lol, took him forever just to get in
---
Fun to nuke as an option...
---
True, cut their heads off &amp; they still run around
---
id rather be rewarded ammo then leather armor im tired of cleaning my inv up
---
Okay, I'll bite - what was the ticket open about?
---
A painful yes üò´ especially today for some reason
---
I personally like the wanderer, not only does she look good in a few outfits but her playing guitar adds a bit of spice to my camp
---
People got used to playing in a micromanagement play style. When people would complain about the small stash or limited space they would get labeled dumb for not being able to adapt. They hate the idea that people can get around the limit and even more so that people have FO1st to move items between alts safely or have friends to help in general. Reddit is going to reddit. Nothing changes.
---
Well, that's because the game is easy enough to play with almost whatever you want, you can faceroll almost everything without god-rolled unyielding armor, PA is more than enough for everything defense-wise and it's easy to get. If you got any half-decent junkies/bloodied/instigating weapon and couple mutations and/or addictions to go with it, you're pretty much set to conquer the wasteland the way you want. No min-maxing anything, no crazy-ass unyielding stats, just plain 'ol faceroll.
---
You might not solo the scorchbeast queen with ease, but hell, who needs to bother with that crazy bullet sponge for a chance to get yet another 1\* nocturnal tire iron?
---
Yeah, the slightly better non-legendary assaultron blade. Almost forgot about that, so I suppose there was technically a unique reward. But even when the burrows was new, nobody cared about the gutter. I think I sold mine shortly after. Unless you're a collector of named weapons, it didn't serve much of a purpose in keeping and wasn't worth the weight in the stash.
---
In my CAMP I've done exactly the inverse, all collections outside and the benches inside. It's nice to see some player looking my things before search my vendors
---
I have water purifiers, food and my vending machines all outside. I even have a second building with beds for other players and stash boxes. I have created a small building for my to have my bed in and a few little decorative pieces, it's just nice to be able to just have a little bit of space to yourself in your own camp
---
Harpers Ferry. 
---
There's a building with a bunch of display cases on three different levels. May have to server hop a few times but keep going back and you should get them all.
---
Edit: Here's a youtube video that shows the spots they spawn in https://youtu.be/4PzGT5BEBGg?t=132
---
Care to share your build or any tips? I started a new character (lvl 19 ATM) after pausing my stealth commando (lvl 72) and am struggling getting to the point where I can use/get some heavy guns and good PA.
---
ü§£ü§£ what! My 30K Bloatfly Gland doesn‚Äôt interest you?
---
It does, I realized there was nothing left but grind after getting the Scavenger Power Armor, the Brotherhood Sniper Rifle and the Enclave Scout Armor.
---
I wasn't even in the mood of getting the mods for the armors, for what? Raiding? Dungeons? There's nothing.
---
Oh cool!  Other then nuka dark which I only have 1 of and grape which I can't find, I have had luck finding several of all other flavours.  The Nuka cola plant has a bunch of flavours too.
---
Have you found a way to put items on the bed or tables like you could in fallout 3?  My bed was covered in prewar money and my tables were covered in mini nukes.  I wish I could set up a chess board like the frat house has.  So if I can't place items like we could in the other games (which would be tough to manually do), I would love to have a Camp plan for a robot chess set...and maybe a creatures one as well (deathclaw as the queen or something like that).
---
True, there is that. It was great for exp back when glowing ones gave a ton, that's for sure.
---
Actually he died at the start of my first attempt at that part of the quest (completely his fault), but a good ol "servers not responding" made me do it all again so I was able to keep him alive. But now I regret it so bad man
---
Okay, that's hilarious!  
---
Not sure how to simulate the subwoofer for the ".1" part.  First thing that came to mind was a Broadsider on a heavy weapons display stand, pointed at the back of the chair, with the word "[BASS](https://youtu.be/Htm_956k5ps)" on the side.  But someone could probably do better.
---
Why not both. Set up a second monitor and stream some stuff. That's about the only way I play 76 now. Beyond casual lol.
---
I got killed by laser turrets and ended up flaming until I switched servers.
---
T-65 at least has the excuse of being pretty new, I wouldn't have expected them to update all the old skins for it really, but ultracites been around since launch, and its gone one skin in the atom shop.  I just don't get it.
---
As a dedicated Enclave RP, I've been waiting months for actual Enclave Faction content...so far, we've gotten an eye-patch. Very disappointing.
---
I run it on 4g with no problems, but I really recommend getting a 4g modem and an external antenna if possible.
---
Only if you can live with not having a complete set on
---
Just show up at an Encryptid event. Seems a player dies every few seconds.
---
&gt; tell me which objective is hard:
---
The map marker lists it as a hard event.
---
Mildly upset I missed the gag goggles. Oh well
---
Yeah from Fo4, almost every gun and mod was brought back from that game, this is one of the few missing.
---
I wear my Nuka-Cola T51 with a vaultboy head because it looks nice. That is all. Well and it has the red headlamp mod so my vaultboys eyes glow red when I turn it on, pretty menacing honestly
---
When you are jumping with marsupial and still hit you üòÇüòÇ
---
Interesting reversal, I did collect some things, but after the vendors and displays were turned off all my teddy bears and other collectibles were consumed, so I don't bother with displays anymore. Easier to move with a tiny shed.
---
Maybe you're right -)) But yeah, it definitely takes some time to transfer and manage all that stuff. People might think it's too much of a hassle.
---
No worries at all dude. Thank you for replying to my post in the only language I know lol. I didn‚Äôt mean to come off rude, and if I did, I apologize :)
---
Support is slow took them  a bit over 3 months to get a reply at that point I had forgotten I even contacted them . This game has completely soured my perception of this company before I had no issue buying Bethesa games but now even on sale i don't bother .
---
Fellow PS4 (OG Phat) player here, also have NMS.
---
If your PS4 is noisy, you might wanna replace your thermal paste, thermal pads, and maybe blow out the metal grills behind the fan.
---
I did mine a while ago, and it was packed with dust. Cleaned it out, replaced pads and paste, and now it's cold and silent, even when doing Scorched Earth in FO76 and playing NMS.
---
Can throw you a great video guide if you want?
---
Wait they can do that? #NerfFeralGhouls.
---
Truly it is a hassle, but that‚Äôs why I designed a main storage alt to hold everything.
---
My PA character has definitely got the most damage mitigation uptime. Got dodgy going full blast with core assembly for my chest mod.
---
Sitting at about 2.5 k treasury notes. This is the only game I play now and it's just event hopping or doing daily's for treasury notes. Cant even cash them in because the second I get on, I turn them in. 20 a day is just ridiculous for people like me who play this the second we get off work for hours.
---
Excactly

You must go [deeper](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/westworld/images/7/78/Dolores_finds_the_Maze.png/revision/latest?cb=20171008010009)
---
I've been trying for a week, I never seem to catch it going (I spent ages server hopping hoping to catch it too...), and I've not gotten far enough through the quest to get the card myself yet. I know, I know, I'm impatient! I'm sorted now anyway, thanks to /u/NukaColaDark6614.
---
we also need double sided interior walls for placing in between rooms, would help them push more wall paper sales too
---
Dongless Sith Lords?
---
shoot first, shoot harder.
---
and shoot legs. (use concentrated fire perk).
---
This would be so awesome, though I get the feeling a roller coaster ride would melt the servers.
---
People complain about the nukes that hit prime dead center, but those are always fun battles. It‚Äôs always a bunch of low levels scrambling around since it‚Äôs usually someone‚Äôs first nuke.  It‚Äôs a totally different fight, creatures everywhere, falling in trenches when you‚Äôre looking to the sky. Bloodied builds into PA or stealth suits if they even bother showing up.
---
Getting out of your comfort zone is nice every now and then.
---
yup just had this happen on PC was returning from data recorder when bloodbug struck my charater and turned screen black, relogged didnt help had to restart game completely to get visual back and stuck unable to interact
---
Three months? That's absurd. This is the first time I've ever had Support do this, I figured it had something to do with the Covid situation but at this point I doubt that's the actual case. Prior to this issue, I always had prompt replies from Support.
---
&gt;shoot first, shoot harder.
---
Well you see, that's the damn problem.
---
Unfortunately on PS4. Thanks for the offer though.
---
Thank you saved me some typing. It's why I bought a DC mask and a pink asylum for 500 caps each. Some people just play and don't give a f&amp;$k.
---
I too have been looking but have not found one yet. I've also heard it can be a reward for events but no luck there either.
---
IMO more of a distraction and annoyance than an aid.
---
Because Reddit.  I dont know, worked for me but maybe it was just a coincidence.  Guess I will stop recommending things that could possibly help lol.
---
They only drop as an Ultra Rare reward from Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, and Mr. Messenger now. Comes in a bundle with all the jumpsuits.
---
Yes. Deathclaws. floaters. snarlygasters. More ghouls.
---
Is there a bass as a musical instrument option?
---
[Solo Encryptid - Public World](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs)
---
If you're on XBox - I'm always happy to help people who are trying to complete the event.
---
Flooded trainyard and nar repair yard, watoga also poss spawns
---
Can carry more with modded backpack than with excavator pa.
---
Ugh. Mr messenger really? I hate that event. I have been skipping it when it shows.
---
It has happened to me numerous times...  They'll be charging at you with their Usain Bolt speed and i jump to evade them and at the peak of the jump i still get hit üòÖ
---
Guess I'll have to wait 5 more months for the Thanksgiving display case. I wish the Stein display case was for more than just steins.
---
Thank you I have always wondered why they would be in locked safes.
---
Here‚Äôs the kicker, I did this strategy with 2/3 of the team being bloodied (myself included)
---
Yes I think it's about 50 but with this game you need at least 18. 
---
But maybe I have expressed wrong(I'm not English native), I wanted to know how much atoms cost
---
If you are properly perked for rifles and actually use your bloodied handmade at low health and stack nerd rage and adrenal reaction mutation, you should do tons of damage with that gun. Even without all of the bloodied specific stuff, just the rifleman perks (really commando is better, imho) should let you do enough damage to loot her.
---
Only drops in the savage divide events now, can't get it at the vendor anymore. When they added the scout mods, they removed the spawning enclave plasma gun mods and the chance for scout masks. And for some dumb reason they removed them from the enclave events. Friend actually just got the set off a OVN yesterday.
---
So that's what triggers their spawn.
---
Lol same. Might be a better use of your time to farm caps/legendaries and try and tr*de for one instead.
---
You know what, to hell with it. This might seem petty but I have a ticket open for a Forum Appeal. My account was banned due to a misunderstanding of how I poorly worded a comment that was seen as baiting/trolling Valseek.
---
400 rounds? Are you not using power user? 
---
Pumps thoes bad boys up to 1000 rounds each.
---
There's a spawn location in the large shed beside the Ranger Office in the cranberry bog. Not the shed behind the building with the cages, but the other one beside it with a truck right outside. It's not always there but you can get the full set by going there frequently enough. It'll be on a shelf to your right when you enter the shed.
---
Tho to be fair I as borrowing a be hm, (I‚Äôve used just about any max lvl explosive commando it still gets the job done) and the other was a heavy weapon/commando main
---
With 5 radios, you may want a cannon ball in the back lol.
---
I have been checking every player vendor as well lol. Id pay a good bit for it just to have to not farm for it anymore. LoL
---
i had 10 nukes and a fatman in my inventory today and I had no idea where they came from. then i realised i did a few dailies that i have never done before.
---
Bethesda really loves trolling us sometimes.
---
Mfers be hitting levels of high that ain't even coded into the game.
---
I really want that shelf too and have a great build planned for when I get my hands on it. Sucks they don't add/remove stuff more frequently so its back sooner.
---
People who are satisfied with a game don‚Äôt often go posting about how satisfied they are with the game... mostly because they are too busy playing the game and being satisfied.
---
Harper's ferry and the train at by watoga station sometime has it.
---
Your welcome, happy to help
---
You probably just have shit luck like me. I've managed to get a few, but my friends that I play with all seem to get them more frequently than men.
---
Given how rare they are, I've been collecting them. I think I have 14 now - 7 Urban &amp; 7 Forest. I keep them in displays &amp; one on my in case I need a gas mask.

And so he gazed upon the corpse to find an exterminators wood left arm before blacking out and waking up in a wagon with three skeletons getting a weird feeling it was a reference to a game being added to each and every gaming console.
---
Lucky
---
PA is behind and using it means you use lose out on back packs, Legendary armour perks and such.
---
But people still use PA like my self on my PA build due to even with all this we like PA. PA has high def and work really well BUT end game the right perk cards can make anything work well. 
---
Bloodied PA heavy gunner vs a heavy gunner non-PA. 
---
Bloodied PA:
---
Pros:                                                             
---
emergency protocols  
---
45% AP with heavy guns   
---
no fall damaged                                             
---
Cons:
---
loses out on all legendary amour perks I.E +15 stats ( thats alot of extra xp lost)   
---
Slower in movement  
---
Jet pack cant be used with EP, New SS jetpack is                                                                         better.   
---
Low carry weight  
---
Lack of good mods for arms  
---
=============================================================================
---
Bloodied non-PA 
---
Pros:                
---
Can use and access all legendary armour.  
---
Has just as high def as PA  
---
Faster movement   
---
better jet pack    
---
Huge carry weight  
---
Cons:  
---
Takes fall damage  
---
no AP on heavy guns.   
---
...........
---
It involved quite a bit of trading to pull off.
---
I've had both things happen I hit it for I think 17k with bloodie dcg with power atk, and once there was one ghols in the ground that we couldn't hit
---
BETHESDA!!!!!
---
It's got a great layout for an event.
---
Sorry, I never do this event because I was under the impression it was confusing, what's the EM Hazmat suit?
---
Edit wait I think I did this one before, and lost. Us the EM Hazmat suit the one the scavengers are wearing?
---
lol I've done that before.
---
So they confiscated all the .38 pistols but they didn't grab western revolvers, .45 autos, and Snub .44s.  
---
You would think there would be a few out there, no way the .gov got them all.
---
Not quite the same thing, but you can actually achieve this with the brick walls - not sure about the other wall types.
---
You can drop brick doorways back to back, then edit them and swap them to another version of the wall. Have only done it on doorways and full walls, but would guess the windows might work too.
---
learn how to count to 20 ?
---
not everyone plays this game on the east coast US...
---
Update: I hit level 45 yesterday which meant I could use the 3 star Legendary Gauss Rifle a buddy gifted to me (+33% VATS hit chance, 25% less action point cost in VATS, reduce target's damage output by 20% for 3 seconds). This allowed me to get kill credit for the SBQ for the first time, yay!
---
No one is confused about the emote usage.
---
You can manage this by putting two doors in the same spot facing opposite directions, then change them into walls once placed. Unfortunately that takes up a lot of excess budget and sometimes it looks a little glitchy if you can see the edge of the wall.
---
That's not true, I heard him say Monday just a couple days ago.
---
Good thing i use an anti armor cryolater when she's landed
---
Naw. That's great
---
I would rather wait for legendary mobs to spawn than kill it right away..
---
I have the same issue but I have not been able to figure out a solution. I usually just stand up to break stealth and check the pip boy.
---
I didn't bait or troll Valseek however. I worded my comment poorly and it was taken completely out of context.
---
No it doesn't.
---
If you're Bethesda you just hold your hands over your ears and it just magically goes away.
---
Depending on the build and weapon a couple of hundred rounds could get you over the threshold. I only need one melee hit or at 80 on each shot from my handmade I need 13 hits to make the threshold.
---
I'm aware of that but I hate wearing the stuff.   I make the cores from flux so it doesn't really cost me anything other than time.  And let's be honest, in this game other than the daily grind there is nothing else to do.
---
I main an auto laset rifle with a prime receiver which does the job. But it is not efficient in any way and not a tank killer in any way. Charred ghouls, glowing ones, and anglers all will face tank entire fusion cells before they unceremoniously die even with adrenaline, tank killer, an anti armor prefix, glow sights, and tenderizer.
---
chemistry* and you can store the ingredients in the fridge if you need.
---
I like to creep up at nighttime across the map dawn my Metal Mothman Helmet and watch em freak out. Otherwise it‚Äôs building.
---
I do. I was specifically talking about the mystery pick about the combat knives and fatman, but overall, all I get are nocturnal and mutants armor pieces. Not even AP refresh as the Major.
---
I just got a quad cryolater from the Fasnacht event that I've been waiting to try out
---
You‚Äôre honestly lucky you have that many people to run it with AND be able to coordinate like that. Usually a player will be on by themselves and it‚Äôs a matter of ‚Äúis anyone else gonna do it?‚Äù Because people don‚Äôt want to use up ammo and heals then realize they had low chances of getting good loot
---
Vampires explosive 50 cal. I got a bloodied explosive lmg but, I‚Äôm not a bloodied build so it‚Äôs been sitting in my stash
---
most people use power armor anyways because A: reddit users make up about 5-10% of the actual games userbase, B : most times people do events its got a ton of radiation (scorched, uranium fever, etc) and C : gotta show off dem skins yo.
---
Do note that there are actual "sweet meat" desserts, such as meat pies, meats with sweetening preservatives, and even several sweet sauces for certain meat dishes. Though what's funny is that the ancient dessert, "Sweetmeats", was fried honey and not meat.
---
lol I told them to fck off cause they said I was spamming when my pet Mega sloth disappeared. *banned*
---
What does it say?
---
Fair enough I can respect that.
---
Glad I can give people the confidence they need to complete this event üòä
---
Don't see the problem if it's on a 24 hour cycle. Say you normally log on at 1:00 AM EST, your stuff will all be reset for your play session every time you log on. Nothing changes on the 24 hr cycle vs the 20 hour staggered cycle.
---
They need to add in all the missing settlement structures from Fallout 4 asap.  I missing my Stairs Foundation, and the ability to build stairs next to a wall and filling the gap with 1x2 or 2 1x1s floors.
---
I think that's their actual intention. To get you to try different weapons or at least to have the option to.
---
Okay, Karen, I'll go get the manager.
---
South of lake eloise! Tons of cliffs/rocks
---
My hope is that the less selfish players will see this and the other strategies down in the comments and think ‚Äúhey maybe I CAN actually beat this event‚Äù
---
Not sure the exact location, but if you search "acid cave, fo76" theres a dark cave with an acid node in it that is quite popular.
---
No definitely not
---
I once got Wood

Can you not zoom and enhance?

Ok, we should all be fine with them selling broken items. Got it üëçüèª
---
I think Bethesda is missing a trick with Cronenberg. There‚Äôs loads of his stuff that would make excellent little side quests.
---
Not really a Karen moment. OP purchased something and now it's not even useful. Thanks Bugthesda.
---
Fallout fan   
---
Troika fan 
---
NOT a 76 fan
---
NOT a Bethesda fan
---
I have my reasons to wade through this shitshow.
---
Tell that to your employers , mr low karma, less than a year old Bethesda shill account 
---
You people really sicken me.  Take that garbage PR damage control money and use it to hire an actual good developer.
---
No. If you run this solo the best you‚Äôre going to get from the event is too get xp and loot drops by only defending 1 Scavenger and never going to collect the ore. My hope is that people will see this, want to go try my strategy and the others in the comments and that way you might not always be left running Radiation Rumble solo
---
Yea but that's only an extra 50% and can only hold what like 10 items
---
and what about flamers or tesla?
---
tbh they should just change explosive energy to "precise" and make it reduce recoil by 90%.
---
one of energy weapons worst traits is the insane recoil (if i recall, lasers cant even create recoil?) along side the bad perk sync.
---
I‚Äôm curious. You mentioned you‚Äôre super high level and don‚Äôt have much left to do etc.
---
My question is, how do you deal with people that dupe in the game? And what do you think about it.
---
I‚Äôm level 92 and loving the game but I seem to come across a few people going on about cap glitches etc and then my friends sook to them and get free shit.
---
Additionally, I completed almost all fasnacht events and on my final go I got the raven mask (I also got 2 helms and like 3 winter man‚Äôs) but I was so happy with the raven mask and button to get it ... then literally a day later (AFTER fasnacht ended) two of my friends managed to scam / hack raven masks in when they didn‚Äôt have them before. Which is obviously bloody annoying because I worked hard to get it and earned it and it felt unique m... then they go grab is off someone who‚Äôs duped it and I‚Äôm like wtf.. it just ruins the game.
---
In my opinion fallout should do an event which you can‚Äôt trade or sell the rewards so you know you‚Äôre an OG and earned it legitimately.
---
How do you feel about all this??
---
I kinda like that the OG ones look different though. Let‚Äôs you know the real ones y‚Äôknow?
---
Might have to startüëÄüëÅ
---
I have a high DPS commando build that can lay waste to the center room on my own.  When I do this event I see two outcomes.
---
1. People leave the center room defense to me, go gather ore, and we complete the event
---
2. People don't listen to me, try to help defend the center room, still don't get any kills cause I can polish them off so damn fast, then they get pissed off at me.
---
I'm thinking of quitting the event because they recently changed the ghouls from being level 71 to level 40, making all the legendary weapon drops scrip shit I don't need.  Another thing I don't need is pip squeak 16 year olds cursing me out on mike for asking them to go get ore and complete the event.
---
I also lay considerable blame to Bethesda's piss poor gaming design skills which give more XP for playing the event incorrectly than to play it to win it.  XP should be rewarded for the act of gathering and depositing ore, further it should be enough so that players doing that will get just as much XP as what I get sitting in the middle room gunning everything that moves that isn't human down.
---
BTW, the Glow Sight 3 and Grim Reaper Sprint 3 perk cards go a long way to helping lay down the havoc here.
---
Same. The best way I can put it is, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a rifleman by choice, but also a commando by necessity.‚Äù
---
I got the vault 94 scout mask, but was a little bummed at how dorky it looked....until I got the gillie suit from Nuclear Winter, which now it looks fing legit creeping thru the brush and vines
---
It‚Äôs a bit confusing how does it create more recoil than other guns that shoot actual bullets
---
I've gotten away from choosing armor, since I'm trying for Uny/WWR SS armor. So all my scrip on my mules go to weapons (mix of range/melee), main gets Legendary modules.  Just teasing on my original comment.
---
when i do an event like uranium fever i disengage all my commando or rifleman perksso i don't accidentally murder the legendaries. certainly the rewards are generally bollocks,  but for an easy one like that let everyone have a go.
---
Yes. Every time you reach a new level more enemies spawn and more deadly ones at that
---
I think you have a shot since its broken in their game, not just buyers remorse. I don't know the time limit, but I would give it shot regardless.
---
Its a good counter for froglegs I will agree, however its not really enough, if a player is good enough and plays in third person, one  jump is all someone needs to get a kill tbh 
---
Have been killed like this many times, and have gotten some kills like this too
---
I love my PA i have made it a mission to collect every single piece of every single set and to be honest I am never out of my PA unless I have to create something or I'm in my base working on my vending machines or crafting something otherwise I'm in it 99.9%
---
This is a very well known bug. Just don‚Äôt one shot it. Problem solved.
---
Maybe they‚Äôll see my strategy and the others in the comments and realize that pretending to be the Main Character won‚Äôt always get the job done. Idk, wish full thinking? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh I killed the Chicken... and made SOOUUUPPP!! üòãüòã
---
üëÜ(for those that can‚Äôt see that well the emoji is pointing up)
---
Look up God Mode
---
But if you play at the same time everyday then they will be reset already, 20 hrs is fine its not hard to keep track of and if you happen to play earlier than normal they may already be reset.
---
As of right now it‚Äôs my main source of income I get all my purified water and sell it to vendors
---
 My post has nothing to do with counting, time zones, or who plays where. Sorry if I confused you.
---
Aww ok. Thanks.
---
All paints except for the Inferno works on all base game PAs except for raider
---
Have Fuzzy Brenda lead the event!
---
I‚Äôm PS4 too! If you‚Äôre ever interested in teaming up, I‚Äôm lvl 35 currently and having a blast at this game. Got FO1st for same reasons as OP but Appalachia is a little mundane without others to complete events with
---
It takes me 20 arrows to get the SBQ loot
---
Gotta love Reddit for downvoting you for giving facts. Here is an upvote for bringing facts to the party.
---
The odds of successfully completing Radiation Rumble are inversely proportional to the number of people that show up for it.
---
If you get a single other person that can understand simple instructions over mic you can time out the event with all four npcs alive, 75+ ore and crippled ghouls littering the floor as far as the eye can see.
---
Every additional person that shows up and immediately runs around headshotting the crippled ghouls and then gets swarmed by their replacements increases the likelihood of failure.
---
PS4 but thank you! Very impressive. How did you keep your health so high and preventing it from falling?
---
bruh 99% of my legendary drops aren't even from events, hell a vast majority of events aren't even max level so the legendary won't be max level either.
---
That player fears nothing. They are the endgame threat we have been clamoring for.
---
on PC there is a mod to a buddy of mine used that allowed him to do the quick animation every time. I haven't used it but he loved it.
---
Go outside, walnut.
---
I have 2 characters level 260 and 175 on my main I use PA exclusively and have since level 15 on my alt I use regular armor only and a haz mat suit in nuke zones. There's pros and cons to both. My main is a wade in and start bashing melee and regardless of the DR numbers he wouldn't last in anything but PA with my play style. Plus I'd constantly have to repair regular armor. PA lasts for a long time before being repaired.
---
I just wish I had a bit more storage space. Though admittedly a lot of that is my fault for probably keeping a lot more of most of the scrap than I actually need. Is there a suggestion for how much of each type it makes sense to keep on hand? I bulked you and sold a lot of steel but I still feel like I could slim down a lot of other things.
---
I am down for anyone doing anything clever or weird.
---
Small lake by Marigold Pavilion. There's a small wharf there, but at the other edge of the lake is a decent sized cave, or grotto. I can imagine with a bit of flair it could be a nice Mothman shrine.
---
Throw everything onto another character to wait it out. Also if you put it in a world container they won‚Äôt spoil
---
aye especially when lasers are light based and not explosive propelled lead
---
Limb damage rolling all the time was a bug forever and they fixed it, but knowing bugthesda, they probably brought it bs k with a later patch. 
---
Retodded as usual.
---
Explosive 10mm for me...
---
That is honestly the most annoying thing that happened when I ran with my team of 3. We‚Äôd see the event had popped up, the first one ready would wait for the rest and then some low lvl would run up, start the event (meanwhile I‚Äôm still swapping my gear and perks!) and they look at our one team mate like ‚ÄúwHy ArEn‚ÄôT yOu CaRrYiNg YoUr WaIt BrO?‚Äù
---
Vampire FFR FR - it's a life-saver. I've solo'ed that event a few hundred times now.
---
Ik but to quote God Howard ‚Äúit just works‚Äù
---
Yes.
---
Power Armor look cool
---
I wear Power Armor
---
The weapon of her people! Instigating mole miner gauntlet w 40% more power damage and 40% reduce power damage ap cost. I can one shot most things I sneak up to.
---
Oh trust me, I have 2k hours +, it's not that I can't keep track - it's just weird that we have different cooldowns for stuff. I'd take uniformity over the off chance that I get to play 4 hours earlier than normal one night. Under normal circumstances, theres no functional difference between a 24 hour reset and a 20 hour one if you play the same time every day like you mentioned.
---
"Do you get to the cloud district very often...oh what am I thinking, of course you don't."

‚ÄúLet me guess. Someone stole your sweet roll?‚Äù

Use the Alternative Pip-Boy View.

Chameleon (and any other invisible effects) also affect the Pip-Boy itself. Which is the cause of that distortion.

Ok, now I  gotta just ask "platform?" Cause I want to see it.
---
Gratz. By the sound of it, OP's not using as refined a build as you though.
---
Alright thx.
---
What a fun idea! There was a camp at a location where a friend usually has hers the other night, sooo much neon. She went to look to see who stole her space-shared a few screenshots-eventually like 5 of us were there drawn in like moths to the glow. 
---
A way to say, "Hey, thanks for making us all smile and admire" would be awesome.
---
Whenever I do Radiation Rumble, there's definitely a part of me that thinks the scavengers deserve to die.  I still try to complete it, but my feeling is: If your sense of self-preservation in the apocalypse is this fucking bad, you kinda have it coming.
---
Trade that bad boy away from something good!
---
Holy hell yes. I love those two perks. As for the XP, I never really noticed because my build is pretty much set. I got back on 76 around that time there was a bonus XP sandwich (double XP event, triple XP event, double XP event) so I‚Äôm a lvl 205 who has a complete build who used the extra perks point to max out all the Intelligence perks (except the heavy weapon one) THEN maxed out all the bow/crossbow perks

B50limb+1agl Fixer

Ok, I LOL'ed. Good one.

Oh yes

Till you're a junkies build and use a junkies tesla and 1 shot 5 at once by accident.
---
Well see what I was told is the possible rewards change base on number of players participating and there damage according to everyone else... so that dude was full of it? I just took him on his word cuz he was like 250 somthing and hes the one that told me to switch. In any case either he was right or I just got a super lucky run
---
I mean it could be worse. They could‚Äôve been dogs that don‚Äôt fear suiciders or suicidal talking trees
---
I come home someone chameleoning in my kitchen. I go over to the workbench there‚Äôs also someone in power armor was motionless in the corner hopin I wouldn‚Äôt see them. So I played along until I could get my punji boards out.
---
I too hate feral ghouls.
---
Throw on some Ghoul Slayer's armor, find some rad resistance, whether it's a lead lined pack or armor stat. It becomes a tickle fight. 
---
Before I had any of those, I used Enforcer, under Agility. Grab an explosive shotgun and just spam shots at the group. It staggers instantly, cripples really easy as well. Lays ghouls down, they can't hit you any longer if they're crippled on the ground.
---
Yeah, the guide I read though said about special screwdrivers and shit. Same for your video?
---
You can craft them at the tinkers station. (It‚Äôs under souvenirs)
---
If you meant the wood/metal one that‚Äôs in game, it can be found at the tatoo shop.
---
And I don‚Äôt think the ones that they had during the event could be displayed IIRC
---
I'm confused why I got a down vote for asking a legitimate question who ever it was is a dick
---
But to everyone else thx for the answers
---
The burrows was supposed to be an end game dungeon? Lol.
---
Can a 4g modem use a micro sim?
---
Worth it.
---
Lately I've just been wandering different areas of the map.
---
Unyielding isn't broken in and of itself. It just shouldn't be allowed to stack. All armor prefixes shouldn't stack.  +3 for all stats is fair.  +15?  Uhm, no.
---
I see. Thanks.
---
Sounds more of a inconvenience then what it's worth. Not 100% sure, why you would be argueing against a simple quality of life improvement. But hey some people like getting reamed I'd pay 1000 atoms for a green house the size of the seedy shack. Preferably unenterable preset, so u can put what u want in it, and see it grow
---
I don't think so yet. I haven't played recently.
---
Missiles and mini nukes as rewards is just upsetting
---
My name is the same as my reddit name.  Im on PC, friend request me.
---
The porcelain steins cant be obtained outside the event, you'll have to wait til next year (they cant even be displayed so I dont see the point in keeping it)
---
Yeah, sadly my current situation is kinda shitty so permanent and stable internet isn't on the cards.
---
I‚Äôm same time zone mate, happy to help.
---
I still need to resurrect someone in water I think as well, so if you could return the favour, great.
---
I have a very similar bug with two different legendary LMGs I have in my inventory. If I favorite one of them, eventually it automatically favorites the other one too, and in order to fix it it I have unfavorite both of them. Both weapons are bloodied, but one is 3* and the other is 1*. 
---
It‚Äôs like the game is having trouble differentiating legendary weapons that are the same weapon type that also share the same primary legendary effect.
---
The porcelain stein was not displayable in the stein stand. I think I checked with the Thanksgiving display and it wasn‚Äôt displayable there either.  It‚Äôs only available during Fasnacht. 
---
The metal and wooden ones are normal spawns in Helvetia in the restaurant.
---
You know, sometimes people just like to flex. In TF2 a strange gunslinger does the exact same thing as a normal gunslinger, but it‚Äôs worth $100 on the community market. A golden frying pan is exactly the same as a normal pan except cosmetically, and it‚Äôs worth $3000. Burning flames team captain is also worth a lot, and it does nothing special besides look nice in some people‚Äôs opinions. Just because things do nothing and cost a lot doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ‚Äúshit design‚Äù or anything.
---
I agree it is easy to keep track of it if you play one or two characters. But it can get a little bit of a p.i.t.a. when you play more than that, especially if you play on multiple platforms.
---
Can you craft the porcelain ones?
---
I had 2 weapons in my inventory yesterday and went to switch to the 25lvc one to take down a SB and came up empty handed.
---
I've got an extra that is probably going to encounter the same fate one day.  You on PS4?
---
Yeah, I definitely support your suggestion OP. I'd much rather have uniformity in the resets than an extra 4 hour window. The benefits way outweigh the downsides for me personally.
---
At this point I think the event is over. I think the end date was Jun 11th.
---
I'm all sorted, but thank you!
---
No one has yet argued *against* your suggestion. 
---
What they‚Äôve done is offer **potential solutions in the current system**.
---
Huge difference.
---
There's more worthier legendaries than Ghoul Slayer.
---
I already have an explosive shotgun. Would you believe I miss 95% of my shots, like fr.
---
The thing is, it‚Äôs usually easier if everyone just waited towards the end of the event. Especially if you do have a good defense going. It‚Äôs hard to communicate besides just shouting into the mic, which usually doesn‚Äôt have the intended effect.
---
All they need to do, and this should apply to all "spin" weapons (and it's how they work in real life afaik) is make the barrels spin when you aim down sights. Then, all you gotta do is pull the trigger and it should start firing.
---
There's still a drawback of having to spin it up, but its more controllable and you don't need to respin it every time in multiple enemy situations.
---
No. They are only for the event.
---
Crafted: souvenir metal stein
---
Spawn: metal/wood stein

[My build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f345f4a&amp;d=lt2l71ic2id2s12ir2c72ei2pe2sq2s32sr2s22sb2a00eu0cr0ip2a72l32ld0l10&amp;w=eh2&amp;m=c2i).  A lot of 'luck' there I'm probably gonna move, just playing a little with plasma caster &amp; VATS at the moment.
---
I'd build around a weapon, ultimately.  I ripped a Bloody Explosive Gatling off the Queen and decided to respec to heavy weps &amp; just roll with bloody.  So anything that amplifies that.  Nerd rage, adrenaline mutation, emergency protocols on my PA chest.
---
For power armor - go with what you feel looks coolest to you.  Overall there's not a large difference in its effectiveness which is kinda odd, T45, T51, T60, X01, T65 are all pretty close in how much damage they'll shave off despite the stat differences.  I'm using T60 with the brotherhood paint job.
---
For heavy weapons, all of the gatlings are really good, in terms of bang for your buck on damage vs ammo.  The minigun is fun but it would hurt me less if it fired caps instead of 5mm.  There's no reason to use a normal gatling laser when the ultracite gatling is the same thing with a little extra damage, and on a high fire rate low per shot damage wep that's a big deal.  The 50 cal is also great DPS and reasonable on ammo.
---
Best legendary prefixes are bloody, junkies, anti-armor, or two-shot, which despite the nerf is good on a high fire rate wep that's not about accuracy.
---
Have you met tod howard
---
Grim reapers sprint maybe?
---
I didn't think so
---
Quick question about tamed pets, do they disappear from your camp if you deactivate your animal friend perk card?
---
100% agree. Still want the skins applied tho
---
Max out agility. It will increase your stealth capabilities. Use the mister sandman perk card.
---
Take out all the utility stuff and max out skills like tank killer and action boy.
---
Most of us have so much and its either sell it or give it away. And the upper tiers have so much to sell, giving stuff away isnt much.
---
I agree.  I kept getting told my camp could not be placed in world after world.  I quit to Windows and came back and it was normal.  A bunch of my camp items were invisible for a while but building new things fixed that.
---
I'm all sorted with the Kindness one! But if you'd like to get your water resurection done, I'm currently building next to a pond in Whitespring. PM me your name and I'll friend you. I haven't got the water one done, so we can both do that!
---
No you can't, what you can craft is the souvenir one, that one is different.
---
I saved your post, got burnt out after a year and a half but I‚Äôll use it when I start playing again
---
This. And you know. Not have the spin down stop the use of stimpacks. Or is that just me *sweats* 
---
For real I can't stim or anything till my gatling laser spins down. Its weird
---
My buddy came back to the game a few months ago. When he quit he was level 200( this was before sheepsquatch) well that was the first event he tried when he came back because it was new for him. He got melted too and now won't go near it lol.
---
Totes
---
Damn bro who  pissed in your cornflakes this morning? I may have low karma, at least I'm not a masochist to keep coming to a sub I hate.
---
Have those Liberator Drone Lamps (I think those are ATOM shop)
---
if you dont mind me asking whats ur gt? sounds exactly like a couple guys that came by my base the other day but no doubt theres a lot of people doing such
---
Yeah, if you don‚Äôt wait then more enemies/deadlier enemies will spawn. If you wait, then you have a chance (100% chance if you‚Äôre coordinating with a mic) of depositing all 100 ore at once and at that point the event will end and dealing with the spawned enemies will be a choice instead of a stressful must
---
If you were on Xbox would love help you in game. Hang tough and patience is going to be key. You do have some great games on that list that don‚Äôt require internet.
---
Sooooo.........you want fallout nv survival mode but with pvp?.?.?
---
Hell, I‚Äôd take even the opportunity to just do the quests again. That fire breather quest was badass, would be amazing to do it against high level scorched with my gauss shotgun.
---
Questing, building up my CAMP, taking Photos, hanging out with my guild mates
---
Honestly i did it last night and after I got all the ore I could I just did the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emote to some guys in power armor towards the rooms then I just bashed or shot the ore to let them know they need to grab the ore now
---
My default is a gatling gun for basic enemies, i tag the Legendary once, emote and let it punch me so people can come over and get their tags in
---
Hit V to get a clickable pipboy while in chameleon
---
Thank you both for the information! We're looking into this now.
---
Varies between models I believe. Check if your subscription is allowable to use in a modem before you buy, I would guess not now that I think about it, unlimited data usually has clauses like that.
---
Was kind of fucky earlier today. I run two accounts, one has fallout 1st, the other doesn't. I couldn't scrap anything on my main with the subscription, but I could with the second account. Should've taken advantage of it because now I have some random scrap in my second account's scrap box.
---
Same name as on here mate I‚Äôll be on in a little while, and cheers
---
Yeah ikr it gives you something to after you‚Äôve completed most of the missions
---
In real life this is very much true. but ingame it looks very odd. have you ever played another game where youve used a bow? in other games it feels much more natural then in fo76.
---
every time i hang out with YER MOM.
---
oooohhhhhhh!!!!!!!! lol
---
*‚ÄôThis‚Äô* morning?  He‚Äôs like that all the time.
---
He enjoys being miserable and sharing that misery with others. 
---
If it was me, I‚Äôd have found a new hobby by now.
---
Besides Scorched Earth/ Fasnacht/ Guided Meditation I‚Äôve yet to do an event with a bunch of randos that get the job done
---
This team messaged me multiple times for me to join them, I had never tried playing with other people so I finally agreed. These players went to my house and destroyed my camp that I spent so much time on, literally just the frame was still standing, no walls no anything. I had to back out of the server to get them to stop. Idk why this is even a thing
---
Right next to my camp! I frequently raid that house.
---
[MORE BASS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erFcYsC6JaY)
---
Yes, But you would think they would be more powerful than a nerf gun especially because they use multiple fusion cells per shot
---
Hell yes! That‚Äôs what I like to see!
---
They're also great for doing silo runs. I have a full set 3 polymer scout pieces and 2 buttressed Secret Service pieces with rad resistance and the scout is lead lined and I breeze through the nuke silos by myself.
---
Oh it definitely would, but one could only hope. Maybe set it up like the monorail in Nuka World, that would make it run better as it restricts the user's controls and makes it more of a loading screen.
---
Sent you a friend request. I'll be online for 30 minutes, maybe a little more, but most likely tomorrow evening too, so no worries if you miss me now!
---
This is literally something you would find in a fallout game too
---
Check angry turtle on yt did a complete breakdown on it.
---
It's a nice wide open space with so much potential.
---
That's why I said unicorn lol. Because I don't believe they exist.
---
The most popular configuration I've seen is:
---
Tri Barrel
---
Prime Capacitor
---
Gunner Sights
---
A good strategy if that‚Äôs your only goal. My hope is that while guys like you do all the killing people will see that they can go grab ore without worrying about the scavengers dying
---
What is the end goal of this build? Bloodied? Junkies? How heavy is your PA usage going to be?
---
It‚Äôs in the Savage Divide, I wanna say between South Mountain Lookout and the Monorail Elevator.
---
If you find a big rock archway with a lead node, the cave is below. It‚Äôs not very big though.
---
I'm waiting for Liberty Prime PA to come back.
---
Hey man, I figured this thread was linked to bethesda, considering this is where there site pointed me to, when I tried to do a bug report, so i figured suggestions on the page would be read by them, but it seems i may have misread some people's tones and I would like to apologize for that to me it seemed like they were defending bethesda, I'm sorry if I may have read your comments incorrectly for anyone in this thread
---
They are all at the Sierra Maudre casino üé∞
---
Lucky bastard, I kid
---
See you in game shortly mate
---
Agreed. I've had a ticket open with Support for 50 days as of today.
---
This is really cool OP. Sadly, I think the reason we havnt gotten proper trading is due to engine limitations and not cus BGS sucks at UI (even though they do).
---
Only drops from Savage Divide events now, not including enclave events since they were removed from that loot pool. It's a 0.15% drop chance, but when it does drop you get both scout masks, the BoS jumpsuit, the white powder jumpsuit, and the whitesprings jumpsuit.
---
Savage Divide events include those like [Uranium Fever], [Guided Meditation], and [One Violent Night], but it also includes any event you can find in the Savage Divide, including [Mr Messanger], and Savage Divide Horde Events. Basically any event you find in the Savage divide

Bro I can't tell you how many times I've tried to do this just to have 2 people come over and obliterate it. Like, a really common response here is "Well, why are you getting pissed about a 2* lvl 35 legendary when your lvl 200+" tbh it's the fucking principle. The principle of not being a total shit bag and realizing farming legendaries are one of the 3 fucking reasons people get on the game at the later stages.
---
Its hilarious that I see people always harking to do this, yet probably 1/5 times I play does this happen. I didn't even realize there was a Legendary Sloth during Fasnacht because people would just camp its spawn and kill it. Now, I'm not saying a bad apple ruins the whole crop and everyone are douchebags, but I'd really like to see the kindness I always hear about this player base having just being more consistent. Idk why it's so difficult to literally tag something and just leave it. Believe me, it's not. I do it every single time that Uranium Fever happens. Tag the Legendary and I just cart it around till everyone has a chance. I stopped playing halfway through the Fasnacht even just cause this pissed me off so much.

Edited for grammar

Power armor is an acquired taste.  They are like a minivan.  There‚Äôs a certain stigma attached but they are just so damn versatile and efficient.  Good protection, lots of storage, ability to mod or add on, almost a non factor to repair.
---
Fair enough. Just FYI, this sub isn‚Äôt managed by Bethesda. It‚Äôs run by members of the community (other fans). Bethesda does read some of the posts here, but they don‚Äôt moderate or admin it.
---
I'm fully allied with both factions, yet Ward still has his eye on me after countless trips to retrieve his damn lost equipment.   Any why is he asleep 90% of the time?  The whole of foundation is slaving away hammering, welding, bitching, leaning in tighty whities musing about Jen, yet Ward is still sleeping.   I have MY EYE ON HIM.  At least Davenport is likeable and forgets that I screwed him over by selling the photos countless times.
---
Nothing. My worst was an Assassin's rolling pin though.
---
Is the prime capacitor for prime ammo?
---
Exactly. It shouldn‚Äôt be like that.

I like this idea. Good work!

Thanks, I did consider dropping travelling pharmacy.. but for some reason I can't bring myself to drop my stimpaks.

I've had an open ticket with Support for 50 days.
---
That sucks, sorry I'm doing some school work so I may not be entirely reading some of the feedback
---
Except that I always kill the guy that gives me crap at the front gate.
---
Yes, definitely watch the video by angry turtle.
---
When i have an explosive command I normally swap out tank killer for glow sight and remove 3* Concentrated Fire for Grenadier and a 1* C.F. If I don‚Äôt have an explosive weapon then I run Glow Sights and Tank Killer together
---
How about they not nerf a gun that already isn't used give it a buff and nerf the gat plasma that already was in a great place
---
After level 50 probably pretty high but not constant.  No goal for bloodoed or junky unless itd be ideal.  I dont like to maintain status oike drunk or drugged though
---
Discover the penitentiary and server hop. It'll pop up a lot. Its also a great lead farm there's tons of can chimes there that give 9 lead and 18 steel per string when you scrap them.
---
That place looks cool but has a bit of a bat problem.
---
Support is absolutely horrible. I've had a ticket open for 50 days as of today.
---
I'd keep the wanderer if she didn't have dirt all over her and nasty panties on.  She needs a run through the decon shower.
---
I think this engine could handle this.
---
Saw another reply from a user in a similar thread. He said that any Mr. Messenger quest can give this reward, even ones outside the SD - since they share the same drop table.
---
I think they were rushed, used the existing trade menu and called it a day. There's no reason they can't add additional UI's - I guarantee that if FO '76 was fully moddable this could be done with an equivalent to Fallout Script Extender. I've seen more radical changes to the UI in Fallout 4 than this.
---
I've stated this before, *legendary perks should not be used to fix balance issues.*
---
Energy weapons are under preforming for sure. They should either introduce normal perks to strengthen them or better yet, just buff the damn things directly. Tying things needed to actually make them competitive to ballistic weapons to an endgame mechanic is a horrible idea.

I was able to take out a legendary gutsy and that took out quite a few cores. I also love how the bots have zero regard for the safety of the mainframe.
---
AND it should repair all camp items to 100%.  OR at least give me that option.  Every other repair option in the game allows me to fully heal partially degraded items unless they were overhealed.
---
I've had a ticket open with Support for 50 days as of today. Absolutely zero help from anyone at Bethesda.
---
So, idk if this counts, but I built my camp in the acid lake(?). (I‚Äôm obviously very new.)
---
So, last night the servers where shutting down for maintenance, and I‚Äôm trying to just grab a bunch of junk and get to my camp. 
---
I get there. Omg. There‚Äôs around four of those weird creatures that freeze you, burn you, or irradiate(?) you. My fucking base is a shack. Like 3X2. Omg. I get there and they are fucking just going at my shit. I run inside. I have very little ammo. I was just going to dump my junk and go to bed. I was not prepared for this. 
---
I‚Äôm level fifteen these shits are like 22. I ended up walling off everything. No entrance. Hurriedly built turrets. They destroyed my walls in no time. I‚Äôm taking so much damage. I‚Äôm frozen. I‚Äôm burning. I‚Äôm frantically using my stimpacks, rushing to repair turrets and take the lucky shots I can. It was so intense. The whole time I was laughing my ass off though. It was a blast.
---
What would be worth repeating anything for, good gear? Like, doing Radiation Rumble gives you both Treasury Notes for the gold grind, and a chance at a valuable/good Rad Barrel Plan. And it's easy to fail if you're not an organized group. Same goes for the Encryptid, the event for Bear Arms, and soon the Colossus event. Queen also gives T-notes, two legendaries, repair kits and flux. Like, do you want better rewards than t-65, SS armor or the Gauss weapons? Do you want a WoW-like raid which needs careful planning and tons of people? I see 95 comments in this thread that all agrees with you, but I don't ever see a single suggestion as to what yoy would prefer, or even what an 'endgame' is, if Fo76 doesnt have one

That dude has class!
---
That would make sense, so yeah, I guess any Mr Messanger event will do, but it still only has that 0.15% drop chance. Not as bad as the 0.02% drop chance for the leather coat and the field jacket from the mire events though.
---
And here I thought deathclaws were the sexy beasts of the wastes.
---
So where would I go to leave feedback
---
Southern Divide just north of Dent and Sons construction near the scenic overlook there‚Äôs a cliff overlooking a missile silo. It has a view of the hornwright mega mansion, the rock hound, that one bridge, and top of the world. Probably my favorite view in the game. There‚Äôs also an unmarked campground nearby you can build on and get some free buildings.
---
Thanks I'm on PC
---
Yep. You'll pretty much need ultracite 2mm if you want to use the gauss minigun much. The amount of normal 2mm you get from crafting is nigh unsustainable for a gauss minigun.
---
Was just about to post about this it happened at least 5 times this week for me if I'm first there. I swing with my deathclaw gauntlet and it does instantly but event does not end as you describe above needs fixing along with ever event that has Mr handys in their pathing is completely messed up. On messenger they just stop still till timer runs out.
---
I think they should not add another mode, but rather fix the mode we have today.
---
It's very irritating to watch my health tick down to 0 when poisoned because my laser won't stop spinning.
---
They're one of the most interesting Fallout factions precisely because of their faults.
---
On this sub, maybe, but in the game I think literally any play style can be made to work with care in choosing gear and perks. I think anti armor, furious, vampires among others offer benefits but they don‚Äôt get discussed here much.
---
Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong but SE works outside the game engine though right? Wouldn't they need to make a significant overhaul to incorporate SE functionality into the base game? I'm not very mod literate so I'm genuinely asking here.
---
You got lucky my man. Keep doing it until your luck runs out lol. My heavy gunner is like 500 something and I can tell you there‚Äôs zero correlation between damage and reward. If you‚Äôve seen youtubers such as angry turtle and captainoob, you can see they get shit drop too when they solo the queen.
---
There are times I was the only contributor but got a one star tire iron, then there are times I got there late but still got something useful. But overall the queen‚Äôs loot pool is just like a random level 60 ghoul, it can be one to three star and can be armor, melee or ranged, or even a drill before they removed it from the loot table.
---
Some plans that can only be found from the roaming trader grahm, or any that are limited time (seasonal) event like fasnacht, meat week, or Halloween
---
An example of one from grahm I looked for for over a year was a metal picnic table, disco ball took about 8 months, and I'm pretty sure I bought them from other players in the end
---
Thanks, I'll have a look at what times Mister Sandman applies.
---
I don't like it, but it also feels like an uphill battle to get Bethesda to actually *do* anything about it.  I try to prevail upon them that this combination of more onerous grinds, while continuing to look the other way regarding hackers, is a very toxic combination for legitimate players.
---
There was a time when you could just ignore it.  Like people who showed up at the SBQ with Strangler Heart PA, back when it crashed the game, you just accept that people will be jerks and it happens sometimes.  But the hacked explosive .50 cal, in particular, has become so commonplace that you can almost *expect* that someone will attempt to use it during a boss battle.  And honestly, it sucks all the fun out of it.  No one is impressed by your ability to rain down explosive hell with a hacked gun.  Least of all against the Lv. 5 Radtoads in Fasnacht.
---
You say this but there are players out there with brains who enjoy more complex games. I‚Äôm not the best gamer ever but I enjoy this game and even at level 36 consider myself a better player than some of the higher level players who just want to shoot big monsters with a big gun. 
---
Surely in the future people will be making clans with the objective of accomplishing these end game missions and events.
---
Maybe one day we‚Äôll all get together and drink Nuka Cola on an island plagued by new cryptids and DIFFICULT quests.
---
See you there
---
God then doesn't care about this stein then. I have metal and the Fasnatch souvenir, wooden hasn't been spawned for me today so you know if are there any other one?
---
It's not to keep you out.
---
It's to keep ***it*** in.
---
It‚Äôs been hit or miss for me. But I‚Äôve been able to yell at people quick enough and explain how to do it, before they kill the boss a number of times.
---
Guess I‚Äôll have to see how much more it is, I normally avoid prime ammo
---
I am working on getting the strangler PA. Cuz it looks cool!
---
I am shallow like that.
---
4 speakers of equal size, looks closer to early Quadraphonic! This was from before they removed the 5th 'PA' speaker center channel for better spatial control and balance.
---
Thanks. I'll have a look into that!
---
Ikr!!!! It's like. I must watch this thing turn off before I can save myself.. think of the environment if it keeps spinning while I heal!! A disgrace xD
---
Thanks exactly what I was thinking, but I didn't know that they can't be displayed.
---
a six channel audio system which is usually a centre speaker, 2 front (L and R), 2 back speakers (L and R) and a subwoofer. The sub provides bass. the bck provides surround sound. So like if you're watching a film and a plane flies over head it sounds like it's flying overhead. 
---
You can get 2.1. Which is usually 2 speakers and a sub (most pc speakers are 2.1)
---
BUT you can get 2.1 surround sound bars
---
Stealth archer is so entertaining. I am so glad they added the bows. Just need to get a instigating compound bow. Yeah it is not optimal but shut up I am having fun!
---
It is much easier to not break the heart if you just use a low powered automatic weapon.   If you do too much damage too quickly, the heart heals itself.  Yes it is a bug AFAIK.  I can do the event solo and very quickly if I don't break out the big guns.  The key is hitting it sporadically, letting it stabilize before damaging it further.
---
That‚Äôs funny... but creepy at the same time..
---
Halloween pumpkin and pumpkin rack plans, fasnacht will make there way to rare over time, meat week flag plans, radiation barrel, circus cage.
---
Things that are rare but duped (of which many of the above can potentially fall into that category):  gorilla plans, about half the mounted plans (not going to list them), winter lights, Santa crash.
---
I think that about covers it.
---
If you don't play it, why bother following the sub and posting negative comments? 
---
Other than the grinding, the game is fun. Exploration is entertaining and Bethesda's environmental storytelling is great. I also happen to enjoy some of the events and the combat system. So... yeah. People DO still play the game, AND enjoy it.
---
I spent an hour server hopping in Charleston to get the cuckoo coo clock from responder bot. He never showed, but i killed my fair share of mr walkers
---
Yeah, shame really.
---
LVL 340 and I usually just cryo the hell out of the queen and let everyone else do the hard work.
---
Are you sure they are modded the same? When I plug them into the weapon damage calculator with all things the same, except for 5 addictions, the junkies comes out well ahead, unless using pre-nerf.
---
Sounds like it was fun üòé
---
Yep, more bang for the buck. Just be a pain gathering crimson flux :/
---
Bloodied against the queen is only really viable in PA imo, due to the Emergency Protocols. Uyielding is squishy af. Havent tried Bolstering though, but apparently the PAs has a hidden percentage based dmg reduction as well

My take on it - primary heavy, secondary non-automatic rifles. Bear in mind you'll be sacrificing a lot by using more than one weapon type. Also, you don't need to maintain drugs, all you need is being addicted to them.
---
I save cryo grenades just for this.
---
it's like this with all TES / Fallout games, bethesda are just lazy and they don't bother to make new dialogue for when people actually like you, or when they do, they don't remove the standoffish dialogue that should only be used when you haven't done any quests or anything to help the NPC. very immersion breaking, the main one i got irked about was when you side with the stormcloaks in skyrim and take whiterun from balgruuf (imperial lapdog), give it to vignar and he still has some dialogue in which he is rude to you, after you singlehandedly gave him control of the city (more of a small village, another bethesda problem: worldbuilding)

I was wondering why my 200 range flamer worked worse than a shortgun..
---
Sorry to hear that. Ghouls give me no issues.
---
Yes, Batteries Included - in INT.
---
Because I run a heavy weapons build, and I need that extra accuracy and AA. Regular armor is also so expensive and high maintenance, which makes absolutely no sense. I mean the huge suit of mechanized power armor should be the high maintenance armor, not some scraps of leather.
---
On my other characters (not heavy weapons builds), I never touch power armor.
---
Bloodied PA is superior unless you're doing melee. But still a melee unyielding is squishy at queen, even with Buttressed SS armor
---
Batteries included perk applies to fusion cores as well.
---
Batteries included
---
It's ok tho. I have other plans for them.
---
Lol thankfully I prefer stealth
---
that's odd, i had the option to spare him but i would have had to quit the quest and do it again after getting some chems to boost charisma for the speech check but the fact that he tried to betray me made me a lot less sympathetic to that option, i usually try to keep all NPCs in games alive but i don't think i can be bothered doing that anymore
---
I agree with others.  Don't stagger her in the air if you can help it. Don't stand on fences, tents or the top of V9.  She won't land much if at all.  The more people on the ground, the better chance she will land.  Also, keep the mobs cleared out because the Queen's attention often focuses on some random radroach in the grass that you can't  even see.  VATS the area often.
---
Actually, they do pay it. I didn‚Äôt know any of the vendor price standards and just put a bunch bulk scrap and plans in the machine for set value and I‚Äôve sold a lot! Players just don‚Äôt buy the plans they already know.
---
I was thinking on making a base like BOS on FO3
---
they already tried, there was a variation of it where you could hand it in as many times as you could server hop and speak to ward within the first 16 minutes of daily reset.
---
Which ones helps you at queen except the dmg boost in melee uyielding? The ap boost from unyielding? The only setting legendary effects are better than PA in a boss fight is the Troubleshooter's set at Encryptid
---
Amongst other things, keep an eye out for a bastard assaultron not far to the west of the station. It caught me out a few times as I was levelling. Once you've levelled a bit, it's well worth going back to Watoga and doing the quest line which results in overseer for the day.
---
My experience has been 95% nice people. Other times, like when my wife and I were playing together for the first time, she got targeted by two players who were around her level and they just kept 1 shotting her. I fast traveled to her and tried to help but they just kept killing us both (my character is lower level than hers) over and over again on sight every time we respawned. Can be super frustrating, but most people are nice :)
---
Ah so he's a regular. I haven't seen any of his posts til now.
---
From what I heard - not great as it suffers from all the usual VATS bugs.
---
I truly don‚Äôt understand why lol. If I don‚Äôt find your vendors within a minute, I‚Äôll just leave. Also put them all together unless you have a theme camp that has clever buildings for each type of shop that are clearly labeled. Takeaway is to not make people search for your vendors. If you don‚Äôt want them inside, at least put them by spawn.
---
luckily i dont use vats
---
I concur, my good man.
---
It fits perfectly into the universe.
---
I dunno my teammate does pretty well at the SBQ wearing a stealth suit and she's bloodied
---
yes, at twice the budget cost.
---
Haahahahhahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahah..... Ha...... Hehehe...  Sorry there's 10 year old exploits they still can't fix on this engine. There doing the bare min to keep it limping and add content while they plan on new games. I love the Devs they do what they can with 3 limbs tied up by corporates choices but ffs don't expect miracles.
---
Bloody builds... Ya that's intended...
---
There's already dupe exploits again a week after the vending and displays were Reenabled, hell there holes day of you could empty somebody's stash.
---
The base engine is fubar.
---
Small and detailed is far better than big and empty.
---
Shooting her in the air does make a difference if she gets staggered.  That is why I usually just tag her a few times in the air to get her attention and then focus on mobs until she decides to land.
---
it works with any type of wall iirc but the problem is that it takes up double the budget
---
Yeah, I mentioned that. Didn't say it was a perfect solution and I'd definitely much prefer interior walls. Just figured I'd point out that there's a way to do it for anyone that wasn't aware.
---
Wait for steam sale that's coming this month

Nope, just RNG. There‚Äôs like what? 24 of them.

You should've started blaring Prodigy - Firestarter over voice.

It's been over 2 months since Wastelanders, probably soon.

I‚Äôm definitely okay with a int based perk that increases energy weapon dmg.

Scabber paint PC.  Yeah, homemade outfit.  Replacer for summer shorts.

I didn't know you could get usual effects on armor in this game!
---
Has anyone tried renaming the weapons and see if it fixes the problem?
---
some people are suing stabilizer for big guns. some people run PA builds, some people like to see and show off cool skins.
---
i dont usually run PA, but sometimes i do for shits and giggles.
---
i think PA isnt that good, but that doesnt mean i wont EVER use it lol.
---
I am too that's even worse. I'm getting almost 200 base damage from my tesla with the auto receiver. It shreds soft enemies lol. Especially with sneak bonuses.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Ha. HA!

Your comment has nothing to do with this posts topic. I am simply stating this idea could work on this engine.
---
Ohhh my favorite perk. !!!!
---
I used to do that. Yes, pick that lock.

I'm basing my estimations based on what I've seen done in Fallout 4. I've seen UI's remixes on Fallout 4 which perform this level of changing to the interface.

Love this.

Pvp is the endgame

And the point of my post is that it probby can't the current system is prob by the best they can do.

If you have the plans for the craftable things, you can place some of them on the bed or shelves. I have a wavy Willard and the cat astronaut plush on my bed. But there's no way to place things you pick up, unless you build a display case and put them in it.

---
A friend of mine happened to her, but with the green radiation. But when I came to check it out, I couldn't see it on my screen but I could see it on here.
---
Food for thought
---
Yeah it is. I say that outside of the heavy weapons damage cards the next most important perk card is stabilized and then bear arms.
---
Fallout 4 survival mode was amazing.
---
I see that, wondering how often it's offered. Or are you saying it's always only part of a bundle?
---
Which style of heavy would you be after? Ballistic or Energy?
---

---
Mine is a bloody build but It can work the same. If you go Junkies it‚Äôll be a bit less damage but more survivability with full health. Junkies caps out at 50% with 5 addictions. I‚Äôd also recommend energy weapons if you‚Äôre using PA since you should use Batteries Included.
---
If you want to be tanky I recommend emergency protocols as it‚Äôs half damage at 50% HP.
---
I left Nerd Rage on just because it‚Äôs a good reminder that you need a stimpack at low health. I know I‚Äôm not the only one that gets tunnel vision. Alternatively you could also use Born Survivor in AGI and get the auto use.
---
I know I slotted Good Doggy in there but you could use any other QoL perk like maybe a rank of Ghoulish or Sun Kissed.
---
The refrigerated backpack mod is nice but it‚Äôs only 60%, Good with Salt is 90% and you can get the Grocer mod from the Settlers instead.
---
If you don‚Äôt want either of those you can mess around with it a little more and either max out Ricochet or something else. I vote Ricochet though, I only started using it recently but it can make a difference.
---
The only two mutations I highly recommend are Marsupial and Speed Demon but if you want to up your AGI and PER you can take Bird Bones and Eagle Eye since Class Freak will reduce their detriments.
---
Marsupial gives you extra carry weight with that jump increases and Speed Demon makes Lock and Load kind of redundant because you do get reload speed. Also, if you‚Äôre using miniguns, etc your ammo count is often high enough most of the time you don‚Äôt need to reload that often.
---
I also want to stress every weapon class has multiple weapons so taking on a secondary weapon type really isn‚Äôt necessary pulls away from your build if allocate cards towards.
---
It was. I‚Äôm still adjusting to relying on hot keys, so I came close to dying so many times. Lol. My motivation was like omg I can not die in my own camp haha
---
Third or fourth since what time period? Thanks!
---
pickup all the purified water you can, even from other camps (so long as it's not locked) and sell it to vendors. Easy 1.4k a day.
---
I would normally say you should complete the original main quests first, but the issue is that every day you're playing those original quests and havent completed Wastelanders' main quest is a day that you're missing out on Reputation increases for the two factions (which takes forever) as well as gold bullion to buy the good things. You want to do both of those very early so you can purchase the endgame weapons and start "rolling" for good legendaries via the legendary modules.
---
Plus, if you wait to do the original quests and finish Wastelanders first, the endgame grind will feel less annoying because you'll still have a week or two of other content to do, like the Enclave and BoS stories.
---
It's Wards missing property.
---
meee sending an inv now :)
---
So how about them bows ;)
---
Thanks for the advice. I'm trying to do both now since I was told about the gold bullions and reputations and their own grind.
---
They're not that heavy, and you don't need to carry very many of them. So stash a lot of them. You should regularly be going back to bed to get the well rested buff anyway. And there are plenty of places where you can get back to your stash box at the railroad stations or whatever.
---
I mean if you're trying to stay light enough to fast travel then it really doesn't matter where you are if you need to restock your stim packs.
---
In my stealth build I walk around with like 700 lbs and never fast travel at all. if you're being stealthy enough you rarely even need a stim pack anyway. If you resign yourself to walking instead of fast traveling and plan your actions accordingly, you can carry a half a ton of stim packs.
---
In fact I find the fact that I end up needing to manage my action points makes me even more careful and stealthy.
---
plus since I'm absolutely loaded down with junk, the park didn't causes carry to junk to reduce incoming damage ends up being super effective.
---
I got the same bug, and when I relogged, the quest reset to the point where you first meet AC. Did it work for you the second time around, or is this some sort of endless loop?
---
In Fallout 4, balancing wasn't an issue. You were the only player in the world so having an overpowered weapon didn't matter. If you could one-shot everything in the game, there wasn't anyone else in the world who you'd be depriving of a chance to get loot from bosses, and there weren't other players to engage in PvP with so the only unfair advantage you could have was against NPCs, not paying customers. The same reason we were allowed to have bizarre impossible mod weapons in FO4 which would be considered hacked weapons in 76. In a multiplayer game, fairness matters because you can ruin the game experience for other people. In a single player game, there are no other people.
---
Any Valve employees here?
---
‚ÄúOther then the grinding‚Äù? What else is there to do other then the same 5 events and 8 dailies lol I stay on the sub to stay informed IF the game decides to get good, my guess brotherhood missions will be as short as wastelanders and I will be bored again after a few days. If u enjoy the grind keep at it lol I personally don‚Äôt care to spend hundreds of hours grinding gear #notmyfallout
---
Fuckin ward...
---
God I love running into random weird shit left out there by other players.
---
*Raises hand* I'll take more ballistic fiber in particular please and thank you!
---
I have only seen it as part of a bundle myself.
---
Screw 'em. I kept all the gold.
---
That was my "Scorched Vaccine" cut.
---
90% nice, 10% dumb and or toxic
---
Very healthy mix. Lots of kind ppl. Every now and then you find the occasional pest
---
I just wish she'd wash her damn face!
---
I sold one about a month ago for like 400 caps &gt;.&gt; 
---
Next time I'll  hold onto em haha
---
Tha is everyone for there help and recommended methods! Will be trying them all out :) thanks again
---
FYI- Next time put what platform you play on üëç
---
For a higher chance at success I'd suggest posting your platform.
---
You're on my list. You're my new archnemesis. For real though that item is so sought after, you really went cheap there.
---
hahahahaha crap meant PS4
---
Yep, Gatling Laser is my go to for SBQ and other bullet sponge enemies that don't require protecting NPCs. I don't mind constantly unloading when there is an unlimited ammo supply at any power plant.
---
Iron Fist isn't great for it.
---
Speed demon and the fixer movement sneak speed don't stack.
---
The others that don't stack with it are as follows, Squad Maneuvers, Overdrive Servos (Power Armor Leg Mod), or the Sleek modification on leg armor. There's a 20% cap on movement speed.
---
The forums on Bethesda are a good choice. Even submitting and email or a ticket. 
---
It‚Äôs fine to submit here as well. But as this is a public forum, you‚Äôll have multiple viewpoints and reactions. You‚Äôll have to get used to that.
---
Except that's exactly what reaching for bloodied dmg in a game where nothing requires it is, overcompensating.
---
I‚Äôd be happy with either if my stash wasn‚Äôt constantly at 800.
---
Luck of the draw and lucky break can save you many trips to the workbench.
---
I nominate the arena in Watoga for an endgame minigame. It's perfect for both PvE and PvP. You could even have an endless horde mode that spawns more and more enemies the longer you go.
---
I think the bow is swell üòÅ
---
If you've noticed the complaining on this sub about the endgame grind, it's because they've already completed all of the content and their only motivation to log in each day is to increment the reputation bars and sell 20 treasury notes (you're limited each day, same as scrip). You've got a unique opportunity to *not* have that issue lol. 
---
Another note - make sure you're turning in your under leveled legendaries to the scrip machine each day to get your 150 daily scrip. Try to spend most of them on the legendary modules assuming you're interested in the Plasma Caster, Gauss Minigun, or Gauss Shotgun when those become available to you later
---
What do the words say I can‚Äôt read
---
Don't feel bad. I had a bunch in my stash and they disappeared after the event was done anyway.
---
Is it truly God-forsaken?
---
Seeing as how the same explosive bait was used to destroy the bots during fasnacht, I'd say they were overlooked by whatever check is in place to prevent damage to "allies"
---
Also her shitty yoga instructor-esque life advice...
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs a bug or intended but the explosive bait will damage camp objects.
---
Would smash 10/10
---
Stacking Unyielding shouldn't be possible but it is, while I'm running with 55 INT points for EXP boosts.
---
Bait bombs for some reason don't follow the normal rules. It's somewhat not talked about to prevent trolls from using it to be jerks.
---
Also, power armor frames. If you drop them or place them in the pathways the ghouls and other enemies will just be stuck, giving you good opportunity to shoot their legs to prevent further spawning
---
For me the most frustrating part is I rename important armor pieces to *unyielding left leg/ chest etc. and if you erase a letter and try to type it back in it wont accept the name. And some pieces allow me to name them left/ right while others only work if I dont spell them out and just use L/ R.. it's just dumb..
---
You're preaching. I don't think any of those guys that one tap the legendaries are on Reddit or even do any research on how this mechanic works. 
---
This is why we need an ingame text chat to let them know what's going on. Not everyone has a mic, I for one turn voice chat off because I dont want to hear a whiney kid yelling in my game.
---
Did you get the hat? I see you came to an arrangement with someone else for earlier today. If not I'm on for the time being but give me an advance notice as I'll have to switch characters.
---
Clearly, the npcs dont want em either.
---
Because game count radium as energy weapon. Devs disabled this drop, temporary, and still don't want to do anything...
---
That's what I thought ...can't display without puttibg a display.  Currently I only have a beer stein and a bowl that I can display on tables etc.  I am only at lvl 55 now so there is a lot of plan I still need.
---
I called mine Nuka Vaccine (I was affraid scorched sounded like you would become scorched even though it sounded cooler) but I too want to display it with Nuka's after I redo my place again I hope to do it more efficiently so I can display more items.  It kind of seems like a balancing act trying get it the way I want and still have space for vendors and displays and still have a decent looking camp.
---
Nvm figured it out
---
Still bugged
---
Yes, closed out all applications, restart console, shut down, cleared all apps, etc... nothing....However, there is a fix! ....I had A friend enter my  game, and the card reader appeared, and all was good. Welcome to West BGod Virginia 76 friends!,
---
Lmao.
---
Solo'd it a couple times, the loot just isn't worth it. They should've given it a unique loot pool but besides the junk item it drops that looks cool in display cases, it is just another 3* legendary.
---
I agree with this comment so much. There is no best build. It‚Äôs whatever suits you.
---
Do I like to run the Carnivore mutation and Cannibal? Yeah. Forget carrying food, maybe some flux for thirst.
---
Is this the best strategy? Who cares? It‚Äôs the Fallout way.
---
The paratrooper Loot Bag Glitches in the ground. Only on Fallout 76.
---
It‚Äôs on sale at Game stop used for 9.99
---
Ever hear the phrase ‚Äúrode hard and put away wet‚Äù?
---
Hmmm, maybe I‚Äôll remove this post then. But still, if I wanted to grief someone. Now I know. Thanks for the reply!
---
What are you like, 12? Nevermind, I'm just going to block your dumb ass and call it a day.
---
&gt; Though what's funny is that the ancient dessert, "Sweetmeats", was fried honey and not meat.
---
That's actually fascinating, thanks!
---
Me and my bf have killed it twice with the help of others. It was okay but there‚Äôs too much to do just to get it to spawn and then of course how difficult it is to kill 
---
So whenever that event comes out with it as it‚Äôs star, then I guess we will be killing it a lot more...
---
I made it heal in about 45 secs then nuked my self with a tree respawned and he was gone. I been telling everyone to hang out and go look for him.
---
*Finally*
---
I have my Blood Angel armor for when I feel like being an Angel of Death üòé
---
I was defending your post?
---
this, amongst the many many other mods missing from weapons and mods that existing weapons should have.
---
im looking at you 10mm smg...
---
Nuke mines can be used for killing players too. All the rads will kill them without "damage" works extra good on bloody builds.
---
A lot of the time I'll check the Vault 76 for newbies and fast travel to it to give them stimpacks, radaway, all of my 10mm, .38 &amp; .308 rounds.
---
I'm level 366.
---
Lol yeah I have no energy weapon perks normally so I do a base of like 30 damage with my Tesla. But I do keep a modest amount of cells handy.
---
At least someone is trying to fix it ;)
---
I only use Power Armour for aesthetic reason. I prefer looking like a tank, not like a squishy hooman.
---
Funnily enough I was doing exact same 3 days ago, wandered into there for mats and it was there. I‚Äôve fought and killed it 3 times before in the spots you can nuke two assault spots but it was actually massively easier there as it spawned stuck in the trees.
---
It only spawned 2 wendigos that chased me out of the forest and I killed it really easily solo with bloodied ultracite prime Gatling laser.
---
It was an enjoyable fight the time‚Äôs before and I died a few time‚Äôs (first time I fought it me and my friend died endlessly and at one point I was being gang banged by at least ten wendigos) but in the nuke grove it was easy as he was gimped sadly.
---
Yeah. He accused me not too long ago of being a Bethesda shill account, even though I‚Äôve been on Reddit since before FO76 came out. I came back to using Reddit more regularly looking for a community that had tips and strategies for the game. 
---
He‚Äôs so myopic he can‚Äôt imagine anyone actually enjoying this game.
---
Well, they're junk, so if you do any crafting that requires wood (or whatever they broke down into) itll eat them eventually.
---
Also a blue one, never seen the blue
---
Hats aren't worth anything unfortunately
---
Thank you, sir. And on that note, I‚Äôm removing this post with the new found knowledge
---
Yes, people are helpful. When I first started a month ago, a level 150+ dropped a bunch of aid and Armour for me. Some kid gave me vintage nukashine which lowkey could've screwed me over if I landed somewhere crazy. But it was appreciated. I try and do the same if I see someone is in the vault. I'll try and drop off at least some ammo for them.
---
A few nights ago someone did wanna PvP with me cause he kept shooting some explosive weapon at my camp and me. I just ignored him. PvP ain't my thing.
---
Hats aren't worth anything mate, sorry.
---
There's a buff called Ultracite gatling laser, those are not supposed to be on level with plasma/gauss ( yet manage to perform almost better than both on dmg/Accuracy/ammo availability ratio )
---
On the skin side i can't approve more tho.
---
I could see how explosive beam splitter weapons are OP but explosive radiums still underperform compared to an explo handmade :/
---
Hats are common and therefore worthless. The outfits besides green and brown are worth quite a bit though.
---
Means he didn't want to lose out on caps and essentially gift a weapon away.
---
Thanks, gonna put them in a display then
---
Sometimes I just use a paddle ball to get a tag on legendaries
---
Are they different? Stopped wearing it when wastelanders dropped and ferns were gone, it's bunny mascot life for me now. 
---
Don't think I've seen a bullion one to compare.
---
Hahahahahah I love it!!!!
---
Tbh I just trade, farm events, try to get insane melees, farm whitespring and west tek, and just meet chill people along the way. Maybe even do a bit of friendly pvp with them
---
Never honestly. I haven't had turrets in my camp for over a year now. I don't miss them- and I have tons of extra budget to play with since  I got rid of them.
---
They run under either rifleman or commando same as regular rifles.
---
I deleted my posts. I got confused about authors. Sorry.
---
Does excavator PA have higher carry weight than x01 with calibrated shocks? I get the 50 with each leg, I‚Äôve just never tried the excavator
---
They got hundreds upon hundreds of bugs that came from FO4 because they couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about fixing shit. They fucking NEED to switch to Unreal. Creation is trash and is horribly optimized.
---
I'd also add that the triple threat of aquaboy, photosynthetic, and Sunkissed.
---
Aqua boy lets you conveniently approach through the water.
---
And sun kissed and photosynthetic mean that all day long your rads are dropping and your health is going up. And one rank in each is plenty.
---
The time and frequency with which you end up needing to use your rat away and your stim packs goes down significantly.
---
Beautiful shotüëç
---
Use frog legs and aim for the feet for extremely easy kills. If you perk it out and use overdrive you can 1-shot. You can even 1-shot with an uncharged shot if you got a few adrenaline buffs going. I think I have a screenshot where I got it over 700 damage.
---
Ultracite Gatling laser is a different weapon all together. It has a higher fire rate at less damage per shot. It definitely doesn‚Äôt perform close to plasma/gauss but yes, has better ammo type
---
Miss your FO76 streams!!
---
This is pretty much it, even the lv 25 excavator suit you can craft is enough to do all the content in the game with it. Remember it lowers dmg you take by 42% before DR is even factored in, which is huge. Also lowers rads you take by 90% in a full pa suit before rad resist is factored. At lv 25 I was able to kill a lv 50 3\* legendary scorch beast and the thing could barely touch me. Took way to much ammo though as I lacked the perks and such but hell I wanted to see if I could do it. I like the excavtor set due to the +carry weight the set bonus has, though I wish it had a jetpack if it did, i'd use nothing else.
---
That is when you start blaring pornography over voice, while also demonstrating your amazing impersonation of someone having multiple orgasms at once.  All while your toon stares deep into the trespassing players soul.
---
If nothing else, anyone in proximity will be truly alerted to your vending machines :)
---
The imposter outfit is awesome. Looks more viking than native if you ask me though. My melee berserker wears it, its very fitting.
---
BE. If your speced with lvl 5 demo expert its better. Only possible downside is if you have a sloppy sneak build you get detected alot more with the BE over the Bffr. If you have a solid sneak build it doesn't matter as much. I had a Bffr, traded it for a BE25 and wouldn't go back. Wouldn't mind a B2525 for those super sneaky times but they don't come up that often. Oh and I still get better DPS with the BE. Sort of feels like a Bffr would just be a waste of bullets most of the time
---
They've been useless for a damn long while now.
---
I do it as bloodied. But i hate having the be encumbered to gather the ore. I play games to have fun. Fun, for me, is not slow walking through pools of radiation
---
&gt;I think a "clear all ghouls" daily would even be fun, with a slight potential for some unique reward at the end.
---
I mean that's what "Cop a Squatter" pretty much is, only it still autocompletes for everyone on the server.
---
I make sure my collectron bot never goes outside, cant let him start spreading Communist propaganda
---
Heh heh heh. I remember having such a setup. Then my right ear went out. Now I don't bother, and it makes me sad - I was quite the audiophile in my day.
---
Try to do all my treasure maps but then get stuck looking at vending machines and playing monster mash then farming for lead.
---
Preaching to the choir!!! I love stomping around in my power armor with my .50 and every Gatling gun just unloading on everything that moves lol
---
Yeah that assaultron killed me twice, once when it caught me off guard and a second time when I went back for my loot.
---
Lack of understanding? I think you‚Äôre the one with a lack of understanding. If you did have an understanding on the game engine and open source resources for it you would know that this trade menu idea would in fact work.
---
I feel ya, I turn my voice chat off as well.
---
Chemist backpack from the raiders will accomplish the same thing +30 pounds.. I‚Äôm in the same boat and the backpack changed my life
---
Power armor is strong and makes me flinch WAAAAYYYY less
---
Never
---
I been wondering if power user also makes plasma cores last longer for the plasma gatling myself. 500 shots for that a core would be nice when it hits as hard as the gauss minigun does (minus the extra explosive hit it does). Only issue with plasma gatling is its recoil is a bitch.
---
A full set of excavator grants a bonus 100 lbs. with calibrated shocks x2 you get 200 lbs of extra carry weight.
---
No other PA can compete with that, so as a PA build I‚Äòm kinda stuck with it :/
---
My CAMP isnt decorated for other folks, its for me
---
Good question. Upvoted for visibility!
---
Agree it needs one
---
from friendly -&gt; ally it took me about 1.5 weeks (3 hrs/day), the 1 week of that was just neighborly -&gt; ally.  my grind was:
---
- raider daily
---
- davenports daily (turn in to raider)
---
- server hop slocum joes (seemed to give me more raider RE's than marigold did)
---
I'm planning to redo it because I'm certain I can get it so you can't see any of the wood bases, which I think looks a bit better.  I used the same method of standing close and looking down to get them in there, had to stand on a chair to do the upper shelves
---
r/whoosh
---
But my backpack is powered by the power of fusion!
---
It‚Äôs all good. But it is a good idea for a trade UI. Now is there enough ambition on their side to make something like this? That‚Äôs the big question.
---
This is great
---
Glowing ones and Anglers have MUCH higher hp pools than other things their level don't forget. The lv 62 charred ghouls only have 300-400 ish hp or so. A lv 15 angler has more than that iirc.
---
Gonna take a LONG time. Also, do the Raider daily, given by Wren and Rocksy at Crater, provide mirelurk meat to the person (Blackeye? forgot her name) at Ohio River Adventures
---
My magic 8 ball says, "No" - but creating the wireframe was a fun 1/2 exercise all the same.
---
There are total jerks who will contest your workshop only to kill you until you leave they dont want the workshop..m
---
Oh man that‚Äôs so nice, and does it have noticeably less damage resistance than any other power armor?
---
I was checking out new vegas dlc and theres one that looks Egyptian the back portion of the helmet was made with shotgun shellz. And theres a war club with a horse head on top. Made me want more and then i seen the mountaineer outfit. 
---
My only problem is it probably be done through the atom shop.
---
When did I say that had to happen for free? Did you even read my reply?
---
Bethesda promised cosmetic only but that wasn't bringing in enough money so they started putting solutions to problems people complained about behind paywalls
---
What if you also get the mod for excavator that adds even MORE carry weight... though the price will make you cry, as the excavator mod plans are frigging expensive as hell.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm in constant need of acid
---
Did you stock up at Fasnacht? Each piece of Beeswax scrapped for 2 pieces of Acid. I went from like 300 to 3000.
---
Junkie's is good for a full health build.
---
Best defense - no turrets
---
The missle turrets are meant to work in conjunction with the spotlight. 
---
Wire a spotlight into the mix along with a terminal and use the terminal to tell the spotlights to target enemies. They work really well like this.
---
It does, but I find it‚Äôs still good enough for combat :P
---
Not ideal, but acceptable.
---
Thanks for that :)
---
It‚Äôs actually a sign that you need to more closely examine your life. üëç
---
Anything with bloody, furious, and Zealots legendary prefix and a prime receiver sould do some good damage to any SB and the SBQ provided you are within range before damage drop off
---
Well, you gotta admit junkies and bloody are both quite op compared to most other builds, no other build can really get close to the damage unless its a sneak atatck build. Problem with bloody is the low hp dmg buffs stack, imo only ONE should ever be active ever. The other problem is its too easy to keep your hp low, due to rad lowering max hp, remove that aspect and it'd balance the build a tad more since anyhealing will screw damage compared to now where they can spam it since the rads won't let it go higher. Where there is the same build almost every endgame player uses, thats a good sign its overpowered and needs some nerfing.
---
Other problem is how armor works in fo4/76. If the enemes DR is higher than your damage you can do, it sort of functions like damage threshold in fo 1/2/nv. Cuts dmg by half. The problem here is higher level things have too much DR, that you pretty much NEED bloodied or Junkies build to be able to hit it for any real damage other than sneak attacks. Average enemy has 2.5-3x their level in DR other than certain ones like scorched that have less and boss-class/robots that have more. what this means is a lv 50 enemy with 150 dr, you need to have a base damage after perks of higher than 150 to really do anything other than tickle it. After that DR-softcap on resistance you start doing exponentally more as you get more damage over their DR. That is why sneak attacks are so good.
---
Body attack with a 90 dmg hunting rifle on something? 35 dmg to body 70 to head, now sneak attack with same rifle/ 200+ to body 400+ to head, as it does enough to shatter its armor pretty much since you pass the 50% dmg reduction "softcap" Especially with covert operative, that 50% higher sneak damage is pretty damn huge when you add everything up. 5x dmg to headshots on human/animal enemies. Its why the stealth build with the chinese stealth suit works so well, it makes you damn near impossible to detect so you can just spam sneak attacks all day.
---
Bloodied pipe rifle for bloodied builds works well.
---
Oh yes, Honest Hearts was so good. NGL if they made Joshua Graham's armor available in the ATX I'd buy it for sure, 100%.
---
Maybe not anytime soon. We can hope though.
---
If you're on pc it may have been me. I usually take my gear off before the event to not 1 shot everything with my dc gauntlet, but forgot to until I 1shot the first mole miner leggo earlier today. If it was you I'm very sorry. I felt terrible as those kind of people piss me off too.
---
This seems very similar to the old school runescape trading system which worked very well and was, to my knowledge, non scammable. I would love to see this in game rather than having to use a third party as a courier, or have to hope the other person doesn't run off with an item they paid 0 caps for before giving me the item they promised. Not being able to trade anything to another player for nothing but caps seems ridiculous
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Kinda like Diablo's elite enemies?
---
Half and quarter (non-upper) floors &amp; foundations too.
---
Hats are worthless but I can tell you that nothing can beat this feeling when you run around Appalachia with a red asylum dress on you ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I have a shotgun build (out of preference) that can't cope with the sheer volume of targets, even though I do well against any individual hostile. My problem is that I show up and there's a heavy guy who can mostly hold it alone, but cannot switch places because I can't do the same. It's really frustrating because until I have enough cards to switch builds at will, I'm just stagnated. So I've given up on the Rumble completely and don't even go anymore.
---
We don't say his name profiligate.
---
I like to kill it, and then do the come here emote over its body and see how many thumbs downs I get
---
Brilliant that's very manageable. thanks I'll certainly include joes
---
Hell yes chily! 
---
Also Chily I only throw them to troll teammates haha!
---
No, you only need Animal Friend to perform the tame itself. You can then immediately swap that card out.
---
You on Pc I would like to see your camp one day?
---
Certain preset faces cause the clipping. It can be a bit of a chore but if you go to edit your appearance, choose a different preset face (can‚Äôt remember which ones don‚Äôt clip so backout to confirm) and then edit to your appeal this can avoid the clipping altogether.
---
I had that happen to me a while ago, and it was weird. I always wondered what happened.
---
Do they do that?  Neato.
---
YES!!!
---
Can you convert a Gatling Laster into an Ultracite one? Or no? I would like to keep my legendary effects
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll go look that up right now
---
I got wrecked by a laser turret in a silo and had the fire effect happen to me last week. It actually started to turn my body into an ash pile, when I respawned I was on fire.
---
Loll
---
Well, they spawn with a random combination of abilities. Fire breath, laser beams, etc.
---
Faster movement speed while aiming.
---
I can‚Äôt really bring myself to play the game without purpose for too long.  There isn‚Äôt much for a person who likes story/action to do once they reach a high level, and after doing rep grind I don‚Äôt really want to do much else.  
---
Interesting to see how others play but I just can never find much to do that isn‚Äôt just some pointless cycle.
---
I've never had a problem with it before, but then again this is the most damage I've been able to output at one time. Normally I run with just the &lt;20% HP  and maybe +20% damage from glowing meat steak and mutant hound steak. First time I've tried to rush it with an "unarmed" bloodied weapon with +70% damage. Lesson learned, I guess.
---
Compounded with the fact that they take up huge chunks of budget, you‚Äôre almost always better off without turrets.
---
I've been thinking about this recently, and I think I may have a solution. When a player is in a public event, they earn can earn participation points. No points are earned without active participation, so if someone is AFK, little to no rewards. Points are earned by the number of hits on an enemy, so one shoting enemies earns low points. High health enemies like SBQ (or event boss) can earn lots of points if you take them out slowly, and adds to fights are a good way to earn points too. The number of points you have at the end of the event determines your reward. The only downside I see, is if somebody comes along an one shots everything, then nobody earns enough points, but it's already like that as is. This would at least incentivise people to go slower which gives others a chance to get hits in.
---
Solo'd it with a Gauss Minigun. Took me a while, but I wouldnt go out of my way 2 say its overly difficult, so long as you have the spare ammo and dont let it stomp you.
---
I can't read what you are responding to, but I'm guessing it's the punk I blocked. If so, I'd advise giving it up. Such fools don't listen no matter how carefully or politely things are explained to them. Best to block and move on.
---
Yeah this happened to me the other day. I have Daguerres console in my workshop, which is a 1x2 square room, so its pretty cramped, we were basically on top of each other when I fast travelled to a station to sell some stuff and she came with. At first I thought another player had just teleported into the area at the same time, until I realised it was Daguerre in the imposter sheepsquatch outfit I had her in. Very weird.
---
I don't know, after the event, most players left but about 5 were oddly following me around trying to hit me with stuff before they left.
---
In the files.
---
There are loads of great places for public events, i love environmental storytelling, and it's a big part of the fallout games but they *really* rely on it in 76
---
The head wrap is a must. Honestly id buy what i can if they did a bunch of unique outfits. Even the one that only fo1st members get which should be available for purchasing aside from fo1st
---
Yes. They show up right after the caps reward...not in the list of rewards. The indicator is like the caps and scrip ones. Depending on who you talk to, there's a 10-20% chance of getting one to drop.
---
There is a visual bug that prevents them showing up in your Pip Boy collections screen. If you want to be sure, to check your actual total, go to one of the Possum Vending Machines. The total there is your actual amount.
---
Somehow I timed mine just right and got allies with the settlers and raiders the same night.
---
Survival mode was removed because not enough people played it, apparently it's not coming back but I keep a tiny flicker of hope alive
---
Nuclear Winter is a Battle Royale mode that basically replaced survival mode
---
If you haven't been on since before wastelanders there's a whole new main questline to play through, they did a great job with it
---
You can do that?
---
This is brilliant. Thank you for capturing this work of genius for us.

When you hit 20 try to get a Gatling gun, its a heavy weapon with a fire rate of 20 (or 25 with speedy reciever) but it almost hits as hard as a simmlar level hunting rifle. Uses 5mm ammo, once you get one of those your pretty golden, go to the lucky hole mine, in one spot there is a guarnteed spawn of a npc with that weapon and it ALWAYS drops it, sometimes drops 2 even, one on floor on kill and one in corpse. He'll be in the room that looks like a church altar. Think you gotta be lv 20+ for him to drop it or else he'll drop you something else.
---
Me either, and I've also run it plenty. I'm sure it's still a possible drop though.
---
i wonder if a loot based survival game mode would be fun. something similar to escape from tarkov.
---
you buy a ticket in with caps (a good caps sink)
---
you spawn in with nothing, no mutation, ledgendary gear ect like NW
---
the whole map is stripped down like it is in NW and then the goal is to loot the colored crates for special items, currency ect.
---
things like a special nuka cola, bulk ammo scrap, rare junk, a free purveyor roll  ect
---
then you try and get to an exit point with your loot, or get killed and lose it all.
---
Almost all the time yeah, but there was one time where I fast traveled to a guys camp to see his sho and spawned in behind a locked door and he was on the other side, he got mad at me for some reason and proceeded to pull put a explosive laser and shot at me killing himself. After a while I realized he wasnt coming back. Then a few minutes later I got the "death from above" notification on my screen from no other than the same guy, I checked the map and saw it was dead center on my camp...üò§
---
Yeah it was that guy. He stated there is no understanding on ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on under the hood‚Äù of the game engine in regards to this posts topic.
---
Hey dweller, you're finally awake.
---
PvP worlds are gone
---
Nuclear winter is a battle royale mode
---
There are a few new events and a new story line (Wastelanders). You can still farm gear, farm the new gold currency, and use it to buy new weapons and armor. I am sure there are other things people do but this is my normal playing (lvl 210)
---
Anti-armor+stablized in intel is 95% armor penetration, if using a plasma gatling or a gatling gun you'll hit for almost full damage every shot. I usually just run with the excavator set myself, I like the carry weight bonus.
---
Gotcha thank you. I just didn‚Äôt know what wouldn‚Äôt stack with it.
---
Yeah definitely a thing, I have been doing it every chance I get, probably over the course of 50+ events I have earned myself 5-6 possum badges.
---
I had a guy help me when I was lvl25. (175 now) he was 212. He gave me so much legendary armor and weapons my
---
Stash bock filled up lol and even crafted me a lvl25 fixer. I used it until I got to lvl 50 lol
---
I‚Äôm not extremely high level, 210. But I have completed most of the things I‚Äôve wanted to, and love the weapon and armor set I have though there are some better ones I have. Like I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd trade my BE 33Vats Gatling Gun for even a B2525 Fixer. I just love it‚Äôs one shot and ammo saving nature while giving me the flexibility to be a melee build.
---
I don‚Äôt really compare myself to others, so there‚Äôs no bad feelings if someone else has crazy stuff and I don‚Äôt. I play for myself, and for the fun I want to get out of the game.  If people want to dupe, then that‚Äôs on them. They may have nice stuff, but they won‚Äôt have that feeling of accomplishment that someone else has who got it legitimately. And no one can dupe that or take that away from you.
---
Maybe I‚Äôve been lucky, but glitching and griefing haven‚Äôt been too bad for me. The worst thing I experience is someone one shotting legendaries in events, like Uranium Fever or One Violent Night. 
---
For rare items, if people want to trade rare items, it doesn‚Äôt bother me, I trade extra items that are rare. And it gives a good option for those who have as many of that rare item that they want and want to get rid of the extras for another item. 
---
But I do feel like some rare items should be non trade able like a benchmark of what you‚Äôve accomplished, like the Father Winter Helmet. 
---
I hope that answers your questions on my thoughts about it.
---
I thought it was an atomic shop item that got removed a while ago. Not sure
---
What is PA?
---
TiL a lot of high level players on top of their tents is why she never fuckin lands. I never see lower levels up on top, it‚Äôs always the dudes that are like 100+ on top of tents n shit.
---
Pretty much for nuke zones your going to want to use power armor, anywhere else though normal armor is good enough. 90% reduced rad dmg taken before Rad Resist is factored in is huge
---
Multiscopes, actually! If you‚Äôre into collecting or displays it‚Äôs actually a ‚Äúclean‚Äù version of the Microscope and also matches the Enclave bunker item ‚ÄúHigh Powered Microscope‚Äù. 
---
Useless info of the day... out!
---
Yeah, but the burrows is an instanced location so it would avoid the mass reward, and it's a bit more sprawling and packed than any cop a squatter event. You'd actually have to search the whole area and all the tunnels to clear every ghoul. It'd at least give it some purpose beyond being a dungeon full of ghouls there's no reason to go to.
---
The mutate thing isn‚Äôt a thing really.
---
It all began with a bug that happened when you did too much damage too quickly and the enemy regenerated.
---
Now, a normal game would‚Äôve fixed it and moved on, but bugthesda spaghetti code is so bad they couldn‚Äôt fix it, so they just added a voice tag to it saying ‚Äú blah blah mutated‚Äù and then purposely replicated it on a couple mobs so it looked purposeful everywhere it‚Äôs happening.
---
Now, they get to ignore it, say it‚Äôs working as intended, and act like nothings wrong.
---
This is the bugthesda game plan in action, so asking for more on this patchwork bug is going to get you nowhere, but at least now you know why.
---
Funny thing is you do have defense against bullets. Iron clad does it, armor adds defense, and if you really wanna be tanky use power armor. Which seeing as you use heavies, you probably already use it. There is no perk in the game to add explosive damage resist and explosive damage ignores armor.
---
Whats the guild name?
---
Thank you for the tip
---
Too much coke.
---
&gt;It is going to happen. I promise you that.
---
Based on...?
---
Explosive weapon in general need an overhaul. Between the Fatman, Missile Launcher and Both grenade launchers, they lack in damage by a huge margin.
---
Pictures are stored in \[User\]/Documents/My games, aka the same folder as the ini files.
---
If you had two separete drives and got rid of the secondary one, you deleted all of them.
---
I was thinking of trying that tomorrow when I‚Äôm online again. Sounds crazy but honestly who knows lol
---
I avoid PA like the plague.. 
---
only time I touch it is for the quest.. and then I drop it asap
---
True, but the added radiation damage might create an unfair PvP advantage. I mean they could've just nerfed it like they did with other explosive ballistic weapons, but Bethesda likes to be inconsistent about things I guess.
---
Odd coincidence that after the event ended, while several players left, a few were following me around for a bit hitting me, possibly with healing weapons or something. My health was relatively fine. Oh well.
---
K, I'm completely wrong..... then wtf is 76 the shit show it's been since launch and continues to be ? This is as an outsider looking in believing I know nothing. 
---
Yes  the engine files and the open source mods show the whole story, no company ever hides proprietary backend code or there entire server infrastructure. 
---
Convince me, show me the programming that would make this work. I honestly believe systems in place were the best the Devs could get in place. 
---
Don't forget you have to give corporate a reason to add it. Considering Fo1st the overhead for secure trades would have to be paid for somehow? 
---
There's one thing I Learned in 30 years of IT work there is it should work this way and then there's real world usage.
---
But hey I'm cynical reddit troll wtf do I know right /s
---
You can!  I had one for a while, just flying around in circles above my camp, until some schmuck blew her out of the sky. So sad.
---
They don‚Äôt  
---
it‚Äôs another buggy , broken ass game mechanic that will never be what it‚Äôs supposed to be and also has a horrid UI and takes up waaaaay too much camp budget.
---
Yeah but that was the red shift outfit I tried to post a picture of the communist commander outfit but it wouldn‚Äôt let me
---
Both the weapons have unique names that i gave them already, so idk if that would do anything. 
---
For those curious, the fat man is Big Boy and the MIRV is Keller Family Special.
---
It never decreases. It's the same from level 1 to infinity.
---
Someone take a pic on the chair recreating the "Is it live, or is it Memorex ?" ad.
---
People want to have their cake &amp; eat it.
---
Yeah she followed me to Line In The Sand a few days ago and stayed for the whole event shooting at the Scorched.
---
If you‚Äôre as old as you‚Äôre claiming to be you type and act like a fucking child.
---
Thanks for the tip. I ended up making one but handy to know for others
---
When my camp was in Savage Divide, I had a combo of heavy lasers and missiles that wiped out most attackers, sometimes before I could look up from crafting and run outside to join the defense. They only struggled vs supermutants, and one time when I wasn‚Äôt there, a scorchbeast kited in from Ft Defiance and wrecked the whole camp.
---
Since I moved to The Mire though, the turrets do almost nothing vs the mirelurk kings, gulpers, and anglers I usually get. Not to mention the Sheepsquatch that showed up one day and trashed all the turrets plus my fusion generator. I‚Äôm starting to suspect the turrets attract beasts that might otherwise not have aggro‚Äôd to my camp.
---
Also I‚Äôve had trouble in recent patches where some turrets disappeared. The wires are still there, attached to midair, but the turrets are vanished and don‚Äôt rebuild when I use the camp object to repair all. They seem to still be taking up camp budget, though. I‚Äôm wondering if moving/rebuilding my camp would solve the glitch, but it‚Äôs a hassle to replace/rebuild.
---
Edit: because auto-correct ducks.
---
I don't know where you get your numbers about the fire rate and dmg, i have both, the ultracite hit for more than the classic and has the same ( or could be better, hard to spot ) rate of fire.
---
Wow nice going for the person attack cool blocked bye bye
---
Just going off what friends told meü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÖ

Bye
---
Added to the list Rhylee! :)
---
Ok well thank you at least I took some screenshots and shared them with friends so I can at least have a cool background. Thank you
---
this is a little old now, but for whats in it should still be true.   it should help you with your budgeting 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I solod it, but it took several respawns at the vault ( ty bugthesda), plus multiple guns running out of all my ammo. So, it cost a lot to do it.
---
The tactic I took was:
---
1. Kill off the shrieker head in vats ASAP- can‚Äôt do shit if your constantly made to run away.
---
2. Next target the lobber head to remove that nasty aoe ranged attack.
---
3. Kill off last head
---
4. Take out its legs ( just in case - it didn‚Äôt move much in the sundew forest anyways, but still)
---
5. Finish from range.
---
If your melee...I don‚Äôt even know , since you can‚Äôt get those heads down- seems like another balancing issue yet again.
---
Also, it has shit tier drops as usual, so totally not worth it after doing it just to do it.
---
Thats what I ended up doing. I keep running into the silo code carriers pretty much everywhere I go lately so would have been nice if they would count somehow but those three are definitely just as easy. Thanks for the tip
---
What is this a reference to?
---
Cool man thx alot you just saved me alot of time running nuke silos
---
OK, I honestly wasn't 100% certain on that as I don't have a melee char.
---
i think that would make more sense then a battle royal. fallout has always had strong scavenging elements. 
---
you want to escape with the loot, everyone else wants to gank you for that loot just like an actual wasteland. creating an incentive to hunt people down, AND try and evade other people, which ever suits you.
---
and having a low risk to try, and high rewards for success would be good.
---
plus bethesda could reuse alot of tech they developed for NW
---
Raider punk was sat in the chair and i had to wait for like 2 minutes for him to shift :p
---
Thanks, i couldn't do without fast travel, but I might try to part with the vast majority of them
---
Just give up on them and use the extra budget for something else. Most of the time I get mobs at my camp when I‚Äôm there anyway.
---
ü•∫
---
aye  ign globeadue
---
Instigating is my favorite on the Gauss Pistol.
---
idk
---
i main vats uny+ap non sneak build with bloodied+vats legendaries and i just spam vats+rightclick vats+rightclick and oneshot everything around me without having to pay attention, honestly it's even easier than emergency protocols PA which is my current build, and thats only because of the miniscule effort of having to manually move your cursor around instead of pressing keyboard button+left click
---
I do a stealth build so nothing will ever beat the Chinese stealth armor.
---
You can convert it with a Ultracite magazine, but it's always going to be a bit inferior to the Ultracite model ( It's still a solid weapon don't worry )
---
I've got grocers backpack at the minute, but I'll have to have a look at which whether food would be easier to get rid of than stims. Thanks.
---
The fact alone that people load in at different times has made me never come back to that mode. I ONLY did it for the ghilly suit which is nice but my god this mode is embarrassing. Perhaps even more so because of the fanfare they announced it with ‚ÄúFUCK YA WE PUT A BATTLE ROYALE IN FALLOUT!!!!!‚Äù
---
I came across one that said "That Bitch Carole Baskin Killed Don." I had to snap a photo and add it to my loading screen.
---
This isn't a people problem, it's a systemic one. Bethesda does a terrible job at informing &amp; guiding people to do the right thing.
---
For instance, for Free Range if the only way you could ever get those legendaries &amp; xp was the successful completion of the event, you watch how hard people will work to complete the objectives.
---
Info &amp; reward structures are poorly designed by Bethesda.
---
Sounds like the whole game..so sure why not? Better than nothing.
---
You could nuke stuff yourself. Very often doing one nuke will get others doing more nukes or being more active. 
---
Yesterday I did one nuke someone did the other two, then I travelled to surface to air and about 5 others joined, then afterwards someone did encryptid and even free range had 4 players. 
---
Then I was wandering for mats and ended up helping along some lower levels venturing in the nuke zone, letting them last hit scorchbeasts and tanking the grove aggro etc. 
---
Bit of activity can Encourage more.
---
I leave some fertiliser and toilet paper on the beds of those camps.
---
Oh hell yeah. I like the sound of that shotgun! 
---
Thanks for the advice on that. Are there scrip and gold bullion limits like the 30k cap limit?
---
Playing this game hurts my soul sometimes. Alot of grinding and nothing new just waiting for missions and grinding treasury notes. Im hoping for some cool stuff to use the gold on. But im not that hopeful. I just got some dlc for new vegas. Thinking of revisiting.
---
Ok basic done got codes well a card and the current codes lol. The freaking reactor repair is killin me. Gonna try my ultracite pa that i found first week of this game. Found 3 sets just sitting in someones camp so i took them lol. Frustration is at 11 right now but progress.
---
I‚Äôll send you an add next time I‚Äôm on
---
Thanks for the info chief, stay safe!
---
I've been looking at the challenges and am trying to get all of the possum and tadpole badges.
---
In a battle royale that has maybe the worst mobility of any BR frog legs is absolutely OP. There are so many times I‚Äôm just trying to scale a small cliff to get in the circle and I can‚Äôt but I could if I had frog legs.
---
Wheres it at? On my way.
---
Good doggy perk under endurance. Need like 2 cans of food an hour, just need to carry 10 cans, 10 water and you‚Äôre good for hours. Cuts waaayyy down on food needs
---
Best to do it on a private server because other people want to talk to rocksy and it can bump you out. If this happens, quickly switch servers and it might continue working.
---
This. It's not going to happen. Not worth the resources.
---
Personally, I am completely overwhelmed with all the builds and perks...I have no idea how people get so strong and I can't be bothered to figure it out I suppose. I am no good at min/maxing or optimizing anything. I don't know how to do half the stuff people who have played as much as me know how to do. I've never launched a nuke. I've barely even participated in them. Sometimes it feels like I don't know anything about the game and I worry I'm missing out on so much...but I also don't want to spend all my time watching videos or reading guides haha. 
---
What do I even do when I play?  I'm not really sure to be honest...I enjoy when I play, but really probably have only scratched the surface of what I can even accomplish.
---
I run one of those currently, I'd say drop white knight as if you're sneaking armor repairs are rare. Consider adding adrenaline instead, maxing tank killer and maybe fireproof in endurance instead of what you have. You could also drop traveling pharmacy for the chemist backpad mod from the raiders instead, freeing up strength for blocker. I also run batteries included so I can carry all my ammo and cores, gunsmith isn't really needed as you can just use weapon artisan to give you 200% durability.
---
To be fair it looks good, it's all personal tweaks at this point really, you have all the main skills covered excepting max tank killer and adrenaline.
---
They did get a buff, that's true. They're still incredibly expensive to fire which means they're still not used very often.
---
Shotguns are cheap to fire, and can still put out decent damage despite the nerfs. I imagine they're still used more often.
---
Yeah I agree. i dont mind the random non legendary weapons and armor so much because I scrap those down for decent amounts of steel with Scrapper. The non used ammo is a pain in the arse though. A few pieces of the rarer scrap like ballistic fibre and fibre optics etc or those ammo scrap packs like you can buy from travelling vendors as someone suggested would be far more useful and appreciated
---
Does it say ‚ÄúInaccessible. Content available at a later time‚Äù ?
---
If so that‚Äôs a server issue. You have to hop servers or fast travel away and back. That place and Van Lowe‚Äôs is bugged out. Content post vanilla still has loading problems. I‚Äôm surprised more people haven‚Äôt had instance issues in the Wastelanders content too.
---
Edit: I‚Äôve been able to go in there multiple times no issues without the event.
---
Usually collect waters from my purifiers, and then daily‚Äôs/ hop around from events.
---
I think we all do.
---
Smoke machine might make a good subwoofer,
---
Maybe personally I found the actual Nuking process the most miserable experience in any video game ever so I‚Äôll never launch one myself again. I guess I got used seeing the whole server on fasnauht
---
All it needs is a reclining skeleton and some sunglasses
---
Modded the same and I didn't select the pre-nerf on the two shot. I must have made a mistake when calculating them cause now the Junkie's registers at 345 on the website and the TS only registers for 278.

Is the 278 for both shots combined or is it for each shot individually when they both hit, so 556?
---
It has too. I had a possum badge and never had completed any challenges before.
---
They're not telling you to kill your next door neighbour are they?
---
I didn‚Äôt even know they existed In this game. I‚Äôve been all over and haven‚Äôt seen ONE of these fuckers. Anyone got some locations? I‚Äôm itching to go on a genocidal run now I know they exist.
---
Ahh that's helpful but I had project paradise show up almost finished it by myself had the level 2 bear and the boss got me and cornered the bear but I was able to craft the formula p
---
I hope your kidding. Pvp in this couldn't top either of those even if done right
---
Some ammo just doesn't sell. 45 and 5.56 is all day lomg..most others blahhh...sits for a week or two.
---
Thank you. Ill check it out and give it a try
---
I have to admit after doing so many recently it does get a bit tedious, but it‚Äôs something to do every once in a while, especially if everything is stagnating. It tends to get other things happening. 
---
I‚Äôve been activating encryptid a lot lately trying for the fixer plan and that‚Äôs been good fun and another way to get people moving and doing stuff I‚Äôve found. 
---
Some worlds are definitely just dead though with people doing their own thing or just vendor hopping.
---
"Feeling cute, might delete later"
---
But what about plasma cores though? 
---
Honestly. I‚Äôm genuinely intrigued as to what is fair price for them. I have mine set for 50.
---
Oh maybe. I thought it would take it from the scrap box first but this could be it.
---
When the small animals weren't appearing in game i got the guy running from the chicken random so literally he was running from nothing then got the piedpiper one just a eye bot playing the flute
---
Cool, thanks for the info. I'll definitely get some friends together if I'm on a private server, or be sure to show up in public now that I know it \*has\* to be team effort.
---
There is a fair amount of new story missions which will level you up quick, if you need extra levels to switch your build.
---
She's terrible. During her infinite quests I truly hoped that they would allow us to "erase" what's left of the deceased raider's soul from her circuits as a payback for what she did to us and the Firebreather

God speed.

I got my first character to level 78. I came back A few months after the wastelanders release and decided to start again to experience it all levelling up rather than at high level from the start. 
---
Don‚Äôt regret it at all. Loved the experience with a bit more knowledge, it‚Äôd been long enough so the original storyline wasn‚Äôt fresh in my mind and not boring, and I mixed it with the new content to keep it fresh.
---
Currently level 150 on that character and still enjoying myself. I‚Äôm really glad I didn‚Äôt trounce all the new content with an old character.
---
For some reason when I first saw this I immediately thought about my cat. ??
---
That's what I was planning to do, and I confirm that it works !
---
Thank you :)
---
Do both. If you're old character is like most people's first it'll be a diabolical shambles but it will at least let you get a feel for the new stuff then start a new one.
---
Ah yeah, inside the actual nuke zone you have very limited options. A non-PA/Stealth Suit would only work outside, which is why the queen is more often pulled outside of it
---
I was faced with a similar situation when returning for wastelanders, I started a new character, helps you learn all the gameplay systems again and if you're anything like me you may not remember where your build was headed, so starting fresh will help there too.
---
Down voted because no subwoofer.
---
Yeah, but they're pretty darned cheap, and useful too.
---
The expensive stuff is the paste and the pads. Around ¬£25 for the whole thing - toolkit, paste, pads and optional compressed air.
---
Takes about an hour, but cannot recommend enough.
---
That‚Äôs literally it. The ferns are gone on the OG ones. The wastelanders ones actually have leaves
---
KPJ420 could've been we try to get people to see this game can be super fun and in my opinion is all about working together ( we all lived 25 years in a vault together per the story) and helping people makes the game fun cuz there's not much to do but grind gold  script and rep
---
And yes theres alot of us the other day me and my cuz were playin saw a lev 5 get killed by a 100 plus at Poseidon and we were like hell no we gotta get em so we killed him a few times and it  looked like a group of 4 PA heavy biuld came with the same thought so it was me (93) my cuz (45) and 4 others (100 +) vs the griefer it was a glorious site to see
---
I vendor hop like a mf on ice and blow my sweet caps on the cheapest crap I can find.
---
Yep! You can only hold 5000 gold and 1000 scrip. Also, you can easily exploit one of the Raiders daily quests to get to Allied within an hour;)
---
It's their calling card. Gotta ***just*** miss the mark on everything or it isn't a Bethesda game.
---
Ya, anti-armor is a nice flat damage bonus with no downsides.
---
I've seen some info that they did fix anti-armor on energy weps, but it's not quite as effective as ballistic weps.  The calculation is done at a different stage so it doesn't quite get the same bonus from other perk cards.

I literally mean the device, not your whole camp. Moving the device by pressing E on it in build menu lets you move it, which changes your spawn location. I'm sorry if I'm obvious, and the downvoters thinks I'm being obnoxious
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied build but rolled a two-shot gauss pistol the first time I crafted it. I haven‚Äôt crafted one since because it works so well when I do use it (not a primary pistol user). The damage is great and the extra shot sometimes hits/kills mobs I wasn‚Äôt even aiming for if a group of enemies are close together.
---
I wear mine on the back of my Stealth suit with my Deathclaw mask and I love it sooo much!!
---
They would better start with NW.... and with gunplay
---
You're surprised at this point? &gt; 75% of posts are telling everyone how to play the fucking game their way.
---
I started out like A level 4 a month ago I‚Äôm level 40 now so you level up pretty quick especially if you go to glass caverns when you‚Äôre like level 15
---
I have become Death.
---
lol, no, that‚Äôs my dog. jk, I can‚Äôt make out what, if anything it says, or they could have used some weird track for wind which is why it sounds like whispers.
---
Sounds like a good limit with my current 0 golds hahaha. Help a brother out with more on that exploit, in case I get stuck in the grind.
---
That matches what I was getting and my understanding of the effect is the one shot does full damage and the second projectile does 25% of base weapon damage before perks are calculated. This matches what the weapon damage calculator shows meaning that's the total for both projectiles.
---
My bad, I didn't know haha
---
I sell a lot of legendaries real cheap

I'm selling a level 5 assasins shovel for 9999 caps if you want it üôÉ

noooo PA is shitty compared to normal armor you should be using SS!

hehehe 8 foot tall metal man go STOMP STOMP
---
Just paying it forward comrade!
---
Where is the info for the conversion rate? Last I saw it was only the machine itself that was datamined.
---
Im still surprised the nuke didn't kill the queen on its own
---
I do quests, wander around the map. I've found some really cool shit, soiled my britches at a few stalking mothmen, and seen some really cool details.
---
Which I'm ok with. They either charge everyone to play or they offer a lesser experience for much less
---
They datamined alllll that info so we know exactly what the conversion rates are for everything and they are ***bad***. You'll see.
---
Juicehead on YT did a video with the info last week I think. All the big fo76 youtubers covered it.
---
If you want to get rep faster, when finishing up the daily quest ALWAYS choose the option that results in you getting no reward (ie deny a reward through dialogue). You'll miss out on a few caps, but you get an extra rep bonus. It makes a big impact in the long run.
---
&gt;Nobody else seems to be hunting the WC down?
---
If I'm dropping on the queen I'll make sure to hit the sundew grove, but I'm not wasting the time nuking the other spawn points when there's only a 15% chance of him spawning.
---
Also, the rewards aren't worth it. Why waste time and ammo killing him for an assortment of junk and a 1 star legendary when I could clear West-Tek in the same amount of time and get tons of scrap and 1-5 legendaries?
---
&gt;Anybody actually managed to solo it?
---
Yes, several times. Other than the obnoxious fear effect he doesn't do too much damage, and is just another bullet sponge.
---
The Halloween one released was an orange smoke with bats in it
---
So, still a smoke machine, but more ‚ÄòHalloweeny‚Äô
---
Both types (black and orange) have released twice each. Can only get both if you ‚Äòbuy‚Äô their respective bundles with them inside
---
Both released within a year ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Haven‚Äôt come around often. Think the black one was November/December last time? Ages ago
---
Halloween one was obviously October and once more very very recently
---
Some really interesting ones out there. The other day i ported to a camp because it had a lot of ammo and i was feeling lazy. I get to the camp, no one else there but the owner. And he is standing in front of a large brick wall on the side of his camp. I notice he is moving and not afk. On the wall in box letters it says "stare" and he is just staring at it. Most disturbing camp i have ever been too.
---
Vampire and medics helps alot to. Especially if you become a pylon conduit.
---
don't give up, keep trying.
---
I would rather be awarded ballistic fiber than ever be awarded ammo now that I have the ammo machine
---
Frog legs is my biggest gripe.  All I watch is players with Frog legs bunny hop around and just get kills.  It seriously drives me up a wall.  It should be removed or if they want to keep it in:  
---
I think using frog legs should have a massive hit to ADS/hipfire accuracy.  Also it should increase AP drain and if you burn out AP you cannot jump until a certain point (like VATS usage).
---
Thank you for your detailed perspective.üòä
---
Well I am not much into pvp but what I do know is that explosives energy weapons was an unintended and they didn't remove them. The FRM had an unintended legendary effect and they did remove them. They can do something about it but they won't.
---
Rest in Pepperonis health regen mask. The number of steams you saved me will never be forgotten

I added it! :)

You're welcome. Take a look at this post:

---
Survival died for two reasons. The first, obvious one was that it was unpopular and ultimately a waste of resources for BGS to keep the servers up.
---
The second, unstated one is that it does not work with the dialogue systems of Wastelanders in any fair way. Do you provide invulnerability in conversations? Instanced areas are fine, but plenty of WL relies on NPCs in non-instanced areas. On-sight PVP doesn't work for what's basically a regular Fallout game, without jumping through a *lot* of hoops.
---
They're just as likely to add separate servers for Vault raids or whatever Expeditions end up being as they are to bring back survival in any way, shape, and form. At least those wouldn't be running an entire world.
---
The fo76 roadmap. These are in the works. Like you said, who knows with the covid stuff if we're going to keep within the time table. But so far it doesn't look like anything is getting pushed back.
---
The new bomb events and one applachia are set to release this summer. So within the next 2 to 3 months.
---
The remaining 3-4 months will release daily ops and expeditions. Along with the new story content.
---
I just resculpted my face a bit and I ended up even prettier without the clipping happening
---
Guts
---
Maybe they're more advanced? FO4 happens after FO76 chronologically.
---
That‚Äôs my problem
---
I did randomly get attacked by the flat woods monster the other day. I love that I keep seeing new enemies lol
---
only the Sheepsqash does that
---
maybe even light it on fire? attach that thing to a long pole and swing!!
---
Just taking a quick glance, I would switch out adamantium (spelling)skeleton for Iron clad, and your charisma I would choose lone wanderer.
---
Fireproof and adrenaline.....
---
I like it when a player‚Äôs camp is like a mini-town or made to look like an actual shop. I got my camp on the dry lake in between Summersville and New Ghad I think it‚Äôs called. One day these two guys had their camps set up on the road east of me and they were designed to look like gas stations.
---
Missile Launchers yield around 20 steel scrap with the scrapper perk card enabled. Missiles - yeah, I hate them too.
---
They should've made the eyes light up too. 3/10 for me :/

Directed by David Lynch
---
Agreed. People who play Minecraft on Creative mode love it as people who can cheat on Fallout 76 do. No problem!
---
I just try to get that .01% better legendary  eventhough I can trade for it just doesn't feel like I earned it
---
Edit: put the % in the wrong place :p
---
Someone had an ally at Scorched Earth the other day.
---
I never said it makes any sense cuz I agree with you it dosen't but what I'm saying is the games so easy why does it matter
---
You're confused with the Ultracite Laser Gun (the rifle/pistol), which does less damage with faster fire rate when compared to the Laser Gun. The Ultracite Gatling Laser straight up does more damage per hit compared to the normal Gatling Laser.
---
Oh ok
---
I'm level 366 and I got a 1* level 5 assassins shovel.
---
I was shocked.
---
Shotguns aren't that cheap. With max ammo perk you get like 27 shells per craft (been awhile since I played). It can easily take 15+ shots to kill stronger enemies. If you don't have fallout first, this leads to you always needing to farm plastic to keep up with bulking and ammo crafting. You can always buy them, but again it takes so many shots to kill enemies that really isn't feasible.
---
This was stopped after wastelanders or very soon after with the vendor glitch. Not really sure why.
---
 If you want to inspect the full name.of the weapons just press the buy button once and it'll bring up a confirm menu where you can see the full name
---
I know you can open more than one fallout application on pc (not using steam) 
---
I wonder if you could log into two different accounts....
---
You bought 10.
---
No, in fact, we talked about this on the mic, but when everyone died and respawned, it actually looked like it reset her health, not past the mutation reset, but back to 95 (or was 100 and someone dropped her quick) from like 85%. But we‚Äôre not 100% sure but we did do a double take and couldn‚Äôt remember how far we dropped her health before the nuke.
---
I was using a workshop that I claimed to farm ammunition the other day and got killed by a level over a hundred player.  I came back to claim my junk and let him know he can have the workshop and he gave me enough components to make about 10,000 rounds of the ammunition I had been making.  So that was kind of a cool interaction and I found out the hard way that some people do PVP workshops.
---
Jeez, thats a weird mechanic
---
Developers should explain stuff like this
---
What platform? (I'd love to see it; in fact I spend a lot of time visiting Camps seeking great ideas...)
---
Ya, PA is super simple, very effective, and just very easy to get.  You regularly run into half-suits out at locations you can server hop to.
---
The only regular armor it's inferior to are full sets of very good 2-3 star legendary stuff that's nowhere near as easy to acquire.
---
Do they not show up in your inventory? Additionally, it didn't ask me for a quantity to purchase. It was just cha-ching, 500 scrip.
---
I finally found him at a players camp near flat woods. The only plans on him was the cuckoo and Nuka clocks
---
I just sell what I don't need or use to in game vendors or my vending machine. After all other players may have use of it even if I don't.
---
What you could do is have your switch in a room surrounded by walls and when you want to sell stuff change one wall to a door frame turn on the vendors then change it back
---
I think it may be legacy at this point.
---

Congratulations... you have reached the end game.

Saw this camp the other day. Loved it

It's the last paint you get from turning in Tech Data so some folks get lucky and get the paints fairly frequently but I would think it's fairly rare.
---
Thank you for the PSA. Was on the fence about getting it; now I will hold off.
---
So they're useless? Guess I should've read up ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

TIL ward has abs of steel
---
It's for crafting your own legendaries with plans from Wastelanders
---
OK. I'll make you a promise. 
---
A month or 2 after the final DLC launches (probably delayed) there will be people complaining about a lack of end game content because there won't be much end game content. For the reasons I've already stated.
---
Wdym tech data?
---
I‚Äôll leave coal
---
I've just been messaging saying like "Great camp" or whatever.
---
A donation/tip box would be good though.
---
Mailboxes please
---
Maybe I'll start turning in the Tech Data, just saw that I have over 1000 of them. Not sure how I have so many, although I don't pay too much attention when spamming the pickup button.
---
Ah I get it. Thank you üëç
---
Not useless - you use them to craft legendary armor pieces and weapons, so you will likely burn through the ten you purchased when crafting Secret Service Armor pieces, rolling to get an effect grouping you like.
---
They do weigh a bit, though, so you may want to put them in your stash.
---
Plasma grenades help dealing with these. I agree about the legs I have a legendary shotgun that shoots three shots and if you aim for the legs take them out and move to their back you can destroy them
---
Best one I‚Äôve seen is someone put fuck carol baskin on the front of there home lol
---
I'll have to read up on that. Thank you for your help.
---
I found all of mine near watoga. Fast travel to the ncr tail yard. Then follow the tracks towards watoga. You‚Äôll see a train car on the rails. The Paula are inside on a box. You‚Äôll have to collect the over time. But that‚Äôs why I got them.
---
Maybe one day I'll be as lucky lol
---
Amazing
---
It was dumb luck honestly. I went there to buy ammo and saw another player interacting with him.
---
How does one do this without having a staircase connecting to the upper floor?

I think an instigating Gatling laser with 25% fire rate. I'd like executioner's or two shot with 25% faster fire rate but what are you going to do.
---
Didn't think bethesda would retcon joshua grahm into 76.
---
Unfortunately you can't turn in more than one if you've been stockpiling em. That extremely unfortunately means if you've got over 1000, all but one is useless.
---
My method of farming is getting one and immediately turning it in so when I find another I can turn it in as well.
---
I submitted a ticket and posted about it on their "support" section on their official forum. Someone else there posted about it as well so it seems to be how it is. Unreal they can't even make a loot bag sit on a surface correctly.
---
This has me thinking that this is a good case for a trap camp... hook up a secondary switch (in off position) and toggle your wires to it instead of just switching on/off. Wire it so that when switched on by a determined, lockpicky player trying to access vendors it trips rad emitters, missile launchers, and flame throwers :)
---
Based of the two choices you have Two shot. If you can ever get hold of an executioners/faster fire rate/faster reload works as well.
---
The dangling looks like Pete's legs.
---
That would be cool variety is always a plus
---
IRL, they don't need to spin up before firing at all. There's nothing about the design that's dependent on a specific speed, and you can have different fire rates on more or less the same gun between the aircraft and ground support models (aircraft guns tend to have faster fire rates because of smaller engagement windows). Also, they're mostly electrically driven these days, so they spin up near instantly anyway. 
---
The only thing games get right is spin down, since many guns let the barrel stop on its own rather than actively stopping it when the trigger is released.
---
What is a trap camp never heard of them or ran into one before
---
To quote my man Jafar, ‚ÄúI love the way your foul little mind works!‚Äù

gotta pass them int checks

More like Scorchbeast KING, look at that thang

Where is it at

Thanks for the info. Sucks that you had to suffer it, but I was very close to buying this today and was still on the fence, so I appreciate the post.
---
dicks out
---
Executioner's, 25% faster fire rate, 90% reduced weight Ultracite Gatling Laser. I've been using it for over half a year now.
---
The log cabin really made it easy to build a compound.
---
I have three log cabins and a larger house )with four separate rooms) surrounding a communal fire pit.  (Also have a seperate small building for my generator).
---
The only way to get inside the compound (minus jumping or jet pack) is through the main house.
---
I had plenty of build limit left for decorations too...and I have 6 heavy laser turrets, two water purifiers, the water mill.
---
The key was to not have any crops and smart light placement.
---
It's due to the fact that when food spoils it loses It's original tags and which are replaced with the spoiled tag. So in the case of either they are no longer labeled as meat or fruits/vegetables. I don't really see 10% hunger and 12(?)% disease chance as exploitive.
---
I placed them all in my stash. I think I can turn in one, get one from my stash, turn in. Rinse and repeat. But, I could be wrong, it's been awhile since I've turned any in (obviously).
---
nice
---
This is the 3rd time it is offered on the store afaik
---
That's massive skills
---
Probably just mapped it with the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù at the midpoint of the object image.
---
Holy shit, does that mean that it's pointless to run Squad Maneuvers with Speed Demon? All 17 of my characters run Speed Demon, and I've been sharing Squad Maneuvers thinking they added.
---
Depends on how I feel.
---
Right now I just go around doing events and visiting vendors.
---
I‚Äôve been lucky enough to jump on servers where groups were farming the queen a couple of times this week so I‚Äôd do those fights then go wandering about the nuke zone for flux and so forth.
---
I want to do the wastelanders quests but don‚Äôt feel like committing to it yet lol
---
You have to find something called [Technical Data] to start it, then you go to [Camp Venture] to turn it in. Has a rare chance at giving you a BoS paint as a reward.
---
My friend is currently using that spot haha I guess I should‚Äôve mentioned that.
---
Personally I would say it is because it's still allowing you to eat both meat and vegetables; meat when turned spoiled. But you're also getting x2 benefit of eating vegetables. So therefore it doesn't really prevent you from eating meat.
---
I have a 3* AA as well and my PipBoy tells me its 286 WITH perks. How come yours deals so much more damage? ü§î

Can you still do it?

Thanks! I‚Äôll check it out

10/10 camp
---
It happens more to expansive camps. People see a lot of things and decide they want to blow it all up.
---
Still trash

It‚Äôs in settings, at least on Xbox

Yea and let us have custom designs I want a big ass on mine
---
I just vats em lol 
---
Who needs to aim?
---
If you fast travel to Pylon V13 in the Cranberry Bog, you can head a little northwest to the outskirts of the Abandoned Bog Town and reliably find a Super Mutant Behemoth fighting some random creatures. Don't worry about the behemoth dying to the random creatures, every time I've found that encounter the behemoth wins.
---
Looks like trump
---
too much maintenance. put vending power switch in a room with a key code powered door lock and vending machines with in garage door. all connected to secure power switch
---
Yeah, no point to it if everyone is running speed demon.
---
I still just toss them in. Someone will buy eventually and if I ever need some I can just grab it.
---
Well, TIL! Thanks very much for this.
---
She made it to CHOP
---
Very clever. So much of what can be done with Camp is all about forming an illusion
---
I have a routine for the first part of my time spent playing. First I hit the raider camps starting at the munitions dump then SWestwardly until the Rollins Labor camp then I sell my new gear. Next I get off the private server and server jump/shop for plans I dont really know why I just like finding them. Then I just free roam around and I really need to just let the wasteland take me in sometime though like NV used to and just go with the flow and see where I end up.
---
What does it mean to dupe plans? How is that possible?
---
Just quit the game it's never too late
---
It‚Äôs the difference between killing the SBQ in ten seconds and eight, that‚Äôs why it matters
---
Just delete wires?
---
I don't think you can but I wish you the best with it, maybe you get lucky! I find it really unfortunate you can't hoard them and turn them all in at once in some way.
---
First mod I looked for when I opened fo76 and started playing. Sadly disappointed mind you :(
---
Yes bring it back !
---
I don't get it.
---
Np! Nuking is still great, there are lots of good rewards on top of the legendary from the queen, the mobs can spawn as legendary too, so keep them flying!
---
Ur joking right? U cant tank legacies?! Holy shit they do no damage to me. a freaking super mutant could kill me faster
---
Console players: crying
---
PC gamers: moded gun go brrrrr
---
I play solo for the most part. I dont have friends. Lmao
---
However, i LOVE focusing on my camp build. Just recently started investing into camp plans now that i finally got my vendor back up and running. I try to do as many quests as i can in one play through because of work. Still trying to find a good character build right now.  One thing i cant stand is the server lag.. makes me very very sad most times. Sometimes i can barely place a camp object or loot an enemy because the server hasnt caught up.. im not the only one that has this issue am i?
---
BUT, i still love this game and look forward to the next updates.
---
Chi chi chi chi ma ma ma ma
---
Todd was duping the plans for his mules.
---
Good luck finding the corpse xD
---
That can work too well depending on the build
---
FWIW, they are that loud (and annoying) IRL, too :)
---
But they are nothing compared to tree frogs.....
---
You lost me at ‚ÄúI figured why not‚Äù.
---
Sorry you had to learn this way. Now you won‚Äôt go ‚Äúfiguring‚Äù anymore!
---
Stim pks
---
Afaik you can buy the plans from the Free States vendor in Harpers Ferry and at the Whitesprings
---
Glad I am not the only one. Maybe it is just a normal noise that our vigilant brain interprets as a whisper. Or maybe it is the ever chatty scorched.
---
Next time just ‚Äúblock for session‚Äù much easier
---
Because most fallout fans think PA is better, since it was the top armor in the previous games.  
---
It also makes you  quite more tanky, but it definitely is not worth running around in PA, there are tons of better builds without it.  
---
There are also some events that are tougher than other like SBQ that many people jump in PA so they die less.
---
Did u die, &amp; respawn¬ø
---
They could tie it into the Personal Console already available that ends up becoming just for show after you complete the quests inside it.
---
One of the options could be: Donate caps.
---
I think they will think of this is aiding folks who have mule accounts, so won‚Äôt likely happen.
---
I checked like three times, so I really really hope this is a case of me being dim haha
---
I got the 1st 3 paints my first 3 turnins....and haven‚Äôt seen paint since....150+ levels ago....
---
Every time I got Kellogg's Revolver in FO4 I always renamed it "The Jackal", waiting for the bull barrel to come out on 76 so I can put it on my Bloodied Explosive .44 revolver and name it the same thing. (A little nod to the Hellsing Ultimate pistol the 13mm Combat Pistol, "The Jackal")
---
because if you don't look too closely they're generic hero types with probably the closest idealogy to our own out of any factions
---
I know they are, but gunshots and grenades are much louder in real life too. Doesn't mean we need to get tinnitus every time a team mate shoots right next to us :/
---
Based on Bethesda's rep in the past if this was popular enough they'd add it.
---
It would take a whopping 15 minutes to set up...depending on how many times the Creation Kit crashed of course.

I vote Nuka Ranch to be the end game dressing.
---
Not a bad idea, I like her crazyness. 
---
By the way, if you like her, you‚Äôll also like Fuzzy Brenda, the settler that thinks she is an employee at Camdem Park: she is played by the same voice actress and is a kind of crazy too haha.
---
Yeah I'm amazed by some of these bases that I run into.
---
On an Xbox server.
---
That is amusing!
---
What does the text say
---
Yes, when I was level five a level 100 gave me about 20 stimpaks. That was a long time ago but I'll always cherish the memory.
---
Bring back the 12.7mm smg!
---
[*The usual, sir?*](https://youtu.be/Zjf5pdJJ44Q)
---
Yeah thats what I should have done. Next time I'll just do that. I can see trying to fight, if that's how you like to play, but trashing my camp after I'm waking away? That's just crappy.
---
What's the pts for? lol
---
You lost me with what you are trying to say here.
---
Dont let it donate between multiple accounts?
---
Or make it so you have to be on the same server and the donatee?
---
Or make it a mailbox as someone suggested above.
---
You know, if you‚Äôre gonna get a wanted tag. Might as well really go for it!
---
No worries. The bar is under floor decorations by the way.
---
‚ÄúNever team with randoms‚Äù.
---
Not sure if you are serious or being facetious ;)
---
They are a way for players to trap and kill others while circumventing PvP restrictions to nab the loot bags of junk left behind upon death. When Survival Mode was a thing, they were particularly dangerous (though more rare), as you would drop aid items as well.
---
Trap camps are done in ways that are either annoying and deserving of ire or creative and ought to be given kudos. The former is for lazy, uninspired camps that may target low level players. The latter can have sly hidden mechanisms or sometimes fun visuals or mechanics. 
---
These camps are set up to suddenly ensnare a player, requiring them to lock pick their way out (earning them a wanted status and opening them up to full damage from PvP and turrets) or quickly die from hidden trap elements, like gamma emitters behind walls or under floors. Any decently constructed trap needs to kill the player quickly enough that they can‚Äôt fast travel to safety and be quickly reset by the camp owner so they can claim the dropped junk before the victim returns. 
---
I dislike some of the more boorish ones, but some really do call for accolades. Some of the traps I‚Äôve seen involve hidden springboards that can launch players out over a cliff or into a reliable enemy spawn point. There‚Äôs one nice camp location that is particularly devious in that it is a place where you can set up a lead extractor with a particular orientation that blocks it off except for one direction that allows for a springboard right into a fissure site. Same location allows for a vendor trap that can induce natural low acid damage while calling in a scorchbeast mob and trapping the player in a corner. These can be done in a humorous or creative manner where I don‚Äôt mind if I drop some materials I forgot to stash before investigating someone‚Äôs camp :)
---
Search the military wing of the Enclave bunker, there should be at least one in all of those desks
---
Excuse you, they are called *cryptids*.
---
And to top it off he connected it up with a digital optical cable instead of coaxial
---
Thanks dude
---
TFW the entire squad unloads on you
---
And they want to introduce legendary perks system that's even worse than existing one...
---
It wasn't one of them messing with me. It was some one else. They were fine, this was after we called it quits as a team.
---
I find the event must go the same length every time.
---
I think the heart needs to open and close 3-4 times for the event to correctly finish.
---
The LMG has one mod...FYI.
---
Why not raider punk instead he reminds me of that survivalist dude from 2012 think the characters name was Charlie Frost
---
I think there might be some confusion in the quest step you're referring to.. To clarify, the OP is referring to the first step "Search Hornwright Industrial HQ," for which you need the Executive ID. The person in the video you link is on the step "Get an access keycard for the safe room gate" which is a different issue, although it's a (later) part of the same questline.
---
Ghoul Slayer's Pipe Wrench

Run around, repair, fight, and at the end her boss is a giant robotic Mr. Fuzzy that erupts from the center of the roller coaster and turns into a massive boss fight.
---
It has a roughly 45-60 minute cooldown, chances are you have just been trying to do it on servers where it has already been started and is on cooldown, when this happens to me I usually just server hop until I am able to start it.   
---
I am on PC though, so I guess there may be an issue with it on the PS4 that I'm not aware of.
---
someone else must of started it earlier, it has a 1hour cooldown i think between each start.
---
Kill Queens. Easy-peasy
---
The bed with the mothman picture on the sheets and the billboard isnt included in that bundle. Youd need to buy them separately
---
If you're doing it on a private server it won't reset until you do it on a public server, I waited days when it came out cuz of that lol
---
Oh okay. Must have been unlucky then. 
---
Funny thing is I‚Äôm all alone in a private server though. 
---
But I‚Äôll keep trying then. Thanks
---
Caption that pic "I showed you my cloaca, please respond"
---
I am on a private! Lol okay makes sense now. Thanks!
---
Not at first, but after yes. Then I made sure to lower my health until nerd rage proced again
---
Hmm, I checked a site specifically to check that, I guess the editors were wrong.
---
Ah okay thanks! I‚Äôll keep trying then. 
---
Must have been real unlucky

The entire park would have to be monster mash style....no pvp deaths and you race against each other in park events say 4v4
---
or if the server could handle it 4 teams of 4 all selected by when you joined
---
I could see a tadpole style badge run around the entire coaster like left for dead.
---
Compete against each other in collecting tokens from games etc.
---
Ray Dolby: First attempt at 5.1 surround 
---
Yup explosive 10mm with leg shots
---
Let people donate whatever they want to whatever account (mule, etc. doesn't matter) ... Let people be free and have fun... It's a game... ;-)
---
No problem, yeah basically hop between private and public and it'll keep resetting :)
---
It's a 5.1 surround sound system... without a subwoofer. Kind of.
---
Who wants that?
---
If shit went wrong I wouldn't want to emulate the society that made it that way 
---
Start everything from scratch good and proper
---
I definitely have regrets.
---
Yeah, it only has the prime receiver mod.
---
Yeah. There's a lot of potential for the personal console
---
Wtf
---
If you die, your stats will reset to what they should be.
---
And when you lower your health after dying back to 20% your unyielding buffs will +3 to what your stats were over 20% health.
---
you'll hit some sort of brickwall and end up with 1000 hours and somehow only level 225 or something
---
I guess we're in the same boat, I won't know if Bethesda added any new mods for the weps since release, I'm hoping they didn't just transfer ones form Fallout 4 without adding anything new.
---
Indeed. I hate both the Raiders and the Settlers.
---
you lost me at..
---
&gt; I finally break down and fight them
---
sorry you had to learn this way..
---
Ey neat! Thanks for the tip.
---
Anything. I'd even accept the Scorched Beast poo because there's "something" in it LOL
---
Vamps Puncturing pole hook represent! Drops hordes of glowing ones hard! Not nearly as fast as my VCK40Swing or my VCB or one of my several other Vamps but it was my first vamps and very near and dear to my heart
---
Its a bait man, the entire reason they troll you into engaging in the first place is so they can trash your base.
---
people who are unable to comprehend that life in a post apocalyptic wasteland requires a different kind of morality and as such paint the legion, the brotherhood, the enclave, the institute, etc as blandly evil
---
It needs at least a skin.:..
---
The submachine gun as displayed here, https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/3/32/FO76_Submachine_gun.png/revision/latest?cb=20200313005432, would be classified as a pistol in the US. Because it has a brace and not a stock (see how much smaller it is compared to the Handmade's stock). Also, since it doesn't have a vertical fore-grip, it can be legally classified as a pistol.

---
The only downside is the cores needed, but I carry it around for situational use, if I need to use it longer just perk up the battery perk.
---
All you ever need is a reclining skeleton and glasses
---
Alright, thank you!
---
Guess I'll get the Mothman bag sooner, thanks! :D
---
The only issue I have with the powered doors is they can‚Äôt be wallpapered. And in the case of the brick walls, the keypad is on the wrong side.
---
yeah I know, I'm just saying he literally does have plans for a full set of ultracite
---
Good advice! Only just started adding weapons to my favourites for easier access, will keep this in mind, cheers!
---
Well, you‚Äôre not wrong.
---
There are videos out that show another way. Just stack items and move the bottom item to a place where it sinks into a ground. Ever time you place the lower item into the ground the top item sink a little into it. So keep going til you're happy.
---
Yeah. I keep stacking wooden shelves
---
It's just an armor, no need for the dramatics over it. Its personal choice anyways. I just use it cause my normal armor isnt that good (I'm level 69) and I have a heavy weapons build, so I'm meant to be the tank. Waiting until I get into vault 79 cause I heard they have good armor in there, then I'll consider not using PA.
---
rose gives you a full set of level 25 raider pa if you just wanna rush that
---
Not crashing but was running terribly for me before. Locations taking forever to pop up, thought foundation had packed up and fucked off. Quest markers not working. Weird glitchy tears in the background distance.
---
Just keeps saying server connection interrupted.returning to main menu
---
Even Gauss endgame weapons have several mods
---
I'd be happy with just a skin. It's already ridiculously OP.
---
1. Walk up to a door so your character is about an inch away.
---
2. Enter photo-mode and position the camera behind your character's head facing the door
---
3. Set the camera so it is as level as you can get it.
---
4. Move the camera to about where you characters nose would be but still looking at the door
---
5. Hit tab to exit photo-mode and literally just walk forward through the doorway.
---
Yeah this is how I had to grind it, its great though, easily soloable event, good cap reward if you find all 4 of the missing packages and it has some plans and apparel that seem to sell well. Its honestly one of my favourite things to do in Fallout 76 at the moment. Wish there were more events like it.
---
I know....BGS has missed obvious ways to make us spend atoms.
---
Is it bad that I want to see one in action now and maybe try one myself just to mess with some friends
---
Yea that what it was doing to me yesterday
---
I‚Äôve solo‚Äôd it multiple times in a hazmat suit while over encumbered lol.
---
Lol, this is the reason I chose Astro girl over guitar girl....
---
This just happened to me and I found an NPC stuck in the cave. Do what you can to make them move from the layer they‚Äôre caught up in. *Phase* them in any way you can.
---
right, it bothered me too. my solution was to put a regular door frame in front of the powered door to hide it
---
What is this, a random encounter or something? I need more details, I didn't know there were ways to get settler rep other than the random encounters where you defend settlers and wards daily/photo opportunity.
---
7.1 that good? Thinking about going to 7.1 but not a lot of actual 7 channel content out there.. P.s. these moments are the exact reason hate fast traveling!
---
I've heard, it stopped me from getting it. If they patch it before a cooler one gets added then I'll buy it, I'd like a loot bag skin as the paper bag is hard to see sometimes
---
Yeah I found that out the hard way. Still a crappy thing to do though.
---
Just found out you can only buy gold from Smiley on Saturday or Sunday.
---
I was thinking maybe the scorched. But I swear I‚Äôll lose it if it is something like ‚ÄúJesus is love‚Äù lol
---
Too bad it doesn't hit anything in vats. Got excited to get a junkies gauss rifle, spent loads of materials getting the mods for it, then realised I couldn't hit a thing with it.
---
You probably don't have a legacy.  A VE laser rifle lets me keep up with radiation rumble as long as I have time to repair and don't run out of rounds.
---
I sell them for 15 caps. Gotta work on deflating the supposed worth of cosmetics like outfits and masks and just make ‚Äòem obtainable by people who want to wear them, rather than trade them.
---
Just play on pc
---
I had to turn in around 400 tech docs to get all the paint jobs (Elder being the last one, as others have said)
---
it has a skin, the raider golden skin in the atomic shop
---
I like your thinking
---
I don't think the question here is in making it op or not, I just want to customize my favorite weapon to my liking :(
---
Pocketed raider chest is bugged and gives more carry weight than it should.
---
I feel the same, I also like that it's got a guaranteed 3* captain, and a decent chance to spawn more legendary enemies
---
I like the public events randomly popping up and stuff but I wish they did that and we had the option to trigger them if we want to do a specific one
---
AWOL Armaments is another good one that's overlooked a lot, but it's not public so it's partly luck whether you spot it or not
---
It has a guaranteed 3* as well and I usually get one or two other legendaries during the event
---
Agreed. She‚Äôs terrible. Always took my headset off so I didn‚Äôt have to hear that voice. I had hoped I could shoot her.
---
&gt;Attempting to hack a terminal can put your game into a "server not responding" state.
---
I have a sinking suspicion that this may be on purpose.  It's way too easy to solve a console by just brute force guessing and popping in and out to reset, the only time I run into this has been when trying to immediately reactivate a console after exiting.
---
&gt; Edit: Frog legs should be removed from the game as it's too op! 
---
Frog Legs is a gimmick,  the sooner you realize you're better off slotting in something else the better.
---
Just keep calm and get gud
---
That wasn‚Äôt always the case, when I was a sneaky rifleman I used to clear out the west tek building with vats headshots. Those were fun times.
---
Auto Tesla that doesn't match your build works wonders for tagging.
---
Yeah next time I'll block and ignore them. Just getting shot in the back of my head a hundred times while I'm loading up my vending machine made me frustrated.
---
What happened? Haven't been playing too long. Nerfed or broken?
---
On the river on the way up to Point Pleasant? Yeah that's fricken deafening.
---
Well u should have tanked it then
---
