I’d say half the time I spawn into my camp my missile turrets do not work. I’ll have a group of 3, lvl 68 super mutants firing away and it just scans left n right without ever firing.
---
---
---
I  send people a message if I see they got a bunch and offer 1 cap per 4 rounds gotten alot that way
---
No, I don’t. He’s an overly biased opportunist pandering for clicks, and even his ‘followup that reported the fix’ still insinuated a lot of unfounded negative claims.  Yellow journalism at its ‘finest’. 
---

---
Try watching it again, this time without your star-struck fanboy glasses on.
---
Got it.
---
Can you please upload an image?
---
But am open to ideas if anyone can think of any
---
 Go get a Scorchbeast if you are offended. That's an appropriate response. ;)
---
From my experience, medium gifts can have two plans, and large gifts can actually have three, but this is extremely rare. I've only seen it a few times in the many many gifts I've opened.
---
Really they work when the blueprint doesnt contain a glitched item. However, there are so many ways to glitch an object in a place that the game wont normally allow that it causes blueprints to fail. Some of these ways arent even really "glitches" but build order things. Like placing certain walls or roof pieces before others. This can cause the game to render the blueprint invalid. Point is, blueprints work if kept insanely simple.
---
It was like that for my main character, but the next 3 characters got their shit together earlier and earlier.
---
Yup, that's RNG for you. I got the plasma grenade plan twice in about 30 minutes, and haven't seen it since.
---
Damn hoped I’d just missed over it or something
---
lvl 200+ means you're an elite player whether you want it or not
---
LOL Yup. I do this heh
---
too bad i couldn't buy it from you, i use .32 ammo on my zealots pipe pistol, it is good vs scorched ghouls waves
---
As a joke about a month ago I sent my wife a link to the Mothman Funko POP because I knew she’d make a face and tell me it was gross or something. What I only just learned is that she absolutely remembered me telling her about the Path to Enlightenment quest and the lighthouse in the mountains, so she left work for lunch and went right to Gamestop to snag the last one they had.
---
I’m not entirely convinced that my four year old knew why he was giving me a funny black bug toy, but he was very excited to do so and he could tell I was thrilled.
---
She knows that if we ever have enough money to make our way up the coast, we have to stop and let Daddy take a picture with my little buddy in front of that amazing statue in West Virginia.
---
Lead still gives scrap with the extractor, not ore (unless you pull it by hand)
---
If someone gives you a nuka-shine drink it, it gives you a free fast travel
---
Xbox. This is on the pip-boy?
---
Bullshit. Every engine can be hacked. Its just code. Every major multiplayer game has hacks.
---
Lol this is what I do half of my punch bowl is always Nukashine the other is random drinks and every time I check to see who won or who lost the drinking lotto
---
Nay, its on your favorites wheel.  Up on the Dpad, just like you would to swap a weapon.\]
---
Then press Y to drop the camp.
---
Nah. He presents a biased point of view to cater to the lowest common denominator. Even though there are grains of truth mixed in, there’s far too much salt in there as well.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Another triumph!
---
I mean, I’m leaving you bitters behind yo go have fun. I’d say so
---
ok
---
sorry but you cant compare WoW with Failout shit6. First Blizzard have a 24/7 support ingame and outgame team that can help you, Bethesda dont if you have a issue you cant only write a mail.
---
And second WoW can track everything you character and alts have on the month, they can track every item you sell or destroy that way you can refund items. 
---
Bugthesda have 0 systems like this, and since they keep using a engien and code no desing for multilplayer i doubt they cant track anything.
---
Whatever point you stop opening card packs and picking new perks when you level up. Just let me swap in ammosmith and super duper quickly damn it!
---
EA in a nutshell lol
---
Hard to tell as this was pretty much the time I changed out my two shot explosive handmade for a furious explosive.
---
I still hold out hope it has some tiny drop chance from tipsy taste test but i know thats never guna happen. Some people claim to have seen it at a camp but no one has ever prooved that
---
Lol. Seriously, two threads... You walked into an obvious trap man.  They aren't invisible, look at where you are going.  It's not greifing, you willingly walked into something.  Someone gave you a lesson you could learn from and you are mad about it.  I'm not a raider in the least either and would most likely help you out if I came across you even if it ends up getting me killed, which has happened to me before. It's just a game my dude.
---
Robco also uses Vault Tec's OS for the Personal Information Processor hence the reason Vault boy is all the way through the the screens. Hardware pipboy software vaultboy
---
Yeah, I was thinking it'd just be nice if it worked like the workshop one. I don't really care to FT into someones trap base lul
---
Morgantown airport, highschool, Back on the Beat when its up
---
Wavy Willards is a great spot for lots of low level scorched
---
Nah fuck the BoS we have nothing to do with those greedy cucks.
---
another great way to cap farm is to cook alot of northman eggs you find in point pleasant. you will be surprised of the amount of caps you can rack up. also water farming in private world from workshop can get you thousands of cap per hour
---
It's a pity they didn't leave the Screensaver on in 76. It was always fun to watch that pop up
---
Except I was playing all day farming packages and there was a 5 hour window where it literally wasn't giving packages.  12-5 EST
---
A few weeks ago I was hunting for Sheepsquatch in the Mire and found 3 Mothman.
---
If you're looking for ideal flux areas, check out Mappalachia. I don't have a link to the post with it though.
---
I don't think I'd like to come across a Supermutant using a Mutant's Explosive Minigun.
---
None of these answers are satisfying. If the client determines which weapon is used, then the client can also put that weapon in the loot. Not knowing a plan doesn't affect which weapon you get, since (1) I've gotten weapons I didn't have plans for, and (2) you get weapons at the beginning of the game, even though you don't know any plans. And what is wrong with everyone who tagged the enemy getting the same weapon?
---
Poseidon energy plant has quite a bit of scorched. You can take some workshops in the forest, as well, and build a semi-fortified area for a Santatron and loot gifts from that. Bonus would be the occasional retake event with scorched enemies.
---
Save a few caps for a 1* unyielding set. Pieces are usually 800&gt; on PS4. Rank 2 hard bargain and unyielding set is usually enough to get max caps/discount
---
Last night while I was going to sleep, the curtains parted and the Mothman flew into my room.  Let's just say I was driven to the heights of ecstasy.
---
It's more than just using aid items, it's called the "aid bug" because you use it 99.9% of the time over other categories so people believe it's with aid items.  I fixed or rather permanently avoided the bug earlier this week and have opened well over 1k gifts since with no problems.  I just finished opening over 300 like 10mins and still haven't had a crashed, taking a break to watch Lost in Space season 2.
---
This is exaclty why we dont have them. Dont quote me on it but im pretty sure they were in the beta and learned that its a terrible idea.
---
It isn't on the drop list for Tipsy or any other Quest sadly. The Plan can be obtained through questionable means but it can't be learned
---
I want my FO 1st subscription money back for this month as I haven't been able to play the game due to fears of my stuff being ripped from me. I'm not playing again until it's been 100% confirmed that players inventories are secure and that an anti cheat system is in place.
---
I dont have any stats to go off of but that sounds about right to me. The smalls are mainly good for gun plans and common mounts.
---
Those two heads aren't part of this event.
---
OP gave an example where a news site couldn't differentiate scorched from scorchbeasts.
---
That's actually not totally accurate either. If you are below a certain level the pool of plans you can receive is much smaller and so your chance to get plans like the plasma grenade are much higher. I have a freind who farmed 30 plasma grenade plans in a day. We are getting off topic though. The point is that mothman plans are objectively rare regardless of other plans drop rate. Just because there is something that drops even less doesnt make this specific plan not rare.
---
Not yet, but if I find one, I'll keep you in mind.
---
Maybe it is lorespade, or just a brilliant troll.  Super mutants killed me one time, maybe Bethesda needs to address that problem as well.  
---
You might be lorespade too.. trying to promote his channel. I need my tinfoil hat now.
---
I have that (w DRWR) as well. So much power and so much fun.
---
it is too late for them, they have been brainwashed into loving bugthesda. 
---
&gt;few players
---
Who are they trying to bullshit with that? We have a video of 1 person who is going around stealing inventory, do none of you guys realised that this is just the damage from 1 person, there are so many unconfirmed reports, so we will never know the true extent of this hack?
---
I'll bet you 30k that there is never a hack on console for FO76. Nothing is immune to being hacked but if it's so hard to hack that it isnt worth the effort people dont do it.
---
&gt; Because I still obviously follow this reddit   
---
&gt;  
---
 And it wouldn’t matter if I had never played the game in my life, lies  can be exposed by anyone that takes the time to do research, or even has  **the brains to not use Reddit as a source for a story** 
---
Oh brilliant!   
---
So when you accuse others of lying, it's because they rely on Reddit. Which really means that reddit is lying. Which is where you are now, posting about the game.  
---
And when it comes to rationalizing why you understand the game better than they do, it's because you *rely on reddit*.  
---
It's amazing that you blame people for the crime of not assuming Reddit is utter bullshit, while also propping yourself up as someone who owes your expertise to reddit.  
---
The mental ninjutsu involved is impressive, I'll give you that.
---
Having a game type with more severe survival elements and/or less loot would be great, since this game is insanely easy. Once you're past level 100, you're almost a god here. But then again, I like being a god :-)
---
probably the same few people gilding the post.
---
Just buy the flux. I can make them for you for free if you supply me the materials.
---
Check out the Grafton vendor, they should be at Grafton or Camden for around $5600, but you still going to need the materials ... I think the main materials is 10 violet flux if I remember and some adhesive, I can support the rest ..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also the red rocket stop in the mire just south of harpers ferry, has a PA station at the back, I found some calibrated mods at the back, but it's rng, so you going to probably have to hop a lot.
---
Dude, I’m just sharing the info I have. And that list has a minimum level column all the way to the right.
---
Does it come action packed with punch off-able head?
---
I think you mean worst.
---
What platform? I'm on ps4.....
---
Yay now we can pay for it!
---
I thought I had seen it in a recent datamine of photos. Should be coming soon.
---
How can you tell that? They're both named identically - that would completely make sense- but there's not any designation I can see on them.
---
I am level 380 and consider myself an average non exploit user. I consider anything over 150 high level. you are pretty much topped out and geared out by that point. but like prl867 I only use the one guy . all of my alts are under level 20. they have hard bargain equipped and when the vendors reset daily I sell serums to the vendor to make daily cap really fast. I do intend to start leveling my alts just to pump up their charisma though. one day.....
---
It doesn't say but you can tell by the weight and when you equip them they look different
---

---
I’ve gained so much nuka from these gift boxes it makes me not seem like an alcoholic all of a sudden.
---
I’m now skeptical to try the punch bowl.
---
Another pivot lul.  Each point you bring up isn’t even in defense of the journalist not being disingenuous.  You just keep trying to disprove my credentials and smear me personally for some reason. 
---
What are you trying to accomplish here bud? The OP already laid out in great detail how the writer of this article muffed the punt. You lost that debate.
---
I'm a Fallout 1st subscriber, and I would be against this. It would allow easier access to hard to find resources. Yes, you can store unlimited resources, and you can farm in a private world, but having a nuke zone without the work seems... wrong.
---
Name says it.
---
[removed]
---
Okay, that could be it then. There's a slight difference in the weights.
---
ohh sorry was super confused
---
I really wish you could take a second serum to "cure" you of that mutation. so if you had 4 or 5 mutations and picked up one you didn't want you could selectively remove it.
---
Well no shit every engine CAN be hacked. It's a matter of how easy it is and how much can be done. But not every engine is an open book like Bethesda's. This game is built on a framework that is designed to allow anyone to modify it, in massive ways. And the changes made to allow multiplayer are half-assed. So this is still a single player game, made for mods, with zero measures taken to anti-hack/cheat.
---
What exactly are you comparing this to? I can't argue against "all other games" where you can simply mix and match the perfect combination of general flaws to justify this game's mess by comparison.
---
I’m saying those things to make a point. You can hate all you like, but fans of the game will be too busy having fun playing it to give a shit.
---
Same here. But say it would be funny as hell if you could put it on a buddy's camp every time you load in and fuck it up.
---
Except you're literally disproving yourself, by repeatedly coming back here. And this entire thread disproves it as well. A thousand upvotes says you're wrong. You wouldn't be here if you were right. We wouldn't be having this conversation if that were true.
---
Another spot is the savage divide. What platform?
---
PC. I should have probably stated that in the posting. :(
---
That just sounds like big bend tunnel but with extra steps.
---
How do you know? Is there a list somewhere?
---
 "Do you think it is trolling and should people be banned for it?" yes
---
Are you thinking of a “glowing sea” like area as in FO4?
---
My guy wears a complete set of Heavy metal armor. The only way I can tell what’s sturdy and what’s heavy is to stand back a take a look at yourself
---
True actually lol
---
Aw. Now while I *can't* say that the lovely punch bowl does not have the ever-delightful Nukashine in it, I *can* say that **it also has some other, less blackout inducing beverages to sample**, and that your chances of sampling another beverage are better than sampling Nukashine.  :D
---
Also I just noticed you rearranged my words and presented them as a quote to better represent your point.  So do you not know how quoting works in the English language or are you liar?
---
AAE sorry
---
Sorry not the greatest photo but here you go

Yeah maybe go to actual news/business sites if you want real news on games.  
---
The game is broken btw.
---
What exactly am I “claiming” in your eyes? And hahahaha, what the fuck? 
---
&gt;A thousand upvotes says you’re wrong

Hey Doofus Rick, this isn’t a popularity contest. Upvotes and downvotes don’t prove shit on who is right and who is wrong. See r/liberal and r/conservative if you can’t comprehend that. 
---
I’m replying because I need angry tears to brew my coffee tomorrow morning. Like sheesh, I said it once I’ll say it again: how the fuck are any of you going to handle *real* adversity in your lives?
---
They’re the incarnation of hate, salt, and angst. People really need to chill
---
🤗 u/CrazyOO1
---
Thank you
---
Frognak should be a new cryptid.
---
NP just helping out.
---
Just like that saying (from bambi lmao) but with facts and sources instead. If you ain’t got credible sources, don’t post anything at all.
---
The scorched breast heads and the mirlurk queen claw aren't part of the event.
---
Good call!
---
Pointing out that your entire stance here is one of hypocrisy and double standards. That you yourself don't meet the requirements of those you mock and dismiss.
---
You admitted you don't play the game! Which, is the driving accusation behind every dismissal of Youtubers and journalists criticizing this game! According to all the other fans of this game, you have no right to talk about it. You no less reliable than any of the Youtubers you deride.
---
And we at last arrive to the final stage of the low effort deflections. I have fanboy BINGO! "Why are you here?"
---
My point is the OP is a hypocrite. You all don't care actually about bullshit. YOU lost this argument. Your appeal from authority is a last ditch effort to safe face, even if you need to use someone else to do it. But it won't work on me.
---
Xb1
---
Enclave in fallout 3 lol and nv , they were chill and i was a smart kid and turned off parental controls
---
It just occurred to me, this is on pc. There was a hack a few weeks back where they were crafting legendary items with whatever effects they want for anything, even make 5 star items. How do I know this isn't a hacked item?
---
Very unfair
---
I didnt start counting right away but I am up too 113 legendaries destroyed lol. using th 5mm hand crank gatling gun and nuka grenades. punching right through silos and queen fights with ease all in vanilla gear and still making profit selling the serums on private server for the nuka bot to "destroy" no vendors up and my base is a 4 foundation size box with all the crafting stuff I need plus 1- turrets. easy to drop and move anywhere I wish. whole new playstyle. its nice not fussinf with a lgendaries vendor for a change.
---
Buddy answer my other post, do you not know how quotes work or are you a liar? 
---
You can pivot to the other stuff once you answer that.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eeax74/is_there_anything_that_tells_what_the_rarer_plans/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I don’t tbh, it’s “god roll” so I’m just gonna say it’s a hacked item
---
oh also the wife started playing again. she thinks I am nuts.
---
I think its intended that way so that you have less to load. Still if you turn around often enough the camp isn't fully loaded in.
---
Sure that would be great! I have tons of mount plans (not rare) and some prime weapon mod plans.
---
Also have flux, serums and caps.
---
GT: pwnguin  I'm in the US west coast so I'll try to get on in the morning. Cheers!
---
I've noticed that too. But it doesn't always happen. It's probably not on purpose.
---
I have a set of metal gear with the pink paint and it drives me crazy that one arm is heavy? With the spiked shoulder bit and the other is light without. Been searching for the right piece to replace it.
---
Just leave. You don't have an argument to make. Go enjoy the game like you claimed you were doing. Stop trying to get that last little lame insult in. How do YOU deal with real adversity? You sound like an absolute child now. You need my tears to brew your coffee? This is how you deal with trivial issues? Are you serious?
---
The worst thing about you fanboys is, you hold everyone else to some lofty standard you are utterly incapable of maintaining yourselves.
---
Go. No one needs a third encore of this shitshow of yours.
---
A couple weeks ago there the mods had to pin a post reiterating how calls for violence/death threats are against the subs rules, you know it’s become a garbage place when that has to be explicitly stated
---
I hate hackers.  oof, here I'm hoping I'm wrong
---
nope mine is a small 4 foundation box with a basic set of crafting stations and 10 turrets. I move that thing anywhere on the map I need it but often I cant use it at queen fights because of all the survival tents /shrug which is ok too, I mostly deploy it when the queen fight is starting and only a few people show up.
---
I posted this idea before thanksgiving. It didn't make much traction. I don't get a lot of upvotes.
---
TIL this is a thing after playing for 10 months. Whole time, I've been under the impression you could alter your armor to be sturdy, heavy, light.
---
By "rearrange" you mean I quoted the parts relevant to my response. I was going to use two separate quotes but the formatting kept getting messed up.
---
By English language, you mean 'on reddit'? Because as far as I know quoting is pretty much the same process regardless of language. Now who's pivoting?
---
Just leave man, this is sad.
---
Well you’re getting a third encore. Ever heard of me taking a break from a game to reply? 
---
I deal with adversity by smoking weed. You seem to do so by getting angry at internet strangers. Yes, as a matter of fact I do need your tears. I’ll mail you my mug. Please fill it with your tears of rage and return it. 
---
Also nice projection with that second paragraph. What “lofty standard” am I trying to hold you to?
---
lol no, his stupid laugh is nothing to promote but I get u, and after watching vids like his I kinda get what these end-game players are doing.  “Players are the npcs” sort of thing, they provide content in a way.
---
this monkey is also very good in call of duty nazi zombies
---
My psn is brandnewzo. I just got into playing again and am on a lot
---
Not gonna lie, I got this game on the E3 Free Week because I was curious to see if it really sucked as badly as the press said, I saw with my own eyes it indeed sucked a lot and bought the game and here I am with 700 clocked hours on the game and still counting. And still thinking this is the buggiest game I've played since Driv3r. Lot of mixed feelings about this game, but it has been a good time and that's more important...
---
Not just you. I’ve been having issues too, as well as a friend of mine. Both of us running bloodied with unyielding/bolstering armor. Have seen a fair few people complaining of this, and no one can really pinpoint WHAT the issue is. I’ve looked at my perks, my armor, my weapons... 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Because you get tokens from daily quests only
---
That sounds perfect Thankyou  what would I take 4 it 🙂
---
Add the Super Duper perk too for a chance to double what you craft 🤗
---
The handle is crafted from a hardened tongue of a radtoad and it shoots egg bombs when you swing!
---
I learned them just as people here have already suggested. Only jumping in to say that some of the plans have to be purchased. Mostly scopes, if I remember correctly. Think I got them from the Harper's Ferry vendor.
---
Whitesprings if you don't mind getting nuked now and then.  The dry lakebed near new gad is also decently flat.
---
They use to all be scrap, then they made some ore for some reason. Acid, oil, lead, and junk, are scrap. Not sure on the rest.
---
If you want lots of ore, do Breach and Clear in the ash heap.
---
Ah well. Power to you.
---
Things with the same blight?  And OP's main issue was with what I said, not semantics against mobs
---
It's unfortunate your experience was broken. But looking at your history I can see I'm just gonna get butthurt comments and sad replies from another internet curmudgeon so... mute. xD
---
Didn't know that quest. Thanks for sharing.
---
I suppose they get rid of it because the rest of the vaults aren't in the game.
---
Does your friend collect anything like outfits? I have hundreds of plans on a mule but it’s hard not knowing what they need.
---
No he’s no interest in outfits but thanks
---
is it me or is it extremely hard to find legendary scorched now.  did big bend and glassed caverns, and got one legendary from the bunch
---
Thank you! I get so sick of fast traveling to a vendor's camp and ending up at the base of a cliff or in the foundation. I logged on yesterday and at the first vendor I visited I couldn't find the vending machines for the camp (why make them hard to find if you want to sell stuff?), and then on the second vendor the prices were sky high (no one will pay 6000+ caps for a two star weapon!) I was so discouraged I logged off and have not been back on the game since. Sometimes, just playing the buggy game with buggy players is just not worth it.
---
I got a 2 shot reduced weight harpoon gun, and I forget what the 3rd part is. But it wasn't from the purveyor, it was a random drop from a legendary supermutant.
---
Umm....10k caps or plasma granade plan(would throw in sloth plan) or a scout vanguard right leg 2nd star DNT matter wwr for the third.
---
Taking a break? You mean the game you claim to have just booted up recently? So you're gonna go have fun, but apparently pepper that fun with the exact same thing you think is gonna give me an ulcer, non-stop. Sounds delightful.
---
Weed, that's how you deal with adversity? You just get baked. Which is perfectly fine, in and of, itself. But don't tell me that you're somehow properly adjusted and mature, then admit you just get high to not think about it.
---
Lofty standard? Well for starters I was being sarcastic. But you know, the idea every every critic of the game needs to be super polite, extremely well informed, and present ironclad arguments with pinpoint accuracy, never once making a mistake. 
---
While you stumble and stagger through infantile posturing, all because some one said something bad about a product you played no part in producing.
---
Now you're just at the point where you've run out of your own derivitive argument, so it's just lame trolling.
---
I gotta be honest. This is really boring. So I'll do you a favor. I'll do what you pretended to. I'm actually going to go play something myself, and forget you even exist. Because I got my point across, and you're just reinforcing it now.
---
Jesus Christ. That sounds pretty gamebreaking to me
---
Proof this company doesn't care and why we shouldn't support this bleeding company in any future projects. I hate being lied to over and over.
---
So you don’t know how quoting works, got it. Reddit, YouTube, and occasionally playing the game were 3 parts of what I said but you cut out 1 part and then acted like Reddit is my only source as if I would forget that the other two parts existed? You clearly don’t know the implications of a quote vs a paraphrase. 
---
In your next post you said “you admitted you don’t play the game!”
---
What actually happened is I said I don’t play the game anymore.  You have no idea how many hours I’ve played in fo76.  You have no idea if I stopped playing 6 months ago, 1 month, or a week ago.  Since you acted like that was a point against me though, please tell me, how long have I played the game?
---
Watch out for mannequins and teddy bears they are actually the biggest monsters alive
---
I haven't seen one in two days. All of my gifts are from Santatron right now. I will admit that there have been a lot more random legendaries though. Like level 5 legendary protectron and eyebot.
---
You know they are just named "calibrated shocks" and not named "excavator calibrated shocks" right? Easy to overlook
---
I actually do track damage values and I’ve seen no difference at all with the handmade’s damages
---
So either OP hasn’t played since the TSE nerfs like you said, or he’s experiencing the beefier enemies someone mentioned above.
---
Haha, yeah god forbid you have strong reasoning if you’re gonna treat a video game like the anti-Christ. 
---
Anyways, so you still haven’t given me a mailing address for my mug? I need to get that sent out
---
There was a nerf after the TSE nerf, but still that was every weapon, even non legendaries that were effected by that, but again that was months ago!
---
They removed it because people abused it by setting up traps for clueless players that just want to trade.
---
I’m still seeing them! What platform? I’m on PS4
---
&gt;scorched breast heads
---
Damnit man, they've gone too far.
---
It's a secret!
---
I was trying to replicate that photo mode bug and see if there was something new (you know, lately there has been some secret changes to the map), and actually got inside by clipping the door xD
---
You say this, as if you're not completely and utterly full of crap, and I somehow owe you anything. I can do whatever I want, now. 
---
I made my point. 
---
You can't contest it. 
---
We're done here. Unless you can trap a leprechaun and wish yourself up an argument that doesn't suck.
---
Savage Divide has all sorts of neat flattish cliffsides. Just pick a mountain and start roaming around.
---
I just did big Bend and had 7 santa scorched in one run. Most were 2* enemies with 1* drops.
---
It is going to my stash. Don't want any hacker to steal it from my inventory xD
---
Got it on ps4 for Christmas, love Fallout so I’m super keen to get started!
---
Handmade plan, lever gun plan (bos robot vendor), combat rifle plan (that robot event reward). Probably materials scrap so they can craft scrap and learn the mods for these rifles. That is the most awesome thing i can think of.
---
What? Minecraft, Ark, Teamspeak, medieval engineer, etc. all have the server software free to download and run on your home server for free.
---
Electricity doesn't cost money if you run solar or wind on your property.
---
And that's why you should always check vendors xD You can find treasures in there
---
I thought the servers ran on Todd Howard’s personal computer?
---
Go to the regular one and push right for Santa version
---
Other than picking up and moving your camp, is there any way to control where fast travelers spawn? I've tried changing the position and orientation of my CAMP device, but it makes no difference.
---
Yes
---
Any chance you can hop on quick?
---
Made my day "Anti-Theft Stickers" thanks.
---
ps4
---
It can be much easier if you do it with multiple characters, but yeah, 400 tokens for the full outfit is too much
---
Why does platform matter?😂
---
Don’t fuckin move
---
did the airport and collision course and not 1

---
I'll get my axe.
---
Its trolling, but you'll most likely will not get banned since you're not exploiting a game flaw or hacking. Worst thing that could happen is having a bad reputation and getting shunned by people who are aware of that.
---
What are you trying to do
---
Hmm have you tried a new server? I run around the map checking every spot where scorched spawn and I’m a finding them.
---
Where in the build menu is the fast travel mat for workshops? This would be very helpful.
---
Reflex is to take the head off.
---
Most them he would have as he does a lot mods but thanks
---
LUL.  Reddit debatelord who defends dishonest journalism argues dishonestly then runs when held to a point.  Glad you did what you were told though and at least mustered up the spine to answer me on the misquote, I expected you to give up a post ago.
---
&gt;  It's a matter of how easy it is and how much can be done
---
No its not. This is just some shit you made up. There are hacks for every game. Fortnite? Tons of 'em. WoW? Way more. And those games aren't built on engines MaDe FoR mOdInG. Well maybe UE4. But my point still stands. 
---
Save me your faux indignation. It doesn't matter what bethesda does you will always hate them. You bitch about cheaters but when they get banned they just come here and tell a fake story about how they were banned without cause and you will immediatly side with the cheater. And then outrage press will drop a bunch of articles about how bethesda is banning innocent people.
---
Someone could bludgeon someone to death with a nuka cola bottle and all the headlines will say "Bethesdsa responsible for murder?!?!"
---
I've noticed that with some camps too, i messed with mine and situated it enough that everytime anyone fast travels there, then they're always facing my camp. It's really they way the C.A.M.P. is set up
---
I’m sure it will at least be worth what you got it for on sale. I feel I’ve gotten my value out of it since preorder.
---
Also:
---
I’ve been saving a tone of plans high level and rare plans for y’all  😉
---
That shelf looks like a maxed out budget to me.
---
This sounds like a 'who's the best at having no life' contest.
---
Your comment of calling me an asshole must have gotten removed before I could have fun with it...I'm kinda bummed.
---
My Vampires Tesla shotgun is amazing for healing
---
dude seriously  it takes about 5 seconds to look around .
---
ALL trap bases i have seen so far screaming at you, its  trap base.
---
pressure plate only on one side of the door , don't enter 
---
long coridor ,don't enter etc..
---
The only trap base i would love to see on my own eyes is Kazamati's , he is like the funniest builder of these ever, too bad he is on console
---
Same.
---
My middle son and I play FO4 “together” and with 76 having a private world option to actually play together— I broke down and bought copies. I haven’t fired it up yet but this sub gives me hope that it’ll be a neat little place to get lost in.
---
Yeah similar thing is happening to me right now. I tried to renew for a year and I'm still not activated 2 days later.
---
One thing I do consider is what one other player that had many multiple characters told me a while back, that he has multiple characters not for muling it storage but for different builds. 
---
As simple as it sounds, this was rather eye-opening to me. It really can present an entirely new way to approach and play the game, and is something I’m strongly considering. Intrinsically, we all play the same game quite differently dependent on our individual builds, and tackling the game from a completely different build view than the one I have been married to since pretty much Day 1, really brings out almost an entirely new Game from the existing one. 
---
Sorry for derailing the post and veering away from the OP’s question. 
---
But as a point of reference, it should be noted by the OP, and anyone really, that just because someone is high numeric level doesn’t necessarily mean they are an Elite, Endgame, Top Tier, or whatever the proper nomenclature is, type player. 
---
Case in point, true I’m about to hit Level 400 and still haven’t completed the Overseer Quest, any of the DLC quests (including the Drunk robot ones) or the taxidermy quest ones, and about 1/4 to 1/3 of my map is still undiscovered. I SUCK at PvP combat. Low levels have come up to me as asked me for pointers and I tell them to look up CaptNoob and RifleGaming on YT.
---
I got this game for $1 and played it for like 2 hours total, yet you are counting me as a player, lol
---
This is killing me.  why pay for a private server that I can enjoy with my friends and they cant come with me.  this game is SO BROKE!
---
I wan one too. I've been scrapping Grognak axe for a while
---
Dude! You have the most insane Fallout collection. Holy crap.
---
I'm too late!!!!!!!!!
---
Cranberry Bog, assuming you’re OK with the occasional scorchbeast attack.
---
I have it. My normal price is 300c. But if everything falls through for you let me know via PM. Well give you the Reddit discount as well. I’m in Texas (US Central Time) and can jump on pretty much whenever. GT is the same as screen name.
---
We weren't able to do it, so we might be able to do it again
---
Yea I am aware of that, also they scrap for black titanium which is another thing I found out, but still NOTHING. I've tried forever to find the mods. I'm sure I can find the plans but if someone already has a pair of the mods they can haz presents, or caps whatever.
---
Did they croak?
---
cornudo del orto, anda a que te negreen a vos
---
I'm down. It's a major pain but I'm down.
---
I dont know where in this post i gave you the impression i can speak what ever the fuck that is my bro
---
I've never had this happen. I spam it with Xbox controller, and all functional keyboard keys.
---
How many plans are you learning? The most I've tested with is ~50.
---
Yeah they messed up building bad I end up just throwing it together and not bother with it unless I need to move it.
---
Then they expected to make a lot on camp items when then they're so lack luster.
---
Minimize workshops and maximize camps and reduce bubble size for survival tents as well.
---
The main problem is how they set up servers having to spawn your house everytime you spawn in screwed your camp but it would be nice to see most of those items return to camp mode. 
---
Building is way too limited
---
Conversely, I'd also like some of 76's stuff back-ported to 4's workshop. Especially those wooden walls with the glass windows and shutters.
---
Let the downvotes commence.
---
I stopped bothering with the extractors when I found I could get tons more ore just running around in my excavator armor and harvesting the veins that are all over the world. Aluminum, lead, copper, and iron veins are all around the area surrounding Lucky Hole mine.
---
Before you ask for more building options (yes please) you might ask for an increase in camp budget.
---
Watch out everyone, we got a badass over here!
---
Frognak is grognak's pet i guess
---
Gifts are located in the Aid section. If you have 1st grab as many workshops as you wish to farm. Build santatrons there and go to any area populated with scorched. I claimed all of the workshops in the forest area and checked on them every time I was done running an area. That got me every holiday drop in a day. I will also say glasses caverns is a great place to farm if you have a group.
---
Landslide
---
A couple nerds with no kids is kinda dangerous. Whole house looks like some wacky Merch museum.
---
Opportunist scavenger would be more accurate
---
The scorch beast head is, I got it earlier today!
---
I got the scorchbeast head today. Was pumped
---
While this is technically correct. Do not forget about the drop off of earning Atoms after you have completed most the challenges. Daily and weekly challenges alone are not enough to purchase the all of the limited time offerings.
---
I"m almost positive its supposed to help load speed because I ALWAYS used to watch my camp pop in piece by piece until not too long ago.
---
I'm a Canadian cryptid collector! I'm currently saving up to be able to visit Point Pleasant someday and I also have the beginnings of a cryptozoology sleeve! 
---
Happy Holidays!
---
I can't find any
---
I dont want a version of each. I said they are rare which is objectively true, you then started going deeper into drop rate and number of plans possible to drop so I did the same. My point is that you can argue semantics all day but at the end they will still be rare.
---
Nothing like warm irradiated hugs! My wife got me the pip-boy stand for the one I built last year plus the radio mod.
---
I feel like that would be a cool collectible!
---
If they don't lock it then they are inviting you to take it!
---
Post proof? Sorry but I find it very hard to believe. 😅
---
Very interesting, I take it you used the spawn everything script to get the purveyor and script machine there?
---
It is, there are glitches that grant immunity to their own explosive damage, that is being heavily abused. But it's not just that, it's the excessive availability of grenade launchers. They're one of the most damaging weapons, and are readily available in common yellow crates.
---
I’ll put a pic up shortly when I get on
---
Might have to give this a crack. Been hunting for the BOS jumpsuit for a while. Came across on but couldn't afford it. Might have to just grind uranium fever for a while
---
There’s a huge flat space in the mountains by site Bravo up in the savage divide
---
I dont really get the downvotes tho, noone was harmed in the making of this post
---
It’s something we’ve been wanting since beta. I like the display cases but I really just want to clutter my camp up
---
Gotta lock it if you love it
---
Its ok it was passed along to the dev team and its getting looked into
---
Is there gifts spawning in santatron?
---
They have a higher percentage chance to drop than many other plans. Comparatively speaking, they are not more ‘rare’ than a weapon or armor plan. 
---
You’re more likely to get a Mounted Mothman plan than a Baseball Bat Plan, even at level 1. 
---
All the weapon plans, armor plans, PA plans, weapon/armor/PA mod plans have a more rare drop chance than a Mounted Mothman.
---
You’re not understating what ‘rare’ means here. That means that it is less likely to be pulled from the RNG than other items. It doesn’t mean that there is a ‘less than X%’ chance it will drop. 
---
You could have a pool of 1000 items, each with an equal chance of 0.1% to drop. None of those items is ‘rare’ **compared to their peers**. 
---
By your logic.... **everything in these loot tables is** ***rare***. 
---
And that’s a ridiculous point.
---
Not an active player. 
---
Also why are you even here if you don't play or have any intentions to play?
---
I havent checked for a bit, waters more valuable to me then mongrel head plans at the moment lol
---
Oh for sure. But mine wasnt spawning gifts yesterday
---
Thanks for the info. Now I know what extractors to focus on.
---
Add me outlonewolf92
---
You can build them in workshops
---
Yea noticed that power op in collecting but not much acid on hand so was looking which extractors to use. Thanks for the info as well.
---
If someone leaves their items open and unlocked, you’re not ‘robbing’ them. It just means they are being generous. 
---
So, acting like you’re doing something ‘edgy’ or ‘dangerous’ when a lot of people leave their collectors unlocked for visitors feels kind of cringey to some people. 
---
That might be why you’ve gotten a bit of backlash. But you’ve also gotten some upvotes from people that found it amusing. 
---
Just my two cents. I personally chuckled at your post.
---
10k will be perfectly reasonable awhile after the event ends and people no longer have an easy means to acquire these plans. 
---
Patience = increase in value IMO
---
Good to know especially since lead made thing for bullets. Thanks for the info.
---
Definitely acid worth grabbing then for later. Thanks for the info.
---
well i’m sure i can launch and clear the silo solo at 15. however killing the queen will be a bit of a challenge 
---
when i do t i will post a video
---
Where do i imply im edgy though? 
---
And if i left my car unlocked and someone took it id still feel pretty robbed, 
---
Theres nothing edgy about it, the guy left the server the camps just glitched there its not on maps or compasses, so i figure its just chilling for a bit
---
Oh in general yeah there pumping em out still my bad
---
Cool thanks
---
Do the eyes and lips move still?
---
That's enough information for me appreciate your hard work I bet your camp looks amazing 🤗
---
I didnt ask a question, or recieve an answer
---
I think it will, of course. However, I think the only way for the non-fans to decide the game is good is if the game cranks out cool updates, like Wastelanders, without a hitch for a year-or-two (Battlefront 2, Destiny 2) or just straight up release a maaaaassive update that "soft overhauls" (for lackcof better term) the game and remedies a lot of what people dislike about it (No Mans Sky). The game was starting to get some positive traction before the Fallout 1st and hacking issuea came up. Such a shame.
---
Anyway... no one knows for sure the impact it'll have, of course, we'll just have to wait until it releases to know for sure how much of a boon it is.
---
It looks like it'll be an interesting change to a now-familiar world, so I don't see why not.
---
if you don’t pvp at all then get Lead lined. DR and ER is easy to figure out but rad resistance can be a little work.
---
I’ve played the game. Friend gave to me for free. Tested every patch. My conclusion? IT’S A SHIT FUCKING GAME WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER...
---
I got the icicle lights from a scorched drop,  don't remember what size.
---
[3 santas](https://ibb.co/f1NgrPs)
---
I found one in Bend and two in Glass. That's it. They seem a lot less common now, and they all have had shit for legendaries.
---
Interesting. So if our Bethesda account is linked to our Steam account, would Steam recognize we already own it? Seems odd for it to release on steam and have it still be through Bethesda. Would only really be paying for the steam integration, it seems. If thats the case I figure there'll be a discount of some kind to buy it on there, like Dark Souls Remastered and Skyrim SE. Who knows!
---
I get it too, and the only thing I can surmise is that **Bethesda Doesn't Care**.
---
|If they did care, and I mean honest to god care rather than try every trick in the book to line their pockets, it (among other notorious bugs) would have been fixed ages ago. What make me sad  is the state of the game. Ill play it until its dying breath, or until Bethesda flips the switch on the life support systems, regardless of how good the game actually is. I can only hope they do something before it's too late; if it isn't already too late.|
---
|:-|
---
SHOOT IT IN THE FACE.
---
Then all of the drops are ‘rare’. And therefore if they are all rare, that has no meaning or bearing.
---
I saw a couple today.
---
Actually, three spawned at my camp at whitesprings when three legendary scorchbeasts randomly flew over and attacked my camp.
---
(Bloody stealth commando with a bloody FFR combat rifle put them down pretty fast without too much camp damage...except my red rocket sign :( 
---
Also randomly saw another at someone else’s camp when I fast travelled.
---
Yeah i get what you mean. Why cant they make everyone who attacks a enemy gets the same weapon? It may even balance things out so that everyone who fought the sb queen gets the same legendary. Itll make people want to fight her and nlt be disappointed when she gives you a nocturnal leather arm and the next guy a Bloody Explosive Gatling Gun.
---
Traps are just part of the game though. Clever players have been getting us since forever lmao.
---
You may be right, but it isn't impossible
---
You were on a team that somehow got flagged. Pacifist doesn't matter, it just stops you from doing damage.
---
Lucky you were guys because I use that alternative pipboy view since b.e.t.a. and my game freezes to an unresponsible state almost every play session while using aid.  I can't even remember now when did it start to happen, maybe 6-8 month ago. The only thing that seems to help as people kept posting here is to favourite the aid items in question and use them vua shortcuts only.
---
About every one I killed had a bone club.
---
Ahh.
---
I can’t really comment on a non stealth bloody build.
---
I run a bloody stealth commando and rarely get seen, let alone hit.  When I do though, it does seem somewhat random as to whether I get one shorted by a level 50 charred ghoul or it takes off a small chunk of health...however, I just put it down to different perks not Proccing.  There is so much rng and probability going on each time.  (Serendipity, dodgy, the special stats that effect it).
---
☆Frognaks  Axe 
---
 Level 69
---
Yeah the turrets are the worst for me when doing the silos. But in any case whitesprings is a good place to farm and west tek as well but west tek is all high level super mutants. Maybe you can find some people willing to run you thru
---
I have zero confidence that it will launch smoothly. I have some confidence that it will reinvigorate the game, at least for a time. But honestly I'm keeping expectations low. If it works about as well and is about as fun as nuclear Winter then I'll be pleased. I'm expecting something more along the line of the vault raids, which I think are a dull chore.
---
You might want to list your platform...
---
I hope it's true that you got one.....
---
Ok. So basically pacifist works like normal until a teammate off pacifist agros somebody, then the whole team is agro?
---
Until people take over your workshop and own all the lovely stuff you put in your vendor.
---
Make sure youre running when you get your first hit in.  Gets a good staggering hit  and usually takes a good chunk of hp off.  Blunt weapons work best against bots.  
---
West tek, generals steakhouse whitesprings resort and the area around watoga are good farm spots.  Uranium fever, awol armaments, line in the sand and guided meditation can all spawn legendaries enemies.
---
I've done multiple. I have seen a few tonight. Did collision course with 3 other randoms, and saw 2.
---
Yeah, I have a level 50 friend but he wont really help. He just sits there flexing his fallout first and asking when I'm going to get fallout first.
---
Did I see a mannequins? 🤔
---
That, good sir, is a very good point!
---
Platform: PC
---
The power sledge I use does around 35% more damage to bots but I dont really see a change in the damage. My standard sledge hammer 2 shots assaultrons but my power sledge is a 4 shot. 2 guns I'm looking for are the explosive gatling gun and shotgun. I'm also looking for some good melee legendaries.
---
When they take over it changes to their vendor not ours...
---
Sure dude
---
The scrap box would have been better, you can at least get the fridge with atoms
---
Yes. 
---
PVP in this game is a bizarre broken thing. Just doesn't really fit the form of combat. I hit you, so you can hit me, so I can really hit you. You jump up and down in place and spam quantum to negate a tesla, all that good stuff.👌
---
nah that thing gets a quick shotgun blast and half a heart attack directly into its little head
---
Agreed!  For me it's a VATS sniper at 300, heavy wep PA char at 260, complete mess that I keep re-purposing at 180, hunter at 60 - multiple chars is a great way to keep the game a bit fresher.  I agree by L150 you've got your character stabilized, had a chance to get the right legendaries for it, and have all the good supplementary cards and are probably the one helping other people rather than the one being helped.
---
Samezies
---
Sounds like it may have been a Scorched Horde, by the non-Santa Legendary. Nice find!
---
Ooo that's a good way to look at it
---
Too much hassle for 20 atoms. Also, it's quite easy to miss the sloth spawn when many people participate, someone might one shot it before you even find it. Still, it's the only semi-reliable way to find a sloth in the bog.
---
HAHAH :)
---
Might just be a matter of swapping out your perks.
---
It is, I’m not on imgur, but if you are on PS4 you can join my party right now and see it on my wall
---
I'm not at home but you could send me a screenshot through the playstation message interface.
---
Big Bend is my go-to. I know Glass Caverns is a better farm route. But it requires a ‘bit of extra work’, mining ultracite and what not. 
---
Big Bend is a simple. Run. Hop server. Repeat.
---
There are also chess pieces in the shapes of robots, king queen knight pawn etc.
---
If you dont like it why are you here
---
Yeah that wasn't an exploit but if you think of it from the perspective of someone who didn't get that opportunity, it's pretty sus.  I think the 'exploit' for XP was the repeat trap disarming trick that let you walk away and just tick up XP. Glad that one's gone!
---
Dm me your tag, I’ll send it and maybe you can post it for me
---
It better be
---
As someone who's chars have a collective level somewhere over 750 'not looking completely sad' is one of the main drivers for splitting my game play over multiple chars :) :)
---
My bad I was mistaken, didn't get one of those after all.
---
I have seen less people upset about changes on here, and more upset about anyone voicing their displeasure tbh. For instance during the beginnings of the most recent hack uproar, you would see a person say they got hacked and immediately a bunch of people comment that the person was lying. Sure there are pages of posts about what's wrong with the game, but just as much if not more posts by people ridiculing anyone with the audacity to suggest there might be something wrong.
---
My recent build was the only time I tested it. Didn't seem reliable, though I was able to stop spawning at the base of the cliff by replacing the camp device farther from the edge.

fix your game bethasda, we need frognak

Does the vendor inventory show up on the map?

Well I mean, this one time at band camp...
---
True. I'm mainly focusing on a 1 hand melee build. I might switch to 2 hand because of kevduits video

Yes - everyone knows this.  Go for it.

Yes, it has been posted about. It does work.

Atom attainment rates were too high due to a glitch in implementation.  All Atom rewards for challenges have been reduced by 15%.

It's in the code but not available yet. Data miners found it in the code after the last patch.

You should be pairing a sledge with the slugger perk.

During the beta, as a low level vault dweller, I ventured to the Whitesprings for the first time. After being chased around the backside by a gaggle of ghouls and surviving, the sun had set. As I skulked around the southern edge of the resort, under a clear sky and a bright moon - I heard a strange noise.
---
Nervously investigating further, I saw it. Two purple orbs staring into my soul. As I slowly approached, it's wings flung open. It was a Wise Mothman. I was scared at first as I had never seen one before. I realized that it wasn't aggressive so I walked up to it to get a better look.
---
Before I could get close enough, it launched into the night sky in an ephemeral poof of smoke. As I looked back down, I found myself on a cliff side overlooking the lush green grasses of some putting holes. It felt untouched by the apocalypse.
---
It was there that I built my camp where I would stay for nearly 8 months. It provided me with plastic golf balls, a random spawn location and a central location on the map. I had devoted my life to the Mothman in hopes that he would visit me again.
---
He never returned, but when I moved my camp, I built a Taco Bell where I lead newbies into a secret upstairs Mothman shrine, perform a ritual on them in the proper garb and reward them with a marsupial serum.
---
It works.  But god damn does it get tedious quickly.

And you gotta flush all your chems before the cops get you

Wait what? How did ErectBan have anything to do with the footage? The footage is from someone who figured out how it could be done in order to report it and a fix to Bethedsa. I don't understand how you are proposing ErectBan's involvement in footage from a totally separate party, but that is somewhat misleading
---
I have a few cal shocks ( mods ) but PC - I used to see them around but haven't for awhile.
---
Listen to you foaming at the mouth. As if Bethesda killed your parents. You equate bugs and nylon bags to physical violence against your person. You are obsessed with hating this game. 
---
Of course I have issues with this game. But actual issues. Like it being in a content drought for close to a year and balancing issues. The hackers aren't ideal but they've been a non issue for me so far. Other survival games have waaaaay more hackers and cheaters but we don't get daily kotaku articles about that. The only affirmation I need to know that I made a good purchase is having over 100 hours of game played. Did you ever stop to think that maybe people enjoy the games content? No of course not because you are to busy screaming about cosmetics. Like that fucking matters. 
---
Speaking of, its one of the most mundane MTX shops. Look at a game like Path of Exile, which is universally loved, and they can charge up to $460 for stuff. You are just looking for any little thing to bitch about. And you will believe anything anyone tells you as long as it paints the game in a negative light. I would be surprised if you even played this fucking game
---
I don't give a shit if you like the game or not. I'm just calling out your disingenuous opinions. Complain about actual issues and no grasping at straws because you're still crying over bethesda owning the IP.
---
I hate hate hate any Colonel Gutsy. Whenever I do AWOL Armaments I have to give myself a pep talk. Those invaders are real bitches though — 110% correct.
---
Those scorch really croaked when they saw you coming.
---
It’s totally worth identifying the terminals that disable the turrets during silo runs. If you do they’ll only be like 3 that you have to destroy. Also the terminal that bypasses the reactor core shutdown too, if you’re looking to save time.
---
Oooo, thank you for the idea.
---
I cannot keep different builds available to me. If I get frustrated with an aspect of a build I want to log out and get on a different one. then when I run into an aspect of that that annoys me I log out again. if I have to many options avaidible I will stare at the log in screen and get stuck in a decision loop. I probably have gotten 50 plus characters to level 50 and deleting them because of a fatal flaw I discovered in playing them. essentially if I dont restrict myself to one character for the most part I will get distracted and off into the weeds I go. My main guy now was the result of me getting fed up one day and deleting every single character I had. it was the only way I could get my annoying brain to focus on one thing. he began as a sniper. I kept getting annoyed at his inability to deal with large numbers of small things, so I converted him to commando, but the ammunition was a pain in the butt, I decided I hated perk card swapping and crafting and constantly farming for lead etc so I decided to go mele explosives. the plan was to shoot down nuke card drones with missile launcher. that failed horribly, 86 plus missiles and the drone still flew away. so I ended up picking up a laser gatling and just to play with it I went and tried its and was amazed, no perks in heavy weapons at all and I easily shot down the drone. AND obviously a laser gat does great against many small things And big things up close and at range. so I altered him to be a heavy laser gat gunner. laser gat was perfect over all but as much as I loved fuision core production ofr long term efficencies sake I started getting annoyed at farming and capping the power plants. I suck at pvp so I was vulnerable to getting ganked and trolled, after this recent hack attack I lost all my legendaries. it hurt Alot but it forced me to recognize a the flaws with my build so I decided to change him again. 
---
and i altered him to this https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f495959&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s82sg2e82em1eh2ep0c72cr0ii0ip2s72at1ls2lm2lt2pj0pq1ib4p10&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=BOS%20Heavy%20Natural%20

with my current build I run the silo and queen fights like a boss. I use nuka colas for heals and make nuka grenades with all of the regular nuka colas. my main gun is now a vanilla gatling gun. the 5mm is light only ways .001 and does a lot of damage per hit. the fire rate is a little slow for really big mobs but thats where the nuka grenades come in. when running silos and destroying the mainframs I clear out huge portions at a time because of the blast radius. I wanted to force myself into finding a way to make non legendary items work well in case i ever got hacked again and I succeeded by a long shot. with the inclusion of grenadier and nuka grenades I have actually improved my silo run time by at least 3 or 4 minutes. when its time to destroy the mainframe cores those nuka nades take BIG old bites. I have never enjoyed clearing that room like I do now. just boom boom boom boom done NEXT!. also I use the nuka grenades when the queen summons her wave of minions and destroy all of it but the really tough ones. all the anoying lowbie crap gets toasted super easy barely an inconveniance. 
---
basically running stock now I only swap perk cards hard bargain. the gatling lets me farm enough mats from the silo and queen fight to replace its own ammo. When I buy out the soda fountain bot I buy all her stock, use the regular nukas for grenades the rest for heals. instead of spending money to take a workshop now I buy nukas. instead of a fast travel to the shop I fast travel to the white spring, instead of building a generator and fusion core gatherer I take a loadscreen into the white spring.
---
my current build is exactly as easy and painless as my old build just as effictive and it doesnt require a legendary at all. I am going to keep tweaking efficency in my gather routes and expirimenting a bit but I will end my legendary boycott when I am 100% sure I am at optimal efficency . I am looking forward to see how well this build plays once I upgrade the ultracite power armor and get a good legendary gatling gun. its already pretty beast in vanilla.
---
Are you talking about the terminals that require level 3 hacking? If so then I feel kind of dumb for skipping out on them.
---
Check to see if the variation when you click type (wether it be the eyes, nose, mouth etc) and make sure it’s set to type 1 or 2. Might’ve looked fine in the vault but see if it’s changed; the details tend to fluctuate here and there but 1 and 2 look to be the “youngest” looking  settings
---
Yes i do
---
Beat me to it.  
---
Well done chum. Well done.
---
Two unyielding armor pieces with decent second and third affects, a bloody axe, all the rest trash from a full load. So better than average for that waste of time.

I think if we want to have a vendor at a location that can be taken, that adds to the risk of owning said location. Could be fun.
---
Hes on of the turds from youtube
---
Couldve been around in the early days of perma trap disarming.
---
I had so many legendary scorched today I ended up leaving a bag full of legendaries at a players camp. Everywhere I went I heard sleigh bells
---
A friend told me the explosive bait from roses quest works on scorchbeasts. Might give it a try to help with that last one but I also hope we get some quality of life updates as well
---
He was following me around so I booked on out of there
---
Hes on youtube, about as famous as juicehead...
---
I'd kill for cozy scavver mod in this game
---
Good to know
---
I noticed that each of my characters ages as they level.  I thought I imagined it until I went back through all my photos taken over time.  They look grimier too.
---
I had the same issue. When you add or remove wallpaper it will remove all power connectors, posters, lights, etc. and store them. I suspect when you placed the wallpaper you inadvertently removed a power connector. 
---
I would suggest placing the wallpaper first, then placing the power connectors. Make your connections to the generator, then place lights.
---
Yeah, they're supposed to be the professionals at solving their game. i shouldn't be fucked for knowing how to code really well.
---
We ended up finishing after you crashed :( 
---
Always down for runs, invite me of you see me on.
---
Nope. It will try to be but will ultimately fail to please. I would not doubt that it's the last DLC for 76.
---
I had a level 800+ in my camp the other day. Struck up a conversation with the guy. Turns out he was a disabled vet and besides his rehab had basically nothing to do. He said he didn’t get out much because of his PTSD so FO76 was his outlet to be around and interact with people without physically being around people. Props to him for making it work.
---
I have 13 Mr fuzzy tokens 😔
---
I'm willing to help. PaladinZed, add me.
---
Kudos!
---
Thank you so much, but I just sorted it out &lt;3
---
Thank you for offering!
---
Ha! That's nearly my situation. I didn't get my cptsd in combat but I do have a hard time finding friends and getting out there so I wish I could meet that person
---
I've never used an exploit, am level 415, played since Beta. I did take 3 months off though
---
I can craft the shocks for you or I usually sell the fully crafted calibrated legs in my vending.
---
About 5 days ago i lost my power armor pieces fighting the scocrch queen with other players and a person was running around in underwear and i'm on ps4.
---
I think my buddy pygmy is up around there. Dudes that hit events a lot looking for rare plans for the last year have huge numbers. He's never exploited any of that stuff.
---
I don't really see them changing workshop defenses since less people claim them because they don't want to pvp, but I still think that's a great idea
---
Never heard of him
---
I was running around with my mic on and he said to turn it off...since then i hate him for thinking because he has a youtube channel hes special.  Fuck him
---
I really wouldn't admit to using a mod, because Bethesda doesn't like it and it possibly can get you banned, but all we really know is it's the files and some people can see it, haven't checked for myself yet
---
Maybe it's because time passes in game
---
There needs to be more creative players like you. So many people don’t put any thought into having fun with the game. What platform are you on?
---
Got it every time myself on pc
---
Wow lol. I've seen juicehead in game before but he was just playing, no party or streaming and I've seen that guy maybe 2 or 3 times in game. Another guy I watch is on pc but never heard of him at all.
---
Dont forget the robobrains and the robodog
---
wallpaper removed everything IN and OUTSIDE.
---
figured that out when my water pumps stopped working
---
Ive taken a few month long breaks, only about 270 or so tho. I'm not saying its unachievable. Just that it couldve been through exploits as well
---
Ok i know there has to be a robobrain model, but a robodog?
---
By entering their property without their consent you have violated the NAP and they can legally use Vietnamese tactics to evict you from their property
---
&gt; Bethesda’s been giving everyone ammunition while simultaneously putting a target on their back
---
I can't deny that, they haven't helped themselves one bit.
---
Almost every single one I've killed in the entire event has a Grognak Axe or Shishkebab. I was really hoping your typo meant there was an axe resembling the electric frogs from the game out there.
---
You've reached "high level" when the level up notification becomes a chore.  Oh, I have to pick another perk I'm not going to ever use... ok, sure, this one I guess.
---
"i hope Wastelanders kills a lot of bugs", i mean dude come on every patch every update bring back old bugs or new ones. You think a major patch will change anything????
---
Just be glad the game isnt more broken, and knowing bethesdas sicne Fallout 3 that wont happen.
---
That’s how I was able to get all the Heavy Raider plans this month!!! 
---
It’s definitely worth a shot.
---
Anything will be possible with enough Atoms.
---
Can you be more specific, with map points maybe? I wandered around North of the Glassed Cavern, East of Cranberry Glade and Drop Site C2.... never saw a single Sloth.
---
Darn what system you using? I’d love to do it with someone. Only plan I been trying to get is plasma grenade I spent months and still nothing.
---
Fo1st can unlimited stash the scrap until it's time to craft ammo needed for a deal. That is what so sweet about ammo as currency.
---
niiiice
---
I swear my connectors are all still there, but I guess I must have missed some. I'll look again when I've had a break
---
Ok now we need photos of all that other cool stuff that's in the background :)
---
Someone would happily pay that. I put one in my machine for 15k as a joke and someone bought it within an hour.
---
Oh, shit. I'm blind af.
---
That's so inconvenient! I wish I never tried it... fml
---
well i mean the fact is the game still have MAYOR issues for a live service game from a triple A game.
---
From the lack of costumer respond to more glitch still active since day one. You too should fallow your own rule and dont paint the game as is on a better place since the star.
---
There are major graphics glitch that you still can find on Fallout 3 and 4 and that show how terrible is Bugthesda fixing they, and how much they depend on the community for it. And Fallout 7shit make a bigger impact on the community that any of the previews game. The community will never be the same thanks to this shitty game.
---
Do both at the same time ;)
---
Don't worry, with those binoculars you'll see your ban coming from a mile away
---
I was thinking about this today too. I think, in a few months, I'll be selling mine for 500, 750, 1k.
---
*grabs popcorn
---
How?
---
You are joking. They are mostly garbage. I am selling my regulars for 250 and small for 50. Large I open myself. You are welcome to buy my entire inventory and try them at your prices.
---
Do people buy?
---
700 caps. Large wrapping paper only costs 1400 if you have a Charisma of 25. With Chemist you get x2 results.
---
Oh no, I meant to the robot vendors.
---
Selling a few hundred purified water with maxed hard bargain.
---
I'm pretty sure there won't be one. After Wastelanders there likely won't be anymore updates except to the Atomic shop and the occasional return of holiday events where they just turn on a switch every now and then.
---
That's now, though. I'm talking end of spring/beginning of summer prices.
---
I heard the Russians figured this one out way back before the Great War
---
I couldn’t afford to spell that out but at lvl 190 I’m still looking for one. (PS4)
---
I have 30 k 5.56 on my ps4 account and haven’t played in months rip
---
Relax, kid. Just because someone on the Internet doesn’t agree with your point of view or opinion isn’t a reason to get twitchy, lol.
---
Ooh, you and u/xkarisma should start a crime syndicate!
---
You know this makes you an accessory right?
---
Opinions can’t be ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’. 
---
Facts can be. 
---
It’s a public subreddit. Anything you post is open for discussion.
---
I have one. I wouldn’t be able to get on until Sunday night though
---
Thats wrong bro facts cant be incorrect lol
---
And opinions can be very much either 👌😂😭
---
Tenderizer doesnt work atm.
---
A false statement presented as a ‘fact’ can be incorrect. 
---
A piece of information previously believed to be true and considered to be a fact, later disproven, is a false fact.
---
Ah ok, with HB 3 and a Grape  Mentats I think I get it to 1440 or 1420 per. Pretty close anyway.
---
You clearly need a dictionary, 😂
---
i admire your enthusiasm but we all know this update will just flood the game with new bug's and revive some old just for the heck of it.
---
It does work - atlasy in Nuclear Winter
---
To maximize your selling value, get your effective Charisma to 20. That gives you 25% of Base Value.  For purchases, a Charisma of 25 lowers the buying prices down to 175% of Base Value. 
---
**These are the maximum results. Any Charisma above 20/25 doesn’t further affect prices.**
---
Hard Bargain adds +3 *invisible* Charisma per rank (it doesn’t show in your Pip-Boy) for buying/selling only. 
---
Grape Mentats adds +5 Cha. 
---
Sweet Roll adds +3 (Can be hard to find/craft, so Mothman Egg Omelets are a good alternative food for +2 Cha)
---
Beer adds +1 Cha (up to +3 with Party Boy/Girl)
---
Certain Underarmor can be modified to grant extra Charisma. I use Protective Lined Military Fatigues for +2 Charisma.
---
Unyielding Armor can boost all stats except Endurance by up to +3 per piece, for a potential of +15. 
---
I have an alt that has a Charisma of 1 and uses Unyielding (+15), Hard Bargain 1 (+3) and Beer (+1) when selling and I pop a Grape Mentats (+5 more) when buying.
---
A little prep before shopping can make a huge difference.
---
But thats not a fact anymore so its not a "false fact" its just not the fact anymore the new fact is correct the last one i guess just becomes an incorrect opinion sir
---
NW aside, its currently bugged and not triggering in Adventure mode.
---
If you make an image post you can make exactly 1 photo.
---
If you want multiple, you have to either set up a collage or post em to Imgur and link em all.
---
i get this ce warning since last ps4 systemupdate (which coincided with fo update)
---
it broke my main character, cant craft, detailview or do strong melee attack otherwise it crashes with this error code.
---
no errors like this on 2nd char weirdly enough.
---
if you cant get past the main screen that might not be an option, i suppose you already reset the database of the ps4 (not full reset!) and cleared the cache and a reinstall did not fix it either?
---
And we have to pay for it....why?
---
Same. I'm done farming at this point. If I get it, great. If not, oh well.
---
Did everything instead of a reinstall because the game is 82 gb something and deleting and downloading again without being sure that it will work 100% . idk....
---
I forget the name, and can’t be bothered to look it up, but there’s a syndrome where a person can’t see things in a relative manner. Their local government passing a law that directly violates their fundamental civil rights doesn’t chuff them at all. A game company changing a decision? Well, \[REDACTED\] them sideways, it’s time for a holy Crusade!
---
Its not defending Bethesda. It’s telling people to have some bloody damn perspective. It’s a game. If it’s disappointing you, walk the hell away from it.
---
Did you put a skin on it?
---
why would you equip adamantium skeleton and tormentor? do those perks have a benefit/synergy with other perks?
---
i never found a use for them what did i miss?
---
If there really was a froggy axe I would create a new character &amp; design their build around it
---
Honestly I don’t get the disdain for trap bases. Dump off all your junk at a train station. Aside from that, you don’t loose anything in this game. Death is only a mild inconvenience.
---
Had that HOTS glitch before, only once tho and i do it many times daily.
---
Probs something in patch 16 broke it
---
It is a known bug, it happens around Christmas, Chanukah &amp; any holiday that involves food.
---
You dick, don't go suggesting things like that. I hope you were joking!
---
No you didn't, it's not dropping, you must be mistaken.
---
&gt; a few players losing items   
---
&gt; only a small number of characters have been negatively affected 
---
They clearly have no idea whats going on, or are lying out their ass. There's proof posted to YouTube and forums that hundreds of players have been effected and that's "small"
---
I'm farming a mix of Santa scorched, purchased gifts and Santa-tron gifts. Originally I was getting good drops from purchased gifts and now my best plans are coming from scorched. The medium gifts seem to give me the best plans esp for PA.
---
no the t60s do not drop from this event
---
Right, that explains why people haven't been answering my trade posts!
---
yea they will still be a bit more rare price wise then the rest will be now
---
Post like this make me orgasm.
---
Great info, thanks!
---
I've had the t45 plans drop for me had the arms and chest pieces
---
this. active searching for it is waste of time imo. either you get it by sheer luck or queenfight.
---
the method of tagging it then fasttraveling to bog while someone else kills it sounds interesting, probably fun once but a hassle to repeat.
---
Right now it goes into thousands ... Good I didn't bother to come back.
---
Too creative lolol
---
Hmm, I thought lvl 900+s were pretty common lately. I saw a lvl 1042 a little while ago - now that's dedication :D
---
Damn, where are those times when Bethesda was one of the studios who were really caring about their player base. If this is ever going to end, it must to end with replacing the whole upper echelon of this pseudo gaming company. Creating new engine and gaining back the reputation is expensive, IMO too expensive for their current financial status. People responsible for this should loose their jobs and change industries ... 
---
What's most sad is the fact that we are loosing the opoortunity to see new great games here. Fallout and Skyrim are (or were ...) both great. Instead of creating new engine, to keep up with the times and continue with them, they are trying to milk this old cow. Look what Capcom has done for its Resident Evil series ... they created new engine and are remaking all their old games with great success. All the old fans are happy, new people are starting to care about it and even buy the old versions. Heck, they even created the site to keep the player base in one place and release new challenges. This is how you do business, reputation is everything in this industry ... and Bethesda Studios now is just a wreck of its old glory.
---
Not fixed
---
Kotaku is allegedly blacklisted by bethesda so of course they talk shit whenever something negative about the company happens
---
just look for fallout 1st members, since they have unlimited scrap i'm sure they'd have grinded lucky hole mine to stow away thousands and thousands of pounds of lead and steel for you to buy from them possibly 🥱
---
I also thought of soloing that method by applying DoT damage to the sloth in another location and teleporting to the cranberry bog. I guess it might work if DoTs will be enough to kill it in the process.
---
Hey if you want a tip about these realy high level players, you can go to their CAMP and check their vending machines, they usualy sell good things for a pretty low amount of caps.
---
I don't think there will be a TES 6 or Starfield after Bethesda is steamrolled with lawsuits.
---
NO, Will Robinson.
---
I would literally bust a gleeful nut if they added the concrete structure set from Fallout 4. If they added the robot workstation for making your own guard/companion  
---
 @,.,@&lt;3
---
Shouldn't be that way either.
---
I use all 2&amp;3 * unyielding pieces deep pocketed and mostly BOS; as a bloodied build it boosts my strength points to unholy levels for heavy guns or melee and I can carry over 500 easy without PA. PA reduces my carry weight and damage output. I couple this with barbarian and my DR nearly matches that of PA minus the rad resistance. Plus with dodgy and serendipity I can take a lot of damage.
---
Might have started working now
---
It had been doing it for a few days
---
I also did store everything turret wise and then just put a few down at a time to see if working
---
We had a 1000+ post a week ago. That guy needs to speed up.
---
Lvl 8.
---
Im currently looking to buy a white powder outfit. Maybe selling it?
---
My 12yo daughter
---
It happend to me too. Only reinstal helped
---
Agreed, this game is lonely af, and asking friends inrl to play this game with me just results in me being laughed at.
---
Agreed, why take away a tool for us to communicate with online in game, I believe it hurts the social part of it
---
Fifty fifty.
---
Yeah, there is a note in the Whitespring bunker where someone is concerned about this. Of course, that person might just be very paranoid.
---
The note is written up in this old thread:.
---

I sold them at 1c.
---
Keep doin distant thunder
---
Check out captainnoob on YouTube. He has a stealth bloody commando build guide I used to help switch from run n shotgunner to stealth sniper.
---
Not to mention since everybody is in the cavern there's a good chance your run is emptied before you do, or at least that's my feeling after doing it a few times for no legendaries.
---
I run a vampires vanguard on my favorite character, all vanguards seems effective, not a math guy may not be the most effective
---
Then don't.
---
I mean, challenges have come a long way, and I think they are now balanced.
---
My only wish would be to have "monthly" in addition to weekly and daily, but aside from that ...
---
literally a bipedal toad with an axe.
---
I’m a sneak commando bloodied build, use forest scout armor; 4 pieces of unyielding and one chameleon. These are the effects:
---
2* chest unyielding AP
---
3* LA unyielding AP fall
---
2* LL unyielding AP
---
3* RA unyielding strength fall
---
3* RL chameleon strength sneak
---
The unyielding boosts to stats is great, mainly for perception (vats), agility (sneak), and luck (vats fill meter), but all are useful. 
---
AP regen is the best second effect. Harder to detect while sneaking is an amazing effect to, lastly I find no fall damage to be a highly underrated effect, especially as I’m low health all the time, is great just to be able to jump off a building or cliff with no fear of taking any damage.
---
i try to get only BoS armor.
---
mod it to dense or leaded.
---
mix legendary effects to have protection against robots x 2, insects, scorched, poison x 2 and deseases. 
---
i leave other effects to random.
---
Little late but you can pick it up easily enough from trade communities on the cheap. I got mine for a new character just a few weeks ago for 7k.
---
is there no textchat on pc? i use messaging system of ps4. works perfectly.
---
They can make a quest where you have to find plans to make a cell phone of old or a holo with a Pip-Boy program that adds communication to friends and maybe community on the same server as you And you have to find it then make the hardware and upload it to your Pip-Boy or antennas all over the map in strategic locations for full coverage no matter where you are or how deep in the ground or how high in the air you are too.
---
Not if your talking to me, if I am ingame not leaving to use PlayStations funky chat system
---
Break it down by region, just add text chat it let people make connections
---
U need bloody mess
---
I'll stick with the game. Was high as a kite and decided to walk the entirety of the Mire since its the spookiest part of Appalachia and saw two scrawny looking guys walking around I thought it was the Power Armor glitch and went up to say hi but oh no it was two Wendigos. I immediately took of running and they gave chase. In my panic running through the trees I heard a shaky sound and turned to my left and saw these red eyes staring at me then boom The Mothman attacked me. I didn't stand a chance he killed me but he'll he's a hard to spot cryptid so I went back for my junk and to kill it. Thinking the Wendigos would have done some damage and it'll be an easy kill I was mistaken two dead Wendigos and a unscathed Mothman. It was a fierce fight of him shooting brain waves and me hiding behind a tree. Took about 15 or twenty minutes and lots of deaths before I finally took down the Mothman.
---
Im waiting for an update of any kind and it might fix it because an update goes through the whole install while "copying" . The last update on PS4 was on December 5th according to my research so I'm hoping to get any kind of update. 
---
If the update thing doesn't work then I'll do a reinstall (SMH..)
---
Open the corpses inventory and you can see without picking it up
---
Hack was patched days ago and there has yet to be any reports of new or currently working exploits that endanger your items or character. It should be entirely safe for the moment to play but just make sure to check in on reddit often as we know the hackers are actively trying to grief to the community and will more than likely create new ways to do so.
---
I run a commando sneak build with 3 Unyielding  and 2 Chameleon wood pieces just to make it a bit more stealthy and it looks cool in my opinion also have a full set of BOS Unyielding armor if feel the need to have more dmg resistance.
---
Just uinstall this crap. This quasi half-baked product should have never been called a "game".
---
Ok cool, I tginj o recognise your GT from the trading sub! I'm just on now for a little bit of you are about?
---
Yea that's true but I dont know if its just me but sometimes I have to check the corpses twice because of the infinite loading time it would just be more convenient without having to do that
---
I had something like that recently when scrapping a 3*armor piece. It turned into a 1* as soon as I put it into the machine. I took it out again to double check but still only 1*. 
---
I wasn’t really fuzzed with that one but I would be cranky if I’d lost a star on an item I’m using.
---
I have a full set of WWR as carrying around lot guns, full set Troubleshooters for silo runs &amp; Encryptid &amp; full set Zealots for SBQ. My daily runabout has TS, Zealot, Bolstering, Regen, Exterminator mixed with AP refresh, poison, disease resist with couple pieces better sneak can pop on if want. Sturdy Frame perk is my friend 😉
---
When I'm playing sneak character I rock sneak to the extreme. My builds never use bloody because I personally dislike how much it changes the game and the fact Bethesda is made to balance the game around it.
---
I use full wood 3 star legendary armor all modified for shrouded which is found during the main story. Shrouded wood armor is by far the most powerful sneaking gear in the entire game by a massive amount. Each limb weight less than half a pound and chest still weighs less than a pound; each piece giving sneak movement speed buff, better sneaking in darkness and super lightweight. Stacking legendary effects like better sneaking, chameleon, weight modifiers, anti radiation and ap regeneration makes them a very powerful set in the hands of any sneaking centered build. Not only that but you can buy them incredibly cheap with my pieces usually bought from player vending for under 1k caps each; most players don't know how good wood armor actually is. You won't be taking damage when you literally never get spotted.
---
I'll keep my fingers crossed for ya bro
---
Exactly what I do as well
---
Wow.
---
It's a social media platform, by giving everyone a voice you get the good, the bad and the toxic.  
---
Some people whine, complain or gripe for the sake of it, or more likely for a reaction.  
---
The human race is a mixed barrel of personalities, and mindsets, social media just enables the scum under the barrel to rise to the surface and infect others with their twisted opinions.
---
The skiing outfit and the straight jacket are almost all white
---
Nice system to be honest, 76 is not that demanding, my game crashes sometimes and I can only think it is server latency related as mostly it is totally stable gtx 750ti and 4670k, low res but high settings, runs smooth in 1st.
---
Congrats, something on my bucket list.
---
Go naked and only carry your berserker rolling pin and you should be fine 🙃
---
Unless your Bloodied your not going to reach the damage cap in PvP
---
If you open them at level 5 or below you have more chances of getting the plan because level 5 have a smaller loot pool it works I got 2 from opening 20
---
It was a really rare drop from just one event.
---
Vanguard is pretty good until you're in a situation where you can't heal every second.
---
It's under "Misc. Structures"
---
Easy solution for the trap part, just make the travel mat only for the camp owner. Other players will just spawn normally but you can decide for yourself where you want to spawn.
---
So beautiful a lovely build, thanks for sharing 💕
---
They got rid of them because they glitch out and spawned you underneath and inside thongs, not because of abuse! The problem is camps load long after you finish travelling! They won't be viable until they change how camps are loaded!
---
Said the half-baked doofus browsing a subreddit for a game he doesn't play.
---
Ah, ok. I never use Grenades, so I never paid much attention to the plans for them.
---
Started a new character recently, was considering a sneak build, might give this a go once I've level up.
---
I've tried bloodied and gave up on it for the same reasons, just makes the game less enjoyable for me. Main character build is full prime heavy but been looking for a good junkies weapon to maybe move over to.
---
There is a chance of Bethesda selling the TES 6 Ip to another game company like obsidian but I don’t know if that would work for starfield
---
Wastelanders shall not only add a shit ton of bugs but also make the game unplayable for a while.
---
Be prepared. And avoid the first day less you dont value your things so much.
---
Remember, it's bethesda hosting. Same people that refuse to fix Skyrim bugs before releasing it on switch.
---
You really have nothing better to worry about?
---
Any more broken...It'll be more broken after this huge update.
---
Nothing to be greatful for
---
Text chat please
---
Be careful with that. Never know who could steal it. Or if you'll lose the world.
---
just so I understand, you are quitting because of dupes?
---
it was during the weekend before xmas.
---
it coincided with the freeplay weekend last week and ended with it
---
Wastelanders shall suffer this game a devastating blow packed full of old n new bugs.
---
Oh my gosh its real! Thats so rad
---
The double XP event was live from Dec 12th to Dec 16th.
---
So your leaving the game because of something does not really effect you
---
I’m pretty sure Bethesda kinda confirmed we’re playing in a “beta” build. I remember one of the community managers commented and said something along the lines of there’s two different builds, the one we play on, and the internal one with all the NPCs. My guess is that they have all hands on deck for the Wastelanders build, which is the up to date build, then they have a skeleton crew trying to take some of the fixes from the Wastelanders and copy/paste them to the live build. I’m guessing that when we get these updates that end up breaking more than they fix is both because they don’t test it first and two, it works on the Wastelanders build but, since the live build is missing a lot of the features from Wastelanders, something with the code and engine just breaks. It’s really anyone’s guess though, but I have faith Wastelanders won’t be a buggy mess on launch, or they’d have released it in November.
---
Oi, the looking glass thief! You should be banned from internet for life!
---
I have received all of the following from santatrons or holiday scorched - no purchased paper
---
Gorilla head
---
Icicle lights
---
Plasma grenade
---
Plasma mine
---
Santa crash
---
Gatling laser
---
And tons of other mount plans, prime plans, PA plans
---
If you're on Xbox, you can do either looking for game and mention the disabled vet bit or start a club specifically for disabled vets in FO76 (or just gaming in general!)
---
I didn't understand this part. I know they can be targeted in VATS. Can they not be hit otherwise?
---
 His prison has holes blown into the walls and cells everywhere, remember?   😉
---
That an atom shop putchase....
---
They have fridges for sale in the atomic shop that do just what your asking for. 👍
---
Same
---
I think its going to be awesome
---
Mate all I want is to play on a server at MINIMUM 30fps, that is all I fucking want man.
---
😁👍
---
There are some spots/events where you will face bots only: silo runs, AWOL and bot horde events. It's well worth it to collect Troubleshooter armor for such things. Stats and level don't matter much for this purpose, only the -15% damage from bots and turrets per piece. You should be able to pick up some decent pieces from player vendors, they are usually not expensive.
---
Sounds like fun!
---
Do this and then travel to your own camp, crouch (if you have chameleon) and put a rubber band around your left stick so you constantly walk into a corner....   go afk and come back in a couple hours, travel the circuit and clear out the santatrons....I did this a couple of times and ended up with about 80 large, 150 regular and over 250 small...
---
System?
---
Ps4
---
*12 hours
---
I’ve been asking for this (along with a mail bot) for a year now. Here’s hoping they someday make good on this.
---
If you’re looking to quickly manage them, just install the perk loadout manager mod.  It’s a game changer.
---
I know that kind already :)
---
literally unplayable
---
Nice ! I haven’t had much luck I’m still squishy
---
Hahahahaha. You guys are still trying to get quality of life improvements? Lol.
---
Some people just can’t let go.
---
I’m a little confused. Are you saying you wouldn’t pick up a 1 star weapon if you knew it was only 1 star?
---
If you got it for 7k, it was duped.
---
Naughty
---
I don’t even know where to find my santatron in the crafting can anyone advise please
---
Both. Nukacrypt if you want the easy way out. Or find all silo pieces, decrypt using keyword cypher.
---
I suppose that’s true, but those ghouls are extremely squishy for a high level character.  I’m sure even a vanilla lvl 50-45 auto grenade launcher will turn them all into pink mist instantly.  I guess it’s about bringing the right tool for the job.  I want an axe for chopping wood, and a scalpel for model making.
---
That outfit can drop for any daily quest or event happening in the Forest.  I got one during Collision Course and another two for doing Strange Brew and Ecological Balance dailies every day for scrip.  If you’re on PC and need one, I’m sure we can work something out.
---
So 94 is working again???  Damn that's fantastic
---
Well... Okay then. Haha
---
Sorry man, I don't currently have that problem. But I can understand the frustration
---
[deleted]
---
I guess I should actually look there first!
---
Sorry on Xbox
---
Wastelanders will never drop
---
Appreciate it but I'm on Xbox and trust me I'm sure plenty of people are wondering why my lvl 250+ ass is constantly running around the forest doing events and dailies.
---
Wait how does this get you gifts though? Maybe a dumb question idk lol
---
You’ll get it eventually.  It took me forever to land a leather coat, then the urban scout mask came a month or two later.  Just stay on that grind and don’t get discouraged.
---
I’ve run 76 on everything from a Core 2 duo and 750ti to a Ryzen 7 with a RTX 2060.  
---
Some days it crashes, some days it’s fine.  
---
Seems to be server dependent.  
---
FPS drops are the norm in some areas and with some things.  I’ve noticed Fog Crawlers really cause a drop...like they have a bugged mesh.  Probably quite a few render issues with all the items underground you don’t see.  
---
Eh.  I wouldn’t worry about it.
---
Image posts are not allowed directly. Need to link an external image hosting page.
---
I can’t be on for a few days but I remember walking straight east of Watoga and I saw one sloth wandering around and another nearby fighting off scorched, it’s probably about 100 feet from the border of the map just walk up and down that area until you find one
---
Follow the connectors and check that they all are green. Something is broken somewhere.
---
Recently started seeing this in people's camps...such a cool idea! 
---
Also instead of "looking for" you could say "want" and save a ton of space
---
😂😂😂
---
Scorchbeasts are fine you just don’t know how to fight them. If you attack then while they’re in the air, it’s gonna stagger then and reset their landing animation and then they won’t land for a little bit. Just find cover and sit there and it’ll land eventually within a few minutes
---
How do you go afk for an hour?? Every 20 min my character disconnects for inactivity if I leave it...
---
Are you skeptical as well?
---
Xbox here too. BiAxialSphere00 I also play GTA Online
---
I've heard sometimes Mad Dog Malone is simultaneosly at 2 places - at Grafton dam during Manhunt and in the prison - during Jailbreak. Maybe he has a twin brother? Or a clone (clones?) ? That would explain everything ))))
---
I thought it was an axr exclusive to the event or something.
---
Not a valid answer, unless you’re an eleven year old girl.
---
When I've turned in all my scripts I usually drop single star legendaries because I try to conserve carry weight or especially when it's a one star and it weights 10 to 20lbs
---
The recent hacks demonstrate that the bugs we've been dealing with since the beta were just symptoms of poor engine choice for a public multiplayer game. The whole thing needs to be ripped out and rebuilt from the ground up if you ever want decent quality of life and bugs being the exception instead of the norm, and Bethesda just ain't gonna do that.
---
Really?  I can’t get off that easy.  Some get all the luck.
---
Why are you here?
---
Wow. I usually will just sell for cheap in vendor, store for tomorrow, or donate somewhere.
---
I’ve been having this issue so it’s just a free skin and I still have to buy the scavenger thing?
---
I've tried that it usually stays in my vendor for a very long time and when I try to donate no one usually wants it
---
Slacker.
---
Exactly
---
FernieBeTrippin hit me up
---
Dude needs a Frognack's axe.
---
You think Wastelanders is going to fix anything? HAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
at best the update will add more stuff(that will inevitably be bugged) and do nothing to fix the previous bugs
---
at worst it will revive dead bugs alongside whatever bugs come with it.
---
There is no winning with this mess.
---
Enjoy you masochists
---
Agreed
---
You can place a Santatron at each workshop, each one gets 1 gift an hour i think.
---
A rubber band holding the right stick over works pretty good.
---
You can change your character's appearance at any time.
---
Does anyone have access to your account?
---
😂😂😂👍
---
Which plan are you looking for?
---
PS4. English-Jimmy
---
Assassin’s rolling pin here. 🙁
---
Cool! Can we move our date at Sunday because today (saturday) i am at the house of some friends? Anyhow i will found you online 🖖
---
Happened to me until I moved the CAMP device around.
---
Yeah I was gutted, planned some grinding and ended up in hospital from Friday to Monday so missed it entirely. So disappointing.
---
Do you have a NukesDragons for the Melee/Heavy Weapons build?
---
I misread that as 
---
&gt;make one male and one ranged.
---
And was very confused
---
This could work to leave gifts for camps you visit too. I often leave some stuff in someone’s camp, either because they’re obviously low level and could use extra plans, or just because I dig the camp. If they’re not actually there I just have to hope they’ll get them before someone else comes along and perhaps nabs them.
---
I'm here to admire the fact that people still believe this game can be saved.
---
I think bethesda's less than effective attempts to fix this game speak for itself.
---
But... why?
---
Dude the perk doesn't work right now
---
I'm 12 and a half actually /s and I fail to grasp what my gender has to do with anything.. Sexist much?

Well done 👍👍👍
---
Send me an invite. Asully102 level 145
---
Just FYI, the fridges have limited storage (10 spaces, IIRC) and only reduce spoil time by 50%, I think. 
---
The Luck perk ‘Good with Salt’ at rank 3 reduces spoilage rate by 90%, but only affects what’s on your character.
---
Invite sent.
---
Hi there. The hack was patched last holiday weekend. Enjoy!
---
Why do it on a private server? Wouldn't it be easier to do it on public and get some other people to join in and help?
---
I was about to start new character and was wondering about maybe transferring some stimpaks and such. How does this work? I mean when you switch characters you would also server hop or do you do this on private server?
---
And some fucking content lol
---
Far out, well anyone selling on ps4 let me know :)
---
I recall there is a global spawn budget per server for enemy waves, but I do not remember the source, so I cannot confirm this is correct information. But if it is, that would explain why such events are more consistent on private worlds where there are no other people playing different events at the same time.
---
Yeah, I reckon that would be easier. I guess I’m trying to find some people to roam privately with as well. Would you like to join?
---
Awesome, I  guess I missed that info. Thank you!
---
Works well, made one from a vendor sign asking for flux.
---
Had a lvl 311 fella drop by after a whispering run last nite and drop off 3 violet flux.
---
Calibrated legs for my t51b! Thanks Miraben if your on here!
---
Really creative! I love it.
---
It’s amazing. The hack was around for a day and a half, the “fear of the hack” is already over a week long, and the “legend of the hack” will probably be around forever.
---
the round lights?   they are a horizontal string only.
---

---
All journalism is guided by commercial self interest.
---
Is your character's name Lt. Dan?
---
Don’t worry radio television newspapers and use websites are pretty much the same LOL
---
To get the chemist badge you have to make one.  They were damn near unobtainable before this event.
---
You know...not 30 minutes after I posted this it came up again.  That’s three times on the same world in an hour...this is supposed to be a daily event, not every 30 minutes...yeesh
---
I'd much rather have an ugly firefight with a half dozen glowing deathclaws than one mole rat that put my stealth build in detected/danger status, burrows underground, never pops back up and forces me to server hop in order to get back my sneak attack bonuses.
---
I'm actually thrilled when a workshop defense is against a scorchbeast or two.  I can just kill it and not scour the land for that last wolf or ghoul that's stuck in a ditch or behind some rocky outcropping on the periphery of the border.  The Red Rocket workshop is infamous for that.  The few times I've taken it for an atom challenge, one enemy always seems content to live in a derelict bus or hide in a bathroom stall.
---
Depends on what you’re pricing them at in your vendor and your camp location. 
---
Personally, I price my surplus at 75/225/599 for armor and 125/375/999 for weapons. That’s 25c per scrip value, and they tend to move pretty fast. If you’re near a train station, you might even sell them faster. 
---
A player that has more caps than time who wants to get their daily scrip quickly is likely to be a good customer.
---
All five of them.
---
Lol thabks for the reminder, I have to do that damn vault. I did it maybe twice on novice.
---
Very likely. 
---
Lowest price you can get them for is 8750 from a vendor, and I don’t think it’s ever been a loot drop.
---
I worked for PC World magazine for awhile and I know when you’re writing about games and your advertisers are selling games, you do have to walk a fine line between journalistic integrity and client retention.   If you’re going to slam something you make certain that your facts are correct first and you slam it with care.  Now as I understand the YouTube model, you don’t have to acquire your own advertisers so you don’t really care about offending a particular brand or scaring off advertisers that way.  So I think that new advertising revenue model has been responsible for this shift in the degree of toxicity.
---
But that means having to waste 3 perk spots in luck one of the only state that has an abundance of good perk cards.
---
Running good with salt makes you weaker than you could be with a correct build.
---
Levels like these were gained during the time the disarm XP exploit was active, it's not impressive, and it's certainly not legit no matter what shit they try and tell you.
---
Yeah it's broken. Easy XP though, I usually just sneak up the outside ladder to the guy, hit him and "Event completed".
---
And welcome!
---
Thats all fine and dandy until shitty rng gives you 6 lvls of actionboy and all the food and water related endurance perks instead of any perk that might even remotely be useful for a build.
---
I look at them and if it's really quick and simple I'll do it but an atom is worth a penny in real money.
---
I'm not gonna spend 3 hours chasing a daily for 10 cents of reward.
---
It's an added bonus that when just playing normally it pops up I did some challenge and earned 40 atoms etc....    but dont stress yourself out for them.
---
Okay, enjoy... see you Sunday same time.
---
That’s really cool looking
---
Putting PvP back into adventure would basically kill it. Look at all the hacks still being used daily in NW. You put PvP back into adventure and those hackers will bring their god mode autoaim 1 shot kill hacks to adventure mode then.
---
I cannot wait to see the next exploit with this broken game. It truly is a sight to behold. I believe it’s fine now though.
---
It’s like you don’t realise you get to pick your own pics
---
If they just make it so the wings of a scorchbeast can be crippled to force them to land I would be happy with that
---
I don't base this on anything, but I set mine at 10k caps in my vending machine. Both the icicle and Santa crash plans sold yesterday for 4k.
---
In all honesty, once the event is over I'll probably increase it to 15k, or 25k and put up a sign that says I'll trade for 5.56.
---
I dunno about the same experience, but I have noticed at one point I had a very clean shaven and youthful character, one that I use as a mule, run out of water one day and so I started drinking bourbons and whiskeys that I had picked up in my inventory.  
---
When I happened to camera out and view my character some hours later, he looked 'older', dirtier, and had a noticeable 5 o'clock shadow layer of stubble on him.  I went to Change Appearance, he looked just as clean and youthful as always, but when returning to game he was scruffy and grimy again.  
---
I finally figured out, when checking status and effects, he had gotten addicted to alcohol and that somehow the game seems to have an effect that changes your overall look when you're an addict!   LOL!
---
I'll help if you want, Endreaver is my IGN, lvl 359.
---
I've seen Manhunt and Jailbreak active at the same time. Mad Dog Malone gets around.
---
Sent!
---
I confirm
---
Haven't got that yet... I keep getting rolling pins, wooden armor, pole hook, canes... And I went on a murder hobo spree against santa/gift holding scorched for like a couple hours.
---
This event in total, has yielded me no nothing... Except for a couple thousand scrip.
---
I went to the purveyor, and spent it on 60 scrip random 3 star... Same thing as on the holiday scorches, except they were 3 star instead of 1 or 2 star.
---
I'm like, are you kidding me... This holiday event has given me nothing... NOTHING. Such a waste of time really...
---
Also, the game has been been boring to play with no new, meaningul things to do since Wild Appalachia. The players who are left are *not* interested in Fallout - they are interested in The Sims 76: Fallout Edition. They build doll houses and play dress up. Those of us who were expecting to get a Fallout experience are, instead, disgusted.
---
Bethesda messing up all the time and jumping from controversy to controversy and making bad decisions in general doesn't help at all. And Wastelanders will suffer from it too.
---
Joining you now, hopefully it'll let me join since private worlds might still be bugged atm
---
You've waited 4 days already. Just spend the day and uninstall/reinstall. Unless you're on a pay for data plan, then don't.
---
I’m actually doing it public now. Managed to find 2 other high level players public.
---
Oh bet
---
Reason I don't have a mule is because I have no friends. This would solve one problem.
---
Yep, those are the ones. Don’t feel dumb, there’s a lot going on in a silo.
---
I'm assuming you mean a global budget per player, per server?  If so, that supports the idea of a player activating a cell by passing through the periphery and not engaging with the NPC/enemy actors, thus causing more activity for the second player that actively engages in the event, giving them "double spawns".  Conversely, the first player may have "burned" their spawn rate passing through many cells on their way to an event, whereupon they find they only get 1-2 enemies per wave, assuming they activated and didn't engage with many cells on their way to said event?
---
Ha.  Lets see, most are time-gated behind levels. And the "card pack" rng thing is awful.  So yeah.  Make your choices.  Its all shit until lvl 50.
---
These posts are always so weird to me cause I run 76 on a 3 year old Walmart potato laptop. My game has crashed once in the last month and a half of playing. 
---
It’s always higher end PCs it seems.
---
Don’t knock it.  120 caps a run!
---
You need an anchor, somebody who stays on the server you drop your stuff on so you can join them to make sure you get the same server
---
Maybe actually play the game vs reading sensationalized articles and YouTube vids that only exist to drive traffic and get clicks/$. 
---
Game is in decent shape overall (at least the same quality as FO4). It’s not perfect but is entertaining.
---
I honestly don't know how we still don't have true trading.
---
All we can do is item-for-caps, not item-for-item.
---
Ill tell you what to do. Uninstall this piece of crap
---
Interesting. I have ptsd too from a bombing and being in public can be hard, the game has helped me socialize again. This is the first game I’ve ever made gaming friends through that I don’t know IRL.
---
Getting jumped by randoms is the best tho. 
---
Had a group of kids start attacking me at my camp (recently made trap base - seems to annoy people into fighting). 
---
Ended up being 1v5 and while they wrecked my base - I took their caps. Made 500 before the first one of them managed to kill me. 
---
They pulled me into their party afterwards to tell me they wrecked my base cuz of my vendor prices. 
---
😂😂😂 Bless my heart, baby raiders.
---
I'll blast him 2 loads of human kindness for 2 loads of Chally milk.
---
Could try rebuilding database
---
Lawd no.
---
I've come to the conclusion that it's some kind of kinky game that the Warden and Mad Dog Malone play.
---
Its just your classic case of anything that moves is Mad Dog Gang and anything that stands still is well trained Mad Dog gang. Personally i like the wardens kill em all approach.
---
What gives you thee impression I'm a Republican?

If it's not taken I'll take that Handmade from you. Won't be back on until tomorrow though.

I sell atleast 2000 5.56 every day for 1 cap each
---
Somebody make a petition to bethesda to make a Frog Enhanced Grog Axe mod. We can use the blue spikes from the captured frogs (which you can have as a misc item) to adorn the weapon and add some radiation/energy damage to it.
---
here is a really good guide for it, also having a full 4 person squad will help greatly

What
---
A ‘correct build’ is one that the player enjoys. 
---
If he wants to play as, say, a restaurant proprietor, then that would be useful to him. 
---
And there are even good PVE builds that rely on food. 
---
You don’t get to decide what is a ‘correct build’ for another player.
---
Now we know where all that Jet went.
---
NW is an unplayable joke on PC, and Adventure mode keeps having unique problems as well... Bethesda should just give up on the PC side of things, and allow PC players to transfer their characters to the console of their choosing... or cancel fallout first on PC, and allow everyone access to private servers/lobbies for both adventure &amp; NW for free.
---
Pay attention to the attachments on your weapons, those actually have a huge effect on your hit chances in VATS.
---
As someone who works in QA it's really just the game, we try and test it and get user case scenarios, but especially for games like this it's just a big mess and we can't always get enough crash dumps for the devs to fix shit and they don't know how to fix crashes that they either haven't experienced or are just too rare in their dev environment. It'll get better overtime, but I don't think FO76 will ever be crashfree
---
The whole problem with pvp is and are Legendary Weapons. 
---
No one wants to die instantly, it isn't fun. 
---
The only way to make pvp work in this game would be to make all Legendary effects null when used against another player... Just make it a fair fight, and the fun and skill returns. But as it is now, would be just a bunch of instadeaths to explosions from people's guns... And that just isn't fun.
---
It's why NW works, everything is just regular and actually gives the attack time to respond, and makes the attacker have to think on how the best way to attack would be.
---
Until Legendaries are nulled out or just removed, pvp will never be a big thing in this game.
---
I've lost pretty much all hope for Bethesda as a dev
---
Thanks for the Guide, We will retry some day, having a squad of 4, could be the hardest thing to do really, We will be happy with a clear of Vault 94 in Easy mode.
---
We already have fridges in the Atom Shop
---
Believe it or not.... some people enjoy the game and don’t have any major issues when playing. Shocking I know.
---
Strength- melee damage, carry weight 
---
Perception-VATS hit chance, detecting enemies on your map(little red pip)
---
Endurance- health, resistances, (AP drain from sprinting?)
---
Charisma- Prices from robot vendors, shareable perks when grouped
---
Intelligence- XP and junk gained from scrapping weapons and armor
---
Agility- AP points, Sneak ability
---
Luck- Durability(condition bar) of looted gear
---
You receive (hidden) bonuses for each point you put into the different categories.
---
Yeah, farming legendary locations nets you a lot of XP.   Once I realized killing enemies was a better way to get XP than doing quests, I started to do a run through Charleston Capitol Building and Whitesprings at least once a day, sometimes 2-3.  Do that and participate in any and all pub lobby scorchbeast queens and you got yourself a recipe for power leveling. 
---
 Started out running through Charleston 2-3 times a day once I hit level 30-35 and now I’m currently all the way to level 75.  Went from 30 to 75 in a week and a half.  Lol
---
Ha!

It happens sometimes when you use the ultracite ore nodes to refresh the scorched hordes

I dont know about WoW's mail system but hell eso has a mail system that is awesome and works very well. I played eso for years before this and it was very nice to be able to move items from 1 char to another.
---
We have pretty much the same setup . Have you tried reinstalling the game to a different folder or hardrive if you haven't try it after ,also completely uninstalling the drivers for your graphics card then reinstalling them it's a nvidia windows 10 ghost issue. A fresh install should work no problem its probally just symptoms of a corrupt moved etc... file
---
Do they already know the Mutation Serum recipes?   You could buy them one of those if you have the caps.
---
I've gotten many surprises, and have had only 1 I was disappointed in. I don't remember what it was though, I traded it instantly.
---
5 games should take 2 hours, not 5. 20-25 minutes per match.
---
Me as an endgame pvp player would recommend the following changes for pvp aswell:
---
1. Nerf Tesla or make them a chain bolt weapon, not an auto aim spray gun.
---
2. Give us Faction based pvp
---
3. Damage Caps for each individuell weapon type
---
4. Remove Vats from pvp and let stealtboys run out when firing first shot.
---
5. Fix damage calculation and armor rating
---
Hope you folks can relate to my ideas, thanks for passing by. Greetings some annoyed pvp player.
---
A couple questions...
---
1) Is each point of intelligence +3% do?  I haven’t been in math class in over a decade.
---
2) Is hard bargain literally a 3 point bonus in charisma only available when buying from vendors?
---
It's a damn good game, tons of fun. Don't listen to the reviewers, I ignored them cause the negativity towards it was insane. Personally I don't care to much for reviewers cause it's just biased based on solely their opinions, especially the so-called YouTube warriors they are flat out annoying.
---
It does have a ton of bugs like any other game but like many other fellow Wastelanders who love the game you just learn to work around the bugs. Give it time, just play, meet the community (cause seriously, it amazing) and trust... You will love!!
---
yeah those terrible meat sweats make you look for a cool place to cool off and dry your cloths
---
Plus the 10-15 it takes to load into a match then the 3 it takes in the lobby.
---
It shouldn’t take more than a minute to load into a match. Are you really waiting 15 minutes to find a match??
---
You gotta load out of the previous match with a loading screen, then load into another match with a loading screen, I mean idk it takes some time, time that I don’t wanna waste lol.
---
It sure would be kind of them, since the RNG for legendary drops and purveyor is so awful...
---
Oh Bass, what am I gonna do with you 😂
---
Why would you want a higher scrip limit if all the weapons and items you turn in are 3 &amp; 5 scrip per item? 150 is plenty.
---
How so? I'm using a VATS build so would like to know more! Is this for accuracy improvements like recon scopes? Or something else.
---
careful these pricks might ban you for being a  hacker.
---
What we need is Kevin Costner to show up in a Postman’s outfit.
---
adding on:
---
im in EST and it takes 30 seconds - 2 min depending on day/time
---
my friend in EU takes about 5 when he is party lead
---
This happens, and suddenly everyone gunna be mad about getting text based dick pics and fertilizer from random people.
---
Surprisingly, the recipes sell. Dark NukaCola and Rad Ant go for a good hefty sum, but even the regular beers and mixed drinks will go for a hundred caps or more.
---
Yes, however, I think there will be some crazy bugs at first. I don't know if I want to know the patch size that will be coming either. 
---
I'm excited for it tho! This game has entertained me for the year I've been playing. Wastelanders will be a huge thing that could make or break them. It NEEDS to be good.
---
Same here I wont touch anything of theirs again if its "online" they can barely make a functional single player game. In all honesty they just dont have the talent pull to make a online rpg, just look at 76.
---
All underarmors add to your stats unless in power armor. The atomic shop underarmor is just like the vault suit or any others. It can be upgraded all the way to "shielded" to get S.P.E.C.I.A.L., DR, ER or rad resistance bonuses
---
Where you are in the world doesn’t matter, all NW servers are the same. Time of day, sure I could buy that
---
No, I think that’s correct (almost)
---
Int 15 = +45%
---
Rested/Well Rested = +5%
---
Cranberry Relish = +10%
---
Inspirational = +15%
---
Unyielding is max +15 Int (+3 per piece) = +45%
---
(However, I think Int bonus caps at 25?, so 75%?)
---
Wise Mothman bonus = +5%
---
Leader Bobblehead = +5%
---
Live &amp; Love #8 = +5%
---
Adds up to +120% or so.
---
Yeah. Should have created a second team at Zenimax Online and let them do it right
---
I'm too lazy to clear all those garbage quests, but trying to annoy myself with the wall of text so I will...
---
My sign reads a bit different...

we tread the blessed path      Truth"
---
I have my friend sorted with a gift but Thankyou should really say that now but forgot 🤦‍♀️
---
You tube .. Angry Turtle .. sneak .. search it .. just did a three vid series on perks and armor
---
I went with the armor plated because I never have taken the time, or massive amount of caps, to piece together a perfect set of armor. I'm usually somewhere around 300 ballistic 350-400 energy.
---
Lol, there are still thousands upon thousands of items left from the first few dupes. They had no way to track them! Es tu!
---
Try this link for a chart that may help.  I keep this handy on my laptop when I'm vendor shopping.

nice
---
Thank you all for the answers:))
---
It would bug the crap out of me but different strokes and all that jazz
---
That wasn't me, My username is Major Mittens S with spaces.
---
Yeah I’ll pop in if I’m in Morgantown - I’ve got most of them but there’s a few I still need
---
How much boost does it give?
---
Fiddy
---
I did not know this! Thanks.
---
Haha. No, it’s completely okay. We managed to find people and run it with but it was an absolutely nightmare. The instance froze maybe ... 15 times? Terrible!
---
Ahhh that explains it, good job! A friend of mine does that exploit with the ghouls at Whitesprings Golf Club everytime he is on, I swear during the double XP events he has leveled up like 10 times each day cause of it. I'm in a fair size group of friends on 76 and I think I'm the only one who follows the questline's religiously lol. 
---
I did the Charleston DMV questline before the level update a while back. Walked in there after the update wondering why it said "Charleston DMV Level 30+" then start getting ass fucked by a horde of level 62 Charred, Oie!
---
I've seen a lot of people say that
---
I have 100 Nuka shine if anyone wants to buy for caps or trade for presents or power armour body plans :)
---
Remove vats ? If you want to play call of duty then sure :) This is fallout ... vats is a fallout icon regardless of if you like it or not
---
Don't understand me wrong, only for pvp, like they did in Nuclear Winter. It's much more fun like that and needs more skill to play that way.
---
Thank you!
---
\+50 when in effect, -50 when effect wears off, default when worn off effect wears off.
---
where are these articles? sounds like cheap puff pieces
---
You can build more than 1 fridge. I usually have 2 on the go, one for raw meat one for cooked
---
Yes it's been fixed.
---
Vats in pvp is just broken and over powered, it's litteraly an aim bot.
---
Bethesda will probably charge you real money to get the mailbox and send mail lol
---
“Fixed”
---
Good to know!  I just have the Arktos one for decoration, honestly.
---
I’m sure my upstairs neighbors have figured out the secret, you should hear them stomping around all day
---
Well yes, that is the short answer. You can still have stuff placed in your inventory. u/eckserah can explain better.
---
Question since you just ran it.. I haven't done a solo in about a month. Have they fixed not being able to blow up the cores or do you still have to manually pull them all?
---
I’ve noticed in free range if you are facing large waves, the likelihood of the sheep squatch there being a 3 star, or two 1 stars is increased
---
I’m sorry. What cores are you referring to exactly? Just want to be sure.
---
Well that's silly. Feels like punishing the majority for a minority's sense of humour (and even at that, a lot of the trap places I've seen are actually funny and clever).
---
Wish his name was displayed too.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/EBOwUCk](https://imgur.com/a/EBOwUCk)  These have been datamined all the way back to Patch 5- It's a surprise we haven't seen anything involving them yet
---
Yes! THANK YOU. Your a legend
---
Actually, I think it was "addressed"
---
How many times are people gonna post this? It’s been patched for a while. Only items can be placed in your inventory
---
How reliable and trustworthy? I was into the trade market heavily for a bit but could never get those big trades going because of the above max cap prices of endgame rolls. I made a mule but never used it because all my friends stopped playing.
---
I agree. Thank you
---
Wheres tesla lobbing barrel plan?
---
This is pretty normal.
---
Yes it was fixed within 12 hours or so... and there def was effort involved as you needed to modify the code... and it was only on PC
---
Graham got hit with the inventory hack too... poor guy, just wanted a good life for him n’ Chally
---
I don't know that, in particular because your interpretation of 'flood' is likely not the same as mine. I try not to exaggerate. 
---
While the base game has continued to drag along plenty of issues, the new content they've added hasn't been plagued by bugs so much as lag and design issues.
---
I heard this will be coming right after text chat.
---
This is brill. I'm saving it :)
---
In wow you can send mail to any of your other characters and it can sit in their mailbox for 30 days, then it gets returned. It's common practice to juggle items in the mail to save inventory space.
---
I have a proposal for you. I'll drop a nuke up in the valley where there's tons of violet. You bring me 150 raw violet and any stabilizing mats that you come across while gathering, and I'll give you a set of level 45 calibrated legs.
---
Ill be on for at least a couple hours this morning. Just shoot me your GT. In the meantime, I'll keep my eyes open for the mods. If I find them I'll snag them and sell them to you at cost.
---
I’ve never experienced this
---
At least I stopped hearing shit about Grafton.
---
I consider this being a media clickbait - never experienced something like that.
---
*Some* isolated incidents a few of my group members have encountered. But the majority of it was blown out of proportion by clickbait article, ad revenue generating, "gaming news" sites.
---
Its handy teamed with the carnivore mutation
---
I have Fallout 1st since day 1 and never experienced this either :/
---
Yea we made the deal.  Guess I shouldn't have let that thing sit in my stash for 2 months. Good luck on the grind.
---
The second run of the Halloween NW rewards are what initially got me playing NW. I’m only lvl 38 and still suck but its definitely growing on me. I feel myself getting better slowly. NW is a breathe of fresh air to break up the monotony of the adventure mode daily grind. Plus all of the regular NW leveling rewards are fun to flex in adventure mode.
---
All you do is whine and disseminate false information on this reddit. 
---
Why are you here? Is your life so sad? xD
---
See eso's mail system is the same if its sent 30 days later if not claimed it gets returned. But in eso they also have a vending system with the guilds or whatever they are called I cant remember now it's been a couple yrs. Anyways if you have something for sale it expires after 30 days and back to your mailbox but if you dont claim it in 30 days then it just gets deleted. Ffs when I quit I still had allot for sale and sometimes forgot to go back I lost so much stuff. But that's off topic. But yes a mail system or a account wide stash box would be amazing. Like right now I have so much stuff I would like to move to a mule to hold and for script but who wants to trust and bother another person for such a task. For items I intend to use yes I'd probably bother someone for help.
---
where are the 3 radgoats
---
Yah aside from 38 rounds and maybe 44 every  bullet sells for a cap
---
Got a wired connection? 
---
It might we worth starting with the easy stuff, restart router, use a wired connection etc.
---
Then move onto the other stuff
---
I think you misunderstood. I'm saying people falsely report stuff like that.
---
Citation- Sensationalised youtube reporting. 
---
Have you watched people on youtube,they will talk about minor bug that happened to a few people and report that it happens to everyone. They broaden specifics for clicks and it is like OP is saying "A form of bad journalism that should be criticised"  I know people like to follow that with a whataboutism of criticising 76 and Beth, but that's petty.
---
Have they fixed the bugs with VATS and Gauss? If you charge up a shot before entering vats it was always a 100% miss in the past.
---
There ARE mailboxes they added in several patches back (look in the datamines)
---
but for whatever reason, be it yet another easy duping method or simply holding them over our heads till wastelanders in 30 years they aren't out
---
xD
---
cool
---
Doesn’t the Santatron get full tho weight wise after a while?
---
Ya you are right, hefty is a big word. But still, worth the quick quest IMO.
---
Not sure about there being a cap on intelligence (there was no answer to that in the [data mining thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/f3m8b8z/)), but this statement in the maximum possible boost thread is not accurate, as far as I know: *"Each point in Intelligence grants +2.072% XP, for a maximum of 31.08"*. The reason why the OP came up with that number is that they used 15 intelligence as the base, so with that an additional point would add 1.48/1.45 = 2.069%. But it is 3% per point relative to 0 intelligence, just like in Fallout 4.
---
Have a nice holiday and spread some joy, it'll make you feel better.
---
&gt; the wings as hit markers 
---
Already are ...
---
Ok, thank you. I might see if I can trade it with someone for the Mothman plan. I just cannot get it on this character, lol. If not, it’s going in the machine after the event ends.
---
I see how it is, so only the Christmas celebrators are worthy of your love, eh?
---
Fuck the Jews, right? 
---
I hope you got coal from that fat, overrated, bearded sumbitch!
---
Better.
---
&gt; the wings as hit markers
---
Already are, in VATS ...
---
Neither have I. I see a lot of people in public worlds with scrap boxes.
---
There would be a lot of shit talk tho lol 🤣
---
Ok, thank you. I might just see if I can trade it for the Mothman plans. I just cannot get it on this character, lol. If not it’s going in the machine after the event ends.
---
No worries. I have a bunch of great guns just not a B Handmade. It's all good!
---
People run those when  not  going Bloodied  especially in PvP  so it's not obvious
---
Crafting beer and fermenting at bivs and at one of my characters camps is fun. The weight is heavy in stash per brew and a limit of ten fermenting. Or I would mass produce so that I would not need to craft alcohol so often.
---
I wish I’d known about this as I just recently hit lvl 50 for the first time!  My perks are an unfocused mess but I’m working on straightening them out.  Thanks for looking out!
---
I guess business wasn't doing so well.
---
I think there is a class war between people who wanted this game to be great and everything we were promised and bootlickers who settled for what garbage we got and praised the developers for the at times worst than mediocre product they put out. 
---
Fallout 76 and Anthem served a specific purpose in 2019, they cured A LOT of people of pre-ordering games...
---
They did a take back of weapons a few months ago...Maybe all those duped weapons you had got deleted
---
The two that increase weapon damage are great if you want to use 20% less ammo in exchange for repairing your weapon slightly more often. I use ballistic bock for SBQ fights because repairing a couple guns is a hell of a lot cheaper than crafting 1000+ more rounds of prime ammo.
---
Me at level 80 " How do I drop a paperbag of caps?" 
---
Level 400 " Yup, good luck with that!"
---
That’s where I have my camp, and I the last time I actually seen graham and chally was nearby down closer to Poseidon.
---
I really hope not. That would suck, because I bought them or worked for them honestly.
---
Ya I hear you....I'm still playing as I still enjoy it with over 700 hundred hours as proof, but the game is still quite buggy/glitchy and Bethesda doesn't help with things like patch 16 etc. This doesn't even take into account PC problems hacks etc. If the fun has gone put it down for awhile and come back. Don't listen to the brand ambassadors/shills who will tell you the problem is you, Bethesda has allowed a sub-standard optimization of this game. Hopefully wastelanders will improve the game, but given their history it will likely be an all mighty screw up
---
Am I the only one getting the strong reference 🥛
---
Do it like ESO.
---
I would love that, thank you so much. My IGN is Jake1234204.
---
I think this thing was really, really blown out of proportion. 
---
Never come across anything like it and honestly forget Fallout First is a thing most of the time when I'm playing.
---
You don't have to pay $7. You can get 700 atoms in a week or 2 pretty easily if you do challenges
---
I do experience more bugs in NW now than I did at launch. It’s a shame, hopefully they’ll iron it out. They’re really figuring this stuff out still, and it was an ambitious move to put a BR mode in, they’ll figure out how to sort of fix it at some point.
---
What system are you on? If you're on xbox I'll dig through my stash and find a couple bloodied guns or melee weapons of some kind to give you. It won't be god tier, but consider it a little xmas gift to get you rolling again.
---
Yeah I mean they did a great job for it being their first attempt at something like this. It's just after a few months it gets tiring dealing with the same crap daily. Hopefully some major fixes are rolled out soon.
---
You mean Covin Kestner, right?
---
When running the silo to launch the nuke there is a part where you have to pull mainframe cores out to lower the laser grids in order to advance further.  If you had an explosive weapon you could just shoot the computers and it would destroy the cores. There was an update about 2 months ago that broke the ability to blow them up, so you manually had to click on each one to remove it.  It was tedious combined with the server lag so i stopped launching nukes.
---
Yes it’s false advertising shall we sue them ? You and me we can make a big difference .. smh
---
Had an Executioner's Explosive LMG turn into just an Executioner's a few weeks back.  Thought I was going crazy.
---
It's definitely running a bit better with some inventory cleared out now haha, yeah. Appreciate the advice again!
---
Is t there a dedicated FO 1st area in the Atom shop?. 
---
Last time I looked the stuff there looked relatively cheap
---
Solo tip for OVN: you can hop up onto the half walls by the picnic tables and be completely safe from the ghouls. Just trigger the juke box for a minute to start and then farm in safety from up on the ledge.
---
I like juicehead though, i watch his vids
---
It will be fun for sure!
---
I have seen people mention that they got it from a loot drop, I’ve posted in here that I was looking for it, also on the discord servers, also posted in multiple Facebook groups that I was looking for it, offered caps plus most of my legendary items for the plan.
---
You can Hold the pipboy button to turn the light on.
---
The original fo1st webpage graphic mentioned atomic shop discounts and then it was changed and the line referencing said discount was removed.
---
What he said!
---
That son of a btch killed the only outside legendary scorched at the tunnel entrance for me the other day. No gift for me. Btw he was also missing his sidekick.
---
Some of us don’t like to play that way. I know when I’m going everywhere, especially in that area I’m always in stealth mode with the light off.
---
ah, i see, truly shady marketing geez
---
First day of the mailbox patch: "Bethesda released a mailbox feature but people claim that items are lost when trying to send them. Also Bethesda claims they have no tools(interest) to give the items back to the people"
---
That's a common ps4 error I have had over 60 since I began playing the game, but have always been able to restart the game. Restart your router. use hard wired instead wifi?
---
Really seems suboptimal considering if the game gets leggy they wont proc
---
By any chance, how many notes and holo' do you carry? I had a lot of freezing issues on my first three months on PS4, then I learned from someone that carrying a ton of useless items that are weightless and not stacked impact a lot the performance from a single client to his server.
---
I'm not sure if it happens with the items stashed. But since I cleaned my inventory, and lost my bad habit, I never experienced desync/freez again (playing since June 2019). I moved to PC a month ago, and I'm still fine and I watch my inventory often. Only downside, I have a ton of valuable plans thanks to the event D:
---
Could be shady or could have just been an unfortunate honest mistake. Either way some will be pissed, some don't care.
---
I think they change. I got disconnected 3 times playing on private yesterday and each time I came back to a new world.
---
Cool gamer protip, the beast can get stuck in a non damage dealing loop if you go back over to the fissure site( and stay near the entrance that leads you to the final room with the elevator) then just vats it til it dies, once you are out of the big room it stops being a real threat. As a Bloodied build this helps me survive immensely.
---
No. This is a fallout reddit. 90% of people here played fallout 4 ahah.
---
I made that step from "I like to do my stuff alone" to "It's fun with people :o" the first time (lvl 100ish) a random grouped me to share Strange In Number x). Now I group rabdoms too.
---
I'm sorry, I'm on PC. I should've mentioned that.
---
I kind of wonder if their justification was to avoid a backlash ("1st members get special sales?!"), while simultaneously creating an convenient excuse to keep prices high.
---
Quality of life improvements are in the Atom Shop.
---
Wow this is old and over used. Make up something else for votes idiot.
---
Fix the way things snap, remove some of the restrictions, add the fo4 assets, make turrets better.
---
Text chat is on TOP priority right now imo.
---
It does matter because it tries to find a local match first for better performance.
---
I've experienced the difference just this week. I was playing with some other Aussies and an American, we were waiting 10+ minutes each match with an Aussie team leader so we set the American as leader to see if we'd get put into American queues. After changing leader we were getting matches in 1-3 minutes, it was a massive difference.
---
Yeah I’ve seen a lot of people come to this sub regretting that they didn’t try it from the start because they didn’t form their own opinion and just listened to the bullshit. Yeah the games had a rough start (looking at you Kill Evan quest) and it’s still got a lot of bugs to work thru but it’s a fun game in the end and I can’t wait for Wastelanders
---
Totally, because ESO is sooooo good
---
🙄
---
Eww
---
Vault girls have rad-cooties
---
You have all been warned
---
Yup.  The 1660ti handles it really well too on ultra.
---
Describes things that sound *exactly* like ping and lag issues.
---
Says “it’s not my internet connection”.
---
Okay.
---
FYI - I experience none of those issues. So maybe it is your internet, or your computer. 
---
Also: no one uses VATS in NW for any player kills.
---
Also also: yes, this game is buggy. No one is excusing that. But you’re laying blame on Bethesda for things that are not 100% on them.
---
Dont take the comments personally.
---
This is the Internet.
---
I'd like to see a community board on our home terminals for something like this.
---
Show people searching for this or that from buying specific things to people looking for groups to do raids and events.
---
Maybe ping camps that already have it for sale on your current server
---
Monday.
---
Could be. No one knows for sure obviously.
---
I came across this exactly once.  And in reality, it was just a pretense for a YouTuber to be a jerk to a group of people.  He would have done it anyway.  This was just the excuse du jour.
---
Actually, there's was a really special irony to that griefer, since he came barreling up in the most expensive PA armor ever offered in the Atomic Shop.
---
Relax
---
There never was. 
---
This was never a thing, outside of one or two anecdotal stories that provided no proof.
---
"Criticals" are only achieved in VATS. Outside of VATS it's considered a "headshot" (may or may not be the actual head, eg on a Deathclaw it's the stomach) That's why it's possible to achieve both damage modifiers.
---
Also for hells sake give us a goddamn shared stash so we can transfer stuff between characters. This is basic crap Bethesda why haven't you done it yet!!
---
So would this magazine also increase damage on Headshots, or, orange numbers outside of VATS?
---
Ay pls lmao, and people keep buying Bethesda. 
---
And I keep playing this game.
---
How long were you away from the game?
---
That's just a tab for the free stuff that comes with the membership, you can't access it without having the membership, so I don't see how you could have seen it as cheap, when you can't see it at all, and if you did it would say "free".
---
I don't know... I'm about 50/50 on whether or not the Wendigo is even there.  Which is odd, considering that the rest of the cave is populated.
---
ohhh i know, but lets be real no single DLC on the history of Bethesda have come out with "bethesda issues" and i call it like that bc for some reason they come out with more bug that any other game
---
That reference was removed before FO1st was available for purchase.
---
They do proc just like born survivor.would recommend not using Bloodied weapons and go full health in PvP
---
Tuesday.
---
?????
---
This, 100%
---
Yes it has, they patched it the other day. I went back on public servers today myself. :) As far as we know Beth say it is patched so we should be safe. Well until the incels try to ruin our lovely wasteland again.
---
Well I just figured that plus photomode filters might make screenshots turn out better.
---
Even an extra weapon with an nv scope
---
Exactly. There's already a lot of value in the membership. Private servers, crafting box, atoms, exclusive cosmetics. I don't think 10% off on existing items is really necessary
---
Hah - my CAMP does that now. Without a fast travel mat. Every time you get spawned inside the mountain. Need to fast travel a second time to actually get to my CAMP. Go figure.
---
Lmao you're the expert huh? I didn't say they used VATS to target players they VATS on their thrown grenades and it makes them do more damage. You must not play much.
---
That kinda crosses the line from "shady" to "fraud".
---
I believe it only works on actual critical shots, not "headshots"
---
If someone buys atoms frequently it's worth it just for that.
---
I've had a lot of fun with it since I started playing late November. It outclasses Skyrim by a mile in terms of story
---
You die just as fast.  the thing is if you use those perks at full health you run the risk of being killed before than can proc at there respective thresholds since crits can do more than the maximum damage.
---
That is a great idea.  Then I could have all the unwanted leather armor and melee weapons my friends don’t need or want.
---
Yes, it was patched last week.
---
Really goes to show how none of these media sites or YouTubers bothered to follow-up on this story after their alarmist headlines, because a lot of people show up asking this.
---
Wait... so what you lost was duped weapons? Well... if thats the case there you go, Bethesda wiped those bad boys out.
---
I see, thank your time and info on this, much appreciated. :)
---
I thought that until I worked out  that there are two waterfalls. It was easy once I stopped chucking grenades at the wrong one. One grenade &amp; he immediately pops up.
---
Also I play on Xbox One and almost any player here can tell you that yes we deal with these issues on a daily basis. So I guess every single Xbox player has shit internet.
---
There were people who have...praised Bethesda?  I must have missed that one post.
---
It’s all free actually.
---
Np, also here's a link that might help
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_Hit
---
He's nothing without meet week!
---
Indeed.
---
Pretty much that, but imagine with the fast travel matt, it would enforce that glitch every time, rarther than being slightly randomized and letting you get free!
---
Crits can't do more than cap but goes through sentinal and serendipity. Being at such a low life you will be destroyed by strangler heart
---
What is atomic armour please...power armour? :/
---
Ballistic bock and high voltage hefe both have damage bonuses.
---
I do the quests just to sell the booze and recipes for those not looking to invest time into it
---
The cap is 110 per hit a crit using vats does more than 110 you can test it if you enable the numbers displace to see your damage output
---
Wendigos also spawn at drop site C-2, can be found in the cranberry bog south east of Pylon V-13.
---
What!? I didn't know you could apply shielded to atom shop under armors!! How though if you'd be so kind as to elaborate. Do I need a certain plan or soemthing? To make my special ops Underarmor shielded I mean. Thanks in advance.
---
How do you refresh the scorched hordes?
---
have you tried the actual fallout76.exe file, instead of the shortcut?
---
also try the BethesdaNetUpdater.exe, both of these should be in you're game folder, maybe different folders, but somewhere in the game folder itself
---
Never even did them when they came out 😅
---
I agree. Just reinstall. Most likey that will fix it. This is coming from someone who had the same problem months ago
---
You know why they say ‘addressed’ instead of ‘fixed’?
---
Because if there was every *any other bug or hack* in the future even remotely related to this one, the Nega-Neds would come crawling out of the woodwork and use that as evidence that ‘Bethesda lied’. 
---
For all intents and purposes, it’s been fixed. But if they make an official statement that could be twisted against them in the future, that would be a problem.
---
Crits and vats don't matter since everyone will/should use stealth boys to avoid being vats in general
---
On PC you can run two instances of the game on the same PC
---
You're right, I was thinking of different subs.
---
Yeah but the Daily Atoms thing specifies it must be at the Wendigo cave. I like Wendigos.......well shooting them. They are like the love child of an emaciated chimpanzee &amp; a frog. Hoppy wee fecks.
---
In fallout 3 there is a super intelligent super mutant you realease from a vault that looks a LOT like him only with bigger ears. Not saying it's him just pointing it out
---
Quick, let them know what quality of life improvements are needed so they can add them to the cash shop!   /sigh
---
The only armor that stays when entering PA is under armor like the wetsuit and plain clothing, any additional prices such as chest/limb pieces become unequipped while in a PA suit.
---
I dont use stealth boys much since the damage but popped up on xbox I just crouch so they can't vats me
---
this will sadly never happen because it would create an avalanche of new dupe exploits
---
Staying crouched to avoid vats is bad sincere sentinel doesn't work while crouching.  If u don't use stealth boys u won't get far.
---
Dam he needs a girl bro fucking beastility
---
Monday. :) Is when they did the hotfix for it. It happened on the weekend. They hotfixed it on Monday, taking down the servers.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eepvot/an\_update\_on\_the\_current\_pc\_exploit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eepvot/an_update_on_the_current_pc_exploit/)  posted at 8:15am central my time.
---
How have you accomplished this? I’m curious, I’ve had a lot of trouble getting the game to run on the same PC twice myself
---
When you got FO1st the original plan was to have a section of the shop have discounts only to the subs. But people complained so now FO1st subs just get the things the would have been in there for free. Like the Christmas tent and the new Vegas armor reshades.
---
This is very cool! I wish I could send you some of my existing screenshots, but I've used a filter to make them look like vintage film.  So they don't quite meet you need for clear and bright images.  But if I take future pics, I'll try and remember to get a few unfiltered ones to send your way!
---
If your on PC they have a Mod that will help with finding things you need in the vaults
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/477
---
I also tried the Glass Cavern. I found that sometimes enemies that are tougher than I'd like to have dealt with showed up, like deathclaws and mirelurk kings. I don't want to waste time or ammo on a sponge when I can kill a scorched in 2 hits melee.
---
Or use Night Eyes
---
I am farming it a lot and that bug happens most of the time.
---
Not a game breaker, but it's weird and visually ugly, that's true.
---
[PC] Bring up the favourites wheel &amp; press T - Not sure about the respective consoles. But On PC when you bring up the favourites wheel, at the bottom of the screen it tells you to press T if you want to place the survival tent
---
Youve never heard of client side lag? Basicly like wiggling your Ethernet port on console with crota in d1
---
And why would stealth boys cause client side lag?
---
Meat week was a bust i guess
---
Morning/Evening, I'm on now for a while.
---
I dont understand it my self but it uses the exact same files as it does in fo4 and dosent even function remotly the same. Also take into account they don't do to well with code since they just fixed furious and anti armor energy in the last 2 months also
---
I dont think they were duped.
---
Only about a week or two
---
I will add you to my Friends List!   My IGN is Coxinga, add me too!
---
I wish i was home so i could play...vacations suck
---
Then what you are saying is false about stealth boys, MD and you should use them instead of relaying on crouching to avoid vats
---
Nice I'll be sure to hit you up with my screenshots sometime. I usually take pics of the weirdest stuff.
---
Probably useless unless has the legendary effect for double damage if at full health then throw in the multiplier of stealth might be pheasable
---
i have done all 3 on expert with no mod also. this mod just makes it a bit less stressful
---
I really just want a one shot build. Eventually also good for sbq. But no tank or sonething like that.
---
Shotguns just got severely nerfed, so unfortunately no.  They used to be very OP, but the idea you have, just isn't really possible anymore.
---
Gotcha
---
Ps4 turd__Ferguson lvl96 play 2:00 a.m. Pacific time till about 8:00 a.m.
---
shotgun = shitgun 
---
wait until shotguns are fixed, cuz right now shitguns are very weak
---
ive had mine freeze or kick me out but stays at a black screen 3 times in the last 3 hours i think it might be their servers yesterday since i had zero issues
---
A lot of the vendors can have bulk screws but not always. Vendor bot inventories are somewhat random. 
---
If you need screws I would grab the santatron and set it to find xmas stuff. A lot of the stuff it finds can be scrapped to get screws. 
---
Also hit the NAR research center and grab the desk fans and typewriters in there to scrap for screws. You're on PS4 if I read that correctly. I give you some of you want to add me
---
Around when do you think it will get fixed. And in which way?
---
You have to directly launch the game exe instead of using the game launcher.
---
"C:\\Program Files\\Fallout76\\Fallout76.exe"
---
But I would think you need a second bethesda account and game license.
---
Lions head red blue black?
---
Link?
---
Definitely santatron is the best way, or you can go legendary scorched hunting, if you’re on Xbox I have almost all the plans the gifts dropped plus gifts for sale in my vendor, the plans you can just have, but the gifts I won’t just give away.
---
Mine is mordortek
---
My char is level 19 with shotgun perks etc. Changing it to meele stealth. Would it be worth or nah.
---
Hes a streamer that I've griefed before, he's a piece of shit to his viewers if you watch his stream
---
Oh, man. I had no idea that was a thing. Every single time I ran it I just did one by one. Didn’t think much of it since there were only 15 to remove and replace.
---
You can join a group like this one https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/eastga/the_brotherhood_of_steel_hellfire_chapter_pc/
---
Open up the search bar on your PC and look for those programs
---
Wrong.
---
But you already did it or no? In Italy now is 8pm
---
That’s a good question!  Guess we shall see in a few days.
---
Unfortunately - there isn't a plan for that one. Only drops pre-installed on random teslas
---
When did you play it? I don’t understand why you would follow a sub for a game you don’t enjoy. Pretty sad.
---
No I haven’t done it yet. It’s 11 pm here. It seems like the time difference is quite off.
---
Nothings been said. I’m guess not, there are so many in circulation that they won’t be rare for a while.
---
15 is max, then chems and food and armor and such can take you higher. Appropriate perk/ perk card usage is a huge part of the game and one I am still trying to master.
---
*clomp*
---
Somehow it would be riddled with an exploit.
---
It's a good salvage, because Melee is powerful but needs a way to bring down flying opponents like Scorchbeasts; while shotgun perks are the perfect way to cripple wings and do exactly that.  So there is synergy.
---
There's a Mod for Text Chat in PC.  Won't work in NW though.
---
\#2 I'd love to get overwhelmed. I hardly ever see more than 3 enemies at any location anywhere.
---
You need to find the casual underarmor plan which means knowing all the other casual plans and then doing Queen if the Hunt till you get lucky.
---
how do they make good on something they never promised?
---
Bold of you to assume I have camp budget to spare.
---
The place looks great! My heart breaks for the budget consumed by all those foundations, though. :(
---
I have a junkie shotgun character and there is no PVE enemy in the game I can’t easily kill. The nerf did hit shotguns hard, but they are still viable. 
---
I don’t use stealth on this character, but I’m sure it would work just fine. 
---
Don’t forget to get the enforcer perk. It’s freaking awesome:)
---
Shit. I saw it for sale for 1000 while server hoping looking for a mod for my railway rifle. I didn't buy it because good gift paper got me broke.
---
Sorry if i wasn’t clear. I meant make good on my words, but didn’t mean to imply it was promised in any way. Just hoping for an easier way to transfer items between characters/players, and I thought mail style would be a great way to do so that could be made lore friendly.
---
Never had low level naked people rob all my shit either...in any mmo I played. Lets pretend normalcy is not present.
---
I was dying at Lewisburg, while level 11, when I was trying to get into the train station. I managed to kill all of the super mutants, with my two friends, Legendary Scorchbeast 1 and Legendary Scortchbeast 2. Update: They have respawned and my 2 friends have returned to kill them for me. They are so nice!
---
&gt; I’m sure my upstairs neighbors have figured out the secret, you should hear them ~~stomping~~ CLOMPING around all day 
---
FYFY
---
for 400 atoms for anyone wondering
---
In my experience and playstyle, the best legendary effects are the ones which make the game enjoyable: weight reduction for ammo, guns, meds, food. 
---
Each one of my characters has a dif. Style. BoS combat armor is good for everything. A nice full set of trapper will keep radiation under control and let you walk around fissures, a full set of leather is great and looks Fallout, etc.
---
Play a good game
---
I see that but this topic has been proven false and more poop the youtubers start about the game. I ran the 1st icon and outfit for a long time and played every day. Never had a single comment about it. If it happened then it was very few occurrences, nothing to merit someone saying it's a class war.
---
Yeah mine crashed trying to launch a nuke yesterday
---
Bruh moment...
---
I'd reach out to Bethesda customer support, make a ticket and make sure you have photographic evidence or they'll (probably) just discard it
---
Check Camden park and Tyler county fair, both places have a lot of stuffed toys
---
Sorry was I shouting?
---
Been through there quite a few time and have never found these ones though.  Are they just rarer to come across?
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, I will. But what stops them from saying "oh, you just deleted all your items"? This is the last game I buy from bethesda for a long time if they don't do anything and even still, I doubt I buy anything right out the gate.
---
If Graham isn't safe... no one is
---
Judging by the previous hacking situation. I imagine they will take it seriously
---
Xbox1
---
I actually need a good pve build to kill things in one shot eventually. That's why i need them
---
Exact same situation with me, what platform are you on?
---
How could they tell what went missing though?
---
Hey Bethesda, 
---
I was a huge fan! Then you made FO76. Now you can eat shit. It’ll be a cold day in hell when I buy anything fallout again.
---
Try not to exaggerate lol you dont have to TRY to exaggerate the mountain of bugs this game has had since launch. 1 year 2 months in and FAST TRAVEL STILL SUCKS 50% of the time. 1 YEAR in and they FINALLY fixed jumping when attaching wires. 1 Year in and trade glitches so you cant even trade 1/2  the time!
---
25 as far as I know
---
Wouldn't they take prewar money instead?
---
If you're on PC, I can give you screws. I have so many. Same IGN as here
---
I’d rather only have to wait that amount of time rather than 10 hours inbetween the others take to start again.
---
Possibly, I’ve never really tried looking for them. There’s also another amusement park down in the southwest corner of the map as well, have you checked there?
---
If you think snallygasters are bad, wait until you meet level 62 ghouls when going to low level areas, or the random scorchbeast flying above randomly. :)
---
Lies. Deceit. Everyone knows that 76 has no NPC's.
---
**Waddles off to YouTube**
---
HOT\^S bug is well known. I did OVN last night without issue. Got 5 Legendaries, including the wendigo.
---
There is a chance for it not to spawn I believe. It's also like any other world object. If you collected before and recently you either need to pick up like 150 world objects (I might be wrong on the exact number) or wait for the spawn timer to reset which is like 22 hours or something  like that.
---
Time zone?
---
Bro forreal. I was up north of Harpers Ferry doing some mission and there were THREE scorchbeasts. I was appalled.
---
Did anyone ever get the keg?
---
Gotcha. Well, that's annoying lol.
---
My favourite part is when their attacks sometimes bug out, and they end up spamming their sonic attack, literally went from full HP to dead on my alt in under 5 seconds lol
---
I read here that they will land for Explosive Bait.
---
It has a 100% spawn rate. The issue is that players farm them, so if you don't get there before someone else does, you are gonna have to server hop.
---
You mean Camden Park?
---
Oh that’s a bug? I haven’t dealt with them much, I just assumed it was an attack pattern. Yeah it’s ass. I’ve only fought one, and that was with a level 60 buddy running point.
---
Any idea if other stat bonuses go beyond the 25 category points?
---
Nah there’s another one that’s down around Welch
---
You know, I've 1,300 hours under my belt in 76, and yet starting a new character from scratch is still hard.  This game practically has a reverse difficulty curve.  If you go in with a clear goal for your build, or armor/weapons gleaned from your other characters, it becomes downright easy around Lv. 60.  But *getting* to Lv. 60?  Oy.
---
Go check the Application event log in Windows, find one of the red error ones at the time it crashed and copy paste the contents in here.
---
But we don’t need to know about it
---
Yeah, it rarely happens but it bugs out when it tries to lock on to too many targets lol, normally it shoots 3-6.
---
Oddly enough, never seen it happen with the queen yet lol
---
I've been on a private server most of the day so another player shouldn't have grabbed it. At least while I've been on. 
---
If its 100%, they must transition servers between public and private and I got unlucky with I inheriting one where someone grabbed the plan. 
---
Oh well, I'll get it eventually
---
Game did you a favor. Now you can uninstall this shit and do something better
---
Watch now they’re gonna take this idea and charge us seven dollars for it
---
Stw3793. Level 145. Lemme if u ever need help
---
Thats fine, hes not annoying like gooberbooty
---
I probably will after o collect all my gifts from the santatrons at workshops lol
---
Fawkes?
---
It sucks because I didn't realize they were more than just a storage container and a couple weeks ago the bloody pharma one was like 450 atoms or something. So hopefully they'll put a fridge on sale again or just for free
---
The best was a god roll combat unyielding piece that I priced for 29,500 and was gone in about 10 minutes. 
---
Furious explosive handmade. Some nice scout armor weapon weight pieces, exactly what I was looking for. Can’t complain at all.
---
Am I wrong? Half the people who protested first bought it to “test it out” and now they’re fully supportive of a $12.99 a month subscription for a game they already paid for.
---
They will show up in the shop for 800 atoms. Don’t worry.
---
Same. I tried AWOL Armaments yesterday and the gutsy’s were killing me in 3 shots
---
Rewards worth it?
---
People would pay like 100k+ before the event
---
BulkNwHOLES PS4
---
It's the top post in the forum https://bethesda.net/community/category/233/general-discussion?language%5B%5D=en
---
This is a GREAT idea paired with that home terminal they gave everyone. If there was some kind of craigslist or "Gary's List" if you will that let you post an item for sale or requesting an item kinda thing. Then the ability for messaging to either be in game through terminals or through the chat client of their console
---
ya like years ago when I played WOW I remember you could send money and attach i think armor or weapons to send to others or your other characters. Its a good system. Even an auction house would be nice for items i don't sell at my own vendor. I wish players could buy stuff when i am offline. I wish they would cut back on things spawning so it would improve the games economy. I mean recipes and plans do not sell like they should because they are so easily found and not enough new players coming into the game. They need to make some changes.
---
My character was shocked to see a nearly naked Graham out on his own the other day.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/5OJNSAD](https://imgur.com/a/5OJNSAD)
---
Can you cite a source?  I could be wrong but I remembered reading the site when it was first announced, then again the day prior, and don’t remember seeing it there. 
---
If you can’t cite a source, no big deal. Could just be Mandela effect.
---
Doesn't the launcher have an option to create a shortcut?
---
I've been doing the glass caverns constantly farming scorched and Santas.   There are hundreds of Ultracite and each time you pick one more scorched spawn.  You can also fast travel out of the glass cavern to reset. 
---
I believe the glass cavern is the Scorchbeast's nest and they exit the nest through the fissures above.  That would explain their presence below and why they're flying around down there.   It's certainly glitchy in the early areas of the glassed cavern where the ceiling is low and you can catch glimpses of them and hear them fly by even though there's no room.
---
There is a compass on the strip below...
---
i just assume bethesda is focused on NW and wastelanders.. so it might take a while before it is fixed
---
Figured it was a cap sink from them to avoid max caps, like people do with serum recipes.
---
Everyone says shotguns are garbage after they got nerfed.  I didn't play until after the Nerf happened, but ran shotgun for about 60 levels.  It is still viable and kills most things quite easily, it's just not right for all situations but it is still powerful.  My bloodied combat shotgun did around 550 damage per shot.  With enforcer groups of level 68 ghouls go from being a deadly threat to a hilarious pile of crippled lumps on the floor.
---
I'd suggest having a few points in rifleman or commado as a side weapon for the times you don't want to be in an enemies face.  You are going to be getting in close to enemies.  Not exactly melee distance, but not to much farther away than that.  You can easily spec into melee or heavies as well with all of the strength points. I ended up getting bored with shotguns after a while and switched over to heavy weapons around level 100.  I can still switch back, or switch to melee at any time.
---
Can I buy a plasma grenade one off of you?
---
How much? I’ve seen that one going for a fair bit.
---
500 to 1000
---
I run an anti armor melee stealth build, using vanguard, ap refresh, better sneak armor, and an anti armor swing speed meathook.  Feel free to use it if you want.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4576e5&amp;d=aj2ar2a12am1ej4sf2ss2p53cu2i92i12l71lu2c72a72s52si2s92&amp;w=c13&amp;m=051c29fe8gh3&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
You have to buy the jumbos with fuzzy tokens.
---
Oh I was expecting Joshua Graham lol
---
What do you think about stealth commando then?
---
True , thanks for the information.
---
Dirty old bear can be found in the Burrows.
---
Fallout 1st membership perk might make this happen.  Pretty clear that you have to pay to hoard.  Being that it jams up server space its probably fair.
---
They probably don’t want people to use mule accounts. Kinda defeats the purpose of having limited storage.
---
Totally depends on Wastlanders success.
---
Is that you Artyom? It's me Uncle Bourbon!
---

---
I have to guess most levels were solo or just in a group so I can come back to my xb1 server after the hour time crash. 
---
I recently started playing and working with aa couple of chill dwellers and it has been amazing. Makes new Vegas feel a little less, and that game was amazing
---
Anyway as a older 30+ yo player it's harder to find core groups it seems, but I wish you the best on PC and I'm sure you can find some good people to roll with :)
---
Fo1st, biggest scam in fallout history.
---
THIS
---
You can also use the 5%xp food (mama Dolces' / Cranberry relish or pie),  however the 5% doesn't stack with other xp foods.
---
Number 2 is actually do to a few things. There are enemy spawn management systems in the game called EWS(Encounter wave system) and EMS(Entity management system) these both have a max budget that they can hit before they start killing nonessential creatures and only spawning scripted ones. This is almost always seen happening on public servers. Part of the problem is that meat piles, ash piles, and goo piles all count as part of that budget so when people don't clean up after themselves it eats away at it. Not to mention the vertibirds that get stuck at uhhh.. Point pleasant?
---
Yea I do great at the 10c per common and I’m sure Bethesda will implement them into the loot pool so I don’t expect them to gain much value. As for the plasma and other rare ones I think they will gain value again.
---
Well I was gonna give him my TSE Gauss Rifle for another 3 star legendary laser rifle and I told him to make it zero and I'll make mine zero. So he made his binoculars zero then he told me to make my TSE zero. So I stole it and I ran for the hills. FYI he kept his laser rifle.
---
Sure . The mask :)
---
That's why I ended up getting it. I don't quite buy 10 bucks a month worth of atoms.... But I've bought them intermittently.
---
Throw in some cosmetics, the scrap box and private world? Why not.
---
Oh, I know, but the value plummeted a couple days into the event as people started finding them.
---
400😳 sigh 😞
---
I'm pretty sure they removed the discount due to back lash, and ended up just giving the cosmetics like the ranger skin for free instead.
---
Which shack village are you talking about?  The flooded train yard?
---
Wait until you come across Mirelurk Kings and Assaultron Dominators. Level 213 and they scare the heck out of me still. It’s probably from being mauled so many times!
---
Why even be in this reddit if you're going to post crap like this?
---
That they do. 
---
Even, just a few workshops will produce a goodly number of em.
---
biffpipp I just do dumb shit and role play but it’s fun
---
I mean, even if there was video proof, it comes back to my point I made earlier about deleting things and then just taking pictures / video. I have no doubt I'm screwed though. It's just really sad and pathetic of them to have so many bugs EVERY patch.
---
Frontier is not doing that and you know it, so don't lie. In fact you are helping shit difamating a great company. Some out there might read your crap and believe it
---
Just because you don't have spacelegs it doesn't mean the game is left to die, spoiled brat.
---
Bah, I am done. Not worth talking to you, "cmdr"
---
Graham is something of a naturalist I think...
---
[https://imgur.com/a/JUqZe1z](https://imgur.com/a/JUqZe1z)
---
Assualtrons are nasty. The way the walk too...scary stuff!
---
With the hackers roaming around, it can get tough these days...
---
biffpipp
---
Nothing more fun than a assaultron dominator fight the first time .. it was 4 times my level.. I thought for a minute I was winning.. lol.. then it stared me straight in the face and showed me what a loser I was 🙂
---
Capture every workstation.  Place a Santa tron at every workshop.  
---
Otherwise the Glass Caverns method looks good.  There are farming routes you can find on this sub or YouTube.
---
The storage is a limitation on item tracking to keep the servers stable, not a gameplay balance decision.
---
Recently there was a hacker going about stealing everyone's inventory on PC so maybe that's what happened but he could only do that when you're in the game so I don't know
---
I would recommend staying away from 76 until Bethesda says it's safe to play the game
---
Absolute bullshit this stuff happens and Bethesda says nothing
---
Ngl though, this makes me feel better. I felt all kinds of wrong last night not being able to figure anything out. It’s clearly meant to fuck with a person’s psyche.
---
Stealth commando wrecks ass lol.  Even though I'm speced into strength, I use rifles on the side even though I cant equip all the perk cards for it. Early on I used semi auto but switched to command once ammo wasn't an issue for me anymore.  That was kind of pointless though because just tapping the trigger quickly on a auto usually let's you squeeze out single shots on most guns.
---
Even though it's my "side" weapon...im using it 90 percent of the time lol.  Sneak shots with a bloodied handmade and a bloodied faster fire combat rifle get me 500 and up damage a shot.  Absolutely destroys enemies.  I do recommend.
---
"I hope it kills a lot of bugs"
---
I'd be surprised if it fixes more bugs than it adds. The game has been hella buggy for even Bethesda's standards from the very start.
---
Shrouded wood armor, even though it says it helps with sneak, actually does nothing other than boost your sneak movement speed.
---
Text chat is one of the QoL improvements coming at the beginning of next year
---
Ive experienced it no less than 3 times on PS4. Stopped running Glassed Caverns to farm Scorched bc it was incredibly annoying
---
Thanks!! Actually never tried just launching the exe lol
---
There's a few similar food buffs that do stack with each other (see  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food)). All the +X% melee damage ones do, giving you up to +75% melee damage. Then you can add another Stat bonus food buff to this (eg. +3 STR from deathclaw wellington, or +2 STR from deathclaw steak) to give even more damage.
---
Any other food that gives a Stat bonus only stacks if the Stat(s) being boosted are not *all* the same:- 
---
Apalachilli (+2 LCK) and charred scorchbeast liver (+3 LCK) **won't stack**
---
Scorchbeast mixed stew (+1L +1E +1I +1A) and charred scorchbeast liver (+3 LCK) **will stack**
---
Mind sending me the build?
---
They have logs for everything so they will be able to find out based on your player ID when this happened
---
Man some of you guys are really better off playing a Sims game for crying out loud
---
I never got that screenshot you were going to send me of that mount. I'll assume you were mistaken until proven otherwise?
---
It wasn't just one event it was all ash heap events.
---
Did you log-in without your lost items, or did you lose them after logging-in?
---
Hopefully it was the former because if it was the latter, it could mean that a new inventory hack exists.
---
If it was the former and you are positive that you didn't lose your items before the inventory hack was patched, it might have nothing to do with the inventory hack.
---
Still, I would submit a ticket to Bethesda and keep trying to make them at least do a rollback to your character. Someone has been able to get their stuff back this way despite Bethesda's claim that they cannot restore a player's lost items.
---
3000?
---
Tell me this again, when fdev do something other than postponing updates they claim are coming despite even a bit of proof.
---
If that's the case why can my no sneak perk character with full shrouded waltz inches by enemies and not even get detected in the slightest. Shrouded also is super lightweight and weight also plays a key part in sneaking mechanics.
---
This tends to happen if you get hit in the middle of the game checking your effects, perks, armor, and weapons as it doesn't see that you have fireproof right then
---
So? Any proof? 👀
---
I can show you the proof from the data files but I believe I've actually posted on it before. The lightweight part is probably what's helping and not the nonexistent sneak bonus
---
I could have sworn it was in Grahm's list of plans for sale?

 Bloodied's run around one shoting everything, and dying to mole rats. ;)

Nice! This is exactly why we need a mode where we can build whatever we want without limits.
---
On a 2nd note, is there a data mined list for wastelanders?
---
How about 4k?
---
Lmfao bugthesda still scamming people with this old trick
---
Once I get my plat I'm out
---
I swear I’ve seen liberators drop it.
---
Heh, if you're on PC, share your IGN and I'll add you.  I can help gear you up with some crafted gear, and get you to some places that are solid spots for incoming Vault-Dwellers.
---
Deal! You on now? GT: Rocky Two Milli
---
Hey I'd like to help some people out too, I'm just level 124 but we should totally make a "coalition of helpful wastelanders" who act as responders but are wayyy better at not dying. My GT is ChronoCowboy if you wanna add me too!
---
I do, I still have a 0.00001% hope I'll get the Keg plan
---
Mmm no its SW of big bend and SE of the train station. That megasloth spawn is on the way to it.
---
There's a couple of bears you listed that spawn in two children's graves, but I've never been able to bring myself to steal from those.
---
I bought it today from Graham, actually.
---
Yeah I got scammed using my free in-game obtainable atoms.......
---
Just saw Angry Turtles videos and it's more than likely just a bug since almost all shadowed armor appears to be broken; stealth has been a mess for months anyways. Only one that even functions is leather and that's definitely not intended.
---
I don't take the ones at power plants, too much hassle finding all the enemies.
---
I made a 4x4 concrete foundation building and placed the mat inside so when you ft to the workshop you're spawned on it.  Because the Santa-tron is in the building he never leaves it so doesn't aggro any enemies. Unless the building has been destroyed, usually by super mutants, I don't even worry about defends or retakes. Just ft, empty the container then onto next workshop.
---
I ended up just doing a complete loop over and over, by the time you've finished one loop there's usually another one or two presents in the container when you come back round, not always though.
---
Wendigo does not come from gifts it's a quest that starts from a paper on table in front of Southern bell motel
---
Had a Workshop Defense Event, it was literally back-to-back waves of Cave Crickets, four waves of ten max-level crickets each.  The end of it had me with one of auto-fire weapons at broken, and my annoyance was abated only by the vast excess of waste acid I picked up...
---
And you posted it on Reddit instead of helping him? The audacity. This is what's wrong with the world today.
---
Sure, messing up their video game... if that's all it was then yes they'd be silly. Except it isnt. It's called... You know, cyber theft. Consider this, the ones calling for arrest likely had things of monetary value stolen. Aka atomic shop items they spent real world currency to buy. Items that are, otherwise, not tradable, stealable, etc.
---
Were they foolish to buy them in the first place? Yup. Bethesda has had so many chances to own up and fix this steaming garbage pile but has failed time an time again.
---
But it was still stolen, which is a crime, just like how selling the weapons on eBay is a crime considering copyright and all that.
---
YouTube screw assulatron guide
---
They could be somewhat effective if it wasn't for the bug that sometimes heals targets back if you use a weapon that shoots multiple projectiles.
---
Their ridiculous damage dropoff and very short effective range also limit their potential.
---
I believe the maximum damage dropoff for shotguns is 90% while every other weapon has a maximum damage dropoff of 50%.
---
Still, they are very effective at crippling targets and forcing Scorchbeasts to land with the Enforcer perk card.
---
IIRC they drop electrified chineese officer sword plan.
---
Oh yeah PS4 does it a LOT.
---
There was a Nuka Cola fridge that was datamined and showed off months ago; I'm just waiting for that bad boy to come out. More than likely they will be dropping it with Wastelanders.
---
I am, but I think I’ve crashed, give me 5 mins to get back in and I’m currently over encumbered. I’ve got more of the common plans if you’re on aswell.
---
Bait and switch
---
I smell a lawsuit coming
---
I very well could be! Just send me an inv whenever. I’m online
---
Just because there is a model doesn't mean that it will be a container or work the way its being described here.
---
I can see it now, all the items lost in the mail due to Bethesda's incompetence.
---
Underarmor used to give benefits while in Power Armor a while ago, but not anymore.
---
Well, I haven't logged in to adventure mode for a couple months. Logged in and they were all gone. 
---
I'll submit a ticket, but I doubt anything comes of it. I'll just uninstall and skip buying any of their products from now on if they don't do anything though
---
On Dec 26th when I opened some of the gifts I *had farmed* from the scorched a few days before, none of these gave me a reward. This was when Bethesda made a mistake (there are plenty of posts on this sub complaining about this) and closed the Holiday Event prematurely.
---
This is why I would not assume anything unless Bethesda confirms it.
---
Pretty sure it's a hard cap
---
yes. The deathclaw should be the toughest thing in the wasteland other than maybe scorchbeasts, and even then SB's should just be flying deathclaws. They're so rare, it doesn't make any sense that they would be so weak. I think I've ran into 4-5 since I started playing, and they don't even get close enough to hit me before they're dead.
---
Serums you can make your money back. Buying a plan and selling for less is just dumb hah
---
Wow... Okay, that's pretty interesting. You can tell if it is a workshop budget you gliched into when you can put up 20 turrets versus 10 from camp.
---
Will have to see, I'd love to get an increased budget. At 100%, so m not laggy at all, course I spend most of my time in a private server.
---
Is this PC or on console?
---
Might be free but fallout 76 and bugthesda are still a massive joke
---
I hope bgs and fallout fall to pieces
---
What a helpful comment and insightful opinion someone get this man a gold!
---
Unyielding and bloody breaks the game, it will probably get changed with the upcoming Wastelanders and the fact that you can stack 30+ special stats on everything which will break the balance of everything they add. No one set should dominate everything and right now it dominates in nearly everything; at least junkies is balanced.
---
Exactly - it’s ridiculous, like i said, Creatures smaller   such as Yao Gaui’s and Cave Cricket’sare even tougher. It doesn’t make sense. But the regular spawns for DeathClaws are Hopwell cave, near the the Fissure Site and DeathClaw Island. 
---
The same goes with Grafton Monster’s, they are absolutely huge and scary, but yet so weak! :)
---
Did it patch it?
---
If you're being sarcastic at least put the / S
---
I do find it hilarious that the fallout 76 reddit is full of hate and anger towards bgs for their shit management of fallout 76 yet I'm downvoted for pointing out that bgs is using the same old limited time trick to make people spend money on a broken ass game that doesn't work and allows everyone to steal other people's earned shit.
---
Sounds good! I'm also on pacific time. Not sure if I'll be on tonight, but I'll definitely be on tomorrow while watching football on another screen 😂
---
GT is the same as my reddit name, so just shoot me a message or send me a party invite if you catch me online.
---
Will we see the return of board duping? Will scrapping legendaries once again become a major issue? Will more weapons and armor lose their legendary attach points? Is limb damage going to become the only available secondary effect again? Only time will tell!
---
Grahm sells it randomly
---
In NV, deathclaws were fearsome. Good times.
---
Time isn't free though. If you get atoms while playing the game, it's one thing, but if you spend half an hour server hopping to find a stupid megasloth in the cranberry bog, that's just wasted time. You're better off mowing your neighbor's lawn for $10 and buying atoms instead of doing challenges like that
---
Bad YouTubers are not reporters and what they do doesn’t really qualify as journalism. Flattening all of the media into one thing and using YouTubers as an example is not a sound basis for media criticism.
---
yeah everyone was complaining about Bethesda adding repair kits and scrap kits and making the game pay to win but the game gives you free atoms I bought those kits for free just from the game giving me them
---
If you have a mouse, keyboard, or gamepad that supports macros, you can set-up a macro that does just that.
---
I use a steam controller, which is highly modifiable, and I can switch perk loadouts with the PLM mod by simply pressing the right track pad at specific places.
---
Are you at or close to your scrip limit fo r the day?
---
Then why are you here? If they and the game upset you that much just walk the hell away from it and quit dwelling on it. Fucking christ. Some of you people aren't happy unless you have something to complain about.
---
Yea , now that I heard that the weapon can heal, i will probably change to commando
---
Might be a while until I can check it but I should be able to show you what I have. There are better builds out there, you handicap yourself a little when you try and spec for more than one weapon type like I have. Not to mention that without the good legendary rolls my character has you won't be able to hit those same types of numbers. You'll either need to get lucky drops or find someone selling similar gear.
---
 If you still want to take a look though I will post it later .
---
The fundamental problem with the 76 Deathclaw is that it's *purely* melee.  They got rid of its throw attacks from Fallout 4.  This means that it *must* commute to your position in order to hurt you, and well, there are all kinds of ways you can game its AI that once you get Marsupial.  The smallest obstruction will cause a Deathclaw to pause and re-evaluate its pathing, and it's not going to live long enough to be a problem.
---
It also lacks its instant kill attacks from 4, which are what make 76's Yao Guai a force to be reckoned with, even when they technically have the same issue.
---
Then go mow you're fucking neighbors lawn and guit bitching
---
Does it have to be bloodied or can only commando also work?
---
XB1 here . Love too help out if I can. My shop is south of Helvetica. 
---
Lvl 96 with pa skills and such. Just started about 6 weeks ago and had a hard learning curve as well. Play daily, mainly afternoin evening. Ontario canada time  zone lol (est)
---
Add me if u like 👍
---
Yup - I remember first beginning the game, and trying to get near the strip. Must of died 40 times by the patrolling DeathClaws near the Quarry and the Railway Line. Loved that game.
---
ive yet to hear of one.. may be a thing later on if the game gains more traction, and bethesda can both fix more issues, and lure in a larger player base
---
Hanpbergr
---
I agree. Its bad when i actively try to avoid a yao gui but if i see a Deathclaw i go "meh i guess some black titanium is worth the detour" then proceed to one shot it like a rad Roach.
---
Wow, first time i have seen someone saying they are a FO 1st member, wonder how many they do sell each month?
---
On the other hand I did use nukes and dragons perk planner, like someone else suggested, for all of my builds to see the minimum and maximum special points to use all of the relevant perks for my build. This way it minimizes the time and level ups moving points later on.
---
Central European, Eastern, Western, what are we looking at? :P
---
You couldn't outrun them or out jump them and you better make sure your anti material rifle was making head shots with armor piercing rounds.
---
Yes very true, although your Character’s Hit Box is so large, even 20 Feet in the air you still get hit. Which is annoying. But i agree with you there, interesting points.
---
Lmfao you're the one getting upset and uptight.
---
I'm here because I can be, if you don't like it tough shit get over it.
---
I'm pointing out that bgs are a shit company and that because they still use shitty practices they deserve to fall apart.
---
Oh and I can assure you I won't be purchasing from bgs after this shit show
---
Take your own advice and chill the fuck out, you come across as a fanboy with a rod up his arse.
---
I object! I think we do. Things like this are perfect for this community!
---
Was hoping for some hal.dll in there, usually drivers etc.
---
Checked temps?
---
I'm talking about buying extra serum recipes not to learn them, but exclusively resell them. Again; it's a cap sink. Way to avoid max caps and get them back at about a 20% loss at a later date.
---
Behold his glorious soap box. No one is forcing him to play this game but by god please listen.
---
This is what happened. There is an exclusive tab but the things have been free so far and a very long window to claim it like 25 days or something.
---
That’s funny, Yao Gaui’s are so tough compared to DeathClaws. But that is a very relatable point. They should drop more Scrap Items too, they only drop Black Titanium, which isn’t very useful to a high Level player.
---
I'll just assume you're just another fanboy upset because how dare I criticize bgs
---
Lol fanboy..... I guess I am since nothing about this game makes me wish it to fail like you do. 
---
You are correct, you have a right to be on this forum and I have the right to say you're a piece of shit. 
---
No matter what you reply I will still enjoy the game. 
---
Doesn't matter if you report me and i get banned I'll just make another account and keep giving you shit.
---
Yes! Fully Modified too, purchased from the Gun-Runner’s...Awesome weapon. That should return into Fallout 76!
---
In his video he talk about how he uses a glitch to get a bigger camp budget
---
the saying "Scrap and Store" goes a long way my friend.
---
I haven't completed my VATS commando build yet, but I plan to have a full set of unyielding armor with at least 2 pieces that grant +1 luck while wearing a shielded vault suit, which grants +2 luck.
---
With 15 skill points in luck, you can reach 34 luck with this armor set.
---
If you have 34 luck (I believe), you can deal crits every other shot with VATS.
---
Oh, it was terrible, I had a lot of bulk scrap. Good for the guy who stole it though.
---
Dang, that's a shitty thing of them to do.. you on PC at all? I'll happily part with 600 scrap metal if you want it.
---
Sent an inv
---
Truth! I give away most plans until im down to 1 extra and sell about 4-6 of em for 1000-3000 or somethin, no need to be (too) greedy..

Lmfao your reply tells me everything I need to about what kind of person you are and ironically you're a bigger piece of shit than what i supposedly am.

---
Take a chill pill before your heart gives out, or better yet keep going so you can finish yourself off

Immature kid 🤣🤣

This and you get to keep the looted ultracite ore which is used for crafting ultracite armor and ultracite ammo.
---
Pacifist mode
---
Awesome build bro! I have a similar build for my FOB, although budget is always the limiting factor. 
---
Unless you're able to share of course... 😉
---
People act like text chat is to be feared for some reason. I'd love to see this feature and it'd bring some life into the game.
---
I'm on PS4. It's alright, I just take it as a lesson. Thank you though.
---
id say trade the stagger strength from the Yao Guai to the death claw, and give them their "one hit kill" attack they have from fallout 4 only way to survive it is to have a lot of damage resist or be in power armor. or in a team have your ally kill it before it has your skull for a snack
---
I think I should put that on, because I doubt I'll be attacking anyone, personally.
---
It is really that easy
---
Obviously this is just my opinion, but I struggled with being a melee build unless I had PA, and I wasn’t thrilled with having to gather fusion cores.
---
I’m currently a non-PA stealth rifle build, and am very happy with that. In addition the Rifleman perk cards, I have rnk2 Tank Killer.  My main guns are a TS Lever, TSE handmade, and an I FFR Fixer.  The Fixer can 1-shot most enemies (hits for about 600 damage with stealth multipliers).  The Lever can  2-3 shot most big enemies like deathclaws.  And the handmade is just for crowd control if I become non-hidden.  The only creatures that give me problems are the mirelurk queen and kings... 
---
For SBQ fights I will swap out some cards to become a heavy gunner build, and have a Furious primed LMG for that.
---
I satisfy hunger with dog food, since there’s a perk card for it that only takes up 1 point.  If I need any boosts, I just just a magazine or bobblehead since their weights were recently reduced and I can horde them. I’m not a fan of crafting special food or drinks, due to food spoilage and drink weights.
---
I hope this insight into my build helps.
---
I’m kinda in the same boat, but I’m not a vet. In my younger life I was in law enforcement and did a stint as a military security subcontractor overseas. I was also a volunteer firefighter/paramedic. This was from 1986-2014. Time caught up with me along with being shot several times. In 2018 I was diagnosed with 4 ruptured disks between L4-S1, PTSD, IED, and chronic anxiety disorder. That sealed the deal as far as disability. So I’ve been on FO76 almost every day since BETA. The level 800 guy I was talking to, along with the replies here, confirm what I’ve noticed. It’s a lot easier to deal with real people in the virtual world than at say, a WalMart or grocery store.
---
My computer isn’t even supposed to be able to play it I had to make it look like shit ( thanks low spec gamer) and it never crashes just 20 FPS max

Will you sit on my face!

No it doesnt

Easy solution for addressing the fast travel mat abuse is to grant temporary invoulnerability to traps and fall damage.
---
Unlikely, they never provided steam keys for ESO.

Can't wait for the people who said they'd never buy 1st to begin with suddenly be up in arms over this and demand it be rectified.

I gave you an upvote without reading the body of your post. Now that I’ve read it, I wish I could give you another!

But he says the first part isn't using the workshop budget

oddly enough, I have better success farming when i start at the END of the cavern and work my way back to the entrance!

You have like 5 minutes to get back to the same server. I was doing it earlier and accidentally joined a public server with my alt. I logged out right away and and logged back in on private and stuff was still there. 🤦‍♂️

I have a similar build for my FOB, but budget is always a limiting factor.

Just need to know how to increase budget if you're willing to share? 😉
---
You must be a low intellect. That is a form of wishing harm or death upon someone.
---
they must be freshly picked, cleansed with radiation, unsullied by human fingers.. with their blood and hair all over the covers. 
---
&gt;!no, it does not!&lt;
---
It's a game of hopscotch at this point.
---
Platform?
---
It doesn't HAVE to be. Other effects would work as well. I sometimes run with a vampires handmade for silos, and I've used furious and executioner's handmade for this character as well.  The 500 plus damage I was talking about though is only possible because of the bloodied since my character cannot equip all of the commando perks with only 9 perception.
---
Thanks for the confirmation.
---
Xbox..
---
Thank you...
---
Thanks.
---
Its Bethesda, what'd you expect?
---
Oh cool. If you still need your fixer modded I can help. I know almost every mod
---
This is what you deserve for feeding into Fallout 1st. All of you for that matter.
---
Good looking base set up, can't wait to see how to double my camp budget, that would be amazing.
---
Thus is what i sell a majority of my plans for currently. With the exception of the mines, grenades, icicles, and Santa crash.
---
500 for mounted heads seems fair. Seen the moth man sell for 10k a few days ago and was amazed. As the night before I had sold 3 for 500 each.
---
I'm mainly interested in making it automatic for a faster fire rate and bigger DPS
---
I have one of the mines, but I can't actually craft it (doesn't even appear in the menu). Anyone else have this issue?
---
Yep, and they also drop Plan: Bladed Commie Whacker. But not the sword plan itself, apparently.
---
You just  want an automatic receiver?
---
I never thought mere ammo would be selling on there!  Thanks for the tip :) :)
---
No, you are correct.
---
Besides, even if it was after, they ended up giving the item they were going to discount to members for free.  People would basically be complaining they got an item for free instead of for a discount.
---
WASTE OF MONEY LMAO
---
It shows as a tweaked automatic receiver.. yes.. indont have the perks...
---
If possible , send it to me . I will ask a friend to adapt it for one weapon type.
---
Join my game and ill fully mod it for you. Gt:CallMeCamer0n

The amount of negative reviews on fo76 in steam is gonna be massive, cant wait to see that

---
Yup total POS. He’s that “Hey, look at me...ain’t I awesome?” Kind of guy. Steals other streamers ideas and claims them as his own.
---
What's your gt?
---
Oh that sounds awesome! I was pretty bummed that the nuka cola machine camp item didn't make "ice cold" nuka colas or just freaking do SOMETHING. lol
---
Funny thing is I know of build limit glitch just haven't done it yet.
---
Yea I found three of these guys not to long ago and made my screenshot with one probably a month ago now. Was a group of three but I singled out one to get a good pic with but I guess I cant post my pic that's a shame but was in the woods close to someone's camp.
---
Available
---
So many peeps have said already, but yeah...  Pacifist mode should be on at all times unless you intend on PVP.
---
Never accept unasked for Trade requests.  It's ALWAYS someone trying to scope you out for either things to steal or to see if you're specced for PVP in preparation for an ambush through exploits.
---
Never accept unasked for team invites, because they are looking to exploit you into PVP.  
---
Scrap and store, is the mantra of the Wasteland.  This is the Way.
---
Fallout 76 is the biggest scam in fallout history. 
---
Every month there’s some new controversial bs.
---
I really hope Bethesda has learned their lesson after this.
---
Sweet, that sounds cool! It’s fun to play around with new, and less powerful weapons to see how they turn out. But yes, SheepSquach’s are very tough.
---
Ehhh, they passed that point long ago.
---
I guess it'd be a step in the right direction, but it's like trying to walk up the down escalator. They need to either stop it first or start taking a lot of steps really fast.
---
If you got it from the atom shop you should be able to use them on both characters, providing they are on the same account
---
I really want the hero of the wasteland statue. It hasn’t returned in a long time though.
---
thanks, im german, i edited it
---
Gutan tag! Hallo!
---
I still have hope they can pull off an online game, but make it small scale online, as in "make the normal singleplayer game, but also make it borderlands-style multiplayer".
---
It’s most likely this. 
---
And Bethesda has no way to restore them. There was an article about it a few days ago.
---
That's pretty cheap.
---
&gt;i have made a second account
---
To be fair that was mostly due to wonky design/balancing and combat generally sucking in 3/NV.  Deathclaw attacks were so absurd they pretty much ignored your armor, and combat isn't as fluid as it is in 4/76 where you can sprint, dodge, and all that where in the older games you were helpless to try to run away or maneuver around their hits.
---
Ahhh, in that case,  I understand your pain.
---
I am PC and also ever clever— allthehardknox— I appreciate the help and the kindness, friend.
---
None of your f\*(king business.
---
Nope, bethesda shouldnt waste more time on this shit and just focus on next releases

There it is.  I saw a post earlier that tenderizer is broken and does not work, haven't tested it myself. Assuming that is true I will be ditching that card and moving a point to either intelligence or perception.  On mobile so hopefully the URL posts correctly.
---
I don’t think anybody buys serum recipes to resell at a loss. That’s not what a cap sink is. That’s throwing caps away.

Thank you so much.. for modding it for me and for not taking the weapon for yourself!

Thank you for offering to help. All modded now...

I was on every day for many hours since BETA... until my mental issues and malnourishment put me in a bad place, and I had to put my computer in storage for 3 months. When it arrived to my new abode, UPS had THRASHED the FUK out of it and I had to rebuild it on the spot ... now it works but I can't hear anyone speaking, I can't use chat, and it crashes when I fight the SBQ. :(  
---
oh well.
---
I should probably know this by now , but what's the script limit? Lol
---
Sometimes you have to throw caps away because you're nearing Max. That's the quickest and easiest method
---
Add me, my IGN is Coxinga.

Pristine spawns at the Charleston station inside on one of the benches (the one with a tin can on it).

Text chat ranks up there with ammo scrapping as one of the most requested features, I think.  I think text chat may actually be on the way...
---
Oh?
---
The more you learn.
---
I always wondered why so many people I talk to get the clipping SBs and I never got one.
---
Guess setimes laziness does pay off. XD
---
Best choice. I always have it on, othereise you just get jacked the moment you clip someone during SBQ, One Violent Night, etc. With survival mode gone everybody's itching to tear somebody up.
---
I've wanted to share a photo I took of the first time I killed the mothman but I can't figure out how to post photos to the fo76 subreddit, and I think it would be an awesome addition as your coloring pages
---
Ah too bad, EU here
---
The Ballistic Bock and High-Voltage Hefe always sell if there is a SBQ event starting up or underway. The damage boosts are useful.
---
I tried to do it off memory and something is slightly wrong. I actually have 4 ranks of adrenaline so there is one less point on some card somewhere. Not sure which one but that's still the gist of my build, close enough to give you an idea.
---
I'm level 370-something and run a strict shotgun build. I might be the last one in Appalachia who does so but whatever, it works for me and my play style.

I can one shot the max level ghouls at Whitespring no problem, West Tek super mutants not so much (more like two or three). I use an Instigating Explosive combat shotgun to one shot turrets in the nuke silo and a Suppressors Explosive combat shotgun on particularly obnoxious mobs that can't be one shot. My all-around daily carry is a Bloodied combat shotgun with damage resistance and another star I forget, it can take out a lvl 80 Scorchbeast on the ground in 5 or 6 shots putting out close to 600 dmg with lvl 1 Adrenaline (don't waste points above that, not worth it).
---
Stealth though? No idea, that's not my style. Since shotguns require close quarters, I just run in guns blazing.
---
I also carry a Quad Explosive handmade for ranged attacks since shotguns are shit for distance and use various 50 cals for the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
I'd be happy to share my build with you when I get on later if you'd like. Off the top of my head I have 15 strength, low perception, 8 agility and run the usual: all the shotgun perks (Scattershot, 2 each of the Shotgunner cards), Radicool, Enforcer, Evasive, Serendipity. I don't use concentrated fire, no need for it since I don't use VATS much. Armor is 4 unyielding pieces and one bolstering. Blocker also helps since you're fighting so close up with shotties.
---
Everyone will say they suck but having played from day one and through the numerous nerfs, they're still my favorite. Back in the day my two shot explosive double barrel could output 1600 a shot but whatever, it also killed me half the time every time I pulled it out.
---
Yes! That’s a good point, the stagger you get hit with by the Melee attack from the Yao Guai, should be implemented onto the DeathClaw, or yes, like the one-hit kill animation, I agree.
---
I’ll be happy to provide you junk. Just let me know what you lost. PSN is dixiemomma1577
---
Watch out on those team invites especially now with Santatron, I recently realized I can swipe my teammates holiday gifts........prob late on this but it's a thing.
---
Nobody does that. You buy serums to craft them and slowly make back your money, not to resell for a loss.
---
Not an idiot. It took me a LONG time to realize that too!
---
Always looking to pass off junk. Im on PS4. Crimbotxx HMU anytime.
---
Thx man :-)
---
Probably a lot. I see survival tents and people with scrap boxes in their CAMPs everywhere. I suspect that most people who play get it, and most people who don't play complain about it.
---
That used to be an old trick early in the game prior to player vending 
---
Someone initiates a trade to check out what you have to see if it’s an easy gank opportunity.  Then they smack you to set off electrically charged and boom you are dead and so is your loot.  That’s why I always scrap it and don’t carry a lot around and for gods sake people don’t shoot back.
---
I play on Xbox, but on twitch I see Pc fallout 76 streamers and they are mostly playing on their private servers...just to not risk it!
---
That's really great to hear! Do you have discord by any chance?
---
Need info on the glitch you used ahaha.
---
Are you on the right character and you checked your stash? Otherwise, check your email for a message from Bethesda (they did wipe inventories in some unban waves). I don't know what else it could be besides that.
---
I just dump the common ones in suitcases - sick of the sight of them.
---
Thank you for your help! I will ask my friends to help me further.
---
No problem. Good luck!
---
Paadomo is mine, but I don't need replacements, just kinda pissed me off. Thanks you though.
---
Vendor only has 150 to offer per day, players max out at 1000. The vendors really need a bigger budget, been signing in just to sell a couple of legendary items once a day to free up the space.
---
People absolutely do. Hang around on trading communities and you will see players selling serum recipes second hand. I'll admit I'm assuming their intent, but why else would they buy and resell them?
---
Recipes don't weigh as much as 5.56 and you don't need another willing player to buy them from.
---
Remember a 20% loss is a lot cheaper than a 100% loss because you're at max caps.
---
You have been duped.lol.
---
Bro why would you fall for that scheme?
---
Not all heroes wear capes, sometimes they wear ghillie suits and hide in bushes 😜
---
NV was the first fallout in I played and whenever I saw a deathclaw I ran. I died at that quarry more than I like to admit.
---
cheers m8, i didnt know this...
---
THANK YOU! I'll be hopping on just to buy that today
---
I am level 150 and I run the exact same thing almost. I run an instigating explosive double barrel 25% less vats and can one shot almost any common mob just like you. The supers at west tek take two  SOMETIMES. I vats every shot normally aiming at the face. Normally I'm crouched too so the 2x sneak hits and even the mutants die in the first shot.
---
I don’t do it often but when I do I seem to get the same plans
---
I'm in the same boat and thinking of doing the same thing.  My CAMP is kinda big,  but I've seen much larger and don't get it either.  Good luck to you!
---
Special sale runs until Dec 31. Trade in your junky legendaries for her scrip, then get random 3-stars for 60 scrip each.
---
Are you on PC by chance? I may just have one in my stash.  Not 100 percent sure but I did at one point, unless it was in my vendor and already sold.
---
Turrets take up a TON of camp budget and anything other than animals will just stay back and shoot them.  I only use 1 missile turret to cover my door. Crops and billboards take up a lot too. Flooring uses less camp space than roofing (about half) so use flooring for your roof.
---
It probably would have been a quicker and more enjoyable experience if you actually tried to win. If you're on Xbox I can help show you how fun it is.
---
B0neBroth1 I have some shit for you! I'll be on tonight.
---
I finished second place almost every match. I had fun.
---
Why?  If it’s for transferring stuff just use a suitcase at a station. You get 5 to 10 minutes to get back to the same server
---
Just transferred all my level 100 and level 60 stuff over to my level 120
---
If you need anything please let me know. Sorry they were total buttheads!
---
I think there is still some weird shit out there ( PC ). I have a private world but sometimes I want to look for plans at player vendors - there is a strange vibe on adventure - not that many people.
---
Or, alternatively, stop parking Adventure mode rewards behind NW achievements.
---
If BGS were to do that, I (and many other bush hiders) wouldn’t frequent the BR mode any more.
---
I just recent found this too when I was 22, which is veered than being all messed up at 50, but still I had to start over. I figured it would be faster to get to level 22 again than to fix 22 levels of mostly bad choices.
---
I would like to build a shooting range at my camp like I did in Fallout 4 with the Nuka world items
---
Check out the HOA! They have some funny stuff!
---
They are supposedly working it. The points will stay in the same categories but you will be able to have presets
---
Plague Doctor mask is my single favorite atom store purchase.
---
I hope they do an entire outfit around it.
---
I honesty have no idea what they go for 2k?
---
What?  400 atoms is only like 4 months of play time...
---
Certain mutations can trigger a hit back for starting PvP.
---
 I use the suitcase in the bus by the Vault. Never failed me since I got F1 a couple of days after it came out.
---
Oh really?  Man I'm going to have to hunt that down next time I play!  Thanks!!
---
Yes, we need deathclaw hordes for a start. I'm way more scared of bears or mirelurk king and crickets than deathclaws.
---
You could wear it and the silver shroud / white lab coat white fedora for a spy vs spy look.
---
Big Budget Bucket List
---
* Turrets, resources like the Brahman pen and extractors
---
* Everything powered like lights and electric letters
---
* Foundations and walls 
---
* Roofs &gt; upper floors
---
* Electrical conduits &gt; wired connectors
---
That would be a cool perk (or mutation) That enlarges your feet and makes you able to wear them.
---
It also pairs well with the vampire halloween outfit and the civil war tophat.  Also liked it with the preacher's outfit.
---
How did you get your walls to not snap at 90 degree angle?
---
As much as I like 76.....
---
Deathclaws are such pansies in it .....
---
At night, when a deathclaw goes to sleep it checks under the bed for vault dwellers...
---
Bethesda got no shame.
---
And a baby dick.
---
Nah, I'm on ps4. Thanks though.
---
Haha, that’s funny ;)
---
There's definitely interest in leaning how you increased your budget. 
---
After finishing my trophy room, I don't have budget to decorate my cabin or plant crops. Help a brother out!
---
Game changer!!!
---
This does not make any sense. Buying 5.56 and using it as alternative currency is one thing. Paying caps for a serum recipe and selling to someone for less caps makes zero sense.
---
Yes, i agree, that would be great. They were so tough in other Fallout games, yet so weak in this! :)
---
But can you wear it
---
I miss when workshops were useful
---
I hide my First scrap box in CAMP so no one knows I have First. My month sub was an xmas gift I wont let waste. Totally don't respect players running to cozy safe sandboxes like that. Going to cheese out the scrap space and let it expire.  Having First gives you massive advantages to normal players. Public mode might be scary but it's shitloads more fun and the people earn shit the hard way.
---
 I don't think the lawn mowing guy is being disrespectful not like that previous dude who invests a ton of time to whine about shit that shouldn't affect him if he doesn't play the fking game.
---
thanks.....no more cycling through endless 55.6
---
Fake news story by and large. As a non-1st customer I'm quite happy to see those 1st tents around the Prime Fissure. Would have liked to have access to Private servers when the PC hacking took place but otherwise it is kind of non-issue. The unlimited scrap stash box did significantly disrupt the game's economy though.
---
Can't pick up envelope at Uncanny Caverns.bugged?
---
Works very well. I've only been taking 6 workshops at once over a few two hour play sessions.  Opened 150 gifts 3 days ago. I have about 130 again today. Still farm scorched in between retake events, so it's not all from the workshops but it definitely adds a lot of gifts.
---
Late to the party on this so to speak, but I might have some weapon's and other items you could be able to have if you want, Feel free to let me know if you have something specific in mind that you need.
---
Haven't heard of any inventory thefts since they supposedly fixed it, but nobody is going to guarantee that nothing bad will happen to you, so play at your own risk 🤞
---
People would be boosting for sure if downs gave xp. It's extremely easy to get in a game with friends. I got in a game with 10 other friends before and we ran in a pack lol.
---
Exactly this. I have little to no interest in playing NW. But I wanted that Charlie Brown Xmas tree to display outside my camp. So I hid in a bush, and always finished top 10, unless an animal or ghoul attacked me, that would give away my hiding. Sometimes I made it to top 2 or 3.
---
I actually have more trouble with them in this game than i did in nv i mean i used to hunt them with a bb gun
---
Yeah - once you are picking up those ultracite nodes for awhile the SBs start getting buggy. One flew down the cave to fight me at that sunken section with all the water. Others flying through walls dive bombing me with the green stuff etc. Often a number of them not including the stationary one.
---
Exactly. I fkn hate NW yet they hide these items in the mode and essentially ask you to play NW for 20+ hours to get them. Nobody wants to grind NW esp with the awful xp it gives. Reward me for playing the game not hiding while i fold clothes.
---
Well there is more of crickets and they have acid attack deathclaws usualy arent found in packs in 76 for some reason though i do agree with grafton monster
---
Also wasn't there exclusive content for fallout 1st members in the atom store? U guys just got the NCR outfit and a couple dances. Anything else since then?
---
Same. Usually at least got to top ten rank, 2nd a couple times. Just wanted that tree. Fellow bush hider here.
---
I know how to transfer items. I want all my camps to load in one map.
---
They nerfed the useful extractors months ago
---
The coalition idea is good, I'm in
---
Yep that sucks!  I know you already turned it down, but if you change your mind and want some scrap send me a message.
---
never seen the jumbo versions Or kobold.
---
Pristine And souvenir are just kinda random.
---
sometimes see them in train stations
---
I Personally found my Pristine Teddy Bear from Charleston Station, sitting on one of the benches inside the station I believe. Most other Teddy bear's (Not Mr Fuzzy's) I've found at Tyler County Fairgrounds if you're looking for any of those.
---
I dissagree my most fun wins are bush camping watching the last guy get killed by a mob
---
The terminal in your camp reveals location for free
---
I'd kill to be able to have a garden and actually decorate my cabin. 
---
Deliver unto us these dank secrets brother
---
It was never actually removed. [This page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce) on Bethesda’s official website contains the line “As a Fallout 1st member, you’ll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop, so not only are you getting bonus Atoms every month, you’ll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on.”
---
So it’s not just a figment if anyone’s imagination or magically disappeared from the marketing overnight. It’s still there for everyone to see. The problem is that there have been several pages advertising first added, but if I remember correctly, this was the page posted at launch.
---
So, my friend would use his personal terminal to see the location of Ansel, I wouldn’t be able to see it in my terminal, because I’ve already done it... correct?
---
From what I've read, it was for a quest that was scrapped, so it's just a random curiosity.
---
Awesome thanks !!!
---
Same thing happened to be with 20 hand made large gifts. I was admiring the haul that included the mothman plan and two!! Mega sloth plans when server crashed. Logged in and plans were gone. Fortunately the 20 gifts were there ready to be opened again but all I ended up with was common plans.  So disappointed
---
Technically "free" is a 100% discount, so the discounts they originally offered are still there. Just dramatically better than what was originally suggested by that wording.
---
Doesnt change the fact that its near useless
---
I never knew about the terminal....however, I still see him at the water park.
---
I don't see how it's that shameful to offer things for free rather than just discounted. Indeed, it seems much better and more generous to me.
---
You're being downvoted for speaking the truth, unfortunately.
---
Why hasn’t somebody sued Bethesda yet?
---
lol
---
You're free to criticize Bethesda all you want but can you come up with some critiquing that isn't mentioned a million times a day every day? 
---
Most of us get tired of hearing the same points made day in and day out as to why you don't like the game or Bethesda's business decisions. 
---
Bugs, atomic shop pricing and strategy, lack of content, game stability. Every day it's the same complaints that people voice. 
---
Guess what. Most of us don't care and still enjoy the game.
---
A bunch of new skins for costumes and tents. As I understand it there will be new stuff each month that way.
---
That’s how it usually goes. Someone has to though right?
---
Yeah after this sorted itself out it was fine. Reloaded a few times didn’t sort it so got bored and did something else and randomly at some point I just saw and heard a plan learning and it was for uplink.
---
They should have taken them out then. 😂 Maybe I can sell it. 😂
---
The stuff which was originally promised as being discounted has instead been offered for free. If it's a dupe, it's pretty generous to the person being duped!
---
That's some really good sentence structure. 10/10.
---
Sue? It's your own fault for continuing to support them.
---
Make Deathclaws scary again 2020
---
We're waiting for you to get the ball rolling
---
I'm am not at all savvy with legal things so I can't really say. I do know that some kind of legal action was taken in Australia and Bethesda was refund the game to certain people because it was deemed a faulty product.   
---
  
---
If I were to guess as why that is it I would say because the Bethesda TOS is worded in a way that they could murder a person and not be held liable. Seriously, there is a term in there where they can ban you for making another person feel bad, no joking.
---
Idk man 100xp seems a bit much i suck an can get 3or 4 kills a game on average without too much trouble
---
Yes! Definitely.
---
Dirty old Teddy bear is in the dlc the Burrows in Harpers Ferry. 
---
There are two versions of the souvenir teddy. I don't know if they look different when displayed. 
---
Pristine. Could it be in the toy store in the whitesprings?
---
NukaShine is one hell of a drink
---
Yes, true. The Crickets are a good source of Acid, but DeathClaws...carry nothing, and they are 3x as scary!
---
Sssshhhh keep it on the down low man. ;)
---
Awesome. Good to hear.
---
Thank you all for the support and offers. That's why I kind of just blew it off. I found the two guys later, just to run up to them and give them a thumbs up. Everyone plays it differently, but that's not my way.
---
For foundations, the default stone/concrete top one takes up much more space than a plank top. If you want those built your camp and switch when done.
---
Advice.. always log out. I don’t stand for that sort of predatory behavior. whenever I get attacked by other players and I have junk I’ll log out at the speed of light to hop servers. 
---
:/ people stink. Sorry for you.
---
Eh it does and it doesn't. I don't think you are feeling the meaning I was trying to get across,.
---
Given all the bugs in this game, they probably thought they did take it out lol.
---
I love it! Thanks for sharing this.
---
I have an opinion. I assume their are others playing that have strong feelings as well. Is there a war? No..but I see public players avoiding Firsts and vice versa. I avoid buying from First users because they have such a massive advantage already that I'd rather some public player get my caps. Plenty care but I rarely hear them professing it on mic.
---
You've been receiving updates for free for YEARS, and some of them have been great improvements.
---
I don't want to know the quality of anything you do.
---
Then you're all idiots and you're welcome to this shit show of a game
---
Is this ur main character? Do u farm nuke zones? How does it work against the queen?
---
Also pairs well with the traveling leather coat and green hood.
---
Looks like some of the traders I’ve come across...
---
🤔 now that you mention it....
---
Lmao
---
You’re the best
---
Well the discount for the length of your subscription is far more valuable than a single free item. Although I'm not sure how ot was phrased exactly.
---
At this point, who is surprised? They have already falsely advertised other aspects of the game and its deluxe edition content.
---
We usually all make it to the end and then mess with the last guy. We'll set up a boxing ring and try to get him to box us. Sometimes we'll try to trap him in a camp. Sometimes we'll just punch him to death lol.
---
Thanks! We will keep enjoying it!
---
GT= Knightofthecrow
---
You do that
---
But don't come crying to reddit when wastelanders is a colossal train wreck and the rest of this game falls to pieces which it will
---
Check YouTube, they’ve got tutorials
---
Yes, I noticed that. They at least need a Armor/Health boost and/or a leap ability/something to close the gap to get in melee range. Would be threatening if they could climb or jump on structures to combat the marsupial users. They are suppose to be one of the strongest creatures for high level players to fight but are too easy to kill
---
God that quarry was just over the hill from the starting town also 😅
---
It's a terrible event. You are forgiven.
---
Dude same tho
---
Thanks! Just spreading some holiday cheer! It’s the season of giving after all haha.
---
Didn’t think those worked anymore
---
Yes, it was a nightmare. It felt good coming back after completing the main Story-Line, being almost invisible and killing all of them though.
---
60 downing + 40 for killing(100 total),would be great,indeed. And it would speed up matches in a good way.
---
I’m still online. Xbox obviously if the post wasn’t clear. I’ve already given away 32 sets of beanie and fur lined coat. 
---
Let’s give away 100 by the end of the night!
---
You gotta go up the mine belt to the top of that tower and blast them with anti-material rifle. I used to love that.
---
Yes, i agree. That would be awesome yet terrifying if they could climb. That would be horrible!...
---
Sorry Xbox. It’s on the post “flair”. Sorry I didn’t respond sooner.
---
Buried with honor will be a cake walk now
---
When you can lay for the fridge and have 3 extra perks ontop ofnthe food buffs? Yes.
---
I earned 400 atoms in the span of 2 days.......
---
I can’t upvote more than once :( lol
---
I mean technically the discounts that everybody gets also applies to Fallout 1st members.
---
got'em
---
If you're new I would also avoid claiming workshops until the presents event is over. Far too many level 150+ trying to farm presents right now who will kill you moments after you set it up. It'll tilt you hard away from the game.
---
Nobody is supporting their asses at this point. Get your facts straight, dipshit
---
It does work. Just not right away. You will need to relog that character to get the credit.  I have tested this both with buying from player vendors and moving items from one of my characters to another of my characters. This definitely works.
---
Welcome to Bethesda hellscape
---
You might want to check nukes and dragons. Yes there are correct builds. Same with angry turtles food build. It doesn't use good with salt either. So you're just outright wrong. Sorry
---
Really now? OP is paying to play so are a bunch of other people in this sub.
---
Between this and the toxic waste clean-up, disposal, clean-up cycle, the Graaaaaafton Mayor and I have got a great racket going on!
---
Nope, I haven't even pvped in this game. Not dumb enough to make that mistake with all the PvP hacks out.
---
It's par for the course for Bethesda to screw over even the people they convinced to pay them every month for a game they already bought.
---
He spiraled into a deep depression after a vault dweller accidentally barbecued Chally during meat week
---
Go look on nukes and dragons. There absolutely is correct builds in this game just like any other rpg game with stats and skills you can chooses.
---
Sure you can pick non optimal perks, that doesn't change the fact you'll be far stronger buying the fridge to not run good with salt at all. 
---
It's how I can drop the sbq solo in under 15 seconds .
---
I usually stand up and do the robot dance when I know I’m safely in 2nd place. And yes a lot of times the other team emotes back and runs around me. I think we all have a good time with it. 
---
Sometimes they just headshot me and move on to the next match. Lol
---
Since you’re appear offline can I just message you?
---
I used the workshop budget.
---
Weird is perfect
---
It was a joke...
---
Yes. But not sure why it’s showing me offline on my Xbox I’m seeing it set to online. Sorry!
---
+1 dude! I tried pressing some buttons to no effect. I thought it was a PC only deal. This will help when buying 5mm off people.
---
Something about looting an area of everything you can possibly loot and then breaking it down is just very comforting to me. The repetition is addicting.
---
I’d just cancel the subscription. I’ve given up on this company now due to practices like this
---
So true...
---
Wow, across all the places I've shared this project the response has been overwhelmingly positive. So you are the very first person with something negative to say about someone doing something good and free. I guess I shouldn't expect your contribution then? I'm honestly sorry if so.
---
I don't come here to complain about the game because I enjoy it!
---
Will do! I also forgot to mention Neff the Cloud, his content is jokes
---
I’m not being negative about it it’s honestly pretty cool looking but you wrote the title as if we’re all gonna die if we don’t know about it
---
It’s not really that valuable, the mod itself isn’t rsre
---
So far I’m actually really enjoying it. Been trying to level up and stuff I got a buddy who plays that’s been giving me tips
---
To be honest, if the coming dlc/expansion with npc's works like an ordinary Fallout game, i will probably throw out that money also just to enjoy a SP Fallout felling.
---
Or they did take it out, then put it back in the next update.  🤔
---
Could be something you ate or drank. Could be an armor perk or chem.
---
I feel ya. Same on PC
---
Been a player since beta, and this is the first time I've gotten one. May not be rare overall but certainly rare to me :)
---
The map is so damn good. Can't wait till it's filled with people...... and raiders to rough up.
---
hell yeah the new new free states
---
It's just a title meant to catch attention. That's all. I could have said worse I guess.
---
Yes considering how large they are! Those fucking mirelurk kings tho beat my ass every time lol they should be easier to kill!
---
Oo oo, also could be a mutation.
---
Sorry to hear that. I do hope you are managing your illnesses ok. Maybe make a claim with UPS for the console?
---
I've explained this a million times and like every time before it this will likely get voted down. 
---
Yes, they offered discounts on exclusive items as a perk for 1st. Remember the ranger armor reskins? Bethesda put them up for 300 atoms ("cheap" for an outfit and helmet skin). Remember what people's response was? They freaked the fuck out and started screaming about how they deserved it for free. Did Bethesda decline because free reskins weren't part of the deal? No, they changed their mind and they gave them away for free, and then they did the same with the next reskin this month and they'll likely do the same next month. 
---
Were people grateful that Bethesda changed their mind and swapped out the discounts for straight out free goodies? No, they start threads like this twice a week whining about it.
---
I have 360 atoms, hopefully I can get the remaining 40 when I get home
---
You can send me a link if you have photos online somewhere, or you can send to the email in the blog.
---
Quit months ago, but Grahm is probably the only thing I miss about the wasteland. :(
---
Sounds just like Todd, you wouldn’t happen to work for Bethesda customer support would you?
---
But it could. It's not a 100% but like 99% I'm sure... However, it could just give up the ghost and be lost to the void. So low level and Junk or ammo only for me. 
---
If it works for you, super. But with Beth's track record, I'm a little skeptical even in fo1st
---
So long as I can see important details, I can draw it. It's okay to take chance ;) but any time and I'll accept them.
---
Efficiency is the key. Don't use 5 connectors on a wall when you could use 2....or better yet have everything electric linked to 1 or 2 rug glitched gateway connectors. It's much cleaner and you save budget.   Don't use 5 lights in a 2x2 room,it's not a late show set.  Turrets are useless,just as crops(unless you have a huge crop farm,which is still really unnecessary). 
---
Same goes for dimensions(they matter lol): if you are not able to decorate it, that 3x5 mega plaza full of literal nothing that is your second floor....It's horrible and useless,beside wasting your budget.
---
That’s funny, Mirelurk Kings are tough, but yes, they need to be buffed very soon!
---
Lol. . .Don't feel bad guys.  I only knew it was there because I spammed the sliders in FO4!  
---
Also, in case y'all haven't noticed yet.  The longer you hold the button, the faster it will move.  This is for both the 1250 jump as well as the normal single digit slide.  This speed up is in a lot of games that have sliders!
---
I enjoy the automatic shutdown feature when the game calculates you have played enough for right now. 
---
Also just being in a group and chatting on discord while just messing around, hunting Santa’s or taking workshops.
---
Put some respek in his name. 
---
Sheesh
---
Relatable. Wish people wouldnt make broken games
---
Didn't know that. I like my concrete base exterior,but i'll now change all the internal ones to wood and see if budget drops a bit.
---
Army helmet also looks good.
---
List of improvements:  
---
\- Exp gain across the board needs a boost (100-400exp for 30 minutes feels very stingy)   
---
\- Time between ring closures should decrease by like 20 seconds per phase (should increase the pace of the game)   
---
\- Increased Exp for kills to at least 100 per (I have no incentive to be involved in fire fights because it would give away my position)  
---
\- Assist need to be added and give 20-50xp  
---
\- An effective anti-cheat needs to be implemented (why bother when someone will just flip a switch and kill the server?)   
---
\- Slow self revive needs to be added if the player has stimpaks left (20-30 seconds ?)  
---
\- Blueprinted structures and SPECIAL point distribution should not be tied to your Adventure mode character  
---
\- NPC spawns need to be further away from the player they are spawning on (countless times I have had a grafton spawn right in front of me blocking my way and dealing unavoidable damage)  
---
\- More rewards or condensing current rewards (less icons and photomode frames)   
---
\- Don't make seasonal events grindy especially when its adventure mode rewards. NW can be fun except when you want us to play for 40k exp... grinds kill fun. At the very least revert back to the Halloween exp build up without resets.

I don't have any mutations or effects when that's happening. The only thing that i saw before was that i was thirsty/hungry and when i drank some purified water the weight of my items went back down by 30 pounds

There's no clicks in positivity or fairness, only in outrage and negativity. Why I don't both with most gaming YouTubers any longer. I want actual information.

I carry an instigating, faster swing speed, weight reduction shovel on me for that daily and to smack a bitch when Biv needs it. It is also nice to conserve ammo in low level areas by just smacking things.
---
Still looking for that weight reduction Shepard’s crook.
---
anyone still playing this fucking disgrace deserves everything they get.... done
---
It just works. xD
---
Yea that one is a blessing and a curse.

I mean I enjoy ark and enjoyed dayz but I still know when to quit asking for quality of life improvements. From the company who put the scrap box behind a paywall. Something they specifically said they would not do.

And remember, some people enjoy eating shit and never get sick from it. Theres and entire sub reddit dedicated to it. It might be larger than this one. I'm not joking.

They’re cargobots, though I’ve never seen that many in the sky at once
---
Imagine being this guy lmao
---
will try
---
I’m on camp build 5 I think. However you decide to build it next, sacrifices will be made.
---
Too true.  Metal Armor isn't even in Nuclear Winter, and yet, you want a neat skin for it?  Time to hide in a bush for 5+ hours!  Fun!
---
Where?
---
This is where the cargo bots go to lay eggs.
