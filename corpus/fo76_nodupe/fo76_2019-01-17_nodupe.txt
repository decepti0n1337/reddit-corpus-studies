I've dropped out of my server launching nukes twice now.
---
I no longer launch nukes unless a friend is in the same server so I can rejoin nowadays...
---
That's really the only one other than like Uranium Fever. 
---
I mean, sure? Do you presume something about my stance on that issue or something?
---
Yes. Doesn't happen super often, but have noticed it's tied to a laggy server. I'm on XB1 btw.
---
GET RID OF TSE AND DAMAGE STACKING BOBBLEHEADS ALREADY
---
GODDAMIT THIS WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM
---
i get it, but if you're making a post and you're talking about spreading false information in the trade stealing part, at least get the right information.
---
 "The way it worked was it included the duper quickly crafting a large  amount of items (usually boards because they stacked and were easy to  make) in order to destabilize the server's ability to track the  character "
---
Duping has nothing to do with quickly crafting. a duper could take all his time crafting his boards(because cheapest mats ), and because there is a in-game restriction on how many items you could stack. (you can hold only 250 weapons/armors in a stack)
---
duper craft 250 boards, put them in a stash or drop it in a bag, craft 50\~51, and take the remaining 250 boards so it stacks to +300 boards. that's where the character goes into instability ,rollback checkpoint and disconnection.
---
The main reason the servers were unstable because of duping are people who macro click to craft these boards.
---
Mostly people who just craft bazillion of items for irl money trade --&gt; people who don't care about the game.
---
Also there are other faster method to dupe that are more straining for servers...
---
Weapon repair kits fit in with the 'survival' aspect they want fallout 76 to have.
---
Unfortunately the xkcd example doesn't scale well to having 30+ different passwords
---
You are thinking of site specific security. The longer a password is the longer it would take to brute force it. The idea when dealing with multiple sites is not to prevent them from using a brute-force attack to break the password at an insecure site that allows hundreds of guesses an hour, it is to prevent them from getting the password at the unprotected site and then using it at a secure site that locks you out after 3 or 4 incorrect passwords.
---
Turrets take up A LOT of the budget. 
---
See this guy knows. I just hate to see people over paying for items.
---
It's meant to provide an element of realism. I think the discovery is fun, but it is frustrating not knowing if you're purchasing a mod that you already know. I think a dot beside the mods you already have, as they appear in the inventory or stores, would be better. 
---
I think this also keeps people from obsessing over completion and seeing the individual details. On one side, I see what you mean, but I like playing devil's advocate. 
---
Needs to deal more damage too. Dumping rounds into an enemy that has no chance of killing you because it just has stupid amounts of health is boring and a nuisance. 
---
Non legendary just the combined DR ER RR values from a full set at normal and 200%.  I don’t like using overrepaired values as they constantly change as the armor degrades.
---
I never noticed that great point!
---
&gt; finish the SB menace
---
How exactly? Just kill the Queen? Am i thinking too hard about it?
---
Ghouls...Ghouls...Ghouls...at the Doll House in Fort Lauderdale.

I'll just leave that right *here* to see wants to run with it...

---
Been rocking my level 25 instigating explosive double barrel for a while now. Nothing else comes even remotely close, especially with shotgun and explosives perks.
---
Ya. Over paying a little bit is ok. Some people have different prices. But 2500 for a serum is just ridiculous. Hell I bought some of my serum recipes for less than that 
---
Still outdated, still weak. Just because it resolves one issue while being huge issue in another area does not make it good practice.
---
I just use it when it's unlocked.
---
Moonshiner's shack is one of the favorite places for duping, along with Sugar Grove.
---
Did they really? Fools can’t appreciate real art
---
Although maybe there should be some accountwide thing you get when you finish so subsequent characters have an option to skip 
---
And the ghoul with the ticket number name! Lol 
---
exactly what I was looking for, thanks
---
"One of them sent me a message:
---
"We're checking the inventory of every player on this server. If you are using exploits to duplicate some rare items. If you don't let us see whats in your bag, we'll destroy your camp and killing you.""
---
How did they send you a message? The game has no internal chat client. On the off chance that you were both using the chat mod, the closest it could get to this would be the local chat option.
---
Have you this bug too? Btw I don't know man. Surely is not simple to handle a game like this I guess. They patch and new bugs come out. I'm not defending Bethesda. I'm the most frustrated one cause I'm a vet. Playing from Fallout 3 and I love fallout. It's hard to love this game too but I fucking love it too. I just want it without bug. 
---
Lots of assholes out there... Dont let them ruin it for ya. Block and server hop.
---
Intelligence affects your xp gained, your hacking ability (amount of choices) and duarability of crafted items. 
---
Yeah I found this out when I scrapped my glue farm for a firebase.  Had around 20-30 MF, Tatos, and corn for a couple of weeks until I cooked them all
---
what I'm saying is why do you think Energy weapons deserve "extra" perks that Ballistics don't get? 
---
Thanks!
---
*The game is buggy so I am justified in being a cheating piece of shit that impedes the enjoyment of the game by others!* Terrible logic. 
---
I've considered the spreadsheet as well, and maybe a short list for what I'm actively after.
---
There is a mod for PC, I've installed it but it didn't appear to work for me. 
---
Thank you!
---
That's about what it feels like.
---
I agreed with you on length and complexity, but then you linked the comic that suggests using 4 common words - that is even more vulnerable to a dictionary based attack than a 9 character password is vulnerable to a brute force attack.
---
Dced 4 times since I started this post.
---
New rule... Everybody fights, nobody quits. If you don't do your job, I'll kill you myself.
---
I one or two shot every person I’ve come across, have never died to someone with a bounty.
---
Yeah this is superstitious nonsense. Legendary drops are just consistently trash. 
---
You haven't seen the half of it. 
---
I bought the Vault blue paint... makes me look like a Ultramarine Space Marine from the 40k Universe.
---
".... Ooook. Message received. I lost. Fair."
---
Likewise - but since we're apparently never going to get the ability (on console at least) to see known plans/etc, I was hoping to save myself wasted caps
---
Purportedly, you can drink some sulfur water and repel ticks as well. Feel free to test this out for me.
---
Nah just have more logging of crashes and lag spikes and the like
---
I don't think they "deserve" extra perks. I think they need them
---
Adrenaline gives a 10% damage boost for each enemy killed in a certain amount of time, maxed at 60%. Also, mutt chops give 10% melee damage.
---
"Do something great. Make yourself proud," Todd Howard said. "Make the player proud they played it. Make them proud they bought it."
---
I hope you all felt proud when your number was finally called...both times.
---
Camps shouldnt be able to be damaged at all. Maybe generators, turrets, and crops, but nothing else. It makes no sense that a random molerat or scorched would have the burning desire to attack and destory fences or crafting stations. Just have them 'take over' CAMPS liek they do with workshops.
---
When mr J came around the corner, I didnt know what was happening until I freaked out, shot my combat shotgun about 7 times (hitting nearly everything but Mr J). Only to realize he was the numbered J that the monotone, slow government worker robot had talked about. Once I realized that (well me and my buddy I was grouped up with), I couldnt play for around 30 seconds because I was paralyzed from the laughter and realization that that actually happened
---
Thanks for supplementing my self doubt stranger
---
Be careful with too many lights and wires
---
Hmm, I didn't know about the inventory limit of weapon/armor stacks.  It does look like I omitted the wrong information then. Thanks!
---
Just because I’m a rich motherfucker, I’ll give you 400. GT is Dutch Morgan 
---
I have hundreds of gears, springs, and screws squirrelled away. I don't use power armor even in nuke zones. I'm looking forward to auto vendors to sell these items. 
---
For those interested I do a blitz melee build and just make a few rounds in the nuke zones when the mood strikes. Prototype hazmat suit and med-x do the trick for me. 
---
I have 2 turrets total,  should I have stuck with 1? Also, if i scrap things do they go back in to my budget or no?
---
[removed]
---
This is a good idea 
---
I’ve noticed the delay between entering VATS and actually it showing the damage percentage is significantly longer than before the update. Amongst other, pettier crashes. Sort it out Bethesda! 
---
I always let people get a shot off on Legendaries. Uranium Fever is my fave and I would hate to ruin that for everyone else. No reason to be using a TSE or E weapon at this event either. 
---
I fell it’s like 10-15 pieces per mod.
---
Also of note that people who did so were in extremely high risk of being banned for it, if the GM's figured you did it intentionally
---
Legate Lanius or pretorian ftw
---
You can absolutely be justified in your displeasure. 
---
But you only really have a few options as far as the game goes:
---
1) Stop playing entirely
---
2) Keep playing and deal with the issues.
---
3) Take a break and come back later.
---
You can be as justifiably upset as you like. You bought something. You're entitled to be upset if it doesn't live up to expectations. 
---
But that's not gonna fix anything in game or improve your experience. So you have limited options. One of them is taking a break 
---
It says even more about the fans. 
---
Pathetic. 
---
Clearly you haven't seen the desert ranger armor.
---
I've been playing this game since beta ! idk if it's a bug or something ? Seems like I  can't even see the infinite loading circle spinning because there's literally No loot on her 😂 Reported this issue to beth for multiple times .....still no response though. 
---
Kinetic or Optimized since they both regen ap rather than using more to go faster
---
Well, I bet now that you made this post the duper’s will certainly stop their nefarious activity and kill the sbq in a non cheating fashion. 
---
Depending where you've set up you can get away with none. My camp gets attacked every time I travel in but it's either 3 ghouls or 3 robots. They like to destroy my crops which is a minimal fix. So I go without so I can build more. 
---
I'm at work right now but in 3 hours I can sell you whatever you would like. 
---
Yeah, I saw one suggestion somewhere to make it so you don’t get caps from nuka cola as a way to make the duper’s infinite supply useless weight... but I can’t deny that I find some small joy in gaining one cap from a random nuka cola I find. 
---
tl;dr
---
Oh I have. But I also want legion armor
---
or, and hear me out, even if it sounds like an alien concept to you, if someone dedicates his time to get the card, clear the sile and prep the launch, he can kill her in whatever way he wants to. if you want in on the party, be there when the bomb drops. the game even gives you a convinient timer.
---
I farm those guys every chance I get. 
---
Wrong
---
Why do I feel like I’m doing it wrong? I go through like 0-4 pins depending on difficulty/life remaining on current 1. I’ve always considered myself decent at lock picking, I now think I’m trash
---
Profligate
---
20 bulk is not indicative of duping at all lol. Its insanely easy to bulk that much. More than likely someone transfering between accounts. 
---
He said it was mod approved.  I’m Naruto and I approve this message.
---
on the bottom
---
I get that a lot now when I fast travel to Harper's Ferry, tho I also loose sound as well. More to the point I loose all sound including if I have a video or music running on my second screen. But once I close the game out the sound comes back.
---
Make sure you scrap wires before disconnecting devices like the generator else you will run into a bug where it won't let you build and lower your budget.
---
No, you’re right, it is. 1400 caps per day in total between all the vendors 
---
Maybe Bethesda should get rid of those developer rooms before they actually release a game...... unless the game actually needs them for some reason? 
---
You can't blame players for finding the developer room and using those items that the developer left behind.....
---
Everyone only cares because it's an online game and people are selling them for real money. 
---
It really only cuts it close to the clock when 2/3rds of the server is hiding in the shack waiting for the high levels to kill her. Sadly the real boss in that situation is the ammo consumption and weapon quality, rarely do I ever need a stimpak.
---
this sub sometimes, lmao
---
Or simply just a Riot Gear as we have seen in Lonesome Road.
---
Most AAA titles now are not polished, balanced or even finished. 
---
I bought 2 games in the last quarter of 2018. Blops 4 and Fallout.
---
Blops 4 had entire game functions missing. Broken camos. Glitches, market place or black market or whatever, wildly unbalanced weapons and perks that are still being fixed....
---
It's not just Bethesda, it was just trendy to jump on the FO76 hate train at the time.
---
I have some two shot weapons i dont need where do i sell these? 
---
Thats just insane!! What a unique build. 
---
Don’t have video but was consistently killed by slap damage during white springs nuke by the same guy using some gun that wasn’t explosive. Killed me and another guy a few times each with one hit in power armor at full hp. Idk about the other guy but I had around 400 hp plus the power armor and still one shot from slap damage think the guys name was navydragon or something close to that 
---
Yep, you get an update that fixes some stuff and tries to fix other stuff but creates more problems elsewhere that actually hurt the experience. 
---
Where did you find the plan for nuka mines?
---
Can’t find them or any info on the googles...
---
Yes and sadly I sold mine by pure accident. Rough because I usually tell people to slow down and stop mashing buttons... But there I was, button mashing out some undesired legendaries after a nuke zone run and the blade went with the lot. 
---
Watoga is pretty great
---
The ultimate form of disrespect.
---
If it’s their nuke I don’t see why you should be mad. If it was yours then I can see a reason to be upset. 
---
&gt;Most
---
&gt;I bought 2 games
---
Pc or console
---
West tek research center is the best building by far. It’s in the savage divide.
---
sadly, more than a little normal :(
---
thank you, right now I have motion assist for my torso for the extra strength, but am considering ractive plates
---
Had it happen a few times now 
---
Yup, don't exactly remember what its called...Marksman or something like that.
---
my best weap is a 1* two shot handmade.  it can get me out of anything.
---
my fav weap is Furious Gat.  Absolute beast.
---
Anything using AP will consume them faster - VATS critical build just isn’t viable in PA due to the crazy drain.
---
I can confirm I and another guy were repeatedly one shot by the same guy with slap damage in passive mode during a whitesprings nuke. No idea what he had but I was consistently dieing on one hit before I knew I was even being attacked, didn’t see any explosion from explosive bullets so idk what he had 
---
I guess I'm just lucky I have never had this issue but I hear about it alot
---
Console. Xbox. My bad!
---
I’m also curious I pacified a deathclaw then it turned around 5 min later and tried to kill me 
---
Actually lol'd.
---
Rekless!
---
yeah I heard of stuff like that, I just want a pet frog
---
All this really does is slow me down when I want to not absolutely waste everything that I've taken the time to loot. I've saved almost all of my junk and ammo because I was going to sell them. 
---
So its either travel to 7 different locations to sell my shit (and lose caps because I'm going to fast travel) and repeat that process over a week or so. OR I can do it even slower and only make 200 per day? OR I can just drop all of the shit that I've looted. 
---
This game makes no fucking sense? 
---
Crashing like crazy up to 3 times an hour Xbox here 
---
I played last night post patch and got the audio/video freeze followed by crash. This was about an hour after I claimed and setup Charleston junkyard. On a new world I still witnessed the enemies missing from claiming the Charleston junkyard. 
---
So frustrating . 
---
Your inability to grasp basic concepts delights me.  I told you that you had small pp energy because you got all mad when I pointed out that you were pulling a dick move.  You interpreted that as an attack on your actual penis size, which tells me that it's probably a sore subject for you, hence the obvious projection on your part.
---
Furthermore your response was to be petty and spiteful by declaring that you would now go out of your way to occupy that spot and deny others an opportunity for a rare encounter.
---
That marks you as either immature, or unable to control your emotions over a video game and banter online.  Since my assumption is that you are not a five-year-old, the obvious conclusion is that you could seriously improve your life with the help of a mental professional.
---
Good luck with that, and I hope you feel better soon.
---
Want that drill you on psn?
---
Watching a hannibal lector (red dragon) movie while reading this post. +1 :)
---
Sure. You'll have to take that accuracy hit though.
---
joining u! 
---
No idea if it was from bobblehead bonus or what but I have been one shot in pacifist mode by some jerk in whitesprings nuke zone. No idea what he was using but he repeatedly killed me and another guy in one shot from slap damage while in power armor 
---
You put it in your Data folder?
---
I also hate this. Some of my friends have deathclaws and I can't go to their camps because their pet immediately aggros me and then turrets start shooting. 
---
YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE
---
Honestly, I do the same. I have a radium rifle and shotgun / nuke grenades that I spam when she’s on the ground, but when in air I generally get a crit or two in, then hide at the bunker door and long-range help clear out all the scorched and assorted on the ground. 
---
Or just fix the actual bug and stop being a whiny baby.
---
Try standing directly in front of the wall you're trying to place them on. I had this problem too and it's because they snap weird 
---
I was minding my own business in the Enclave bunker when a 140+ level player accidentally (I assume) aggro'd the bots. He took a couple of them down before an Assaultron got him. I ran over to see if I could stimpak but instead I could only execute. I hesitated a second but then did it.
---
I forgot I had cannibalism perked. I feasted well.
---
ah I see. Sure can do! 
---
Have you noticed any specific task that seems to trigger it? 
---
I have not. I will say it is more prevalent during queen or nuke launching quests but those have always been taxing quests anyway. However, it seems to just be random. Its dont it to me while fast traveling, standing at my camp, by vendors, about everywhere recently. I dont dare touch whitesprings now. 
---
They are really tricky. I have the best result placing them near the middle of the wall and can’t never really go beyond 4 letters in a row without problems. That being said I manage 5. 
---
I’ve done her at least 2 dozen times and this is the first I’d seen it :(
---
Aren't taking and pacifying different though?
---
When you use the all caps like that it really expresses how upset you are over pixels.  Get help soon.
---
An AP shotgun, however, is the bees knees.
---
Those guys went sissy slaying
---
Luck of the Draw hardly never procs for me as of this necro post, maybe nerfed through the patches.
---
And even that method ultimately isn't the reason duping exists, just the current method.  There's likely other ways to destabilize the server/character to create the same effect.
---
I'm entirely unconvinced Beth has this fixed in the right way.  Most likely they are just patching methods, and not yet addressing the underlying problem.  When we see the 5th legendary star, a max item level increase, or some sort of duped item deletion(EXTREMELY unlikely on this one), that will suggest that Beth believes they have the problem fixed.  Any of those steps would be completely pointless if they believe duping is still possible.
---
2 shot fully auto handmade.  Play commando build like cs:go.
---
You may already have the perk lowering armor weight as well, it stacks on legendary weightless as well.
---
I would love to do battle with a jacked up mothman. Im getting bored with the game. At this point im grinding legendaries and getting all plans... I lose interest after a couple hours solo.
---
A A A Care with tamed pets ATM don't know how precisely the bug works but if you kill the pet/move the camp you got stored budget bug. NO JOKE
---
Definitely. Unlock more stocks by breaking down the weapon.
---
Nah, followed the Instructions under the mod Description. Says right into the default folder ("Where the .exe resides")
---
actually its on loan to a neighbor.
---
pacifying is what I meant, as in taming them with the perk
---
How on earth could they do that? If you find a bag in the wild and pick up something dropped and its duped would earn you the same ban as someone actively exploring the game? 
---
What's your gamer tag?
---
And that kind of exaggeration makes your comments marginal at best.
---
"one"
---
And here I thought they were suppositories. 
---
I love radworms, made mutation farming much faster. 50+ rads a second &lt;3
---
shotgun + Enforcer is very handy against old Queenie. Cripple the legs and wings when she is on the ground and she can no longer attack or move. Before I had my explosive hademade the shotgun + Enforcer combo was my go to because even if you cant do much damage to the queen you can keep her on the ground for everyone else.
---

---
I just found a left arm. So I'm only looking for the right arm now
---
I have gotten to the point if I aint seen it, it is new to me. I have maybe a dozen or so total plans missing. 
---
It's happened to me, AND TO FRIENDS THAT WEREN'T EVEN LEVEL 5.
---
You sir are undermining the efforts of people trying to bring attention to a literal game breaking issue and I do not appreciate it. 
---
I've heard fuel consumption is an issue with those, you might plan on taking Ammosmith to help offset that.
---
One of the questlines rewards a modded flamer with the Suppression prefix, although I forget which one. Might be a Free States quest.
---
I’m not totally sure but the one time that I joined in on the radio, I listened to what it had to say once and changed back to the normal radio. About 10 minutes later it started the actual Hunter/Hunted game. 
---
Could tune in at the start of a session just to have a little change every once in a while, since it seems to queue you up even if you’re not listening to it.
---
Devs are not artists, twit.

Awesome spreadsheet with all the mods (for weapons and armour) and their learn chances in this post:

---
Looks learnable according to that ;)
---
I’ve been paying since beta and I’ve only unlocked enough safes to get the achievement. 
---
After that, it’s not worth the time and effort of switching out the perk cards and then picking the lock for nothing. 
---
I’ve actually had the opposite. I ran into someone’s camp near the overseer camp yday and their mirelurk king was passive to me
---
It’s spilt by faction. They did it this way to limit people from getting bunches of cap at once because honestly it’s super easy to sell stuff. Otherwise you would burn through the game too fast. 
---
I was sitting in my recliner procrastinating my trip to the DMV.....that's when I came across this quest and irony slapped the crap out of me.
---
Didn't finish the quest that day due to bugs.....and never got crap done at the real dmv.
---
Ads on  assault rifles is off as well.
---
I saw several while I was server hopping Grafton Station and the Responder Bot inside of Grafton City.
---
I bought one and learned it, then I saw a few more over the course of 3 hours while I was getting much BoS Combat Armor plans.
---
It was coming right for us
---
Hmmm perhaps there is another exploit at play here where you can bypass the slap damage somehow. I’m inclined to believe that something is going on even if it isn’t the bobble head thing necessarily.
---
I get it, it’s a hassle. What I do is go to vault 76 for free, then fast travel to Morgantown station, Sutton station, whitespring, enclave bunker, harpers ferry, watoga shopping center, then watoga station. It’s under like 50 caps or so to fast travel whole way. Just takes time and inventory management along the way. 
---
Best to probably give me all of your stuff to be safe.
---
I'm already stocked on junk and also 5k+ of fuel. (Been saving on my other character for this) but yes fuel is gonna be a problem. I have a TS flamer so I don't need the quest flamer though it sounds good. 
---
And no mentioned the other bad news to him yet, you CAN'T sell your ammo.
---
How do you take a different character into the same world?  I guess you are grouped with a friend who stays?

Good grief.  Dictionary attacks have nothing to do with English language dictionaries (or human language at all), and a 44 bit password is not feasibly vulnerable to them.   **Please** stop this ignorant nonsense.  You are giving people bad advice about something that is important.  Just google it if you don't know.

I've seen people say that queen has high explosive resistance, so might be worth going for Demo Expert to break the resistance more. But I have no idea if it's true or not, I've just seen it said on this subreddit.

Someone nuked Harper's Ferry on a server I was on. Spawned some Legendary Mutants and glowing ones. The loot was better for all the enemies. Plenty of nuked flora around as well.

More info?

TSE Bolt Action, with hopefully a third affix.

It's a visual bug. Usually it's the amount you just reloaded. Test it out. Your ammo actually doesn't disappear. 
---
That's exactly what banned people are claiming has happened. Truth or not idk
---
I myself wonder how they are able to do it since there has been numerous reports on this issue (no actual evidence however I might add, unlike what I’ve provided in my above link). I fully believe that there COULD be a way to bypass the slap damage mechanics, but I’m just here to inform people that it’s **NOT** because of anything to do with bobble heads. It has been tested numerous time and I have even linked video proof.
---
Where if I may ask?
---
Have you noticed any task, event, or area that seems to cause it more?
---
Ok cool. Just checking.
---
I did the same thing and it works on my box

Your safe, they won't make a blanket statement like that.

Ive gotten good results running without power armor. Feels like a crutch to me. So chonky and blocky. Do not like. 
---
Good point with the cap condom. I'll be using it
---
We should chat... About that rifle :) PM me.
---
I wonder if there was a concern about indestructible player structures blocking access to areas. I could see a griefer going passive and blocking access to a doorway, or a resource spawn. The turret camps in Whitesprings also come to mind. The ability to destroy them seems a counter to players being inconsiderate to others in the region. It creates an imperfect balance.
---
So what are you worried about if ya didnt dupe? I dont think everyone should be punished. However, the ones that sold shit for real money... Yea fuck those people.

Good suggestion - bookshelf doors are already in the asset library from Skyrim.
---
Not trolling anyone.  I never insulted anyone and spoke the truth as I see it.  Crazy what some consider trolling these days. Smh
---
Picking up mainfrmae cores for example, removes bullets from my equipped gun
---
1 shot passive pvp, nexusmods bans, trade stealing are all total bullshit and people need to stop regurgitating it like its true.
---
The worst is the 5% random useless bubble gum buff that comes in those. At least make them noticably fun to use.
---
Well I *swear* I did, just checked my PC at the house and didn't see the .dll   
---
Have to see in a few hours, its in there now. 
---
So having a conversation with someone is now considered trolling?  Wow
---
Oh vats always used up a fair ammount of core. But it wasn't this bad. I swear it was a ninja nerf. I've lived in power armor since lvl 15 so I know the drain. Something has definitely changed.
---
All of me thinks it's pretty stupid - it basically forces VATS build players to not play the way they built their character when in power armor but yet the game forces everyone to wear power armor in the end game - such a stupid design/balance oversight. Should definitely reduce the drain that currently happens with VATS use.
---
No. You can even craft the cheapest thing (arms) and unlock all mods for all slots. I just spent the last month gathering materials to do just that. The last one can take like 100 pieces to unlock. You'll need lots if leather, steel, plastic, rubber, circuits (for Robot), and Asbestos (for Marine). Gathering materials was a chore. Make sure to use Excavator armor with calibrated shocks to carry plenty of materials, and build/scrap often to reduce the risk if losing your junk. Here's a spreadsheet I created that will help you keep track of the mods so you can figure out when to stop.

no, they need baseline rebalancing.

thank you, stuck 3/5 had to use transfer to scroll to the bottom to find the diamond on the safe and body

Dyer Chemical often has at least two legendaries. Sometimes there's a 1* gulper near the north end and/or a few 3* Sergeant Gusties. 
---
If you're getting an infinite loading screen try logging from another system, fast traveling to the vault, and then trying your system again.
---
I haven't seen any proof of anyone actually getting banned, and the closest thing to proof I've seen is from people who post videos on YouTube and such getting banned. But that's only because there is video proof of them duping. 
---
One of the people on my friends list dupes and they aren't banned on xbox (as of yesterday at least). Their mule has over 100k weight. I'm not sure they have that kind of tracking on individual items to know who has a duped item and who doesn't.

Breach and Clear events will not spawn content inside their containers, if a nuke recently have been launched on the server.
---
Yes, the hardest enemy I have facing in the game is my explosive tesla rifle with shotgun mod
---
Basically the social tab. I look for people that are doing things that take investment, like workshops or if they are in the nuke silos and check their profiles to make sure I can join on their game, put stuff in a world container (I use unmarked locations for this for the lowest chance of people stumbling upon it), put stuff in the container, exit the world, change toons and then use the social tab to find that person (I usually pick a few just in case) and join there game. I’ve done it this way probably 20 times now (because I *never* get good drops for the character I’m running but one of my other builds ofc) and have never had an issue. I’m on xbox if that’s relevant.
---
Maybe but thats why you cant buikd,your camo to close to marked locations anyway
---
Gane is still crashing, every 1 to 5 minutes upon login, seems to be worse maybe because of the time of day number of people playing.  I have lost tons of junk because I got disconnected after a death.  The game is about unplayable,  can we please get a dam hotfix already.

Ok dude. Opinions are opinions. 
---
I swore I saw cap prices for 1 cap when I was at a vendor before for some of my ammo. 
---
PC, crashing every I play, just crashed right now and two times before that.... within an hour.
---
I picked one up today that was level 25; grabbed it from the Watoga Vendor. 
---
So glad as I could not be bothered re rolling another character just to go through the quest line to get the reward again.
---
Trying scrapping them instead :P
---
I have a regular two-shot and it is a fun way to burn through some excess ammo, and decent with not killing the legendaries too quickly.
---
Nope
---
You're going to have a rough time with the flamer.  I built my first character around supporting my friends with Friendly Fire too.  The Flamer is ultra fragile and will break often so be prepared. ANYHOOO
---
Perks like Bear Arms and Batteries Included will go a long way reducing the carry weight of your Flamer (Flamers possibly?? they really do break so easily) and all the fuel you will need.  Also One Gun Army is a lot of fun when it procs, staggering and crippling packs of Scorched or whatever really.  You may want to invest only one level of the Heavy Gunner perks as well..that would allow you to spend points in other perks mitigate the shortcomings of the flamers fragility.
---
It's not "bypassing" the slap damage it's just increasing your damage by such a high amount that the drastically reduced "slap" damage you do is still enough to kill in one shot.
---
Shhhh..... Keep it secret, keep it safe...
---
"Oh sure just a second"  escape, z, quit to menu.
---
Same question for you as all the others, notice a specific task, quest, or area that the crashes seem to frequent or is it just random?
---
On xbox you can just send a msg to their gamertag. it's not "in game" but it works ok.
---
I play on Xbox
---
Don't use two of those leg mods at the same time. Leg mods (except calibrated shocks) don't stack. None will help your flying time, but optimized + kinetic will help you with sprinting more. Optimized time reduce Sprint AP consumption, and kinetic for faster recharge between sprints. If you want to fly long, invest in Agility and get more AP in your pool, and hotkey AP replenishing items like Coffee or Nuka Cherry.
---
Xbox Live?
---
If it weren't for either Junkie, Suppressor, Stalker, or Medic dropping at least 50% of the time, I might not get so depressed every time I see a 3 start ghoul.
---
If there is a trigger I haven't noticed it. Seems totally random.
---
I agree with what you said 100%
---
Yeah it just all depends what your shooting and how resistant they are 
---
Here's an idea.
---
Pick one of those topics and tell us how Bethesda properly addressed it.
---
Could it be all of the confusion and misinformation is caused purely because Bethesda has done and continues to do a half-assed job of communication when it comes to FO76?
---
Blast. I don't have access to another system.
---
Yep... as are me... 
---
Depends on what legendary ones you can get your hands one, I have both double (12 rounds) and quad (24 rounds) explosive ones and they handle well.
---
Second this. I could see it being meh solo but teaming up with my friends is fucking dope. We have a blast.  Almost ready to start stacking bodies in silos 
---
Oh damn, sorry. 
---
The internet sucks ass at conveying emotional inflections in speech, it needs to up its Charisma!

Anyways have a good day!

Submit a ticket on Bethesda's support site.

---
Same here, I mean the trouble spots (queen, nuke silos, whitesprings) are worse, but nothing that stands out. 
---
I love updates that make the core experience worse. 
---
Literally an hour after I posted this my camp was attacked by a level 110 with his friend, a level 20.  Just came in and started destroying everything, one shotting everything which granted probably is possible for camp items. I circle around his back and took a shot with my level 22 in rifle.  Took his damaged down about 15% total.  He realized I was there, turn to me, and killed me in two shots. The first took me down to 25% health, I popped a stimpack, and then he shot me again before I got back up to half.  
---
Spawned back in, spammed him with plasma grenades, and was able to take him down once. But not before he destroyed my camp completely.  Still don't have all the materials to rebuild it.  I logged out and switched servers.
---
Got any friends you trust? You might be shit outta luck otherwise.
---
This is what happens when your account gets banned. No reply or response from them either. It’s pretty bad and unprofessional, not even giving you details about why. 
---
Not your fault if you didn’t memorize every item in the game and traded for something you didn’t know was banned..
---
No idea what he used just know he was definitly one shotting with slap damage and I didn’t see any little explosions like you’d see from explosive bullets 
---
What are they gunna do, ban 50% of the people playing the game? Pfft, not likely.
---
I know it effects condition of loot. But if that's the only thing effected I would be hugely surprised. 
---
Took two days for me to notice that typo lol
---
I’ll sell or trade you a TSE flamer
---
The feel like the story gets real good from 20ish on. Once you start venturing out and learn about the story for each area. Maiden of mysteries. Fire breathers. Free states. Top of the world and the raiders. Those all have some really cool stories. 
---
You don't have to press the button in front of the four posters and listen to the long ass explanation in MODUS voice. 
---
It hopefully continues to improve with big fixes and content updates!! I'm lvl 53 and I love it so far.
---
Wack.
---
Yeah, lol. First crash today I thought "Stop 'fixing' the game, your breaking it!"
---
I trolled no one and no one trolled me. I was having a conversation with someone and it was a friendly passing of individual ideas.  Did you happen to read it at all?  Is this Todd Howard?   
---
I tend to stay at a spot for a while. When I have a moment of boredom or find a prettier spot or more valuable spot I will change 
---
50%?  Literally everyone who has traded with people they don’t know likely has duped items. Very, very unlikely anyone is getting banned for having something that was duped. 
---
What do you want to trade it for?
---
Anyone shocked that a day after this post FO76Bazaar has lots of full armor sets for sale?
---
Are you answering or asking a question?
---
Did anyone ever figure this out? I'm having the EXACT same issue. 
---
This quest was terrible for me. Since there's no checkpoint until you complete this part. I crashed/disconnected about 4 or 5 times during it. Was not a fun experience, lol.
---
I thought that yesterday when it started happening. They made a post on Instagram about how war never changes... I replied so why does it crash more after this update? And they liked it? 🤔
---
I mean, no. That’s just absolutely not true. At least *pretend* to look at the link I’ve mentioned before you try to argue against it. That guy does 240k and does no more than 5 hp slap damage. Same as everyone else.
---
J47!!! Been waiting for 25 years, they finally call his number, and some vault dweller is in there trying to cut in line? Aaaaaaargh!
---
There's a way included in the email telling you the account is banned...
---
That's your best bet.
---
I'm a melee build so I haven't even bothered with scorch beasts. All I can do is watch them spam their shit and never land
---
I know I'm not *that* retarded. 
---
If your visitors are on your team, the pet isn’t hostile. It’s only been nonteam visitors that get attacked, at least with the pets I’ve had so far. 
---
You're not wrong on any of this. I think you can sum it up by saying there's a world of difference  between "What Bethesda had planned" and "What they could actually deliver".
---
TSE handmade rifle. Dropped by a level 94 after I gave some goodies to his level 11 buddy. 568 damage and counting.....
---
Not always

Can also throw in 2000 fuel

---
TS 3* cryolator

---
&gt;completed all missions
---
Not all of us have tho, 2 months and im still going with the story. so I dont mind if new content doesnt come for another month (which seems likely anyways).
---
That's not suspicious
---
"You'll never see a server."
---
I'm like 99.9% sure that he said that at E3 and yet the servers that we're supposed to never see seem to crash quite often.
---
The meaningful drop rates in this game are the literal worst of any loot based game I've played.
---
added the stats :) 
---
I always visit there first when in Whitesprings.   I use them as target practice with my sniping rifle without VATS.   On the PS4 with the controller it’s a bit challenging. 
---
I'd settle for any hat/helmet at all that actually affected stats or offered some kind of damage protection.
---
I’m not banned tho my bro is and I know he isn’t duping 
---
Yeah, I think you're onto something. I think they put items into the legendary lists that can't actually support legendary effects(drill, syringer, flare gun, probably others). I had the same issue in Fallout 4 with mods that added more legendaries. Sometimes I'd kill a legendary enemy, and they'd drop no legendary, but have a weird thing on them, e.g. a blue bandana on a Mirelurk. I'd never seen the issue in 4 until I started using mods that pushed the limits of what can be legendary. 
---
So I’m rocking a full set of marine armor. My question is what’s the best armor set currently available without Mods. Would it still be Marine? 
---
2/10 since launch, it's just luck I guess.
---
Nah I’ll tell him that
---
Not to mention an impact on visual performance for those that go close to said camp if it was allowed.  Think of duppers putting 10,000 Gnomes in one house
---
Lock slap damage at 1HP per shot no matter the damage of said gun
---
I think this is false. I do the most damage to her when I shoot the ground beneath her belly when she's on the ground, the explosive radius hurts her baaaaaaad. 
---
I do have the plans and didn't think making and scrapping them would give me mods. What else don't I know? The way it played out for me is I received mods the first 5 guns I made and scrapped. I dropped then picked up one or two and have no idea if that helped or not. I ran out of steel and went scrounging. Came back later with enough steel for two more guns. Nothing when I scrapped the first, but learned a mod the second gun. Low on resources again, I'll do this a few more times after more scrounging to see what happens, but bottom line, my lever rifle is getting better and I appreciate the help. 
---
Processing, processing, processing, (long pause), processing
---
I personally damn near one shot a level 20 at like level 40 with just a regular double barrel trying to just slap him to see if he'd fight me. I dropped some stimpacks after cause I felt bad, but single shot took out something like 2/3 of the guys health, and that was just a normal ass double barrel. Getting one-shot with a TSE weapon and relevant perks is clearly possible. 
---
bethesda is too cheap for proper testing.
---
Can’t help ya there :( All I use are marine, so I wouldn’t be able to tell ya what’s better, although BoS combat armor is really high up there. I know someone made a spreadsheet over the standard stats of most armors. When I find it I’ll be sure to link it :) 
---
I'm well aware Bethesda pulled the destitute card and is unwilling to give console players the patches they need when they need them, and prioritize PC. Since 76 bombed in the reviews, they have to get the money to source the very expensive hard to find canvas for all the canvas bags they couldn't provide before. So us console users get to continue to deal with the bugs they've already patched for PC.
---
The one major thing I want is to have the helmet separate from the outfit because it dose nothing, it dosnt protect you form air or water diseases has no armor rating and you can't go any were near rad zones because it prevents you from using the rad suit what's the point of role playing if your always having to remove it also I'd prefer it without the helmet anyway and this should be the case with any outfit that has a head piece 
---
What was the outcome here?
---
I noticed this as well. 
---
Wouldn't mind a long animation for it either, or they can just make load screens not take that long
---
Thanks! Yeah I really love the marine armor but even still I’m finding myself a bit more damage than I thought. Do you personally wear an outfit over it or something under? 
---
I want to agree with this but then theres those people who make turret camps at whitesprings and I nuke them or use my TSE .50 cal every time I see them.
---
Yes I love playing in peace and so our camps should be safe as well
---
I'd recommend against it. Beth Poland said on Facebook they're looking into *anyone* with debug items and "softlocking" their accounts.
---
Happened a few times now. It's rare though, Usually I get 2-4, or more if they've reset since I was there last.
---
Check whitesprings station vendor and watoga station vendor after nuke’s for people’s unwanted legendaries, you find all sorts, , I picked up a TSE .50 cal at whitesprings station as someone sold it to the vendor, must have already had one or wasn’t into heavy guns but you can get lucky sometimes and pick up good legendaries that way, oh and I feel your pain on the rng it’s always stuff that’s of no practical use lol
---
I heard they are banning for anyone with dev room items, traded for or not.
---
Shits new to me.
---
I've always heard "borked" used instead of "broken" or "fucked".
---
Never had a clue it was related to politics.
---
What? 
---
I'm confused. 
---
No, I'm gonna drop my stuff at random places to surprise people, including my T-60 with jet pack. LOL
---
So, a whole unknown way of duping? 😂
---
What is...this-this HERESY.
---
Ps4 pro even crashed today just standing in a elevator didn’t even have controller in hand!
---
I always try to team up with anyone now if doing sbq/workshops/nukes.
---
Proof: https://www.reddit.com/user/BCM1190/comments/agh9u2/discussion_screenshot_of_email_for_ban_notice/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Note that it says the ban is for actions related to duping and not simply having duped items. I've seen a few people post similar emails so believe these are legit.
---
I don't realistically think they will ban people based on their inventories except maybe those with ridiculous amounts of dupes such as mule accounts. I believe bans will be based on actions performed by the characters that match duping activities and report submitted with video/screenshot proof by players.
---
Maybe that is my problem the weapons had it on was not very good so it was very minimal with the health I got back maybe if I get it on a better weapon it might work better.
---

Notice more crashes than normal?
---
I forgot that existed after the quest lol
---
i have just tried to log in and getting this now.  
---
i had tried changing passwords to several different ones i have used, nothing. just pops up an error on screen saying something went wrong, but i get an email saying password updated.
---
  
---
submitted a ticket and waiting for some sort of response.
---
Wow, I caught 12 dupers doing this and killed them all at once! Now I have five billion pounds of loot.
---
WHAT DO I DO WITH IT? SHOULD I DUMP IT IN THE RIVer?
---
Pacifying and taking are two different things. If you pacify, it just won’t attack you for a small amount of time. It won’t go back to your camp. If you get the option to tame, you can keep it at your camp. 
---
As far as I can tell, you can’t tame a frog. I’ve tamed a deathclaw, sloth, mirelurk hunter and mirelurk king so far. I know you can also tame bears from YouTube videos. Haven’t seen anyone tame a frog, fox, beaver or other small animal. 
---
If you're having the same issue as me, it's going to get worse everytime you move your camp
---
I'm now stuck at 120% stored budget with nothing built so I'm officially homeless
---
Always farm whitesprings when it is nuked. Huge xp and legendaries.  
---
The only decent place for late game farming, sadly. 
---
So if course Bethesda have tried to nerf it. 
---
I wear the Enclave shielded armor as I’m a melee, and I use Iron Clad, Evasive, and Barbarian perks to further increase stats. 
---
Do drugs. Go into withdrawal. 
---
I won't lie to you, I'd be happy if they took the current legendary-incapable drops(drills, flare guns, syringers, probably others) and made them properly support legendary effects, be capable of being higher than level 5, etc. Legendary Syringers at least have a chance of being useful in some way. A legendary drill would be pretty silly, but it'd be a funnier joke weapon than a 100th pipe wrench, and maybe it'd see some combat against low-level enemies with a legendary effect or two.
---
Excellent, that's what I was going to do :)
---
Keep up in the good work!
---
oh I see! thanks 
---
I'd be fine with camp attacks if my experience wasn't ONLY from a bobblehead griefer who could one shot me so I ended up standing there powerless while they obliterated my whole base
---
Wow! That is quite the jump in damage! Ok, I am going to have to check again and see if it changes this time.
---
You forgot bloody mess and tank killer. 
---
I don’t think he does
---
Prime TSE Gatling Gun is a Scorchbeast MURDERER.
---
You drop it, its fair game.
---
Yeah... that's true, but in a game it is a bit sad to see essentially only one scoped rifle (combat rifle kinda sucks IMO).
---
I got a "sniper rifle" in game at level 10 or so, but it was a level 25 weapon and I was really happy to stash it away for later and suck up the space it took away from the limited stash only to find out at level 25 that it is just a hunting rifle with a worse barrel than I had on my current hunting rifle and by switching out the barrel the "sniper rifle" just became a "hunting rifle" again... that wasn't a cool experience at all.
---
A Barrett Model 99 or Ruger Precision would've been nice to see in a game for the late game sniper and as another weapon to get mods for. It was quite fun to collect weapons for the mods.
---
I use a single shot handmade in game right now and it works, but a "real" sniper would be way cooler, IMHO.
---
I'm not trying to shift blame on anybody here, just showing how, intentionally or not, people have spread false information and caused a far bigger divide among the community than necessary. Even I have believed some of these things in the past and warned against them before finding out theyre fake
---
What?  Try to reign in your rage at a simple comment and realize i'm not a duper nor have I ever been, nor do I like people cheating.  I'm just not willing to apply terms like Honor to Fallout 76 as it's been served to us.  
---
Very greasy,I thought things were gonna be smoother,slowly as time goes on,shit the bed again I guess.
---
Damn, I almost did the exact same thing.
---
If  Reddit is to be believed, most abandoned safes IRL have nothing in them.
---
No. As stated, the idea is that it's made to take out military equipment, hence the term materiel. By design all guns penetrate material, so that reasoning is moot
---
Cause that's how you make money.
---
It's definitely happened to me a couple of times. Same with the syringer, and I've heard complaints of the flare gun, too.
---
This.  You should see a damage increase once you are in withdrawal.
---
Yes it's a bug no hats show up in the crafting menu hopefully they will fix
---
What's your Gamertag?
---
5 billion pounds? I sure hope you have the 7 or 8 perks dedicated to weight reduction. 
---
Yeah, I just would prefer that they make entirely new content for the atom shop instead of stuff from vanilla fallout 4
---
Try altering your custom.ininfile and starting in borderless window mode.
---
If by "normal armor" you mean "only combat armor", then yeah.
---
May help with VATS accuracy, but not confirmed.
---
That might be bleed damage, idk how much if at all it's affected by the slap damage mitigation
---
Holy shit!! Im heading over there tonight.
---
Hmmm, yes, maybe a Berserker's Paddle Ball?
---
This game literally got worse after the most recent update. Me and a couple of my friends cant even play the game when we first log in. The second we open our pipboy, it gets stuck open onto a black page and wont close. Our character get duplicated whenever we fast travel. We get lagged out of servers more often than before. The list goes on.
---
Kk ty...thought it was odd.
---
Frequently, since the most recent patch.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Thanks for the excellent guide. This could help many players who believe pvp in FO76 is just a one shot scenario where only TSE's rule. I'm pretty much an amateur with no OP weapons, but by using cover and a variety of inventory I've won all my fights except one against TSE's. The one time I lost was a team battle and the other team was using their TSE's in a propper way, while others are just running around with confidence, but without any plan or preperation in mind, fully relying on their supreme weapon.
---
Do you happen to know what's up with the timer for pvp? I could be wrong but I've noticed that the game cancels your pvp status with a player after a short time not hitting each other. It's quite annoying and also invalidates your remark that if you don't want to retaliate fast, you can just as well take it slowly.
---
I'm also not sure if you're correct about the caps you lose and win. The being wanted suggestion is very good, but in normal pvp it appears you lose caps equal to your level, while the winner receives a percentage in caps of your level, perhaps half. I'd like to see this confirmed or not. I'm often too high on adrenaline and managing possible retaliation to notice the exact deal with caps, but losing caps equal to your level is something me and my team think is the case.
---
The uranium fever event at blackwater mines is good for your level too. You can get about 3 legendary items during the event 
---
That's normal people logic. *Getdafuckouddaheeeer!!*
---
Now, every single time it had happened to me, or anyone else I've seen claim it, it was someone using melee abusing the glitch. 
---
It wouldn't surprise me if it's still the immortal flying asshole mutation stacking glitch considering how strong twisted muscles and talons is. 
---
Make memes its ur cake day
---
It has drawbacks, but mainly its that people will get all your passwords if they can hack your google account. If they hack any other account they only get that password.

Tomorrow apparently.

Uranium fever mole miners top out at lv 40 so the highest that they would drop would be 40 but some weapons and armor will drop at 35
---
Don't forget the 3x waste acid that you already have 350 bulk units of at CAMP.
---
I wish they at least had the CAPABILITY of being legendary. Maybe because of how the weapon works, effects like Ghoul Slayer might not function like expected, but I'd rather have them take off effects that don't work for the weapon type and drop ones that would actually work despite the weapon not using conventional damage(e.g. double, quad, two-shot, ones that add damage resistance while aiming, raise special stats, etc...).
---
How the F are you lvl 30 in three days after buying? are you power leveling with buddies or something? Im playing solo a couple of hours a day, bit more on my day off, and im 15. 
---
I admit im letting myself get immersed a bit with the quest lines, but still. Any tips would be appreciated. I wouldnt mind grinding 5 fast levels just so i can smash those god damned death crickets in the Uncanny Caverns. They demolish me.
---
Gunsmith and lucky break basically negate this. 8 perks is to much though, should be more like 4.
---
I think tormentor adds cripple 
---
But why would a company staged in Boston be advertising in WV?
---
I dont remember the rest
---
Hells yeahs. I’ve got a TSE shotgun. 
---
Sorry I should have specified I’m on PS4. Is that something I can do on a console? 
---
It was the first week of release so it was a mole miner's gauntlet, lol.  
---
It’s really helpful (if your there) to take on the ground enemies if you feel you can deal more damage to them, I think once you hear the “duh duh dum” and it says Scorched Earth Started the game assumes your there for the duration so I’d be surprised if her health/resistance went down if a person left, if you pop a couple of shots into the queen to tag her but then get stuck into the ground enemies so the folks with the big dps builds and weapons can just concentrate on getting her to land and filling her full of holes, that would be way more helpful than just leaving for sure.
---
You may want to keep an eye on vendor inventory.  I got most of my weapons from various vendors after people outgrew theirs or simply found something better.
---
And don’t forget to mod the weapons you have.  A hardened/powerful receiver can extend the life of a gun considerably.
---
Because Mass fusion reactors have plants nation wide they started it Boston but they sure as hell aren't only in Boston.
---
They're a pain in the ass, but if you play around with them enough you can get them aligned. The smoother walls (ex: barn) are much easier than textured (ex: brick). The brick walls in particular I find are a nightmare for trying to get them aligned correctly. 
---
so I guess it's useless when not in vats?
---
or use the one inside the resort 
---
Drop Barbarian for Blocker, most mobs are melee anyway, and if you're up against ranged Iron Clad and Evasive is more than enough to handle the damage.
---
Good to know! Ill have to check that one out
---
Yea my personal theory is that there’s some exploit that makes it possible for slap damage to be negated entirely since even melee is a 1 shot during normal pvp. I have all the mutations you listed and more and I still do no more than around 5 hp slap damage and that’s with a little over 3k claw damage. Something fishy is definitely going on.
---
I've done enough for today I guess :)
---
I think most of the BOS died in the glass caverns trying to kill the scorched beasts, and the rest of them were killed defending fort defiance from the scorched and scorchbeasts, like in the line in the sand event.
---
Nah. I have more faith in a broken ash tray 😩
---
Not all duplication glitches are patched and yes everything can be duplicated. The reason he was crawling along wasn't because of fusion cores, but rather being at 1 million carry weight. That slowness happens somewhere near 800 I believe. 
---
Uhh? Okay if you say so. 
---
He was overweight with all the duped items, fusion cores wouldn't help. Report him if you can.
---
Oooh that infuriated me the other day, I was at the golf club and ~14 ghouls all up were swarming, so Mr .50cal machinegun spoke, and they all listened... eventually.
---
I counted probably 3 legendary buggers on the crowd, and all I got was a friggen vampire pipe revolver iirc.
---
Not. Happy. Jan.
---
I also have played 600+ hours of this game and never experienced this 
---
Yep and different. New ones are frozen load screens, pa enter freeze. Not seen server disconnect yet!
---
Love this game, but damn Beth pushing their luck.
---
I hate them. They make the scariest noises in this game,  second only to the mothman
---
It’s just junk and the game encourages you to travel light.  Grab what you want/need and don’t travel heavy.
---
Where's the link stating that or is that just an assumption you're making?
---
Right now they need a durability boost, and also need armor reduction perks to affect them( like tank killer, which only lowers ballistic resistance)
---
That would depend on your definition of many. Also, the fact that you're surprised when you come across someone tells me you either don't have many hours, or are intentionally avoiding people. I encounter people all the time, all over the map. Even the same people multiple times in multiple places on the map. The only times I've found I don't encounter people are when I end up on an nearly empty server in the middle of the night. Hard to run into people when there is only one other person on the server. As for lasting damage, that's subjective. You've clearly never had your camp razed, and not had the resources to repair it, leaving you spending hours just trying to find the junk necessary to repair everything instead of doing what you wanted to do. You're just like every other person who has never truly dealt with griefers, you think they aren't a real thing. You'll change your tune when a group of people 200 levels higher than you chase you across the map killing you with slap damage and letting their friends claim the bounty before someone can really claim it. I know what you'll say, just change servers.  That's actually hard to do without a friend online to join. Always great spawning right next to the same griefers you were trying to avoid. The block feature is pretty fucking worthless then.
---
I also want to point out, that there are a lot of shitty people in the world. Those people play video games too. Do you think they stop being shitty in a virtual world? I'll give you a hint, they tend to be worse because they believe they are anonymous and can do what they want without repercussion. Bethesda designed PVP to favor the dickholes of this world.
---
Looks like Seneca Rocks
---
Yep I agree, took a SBQ down tonight with 4 of us and it wasn’t a world record time or anything fancy, but it was much easier, felt like there were less megasloths and hermit crabs too.
---
*fireflies: they're bigger on the inside*
---
Works every time
---
Peas and carrots.
---
[Some others seem to be having the same issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agq868/did_i_got_banned_or_hacked/)
---
Bring back the Junk Jet, but instead of shooting Junk, it shoots legendary items... Kapow! 3 Star Exterminators Junkies Nocturnal Baton to the FACE!  
---
Well, that and critical rate.  It's pretty strait forward and documented on the wiki.
---
Lol a Nuka Cola fixes everything 😂😂😂
---
Haven’t seen this posted yet.
---
/s
---
This game game should really start at level 50. End game rewards need to be improved for the cost. There needs to be some high level areas you can't one shot all the legendaries. There is a lot of room to grow in this game. I just hope they hear us.
---
15 minutes is fine, sometimes I die and I have to slowly walk back. I have noticed a bag with players, lots of players really don't want your junk, some will just take and couldn't care less. I agree, give it 15 minutes if it is still unclaimed go for it ..
---
I have had it where I died and some dim rod stole my bag and he didn't even kill me. I don' think others should be able to claim your bag unless they kill you or you leave the server.
---
Two shot explosive 
---
It ain't. unfortunately. My net is fine. only started since latest update.  i'm running 50/25 megabit connection on Australia NBN. I get about 48megabits down and  about 22 up. all other games are ok. funny thing is, that since repairing the install it got worse. Before hand, it would connect allow me to run around for 10 seconds before disconnecting. 
---
Does the xbox version come with a disc or just a box with a code?  I have it for PC but want to get it for xbox and game share it. 
---
Then at least mention the largest contributing factors which caused all of these stories to spread in the first place.
---
Not only has Bethesda been happy to launch an untested buggy game, but they've repeatedly reneged on promises made to the community for better communication.
---
I try to advertise on the forum sometimes that i'm about to nuke for new folks, having the Endangerol Syringer seems to help a bit(25% damage resist redux to enemy).  I think if there were more reason to still kill her past helping others some would be less jaded, but beth has said they've got some info coming and i'm pleased they are looking ahead and going to let us in on it.
---
No BoS inflated ego military brat is perusing my stash just to see if I have anything worth taking on some justice pretense. YOU RESPECT THE RULES OF THE WASTELAND, YOU HOLD NO AUTHORITY HERE, TIN MEN.
---
;)
---
It just says that.  It shows how many rounds you fired recently or since you picked up a thing.  It doesn’t actually remove ammo.  I tested this earlier this week.
---
Get a marine armor helm plan for a dirt cheap way to get 27-30+ caps a pop for 1 glass 1 plastic and 3 rubber...
---
Quick question
---
Have you done the brotherhood quest line yet? Am I free to spooooil away?
---
Me at whitesprings-
---
2 shot explosive. I never acquired one in hundreds of hours playing, neither does anyone in my team. But just explosive bullets without two shot is already pretty brutal on some weapons I've seen.
---
It really doesn’t matter what I’m doing.
---
I’ve heard is a new dupe glitch that logs the whole server out not sure if this true or not.
---
Tiny Scrotum Explosion?? 
---
Welcome to Apalachia, start by exploring and try to find food and water.  
---
After you gather some wood try and build your own camp.
---
15? 14.
---
Gunsmith, Nerd Rage, Stabilized, Batteries Included :)
---
Who needs explosives?
---
Really? I tried this and I still isn't working. Even relogged and everything. Pretty sure Bethesda is just bound and determined to not let me enjoy this game. I've caught just about every single bug I've read about lol
---
turns out im fucking banned for being overweight for buying junk off of someone and i had a mule character bethesda can say bye to their game if theyre banning innocent people holding shit
---
That's amazing, I have to switch cards for crafting, grinding, casual, and nuke zones
---
This right here. Second character doesn't have any switching. They needed a better system here.
---
Mine is Exterminator.  Watch out bugs. Actually with Demolition it’s awesome 
---
I think they just want to place themselves away from obsidian because for some reason they don’t want to work with them again
---
Ooh, this *may* work.
---
Let's say we earn a token for each legendary killed, but it takes 2-3 tokens to unlock 1x mod on a weapon, much like it costs steel/lead/adhesive.
---
More tokens give better legendary mods
---
 ie: 1☆ =2token, 2☆ =4token, etc etc.
---
Then we get a choice, can customise to our build, and get to try a few different iterations.
---
All of this works exactly same for armour too I believe.
---
Or the train station
---
Is it possible enemies are spawning in objects/slightly off the map and I can’t reach them?
---
Since in-game lore States they were trying to expand so why not advertise to places where your going to make power plants
---
Yeah or like Morrowind.
---
1 of the various methods is patched now*
---
At level 94 I’ve encountered my first explosive shotgun not double explosive but still pretty whoop ass
---
( now at a much higher level lol)
---
I just completed all my sets recently. The hardest to find for me was a lvl 45 raider helm. I found a pretty solid method for finding them.
---
For raider I just server hopped blackwater but that can take awhile depending on what lvl enemies spawn there or if uranium fever is happening odds are someone took it.  After hopping for probably a week without a raider helm I remembered seeing raider PA in a raider camp near top of the world. Forgot the name but it's in the middle of a sort of battle arena. First visit there I found my helm
---
As for the t-45,51&amp;60 watoga is the best bet. When you spawn in check the tail end of the downed vertiberd. After that head to watoga medical services or medical emergency services I forget the name but go in there. Not too many enemies, some decent chems and whatnot and a legendary at the end. Go all the way up till you find a door for roof access. Once on roof turn right around the corner should be another set. Then head to the couple outposts south east of watoga should be one at each of those. The outpost ones can be a pain because of Sb in the area but just run like a madman. 
---
Hope that helps other than my hiccup with the raider armor I was able to complete t45,51&amp;60 at max lvls pretty quick. 
---
If they do they will just half ass it like they did ammo crafting. They forgot to put in the ability to break down ammo, so what would they forget to implement in repair kits? Honestly can't think of how they could fuck it up. Only repairs ranged weapons? Only repairs the weapon if it is at a specific durability? I should stop giving them bad ideas. Or maybe if I give them enough they will fire their current bad idea guy and pay me to give them bad ideas to implement in this game.
---
I don't think you're using marginal correctly
---
It boils down to the game being popular to hate.  Forums are filled with folks that don't play and are happy to spread FUD that supports the.hate train.  Kinda got to the point I figured that WAS the game for them.
---
Same! The crashes were spread out before, now it's all the time
---
Not much to say about this one to be honest. It's alright I guess.
---
I can't seem to find the post but shortly after release I saw a post regarding a literal godmode glitch that was attained by getting ALL mutations and joining a team with another mutant while using stranger in numbers to trick the game to give you a massive boost to all of them.
---
He called it the immortal(because your Dr is so high from scaly + grounded) flying(marsupial and bird bones basically let's you glide all the way across the map) asshole(because the damage mutations were so ridiculous that unarmed attacks, NO WEAPONS AT ALL, would ohko people in pacifist)
---
I thought they fixed it though.
---
I honestly didn’t know there was more than one
---
That would cause a disconnect. I've been experiencing more crashes, or blue screens. 
---
Also they had already sold cold fusion tech to the US government in DC which is very close to WV.
---
Only if I can build a castle at my camp to use them with.
---
Hi Toph, 
---
For some reason it worked for me after a few days. I have no idea what happened, but I don’t think it had anything to do with the update. I suggest just doing other missions, because for some reason that worked for me. Good luck!
---
Add me @GTMBros
---
Wouldn't it make more sense to advertise in surrounding states rather than all the way out in West Virginia? I mean, we didn't see any advertisements for Mass Fusion in the Capital Wasteland so why are we seeing them in West Virginia which is only marginally closer comparatively if at all?
---
One thing that isn’t really spelled out explicitly about perks and builds very often is that there’s a soft cap at level 50. After that you still level up and earn cards, but you don’t earn anymore SPECIAL points (though you can forgo getting new cards each level and instead decide to shift a SPECIAL point around), so having a good build or a strategy for shifting in and out different sets of cards becomes more important.
---
Can you let me know what console you are playing on so I can pass this feedback on? Please feel free to let me know of any other issues you're experiencing as well. 
---
Gratz dude. Game sure is great when u get a stable session.
---
What's the damage output 
---
Whats worse .. is the god damn message spamming your every 15 seconds .. or what feels like every 15 seconds. :|
---
nice one
---
I will! Thank you! 
---
I had a vampire me handy blade
---
You def need a nuke for flux but a popular spot for them is whitesprings and there’s way more flux than at fissure prime, I just go there to kill the SBQ and accompanying enemies but if I’m after flux,  hardened mass, glowing mass, fluids etc I farm that at whitesprings where I can find the bodies to loot, the grass isn’t as long and there’s no trenches for bodies to fall down into and disappear cause you can’t see the meat pile etc lol, there’s a ton of fluorescent and yellowcake flux it’s everywhere but for cobalt you need the back of whitesprings where you’ll find glowing blue sap on the trees and nuked silt beans, there’s no violet flux that I’ve found (that’s abundant at fissure prime) and the crimson is a bit sparse but there’s some at the back where the cobalt is to be found called red hot blooms I think, anyway hope that helps
---
No it just looks EpIc 
---
Yes, check map they can be “quite” a distance away.
---
Tripple-Stuffed Eggroll?
---
Cool, thanks 
---
Even though explosive shotgun is pretty broken, two shot is probably the most balanced because of reload.
---
Thanks for this feedback! I've passed it on. 
---
Check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agr8l7/an_honest_discussion_about_the_misinformation/?utm_source=reddit-android) out. Read the part about the duping. 
---
That is an awesome idea, I love it lol
---
Thanks! Yea, I won’t lie. After watching the negative reviews on YT, I told my friend I didn’t want to try FO76. But I’m glad I did, it’s been a blast so far
---
Although, I would like to restate that I do not work for Bethesda, I'm just a player making these threads for fun, I'm also showing others limited items without having to log in daily and trying to create a space where we can discuss how much we like or dislike an item for it's looks, price, ect. 
---
Want to upvote cause you're right but want to down vote cause screw that quest line. Up voted. 
---
You could rig up something to turn power off when tripped. It would just be a bit more long winded (as all of the trips are set to switch ON when tripped).
---
Possible though but more awkward.
---
I’ve found to use VATS to find enemies . Sometimes they are off in the distance not even attacking you but they are in the zone 
---
Wouldn't that make a better advertisement rather than saying they're keeping Boston running? Especially since DC is a lot closer than Boston....hell, I think DC is marginally closer to Boston then WV.
---
This would be brilliant! 
---
I'm on this right now. Half way through game crashed. And went right back to the beginning when I reloaded. I love this game. And I also really fucking hate it. 
---
The old method you mention actually I believe is the new method. And right now they back to the old method to crash the server to dupe. 
---
You can read my posts that post several days ago. And actually before the last hot fix and after the patch on 10th. The server got more unstable that crafting or even drinking large quantities will crash the server. I personally crashed several accidentally. But as I said I won’t provide proof because that will just sell out my source. 
---
[XB1] still wondering when Bethesda support team will get back to me about my ban issue when it was a false accusation! 
---
Thanks 👍

Mutant slayers leather left arm. FUCK YES!!!
---
I’ve had 3 or 4 now so it’s definitely the game and not just bad luck
---
Or manage your weight correctly so you can pick up everything and still be fine 
---
Mutations are your friends. Research them and choose which ones you want. When you’re ready to buy, purchase from other players - NOT in-game vendors! They are much, much cheaper this way. Before drinking the serums, make sure you have the perks “Starched Genes” and “Class Freak” fully leveled up and equipped. Once you’re mutated, avoid using full-strength Rad-X (it suppresses your mutations’ effects). 
---
ok cool , thank you
---
Came  here to  say  this.
---
It’s a 2 star junkie combat shotgun depending on the perks or reaches up to 300 of damage (245-300)
---
It does organize things better and makes it easy to switch up your build as necessary. I don’t think certain perks need to be made passive or anything of the sort; just having a deck system would fix the unwieldiness of it.
---
Yeah. I thought about a trap that would destroy a power pylon, but that’s too slow. Just wish they’d include an OFF trip wire. 
---
That would mean Vault Tec infiltrated the Enclave...would make for some great quest material.
---
What is a dev item?
---
   
---
Maybe they should leave the game completely stable before continuing to sell garbage 
---
I don't really understand why some people are attacking OP's credibility or attempting to change the subject. This is a very thorough and rational write up as far as I'm concerned. 
---
My wife laughs at me when i get attacked by ghouls and get scared (they do tend to sneak up behind you) but also cheering me on when i kill them. 
---
Yeah then if it does not work can refarm, i was even thinking tokens could be rewards for big events like sbq, make them a little harder to come by but worth the work
---
Grafton Steel always spawns two mobs on the north side of the steel plant on the very edge of the workshop. Super annoying.
---
Like i really hope we see massive balances to weapons in the next patch. Not even joking here lads starting to get really annoyed with the game.

I'm having an issues with the BOS quest, at stage 3 of the transponder portion i crash. about 1-5 min after initiating stage 3. also, Gatling laser ammo is bugged, when you put it into inventory then take it out, the ammo in it becomes the amount of cores you have on you. turning a 457/500 core into a 17/500 core. and ruining it. 
---
No ticket
---
Mass Fusion biggest thing was they made cold fusion possible and are able to power all of Boston on 1 power plant. So why would they not use that to advertise saying they can do it for you too.
---
I didnt like fallout 4 but I loved the time I spent playing in the glowing sea
---
that's the aesthetic im looking for in a fallout game. 
---
&gt; Why did they even fortify Defiance with laser grids? To protect a few holo tapes? There is almost nothing up there on the top floor. Their best tech is the last remaining missile turret.
---
They used to live there. The stuff that's left is what's *left* after the BoS exhausted its resources and was destroyed.
---
I knew about the most recent one and the other one that was patched but that was very informative thanks
---
The latest shit is super fruity. I want Enclave themed SS gear. Log cabin walls. A working camp stove.
---
I would guess it has some truth behind it as the first few hours after the patch on empty servers seemed glorious, but now it’s a different story.
---
I’ve noticed as well if I keep a good FPS on a server or ( my hit miss when they should had not ) I will get disconnected.
---
Agreed....we should be able to move them as we choose it’s just another way to keep people playing 
---
Yeah that's what logic gates helped with in FO4 (check my edit).
---
Lemme check my old method works in 76 and I'll let you know tomorrow. Should be fine though.
---
I'm not scared. I'll take the risk of getting my account soft locked. 
---
Or at least have a price for a respec.
---
What was ur weight?
---
On PC at least there is a logs folder with error stuff in the LauncherLog files. Not being a programmer it doesn't mean anything to me though.
---
Anywhere on the map rad storms were common.  The glowing sea was awesome.  I hope a lot more content is planned for the NW region in 76.
---
Unless you want to spend most of your time finding mats to make ammo, get a melee weapon. I'm a rifleman build and use melee about 80% of the time.
---
I have repaired an entire set of 4 weapons and 2 pieces of my power armor without having any junk in my inventory before, so can confirm.
---
I found my plan for nuke mine through a random mob drop. Its nuke as in nuclear..not a nuka cola cap mine. 
---
Good to know, thanks 
---
I didn’t realise they were actually affecting the amount of times she lands as well, thanks for the heads up
---
Getting penalized for good FPS? Gotta love that. Yea now that you said that I had a crash after my shots were missing and shouldn't have too. 
---
If you're into pvp, and on PS4, I have some people that would be happy to let you try out those end game guns. 
---
Oh and they can also bug out and spawn underground and can often get caught in
---
Buildings etc.
---
I find my favorite defense is chameleon armor and patience. It won't work in every situation, but makes it pretty fun to ambush.
---
They have been. I skulk in some discords and there's regular reports with proof of people being banned. 
---
As far as i know right now, attempting to craft the 300 boards required initially results in you being soft banned. 
---
K9000 Cyberdog gun would also be nice to see in the game.
---
Thanks - another fun fact, that amount of RR while not a lot is enough to let you get into the Whitespring resort if you login into a nuked zone, without dying.
---
Have you sent them to Bethesda? 
---
I do programming but its machines/robots. Not exactly the same thing. 
---
Try to gather wood means click on every log you trip over and you’ll have a thousand scrap in no time.  
---
Welcome!
---
Yes I do. Happened the first time the other day
---
Well people found “weather shells” with different weather effects in the developer room which is commonly believed to have items intended for future release, so you may be in luck!
---
4 times a night is about average for me between disconnects and hard crashes
---
Yes, please! I'm itching for some meaningful open world pvp. 
---
I saw a two shot flamer for sell like a month ago at the white springs station vendor and i passed it up. Really regret that now, it would be great for quickly killing the ghouls at the resort. Tesla rifle is good, but you have to reload every 3 seconds.
---
I've never ran out of time setting up another player after they have hit me first. It feels like you get a good chunk of time after the first hit to manage the situation. Also in most cases, the player trying to hit you keeps doing so, which extends the time. 
---
Regarding caps, it seems to be based on your level yeah. So the stronger the player you face, the more caps you'll get as a reward for winning.  
---
I started doing one but then it just turned out to be a heavy guns build when I realised my explosive flamer wouldn’t heal teammates! 
---
Just south of the water park. Last time someone hit up there I got over 100 raw violet and quite a bit of cobalt as there’s a lot of ferns and blood leaf up there. 
---
Absolutely and it’s way more fun getting stuck in, they were def missing out by hiding
---
I've found that same workshop decently setup and done the same. I even added a few improvements and it held off for a couple mob events pretty well. 
---
And then I got disconnected :/
---
When you die and go to retrieve your paper bag full of junk, use the hot key to enter the transfer menu and then to hit the hot key for “collect all” in succession.   This will avoid situations where you pick up only half your junk before dying again or disconnecting and then losing the half you didn’t finish grabbing.
---
Interesting.  However, I would guess that would only be usable at camp.  The one I caught was natural well away from home.  I stopped everything just to watch it roll through.  Sadly it only lasted a few minutes.
---
If you plan on being in power armor 24/7 use either a radiation suit or a full set of weightless armor with ultra light mods on so they weigh 0. Because when in power armor you take off your armor which makes it useless and a waste of space.  A radiation suit will stop you dieing in nuke zones if you need to craft or repair items. And the weightless stuff is if you are out of your power armor for whatever reason and you wont get 1 shot if enemies sneak up on you.
---
Scrap junk before it goes in the stash.....
---
Fallout 4 also had elevators.
---
Doesnt have to be a vault tech stash box just a regular tool chest or metal container. You guys cant say youve never been in the bunker at some point and wished thier was a stash box there. Tired of leaving the bunk to go to the resort to use there box to go back to the bunker
---
Yeah she won't land if the person she is currently aggro'd to is inaccessible to her melee attacks (so it could be the aggro'd person in any weird spot, not just the shed). You can tell who she's aggro'd to by the direction she is facing. 
---
When I notice her just circling the shed and staring/shouting at it, I run over and scatter the newbies. Thankfully many of them are responsive if I explain. 
---
Good hunting
---
I was having ctd after the patch with no errors and it was my video card. Try turning down your graphics to 720p, worked for me with my older barely minimum spec card. I have not had a ctd sense.... they changed alot more in the patch than what they put in the notes...... anyways it worked for me so Its not going to hurt for y'all to see if it works for you too.
---
Yeah I keep eyes up I drop resources all the time and goodies for the fellow players and today every other bad I would drop would disappear.
---
To avoid this i made sure there was a goodie bag on the floor already before dropping some valuable plans and stuff
---
Yeah, it's server lag.
---
What's the stars on it? I'm willing to buy. 
---
It’s ok. I too love the adorable frogs. Wish we could have pets!
---
Well said 👍
---
Swol frog best frog 
---
alright, I'm moving my valuables to a mule and starting fresh just to be safe. I'll hit you up once I'm done and craft you a couple.
---
you on PC right?
---
yeah chameleon armour is jokes. It's very handy if you yourself have a strong melee or shotgun build
---
Thank you.
---
I am not trying to be a dick but if you dont want to have to level to access new skills and progress your character then why are you playing an RPG? 
---
Killed SBQ and got a nice lev 45 stalkers oxing glove.  So that is all normal.  Killed a 3 star lev 68 super mutant in watoga 10 minutes later and saw a 3 star hunting rifle drop.  Soon as I pissed myself and clicked quick loot, game crashed to dashboard... 
---
Sooo fucking glad I'm a stealth sniper who has no use for a 3 star hunting rifle... *fml*
---
All the conversions are like that. Pipe rifle from .38 to .45 does less as well. 
---
Could we maybe set a limit to the number of duplicate items in your inventory? Say, no more than 1000 of anything except for ammo and raw caps? That way they lose their 10,000 nuka cola's, and 10,000 erroneous caps. It'd discourage mule accounts too, since there is technically infinite carry weight.
---
To take it a step further... what if they made a script that deleted all duplicate legendaries in every single player account's inventory? I feel like the same player getting the same legendary is... extremely unlikely. Unless you found one and purchased another. So maaaaaybe you could have two furious miniguns or something , but three... what are the odds of that?! So maybe delete all legendary duplicates beyond two, if you want to be "fair". 
---
Really, someone should calculate the odds of getting the exact same legendary twice! 3 times! 20 times! 
---
If that’s the case then there aren’t going to be a lot of players left... 
---
Literally the same thing just happen to me about  four hours ago.  Lvl 110 vs my 21.  Destroyed everything.  Killed me 3 times, I did get him once.  Not that it matters shipping
---
It does, thank you
---
    Please.. do not stab other customers while they shop.
---
Lastpass
---
I do have many hours, and I don't intentionally avoid people. Sure I see some people in Watoga here and there but they never really come out to wherever I am randomly or bother me. The only exception is at workshops. Honestly taking a workshop is inviting PVP. Especially since they're completely unnecessary.
---
I have had my camp leveled a couple of times. I just rebuild it with one menu option and move on. If I don't have enough junk, I spend a bit gathering what I need, which is incredibly easy, and repair my camp. It doesn't take hours unless you're just terrible at this game. Are you terrible at this game? It's a mildly inconvenient part of the game, not something to get all upset about. I have little respect for people that pull that shit but like I said, it's not lasting or permanent damage. If you're so delicate that you are actually injured by someone kicking over your digital sandcastle then I would recommend playing another game. 
---
Honestly all you do is make assumptions to try to make your points more valid. I was a moderator of a relatively popular Minecraft community. I know what it's like to actually be griefed in a game. Unlike this game, you couldn't just fix the damages with the click of a button and a little gathering. 
---
I won't change my tune because I'm not a moron. If a group of high level players harass me I'll simply block them and switch servers. Only people that want to play the victim stick around to allow that kind of behavior. You have never been killed with slap damage. Stop lying. Nobody has shown an ounce of proof that it's possible. 
---
Sounds like a zombie movie. I like it
---
Yep.  There are wind turbines owned by Florida Power and Light near Davis WV. The way I understand it, the extra power generated goes to the next power grid who supplies extra power to a separate grid and so on, allowing FPL to purchase additional power from its connecting grid.  Im not a power guy but that's the generalization of it ade it was explained to me.  
---
You say PA is strong, but does it really beat a full set of heavy/dense assaaain's armor?
---
"Some perks like Serendipity (which is one of my favourites) don't work while wearing PA."
---
Whoa did not know that.  
---
One thing I've thought of you didn't mention for dealing with the insane 1 shotters is Mystery Savior.  I wonder if it would catch them off guard, it doesn't seem real well known.
---
Luck is 8. 
---
Gtfo is this actually real? I don’t have time... or the friends :( , to test this but if you’re tolling you should really say so because you know how rumors spread like rad worms in this sub.
---
how many explosive bobbleheads?
---
The group I play with is attempting to do this. So far we have 5 bases around the Pleasant Valley train station. Can't be next door neighbors, but you can live right down the street from one another. 
---
If you go to lay your camp near someone's base you can see a boarder which you have to be past to build. For anyone who didn't know. 
---
The only big draw I see to it is to be able to get stuff out for the vendor. Just collect more from the train station while you’re there clearing out that vendor. If you manage to die between there and the bunker (excepting an active nuke zone) you deserve to lose your loot.
---
As for crafting, I’ve got all that stuff at my camp, and I imagine most anybody high enough in level to enter the bunker does as well. 
---

Haha. That's my power company. I'm by Orlando

And the time before, and the time before....  
---
Dupers find a way. 
---
The only problem I have with the deathclaw gauntlet, power fist, and death tambo, there may be others, but we can't use them in power armor. There are times where Inwant the extra protection of PA, but then I have to choose a different melee weapon, and I just really like the power fist. 
---
This game has rad storms!?

I kid, I kid. I *think* I saw one once.

PS4 issue here, whenever I fast travel to harpers ferry, my character can move around and pick stuff up and interact with the world around him. If only I could see any of it. The screen just goes black and makes the game unplayable. Fast traveling anywhere else doesnt remove the black screen either  The only way to fix this issue is to delete my save data and re log into the game. Which i have done twice now. Hasnt happened until the most recent update . 
---
On top of that, loading screen issues have arisen. Sound will cut in and out, the game will try to load in early only to cut back to loading screens and load back in into a dtate where i cant move my dude for several minutes. 
---
I just want to play my game man. I can tolerate duplicators and roaming vigilantes destroying everyone's bases and stealing harvested loot. But now im ready to join the whole "this game is still an alpha game" bandwagon. 
---
Please make a private lobby or something for people who just want to play with some friends. If we could stay away from the servers all this exploitation was happeining on maybe these issues would never arise.

Maybe you killed a wanted player and his teammate is automatically in combat with you. Anyway the link above is proof oneshot pvp doesnt exist when not in combat.

I saw an interview with Todd, or possibly someone else from Bethesda, about why you never see ladders in Elder Scrolls or Fallout games (other than those that act like doors). Apparently it's been a lot of trouble getting them in the engine and they don't really see a reason to add them since they don't offer much benefit.
---
I just want to see more weather in general, especially rain. I never see it and its so calming to me.

Or you befriend a hermit crab with the perk and your base is straight up pedo central
---
Haha. What rage? Get over yourself bro. 
---
Thing is for me, I havent played much in a while..not even since the whole issue with items getting players banned. Also, I am not one that trades with other players. I just dont play enough to do anything to get banned so i habe no idea whats going on.
---
Well, you had the balls to say it. I feel like I owe Bethesda a little bit of forgiveness. I hated on the game and playing it for like a month and a half. I tried to do a nuke zone in just a hazmat suit. I've seen some people do it. But I suck and I'm level 43 and I had alright armor and none of the Marine stuff I keep hearing about and it was one hell of a fail
---
You would know.  It rolled right over me.  I could see it approaching and hear the crazy rad lightning.  Sky went a crazy rad green in the thick of it and rad meter was making that glorious sound.

I was just discussing my most recent AAA purchases to point out how76 has gotten rightful criticism, but it's being paraded through the streets like it's the worst and only offender.

Mass Effect, Battlefield, Anthem all come to mind as well.

Don't get me wrong, the points you make don't have any relation with ppl being asses and spreading "fake news". Also being rude to him won't make bethesda fix their game either

Very good game. Very stable. Very cool.

Do you actually have the quest? Try re-reading the notice in the helipad terminal.

For the storage room key, you need to look in the lockers in the bunkhouse. Inside the storage room is the password for the camp's command center.

I imagine this might look better in PA.

Hi hi! Yes, Im on PC. Currently at work though. Will be home in about 4 hrs. Will you be around then?

Its happened to me a few times. 1.) Move your bench 2.) Sometimes moving the items from your stache into your player inventory can allow you to do it. 3.) Return to main menu and move to new server. 
---
You should have asked if they had a warrant.
---
Would love to see some serious weapon balancing lads in the next patch just number tweaks. Because really starting lose it here. I want to swap off my TSE shotgun but my weapon of choices are fucked lol.
---
Just getting a tad bored of the game and would love to be able to atleast try different weapons out like my love for the flamer.
---
Fuck no. They haven't even responded to my inquiry about why they said "a couple days" when it's been over a month now. It's like their support went on extended vacation (started a couple weeks before Christmas and still isn't back).
---
From what I have seen, he the only spawn at night. They fly away at dawn even if they are fighting you. 
---
This is new to F076 too, in the past games I looted what they used.
---
I wouldnt mind more general rain.  The endless blinding sunrises are cool, but a good dawn rain would be cool too.
---
They’re being very poor in their communication and not handling any of the recent events well. 
---
I trade a lot and several paints I got through trades that I thought were rare, are apparently not allowed yet? I’m not taking off my Sentinel paint, so I’m just sitting here waiting for my ban..

Sucks, because I actually enjoy the game. 
---
Asking.
---
This guy has a serious rage boner for witch hunting dupers.
---
He accuses anyone who doesn't agree with his points of being a duper.
---
After he baselessly accused me yesterday, I had a good look at his post history and sent him the following message, which he never responded to:
---
So you admit to playing with, knowing, and extensively conversing with dupers, who have apparently explained the process to you.
---
You have one or more TSE weapons you claim are legit. Hmm.
---
You have facilitated trades on reddit for at least calibrated shocks, who knows where they came from.
---
You admit in another post to "trying" an exploit, so obviously you are open to doing so.
---
I still wouldn't accuse you of being a duper.
---
I will accuse you of being a shitty person.
---
It felt like a zombie movie. I didn't even know they were around until they made their entrance.
---
Create a new character just as an experiment. First 15 levels go with Luck. See how the rest of the game goes. I was finding 3☆ Legendary items of of random Crown monsters. All weapons sell higher due to the condition you find them at. 
---
That was dumb of you. 
---
I watched the YouTube Grohlvana do that quest and when he had to get in line again because of the birth certificate part he jokingly raged and quit the game but then it immediately backfired on him when he realized him quitting reset the entire quest back to the beginning LOL the fucking look on his face. “Wait... this is just a joke right Bethesda is just trolling me”
---
i was doing a mission and ended up in blackwater mine, meanwhile whitesprings got nuked and someone invited me who was in the nuked zone gave me a hazmat suite and did the "follow me" emote i tagged the glowing ones an they one shot them with a TSE weapons so i was getting like 300-700 xp for each one i tagged. This was before recent patch to consoles yesterday.  still really good xp but not as much from what i can tell. i was about level 15 my first day and second day i went from 15 to 28 farming the nuked zone today my third day playing im 32 currently.
---
The Tinker table, not chemistry.
---
Getting this issue now. Following for resolution! 
---
Gunsmith (because laser weapons are fun), Stabilized (because I dont care about your armor), Power Patcher (Power Armour Tank mode!), Power User (because jetpacks), First Aid (because healing factor mutations are fun unless you are in the middle of a big fight), Batteries Included (because I want to live in my power armour), Pharmacist (because someone nuked whitesprings and I want to stay here forever), Demolition Expert (why else am I carrying this missile launcher, broadsider and fatman around for).
---
So yeah I just sink 28 point into intelligence why not (spoiler alert: I am joking, it maxes out at 15 in case someone thought I was being serious :P  ).

The phantom weight bug was caused mostly by ppl not realizing misc items and noyes have weight. So even naked with no ammo and gear. You still have to carry those Bobby pin

The only thing that will spread will be the feeling of joy in your body after you and your newly found friend are able to buy back the same burnt book from a Whitespring bunker vendor. Just remember this mantra: 3, 2, 1, Purchase.

I was in the area last night pulling the obs off the people killing the queen. But I am lower level, so it was a lot of grab and kite. I was not sure it was helping, but I figure fewer mobs interrupting the damage dealers had to be good.
---
Ah, I was using that cave recently. Never was attacked by SB’s, but it WAS the most random camp I have had thus far in regards to mob spawns. When I first found it, there was a group of supermutants outside, including a legendary. So seeing that I decided fuck yea I’ll lay down camp here, maybe get lucky and have a legendary spawn hen I load in or something. But from there I had a Wolfpack attack, and then mole rats, and then the annoying ass little robots (I forget what they are called at the moment), and even walked out of the cave to find a moth man waiting on me... I’ve never had so many different enemy types attack my camp.
---
Hey I wish I had that. I've ran so many silos just to have the queen fly off because five people come in and just kill little stuff. I've started dropping away from prime a little and hoping she still spawns
---
The question he answered about that was referencing a server list, as in choosing which server to join. His meaning is pretty clear in context. 
---
Honestly don't care if you don't believe me random person on the internet.  I know that I have been killed in one shot while I had pacifist mode on. And today I was killed in 2 shots while I had pacifist mode on. Both times by people that were destroying my camp and had bounties on them.
---
There was a Beta but there is no free trial
---
i didn't know that thank you for that info

---
I consistently do more damage to the queen than a group of 6 guys with TSE/melee builds combined. Although TSEs are better than normal weapons (except for one wink wink), they are still worthless at the queen.
---
Bobblehead stackin is the problem imo

They somehow managed to make killing a mutated freak monster with a chainsaw knife suck.

I got royally schooled by a vengeful mothman between the waste disposal and Whitesprings station. The noise attracted a mob of ghouls who couldn't just let me have a one on one.

fo76 takes place earlier than the rest of the games right? if so then there should be fresh glowing craters that are still highly irradiated 
---
i recently watched a video about vendors and how some can occasionally even sell some fairly decent legendary weapons and armor. I will also have to keep reminding myself to pick up and scrap duplicates of weapons for the mods thanks for the reminder on that.

This! I want a map that is like

I agree completely.  I took down a 3* super mutant and a 3* feral ghoul today and didn't get a legendary item, from either of them.
---
is there a list of those unreleased items i can check out?

Trade "stealing":
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag9j5s/psa_the_trade_glitch_getting_patched_shortly/
---
I thought these were patched but only one is. Like the example in OP, pre-patch you could queue up a request for an item, wait for them to accept the trade, and then request "trash". The other person would just mash the button to give you the trash and could accidentally sell you items they did not intend to sell since it would not appear immediately in the offers window, plus the items menu likes to rearrange itself during transactions. This is patched (well, the _queuing_ part is). I really doubt anyone except a few pranksters (read: me) were stealing anything with this method.
---
As for duping, the slowest, easiest, and most braindead method still works and has been reported since beta. It causes no instability. If anyone has a clue how to contact Bethesda without getting a canned response of "we cannot restore inventory items" ..... You let me know.
---
Yeah that's true, a perk Respec option would also be great
---
[I mean, this is the Dragon you're talking about.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical)  What else could it be other than this?
---
There’s wind farms here in Missouri that also supply power to east coast grids. 
---
dead baby jokes never die
---
The disgusting implication being that if you mess up the timing, you can do it all over again for a small loss of caps, since one of you got the item?
---
I agree.  
---
Plus this burnt book sharing method is the most stable of them all. No disconnections or server instability. Be sure to have Hard Bargain 3 equipped though, buying back a burnt book can get expensive after you share with your entire friends list.
---
When I was much lower level a 90 or 100 player showed up while I was at the vendor. I wasn't AFK, and they just didn't want to wait at all and instigated with me. I didn't quite get how pvp worked yet so I hit them back and they one-hit me dead with a melee. 
---
I very much agree.
---
Yeah, I am. My IGN is Legosi. Thank you so much
---
I actually said this to my housemates having to go get paperwork then being told I’m in the wrong place and to make it better I was doing it with six other players that I’d never met

I've seen him in Toxic Dried Lakebed. And in the day time. Was still damn creepy.

What do you think about the charged capacitor change on laser gatling?
---
I'm pretty disappointed.
---
I've seen plenty of furious black powder weapons.
---
I won't lie, I'm always tempted, but as I understand it furious requires you land hits within a specific time window.  At least with the Dragon, I'm pretty sure it's impossible to pull off.
---
I can't believe people take issue with a stash being in the fucking bunker... Jesus christ... 
---
Nice.. too bad they don't have any turbines near the blackwater mine in the game.  You could visit the area from where your power is supplemented. Hahaha. 
---
What's funny is you were arguing yesterday that witnessing definitive bobblehead dupers is becoming more common.
---
Now you are saying you are seeing less of it in the last few days.

So which is it?

You can’t post something posing as an authoritative know it all and then get something as essential as duping wrong.

I guess those are the fissure sites?  I have yet to get that far in the game.  I saw only one on a wild run at lvl 16 to watoga to find the handmade plans.  I didn't linger as I was not where I belonged and was hiking solo.

Any tips on where to find a hazmat suit?

Yes, there are jackasses on the servers who try to make you believe they're out to get the evil crime lords who are duping everything. I have a story about that as well.
---
About a week ago, I brought my alt online and built him a little shack by Vault 76. He's basically my shop bitch, so he has all my sale goods and whatnot. So, about 10 minutes after I finished building the shop, some level 200+ guy came over. He was in PA and I remember seeing his name and thinking this probably won't end well. His name was "Meta Police". He hopped on my shack for a few seconds and looked around. My idiot ass didn't just hurry up and log off the server, no no...i went on about my business and started adding stations outside, when this fuck face started taking a super sledge to my shack, for literally no reason. Just to be a dick. It didn't take much to fix everything, but the fact these idiots can come over and just wreck your camp is a little ridiculous. So, OP, I feel your pain. People like this will make actual new players be like "nope, not gonna deal with these idiots" and just never give the game a chance and also will end up chasing off people who have played but simply don't want to deal with that sort (or any sort) of griefing. 
---
I've honestly never spent more than an hour in a DMV and even then that was my driver's test

Personally it doesn't sound like you were hacked or compromised. if somebody manually set you up and got into your account the first thing you would do is change your email address. If you are able to reset your password and receive the link via email then obviously this hasn't happened. 
---
When I first signed up for Bethesda the  similar thing you are seeing happened to me. I had to wait till the next day, reset the password again and it seemed to work, I have not had an issue since. I'm not saying it's the same issue, just similar. And given Bethesda lately, maybe there was a screw up.

/r/falloutlore disliked that bullshit idea

Not an official list per se but there are YouTube videos you can find of people exploring the room and it shows some of the items in there. Mostly apparel and paint jobs is what I’ve heard about though. Just search fallout 76 developer room.

You risk a temp ban fyi

I haven't seen a list, but I did catch a youtube video, sorry no link, popped on my news feed.
---
The video I saw explored every box so if played in half time you could probably glean more info.
---
About as rare as a TSE per piece this is hands down the armor to PvP in, that's why I went for it tbh.
---
It also chaps my ass that I drop a 3-star mob only to have someone beat me to it and when I loot it, it's completely empty.
---
I wait, and check again.  Empty.
---
Wait some more -- getting beat on by mobs and returning fire all the while -- check again, still nothing.
---
Rinse, repeat.  Legendaries turn up non-elite mobs occasionally, but rarely.  I think the server bollocks the loot tables, but also the looting rights.  If I kill a mob solo, don't allow some level 29 to run up and loot it.  Please.

The best part is the form letter if you send in a ticket...

&gt;Greetings,

&gt;Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support.  
---
&gt;Junk is collected in Fallout 76 and is used primarily for crafting of objects for Settlements and Workshops. It is also used in the creation / repairing / modification of armor and weapons.   
---
&gt;**What happens to my junk when I die?**  
---
&gt;When your character dies, all the junk that your character is currently holding will be dropped in a bag. This bag is lootable by players and mobs in the area. These items will also be deleted if you log off the server or don't pick it up quickly. Items such as weapons, ammo, holotapes, AID, armor, etc will not be dropped.  
---
&gt;**How do I avoid losing my junk?**  
---
&gt;The only safe place to store your stuff is in your Stash. "Stash" containers can be found throughout Appalachia.  Any other location or container, including corpses, power armor, or your base that's not your stash, will result in those items being lost. Don't drop items in the world to trade with other players. Be sure to use the Trading system built into the game to avoid losing your stuff.  
---
&gt;**If you crash or log out, any junk left in the world that was not in your Stash or character inventory will be lost.**   
---
&gt;Bethesda Customer Support does not have the ability to restore lost junk.  
---
&gt;Best regards,

Yeah I saw that too but realized i wasn't loosing ammo it was just showing how much was used by saying it was removed
---
Don't drop it. If in your stash, put them in inventory, then place each of them down. They still remain yours and you can interact with them. For 60 seconds at least. Names don't change.
---
That mask you find in the asylum... Tried wearing it a while but kept scaring myself whenever I saw it.
---
Not tse obviously but two shot yes and I believe (don’t quote me tho) quads which can be helpful. Explosive weapons are heavy and so is their ammo so if that’s gonna be a problem I’d say just go for a nice TSE shotgun (with a large spread its basically a grenade launcher, low spread and it’s a sniper lol) and you’ll be good to go 
---
True 
---
Well I never claimed all of my legendaries dropped for me, just my TSE lever and one piece of my armor. I traded extraneously for the rest. 
---
I swapped servers while at whitespring so I could VISUALLY see players in front of me, and in the building.
---
And I agree, but fight broken with broken right?
---
Also, whenever you go to set a price for a item during trading, if you press the left trigger to set the price to 0, itll skip straight to 25000.

The thing is, just because someone can think of a “better way” something should be implemented doesn’t mean that’s how it’s meant to be played. I grew up playing games how they were launched. If things change while I’m playing these newer games I’ll adjust. I’m just not the type to spew my opinions of how games “should be” when I’d rather try to figure out how the be the best at what is presented to me. This is just my style tho. I don’t find fun in what I expect, I find fun in figuring stuff out and trying to maximize what’s available to me. If I always got what I wanted, games would be boring and I don’t think enough people realize that. Limitations push creativity. This game has perks. Limited perks. Lock pick is one of these perks. Key work, “perks”. You decide what perks matter, and what perks you are willing to give up for others. Choose wisely fellow dwellers. It’s your journey, but you can’t have it all!

I've heard that there's actually a pretty disgusting 30 second window for all people to buy back items. But I haven't tested it. I've seen it work with about a 5-10 second difference though. A friend was like "I already hit accept" and I was like "What??? It was 3, 2, 1 purchase? You already bought it?" and he was like "Uh, yeah" and I was like "Oh, there's still a burnt book copy available for me too" Then I bought it.
---
I guess it takes a while for a burnt book to simmer down.

Because oneshot in pvp when not in combat isnt possible.

I would like to be able to pull the mod off of a weapon to reuse later period. I don't even care if it is legendary.

LoL yup, that's the one!

I run both a bloodied melee build and a bloodied/explosive or TSE Gatling Gun ranged build depending on where my health currently is for ranged.  I have a lot of fun doing both, and with running both it means I can knock the SB's out of the sky or ground either way.
---
It’s a bug. Some sessions if you stay right there at that location the whole ground will end up covered in various assorted items. 
---
It was due to my armor, not a bug. I've recreated the same situation against explosive; shotguns, rifles, and melee
---
Yeah I’ve seen that happen a lot with legendaries, sometimes when a legendary item gets generated it spawns on the ground and can fall through the world instead of spawning on the corpse it belongs to
---
Interesting never seen it happen don't usually log out at whitesprings but was up to late 😆 Seen a lot of items but didn't think to try an pick um up figured it wouldn't let me lol.
---
Nah these stories aint that interesting I played through them. Play up until level 30. By then you will most of what the game offers you and then you can decide whether you wanna play or give up. I gave up after 40levels or something. Waiting until they ban dupers, fix the game and basically change it or add new content. Until then, waster 60$ like an idiot even tho I saw everyone warning about it.
---
I'm sure that was quite unnerving, but.... LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL

If your just doing it for show wander around the forest and pick up as much wood as possible I spent 15 min searching for wood in the forest and got alot of xp and 200 wood

Haha good point, dirt works the same as gun oil right?
---
Not sure, I dont think there would be an option for it in the menu. Good luck though, I hope B. fixes it soon.
---
Their track record so far gives me hope.
---
Gatling Plasma is just shit, breaks down after 5 sec

Why this thing even exist in this game, if we can't even use it normally?

The tse bb gun at level 50 would be perfect for hunting rad rats, mole rats, and rad roaches.

If you're not diametrically opposed to one another, refusing to stimpack someone who's down is utterly baffling to me.
---
They're hilariously easy to come by or craft, you're saving someone a lot of headache, it can help you complete whatever you're doing, and...it's just kind of polite?
---
I've only ever refused to stimpack someone once.  I was playing with a friend, and she went down while I was fast traveling to her.  The other person doing the event just casually took her stuff, and later went down themselves.
---
While she was handling the objective, I walked over to them, thumbs downed, then took most of the loot bag.  They seemed to get the message.
---
Journey beats the destination, in my opinion. I've had an enormously fun time just exploring and crafting. Around 220 hours completely solo.

I Know But It'd be faster and cooler to just name it what you want and I mean the name of that item will reset not the object.

Check your spam folder. It is a mass ban by Bethesda. You should have an email that arrived very soon after the email notifying you about a change to your account

I've searched all the lockers in the camp and even after server hopping Ive had no luck with the key.  I don't know if that key stays in your inventory like a lot of others.  I remember having to go into that room and the room accessed by the terminal during the main quest. I also remember having to get a supply drop there at the helipad,  but don't remember if that was part of the BOS quest or not.  Last night when I was trying to figure out why I couldn't interact with the deep box,  I did try and activate the quest via the terminal at the helipad but no luck. 
---
lol that explains a lot...thanks
---
If you have the armor that makes you take less damage when you stand still you can get some crazy synergy out of it. Otherwise its just more of a background perk that its pretty good for just regular running around.
---
Nice catch. That's awesome!!!

What platform 
---
That's what I'm talking about. He was one-shot killing people in pacifist mode.
---
Oh I didnt even know they changed anything with it. I started to run out of fusion cores recently (use a jetpack and havent built up the power user perks yet) so I have had the ammo to run the gataling laser since the update. What is the charged capacitor change they made?
---
Or just block them ingame.
---
Completely disagree. Building up a character and choosing skills from many options and having to make hard choices about what you get and what you don’t get is a big part of RPGs. If you can switch perk cards and SPECIAL points whenever, then essentially everyone’s character is the same. Boring. 
---
I once found 2 ghoul slayers grognak axes in one whitesprings run that were exactly the same except durability, so it is possible, but i think most would agree the good far outweighs the bad. Id gladly lose a copy of a weapon i already have if they fixed duplication 
---
You don’t even have to hit the mobs in D3. We PL people by having them just wait at the rift entrance and we clear the floor, they loot, we move on to the next floor. 300 paragons in 1 rift. 
---
In your broken english I think you are having issues with the Ghoul quest @ whitesprings golf club?
---
If so you need to tag them so that you still get the kill count.
---
Turn on pacifist mode, and use nades as an e.g.
---
Welly welly wellington. That sums it up. I need some friends.
---
Flamers aren’t alone. The basic LMG eats ammo like crazy and is practically useless against anything  with even a tiny DT.  The laser Gatling has a similar problem.  Even the Two-shot variants don’t do all that well (though they’re greatly improved over their non-legendary version). 
---
Durability of the plasma gatling is shockingly bad.  You may get ~4 cores worth of use then it’s broke again. Same for laser rifles. I kicked ass with an auto laser rifle I picked up when I was lvl 45. It broke stupid quick though and I abandoned all energy guns as a result. 
---
Now I think of that might be it, thanks a lot!! Still stupid that deduct from your current health
---
Even a kidney? Its fairly rubbish imo.
---
Kinda sad that this post got gold when it has already been stated in this sub before.  Seems our community is terribly uniformed about the game.  
---
LOL this sounds amazing. Wish there was a clip
---
You know, I'd much prefer that they just cut way down on the number of legendary enemies.  Have every enemy drop an amazing weapon, but drastically reduce the number or legendary enemies.  That could work. 
---
That sounds better than legendary enemies all over the place dropping things like a wooden life-saving arm. 
---
Yeah of course you go afk when you are standing up and in vendor menu. 
---
Not when you are sneaking in the corner of the same place being perfectly safe from all NPC enemies.
---
Yeah that's sarcasm. 
---
 I haven't seen anyone being AFK on vendor. Doesn't make any good damn sense. Probably a great idea though since that increases the likehood of some player aggroing on you and then possibly killing you when they see you are AFK.
---
If that happens enough time to actually warrant complainng, it must happen on vendors I don't deal often.
---
Kinda sad that this post got gold when it has already been stated in this sub before.  Seems our community is terribly uniformed about the game.
---
All that is an issue as well i was just focused on the flamer as i was shocked by it. But all of what you just said adds fuel to the issue.
---
Where is the weapon balance?.
---
4 cores and it breaks... like that cannot be how its intended lol.
---
DR wise it's still higher than excavator. To keep things interesting for me i only use raider / trapper armour, power fist and my trusty 2 shot ( non exploding) pipe rifle.
---
This did happen to me yesterday on XBOX. Logged in and once I thought it was fully loaded I pulled up my pip boy. Pip boy was blank and I couldn’t do anything, nothing responded to the controller except  switching to the map. My game was not frozen — things were still going on; I just couldn’t move my character.  So I fast travelled,  the blank pip boy was still up, but I was able then to pull out a weapon, which lowered the pip boy, but again my controls were non responsive.  As I was taking rads (all the displays were still functional), I gave up and  rebooted the game, which fixed it.  
---
Pretty sure you do, as it's only rank 3 that completely negates limb damage.
---
I think he’s talking about the golfer ghouls not spawning (because they don’t spawn at high level). Due to all the high level players the spawns are all high level (therefore not the “ghoulfers”)
---
Damage bump. It's not much. The charging caps fire much more slowly and did very little damage. Now my menu says charging caps do roughly double damage as normal caps. The fire rate is kind of comparable to Gatling with a speedy receiver, but much less damage per hit.
---
Still only really usable with Martial Artist.
---
ive seen pics of people building with brick walls. Are these plans dropped or only on the Atom store?
---
I meant 15 minutes a day on Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, but then longer on the weekend.
---
Queenie!!! That’s hilarious. What platform are you on
---
IIRC that’s from repaired above 100%.  
---
And I tried a flamer once and the way it ate through ammo (and I bring unable to craft enough to feed it) caused me to abandon it quick. I held on with the LMG as I could make stupid amounts of UC 308, but it still had a vociferous appetite. 
---
Pc you?

Okay. Thx for replying

Same, aspect ratio solves nothing

What platform are you on? Seems we have similar styles, and i think youd appreciate my work also, as id like to see yours "in person" if possible
---
Oh my god, I was at whitesprings yesterday and there was a Medics Broadsider on the floor. Looked so much better then a paper bag (although I could not pick it up). It would be cool if they did add this in for everything although then there would also be spoiled meat and vegetables all over the map :P
---
Yeah I'd imagine so. The player model in the preview looks like such a dork, definitely not looking tough at all haha. 
---
I've been alone at Whitesprings at level 100+ and had then spawn several times in the last week.
---
I don't think it's the higher levels, I think they're like Evan was and they only spawn once. 
---
Server hopping at the white springs golf course they will eventually show up then just tag then with a grenade like suggested it a machine gun while on pacifist.
---
Weird seeing someone right there just goofing around with the weapon when people write about it like some like of legend. Hah, neat dude.
---
Don't support it.
---
I don't care either way, but a couple tips if you're struggling with this.
---
Anything you craft (including bulking) goes to your inventory. So if you're just trying to drain caps from the armory literally just turn around.... And bulk some crap up.
---
Me too. I would have loved to relive the first moment since early childhood where I nearly pissed myself!  Maybe it will happen again and I can figure out how it triggers them spawning up there.
---
These were 2 separate sbqs. Not sure if you have to alter the blast radius or the site you deploy he nuke from
---
Thank you =)
---
Hey no problem! Glad to hear someone likes these posts haha. 
---
We have someone in a shitty english tv show called queenie. Shes a bitch from what i remember. Also. Try and only have 3 people. More is harder 
---
That and make servers even more unstable unless they put a timer in them like 60 seconds but even then with enough people you could easily crash.
---
You can have all except herbivore and carnivore together. 
---
I actually love my pipe revolver. I've been using one since level 1, now level 96. Clears up trash mobs, even high level ones (like level 68 scorched in a few hits). 
---
You can't have Herbivore and Carnivore at the same time. Cannibal is a perk card.
---
I mean my point was just that even if you don’t think a heavy gunner build is viable for end game stuff, it’s still fun to run around with them.
---
No way to remove select mutations yet that I know of. That’s why most people just add the ones they want using serums. 
---
Agreed man.
---
I’ve been shot at with an explosive weapon in pacifist mode before and have never died. I thought this was debunked already.
---
These To The (person[s]) That (did a thing) at (place) are extending to NPCs now?
---
Be aware the plan is named ‘lever gun’ and therefore not very clear :/ I got mine at the responder vendor in Grafton itself.
---
You’re better than a lot of people for returning it. Many would have just said they never found it and wandered off with their new TSE and claim it was a legitimate drop if questioned. 
---
Never seen it happen with player dropped weapons but I’ve watched muties pick up Miniguns from a dead comrade and resume firing. 
---
I like the building currently running a trap base atm
---
So true!
---
The way I figure it is I can take out a lvl 80 on my own and have been forced to take 3 lvl 50 scorchbeast on occasion at Lewisburg so I believe I contribute. But on occasion I’m seen multiple players under level 10 And I have no idea why they even showed up
---
You can get every mutations through serums specific to each mutation. You are unable to specifically get rid of one mutation as far as I know but getting rank 3 “Class freak” in the luck skill tree reduces all negative effects from mutations by 75%.
---
Excellent! Thanks heaps. Wish I knew that before I logged out and missed out on a golf course nuke zone
---
This game is extremely enjoyable solo but in my opinion getting to know some higher leveled people is definitely a good idea for that occasional grind session. I recently tagged along for a Queen scorchbeast fight and while i couldn't do anything really it was still cool to tag along and get some random gear out of it. I play this game solo a lot of the time.
---
I like them, I just wish they had a few different colours.
---
I'm on PS4 and am having the same problem. If anyone finds a fix, let me know. My TV is an LG 43LJ500M if that helps.
---
I had ONE TSE drop for me. It is a two shot explosive lever action with damage resist while reloading. It does near 2k damage when my low health procs
---
Damnit so i have to somehow radaway until herbivore is gone and hope i dont pick it up before carnivore. Ok guess next question is best plant options
---
i might havr some pa armor plans need to check tmrrw
---
For a minute I thought I had to take his number to skip in line.

Me too! High level muties and charred ferals all the time.

Yes, I didn’t know if you knew, aligning w/BOS And final quest gets you ultracite PA.
---
Aligning w/enclave gets you x01
---
My main needs to do camp McClintock if it wants to join enclave or BOS 
---
Just keep an eye on whitespring and when you see low lvls there hop over and look for them.. I put it off 'til lv 150 but once I was actually paying attention I cleared it pretty quick. 
---
Yea i rock Class Freak plus Radicool and keep rads at 50/50 of my hp. So i need to find how to get the carnivore serum. honestly im level 145 and ive never come across a serum
---
Yeah right you kept it IP ban him beth he's lying it's just bait to sell it in PMs plz report post thanks
---
Those bobbleheads are how they can one shot you even in pacifist...
---
Just radaway until you get rid of herbivore then replace any other you lost. Can generally find people selling the serums for any mutation for about 500c
---
Try going into the TV settings and turning on scan to fit
---
No they would attack any remaining communist threat(any sort of group). I've ran into people that will attack others for giving items to other players just trying to help out the little guy. Similar scenario that we have with griefers and anti griefers.
---
NPCs commiting suicide to jump scare players is a lot less common than people leveling camp, duping in the middle of nowhere, or dropping random supplies. I found the situation funny and wanted to share...  Not sorry?
---
This needs more attention. Not that I frequent this sub on the daily or anything, but this is the first I’ve seen someone propose this. (Due to laziness, haven’t posted this myself)
---
100% agree... ideally u would be able to cycle through perk load outs without going into the PIP boy menu
---
How much of the map have you explored? 
---
Wasnt it like that in the beta? If i remember corrctly it was a hidden nerf in the first patch
---
Yeah, that's true. You don't have to hit them. ...unless you're a DH. Then it's just a matter of pride to tickle them and escape.

How late are you on? I usually don't play till like 1am est

If they start bringing in fallout new Vegas items, then they better let me get some dog tag fists. I loved using those to fight deathclaws.

My books are first editions, I'm not reducing the value of MY burnt books. No one touches my burnt books...

I just put that on to see if it mitigates. That plus good doggy, i dont see a downside now. Still would rather have carnivore. Tasty scorchbeast hearts and brains i crave
---
Just had someone blow me away in pacifist mode Bethesda. I don't enjoy your fucking pvp shit don't force us to deal with it and its shit system please.
---
Yeah, it feels really tedious. I honestly pefer the system they had in fallout 4.
---
I mean, nowhere close to 95%, but yes, there are a lot of assets reused, since 76 started out as a multiplayer expansion for 4. The question, though, is whether the particular sign in question actually appeared in 4. If it wasn't in 4, then it being in 76 can hardly be considered a lazy oversight. Personally, I don't remember seeing it anywhere.
---
You too! :)

I heard it is also because of the Dev cell items. People are getting banned that have those items, which surprise, almost every duper has those unobtainable items

Tran-Sexual Evolution
---
Not sure didn't play the beta I got the game a couple weeks late. It's still a crappy deal regardless. I just probably got the best melee drop ever for me anyways except it's lvl 40. An I killed the robot in 1 shot as it was fighting a deathclaw. Furious grog with swing and reduced. Still a bad axe for lvl 40
---
PSN: Shiro_0okaru add me if you want :)
---
Also, probably balance reasons. If you could stack power armor and legendary gear you'd probably never get out of your power armor. I honestly think that power armor should be expensive to use and maintain. Not so much that it's no longer a valid choice, but it shouldn't be easy to live in it. 
---
Either you get to be a giant walking talk, or you can run the higher danger scenario with reduced damage resistance to have legendary effects.

Also, Mole Rat Chunks add +1 STR.

I forgot about party perk and Nerd rage perk.

I haven't been using nerd because I prefer to run closer to 30% hp than below 20%...fewer accidents that way.

You can also buy one from Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga shopping plaza.

Uh, you mean commie traitors vs captains of industry?

It just seemed like the nicest thing to do really. It's pretty nifty that enemies can pick up Legendaries though!

However, I do hope I don't fight another TSE wielding Scorched again anytime soon, I died faster than I could blink!

Because Int skills making high tech weapons useable works thematically as a solution

I have been having extremely long loading times. Has that happened to you?
---
I now have all thx to Reddit, except for carnivore and empathy, while I do have herd mentality I don't notice any change in damage taken due to being over buffed from all other mutations. Plus my build allows for having the flexibility for melee, sniper, shotgun, heavy weps, stealth, using PA or not, farming mats, the list goes on all by just changing a few perks. S 15, P 6, E 3, C 4, I 11, A 10, L 7.

I get this one a lot.  The other is when I leave a workstation and preemptively hit a directional key as I anticipate walking away, I instantly go back into the workstation menu.  It's annoying, and every time I do it I tell myself I deserved it for not remembering to not do that.  But at least the transition back to workstation isn't as long as the one when you accidentally click a chair or a bed.  
---
Me handy saw was in Automation, but chainsaw, golf club, Bowie knife, single action revolver, Gatling gun, Gatling plasma, light machine gun, and .50 machine gun are all new.
---
I've been packing a Gatling Laser for a long time, struggled to figure out where it fit. Gatling Plasma was an early answer to Scorchbeasts, especially with some modifications. Over the past week or two had an OK legendary plasma drop, not much better than my old one, but had an explosive gatling drop. Modded that with severe, and that thing is pretty vicious! But short of being explosive, gatling lasers are hardly worth the fusion cores. And, at least before the recent patch, the charging barrels were a horrible mistake to add to them.
---
Not sure how to get serum plans as I’m level 48 myself but you could try putting a post out if you are on console or try the subreddit. I was able to buy every serum I needed at about 250 caps each.

This is the flawed logic that people who don't understand how MMO games work keep using to justify it. Unfortunately your perception that "everyone is doing it" isn't actually true most of the time.
---
"Everybody is doing it and nobody's been banned yet, they can't even track  anything" is usually a pretty common statement up until the ban-waves start.

No, half the players won't be banned, most of us aren't that dumb and like our accounts.

I’ve never attacked another players CAMP, and I disagree. We’ve already seen some trap bases and clever ways for wanted players to hide. They should be destructible.

I would pull the points from elsewhere. There are less important stats for a rifleman. Perception should be max for sure.
---
Yes!!! I want a useable energy shotgun ♥️
---
Strength probably, right?
---
While I know there's probably spots I've missed, at least right now I don't see undiscovered locations much, if at all.
---
Happened to me and didn’t get the menu until a scorchbeast started destroying my camp (probably shouldn’t build near fissure sites) and by menu I mean about 10 of them since I kept trying to craft not knowing about the glitch. I cleared all the menus and somehow killed the SB but it still sucked. 
---
I LOVE driving through Davis and the Mt. Storm area.  Those turbines are amazing to look at, and they stretch for as far as the eye can see.  I would've liked to have seen a nod to that in the game. 
---
AFK timer is 30 minutes so if someone being AFK is that terrible you can either hop or they will just disappear eventually. I think the mechanic is totally broken and wasn't thoroughly thought of. We were told you can play this game solo. So I should feel perfectly safe sitting in a station for AFK or something.
---
As someone about to make a ranged alt because he's tired of melee, this is very disheartening.

I had to completely reset my Xbox and reload for mine to come back

Open a claim ticket, keep your private eye/snitching between yourself and BGS. Also they don't have the tools to do anything like unique ID and especially any "simple inventory checks", but GL.
---
That ultimate slowness happens around 4x your carry weight.
---
Unfortunately.. because Bethesda has relied on modders to fix their broken games for yeeeeears
---
Best tip is don’t worry about saving stuff.   You will never end up using that 3 star pool cue.
---
Coffee morning in the shed...This is video game cowardice. And somehow I feel like it fits perfectly within the Fallout universe.
---
I'd be pissed too, though.
---
Yeah and then it seems like it’s loaded to then start loading again. I never had any problems intill today. Not for a while anyways
---
Same, I've seen them frequently this week whereas I would never see them before (and got lucky finally finishing it around level 60).
---
Adrenaline was in list under AGI perks.  
---
But I usually run just one point in it instead of max of 5.  That first point gets you up to 36% dmg for 30 seconds (6% per kill), but it takes 4 more perk points to go from 36% max to 60%.   Right now my power fist dmg is at 1931 not counting Adrenaline effects, so the difference between lvl 1 and lvl 5 adrenaline perk
---
 would not matter for most critters other than SBQ.
---
I will take this opoturnity to say Im sorry I one shot some enemies sometimes. I don't have TSE but I have instigating explosive revolver and it does high amount of damage particularly when Im fighting closer than usual.
---
It's super annoying when some people just one shot all legendaries, granted at some point one star legendaries just become rather boring at the likehood of them having anything really worth carrying is low.
---
Still don't believe you can one shot through slap damage. Video or it didn't happen 
---
I've done the quest for it 30 times and never got it.
---
Uhhhh I looove my clean purifier. Play with terrain just about every build and have it inside. Looks slick dawg.

You'll appreciate it one day when it fits perfectly in a CAMP aesthetic.
---
Whitespring because fissure site prime will be damn near impossible at your level
---
How low does the health need to be to start showing higher damage ? 
---
I had a few of those weapons never explosive but with melee weapons going close to 100 damage 
---
Poor Moo-Moo. Why does the brahmin always get it? 
---
As an herbivore, all I eat is dog food lol
---
They do it for crafting items and the atom shop items of course, so we know it can be done.
---
Haha thanks for the advice. I'll look forward to that day 
---
Thank you for doing this. I am traveling for work for several weeks and cannot log in to see new limited time items.   If I see something good I can now have a family member log on for me and make purchases.  So, again, thank you!
---
I did, thank you.

Also every point of demolition expert (assuming you have an explosive weapon of some sort) adds 20% damage increase up to 100%. It is one of the best point to percent returns available on a perk card. DEFINITELY a staple in ANY build as long as you use an explosive variation. It is a huge boost in damage. Just for reference my bloodied explosive Gauss rifle does 2521 damage before any buffs or bobbles. 3500 after psychotats. And like 1000 of that damage is the demolition expert.
---
I have had to restart my game everytime it has happen because its loading for the minutes straight.
---
what does this thread remotely mean
---
They're not marketing to Watoga, they're bragging. "We keep Boston running, so there."
---
Make it auto and flip to commando.
---
the one i am wearin this pic is ok, the Marine helmet that looks like the 2nd pic is not.
---
ok : https://imgur.com/z8oMlq9
---
not ok: https://imgur.com/ixphmIP
---
at least that my understanding.
---
At least in proper shoot and loot games like diablo and borderlands, if you kill a boss or mini boss or special enemy you’re guaranteed a high tier drop. It might suck or not be what you need but you’ll still get a gold tier item for example. 
---
What the duck is Bethesda’s problem? I ask this genuinely and sincerely. 
---
Just opened the Modify menu at the Armor Workbench.
---
I have BoS applied with the other options being Fiberglass, Polymer, Shadowed, and Reinforced.  I assumed it was tied to learning the same mods on Combat Armor in general.  When I first found the helmet I only had Reinforced as an option.
---
Are those the ones that go 'derp'?
---
Yeah, I run base strength of 1 and my only perk there is blocker rank 1. Because you can't go lower than 1. If we could, I would.
---
Xxbakedpotato1xX be on tonight
---
Sold. Time to start moving some points around. Hopefully they don’t change the perk working with explosive weapons.
---
Wetsuit.
---
Durability is semi-addressed by Weapon Artisan.
---
There's one behind the firebase in the Ash Heap I think? I'll check in a bit.
---
Some cards (Lone Wanderer for sure) have a 2 point requirement at rank 1, so I'm guessing they'll need 3 points in that SPECIAL stat for rank 2.
---
Just doubled checked on [You Are SPECIAL Character builder](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1114111&amp;d=c72&amp;w=&amp;n=).
---
MY DMV experience in 76 was so much better than in real life.
---
Well, considering I posted this I believe you. Be prepared for a bunch of people to tell you it didn't actually happen even know you personally experienced it. I don't know whether there is still some type of bug that is bypassing the pacifist damage modifier, like maybe they're shooting the ground in front and the splash damage isn't being modified, but I know it happens.  
---
It's really more about semantics.
---
Goo piles are still lootable as far as I've seen, but one risk I've found to using gatling plasma on scorchbeasts is having them turn into goo piles that are too small to find when they fall.
---
But they didn't stack on  top of each other either, did they.  If you've ever traded with someone who is a duper the weapons stack in one inventory slot.  Bethesda apparently doesn't have access to anyone's inventory, but it'd be pretty simple to delete mass duped legendary items by simply deleting anything beyond 1 in a stack.
---
Am I the only one who honestly never gets any good drops? Does charisma really matter that much?
---
How do you deal with carry weight? Deep Pocketed armor? What is your carry weight? 
---
Me too man :(
---
F
---
I know the wetsuit tactical is in the game I was just pertaining to the second as I have heard yes and no multiple times. Ty.
---
I got some solid kills with mine early on, but ran into breaks more frequently than my ballistic heavies, for sure.
---
Looks like a re-skinned NCR ranger mask
---
Lolz
---
That’s like saying people who buy and use meth aren’t as bad as the folks who make it. They’re both guilty.
---
Buying duped items feeds the duping machine. Simple supply and demand curve. 
---
Duper’s  created an environment where a cheaters willing to pay real money for  an unfair competitive advantage over normal folks. Empowering griefers
---
If you bought duped items, to burned my house and killed my toon, screw you. You’re going down 
---
Haven't found any crayons so that narrows it down some on the branch.
---
How would that be bad in any way? If you are in a team with someone that already can open the door just have him do it
---
I got proof. Buddy sent me a picture of his email from Bethesda and he's on xbo recieved duped items.  So it's definitely real. And it says indefinitely 
---
You know passive mode doesn't change the slap damage mechanic right? 
---
It just makes it to where you can't deal damage to anyone or anything else so you can't accept or initiate PvP. 
---
I could not agree more as with this suggestion. Maybe besides making a slap doing simply 0 damage, or publishing real PvP and PvE worlds.
---
The bloodied effect synergizes amazingly with nerd rage and adrenal reaction. Bloodied is a boost that is constant depending on your health, you get a small boost at each point lost. Same with adrenal reaction so they increase alongside eachother. Nerd rage only hits at below 20% so anything above that point, you benefit only from adrenal and bloodied effects. But yes the adrenal gives you a boost even at 100%, I'm not sure about the bloodied affix though.
---
I think a really good step for you would be to apologise over lulling someone into a false sense of security over those dev room items. You don't exactly have the greatest batting average to make a post like this.
---
Gets the error code 3:0:8725724278030340
---
Cat.
---
If im on before then, i tend to be up until then, a bit hard with wee ones haha 
---
Message me your PSN, worth the chance
---
For non-legendary, craft them. For legendary, white whitesprings and uranium fever event
---
Ah, I have Automaton and didn't even know that! Dunno how...
---
I just don't pick alot of stuff up, also you can throw radicool on a low health unyielding build and get alot of carry weight even with no points invested I would be around 7-10 strength on my stat sheet.
---
Dynes our group has hunted griefers in the past. They have always been an annoyance. But these new aholes we call the bobblegriefers are fucked.
---
Pacifist mode should not be one shot. Also he made my X-01 PA legs go red from one friggen hit. That means his damage is insanely high bypassing it all.
---
Nuking Tanagra Town in The Mire would turn all the ore deposits there into Ultracite ones in theory, have always wanted to try that one out.
---
For me I always unplug the wifi to reset it. That seems to solve the issue. This is an annoying daily ritual, but with 5 minutes of patients I am able to play again
---
I thought the fix it good perk gives PA 130% @lvl1?
---
Thia is not the first server required game.
---
Not 10minutes, but there are sometimes really big delays. Looks crazy, if you already walked away from your CAMP and the workstation and in the middle of a fight, hundreds of meters away from home, suddenly the craft screen is popping up
---
Right now I have base strength of 8 (which I’m starting to realize is a bad allocation) and have the 3x Strong Back, 3x Barbarian, and 2x armor weight reducing. If I cut strength, then I guess barbarian won’t be worth it—so prob first to go. And I have marsupial,
---
Thank you. Very helpful.
---
Yeah same for me, dumb thing is when I did a ticket about how its stupid for mods to be destroyed as junk material when I lost my jetpack and stealth boy power armor mods that way they responded really quickly, so I think once they got our receipts they are ignoring our canvas bags tickets on purpose to not give us the 500 atoms and think we forgot sigh, sad no youtubers are making a big deal so Bethesda is going win on this.........
---
If you're going to hit Whitesprings, it would be worthwhile to get at least a rank or two of Glow Sight so you get an extra damage boost against glowing mobs. Also, try to get the Marsupial mutation so that you can jump to somewhere safe and snipe without getting swarmed by the 20+ ghouls that will come streaming out of the gold club.
---
If you want an alternative, try nuking the area around Morgantown. There's not as many legendary ghouls, but on the other hand they tend to travel in much smaller packs so you're less likely to get overwhelmed. There's also a lot of flora in the area so you can colect plenty of flux.  If you go there, try to drop the nuke so that the train station is just outside the blast zone. You can't fast travel into the zone, so having a convenient vendor/stash just outside the zone will be appreciated by you and everyone else who joins.
---
It is the first fallout one made by bethesda
---
Landview Lighthouse, right after completing the fireflies &amp; frogs event: [Pretty good broad daylight screenshot](https://www.beldar.org/beldarblog/2019/Photo_2018-12-21-154710.png)
---
thanks.  I don't usually remember to check the shop stuff when logging in, so this was helpful.
---
I went to Fissure Prime in my 30's and survived.  
---
Just need stimpaks, radaway and radx.
---
Only do Fissure Prime if your server has a good number of players.
---
Did prime at 30...with other people 
---
I’m pretty sure that’s a legit marketing tactic. Plan a game so that it will only last a certain amount of time, before people have to spend their money again.
---
But it’s the first server required fallout game 
---
White springs is a great first nuke area. Equip an automatic gun and grenades, and just try to get at least one “hit” on as many ghouls as possible while avoiding as much damage as you can. There will be literal waves of ghouls down there, so keep your distance and try to get hits from afar the higher-level players will take care of actually killing them. 
---
There are a few main places that big groups of ghouls will spawn, most notably the golf club. You will see players congregate around this building and wait for these groups to show up and then rapidly kill and loot them with their TSEs. But, if you get even a single hit on them, you’ll get experience when they die - and since there’s so many high-level creatures here that means you’ll level up super fast.
---
I would recommend dropping your junk off beforehand though, that way if you die you won’t lose anything important. Also, pick up everything off the ghouls - don’t take the time to pick and choose what you want. That way their body will disappear once you’re done and you’ll know when a fresh kill has happened. When you get a chance between the spawns, just drop anything that you don’t want and continue the killing spree.
---
Also, make sure pacifist mode is on - player deaths occur a lot in White Springs since everyone is shooting blindly into the ghoul horde.
---
If you’re on XB1 I can help run you through the silo and go through White Springs, if you want any additional help. PM me if you want a gamer tag, otherwise good luck!
---
I usually stand on the shack to kill the adds in relative safety (mostly from myself). Too many things/players running about below to risk using explosives around. 
---
No worries, I posted my build on another discussion earlier today, I'll try to get it together here for you.
---
I like Morgantown. You can get the collision course event to start and get waves of scorched. It’s not going to have the number of legendaries as Whitespring. But it’s something different. Don’t nuke watoga. The robots don’t drop anything useful. I like SBQ over Whitespring. It feels like you work with others rather than racing to kill the legendaries. I have a good group of 4-6 players and we run SBQ the majority of the time. 
---
Killed vengeful mothman twice today!
---
So dumb.
---
Designed purely to fuck off the player base...
---
Working as planed.
---
https://youtu.be/_V2sBURgUBI Has anyone noticed that this game is hosted on a server? what's the deal with that!?!
---
Ticks are worse. 
---
Game is complete shit.
---
They most definitely will, at some point, but right now it is meta and you're pretty gimped without it.
---
Razorgrain soup is how I adapted. Easy and heals decently too. 
---
Eso is maintained by zenimax online. maybe they'll maintain it or sell it off but i doubt BGS will.
---
No they didnt, thats a really good point. Seems like a win win to me then
---
You can wear any outfit on top of any non-PA armour :) 
---
It happened to me once prior to the update. A hard reset on the xbox fixed it.
---
Yeah they need a huge balance patch... I'm sure they will work up to it eventually... Fire and ice weapons both need some loving. Legendary mods need more high tier contenders besides tse... 
---
And crafted items... Idk where to start... They are currently completely pointless aside from scrap farming them for mods... Which makes high int builds seem pretty stupid and useless since you can only craft plain gear. 
---
That's where I first saw him too. Scared the bedazzled out of me.
---
Sure thing, I haven't used the site so I'll just list my stuff:
---
S- 1 (blocker rank 1)
---
P- 15 ( Tank killer rank 3, concentrated fire rank 3, rifleman rank 3, expert rifleman rank 3, master rifleman rank 3)
---
E- 2 ( Fireproof rank 2) I want to make this rank 3
---
C- 2 (lone wanderer rank 1)
---
I- 8 ( Demolition expert rank 5, nerd rage rank 3)
---
A- 14 ( Adrenaline rank 5, covert operative rank 3, dodgy rank 3, gun fu rank 3)
---
L- 14 ( Grim reaper sprint rank 3, four leaf clover rank 3, better critical rank 3, bloody mess rank 3, starched genes rank 2)
---
It is a low health rifle build and my mutations are eagle eyes, marsupial, speed demon, and adrenal reaction. Coupled with my sentinel assassin armor and a bloodied explosive Gauss rifle as my main weapon followed by my TSE lever action.
---
As a heavy weapon user I have to agree. The heavy weapon perks work with the rocket launcher and fatman but not the grenade launchers (including the auto gernade launcher). Just make sure you know which weapons you want to use so you know what perks you need to get. I dont use a lot of explosives because they dont work too well with my build.
---
If you want to focus on explosives you would be better concentrating in the demolition expert and flame proof perk (now it has been updated) and whatever perks are relevant to the actual guns you want to use. It is a funny world we are in where an explosive shotgun works better as an explosive weapon then a rocket launcher :P
---
Yes exposive weapons can have be two shot but they arent two shot explosive because they are already explosive. You can get a quad barrel for a normal missile launcher but the difference is the quad will let you fire 4 rockets before you have to reload and the two shot version will shoot a second missile for every missile you shoot (and the second shot doesn't count towards your ammo). 
---
Good luck with your build!
---
I have the carnivore perk and I want to switch to herbivore. Reasons:  
---
1. Plants are everywhere and I have a nice selection at home.  
---
2. Meat is everywhere too but to get the best stuff you have to kill rare things with a % chance to drop what you want. Plants you just walk up and mash a key. With Green Thumb perk you get double guaranteed.  
---
3. Plants weigh a lot less than meat in general. I don't know if this applies to high perk veg recipes but doubt I'd see any weighing 1.5 each (before reductions)
---
If you have decent power armor and a super sledge you can wait for them to land and take them out pretty easily. If you're trying to take one down from the sky without a TSE, be prepared to waste a LOT of ammo...
---
Vault tec built the bunker. Just saying. Next time youre up there read the print in the vault door. 
---
Have you noticed that they already said private servers will be implemented at some point after launch and that they have stated they will be keeping the servers up until the sun burns out?
---
Maybe go look into the actual facts before making inflammatory statements that ignore reality.
---
one of those items people data mined and used dev tools to rip from the game files.
---
You can find him day or night really. Farm the random encounter at Charleston Station (same one that spawns the vendor) and you’ll get him in no time.   
---
Raleigh Clay’s Bunker is also a possible spawn for a Vengeful one but that’s less likely. 
---
Message me your PSN, id like to check it out. Have yet to use traps or anything like that but i enjoy all types of builds.
---
Don’t worry it’s been posted on every megathread and numerous suggestion posts. They had to see it by now.
---
i have been looking since a couple weeks after release for that helmet. i could never find it anywhere. nobody had it. I even looked at the black Fo76 market to see if it even existed, and it did not.
---
Unless a week ago, when the DEV room was outed, it suddenly started showing up. I have NO real proof that this is not some super rare item that has been in the RNG tables and I just never saw it, but given how hard I look I am sure I would have found it by now.
---
Serum plans drop from the Scorchbeast Queen. I believe (not 100% on this) that you get plans for Prime receivers for all weapons that can have different ones and then serums can drop. Still only a % chance.
---
The "kill the adds" part is the takeaway and it sounds like you are killing adds, so +1 you.
---
There are still a lot of players standing in the shack with an Assaultron blade...... Uh..... :\
---
Up in the mire by the sunken church... I got attacked by 3 moth man's, a Grafton monster and a flat woods monster in about 30 minutes.... Idk wtf was going on but they just wouldn't give up. 
---
theres a location where you can set your camp up at some already build structure, comes with 3 bobblehead spawns and ive been here for most of my gameplay. Sadly not sharing it because i'd hate for it to get fixed or reduced anytime soon.  
---
They are under the same umbrella.  Eventually you'll be able to pick up 76 for $.99 on gog and some 15th party will maintain servers.
---
When that happens you'll laugh at what this game is.  Tech will be so far ahead it won't matter.
---
I have no doubt "historical" servers will be set up for all the popular games at minimum.
---
That's not why you were banned.
---
What were you doing on your mule is the question
---
Why?
---
I have no evidence to argue against anything you posted except slap damage. I have personally been one shot by players while not wanted, not returning fire, pacifist on. I can give you the account name of one of the players that did it, since he's the only person I have blocked.
---
By removing 90% of them!
---
Every developer who launches these games say they will maintain the servers till the sun burns out. Yet if you look at every other server based game they all have died out. No developer will reasonably host a game that is 10 years old for a loss of profit. If the private server has to check back in with the central server to work then when they shut down the central server it won't work either. This isn't an inflammatory statement its just the truth of the matter. At some point fallout 76 will get shutdown and be the first fallout game that will be unplayable. 
---
Maybe it can be patched for offline play
---
I believe the rad toads have eyes on their backs
---
You're welcome.
---
I shot it's extra heads off, it thanked me later.
---
Yeah thats what I was figuring had been hunting that thing since beta bethesda nees to hurry up and put it into the freakin game
---
I think he means red blooded, blue collared American working men and women vs companies ready to outsource to slave labor as they are to replace everyone with robots
---
Yeah that would be cool.  I used to have a key to those gates and would sometimes drive through there while working.  They were really something to see up close.  I was once even offered to be able to climb up and look out the hatch on top. I declined though.  Interestingly enough, there sometimes would be people there researching the effects they had on local wildlife.  I guess there was a claim that they were killing migratory birds and endangered bats. 
---
Yup this is the answer! Were all banned, this is BS I purposely avoided duping to try and avoid getting the banhammer and now i get banned anyway cause I had stored duped items from some other player? How many people can actually say that they have no duped items thats just not possible to know if your a looter or trader of any kind.
---
added you
---
Delta-76
---
I can see some modders making an offline version of this game for pc but itll be a shame it won't be playable on consoles
---
My brother uses a pretty generic 2 shot .50 Cal and I run a bloodied melee build. If it's just the 2 of us we can kill her in about 2 to 3 minutes depending on if she decides to land quickly. No exploits or anything needed. It's nice because we don't have to rely on the server having other high levels, but I see your point. 
---
I'm pretty sure marine armor is the strongst Non-PA armor.
---
As much as I like the NCR ranger gear I live my bulked up Marine armor ;) and yeah they resemble eachother very much would make sense though.
---
i thought everyone knew this
---
True, we pick up too many plans of it lol
---
Dead center on Vault 76
---
South of the water park? I have never seen anyone nuke Grafton before. I would love to see that.
---
&gt;will be pointless
---
Except for, you know, all the playtime you had for 10 years. 
---
On the phantom weight thing, just anecdotally I think part of it was just fallout 4 players not realizing that *nearly everything* has weight now.
---
Had a friend a few weeks in who was bitching about phantom weight, both in his stash and on his character. I just said “Check how many mini nukes and Bobby pins you’ve got”. He actually said “Ok, but what’s that got to do with... Ooohhh”.
---
Bust a gut laughing at him
---
I'm on pc and haven't had a single negative experience. Everytime i run across a high level they either completely ignore me, wave and move on or, in the case of ws nuke zone, let me tag all the ghouls before murdering them.
---
The first time I did it, I was maybe 2 steps away from completing the quest when the server crashed. Reloaded, got to about the same point a second time only to have the server kick me. I about threw my xbox out a window lmao
---
It sounds to me like you're pretty self aware and considerate, I don't think you have anything to apologise for. Also I agree about the one stars. And even with 3 stars it's situational, I mean I'm not gonna get myself killed making sure every player around gets their shot. 
---
If my experience last night went the way I expected, I wouldn't have been too upset, nor would I have posted about not getting to hit legendaries or whatever. That's the game sometimes and that's alright. I just really appreciated (being the only other person in the event) that the player 200 lvls my senior acknowledged my presence and cared to make sure I got a piece of the 3 stars. But of course we're not always able, and sometimes it's out of our control.
---
You forgot the *maybe* in your inflammatory statement. 
---
Unless you have perfected time travel and can tell the future for certain that private servers will have to check back to some "command" and that that "command" server will be shut down.
---
Please feel free to provide proof for all these other games that have explicitly stated the servers will stay up indefinitely and then shut them down, I will wait (I will wait a while I suspect because companies actually generally don't promise this due to legal implications).
---
Oh you'll see...
---
so dumb to leave out 1 piece. OCD mutation kicking in.
---
Rippers are pretty good when overrepaired. Durability is a problem. 
---
Id like to be able to display my bobble heads as well
---
You've triggered my CDO....  :) I agree.
---
I screenshotted it because it was where I want to hit when farming flux. It wasn’t directly on Grafton. It was almost due south of the water park, with all the little puddles and the like. 
---
Tons of ferns (violet) and tons of bloodleaf (cobalt). 
---
If you don't have mats to repair things and is constantly dying I sugest you just change servers when someone attacks your camp. I see little to no reason to stay and watch people destroy your camp if you don't want that to happen.
---
what a pointless thing to whine and posture about 
---
Added
---
Joining!
---
There's a dev room with one of everything in the game, including some things that aren't available in the game yet... I know there's a power armor paint, a helmet and a couple plans for the things... Stuff like that. 
---
People got in with teleport hacks or something and duped the shit out of them. There's rumors that they are banning people with these items but idk if there's anything to those rumors. 
---
Have the same issue, stick at 40% and im not moving again. Ive tamed a few creatures so that must be it. My end game was basically building now that im 150+ with all the good gear. This sucks
---
I mentioned in another comment here that my TV doesn't have that option. All I can do is adjust the aspect ratio, which doesn't solve the problem
---
God i hated that. Of all the realism they avoid, they decide to go with that as realistic as possible. 
---
I’m weak 😂😂😂 this thread made my day. I did this quest, no later than a week my friend was on this quest and I told him to get ready and be patient.
---
Oh, I forgot to mention... for your disease cure thing, there is a sulfur drinking fountain in the inside of the exterior gazebo wall  at the Whitesprings Golf Club. It's right next to the tennis courts. You take a couple rads for drinking from it, but no big deal, it instantly cures your diseases. Very handy when you are nearby or have a crippling disease you just have to get rid of.
---
It makes you confused where to shoot, it's great. I got sick of shooting things so now I use the aim sight to shoot the wall to the far left of the things I am aiming at. Would highly recommend. 
---
That made me laugh so hard, I was like, Pour soul, I wonder what he was trying to do. 
---
Any costume works on top of most Non-PA armors, the only exception being I think the Marine or Scout Under-Armor will not allow a costume over it.
---
I think so to and I have a shielded marine wetsuit (under armor) it gives 9 dam resistance from ballistics, energy, and radiation
---
Be there soon!
---
Same reason GM Island was in WoW, which people also got to. Your test environment needs to be as similar to live environment as possible and you need a source of test material. That's the dev room. It wasn't accessible by any conventional means anyway, or even unconventional means that stayed within the game bounds; it required cheat engine or other trainers to force edit where a load zone was taking you. That on its own is ban-worthy before it goes to the dev room.
---
Very cool find, thanks!
---
Occasionally find a good plan in locked containers.
---
Also need to unlock that door at whitesprings in the cafe to kill the ghoul in there...so many times it’s been a legendary 3 star
---
1. Gathering Resources
---
2. Until you log off
---
3. see #1  
---
Also some PVP action, as anybody can freely try to claim it from you and not receive a bounty
---
I live up here too and I only two complaints, 1 is no gosh darn water, and two the game doesn’t render anything out of the borders so if you look out for a nice picture it looks really stupid 
---
Thats what they all say
---
game is not finding that name....PC right?
---
Sweet thanks 
---
We need displays for power armour, magazines, bobbleheads, and maybe even weapons. 
---
Thanks for proving my point. 
---
wow
---
This will be how we make our own challenging content, dropping our 3 stars down during prime fissure fights
---
I'm lvl 95 but if you want some help thru the game I'll be glad to help you and farm legendaries for ya 
---
Maybe one of those people you hunted down flagged you for harassment, or you picked up some item from the dev room?
---
Pm'd. :) 
---
You can use extractors to get resources like black yitanium, junk items, concrete, aluminum, etc. What resources are available depend on the workshop. They also give you a free fast travel spot.
---
You will hold the workshop until 
---
1 you log off
---
2 another player kills you for it (never had a player come after me for a workshop before, so it doesn't seem like something that happens alot)
---
3 You fail to defend your workshop from an attack event. (Usually ghouls, dogs or mutants)
---
up and up the damage goess
---
Agreed. This happened within the context of the limits of the game presented to us by Bethesda. 
---
Report what? That the game is happening?
---
This isn't my style, but I appreciate players making feel like, oh I don't know, I'm living in a post-apocolyptic world. And keeping me guessing.
---
Shouldn't have duped. 
---
The 1 shot happened to me personally, so I know you don't know what you're talking about.
---
I can not upvote this enough. Though I agree the game has a lot of issues and the general reception is crap. I enjoy logging in every day and playing.
---
Are there issues? Oh heck yes. Do I feel for my money I have a game that entertains me during the day? You bet ya. 
---
Maybe people just like funny stories 
---
damn i should invest in building one lol
---
Where did you get the legit one? Haven't seen it yet but I haven't seen everything yet.
---
Id pay a shit ton of money for that in 76
---
Sold at Harper's Ferry Vendor (Free States) by Wallace.
---
aw sad -4 points
---
Did I stumble into r/fallout ? Didn’t realize people here were so salty about everything here like they are over there.  It’s not my favorite fallout game, but the “Bethesda bad” circlejerk is getting laughable.

People saying they shouldn’t have made a game that can be exploited in the first place, like there’s any games out there that are immune to hacking and exploits. 
---
I think it’s good they’re fixing stuff and banning cheaters, especially since people are going to bitch whether they do or don’t fix things at this point
---
Now you just need to find the secret boss; x-01 jetpack
---
Just found these today.  Still no idea what to do with them..
---
Yup.
---
Lasts a few minutes. Sometimes requires relog.
---
Is this one of the chicks if so what's your console 
---
Most people here are probably not old enough to know that ban waves always trap some innocents when they start. I have no reason to not believe OP at all, and no one else here does not either. 
---
Some simple questions OP, platform, level and gametime?
---
I've had people insta-gib the queen before I could get there despite me being the one who spent all that time to launch the nuke (and get the card). :P
---
Agreed. I'm personally taking a break from the game until this gets fixed somehow. Not to mention getting rid of dupers and cheaters. :/ Which sucks cause I was actually enjoying the game.
---
(PS4) This has overwhelmingly been my experience as well, and why I noted some self reflection towards the end of my post. As someone who played every second of each beta, and would have a much higher lvl main if not for my 2 &gt;lvl 40 alts, I realized I started expecting the worst out of everyone soley from reading so many horror stories on this sub. It's not that bad out there in the wastes, and I sincerely hope that potential new players on the fence of buying the game don't get a misreprestation of the average players experience. 
---
2nd pic is not me its a pic that i found of someone else showing off the helmet.
---
Considering they've already promised private servers, it wouldn't be that hard to switch said private servers to player run pl private servers. 
---
So you were playing solo, in passive mode, with full health, not wanted, not engaging a workshop, and someone 1 shot you dead?
---
Imagine all the blissful chaos!
---
Sent a request
---
Lots of problems here on PS4. Have to quit game after disconnect. Two disconnects in 15min. 
---
A TSE will one hit uranium fever and whitespring glowing ones without bobbleheads you softhead. Not everyone who does more damage than you is a duper.
---
This. On my vendor loop I always stop at the trainstation first. And if I don't have enough vendor fodder for the Enclave I stock up be for I head over.
---
Do you happen to have one for sale for combat armor? I have multiple for the marine torso but can not locate one for combat armor anywhere. 
---
I agree but I was helping a lvl 9 that was tagging along with me so I did the stupid thing and tried to fight him.  He was able to take almost everything out in between my respawns.  
---
Next time I'll log as soon as the first thing gets damaged, which kinda is a sucky way of playing.
---
Just a little history lesson. 
---
The labor dispute theme actually comes from WV history. At one point, miners weren’t even pain in US money, but rather [scrip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip). Through the use of scrip the companies had almost complete control over their employees. Any attempts to unionize were dealt with harshly, up to and including violence perpetrated by private detectives. 
---
The bloodshed that resulted from these disputes, and the ever growing push to unionize, culminated in the [Battle of Blair Mountain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain)  where the US military was forced to intervene to quell the fight.  This extensive conflict would become known as the [Coal Wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Wars). 
---
The music you mention (most likely the Tennessee Ernie Ford songs “16 Tons” and “Dark as a Dungeon”) are not custom productions for the game, but rather anecdotes from a darker time in the history of mining. 
---
I stopped doing quests after failing that a few times.  
---
Uhh do you not pay attention to the game release and their website pve servers are a thing soon. You get the fuck over yourself being the asshole now.
---
Thanks so much for participating.  My wife and I had a lot of fun reading everyone's posts.  If the Fallout series has done one thing, it has exposed countless gamers to a genre of music that transpires generations.  Truly.
---
And in case anyone was wondering, my personal favorite is Billie Holiday's, "Crazy he calls me."
---
The winner is u/tiredtwink.  Congratulations!  I'll be sending the code to your Inbox shortly.
---
Can you share the communication you received from Bethesda?
---
Hehe, I have a cliffside camp as well. The scorched that decide they want to invade and then the satisfying crunch when they hit the ground is great.
---
Agreed. Solves the whole problem.
---
I honestly love my two dragons I got they literally one shot anything with the right build one even the queen somehow I love them only downside on one of them is the reload speed the other has 90 percent reload speed 
---
Happens to me sometimes, but it’s only ever been a minute or so
---
1stly the way they can tell is crafting mass items not what items you have, 2ndly youre right as of an hour ago a ban wave hit
---
Well welcome. Almost anything posted here that is an idea or suggestion or even this will be a mix of hate and like. Enjoy it!
---
I chase them around and beat them to death every time.
---
Then later on when I get over encumbered it’s good bye frog eggs and frog legs
---
My friend gave me a 5 star legendary dragon and it does over 6k
---
did you find jiveman...if so can i friend you?
---
Honestly,it's all relative.  I haven't found much difference at all between them.  Major gutsy will still shred your health, whether in wooden or combat armor.
---
The only important thing to go for are the legendary effects and looks.
---
Then the meta goes back to bloodied melee builds
---
Where I’m at now. Have 2 level up points in hand.

I have a 3 star handmade and mine almost got up to 1k
---
You don’t like your Legendary Drill?????
---
Servers full
---
I sent a friend request but he hasn't responded yet
---
For sure there are enough screwdrivers, wrenches, and hammers laying around that could be used to craft those kits.
---
Was referring to the first pic. 
---
More details plz
---
Ahh man that legit made me laugh. I’ve had a couple of things just land on me out of nowhere. A level 1 mothman pounced on my head. Super mutant fell off a building as I walked by. Every time I jump a wee bit. Then laugh. 
---
Msg me your PSN
---
apx?
---
I tried moving the C.A.M.P. object to the 4th floor but still cannot put a roof on my 4th floor.
---
Yup
---
Server crashed, sorry
---
\#1: Anything in the "stored" category counts against your building budget. Only use "stored" for very temporary storage. 
---
\#2: Turrets take up HUGE chunks of the budget and are of questionable worth. There are other building strategies to mitigate the risks of someone or something damaging your camp when you're not there, mostly having to do with choice of geographic location &amp; placement. If you are going to use turrets, get them off the ground and ensure they have good line of sight or they're a complete waste; if you get the upgraded home defense perk, the spotlights, while visually unimpressive in-game (a carry-over bug from Fallout 4 that that game long since patched, grrrr), nevertheless help the other turrets "spot" and start shooting at stuff. Turrets are also relatively expensive to fix, using components you might rather devote to, say, power armor construction &amp; repair.
---
\#3: You can right-click on some objects (like doors, resource extractors, and water purifiers) to lock them. (My preference is not to; I like passers-by being able to view &amp; use my CAMP, including its water &amp; crops.)
---
\#4: If you use upper-level floors as your roof, those survive, like the foundations and stairs, through otherwise total destruction (as from a scorchbeast attack or nuke).
---
\#5: *After* you build your camp, you can pick up and relocate, within the CAMP radius, the CAMP device; where it's located affects (unpredictably; use trial &amp; error) your own respawn position when you fast travel, and you may want to have it placed where you can do a "repair all" from under cover during a fight.
---
\#6: There are tons of Reddit posts on camps and campsites, also tons of videos. Seeing what other people have done can generate creativity on your part, if you're so inclined. 
---
I agree. I did not dupe but I know I have dupe item/s as 100% of players have duped items in their stash box. I guess banning all players is one way they can kill the game.
---
Damn. Thanks anyway man
---
You xould just fast travel out 
---
Looks like a military outpost. Very cool!
---
Has it happed to you often? I've been settled here about a week and it was the first time they spawned above me. Now that I know to be aware of it, it will definitely be satisfying and not terrifying.
---
I just learned about this today, too! Turns out eating someone is a good way to get them to stop seeking revenge from pvp.
---
no mate cya around
---
Quick make some ammo!!!
---
Well scan to fit is what worked for me so I don't know what else 
---
I sold my blade when it was low and now I can't make a new one because it says I need one in the recipe. Anyway I can get another blade?
---
I'm guessing if you didn't dupe you picked up the inventories of somebody who did and didn't dispose of them properly.
---
Pics or the Witch costume didn't happen.
---
I just went there and found the Black Cowboy Hat
---
Yep, Chinese robots! Lol
---
Seriously guys are you that incompetent that you cant seriously fix your game without messing up other parts of it? its sad and disgusting really. on ps4 i cant craft 5mm ammo unless I have twice as much lead as needed and i cant join my team AFTER being disconnected from game like a constant damn usual thing. unless i i join by social otherwise infinite loading screen. supported this game till now. its absolutely disgusting and sad at this point and you all should feel pathetic
---
In my experience, that's an early indication you are on a server with poor latency to you. A gentle hint to server hop rather than capturing a workshop only to be DC'd later.
---
A number of people have accused me of killing through pacifist because they don't understand workshop pvp.
---

Now THAT is interesting as hell. I knew those tunes existed beforehand, but not necessarily what sparked them, let alone anything about the coal wars. Thank you for sharing your knowledge!
---
While it maybe crying it's also feedback and / or constructive criticism, I'm PS 4, after last patch this is my first 1 hr or so; log in now takes 5 mins, during that time for a full minute I've loaded in game yet face a black screen ( I'm now subjected to an attack, yet can't defend ), I then go back into a loading screen, then I can play for 20 mins, then I get a blue screen, booted back to desktop, I then go through the motions of relogging, 20 mins later guess THE FUCK WHAT? I get another blue screen, is this caused by my net? Maybe, however when I hear that a new dupe that causes everyone to crash I expect something to be done about it and if it takes 1000s of the same post weather it's about duping or crashes then thumbs up from me.
---
OP while you are entitled to your opinion and I respect that, be aware with all the glitches, hacks, dupes etc the game loses its focus and instead of the devs focusing on content they face fixing the game from these Fucking exploiters. You'll be the one crying me a Fucking river when new content is released and your faced with said exploiters with the best of everything cockblocking you from content that You want to play. However considering you don't care now then why the fuck will I care about your enjoyment of the game now or the in the future.
---
2:  another player can’t hunt you down and murder you for it, all they have to do is go to the base and “claim” the workshop. Any existing turrets will turn hostile to that player. They’ll have to wait twice as long to claim it and if you show up during this, you will enter PVP with the player claiming your shop.  
---
They can (and most likely will) destroy your turrets while claiming the shop. 
---
I don't spend a ton of time in my camp.  But if I'm there for an extended crafting or cleanup session I'll probably get scorched wander in. I would say at least once a play session. Seems like they tended to attack more often when I had two generators. Cut it back to one and I'm seeing less. 
---
Dark earth would be awesome 
---
It feels like the screwed something up or duper’s I don’t even know anymore
---
Had a level 3* 91 glowing deathclaw creep up on me this evening. Managed to kill it before it spotted me, 1 star armor piece with reduced scorched damage. 
---
Woo. -_-
---
I mean initial placement.
---
Learn to climb!

GG EZ
---
Server filled up quick and we took her out fast. Thanks everyone!
---
I suspect you're right. :)
---
Such a simplistic and awesome solution to this!  Great suggestion, I can only hope that BSG listens and implements this sooner rather than later.
---
I had the same thing happen to me with lower lvl kids praising me due to my weapons of one shitting them so they called me a cheater and reported me and posted it on YouTube they now call me god and praise me when they see me 
---
OK, not trying to stir up anything, but could the ones commenting against it say why it would be a negative thing? I’m not seeing a down side to having one there, but maybe I’m missing something...
---
Why are you here? 
---
I understand, that's exactly why I said the "little reason", I was thinking about moments when you're playing with someone else. Personaly, I think it's stupid that we can't completely opt out of pvp. But right now, I don't think twice. If someone starts attacking me I'll just chance servers. Saves a me from a lot of disapointment. 
---
Does the terminal usually stock 2 at a time when it shows up?
---
"I don't consent to searches."
---
The bans are for people with items from the dev room, afaik, not specially dupers. You got that winterized power armor huh?
---
You also get plans as a reward if you like that.
---
Hmmm. It did happen shortly after I rebuilt my generators. Maybe that's it. 
---
2 circling R&amp;G station (or whatever name it is) when I went to vendor loot. My first cntrl-alt-del disconnect. I just don't care about them anymore. Waste of time and bullets.
---
So many people swear up and down that they've been killed through slap damage in one hit. When pressed they don't respond or they give some details that make it really seem like they don't at all understand it. 
---
hmm ok ill check it out. Thanks!
---
Cheers! Always good fighting with you. 
---
Yes, anyone that says otherwise is wrong. I expect folks finding more "budget" are just victims of the glitchly ass building system.
---
Well he is prob telling the truth as I have never duped and I as well got the ban hammer. 
---
I really don't understand Bethesda's bizarre affection for Protectrons.  It's almost like they think they are inherently funny or something, like we just can't get enough of them.
---
It's bad enough to follow the Mr. Handy Messenger around.
---
The chainsaw is a beast regardless. I took out a level 80 scorchbeast from 10% heath with it
---
I didn't know anything existed over 3 star? 
---
Wasn't this posted last week?
---
ya i was suprised when i went to my camp and saw 20 water purifiers out of the blue stored im glad it got fixed
---
That or a rat. 
---
Not all that got the ban duped items. You can have a simgle duped item in your inventory and never know it then get the ban. 
---
It's probably the people that are claiming to be victims of one of the supposed bugs going around that can't seem to be verified. People that dropped their weapons on accident and would rather believe that it was stolen, or people that stood on an exploding car and are convinced they got one shot with slap damage. Humans in general, myself included I'm sure, really *really* hate to be wrong. 
---
It’s drilled into our heads in 8th grade here. A trip to the exhibition mine in Beckley (the real one)  gives a better image of the bleakness of being a miner in the early 1900s before the reforms instituted after the end of the bloodshed. 
---
Miners in those days were little better than slaves, hence the refrain  “sold my soul to the company store”. 
---
PC 102, 100 + hours
---
Good go you will not be missed 
---
Let's go back to new vegas theme which so many people seem to praise in which you can only get 1 or 2 things really good and literally almost nothing else then. See how it pans out compared to being able to do anything you want whenever you want
---
Thank you!!
---
Bye
---
I gave up last year omegalul 
---
Plus I think clearing adds is what causes her to land. It’s like there’s a phase of ground spawns and once cleared, she lands- not 100% sure, but it sure seems like there’s a predictable pattern.
---
We should thank them for making no chainsaw drop
---
I didn't either but my friend got it from the sbq and did the want it so be gave it to me and bow I one shot anything in PvP or non PvP 
---
Why I don’t run nukes..I ran it only once it went off wasn’t worth the trouble to me..plus everyone else launches them so why do the work?
---
what are crafted materials? like the shielded suits and power armor parts? 
---
Bummer. I know how that sucks. It's happenef to me a couple times. I'm not at the breaking point yet, though. Hope you find something fun and wilorth your time.
---
You duped, get over it. Suspended Hopefully for eternity.
---
I don't have any items from the dev room and I got the ban so who knows exactly what the ban is for. It only says duplication
---
Hey at least you got to finish the mission.
---
Also you can fast travel there for free
---
I would gladly buy secret camp anything
---
Careful, that's "The Mechanist" talk there.  
---
Probably had a dev room item. Maybe one of those carnival masks? 
---
how do you figure out game play time?
---
It didnt happen. Oneshot in pvp is not possible when not in combat.
---
Read this proof;  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/\_/edw2m98/?context=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/_/edw2m98/?context=1)

It's possible but I have only seen 1 at a time

inb4 they get scrapped when trying to repair something

I would be on this like white on rice.

True but it wasn’t fun At all lol
---
I've been sticking with a rank 1 card for testing, and finding that rank 2 was in fact not working. Seems to be an issue they are aware of.

Grats. Took me about 10 hours of server hopping to get my 2 calibrated for my x-01

No

That is what I have been trying to tell people. Rumors matter more than facts around here it seems.
---
Add to the advantages: you usually get an event to take the workshop when you get near it and (once you kill appropriate enemies) complete the event when you first take the workshop, and right afterward as well as periodically an event will occur where enemies attack the workshop [\*].  These events offer XP and random rewards, usually including a C.A.M.P./Workshop related plan (e.g. Plan: Acoustic Instruments).
---
Add to the disadvantages: a player could start to contest your workshop, travel to where you are (nowhere near the workshop), and start PvP with you fully enabled (full rather than slap damage and not becoming wanted if you’re killed).  I’ve never encountered this.  How often one encounters this might be platform-dependent (PC players are too busy fixing video drivers to PvP :) ).
---
[\*] (if you don’t arrive in time for the event to defend the workshop, you’ll get an event to retake the workshop.  The retakes supposedly are shorter and supposedly offer the same event rewards as defending, so it may be worth it to retake always)
---
Looks pretty. Nice pics. 
---
You almost got me! Lol
---
I still lock the door when I'm repairing my PA. I know, realistically, that nobody can mess with it but the paranoia is strong. 
---
I mean like 100K of ammo or Stimpaks etc. 
---
I found rufus actually just now sadly the dog is dead i think unless i killed him by accident his body is located in a raider camp called The freak Show in a cage just to the right  site charlie quite sad :(

Tse means two shot explosive right?
---
Thank you so much!

The Box

Or we could just leave that since there's a post every five minutes complaining about it anyway?
---
"I'm sorry, officer, I don't consent to searches."
---
Did rifles get nerfed? I used to one shot lvl 68 charred ghouls, but I 2 shot them with a stronger gun now. 
---
That's been fixed for me.  I noticed this awhile ago. It also appeared to duplicate itself every time I moved... then I figured it's just storing the plants that had fruit available to harvest as well... but about a week ago, the vegs and fruits stopped being avail at the cooking station... but I still hv about 20 of each available to plant. PC.
---
It might be faster to just find what you want on a FO76 trading Reddit.
---
Or you can just wait until a level 117 dude comes by, snipe the legendary and let Mr. 117 do the rest... 🙄
---
Ok, except you have to initiate, i.e. hit them back to get more than slap damage. So, it does because it prevents you from doing that. Being pedantic doesn't prove your point. 
---
Thank you! :D
---
Grahm the super mutant vendor not selling what you want after hours searching for him?
---
they can break in 4 clips instead of 2 now.
---
57 days later and that guy is basically me now 
---
Lord knows I'd receive a duped item and get banned or something. Otherwise I'll easier until they implement the proper vendor dlc in game. 
---
Always launch nukes or fight the SB Queen on a team. Even if you need to team with a random person. I always ask for a team invite when people gather at a staging area before a SB Queen fight.
---
Thanks though. 
---
You’ll burn your house down..

There wasn’t anything on the patch. It depends on the gun you use or the level it is. They possibly buffed ghouls when they patched the glowing ones giving out huge amounts of exp
---
Where can I find the helmet homies?
---
Yeah it’d be nice to get more than a couple of cores into my explosive Gatling plasma without it breaking and also for demolitions expert to factor in too.
---
Just cause its 3 star doesnt make it good, i got a 3 star multipurpose axe with abilities that sucked
---
Wish they did it like borderlands where you slap each other then there's a short delay before damage comes
---
&gt;There was a thread on the front page yesterday about the surprising lack of toxicity a player had encountered, and one subthread theorized that there's a huge difference in the community depending on what platform you play on.
---
The game is very uncompetive. It's between single player game and pure co-op online. So the rest follows from that.
---
Thanks for the advice and points you laid out. Your CAMP is impressive and in a great location!  I appreciate you taking the time, maybe I'll come across you in the wastes some day. 
---
Ive seen more plans for the mod than I’ve seen instances of the gun itself. 
---
But does it have the, much coveted, working sink? 
---
Thank you for this post, I hope it gains traction.
---
I kind of figured since after 200 hours I experienced nor heard from any of my countless groups about any of the fake issues outlined in this post. It’s ridiculous the lengths folks will go online to perpetuate mis-information.
---
Take 2 seconds and install the load out mod.  Issue solved (PC only of course, no help if console)
---
Everywhere, he stalks you. Not sure how its triggered but he stalked me from lvl 40 ish to well over lvl 100. Im lvl 270 now and i havent seen him for a while but i saw him at site Apha, in the cranberr bog, near Aaronholt homestead and a few other random places. I couldnt kill him until i got an explosive cryolator lol https://youtu.be/_wXLNwBy5LA
---
Yeah me neither. There’s no main quests that take you to the upper left hand corner of the map, also the fact it’s lower level stuff it’s like, why?
---
Getting afull pvp server doest mean the current mode changes to full pve.
---
They already said they couldnt tell the difference between duped and non duped items. So thats not valid
---
if you mean the assault marine helmet, it’s not in game yet, and was only on PC due to exploiters.
---
as someone who accidentally bought it, its two parts.
---
PA is very easy to come by, whereas a full set of heavy assassins will take most players a very long time to collect. When you find the assassins, yeah use them, until then, you need to structure your build to avoid as much damage as possible.
---
I do use mystery saviour. Not only is it quite a funny perk, it also saves my butt quite a lot in PVE. For PVP however, most 1 shotters are so focused on coming toward you with tunnel vision, that they end up right next to you once you're down. The animation for Mystery Savior isn't very fast and so 95% of the time, you get nailed as soon as you get up. 
---
It's not a bad perk to have at all, but it's not all that effective against high-level players with OP guns, so it's not a priority.
---
Better to learn how to avoid the 1-shot and be the victor, than relying on perks/gear that have a chance of reviving you imo     
---
To quickly scroll through a long list of items hold down the D-pad and the analog stick. 
---
I thought it was kind of a neat system, given the setting. Whenever I run into someone else I ask if they need anything I have an excess of I don't use/need (ammo, meds, guns, legendaries), and in turn ask if they have stuff I'm looking for.
---
This system encourages me to go out of my way to work with other players. Within the context of this game, it makes some amount of sense (collapse in civilization).
---
Futuristic world in space like EVE online? This system would drive me bonkers. You've got interstellar travel and no reliable form of comms/barter!?
---
You take tiny chip damage anyway tho
---
The house south of the Nuka Cola plant has a working sink....but a lotta stuff is broken. However, it’s right next to the river for a water supply. 
---
There’s a loading screen tip that agrees with you.  On the other hand, I read a comment complaining the tip is bad because combat armor is actually stronger.
---
They did it for Skyrim so why not 76???
---
Before the patch i was using a lvl 40 Sniper rifle, hunting turned sniper, then i started using a lvl 50 lever action. The sniper was about 113 damage, the lever action 123. 
---
If you min max your build you can get what you want by 50 or roughly after 
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Just to summarize for point #3:
---
* You can gather all kinds of resources.
---
* If you place a welcome mat, it becomes a free Fast Travel point.
---
* You can receive all kinds of interesting plans for both taking and defending, including several that vendors otherwise charge 800+ caps for.
---
sweet thank you. i think the helmet would look dope with the marine set 
---
Youre like to 20th one 
---
...anyone else have the issue of post-Xbox most recent update... trying to open your pipboys FUBARs all your progress? I tried and Rose Raider Radio came on out of nowhere and no buttons worked. TAF. 
---
This is after my glitch of “back to basics” when I had the uniform and checked in... started the course... logged off and came back and had to find the whole uniform again.. still have the voucher slip and can’t get a uniform. 🙄🤯 I just wanna nuke the kiddies!!!!!!
---
So whats up with the ban on all these players? Bethesda needs to answer and what exactly the ban is for. 
---
They probably buffed the ghouls then because I didn’t read anything about rifles
---
But your response is t showing any understanding of the concept. 
---
You can just go get one for free at the crashed spaceship site. 
---
It seems to be that the better your internet, the more you disconnect. I have like 25% packet loss, on a good day, and the only time I rarely disconnect
---
Plenty of vegetable soups. Make a small garden at your can with a couple carrots, tatos, and razorgrain and a source of dirty water and you should be set for food that is herbivore approved.
---
This is Fallout 76 didn’t think you needed to place a welcome mat anymore to fast travel
---
I think one of the challenges is to explore for 7600 hours and it keeps track there.
---
You're the one being pedantic here.
---
Him being in pacifist or not is completely irrelevant to how much slap damage I did to him. That's what I meant by "doesn't change the mechanic." Which should be obvious from the conversation at hand. 
---
Just the marine armor regular helmet brah.
---
I'm up for it. Put way too much effort into my CAMPs, end up with a pretty meh result. I do like to mess around and look at others though, only a level 18 currently, no fancy plans or anything but I'm around.
---
I didn't either but you know, sometimes they do things without telling us. 
---
I am probably close to 100 hours actually
---
I think the issue is that FO4 (and thus FO76) tries to return to the canon aesthetic of the 50s America that we are to believe the Fallout universe is based on.
---
This is why all the ballistic weapons look like their are dated from WWI/WWII. 
---
FNV introduced modern looking weapon designs like Assault Carbine (based on M4) and Anti-Materiel rifle (based on PGM Hecate II) while FO4 and FO76 returns to the weapons like the Assault Rifle loosely based on the "Lewis Gun" from WWI.
---
Again, the AMR from FNV is based on the PGM Hecate II which went into service 1993 and is still manufactured and used today. This doesn't really make sense in the Fallout Universe. I agree that they should find some .50 caliber sniper from the WWII era to replace the role of the AMR as it was in FNV.
---
Executioners explosive double barrel shotgun.. ironically enough was sick of whitesprings so was going to nuke it for better loot and outside of the silo was a 2 star legendary ghoul.. low and behold my baby is sitting there. 
---
It's even worse that I went in there before the quest, and waited for a number that was never called.
---
I don't see what the problem is. West Virginia is famous for its signs about Boston utilities as well as for having all the same wildlife as Massachusetts and Maine. 
---
Ok, when you are in pacifist you cannot fire back to initiate a duel there for when you are being shot by another player you onky take the small amount if damage that is taken when you are not in a duel
---
That link goes to a deleted post.
---
Nice =)
---
Sadly this game may go south quickly if they don’t work their entire body off.
---
Robobrain?
---
Yes. 
---
Soooo.. Thats what I was saying.
---
Or people lying so they get people to riot and forces Bethesda to remove slap dmg.
---
Ok cool - but I think any nuke will draw in other players, right?
---
"creating a mass amount of items"
---
Same and it’s been months. I have no idea! 
---
Ok, but you phrased it weirdly. 
---
Yeah, I had a bunch, lol
---
There's 4 (and more just don't remember), one in the Bed and Breakfast behind the chained door, one on a shelf in the barn near the Ranger station/lookout in the cranberry bog, the hardware store in the town north/Northeast of Grafton on a shelf. The final one which is usually always there due to it's location, is in the clifface descending from the Top of the World, if you know where the deathclaw spawns its at that same elevation to the northeast, a teddy bear will be using it to chop down a tree.
---
I’ll teach you how to make your own secret door and an under the map base
---
Agreed and also attach chains to specific power armors when they're in a station (T-45, T-60)
---
Lol you got suspended for witch hunting and griefing LOL
---
1: Private servers are coming.
---
2: We actually don't have a precedent for Bethesda and servers.  That's both a good thing and a bad thing.  We know that EA is giddy about shutting them down, but I don't believe we have any example of Bethesda doing so.
---
3: By the time this matters, I suspect most players will be off playing some future game.  Perhaps progress from 76 might even carry into that one.
---
Yup, it’s a feature not a bug.  Depending on the perk, perk card cost (how much special it uses) isn’t always perk card rank (how many cards you had to get and combine).
---
20 atom for 7600 hrs damn that is just sad.
---
I am at 300 so long road ahead.
---
Yet like I said. Never created a duped item
---
Yeah thanks for the offer!
---
How many stories?
---
Well it sure as shit does now! 
---
Yeah they need to put some fire under their asses. 
---
People are desperate and are lying to get people on their side and pressure Bethesda to remove slap dmg or even pvp.
---
Same here - although I can confirm that if you get a *second* plan for the mask, you won't be able to learn it. So, at least, the game *is* tracking that you've read the plan.
---
I agree with you and definitely think that events like these would be a great way to get people to play as well as have ppl want to link up and engage with the community
---
This
---
YW!
---
Never gonna happen. but nice try
---
Thanks - yeah don’t want to start any ‘friendly fire’ with OP players...!
---
Tl;dr?  So...many....words.
---
I would be happy if pacifist mode just put you on a server with other pacifist players and if you turn off the pacifist flag, you are warned you will be forcible server hopped to a server that is non-pacifist.
---
Pacifist mode is counter-productive to be mixed on the same server because it means people seeking pvp are denied their preferred game style if they get matched to a server full of pacifists. Similarly, players that want to collaborate or play solo will be denied that option if they get matched to a server with those seeking pvp.
---
Tell that to the motherfucker that took my bag in the distant thunder event. 
---
That happened to me once last night. Haven’t had an issue since. (Xbox)
---
I think most people know what I meant and,didnt argue symantics. No pacifist mode doesnt decrease the damage you take but it does make it so that you never take more than "tiny chip damage". The fact that I have to specify that in such a long wat is crazy to me. I think you know what I mean and are choosing to be willfully ignorant of my meaning, thays not an insukt just the way it seems.
---
These new Fallout Funkos are getting wierd
---
Yeah, the SBQ is such a glitchy thing that you don't need to be of particularly high level so long as others are around.  She spends most of her time stuck on the ground getting whacked in the head.
---
Maybe he got it from that Dev room or something
---
I like this idea 
---
I have the plans for arms &amp; legs, make an offer and they're yours. GT: John_C137
---
Yeah, hopefully they allow a download of the game in single player at some point.
---
A "conservative" increase of 50% would be awesome to start (similar to that of the Stash limit).
---
Dude thanks! Been trying to find one but hardly any info out there. Currently my camp is at that small lake near Vault 76
---
Sure is ... Drop that hammer son 
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking, but I thought it was impossible on Xbox.
---
How is it irrelevant if you literally can’t initiate PvP and take more than slap damage without having pacifist off? You can’t kill someone through slap damage. If you can, the many people that supposedly had it happen have all just miraculously lacked any sort of proof whatsoever. Find me a video or something showing someone dying to slap damage. Not anecdotes from people that don’t seem to understand how it works. I’ll wait. 
---
Ok, sorry, I wasn’t trying to be willfully ignorant but I don’t like to assume things because when that happens mistakes get made, and I would rather double check that you understand than let you go thinking wrongly. Sorry if I upset you. 
---
I really hope in February they do something. Take all the servers down to work on the game or something. Or even stop working on patches that aren’t necessary and work on what the community wants. There are so many ideas that Bethesda should do like adding different types of roofs. A frame, different shaping of roofs so we can all make better camps. New walls, new decorations. Just a lot they need to do
---
What everybody else is saying. This usually happens after you've fired the weapon, then quickly done something else. I'm assuming that the message concerning the removal of ammo (because you fired it) is added to the message queue, but "muted" (likely for debugging purposes). Something about certain actions "unmutes" the messages so you see them.
---
When it happens, think about the circumstances: I think you'll soon realize that, "Yes, I did just fire that weapon four times!"
---
Cheating scumbags should be banned. No sympathy from me. 
---
Freezes every time I finally get on a server. Tried clearing the cache and did a hard reset. Guess I don't get to play now. 
---
Can you login on the website?
---
Thanks. Now where can I find handmade plans?
---
What does TSE stand for? I see it everywhere.
---
Atom store one is retextured. It's orange with patches on, looks clean too. 
---
Finally those people saying they get oneehotted can shut up. Bunch of liars.
---
added.
---
I'm not upset, I just dont uderstand why people are acting like they dont understand what I'm saying. As if I,have never played the game, iys obvioise what I'm talking about even if I didnt say it EXACTLY right.
---
I'm a fan of 76, but would you really want to play it on Console X in 2029? That would be somewhat equivalent to wanting to play Phantasy Star Online on your PS4 right now. I'm sure a few people might be interested in that, but it's doubtful to be a great number. 
---
Oh yeah I missed it. it's a personal thing. I spent most of the atoms on stuff for my camp. I did buy the cowboy hat. 
---
Not much of the store stuff appeals to me
---
Yep just happened to me tonight thought it was my controller messing up. Problems don't seem to get better.
---
I just say that as a 76 fan who has had too much to drink tonight, I am getting a huge laugh out of these comments.  Honestly I've done some of this shit, it's hilarious to read about others who have had similar experiences.  Scrap on my brothers and sisters, I'll see you in the wasteland.  (My username on PS4 is OtakuWoody if anyone actually wants to see me in the wasteland).
---
I'm pvping you if I see you trying to kill them&gt;: /
---
So ban by making the game 100% better than bethesda could? Seems like they want to kill the game and betray all their players. 
---
Pretty sad that you have to have one or two people clearing out the shed to kill the SBQ nowadays. A fun way to do so without getting bounty is to kite over some mobs and let them do the work.
---
You were banned for duping, go to bethesda and create an account with your associated email, then they will send u an email saying I were banned 
---
Your CAMP.
---
Yes! Man, I just want to boil some water. 
---
No scumbags here. Just have to make the game enjoyable
---
Honestly they need to find a way to make it so the server isn't so reliant on people having small inventories. It sucks that just because one person gets 1000000 stim packs i have to GTFO of the server. 
---
Interesting points all. 
---
Now I don’t know anything about dupes. To me it’s all just something people are moaning about. Is duping really breaking servers? Like... really? meaning is there proof? Or do their servers still have some serious fucked up problems. I mean. I’m not mad if it’s their servers. Ya know it’s not like they were going to knock it out of the park the first try. Hell, did you play WoW when it first launched? It was a horrible shit show. So this topic point is, is it really duping/exploit/stuff? Or did you all jump on the bandwagon with no knowledge?
---
What I say is, the crying and witch hunts are utterly shite. 
---
If there’s actual proof and real reps from
---
Bethesda can gain notes and have some folks fix problems that can be proven to be the cause, yea we should care.  And to my prior point about servers or duper’s... well both are Bethesda’s fault. Some people enjoy exploits. It’s their favorite shit. Been that way since games could be played online. I think it’s shit too. But I just keep on rolling myself. 
---
But honestly, I’ll never care if someone has stuff first, or has stuff I don’t. That’s just sad jealous, whiney, entitled crap. All the people who worked hard on their characters and have a two shot weapon are not necessarily duper’s. Seriously. Just because someone has something you don’t doesn’t mean they cheated to get it. That’s asinine. Im not being “cockblocked” I’m playing my own game lol. Nothing is making you play with douchers. 
---
I haven't had a single crash yet and I'm level 30-40ish, does it normally happen at specific times or while doing things??
---
I get accused of bypassing slap damage all the time so allow me to explain what could be going on for some of these people if it's the same scenario that I do. If I see someone fairly high level with a workshop ill start and fail a claim on said workshop then fast travel to where they were on my map. They'll still be hostile and its a nice method of farming caps and junk for me. If the player is particularly toxic ill go back to their workshop again and repeat the process. You would be surprised how many would rather claim I'm using some sort of damage exploit rather than  believe my explanation on how I killed them 
---
That last look up before death made me snicker.
---
Nukagirl outfit can't be worn over anything else, similar to the hazmat suit. Not sure why the did that, possibly bugged.

Dont believe this oneshot through dmg lie pls. Read this and scroll to slap dmg part.

Can't say that I haven't. Found they guy that had been trashing my camp, repeatedly. Killed him, collected bounty, stole all his junk, leveled his base.
---
Perks of being relatively high level, with a camp in the starter zone. He was not expecting someone with 40 levels on him to pop up and wreck him. Why he respawned, and immediately fast traveled to his camp without storing his junk, I'll never know.

One of my dream weapons is a Vampire's Drill with faster swing (that actually works). I currently have a Vampire's Mr. Handy Buzz Blade and I can tank almost anything while using it but it's too weak. These kind of weapons lose damage as they degrade and break, but using the Weapon Artisan perk can double the damage. I also have another Mr. Handy Buzz Blade with "faster swing" but it seems to not have any benefit over a normal version.
---
I don't see how duping made the game.better for anyone ?
---
for me its been happening alot around watoga as of last patch
---
Simple
---
Exploiting the game is not an accidental thing and against the TOS. Dupers also did not care for the community or the server stability. 
---
So why should we care about dupers?.

Two Shot Explosive

Are you talking about the farm house by the nuka plant on the water that has the power armor station in the shed?  If so I thought about moving my camp there because so secluded and had the PA station and could do a water purifier.

&gt; How many Bro's were there in WV? Everything i've read seems to say that there were only a couple dozen and we find all their bodies. Did the California section send a squad? How did WV's get their technology?

Here's the story of the Appalachian BoS:
---
&gt;!At 9:47 am on October 23rd, 2077, Army Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy and her unit of Rangers (aka Taggerdy's Thunder) were at Spruce Knob Lake, beginning a war game exercise with two detachments of Marines. Two kilometers out from the engagement zone, the unit's communications specialist, Johnny Moreno, picked up unusual chatter on the radio--confirmation of a nuclear strike on New York, immediately followed by general panic before complete silence. After realizing it wasn't an embellishment to the exercise, the Thunder took shelter in a nearby cave. Several days later, Moreno finally found a radio response over band AH-13: Captain Roger Maxson, the leader of the recent desertion at Mariposa and a friend (and former CO) of Lt. Taggerdy. After convincing Taggerdy of his cause and the potential danger of remaining US leadership, she and the Thunder decided to keep in touch with Maxson and eventually made their way to Camp Venture, a survivalist training camp with a supply drop point. Soon afterward, Maxson contacted them over the radio with his plan for a new organization: the Brotherhood of Steel.!&lt;
---
&gt;!The new Brotherhood, led by the newly-titled Paladin Taggerdy, began recruiting and then expanding its operations, claiming Allegheny Asylum, the Thunder Mountain Power Plant, the Grafton Dam, and Spruce Knob as additional operating bases. Initial contact with the main civilian survivor factions (the Responders and the Free States) were tentative (Thunder Mountain and Camp Venture were previously occupied by Free States members) but more-or-less successful, as the BoS helped secure trade lines across the Raider-filled mountains and led a (temporarily successful) offensive into the Super Mutant-infested Huntersville.!&lt;
---
&gt;!However, Appalachia did not continue to improve for long. By 2086, a new threat had begun emerging from beneath the ground: the Scorchbeasts. As the hideously overgrown bats made their presence known throughout the Cranberry Bog, the BoS began to study the creatures and set up defenses to hem them in. However, the seemingly endless waves of the creatures and their plague-enslaved attendants strained the Brotherhood's resources to their limit. Demanding additional supplies from the Responders and Free States, Taggerdy's soldiers lost favor with their civilian allies. Worse, the data they had sent to their Californian brothers was answered with a dire prediction of the Scorched presenting a potential extinction-level event... and the satellites used for their continued contact were deteriorating.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Alone and without backup, Paladin Taggerdy organized a last-ditch Hail Mary plan to take out the Scorchbeasts at the source, appropriately named Operation Touchdown. Running through the Glassed Cavern, Taggerdy, Moreno, and many other members of the Brotherhood destroyed a significant number of Scorchbeasts and their minions, bringing down the creatures' numbers for a time at the cost of the entire operation team. However, the victory was only temporary, and the Scorchbeasts returned in even greater numbers for revenge. Missing their leadership, running out of supplies, out of allies, out of men, the remaining members of the Brotherhood were overwhelmed by the Scorched.!&lt;
---
&gt;!Without the Brotherhood to organize the defensive systems that held the Scorched within the Bog, the Free States and the Responders quickly learned that the threat was real, and just as dangerous as the Brotherhood had warned them. Lacking the firepower and power armor deployed by the Brotherhood, town after town fell to the Scorched.!&lt;
---
&gt; The inoculation was prepared and ready - did everyone get wiped out in 1 day?
---
It was *not* prepped and ready, the scientist working on it died to the Scorched shortly before completing the formula (leaving it for the player to finish).
---
The times I don’t crash out... the boss bugs and I get no loot.  Three kills finally last night.  Only got loot once... i swear if it’s not one thing it’s three others.  
---
I love it. This is what I bought fo76 to do, well that and to simulate junk collecting. I put the game aside at the beginning of this month when I began building my masterpiece home and it bugged. IT then bugged 3 additional times in 3 different locations before I could complete, forcing me to deconstruct completely. So for now I gave up. In a month or two I will be back and your house gives me the motivation to still want to come back. thanks!
---
Taking, defending and retaking gets you plans. It becomes a free fast travel point. You get free resources from extractors. 
---
Aight, I'm gonna be real with you chief
---
I have no idea what a TSE weapon is
---
Nice!  This game does have some awesome opportunities for photos.
---
Dude, what the hell are you on about? I literally just said I, personally, slapped a person for 2/3rds of their health with just a regular double barrel. A TSE with appropriate perks Alone does 6x that much damage. You can very easily get slap damage high enough to kill someone.
---
It's irrelevant whether they were pacifist or not because we're talking about slap damage I dealt to him, which can't be turned off by entering pacifist mode. 
---
Awesome does it have lead and junk extractors?
---
No. Further south towards the (totally blanking on the name) amusement park. You can see the nuka plant from the house. No shed, but there is a surprise in the bathroom. 
---
Only 2 but the base of the house is built on a rock already a story or so high. 
---
I got crap luck been a few days and nothing 
---
Ha ha sounds awesome, buddy.
---
just wondering, is it all black ? the store pics doesn’t really show the whole thing 
---
Do you mean the combat army helmet?   They are rare but available in the game.  I picked one up at the ammo dump near sons of Dane compound.   Hell if you’re on Pc you can have mine
---
They mean for themselves, as they're earning themselves caps or actual money. 
---
I noticed the same thing one time with pocketed. I didn't pay much attention but I'm pretty sure I had 15 carry on one piece. But when I tried modding I only got 5 and 10. I didn't look into it or pay more attention to it. Pockets on armor became irrelevant when I started using Excavator.
---
Youre delusional. 
---
Ah, thanks.
---
Do you have white springs jumpsuit, BOS jumpsuit, or white powder jumpsuit?
---
Better gear, better weapons, more resources, better economy by having a great marketplace. People always wanting to trade for something they dont have. Grindimg and grinding for something vut never finding that one piece you need and then you meet someone that has an extra so you trade. Better support? I mean its simple
---
And as they add more perk cards (which i assume they will) in the future, it will be even more tedious. If a card doesn't modify some kind of stat; like weight, DR, +dam, or detection, just have it work all the time passively.
---
The whole Perk system as it is needs one hell of an overhaul. If only this wasnt an online game, we could fix it ourselves. like always.
---
I mean this [https://i.imgur.com/hSQi3si.png](https://i.imgur.com/hSQi3si.png)
---
Yes perhaps not to apologize for intentional bad behaviour.
---
But still, I do it, while not intending to do it. So in that sense I'm sorry, more to myself.
---
Legendaries usually survive few shots even with sneak and other criticals, but when I see some below 70 level player around I try to only damage regular high level enemies, so they get ammo, gear and XP out of those high level enemies.
---
?? Trancended to being juvenile??  When was teabagging not juvenile :)   Sarcasm of course :)
---
With the right perks you can almost ones hot anyone, with exploits presented so far you will one shot anyone that **consents into pvp**. Bobble exploited shotgun doing 100k damage does little to no damage to players who don't engage because slap damage caps out to very little.
---
 With pacifist mode on, there are still ways you can accidently consent into pvp without knowing. Once your engaged, you can ignore them but they can keep finding you.
---
At the time did you, or your teammates control any workshops?
---
I don't treat them like a goodie goodie, I berate them in a very concise and logical way that won't trigger an automatic shutdown of their willingness to take my comments seriously. I also provide thoughts on how it happens, what may help and even throw a little sugar in about what does work very well associated to the issue. This has worked wonders for me over the 2 decades I have been giving feedback to devs about their games and has lead to many long threads on the issues I have posted as opposed to no response at all.
---
I would take out the traveling pharmacist and add 3 more puts into 2h damage perk cards
---
I also like using the endurance perk that gives +3 strength in daylight. This gives a huge boost alongside radicol and strange in numbers. But idk if your special is speced for this 
---
I was just implying I have the vendor bot held. Sorry.
---
Where did you buy it from?

I haven't even seen a normal chainsaw let alone a legendary lol :(

Follow the main and side quests. Tons of xp for completing them. I'm over level 40 and never had to stop to "farm" xp.

pistols are lightweight and fire extremely fast. they are designed for v.a.t.s or hip fire run and gun playstyles. 
---
they do reasonable damage. i have a 2 shot pipe pistol that puts in hard work in v.a.t.s. they dont take up much AP to fire, and in tandem with concentrated fire, your damage and accuracy gets bonkers.
---
its dev room item that people have stolen out of and duped for people not knowing it will get you banned.

Can confirm that the trade exploit was fake, I’m the guy in the enclave outfit in OP’s linked video to test the glitch with all the steps we could find. On that note, different people told different stories about how the glitch was done, none of which were correct
---
[https://youtu.be/mDsqElkfHLw?t=455](https://youtu.be/mDsqElkfHLw?t=455)
---
What it sounds like. 
---
I’m guessing you’d have to be pretty annoying to catch a ban though. The boilerplate response from Bethesda when reporting basically says to ignore anyone causing you trouble. 
---
They are just jerk griefers.  Most of us aren't like that.  I'm pretty high level and if I caught anyone pulling that I would try to stop them and help rebuild if needed.  Don't give up on the game.  There are many good people playing.

Yeah between 20-30 was a weird hump to get over for me too. Go exploring, get out there and look around. Have u gone all the way South in the ash heap? What about up to Grafton?
---
I found one at Mountainside Bed and Breakfast!
---
Holy shit what a waste of time to write this or read it!
---
STOPPPPP I WOULD BUY ALLLLLLLL THE ATOMS..... WOULD LITERALLY GIVE BETHESDA MY FIRST BORNS BLOOD... SERIOUSLY.... NOT KIDDING.... PUT IT IN THE GAME ...
---
i feel like rank 3 psycho should let you dual fire. it would be amazing in v.a.t.s
---
My vampiric tesla rifle works quite well against hordes. The multiple his makes the Ho gain meaningful.

I waiting for an official comment from Bethesda but I have to say, I'm getting pretty stoked seeing these reports. They knowingly exploited the game at the cost of others. They made their bed and now they should lie in it.
---
😁👍
---
Not really.  I THINK Trapper armor has...some...radiation resistance as well as Marine Combat Armor.  Not oodles and oodles though.  If you add the "Leaded" mod you can probably get some.  I'd guess you can probably craft a set that will get you around 200ish rad resist.  Add in the right legendary perks and you could get *maybe* 300-400 with a God set.  That's not counting the apparent "hidden" resistance that power armor and hazmat suits give.
---
The armor you saw drop was simply either marine armor (has extra radiation resistance by default) or had the legendary effect which adds radiation resist (+25).
---
Just today I had a guy a third of my level come to my camp and started attacking me with a power fist. I had max level blocker perk on and 400+ DR and this guy was still doing ridiculous damage to me. I had to use a stimpack every 6-7 seconds to heal the damage he was doing. Im not sure I would have had time to go to my settings and turn pacifist off without him killing me. Wouldnt have mattered anyways because his little buddy was off to the side with a gun out waiting for me to fight back. 
---
So what do you mean your not convinced people can be killed by slap damage? Do you think the damage just stops and leaves you with a sliver of health? I doubt it.
---
That game is a dumpster fire get a refund while you can. red dead story mode is amazing 
---
Thank you sir for sharing that video, what I thought was true was just another myth.
---
lol at first I thought you were just being a Smartass! Then I tried it and was actually really happy to see it's like double speed. 
---
Thank you! Did not know that one.
---
Doesn’t pretty much every other MMO do this already for unique items?  
---
Ive found 1. Technically just as rare as tse for me at this point. Haha
---
Certain armor is bugged (I think it's raider or trapper) and gives 15 for "pocketed" when it should only be 5. The "deep pocketed" still only gives 10.
---
Yeah that outfit looked pretty bad-a.  Support a combat shotgun with it.
---
I'm not on ps4 but I would say just un equip the card and equip it again 
---
I like it. The server can still duplicate items, so your stuff is still safe from inventory loss do to crashes in the like. However, only one will be usable in the event it duplicates the item unnecessarily. 
---
If it *IS* something they can code, I would guess it could be applied to your whole inventory. Once the item enters your inventory it's given a unique ID. Seems like a nice middle ground performance/stability wise between every item having a unique ID and no items having one.
---
My education certainly does NOT include programming though, so I don't exactly have ground to stand on here lol.
---
This right here until you're closer to level 50.
---
All the time, mind blowing when I hear ppl say "game works fine for me" stop lying every bug I see other ppl have I have on a regular basis also.
---
The strangler blooms are where you found the first one. Look at roots, tree bases, and rocks. They glow, so try at night.
---
If so then I dont see why Bethesda woukd want to pass this up 
---
True, if OP was wreaking havoc on dupers he definitely would catch a ban on griefing ..
---
Imo just make it an actual PvP toggle instead of just effectively being one sort of. Turned on? You can't be hit or hit other players (or their CAMPS). Turned off, you can.  Full damage. 
---
Did that and did it with log in and out a few times, still not working.
---
/megaphone 
---
***IGNORE ME***
---
That's what I thought but it looked pretty dirty in the preview. 
---
I like that, if its inventory based then it can seriously take a whole lot of stress off the servers rather than scanning individual items. 
---
Huh.  That's a pretty big deal if it doesn't give the -2 PER penalty.
---
Ok so, we..us....cant make legendary armor?
---
I mean that is your opinion. I havent duped but I dont disagree with duppers in anyway. Not cheating if it was in the game. Hackers cheat. Using exploits does not mean you cheat. 
---
I found a clean ski cap in-game. 
---
A "P" or symbol on the nametag so indicate they're Pacifist.
---
yeah glowing green or red ones would be cool and maybe a bigger one
---
Would be more difficult to implement now with the massive number of legendaries already in circulation. 
---
A simpler solution to the current problem (paired with this to ensure no more issues moving forward) would be to have an algorithm inspect the inventories of every player at login and looks for excessive stacks. Got 100 of the same legendary gun?  Got 10k bottles of Nuka-Cola?  Bye-bye. 
---
You can always claim workshops, you'll get xp for just standing there! Barely anyone uses them anyway and there's a few spread across the map.
---
Try to roll in a squad too and just have the motivational card active also.
---
Most people bought their TSEs. Many of those are duped.
---
That would be convenient, saves FT'ing back to your base to repair damaged weapons. (Y)  
---
Regardless of how easy or not it is to dupe and regardless of your opinion on how fun the game is, duping is clearly against the TOS and they got banned for it, simple as that
---
I've been thinking about this too. But always justify it because the game has been so broken it would probably just get abused somehow. Sucks for legit players because vardent season is bullshit.
---
Sorry I dont think I can help 😕
---
Hell, I'd be happy with a wood pile I can place next to it, even it if was strictly cosmetic.
---
Bonus points for being able to light it for sure though.
---

YOU HAVE CONTRACTED GLOWING PUSTULES 
---
Lol. That is impressive. 
---
Been trying to play for the last 30 minutes or so, game keeps freezing, server not responding message a few times, can't move, can't fire weapons, can't jump, can't use pipboy, can only open the map. Frustrating to say the least, and I'm on Xbox.
---
That could work too. If it detects that player exited with 50 Quantums and logged in with 100 then it can remove the extra duplicated 50
---
Another common tactic is a low level bait player.  Some little guy will come running up to you and tag you. After you stomp him, his high level buddies open up on you and take your stuff. 
---
You've spent more time on this post than I have in the game over the last month.  Thank you for your efforts!!
---
It does indeed! It would be better if I could find a group of people to take screenshots of but I work with what I have.
---
It looks like those may be event-only rewards based on a spreadsheet posted earlier.
---
I've seriously been disconnected or my game has frozen right at the last part twice now too! 
---
200hr, 2 rad storms. One lasted 5 seconds, the other lasted 30 seconds.
---
I wish a troll would ask me to remove his bounty lol. He would regret it 😎
---
Game expects everyone to have a tse to even do damage to her. She needs a huge HP nerf or her scaling needs a serious rework.
---
Burn them alive. I'll bring the marshmallows.

Notice even you said they were banned for:

And not witchhunting

Even you know this argument is based on nothing
---
I've been constantly losing connection these last 2 hours or so. Makes doing any kind of quest nearly impossible
---
I think it does actually
---
I’m a noob. What are “TSE” and “instigation” weapons?
---
PS4 has been a nightmare for me since update with blue screens and disconnections.
---
I was thinking it would be super cool is if instead of being full size, the display could be the size of a bobnle head that way you can actually display the power armors you have as decoration as well around the interior of your camp then when you interect with it it give you the option to place into inventory. 
---
Except that the duplicated items won’t be in their inventory until after they login and reclaim them from whoever or whatever is holding the second set.  Just look for ridiculous amounts, use their inventory weight as a tell-tale sign. Got 1M lbs of crap on you?  You’re on obvious duper. 
---
Yeah. I read a theory saying that since this is their first multiplayer game they’ll have us fix the game. It said something like how in the trailer “and when the fallout settles” the dividing between the fans, “you must rebuild. Not just walls, not just buildings. But hearts and minds. And ultimately America itself.” We as a community need to come together to help make the game better. If I could remember the name of the post I’d give you the link. But it makes some sense ig because Fallout has never been multiplayer so for them to sort of make the game bad and then have the community fix it, it’s like a test game for any other future multiplayer’s they wanna do.
---
Yes, I think that would be the best 'consolation' option. Ideally, we place them anywhere but, in a pinch, at least if we have anchor points, it *could* work. We would need enough of each item to have some real choice though. Otherwise, it ends-up looking incredibly similar, just with slightly different items, from base-to-base.
---
So maybe it is happening across platforms that was the same thing happening to me, but it started about 2 hours ago.  Very frustrating 
---
Scorched will pick up weapons people drop and use them
---
I really loved not knowing what mods I might discover.  
---
It does, it's just not listed in the description.
---
Or just have one guy be he CAMP guy that drops the whole base. 
---
Yeah don't expect any enemies attacking, the worst I had was a molerat or two coming from down the road.
---
Most of these cards are stupid to have as perks in the first place. If cards are swapable and they're only useful in specific situations, serious players are going to swap them.  
---
Also, Perk Load Manager.  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
If i remember correctly, moving your camp stores and repairs all of the object in the camp, but I don't know about turrets or plants. Then again Bethesda mighta removed that. Try it though, even if it's only like 10 meters away, the blueprint should still come up as available to place.
---
I used to do it all the time, someone comes in and destroys 30 items and wastes a couple hundred bullets and a bunch of nades only to see my house reappear two feet west of the ruins, back in full working order.
---
Ya they can't even figure out how to work junk in your stash ,so ya they are totally gonna assign and track unique IDs for all these items...sure if you wanna play at 5 fps I guess.
---
Curious what their threshold is.  I've gone on ammo creation sessions that make up many thousands of rounds after super-duper and ammosmith procs.
---
Also kind of wondering about the camp item guys.  Buddy had a heck of a lot of camp items at one time due to the bug.
---
I know some military equipment was shipped without paint (here is looking at you P-51 and P-47) but why is all the power armour in bare metal? Only parts of the T-51bs are olive drab IIRC.
---
I mean soda factories managed to get suits painted in corporate colors but the military, the prime customer, got bare units?
---
I understand that the idea in the current game is to sell paint schemes for profit but really. Let us have basic colors at least! 
---
It's a molerat costume. Rare but they are in game. People are also buying them out of game for real money. 
---
No idea, too lazy to look into it. Runs NV great, runs 4 great. Runs Morrowind with a metric fuck ton of mods, as well as Skyrim. So my laziness i feel is justified, by scientific deduction. 
---
TL;DR: It's not the hard drive. 
---
DING DING DING! You are correct! It was a level 80 scorch beast! God damn that fucking sonic blast attack!
---
I’d agree, but with ALL plans.
---
I’d also like the shared stash with all broken down junk items being weightless.  I can’t see this being a stability issue as they’re just a limited number of stacks. Wouldn’t apply to junk that’s not been broke down yet. 
---
TSE-two shot explosive. Weapons that deal about 8 times what their normal counterparts do.
---
It's worth it for the fun of the kill, IF you're lucky enough to have a say in whether or not you have to fight it :/
---
I agree that, when we have nothing of what we want, having almost anything seems worlds better. If it's all presets, then we sort of end-up with a similar issue of everyone's base looking very similar internally, even though we have a myriad of styles we all use.
---
That said, I don't dislike the idea, because, it is a slight bit more than we have now..
---
I have looked into FO76Edit, because I wanted this armor to. It was sadly cut from the game.
---
5k caps for both?
---
It has a mix of stats.  BOS Heavy Combat Armor gives far and away the most physical resistance.  Marine armor doesn't give as much physical protection but you get some rad resist (completely absent on the regular combat armor).
---
It's like people only want to filter the positive RNG moment when RNG doesn't care what you get.
---
Except they cap at 40.
---
they can't take items out of containers, and that's the only way someone can drop an item. 
---
I like your post overall, tbf if people weren't so outraged by duping they probably would have reasoned that disconnects and crashes occur because of many other things. After the console patch (idk if that workshop issue is fixed yet) I still get server not responding messages while roaming appalachia and also while crafting 20+ food items.
---
While I have no testing data or any source to reference, I was of strong belief that most of the server instability was not due to duping but due to the whitespring army that would be found on every single server. I feel like tracking that many AI entities on a server would offer much more instabilty. Not to mention that the most popular duping method at the time doesn't disconnect the whole server lile you said, but just the one doing it and sometimes those in the cell. Howver it did indeed perpetuate the "server not responding messages".
---
Sadly the fact that the popularized duping method and whitespring robot spawns were fixed in the same patch, one can't tell which was the bigger issue. All I know is my game is slightly more stable majority of the time while referencing freezes and fps hiccups, I still crash about the same though lol.
---
Also there is definitely still duping methods, just not a highly popularized one. I know of one method in fact that I ran into recently and was able to reproduce. I don't know if it was one of those known from before B.E.T.A as someone mentioned. On the bright side it can't offer cause any instabilty to the servers. And as far as I'm concerned the market has been messed up from the moment cap stash farming hiked up majority of the prices for trading. Some duping regulated it and then more duping pushed the market to the other extreme. Although I find the market to be highly irrelevant in the first place until there is a text chat for the server.
---
TSE's are so tainted now that this isn't something to laud but look down upon.
---
It happened to me last week.
---
I went into Watoga High School to do the monster mash. I noticed a Small yellow triangle moving around so I assumed there was another player in the event. I ran down the hallway towards the mask and next thing you know I see a bunch of laser beams shoot past me and immediately cut to the death sequence.
---
I re-spawned and immediately find the prick squatting in the corner with his little yellow triangle floating over his head. I stabbed him several times with my trusty switch blade and fast traveled to the other side of the map without completing the event and blocked the player.
---
I have been on pacifist mode for several weeks. This was my first time experiencing any type of PVP so I didn't know that this was an exploit. I wish I would have reported this player.
---
This is a terrible lie.
---
I’ll buy it if it is still availabe. My IGN is Lead_Paint
---
Congratulations! Good luck convincing anyone that it's not duped lol!
---
There are four locations that I am aware of, Mountain Side Bed and Breakfast, Ranger Headquarters, Clarksburg Hardware Store, and a camp  to the west of Top of the World.
---
i've killed the queen 4 times out of at least the 20 times i've faced her.
---
i am offline rn but i will be online later tomorrow, keep an eye out for luficr :) 
---
did you actually Dupe?
---
Then they need to come up with a better solution or better technique on finding out who exactly is doing the dupe and not ban the innocent players who never duped out of the bans. I dont even think the dupers should get banned let alone the ones never dupped as well
---
You can add me TheMeiserVader
---
Why not make everything account based - perks, caps, items, storage...
---
Can't say that I'm a fan. Just limits future replayability.
---
Thanks but,idc pretty much everything has been duped at this point. 
---
Correct. We cannot make it, although we can modify existing legendary armor like normal.
---
Alright. Gonna be a little before I can hop into a group. Internets fighting me right now
---
I’m level 54 and I feel like I still know nothing about this game lol
---
Good call, and I agree. I should have made that point clearer in my initial post: any and all plans, once unlocked, would be unlocked across all characters. That would definitely be the ideal.
---
All gatling plasma guns watch the AI miss and quit the game 
---
I've been seeing a lot of mobs where legendary's drop from non legendary's and legendary enemies don't drop legendary's. The last patch seemed to sacrifice a lot in terms of stability too.
---
Not my 3* hunting rifle that dropped from the queen! Im still excited about it
---
Ah, did not realize they could do that. Makes sense.
---
Nice!
---
With online games, the more account bound things you do, the better. Back in my WoW days, I had guildmates that not only had alts of every class, but sometimes more than 1 of each class! The grind they went through was insane 
---
Sounds like Dupers got banned.  I deduce that from the comments “100% of players have duped items” nope
---
What’s yours?
---
Any chance it was the Tattered Mole outfit without the head?
---
https://youtu.be/e88NpCU6ikI
---
Yeah bosses drop legendaries ..it seems their loot is better lol
---
Thanks
---
Angelofdeath116 
---
I think this is awesome. Any increase drop chance/xp gain would be awesome (in combination to what it already in game(IE STACKS)) all online games have these or at least have these available in the store. 
---
Exactly! That and this toy event does nothing to raise enjoyment of the game nor get ppl excited
---
You're welcome!
---
You recently looted it, left area and returned, or changed servers and tried to reloot. 
---
Yes it has both
---
Rule #1 of PvP. Stash all junk before you engage anyone
---
Ya know as of late I've been seeing that less and less. I'm starting to think that the game is starting to crap out on everyone.
---
Just use the one at Whitespring Station. And if its for crafting while at the bunker, all crafting stations are linked to your stash anyway.
---
Lmao ur school blocks bethnet and not reddit???
---
I did this yesterday. I was too busy laughing to hate it.
---
&gt; friend of mine shot me a pic of his email from Bethesda indefinitely banning him for duping, even though this guy duped like maybe 3 times lol
---
I love how putting a "lol" at the end makes this all OK.  Imagine if we'd had that trick throughout history.  I'm not a crook lol.  I didn't have sexual relations with that woman lol.  Fuck it was only six million jews lol.
---
Some people aren’t that smart. 
---
It’s also common in the nuke zones to get free hardened mass. 
---
Please if you earned it, use it with pride who cares what others say, just one shot them ;)
---
Hoe do u use the terminal to keep it locked 
---
Very nice! I haven't seen any Legendary Hunting rifles yet. What was it?
---
I've posted a few threads with my camps. Just tore down my latest to try something new. Feel free to throw me an message: PSN: Ratiocinate
---
Good Samaritans are also sufficient. 
---
U wanna run whitesprings with me ? I'll be on in 30 mins
---
Yeah, I've gotten 2 in the time it's taken me to get 3 jetpacks and 3 stealth boy mods for 3 characters.
---
What sounds better "this is this games studio's first time with our engine" or "every one of our studio's is helping building this game" it was marketing todd is the hype man you never believe the hype man 
---
Add me and I guess so. May not be much help but I'll do what I can.
---
Made a post an hour ago saying the same. I don’t think they fucked up some how.
---
Bruh no worries I'm level 45 but u don't have to be high level there at all
---
They better make it rain atomssssssssss
---
Wow! Useful info, thanks! I was thinking about devoting time, energy &amp; perks to trying to tame something. I'll wait for the fix now, so y'all have spared me (and perhaps others) grief in the meantime.
---
Personally haven't seen innocent players being banned so I think it is working. Dont blindly trust people being banned that say they are innocent, to my knowledge bans are flagged automatically but done manually so there likely are no screw-ups. 
---
Also, why should dupers not be banned? Doing something clearly against TOS results in a ban and duping is against TOS.
---
Yeah, trying to worry about collecting toys for radiation resistance is weird. Seems geared towards new players that don't know anything about mid to late game.
---
That seems too much, I'll take 2k for both. Just join on me.
---
I played for several hours, the only time I got booted was I tried to jump to server a friend was on.
---
Yeah. Two random disconnects here so far tonight. Also, a very long wait at the initial signing in load screen.
---
I partly blame bethesda for making it a cakewalk to allow mass duping in the first place. There’s just so much shit happening with the game right now it’s hard to feel excited for anything they do.
---
Alright. I should be on for it. Snuck around and turned the kids' phones off so they don't destroy my connection.
---
No joke,  I'm sure that's why they didn't implement it in the first place (at least that's what I'm telling myself). As OP said,  only tracking certain items would account for items that are most beneficial to dupe while limiting the amount of performance it eats up. 
---
It always amazes me the number of problems that pop up because the developer assumed people would be noble and just ignore exploitable mechanics. 
---
Yeah. But it gets annoying when anyone that owns a TSE is assumed to either be a duper, or buy from them. Kinda hard to show it off when the response will be "OmG yOu DuPeR ScUm! Y cAnT yOu PlAy WiThOuT cHeAtS!?!?!" I feel sorry for people that earn them the legit way 
---
Newcomer here. Where exactly are people dropping this stuff? I would love to access some of it. All I have is melee weapons right now.
---
Sounds good. I'm not online right now. I have to be up early in the morning. Will you be online tomorrow?
---
That’s perfect, thanks again! 
---
Ppl show off in whitesprings as level 10 ..no lie
---
Damn nobody knows?
---
Yes same here and there were times when I was booted saying I could rejoin my team, but I was soloing!  It took what felt like forever to get back every time I was booted.
---
Also, says I can't send you a friend request because of your settings.
---
Most people seem to disagree with you mate. 
---
If you search this sub, people have given some pretty specific tips and tricks and you won't have to wait for an answer :)
---
Dude, did your really just compare duping to the flippin Holocaust?
---
No I did not dupe. I only casually play the game. 
---
metal is dope, robot is doper and raider is the sexiest .. choices. I know it's hard but if you want to reproduce you choose raider.
---
What lvl are you? Do you want BoS instead? 
---
I will be later in the day. See you then.
---
"To me BR games feel like there is nothing to achieve(except new T-shirt)"

The main objective of a game is to entertain you, and Fortnite is a very entertaining game which I play with my friends. I don't know what else do you want to 'achieve' from a video game.
---
My husband had been having the blue screen issue a lot on his ps4 pro.  It makes me sad because it has turned him off from playing.  
---
I'd pay for it in the atom shop for sure! 
---
You still have to go you inventory, click T or mouse click to perks. Then, click again once or twice to swap to the correct load out.  Then, pick the lock and repeat the same process to go back to your build.  Explain how this fixes the issue?  I can equip my lockpick perks just as fast as the mod can.
---
There is no game balance loss or gain by making these perks passive.  
---
The one you place doesn’t generate cores, it makes 100 power though
---
Sweet, thank you. I appreciate it.
---
Counter point...make the slap damage \*reflect* slap damage back at the aggressor until PvP actions are returned by the target.
---
Ughhh I kno I keep forgetting to update settings..sorry imma add u as soon as I get on
---
Great post, this is very important. 
---
This should be used with any information on the internet, we all have to learn this lesson. And many things would not run into hype- or hate-trains, shitstorms and media-uproar. But even the biggest medias quote unchecked sources and rumors today, often with full intend to create an uproar out of clickbait and attention grabbing reasons. And people tend to hop on these topics triggered by false informations and rumors.
---
What level are you?
---
If we get a few ppl we should start a reddit chat
---
I had a bug earlier where if the materials were on me, and not in my stash box, even with correct amounts it wouldnt let me construct what I was building. Perhaps make sure each component is in your stash box?
---
I'm 500 hrs into the game and have had no problems with harassment, I play a female avatar and rarely use voice chat unless spoken to directly, call it a sociological test. I am on PC and the worst I have seen was a definite harassment issue that was solved quite quickly by much higher level players intervening on behalf of the player being targeted. We are a good community and I feel that the problem causers are not the players who have played Fallout in all it's incarnations but players that got this game explicitly for the MMOPvP aspect of it. Just an opinion from an old fart.
---
My supervisor hoardes clipboards...
---
I counted 11 on his desk....
---
*He ain't gonna use those springs!!*
---
I agree they dun messed up! Hopefully they are fixing it! Sorry I didn’t see your post or I would have commented there.
---
New to actually using Reddit besides reading. But yeah we could do that if we have a couple.
---
It's the nature of the beast.  Don't play an online multi-player game if you're super wound tight about uncontrollable changes to your character.
---
Most I ever see is a free respec when there's a major change.  If the gear meta changes it's kind of a bonus because that means you have new goals.
---
I have a new issue since patch - every so often when I load in or fast travel the screen is completely black. The compass at the bottom of the screen is still there and I can hear myself moving and can access and see the map.
---
Just cant see the game.
---
Fast travelling again doesn't resolve it and I am forced to quit out to menu and rejoin to resolve.
---
Not happening too often - just an odd one
---
No worries was more trying to work out if it was me or the game. It was really stable for me intill this update 
---
Atm I suggest you to delay the taming cause probably there are some bugs with the tamed animals (bug the storage budget if they die/camp move) I'm hardly going to sleep now. Btw If you scroll a bit the reddit tuo can double check what I say. I'm victim too. Btw taming an animal is pretty simple. There are some youtube video that are perfectly clean how to do it and where to search the mobs.
---
It's nice to know that the experience of dealing with Service NSW is replicated worldwide, regardless of the name we give the motor registry :)
---
Just a suggestion u should have a few character different builds 
---
You need a team mate that can handle stuff with ya. What platform are you on?
---
Dunno.  Had a friend come back from training for several weeks and he was discouraged that there hasn't been any significant new content.
---
Yes please, would be extremely helpful
---
Funny, my Enclave underarmor clips through the BOS Bomber Jacket outfit, and my BOS Underarmor, if I wear it under my Power Armor, costs me 54 damage, energy, and rad resists. Buggy stuff.

You never bought a single TSE weapon or junk/flux/serums or armor on the marketplace? If you did you have a duped item. If you didn't well stay up on that high horse and ride high into the sunset in an empty game.
---
I would have the occasional glitch, but it’s expected,  tonight was insane.
---
Funny story limb hits hurt and headshots even more .. until you get a redonk weapon take advantage of the fact your human. I 2 shot a level 68 today with a level 16 .. holding a pipe revolver .. up until you're ready and perked take advantage of sneak attacks and drugs .. anything that alleviates the level gap.
---
Ghost busters three huh? Lol
---
same..
---
Working on it, haven't played a ton and don't have time to level a bunch of different ones currently so I'm just playing the one. I play PS4 and PC so it's a lot to manage.
---
Maximumgnarsh add me if you like.
---
I’ll continue playing without being banned.  I hate dupers and people who justify duping and cheating. 
---
You don't have to fast travel to repair weapons, just find a workbench anywhere. They are plentiful. 
---
Absolutely gorgeous! 
---
Hey, just a friendly tip(unless the patch has fixed it) whenever people build stuff in your C.A.M.P. that you don’t have the plans for, it won’t place if you ever move.
---
Yeah I with ya on that. And worse thing is how long to we get it fixed 
---
same
---
Inside is the same in all of them.
---
Charlie is annoying because you have to fight the zombies in the warehouse to get to the elevator.
---
wait I did have 350% over from the camp system being screwy, I had to scrap everything
---
Mutant slayers +10% damage while aiming and faster reload, not the best, but its a gem nonetheless.
---
Yeah.... I just. Had a cat on my lap prohibiting me from seeing my pbone. 
---
Urban Operative Underarmor also removes the Nuka-Girl outfit. It may be because of the glove slot.
---
Yeah it’s stupid but if you don’t have a TSE weapon or a very good melee weapon you’re outgunned by almost everyone, it’s ridiculous but until they add (if they add) more effects for weapons that’s all that will be used for queen fights. 
---
Alright well if it messes up the budget then I don’t want to do it. I figured they would have fixed that the last patch. I haven’t had the option to tame anything come up although I haven’t tried much. I’m just wondering if it even gives you the option if my camp doesn’t have enough space.

---
Which platform are you on mate?
---
I'm PS4, and I did literally the same thing as you described, all the way to lvl48, then decided I liked being a heavy gunner with a sledgehammer 2nd.
---
Now I need to figure out my perk point movements and budget for the next card. But I love it, it makes it interesting to keep checking what I'm actually capable of each 2-3 level ups.
---
I've had a full day pass and it still show empty, sadly this may be a trend they're not familiar with. 
---
I believe you lol 
---
So many tears 
---
Technically true, practically - never happened to me. But I live in a perfect world with completely stable internet on my side, which is rare.
---
I've done it on 3 of my own characters and accompanied others doing it twice - I still find it hilarious :)
---
Take the secret elevator entrance out of abandoned waste dump.  It’ll exit you at a cliff.  3 strangler blooms as soon as you exit, stay easy and south and you will find tons more.
---
Was the guy that slapped you at Harpers Ferry in excavator PA? If so that might have been me, sorry :P
---
I also play on PC.
---
It wasn't "in the game" if you have to crash servers or cause disconnects to do it or otherwise abuse glitches and nobody is going to feel sorry for these bans.
---
Getting banned for exploits isn't new and isn't a surprise to anyone who has played an online game in the last 5 years.
---
Sorry all your buddies were dumb, and couldn't play the game without cheating, maybe get new buddies.
---
god I'm stupid
---
No right to pass judgement on people with tse? Yeah right. Half the people I run into are carrying one if not multiple of these things. Some people find them obviously, the overwhelming majority are definitely dupes. I have over 400 levels (320-82) and have never found a single one, and I assure you I hunt legendaries down non stop. I dont know if its the whole “loot seed” theory thats screwing me or what, but regardless of my bad luck, I refuse to believe that all these people running around with tse are getting them legit. Look at the fo76 bazaar/marketplace, you telling me all that stuff isnt duped?
---
I would like to thank you for this info, may explain a few problems I have had with crafting using super duper while making diluted stim packs. Likely I exceeded the limit as the super duper seems to lag behind the actual creation of the item it doubled.
---
I literally cannot find this. Could you include a picture on the location?
---
And where are you? The forest is a safe place for everyone, albeit a little sparse on mobs.
---
sad i would consider the  weight issue fixed it's perfect to where you can save most of what your want and not keep all the garbage you don't need if your still having problems make a alt and trsade everything to a friend to dump off on the alt besides the fact i like to run multi toons at a time it works if you work it
---
They're fun instruments of mayhem .. call em to complete a quest gain some xp but after that?? call em to watch newbies get wanted and laugh at the ensuing drama. The loot on them is terrible we all know this, but beth, but to call one and watch the area you called it start drama .. priceless. I highly recommend calling them closest to flatwoods as possible, it's hilarious to watch.
---
yep I have the same problem on pc...
---
67% Upvoted ! what a shit  subreddit.. complete garbage.. so full of shit posts licking bethesda ass..memes.. or even more shit posts about hating the ppl who hate the game (the irony) 
---
Like I said..Your opinion. I know the truth and I will speak my opinion. Never dupped and thats the truth. I have already appealed to get mine lifted so Ill keep yall posted
---
Level 27. I'll be in the middle of a quest and another high level player will run by the area, then suddenly I'm left to deal with a pack of ghouls leveled 40-60. I expect some challenge and creatures to be more powerful than me and tough to handle at times, but it's getting ridiculous. 
---
Is that marine like whales or marine like fighting force formerly transported by the navy? I'm gonna split the difference and call you aqua boy.
---
Hang out there?  No. I just pop in from time to time like I own the place, grab a few goodies, then pop out. 
---
In the safe from the nuka cola plant their is a letter from Clara to Alexis

Xbox
---
Hang out in them? No. Take them as I pass by? Ya. But I'm more of the player that doesn't lock anything in-game so everyone can benefit from my resources/camp. 
---
Do you have a ts one? I got myself a tse and it breaks (from 200%) twice during one core! Freaking ridiculous, it can't even do enough damage to justify its usage over a tse minigun...
---
Huh? Lol. 
---
It’s nice that they’re identical inside. Makes silo runs easier. 
---
It may.  I normally just pick the lock.
---
*Brown paper bags want to know your location*

Actually search on the nexus for "Boston Framerate", one of the most popular Mods makes it SO much smoother. It doesnt even remove any clutter items or anything, I'm not smart with how it works and what it does lol but it does its job well.
---
AHA!  That was it, piling everything in stash box cleared it up..  Thx good sir or madam.
---
Rare gear is supposed to be rare. Duping it breaks the economy, it doesn't create one. 
---
Duping did nothing to improve the game for anyone but the dupers and other impatient, entitled brats who don't understand how to be good at a game unless they have all the best and rarest stuff immediately.
---
It's ok though, they can always go buy another copy of the game and not be idiots this time.
---
You mean the fire station? I don’t think i’d be able to build there...
---
Guess i'm just having too much fun. The owner comes in and has been running around looking for me. Keeps passing me. Somehow chameleon is working

Look for comment #257 
---
Explains on how people got access into the dev cell. It's blatant cheating, you can only access it with third party software such as cheat engine and similar working software that has not been flagged by Bethesdas anti cheat. 
---
I don’t understand. Is opening one you didn’t call a PVP action now?  
---
I prefer to think of myself as a rad worm host, and consider that state my normal condition.  That way, when I find myself free of worms, I consider it a fortunate buff and am happily surprised.
---
yeah the weight of bobby pins originally and gunpowder in my inventory under misc threw me off, never claimed phantom weight but had me using a calculator to add up what I could see had weight.
---
Queue the music! "Another one bites the dust!"
---
I found a sledgehammer with 30%+ damage to ghouls and it helped me get from level 30-47 pretty quick. Also having some mutations really helps. Marsupial was a gam changer for me.  I used to just sneak everywhere and do lots of ranged attacks. 
---
Much as I love this game I highly doubt I’ll be playing it in 10 years and if it cost them money I wouldn’t fault them for canceling it.
---
Different people in the company probably have access to different tools. Your base-level support guy maybe doesn't have access to that tool (or maybe even simply wasn't trained in on it), but someone higher up or in the actual development team (who is usually **not** doing customer support in a company this large) will.
---
On the other hand, the game may not hold onto deleted characters very long. If the data no longer exists at all, then you need to call Doc Brown, not Todd Howard.
---
So i have experience being killed through slap damage on 2 different days. One time someone came up to my friend and i at a station and killed us and kept killing us over and over and kept taking our caps from it. We were both i pacifist mode. On a different day, different friend and i were on and saw a 2k bounty on someone’s head with 3 others around we decided to try and collect. When we showed up we were both killed while loading. Lost caps. Ok. Reload somewhere farther. Friend is killed before he can fire off a shot. When i come around i try to hit one of his friends see i forgot to take pacifist off so while i was changing it was shot and killed. Ok. Third time i loaded in and the other 3 that were with the guy were trying to kill me. All dealing slap damage i was able to tank those 3 all on me but the moment he other guy walks up and blasts me off again. Now from reading the post above it’s likely that it’s the bobble head exploit he was using. Afterwords my friend and i tested his explosive shotgun on me to test damage. Friend hits me with every pellet and I’m only dealt 5 damage. If i remember right his explosive shotgun was around 500 damage or so. I have no videos because I’m on PS4. :/
---
I think right outside vault 76, the overseers chest by the overseers camp, and the luggage outside all the train stations. Don’t be afraid of higher level players, 9/10 times they’re really nice and will even help you if you ask. FO76 has one of the most supportive communities I’ve seen
---
Xbox, I had sniper/shotgun/one hand melee build and well had so many issues around level 60 before the respec, missed so many good cards in the next 30 levels trying to squeeze in what I could, missed starched genes till level 87 lost pvp fights to people half my level who had a solid build but now with a solid non auto rifle build and now working on building up shot gun damage, my nocturnal explosive handmade and my anti armour shotgun deal a sweet amount of death
---
No worries, I find him relatively easy.  I'll be back on tomorrow, I'll give you another chance. 😁
---
Innocent players sometimes do get caught up when algorithms are used. They then follow the instructions a in the email Bethesda sent and get unbanned. Bethesda then uses that information to tweak their detection algorithms and detect less innocent players.
---
This is how it works, and while seeing innocent players banned for a bit sucks, even they will appreciate the end result.
---
Innocent players don't stay banned,that's the difference. Bethesda needed this ban-wave to teach players like your buddies and you that no, this isn't Lowe's and there are consequences.
---
My husband kept not being able to see my character even when I was standing right in front of him. I am experiencing the inability to pick things up sometimes, it seems totally random. And I swear load screens last longer now with no further improvement...
---
Same with me, except I robbed some duper’s at Charleston station, just got a new account so whatever. I’m sure that’s exactly what they wanted anyway.

Dead Man Sprinting

I reply back when and if I do find em! Thanks for real though!

From your title I thought you were going to show us a PVP troll acting like a child to "prove his manhood."
---
But no. Actually the 40 Year Old Virgin.
---
I started thinking about what i could scrap in my house for junk
---
Seems more like Brotherhood tactics as a poster above suggested.  Being dicks to others in pursuit of their vision of the greater good.
---
Two Shot Explosive, a weapon with those 2 legendary effects. I've had to decipher a few of these shortened descriptions through trial and error myself, people just assume others have the same level of knowledge as they do, a common and studied human trait.
---
No one justified anything, I hate cheaters and duping as well but they are now banning players who never duped plain and simple. I never duped a single thing period and I still get banned? Regardless of what I got with hard earned caps in player trades it's BS. Take someones workshop and make them mad enough to report you and bam your banned. No evidence needed apparently as there is no evidence of me duping I know that for a fact.
---
I rage quit twice. This was the most infuriating quest ever haha
---
Honestly though, hate the DMV? Move to Oregon. I'm in and out in 10 minutes every time. 
---
But if I’m being honest most important is the dense chest mod cause I don’t like getting blown up by cars haha
---
I also believe this might be going on. I didn't know about until I was killed while building in a workshop. A player walked up and started to claim the workshop from me, then one-shot me before I could react. He took the few pieces of junk I had and left the server. It happened really fast, but him claiming the workshop allowed him to bypass slap damage. Ultimately it was no big deal, but I learned a lesson! 
---
Ah yes, anecdotal evidence from a level 40. Sounds legit. 
---
Sandhill whooping cranes? Are you a Floridian by chance? There were 2 brazenly hanging out in the middle of the road on my way home this morning.
---
Also, beautiful journal!
---
I love the smell of nuked Radstag in the morning.
---
It just comes off as nitpicky. It's asking for quality of life change number 286 when we're currently at number 20. 
---
You're wasting your time/joke's on you. Pretty much anyone with any kind of extractor will be overloaded in a matter of days. Fusion cores are extremely common and don't need to be farmed. Same with my water. I leave my purifiers unlocked so anyone that comes by can grab some water. I have plenty.
---
If I remember rightly the paranoid hording of technology did not start with maxson. It started after he died.
---
Brotherhood of steel stuff always looked like reclaimed military gear with their symbol painted on to me, even in 3/nv/4. which would make sense if they are using a satellite to pull a base of survivors in. if I am not mistaken the military survivors were from of a couple of groups sent to WV for trainning. I also wouldnt be surprised if the satellite could send images as well as voice.
---
As for pulling outsiders in doesnt one of the recordings have them actually arguing about that because maxson doesnt want nukes to be used so pulling in as many survivors to help fight back the scorched  because they "Are doing it FOR them"?
---
Hahahahahahhaha 
---
Well they do make mistakes and there are some that have been banned that has done nothing against the TOS..Hence I have not duped yet I got a ban
---
And the awesome little robco desk statuettes. I've seen protectrons, eyebots and Mr gutsys so far. Would be cool to have then set up on the table at the camp. 
---
Not that I’m aware of and I just picked up a random air drop 5 minutes ago.
---
Does the chainsaw count as 1 handed? 2 handed? Is it even melee?
---
Does it stack damage with a perk card setup? Hmmm....
---
Emergancy Proticals, although it's power armor.
---
Beast mode engaged 
---
I have literally thrown away so many legendaries because the traders have zero caps left and I REALLY don't need another Instigating 90%weight reduction increased swing Death Tambo. Or even another lead pipe that does bleed damage. 
---
It's the same bug that causes you to scrap your mods in your stash when you have like 2000 steel on you... It doen't recognize the resources in your inventory...
---
Combat Shotgun or RIOT shotgun?
---
How you doing? Guess what? They were tracking dupers and the ban waves have begun. 
---
This isn't surprising to a to anyone who understands that logging can be adjusted and new database queries can be written at any time and doesn't have to be "implemented beforehand".
---
They'll catch a few innocent players and unban them then use that info to tweak their algorithms, and catch less innocents in the next wave. This is how it works and it isn't anything new.
---
Hopefully this is a learning experience for you since your understanding ding of how this a works was quite wrong.
---
There was a post here a bit ago saying a lot of these don’t stack. 
---
Saw a possum on the way to campus, thought BACON!

---
??  Shift 1-8 selects the load out I believe.  Not at home so im not sure about the exact key but yeah, I dont have to do ANY of that with the mod enabled.
---
NOt sure what you mean about no balance loss. If you dont equip those then you get extra perks instead.  Thats a balance loss.  
---
NOT DISAGREEING with you.  I think its stupid and should be baked in but its a pretty easy fix.
---
When I played FO4 it was duct tape. 
---
A few weeks ago I saw a rough looking clipboard on the wall at work and thought “oh shit!  Springs”. 
---
My friend got kicked out twice from a PSN chat (we were in a different game) so maybe related?
---
Does the place remove clutter if you place stuff on it?
---
You should ask for an explanation if indeed you were banned for duping.  
---
I’ve had loads of disconnects today, literally play 30sec-10 minutes and I’m out, however it may be a isp issue since both my phone and Xbox are having issues, but odd part is my pc isn’t losing connection 
---
I love lamp
---
Even with weapon artisan the energy weapons are unusable, they break so fast it's unreal that got passed testing.
---
You don't have to place the welcome mat. 
---
PvP is broken any way. If I engage someone I deal slap damage. But the first shot they get is full damage. In the land of one shot PvP, the person with a friend is king.
---
So, a Horadric Cube...
---
well it sucks, why would jeapordize 2 accounts 1 for xbox 1 for pc, additionally my fallout 4 account thankfully I never bought anything off that store
---
I think its better to just nuke the shed area and Drop Site V9 (disabling fast travel) - just leave Forward Station Delta out of the blast zone.  Some shelter, only spot to fast travel unless you want a long hike to the fight, and everyone fights if you do it from Delta, either that or you die cause the trash mobs will still get to you.
---
It may be helpful to note that some of the mods in the armor pieces are in the same mod slot. Example ultra light build and deep pocket cant be applied together since they are in the same mod slot. Etc etc 
---
Just ran into this today, some guy and I crossed paths, we both dropped the pvp emote and then engaged, I got 3 good shots in on him before he one hit me with a combat knife...he was 3 lvls below me 
---
Absolutely will be swapping cannibal in to do this. Thanks, Rose!
---
It was only a joke lol
---
See how well that works?  Genius.
---
nope
---
Oh sweet they fixed the weapon bench skin?! I haven’t tried it yet. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
Sulphur fountain at the gazebo and rad shower right inside the bunker near the service entrance are required stops!
---
Once you crest at around 40 - you wont notice it anymore.  
---
I doubt everyone complaining about phantom weight was just being noobish or lying. Im over 400 hours in, im well aware of all the different places weight can be in your inventory aka not a noob.
---
After this recent patch I logged on with over 20 pounds of weight I did not have the night before. I checked every tab trying to figure out wtf was wrong, couldnt find anything so I logged out/in. I did NOT drop anything at any point. When I logged back in the extra weight was gone but so was one of my weapons that I had just seen less than 5 minutes before while inspecting my inventory. I was super salty because it was my best gun. Now my inventory was close to 40 pounds less than it had been with the phantom weight, 20 phantom and 20 on the gun.
---
Are you saying im making this up? What possible reason would I have for doing so?
---
It's the weight-bonus that is mostly attractive to me, but recently i've started to find three-stars armor that reduce weapon weight and so on. Getting a bit tired of feeling so clumsy with PA
---
I am tempted to collect all the wood armour I have discarded and make a super wood suit. I suspect it is actually a hidden attribute super suit.  Otherwise why does the toughest enemy in the game drop it? 
---
"To uninstall the game, you will need to manually remove the download file by going to C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher\games and deleting the Fallout76 folder (with all its contents)."

---
Any armor that isn't PA
---
Same here on Xbox, on top seems like my isp is also an issue Xbox and phone have issues but pc is fine, but yea disconnects for 30sec-10 mins
---
Seems like you just read the first part, and came straight to Reddit lol, but I also understand that you don't want to go through all that trouble just to uninstall the game, which is frustrating indeed.
---
I can’t get past department c. The game freezes every time.  
---
Thank you for answering this. What do I need to build to generate cores??
---
Maybe able to help in a few hours.
---
I can craft 20 of them, and you can scrap 19 and learn some new mods?
---
No spare plans unfortunately, sorry.

Lazy is not bothering to fix the issues that have persisted in that code and asset base from the days of Morrowind, especially when they have community fixes to look at and see how to fix the problems.

---
I had a vengeful one get stuck in my home. He proceeded to then kill me. I guess he didn’t take a liking to me having my camp in the area 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Yea dude, the other day I just finished remodeling my camp with my buddy who is level ten at an aluminum extractor, some dickhead level 207 comes and demolished everything I spent 4 hours building. He killed me and kept doing so with his friend because they thought I was duping, I literally had 114 springs 123 screws, and 141 gears, because I had just got back from a resource run I commonly do. They messaged me calling me a "cunt" and saying that I "plague the community." People take this way to far. I'm afraid to play with my friends anymore because I just feel as though this is going to happen again. The people like that who try to rebuild the community, are actually damaging it further.
---
I just get tired of people saying..."Thats what they all say". Just because you say you didnt dupe doesnt mean you are lying. People alway love to see the worse in everyone. I have sent my appeal to Bethesda to get this lifted as I have done nothing wrong
---
😃
---
I don't even have defenses at my camp and all doors are unlocked. Go grab you some dirty water from the nearby pond, pick you some corn and make some soup. There's plenty, trust me. 
---
So no storage capacity increase? Guess i'm waiting another two months to start playing again.
---
I rocked a hasty 50 cal receiver for awhile. It's s good general purpose item and 50 cal is really cheap to make and keep on hand. It's a good tradeoff
---
While I agree not to believe everything you read. The problem is I didnt nor would I quit because of any of the expoits you mentioned, even if ALL of them were true. I quit because of the bugs that made the game near unplayable for me. Game crashes in nuke silos. undeletable camp objects preventing further building. I spent a week crashing every 15 minutes.  I actually endured playing a 4 hour sessions once crashing every 15 minutes. That is how much I enjoy the gameplay.    It just never ended. I am hoping to come here one day and the posts not be constant "this is broke, fix it" and then get back into the game.
---
You are doing the lord's work &lt;3
---
Mine started doing that about an hour ago too - seems to have cleared up now though
---
Just because it's a MMORPG doesn't mean free exp...just because wow is braindead now doesn't mean that's the industry standard
---
Yeah, I Would agree it's the tattered mole outfit. I found one in some camping cabins in the mire.
---
I am  level 136 with an ax and that is what I do. Fills in the time between landing and makes me feel useful while the ranged guys keep shooting her.
---
Not gonna lie I’ve seen some suspicious players ... and it does make the servers shitty and hard to enjoy the game I pay for 
---
That's a better idea.
---
I got one a few weeks ago and my luck stat is only 4
---
Still have him?
---
I am in the process now, that's why I discovered this thread! I legit thought I was hacked since the email was in my junk spam folder. I reset all my PW's and was looking at my bank account to make sure that was secure when I seen someone here mention the spam folder... totally insane! 
---
When I show up at people's camps, it's generally to give them stuff for free. 
---
There's so much loot to be had, why would I want to take it from another player?  
---
Wallpapers and paint. 
---
Yeah i was maxed out before the first increase, then after about 2 days of playing maxed out again. 
---
I've gotten rid of everything I can and i'm still like 400lbs over. Can't move at all can't play at all. Haven't played the game since and won't play again until it's increased enough that I can fucking run for once lol. 
---
Yeah honestly many fans have great ideas. I just wish bethesda would pick up the pace. Im glad they are trying and i do enjoy the game, but they are moving slow. 
---
Nah he died from staying around too long.  Going to try and grab another.
---
And whole weapon/ammo system from New Vegas
---
No reason you couldnt have recorded it. You can record video on PS4 with the share button. Next time it happens hit that record button for proof and load that sucker onto YouTube. 
---
Yep, get this with Vendors too. Try to interact, nothing happens so you walk away and 10-20 seconds later it opens up. When it happens on a workshop though it's soo much more annoying. It starts the animation to get in it, then you get no menu, so you leave it then get the menu.
---
I have gotten 2 in fallout 76 and 1 on fallout 4
---
"Woopsies", as the kids would call it, occurs when a man and a woman love each other very much but fail to use protection.
---
We shouldn't have to just get rid of all the useful things we've accumulated. The stash should be like 2000 eventually to be honest. 
---
I refuse to get rid of things I know i'm going to need and so I can't play the game until there is a signigicant increase in stash or carry weight. 
---
Personally I'd grab marathoner as well just so you can run that much longer, but as for speed there's not much I can think of. 
---
I was expecting the same thing. 
---
"I can feel the gears of beaocracy grinding me up already" - the sole survivor 
---
I wouldn't doubt it. I understand criticism and frustration, but with some of the games I've played in the past few years, I have seen people who dedicated their entire lives to shitting on a game. CoD WW2 had some of the most ridiculous trolls...there was this one guy who spent months upon months ranting about everybody being a noob because they weren't using one of the bolt action rifles
---
Thats more like uh oh or oh no lol
---
There’s definitely reasons why i couldn’t... like storage space lol. 
---
/r/fallout76settlements
---
Tons of flux. Not worth it. Just get it from power armor or world generators
---
Ah thats super lame. I kind of had a nice looking place way before they fixed your place getting BP when someone was in your spot. Had an open patio place that looked classy with a decent looking loft up top. I had a roof on mine but i couldn't build higher. Would be nice if the build ceiling was the SB ceiling. 
---
Man you should upgrade to 2-4 TB hardrives. Pretty cheap on Amazon right now 
---
Always happy to help another vault dweller fight through Bethes-Bug. 😁
---
Literally all I need and want right now. Can't play the game at all until this is addressed again.
---
Uh huh you are still here, asking for evidence yet if you actually took your head out of your ass for a second and browsed the sub you would see that nobody likes heavy weapons. But ya know, keep being delusional 
---
As a melee I run, marsupial, grounded, scaly skin, speed demon carnivore, and grounded. I don’t use class freak unless I am crafting . I don’t notice any negatives.

no kidding..

Awesome! I really like the ones with the night sky &amp; milky way.
---
Got 2 my first week playing but never again(100+ hours later). You can get a perfectly preserved pie on the roof of watoga highschool. 
---
I believe you are confused sir. An "uh-oh" is when one uses a chunk of refined plutonium to gently light the bedroom only to see the results of their error 9 months later.
---
The method I mentioned was posted to youtube weeks ago. As for server stability, like I said in the post, there are massive outliers all around. The workshop issue caused problems on PC for a few days, but as of now the experience should be smoother for everybody
---
Have a flamer and love it but never get to use it because I never have any fuel for it :(
---
sounds like somebody's parents forgot to have "the talk".
---
I found plans for the lever gun in Lewisburg after looking for a few days. I got my current 2* vampiric lever after solo killing a SB just outside Harpers Ferry and have fully modded it out, my favorite weapon
---
That actually sounds like the actual reason for no NPCs.
---
Hehe. I love how part of your raiding is getting people to kill themselves with TSE
---
Whst does plutonium have to do with anything lol.  Then whats an oh no?
---
It’s the only disease I need for the challenge! 
---
Or just visit flatwoods, so much food...
---
West Virginian here - I actually didn't think anybody outside of WV even knew about the Flatwoods monster, thought it was something very local and obscure.
---
Of course the Mothman is pretty famous, but i just thought the other WV cryptid was just something people around here knew about.
---
Sounds like me !!!
---
But it ain’t me 👍🏽
---
Only "evidence" was a single ban notice that was apparently photoshopped from an ESO ban notice.
---
Same as heavy leather right arm vaul-tec paint. They have some cosmetic shit not working lol.
---
I had the same thing happen in white springs, but a low level punching me while selling gear, I finish up, step back two rounds of anti armour  shotgun in the head and thanks for the caps
---
I’ll check it out thanks!
---
For some reason I can’t get the field medic started 
---
uhm i think metal is strongest to balistic (physical) but energy melts you
---
The thing is what sucks and what doesn't in Borderlands is up to the player. I remember I found an infinite ammo pistol in Borderlands (original) that I used way past the level I was meant to but it came in handy fighting the Vault beast.
---
In FO76 I've never really found a useful gun. I keep finding junk or a better gun. About the most useful one I have is single star Anti Armour .50. So maybe my comment about not finding a useful gun isn't quite true but an infinite pistol ve a 20% of my carry weight heavy that uses a ton of ammo.... But when I find a better gun it is *better* not complimentary to my other weapons. Even before I bought a TSE I only carried my single shot explosive Gattling and before that my +30% animal Gattling. I haven't carried more than 1 weapon since like... Level 35? 40 at the latest. 
---
I'm in the same boat and I'm doing the same! Never duped a single thing and made a point to drop bulk items stolen off killed dupers and weight glitchers as it was inconvenient as hell! Total BS 
---
The post you mentioned got deleted, and I'm not really sure what exactly it's getting at. It sounds sort of like what I already said about the UI being clunky and causing accidents, but I could be misunderstanding
---
As for that dupe, is it one of the two that I mentioned as potentially still existing, or something else?
---
Enemies come to attack music locations in a lot of areas. There's even a Beowulf quest based on it. 
---
Well, running to a vendor in the Enclave bunker involves 2 loading screens (teleport to, and entering), a vault door opening sequence,  a mini load screen (if you take the elevator) and a lot of running around (distance to the X01 vendor mod)
---
A stash box would be nice.
---
I have spent the last two saturdays server hopping for hours....nada. 
---
Congratulations you lucky bastard! 
---
Nope it’s not sorry bro! :( feel free to add me if your on PS4 though! Level 56 here, up for anything. PSN: Liversss
---
They definitely can still attack if the person is on your team but it just doesn't do any damage. The behavior is depended on what creature it is. Deathclaws and Mega Sloths names are generally red and will appear hostile, radtoads and even snallygasters appear white and are totally passive.
---
I don't think I ever denied either of those claims?

I've seen that one but didn't think watoga would have that happen to me.

I put a small generator on the roof and connect conduits on all corners of the roof and I have power for the entire exterior of the house - for lights and neon letters.

Lol I’m married and own my own business.  And I can bet I’m more fit than you. 
---
Agreed.
---
I wanted to be a laser toting BOS in PA but the damage sucks.
---
It's outclassed by everything else.
---
I had no issues with them

The post got deleted? I don't think it did.
---
Anyway, you can _temporarily_ "lose" things while trading. It's easy to recreate. Start a trade, offer someone something (stimpaks or other aid items are easy to track), exit the menu without trading. One stimpak will be missing for about 30 seconds.
---
Youtubers been posting them and some got banned on all their accounts 
---
You can get all three from Grafton station, but they're not very common.

I think picking the lock on one might get you wanted, but looting it once the owner has unlocked it will not.

Thanks anyways, good luck 
---
Dude sorry just need 10 more mins
---
I have two friends ... Bethesda account banned at some point in the last 24 hours ... One was a duper and one had duped items given to him (lots of them) 
---
r/wooosh 
---
While I've never witnessed an "oh no" myself I've heard tale that it involves a mannequin, two eight balls, a rather promiscuous protectron, and an exorbitant amount of jet.
---
Pacify and tame are two different things. Pacifying a deathclaw only last a couple of minutes. Taming a deathclaw means it will live in your camp and will be totally harmless to you.
---
Based on the patch notes they said:
---
Fusion Cores: Fixed an issue where Fusion Core generators were producing cores at a slower rate than intended. They are now back to 8 cores/hr.
---
Does this mean they increased, and decreased how fusion cores appear? Or are they talking about something you can build at your base?
---
If you have a broken/overpowered offense and can 1-shot anything, then why would you need defense? Try using a non-legendary weapon (or at least not TS or explosive) and tactics instead, like having to cripple limbs first, or using a syringer to begin the combat, and see both:
---
(1) how much more interesting the game is
---
(2) how much you actually need good defense
---
All the people running around with min/max builds and OP duped TSE weapons one-shotting everything are missing some of the best parts of the game.
---
Also check the vendor in grafton
---
Did the quest and then got my driver's license a week later, both were very interesting experiences at the dmv
---
Any more descriptions on how to find it? Idk if I'm just that blind but I cant find the building
---
After the patch yesterday I had my first blue screen in several weeks after a couple is server not responding. I'll update after this arvo play time
---
Somebody probably dropped it in area and it picked it up. I’ve transferred items solo and had scorched pick up my stuff before.
---
Awe man ight I'm on Xbox 1 if you ever get one add me Jacob Rules 15 I'm lvl 100 now and one shooting everything 
---
Great work! I love seeing research on critical builds. It's really useful to hear you could do 4 pieces of Unyielding to get 100% crit chance. 
---
When you post the full guide, can you mention what your SPECIALS are after the armor boost? Second if you use any food to boost luck (ie scorchbeast liver)? I read the magic Lucky number is 32(or 34?) points of Luck.
---
It's been a standard for the past few fallout titles.  As to why, I assume it's a balance issue.
---
Agreed as written above. You cant jave a pet frog but you can have a pet RadToad.
---
Welp I’m surrounded by ghouls wailing away on me.
---
It sure is tiring I think I’ll just sit down now.
---
Fine fine I’ll stand back up, I want to lie down on that sleeping back anyway
---
In the same boat, apparently I had duped items? This just seems severe as hell. 
---
There’s been several posts already 
---
Then suddenly all those true and 'hip-shot accuracy' boosting perks and items would actually be of real benefit.
---
Wow. Sounds fun
---
The thing is from what Ive seen is even if you havent duped..If you have duped items your account gets suspended. So if anyone was to trade you a duped item..suspended. Someone would drop and you pick it up suspended. Can be one item but still suspended. People sell it to a bot..you go buy it..still duped so again suspended. Innocent people are gettimg trapped in this. They need a better system. You can do all of this in a single play fallout but once Online, everyone made a huge deal for playing a FALLOUT game. 
---
Bethesda..We need support, answers and responses. 
---
No, but there is a legendary effect 
---
Doesn’t WV export a lot of sarcasm too?
---
This isn’t true at all. I was transferring a two shot cryolator and I went to the container it was stowed in and it wasn’t there, turned around and saw a scorched with it right before he fucking blasted me with it.
---
I wouldn't know because... I wasn't invited. :'(
---
I don't get it.
---
God at least i finished it...for now
---
Supposedly Hunters is good for SB(Q)?
---
This would be applicable if the company in FO4 weren't named Mass _Fusion_ and didn't have their own local, fusion-based power plants.
---
Dude. You seriously suck at reading. "When I Was level 40" I'm well over 100 now. I know how PvP works. He was not in PvP with me, and I'd have known if he was because a GIANT FUCKING PLACARD pops up when you are, and we still weren't in combat even after I shot him. That's how I gave him stimpacks afterwards. 
---
Like, I don't give a shit if you don't believe me, but pretending like I don't understand the game because you don't believe me is just fucking stupid. 
---
On Xbox there hasn't been any bans for normal duping...at least from what I have seen.  However not sure about people who have been reported with evidence.
---
I have used Xbox lfg a lot and the big players on there all have their accounts active on fallout 76.  All Bethesda needs to do is look there and see how many people are selling TSE and bobbleheads on mass.   But I guess they don't have the resources to do this.  Even so time would be better spent writing a script to look for evidence of duping.
---
OP is a sack of spuds though.  There is no evidence of bans.  No word from Bethesda, and to be honest I don't think they can afford the PR.  The dev room seems to be a different matter but even then weren't accounts just frozen?
---
I heard they had removed dev items not meant to be alive in game from a post here.    Yet again there is no evidence of this.  I know this was on the PC but I saw someone yesterday wearing a mask from the dev room  on Xbox.  
---
Manually installing something by deleting the folder? That's bush league. This is supposed to be a AAA game!

---
This leaves you with six points to spare. I suggest at least 3 in Perception for Glow Sights since it's just good. The other 3 points I don't think are poorly spent on Pistol perks even if you only sometimes use them, and since you have enough damage already (assuming you're using an explosive pistol), one in Modern Renegade and two in Gun Runner are nice.
---
A few quick notes:
---
Starched Genes and Sun Kissed are due to wanting an array of mutations, especially Marsupial and Eagle Eye. Once you have these, you don't want to risk getting something actively bad for you. Speed Demon is nice to have too, but is a distant third on that list.
---
Lone Wanderer is obviously only good if you play alone. For groups, 3 in Inspirational and 1 in Strange in Numbers to pair with the mandatory 1 point in Tenderize is good.
---
The 10 Int might seem a bit much, especially if you aren't using  explosive weapons, but it lets you have the freedom to equip all your crafting perks at once while at camp. Speaking of that, don't forget Ammosmith in Agility and Super Duper in Luck for better crafting results.
---
Lastly, if you are rifles, 3 points in Tank Killer is probably better than flat damage. You are already going to crush low armor stuff anyway, so the pen+cripple chance is nice.
---
If you got a better VATS targeting weapon you could get away with leaving Perception low, but I don't really like it.
---
Have a question, ask away!
---
Oh im sorry, but u seem very knowledgeable about these things 
---
I wish I had art skills so I could illustrate a paladin in full t-60 deskfan/clipboard armor. 
---
A Neverwinter Nights server I play has a PvP system like that, and that game is like 17 years old.
---
Looks like he just turned to the 50 year old virgin, 
---
It says you have to go find the fucking files yourself and manually delete it. WTF is that? They can't even build an uninstaller for their software? What if all programs you put on your computer you have to go find all the files yourself?
---
Yup this would love it, sadly Bethesda is sour  with Obsidian because they made a better game in less time on their own Frankensteined engine. Thus Bethesda pushed the release date up of NV to sabotage Obsidian so they would not have to pay them.
---
Thats where I found the legs, but everytime I check back thats all he has
---
File  a appeal if you think your innocent 
---
Or they can fix it now and here by removing the damage stacking bobble heads from the game, and reintroduce it later with a "fixed" version.
---
But noooooooooooooooooooooo, Bethesda would rather let us suffer and enjoy dupers who buy secondary accounts to dupe and mule. It's all about the $$$$$
---
I quit farming legendaries..... I've been hoping vendors looking for mods for my legendary radium rifle for the last week.
---
Found a 3* TSE tri barrel mini gun with 15% reload for 561 caps at the Morgantown Station vendor. I'm sure it was probably a duper who sold it to him but it's the best drop I've gotten so I ponied up the caps. Apparently this vendor didn't check to see what these things are going for online.
---
I try to be, but you spill the guacamole one time and suddenly you're on the Society's black list.

I don't even like guacamole!
---
Got one at that AVR Medical building or whatever. 
---
People have been getting banned for duping today, I have personally seen it and seen the messages from Bethesda they're legit
---
That was today three separate people
---
I already mentioned at multiple parts in the post that I was wrong in the past, including with this. The entire point of the post is about improvement and verifying facts. I am not immune to being misled by what I see here. Nevertheless, I only said on that specific topic that I found it extremely unlikely for bethesda to do any banning based on their previous actions. I literally said at the end, "It might happen, but it doesn't seem like what bethesda would do at this point".
---
Also, what track record are you referencing, exactly? Aside from the issues regarding this and duping that I already mentioned in the post and admitted to being wrong about? If you care this much, feel free to go through my post history and count up everything I say that is confirmed wrong where I insisted it was true, then compare it to everything I was unsure about or was right about
---
I found this thread via google and thought I'd share my experience for anyone who's trying for these...
---
It sucks, so you're going to need to be patient.
---
I spent about 20 hours on this before finally getting 2 mods.  I never saw the plan.  
---
I tried various locations and techniques.  I spent time in Harper's Ferry and Watoga.    
---
I spent maybe 10 hours checking Camden amusement park + Welch railroad station + Red Rocket in the Ash Heap.  
---
In the end, I put my camp as close to the Welch railroad station as I could and planted down a water purifier, since I was burning through all my supplies.  I think I exhausted 10 power cores because I never thought to take off my power armor (I don't have any other armor these days).  On a more positive note, I did acquire 13 nuclear site key pairs, because rarely those captain ghouls would be around.  
---
Anyway, it seems to show up in the Welch railroad station as a mod.  I saw zero Excavator mod plans there.  
---
The Red Rocket in the Ash Heap does have some Excavator plans, but I never found the Calibrated Shocks and the plans weren't there very often.  
---
I really have been loving the game.  I do hope that there will be an upcoming patch that will address these sorts of things.  
---
It seems like there would be no negative in making plans more readily available at the vendors.  
---
It's just not fun to constantly hop servers.  I'd much rather play the game and explore.
---
Ok so in the game world perhaps they’re pulling uranium out of WV soil. The point is it’s not far fetched to have WV involved in the power generation in another state. 
---
It only occurs when u entered workshop mode b4 using crafting stations. Idk how did beth made a bug that never was in fo4
---
Easy add lvl 75 gear, this is like mmo 101 
---
I dont think anyone likes guacamole
---
Do you want to uninstall it or do you just want to have a temper tantrum? Just follow the instructions and go away.
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
My theory is some people legitimately can't handle the fact that people like things they don't. 
---
God forbid you going through like 3 folders and clicking 5 times... if you can't follow these simple directions then you're just lazy or a dumbass. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If you can't damage a camp then you can't get out if a player builds a trap around you. That's why you can damage camps.
---
Of course, it's stupid, since then you're marked wanted and truly fucked.
---
On the bright side, your useless comment wasted little of my time. 
---
You can just go in through the service entrance and skip all of that. The service entrance puts you straight in Production.
---
Sadly, the account name is going to do anything for me. Were you in a team? I play solo, but I've seen some people complain that having a teammate engaged in pvp will allow you to take full damage as well
---
That mannequin does... I wasn't allowed in to see but I could still hear the screams. Oh god, the screams!
---
Excavation has 100 extra carry weight. I will all had that
---
It’s not the same. .50 rifles should look different 
---
One time I was trying to revive a random person and I accidentally ate him instead 😂
---
I heard about that too
---
Give r/Fallout76roleplay a try! You should be able to find some raider buddies there :)
---
actually you are 100% wrong and all that implies is a pvp server/mode is coming and we are keeping what we have now as pve. You are reaching hard lol
---
Mannequins can never be trusted. Nasty little buggers
---
If anyone has the plains for the x-01 jet pack an extra one I want to make a deal to acquire it and it has to be on PS4 
---
I beat the game by quitting it.
---
The only winning move is not to play.
---
Graham is the ONLY "HUMAN" NPC to exist in the game.
---
I would love a tank killer type perk for pistols. We have modern renegade which adds hip fire accuracy and chance to cripple but the agility branch is so freakin stacked it's hard for me to justify it. Unless something changes, I'll stick to perforating mags on everything possible. I'm even considering making an alt and playing through to lvl 50 w/o the main quest just so I can get a lvl'd Somerset 
---
Not an mmo.  It's a survival game set in Fallout with 24 player servers.
---
That's the kind of damage misinformation can do
---
Honestly patience is key I guess. I just would prefer more hotfixes and fixing the server crash issues because of dupers or whatever. I can wait for skins even though I want a Gauss skin asap.
---
They'll be coming in the future or they won't. Just because the data miners pulled up some stuff doesn't mean it'll actually be added to the game. It could be left over from cut content, or they were planning on waiting a little longer than two months to implement it.
---
I want one please! I'm level 50. eme072. I'm on PC. 
---
This happened to me. I think it’s because I put them up before I placed a generator. I stored and re-placed them and they worked just fine after that.
---
.50 should be expensive. And .50 machine gun should deal a lot more damage. Damage should be ammo based not weapon based
---
Thank you! I don't worry much about workshops so I don't fully know the pvp mechanics around them. 
---
Worse: The helmet doesn't filter, but it does occupy the head slot — so you can't wear this outfit with, for example, your Veil of Secrets or a gas mask.
---
And still worse: Equipping the Nuka-Girl outfit *unequips* my Marine wetsuit (although it does go over my modded up Military Fatigues).
---
Eh, in my case it's not too damaging. At least I'm not running around warning everyone to do the same. Unless I've experienced something myself I take everything as rumor. I might be a little cautious on my end but I'll be damned if I'm gonna run around yelling about it to everyone. 
---
There’s traps around the map that have that effect. A grenade with the same effect for a short duration would be nice. 
---
I have the same problem. Hopefully you found a fix or someone knows one. 
---
A better system indeed! They should look at players who had millions of pounds in weight for days and weeks on end. Those were the guys running stores and duping everything! I have no idea what's possible from them monitoring wise and if my idea is possible but something better then a report from any player or having a duped item of any kind is just plain crazy and will do more harm then good.
---
🤣😂🤣

ILL PUT YOU IN A CAPS LOCK

Well I admit my info is out of date on this one. The photoshopped ESO ban was the last I saw of anyone getting banned.
---
Or if they would give us at least basic colors and decals.
---
Stop whining and go to bed 
---
Why are you doing this? How the fuck old are you?
---
Nope, but I’m not bad. 
---
Those are the generators that the world spawns. Not the ones you build
---
Alright dude. You're right, I don't believe you. It's whatever. I guess I'll eat those words if I ever get one shot. Mysteriously, even though I've been attacked by people doing massive damage elsewhere, I just never seem to take the damage people claim they've taken. Considering there's just no proof anywhere to be found backing up what you've said, I'll just go ahead and base my opinions on the available facts for now. 
---
Bought TSE minigun for 10k caps, It does nothing to scorchbeast queen. Not worth low armor pene.
---
It really depends on playstyle.
---
I use Can Do and Pharma Farmer both at level 2. Then I sell excess. It's usually enough to clean out one vendor faction after an hour or so of questing.
---
Chem and food reductions are a must for me. At level 1 for food reduction I reduced 12 lbs (and I don't have that many food items). In pure numbers that is better than Strong Back subjectively. It gives +10 to carry weight... not all that good considering that deep pocket also adds +10. And to fully upgrade SB it will take up 50 precious Strength points. However, if you know you've killed everything in an area you can always switch out some combat oriented perks for strong back. The return on investment just doesn't seem that great to me though. On my Alt I'm saving Strong Back until after level 50.
---
I focused more on weight reduction perks than adding to overall carry weight. It always seems to be the better choice.
---
Everything else for me is subjective.
---
Armor reduction is good because I'm always wearing armor.
---
Junk reduction seems to be useful, but obviously only if you carry junk. I tend to dump mine off as soon as I feel like it's valuable enough not to lose to death or PVP. Same applies to the Junk Shield (I learned my lesson there... other damage resistance boosting perks are much better).
---
Ballistic ammo reduction drops it a LOT too, if you main those weapons. There is also one for energy  ammo and explosive even? Although the ballistic ammo can be used earlier.
---
As for "pocketed and deep pocketed" they do add overall carry weight but also make the armor heavier. With other mods attached you're really just getting a cancellation of weight rather than benefit added. Still every bit helps.
---
Also, make sure to STASH, give away, or drop extra unused ammo, especially Mini nukes and missiles. As tempting as it is to keep a dozen mini nukes that's 36 extra pounds! These items can also be crafted at work benches. I also don't keep bolts, syringer ammo, railway spikes, cannonballs, etc for that reason.
---
One last thing, when I have all my armor pieces Deep Pocketed I have a maximum carry weight higher than while wearing power armor bc they no longer give the armor benefits when in power armor like Fo4. But my main build also has 14 Strength (melee ftw).
---
Thanks for everyone’s help, I will try the suggestions and see how it goes 
---
The whole weapon system needs to be reworked from the ground up, clearly. Don't get me started on the 20-pound rifles. 
---
i think 30k of legendaries from nule zones and rad x and food i picked up from farming
---
Neat. 
---
I dunno, have you ever done Face McShooty’s quest in Borderlands 2?
---
I dunno I occasionally get plans in mine, so keeps me wanting to do them every now and again, got about 30 stacked up
---
I haven't found a way to recharge them...I just craft more or find them in the world.
---
Other post is right. These are the ones getting heavily duplicated because in a vast majority of cases they are by far the most overpowered combination a weapon can have. With maxed out demolition expert and appropriate damage card, automatic weapons get into the hundreds of damage per shot and rifles/shotguns can get into the thousands of damage per shot. 
---
Yeah, I got wanted the same way and I was like WTF? I panicked for a while, went back to my base, offloaded my junk items (all but 1 bobby pin). At first I got ready for battle but then I decided it was BS that I became wanted. So I took off my armor, removed some of my perks (like Born Survivor), put on a civil war suit and top hat, and took a stroll through Flatwoods. It wasn't long before I heard the tell tale sound of a Fatman mininuke coming at me from behind and boom, that was that, as they say.
---
Anyway, hopefully with more of the bugs and glitches (and balancing?) fixed in the game, Fallout 76 has been more enjoyable for you. Anyway, good luck out there in Appalachia!
---
^^^^^ This. If you bought an item that was duped, and didn't know just file an appeal. 
---
i will admit that i had had originally done the leather arm dupe a long time ago i stopped doing it once it was patched and dropped all the items i had duped and emptied my overweight stash and dropped them in the rivers realizing that it makes the game boring
---
But they would be difficult to balance and probably somewhat overpowered which in New Vegas was great because they cared about fun even if it means most people don’t see everything you made but Bethesda wants to make sure everyone uses every weapon they make so you can just look at the model they made and marvel in it. That’s why the guns in 4 and 76 eject rounds to the wrong side they want you to see what they made because they’re insecure or something 
---
Similar issue. Someone built a fusion generator for me (I don't have the plans yet), so to make sure I didn't lose it, I stored it before I moved my camp. Now I can't place the camp because (I think) it has lights and such and requires power. So I think I'm screwed and can't place over half of my camp inventory. Bad times. No idea how or even if it can be remedied. 
---
That's what led me most strongly to disbelieve it in the end, there were conflicting stories coming from many different sides. That's something we should be watching out for in any new potential hoaxes that come out as well
---
you've had a beta copy of the game for this log and havent tried to delete before now?
---
Sorry to break it to you, but your anime wife doesn't exist.
---
Just wait till they’re waving at you while simultaneously eating your lead, then toss out a 1 shot. I’ve done it to ppl, they’ve done it to me. All I’m saying is me risking losing 212 caps over a 10 cap bounty is not a wise choice. It’s the high bounty people that make it interesting
---
Best TSE pump shotgun, but i dont love it. Also i had god bunch of other Two shot or explosive guns, TSE minigun, 4\* machete, milion other melee weps. Still dont have one i would love. 
---
yea i stayed away from glitching after i did that leather arm glitch realizing it ruined the game for other people and me i have bought lots of junk off of player stores though if that has anything to do with it
---
Nice, that's my go-to weapon for my melee (unarmed) character (it's a Bloodied version which I have added a third blade to).
---
Please divulge to us your method for 20k caps a day from vendors
---
I don't necessarily have anything better to do today, so I thought I may as well write this up to hopefully put some rumors down once and for all
---
I personally only use a plasma rifle because I found a two-shot plasma rifle (not explosive). Combined with my rifle boosting perks, it does quite well. Before I found it however, I had zero interest due to the normal low damage output.
---
That’s true they just looked at what they made and went like it doesn’t look like anything to me
---
I put mods on my excavator legs to get +200 extra carry weight from the set
---
my friend gave me 400 to use on the queen i think i had like 20
---
left over
---
I didn’t know we shouldn’t kill them!!!
---
I dont got the mods yet but i wish i could use other power armor with that carry Weight 
---
That's how that works. I've confirmed it personally.
---
I also think it'd be nice to raise the point cap to 60 or so. This would mitigate the passive skills and allow for having more situational attributes.
---
There's one on a rooftop, could always prank her? I've personally never gotten one but I've heard it's easier on 76 than on 4.
---
PS4 constantly records your game, so if you see these fools around:
---
Get a clear view of their usernames on-screen, and a look at their inventory. Make an effort to gain evidence to save and send to BGS.
---
You're making it better for all of us who want to enjoy and play, not destroy and destabilize.
---
Now you're talking, I've been farming 3 star enemies and only got one star items
---
You can get calibrated shocks for all of them it's +50 per leg worth picking up
---
Well then it's time for me to change my user flair. Enclave here I come!
---
I have heard of some hiccups in the game that led to unintentional duping, and I'm not sure how many of those are freak accidents and how many are genuine duping methods. I don't doubt that there are more out there than just the two I mentioned. This might be a bit controversial to say, but I honestly don't care that much anymore as long as they do not cause any server issues. The economy is already damaged beyond repair by all this, nothing short of a server wipe is going to fix it, and I don't want my 200 hours being taken away for something that's not even going to affect everybody.
---
Poop....
---
These people agreed to Bethesda's TOC not Fallout 76 TOC.
---
You break the rules, you lose your whole account. Sounds fair enough to me.
---
"I must take responsibility for MY OWN actions." Good words to live by, unfortunately today's society doesn't. 
---
I'm starting to notice a trend from both my personal experience and stories of people being one-shot.
---
It seems like the level scaling system might just be broken for slap damage. Most stories I hear of someone being one-shot by slap the person is much higher level than they are, they tend to be well under 50, and I once nearly one-shot a level 20 just trying to slap him with a regular double barrel to see of he'd fight. Did like 2/3rds of his health in one hit, and gave him stimpacks afterwards cause I felt bad. If a regular double barrel could do that, crazy boosted damage weapons can definitely kill in one hit. 
---
Yeah, heavy metal has the highest DR. Buttressed heavy raider limbs also have more than BoS. Not sure about the torso.
---
Heavy leather limbs aren't far short of BoS on DR, and have very high ER, so they're a decent option especially if you have some metal. Marine, trapper and improved robot limbs are all ok if you want extra radiation resistance, but the torsos are a bit weak.
---
Sadly, that is true. I spent a long time on here with the mentality of believing anybody claiming to be a victim of issues like this, but at this point with so much evidence to the contrary I have to accept that for whatever reason they deemed worthy, some of those people were going out of their way to lie about it
---
By purposely failing a workshop contest you can keep reupping the PvP until your opponent either decides to play the rest of the game in stealth or hop servers. To make it even worse, a tactic my group pulled on a close friend once is to have someone join your targets team then quit the game. Their workshop will transfer ownership to that target and let you go about killing them even if the player was in pacifist. I strongly think you are onto something that the "slap damage bypass exploit" may simply be people not understanding workshops much
---
Interesting. May be worth looking for. Thanks for the tip
---
I've got a bloodied build and no body was on the server
---
That's probably the case. Out of the different online games I play, this one seems to have a rather different demographic of often older people just playing casually and wanting to have some fun. The ones playing this like it's rust or call of duty are unlikely to be people who grew up with a fallout game
---
I personally know duping still exist.  Just get on with it and fix it Bethesda or move on and release a expansion.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. I'm at the point know that I don't even bother to switch to unlock safes....and that makes me a sad panda.
---
I think so actually. It was a super sledge if I recall correctly. No harm done with it, I was selling off some spare drugs and just suddenly heard a few swings, but I saw that I had full health when I was done trading
---
I think I speak for everyone here when I say "You're preaching to the choir"
---
I use a 1 star mutant’s mole miner gauntlet, 3 claw mod, and a non-legendary heated power fist. All but the toughest of super mutants abd gutsys fall in 1 or 2 hits. But the build is a glass cannon for sure, you can get in trouble if you are not careful. 
---
I don’t really see my build as min/maxing. I haven’t seen anyone else run it and I did not consult anyone when making it. It just eventually became my direction and I wanted to spice things up. Your post seems to imply I’m somehow not using tactics and using a cheap build, which I’m not, nor was I attempting to brag. I mentioned it has it’s downfalls. Was just curious if anyone is also experimenting with weird builds like mine. 
---
I don’t have any TSE weapons. 
---
So. Much. Psycho!!
---
It took me 19 hops to get all the pieces...
---
People should never stop making suggestions.  The devs should never stop taking them.  
---
I am into it. Pippinramon is the sn. I just demolished it because I wasn't happy with some wiring today.
---
Looking forward to starting over.
---
Kill all the scorched spawn and they land.  Also, don’t hit them with any knock-back weapons while they are in the air or it resets their landing.  
---
Pretty easy.
---
Without hazmat/pa is rad rezist useles, becouse it is somehow capped. You will get 7rad per sec in nuke zone whatever you do without those two.
---
And i have light leather (have heavy leather right arm with dope legendary effects but my vault-tec paint is bugged on it lol) with that i am like paper, but with ninja build i dont really care.
---
Before i had Shadowed and BoS combat armor and it was much better can imagine Heavy combat is good egouth for most of enemies.
---
Same as locking a door while in building menu hit L2 on the terminal and it let's you choose lock level
---
I hope they do, the revolver one was honestly awesome!
---
Wrong. You lose because you're literally on the forum of the game you hate. Leave forever and everyone wins. 
---
Fun times at the Atomic Wrangler?
---
pls
---
I've never heard of the loot seed theory, what exactly is it? I assumed that everything is just randomly distributed. The only TSE I've found so far is a level 35 dragon, which I got at level 152. Not finding one within 400 definitely just sounds like very bad luck. Still, my problem with it is that for most people, you will only see what they are doing, not go into their inventory and see what they have. And even if they have multiple TSEs, you can't guarantee that they were not gotten legitimately, or if the person is aware that they are duped. 
---
If only we had been able to contain him to the Atomic Wrangler. I don't know what spread faster, the fires... or the sense of despair in New Vegas. 
---
You get the Woopsies by being a duper and getting caught by Bethesda.
---
That would be nice also I’d also include travel agent and hard bargain into the passive list they only effect fast traveling cost and prices and it’s not like caps are very common at least not in my opinion 
---
I prefer hotfixes as well, definitely focus on the gameplay. I just mean if there gonna release cosmetics in the first place, I'd prefer some basic weapon camos, instead of like a candy cane or a croquet mallet lol
---
I believe it is doing that because you have the exact number of recources in one of the req, I had this happen to me eww earlier and as soon as I had more that what it req it let me repair/ craft
---
Have had this issue with weapons and armor, also have been unable to craft seeing the same issue.  Each time restarting my ps4 has fixed it.
---
Unless that was just me
---
i agree, too many babies crying
---
1 damage within a set amount of time so as to be fair across weapon types, and number of "slappers".
---
Make it so that a player can take, at maximum, 1 slap damage per second.
---
I'd love some source on that. as far as I know, they're still only banning people who accessed the debug room and, surprisingly, people with debug items.
---
everything else is just rumors at this point.
---
On Bethesda's support site
---
That happened to someone in front of me so I took his junk and placed it outside for him
---
Im also like..just dont ban or suspend accounts. Let people play the game the way they want to. Band hackers or people that use mods that make you chest but not dor simply duping. People used the weight glitch and they didnt get banned. People saying duping had a negative impact on the games servers. Well in fact they didnt. I dont see any harm in duping your items and snd giving thm out for caps. I dont agree with them getting real money but in game..no biggie. 
---
If I pick it up and put it right back down will it auto blue print everything, or will it just go back to how I had it?
---
Faster Run Speed While Aiming gives +100 vs Speed Demon gives what +20...try to find a legendary weapon with that trait. I have it and love it!
---
I honestly can't give you any explanation for that. I have never experienced it and have not seen any evidence of anybody else experiencing it. I have not had anything notable disappear from my inventory or stash in 200 hours of playing. That doesn't mean it can't happen, but I have not seen any documentation of it happening. 
---
As for the reasons for lying, I also don't know. Some of these problems are gray areas right now, but a couple of them have been proven and the people spreading misinformation still apparently had a reason for doing so. I don't think I'll ever understand it
---
Bethesda’s website has a support ticket system. Submit a ticket. One of the options for issue type is to report a player. 
---
I’m just edging up on level 30. My legendary drops have been sparse, and many items are either way too low level or many levels beyond me. It’s a weird midlife crisis thing for sure. I’m just now feeling like I can venture out more, but I’ve resigned myself to pretty much stay on the left side of the map. But going south really helped. I finally knocked out “Miner Miracles” quest and the Overseer’s personal log quest. Those and the tougher enemies gave some needed XP.  I think all we can do is explore and try to stay alive until we can take on the harder quests and enemies.
---
Might be both. On #2, I normally run around in the open while everyone else is sitting on a building or fence, and the queen frequently lands right on my head. 
---
I did also have one case where the queen hovered over my head for several minutes as if chain-staggered. However, no-one was using heavy weapons, just me with a handmade and one or two guys with gauss rifles. Would be surprised if Tank Killer and headshots hit that consistently, although it's possible.
---
Where did you get the mods??
---
I did by replying to the email they sent. Hopefully it won't be months before I receive a reply. 
---
You want me to feel sorry for them, maybe some harsh words so they dont do it again? Or maybe we take em out the back and thrash them with a feather from a newly hatched chicken?
---
They didnt care about the game, community or the servers when they CHEATED, why should I give two shits about them.
---
Yeah, with a TSE shotgun it's quite easy to keep the spawns off your back (i.e. one shot kills) which makes it easier to take down the queen.  Wake me up when he accomplishes this with a non-explosive weapon.
---
Don't get me wrong, it still requires a bit of effort but, in my opinion, it's not a major achievement.
---
Are you on PC or consoles? I've had very different experiences over time without any updates or major changes to my computer. For a couple days I just had constant game crashes, to the point where I did stop playing for a bit. Since then I haven't really had any, and even connection issues were low. It just seemed like for whatever reason on that day the game performed horribly for me and would not let me play
---
They should lock fallout 4 assets behind in game challenges and quests.  The atom store should be showcasing new content.  After all, we're paying for them.
---
I'm of the same boat as you. I find the economy is highly irrelevant when concerned with the stability of the game/server.
---
That would be an amazing way to go about it
---
Damn, and I thought I was pretty clever to recognize that as binary, I started to convert it to decimal but then I gave up, thinking there couldnt possibly be anything more to it. Boy how wrong was I! Nicely done
---
I’m generally not bad in game honestly. I’m not always out raiding and I don’t sit and grief one person. If I engage with someone and it’s clear they’re unhappy with it I’ll usually leave because it’s boring when there’s no response.
---
I'll trade ya this already fucked chicken.
---
After finding the chainsaw flaming mod at Camden Park today, I had to give it a try. Went to Mountainside B&amp;B to pick up a chainsaw, went to my camp, and fixed the bad boy up. Man it sounds and looks great. I totally agree we need some Legendaries or at least some non-level 20 ones. This would totally be my main weapon if they give them a bit more love. 
---
I always get ammo from them.  For that alone it's worth it to me.  I have like 37 of them stored up.  At some point I'm going to see if I can spam a bunch of drops.  
---
Yep now I get freeze crashes so I have to turn off my computer all the way cause ctrl alt delete doesn’t work
---
Great find, thanks for sharing this with everyone. :) 
---
&gt;The heavy weapon perks work with the rocket launcher
---
i thought the heavy gunner perks only worked for Gatling guns and not rocket launchers
---
I use the demolition expert to boost damage, does that perk work also boost tse weapon damage? 
---
wha... what ?!
---
Ooh, that's interesting. I've never offered anything I had equipped, so I would not see that. I've had many cases where people left the trade menu without buying something though (usually because of some UI glitch that would not let them take it) but have never seen it disappear. I'd love to see that in effect though
---
I have a generic build.  I like the challenge and only get in PA to enter a nuke zone or when I’m severely over cucumbered.   
---
Still running lvl 25 excavator.  
---
No mutations.  No TSE weapons.  
---
The only thing I don’t worry about is rads.  
---
In my lowby PA I bathe in a nuke zone with my team and rarely need a stim.  
---
Ghoulish and rad sponge.  
---
Otherwise, I enjoy being a jack of all trades with no min/max...and no PA.
---
That is a great idea, thank you. I might not be on in a few hours as it is late here, but I will add you for sure.

That’s the problem with an arms race. Everyone needs to get the latest and best, regardless of the cost. 
---
Some will be found as drops, others bought from dupers.  I can’t look down upon those who buy from dupers as I’ve done it. Only one I regret is one from a duper who had gone seriously overboard, but it was cheap. 
---
maybe they were trying to protect the screen until broadcasts started up again? :-p
---
I've had this happen off and on, some days go with it and other days every crafting station in my camp is affected.
---
Congrats!!!
---
Or maybe they were playing Skyrim and didn't want anyone to see...
---
It’s a location right next to the resort, looks like a diner icon on the map. It is kind of discrete.
---
Yeah no
---
Just use the whitespring entrance 
---
I'd like it if we could choose any perk we want.  I'm sitting at level 55 and have yet to see the Master Hacker card, kind of frustrating that it's random chance that I'll ever get it.
---
Do you have any links to that?
---
??? but the Enclave vendors are NOT linked to the Whitespring vendors...
---
I think there are completely random airdrops spawned by the server, and those that are spawned by a player. The latter is what can get you wanted.
---
Makeshift Warrior, Nerd Rage, Demo Expert, Robotics Expert are pretty good. I have 11, but I'm probably going to take some points out if it.
---
Holy shit rest in peace
---
Absolutely obliterated
---
even themselves. lol blind run!

The skin I didnt know I needed until now
---
The glitched army ID obstacle course was the worst for me. 
---
Aren't we all technically dupers if we ever built a camp? All those melons, carrots, tatos, etc.... :P
---
Instigating Explosive Gauss rifle, with extra DR while aiming.  :)
---
It straight up will kill almost anything in one shot, even more if I'm sneaking.  Explosive actually makes it useful if you can jump and shoot in close quarters, though that's with plenty of attendant danger.
---
I did have a lv.35 Instigating Dragon though for a while that I still remember very fondly.  That thing is relevant at almost any level.
---
And how about the fact that it didn't win GOTY but Fallout 3 and 4 did. GTFO! Clearly because everyone that made that decision were on the  Bethesda bandwagon. Even with the bugs it had and the content that was cut it still had better content than 3, 4 and 76 imo. We still don't have different ammo types for our weapons like was present in New Vegas. My auto grenade launcher can't even fire 40mm pulse or plasma version grenades 😂🤪
---
Yep, but that sounds like it is a genuine exploit to force people into PvP. I'm not sure how it could really be fixed though, because the whole reason people wanted this was due to exploits in the past of people having their friends tank workshops and be unable to be killed by somebody defending. 
---
I agree. I just think there's something to be said for prioritization. Also I was just trying to answer the question about why some people are responding negatively to this suggestion. Personally I can take it or leave it. I'd rather be hounding the devs about server stability and pvp balance than a stash box placement that would only shave off a minute of travel time per session.
---
Huh gonna try that later, cheers.
---
Well monitoring a sub is free customer feedback.  Also it can help assess customer perception to the brand itself.   
---
The game gets a lot of crap and rightly so.  It was released in an unfinished state.  It's still a good game, but they need to win back a lot of good will from it's fanbase.   
---
Keeping good communication on here will help alleviate misinformation and build better  trust.
---
Let me know the NPCs responses when they read this callout
---
A bit of rad resist is still useful against environmental rads and ghouls, or when you disconnect at Whitesprings and load into a nuke zone. If you don't have rad-resist legendaries then I'd recommend a couple of trapper/robot/marine pieces.
---
Call me Ishmael: Two-shot harpoon, with flechette mod.  (Non explosive).
---
When it dropped, i was “meh,” another broadsider.
---
But I had read about the flechette mod, and finally got one from a vendor.
---
Tried it out, and laughed out loud!  What a lovely, shattering mess.
---
But, wait: it’s silent!  What?  Sounds loud as hell to me.  But the mobs can’t hear it.  No gunpowder.  Like a very large crossbow/ballista.  So i am sniping them with a giant pre-industrial mechanical shotgun.  And since a good stealth hit is often a kill, their friends haven’t found me yet.  Totally unexpected fun.
---
There is more:  range is low, but that really means that the trajectory isn’t flat, so aiming is way off.  So now i am actually paying attention to range and elevation and ballistics and eyeballing way high and that actually feels like skill.
---
For now, the ammo is free due to a design flaw, but even when they fix it it is cheap to produce.
---
When I  do get mobbed, i have a lovely fast vampiric supersledge that heals me while I work things out.
---
My enjoyment has gone way up with this weird wasteland weapon.
---
Beautiful 
---
nope, tried this about 20 times with no loss of radiation.
---
You can't.  You avoid this by not cheating, and not trading except with trusted friends for items that don't obviously smell like cheating.  I mean, come on: you knew that cheap TSE Shotgun was duped, you just didn't care.
---
I have explained in detail citing multiple sources what witch hunting means and how it relates to the OP. And you keep repeating "that's not what witch hunting means". I can't help you further.

I've seen a ton of cool designs on here for all sorts of C.A.M.P's  but this is just incredible! Seriously the layout and what you've done with the secret areas/peepholes is just awesome! Well done. 
---
I also got calibrated shocks for the Excavator off someone on here. +200lb carry weight is marvellous. And it seems to break slower than my X01.

I wish I could play my xbox characters on PC.      The framerate drops on Xbox make me nautious sometimes.

Don't waste their time with reports like this. They're being jerks but they're playing within the scope of the game. Just log out and move on. 
---
Wasteland justice.
---
Because pistols are supposed to get their DPS from headshot criticals (because of their much lower AP cost) and not armor penetration.  In practice they end up underpowered, but that's the balance mechanic.  It comes right from Fallout 4.

So did you scrap it or not? How much do you want for those screws? Ive got 5 bottle caps and a box of my wifes bobby pins.

Mate most likely I've been playing games way before you were a twinkle in your fathers eye. I've played and was in beta for many games including WoW - Blackrock sever was a nightmare with 10 k que log ins. The Division was at the start was hack city also, dunno if it's any better now days. ESO was unplayable, then the devs basically reinvented the game and overall now it's a good game. Go way back to 1999 with Everquest instead of fixing bugs they kept on releasing a expansion, 20 years on with 20 expansions bugs still exist since release.
---
Getting it " right ", the first time should and always be expected. However games are pushed for release and it's we the customers that pay two fold one with money another with fixing their game. Then along comes the exploiters and the games progression is delayed further. That's one way you are being cockblocked, another way will be most likely PvP, you may have the perfect build be lvl two hundred, yet that lvl ten newbie exploits the game gets an item that will one shot you then camp your ass over and over. You rage and quit the game, we all quit the game leaving the exploiters alone to make their vids and say how good they are. Then what's left? Going back to your original point No one will care!
---
Tell me this, why should I as a gamer, equal to any other gamer be exploited playing a game when I have paid the same amount for the game? Why should I be at a disadvantage when exploiters do their thing and the developers answer is try to fix but instead eg, lower Xp per kill, lower the drop rate of items, make me crash from the game all the time, the list goes on? 
---
I see your point on crying yet that's not the battle we fight it's the exploiters that are killing this game.
---
I got all of them (legs, arms, chest) from server hopping Grafton / Grafton Station over the course of about 6 episodes of Suits(~3 hrs)
---
I have a pocketed raider chest piece that gives 15. Also the durability never goes down strangely enough. Worth keeping around for those reasons alone 
---
So, exactly the same as what's happening here.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
It’s happening to me right now I froze in game closed my computer all the way (like held the power button) and now I can’t get back in the game it’s just a infinite loading screen 
---
I was in a CVS tonight and they have a shelf with stuffed bears on it for Valentines Day.  I was like, I should grab some of those for cloth for gunpowder...
---
I was also taking apart some M16 track lights to use them at our off-the-grip camp for 12v lighting (cheaper and nicer looking than other 12v lighting alternatives).  The track connector isn't needed as they are wired directly to a 12v power source, so it gets removed.  They have 4x screws, 1x springs, 1x plastic, and 1x aluminum.  They would be the perfect item for Fallout 76...
---
I believe that was fixed in the latest patch. I've been using plasma and tesla weapons a lot and have yet to see a pile I could not loot. But yes, before the patch it was pretty much guaranteed from a goo pile and very likely from an ash pile.
---
Was unaware this was fake, not trying to spread rumors. You got a problem with it we can take this out back. Lose the tude missy.

Honestly, if trolls didn’t amuse me I would have stopped replying a long time ago. Either you give solid proof or quit your bs.
---
directly east from white springs is a pic on the map that looks like a red truck with a brown flatbed trailer with pipes standing upright on the back. that location is called EMMETT MOUNTAIN DISPOSAL SITE. there should be some on the left side just before you walk in the door to hte mine area. otherwise after entering the underground area go either left or right before going into the actual mine shaft bit there is an office to the right with a prototype hazmat suit (its yellow and has 1000 rad resist) or if you go to the left into the locker room there should be a few damaged hazmat suits (only 500 rad resist) and a chance to be a normal hazmat suit (1000 rad resist)
---
be careful because if you venture down into the mine you will find a glowing deathclaw. so if you are a low level grab a suit or two and leave.
---
Has been posted many times before. 
---
I don't think you can tell if an item is duped.  Best to just assume it is unless someone you trust trades you one.  
---
As for anti-dupers coming at you, simply show them your inventory by opening trade and proving you're not carrying an obscene amount of anything.  If it bothers you or you're unsure about it, then simply ignore them and server hop.  
---
Personally I would show my inventory.  I've no problem showing how I poor I truly am.  :D
---
I'm sick of spending half an hour trying to kill a legendary enemies, using all my healing items and breaking my armor and guns, wasting all explosives and most of the ammo, dying like dozen times only to get few junk, maybe a pipe gun and useless garbage as a reward. Like if i kill legendary, i want legendary item as a reward.
---
I have killed at least five 2-3 star legendary enemies without getting any legendary loot.
---
As level 25 player it really sucks to go against level &gt;50 enemies if it's not even worth it.
---
And that's not most annoying thing, once I spend 10 minutes trying to kill a 3 star legendary what-ever-weird-ass-monster and suddenly a level 150 player came and one shot killed that, took all the loot and left. I don't like that kind of multiplayer fallout.
---
That makes sense. Like I said I hadn't had it happen to me so I wasnt really sure how the process went.
---
I could mod you the shadowed chest and either the legs or arms, im missing one of them I dont know which.
---
I got all the BOS parts (which is the best material mod damage wise)

The wave is upon us, and they're not looking at inventories, they're looking at activity and actions using logs.
---
There will likely be a lot more talk as the bans ramp up once they feel the algorithms are dialed-in enough.
---
Rocket launchers, fatman and broadsider are all considered heavy weapons so they work with the heavy weapon perks such as Bear Arms, Bullet Shield, lock and load and Stabilized. They wouldn't work with the Heavy gunner perks because they specify they only work with non explosive heavy weapons so you would boost their damage by using the demolition expert perk instead.
---
And yes the demolition expert would also boost the weapon damage for TSE weapons too.
---
You would want to use Bear Arms and Ordinacne Express for your weight management if you are carrying a few big or explosives weapons.
---
I would assume Bethesda's website is a good place to start.
---
Alright thx
---
That would require unique IDs for each unique item. I’ve seen it mentioned here that Bethesda has openly admitted they can’t track items, so simply having a duped item in your inventory isn’t going to be sufficient to cause a ban as they have no way of saying without a doubt it was duped, or whether you even know it is duped. 
---
Won't let you call in one if you have one active
---
Well I assure you I am not lying. This did happen and I am not happy about it. I made this account same day in an attempt to find a replacement for my lost gun on fo76bazaar lol. Hard to find legit traders tho, I guess most people just trash their decent drops because why bother when god tier items are nust a few caps away.
---
Yep
---
Ah the predictable "troll/amuse me" route.
---
Used by those that have no legit argument. Hold this L
---
Yeah, I figured that I would have to call it in, pick it up, rinse, repeat...
---
Do you know what constitutes “lots of them?” Does giving someone 3k ammo flag a ban? Legitimate or otherwise? Yesterday I believe it was some guy said his wife had 2,600 rounds of ammo on her and got banned when she hadn’t duped. Who knows if the last part is true. 
---
Great idea 
---
Yup 1 sec
---
I've got to admit I'm among those. I used to sell anything I found decent, but in the interest of inventory space I ended up disposing of anything that isn't among the best. 
---
Yes. Exact same thing here. I've been trying to play for about 30 minutes now and every time, I freeze. I literally cannot play.
---
I had a guy give me a big generator when I was building my camp. It was awesome of him. 
---
I just gave you a link like 15min ago.  Was that not sufficient or did you lose track of your other thread?
---
Cheers man, had a quick look over it.
---
I got a few biuld idea now, going to see which one I like best and maybe mix a few up.
---
Not too sure at the moment.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
If I, have any questions I'll throw you a DM at some point 
---
Question, what does the wording of the ban email say? So far the emails I've seen have been pretty specific. Did it say "mule character"?
---
Tons of "server not responding: controls temporarily disabled."
---
It gets a day late every week 🙄
---
I'm confused.  Why would someone trust the critics in this day and age?  I thought we all knew the critics accepted bribes to give good game reviews.  This was documented a long time ago with movies.  Is everyone living under a rock?  Does everyone think Harvey Weignstein, owner of the movie business, is innocent of his sex crimes?  Does everyone think Gamergate has nothing to do with that girl having sex with all the critics to get good reviews for her own video game?

Would your GF like some free junk, aid, ammo etc?
---
Mine too, there's a nice lead deposit there.. And a great view 
---
It is dev room 
---
One million times yes!
---
This is correct
---
Yeah the unfortunate part is its more or less one exploit or the other. The unfortunate side effect of mixing PvP and non PvP game modes I suppose is theres numerous exploits like this in the game. If a bountied player shoots you before you kill them their teammates can then trigger pvp freely on you. If a teammate was recently involved in pvp depending on how long ago and who ended up killing who to end the fight its possible for one of their teammates to still retrigger PvP back up again. If you have either of the reactive damage mutations its pretty easy to slap damage kill you with a fast weapon like a chainsaw or ripper. These mutations damage the owner and don't reduce themselves for slap damage. I'm sure anyone can come up with more ways to kill someone before they know they're in PvP 
---
It's alright, we just hopped off to go to bed and I'm gonna give her about 60% of my junk tomorrow. She says thank you though! She really appreciates the offer. 
---
so your source are reddit posts? talk about flimsy.
---
not saying that you're necessarily wrong, it's just funny that you remembered this discussion and came back to gloat.
---
*with reddit posts as your smoking gun.*
---
I have a screenshot I could dig up with my patiently waiting on a bench... while being mauled at by a dmv worker. It brings back too many bad memories.

---
I have no doubt that blowing does have an effect on the sound.
---
Since it forces the echos within the chamber to move, changing the way the sound can be perceived.
---
But most of the sound is generated from the reverb within the mouth making it more of an acoustic instrument rather than a wind one.
---
I agree it can play a role, but using that method for the purpose to get a certain sound might be more difficult than when you shape your mouth for a certain sound.
---
Using your breathing to receive a certain sound is a skill.
---
You know, I'll let the cat out of the bag. I dont really even play 76 that much anymore. 
---
Step 1 - Go get the Nuka Cola Paint job for the T51b.
---
Step 2 - Mod your T51b to have 200% def ect using the perk card "Fix it good" and I'd use "Power Patcher" to make it cheaper.. but it's not really needed. (All armor parts must be in pristine condition)
---
Step 3 - equip the vats overlay matrix mod to the t51b helmet
---
Step 4 - Get into your power armor at Phoenx in Watoga
---
Step 5 - Sell whatever junk you have to phoenx as long as his caps are 0.
---
Step 6 - Equip the rank 2 perk card that increases fist attacks. **Important** MUST be the rank 2 animation perk card. I can get online and check to see what the perk card is actually called.
---
Step 7 - Target Phoenx and attack it using fist attacks in VATS. 
---
Note* Every attack you land increases his cap pool by 200 base, eg You attack and it goes from 0 to 200 to 400 to 600 to 800. (Must Attack 200 times)(TEDIOUS) It will reset* if you talk to the vendor before 200***
---
Note2* You can not have Mayor of the day quest completed or active. Confirmed that it will not work, but you got 5 character slots.. so there is that..
---
Step 8 - Exit VATS and reenter VATS as necessary (keep up with how many times you have hit the bot)
---
Step 9 - Get out of T51b
---
Step 10 - Take your T51b arms, legs, chest, helmet into your inventory (leave your fusion core)
---
Step 11 - Collect your power armor into your inventory and drop your power armor out of your inventory to block Phoenx behind the counter.
---
Step 12 - Go to a power armor station and remove your Nuka Cola Paint.
---
 Step 13 - Sell your T51b power armor parts to Phoenx
---
That's it.
---
When this is done correctly up to 20,000 (Not 19,800 and not 20,200) you will be able to sell your entire set for maybe 500 caps.
---
This however unlocks the vendor's pool to be amplified to 20,000 caps. 
---
Do not log out. 
---
Sell all your items or junk or whatever you have from your 5 piece set to make everything in the game weightless eg weapons weight is 20% less x5 means you can carry unlimited weapons... same for the junk reduced weight armors. 
---
Sell you junk or whatever and bam, buy back your T51b power armor parts.
---
It will say the vendor has 0 caps, but you can continuously sell items to the vendor up until 20,000 caps. 
---
We found this glitch out the 3rd week after launch.
---
Enjoy. I've moved on from 76. They will patch this soon considering I just made it public.
---
Plus, I doubt anyone here even has the Nuka Cola Paint Job or how to get that, so best of luck.
---
Those are rare cases tell her not to expect that often I have been playing for 245 hours on this character alone and have never ran into someone like that
---
"3700 .50Cal rounds removed"
---
....Looks about right....
---
R.I.P
---
There is a stashbox in the resort in the downstairs lobby. That and the sulpher fountain in the gazebo outside make for a quick disease cleanse and junk dump mid map.
---
I was walking from Berkeley Springs and decided to turn around and saw him. Scared me to death. 
---
Just wondering but why would you have to return? 
---
The only possible scenario i can think of is: 1) you see vendor, he has caps 2) legendary/ bulk item you want to sell is in stash 3) you have to run out grab then run in and sell
---
Ironically, I hoard chems, but I NEVER use them. So, I've been starting to use them to sell them for caps. All of a sudden I have an addiction, and I don't even know where from. It's like getting pulled over on a DUI on your FIRST day of turning 21, for drinking like 1 beer.
---
Happened three times. Now able to get into a world. If it happens to you, I guess just keep trying. 
---
Either servers are borked and don’t think you own the game, your account is borked and it thinks you don’t own the game, or you’ve been banned and your key has been disabled.
---
Had a similar effect regularly on PC since the last patch. Second loading screen is short though.
---
Well, my it's probably still the fastest way for me to down a scorchbeast that won't land. Sure with endgame legendary stuff and optimal perks one can do a whole lot better, but in the late mid tiers it's somewhat viable to use in special cases.
---
I think the devs thought the legendary gear distribution median would be a whole lot lower than it seems to be now, making more weapons at least competitive. If you consider there not being a WS like farming ground at all (and no duping) finding the best kinds of legendary weapons would be so much slower that a vast majority of the player base would be lucky to get a legendary weapon that even fits their build to say nothing of optimal three-star attributes. I'm talking getting at most a single legendary item every hour or so, more probably something like one every two play sessions.
---
So to assess the viability of any weapon from the perspective of the devs for a vast majority of the player base in this scenario just leave legendary effects out of the equation. It's not a realistic way to compare them in the current status quo, but may provide insight into what was intended and give a glimpse of the rationale behind design decisions.
---
Whoa, many thanks! I appreciate it!
---
This sort of thing happens to me with games all the time.  With Fallout, it’s scrapping.  With Crackdown, it was seeing a building and thinking "I could jump over that, no problem."  With Zelda, I would constantly wonder what might be hidden behind a wall if I bomb it.  
---
No.
---
Ohh what a premium swine ay lmao, 
---
Nah all jokes aside i feel for you mate i'd  be pissed off myself if someone was like that, pacifist mode would be getting turned off sharpish.
---
I'm having this bug too. I have all 18 overseer's holotapes and replayed the first few seconds of each, but still nothing.
---
You have to invest a bunch of mats into building it up first though. 
---
Sure and I also talked about the entertainment factor of BR games in my reply. 
---
It is bethesda's fault.
---
nope, just pure luck
---
GT: Tonythegiraffe

After this last update I constantly lag out, ever time I log on it has to re load me into the server. Worst of all I got killed and before I could even respawn I lagged out... 1,000 lead, 15 screws, 300+wood and so much more all gone 😭
---
Not sure what platform you're on, but I got that on PS4 once. Just closed the application and restarted it, seemed to do the trick.
---
Yes. But but it's sporadic. What irritates me is that I have to end task again when existing the game.  (Since on PC the game locks up when quitting to desktop)
---
I came back because what I said would happen is happening and you need to stop spreading bad information that things can't be tracked because it could lose people their accounts it they believe you.
---
This is where people tend to post things first, and the tone and nature of the posts seems pretty legitimate. 
---
She was very upset in the moment but I did reassure her that this was very rare to run into. I'm glad I had my level 54 because he kept seeking revenge and we made a pretty penny off that scorched nutsack. 
---
Nice
---
Ugh that really sucks. I’m trying to buff this Gauss rifle I got off the queen, but grounded reduces damage by 12%.
---
I cannot even begin to explain how much I want that armor to be in this game
---
If the recent duping ban posts are accurate, it's possible that the game had unique item IDs already but Bethesda didn't act on them until now.
---
Good for you guys, douche deserved it
---
Oh yeah, I lit his ass up with my laser rifle, that also does some nice fire damage 👌
---
I dont need caps i need strong guns. 
---
YUP
---
Just like real life when people buy counterfeit designer stuff, or stuff that fell off the back of a truck. They don't care where it came from, all that really matters is they are getting something they want for a price they find reasonable. For a lot of people who can't afford to pay 100s for a handbag, if one is for sale for 10 or 20 then they will happily buy it.
---
You can get them to land in 5secs with enforcer or tormentor etc.
---
Cryolater may be useful too.
---
It's not even that. I get it at level 15, long before you get the less crit meter perk.
---
You on PC?
---
It should that weird
---
For springs, kill Yao Guai:
---
Dolly Soda Wilderness - 2 guaranteed Yao Guai (at least every time I've been there)
---
Beckwith Farm - Possible 2-3 Yao Guai (sometimes Mirelurk, Snallygaster (also good for acid), and Honeybeasts)
---
Middle Mountain Cabins - Possible 2-3 Yao Guai (sometimes Radscorpians and Honeybeasts)
---
Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast - 2 guaranteed Yao Guai (head forward when you spawn, and down roads the overturned train cars and broken highway overpass)
---
Server hop, rinse &amp; repeat. Then you can do the bulk and scrap trick for more. This will also net you a bunch of springs. Sometimes the Yao Guai at Dolly Sods is legendary, always at least one crown.
---
Yes
---
There's nothing bugged, it's how it was designed. You die, your junk drops regardless of why you died.
---
I definitely agree with this, especially if all your benches are in one area with very little space between them. Just doesn’t work very well. 
---
Prioritization is the onus of the developer teams. Suggestions ought to be brought forth in a free flow manner, don't try doing their job for them when you don't know what is and isn't do-able with any degree of difficulty or time (read: man-hour) investment. Seems nitpicky. Also superfluous and gatekeep-y.
---
Im not entirely sure as I just browsed a random post about it. Something along the lines of loot drops being tied to individual characters or accounts. So some people will just never find certain gear. Not sure why bethesda would do this other than to encourage more trading. Not sure I believe this one, but then again 400+ hours and 400+ levels and here I am with no tse.
---
I recently read another theory about legendarys being tied to the server your on. So a server only has a certain amount of effects it can spawn. Ive been testing this the past 2 days and honestly I think there may be something to it. Instead of server hopping I stay put for several hours and hunt legendarys. I do indeed get multiple repeats of the first legendary effect. Could just be rng screwing with me, I havnt spent enough time testing it.
---
And your right, “technically” I have no way of knowing for sure that the weapons people have are duped. I have people run up and follow me around spamming trade all the time (maybe because of my level they assume I have a bunch of uber gear to trade? I imagine they are disappointed lol). Ive been in 3 trade windows today, one guy had 6 bloodied explosive weapons, one guy had 4 tse, the last had 3 tse, this is fairly typical as far as what I see when I trade. I heard another guy on a mic talking about his 100k+ damage weapon (could have been lying I suppose but my guess is duped bobbleheads). I dont see how I am supposed to think anything other than dupe when I see these inventories. 
---
Yeah I put two cards on, the gun gained no damage. I wonder if it being a Furious 50 cal?
---
Its not about how easy somebody makes it for you to cheat or exploit . Ist about NOT doing it because your actions will ruin or worsen the game for others.. 
---
If i forget to lock my bike that dosent mean its for all to take . 
---
I would also throw in the perks that increase the chance to find items like scrounged and and starched genes and perks like super duper and marathoner they don’t directly effect combat they should be passive I just want to spend more time playing and less time swapping perks just to do one or two things and then having to swap back it’s pointless and really kills the game cause of the wasted time 
---
The recent hotfix fucked my fps.
---
Yeah. PS4. Was able to get back. But just blue screened again. Been tough staying on.
---
I got eaten today to rid myself of a 10 cap bounty,  after accidentally shooting someone's camp while aiming at a damn monster.
---
they are all about the same i think
---
some mutations have that kinda exploding effect, you sure you didnt pick up unstable isotope or similiar?
---
Basically just take Rad-Away Diluted and hope it gets rid of the one you don't want. You can farm them by radiating yourself, getting a mutation, using Rad-Away Diluted to remove one or equipping Starched Genes to take Rad-Away to remove all the rads, then server hopping and doing it again. You can also buy serums for mutations from other players or from the Enclave bunker to get the exact mutations you want.
---
I'm running i7 7700, 16gig dds, gtx 1060 and an ssd and I've been having the same issues somce the last update. I've been fucking around with my router trying to fix it but it's good to know it's not on my end.
---
lol that person just made you marked you, I would report them so you can avoid the guillotine.
---
Western is the best overall
---
Thants what i like about fallout 76, there are barely any unfriendly people! But sadly sometimes you run into them.
---
Would be nice to have one in there but it would be *nicer* if you could fast travel *inside* the bunker in the first place. Save so much time skipping a loading screen. The bunker's big enough as it is. It's a bit of a chore right now.
---
or wood anything above lvl 5
---
JUST DO IT
---
Yep I know how to get them, and remove them. Guess I will wait till I get the serum recipes off the queen. 12% is a small number for now. Thanks.
---
The plan is like 600 iirc, so 500 isn’t worth it to anybody other than a duper
---
Your answer is the best, hell showing them will probably make them feel sorry for you and then they will give you stuff.
---
Pretty much.
---
Come back to me when they dont use what you mentioned or even a piss easy bloody build.
---
I love the single action but the lack of mods for it makes it less usable.
---
Use VATS to find them then use a TSE to kill them if they are stuck in a wall is the best way
---
If interested you could look up Oxhorn's video on it. You can see the quest that you have to do to get it, the performance and the mods for it
---
I managed to loot one and it was comical running around with it. Sold it after cause I don't use heavy guns. 
---
Well thank you!
---
For real though people need to not build here. 6 hops in a row and someone was built there. The game world is HUGE i tokd o e guy about it and he friggin raged. Acting like this was the ONLY spot inthe world that has water to buikd near. Guess what dude. My base has water AND a junk collector. Get out and explore more. Youll find a better spot.
---
thanks for taking some time - just let me know :)
---
That might potentially be something to look into. So far I've only been keeping track of legendary drops based on enemy star count, not specifically the server I'm on. The items are most likely from trading, maybe one or two of the items were found by that player, but with 3+ it probably included trading. Again, statistically likely for at least one of the traded items to be duped, but there's no way to tell. The 100k damage definitely was bobbleheads if it's true though, I like min-maxing builds but I don't recall it being possible to get that high without exploits
---
True but if the game allows PVP and is a open online experience, then their will be people who will try to dominate or use their higher level to be obnoxious. That's the beauty of 76 as the rewards or disadvantages are so low that it's not that much of a loss of time or resources. You get one shot killed, they get some scrap They destroy your base, you jump server and rebuild for a small amount of scrap. I don't wear power armour and have had a few people try to engage in PVP with me. My armour penetrating rocket Sledge soon causes panicking when their health drops to a quarter with one hit, then my TSE guess and TSE handmade then discourages them from wasting too many caps seeking revenge. You take it in your stride like any experience that involves other people. My good experiences far out way the bad and that is what's makes this a great place to spend my time. When bullies stick in your thoughts longer than the time that it happened, they win. If you stop doing something you enjoy, they win. So rebuild, lock and load and enjoy the rough and tumble world that is Fallout 76.
---
If you have moved camp at any point check for blueprints in your stored tab. It doesn't list the items individually as it groups them all together. If you delete it the it will expand them into individual items for you to use or trash.

I got a 3 star hunting rifle from there before, cant stay ive exploded yet though think the guy before me is right could be a mutation check your stats if you havent already
---
Lol.. well i'd just settle for not having my base destroyed.  :)  But thank you!
---
Been around since launch. Its also not reserved to her, but other legendaries too. Frustrating.
---
Or is it an intended feature to get garbage or non existing loot?
---
If people have the recipes they will probably sell them to you pretty cheap, or maybe make them for you if you have the materials. If you know the exact ones you want maybe you could start farming them like that and try to get a few that you want and then you only need the serum for a few of them.
---
YES
---
1. Hunting rifle does more damage, but combat rifle has a significantly higher rate of fire.
---
2. I strongly recommend only 1 rank in each Rifleman perk.
---
3. Yes, and the answer is “it’s random and level dependent.”
---
Harpoon is hella fun.   Glad you are enjoying it.
---
Yah and tbh I felt that way about all the other city hubs and little towns. I feel like they should all be scaled up by a great amount to give a more proper urban sprawl exploration feel. More open buildings, open stores, open oddities to explore and fun and interesting secrets of the past and its residents to uncover. I'd trade a lot of the empty space there are in places for more urban sprawl real estate. 
---
It's weird to me that some of the things like the power plant and deep mines and stuff are larger areas (interiors and exteriors) to explore than a lot the towns and suburbs.... In a large scale mmo, they should be a lot larger imho. 
---
Good idea, I know a few who have recipes. Just gotta get my farm on.
---
I have legitimate proof for my side, you do not. You can have that L back.
---
The best feature of Fallout :) Preppers!
---
I'll kill him tomorrow
---
I dont know if it's totally random or what, but I have my CAMP south of the Mothman shrine and I get hit with them all the time. I looooove watching them roll through. 
---
Then why did Bethesda say they had fixed this issue? How fix something that wasn't broken? 
---
I literally got near one and contracted Glowing Pustules. Like... it didn't even touch me.
---
23 here. I look up to all of you. 
---
I have had loads of furious weapons and they have never had that problem
---
Yes.
---
This is either a really clever Reddit comment, or just straight up spam 😂
---
It seems obvious that the little cheater babies are trying to spread the dev room items as far and as wide as they can in hopes of the problem being so out of control everyone gets amnesty.  Just like the plot from new vegas with the gourmands.
---
Pretty sure melee perks don't apply to any of those weapons except the ripper/buzz blade.
---
If it were me, I would just roll the dice with the radaway. Then mutation farm if I removed a bunch of the good ones. If you have any decent legendaries you can try and sell them on the bazaar for serum funds.
---
Having said that, I think a mutation cure for the same price would be pretty cool. Although, it may not exist precisely because of mutation farming
---
Exactly
---
Wait, where did they mention they fixed a trade stealing issue?
---
1. You'll normally find a lot of combat rifles on level 20+ Scorched. Super mutants are more inclined to use assault rifles, I think. 
---
2. Hunting rifle has more damage per shot. Combat, assault and handmade rifles have much higher rate of fire. I prefer the slower guns for stealth headshots personally. The faster guns are better when enemies are trying to melee you.
---
3. There aren't that many useful perks in Perception so you'll probably want at least one 3-point rifleman perk eventually unless you're a part-time rifleman. Bloody Mess and arguably Tank Killer are stronger perks than the +5% rifles though.
---
4. Legendaries are all random drops. Whether you get what you want is blind luck, unless you trade. If anyone's selling a really good weapon then it's highly likely to be a dupe though.
---
BoS is fine if you can put dense chest mod on for me 
---
For players...
---
I mean his name is LeJerk.  It seems appropriate.
---
This happened to me just now. I was reconnecting after getting dumped from another server, and I tried to open my Pip-Boy as soon as the loading screens finished. I could hear the sound of the PB (the faint hum/fans/screen crackling/whatever you want to call it), but I could not move. Tab would do nothing. Esc would indeed bring up the map, and I could fast travel, but the PB sound remained throughout the travel (faded out as the loading screen came up, faded back in when the loading screen finished). Switching weapons with number keys, and downing chems/meds using hotkeys, still worked too.
---
I've logged out for the night. Hopefully I'm back to normal in the morning.
---
I’ve had this happen as well.  Also started, first time ever, having issues loading into the world.  It just crashes to desktop.
---
Yeah it would be cool to make a batch of food and save it.
---
I keep 8 in it because I dislike swapping in the Hacker trio constantly, but 15 does seem like a bit much.
---
*taking this to the team for patching*
---
Tetris effect, my friend. Totally normal.
---
gtx 1070, i7-7700, 16gb ram. I do get a bit of lag from time to time when things are loading in, but it's not a consistent issue outside of that for me
---
I can provide some mats too most likely 
---
There are like.. at least 50 or so videos talking about this same subject. Although they are all pretty buried on YouTube, they do exist, so I think the comment claiming you stole his video is complete BS. I wouldn’t worry about the other dude’s comment. It’s clear that you made this on your own, and that you made it with the goal of being helpful. Thank you for sharing your helpful content with our community! 
---
Yeah man, nice work, i'm on the ps4 myself overwise i was gona be looking for him myself.
---
Console players be like “what’s an R?”
---
My agility is at 15 while my luck is at 12. You can make them both 15 which is the cap I think. I can’t remember what my other stats are at though. Every enemy can basically be VATS’ed to death with how fast criticals will charge up. 
---
If your camp is near the forest or that emptied lake, there is no need for turrets. 
---
My guy, asking for something that'd take less than 5 minutes of any single members time out of the entire fallout 76 team is not going to cause a delay in server stability. Hell, even if they did 100 QoL changes like this I doubt it would affect or delay any server stability changes they would roll out.
---
You know what's an awesome situation to be in?
---
I just participated in a SBQ slaughter. When it was done, we all split up to roam around the nuke zone and harvest flora, scavenge, explore, or any other thing that turned our crank.
---
Partway through my exploration run, the server shat itself and dumped me off.
---
The closest place I was near when I was dropped was Fissure Site Prime.
---
Reloading into that location (overencumbered, of course) was *not* an awesome situation to be in.
---
Master hacker should have opened to by now. There's no cards that are random chance only far as I know. 
---
This is the most fantastic post here, and I wish more people would understand this.

Problem: when I load into the world I can use my map and pipboy. However can’t move or shoot. Tried fast traveling was still stuck. Has to close the whole game down and restart... happens 1-2 an hour.
---
Over 21k
---
Yeah most likely unstable isotope or electrically charged. Both proc on melee attacks. OP check your status in the pipboy
---
I literally had this happen to me today with the Handy Buzzblade, and I already had the mats to fix it too.
---
 I just went over to my stash and dumped some junk and it fixed the problem.
---
So I'm around level 25 and still figuring this out. how do you not have defenses? Even with defenses I come back and some stupid ghoul has damaged part of my building, and my camp is in some low level part of the map still.
---
If you need anything to help out, let me know. Happy to help out people since endgame seems pretty empty.
---
After reading lots of the posts, I think the problem requires a radical rethinking of the entire system. Your idea of making lock pick / hacker automatically acquired at certain levels makes considerable sense, but basically all the perk swapping is annoying as shit. For example, home defense, ammosmith, and hard bargain all would be less of hassle to swap out, but I'd still be left with wondering why I have to click through a bunch of asinine menus to do it. 
---
I think you need a combination of things to make this work: 
---
"Level abilities" that you get at certain prescribed points, like locksmith and hacker; 
---
"Passive abilities" that you must choose between whenever you break a certain threshold on a SPECIAL attribute; 
---
And "perk cards," which you can swap around depending on your build. 
---
I think it makes sense to me having to choose between, for example, home defense and ammosmith, but I still think it's stupid to have to swap them out. I think this would still allow for some diversity between builds but also take care of the annoying swap problems. 
---
This makes me want a bunker hatch
---
Mutation serums are going for just a couple hundred caps a piece.  Two days of maxing out your vendors (2800 caps) and you can remove them all and replace with 9 of the ones you really want.
---
I've called it a night for the same reason! This time I was stuck in pip boy. Considering it takes 2-3 minutes to load and this happenned 5 times I ended up wasting approx half an hour. Too tired to deal with it but it needs a patch!!
---
Insert James Franko meme here: "First Time?"
---
Haha sounds familiar actually. My husband got home from work early today and I begged him to drop everything to log on and bring me a fusion core in the nuke zone of whitesprings. He agrees, goes in the other room, logs on, joins my server, and I’m waiting and waiting and waiting, stimpaking and radawaying in dead power armor and I suddenly see him run by. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! BRING ME A FUSION CORE!!! He says “oh I only have this one I’m using” as he super sledges a legendary glowing ghoul and prances away. I WANT A DIVOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORCE!
---
Thats not a problem. I’ll decide what to do in the morning. Plenty of tine, the Gauss already does 535 damage.
---
just keep walking discovering new places, killing as much as you can, mod weapons cooking and  crafting, and the quests give you a fair amount of xp for someone at the level your at soon you will be going through enemies like a knife through butter and youll fly up the levels at that point.  Events can be benificial to xp aswell if you see high level enemies fighting shoot them even if you cant kill them the other enemy there fighting will kill it an youll get the xp but basically its just the grind of it all, youll be a high level in no time just keep active.
---
I think this is dumb because it destroys the whole point of having a progression system. If you don't have to decide between different abilities, then why not just hand them out automatically when you arrive at certain levels? You're demanding something, I think, that renders the whole system pointless, which I think points to the need for radically rethinking it from the ground up instead of just tweaking it.
---
What?
---
 Walked into Lowe’s and saw a row of fans and thought Jackpot!!!
---
Sleep before doing anything.
---
If u have friends, join up and get inspiration perk under charisma.
---
Look for leader bobble heads.
---
The above is small xp boosts.
---
Then go to low lvl areas and farm enemies with the guns and ammo they drop.
---
Xbox 1. Cant repair a weapon even though I have all the necessary materials. I've repaired it many times before. This is my main weapon so it's a bit of a game breaker right now. 
---
It's the reason i'm switching to rifles over pistols. I absolutely cannot justify using pistols simply because of covert ops, white knight, and adrenaline. Which sucks even more because I so badly wanted a gunslinger build. 
---
I bet fallout 76 is dead as fk
---
You do know how long it took for them to fix the lever action animations right? You expect them to add reload animations for another hand now too? Let's not get hasty 🤣😂
---
Just kill everything you see and get yourself a hazmat suit asap. If you see a nuke at Whitespring, go and tag as many glowing ones as you can. You'll level up in no time. Also sleep. It gives you a nice little 5% xp boost. Good luck 🤘
---
I contacted tech support. They said, my problem is my CPU below minimal requirements, so nothing can be done. They said the "performance" was the issue. I ran, for example AC Odessey in 40-50 FPS on high settings. It seems F76 is more demanding.
---
Good luck with your case, I am done with this.
---
It's got some brutal damage out put for sure, until about 6 kills in when it breaks :-)  I love doing this and running around and would love to see you do some in depth testing to really figure it all out.  
---
Two things I know for sure: 
---
1. It's damage is higher than chainsaw right out of the gate, not sure when the chainsaw reaches 200 damage per tick.  
---
2.  Make sure you take Basher if you are going to use this, it GREATLY increase the damage output since the spinning counts as a bash attack.  The more damage it does, the less hits on the enemy it does, the longer the durability lasts.  
---
Can't wait for updates!
---
Truth
---
Are you new to the game? Get used to this, you'll see it more often than that.
---
Kids these days and their big fancy 600 weight stash boxes. Back in my day we used to have 400 weight stash boxes.
---
This needs to be seen. Having a separate stash for food stuffs is the best idea I've seen as of yet. So simple yet brilliant. 
---
I'm in a similar position but I don't want to sell the loot I want to collect it. If I go farming I'll get even more overencumbered and not be able to fast travel even with all weight reduction perks and fully modded Excavator. I sure hope they plan to give us more stash space soon like an extra 400 or something, because it's no fun getting cool weapons and armor drops and having to drop or sell them for a measly sum. I got the last piece for the full set of Troubleshooter armor, not all the best types of pieces that I want but I tried it out and it was pretty nice doing the silo run with -75% damage on top of armor and perks. Would be very nice to get those pieces all heavy combat armor or something but it's nice as it is also. I would like to collect damage sets for all types of enemies, and not have to throw away or sell every cool weapon I find just because it's not OMG OP 3 star top tier rolls.
---
Mine has no issue with this.
---
Last night when i tried to get a picture she just vanished wasnt the first time i killed her like, but the body disappears fast from what i've seen.
---
RELEASE THE WOOBS 
---
Well if it was just these 3 people then I might be inclined to believe they were lucky, but like I said this is the typical trade window I see. At some point this just becomes a statistical impossibility when dozens of players 1/5 to 1/2 my level have found or traded for 4+ legit b/e or tse. I can only see the exact same tse handmade and tse 50 cal so many times before I call foul.
---
But I guess we will just have to disagree.
---
I stream line my stash, use melee, and help newer players. 
---
Never picked up Basher since it's relatively useless, however if it increases the damage I'm all for that.  Getting bored in game now days so I'm trying to find fun things to do/use.  I'll get a Chainsaw and Buzz Blade modded/repaired up again to test against to be sure.
---
The same could be said of power armor helmets
---
But forreal can we get Wooby flair???
---
Coming for you either way.
---

Have tried running the game on both my SSD and HDD, the game seems to load faster on normal HDD lol, and stutters even on the SSD. =/
---
I put 12 in perception. I've been vats stealth rifle my whole game play. Around level 80 something now with almost 200 hours. I explored a lot and built some, no power leveling or I'd be a lot higher. I use hunting rifle for long range stuff. As others have said great damage output but slower rof.
---
I made one chambered in 38 and 50 too. Not as much damage but I'm never short on ammo. I used a combat for a long time for mid and short range. But once you get handmade or lever they are better. But that's higher level typically. Combat will be good for you for a long time.
---
Perception perks are 3 tank killer, that one is essential to any rifle build. 3 conc fire, I'm thinking about dropping that to one because with perception buffs and mutations my accuracy is already really high, perception around 20. I'd replace it with more damage. Now I have 3 rifleman, 2 expert rifleman, 1 master rifleman. That gives 65% bonus and makes it easy to swap out lockpicks or green thumb and glow sights for nuke zone.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Unless you have someone to carry you, I recommend events. Questing is not the fastest way to level up but that's where you get a lot of good lore. Mainly, you want to be killing as many high level enemies as possible. You gotta enjoy the ride though, otherwise the destination won't be much better
---
Thanks for clarifying what the wedding rings are for ;P
---
This. 👍🏻
---
Any idea where I can get a hazmat suit? And thanks!
---
Any events you would recommend?
---
This is pure genius.
---
PC player here, but I think this issue is universal. Using VATS while in power armor drains my fusion cores at a rate proportional to my VATS AP use. Since my build is focused on VATS and critical hits, this means I cannot fight in power armor unless I'm willing to burn through several cores per minute. I've tried equipping the Full Charge perk, but that didn't change anything. 
---
I'm certain that this is not intentional, and it's hurting my enjoyment of the game. 
---
You're one of the lucky ones if your NBN is efficient. It's hit and miss. I'm finding since update, logging on the first time results in a crash then after that it's fine.
---
Honestly I don’t know how 4 made Game of the Year at one of the game awards events. The Witcher 3 has it beat hands down and I am not even a big Witcher fan. That won game of the year at the main game awards .  NV had real choice, crazy mechanic scripts put in from Obsidian if they would had gotten one more week to a month NV would had gotten game of the year launch would had been smoother, and Obsidian would had been paid the full agreed amount. 
---
Power armor helmets do prevent airborne diseases.
---
A+ research and use of the scientific method. 
---
one guy did this to me once in uranium fever too, now i also try to do it!
---
I've only ever placed one.
---
Thats a pvp event. Its not an exploit...
---
Any of the 'nuke symbol' places on the map. Don't really know off the top of my head. The only one I know is in a high level area but there are loads of them on the map. I'm sure a quick google of 'low level hazmat suit' would have some info for you 👍
---
Hi! Level 57 here up for anything, got a mic too! Hope you don’t mind me being a chick. PSN: Liversss
---
Hell just go pay fadingsignal and add in True Storms as a baseline mechanic.
---
*with the ghoul hordes*
---
*even tho he's still never corrected it from "hoard" in the holotape*
---
*do whitespring farmers count as Ghoul Hoarders?*
---
🤔
---
One thing I think is stupid is that the Nuka girl outfit doesn't. I mean fair enough if you could wear a gas mask with it but nope.
---
They do? Forgot there are airborne i was just thinking of getting diseases from mobs. They should also prevent a fucking mole rat from biting through my armor and giving me diseases.
---
*You don’t need to play with those people, you don’t need interact with them at all. It’s a self failing propohecy filled with hypocrisy that your way of playing is right at all!* 🎶
---
My first time I never got the Scortched Earth quest rewards. Just said "completed". I was quite saddened.   
---
I log in and wait until the classical radio plays from my pip boy. I run 100 feet and freeze solid and have to quit application. I play on PS4 and has happened ALOT since last patch.
---
I thought so too.  I think I'd need to get it in a pack though, I seem to get duplicates every time.  Maybe I'm missing/missed something,  but I really want it before I go back to try a silo again.
---
Shouldn't it be the case that after level 50 you should have every perk 'available' to you?  Is it just that I don't have the card?  Most are stackable, so you just add a point, hacker and lock are unique cards.  
---
Thanks! I'm just gonna give her some more of my stuff and we'll go scrap hunting tomorrow. I fucked that guy up pretty bad and took his caps. 
---
Thing is I don't believe enemies actually spawn and attack your base unless an actual player is around.
---
At least from what I've noticed the enemies always seem to spawn after I arrive.
---
No, I have Marsupial and speed demon. I have starched Genes as well, so I know I am not picking up any new mutations. I did make some food, so maybe a food affect?
---
Can't wait for the sequel.
---
~~Bully~~ Witch Hunters 2: r/fo76 reverse witch hunts witch hunting players to protect the integrity of duping in a world of witch hunters
---
Already made it lol.
---
I'm 99% sure that if they put this in the game you'd never see anyone wear anything else. Seriously. It'd be Fallout 76: West Virginia Rangers.
---
That being said, OH MY GOD PLEASE PUT IT IN THE GAME I WANT IT SO BAD! 
---
Again, I'm not trying to make some sanctimonious argument here. I was just giving my thoughts on why some people are reacting negatively to this suggestion. There are many improvements that can and should be made to this wonderful game, but I think some people (myself included) feel this isn't the one that needs our attention at the moment. Making the slow walk to the Artisan Corner from the bunker isn't making curse at this game.... Getting disconnected at pivotal moments is.
---
I didn't farm for XP even remotely and I'm lvl 150~. I play efficiently and I've been all over the map, seen all the lore, listened to the stories. Just because people are high level and have good gear doesn't mean they've missed stuff, or glitched their way to high levels. 
---
On the main topic, I log in, drop a nuke and do my daily vendor run. I have nothing new or exciting to do. We desperately need new content, and soon. And we need it to not be instantly farmable - I really hope the vaults are both long, very difficult and have a weekly lockout. 
---
Can multiple people not trade at the same time in the bunker under white springs? There are 3 of all the different vendors there
---
Yesterday i killed over 20 bloated one's in whitespring and when i killed the last one i was going to loot them but after i looted one they all disappeared... There were couple legendarys so... 
---
I’m literally reading this waiting for it to load back in from a crash
---
Ignore everything you just read and everything you wrote to just go play the game. ;)
---
You'll know shady stuff if you see someone trying to sell you one of _Two-Shot Pump Action Shotgun (23)_ for 5k caps.
---
Personally I'm just pleased they are making the effort. It's just a day. I think it's great that they care enough to put out info 4 times a month... it's a lot more than most companies can say *coughblizzardcough*
---
Good times. The Cannibal Perk is good for saving food carry space. 
---
At this point i dont even care and theres is sadly no way to tell. Its honestly not my fault they exist. I had the opportunity to get my hands on a Tse Dragon i surely wont deny it. The guy who gave it to me surely is not a duper thazs for sure. 
---
Get Good Grief by killing wanted players. It’s the easiest way. 
---
It's a learnable mod for each type of armor, applied at the armor bench. Learn it by plan, or breaking down armor
---
Enforcer under Agility and any shotgun.
---
I’m literally reading this waiting for it to load back in from a crash 
---
Well, did you hold onto those items you got from dupers? Like, 2mil nuka colas or tses? I'm thinking there's something you aint telling us
---
All revolvers in the game are single-action and so have about the same ROF. All of them sans Single-Action Revolver can be modded with a hair trigger if you want faster.
---
Unfortunately as of right now there is no real alternative that fits in between the two main pistol types. You either have a fast-firing, high-capacity semi-automatic or a slow-firing, 6 shot revolver.
---
My gunslinger is lvl 55 and I recently solo'd a silo with him. They're definitely viable but I feel as though rifles have an edge. Agility is absolutely too stacked for pistol builds. I do think they are less demanding on AP but the TTK on high DR enemies is noticeably more than my other two characters
---
Yeah I mean. Realistically you should immune to almost all melee attacks, specifically wood bats, canes, fucking wood boards, ghouls, 99% of animals, ect.
---
Ive got it and never got it out of a pack, and nuke dragon says it just unlocks at a certain level. Maybe it unlocks after level 50 and I just didn't pay attention. 
---
Having the same issue on PS4
---
When Obsidian was commissioned to make FNV they recieved no royalties and had a bonus payment contingent on the game getting a particular score on Metacritic. They missed the mark by a very small margin (one point or less than one, I believe) and thus Bethesda didn’t have to pay them the bonus. Some people think Bethesda pushed up the release date to sabotage the game just enough so they wouldn’t have to pay the bonus. 
---
If we are following lore, we should effectively be gods in power armor, i understand thatd be game breaking, but some kind of reduction in melee damage and pistol caliber damage would be nice.
---
It had a knife!
---
Workshops, certain zones have really fun series of enemy spawns to
---
Fight (not just the club house), also quests that categorized as daily, I just did one for the tygart water facility and it was cool
---
In the patch note. 
---
Uh, I’m a level 16 casual player and originally from West Virginia. I really havn’t had had any of the issues described above (maybe phantom weight?) and really enjoy the game. 
---
Like I can one shot tons of enemies with all the gunslinger cards and a black powder pistol, but at that point why not just run a black powder rifle and have an overall better build? It's really infuriating. 
---
My vampiric Mr.Handy saw blade works fine, I use it more than stimpaks now to regain lost health.
---
I completely agree with all of this. Also, I miss the creepy post-apocalyptic ambient music composed by Mark Morgan that Obsidian brought back for New Vegas. Why must I constantly have the relaxed composed strings and orchestral music of Inon Zur now? He's not a bad composer but it doesn't fit what I want Fallout to sound like. Doesn't feel as post-apocalyptic. Sometimes it's too relaxing and dare I say "Happy and Light-hearted". Oh and the annoying over played mouth harp and washboard hillbilly fight music we have crammed in our ears every time we encounter a low level Scorched or Mole Rat 😂🤣

Two things here. 1: Everyone knows about the countermeasures, they're not always available if you're in the middle of a mission or playing with friends. 2: The pvp isn't integral to this game at all. Just because it's part of the game doesn't mean that it **needs** to be. 99% of the player base doesn't participate in it and primarily griefers and abusers are the only ones who do. 
---
For instance, I met some people who were nuking others bases to wrack up huge bounties then letting their friends kill them to farm caps. That's really the main pvp experience I've had so far after getting 5 lvl 50-100 toons. The others were early on, some people attacked my friends base for the fun of it in beta and shortly after beta I had a night long skirmish over the munitions factory. For a while if I wanted a specific workshop I would just server hop until I found an open one but anymore they're really not worth the effort so that sort of eliminates the only **real** reason for any pvp in this game.
---
The enemies will appear on the mini map after a few minutes. The North West shop in the desert is the easiest.
---
*Muh 18 McMonths..*
---
Raider all the way!!! I ONLY USE RAIDER POWER ARMOR AND STILL DONT USE IT MUCH. Other than that im usually equipped with heavy metal armor. Try using handmade rifle too! A bit better than pipe weapons. 
---
That is supposed to counteract the loading in and waiting 30 seconds for everything to spawn in and rubberbanding back to your original position. This is intended.
---
Lol what 
---
Semi. why waste ammo when you one shot everything anyway 
---
oof
---
Semi, you shouldn't burn through your ammo it will already do lots of damage
---
What a jerk. I’ll watch out for him. I hope he didn’t deter her from making this a special thing y’all get to share together. My husband and I play and we love running into other couples and running a muck on “double dates”. Maybe we’ll see you out there!
---
And then immediately after getting back in it froze
---
They're all good since they usually involve killing enemies then you get a xp reward at the end as well as supplies, plans, and caps
---
But if you are going solo at lvl 14, I'd probably stick to the forest, Ash heap, and toxic valley for now
---
Yep, honestly I have a sound override set up for them, the screeching is replaced with pengu noot noot so it doesn't cause me physical pain
---
You should get adrenaline, if built up too the max, it can give +36% damage.
---
It could be honestly, as blackwater brew is used to make Mud Cookies and those things are insane (like 300some ap restore)
---
I don't know why, but you come off as arrogant and assumptive in other people's playstyles.
---
Right alongside our “any” key. Damned this is lost I tell ya.
---
Source: am console pleb.
---
Can has doughnuts?
---
The 'value' system in fallout 1/2 was actually odd in that it doesn't tell you 'x is worth y' you have to actually barter/haggle with people on things
---
There there buddy. Do you feel better now you got that all out?
---
I actually just saw a post on here somewhere talking about work Bethesda is doing to try and figure out a way to replace lost inventory items from things like the Mama Dulces bug. That post said they recently implemented an inventory tracker, and just hadn't gotten the ability to interact with it ironed out yet. So maybe that's what's up.
---
Then again, if everybody on reddit knew what we were talking about we would all be geniuses by now lol.  I would rather assume Beth didn't have the ability till recently than think they did and were just ignoring the problem. 
---
Not possible but I have a guide for how to build your stack. Buying some
---
You really want and then building selectively first before you take the serums is a good plan. 
---
If I scrap my turrets will it give me additional budget?
---
Lol did I sound enraged when I typed this?
---
I can't get enough raiding! I'm sporting robot armor myself as a proud rust devil! I salvage all robots I see and I murder to steal your tech, also if you have a fusion generator in your camp, kiss it goodbye.
---
Oh I see.. now that makes sense, because I can easily make a mess and be stuck with what I got once I reach 50. I'll keep looking around to see what early perks are best for what and how to shift later to Properly min/max. 
---
In the meantime I'll just play. I played FO4 like 3-4 times so I guess if I mess up I will not be that pissed if I gotta start over, lol. 
---
There is nothing stopping us from doing team PVP right now except that you prefer to mindlessly grind.
---
What a super position to be in!
---
What’s the “median” of gear distribution? It’s a dynamic system I don’t really understand what you mean by median. 
---
It's the last location the main quest sends you to (which you'd know if you'd finished the quest instead of grinding ghouls). There are going to be high level players there.
---
That was my thought. Even with the XP exploits he had to have played a shit load.
---
I have seen an uptick in this as well. I was just fighting the SBQ when I bluescreened. Upon attempting to log back in, I received a messaging saying my account did not possess a token and therefore could not log in... I honestly thought I had been banned for something. After restarting the game a few times I finally get to the point where I can log back in and instead of returning me to my server and the SBQ fight (as I was of course in a group) it tells me I’m in a group but loads me onto a new server. Blue screens AGAIN, and then finally lets me log back into the proper server just for the fight to be over and I get nothing for it... awesome, that.
---
You'll shoot your eye out, kid!
---
It would be really great if we could not only create custom perk packs, but also have the ability to favorite our different perk pack builds. This would allow us to switch between our different perk build quickly via the favorited item menu. 
---
Don't know. Wasn't around when you typed it.
---
It doesn't read like a friendly suggestion though. More like a rant for what it's worth.
---
Text communication is a funny thing. One of the worst mediums to convey a message.
---
Hell I'd take a simple stat boost
---
Yes yes yes!
---
I would put 1 in adrenaline and 2 or 3 in bloody mess instead of
---
Maxing endurance. I have 3 in charisma but 1 is also good and you could use tenderizer to
---
Still get more damage out of it
---
I smell jealousy.
---
The worst for me is if you open your pip boy within a minute of loggin your stuck. So many extra long loading screens.
---
it would help if a lot of people making these posts specified whether they play with pacifist mode on or off. imo, it should be a toggle made from the main menu, not whenever you feel like it, and if you have pacifist mode on then no, people should NOT be able to destroy your base, but at the same time people who do shouldn't be punished for doing so because it IS part of the game. the "15 wood and 6 steel" bit is kinda ridiculous though, you might get off that cheap if all you have is a wooden box. if you actually take time to build a nice camp with decorations or a rad shower, it's gonna cost a lot more than that to repair.
---
It's possible to be killed with slap damage... if you're out of any type of healing at all and don't bother just walking away. Or if you're afk.
---
In all seriousness though, people are blowing this way out of proportion.
---
IT'S  HERESY THEN.
---
Was at the home improvement store earlier this evening in the hardware aisle and saw a drawer labeled "springs". My heart skipped a beat!
---
I can't even begin to comprehend the time and effort put into the OPs post, but damn it's well written and if I could upvote it 25k times I would, but for now I can only do it once. How to dupe up votes? 
---
To add insult to injury, the scrip was only usable in company owned stores where the prices were astronomical.
---
Yes! For the live of God, this is a survival game after the end of the world. 
---
FIRE THE EMPLOYEES MAKING THE CURRENT ATOM SHOP GARBAGE. 
---
Promote the guy who made the blackbird power armor paint. He/she is a badass.
---
Great stuff, thank you!
---
Ok but I think if they work a bit more on the game with the updates and solve all problems in this game it will be better or slightly better at least.
---
If in your case it's your CPU, for me I really don't know why because they made the game on Xbox one so it should be running ok with all Xbox not only the last one. I send an email too and they respond "reboot your console, if not work reinstall the game" what a nice surprise always the same thing... I think they don't really know what's happening ,with this at the moment.
---
I hope future updates will improve this point for you even if you don't change parts in your pc.. 
---
Yeah, the other day a scorched listener was spraying crazy with an explosive SMG. I nearly shat myself.
---
It really is
---
Doubles the drop rate - gets 2 drills from a SBQ 
---
If the vendors are maxed out, i just drop stuff I don't want or need in front of their stands.  Whitespring Station for higher level stuff, Sutton station for lower level as people might actually use it.  Tonight at Sutton someone dropped a full set of lvl 15 power armor, no one took it in like 3 hours while my bags of plans and ammo got cleaned out.  
---
Name checks out.
---
Pretty sure I've put about 20 hours ish into CAMP building over the span of 8-9 different builds by now. I really wish the budget was higher. Also sometimes I see a resource node and it looks like a nice spot so I start over anew
---
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT, DONNY.
---
Don't focus on levelling up. Just focus on playing the game. You'll find the levels just come before you know it. 
---
Why rush to a crawl? There are TONS of examples here of people complaining about nothing to do in the end game or it gets too grindy there.
---
And that’s not even the worst part. Usually the miners’ homes were company owned. Lose your job?  Congrats. You’re now homeless.  Renters’ rights?  What’s that?  Won’t leave?  They’ll just have the Baldwin-Felts guys drag you out kicking and screaming, or just shoot you. 
---
To me this is the real issue with this game. 100% unreliable gameplay. I’ve had nights where I didn’t DC/crash once; other nights I crash so frequently I don’t get to do anything. To call this a finished product... I don’t know. I hope it gets better, but I really believe that’s the only reason most of us are playing anymore.
---
That hardened my mass
---
Make sure she gets into a routine of dumping her junk in a stash every time she's by a train station. Don't get caught out with all your materials on you. 
---
While it's sad that guy picked on a lowby, it *is* part of the game and he's playing it as intended. 
---
If he was following her around repeatedly killing her, she needs to block and server hop. That's where I'd consider it griefing. 
---
You can get two shot on a melee weapon?
---
No Service Entrance is the fastest
---
The Cthulhu boss is already lying dead at the bottom of a cave...
---
It really is a bit odd that there's no stash box at least in the Production area, it has just as many workshops as The Whitesprings does. My normal vendor route goes from Whitesprings Station to the Production entrance, saves having to load into and run around The Whitesprings Resort.
---
You need to make sure vsync is off
---
They need to nerf two shot and explosive attributes and replace make some other better attribute. Especially explosive. Nerf melee a bit while they’re at it. Then make it so you can’t stack any of the bobble heads. 
---
Problem solved, assuming duping is no longer doable, which is probably is. I have all the mutations I want (through the normal and totally acceptable means of killing myself by rads tons of times), and no armor seems to be that op. So hopefully they’re waiting to make sure people won’t be able to dupe when they change it. Hopefully. 
---
We need one for heavy guns, as without being TSE, they are quite weak and extremely ammo hungry compared to other ranged weapons.
---
Yeah, I started on launch day deliberately blind, so I took a bunch of special points for perks I wouldn't use now. I'm still having fun with my character though, playing around my screw ups. I'm treating it like the stash limits or finicky building or having trouble finding the weapon plans I really want, and treating it like a problem I'm solving that's part of the game and forcing creativity instead of a problem that ruins the game.
---
The no pause/no vats slowdown alongside the other gameplay changes are forcing me to play with a different style than I did for 4, but I'm having fun doing things in a new way.
---
LOL yes. On a side note, I agree with your point of view.
---
&gt; Making the slow walk to the Artisan Corner from the bunker isn't making me curse at this game
---
Then you haven't spent 20+ hours server hopping to mod your x-01 suit.
---
Yeah the 16 wood part was just an exaggeration and wasn't necessarily supposed to be taken seriously. It was an exaggerated joke but got the point across lol
---
The issue with your idea here is Bethesda called it griefing. Todd Howard called it griefing. The wanted system is in place because they knew players would grief, and it is supposed to give us a way to deal with it in game.
---
People obtaining a wanted level is supposed to be a negative thing. It's supposed to be a way for us as players to hunt down and kill griefers and make griefing people less enjoyable. Again, that's Bethesda saying that, not us.
---
It is supposed to be a bad thing. There isn't supposed to be tricks and trolls and loot and caps and good fun for role-playing a raider.  It is a punishment system designed to discourage bad behavior and reward the "good guys" for meting out justice. Unfortunately it is not really working as intended.
---
Items probably have ID numbers associated with the item and its perks, but it is unlikely they also have a unique ID for each item.
---
So to the server databases all items with same level and perks and type all look like 999 or 666 or 333. If they dont have a unique id on top of the item indifier you cant track dupes.
---
Yeah certain flux can be a pain in the ass ive had my camp nuked twice and finding all the shit for that keeps me going but can be a long road to fix, i agree that its part of the game i dont catch hard feelings when my camp is destroyed i just get a quick thought of "well shit there goes my camp" then its back to the junk grind.
---
The other day I took over the steel mill because I’d never taken it before and was hoping for a new plan. Since I didn’t care about keeping it I built 20+ sirens and a shitload of cardboard stands and weird decorations. 
---
Oh and spotlights. So many spotlights
---
The infinite carry weight glitch was real...
---
starwars?
---
I always thought this was a story line decision thing, the stash boxes are put in place by the Overseer for the vault dwellers. She never had access to the Enclave bunker, so there isn't a stash box there.
---
I got a bloodied explosive lever and it’s my best gun. 
---
I smell a duper. Better get rid of your evidence quick!
---
Add me CommunistRaptor we’ll go head hunting for him, also can help you out with gear and such 
---
The main problem is how people over react to this and how it's annoying how often it pops up
---
Hmmm. I wonder if I can drop a mini gun inside the airport or somewhere low level and tank shots to farm enemies for 5mm ammo like in F4
---
Same here. This game has so many fundamentally flawed systems
---
Just a off topic note from something you mentioned: If you go to the white springs concrete gazebo near the clubhouse, there is a sulpher water fountain there that cures all diseases if you drink out of it twice. It doesn't affect mutations, only diseases. Plus its free.
---
Holy shit, how many hours a day do you play?
---
[Hope this helps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds2QfiPwUTM)

However, in FO, the scrap value would be 1 leather. 
---
Lmao they did not "push up the date". Both parties agreed to the date. There was no sabotage
---
They are reacting that way because they were mislead. There was supposed to be a system in place to prevent it from happening. There was supposed to be ways for players to fight back in-game. There was supposed to be ways to opt out of PVP. There was supposed to be no rewards for attacking other players and destroying their camp unprovoked.
---
Those are all untrue. Expecting people to not be upset about it afterwards is frankly ridiculous.
---
Thank you! I read that on here but forget it every time. Need to make a more conscious note. 
---
All day yesterday a post explaining how to get the Nuka-Cola paint job was on the front page of this sub. Head up your own ass = confirmed.
---
Obsidian agreed to all the terms that they wprked with the whole time, the 18 months development, and the rating score bonus. They've said so themselves they didnt expect Bethesda to pay them for missing that score, and ere t even mad about it. Theyve said before too that they'd be happy to work with Bethesda on fallout again
---
or just remove explosive legendary threat. this is badly desigend and made other legendary effect awfull.
---
Teddy bears. Top of the list. 
---
Ah! Yes, healing salve. I’ve got my camp on a lake where 2-3 Bloodleaf spawn, just need to seek out more Soot Flower. Thanks for the suggestion. 
---
Interesting but I’m not gonna be using vats and while Bloody Mess is nice I’d rather skip temporary damage increases so I don’t have to worry about a time limit. Also full charge is not gonna be needed since I can farm fusion cores. I do wonder though if blocked is worth adding in, I really wish I could have 18 Str of perk points just so I can get all sluggers, Incisor, Martial Artist, and Blocker.
---
Naw those are what some experts thought the Mothman was when it first appeared in point pleasant ages ago.
---
There’s a lot to like in the game. As a native West Virginian I like how many things from our history are tied into it (though obviously someone at Bethesda doesn’t own a map). I’ve even mentioned in another thread how the strikebreaking robots and pre-war labor disputes in the game are an allusion to the Coal Wars. Many of the places in the game are real. 
---
That said, the extent of the errors and exploits tarnishes what would have otherwise been a masterpiece.  If you want to PvP past lvl 50 you almost have to have a TSE, barring a few specific perk/armor combos.  They have become so prolific thanks to the dupers.
---
And Bethesda has really dropped the ball on some issues. There’s no excusing them for that. The rampant server crashes and disconnects cannot wholly be laid at the feet of the dupers, despite it being convenient to blame them for all manner of issues.  The lack of a real player economy is on them as well. I’ve heard of many good things about the player economy of TESO, so why it wasn’t incorporated here is a mystery. It’s the same engine is it not?  
---
I always see hazmat suits at the Poseidon energy plant. There's usually one on the roof somewhere over there. You can't wear armor with it though so keep that in mind!  
---
If you’re on xbox you can have my ultracite set
---
Pacifist mode doesn't help. All it does is add a barrier to me fighting back. You can still do damage to me with pacifist turned on. I however would not be able to do damage back until I turned it off.
---
I don't believe Bethesda ever expected so many players to be able to kill through slap damage as fast as they can.
---
Events and workshops are your best bet but if you want longevity, I would take the time to just explore. When I first started, I would rush through quests, and grab everything in my way. The questline forces you to go to different areas, but there is so much that is left out. My suggestion, if you see something cool looking on the big map, go there. You're not missing much being at a high level, one shotting everything with a TSE gets old.
---
more details? console ?
---
I'm not trying to sound like a jerk but this is the most Carebear post I have ever read. This is Fallout. There are body parts, meatballs, skeletons, blood, and drugs. The only thing missing is actual sex and nudity in this game. 
---
With that being said, why would you expect or even want a server full of loving, supportive people in a post apocalyptic game.
---
There's an easy work around
---
You guys find the smallest most mundane things to complain about
---
Recent patch cost me between 15 and 20 FPS minimum.. Also getting non-stop microstuttering and CTD's (Windows reporting app crash errors)..   
---
Before this update was buttery smooth and my only crashes were when the servers did.  
---
Dual Xeon 2690 v4  
---
128 GB ECC RAM  
---
1080ti &amp; 980ti  
---
SSD's
---
Obviously you are completely oblivious to the people who duped bobbleheads and are one shotting the queen or one shotting your ass even in pacifist mode with slap damage.
---
But here's the problem with that. No one wants their camp destroyed. If there was a system that were to prevent camp attacks almost everyone would turn that on, there wouldn't be a wanted system anymore. I don't know about you but bounty hunting a being wanted is fun. It's and exciting experience and a gamble for caps. If we were to ask for a camp pacifist, this fun would dissapear.
---
Because new Vegas had the second buggiest fallout launch ever, and there's hundreds of different goty awards from different companies, so f4 winning one the Witcher didn't isn't surprising
---
Same thing happened to me tonight, After a few DCs and a crash or two, I gave up on the night. Maybe the wastelands will be more stable tomorrow...
---
Yes 
---
Seen many from PS4 
---
Same and CTDing like crazy 
---
More since last patch?
---
Everytime I see a disease comment, I for some reason, feel compelled to tell people about the one cool thing I found in game lol.
---
nice 
---
He couldn't log in and the. He got an email say that he got hus account suspended due to duplication exploits
---
Yeah, Fuck Loving Supporting People,  and all of the joy they bring!
---
Good. Hopefully they come up with a tracking system to shut down future duping efforts, even if another exploit is found, and another WILL eventually be found. 
---
Our SBQ fight yesterday was failed due to ultimate SBQ attack: server crash
---
You have to live with the cratable items in the build menu, junk will never be dropped as decoration in the online version.
---
Like crazy, never ever had CTD's before this patch 
---
You shouldn’t have cleared the rad, lol I’m pretty sure you were invincible in that moment. I actually just had the same thing happen to me with a weapon. Weapon had 1 shot left before breaking, I went down in an SBQ fight and decided to spam the shoot button while spawning back in. I got the message that my weapon was broken as I loaded in but my weapon was still in my hand. Used it for another 20 minutes before accidentally pressing left and switching weapons... wasn’t able to equip it again after.
---
I seen someone today  bekng bombarded by a scorchbeasts giant sonic rays he was level 29 in the cranberry bog area i'm level 178 i quickly rushed to him, took the bitch out then give him 8 stimpaks, he invited me to a team and followed me for abit, which was cool he had a ppwer armour chasis protecting him so i brought him to my camp got my level 30 nuka cola armour out and dropped it for him he was over the moon, i stayed with him till he leveled up so he could actually get in it, then went tl his camp built him a power armour station and left him with a couple of spare bobbleheads, i have had a jetpack given to me and other rare items that made me so happy so i like to think he felt the same way with all of the above, it feels good helping people out aswell sharing is caring, the fallout community is great the majority of players are great kind people its heartwarming shit let me tell you.
---
No, been like this since launch =/
---
This is not a single player game. If you could do what you ask, some one is gonna steal you shit in less than 5 minutes, guaranteed 
---
Good news everyone !
---
Yeah sure, except at level 25, how pray tell to I get back at the two level 100 players that just killed me and wrecked my camp? I don't. That's kind of the hook. A lot of players don't want to, or can't fight back. Despite that they get killed, their camp gets wrecked, they lose their junk, and if they deign to fight back they likely lose their caps as well.
---
Appealing to exploiter's morals is like appealing to a phsycopats's empathy.
---
This happened to me a few days ago, wish I could explain what happened, but I can’t. In my scenario, all of the ghouls at whitesprings had turned into legendary protections. So most folks wrote it off as "all legendary robots explode upon death" but, I didn’t feel like that was what was happening. It was me that was Exploding. Bug.
---
This works.
---
It's flat out dumb to remove a popular combat system just because people don't want to spend their scrap on rebuilding their base. It's like saying, I don't like that this guy killed me. Remove this system
---
Lots of builds go without the 3/3 at 20% + damage, but if you really want those 6 points spent just decide when to swap in blocker instead of one of them 3s. Adrenaline just gives you better swarm cleanup since it pushes your damage up as you drop the first few kills. 
---
I finally found the 'Riot Shotgun' however it's called 'Civil Unrest' in Fallout 76.
---
No need, they started the ban hammer
---
What would you swap out?
---
If someone destroys my rad shower I’ll be out for blood. 
---
Thanks you for the detailed build and how well it holds up in PvP. I have a similar crit build with more quality of life perks. I have high hopes, after reading your story, to start PvPing.
---
And that's what being wanted is about to punish these people
---
Not sure if your being sarcastic but I'm giving you a thumbs up for that lol.
---
Why would I ever want to play with helpful, friendly players?!
---
When I see rolls of duct tape I have to resist a strong urge to grab them.  The screw aisle at Ace is wonderful now.
---
I say one of the gun slingers. In the end you still get +26% damage
---
The old teabaggers vs. carebears war. War. War never changes.
---
Or maybe the air purifiers in the ash?
---
Humble brag?  
---
And others have been mentioning about having issues repairing despite having the necessary stuff. 
---
Grey out the ones you don't own, and display the ones you DO own in red if you can't build them.
---
It would be a great feature but they’d have to limit it because otherwise the server will crash... oh wait they already do that
---
There are 23 possible [Prefix Modifiers](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) that randomly appear on weapons.  There are 10 major modifiers, seven of which appear on range weapons, four on melee. And there are 13 minor modifiers nine for range and six for melee. So, if they all have the same odds of appearing, then that TSE reduced weight effect has a 1 in 1449 chance of appearing on any given legendary three star gun. Then consider how rare three star effects are, that you're as likely to get armor as a weapon, as likely to get a melee weapon as a range, and that most of the weapon effects kind of suck, it's no surprise it's hard to find something you like. 
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer Pass that along to the boys upstairs.
---
Want to make the people happy? Add NV ranger gear.
---
It isn't teabagging lol don't know where you got that from.
---
Don't be mad homie.
---
Yea any word on where to get the corrugated steel walls? Not the super duper metal ones but the shack looking ones.
---
What?!
---
Hmm I can see your point. But man that would be cool!
---
PVP servers
---
And there's no difference between level 50s and a level 100. A level 25 does have the ability to beat level 50s it's been done countless times
---
Again, the issue is not that it CAN happen. It's that we as players were told we could opt out and KEEP IT FROM HAPPENING. We can't. I can't. You can't. Now players are mad because they just wanted to play Fallout. They were told they could just play Fallout. But, they CANNOT just play Fallout.
---
Good thing they're making that lol
---
Sadistic much ay sound like a paor of emos
---
Yeah I have other builds that use it I just wanted to have this character be solid no matter if he’s fighting one or a dozen. My only other melee build is unarmed with mutations and a 15+ Str, are two-handed melee in power armor viable without mutations?
---
That's a serious commitment to trolling. 
---
Really nothing to brag about. I am just looking for clues as to why it's not working :( I assume I didn't buy a defective plan for it. lol
---
When the queen goes down, keep an eye on the corpse in case this happens, and then you should be able to find the right gore pile. Can be tricky though.
---
At the end of the day everyone plays to win. For games like Fallout it is up to you to decide what winning is for that week, day, play session, next 5 minutes, etc. For some people, winning is exerting dominance by any means necessary. For others, it's wishing they could make entire rooms full of garden gnomes again.
---
The Bethesda employees did their work to the point that they considered it done. So "missile" and "technical" are difficult words to spell and bird bones dividing by zero is a thing.... It was done.
---
Reddit isn't all that different. You'll have those that think they can assert dominance by choosing the unpopular opinion and Googling how to make a downvote bot. Other people show up for conversation about what canned vegetarian ham is and what exactly is in that pie.
---
Fallout 76 is a black box. We have no idea if duplications cause crashes and the best we can do is some pseudo science on our own observations.
---
At the end of the day just remember that it's going to be the same people not caring if the server does crash coming to downvote posts before they're off to try to qualify how lucrative a value-less in-game item is.
---
To your own advice: just have fun. :)
---
Also inb4 the "duping is my Christ right granted by the Constitution, you witch hunter!111"
---
Helping people is great, but to let the assholes effect you and make you stop playing for days is silly. The game is usually a pleasant blend of both. For example: a guy obliterated my base in seconds, I got on my mic, and vented a little because he was level 90 and i was at that time lvl 12. Turns out he went from asshole to the guy who gave me gear that made my game 100 times better and he repaired my base.  9 times out of 10 if you have a mic, it changes how the interaction goes down.
---
easy workaround to what?
---
Nobody can kill through slap damage without alot, and I mean alot of bobbleheads, like 300 explosive bobbleheads to one shot a low level dude in pasifist. I've not done this, nor do I dupe, but I've seen it, and it's why people were duping the bobbleheads.
---
Yeah, every single time on PS4 since the new update.
---
Why would a sentry bot need protection against a biological illness?
---
It’s just north of skullbone vantage right above top of the world.  It’s along the cliff line you will see there 
---
I'm sorry, when did fallouts main purpose become your base? Don't say bases define Fallout. The story and combat do. So don't say a couple broken walls and your furniture prevent you from killing scorched and nuking people, because doesn't.
---
That...just blew my mind. I never realized that the crafting stations out in the middle of nowhere were linked to my stash. Since I play an "ever-overencumbered" build, I always assumed I was crafting from from what I had on my person.
---
Sure, no difference at all. How much legendary equipment does a level 25 player have compared to the level 100 player? 4 times the playtime, half of it endgame, I'm guessing the difference is pretty big. Especially since at level 25, you still haven't even gotten all your perk points yet.
---
The link icon just shows that it’s from your teammates.  The card icon is the value of cards being shared. You can share up to one point for every 3 points of charisma. Got a rank 3 card you want to share?  Your charisma needs to be 9+. 
---
It’s apparently also effected by diseases and I would assume other effects. I’m at Charisma lvl 3 to share one card. If I get the blight, I can’t share anymore. 
---
I did not know that. Thank you. 
---
Well, I've killed them in the following ways:
---
* My fists
---
* Plague Walker (thank you Rad Worms)
---
* Binoculars (no joke)
---
* Flare gun
---
I know it doesn't help in its current form, was saying that's how I WISH pacifist mode worked
---
Lol, 3 different replies?  Somebody got their jimmies rustled.  You need a hug, bro? I got you.
---
I wish they fixed the duping methods as well instead of just banning. I know the existance of cheats alone for some people are like a "illegal entrapement". A large population of people are purely motivated by greed and they can't help themselves. They would make excelent raiders if the game wasn't so easy to exploit.
---
Check the area (and bus) around Slocum’s Joe for Firecap ;)
---
Try chucking all your junk into the stash first. Apparently that fixed it for some people.
---
Just stop. ok?
---
I've said this too.
---
So many notes all over, all able to be put in an inventory and creating a unique ID number. Notes should be read only on the spot, unless part of a quest or in some rare instances where you collect pages of journals and things. No one needs to be able to pick up every note. 
---
And if unique identifiers are an issue, why are there 20 types of teddy bears, and me fuzzy dolls etc?
---
Dozens of different types of plated and vases. 
---
I get that variety is nice, it makes things look nicer but I'd gladly sacrifice some variety amongst scrap items for more server stability. 
---
Fallout's main purpose is single player rpg. Are you dense? Is this your first Fallout game? Did you miss the entire community outrage when they found out it would include PVP? The issue isn't the base. It's the PVP. Somebody destroying your base is PVP. We were told we could opt out and not be a part of that.
---
Most people are lucky to just find the mod. You have the plan.
---
I’m sure it’s just some bug.  Like I said, there’s a few threads on people trying to repair stuff and being told they have insufficient materials to do it despite having everything they need. 
---
Had that on ps4 today as well. Had to restart app to log in. Aftrr that 2 hours of play ok.
---
I wonder if it is related to their script to check for dupers...
---
I'll restate this again. There's no difference between level 50s and level 100s. 25s can kill level 50s it's been done. So don't act like level 25s are defenseless because they're stronger than you think.
---
And yet you still used the argument that op broke the rule about accusing people of cheating.... It's almost as though even you yourself knows your argument is bologna
---
Interesting. That does seem to be the case with my tiny camp.. 
---
The system is stupid. You are butthurt. Projecting doesn't make it any less obvious.
---
You probably need some more experience actually playing the game to evaluate the rules. Hint: they're stupid.
---
Not a lot of wanted players, and server hopping doesn't really help. But Thx for the advice tho.
---
My base is in a location that spawns 2-4 cats inside my workshop area and they are considered an enemy so I cant fast travel I have a small 2 story hotel set up next to my workshop with beds if a stranger uses one all I need to do is replace the doorway with a wall and their trapped unable to fast travel forced to break their way out or disconnect and if i could go into passive and make my base unbreakable then my prisoner would have no choice but to disconnect from the server
---
I feel like it is mobile game rogresd gating design intended to get us to log in every day and stretch out the content. Pretty shitty game design imo, manipulative and exploititive.
---
I just want a 2 shot explosive shotty
---
I realy hope it will be fixed. I love the game and I would have been playing it now if not for this glitch. But when, is the real question. It can be fixed in a next update, in a few months or never. I realy, realy, realy want to play this game. And I cant. Well, technicaly, i can but it will look like unrendered 3D model. This glitch is the shittyest thing I ever expirienced in games. Game is playable, all works fine but holy shit this glitch ruin everything. And thats the saddest part. All amasing work of artists, level designers... all turned to ash by this glitch.
---
I'm not dense. You are. The past fallouts are single player. This one isn't. A destroyed base leads to pvp because the player wants revenge, not the crap you said.
---
I disagree, there are raider faction remnants like all the others for a reason. The wanted system is in place to be fun, you can be a fugitive running from justice, or a bounty hunter there to collect. It's a post apocalyptic world where players are the only other humans. You think Bethesda truly wants nobody to inflict I'll will on eachother? If that was the case, items you drop would be unobtainable by other players, there would be no damage done to camps, and PvP wouldn't even exist. They could have easily done this, however its a well known fact that PvP adds alot to the lifespan of a game, you always have a new challenge in another player, and only so much in the environment, no matter how much content there is.
---
What is annoying is those people that destroy your base only to run to their friend so their friend can kill them and receive the caps before you respawn. That is trolling.
---
You put them on your finger. It sort of encircles the digit in a snug way that allows them to stay in place. They're decorative items; a form of jewelry. 
---
Just saying how I did it.  Before TSEs were everywhere I frequently played bounty hunter. Im a little more hesitant now and take more precautions, but still like to do so. 
---
That's not true. A maxed out bloodied build with good legendaries can kill through in a 3 or 4 hits. Which is a lot less time than it takes me to turn off pacifist mod.
---
You do hit on a good point here. A lot of the problem is coming directly from players having access to quantities of items they shouldn't have access to.
---
BETHESDA ALLOW US TO DANCE IN F76!!!!!! 
---
I BE FLOSSSSIIIIIIIING 🤩
---
What am I butthurt about exactly? And how do you know my experience you've never met me 
---
Good news, hope people stop exploiting. 
---
Assuming he is guilty of duping, that makes this good news!
---
Three star enemies should really drop things to the players level as well. Killed a level 68 three star super mutant, got an explosive cryolator.... that was level 25... I was level 52 at the time.  
---
Some low level got a good gift from that. 
---
And people expecting only nice encounters with other humans in a post apocalyptic wasteland, were resources are scarce, is frankly ridiculous.
---
That's annoying. I'm talking about one guy gunning a base so he can get wanted and do some PvP
---
I thought they walled over the DMV and the quest was currently on hold till they fixed it?
---
Well I don’t recall ever agree’ing to a TOS when I bought f76 on Xbox, just launched and played like any other game. 
---
Does anyone recall a tos on consoles? 
---
You typed your experience above while you rattled off how everyone except you was butthurt. You literally narrated it. You gave everyone the information you wanted them to have to know enough about you to reply.
---
What a silly question.
---
Again, BETHESDA SAID IT COULD BE PLAYED SINGLE PLAYER AND THAT PLAYERS COULD OPT OUT OF PVP.  I am well aware it has PVP elements. Everybody was. The issue is we were told we DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THEM. Read the words friend.
---
If you can get help to clear the ammo factory up north you'll have an infinite supply. It'll take a while though
---

One of the most requested features I would imagine (that speaks volumes to the stability issues). A simple timer after a crash or disconnect. If you don’t log back in in that time frame, it’ll stick you wherever.  Barring a server crash, I don’t see how this would be too difficult to implement. 
---
My base is in a location that spawns 2-4 cats inside my workshop area and they are considered an enemy so I cant fast travel away I have a small 2 story hotel set up next to my workshop with beds if a stranger uses one all I need to do is replace the doorway with a wall and their trapped unable to fast travel forced to break their way out or disconnect and if I could go into passive and make my base unbreakable then my prisoner would have no choice but to disconnect from the server
---
Don't try to understand the mind of people like this. Just like there is no cure for stupidity there is also none for willingly being an asshole.
---
Where I work, I regularly have to go down into a basement storage area. There's a place with a bunch of colourful plastic canisters full of cleaning solutions and every single time - EVERY single time - my eyes lock on them as I think about plastic for bulking items. 
---
I've already cleared it just to have some level 145s come in with TSES and kill me over and over
---
My experience? I've never actually had that. Did you not read the first sentence? People have been talking about the subject. Maybe you should actually read before you comment some crap you pulled out of your crack
---
Oh thank you so much. That fixed it.
---
The thing is that unless you're by yourself in a server, there are going to be people stronger than you, some of them assholes. It's the wasteland get used to it. Stop praying to your God "Bethesda" and go get you some.
---
Thanks for providing the clue :)
---
PvP can be opted out. It's called Pacifist Mode. Base breaking isn't PvP. It leads to PvP most of the time though
---
One thing to consider if your going to launch a nuke is make sure you have enough resources to farm the nuke site. Launched my first at level 91 solo (first attempt server dropped out but I was invested!). Had no radaway, stimpacks, 2 broken melee and no ammo left (was reduced to rifle butting turrets). 
---
The first sentence details your experience in observing other people talk about.... right, you wrote that, so you have some knowledge about what you wrote, right?
---
Yeah... you might want to think a bit about on what's happening here.
---
Ah. Sorry, it's been 6 months or so since E3 when Todd said those words and I forgot the context. Thanks for the correction. However, that's not a good thing when you constantly get disconnected from the servers and lose progress on a lot of things. Sometimes it's nice to be able to re-select the server you were just in after you got booted due to....let's go with server instability rather than a lack of caring to stop the dupers and hackers that are causing the server crashes.
---
Posts like this are a big F##k You to those of us who preordered, paid full price, or got the special editions.

See what happens with all the psychos witch hunting? This kind of shit gets posted.

Also are you okay over there you seem stressed

Oh that's brutal.

For a couple of weeks I was carrying around a legendary ultracite laser rifle in the vain hopes that I could find a way to make it practical and useful. I mean, the very first part of the name is **"ULTRA"**. One would think it would be a top-of-the-shelf, endgame weapon, right? Even after I got the ultracite laser rifle plans, then built and scrapped enough to learn all kinds of mods, there just didn't seem to be any way of making this weapon remotely impressive. It's a real shame. 
---
Good luck never playing the game then cheapo.
---
....a power plant being able to power an entire city isn't really that big of a deal. It's actually pretty common. Even putting it in the scope of the Fallout universe, their cars are run on mini nuclear reactors so making one to power a city isn't a big deal. And again, why were there no signs about it over in the Capital Wasteland?
---
Todd Howard litterally said he was going to "turn the assholes into content". They knew players would be dicks, and wanted to give us a fun way to punish them for it. It isn't supposed to be rewarding for the Wanted player. They aren't supposed to have ways to get caps and loot out of it, and further more we were supposed to have a way to opt out if we wanted to.
---
I personally think bounty hunting is great fun. That wasn't really the point of all this though.
---
You paid for the experience of playing it before anyone and that’s something I’ll never have . 
---
Done it once, I just took out his nuke rector. Can't power them missiles :)
---
Im always on the mic it makes it all the better i agree, me an a few of my friends had a asshole punching us non stop with a power fist it seemed to piss him off more when we stood on top of the bodies he was tryin to loot doing this will just give him a option to trade with the person stood infront of him we was just giving back what he was trying to give in a different way and that was great on its own, its a shame to see people stop playing because people do all the triggering shit, its all about the mindset if you asked me, if you let it get to you your only gona end up being pissed off for no reason.
---
Did the same to someone a week ago. Prick hogged all the ghouls I spawned in. I try not to make it a habit unless they place it obnoxiously like they do behind the golf club
---
Yea.  Even since patch
---
Hopefully, someday in the future when there servers are robust enough to even just house us players within the world.
---
Yeah I do have knowledge because the first sentence literally says people have talked about. It basically means I've read about it. What you think I'm just gonna post this without knowing what I'm saying? I'm not that dumb. I'm only dumb on Saturdays (That was a joke if you didn't understand that either)
---
Vendors in Watoga and supposedly Harper’s Ferry, both level locked. I wasn’t able to get them to spawn at 30-35, but they were there the first time I visited @ 15.
---
There’s also a repeatable quest where they have a chance of spawning. I’ve never tried, but a little searching should reveal the name.
---
It’s a pretty nice rifle, but get ready for an epic hunt for screws to learn all the mods.
---
That reminds me of the song lyrics.

Find yourself a nice melee weapon and farm scorched for shotgun shells, I've got like 600 shells and I don't see myself running out any time soon.
---
I would give you some but I'm on Xbox... sorry bro.
---
All Rise is my go-to melee!!! Next best thing to a Thunder Hammer!
---
Now this is a circle. You have knowledge (an experience) of a thing and you've stated it twice but no one can judge that experience.
---
You're having some trouble here.
---
Not only that. They would have to make all items persistent, meaning they have to stay, at least in your house, making server performance go wayyyyy down because nothing would really despawn except enemies.
---
Why couldn't he? How can we tell?
---
Give it time, lol.
---
The notes are kind of ridiculous.   Unless there is something tied to them and they are quest items what is the point of most of them?  They weigh 0 but most are illegible.  Holotapes as well, but at least you can listen to them.
---
Not enough apparently
---
The black screen at Harpers fery also happens on PC. Exiting and launching game again fixes it. This issue is not happening every time.
---
Well I just so happen to have a maxed bloodied build, and I assure you, this is not the case with a bloodied explosive Gauss rifle, which is my main weapon. Believe me I've tried killing people in pacifist and I can do it but in about two magazines. Maybe it's different with melee?
---
We paid for a game we wanted to play and support. Just because this game is online based doesn't mean it should be completely FTP. It would be morally and ethically wrong to release this as FTP at this time considering the game just came out not too long ago. 
---
Flatwoods gym and Charleston Fire Department both have gyms with weights that give a lot of lead, check them out and I’ve ended up with 600 rounds of 5.56 before. 
---
The lumber mill location far north west in the forest is great for 5.56 and springs at lower levels. I farm it regularly at level 91
---
PC. Same issue sometimes happens when I port to Harpers Fery. UI visible but world is black. Exiting game and launching again fixes the issue.
---
All I wanted was to try out the adrenal reaction serum I bought and it’s hella good btw.
---
Hear those darn missiles going off and I’m like ehh I barely have any caps anyway.. and this level 29 is gonna get it.
---
Something I don’t understand is why I couldn’t demolish the structure itself, like the stairs etc. 
---
Do you realize I had to state it twice because you didn't get it through your head the first time? Or do I have to elaborate this again for you too? 
---
Alright thanks guys
---
I'm fine, I use caps to make letters bigger when I assume the other person must have really bad vision to be completely missing such an obvious point ;-)
---
To start with, Pacisfist mode is not an opt out. You can still kill me if I am in pacifist mode. You can still attack me if I am in pacifist mode. That means that is not an opt out. It just means I can't fight back.
---
Secondly, attacking somebodies base they spent a lot time and materials to build is part of the PVP system. No it is not actually shooting the person, but it is part of the PVP system. So yes, attacking somebodies base it PVP. It's owned, it's mine. I'm a player, you're a player. A player destoyed another players belongings. That's PVP.
---
Exactly,  thank you for your opinion,  I am being downvoted aggressively by people who think this game should be a post apocalyptic Sims game instead of the reality of what it is.
---
Xbox One X learned the plans for the short combat rifle and short handmade and have crafted a couple of them over the past week for teammates. As of today both are grayed out in the craft menu I have all the components needed to craft it but all the game tells me is "you lack the material s to create this item". Please help.
---
All my girl heard was a female voice in discord.
---
no but i assume at one point in testing maybe you could place items in the display shelves ect.. but probaly ran poorly ...cause if not then i don't see why there are display shelves to build
---
They are, the only mutation to get are supial and twisted muscles anyway if you want to roll without Unyielding style and be a power armor wall instead. 
---
I’m not sure anyone is gonna find a better application of 2 points than starched genes for 25% melee increase for how you’re trying to play though. No mute is an RP choice right now till there is some kind of card or
---
Effect added that’s active
---
With zero mutated / pure genes. 
---
\*materiel
---
Oh, maybe I should do that for you too
---
Btw good job with that come back. It must of taken lots of time for you to make that considering I sent that 5 minutes ago
---
Which one is stronger?
---
It has been 10 dollars on pc if it does go free i would expect to see that happen during the summer.
---
Do you realize you said it twice in contradiction to something else you said as the result of your own understanding?
---
I'll spell it out for you.
---
Your experience is listening to people talk. You narrated it in your opening post. I replied that you should play the game and gain some more experience to understand why the rules are broken. You told me no one can judge the experience you narrated in the opening post for people to judge.
---
I'm sorry if the rules are butthurt and you're stupid.
---
That scenario doesn’t even exist. I play since day1 (plus beta) and not ONCE have I encountered some one hitting my camp to force pvp. By the way: if you want to pvp, hitting a camp ONCE is enough, no need to fully destroy it. 
---
Nobody in their right mind wants to pvp in this game, because of TSE weapons make it stupid. 
---
The scenario people is complaining about is griefers exploiting a bad designed system, racking up extreme high bounties to suicide to their friends and/or abusing the way the bounty system works in teams when the wanted guy has zero caps. 
---
You would know this if you actually played the game and experienced this. Instead you chose to talk out of your ass. 
---
I7 4790k (4.4mhz), 16gb DDR3, GTX 1070 on a 512 SSD with a G-SYNC monitor. Have noticed since last patch my frames seem to have dropped from a regular 70/71fps?
---
No PvP means player versus player not player versus players belongings
---
Good on you!
---
I'm glad to see your base isn't just another foundation peice connected to stairs
---
btw.. sniper rifle build? =&gt; gaus gun. end story.
---
On mine I'm aiming for 3 points in Bloody Mess (+15% damage), 1 point Adrenaline (+6% after a kill), and 1 Tenderizer (+5% damage after first attack per enemy for 5s).
---
And then I'm sacrificing some Gladiator ranks (1-handed version of Slugger) for 3 Blocker (-45% incoming melee damage), because my build is non-PA so I need extra protection. I also sacrificed some for mutations, plus all the lockpick/hacking perks (not using loadouts), and being normal armor I need white knight and lucky break, so my build's only 12 strength.
---
[What mine looks like now](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c45588b&amp;d=s50si0sj0sg2ss2se2pa0p80p90p10ei0ep0ew0e10c72cu0i30ia0i50ii0i40ic1ij0ad0ak0al0a00a80au2l71lu2lt2lp0l21e00&amp;w=&amp;n=Pistol%20Melee%20Mutant%20NonPA). I have 3 points to spare because I took off Home Defense, figuring I won't need it active often.
---
Nice plea but I'm afraid it'll fall on deaf ears, dupers seriously won't care about someone's sob story to stop what their doing, Most aren't doing it for the love of the game just ££ and profit.
---
I class myself as a casual too, I can only really go on once my kids have gone to sleep and the Gf doesn't want the tv lol, so I'm lucky if I can manage to play on a night for 3-4hrs a time. My player since launch is only LVL 68 and because I'm over encumbered most times progress on quests has been slow ( have to walk everywhere)
---
If you would like some help sometimes on missions/quests I'd be glad to offer my assistance or maybe I could create some armour/weapons you would like.
---
Psn: ibiza4me
---
When did I say you couldn't judge the experience 
---
Ditto. The only time I’ve ever hit someone’s camp was a week or so ago when I fast traveled to the golf club to find absolute chaos: someone had set up a three tier platform with nine missile turrets. The game was freaking out so bad with all the missile strikes, there was a Bloated One wandering around ON THE GOLF CLUB ROOF. There was also a dead Scorchbeast laying by the side of the building.
---
Stashed my junk, removed my armor, and three shots from a Grenade Launcher took care of the problem. With that gone, two lower levels deemed it safe to move in to try hitting some ghouls, and I helped them out. (The camp owner finally showed up to stealth kill me while I was sniping from the wall around the pool, but he did not rebuild. So... win?)
---
Those items don’t even load until a player enters the cell. And I think most of the processing is done by your computer, not the server. 
---
So it’s not really a big deal to have objects in the world. 
---
I'm not trying to say it's the norm, just that I;m pretty sure it could happen.  Maybe the others players were hopped up on bobble heads and nobody knew. My understanding is that melee builds are quite a bit stonger as well. 
---
To be honest the simple fact that you can kill somebody at all through slap damage is a problem. Even if it takes two magazines, if you don't stop shooting, and I don't want to PVP my only options are waste healing items or server hop.
---
I cant find anything relating to this. Have you got a source?
---
Hmm that’s the second house on the left as you leave the firehouse, right?  I used that as my first CAMP to hide my camp inside it.  Does the bed disappear if you try to build in it now?  I used to run to the firehouse to use those work bunches so I didn’t have to build them.
---
Just wanted mention that you can get hundreds of flux from these sites with a single nuke. Either playing with a friend, or by inviting a random to your team, quit the game by forcing it closed (Xbox: guide, then hit start on Fallout 76, then quit; Windows: end task with Task Manager). When you start it back up, you'll still be in your team and can click "Play with Team". Now pick all those flux again, rinse, and repeat.
---
Also, make sure you have plenty of Hardened Mass, Glowing Mass, and High-Radiation Fluids on you first, sucks to watch several hundred flux go to waste cuz you farmed it first.
---
It has more armor penetration though as a hidden stat, from what I have read.
---
Praise geraldo

I've explained I know your experience because you narrated it in the opening post.
---
This is pretty linear. Are you okay?
---
There's another one very close to Vault 76, between it and Point Pleasant. I can send you pics later tonight when I get home.
---
Or the entrance inside the whitespring after you're done offloading on the vendor bots there.
---
You know,  the entrance that spits you out right next to the military command room and armory.
---
It sounds stupid because it probably didnt happen
---
I'm glad they are coming to, I'd happily hop on a pvp server. The pvp is usually pretty fun. In the meantime players that don't want to pvp are stuck in poorly designed system, and they aren't happy about it.
---
Not if you're already in the whitespring having fleeced the vendorbots.
---
are you looking at the armor piece in the equip menu? i dont think it shows on the piece itself, switch to the status page to see your armor ratings
---
If no one I  their right mindset wants to play PvP right now then I guess a whole lot of people aren't in their right minds. Here we go again the ole experience the game for yourself line, hey idiot. How do you think I know this much about the game if I never played. Who's the pulling stuff out of their ass exactly? Because looks like you can't use common sense. Btw you can drop the big boy act now
---
I don’t like being spit out tyvm
---
This one would have been my suggestion too
---
Just sold a vampire’s mr handy buzz saw today...
---
Or at the very least dump us inside by the vault door as the sole interior fast travel point.  
---
That way it dumps you there if you log out inside the bunker instead of in the potentially irradiated exterior.
---
You mentioned filthy casuals, so I’m obligated to ask if you have checked out r/FO76filthycasuals 😂
---
25-40 seemed to be the hardest stretch of levels. Stick with it. By 32-40 you'll  start picking up perks that make your life easier in more ways than one, and every area on the map is easily accessible as far as enemies are concerned. SB's will still be a nuisance, but it will be that more so than difficult (bullet/stimpak sponges).
---
Oh look the fun killer. How you been lately? Here to ruin another conversation? You can reply to me not this guy. He doesn't need to get alerts from your bullcrap right now.
---
Nobody was expecting nice encounters all the time and now they are mad. They were told they could opt out of the bad encounters, and they can't. So now they are mad. Yall just keep missing the point.
---
Well in that case yeah that's faster
---
Thank you so much for making the game more playable especially for low levels! That guy probably loves playing a lot more because of you!
---
Thanks I noticed it last night when I got home. Can't believe I missed that after playing since beta. :)
---
If you stand in the parking lot of the Poseidon Power Plant, they will step off of the roof.  Sometimes they get some final shots in, before hitting the ground.
---
Lol, this is my point here. You are completely missing the issue I'm trying to explain. Will the big letters help any better this time? The issue is not PVP. The issue is a lot of players thought they would be able to avoid it, and they can't.
---
ya i was killing level 40 players at like level 11, sure the TSE dupers are obnoxious to pvp, but even they can be downed from range
---
I should be asking if you are okay. I asked when did I say you couldnt judge my experience. I never called you butthurt, infact you called me butthurt
---
i got one in ash heap and then killed the lvl 1/5/10 liberators and bots near vault 76 since the damage on the signs is way to low for anything else
---
Thank you for not being insane lol I need to sleep but these people won't let me have a break lol
---
I’ve definitely heard of it and peaked once or twice but never dove in. Decided to subscribe, probably a bit more my pace. :) thank you. 
---
Maybe they had to release it later than the the actual release... Just to work more on the defaults... because as you said, it's a really good and beautiful game but a lot of things are bugged... Sometimes textures don't even load so it's like I play in a different ugly world but that's not everytime fortunately. 
---
Enjoy
---
I crashed 11 times trying to get that done
---
Pro tip for belly of the beast **when** you crash at the end of that. Don't go back to the start, just grab the closest relay and move forward from there
---
You literally said the system wasn't stupid and "you are butthurt" in the opening post.
---
You literally said that.
---
Literally.
---
Like right at the top of this page you said that.
---
Why am I having to help you so much with this?
---
I &lt;3 you. This is it :)
---
Hey, I’d enjoy that! I’ve only played with one other player (just last week, first time!) and it was a great time. I’ll add you later. 
---
f 
---
Oh so what you are saying is people don't want to shoot people in an online shooter?
---
Maybe include power armor chassis while they're at it.
---
This is awesome ! Thanks for the tip :)
---
Which platform do you play on?
---
Why not only enable PvP while a claim is underway, and only within a radius of that workshop? I think that's how everyone assumed it worked anyway.
---
Or use a PvP system like the dueling in World of Warcraft. Have it have nothing to do with shooting someone. Pacifist mode all the time unless you challenge to a duel, are at a workshop, or doing anything else specifically PvP related
---
Oh so you're offended because I called you butthurt for having your base broken? That's sounds like a pretty butthurt reason for me. Now if you excuse me I'm gonna sleep now all your BS has made me tired. Have fun playing fallout and enjoy the PvP!
---
ooooh yeah
---
This and the riot shotgun served as my uniform during Lonesome Road.  That was probably one of my favorite pieces from that DLC.  The added armor effects plus not having an NCR tag was perfect. 
---
It was not marketed as an online shooter. It was marketed as an online RPG with PVP and co-op elements that players could opt out of if they wanted to.
---
i am sure that that's what you thought had happened, but no enemy entity is able to access containers. 
---
a bookshelf would look suspicious because all shelves you can build in your camp are empty
---
Nerf auto accuracy and spread perhaps??
---
Or buff rifle accuracy and range.
---
I don't know but I just had 5 disconnects in the last 15 minutes. Ridiculous.
---
Am I the offended one? Are you offended because you were told your experience didn't amount to much? Are you right now in a rabbit hole of trying to change what you said in the opening post to prove you aren't the offended one?
---
You should get some sleep. Lack of sleep reduces your ability to think. Maybe tomorrow you'll understand better.
---
Me when I'm in my basement and see my dumb bells. LEAD!
---
Noice
---
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about anymore. Stop bother me please.
---
An online RPG with guns to shoot with or an Online RPG shooter. Btw I'm tired as hell and you've probably got better things to than argue with a guy you've never seen before for two hours so why don't I just say your right and we can end this now? Because I've got things to do.
---
Okay well at least I’m not the only one. Hopefully it’ll be fixed soon but never should have been a problem in the first place. 
---
if you want to get angry, go to that place in the ash heap where you build the excavator armor. there’s a power armor display ripped from 4 down there. 
---
They can’t do anything to prevent it
---
Id preffear to not have issues at all. Game is not cheap at all to have this kind of issues
---
Okay we can settle on this. We can continue this conversation another time or I can just say you are right so you can be satisfied, and I can sleep and be done with you. I'll let you choose
---
In the lake?
---
One day, the lady of the lake will hand a young wastelander your legendary shotgun 
---
And he will be crowned king of Appalachia and have an order of knights sitting at his round table 
---
He shall be known as Maxson 
---
Turn vsync off. However the greatest win will come from running the game in borderless window mode.
---
Sure, but they can report it. They can have 1 employee go on ebay, for 15 minutes, and report every item that pops up. It took me 12 seconds as I'm typing this, to report one.
---
HAH that's what I did. I initially picked up 8+ signs thinking they would break easily at Watoga lol I thought about it way too hard. 
---
I did this to my friend by accident. He'd *just* bought it, maybe an hour in, and he got downed. He yelled for help and I ran over to heal him but accidentally started tearing him apart and eating him lol.
---
Yeah but they need to report several times I believe
---
Well jeez if they're going to destroy your base they should be a dick like me and just do it with no explanation.  At least I know I'm an ass that doesn't need a reason to pull dick moves lol.
---
Lol, I don't need you to say I'm right to be right. All things aside, I said the same thing in my last post with an edit, so yeah. Have a good night I guess. I don't go to bed for another 8 hrs, thus the time to burn lmao.
---
Overseer's stash boxes are located where the Overseer has been.
---
Stash boxes are located in every Red Rocket, Whitespring shop and also some other few places.
---
Not the same thing.
---
That's a pretty weak way to settle. You started a conversation about how the rules weren't broken and neither of us has managed to present any reasons they are or are not broken.
---
We've just spent a lot of time trying to help you think in a clear and obvious path.
---
Was that your goal in the post? Did you just need some attention? Are you now unhappy that you got it?
---
You're a strange person.
---
My brains fried due to receiving petty insults, horrible comebacks, and salt

It gives you a -10 to enjoyment and a -25 to free time.

I just shot Watoga’s bots to low hp and then finished them with the sign post.
---
Closest I've experienced to this are disconnects. I've fought the SBQ 6 times; killed her 3 times, got kicked from the server (after wasting a ton of ammo, of course) 3 times. Not fun.

Get over it. Look at some of the most massive MMOs on the market. There will always be a real world market for people when you can trade inside of a game.

Quit acting like this is the only game it’s happening in.

This works really well actually.

I prefer bladed melee vs blunt against the Wendigo. The one(s) in the asylum get slayed while I’m 10-15 levels below while I lose maybe 10% health (Med-X helps even more).

I don't believe so. Ebay is usually very strict, and very quick to respond to customer service inquiries. At any rate, I don't know what Bethesda is doing about it, but really, it looks like they're doing nothing at all. If they are doing something, and I just don't see the hard work they put forth, then good for them. But I checked a couple of days after the game came out, and there were hundreds of listings on ebay. And I just checked right now and there are STILL the same number of listings. It just looks suspect that the numbers haven't gone down. Especially with the  Devs Room story that popped up last week.

There's no "being good enough" unless you've got the caps to hop on the selling sites and grab a TSE handmade. It's very much a team effort to bring her down and as I mentioned before, I'm happy to help people get the experience of killing her. 
---
I can understand how people would have this opinion with the perk cards with the game the way it is at the moment. You use a perk build planner and get the all the cards you need by the time your reach your point limit.
---
However, this would definatley change if Bethesda ever introduced the ability to save and load perk card loadouts as the amount if cards you actually use would triple (at least). All of a sudden you got a loadout for fighting, a power armour loadout, one from crafting, one for a stealth build, one for farming resources etc.
---
As someone who uses the perk loadout manager mod on the pc I have to say I am like level 120 and I am not even remotely close to getting all the cards I want/need.
---
I’ve gotten 4. My luck is maxed. I give them away and have 2 in my inventory if anybody wants one. 
---
Happened a lot between the last two patches (PC). Since the last one I've never encountered this bug anymore.
---
(I'm sure that after writting this I'll get this bug later, you'll see)
---
Op didn't delete the post, the mods deleted it
---
They're still listed as op and it's still in there profile history, so it wasn't deleted by them 
---
I've been told I was strange before and I like being strange. Btw I don't like the attention because I've wasted two hours of my life doing this lol. I'm willing to have a weak settle if it ends this
---
Congrats. I've been looking for a second calibrated shock for three days now. All I can figure is MODUS is amused by my hopping through the bunker on one foot and is actively keeping the other shock from me.
---
I read the social section of every patch note from 1.0.1.14 to 1.0.4.13, I see no mention of it
---
Well technically, if you’re right, they shouldn’t need to report them on ebay since ... you just did.
---
Its no problem, like i said its a pleasure to help out others and i hope he loves playing it more too, if everyone was at war with eachother then the games bound to lose players, i dont want that personally, the more happy people the better, an a big thanks to you too!
---
I’ve had the game for a while, just didn’t know that the biggest boss of the game would disappear like that.
---
Upvote and comment for topic attention.
---
lucky hole is not dedicated to mothman it is a cult dedicated to the interloper you can find him in the mine here are directions
---
In the mine there is a keypad door  the keypad leads nowhere and doesnt really have anything amazing behind it so dont worry about it. looking at the keypad door turn around and hug the wall you are now looking at and walk to the right toward the area with the alter while hugging the wall and you will notice some foliage blocking a smaller side tunnel follow it to find a small area with a chem station and cultist outfit. nearby are more vines and another tunnel this leads to the interloper who is currently slumbering 
---
Auto - basically same damage with all the perks, higher dps, tap fire is very manageable, better chance in PVP against players running a rifleman build with TSE gauss rifles. 
---
Yeah, most of these only really take effect in the later game, and many of them are more social issues 
---
WRONG
---
They fixed the double tap trade and load trade UI before the other person accepted trade. It did not allow you to steal anything. 
---
i just played an 8 hour session with no crashes personally, my teammate crashed at least one time i believe to blue screen error code (we r ps4).  much better than its been.  however i did crash in the first few minutes of logging in after the patch tuesday
---
Op might have broken other rules, but this still isn't a witch hunt
---
I have had both the Pio boy stuck and the error OP mentioned on PS4.
---
For OP's issue closing the app and starting again twice resolved it.
---
For the stuck in the pipeline boy you should still be able to load the map so do that and then log out and join a new server. I had to do it several times before I loaded properly, was getting worried.
---
I am on PS4 but it seems to be doing it on both platforms (not sure about PC)
---
Helmets need to have stats (the same way that underarmor can have stats). And if they need to prevent airborne diseases if they have any facial covering. I dislike the perception debuff; maybe you can upgrade the helmet to remove the debuff. 
---
It looks like more work than it was tbh.
---
Can we add the terrible state of the Social menu to the list of issues. Like I'm sitting in a Discord channel with the guy I'm trying to join. Bethesda he is most certainly not offline and he is also not one of the other guys on my Friendslist. 
---
You just can't stop, can you? This is borderline harassment now.
---
Happened to me a couple of time (PC). I just waited in the event zone for a few minutes and it finally came through
---
Yup, you were one of the cheaters in ops screenshots, huh
---
Well, yes there are raiders... but come on, there are decent people trying to rebuild the world out here too. :P
---
I'm not against repair kits and I'd like it to be implemented too.
---
But I also need to recommend you the "White Knight"\*3 and "Lucky Break"\*1 perks. I've never repaired any armor since then. You could level Lucky Break to \*3 if you want.
---
This game is so dead, no one cares to get video evidence. It's buggy and impossible to track all the issues everyone has. I log on an maybe I can play for 20 minutes or maybe a couple hours. I WILL get disconnected, and it is enough to prevent me from taking over workshops. The investment too often never pays off. I also went from playing a couple hours a day, to a couple hours in the past week or so. The bugs and disconnects are not worth my time. Not my playtime, and not my time to document.
---
Not strange as in unique and interesting, but strange like a "I'm curious what is on my shoe" kind of way.
---
You're right. 2 hours is a lot to help you understand your very own post.
---
Strange women in ponds distributing explosive shothuns! :-D 
---
I love posts like these! ❤️ Thank you for sharing this.
---
That was the dumbest comeback yet. That was just a subtle version of "No u"
---
Phantom weight refers to claims of having items outside the inventory taking up space (so that if you dropped everything in your inventory you would still have weight taken up by "phantom" items). I don't think anybody is contesting the carry weight exploit, many people admitted to using it and raised a huge uproar when it got fixed
---
Hey it's me, a scorched.
---
The fall hurt.
---
Well among the three of us (first guy to comment) it's happening on all platforms. I wonder what that's all about. 
---
Oh, OK. So can I assume you also got the medic trophy too? If so, how did you achieve it?
---
Unsurprising that someone who doesn't own the game would parrot lying talking points others told them to believe
---
Dont worry about the downvotes too much, i understand what your saying, its no sims game but its not fortnite either, "a better future for all of us" is a sentance said in game lmao sorry for the cheesy quote but it is what it is lol.
---
I have not seen anybody deny that the social menu sucks. This thread is specifically for issues that had a large amount of misinformation around them
---
Sorry i dared to point out this isn't a witch hunt, duper 
---
Is that a thing we aren’t suppose to do? I have my camp set up down on the golf course near a stream. Just a little farm really
---
I mean, whenever you're ready to do anything other than tell me you have no idea what you wrote and what your goal here is we can probably do better...
---
Nice clickbait title...   it worked
---
I know what you meant by strange. I'm not unique, or interesting. I'm the guy who's trying to save both of us time here after a 2 hour debate that will mean nothing in 2 days
---
we really need separate camp containers that refrigerate stored food so that it doesn’t spoil at all. 
---
if people wouldn't buy items for RM those dupers would just close their's business. As long as there is a demand they'll sell items...
---
So is that a yes on ending this
---
There wasn't a debate here. Don't try to raise your performance to something it very much was not.
---
No, I mean like „I don’t want you to get banned over keeping duped items after fighting dupers“ kind of bad idea 
---
As you split the thread with more replies.
---
Should I just send you a picture of a carrot that you can view on your phone and chase all by yourself?
---
We already have the RNG lottery. But sure I love minigames and things that foster and facilitate player social interaction, interdependencies and community.
---
You're right we both had very very horrible performances but you are missing the point yet again. I've been asking to end this for 15 minutes so let's just end it already
---
That happened to me too, so i circled back and went up some roof, blocked him to make him think i left, loaded my Two shoot dragon, took chems and alcohol. Almost began citing "as i walk through the valley of shadow of death",   
---
I was prepared and when i looked up, he had left the server. 
---
team up with the Inspirational perk (charisma). pretty much any cranberry food gives you an xp boost. sleep in a bed until you’re Well Rested. 
---
God bless Todd!
---
Huh actually you make a valid point with your quote. From a game lore/RP perspective we are all from the same vault, with the same mission, and destroying bases and killing each other goes against that ideal in its entirety. That realization kinda makes me feel like a douche. I'm so used to being courier 6 and the lone Wanderer that the concept of co-OP is foreign to me.
---
Does intelligence affect the quality of your craft? Like longer durability bar?
---
By the look, I'd say the metal walls but it's just a guess.
---
Seek help dude.
---
maybe the gauss need MORE actionpoints for firing and cant switch targets for a second shot? (i dont know how many AP a gauss needs) and the Airport is that one Responder Turret at the Tower that cant die, go there and try out with full AP how many shots u can manage.
---
Some times it happen to me that i have a clear sight to the second enemy but vats see´s something thats in his way of sight and didnt switch target. 
---
Remember, B.E.T.A. is still running XD
---
No that's weird. you sure you aren't sleep deprived
---
see... that's what I was gonna do initially, but then I was like "Vault 76 lvl 1 dudes" lol 
---
Check to see if there is a player camp nearby. Some people set up turrets to farm the ghouls while they are doing other things. 😒 I’ve been blasted by missiles a few times.
---
And of course, who can forget the good ole “set off the chain of car explosions” trick...
---
"How the fuck am I supposed to see-" Has to be a Scorch Beast. Every time I fight one my entire screen is just shaking blue-white rings.
---
It's my fault you needed a refresher of what you wrote and that's how we ended up here?
---
It's also my fault you want to return to the attention you got?
---
Lots of things seem to not be your fault.
---
Yes please
---
Ok thnx
---
I'm not, but I should've expected you not to understand.
---
Nike
---
Yeah but there are more boths at watoga
---
does anyone know where the general atomics plant is? can't find it through google. 
---
It’s more about selling to the vendors 👍
---
Have a *nice* day...
---
PremiumSwine23 you say... Hmmmm.. *writes name in small leatherbound book*... Interesting...
---
Missing the point again. I'm asking you to end this  mess of an argument
---
I had to restart my xbox to get it to log in. 
---
It has been so buggy since the last patch. 
---
My pipboy bugged out. 
---
Load times are longer.
---
I get kicked less from servers, but I have to relog more because of bugs that prevent me from playing the game (pipboy inaccessible, this weird flashing visual bug that would cause an epileptic seizure and makes it impossible to play the game). 
---
But confused friend, all you have to do is walk away.
---
Do I need to help you with that, too?
---
Oh I understand. I'm just trying to end this already do I need to say it again? Can we end this already Ive been saying this for 20 minutes 
---
aha) I searched for a solid 5 min then guessed and got it right the first time. It's Thunder Mountain Power Plant))
---
You have indeed been saying it, but you haven't been doing it.
---
Let's talk about that carrot.
---
Jesus is your horse really that high so you can't the freaking ground
---
It's no the subject. The're is no big cities, isn't realistic.
---
Yeah! Very good point...!
---
How about we talk about carrots when I'm done sleeping
---
I have no idea what that rambling was.
---
So about that carrot.
---
I think the grey part is some kind of bleeding thing.
---
Yeah except your name is retartarder not retarder... Both sound "retarded" if you ask me.
---
Yeah I’ve got Excavator levelled to 45 now.
---
It would be cool if you or somebody else could take pictures of this when they can.
---
How about you understand the carrot is a common euphemism for leading a donkey (or jackass, if you prefer) around.
---
You want that picture so you can do this solo?
---
Use n sell serums 
---
Yeah I'm assuming that's a yes on let's end this
---
Have TS single action if you are interested
---
Thanks for all the great responses here. I really appreciate the community on this sub. 
---
I shamelessly server hopped lvl 1 bots... The Atom $tore doesn't make it easy man. It's hard out here in these streets. lmao
---
Nah not really, you're still constrained by the configuration of SPECIAL perks.  The only difference with having presets is removing the tedium of managing the cards,  it doesn't give you any additional ability.
---
reminded me of this https://i.imgur.com/yfhNe.jpg
---
A tad dramatic. 
---
I would have just sold them/game them away or transferred them to an alt character. 
---
Until they have perk loudouts, I like to have the option to play my handmade rifleman, axe wielding barbarina and my shotgun PA tank. 
---
Good for roleplaying too. My barbarina only ever grunts in voicechat, whilst the rifleman is an intellectual. 
---
Really, though, splitting the thread to duplicate all the replies made no sense.
---
If you summon one and pick it open your fine 
---
If someone else summons it and you pick it open you get a 5 cap bounty 
---
and now unlike normal containers you and I will see the same items and if i take an item from it it is removed from the container 
---
taking things from it doesn't make you wanted its picking open a strangers drop that makes you wanted
---
Wow. Sorry to have stepped on your toes. It's how I interpreted the patch notes. Clearly this is more important to you than to me. I'm just waiting on the game to improve and then I'll continue the adventure in the wastelands.
---
Trading occurring without consent. I took that as a trade happening without consent. 
---
They're too busy scaring people who ended up trading for owl masks and marine helmets.
---
K thnx
---
Ebay is not very quick to remove items without a pre existing agreement with the company reporting. There is a long form that has to be filled out PER listing. Ebay then reviews the item and decides whether or not to remove it. This can take over a week. 
---
Source: I am an ebay seller and had to have my custom branded stuff removed that another seller was selling.
---
Just bring back F:NV as a whole. With the new graphics and the craft mechanics, it can only make it even better
---
The population is usually fairly quick to control themselves when their account is at risk.
---
Who knows, maybe they'll try harder next time. They can always buy the game again.
---
Sell for most caps kinda.. takes farming the materials need for the serums just to sell a little more work but pretty nice since you can sell them to vendors also. I've seen more people buy recipes as they don't like farming mats
---
Hi I think I found the house but how do you access the attic?
---
No I want you to shut your ass up so I can sleep. Maybe you should have a carrot so you can spew crap insults for another  8 hours. Okay Im done here your demented and have an ego so large it makes the universe look like an ant. Goodnight, don't let the trollers fight
---
Started teaming up in nuke zones with randos. Worked well for all involved as we got to share perk cards and Rad Sponge, as well as having a way back in if we got disconnected. 
---
Don't get any funny ideas now
---
I don't even know how these threads even got split
---
Hey man thanks I’ve set up shop at this house and loving it so far. Just one question - how did you get up into the attic, I see the space but I can’t jump that high, don’t see a way up, and can’t build anything tall enough to climb on. 
---
Xbox one - Francescollo17   
---
Bug? When I use PA I can't see "bee swarm". They are invisibile and I only can see the red cross of my scope when I hit them  
---
The challenge "learn 76 recipes" remains 3/76 even if I've learned at least 25-30 recipes.  
---
So about that carrot ...
---
You know it's not a real carrot, right? You can't actually eat it.
---
Would be a nice addition, can complete my kitchen if they add one
---
Serums now are being sold for 100-150 caps on all platforms. 
---
It is just easier to pay a few hundred caps for the serums you want and lock them in with starched genes. 
---
It would take you less time to farm the caps you spend back in game, than it would take to farm the mutations yourself by praying to RNGesus. 
---
Not being two shot or max level I dont think they would have been very sought after, actually. This game has enough explosive shotguns anyhow. 
---
You split them.
---
Once again, you're pretty _un-_self-aware.
---
Speaking of carrots, take a real one and shove it up your ass goodnight mam
---
And this is waste land 
---
Don't ruin it
---
Oh hey I literally just had that happen
---
Absolutely, and a bonus effect sometimes is less lag when there’s less ground enemies too so it’s win/win 👍
---
That escalated weirdly 
---
May I note that you start by writing we don't need new mechanics or balance, and conclude with a wish for new mechanics and balance ?
---
Yeah can’t do the « Complete Events or Quests in a group » challenge cuz i have no friends.    :/
---
it's a one way fun - I don't play in team, I don't play PVP, I "use" other players strictly for trades, I've never done anything to others property and would like others to not destroy mine. If you think that they just play the game, so why don't they think other's, who don't want to PVP, also want to play the game their's way? Trolls and griefers are very polite names for those dumbshits and assholes, who destroys someones else properties.
---
That would be sweet! Add some poker tables and black jack. It would give us something fun to do at the base with our friends!
---
Honestly, my brain is running with this idea. I want a jukebox with options, smokeable cigars, and a whole slew of gambling attire. 
---
as much as i would enjoy renaming weapons, it would destroy any kind of market. you could just name something “Two Shot etc etc” and you would never really know what you’re getting. 
---
For the first time since this game was announced, I kind of want to try it now.
---
Gutsy ? I'm gonna say gutsy. Those things could drop the friggin SBQ..
---
Why do you even make a build for TSE?
---
It kills in one/two hit...
---
Binoculars? But... but how? 
---
Go to golf club
---
Kill everything
---
Server hop
---
Repeat
---
I like the idea, but people'd be like "Ohahhahdsh they're just trtying to get off on NEW VEGAS HOLY NAME"   
---
^(i want the ranger armour tho)
---
Low level explosive weapons are actually MUCH more valuable on the market currently. 
---
People will pay huge caps to get lower leveled explosive weapons so they can level their alts quicker. 
---
it was about seeing other people inventory during trade, which was intended, that is all.
---
Did that quest yesterday, most intense Fallout moment I ever had ! I was praying that the servers wouldn't crash though...
---
Way more crashing but once I hit a stable world no problems. My buddy on the other hand would get booted every five minutes in the same world...so yeah 
---
Curiosity maybe but at level 10 I imagine it’s suicide without a team around them to dish out stimpacks etc but I know what you mean about Lewisburg, the station seems to really attract scorchbeasts and it never seems to be just the one lol
---
Well... the best part of the live action trailer \*was\* the girl with the twin SMGs and the grin, thus i support this. 
---
And server hop is just going to main menu and back?
---
graveyard shifts suck, you don't need to tell me lmao
---
Agreed, some daylies are really hard, the lvl up is one of those, more now that they nerf xp on whitespring. So you are left to earn 30-40 atoms a day :/
---
Xbox have to re equip power armor pieces every time I enter power armor or fast travel
---
That happens depending on how I place the crafting station. If I don’t leave room for it to zoom out. 
---
Either to main menu and play or join a friend
---
Usually close to vendors in watoga  but one time i hard crashed in nuke zone in harpers ferry
---
I have school tomorrow and this one guy refuses to shut up lol
---
From what I understand it's the health they will regen back if you stop applying damage to them.
---
We get the same as players. Haven't taken enough notice to see if it relates to particular damage types 🙄
---
Easier to do it with a few friends! First attempt robots where all high level (50) and never came across any turrets. Tried again with only a fast travel back to camp to pick up my last rad-aways and stimpack. Robots seemed mostly lower levels (30's)  with only a few high levels, but seemed every turret was now activated (reason i was reduced to rifle butting them). Only tip i can give is when you have to repair or replace the panels. If your replacing, then they are all mostly in that big warehouse room with the computer that needs repairing. Wasted so much ammo hunting around killing the spawns not realizing they are in sneaky places around that room! Why its good with a friend! They can deal with the spawns while you turn on your lights and look for them.    
---
It's essentially a random system, so for a given population of players there's a distribution of quality*count of legendary weapons, for which a median can be calculated. If the amount of legendary weapon rolls or the proportion of three-star legendaries is increased from the intended one (by farming reliable sources of high-quality enemies) the expected amount of high-quality weapons for the typical player (median gear distribution) skews to the right.
---
Watoga high school’s event “the monster mash” is a good way to level its in the cranberry bog. It’s three long waves of endless ghouls not amazing experience per kill but there are a lot of them and you can server hop if your into that kinda thing or you can capture multiple workshops in your recommended level area after you have two or three you will constantly have a defense event for one of them offering multiple waves of mostly decent enemies to farm for exp. and the added bonus of the loot from those extractors that’s what I personally like to do but most people will recommend server hopping cause it’s the most effective but I don’t enjoy that way personally.  
---
"Ohh look, rad storm is coming"
---
...and no one gives a sh#t, because it doesn't effect you at all.
---
Really? I've never traded anything or been on the market and dont need caps for anything besides fast traveling. I prefer finding my gear. Much more rewarding. 
---
You legit have 0 hp on the picture
---
If they do add more ways, they’ll need the current rewards from dailies and other challenges. The whole point of the atom shop is to find the future of the game and make a profit as well. They can’t do that if they make it possible to get everything a person wants for free.
---
Ignore it? If your old enough to be here, you must be old enough to walk away right? I can't go to bed, so I'm not. You do, but you can't handle ignoring reddit so you aren't. Who is the one being foolish here then?
---
Its effects (both DR and special) stop applying, yes.
---
Yes, please. 
---
I'd really like to know what I don't know yet
---
Or worldwide leaderboard for Nuka Tapper
---
Yeah maybe not more ways but they need to reward more points maybe 20-30 per daily challenge depending on difficulty for example the level up one takes a lot of time for me (lvl 210) it should reward 30 atoms not 10
---
Yep, really. 
---
Shhhh. The first rule about Jetpack is we don't talk about Jetpack.
---
Second rule is...
---
 X-01 Jetpack can only be found in the secret brahmin level. It is dropped by Baron Brahmin the Bastard. He wields the best weapon in the game.
---
The Gatling Fatman.
---
Aren’t they account-wide?
---
Make alt characters ;)
---
do an event/quest and before it ends just invite any random person in your server, even if he doesn't accept your invite , it will progress your challenge.  
---
As long as the event /quest ends before the " XXXX declined your invitation" message pops.
---
That’s the whole idea of the atom shop make it easy for new players to get a ton of atoms get them addicted to buying stuff and playing the game then when your invested in your character you run out of atom points and then will buy them that’s their goal is to make money. 
---
I’d like that. I’d also like the option to gamble weapons and armor, meds etc.
---
Really? Boi i’ll try that out
---
This is basic microtransaction business model : The point is to goad you into using dollars for impulse buying, not to allow you to buy all the stuff  by simply playing the game.
---
Just have a friend help you get them. Takes less than an hour.
---
Go to Whitesprings Golf Course, kill everything.
---
Go to Harpers Ferry, kill everything.
---
Go to Watoga High School in the event called Monster Mash, kill everything.
---
Server hop, repeat.
---
These are highish level places, maybe to high for you but if you pull it off, you get some good XP and loot.
---
Only because Chemist guarantees the output will be double after the calculations.
---
I'm damn confident they planned on selling them for Atoms before quickly changing their minds. 
---
That would be my worst nightmare, I’ve disconnected a couple of times just after launching but fortunately so far not during the fight itself, hoping these updates really do bring better stability so I haven’t got the worry of that in the back of my mind every time
---
Nah man your not a douche, you hit the nail on the head there though we are all vault dwellers the enemies are the NPCs of the game super mutants scorched and all the other enemies in the game, if we want to pvp then the option is there we can have a little fun testing each others skills an what not, i play solo myself most of the time i actually enjoy it i can get more done that way but when another player comes along and wants to team up or help to me thats a huge bonus an a big part of bethdesdas long term goal to bring the fallout fans together.
---
Yes, it's hidden. But find able 
---
Search the sub for "ban" and sort by new. There has been an influx of reports. We'll see how this goes
---
I wish Bethesda would super nerf explosive weapons or remove them altogether... because I don’t have the strength of will you have xD 
---
And not having these weapons while others do, puts you at an disadvantage both in events/nuke zones and in pvp
---
Black Mountain Ordance Works, west of Valt 76. You need a key, I think from one of the mines in the Ash Heap.
---
I hate rad storms, waste of time and just an annoyance 
---
^ This please 🙏
---
Maybe I'll remove one rank for pistols and rifles giving me there to put towards adrenaline
---
Just happened to me on PS4 as well. This is after I already had to do a complete reinstall last night due to another error message. This game is utter trash
---
disappointing 
---
As far as I know, the only way to unintentionally dupe anything only duped CAMP stuff, not weapons or other items.
---
fanboys will always justify every mistake, no matter what
---
Something that helps vs whatever it is that SB's dump all over you in their napalm airstrikes would be nice.     
---
    
---
Not sure if its poison or acid.     
---
do expand on it
---
I completely agree with you. It really would be nice to have the option to rejoin the server from which I was just disconnected. However, that's not a lie on Todd's part. 
---
the sheer amount of people who popped up all at once, over and over, with accounts made less than 25 hours of them posting it, and the fact that none of them had any proof when it is stupid as fuck easy to record game play these days (literally just two button presses on both consoles) is all it took for me to go "yeah..." 
---
woah
---
Do you have the stats for that or are you just guessing? 
---
I have had a very similar experience! 
---

---
Same happened to me and a loads of guys yesterday. Spinning icon on the corpse then poof gone. Annoying as hell.
---
I'm gonna ignore the blatant, unjustified hate towards Fallout 4 and say how stupid it would be to have a Fallout game with that aesthetic. No more nice environments, no more enjoyable exploring, no more diversity. Although I suppose it would run on anything since the game wouldn't have to render anything past 10m from the player because of the **constant fucking rad fog**.
---
From the couple of you tubers I’ve seen talk about it they seem to think having anything on your account from the dev room is a perm-a account ban not even a character but full account I’m not sure if they would let it slide because then every one could say well I didn’t know and then things get complicated. 
---
yeah got it after the mission
---
Hmmmm hard to say as there is no evidence so to speak of people like you getting banned for having an item that is unreleased and you didn't know. 
---
I'd say they will just remove it somehow. Chin up friend
---
buy the game again 
---
me likes eating foid
---
Jokes aside, this is a great idea and needs to be implemented. I'm constantly starving because any meat I get either rots before I manage to cook it or in my inventory while cooked
---
That still seems off to me. For instance, I unload a full clip of a .50 on the queens face, I see maybe 5% of the bar slowly declining in grey. When I stop to reload, it stays the same from when I started.
---
I dont care about the PVP, but nuke zones gonna be real hard, yes. But thats how they are supposed to be, no? People have fun in different ways, I guess. Tried farming whitesprings and it went just fine with the ordinary rifles. Hoards of bloated gonna be real tough. Probably too much without at least an instigating weapon. I dunno. It will be what it will be. 
---
This !
---
I sure do hope for it.
---
The only "evidence" is Bethesda Polish account.
---
Now it is. Its like fishing. You request supply drop near populated area, then sneak onto great position and watch how people take the bate. Once the prey takes the bate, shoot them. Because now taking someones else drop, makes them wanted. Finally something cool to do in F76.
---
I love The Dragon too, recently got an explosive, instigating one from nuked whitesprings. Reload speed is a big draw back though.
---
eh. it's somewhat cheap at this point anyway.
---
Yeah as much as I’d want the extra damage the RP of the build/believability of it is why this one doesn’t have mutations. There’s no reason enhanced muscles would have you hit harder and jump higher in armor that weighs hundreds of pounds. My super Soldier unarmed build is awesome with his mutations.
---
For now, I'd recommend taking the resort exit. It skips a load screen and when going down the stairs  you can jump down the railing onto another part  of the stairs to avoid fall damage. You can get there a bit faster.
---
People say it's slower but I disagree. Open world loading screens take forever. Room loading screens take less time. 
---
I find the golf course is usually full of enemies well above my pay grade (I'm lvl28) didnt used to be but now I just get my ass kicked over and over does my head in
---
Just speculation...
---
I feel as if bgs added load times to slow down server hopping. Just speculation mind you
---
Guys, is there anything interesting lore-wise on the terminals in the AMS building in the room full of super OP explosive turrets that spam you? It's the one all the way at the top I believe.
---
Want to know if it's worth it to clear them and explore that room properly.  
---
Please don't spoil anything in the answers (a simple yes or no or a tip on disabling them without being harassed is enough)
---
Well that would be ridiculous, can't they just remove the ability from my account ?
---
I had a guy give me a whole set of T-45 PA with a Jetpack, it was unreal.
---
I once stumbled upon a glitched queen fight just next to Watoga train station. I couldn't see anybody hiding but the 8+ people where not shooting at her while in air for some reason. I wasn't prepared but I knew leaving would still have her resistances up. I fired my 900 5mm from my Gatling at her, which made me her primary target for the rest of the fight. It took 6 landings and about 5 more minutes to kill her.
---
(On a sidenote, I was using Stabilized 3 and each of the Heavy Gunner 1 perks, Adrenaline 1, 1\* Vampiric Gatling with 200 range and speedy receiver. It felt I made progress dwindling her health. I've noticed that when I modded my Gatling to 200 range before, Scorchbeasts became easier to damage in air. I'm not sure about the queen, but I'd guess most SBs are in the 100-200 range away from you and most guns don't have that range, losing damage.)
---
For me, nah. But I’m sure some players would enjoy
---
I want an update.
---
Got two from Flatwoods.
---
This happened for me the other day but I was lucky and was able to find the meat pile 
---
if its the traveling vendor bot your looking for i know of another spot it spawns in just north of Morgantown station, just got to follow the tracks north past the first set of train cars and has the same spawn rate as the one by Charleston station
---
Absolutely i think some of the unique weapons from the other fallouts should come back to. Like the Righteous Authority or the Bozar.
---
Yeah yeah i know ''LORE IMPLICATIONS'' But who cares? its an MMORPG.
---
When I first heard news of this game I assumed it was a normal fallout game but with a borderlands style co-op that’s what I wanted and I think every one wanted but sadly they must have thought this route would be more profitable. I too refuse to recommend it to my friends because I know they will be disappointed and get a bad first opinion of the franchise. With that being said I still enjoy the game with over 270 hrs played including beta playtime and the most fun I have is through meeting other players and the community that has built up around it. If this game was a non fallout game it would have crashed and burned way more but the fan base is too die hard and is keeping this game alive not Bethesda
---
&gt;cently "in game time" it'll show as empty. The game like remembers the last 50 or so (random number, not exactly sure how many) containers you looted and they'll stay empty until they get knocked off the "recent" list.  
---
&gt;Meanwhile locked/unlocked status is tracked by server. So if you unlock something, loot it, change server, it'll probably be locked but still empty.
---
I didn't play for two to three days.
---
Had a discussion about this and my experience on running servers for over a decade, I was using said experience to explain that the devs know exactly who's doing what, when and others who may be involved.
---
Anyway, the tl;dr of it is this random dude turns up and ultimately said I knew nothing and stated my information was "pulled out of my ass".
---
If that person is reading this post... Hi &lt;3
---
Same issue - PS4. Even closing out application completely and reloading same. 
---
That's it. Done.
---

But, yeah, do that to negate some of the shitty passive cards
---
Maybe you will be lucky but it looks like they are making an example out of people. To discourage this kind of behavior from their players instead of fixing the issues 
---
I agree for unique, but not for legendary as that will invalidate any perks tied to durability
---
Agreed. The laser rifle sucks even when it has the TSE legendary effects, it’s shameful really
---
I think people complain about getting one-shot through slap damage because if you're on the receiving end of it the guy outside of the claim circle is white named not red (I don't claim workshops much anymore so don't quote me on this but it's what my friend was saying happens as he's usually the one that claims them) BUT if you're on a team with someone it's happening to the guy doesn't turn red for you even in the circle unless you strike first which involves turning off pacifist mode as you can't hurt them if they're white named but they can kill you. It's an issue with the hostile player markers that I've only seen when they do the workshop thingy. 
---
This is just from personal experience dealing with people doing this to my team but it seems the main issue is that they don't show up hostile to the victim when really they should. Maybe others can back me up on this since I'm still one of the lucky few who gets stuck in their power armor even after the Jan 10 patch so it could be another annoying bug I get. 
---
As far as I'm concerned you can't accidentally claim someone's workshop so if you even try to claim it you should appear hostile to the whole team and be a red dot on the map when not sneaking until you leave server; turn it around on them so you can hunt them for a change and an enemy system would be a neat addition. Someone steals your shop they're a raider and you should be able to fight them on equal grounds; they beat you well block them and move on but at least it's not a matter of getting blindsided you can see them red named and coming for you. 
---
Eh, there's already perks for the sole purpose of slowing degradation. I like the idea of people investing in these perks being rewarded for it.
---
If it moves kill it! If it stops moving and you can cook it, cook it! On weekends when i have longer sessions because of real life (Job, Wife, Beagle). I fast travel to vault 76 and will do a half circuit of the map. Heading west till the river then heading either north or south and then circle around to my camp in Cranberry Bog. Stopping at locations, killing and scavenging for scrap (to sell on the way) and resources (plans, stims, rads, ammo). Sometimes getting way off the beaten track and enjoying the random encounters and AI battles i witness. Sometimes helping other players, other times just sneaking into their camps for a look. Don't rush to level up or just farm for better equipment. Enjoy the game its a lot of fun and its surprising how quickly you level up and find great stuff once you stop caring about it!    
---
?
---
That's what you get, trading with ppl who have probably duped weps.
---
Same issue - PS4. The second loading screen, audio pop, then just HUD with black screen. Doesn't fix if I fast travel to another location. Have to exit power amour, reboot game. It happens again as soon as I try to fast travel to Harper's Ferry.
---
the way they have earning atoms is the only right thing they have done in the game...problem is they barely have anything to spend them on. most other games with similar systems usually have tons of things to spend the currency on so people use it up within a month or 2 in order to try to get them to then buy the currency.
---
i havent spent any atoms cause nothing interests me...yet but once im out of atoms i wont be buying any, ill just play the game and earn more. im the kind of player they should be wanting...the kind that keeps playing but they really only want whales who spend tons of money for the ingame currency to buy the shop items....but they messed that up with how little selection they have.
---
Might just delete your character if they even figure it out. I saw someone saying that entering the dev room is what is getting people found out and banned. Not that they took items. But I/they could be wrong .
---
&gt; Call for help
---
Do you have he hardened receiver mod for the lever and perks to buff rifle damage? That seems pretty low. iirc my non legendary lever did 197ish
---
honestly, I would recommend doing the mistress of mysteries quest or just explore the map. You're new to the game don't rush to 50 and just enjoy the game.
---
Alll the fucking time
---
Fast travel to whatever location you're at
---
Will reapply them
---
You can also go to apparel and reequip in there
---
I use a maxed out Sun Kissed Perk, never have to use a Radaway, even with both Rad Worms and Glowing Pustules. I let the worms and glowiness run it's course all the time. Usually use the sulphur fountain to just get water or to remove the more severe diseases.
---
What makes you think they’ll ban that many people?  On what grounds?  Simply having duped items in their inventory?  Unintentionally duping an item (there are rare cases where it is in fact unintentional). 
---
Its certainly more frustrating to play recently.   
---
Haha, i'm level 170 with more than 300 hours on one character. 
---
Even in a game like ark, where dinosaurs have item ID's, people just paint over the id and block it out. You would need to buy an item from a seller and then meet with them in game. And even then, word would get around and people would use alt accounts. It's impossible, really. 
---
If this is true, i gonna try it again. 
---
Cuz i got a few tickets on me but i couldnt finish the quest
---
That is true but there is a greater influx of base weapons than legendary/unique weapons so the perks would still be rewarding since you are probably not using a legendary weapons 100% of the time in the first place.
---
From Bethesda’s perspective all the duper’s and exploiters are causing the players to have a bad experience not the poor game design so if they put the ban hammer down they think it will earn them brownie points and bring people back. They only care about people who spend money duper’s and people who break into the dev room to take new items are not buying them from the atomic shop and make them look bad. Easy solution perms ban. You have to think it anotnof from the money perspective they only care about the 35% that spend money. And will do whatever they say 
---
Uh no. In fact, some legendaries should have increased degradation as a balance to their significant advantages over regular versions. I’m looking at you TSEs.
---
And this is said as a user of said weapons. 
---
Agreed. Maybe an unbreakable/almost unbreakable legendary effect as an alternative too.
---
Spawning at the bottom again?
---
&gt;Simply having duped items in their inventory?
---
according to the rumors, yes. I've only read about it here though. but this sub kinda is the fastest way to get news on the game at this point, so idk.
---
The AMR was the best weapon ever because of how busted it was loved it on all occasions 
---
Killed the SBQ for the first time last night, got decom shower and 2 ultracite plans. Sucks you got nothing, the SBQ is a real ammo sink too. I broke 2 guns and a sword fighting her and ended up trying to punch it out whilst everyone else shot it to bits. 
---
Lol wait do you actually think thats steve carrell
---
I love helping people out, whenever I'm bored or don't feel like grinding anything I'll go griefer hunting (annoyingly, I find most at Flatwoods... Picking on fresh dwellers) and kit out the low levels with the best weapons they can use along with a few caps and whatever spare plans/recipes I have.
---
Every so often it gets annoying as it'll result in a squeaker following me about for a while but for the most part people just show their appreciation.
---
Is there not a mod for the plasma rifle that makes it akin to a shotgun?
---
already sort of exists for armor with the +50% durability affix
---
I have about 50 of these. You get better loot if you use the relay tower near the bottom of the map by the Bog.
---
It’s no basis for a system of government! 😂
---
I’ve also seen here that Bethesda has admitted to being unable to track items. As such, I can’t see how they’d do so unless they just went and banned everyone using commonly duped weapons and have traded with a known duper (though I don’t see how they’d know if that interaction occurred). 
---
I've had this happen twice now. Both times it was when I pulled up my Pipboy before giving the game a chance to really load in. I could fast travel and open the map but that was about it.
---
Thanks, gotta give it a try. Yes, The VATS system sometimes glitches. But it seems with a gauss it happens more often. But it's definitely not the AP - I  had a full bar. Indeed it must be the line of sight - all those mole miners move and the view bwcomes obstructed.
---
Damn blowing up someones house because they dont play the game like you want them too? And besides, the missle turrets dont one hit the ghouls there anyway.
---
First of all, from what I've heard they can't see your inventories since it's client side.
---
Secondly, they wouldn't ban everyone with duped items. They would either alter the explosive affix or, if they were capable of finding duped weapons, delete them.
---
Stop worrying.
---
like I said, I've only read about it here thus far. so it *could* be have been orchestrated.
---
after defending Bethesda on the canvas bag debacle, nothing this sub does will surprise me anymore.
---
Afaik it’s the damage currently being inflicted on an enemy. 
---
Problem is, the zero damage bug causes it to immediately revert back to where it started. 
---
"play Fallout 76 for 7600 hours" probably the most ridiculous challenge I've ever seen, I played GW2 fairly hardcore for multiple years and only cracked 3k hours.
---
I think this issue atm is not that there aren't enough methods to earn atoms, it's that they are in need of serious rebalancing
---
Hmm. Makes sense. Thanks.
---
My focus is mostly for weapons though.
---
More importantly, not have to chase them for 3/4 of the map while they run in fear. 
---
I’ve been digging through the comments and Bethesda is only hunting for the lunchboxes, paints, armors, and masks.  There has yet to be any concrete information on what they are doing about people who know the plans.  The masks they removed from inventories, and I suspect we will see them do something similar to the paints and helms.  As for the duped items, I think it’s just a side effect worry of the witch hunt currently going on.
---
Some people have been reaching out to Bethesda Support to explain their situation. You didn’t know it was an unreleased item, bought it at a vendor believing it was legit, and have no way to remove it from your account. Perhaps you going to them first will put you in good graces.
---
Repairing weapons and armor give you a reason to gather junk and a lot of people like to role play as a mechanic repairing/ modding weapons and stuff 
---
he is a QA trader as far as i know, like his sole duty is so they could test something to do with trading
---
99% of the active PvP players are never in Watoga etc because people their own level and over will probably flatten them, they go after the smaller people and often the same person repeatedly... Which is no longer PvP, it's griefing.
---
Check out Assassins Armor, if you get a full set and add fireproof and some of explosive negating perks you can equal PA
---
Do your turrets shoot into the golf club through the windows?  I’m guessing they don’t if you’re by a stream. 
---
It’s the trolls that set up directly behind the building, get a floor level with the windows, and then set up turrets to fire into the second floor trough the windows. 
---
LOL they should be much rarer, I think I have like 50 or more. People have stacks. 
---
Where is a correct one?  This is the best source I have found so far
---
I dig that. A big motivator behind my build was not trying to make myself some invincible juggernaut. I figured I’d become really good at one thing... backstabs. But if I get seen trying I could be toast in seconds if I’m not on my game, and even still my bag of “oh shit” tricks runs out fast. I also keep my carry weight at around 70 After a camp break and I try to loot only what I’ve marked as essential for basic repairs. I carry mostly diluted stims and food/water, and a few light unarmed weapons. I like the idea of creating my own game inside a game. Keeps the game interesting while we endgamers wait for new content. 
---
You can sell plans and i learned T-60 BoS knight one.
---
Which is supposedly from the dev room
---
I don't know.. Yesterday i bought two tse guns so i hope they don't think I'm duper because i like the game 
---
How the fuck could they ban u for having 2 different weapons?
---
I would say no need to worry my friend
---
you know you can put half walls down to prevent yourself walking off an edge. 
---
Canvas bag has absolutely nothing to do with the Dev team, bro. Completely off topic and a half ass insult to the redditors of this sub, of which, you are one, bud. Not to mention, I don't recall scores of people saying "NILON IS OK, GET OVER IT!" Whatever, you're just being petty.
---
Anyway, dupers are nasty people, willing to break rules to get ahead. Add in real money and you bring out the worst in people. This is likely a lie started by a duper to scare others out of the market. Easy as that. 
---
Yup, on PC I get the double Load screen almost every time there is a load screen. 
---
Well, in it's base it's a TSE handmade, one of them has different mods attached, but if they're banning people manually they might think that you just modded one of them to get away with duping.
---
He’s wasted on Xbox, this needs to be multi platform stuff.
---
theres no correct one yet I'm guessing, I know it's wrong since it says jetpack and stealthboy for excavator
---
Only they know for sure, but I'd be kind of surprised if they banned for one unlocked paint which can't be discarded.
---
The power armor paint was a plan that was stolen from the dev room dupped and then sold to tons of people a lot of people found out too late. I find it hard to believe they will just let you keep it cause you “didn’t know” you can only buy t from other players plans cannot be sold to vendors and only set plans can be bought from the vendors. This paint plan will more than likely get your character banned at the least account suspended at worst 
---
Only issue I have with that is why have an NPC model for trading when any robot will do?
---
Ah right ok. I'm still getting a guaranteed blue screen in watoga but not anywhere else. Although we did get a full server disconnect at prime last night. This is a huge issue for us and I can't seem to find anything about Bethesda fixing this or even acknowledging that it's happening??
---
&gt;Canvas bag has absolutely nothing to do with the Dev team, bro.
---
and what you said has absolutely nothing to do with what I said, *bro*. I wasn't pointing a finger at the developers, but rather at the people in this sub who'll blindly defend with tooth and nail anything Fo76-related.
---
&gt;Not to mention, I don't recall scores of people saying "NILON IS OK, GET OVER IT!"
---
that's exactly what they said. multiple times.
---
&gt;This is likely a lie started by a duper to scare others out of the market. Easy as that.
---
...that sounds like an awfully contrived and honestly stupid plan. they'd just unload their stock at a discount. cashing in before getting banned.
---
No, you did not wandered out of topic. This is the essence of the topic. RNG as a method of progression in online game is not enough, and we undisputably need legendary crafting, this way or another. Im a genius general world-saver inventor in-game. It is nust unacceptable that I can build what I already built, yet the best gear in game must be dumped down by dead enemies because apparently living humans cannot create good gear. This is such an immersiom breaker that it has to be resolved. Im okay that they did not implemented it in first phase of the game. Ill be mad if they don't implement that ever.
---
Because the engine can do it, theres nothing preventing them from having alive humans in the world, it just doesnt fit the narrative they are going for, so what does it matter if they use humans and/or robots in their test levels. They use a mix QASmoke has a human vendor, 76QASmoke has robot vendors
---
&gt;they can't see your inventories since it's client side
---
That hasn't been true in online game since the 90s. The inventory is obviously stored on the server, or else you could just edit your save file and give your character every item in the game.
---
The ATF is displeased with your ''boating accident''
---
1)What platform are you playing on?
---
PC  win10  network: China mobile, use vpn connect to japan
---
2) Gamertag:  50382  ; Bethesda.net account: wuwuwu

4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
can't move after log in,can't quit the power armor  can transfer to other location or be killed but still can't  move after that.
---
i have reinstalled the game, but the problem is still there.
---
i was used Known Plans Mod and ShowHealth mod from nexusmods before the problem.
---
You do know there is almost certainty those were duped in the first place, right? But no, people won't get trouble for simply having the dupes in their inventory. They will get banned if they are caught actively duping though.
---
Yeah, I'll pay more attention next time. I do seem to remember that if I delay too long before hitting it again or get diverted onto another target, it regens back to the top of the grey.
---
Have tried a Google search but there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer there either - some say it's your damage and others that it's DOT damage.
---
Will be interested to hear the correct answer 😊
---
i like to use the small wooden fence when the view is nice 
---
Yup as soon as he mentioned the scrip and the private detectives Finkton was the first thing that popped into my mind!
---
Wait, wait wait. Borderlands? Guaranteed good drops?
---
You must have played a completely different game than me. I spent hours farming before I got a good Hornet. 
---
Probably Marsupial Mutation 
---
They might use him for testing new animations/poses. I think there should be a female NPC model in there for that as well.
---
Asking for a friend ?
---
Quick question, are you a duper?
---
ur looking too deep into it, there are other test rooms for that, there is one with about 20 or so human NPCs, male and female in all the different armors available.
---
I wanted to do something similar but, luckily for me, it was with the Weightless armour. I wanted to trial the chameleon mutation and from what I can tell it masks you completely from view compared to chameleon tagged armour which leaves the slight light bending effect. 400 extra stash would be immense right now and that's such a sad thing to say because that would still only be 1k stash total. 
---
Frezz that meat, boiii
---
Nope, for myself, i have a TSE Double Barrel i use and TSE Double Barrel i bought recently which i wanted to use in a trade for a rare outfit.
---
If they had the ability to track items they would have stopped duping in it's tracks. Crafting goes through the server, same with picking up planted items: think how we used to server hop for scrap, now we don't because it registers when our account grabs the scrap. 
---
This is how they track who has been in the dev room, by what they picked up down there. This is also how they send out emails saying "looks like this account has been duping," because people would continually craft until they DC'd. The server catches all this information. It's one reason why crafting can be so laggy. It has to verify with the server. 
---
The current hunt is not for duped weapons, it’s for plans and items that aren’t supposed to be in game yet.  If you have the faschnacht(sp) masks, BOS paint plans, or marine armor helmet you may get flagged.  No word yet on if you know how to make the items, guess we will wait and see.
---
Lol how could it be client side, we would just edit anything in there...did you even think before posting this ?!
---
I'd also like unlimited grenades and an unkillable  pet attack helicopter/vertibird
---
That is a much more concise way of putting it. I ended up waffling on for far too long when you summed it up much better. I hate mobile games that pull this crap and here we have a full priced release from a supposed AAA developer pulling it. Login for your daily play, do your Atom tasks, sell your loot, logout for the day.
---
I fail to understand the relevance of that question. if the rumors turn out to be true, a good chunk of the playerbase qualify as a "duper"
---
Been perfectly fine for me so far on pc. 
---
If they’re smart, they won’t be going after the guys who only dupe a couple times first. They’re small fish. It’s the guys with thousands of stacked legendaries/bobble heads/nuka-cola that they need to tackle first. They’re the low hanging fruit (they couldn’t be more obvious as dupers) and they also are the most prolific perpetrators. 
---
Then they can focus on the guys using the exploit a few times. Until then though, I can’t see them going after someone who simply has two of the same item in their inventory, even if they got the second one illegitimately. 
---
Yeah, that's what my recent posts are all about, i have a BoS T-60 knight paint learned and 2 TSE Double Barrels for different purposes.
---
Thanks for explaining this, my number got called but the game glitched and I never got the robots to say it was my turn. I spent about 30 minutes figuring out what I did wrong in that damned room. 
---
They already have the assets for it from the fo4 creation club item, they should definitely add it in
---
i have an open camp with an open junk harvester and water purifier. i drop random extra junk,ammo whatever for anyone to pick up while im on too. i want to get the letters so i can write a welcome message haha 
---
My team mate and I were there the other day, he’s like “heh frogs” pondering the wonders of the world. Meanwhile I’m booking it towards him “Q! I found my friends” hoard of ghouls follow 😂
---
it's relevant because when I click on your name and look at your posts, a lot of your stuff comes up in regards to duping recently. I don't care if you do or not, do whatever you want, just know you aren't slick lmao
---
I’m in the same boat on the paints, Paladin, I’m just waiting to see if it happens.  I traded a lot for the paint and my TSEs, I’d hate to lose it but it is what it is.
---
it is also so bloody long going one side to the other it is literally so accurate

I use an external SSD on an Xbox One and get around 10 - 20 seconds depending on what I'm loading. 
---
&gt;just know you aren't slick lmao
---
not trying to be
---
I have never seen antibiotics in this game... Do they spawn anywhere??
---
God the diseases in this game are gross... Rad Worms, Bone Worm, Sludge Lung.. Yuegh.
---
get me an explosive TSE handmade or i'll DM Todd Howard
---
I think all that Faschnaht stuff is from the dev room
---
yes, the gun explodes. 
---
Suppose they just add a hidden [unique id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) to each legendary that's generated, unmentioned in the patch notes. No two will ever have the same id, unless it was duplicated. No amount of modding or trading would cover it up.
---
Nope... And I watch a lot of them. 
---
I agree, take workshops. You’ll have to defend them every so often but they’ll be free to travel to once you claim them. Good way to get plans too. 
---
 You are a tiny minority?
---
  For some reason dupers console themselves by pretending everyone does it.
---
Tbh pacifist mode shouldnt have been a thing, too many people exploit it for an advantage, the best thing Bethesda could do is get rid of it entirely then everyone would be on the same playing field.
---
I'm not condoning people's actions when saying this, I don't go around destroying people's camps or killing ( unless they have a bounty) but I have seen first hand people using pacifist mode to unfairly take workshops when objectively they shouldn't be able to if pacifist modes enabled. 
---
Exactly, which is why this was initially downvoted. The comment adds zero contribution to the discussion. Maybe if he explained exactly what buggy broken part of the game he doesn't like or think should be fixed then there wouldn't be a problem. As it stands the comment just comes off as yet another whiny player hating on the game for no reason.
---
I had the same question.
---
If you hit a normal mob (like a ghoul) you'll see the gray appear. Damage someone else does only subtracts from the red.
---
By that logic it's the damage you're doing alone.
---
Someone could absolutely persuade me otherwise, though.
---
I don’t think he asked to keep the paint, and I didn’t suggest that either. In fact, my post was suggesting reaching out to Bethesda to explain how the plan was acquired. 
---
As of right now, it seems the people who actually entered the dev room are the ones getting instabanned. Those with the items are getting temp-bans, likely so that follow-up/more info can happen. The dupers put those dev room items out on the market for unsuspecting players, and Beth surely knows its not fair to punish people who didn’t know any better. (The ban email indicates “if you think this is an error, please email us at” or something to that effect.)
---
As far as I know: Bethesda is not looking for the individual one or two weapons. They are watching out for people that craft massive amounts of items (like planks) to disconnect from the server. 
---
You're starting an argument off of false info to, what, get people to pick a side and then call them fanboys if they agree with banning duped-item-holding players? Pretty sad. 
---
It's already been established they can't track duped items or they would have banned duping players long ago. They track dev room items by the fact that they are picked up, like typewriters we used to server hop for, these are server side and tracked. They ban dupers by seeing how much they crafted, since this goes through the server as well, hence why crafting is so laggy. 
---
Also, it's not supid at all. More money is more money. Caps or otherwise. It's easy to hide the important info in an ebay post. If someone really wants to spend 5 bucks to catch a duper, they'll be reporting an alt account anyway. And that account likely has 1/20th of his stockpile. 
---
yeah
---
Big Fallout fan and had it since launch (£32 on CD-Keys). Am running it on a i7 4790k, 16gb, with a GTX 1070 at 1440k. Am looking at 71/fps on ultra with a gsync monitor.
---
The game still has issues, but it was and never been no where near how the game media made it out to be. Really enjoying it, i can see this being my go to game for at least the next 12 months.
---
I think it's basically not a massive deal. Harper's Ferry doesn't have one either. Nor the super shop thing in Watoga... thats not far from the station to be fair but Whitesprings is right out the back entrance to the bunker too.
---
When I do my daily vendor run I make sure to pull out enough from stash for the next vendor before I fast travel.
---
For clarity: I'm not saying "*Don't do it*", I'm saying "*Yeah, suppose so but do more important stuff first*".
---
I can verify with a week long ticket they have no ability to track a item if lost due to various glitches. So I'm assuming if that's the case they can not verify the authenticity of existing items other than people having a unreasonable amount of said item. So to me it seems duping is. Not something their willing to admit they can or can not fix. Or frankly predicted this could or would happen and still released the game.
---
I pray I'm wrong but that also makes even more sense that vendors have very low cap amounts, and their is no real in game market such as a auction house or etc.
---
Once again I do hope they have a fix because it's truly breaks the game in various ways from performance to legitimatcy of a players game play and progression.
---
And really can you imagine how raids or dungeons would be structured with the current state of the game because their is no real way to tune or make balanced encounters. And walking into a vault where every one has TSE whatever's seems lame.
---
Oh nope, don’t do anything like that. That does seem like a dick move
---
Your thinking of the m249. The m240b  actually weighs more like 25 pounds 
---
id just be happy if they separated food/drinks from chems in the pip:&lt; 
---
Yo, have [a pretty good PBS documentary about the West Virginia coal wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNgUTrD31_U)
---
I'll give it a try. I was running a the Fallout76Custom.ini that didnt include the gsynch but was on borderless. I decided to disable it in Fallout76Prefs.ini as well, as I realized it was still on. I will give it a try and see if it helps much. Thanks
---
Only the right arm not applied? Damn, it's gonna give me an awful itch. Plz Bethesda
---
Thanks for your work OP. Some people really like to bullshit just for fun.  
---
I'm a bit late, but there's another kind of misinformation in this subreddit too. It's minor compared to OP issues, and really just dumb. I'm talking about people giving wrong information to legitimate simple questions.  
---
One example: in a recent thread about CAMP building, someone asked if we can wire the Electrical Chair. Well, someone not only answered positively (it's wrong), but then added that it sparkles when wired...
---
As they said, it doesn't matter how much time passes in real life it is supposedly based on activity in game. I can not confirm this though.
---
I’d like to see a spiral staircase
---
When the plant is powered up. 
---
Gonna try it right now.
---
I have experienced this on the xbone as well. A lot. Bunch of different quests.
---
Well hopefully it all gets sorted I almost made the same mistake some random guy wanted to know if I wanted to buy that paint set cause he was wearing it and I thought it was awesome looking but luckily I remembered it from a YouTube video and thought I’d better not I’m glad I decided against it because even if they just take it away the hassle dealing with customer support is more than I’d like to deal with especially if people are receiving temp bans already 
---
Since i got my explosive pipe-action(s) the game has been easy mode for me as well. The only that really killed me was myself in the explosive blast. 
---
Saying, “I wanna role play as a raider” is an excuse for dicks in this sub to justify their actions and grief. At least in this sub, the people that post this really are dicks.
---
Is it needed, no not really. Does it make your explosive shotgun a sniper rifle, yeah it does. 
---
Why? All it does is limit your own ability to damage players. It doesn't make you immune.
---
Screen shot the message and report them for griefing
---
Did you use a piercing magazine for the hunting rifle? 
---
IIRC the lever action doesn't come with any armor piercing options so that is likely the difference.
---
While they *could* do that, do keep in mind that BGS did not develop fallout: New Vegas, and frankly they seem maybe a bit jealous that Obsidian's fallout game is generally better liked than any of BGS' - they're not likely to harken too strongly to a title that they didn't develop themselves, if only out of professional jealousy. 
---
There aren’t already legendary pipe revolvers in-game?
---
Then they would have banned people holding 100's of TSE and millions of bobbleheads, long, long ago before it became an issue. If they've had the ability to track inventories, they essentially allowed this to happen and will now ban everyone for their mistake? **Sounds good if you're a Youtuber going for salty viewers on the hate train, tbh.** Banning everyone with duped items, after allowing it spread as it has makes absolutely no sense unless:
---
A. You are scaring people out of the market
---
B. You are the stupidest dev team in all of history.
---
Gonna go ahead and say it likely started as A and now people are just scared and not thinking this through.
---
We all know they will either fix the explosive affix or up the item cap to deal with the saturated market. 
---
Also, I would rather get to the bottom of this rather than "he said she said" bullshit. I recall seeing that Bethesda can't track our items. I'm gonna look for that crucial piece of evidence. 
---
I think there's both a shotgun and flamethrower option for plasma and laser gets a scatter shot.
---
However, all those options make durability degrade super fast, hence why op comment said 'usable' energy shotgun.
---
CHICKEN! COME BACK FUCKER!!!
---
No no no, stop that
---
Basically, having NPC's in vanilla would have made NPC's coming out of the vault a little lackluster. It's supposed to be a big thing when the vaults open. We might even get settlers for our camps or something.
---
Either that or they just used the code cuz it's there. Or have a hidden challenge associated with it cuz they know anyone down there will likely kill him. 
---
There is for heavy guns called stabilized, you just have to be in power armor to use it.
---
But, but my barrel-rolls. I'm famous for them. Darn.
---
We thought that was the case but found out it was bobblehead stackers immediately killing her when she spawned. Three nukes went off that day only got to the queen once in time to get a hit in before she was gone.
---
Can confirm this worked for me
---
Too true.
---
It reminds me of [Biwwy](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Biwwy), in that it kind of sounds like Ruby.
---
All you can confirm is they don't want to help you.
---
I did turn off gsynch and borderless, although I believe I was already running borderless on my custom. I now see past around 55 fps, but the micro stutters/lag/whatever you call it still exist.   I'm using fraps to monitor fps. I'm sitting in whitesprings not nuked and I am sitting still, and my frame rate goes from 44 to 13ish then back to 44.  Another thing I noted, when hearing explosions far off in the background I seem to get some spikes. 
---
Legendery pipe pistols are most definitely a thing i found one the same week the game came out and still use it (turned it into a rifle).
---
Was using it a bit last night and I'm pretty sure it doesn't benefit from any of the melee weapon perks sadly. Neither Gladiator nor Slugger increased its DMG and martial artist doesn't reduce its weight.
---
I think it's the same story for all V Fast melee weapons tbh, which is a shame.
---
Except it's not a mistake. It provides power to Boston.
---
maybe not the act of duping itself but duped equipment is now so widespread you may have one and don't even know about it.
---
sad part is they believe they are doing a service. fuckin nazis.
---
Yea, I guess that's going to be the route I take. 
---
Just a fraction of the dumbass shit people hear about the game and spread around whenever they get the chance.
---
you're assuming they're telling the truth, that they can't recover lost items.
---
a more realistic scenario is that they just don't care enough to.
---
Roughly the same play time and I've only ever had two. They're really impressive. And I wouldn't object is they did a bit more damage too.
---
On Conan Exiles they have sandstorms that periodically sweep parts of the map and they shred an unprotected player if they're caught in the open. It's interesting.
---
Don't or can't either way I don't really care I'll come back a few months from now and see how the game is doing then.
---
I'd be fine with that. Otherwise I just sell them to vendors.
---
&gt;Sounds good if you're a Youtuber going for salty viewers on the hate train, tbh.
---
see what I meant when I said people here will blindly defend the game?
---
I won't even bother replying your other post because you don't even know how servers work.
---
I'm a long-range gauss sniper so I use chameleon armor and Stealth Boys. My main advantage is killing the enemy before they can even locate me. I also use plenty of chems like calmex and usually hunt at night for bonus sneak attack damage.
---
Headshot critical sneak attack eliminates targets in one shot.
---
True, same could be said about duping
---
You know why some of us prefer to a run 4 man squad and kill her as fast as we can? Because people like to take their time getting to her then hide in the shed for the update, making the fight infinitely harder. 
---
Ditto. I assume I will have all diseases permanently and the rare occasions I don’t are like a nice Druid ran by and SOWed me. 
---
/drivebyeverquestreference
---
Oh dear.. I got given this plan and learned it. Didn’t realize it was out of the dev room. If I get banned over it I’m not going to be happy.
---
I agree. 3 stars creatures should drop 3 star items. Why even bother giving them stars if they just drop random stuff
---
This makes me think of those damn machine gun turret mark 7s
---
So as a player who has died many times without skeet shooter hip firing...
---
Yea it helps.
---
I actually did this on a friend on accident. It led to a lot of yelling and laughing.
---
The fact that you can encounter players who just want to kill you makes the kindness of other players much more meaningfull. 
---
Worked fine for me last night on xbox 
---
Yes. I always put on all my unyielding pieces and get health super low, then pop mentats. Iirc 30 int gets the full double bar when they craft anything
---
Sounds like a personal problem. 
---
Pacifist mode does not affect the damage you take.
---
Its only function is to prevent you from dealing damage to other players and/or their CAMPs.
---
I mean a general one for non-PA users as well.
---
Especially when the games goal is to nuke prime and watoga being the nearest place for vendors
---
Depends on if its two-shot or not. If its not you wont need skeeter. Skeeter is still good though. Gets so precise you can use it to shave 
---
I've never gotten the impression BGS are jealous of Obsidian. Fallout 3 is a genuinely solid game with a good story and a really great sense of atmosphere. New Vegas isn't perfect, it also has a number of problems. 
---
This should have more upvotes
---
Sounds rather stupid thing to do, not really going to believe that.
---
Read it again. 
---
Yeah gunpowder got me too!
---
Of course it does - it was made in 18 months on an engine developed by BGS.
---
Hi hi! Yes, Im on PC. I'm not too worried, I have an alt account.
---
Would you prefer caps? Or any plans you you may be interested in? Will have to log on my mule and see.
---
IGN: IronHandsX
---
Discord: IronHandsX #0795
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Dude, your CND is how much durability you gun/armor has. Stop trying to over complicate. 
---
I don't know how servers work, not ashamed of it. 
---
Using common sense is easy, here's a go:
---
Your post and this post say "Halp, am I gonna get banned for having a duped gun?"
---
This uses the assumption that Bethesda can track items by some sort of id number. So, why would they ban you, the measly guy that paid 5k caps or 5 bucks? Like the mafia or a drug cartel, they want to go after the guy at the top. 
---
So, if they are able to track items, why weren't dupers dealt with long ago? Why did they allow it to get to this point? Why do people have millions of bobbleheads and hundreds of two shot? Why do ban emails say something along the lines of "this account was crafting an insane amount and flagged for duplicating" and not "this account has hundreds of similar items and flagged for duplicating."
---
?????
---
Might not know shit about servers, but I got common sense. 
---
Or eldermaxon's battle coat would be nice as well 
---
But if they do come out it's probably going to be in the cursed A T O M S H O P
---
I'm hoping to get a dlc where you acces the capital wasteland, and is abig city, radiated, dangerous and full of ghouls
---
Dunno, but I know if they had the ability to track our items, duping would have never been an issue; therefore they can't track our items. Simple logic, forgive my technical ignorance. 
---
Edgy!
---
Why would you call other players merchants?
---
Go to the lumber mill top left of the map kill all the super mutants they are low level and give great exp
---
I don't even bother targeting legendaries anymore because I already know what it's gonna be! It's gonna be a piece of leather armor or some form of shit low lvl weapon with the exterminator or Hunter perk! Has anyone else found that ever since they said they "fixed" the legendary drop issue in one of the first updates it's actually got worse and worse as time goes on?
---
Yes. And after 50, you get to choose whether to move a point or get a new card. 
---
I’ve had it happen a couple times during quests so I’m taking a break I’m playing modded Skyrim now 
---
Respect. I like to RP build talent sets that are overtly without fighting prowess. Survival of the Wit-est (or Litest for my younger nooby friends. I’m old AF)
---
Egghead should stack imo. But yea at least that's one thing ok with high int.
---
Oh ok nevermind then, that's really neat 
---
I mean you continue to get the option to reallocate either a special point or choose another perk. 
---
If theres any good reason to kill a base it's those bases ..they directly interfere with other peoples gameplay 
---
Scrapper gives up to 66% more based on your INT
---
Hi mate, would you please be able to craft me a couple as well?
---
Happy to pay or trade caps/plans/junk/ammo.
---
Hopefully I’m not banned my mule was 5k overweight mainly weapons and power armor... I kept telling myself “eh I’ll use this later”
---
Spent two days server jumping for them. Still no luck...
---
Yep, happened to me too.
---
By EA doing a 180 do you mean bailing on any further single player patches and abandoning any planned DLC just five months after Andromeda's release? 
---
That's abandoning an entry in a hugely popular game franchise with a very dedicated fan base. Not working to make the game better, not even trying.
---
Just flat out abandoning it. Not even 6 months later. 
---
I pre-ordered Andromeda. I am one of those ME fans.... That was a far bigger screw job than the state 76 is in now and going forward because at the very least SOME new content is on the way. 
---
How is 76 worse than that? It's already received more substantial updates/patches and it's only 2 months old. 
---
Is it possible? Yes. But the odds of 2 X01-shocks on the same vendor at the same time? That's some "winning the lottery" levels of unlikely.
---
Having multiple of them fire on you at once is just pure pain...
---
It would be nice if some new DLC took you to an area that had a casino, I enjoyed it in foNV  ( that's when it didn't crash getting into the strip that is lol)
---
Converting caps and paper money into chips to gain more caps gambling or for weapons and armour 
---
Do the BOS Quest then Launch a nuke!
---
Yea I was selling a set of x01 powerarmor for 1k
---
“Forgot I had super duper on and my anal ability to complete sets kicked in.
---
So they guy asked for us to drop our items\caps at the same time to exchange them. As the guy hosting the trade I said “give me the caps first or no trade”
---
To be fair I showed him the set of power armor on the ground along with my vault tech set to show I did in fact have the set for sale.
---
He groaned a little bit gave me the caps and I dropped the power armor. He was pretty thrilled and told me he got scammed before.
---
It reminded me that even scammers exist in fallout.
---
I can launch a nuke solo and ank a nuke zone... with my 3* Vampires Cultist blade. It has 40% swing speed and +1 strength. The thing is with the health gain is it is  a few seconds regen, per hit. I swing insanely fast so am basically permanently regenerating health. Yes it can take a little longer to kill enemies, but not that much. In the time you have completed one swing with your big two handed weapon I have already stabbed the enemy 4-5 times and likely killed it, regained any damage taken and moved onto the next target. 
---
Well, to be honest, that website is lagging badly and bugging more. Try send password reset message, it arrives after few days or later. Then try to chance it, it wont update with new password after it says it did. Change settings, nope. Personal info, nope.
---
When finally got to send support ticket, it takes week time to get answer, and that answer is automated message that are not related to question in first place.
---
I did let go.
---
You could probably just walk that off.
---
XBox One: mtphrs
---
I just had the worst experience trying to play with my two brothers (one on XBO; one on One X).
---
Multiple (4+) server disconnects within an hour and a half--once or twice when claiming/defending Lakeside Cabins and several times when claiming/defending Monongah Power Station or running the Powering Up Monongah event. Swarms of enemies spawned in front of one of us in Monongah (the other two were a room away). Multiple times the game froze for one or all three of us (with or without a disconnect). On one server, the two of us on XBO (not X) were missing Rose's Syringer from our inventories (which we had been planning to use for Flavors of Mayhem); it came back when we tried another server.
---
In addition, several times over the last few days, the game has reported that my CAMP couldn't be placed, even though there were no other CAMPs in the vicinity. And the game has repeatedly disabled our controls because of difficulty communicating with the servers.
---
My brothers and I are all huge fans of the Fallout games, but we're rarely able to find time when the three of us can all play. (To illustrate, although we bought the game about a week after launch, we're still only around Level 25.) If those few opportunities are going to be marred by such a variety of problems as those we experienced tonight--which have made the game nigh unplayable for us--I'm not sure how much longer we'll keep trying.
---
Yas, Yas.... lets see those damn mole rats hide now!!!
---
Know the feeling, explosive-2shots are broken as hell even before you have the world-ending 2shot-explosive shotgun taken into account. Personally I now mainly use a 2-shot minigun with +25% rof, it feels very powerful, but not like I'm using a cheatcode like I do with 2shot-explosives.
---
And pick up a spare pair for the inevitable gear cap rise! 
---
Seen this happen twice now and one of those times it was after I had launched the nuke. I really can't understand how they're still allowing duped bobbleheads to stack so high??
---
This should be already in game, but why it is not?
---
You have a lot of good points here. 
---
Those events can be fun but like you said people rarely show up to them. I've also played entire sessions with hunter v hunted activated and I haven't gotten a hit. 
---
By far the easiest way to initiate pvp is by boosting your wanted level. What's the easiest way to raise your bounty? By destroying a base, or taking a workshop. This creates a weird situation where if you want to experience any kind of open world pvp you have to do something bad to get it going. 
---
After fighting across the map I can say this game has some fun settings for fire fights. Pleasant Valley train station, Spruce Knob workshop, and The temple of the winding path are some of my personal favorites. With the variety of settings that we have why confine honest pvp to these limited locations.
---
If there were a way to simply flag myself for pvp, say as an icon on the map, I would rather do that then raze some poor bastards house. Unfortunately, that's all there is for us to work with.
---
Maybe a FO76 pvp subreddit may be in order? I think with a proper outlet you would see a shift away from raiding. 
---
Many work shops have this when the respective nuclear plant is repaired
---
...just taking the f**king room out never occurred to them?
---
I'm selling one 
---
Yea I was scammed once myself too. Guy immediately left the server and blocked me lol
---
Yup, happened to me a few hours ago. Had to kill the client and restart to play.
---
Same, but corn. Im never hungry or thirsty. 
---
Was the ability of the Todd Howard to convince mobbs that they were not connected to a server, freeze them and let you walk past them as they knew it was pure bull s...? :)
---
I get attacked by a vengeful in cranberry bog fairly frequently 
---
Found a lvl 10 ts
---
I had an excellent moment today when I (lvl 35) was trudging back to my C.A.M.P near the Top of the World. A higher level player was doing some of his chores at his base as I trotted by. He called me over then dropped some legendary weapons for me and a little pile of stims. I was blown away by the kindness. He then promptly logged off. Thanks random wasteland Santa!
---
Last night I ran into a group of super mutants with one of these daggers, one of which was legendary and dropped an assassin arm with 6 damage resist. Yes I know! I couldn't believe my luck either but I went in with full health and came out with full health and 8 bodies around me. The thing hits so fast that 10 clicks later you've filled a 1/4 of your health bar.
---
Well I just learned even more
---
Why are you making up statistics?
---
Cuz even when the bots at WS kill you, they will still come after you even when you respawn. Only solution is drop from the server.
---
Also by doing the events to power up nuclear plants, you'll get the fusion generator plans. Slap on contractor 2 when you take a work shop then put that generator down and you'll never need to power up Poseidon again
---
Hmm, I couldn't find a blue house, I found a brown one that matches the description, could someone post some pictures when they have the time? Cheers
---
This is it right here.  Now imagine if duping wasn't a thing and only a few possessed the 2SE's.  They would win 99% of pvp encounters.  I have around 500 hours in and never have had a 2SE explosive drop.  Have had one or the other with modifiers.
---
You would certainly think after that many hours the most op weapon in the game would be available.   But no.  I do have a 2SE now thanks to the market saturation of them.  I bought one from a Charleston vendor of all places.  I can actually compete in pvp now as almost everyone lvl 50+ has one on xbox.  
---
It's not like I've just stuck to base building either.  I have a lvl 200 and 2x lvl 60.  Killed the queen about 60 times at least.   Done whitesprings probably more.   Also have many events under my belt which provide a 3* enemy.  Only has the odd decent drop.  
---
Now I am struggling to play the game.  It is not rewarding for the amount of time I have put in.  Yes RNG can be a nightmare, but with 500 hours?  Nah I'm not having that anymore. The game should reward players who play it.  Plan farming is mostly done.  Thanks to lvl lock on the handmade my first character has no handmade plan.   Now all is left is legendary grinding.  But that's rendered useless in a big mob as the bodies despawn or it transfers to a nearby meat pile on a normal enemy.  Even then it's a 1 or 3 star.
---
I've had my monies worth.   But those saying 500 hours is well worth it.  Most of it was grinding for legendaries.  In between the crashes and glitches, a lot of the time frustrating.  It's a live service, I expect to be able to sink a lot of time into it.  Just like I have with Rainbow six, overwatch, and DayZ.  
---
At least with 500 hours in rainbow six I had the coverted black ice skin on some of my characters.  RNG in this game is frustrating.  My best armor drop was a 3* from a normal golf ghoul when I was on a plastic run.  
---
TSE means two shot explosive.
---
They need to just remove their ability to stack. Or have a limit. Maybe 5 stack limit? Nobody needs to do 50000 damage. 
---
Don't believe everything you read here.
---
Equip. Press hit. Or bash. Does small ammounts of damage.
---
Wow. I just never thought to even try, huh. TIL
---
10,000 item dupers on the wall, 10,000 item duuuuuperssss...
---
Take one down, banhammer it around...
---
I was there! Such a nice camp.
---
The interesting thing about the video is not a guy soloing the SBQ, is the SBQ spawning WITHOUT A NUKE ZONE!!! , That's the first time I've seen it to be honest. We all know any tse shotgun can melt the queen solo in bout 2-3 mins , but this is the first time I've seen the queen spawn without a nuke being launched
---
It also removes your underarmor for some reason, while the sniper outfit does not...
---
There are ways to dupe without crashing the server or crafting 500 items. 
---
Not sure if the one I am thinking of is traceable at all. 
---
Ignoring the disconnects, and the bugs, and everything wrong with the coding of the game - there's not that much to do. Visiting every POI and doing every quest and going through every terminal and reading every note takes an embarrassingly-short amount of time.  
---
Then you're just killing the Singing Bitch Queef or running laps around the golf course.  
---
But hey, since it's online, there'll be continuing development... right?
---
So carry 1 of each Combat and Hunting Rifle? What mods are best for each?
---
I found the plans for the "Lever Gun" as well as a Lever Gun that has the 4x ammo thing on it. I haven't used it b/c finding all the mats to craft/scrap them is going to take some time. Unless someone knows where to farm them.  
---
I have Tank Killer maxed on my main which this is for. All Rifleman perks are at 1 star each.
---
This is desperately needed for bartering items (ie no caps involved). It’s pretty easy for someone to scam in those trades, especially when the suggestion is both sides set the item to 0 or an amount below it’s market value. 
---
damn is it me or server is DEAD as fk. 
---
If usually tells you the name of the key you need when you try to unlock something.
---
You sure it's leather not hunters coat ?
---
Level 35 bloodied explosive pump shotgun is most effective
---
Most fun to use is my instigating explosive harpoon gun with frechette mod on it. It's just so damn satisfying to use, and the long reload makes it feel more fair (over 6k damage if I sneak and target is at full hp, no heavy weapon perks). Also stabilized perk is amazing
---
This would strain servers though. 
---
The game isn't coded to handle unique item nunbers. 
---
Instigating, limb damage spear from level 50 to 90.  The super mutants dont have time to complain if Im sneaking, otherwise I have to listen to "My arm!"
---
 Looks silly with power armor.  
---
Recently got a 2 shot gatling from a pal after a bout of Uranium Fever.  No perks in heavy weapons but it is pretty impressive with martial artist and all this ammo I stockpiled!
---
What?  Pharma Farma is for searching med containers. 
---
That makes no sense. They want you to buy them, but they can't be available \*only\* to those that buy, so they have to allow people to earn them - but you have to only earn them at a trickle pace, otherwise no one would buy them.
---
Wouldn't you want the max damage even from far away?  
---
Is armor penetration (Penetrating/Stinging) good? I've been told that silencers help alot with not attracting big groups of enemies. What mods for each rifle would you suggest?
---
On one hand... I can see what they are trying to do, and can even commend it. On the other hand, this would do absolutely nothing since most duped items are kept on mule alts.
---
duped? as in, verb? you're definitely right.
---
but every single person who has ever traded something is at risk. duped weapons are so widespread you might have one yourself.
---
At least you tried.
---
They may not want it for a lust of power, we live in dark times at the moment unfortunately  where to fight against the plague of one shot dupers the only defence is to fight like they do.
---
It's sad that it has come to this but some people are sick of the one sided fights when encountering these people.
---
I don't use bobbleheads at all, when I find them I sell them to vendors rather than keep them
---
No it doesn't. If you have the required key it will say something like "Unlock with (insert key name)".
---
There is a vent in the ash heap section of the map by a mine that spews out some very nasty radiation comparable to or better than that.
---
I love when people just make shit up.
---
You're basing this whole post on rumour but somehow have an exact 65% of the player base being impacted. 
---
What a joke.
---
The dupe defenders and 76 haters on this sub are by far the most gullible, idiotic, obnoxious group of people I've ever come across in any game community. Sheer stupidity. 
---
Fun fact: Blindly buying into rumour and just pulling a percentage out your ass because you have a hate boner for Bethesda  is no better than "blindly defending anything 76 related" as you put it. 
---
Fallout is based on the 50s idea of scifi, thats why it was always described as retro-futuristic. The originals didn't have all that many ancient looking guns in em, I mean the "assault rifle" in Fo4/76 is a bit of an eyesore.
---
The focus with firearms was more on the 80s or 90s Hollywood stuff or "cool guns" and then mixed in with some light scifi or prototype things like the DKS, G-11 or vindicator. 
---
Personally, I think regressing in firearms tech was a mistake. Because you get weird combinations of things like rifles with polymer stocks and watercooled maxim'ish guns in service at the same time. While you lose all the iconic stuff and weird prototype thingies.
---
The real oldschool scifi aesthetic was mainly visible with some environments, vehicles, robots and energy weapons, which is where Bethesda has kept true.
---
I'm impressed by your enginuity but also mad at your intent. well played
---
*You can build a really big house.*
---
You can skip that junk grind. Move your camp just a little and place it back down. Now everything will be in your storage repaired. This let's you pay caps, and time, to repair without wasting junk. 
---
If you want to just repair be sure to have the construction card equipped to cut the cost. 
---
Yeah. But then I can't see over them. And it's so ugly and budget intensive to half wall two sets of 5 stories. I really wish the small fences snapped. I think the local HOA would murder me if I made it much of an eyesore.
---
Try equipping the gun rather than just looking at it in your inventory (assuming that's what you are doing)
---
Banned me indefinitely
---
1 star TS? level &amp; what do you want? im on PS4.
---
Sorry wrong perk... Traveling pharmacy
---
Do you mean Traveling Pharmacy? Yeah, it really *should* include them but it doesn't. 
---
Yes. And I'm sure Bethesda is stupid enough to ban people who unknowingly obtained duped items all of a sudden. 
---
Sheer. Fucking. Stupidity. 
---
Sorry, I’m on pc
---
When ever I get into power armour my regular armour ends up in my inventory as unequipped. Is this a glitch or should it do this? 
---
nah the strike base this for BoS. Was wrong anyway, checked. Sorry
---
At least ticks you can sometimes get tick blood from which translates into free stimpacks with a little crafting.
---
Me too. But they don't snap to the staircases. And lining them with bookshelves is so 2018. I hope they fix that. And maybe let the stairs stack without breaking physics?
---
The faster the SBQ kill, the lower the chance the server shits the bed before your investment of time and resources pays out.
---
You mean you *don't* enjoy killing 3 star legendaries for a junkie's rolling pin?
---
These guys do not care about your gameplay.  A lot haven't even played any of the other fallouts.  It's Bethesdas job to patch these exploits.   They are a huge corporation and have the resources to do so.
---
You will never, ever bargain with exploiters.  A lot have the attitude of 'if they ban me I'll stop playing'.  They will simply move on to another game.  If you are pleaing to anyone it should be the developers.  They are responsible for the code and how the game works.  
---
My buddy got the ban and he hasn't been on in weeks nor did he do any glitches lol
---
It's not about the items
---
I assume he is. 
---
His main purpose here lately has been to defend duping and selling duped items. 
---
I hope Bethesda bans him. 
---
I hope they ban him even if he isn't a duper. 
---
Bethesda would earn back some serious amounts of good will from me by doing so. 
---
Full auto because it's hilarious and ammo is easy to find or make
---
They didn't plan for players stacking 200 duped bobble heads to get enough damage to one shot through the slap filter
---
Or maybe, you found a X-01 Jetpack and buy it in a heart bite, now you want to install it without actual PA on your backpack (I do store couple PA in my stash because they don't have proper mod yet so use them now may create more issue than not, such as Calibrated Shock....).
---
Fine, no big deal, fast travel to my C.A.M.P. -- oh wait, I now recall the memory of first warning screen I saw right after entering this world ( Your C.A.M.P. cannot be loaded because someone else....)
---
If you are also overencumbered... now you need to walk to basement of Whitespring resort.
---
Or, you know, in similar situation; you are uncertain about whether or not you has the Jetpack mod installed, so you need to pull the whole PA set from stash before paying a couple hundred caps to those tin-head...
---
:-p
---
Loot is loot. I saw one of those black cats once. I paused to admire its cuteness for a moment before shooting it with my shotgun and collecting the meat. Cat: It's good for the lips
---
I have no idea what the soundtrack is like to this, FO4, FO3, or FONV.  I turned them all off pretty early, and do it out of habit now.  I might actually need to turn it on for a minute once in a while, and see what I'm not missing.
---
I worry pvp/pve servers would suck the diversity of interactions you can have in this game. 
---
I really think a way to tag yourself for pvp would work wonders, or maybe a circle on the map, when you activate hunter/hunted. 
---
I mean if it’s for an expensive item. I generally ask people to go into party chat and have a talk with them.
---
It’s not fool proof but hearing them talk about the trade is a good indicator they are usually going to make the trade.
---
If they respond with “no I won’t” I don’t even bother making the trade
---
I’m Xbox one btw.
---
I'm just basing myself on what I'm reading here. multiple people reporting they've been banned simply for owning a dupe.
---
chill out.
---
There's one small subreddit, /r/FO76Builds.
---
I've mentioned this in the past in another thread and would love to see it. 
---
Casino type games, PVP arean gambling, anything really. 
---
I have no idea if this is at all possible, but Im going to say it anyways....for all the items you can place in camp that you would want to put things on, so shelving, side tables etc...they could have a number of spaces to show items.
---
Much like a mannequin that showcases armor. A side table would have 1 fillable slot, so you click on the side table and select a lamp from your stash..lamp is placed on table.
---
Shelving units have 3 slots per shelf, you go through your stash and choose books, teddy bear and chems....these are shown on your shelving unit.
---
Though these items are on display, they cannot be taken because who wants to showcase their stuff just to have someone take it.
---
I honestly wonder if ppl that yell "I got 1 shot through pacifist: actually play with it, don't have a bounty or didn't get flag cause of a party member. Cause honestly to god I'm yet to see a random 1 shot in 300h through pacifist and I had a fair share of pvp against Tse users and even spent 1h and over 4k in caps fighting for the lulz
---
I love them!  Never kill a frog bro.  
---
It bummed me out when I'd go poolside and see a froggy genocide.  But then one day I caught the reason.  Those damn golf ghouls attack them.  I try to help them when I can but sometimes im already too late.  
---
Thanks I'll look at it today ! 
---
Yes. Some people here reporting they've been banned....
---
How did you extrapolate 65% from that?
---
Try playing it in a team and one of your team mates CTD's and you have to start it again. Both my mates being from the states said that ass of a mission was JUST like the DMV lol.
---
As a designed mission though, only an idiot would come up with with a POS like this.
---
*"Hey, let's make a really boring mission!"*
---
*"What? You mean another one?"*
---
*"Yes but this one we'll make REALLY boring...."*
---
*"You just earned yourself a promotion!"*
---
So one of the causes of server crashing is because of the duping itself. When a person logs in with an abnormal amount of items\weapons the server reads those items and in doing so can cause the server to become unstable.
---
That being said the servers without them are still pretty iffy.
---
I don't think so. I've had it for awhile and never noticed one. 
---
I'd also like to see which mods can be learned by scrapping, so you don't waste time and space hoarding equipment to scrap them  for no reason.
---
When I saw the cooler in the crafting menu I thought it would do exactly that.
---
I was pretty disappointed when I saw a .50 cal machine gun and several piles of junk stuffed into in :(
---
Just a bit of info somewhat relating.  The super stimpack can be obtained from events in and around cranberry bog.  The normal stimpack can either be found in a mirror on top of the big excavator or bought in the enclave.
---
Thought I'd put in the comments here than warrant a separate post.
---
That's true. I just put on the Chemist perk and dilute all my Stimpaks. 
---
The budget is your basic build. After that, you keep getting cards. Think intelligence, like those cards that only affect crafting? Now you can buy them up and equip them when needed.
---
^(nice)
---
One suggestion I do have is that if you're wanted, free PvP is active once anyone steps within your CAMP's build area. 
---
This means you'd be able to actually defend yourself without a disadvantage on workshops or camps that you own.
---
This would make a lot of the traps and other structures much more useful. I realize the one seeking the bounty does become marked hostile if they seek revenge, but the person with the bounty does start the first engagement with a disadvantage. And that first engagement can dictate whether they lose the bounty to begin with, rendering their defenses essentially useless.
---
With a TSE, you are gonna want it.
---
I just pulled it out of my ass. I'm not even ashamed to say it because you're getting hung up on a non-issue.
---
50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. point is, a sizeable chunk of the playerbase is in possession of a duped item.
---
I may just have to become a cannibal now.
---
So scorched rain is a thing, but no one has put together a compilation of clips and slapped a cover of It's Raining Men over it yet? 
---
Just make sure she has passive mode on 👍
---
What do you play on?
---
Ok, hopefully I'll see you around the wastes 
---
Nope. Not sloppiness. As others point out Mass and WV have an energy industry connection. 
---
And now you look dumb. 
---
No I don't think so. It had a longer tail and chunkier body. But I'll go find it anyways
---
Max lvl for drill is 20 isnt it? My friend once found a legendary drill it was the only I've seen and wondered why I havent found one yet. Turned out the legendary enemy was low lvl
---
I'm a level 28 and just have a sniper rifle( 84 damage) and pump shotgun (93 damage). I enjoy the challenge of being strategic in my attempts of exploring new places. I sneak and pick off what I can or aggro them into the open shoot and run. Lol. Then when I'm inside I use the shotgun. Try to use the sneak bonus if possible. I find no shame in running... my wife thinks it's funny though. 
---
Came here to say this, you sly bastard.
---
They are shared so no, making more characters won't give more atoms.
---
I didn't vote for him!
---
Yeah, and i make No attempt to hide that I 110% &lt;3 the D :p
---
Farming whitesprings means I drop like 25 radaway every other time. Every flavored mentat I got you covered.im flush with chems I'll never use cause they weigh nothing 
---
Its not uncommon to see industries advertising in partner states/provinces. 
---
It was hilarious and so enjoyable. I loved it. Especially the ghouls' names :D
---
if you repair a chainsaw to 200% the damage shoots up like CRAZY
---
same goes for all fast melee weapons (ripper, drill, handy saw) 
---
Noooooice 
---
With a team of 3, you do it 9 times....
---
Yeah, I don't know that That's true. People keep saying it, but I haven't seen anything from Bethesda that supports the claim.
---
Huh, and here i was thinking they were some kind of aincient magical focus. Ah well *vendors*
---
Garb of mysteries is technically “no armor” but the level 50 gives really good damage resistance 
---
Actually I like the method as it is. They made new things cheaper, so they are hearing the community, and now, as the items aren't overpriced, if you really want something you just need to farm daily challenges.
---
This is super cool, gonna check it out today! I think I've been in there, because I did pick up two wedding rings a while back.
---
I'm quite positive the bracketed number is a mod ?
---
Exactly.  Those saying they never need to buy atoms as the game rewards all the time need a fact check.  It's a fair deal (sort of).  I mean sort of as the game was released in an unfinished state.  Instead of working on mostly new content, they are back peddling trying to fix bugs.
---
I've bought atoms.  But they don't deserve it with the game's current state.  Half of these items are copy pasted from fallout 4.  Not new content.  But content FREE in fallout 4, ported to 76.   
---
I won't spend another cent until the game is in a better state.  If they want to fund content then at least have the game in a playable state and start selling NEW content.  Not piecing up old fallout 4 assets and selling them to us for more than the bloody fallout 4 DLC.  Shame on them for doing this.
---
i was gonna say wrong sub but since you know the proper title etiquette you probably already know that.
---
The better to troll you.
---
I knew about the  contractor card its very handy, but I didnt actually know about the moving your camp abit thing thanks for that i'll try it the next time me camp gets battered.
---
How does it look ? My google-fu is failing me.
---
It's okay that we disagree on this. I'm gonna stand by my claim. You can do the same with yours.
---
Your assumption that Bethesda would ban anyone who owns a duped weapon and not just dupers is absolutely based on a reality so far the fuck away from anything approaching reasonable.
---
Have you for one second thought of something of the fucking implications of that?
---
Oh hey My Duper.... You have thousands of duped items....just go around dropping them and sit back while you cause waves of players bans because they randomly picked up a paper bag. 
---
Sheer. Fucking. Stupidity.
---
It’s level scaled so I really don’t see why you even need to think about your level, just enjoy the game
---
Yes. I was at a trailer in ash heaps area, guy was on top of it. Blasted me and I died. No vehicles around, not wanted, not workshop, fullish health. Always solo. Not wanted. No I don't have video, yes it's anecdotal. Still happened.
---
Sounds about right to my experience, one exploding single action, and two low level two-shots, at level 106.
---
No team. It's not a huge deal. Happened to me twice and that time I blocked the guy. Could have been a me specific bug, I don't know. I'm just saying I know it can happen from personal experience.
---
They built the bunker, I agree. It's a Vault. That doesn't mean the Enclave allowed them to maintain staff there. And given the Enclave's nature, they wouldn't want Vault Tec interfering.
---
Would the Enclave want CAMPs or GECKs? Absolutely they would. But maybe they didn't trust Vault Tec. Maybe they knew Vault Tec's nature and didn't want more of their product than necessary.
---
There are lots of reasons for there not to be a STASH in the Bunker.
---
It tells you when you try to open something anyways without having the key.
---
[Here's some screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/2Dc8F5A), where it says "Only (key name) can unlock", though I probably found the worst-named example looking for keys I didn't have yet, the "Safe Key".
---
i think that might be "intended"
---
to counter people loading in to invisible enemies and unloaded textures
---
Start taking the Service Entrance, my dude.
---
Yeah, send in the requests, let the team prioritise them. Anything they're doing is an improvement and most stuff will happen in time.
---
My favorite rumor was the one about Fallout 76 completing bricking computers and making them unusable and in no way salvageable.  And claims that people had to throw away their $1,500 desktops or their laptops. 
---
Sony also made it really easy (intentionally) and not watranty breaking to swap your hard drive! You just have to remove a pannel and some phillips head screws in the OG one, or press a thing and it pops out (from what i understand) in the slim/pro. Mine's rocking a 1TB Ssd and i &lt;3 it lol
---
You don't seem to know much about games then.  Morrowwind isn't an RPG then? Can anyone think of a more buggy game than this? The previous Fallout's probably weren't as bad. Thousands of games are produced with less bugs so no, it's you that seems to know nothing a) about games and b) about software development. 
---
Must be all the other software house just get lucky all the time and manage to produce working games, right?
---
There is a recipe which allows you to craft them
---
This is how ghouls are made.
---
I am well aware. Read the edit. I woul think people could pull my meaning out of that but people want to nitpick the wording knowing samwell what I mean.
---
i picked us some random loot in an owned workshop and became wanted... 
---
so annoying,, really wish they made the action red like skyrim did
---
Wendigo screams on the floor below.
---
&gt;You have contracted Sludge lung.
---
Yeah I'd be happy to be able to configure presets
---
Nobody is disputing the fact that the game is a mess  but the people who come on to this sub pointing this fact out also go after people for actually enjoying the game. So the issue is in fact whether a person enjoys it or not, because it is such a huge part of the argument against the game. ‘The game is a buggy mess’ ‘yes I know, but I am still having fun’ ‘YOURE PART OF THE PROBLEM! HOW DARE YOU ENJOY SOMETHING THAT ANNOYS ME!’ 
---
I don't understand how you have such a massive budget. Im incredibly jealous and apparently terrible at this game. Fantastic job though! 
---
Hooooooly shit new patch on console ia so fucked
---
Rollback and actually test it plz &lt;.&lt;
---
I mean, wtf is this input control lock going on?!
---
And I've never had real issues with disconnects or lag till post patch
---
I'll buy it, even on the atom shop, without any doubt. Even if I like my Enclave officer suit.  
---
Like you, I really liked the strike context in this game (I'm French, That must be why I like Riots !) and I hope we'll learn more about them in future updates. 
---
Blood worms too!
---
Yeah, not really worth the time it takes to to kill it. In that time I can find 18 stimpacks, 5 pyscho;s and 8 buffouts and come away with more caps and kills and other items that are usuefull to me as fell as pick up junk.
---
Are you serious????
---
Daaammmnnnn. This needs to be a PSA. I’m lvl55 and has been using meds and psychobuftats together for the longest. 
---
Doh!!!
---
I can honestly say I have never seen a post on here where someone got attacked for liking it
---
There's a section of Harper's Ferry that becomes accessible by a quest. I think it's the bunker quests. You'll get the key as you do the quest. Or direction where to get it.
---
Yes but realistically impact transfers not only to the suit but you as well hence why concussion happens without notable injury to the head. If it wasn’t the case though as we all know the game wouldn’t be fun at all with armour 
---
I think many people here would actually spend more if the prices were a bit fairer.  Spending $20 worth on a stash skin and outfit is extortionate, considering this game isn't free to play.
---
EVE Online got the whole dev room turned into part of EVE's lore. It's a region of space nobody can go to unless beig teleported there. It's being controlled by an ancient race (aka the devs) and you can see the region on the galaxy map. You can even see how many devs are active in one of the region's systems as the map shows activity of each system within EVE's galaxy. Region is also the battleground of the yearly alliance tournament.
---
You should have tried The division at release and the early updates, the RNG pain was real. Have friends who still never got the drops they wanted after hundreds of hours! 
---
Unless you purchase the 1950s option like me, which includes childcare, hot meals on the table at 6:30, general cleaning and encouragement to "go out and do things with your friends"
---
Since I don’t have evidence, I can only state I have been killed more than once , no less than 8 times by someone while in pacifist mode.   Take that how you want it.  
---
So if thats true then why is account suspended? 
---
Got no idea
---
I love the perk cards! Overall though your work is amazing.
---
Keep forgetting they exist... nearly 600 hours and saw none. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to put this out there.
---
WWWHHHHRRRRRRRRR
---
I've been looking at that card recently and there's a way to drink directly from ater isn't there and not get rads or disease?
---
It happened a LOT at launch with the occasional sputter here and there now.  
---
Just try leaving a 'I liked it' comment on a YouTube video that talks about the game.
---
&gt;One of my favorite things about this game, is the emphasis on the union workers vs. the big, greedy bosses. The workers feared losing their jobs to automation, and talks plenty about strikes and riots. You hear the music that fits this theme so much on the radio in-game as well. 
---
&gt;And obviously, where there’s riots there’s riot gear. 
---
Unless you... Use robots to bust the strikes and out down the riots...
---
Hard to say. Could be a mistake. Could have been flagged by other users as a duper but is innocent. Could have dev room items, even if he doesn’t know they’re dev room items. Rumor around here seems to be that the last one is a sore spot with Bethesda and they’re banning people with them. 
---
Yep lol
---
Well, you'll be pleased to know that I'm not one of those people. I'm glad you enjoy the game. And equally, I expect people will come after me here from the other side, as they have done before. You're right, there's nothing wrong with enjoying a broken mess of a game.. but I do think the sort of denialism exhibited by some over the past few months is very odd if nothing else. And I'm just wondering, if not now.. when? Surely, this is the time that even Bethesda's staunchest apologists have to hold their hands up.
---
Did you at least get a lot of caps from your murder spree? 😂😂
---
This reminds me of the trolls who brought in multiple gamma guns to a queen fight and then would drop them for the scorched to pick up 😂
---
Is there a way to get that legit? Or was it through that glitch?
---
Yeah, on it's on working perfectly and no bugs in the game it's an awful mission. They should have combined it with a mission to find beer bottles...
---
In the current game state, it turns this crap mission into probably the worst mission ever conceived in a game.
---
I dont have that many disconnects or bugs. People are friendly. 
---
I play on PC. Consoles are different, maybe?
---
I have no trouble understanding why anyone would not enjoy this game, though. What I cant understand is all the energy some people spend on something the dont like. I have zero interest in about 99.99% of published video games. I ignore them all and spend my precious time on this planet occupied with other things :-)
---
Sometimes the budget will glitch and give you like 20% more, I've had it happen a couple times.
---
For next ES game, they use F76 to test how far they can go with MTX and how well is this concept working. 
---
That’s what I ment. They are shared. You do all dailies on one char, get atoms. You do all dailies on a second chat = boom, more atoms. All shared between all you characters on that account?
---
Or did I get this wrong?
---
Yeah, I've seen it happen. But there's assholes on both sides, I've seen it the other way round too. You get attacked for not liking the game. That's why I'm trying to remove the issue of whether someone liked it or not.. can't we just call a spade a spade at this point?
---
Kinda weird bug 
---
Snot Ear is the grossest sounding one.
---
Hmmm.  Coming from an account created right after launch, with a name themed like game.  Troll much ?  Or are you just butt hurt?   Lol
---
Your build budget gets bigger the higher level you are. I’m not entirely sure when this stops, but I’m at lvl 60-something and each level let’s me place at least one small thing down. It has definitely slowed down though.
---
This along with having no turrets helps immensely. The turrets take up an absolutely asinine amount of budget and serve little purpose for me. I rarely get attacked and it’s normally only when I’m home, so I can fight them off no problem.
---
Using 'Can we all agree?' is a really good way to not get anyone on your side.
---
No shit there's something wrong with the game. There's a lot wrong with it.
---
You're still not going to make me drop the game. It's still very much enjoyable to me. Enjoyable enough that despite my gripes I'd very much like to see it succeed than fail.
---
Their stacking is actually a glitch.

Sometimes it'll share your instanced loot with someone else, and when they loot it (It most commonly happens with the queen because of all of the participants) your loot won't be available. I've watched my loot be taken out of her inventory a few times, so now I don't bother to check, I just rush her and spam the body.
---
Sure, only trade with "trusted" friends in an MMO that should revolve around its economy. LMFAO. Maybe Beth should fucking fix their shit.
---
I love stories like these.  There definitely are some amazing people in this game.  The best experiences I've had in 76 we're from people banding together.
---
&gt; haven't seen anything from Bethesda that supports the claim.     
---
Their entire reason for limiting the stash.
---
Weather shells were in 4. Might be leftovers?
---
The only thing that does really matter is whether someone enjoys the game. I think the closest thing I could compare this to is No Mans Sky. I have played both. I hated No Mans Sky, but I have a blast with FO76. The dupers/broken economy doesnt effect me, because I do not buy weapons from people. While I have taken weapons and armour from friends (Not dupers) If they did not give them to me, I would continue the grind until I get them on my own. I dont seek out getting "the best" weapons or armour from others because that destroys the point of grinding for them.
---
I enjoy wandering around killing the spawned enemies. I find the scorched beasts to be aggravating to deal with, but I can avoid them, or kill them. 
---
Do I get frustrated if the server drops, sure. However, I havent had it happen to me so much that I quit. I do feel that Bethesda is working to resolve the situations. I am looking forward to new content, but the game just came out. It will take time. 
---
The bottom line is this, of all the games that have come out in the past, I would play them for a bit and then discard them. FO76 I have been playing nonstop since it was released. I see real world objects and want to scrap them for screws or gears. To me, that means I am enjoying the hell out of the game. 
---
I bought 4,000 Suppy Requisitions from a guy that I can only hope he duplicated and not farmed for countless hours for a mere 0 caps // have yet to get anything worthwhile other than watching an alpha death claw beat the shit out of a scorched beast the moment it landed.
---
Nice(France)
---
And honestly, what does it actually matter to you if people defend the game to their graves? does it in some way impact your life, stop you from enjoying something? If you dont want to read about it, then don't, but why do u have to "understand" it.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Thank you kind sir for the all this info.
---
Case in point.. there's a guy below who's game is now fucked after the patch.. all he's said is just that but some people came a long and felt the need to downvote it. Fucking weird imo.
---
I am not a duper. 
---
Isn’t it just when you shart or sneeze and fart idk
---
I always get this from the snallygaster jizz attack.
---
&gt; "Raider RP" would be played as razing a CAMP and defending yourself from those that show up to collect the bounty (and/or avenge their CAMP).
---
No, not at all.  Raiders steal stuff, you cant steal from another players CAMP.  Destroying someone's CAMP is just being an asshole.
---
It's not my job to defend the game, but still isn't it little self-righteous to say, that "can we all agree with what I say?"
---
And I just enjoy the game, my solo experience has been great, but playing with a friend is buggy as hell.
---
I quite liked that as a trade-off in the original Fallout. Laser and plasma weapons were very powerful there, but if you used them you might not get any loot from a dead enemy. Felt more realistic, but I can see how it wouldn't go down well in a loot based shooter like FO76!
---
They fucked up majorly and they will make it even worse by banning 50-75% of their current playerbase. That will help the game a lot.... LOL
---
The black and white one with the scorched. That one.
---
never got one
---
Wow, I never came across this set in NV. Perfect excuse for a replay. This could definitely be something the guys at Hornwright cooked up to deal with those ungrateful commie unionists...
---
Didn't someone mention a while back that they'd datamined enemy stats, and most of them had huge amounts of energy resistance? If so, that really should've been tweaked by now. 
---
Like releasing a half baked always online multiplayer game with evident dupe glitches and a fucking dev room in it that can be accessed by anyone who tries hard enough? I guess Beth doesn't have to take responsibility for that huh? Not like I care, I never cheated and I already deleted this piece of shit game from my PS4 but it just makes me LOL when I read a hypocritical comment like this lol.
---
And I upvoted him.  Still has a valid criticism but needs to frame it in a less dickish manner.
---
I can agree the game is flawed, and that Bethesda has really bitten off more than it seems they were capable of chewing and it’s frustrating that they never seem to learn from mistakes made. The lack of story and the lack of NPCs. It’s all not good. But despite that, I still like playing it, I’ve found people to play with and enjoy it, and people *do* hate on that. Those that don’t like it can hate on the game all they want, it’s not that great of a game atm; when they hate on us for enjoying it, they make it about our personal feelings towards the game, which we will obviously defend.
---
I dont have that many disconnects or bugs. People are friendly, either. And I play on PS4. I get why people don't like the game. Every time I bring it up around my dad, he says, " it has all the worst stuff from fallout 3 and New Vegas, like condition of weapons and armor." So I get the hate. But personally I think it is a good game that's been poorly executed.
---
Compare enemy drops to current inventory so that if an increase occurs without a recent legendary kill there’s something fishy
---
Sounds like the cheat with the alien blaster in it, google ab location should be tnt dome key 2 or 3 I think
---
Since Skyrim wasn't online, it was easy to just leave anything where it was. Now the code must ensure that no other player can interact with and move/steal that item.
---
Wait it marks as wanted? OK that's dumb. I loved calling them in and meeting new people that way
---
Im more curious about teh Christmas trees
---
My camp just got fucking demolished last night while I stood there and watched. This post has given me life again. Thank you. 
---
Yeah but my favourite is still when mid way through pvp the msg bug occurs and you get destroyed because only your g key will do anything 
---
So people trading with you might become flagged for having items you can't get by normal means ingame...
---
Do not waste 800atoms or dont wear heavy. I dont have heavy leather left arm, but heavy leather chest and legs work with this skin.
---
Not that kind of exploit can’t do it on purpose it’s random
---
well... i can agree there are things wrong with Fo76, but you seem to be confused that things wrong with Fo76 equal things wrong with Bethesda.  those are 2 separate issues that just overlap.  Quite a few of the things wrong with Fo76 are ever so slowly getting addressed, i can't comment on the 2nd issue improving.
---
Thing is...so what?  We can't physically roll back time &amp; re-insert the game into Todd's hiney so it can cook a little longer.  All we can do is squeeze what we can from it &amp; hope that there was enough money made for the company(that is known for "good enough" patching) to continue to invest in it vs drop it like a hot rock.
---
I get frustrated, i get bored at times, but i can see the potential &amp; I'm getting my money back out of it by doing the bits i enjoy.
---
Not sure if the infinite spawning enemies has been patched, but It's another reason for people to sit there and farm. That's pretty much the only negative I can think of. 
---
Then you're not paying attention, at all.
---
Anything cosmetic like that will probably be marked down for the atom store, unfortunately. Still, if it's cheap enough I wouldn't balk at using some points on one!
---
I’m level 194 and I am still unlocking and ranking up perks. You’ll find things to do.
---
Definitely something I am going to be checking out when I get off work. 
---
This is like me saying.. Hold on, what's with you now wanting to understand why I want to understand...
---
It's called discourse.. we are a fan community here together. Talking to each other is good and fine.
---
To answer your question.. I don't have any issue with people liking the game.. in fact, I'd like to be able to like it more myself.. the game had/has cool potential. What bothers me is the extent to which there's some people who won't accept, and it seems will never accept, just what a bad state the game is in. I understand that ultimately it's all just different opinions and it is what it is.. but I'm throwing in my two cents here and saying I do think it's bad for the community overall and the future of us enjoying Bethesda games to not push back on this level of borkedness and mismanagement by Bethesda.
---
Hmm I'm gonna have to test this, because I think the dailies are global.  
---
Edit: Yes the dailies and weeklies are shared on all characters.  Meaning you cannot do a daily 5 times over.
---
A guide to marine armor: Don't get it. :D
---
Ding!   Winner!
---
I don’t PVP but thanks for your excellent post calling things as they are.
---
Yup, absolutely right r/ManchurianCandycane. The weapons are in the game, but in their current state just aren't worth even trying to use. Don't think I've ever seen someone yet using energy weapons, other than the odd time where maybe 1 or 2 people have a plasma or laser gattling at a SBQ fight 
---
but why does it bother u, that I dont get, who really cares, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and if those opinions is Bethesda can do no wrong, let them be.
---
What a useful contribution. Maybe instead of just giving out your absolute opinion as if it were the ultimate truth provide examples? Show me a post were s1 is attacked for liking the game?
---
Its also a bit ironic that - in essence - you are attacking me for being of a different opinion, which is right up there with the original issue...
---
Might be down for this. 
---
I mostly use rifles, but the Gatling Plasma is one of my favorites for nuke zones. It does break fast tho. I bought the plans for it (I don't  have a legendary yet) and carry an extra when it's Scorched Earth time - Bear Arms is a worthwhile perk. I also invested in Weapon Artisan 3, Gunsmith 5, and Luck Of The Draw. I get about 6 cores (homemade, so more than 100% full) out of each that way.
---
people in this very sub are reporting getting banned for just owning a duped weapon.
---
can you even read? it's the second time I'm saying this.
---
Fair points. All I would say is I do see those as two separate points that overlap. Which is why the situation sucks even more lol.. and makes me concerned about their next releases, which I was otherwise looking forward to.
---
The one you bought is probably duped, so if there was anyway to recognize duped item, it would fail the test
---
Sounds pretzel-logic fiddly like everything else about the CAMP system, but a good tip, thanks. 
---
If I spawn in and hear missiles I run down and shut the double doors. That stops most of the agro from their turrets for my run. 
---
Stimpack - 1lbs
---
Super stimpack - 1,5lbs
---
As Todd said when they announced the game, PvP is not convenient. So do not be surprised if people look nice. If he could, he would leave you in his underwear.
---
Do you capture workshops often?
---
*snaps* 
---
A seemingly meek prisoner trapped in an interdimensional realm that's won over the community.
---
Sounds like final boss material.
---
The mire and the cranberry bog mire border 
---
It is. Better inventory I believe it's called. 
---
Defending that you like the game makes sense, yeah. I just think it's hard to defend the state of the game itself and Bethesda at this time. It seems to me that if they don't turn this game around big time, it's going to leave a huge stain on their reputation.
---
The ammo factory is usually a pvp hotspot tho 
---
I'd love a thread where all the various esoteric tips and hints for CAMP building were collected. Cause I need them all. Otherwise it's a case of butting my head against all the current, weird limitations until I want to throw an orbital beacon into the whole mess. 
---
It happens all the time. That you (and OP) are not paying attention to things does not mean it's not there and it certainly does not mean that I should do your homework for you.
---
Spend 5 minutes browsing some older posts and inform yourself.
---
I put a lamp on the desk and hop on top of it. Looks normal and gives you access.
---
No sadly.
---
Awesome CAMP dude. Seems like you found a nice little spot by that river there 
---
I need to post the video of my ground zero. Same spot but it blew me under the world. 
---
They're meant as distraction for enemies to attack as decoys. Doesn't exactly work well. At least they're fun looking. 
---
Ah, well it's probably better to be safe than sorry however but that's up to you.
---
Yesterday I got a leather coat as event reward from a surface to air event. Looks like [this one](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Leather_coat).
---
I Weapon Artisan them up to 200%, equip Gunsmith 5 and Luck Of The Draw 2. I get right about 6 cores (more than 100% full) out of one. And I always carry a spare in nuke zones.
---
Are some aspects of the game frustrating? Sure. But does the level of frustration you feel exceed the level of enjoyment?  It’s a personal decision and no one but you can make it.  For me, the enjoyment far exceeds the frustration so I keep playing until that ratio shifts.  
---
What really confuses me are the very vocal haters that continue griping on reddit and YouTube. They pour a whole lot of emotion and energy into a game they don’t like.  Log off and walk away - there is a lot more to life than a game that stresses you you.  
---
"dwindling player base" *citation needed* 
---
So you've found people that enjoy having you wreck their camps?
---
Lol.. I see what you mean. It's not meant to be can we not all just agree with what I say.. that would be stupid. But as far as there are many, what you could dare to call 'objective' problems with this game, can we not all just face facts? And at any rate, I don't expect people to agree with me anyway.. But yes, I was appealing and there was some bombast lol.
---
I am not a duper
---
Don't forget if the base was extravenegent you can use caps instead of resources to rebuild. 
---
If that's the amount of dupers (which is not) then yes please.
---
I can assure you inventory is not client side, enough said.
---
Bah no danger 
---
Did it work?
---
This is a lesson many people need to learn about things they dislike in general. Life is too short to focus on what you dislike. 
---
Can people please stop spreading this myth? Every time someone at Bethesda is asked about New Vegas in interviews they're very positive about it, there are multiple references to New Vegas in Fallout 4 and its DLCs, and several gameplay mechanics introduced in New Vegas were added to Fallout 4 (although I guess some are still upset that not *everything* from New Vegas was kept). 
---
I know it's fun to pretend there's drama and that Bethesda feels "slighted" by New Vegas's success, but there's zero evidence that this is the reality. 
---
experimenting with new builds, trying to chase down people who screw with my low level alt with my higher level main. ( I get attacked out of the blue a lot) [ server hopping doesn't have the ABC organization it used to
---
I have a 1 shot explosive SMG with armor piercing. It gives me a reason to pick up 10mm. Super fun gun to play with and I'd never sell it. 
---
No, it did not. Guess the gear has to actually have the weightless mod. So much for my urban combat sniper idea
---
Explosive zealots 50 cal. Spraying 200 rounds and then I can’t do anymore damage because of the bug so I reset and then teams doesn’t work so I cry for a bit and change to the broken automatic combat rifle which does like 90 dmg
---
This is the thing, if you’ve already loaded the cell once before on the server you’re playing the load time will usually be ten to thirty seconds tops, if you haven’t loaded the cell once before on the server the load time can be extremely inconsistent and can take up to a minute and thirty seconds.
---
Had my base here for a while actually, the dead radroach in the bathroom always seems to spawn a wedding ring as loot
---
I assume your understanding of irony is lacking. Complaining about people complaining makes you a complainer too except they have a valid reason to complain, unlike yourself.
---
Its annoying af... Pa, hazmat and gas mask should make it so you dont get diseases from mobs
---
lol how many times are people going to post the same subject. 
---
A legendary combat shotgun with quad ammo capacity.
---
This guy.
---
This guy gets it. 
---
I’m hoping for them to do damage control. I think that it’s critical. Turning the game around into something good and worthwhile would do a lot to salvage the goodwill they’ve lost.
---
"My homework"? Are you serious? I have been on this subreddit since I joined the game during beta. How do you think I came to think my initial statement was viable? Lots and lots of reading here. Like I said, show me a post ot just accept a different opinion than your own without trying to devalidate it by putting doubt on diligence and competence of the opinion giver.
---
Ammunition crafting area has a fusion generator that you can take the core from every so often :)
---
STOP HAVING FUN !
---
How does that meme go...
---
A big room, plenty of items... This is a boss battle.
---
Something like that :-)
---
You’re really good at setting up bate. I’d say that you’re a master bater. 
---
You can still log in ?
---
But again, it's like me now saying.. Hey, what's your deal? Why does what I'm doing bother you? Why are you talking to me right now? Things interest us, things bother us.. like clearly this right now interests/bothers you a little bit. And that's fine.. but it's just a strange tack to take with me. You're kind of proving the point for me!
---
Why do I need to let them be? Why does it bother you that I'm not letting them be? lol. I could say that to people spending time getting upset about "hater youtubers" or whatever.. C'mon guys, just let the haters be!
---
I'm not trying to obtuse here, I jsut really don't understand your argument. I've said why it bothers me.. I think it's bad to not see how bad of a state the game is in/be in denial about it.. and I think it's bad because we as consumers should want better.
---
Have mercy with the downvotes guys I don't make these items :'(
---
Did you try to loot the body laying in the street in the middle of town?
---
If so, it was a message saying something like "because of your perception, you notice something hidden inside of the body"
---
It's a warning that there is a mini nuke trap hidden inside the body, and that you should run
---
Yep, happened over and over again on xbox last night.
---
Thats so funny!! His reaction is even funnier!!
---
I’d like the ability to dilute them like normal
---
Stims 
---
I didn't, but I was near it. Guess that clears it up. Thanks.
---
I'll say it again, automatron deathmatch betting.
---
Probably to that Trapper body rigged to explode.  Part of a quest line.
---
true, and u know what, i dont really care, so i'll let you have your reasons, and ima move on.
---
Got a legendary double shot broadsides so happy
---
I do not condone cheating. I am asking because there was alot of talk about them finally taking action. I want to see if this is still the case, or if it was more misinformation.
---
Not saying that actually but thanks for your low effort input.
---
And how can you see this ?
---
haha, thats good one :')
---
I picked them up. Thank you mine now.
---
To disagree without being disagreeable seems to be a rare commodity in some communities, but especially in FO.
---
I have multiple lowbie alts that improve my atom points generation.
---
Thank you for this. Please update us again when the servers become more stable.
---
I haven't looked at mutations yet - currently level 64 (that's normal levelling by playing the quest line and not farming for XP). I know I need (and have) starched genes to keep it permanant and the 75% reduction of negative rad effects too. One thing I don't know is how u get ur mutations to be the ones u want? Or does every just take what they get?
---
Also, does using radaway remove a random mutation or does it do it in an order?
---
Proven to be fake
---
As much as people want, I guess.
---
Well I know for fact my was as I have not used the duped exploit in the game. None of them. I also have no dev room items as I have not played since it was found.
---
Put down your PA (as if you are going to equip it).  Remove every piece so that it's just a frame.  Go over to a PA stand, and then install the jetpack on the piece that is in your inventory (not on your frame).
---
Take a step back, look around to make sure you are alone, quickly slap all of your pieces back on, then recall your armor.
---
You lucky bastard, I've been hunting those for weeks
---
Are you asking how we can see if Beth is supporting fair play?
---
Heh, your moronic post was probably a great effort for you, much appreciated...
---
I found one in a container. My first after 50 levels. They are pretty rare i guess. 
---
I wish an exit log worked for me but i did that several times before deleting save data. The glotch was still going on this morning before i left for work. 
---
It's an old bug. Experienced it since before last patch.
---
For me it triggers when I select "Leave World" through the social tab.
---
Almost as beautiful as the Space Marines story 
---
And where can you see what Bethesda does.... ?
---
Absolutely. I'm excited by the possibilities but I worry not enough changes are going to be made, not enough time and money will be given to this project.
---
Not to mention, the bonus was exactly that, a *bonus*, and it was Bethesda's idea in the first place.
---
So yeah, Bethesda offered Obsidian a bonus, and then deliberately sabotaged a game *they published* so that they wouldn't have to pay it. Fuckin' genius.
---
What's funny is that no one at Obsidian is as salty about losing the bonus as the fanbase. They understood the deal and they didn't meet the agreed on score, and they took responsibility for New Vegas's buggy launch, which is the primary reason they didn't meet that score.
---
it matters because what those people are telling developers and publishers is that it is ok to release garbage filled to the brim with expensive mtx because it will be defended. 
---
In the armory please!
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Bastard! 
---
How so? I’ve never heard of this before?
---
Denial, not just a river in Egypt. 😳
---
TSE or even just E mini guns can kill people through slap damage VERY quickly.  I could see how people would think they were “one shot” if someone unloaded on them when they were in trade with a vendor, workshop mode or stuck on the loading screen.
---
My opinion stands and it is the truth in this case. Lots and lots of posts from people who started they like the game got downvoted. Not online here but also on our subs and other platforms like Imgur.
---
The fact that you haven't seen that does not change it. Also writing complicated sentences doesn't prove you're right. You're not, you are wrong. People get downvoted for liking the game, period.
---
Bags do not stay on the ground long, best bet next time is to shove them into any container or corpse. 
---
NP :)
---
Ah gotchya, thanks. 
---
Cool, I'll add you to the group chat we just started
---
Sometimes i have yes.  SamuelV87 is my user. Add me
---
It seems to drop everywhere, also piss easy to craft, what seems to be the problem, why the begging ?
---
Glad I can help. :)
---
Looks awesome! cant find where it is and want to build my camp there too :)  
---
Can you help me with he location?
---
I was at Whiteprings Vendor, the one outside the other day, Ran out and a play ran right passed me. We both stopped, turned and hilariously, at exactly the same time, used the exact same emote - it was so perfect synchronised swimmers were in awe of us. He was only level 19 so I droppped him half my stim packs.
---
At a station the other day in a blue lunch box I found 3 ragnarok magazines and some stim packs. I loved finding that more than anything in the game I've found so far except :)
---
just allow all cards to be active. or dump SPECIAL altogether for something like skyrim. where using items or doing certain things raises the skill. For example. using a certain weapon class raise your skill with them. Pounding chems will slowly make you more resistant. Setting yourself on fire will build your fire resistance. Using PA will increase your efficiency with it.
---
Then why didn't you READ it!? Would have taken less time than making this thread.
---
If they cared about the state of the game, they would make it clear they do not support cheating and are clearly enforcing bans. I'm asking for any type of proof of this besides a few youtubers. There are alot of people on here afraid of getting banned from trading the wrong items. There is nothing wrong with asking for clarity or evidence.
---
Lol at this comment getting downvoted. People are always upset with anything that invades their mental safe space. Dramatic is right. The title of the post could have been a positive spin on rifles but nah, they make a clickbait title that’s just begging for attention. 👌🏿
---
It’s just interesting, this whole fair play thing.  Bethesda was built on and kept alive so long by modest and those that exploit the game.  Now that fallout is online, everyone who is using game mechanics for an edge, have people wanting them banned. 
---
I just don’t think Bethesda will do anything. As many of the their customers over the years are okay with anything that will help them have more fun in thewasteland. 
---
Budget, you dig ? Future content, comprendo ?
---
LOL
---
Actually that's **The Final Pam's** house and I don't think she takes well to squatters. 
---
Cheers, little annoyed at losing my favourite weapon, Big Rise
---
No, presenting an argument does. Just writing "I am right right, you are wrong. Mine is the truth" does not.
---
I hope the pvp systems are overhauled soon.
---
A few ideas:
---
*balance weapon damage( even remove legendary effects complety).
---
*open pvp servers(no restrictions, kill pr be killed)
---
*faction based pvp
---
*overhaul looting system and make map resources more finite. Let us take more than dropped junk there's a whole corpse loaded with ammo and weapons and chem. 
---
*HARDCORE mode/servers. Open pvp, ability to loot full inventory(this is my biggest wish!!!)
---
Cmon, baby steps...we're getting there, a few more posts and you will figure out where to get official information. Don't give up, i can see that you have potential.
---
The ban everyone atm. Never duped, buying selling things via trade chats in discord, accepting giveaways sometimes and yet account suspended. Woke up today and account not working, can't log in. I did buy TSE guns for caps. Guess all who did will be banned, who than will play the game?
---
I feel the same way.. but I don't know if you think I fall in to this category or not lol. I certainly don't mean to.. I'm having civilised conversation with people in the comments and have done many times before over this game. So as much as I might disagree or care about something people think I shouldn't/don't want me to.. I absolutely don't see a reason why we can't all be civil.
---
I look forward to the obligatory accusation that I'm a karma farming troll, which is what I've goteen before, even though I'm only going to be downvoted here lol.
---
While I still cook food because it's muscle memory to collect all cooking ingredients in fo4, I mostly survive off of dog food with the good doggy perk card. 75 hunger! 
---
I don't have materials to build ammo and it takes forever to find it from dead bodies.. 
---
Snooze you loose
---
Sometimes it's hard not to let that crap get you down. Not everybody is in a place mentally where they can just shrug it off. I've had some serious depression for a while now and those kind of interactions definitely affect me more. A player made me cry a couple days ago.
---
I got an alert that my base was under attack. When I was finally done I fast traveled over to see what happened. I had built a huge farm, open to everyone, where folks can get food, sleep, water, starch, crafting, whatever they need. Some asshole trashed everything but the walls and floors (60+ plants, 3 water purifiers, every light and stick of furniture, etc) and then left. I was gutted. Worst part was that he destroyed my decontamination shower. I don't need it; I put it there for others. 3 days later I finally have all the flux I need to fix it, but after that I kinda feel like repairing it would just be a waste of my hard-won resources.
---
Pvp I get. Competition over workshops, sure. But the maliciousness of just trashing something someone clearly worked so hard on (when you don't even know them or have a problem with them) is just fucked up, and it feels pretty shitty to be on the receiving end. That said, that experience was the only one I've had like it in 3 months. Most players are surprisingly kind and helpful, and that makes me want to be the same.
---
Just like you are doing right? I haven't seen it so it's not there.
---
So you want us to play the game for you ? Is that it ?
---
Yep 14 caps each. I sell about 3-6 each time.
---
Makes me wonder if you can squeeze in a CAMP and them erect walls in front of their launchers.
---
Maybe you can also shoot the mobs for him with that ammo ? Cmon, it takes forever to go out, find them, aim etc....
---
Because it doesn't actually fit when you get into the power armor but the game is nice and doesn't make you unequip it first.
---
It comes back to individuals and how they individually feel about the game VS a collective mentality and what these individuals don’t understand about this broken game is it sets a precedence for future games where developers think it’s okay to release a game in a pre alpha state when it’s not and charging full price for it.
---
It’s a greedy, scummy act.
---
If they would care about the game they would fix it properly instead of punishing people for doing QA's job for them. If you bought TSE gun lately you might get banned too. So it seems.
---
I didn't even slam the fella. 😧
---
There's a strange dichotomy in Bethesda's decision making process regarding the development of newer Fallout games that tiptoe around Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas, and I'm not sure I understand why. It seems to me that in recent years there's been someone at the helm whose mantra is "we're a company first and a group of artists second, if we don't make money, we don't make games" and that's completely understandable. Then, a decision to not make items people would scramble over themselves to buy is made, and the only reason I can fathom why they would've decided against it is because they consider themselves artists who refuse to draw someone else's characters.  
---
This isn't even limited to Fallout New Vegas. I would wear Fallout 3 style combat armor or the Pint Sized Slasher mask if they were available in 76, but they aren't.
---
This happens to me too. Very very rarely it'll pop up in pip boy as done.
---
That's for alien blaster ammunitions , I already have this one, that's not the same one
---
I don't know why I even expected to get real information of this game from this sub.
---
I love this post, and if you're on PS4 and want to play together sometime hit me up! Open invitation to anyone else as well :)
---
She likes pvp but when she is a measly level 35, it’s kind of not much of a fight, more of a slaughter!
---
Jesus man, I play every day and I'm only at 350 hours, well done sir, well done 👏
---
I'm not trying to get you to drop the game. And maybe you're not the sort of person my post was directed to if you know there's a lot wrong with it.
---
I paid full price for this game.. so for the reason, as well as others, I can assure you I want to see it succeed too.
---
A massive thank you to all of you for supporting this idea.
---
And thanks you so much much for gold 😁
---
That's fair.
---
LOL yes! I think those frogs are cool and they show up elsewhere. I like the Oppossum's and beavers too. The squirrels look wrong but none of those level 1 friendlies get killed by me. 
---
+karma for nice puns
---
The alien blaster cells are at the Black Mountain Ordinance works, near Deathclaw Island. If you go south from there, you will encounter TNT Dome 2, which you need a key from the Mount Blair trainyard. Search it up on YT
---
Ah.. the troll comment.. I was waiting for this. Tell me, am I farming karma with all the downvotes I'm getting?
---
Jog on.
---
"Did you throw this gold shotgun or this silver shotgun?"
---
No but there is lots of players who like to help people so i wanted to ask if anyone can help me... Like one time there was this guy who gave ammo and other stuff to others because he liked helping them 
---
How long would they stay in a container?  until logging off???
---
What are you on about?
---
So an explosive 2 shot explosive?
---
Look I dislike duping and even worse selling glitched dupe items for real money but really can't get behind the "it destroys the economy" chant. I also don't mind that everyone has got duped TSEs. I don't find it a problem.
---
The thing is I'm curious to know how they will be checking for duped items before any ban happens. How to they tell the difference between real and accidentally duping items. I know I've duped stimpacks while trading them to a mate before a raid, unintentionally. And duped acid before it was pointed out it was a glitch.
---
Personally I don't believe anything will be done about it and just hope 1)content update makes it meh and 2)hope they release a better product when Fallout 76/2 comes around. 
---
I completely agree.
---
"The issue is not, and has never been, whether a person enjoys the game.."
---
Really? Thank you so much for educating me. I'll now stop playing the game I've been happily enjoying since the Beta.
---
Thank god for Big Brained Redditors like yourself.
---
FWIW, I think if it’s not available in atom cafe or  in game awards, it’s safe to say, it’s contraband.
---
Off Topic: I submitted a service ticket to bethesda about ingame issue, order of mysteries and was asked if I had any mods installed. Lolz
---
We ended up doing a lot of claiming workshops to get the industrial walls , we ended up buying the metal walls from the white springs bunker 
---
Did that yesterday and its getting foreward :)   
---
Progress eems better now! thanks for the advice
---
Erm.. I don't want you to stop playing the game. I play the game too.. or try to at least.
---
Sorry if I say this, and I don't want to be offending, but this is stupid. There were no (just an example) pipe-guns in FO3 or NV and still no one was complaining when Fallout 4 was introducing them. "Branding" doesn't mean you're not allowed to introduce something new.
---
It breaks the little design rule they seem to have where they only exist at red rockets, train stations or player built.
---
The link doesn't work
---
&gt;can we not all agree...
---
No, we can't. 
---
lol OK
---
Have met two of them at once just wandering in Savage Divide forests near Blackwater Mine  I think. Daytime. Attacked, almost got my ass handed to me in a bag.
---
I was asking for actual examples - which you apparently cannot provide. You just keep repeating the same unsubstantiated statements.
---
I am interested too
---
Id be interested in seeing how much addiction helps the junkies weapons.  
---
yea right
---
Very

Undercover Bethesda employee account attempting to make us throw our overpowered/duped guns in the lake!!! 
---
Exposed!
---
Just did Always Vigilant, completed, got rewards and still doesnt show on the pip boy. Incredible.
---
I thought you could dilute SuperStims to make regular Stims.
---
Often I lose things from a bag whether I put it there or had deaths. Happens the worst of more things kill me a few times while I’m trying to get to it. Seems to be a bug
---
I was for a while. Two of the events occurred in proximity of those camps.  I assumed that attracted attention. Either way , pacifist mode doesn’t deactivate.   In other words , even my turrets do minor damage to someone attempting to take over the camp
---
I only did those for the blueprint drop anyway. 
---
The crashed spacestation up by the water park code is the release date of fo76
---
That's not in the loot table for console 
---
I’d contact bethesda and see about dates and times for logins
---
Mine and my Bro's acc were banned, non of us ever duped. Bro did buy marine helmet for caps yesterday, we didn't know it was from dev room. I'm simply trading in discord for caps and playing the game. Yet both accs suspended for duplication. We both on PC. Yet a mate i have who plays on PS4 is duping like crazy for months and not still banned. So it seems they banning PC players mostly. 
---
They still give 10 when not powered. Each powerplant has a map in the office showing what workshops that plant powers.
---
This all might be true, but it is still a buggy game with a bad balancing and a very repetitive mid- to endgame gameplay. No need to organize efforts or even sabotage it.
---
Have you tried without mods ?
---
Apparently we can add "toxic community" to the long list of problems with the game.
---
Desperately hope they increase the budget soon... I've spent a hideous amount of time on my CAMP and would love to add another couple of buildings to it.
---
I'm dumfounded that there was an agreement to make none pvp players take any damage at all. Is there any part of this game that works 100% how it's meant to?
---
I recall stating that I'm not going to do your homework for you. The examples are out there and plenty of em as well. Good luck.
---
Bump

WV lumber mill toxic valley and Grafton

And Grafton steel mill is what I’m grinding on
---
when I hit 25 going to complete mysteries quest 
---
Actually if they fix the weapons through extra perks it is a downside because you need extra perks for them to be viable 
---
I think there are many things *mildly* wrong with 76 but nothing that has been game breaking, ruined my fun or forced me to put the game away in frustration. I wish it ran more smoothly, but I don't see the game as *broken* in the sense that it is still very playable and enjoyable. 
---
Just my opinion. 
---
it's kinda ridicoulus that a wooden gun wth nails is better than a high tech military weaponi
---
I’d fucking love it if this was in the game, but I don’t think it’ll be added due to the lore reason of it being Riot Control Arnie for the LAPD. The police departments on the east coast don’t even seem to have Riot armor, and if they did I’d assume it’s something like the Covenant Security Armor from Fallout 4.
---
I found this out the other day and absolutely lost it in a fit of giggles 
---
They are pretty high lolz
---
There a ghoul lookout just above whitespring and those guys are MEAN AF. Lvl6X? I think when I first tried w/main toon
---
what's the point tho
---
I can spare some. I'll be on tonight uk time about 8.30pm onwards
---
Post pic if its revolver. 
---
I have it at 13 since I'm a heavy weapon build.
---
Use the secret passage on third floor. Faster.
---
Then why exactly are you arguing with me? I stated my opinion, you stated yours. You are not willing to substantiate your statements and instead belittle or generally try to dis me. And - again iro ically- I recall stating that this exactly the kind of behaviour the OP was complaining about.
---
that's pretty rad.
---
Bethesda bad CD projekt red good give me upvotes
---
I feel like crafting a dozen or so gamma guns and dropping them during the next SBQ and letting nature take it's course.
---
[](/gummystare)
---
Can't get to the map.
---
True, but maybe with enough attention to a post like this one Bethesda will take action.
---
In Appalachia, you don’t choose shotgun
---
Shotgun chooses you 
---
that makes your grind worthy of your time.. ain't it a chunk of time to your life?
---
&gt;professional jealousy
---
Looking at reviews, sales, total hours played, peak concurrent users, basically *any* measurable metric, new Vegas fell short of fallout 3, and was absolutely crushed by 4. Yes, there's a really vocal part of the fan base on the internet that worships NV and criticises everything Bethesda does, but they're a drop in the bucket compared to the overall fans.
---
Normal, should re-equip after exiting power armor
---
if i swap out lockpick and hacker cards the enemies will respawn so i just have to start it again
---
Cheers bud
---
No dailies then. How about the unique low level ones for doing story quests, etc?
---
Around this level I found it best to hang out in the forest area, as the other areas seemed a little tough. I took over two workshops, Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm and Billings Homestead. The spawns in this area are usually low level scorched and I was able to rack up some good xp. In between the “defend” quests, I would venture out to do events in that area, Messenger, Powering Up Poseidon etc. 
---
That's anecdotal evidence of a non existant problem. 
---
It's asking for a login
---
Did you get the Combat Armor Dense mod at Watoga?
---
Got ya covered, I won't be on for about another 7 hours or so. 
---
Well they are coming out with a DLC so hopefully we’ll get some new content then
---
That's some rare and expensive ammo 
---
Yeah. I think one of the issues within the community about the sort of thing I'm talking about is that we've all had different experiences of the game "broken" wise.. some have been more lucky than others. Additionally, our experience of the game changes over time.. For me, it got worse after release with subsequent patches before it got better. Then it might depend on what world you happen to land in and how much duping is going on. The latest patch has clearly broken the game for many console players with constant crashing.
---
Maybe this all adds to us having such divergent opinions as to the state of the game.
---
p.s. Ha.. I actually saw your original comment :p.. I much prefer this one :)
---
A mule is another character you create then you use a buddy to hold the stuff log in the new char and put it on the newly created character 
---
I had a stack of 200 and just ended up dropping them in a paper bag.  
---
Farming whitespring that early in the game is a sure fire way to burn yourself out quick.  Follow the quest lines, and explore every undiscovered location you see on your HUD, listen to the holotapes, partner up a stranger to beat down a whole camp of super mutants that’s blocking your path to a quest objective.  Lots to do in this game besides farm exp and legendary golf clubs. 
---
Overall not a bad post but I take issue with this:
---
&gt; Yes, you can say buying a TSE weapon that's likely duped is still partaking in the cheating because they are only so cheap because of duping, but you're not entirely right either. Even before the mass outbreak of duping, back when TSEs were rare and far between, people were selling top tier ones for 15000-20000 caps. That's two weeks' worth of just selling random crap you come across to vendors. Easily less than a week if you sell some decent legendaries and plans that you come across throughout normal play to other players. Even without duping, TSEs would be fairly accessible to those who want them and have the caps to buy them. I can't prove this in any way, but I believe that most of the duped TSEs are funneled into the disgusting real money resellers and not into people selling for caps; after all, anybody with 40 duped TSE handmades also has 600000 duped nuka colas they can pop for caps at any time. You have absolutely no way of knowing how somebody got their item and have no right to pass judgments on them based on their gear alone. 
---
This reads like you're a duper apologist. It looks like you're making excuses to muddy the waters in favour of the dupers. Not say that's your intended goal but uncertainty and doubt work as great cover.
---
In my eyes, anyone with a TSE should be looked upon with suspicion in much the same way an old man seen constantly in the company of young teenage girls can draw similar suspicion. 
---
Not to say you should vilify TSE owners or hunt them down incessantly (though this sort of thing is a game mechanic so make your own moral choice on that one...). Looks like we agree on that point. However, we shouldn't just hand wave the potential issue as to why someone may have a TSE weapon.
---
Think of the condition required to get to a TSE and then the odds of that. You need to stack 2 specific legendary effect onto the same weapon. Odds are already low just to get 1 of those 2 legendary effects. To have both effects on much sort after weapons at the frequency that we appear to be seeing them...? 
---
Odds are higher that the item was gotten illegitimately, either through duping or purchase from a duper (in-game or real world) than it was found legitimately. It should be look upon as such because if you do, odds are you'd likely be right.
---
Once again, not condoning vigilantism or harrassment but it's at least worthy of being looked at unfavourably or even worth reporting. Might be nothing but that's Bethesda's problem to solve, much the same way you might report that old man. 
---
Go away 
---
So, a character to just store the shit you don’t want?
---
Fat fingers will fuck ya sometimes. I just spam the record last 30 seconds button if something fishy happens. 
---
Absolutely agree.
---
I convert ALL my superstimpacks in caps, it's the highest value free thing I never use and that I keep getting. I do around 5 SBQ per day, that's already 30 super stimpacks I need to dump through vendors.
---
SHAME! Shame on you for not having the same problems that other players are experiencing. How dare you attempt to enjoy a game that you've been told is completely broken and unplayable. 
---
LOL!!!  Awesome story!!
---
Nice try
---
A wooden board does more than the high tech plasma and laser guns 
---
I’m not meaning to rush, just get a few levels to 20 or so and be on my way questing again
---
Yes please put stuff from the better game in this one.
---
Also, youre never going to get New Vegas stuff back. Its clearly an artistic and design direction Bethesda doesnt want to go. Community begging be dammned.
---
 *wasted two disease cures while the server crashed. Do you know how hard it is for me to find those for some reason?!?!* 
---
Equip Green thumb card then run up the river bank near the overseers CAMP near vault 76. Look for the bright orange firecap mushrroms on the banks and grab the bloodleaf and snaptail by the waters edge which makes disease cures. 
---
Me and my 2 mates hadn't found a disease cure for the last 3 days gameplay. So whilst i'm farming these ingredients, FO76 decided to troll me and I found one as I'm running up the river. Then an hour later after making 18 of them I find 2 more....go figure.... LOL
---
lol, right? But this other dude has 10 of them 'just from trading'. 
---
No thanks. That server issue you seem to prefer usually happens when I midway through an event. I’d rather wait to load than get dumped out and lose progress. 
---
Friendly reminder that the fountain near the golf club remove diseases. While you cycle through spawns, it cost nothing to drink a second there
---
You can already do this, actually. Just put down a door wall, put a door on it, then change it to a normal wall. Can even put letters on the inside.
---
Baby gamers need all the help they can get. Actually, real gamers take on a SB with a wooden spoon....
---
Ik, it's incredibly rare drop, i just got tired of completing events for hours
---
Bro just go into the Whitespring shopping mall. There's a store with every work bench and stash boxes...
---
The point of this kind of camp isn't to one shot anything in the first place.  All they do is just enough splash damage to tag everything that runs by the windows when someone else comes by to clear the building letting the builder loot the corpses without having to actually put in any work and in the process usually lag the shit out of the person actually running through the building and killing stuff with all of the explosions going off.
---
I think the problem is that the safes don't contain legendaries items...i mean a lvl 3 safe has to be valuable but it's not. Put legendaries items in the high level safes and see how those perks will become a must have perks
---
It's a second account or character that you use to store extra junk, weapons, whatever.
---
Like a pack mule.
---
You either need a friend you can trust to help you transfer between your characters, or if you have anothet computer, buy a second account and use that. (how I do it)
---
When my stash gets full, I take half of every junk item and Chem and move it to my mule.
---
Question, where?
---
in other games ballistic weapons had separate perks as well though. now that there are no ballistic-specific perks there's no reason for energy to have them.
---
energy weapons need buffs and only buffs.
---
give them just perks and it'd unfair to require energy weapon users to use extra perks to be as good as ballistics. give them both buffs and energy-exclusive perks and you'd just flip the balance problem on its head and would get requests for ballistic-specific perks.
---
The late game challenge is to buy atoms silly.
---
No, you store the stuff you want and don't have room for.
---
You sell the stuff you don't want or drop it. 
---
Many other games have done this too... I was just suggesting that they had a starting point from which to begin.
---
Yeah some use it to hold there evil dipped goods or caps they have earned etc etc
---
Proof
---
level 55 never seen a chainsaw, no way there's chainsaws in this game
---
Man i got ultracite comin out of the wazoo... but ill heav to try that for cobalt next time
---
There's already one in the resort. That's why I'm against it, I already hate when a game has 2-4 "OP areas" convenience wise and that it kind of becomes a waste of time to go anywhere else. 
---
One shot through slap damage exists, same with infinite health.
---
webm1:
---
https://my.mixtape.moe/bhotjo.webm
---
webm2:
---
https://my.mixtape.moe/ogyaql.webm
---
webm1: I have pacifist off and shoot a two shot fatman at the cheater, who takes no damage. You can tell the pacifist is off because it says on the bottom "Attacking" instead of "Pacifist is enabled, you're not doing damage to players" in the left top corner.
---
webm2: Again, pacifist is off (with pacifist off you can't even initiate PvP combat with a wanted player, I have experienced it multiple times through forgetting to take pacifist off while going after a non-cheating player with a bounty, and they won't be able to do pvp damage until you take pacifist off and damage them). I miss all my attacks which is the key point here because if I didn't miss then it would once again say "Attacking: &lt;cheater name&gt;" like it does in webm1 when I shoot at the player and it registers my hit. I haven't fired at the player prior to being killed through protection, I'm not seeking revenge (which enables pvp damage without first shot protection) and I'm simply going after a player with a bounty which means you do full damage with your first shot, and I was trying to get a sneak attack with a melee weapon while he runs around, if I had gotten it off he would eihter have taken enough damage to be downed instantly, as I have not damaged him (clearly visible since it doesn't show the attacking popup) and I'm simply going after a wanted player I have full pvp protection and still I get downed in single shot.
---
tldr bethesda pls fix ur game
---
You are assuming I am saying +dmg perks. I mean more unique perks kind of like incisor. 
---
If you insist....watch the map to see when a small group of level 50+ are at the golf clubhouse.  Join them and tag as many ghouls as possible to leech exp.  stash all your junk before you go and don’t worry about a few deaths.  
---
Well everyone I know personally has, so small sameple size and empirical evidence but of all the people I know personally and all the friends I have made online 100% of them bought their TSEs and given the rate of people with multiple items, not only TSEs but also stacks of consumables shows the sellers are almost exclusively dupers.
---
If you want to try downplay that as "not having stats" then whatever. 
---
They don't have the infrastructure lol?????? ***Have you ever played ESO???***
---
I reevaluated what I wanted to say, being snarky isn't always the best. 
---
Performance issues are odd, since release things have only gotten better for me with every patch on PC. 
---
I had this happen several times yesterday.. I was loading in behind the whitesprings bunker service entrance. It seems it would freeze if I tried to open my pip boy too quickly after appearing and not everything had actually loaded. 
---
Exactly same thing for me. Linked to taking out my pip boy. 
---
I didn't open it .... correcthorsebatterystaple .... time to check if i remembered
---
That is incredible. Nice work!
---
I would hot somewhere else
---
"I don't like something so everyone who does is wrong." 
---
That's what you sound like right now.
---
There's a shit ton wrong with this game, but there's also a few things that make it worth playing to me. I also know there's many reasons the game is not enjoyable to others. People who are enjoying the game are not wrong. People who aren't enjoying the game aren't wrong either.
---
See, that's not so hard?
---
That is one of the most satisfying quests for sure, but not as immersive as the dmv one hahA
---
Thats the whole point of this thread so people dont have to go the resort. There is a massive workshop in the bunker but not a single stashbox to access stored stash. Its a headach having to go through two loading screens if you need items from stash for whatever rrason you need them while in the bunk. Idk it sounds like a great idea to me to hace one there, and like ive saud previously ive been in there many times and needed one and wished there was one right were all those workbenches are
---
Well that's just the local wild life for ya.
---
What is this quest you speak of?
---
Fallout 76 turned me into a newt!
---
I think Tanagra Town also has a lot of Brain Fungus, so it would be a good source for Crimson Flux too, aside from Cave Crickets and one boss enemy though, there's not much else there.
---
Youre welcome dude feel free to pm me if you have any more doubts :)
---
Come on dude. This is just derivative.
---
If you're going to come at the game or the sub, at least come with something original or something interesting to discuss.
---
Pint sized slasher is in the creation club on fallout 4 get the whole outfit and a quest.
---
Platform?
---
It's where you make a new character and put all your med-x up their butt to smuggle it into prison
---
also put a shop terminal in the closed off area in the service entrance so we don't have to zone in to just buy basic items or sell things as when the servers are weird it takes forever to zone in and zone out some days 
---
You're clearly modding the head of the the sentry bot to be able to wear it, idk why it's unreasonable to think you could add some air filter 
---
It’s from stacking bobble heads. You do like 1% damage from slap, but apparently if you stack enough bobble heads with a 3 star TSE weapon among other things that 1% damage can be like 1,000,000 damage or whatever. That’s what I’ve seen explained a few times. I wouldn’t discredit that
---
I would like to see a change to the furious perk. Make it's so that it prices on actual hits and not power attacks
---
Yes. I understand for you it seems like newer due to they just posted it out. But that actually is an old method known for awhile but tedious to execute so people used the new method (old method for you) to dupe which is much easier and don’t need to crash the server. 
---
Well that's disappointing.
---
As if having little shits using explosive weapons in legendary farming areas isn't annoying enough, now I need to constantly worry if some random event that I enter is going to force me into PVP where a little shit is hiding behind a wall in chameleon armor with a duped one shot explosive weapon.
---
Events need to be more descriptive. Is this PVP? Can a solo player do this event or is it just going to be a waste of time and resources for me to try?
---
Yea I did that as well but moved the items on my alt.Don't see the point of throwing them away.Also how much for the two shot hunting rifle?
---
The evil dipped chips... dripping with slasa!
---
I swear there is a stash box in the bunker, it was kind of hidden and annoying to get to. When I get home tonight ill find the exact spot. 
---
Some helpful info. Thanks for the replies vault dwellers. 
---
How much you looking for?
---
I'd like to also add:
---
* While running/sprinting, in the lower left corner the HP letters seem to "split" or lag, similar to the visual artifacts from the Power Armor patch (12/11/18). 
---
3k in caps
---
No the easiest is just getting on one
---
Really!!!! If there is please share we would all ove to know
---
Alright thanks. I have trouble grasping the progress of this game. I’ve played many mmo’s where it’s usually “go to this zone, complete all the quests then move to a new zone and repeat”
---
Claim and defend workshops.
---
If you've maxed out caps and are only level 50 I'd be willing to bet there are parts of the game you haven't even seen yet
---
I thought herbivore made it 3x the benifits.
---
They are suspending accounts that have items from the dev room in the game, if you had anything that isnt supposed to be out yet they would’ve suspended your account.
---
Ok so on xb1 and ps4 (sadly my pc is dead compliments of a angry hacker 😂)
---
Can someone break down the whole purpose of diluting stimpacks? I mean I have looked at what they do and to me it just seems like diluting normal stimpacks only makes them heal you for less. Which was stupid imo. Normally diluted things such as (alcohol) while they arent as steong tend to have longer lasting effects. The game doesn't really specify if the healing burst last longer or if it is the same amount as the original stimpack. So......idk why anyone would dilute them
---
Good to hear, having only recently turned to heavy weapons I’m now investing heavily in the Stabalised perk (have lvl one of each of the heavy gunner perks for the extra 30% damage) , hoping that with all that armour ignoring potential and the Furious Gatling that dropped for me recently I can do some serious damage, need to extend the range on it though so il have to find some to scrap for mods.
---
I had my camp set up there for time... until I loaded in to it getting absolutely destroyed by 2 scorchbeasts, naturally, being lvl 17 at the time I tried to run when, low and behold, a legendary deathclaw appeared and just down the way was a mothman, I didn't survive much longer. Changed servers and reloaded back in to the shell of my former camp... never again.
---
Not corpse, they also disappear 
---
I think people just want reasons to justify why they don't like the game. If something doesn't work it's bugged. If an item disappears then someone stole it from them. 
---
I've accidentally sold my armor more times than I can count, Bethesda plz, but I never would have chalked it up to "oh that trade I did the guy must have stolen all my armor somehow, stupid broken game".
---
Where do you find 5 SBQs a day? Just server hopping?
---
I currently have the handmade with Hardened receiver which is the very highest semi-auto damage.   Plus short stablized barrel (-recoil, less AP per shot), Dot Glow Sites (I think because has less AP useage), Forget stock, but something to stablize recoil.  Perferating Magazine for + ammo capacity and Penetration.

I can fire quite fast and smooth with it now at high damage.   I am realigning my build slowly toward more crit-based and once that is done, I will go full auto perks.   Thus there will be faster firing and extra damage coming from the crits.    Should be able to achieve higher dmg but twice the bullets.

This is why now that I have the power to nuke things to hell, I'm going to nuke the dmv for payback 
---
I could see a riot armor though in the game just probably not that armor since it was made after the war 
---
that said I'd love to see riot armor / vault tech security armor in the game
---
that said if I could only have 1 armor and 1 alone to be added - environmental protection armor from fallout tactics - basically a armored hazmat suit - which would be so nice to have since the only options for several zones is hazmat or power armor making PA significantly more attractive for most players 
---
I've found them in various containers. Pretty rare. And the part about suppressing diseases sure doesn't help at White Springs. 
---
People keep bringing this up.
---
I get that swapping perks can be annoying but I don't think it should be easy to just swap out perks either.
---
It should be a choice as to what you focus on. Do you lean combat heavy, crafting/survival or somewhere in-between?
---
There should be friction with making changes. Maybe not as much as there currently is but I'm not onboard the whole idea of separate combat and survival perk buckets (for lack of a better term) or non-combat perks being passive (another popular version).
---
The game cant exploit itself. It takes a selfish and shitty kind of human to exploit. 
---
2 examples of being killed through slap dmg in one hit

---
I have my doubts about it, I burn screws for nothing too. By the way, I can’t find night visions for the handmade either.
---
go to the summer villa east of the capitol building inside there you will find a female corpse wearing a black and green dress loot the holotape and veil from her body to start one of the coolest missions in the game. Which gives you 2 unique weapons, a unique stealthboy recipe and unique armour.
---
I agree you can do this with almost any gun with enough Bobblehead stacking, I am talking about without ANY TSE or Bobblehead stacking.
---
I don't know about not ps4 pro, but on that even a first time loading an area up doesn't take longer than 20 seconds for me. Those 20 seconds feel like 5 minutes though when you have limited time to play haha
---
i'm not assuming +dmg perks, accuracy or other perks work just as well for my point.
---
also, incisor is a bad perk to give as an example because it affects both melee types (regular melee and unarmed), so it's an example of a perk that isnt type-specific and still perfectly desirable.
---
a much better example would've been the tank killer perk, because (i'm assuming) it only effects ballistic resist. i think that it should effect all damage resistances (including rads, as used by the radium rifle) though since that widens the scope of weapons and builds people can use and doesnt require creating an equivalent perk for the other resistance(s)...
---
You got a drill shit that rare
---
Hahahahahahahs 65% hahahahahaha
---
Thank you for mentioning the stone part. I was looking for a wood gazebo when it was first mentioned since most of the gazebo in the real world are made of wood. I'm not smart lol.
---
I lost a lot of junks due to this bug. It's been there since beta. Now I always store all the junks into my stash box incase something urgent comes up.
---
I wish I could use the junk to make placeable decorations ala OCDecorator. 
---
Even if it took a few extra parts. Like maybe a teddy, a rocket, a truck, some wood and plastic scraps could make a placeable, static "pile of toys". Same with books, desk clutter, dishes, etc.
---
You have to complete the events related to powering up the power plants. You get a different generator plan everytime you do it. 
---
Herbivore will only double the food effect of soups. I found it much more limiting then Carnivore. You can still get the water and special effects of soups/juice while using Carnivore and you can also fill your food up with any raw meat you find (40% for glowing meat). 
---
The fusion core generator generates 100 power for your camp, not fusion cores. The only way to generate fusion cores is at a power plant workshop. You can get the plans for the fusion core power generator from the "power up x" events at the power plants. 
---
People like lore in Fallout games. That's why they are there.
---
Nah. Some of us just really liked the building part of 4 and wish some of the options carried over.
---
U get the generator plans by doing the event where you restore power to the powerplants. It's an event reward.
---
Never heard of them being available for camps outside of Workshops. Do you have any photo evidence of this?
---
If you have a hazmat suit, go into a Whitespringa nuke zone, then drag the ghouls to the robots. Worked for me.
---
You da real mvp
---
You can keep your advanced power armor technology. I just want my barn building plans...
---
Not true,  faschnacht(sp) masks can be found at the Asylum everytime i have been there.  
---
I actually found two two-shot hunting rifles. 96% sure I kept the other. You can have it for nothing if its still in my stashbox, but I dunno when Im online again. Kids, wife, job etc. 
---
Two shot rifles dont work very well in VATS, btw. 
---
hey sorry for the late reply. atm we dont have any ps4 builders. sorry but when we get one ill let you know. 
---
Yea i know.Can't take it for free tho.Let's talk on reddit direct chat.
---
Bethesda really has to balance explosive legendary modifiers to be a nice little boost in damage, not one that pretty much wipes everything off the map.  An explosive shotgun/rifle makes the fat man seem weak in comparison.  Its a wonder they haven't already done a major balance pass on it.
---
Some of the other modifiers like 25% faster ROF should be supreme boss killers, so explosive when its properly balance, should provide like 10% increased DPS for a weapon even with all perks.  Ie. nice to have, but not game breaking.
---
I mean if there was a handy dead Raider nearby, not meat piles. 
---
Iv been buying large quantities and dropping them in the middle of a body of water. Same for tse explosive weapons.
---
does the dropbox link work?
---
There's no reason to have a cash store other than for greed. All the stuff in a game that we paid for doesn't then need to make more revenue on stuff that was free in the previous game. It doesn't add any fun and they are massively overpriced. They made more than enough money on the game but they want more and sadly, some people are quite happy to be ripped off or go along with a practice that is ruining the games industry.
---
A cash shop adds nothing to the game on items that you should be able to easily earn in the game or make yourself rather than deliberately make the game grindy and boring and preying on people with addiction issues.
---
AFAIK - FO4 didn't have a cash shop and you didn't need to buy or grind to get those parts? Anyone want to make a case how Fallout 4 was LESS fun because there was no cash shop?
---
I've done 3 sbq on a single server and let me tell you, the lag... Oh the lag. The third was the worst obviously, but after that I usually do one and switch servers. 
---
Last night my brother and I downed sbq, went to the next silo and the reactor section couldn't process the repairs the server was so bad. 😥
---
Called it a night. 
---
The most tedious quest certainly .... and entirely dumb as any non US don't care about your DMV jokes....
---
I have lost several times because the server gets flooded with low levels who either hid in the shack or military camp. 
---
Not sure if they would stay there that long, but you could do that and then hurry back and fast travel to it before someone else discovers it.
---
Capitol building in graft on?
---
You’re probably right, I run a ps4 pro but looking back at this I’m starting to think that load times are consistent with your network speeds in which case I could see why it takes so long for me, but still I do not know exactly.
---
Maybe my system is just really slow at processing files lol.
---
Stop going into the bunker to craft?
---
It's like having the option of jumping into water or lava. You choose the lava then complain about how it burns.
---
Oh yeah there's that crafter's shop in the Whitespring... Welp nevermind
---
You seem to have misunderstood something somewhere. 
---
The fusion generators at CAMPs only supply 100 power. They do not supply cores.
---
The power plant workshops have the core makers.
---
also can get a lot in Welch and at the tents next to Poseidon power plant
---
Yeah, it’s some bullshit they don’t charge up cores. 
---
Yes, the Dense mod will reduce the huge damage from close range TSE.  I have never seen the Dense mod for arms legs.  Appears to be a unique for chest.  Like the Weighted is unique for arms and the Springing one is for the legs.
---
You can also equip Fireproof perk for even more reduced explosive dmg now.  They changed that perk so it reduces fire and explosive dmg.
---
Both of those help vs the SBs because they count as explosive dmg; not the acid spray though.
---
I use herbivore and wouldn't trade it for nothing. I have 4 corn, 2 carrots, 2 gourds, and 2 razorgrain. I use super duper and this gives me 18 crops. Since soup helps with food and water, it only takes 3 of the above soups to fill me completely up on both. I also use the other food and water perk under endurance. Works great.
---
What sunde88 said. ⬆️
---
My excavator armor is vanished. Xbox one. Brazilian deth.  N I'll post a video or screenshot once I figure out how to. I'm new here to posting. Sorry.
---
Jeeeeeeeez... major CAMP envy, nicely done my friend.
---
I'd say it's a combination of both A and B.
---
They obviously can't do a massive ban wave or they'd lose too many potential Atomic Shop customers. And players. They need every player they can get to keep playing the game if they want it to survive. Because, newsflash... this game isn't doing too well.
---
All of them are shared to one account.  Also a lot are bugged and can't be completed.  Like 
---
* learning cooking recipes one for 80 atoms.  * Make a friend
---
* Full rank up perk cards.  
---
To name a few.  The only individual ones are the level ups which offer perk cards, not atoms.  Yet it is tied into the challenges which makes it a bit decieving.   
---
Where?
---
Oh yea just for that comment Todd will add it. No this item can really save their situation. People would be mad at it
---
I thought vault tec and the enclave worked together and were basically the same entity
---
People would always find stuff to complain about , nothing will ever fix that.
---
This is actually the important issue.  People will put up with a lot if they are enjoying themselves.  No one can deny that the game has problems.  The disconnects alone would make me rage-quit most games.  But I enjoy myself so much that I'm willing to deal with it for now.  Bethesda is working on the problems and I'm good with that.  
---
Hmmm now I'm interested in trying...dump something in a random suitcase before I begin exploring and then checking after however many hours i play.  
---
I'll make sure it's something dumb that I won't miss when I inevitably get disconnected haha
---
How are you able to afford such a large place? I'm always heavily constrained on mine...
---
Hide the porn, mums coming!
---
TL:DR- PVP is broken, one sided and there is not enough of it.
---
No one really takes workshops and when they do, most wont come to defense. Getting Wanted is suicide and hunting wanted costs you more caps than they are worth. Because of bad design of hunter/hunted and leave of players who like challenge, its impossible to get that going.
---
First you need a weapon.  Once you have one start killing stuff.
---
Also look for quest markers and do the quests.
---
You can also claim and defend workshops. 
---
Done, you are now leveling up.
---
Plus, the bunker has a standard gear vault door at the entrance, and obvious Vault-Tec architecture throughout.    Vault-Tec built at least some of it (if not the entire bunker), it wouldn't be out of place to have a Vault-Tec STASH box inside.
---
I have really only repaired my leather armor set about... 4-5 times (each piece) in total in about 100 hours of play.   I keep white knight equipped though, so extends it quite a bit.   
---
Also leather repairs are dirt cheap; not even worth thinking about.  I dont think they even take ballistic fiber.    
---
Pity :(
---
I am 19 level and i was thinking like wow this is airdrop it should be good but it was not even close. 
---
Right, why should anything ever change or be fixed.
---
https://discord.me/page/fallout76tradinghub join us in the trading hub, we also have a channel where people announce their nukes
---
Order of mysteries so far is my favourite questline as a whole. Partially because I always enjoyed playing games in an "assassin role" and various gadgets that you get to use, and secondly the secret entrance is amazing. My only wish is that there was also a male counterpart questline (could be a small tie in like Mr &amp; Mrs Smith type mission) and that the garb of mysteries, and male equivelant were outfits that could be worn over armour rather than both armour and outfits. 
---

"Did XxXn00bDestroyerXxX just eat someone?!"
---
"Yeah, he's fucking weird."
---
Go away lol. 
---
east of poseidon power plant and west of whitesprings (the house you're looking for is the red one on the map west of whitesprings off the highway)
---
You take First Aid to rank 3, then use diluted stims till your health pool gets big enough to switch back to normal.
---
I generally find the 80 button presses required to go in and toggle passive mode to be overly cumbersome, but it really is worth the time to do it before going to a crowded blast zone.
---
Very early on my first player experience was a friendly player who left some basic supplies outside my shitty camp, gave me a little heart emote, and then went on their way.
---
It was a really nice gesture and has encouraged me to pay it back whenever I can.
---
So if you're on xbox and see a brown haired nurse wearing glasses, don't run away. It's probably me coming to drop some healing love. :)
---
Your perks high enough? I think that Makeshift Warrior 3 that’s needed. 
---
People would complain about changes
---
Yes, but with the added benefit that you can store an unlimited amount of stuff on the mule, since it doesn't matter if they're over-encumbered by a lot.
---
Yeah that's true. I'd like it if more events were activated after quests though. Even better if it changes the world interactions like in Watoga, or even additions like Rose's Raider Radio
---
Yes I did!
---
Thanks man
---
Really , begging for ammo because it's too hard to make/loot ? Really ?
---
Luckily they don't consume them and need refueling. The fusion core in the generator *is* their power source. However, keeping generators fueled is not part of the FO76 survival experience.
---
It’d make everyone’s lives so much easier if they did so. 
---
Found two sets yesterday, Lewisville and Welch. Seems to be the best area for finding them. Good luck! 
---
yea, the PC players are mainly the ones that can get into the DEV room by hacking/cheating, so Bethesda can track them. The system flags the people that entered, and also flags the items that aren't released to the public yet. Unfortunately, your bro bought a "stolen" item
---
how do you share pics from xbox to reddit. ?
---
Nope...no spare ones. Learned the only one I saw, so now I am one of few who knows all :)
---
That only works as an argument until you repair them - I weirdly have 2 anti-armour chinese officer swords on my melee main that I keep around as they amuse me and i keep meaning to trade to alts. They stack as same effect, weapon and durability. ;)
---
Thanks man! Watoga Train station or BoS vendor?
---
.....GO .....AWAY 
---
BE GONE 
---
How dare you. Children in Africa could've eaten those Bobbleheads and TSE guns
---
Elder scrolls 
---
That's part of the reason I'm pointing that out. 
---
So depending on your build, diluted are better. 
---
I have a beserker melee build who always has radicool on for that extra +5 str. That means my HP bar has 50% rads or more pretty much all the time (unless I kill myself with my explosives which happens pretty frequently). I keep born survivor at 20% trigger so I can have some reaction time in big fights. So between the 20% trigger and the 50% health, usuing a regular stim will be excessive, whereas I can also break down 1 stimpack into 4 diluted (with chemist perk) and possibly 6 with super duper perk. 
---
It all kind builds off each other, but those are the primary reasons I dilute mine. 
---
Also in a sale crunch when I don't grind whitespring for fluids, I can sell sell diluted stims since I can create more from 1 stim. 
---
But my sniper usually has full health and I kept regular stims on that character but recently I switched to unyielding for extra agility and perception (at about 25 now). So I'll likely merge to diluted for that character too since the health bar is usually taken up by rads to keep my buffs strong. 
---
Radial stuff has limitations when you are group with another person(s) who is/are in different stages of those quests.
---
Move the camp, then move it back. When you place the blueprinted/stopped items back down, they will be repaired. It's really useful if you have things like decontamination arches that require a bunch of exotic materials.
---
Why so negative 
---
I keep my requisition tapes on me and if I happen by one of the towers, I'll pop in and make a request but never collect from it. Some lower-lever who will benefit from it is sure to be nearby when it drops. Otherwise I'd never use them. I've got plenty walking came mods already. 
---
Maybe the renaming only appears for whoever named it? 
---
I miss not being able to name my favorite items so I don't accidentally scrap them along with similarly named items.
---
The biggest problem with the game is that you, the player, have little to no impact on the enviroment, or yourself. Most actions in the game are meaningless. That does not make for a fun game.
---
I've only found them in med kits, and over my 100 hours playing I've only got like 10, so they're pretty rare. 
---
You right. But I don’t want some ones first queen to be an insta kill by some douche. It would take so much away from it.
---
No I cannot agree. 
---
I spent an hour farming lead. And I have a ton on 45 now. Just collect tin cans and toys 
---
Xbox, btw.
---
Alright, you beggar hobos can have your circlejerk, i'm gone
---
I haven't encountered anybody like that, but that does sound like a potential way to exploit the system. I feel like somebody would realize it's many shots though, you'd probably get massive fps drops due to all of the explosions happening. 
---
They implement the robot changes/radio addition pretty well. And the events still show up for party members
---
You’re upset that someone had a positive experience in the game and wanted to share it?
---
Who cares if someone has a different expectation than you or a different priority than you? This is the story of someone enjoying the game which can only be a good thing - more happy people means more long term players means more incentive for Bethesda to support the game.
---
IT WORKED!
---
Normally it has to be done 3 times for the spell to work!
---
I can just wait. Thanks for the offer though. 
---
Which is why it's even more confusing that people do it
---
I'd love this too, but they'd better make it dupe-proof.
---
3 times is too hard...take such a long time...effort...maybe someone can cast the third spell for you....puh-leeze ? (OK really gone now)
---
You on Xbox?
---
Ok that or a perks like the one for shotguns that makes it have practically no spread and 8nsane range. This doesn't really seem to be an arguement.
---
If you're on PC, could you craft it for me? I have mats.
---
So, you don't think there's something very wrong with this game? Just a bit wrong? Or not wrong at all? Or..
---
Make another?
---
Nope, PS4 unfortunately but thank you!
---
Do you know which quest-line this is? Doesn’t sound familiar to me and I thought I finished all the quests, haha.
---
Oh so now it turns out they are actually ding it. Cool.
---
someone re-checked the PS4 player count a few days ago through trophies and it was noticeably smaller.
---
I'm speaking from experience. I keep meeting less and less people. popular events from a month ago are now dead. you can actually loot the areas surrounding vault 76.
---
even this sub's gotten a lot slower than it was back in december.
---
I haven't crashed mid game since the patch, but I have had two infinite loading screens. One when I was fast traveling to kill the Queen, so pretty damn frustrating 
---
Then I'll Pay 600 caps hmu
---
There's a reason the dev room and duping are referred to as "exploits" and not game mechanics, and these people are making the game less fun for everyone else (MORE server crashes, OHKO SB Queen, etc). People want them banned for good reason. 
---
Eat-xecute
---
Fixed it for you.
---
Yeah I know I thought it was a thing in the game that they just reset when you can back on it’s a good job I’ve got some stored
---
Sell all super stims, just get more regular stims.  Easy to get.
---
Ooh, I just found that safe yesterday and would love to know the exact same thing.
---
If you have done some of the starter quests in flatwoods(?) you should have the plans to make the hunting rifle. Check in the notes part of your inventory.
---
Yeah i guess the haters and fortnite consolers left finally.Good riddance.
---
It happens. Don.t drop anything important. At least drop some ammo first. If it stays on the ground, you can put something else in the bag.
---
Was a hunting rifle. Good gun. I could craft a new one for you, if on PC. 
---
this, I have a character that has all BOS combat armour and the officer underarmour where sentry helmet looks awesome with, but I only get to wear it some of the time since my base is in the ash heap
---
dupers? no, it's not. people in possession of a duped item? most likely.
---
if you manage to inject scripts into your console then yes. without cheating it isnt possible
---
(Also it still counts as a rifle, not as a shotgun)
---
Not something I have experienced and the only possible explanation I can think of is that you have gained healing factor mutation which has a negative effect of -50% Chem effects
---
read the entire topic. I've said this before, you're getting hung up on an arbitrary number. point is, a sizeable chunk of the playerbase is in possession of duped items.
---
too big of a chunk to ban.
---
Yeah, after reading the wiki, it looks like Vault Tec was, at least, heavily influenced by the Enclave.  I didn't know that and it doesn't say where that lore is established...so it must be something I missed in all my playthroughs.  
---
The Enclave was still a shadow organization of government officials, and Vault-Tec was still a private company.  I maintain it's still possible that the Enclave wanted to keep itself separate from Vault-Tec, even though those government officials were using their official positions to enable and influence Vault-Tec.  So basically, Enclave influenced them but wanted to remain independent...the existence of a STASH box in their bunker would possibly indicate that Vault-Tec had also infiltrated the Enclave.
---
How could you possibly make a lasting impact on an online multiplayer game without a persistent world? Maybe even a persistent one?
---
It HAS to be this way because if it's not, you'd either have to be in your own world instance or you affect other player's experiences, which is unfair of them because they miss out on some of the gameplay that you did.
---
It sure is possible to kill through slap damage, I knocked down someone at a vendor sometimes because he was occupying it for like 10 minutes, I revived him when I downed him though and then I proceeded to trade with the vendor.
---
Don't really see what's wrong with someone setting up a tag firing line, it's not like they deal so much damage you can't tag em yourself, if anything it saves on ammo and repairs
---
You can clip doors into each other. Just stack 20 doors together and lock all 20 of em. If someone picks one, they got 19 to go
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
I just don't agree there is something "very" wrong with it. 
---
There are things wrong with it for sure. 
---
If it were unplayable then I would agree.
---
I did quest but I did not know that i can make one. I am working right now but when I arrive home i will check it asap.
---
Long posts are usually drab but this was a damn good read lol good job.
---
Have an up vote!
---
I did not know that i can make one. I am working right now but when I arrive home i will make it asap.
---
I don't think that proves anything about slap damage, you clearly initiated combat. As for the damage...looks odd, sure. Only thing I can really think of off the top of my head is that the person stacked dense armor for max explosive resistance
---
If you can provide the mats will craft it for you. Drop me a pm if you are want me to help out 
---
Greater than 100% condition will be more benefical, since the extra Def stat will decrease less per hit as durability fades. If you craft or repair a Power Armor piece over 100% it will get a few extra defensive stats. The max additional Defensive stat is the same on a 200%-durability PA piece, no matter with what INT level it was created or repaired to 200%, condition value also has no effect on the max amount extra Def stat you can get. The condition bonus has a cap. Power Smith and INT affects that. I'm not sure if the cap can be reached with only 25 INT or with Power Smith AND 25 INT, but one of them should be the cap, at least based on my own testing and what some reddit posts claim. With all this being said, crafting a max condition PA piece has marginal benefit, and this requires INT 25 and Power Smith.
---
"Crucial...."
---
Hey Bethesda! Quit fixing the server crash issues we need inner walls, stat!
---
"We're on it!"
---
How exactly would you go about this?
---
It's easy to say "the quests need more impact" without actually saying how or showing how it doesn't negatively affect other player's gaming experiences.
---
There's only maybe five quests that make changes like that, the game needs more moving forward. I understand it would be hard to track scorchbeasts though
---
It's not negative, it's logical. Make better choices and stop complaining. Hell just fast travel to your camp for free and stash away man!
---
Yeah, I am on PS4 but I might have plan too, I will check it but thank you.
---
Also, make the chance of good X01 mods way, way higher, or make it independent for each player, or whatever's needed. I spent an entire weekend server-hopping, trying to get calibrated shocks, unsuccessfully. That's not the way to get me engaged in the world or story.
---
A regular Combat Shotgun, because I have no luck at all with legendary drops.
---
Oh wow duh me the dummy 😂 yes I have healing factor so that makes sense now. When I gained it I thought it was great for my melee build with the +300% regen but when I saw the -50% chems I didnt think about radaway I was thinking more like psycho and bufftats. So that makes sense, Thank you!
---
A full strength rad away only taking away an 8th of your rads doesn't sound sensible. I have healing factor and still only need about 3. Only need 1 if I use rank 2 chem fiend.
---
Holy shit does someone have a video?
---
It has been a long day in the office and I needed to do something Fallout-ish. Thank you kindly! :)
---
Be patient, the game will grow.
---
I just spent an hour trying to PVP.
---
Got a bounty up to 1380 caps from blowing up settlements and just waited for people to come at me.
---
Nothing for 30 minutes.
---
I logged off.
---
When I log back in I’m going to whitesprings to see what happens.
---
The quests that already impact the game shows it can be done. It could still be small changes like those, but we need more.
---
Don't worry, I'm not talking about phasing, adding layers like that would be awful
---
*Thatd be 2400 Atoms please.*
---
It doesn't have to be lasting impact. The feeding for the hungry for example, impacted the entirety of the server from players choosing to do that event. Probably why so many were upset they removed it. It was one of the few things that held some sort of impact outside of repetition.
---
Yea as said above I just reset my Xbox and log in its annoying but not the only game that gets me lol I already knew 
---
Stop with the common sense !
---
To overpowered your supposed to have a limit so you have to pick which perks help you the most
---
With Chemistry perk, you turn 1 stim into 4 diluted.
---
With Super Duper, there is 30% chance of getting 8 diluted.
---
They heal less sure, but you just heal more often and at higher health levels than normal.  (reduces number of deaths)
---
Also they weight 1/2 of what a normal stim does, so you can carry twice the amount and still have same weight.
---
There is no downside of diluted stims, unless you are using them when only 20% health left and not using low health build.
---
I dont think ive got dense unlocked.
---
Diluted stimpack - 0.5 lbs
---
I can say with 100% certainty that phantom weight is/was a thing. idk if it is attributed to ghost grenades, but I emptied every single item i had on me into a bag except a power armor chasis and had 16 lbs remaining. I will update this post shortly with a clip I recorded a month or two ago. I never uploaded it because I realized after the fact that I didn't go over the "ammo" tab, and i knew people would nitpick it, so i intended to rerecord it and never did. I guarantee that the only item in my inventory with any weight at that time was the chasis.
---
the disagreement is that it sounds like you want perks to be along damage types (ballistic, energy, maybe even radiation too). i disagree with that and instead think that perks should be along weapon type (shotgun, heavy weapons, etc)...
---
Bind on landing in inventory.
---
Passive skills
---
I’d rather see these two things first.
---
If you cant support one man idle thinking then u in the wrong place. Its got a load of support so clearly im not the only person wanting this idea. Do me a favour and go harass someone elses post. Thank have a nice day
---
I’m 205 with zero perks saved because I continually buy different cards I don’t have to be able to swap.
---
If they did nerf me to a point where I couldn’t even swap cards to be viable (doubtful) it would only take a couple nuke zones to shift points around.
---
I'll take the bobbleheads off your hands. Never duped but want to see what this talk is about...
---
Hm, that’s true. I still think we should be able to save perk classes
---
No problem there’s a perk in luck (can’t remember the name) that when maxed will reduce the -50 to -12% that should help also, :)
---
Won't pvp with it being as imbalanced as it is. Right now it is just a matter of who gets the first shot with their tse. Fuuuuuuuck that noise.
---
When I get home from work today I will use radaway to take away my mutations and see if that makes a difference. I dont use the chem fiend perk cause I have 6 points in END for ghoulish and Uhhh the limb perk. And since I lost my marsupial mutation yesterday it wont be as bad losing the rest. While electrified and irradiated perks are cool I find them to be more of a hassle running my melee build as the effects normally just show a giant green blob on my screen making first person fighting near impossible. But I will update this afternoon with the results. 👽👍

---
Honestly, I'm tired of how "everything has to be worth doing" kind of stance. 
---
You go to a building, take out some weak robots and turrets sometimes, upload a holotape and then find the drop. It's not hard. It's not time consuming. 
---
There's no real effort in them. They are meant to be extra stuff, if you want to do them. Like hacking terminals to open doors or lock picking to open safes. Just for a chance for some extra stuff. 
---
Either do them or don't. They are what they are. 
---
I have gotten quite a few Antibiotics.   There is recipie to make them from Enclave Bunker/Medical.
---
Tea Pot loop
---
I don't understand what your post is trying to achieve.
---
I've requested a few but they never turn up....
---
But why tho?You could've just moved em to your mule and kep em.Don't get me wrong , I know how overpowered and unfair they are , but literally throwing them in the trash bin isn't a good thing.
---
6 crashes in 5 hours. Mostly from trying to join friends or people I was trying to set up item trades with.
---
Wow I did NOT see “serum”
---
Had to read that twice.
---
..and you can't see.
---
Oh that's glitched?? Holy shit is that annoying.
---
I would like it if you had a couple fluid points for a small cap fee you can move them to different slots but it has to be those few because as I get weapons my build changes back and forth
---
For the Gauss Rifle, the verbal descriptions of range modifiers and the numerical changes to range go in opposite directions for range-affecting mods. I'm still not sure what's up with that.
---
As I understand it, all the dupe methods rely on using unusual tactics to trick the server into booting a character without saving, and reverting to a previous save while logging the character in. So the character still has the items from before they handed them off. I don't think that being able to rejoin a server would effect than, especially as (I believe) console players can join the server of anyone on their recent list already.   
---
You could just flag the Vault 76 fast travel point as a 'joinable' server tag from the 'recent' list, and then you could rejoin any server you'd recently encountered without any need for additional coding?
---
no we are telling the devs, it's ok to release a buggy mess as long as you keep working on the game post release. And the game content is sub 1% aesthetic microtransactions
---
LOL!
---
LOL I've ranted in a similar whilst battling it with my mates. Everything's so loud then they can't hear me anyway.
---
Those should be given a second chance. Dupers not.
---
You forgot one type

„I didn’t ask to be here, I don’t know why you attack me. If you feel like slap damaging me, I will drink some water and send you heart symbols.“
---
*this player doesn’t give a f***k about pvp and will not retaliate, not because he knows he can/can’t win but because there is nothing to be gained aside from junk and his stash is already full*
---
You do but not when PvP hasn't been initiated.
---
Yeah. Me and some friends were going to do a bunch near Flatwoods on a weekend. Sort of like a, it's raining supplies kind of thing. Each of us would load a holotape, run down and loot them, run back up, load another. Till Flatwoods was covered in them for people to get all kinds of things.
---
The first character I made, the first time I got to Flatwoods, there was about 5 crates around. 
---
Guess I can't do that. 
---
I imagine this would be future content. Probably the same with max weapon level. Much like how WoW has increasing level caps with each new expansion.
---
Gotta have room to grow the game.
---
This was a pvp event when both players were initiated
---
Freaking bats did as well.  A good third of my deaths on first char were bats spawn raping me in the SE.
---
I think I fall in to that category myself! :)
---
they are idiots and they will lose their remaining playerbase for that. good riddance.
---
This is good. Thank you for this read. I will downvote then upvote for the sake of trying to give you two upvotes. 
---
I would love to see it but just because I want to watch the world burn. It would be a shit show of epic proportion!
---
They usually show up with the Pharma perk after searching.
---
I got a bounty from missing a molerat and hitting someone else's stairs on their camp. I just stood around in Flatwoods wearing nothing but a cowboy hat until someone put me out of my misery :)
---
Why the blowing up settlements? Wouldn't just shooting once to get a bounty and then waiting do exactly the same?
---
OR just let us access our stash via a phone app and we can add and remove items whenever we want no matter where we are (even during loading screens 😲)
---
I cannot fault your reddit maths :)
---
While different looking containers all link to the same stash the benefits usually are: size limitations (where those big ugly blue boxes just won't fit), roleplaying (I put toolboxes in my crafting room), and more creative placement (they can be used like ugly steps, or to block holes, etc).
---
Sorry to rez. Googled how to get certain containers and this popped up. Hopefully this helps future Googlers.
---
Wow! This post has helped me sooooooooo much! And all this time I’ve been thanking selfies in Balt 76, thanks, this helped a lot and god bless you!
---
Don't build turrets. They take up most of the budget for no reason. You can defend your base just fine on your own. As far as the original OP saying that level affects how much you can place, I'm not sure on that. Maybe he's right. I haven't ever tested this but I'm pretty sure one guy did test it and proved it to be false. It was just the turrets and stored items wasting all the budget space
---
Honestly, I wish they would do away with things like explosive on weapons. It should be on ammo. 
---
We should be able to learn recipes for special ammo. Armor piercing, incendiary, explosive. 
---
Like the syringer in FO4, you can pick what ammo you want to load. Once you run out, you have to pick a new one. 
---
Yes, I know that's work. Yes I know you run the risk of running through ammo. But the solution is to pay attention to what's going on, not just run on Murder Hobo all the time. 
---
Ps4
---
Nope there's even a delay after picking up.  Not sure how long, I gave up after about 10 minutes.
---
&gt;I hope they ban him even if he isn't a duper.
---
ah, reddit. never change. all this impotent bottled up rage. I'm sure it gets girls moist.
---
I'm confused how you took a desk piece by piece or how you were able to place clean pillows? 
---
I have a son that’s probably older than you. Why don’t you worry about your IBS and anxiety. Not try and make up stuff about strangers. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA you deserve that honestly. You were a fucking vigilante getting busted. Good riddance.
---
I'm trying to obtain a wombat,,,
---
Thanks for the info, worked perfectly the first time and I got the nukacola and cookoo clocks whoo hoo!
---
No clue what 'bind on landing in inventory' means - do you mean items that are untradeable/unsellable once you loot them?  
---
By passive skills do you mean skills that were perks and you want them to be perks even when you take out the perk cards? So basically extra skills on top of the max currently available? Seems a balance issue on top of the coding issue, so that'd take more time  
---
I will take it a step further, put a stash box at every faction headquarters and add free fast travel to those few locations.  If I wanna be BOS, let me treat fort defiance like my home.
---
Totally Agree, it was fun at first being a low level but now its more worth it to just go on mass farm runs.
---
Train station!
---
See. I'd rather be able to do a full (maybe max once weekly) respec for x amount of caps (based on level)
---
But whatever will the griefers do???
---
There is already an easy way, buy them with monies. I'm kidding though, don't do that. I'm just saying that they likely won't be handing out more premium cuurency. They gave you a lot at first to trick us into using the shop.
---
I'd imagine that once duping and glitching are fixed the new dlc and game modes will drop.
---
True, but you really dont need two of them in this case.  The only cases where I can see someone wanting two exact legendary are the The Dragon and BP Rifle/Pistol...  and of course the famous melty Plasma Gatlings.
---
The difference between a same level Excavator armor piece crafted with 8 INT compared to 28 INT one is so small that you can barely notice the difference, imo. 
---
I'd like more varied ones. Pretty much only genuinely scared of Scorchbeasts. The rest I can take on if I'm careful and mindful of my health.
---
However, in time I guess. Game's gotta grow into something so I imagine more will come with expansions/DLC.
---
10 photos taken before disaster
---
I’ve been fortunate enough to never dc in the bog. I did, however, make the mistake of logging out just a smidge too far from the train station once and spawned in the middle of hostile Watoga when I was a little too low to be there. Especially with those two +100s farming bots at the time. A 3 star assaultron demonstrated its julienne feature for me...
---
yes? expecting "honor" is stupid security for a videogame.  
---
Well there is one, I think it's in morgantowm high-school, or some very early area if you follow the overseer's journey. I remember tellingy friend there's access to his stash box down there through the door if he wanted to store some items. 
---
Fastest way to get a big bounty.
---
I figured getting 1400 caps would attract more people.
---
Evidence?
---
Hate to break it to you but that was the lapd riot armor the ncr brought it to the divide 
---
I know the feeling, it's unfortunate that you have to question every players intentions. Like yourself, I try to wave at everyone I come across so they know I'm friendly in the hope they won't attack. I had one guy (who was lvl 91 to my lvl 23 at the time) come over to my camp, wave at me and then beat me to death with a sledgehammer. I respawned back into my camp and he was still there, I didn't fight back and just carried on with what I was doing, then a scorchbeast started to attack and he just left...  what a guy.
---
The downside is you can't revive teammates with diluted 
---
Nothing pains me more then my overflowing collection of wood armor. Seems to be a favor choice for all 3* legendaries 
---
Pix or it didn't happen.
---
Ha, would be funny to build a single story building with about 8 doors facing outside yet only 1 real door.  Pretty certain the place would get attacked in frustration quite a bit though...
---
I must be doing something wrong. All the workshops that I take over, and I haven't crashed once because of it. 
---
No. 
---
Im pretty sure the only reason why you cant is because super stimpacks weigh 1.5 and regular stimpacks weigh 1. So maybe you could dilute it into a reguar stimpack and a diluted stimpack
---
Hilariously enough, what's even worse than the government airdrops? The Enclave orbital drops.
---
The government's out here sending you drones to deliver a low level weapon, some ammo, some water, a bit of money, and maybe a Stim or two. The Enclave is deorbitting drop pods to send you dog good and a lead pipe.
---
That's littering your a horrible person 
---
Tell them you're fine with it and to follow up into the field right over there. Then rez a new CAMP with literally just the CAMP there and tell them to fill their boots. When they try killing you, remind them that the 30 carrot soups you made you're really going through but they're tasty! ;-P
---
I have the small letters plan, any chance you're on PS4?
---
Who hurt you?
---
The past doesn't determine tour future.  You can find joy regardless of the damage from your past.  
---
Yeh, so rather than bind on equip, if it binds when it lands in your inventory it means duper’s can’t sell to other players.
---
For passive I mean lock pick or hacking.  Those types and then reduce the active from 15 to 10.
---
There are diseased robots though.
---
kid of sucks for you seeing how I put my base around there. SEE.YOU.SOON
---
I'm still surprised people aren't talking about suing for therapy fees caused by playing, or something. 
---
I found an amazing cabin overlooking the toxic valley just west of monogah, has a deck, cooking station, and a few lootables. I moved because the Bumpuses lived in the next cabin over and they caused me too much trouble!
---
I can point it out to you if you like.
---
But you can with alcohol!
---
I went for Ricky Spanish mode tbh
---
You've seen a lot of them?  The only one I saw was inspiring, but sadly lasted a very short time.  
---
Yes many many times this morning i crashed 3 times after log in . 
---
&gt; What exactly is a Mule
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule
---
&gt; , and how can I use it?
---
Son you are gonna need to go to Tijuana for that one.
---
Weird, I just built up and pulled off a crit in PvP an hour ago so I can confirm you're able to.
---
Must be another bug
---
Why? People selling them are dupers most likely so you are the only one losing anything since they will have tons more.
---
Screw this quest. I have dc'd every single time I have tried it. It resets to the damn beginning. Arrrggghh!
---
You mean like downtown Boston? Nah fam, I ain't trying to destroy my frame rate
---
Bethesda patches = 50% bugfixes, 50% introducing new/old bugs that they previously "fixed". IT JUST WORKS!!!!
---
Eh, honestly I hope they don't do this. It's always annoying to see a newbie level character, in stuff they couldn't have gotten themselves. I'm not saying it's wrong or bad.
---
Why keep making the game less challenging by over equipping new characters?
---
I'm at a loss for why people would pay real money for stuff.  Not like this is competitive pvp or actually difficult gameplay.  Just means they can kill a queen a little faster.
---
When we were all still in the vault he was probably the guy stealing everyone's sweet rolls at their birthday parties.
---
I really liked the secret room you had in that house in Skyrim, In that house with the murder, I have no idea how it's called again
---
Which plans vendors sell reset when their cap limit is also reset (every 24 hours?)
---
They are the same across servers. Same way server hopping doesn't reset vendor caps.
---
The plans you see are the same as what I see.
---
I saw a plan from Grahm I couldn't afford. My teammate bought it for me, but when I looked again that plan was no longer there. Maybe only with Grahm though. I don't think it's a bug. Makes sense especially when they sell multiples of some plans.
---
FYI, they may have patched the Whitesprings vendor (that sells the bearskin rug) OR it also has limited quantities like I said above. I check the vendors almost compulsively and I've only seen the few "outdoorsy" plans with two different accounts and checked dozens of times across the last couple of months. Not saying don't check, but I've had the most luck with Grahm and the vendors on the E side of the map. I would guess that better plans are meant to spawn there since they are harder to get to (although Whitesprings exterior can be really tough...)
---
Hope this helps for future Googlers!
---
Anyone interested in the history of the miner unions in West Virginia and the shady operations of the mining companies should watch the documentary Mine Wars, it's utterly fascinating and horrendous at the same time, long but worth it. I need to rewatch it now that I've played FO76. Link below: 
---
https://youtu.be/RErOzUvr7oc
---
Also US didn't want to share the tech with China. 
---
Maybe it was the monster mash event specifically.
---
To be true, I like your version of colonel autumn way better - he looks more like an actual human being with character 
---
Plus with max rank first aid regular stims full heal anyway almost 
---
Fallout 3 got GOTY and it was buggy as hell. Not sure what point you're trying to make here. Also, New Vegas was extra buggy because they put more into it than Bethesda did and had many more options for the way your game could go. And that included the DLC. Way better than Fallout 3 by far. Also, the guys at Obsidian didn't know the Gamebryo engine and still did more with it than Bethesda ever did
---
I think they added more with the last update. I didn't notice them until last week
---
Platform: PC

Gamertag: not required, you don't care anyway

Description of Issue: Fought 3 Scorched Earth events this morning, Tagged the Queen continuously throughout all 3 battles, didn't receive any reward for the quest and even though the Queen showed weight in her inventory there was no loot to take. I tried fast travelling away and back all 3 times to no avail, others reported getting loot and rewards.
---
Customer Support Ticket: not worth my time, last 5 I submitted have been ignored as far as I can tell, they are now 7 weeks old.
---
Putting 15 into basically anything is totally fine, Bethesda should really buff int 
---
Wouldn't even be mad tbh
---
It sorta makes sense for streamers since hate gets clicks.  Weird for normal folks though, hordes of other games to fiddle with if dislike one.
---
You’ll have to move your camp deconstruct blueprints and scrap extras.  Seriously bugged but that’s the one way to fix it.
---
He's mocking the post someone else made about throwing their weapons in the water 
---
I carry 2 mini-nukes for this purpose ever since finding about the camps.
---
I don’t want to take anything out of it, but if int is really just going to stay this weak, I seriously need a fresh start
---
I think the lore really only states that t51b was capable of blocking 5.56 rounds at most. Power armor's primary purpose wasn't making the user invulnerable, it was to allow troops to easily use heavy weaponry in areas that vehicles couldn't access. The protection from small arms fire was really just an added bonus.
---
This was at harpers ferry, that blasted SOOTHING VOICE lulled me to complacency.
---
Eh. I have 15. My armor and weapons last for a very, very long time because INT affects the amount of durability. I seldom repair. And all my friends have me repair their stuff. 
---
Stuff will come, give it time.
---
A question that I don't have data for but do energy weapons have low base dmg because most enemies have low defense against them and this they to balance them?  Just seems like my tesla/laser tear through HP and I dont have perks for them
---
Hopefully
---
I really need to grab this perk card next time i see it. What SPECIAL is it and points needed?
---
*[citation needed]*
---
Who else would it be?
---
How much health does the Queen even have? I've seen a few videos of players getting 2 shot explosive Dragons and getting perks to do 10k damage, even then I would only wish to get this to one-shot the normal scorchbeasts if they spam the sonic attack
---
Thanks for the tip! I shall let her know post haste! 
---
I only ever leave through menu then quit option. 
---
with a couple of fast travels and maybe a server hop or 2 you can craft around 1000 rounds in about 20 minutes. charleston fire station gym 100+ lead the flatwoods motel gym and around flatwoods 100+ lead get superduper and ammo perks
---
I’ll give it a try to see just how long the cool down period is.  
---
You place them on the ground but be warned, you'll need some kind of a switch to activate it (preferably a trip wire or laser switch) or else the trap will just got off.   
---
You can find pressure switches and the like in the power connection tab I believe. Right under the blue switch box as of Jan 17 2019.
---
It always does dude, it’s not like it’s a rare occurrence
---
All stimpacks 3lbs!!
---
My daily community service consists of crafting low level pimped out weapons. I drop them to lower level players with ammo stimpacks and purified water. 
---
Up on the east side of the map is a ferriswheel that spawns an event....I think wolf horde...this event gives low level legendaries which are great to pass down to the noobs....enjoy
---
Vendored stimpacks - 0.0 lbs :-D
---
When intending to play with and not vs others, turn off pvp. She could ruin a scorch queen fight.
---
Ooo good shout! That’ll save me a lot of resources! Although they do tend to clog up my stash box!
---
Unique shotty?? Do explain.
---
That's what I thought.... Someone else to chime in without facts speaking out of the side of the neck...
---
The fact is yes but this is banning players in masses for duping and some people that weren't even duping just crafting a lot like my friends which I know for a hundred percent fact they weren't duping...
---
And no they don't have YouTube accounts or post publicly anywhere or anything like that, they are nobodies in the grand picture yet they were banned so it can happen to anyone in my opinion because I know that they were banned for only crafting a bunch of items not trying to Dupe.
---
I don't care what anybody else says I know this to be 100% truth.
---
Quack Surgeon, Charisma, level 22
---
They would be more worth while if everyone got loot.
---
Have to keep an eye out lol
---
How is suggesting you go somewhere else that fits your needs harassment?
---
If the bunker doesn't suit your needs, go somewhere that does.
---
No need for hoping when knowledge is present :)
---
From what I heard six expansions are „planned“ and tied to the vault openings 
---
For over a year, I have every skin. They’re entirely separate games. 
---
I think it's Quack Doctor and it's under the charisma one.
---
Do you mean the blueprints for these ? 
---
hahahahahaha, fuck.
---
If I remember correctly they said that dlc is free?
---
Ok dude. Have any proof of your statement? Because otherwise I’ll just trust my first hand, eyewitness experience.
---
This is before he got overly obsessed with that water purifier 😂
---
Not just a damage tweak, but durability tweak. My Plasma Gatling broke faster than my first marriage
---
That place looks huge.
---
The solar perks that restore hp and remove rads in sunlight are pretty nice, you can try that.
---
Agree. Totally ridiculous that it has 10 of every crafting bench and no stash 
---
But still, that’s a bunch of points put into a special that really doesn’t build you on a weapon and doesn’t have many good features except the durability about it so basically everyone just puts 5+ points in it and forgets about putting anything more in it.
---
Yes. Thanks 😀
---
A stuffed polar bear is 2x leather and 1x cloth.  The pristine teddy bear is 1x leather and 1x cloth.  
---
It probably depends on whether you have the scrappers perk maxed out or not.  I had it maxed out early on. 
---
The flatwoods monster could be the beginning of an alien invasion at the space station area.. especially since there are some "inaccessible doors".
---
There's also that living root/vine monster in lucky hole mine, which may actually be part of the vault that's opening in the area.. probably the whole reason the mire area is full of overgrowth. maybe a massive fight near Tanagra town?
---
who knows
---
And what's wrong with that? Did you complain when the shotgun/plasma pistol etc. did the the exact same thing in halo games? Or the multiple weapons in the bf/cod series, which for all intents and purposes are constant reskins rather than unique weapons. 
---
This is my category as well, although I do sometimes kill wanted players, if they happen to be near me, Stealth and my awesome Death Tambo makes quick work of them, and I feel like I'm helping them out, and never take their junk, unless it's a friend, then I may take some of their junk and put spoiled meat in their bag just for fun.
---
Yeah that would still be nice
---
Don't cave and do #2. Ever. That is just positive reinforcement for d-bags. 
---
Nah, you dont have a damn thing except delusion and a lack of intelligence. 
---
Should have put more points into it before trying me ;)
---
u/Dr_Moke? They have serums available, cheaper if you supply materials. 
---
Wishing for better stimpack weights priceless
---
Try class freak, that will decrease your negative mutation effects by 75% at tier 3. It’s in the luck skill tree.
---
I think just the one in 200 or so hours playing. I mainly meant I hated them from FO4 :)
---
There is also an array of cabins next to the Monogah Power Plant with a fully furnished kitchen and rooms. The biggest one has a red star on the front and an american flag. The other ones are a bit damaged but this one is pretty untouched aside from some paper an trash littered about. It can be found a short walk behind the Cooling towers themselves. Be wary as I have found a Super Mutant Suicider along with a group of level scaled mutants spawning at the furthest cabin!
---
Looks great. Thanks for the tour.   
---
How do you get the vertical beams, like seen beside the front-door staircase? Are those under "walls" with a certain set of plans, or some other category? 
---
That's people's choice. It's working for me. 
---
After level 50 you can start changing points around if you feel you need too.
---
I do think that INT should improve more than just durability. That the base damage should be higher. Or the ability to add special features. 
---
Also, what everyone else does isn't really a factor in how I decide to play. 
---
&gt;I guess why isn't there any type of server synchronization that prevents this or maybe something that scans the servers to ensure that this doesn't happen... 
---
You want them to make it so you can't place a CAMP in a location that someone else has placed one, even if they aren't logged in or aren't on your server?
---
The range around a CAMP that can be placed is pretty big.  Well outside the building zone of a CAMP.
---
Best to just find a less popular area.  The more secluded an area the more likely you won't overlap with someone.  And if you build on mineral/junk deposits, you are more likely to compete.
---
You friend isn't the only. Many people got banned. Ironic it took so long though. 
---
I still haven't encountered an alien yet
---
&gt; endangered bats. 
---
Get your retaliation in first.
---
id love to have just one explosive weapon. after 250 hours of play, I have yet to get one to drop. and i refuse to buy one, I want to earn it legit at this point its my end-game, really the only end-game there is.
---
Clearly a skyrim dragon
---
I think it has to do with proximity to other items. E.g. in a 1x1 square room, cooking station on front wall will not animate when a kitchen table is directly behind it on rear wall. Placing it offset (Stove front left corner, table rear right) seems to fix this.
---
Exactly! I don't have that perk, just Cola Nut for now but I'll be looking for it since I also mostly eat dog food and pre-war packaged stuff. Cooking food ends up just being a waste of wood for me
---
IDK. I've seen tons of posts already about how weak the energy weapons in this truly are. My brother refuses to use anything but energy weapons and suffers greatly because of it. He's loved the Brotherhood Steel since The first Fallout and has always role played as a Brotherhood energy weapon build in every Fallout game. I feel like Bethesda never shows them enough love even though they're iconic to the IP. Although they're more focused on making Fallout into a first person shooter with RPG elements instead of an RPG with first person shooter elements. SMH
---
For everything else, there's Atom Card™
---
Yeah your right, I’ll still keep my hopes up for a buff to int though.
---
Poor factory workers and coal miners wouldn't have this but it does look cool AF.
---
Actually if you pay attention if FO4 you find out that most of Mass Fusions power comes from fission plants -- the name is a cover-up.
---
I believe its a charisma perk.   Quack Surgeon.
---
It tells you what you need to craft weapons
---
Whether it’s mats or perks
---
I want raids. I get the nuke zones but that doesn’t give me the typical mmo boss feel. Much rather clear a cave or whatever and at the end is a boss. That’s just me 
---
I'm out of work right now so nothing better to do.
---
Level 19? Time to get yourself to the Watoga train station before it's too late!
---
They added around $1700 to it since launch. That's almost 30x more than the launch price and over100x more than you'd pay for the game now. You can buy around $50 worth of items for free with your ingame earned atoms.
---
Certain perks could be cheaper IF coupled with a minimal SPECIAL requirment, or else it's just power fantasies speaking.
---
Yet certain perks are bordering on uselessness and should be reworked (like fireproof was).
---
That would make for a great trap
---
I've encountered 2 so far.. I killed the first one, but he glitched out without letting me loot him. The second one I found, teleported around, and then possessed a mirelurk. He turned purple, and ran at me until my combat shotgun took him out.. crazy!
---
because nature rules
---
For future reference, all events with "(Versus)" after the title are PvP.
---
Gravity defying!
---
So it sounds like you got flagged for a high rate of item creation... any activities you can think of that might have triggered this flag? did you perhaps pick up a bunch of duped items at one time?
---
Any response from Bethesda yet?  
---
Keep one gamma gun to shoot ghouls that are fighting someone. Troll well young one. (disclaimer, I've yet to do this myself) 
---
Fun fact the battles between the rioters and the robots is what created the ash heap
---
For any roleplayers on PC give me a shout anytime! I play as a chainsaw wielding follower of atom/raider! 
---
I see the Welcome Home sign so often in CAMP showcases here that I thought it was something you get from the game. Boy was I surprised when browsing the atom shop yesterday. Aren't we all against atom shop purchases guys? Except for PA paint of course ;)
---
Judging by their slow responses, half assed atom store items, and the ever persistent bugs, I feel that they have already cut their losses and the game is in maintenence mode. Shame too, on paper the game was sweet. Too bad they botched it.
---
Still waiting on that proof.... I would love to see it, please prove me wrong...
---
I have no idea what is going on in Watoga train station. 
---
Good dog!
---
I agree with you on the resistance based perks but I think gunsmith, makeshift warrior and especially adrenaline are all in good places while demo expert is a bit of a mixed bag as explosives need it to be viable but it's absolutely broken with explosive rounds legendaries.
---
Don't get me wrong I see your point but I think there's too much for bethesda to get right to make changes like these anytime soon.
---
That sounds like my current option in RL! Love my wife, she plays with me! I'm not a "going out" guy so it's video games with my boo!
---
Need it really.
---
I just want something iconic and nice that isn't power armor. It's been a long time since power armor has felt special. Remember when it was basically this almost mythical thing? Something that made the Brotherhood or Hell, even the NCR seem like shining bastions of force in the wasteland? Or the Enclave seem like this draconian, mysterious thing?
---
Now every Tom, Dick, and common raider has it. Nevermind you actually needed training to use it, now everyone can. Hell have some right at the beginning of the game. I want something that affords me protection, looks cool, and isn't power armor. Sick and tired of seeing it.
---
Wouldn't have to revive then if they use diluted stimpacks at higher health and in greater regularity 😎
---
Armor pen is king. Pretty much everything endgame has damage resistance. I use penetrating. You are correct about suppressors.
---
 I like recon scopes because they mark the enemies but that's personal preference. General consensus is hadened receiver is best for damage because it also increases crit dmg because it increases base dmg.
---
There isn't good info about the stats for other mods. So just take what you like. Recoil, hipfire, etc. I use true because alledgedly it helps vats.
---
None of the mats to make lever guns are that rare except I think they require screws and spings. I can't remember. You can macertain scrap
---
Yeah, I have a stack of them.  They're crap.
---
The ban is real 100s f not 1000s were banned last night if not more, what's dumb is these ppl played up real money, was never shown any toc, and now Bethesda is banning ppl for basically taking "free pizza" more like a scam with a pinch of entrapment lol
---
Added you!
---
Test
---
What can I say except "you're welcome"?
---
And that right there is exactly the problem I'm talking about. Games should be released as fully functional products from the get go, especially if charging $60 + for said product. 
---
In no way, shape or form should they ask AAA price now but deliver the game in 1-2 years time as fully functional. 
---
In no other media does this happen, only in games. Why? Because people defend these awefull practices. 
---
Just image a movie, we can do this comparison since basically games are interactive movies at this point. How would you like to pay full ticket price but the movie lacked all the special effects? Would it be fine if the directors would just say: "no worries we'll add it in 1 year"? 
---
I’d like to see the numbers because the servers seem as full as ever on PS4, so I’m skeptical that they are hemorrhaging players.
---
Flamethrower turret skin
---
There seems to be a glitch with the new patch where it's not recognizing the materials in your stash for crafting &amp; repairing.
---
Try making sure you have all the materials in your inventory.
---
Nope although I have been plagued with an indefinite loading screen whenever I attempt to fast travel. Every other part of the game works for me but fast travel no longer works for me so I have to trek all the way across the map :-(
---
I found full sets of T-60 armour quite quickly in Watoga near the crashed virtibird. Helps that when you find the suit then quit out to reload you start in a little building right next to the location so its pretty quick to server hop
---
Luckily did some searching and found a lad to but it on for me but I got your pm ty
---
He looks younger but a really good job!
---
When passing gear and mats to and from known friends, just trade not drop.
---
Trade will associate a known caps value but you can reduce it to 0 
---
The benefits of trading directly are, you can’t lose it. If during the trade you DC it’s either in yours or your friends stash. Actually had this happen w/alt and friend.
---
No one can steal/loot  it if some griefer gets between you and friend, Logging off will mean it’s still in stash .
---
Finally if you’re passing gear, ALWAYS be aware of whose around you. ALWAYS.
---
TL;DR version - PvPers in FO76 are all pansies.
---
There's really zero need to have PvP at all, and it will never amount to anything but cheese in this game.  If true open PvP was a thing, you'd all kill each other before the Queen loses just 10% of her health.
---
Bethesda unfortunately fell into the let's copy the hottest thing out there and felt they had to try to compete with Fortnite, with a dated single player game engine to work with.
---
lead dog and a good pipe
---
For the love of god, we are begging you
---
Holy shit lmao
---
I'm still low level but i always try to help people. I have reached my stash limit and id rather give stuff away to someone who might need it, than sell it. but i had such a good experience when i was very low level where someone took me to their camp and gave me better armour, weapons, purified water, junk and told me how to make adhesive and where to find the ingredients!  Ive only had on griefer so far and consider myself lucky but every other player ive encountered have been friendly. Just last night i was doing the path to enlightenment event and as i was nearing the end 3 higher level players came along and finished up with me. I know they would get rewards too but i would never have finished it with their help.
---
I just think it was an oversite on Bethesda's part thinking that people will not duplicate locations. I also understand that you shouldn't be allow to overlay CAMP locations but I wasn't even close to the one site and was not able to replace my CAMP. I'm not by any deposits or junk areas, I thought I was remote enough but i guess not. I do think if the game gets popular or started off popular that this issue would be more common.
---
Cheers man, I'm awful at recreating characters in character creators, I really wish it was a skill I had as I'm a huge sucker for Roleplay
---
Greetings Wolfrevo,
---
What a great story!  I love our community.  Just fyi, if you're ever farming for Marine Armor Plans at Harper's Ferry, the vendor bot nearby is often selling a plain version of The Dragon.
---
Cheers,  
---
Brocktree
---
I use 76 to kindly escape Made in Chelsea and One Tree Hill....
---
I mean it'd be nice to have one but also it takes 3 seconds to pre-plan and grab what you need BEFORE you go in. I have the Jetpack plans and other rare stuff that drops only out of there and regularly buy him out of caps. I just take what I need in first. 
---
Yeah I stopped seaking revenge immediately. 
---
1) What platform are you playing on?
---
Xbox One X
---
2) Gamertag: Enos
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue: I don't have one off hand but I can make one if needed
---
4) Description of the issue: This has just started happening since this last update on 1/15 or 1/16.  When you are trading or moving items around the inventory, and you hold your stick to the left to get to 0 (zero), the counter flips to the far right.  You used to be able to hold the stick to the far left, get to zero, then tick up from there to move small amounts.  Now, the slider keeps moving back to the maximum #.
---
r/FO76roleplayers 😉
---
I see where you're coming from, but I find that reacquiring plans only adds replayability in the form of an un-fun time sink, which is a poor trade-off when I’d much rather be spinning up new characters to try out new-to-me builds, building each of them distinct CAMPs from all the crafting materials I get from doing events and adventuring normally, and even roleplaying them in different ways (and particularly if we ever get a proper faction system). 
---
From that perspective, the way things work now is a good reason to limit replays. And tbh, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with a small shared stash (like in Borderlands, maybe?) to move items between characters or even a shared cap pool. You can already make gear or buy plans with one character and then shuttle them to a different character, only it’s way more inconvenient than if we had a shared stash of some sort. Hell, it could even be some sort of "wasteland post" type mail service, where you have to use mailboxes at vendor stations to mail specific items to your other characters/account, just to keep things a little more in-universe from a lore perspective.
---
The Perk system feels a little broken to me right now, but I’m actually not a fan of sharing those unlocks across the account – both because I’m not sure how that would even work, and also because the current system needs some serious QOL attention to be more fun and intuitive. I’d much rather see things change to an active/passive perk split, where “active” perk cards (like % damage increases with certain weapon types) are automatically available to be unlocked at level-gated increments and still eat up SPECIAL points to equip, while “passive” cards still must be unlocked manually at or above their level-gated requirement but are then always “on” and don’t require SPECIAL points to have on your character. An officially supported perk loadout manager would be a good alternative with the current system, but it still doesn’t address that passive cards chewing up SPECIAL points feels . . . awkward and forces some odd specialization and unnecessary micro.
---
I was actually hoping plans you unlock in-game would be more like the Atom Store – account-wide, even if you don't necessarily have the mats or items necessary to use them (yet) on any given character. Also, sorry for the wall of text there. :)
---
Oh me too mang I always try to remake my character to look like me. It's kinda close
---
Is leather 
---
Because it’s not at all fundamentally broken. I rarely experience disconnects on PS4 and only a handful of bugs. People like you hugely exaggerate the state of the game and completely discount all the work Bethesda has done to fix bugs and improve the game.
---
and Dolly Sods Camp Ground!
---
Thats fucking stupid there was so much that was just overlooked. You hear about entering dev cell?
---
Its nowhere close to 65% of accounts. And they cant ban an account that didnt cheat in the first place. If you bought something from a player, ingame, with caps ir exchange without knowing it was dupped, the worst they can do is remove that item. Not ban you.
---
I’d play it like I stole it.
---
You can’t undo this nor can you mitigate it
---
If the hammer drops and you’re caught, you’re starting fresh regardless.
---
I’d remove it and return it to stock paint so it’s no as easily flagged on their end.
---
Consider this a teaching lesson.
---
I love helping out when I can..I will help folks kill enemies and let them take the loot, I usually am dropping stuff off at Flatwoods and the Overseer's camp and other Overseer's caches. Sometimes I see lower levels and drop stuff next to them. Most run away so I normally just put stuff in random mailboxes, crates, ect. My lower level characters I have had people ask me to trade, but for caps or Items I do not have, I know the struggles. I wish I could get help from time to time while I use my lower level characters but it is all good. I like helping out lower level folks.
---
Yes, for 1400 atoms 50% DISCOUNT! 😂
---
Nope none for the stuff in the inside can be bulldozed.
---
I built a bunker in the backyard
---
I love the game and don't see any problem with players but the loot table sucks and need more high level content fs 
---
They will enjoy destroying your stuff more than you cooperating
---
As others have said, Black Mountain Ordinance works TNT Dome 2 usually has 15 rounds plus the plans to convert the alien blaster to fusion cells.  To track down the key, you'll have to start with something else you found with the blaster...
---
Better be precise in this case, poor guy might see a dead enemy,  use it as a temporairy stash and be really mad at you after lolol
---
It's a vendor location where you can puchase the handmade gun plans (it's actually an Ak-47 rifle). Can only reliably get it between level 15-19 (maybe 20). Costs \~650 caps. Really great rifle, but it does eat through hard to find ammo at low levels (I'm level 24 so this applies to me). Have to craft a lot of ammo yourself. I hiked over there at level 14 just to create a fast travel point when I reached 15. Had to kill two low level super mutants, and a slightly tougher stingwing on the way, but I could have easily avoided any fight at all if I just ran past them. 
---
Good boye food
---
No other issue has given me pause in this game. Fine it's buggy, fine that the servers crash sometimes, fine that my house disappeared. But I'm actually seriously considering taking a break until they fix this. Nothing kills love for a game faster than no rewards. And I love this game, it will eventually be amazing if they take care of it well. I don't want to lose my interest before then. So fix the loot problem Bethesda, because a lot of us still want to love this game when it's all patched up. 
---
It’s crazy, because they could have been the first to really nail settlements out of the MMOs I’ve played. The bunker is perfect lore wise and gameplay wise as a social hub.  There should have always been two hubs in ‘76. Vault 76 and The Bunker, the latter at higher levels. It’s got multiple of every workbench which implies the idea was to have multiple players all working at the same time. It’s got vendors. It’s even got discrete boundaries so you can make it PvP free. It could have been a great place to come, trade, craft, and sit around the table in the war room and socialize. Vault 76 could have been reenter-able and had similar amenities. This includes both being a free fast travel point. 
---
From the sounds of things in this thread, nobody does them because they don't seem to be worth the minimal amount of time or effort that they take. Maybe, just maybe, they could use a serious looking at by the devs.
---
and SunShine meadows farm
---
They do events that unlock only after you complete certain quests, and then there's Watoga which was a cool world change
---
and then there's "scrap 5 weapons while wearing a hat", followed shortly thereafter with "killed 5 scorched while wearing a hat"....really?  not sure how many atoms that got me...but thanks for the participation award anyway...
---
From my personal experience having a variety of mass gear only dupers are being banned. 
---
I'm 100% I have duped gear but I haven't been banned. Some how Bethesda has been able to weed out those who abused glitches to dupe and people like myself.
---
Those who duped mostly did it for monetary gain so it should be to troublesome to purchase a new copy.
---
Sorta like a SICK circle of life situation. 
---
I can 10 shot her legitimately not every high dmg player is a duper
---
Don’t you follow news? Lolz
---
Mules are folks who Carry contraband for bad guys.
---
In Fallout 76 it’s an alt toon folks use to stash items to extend the storage limitations.
---
You’ll need a friend either as a server placeholder  or as bag man to hold your gear while you transition from whatever toon has the gear to whatever toon needs the gear.
---
Actually most of the people I engage with end up adding me to their friends list by the end of the interaction. I’m not bullying level 15 players but rather creating engaging content that both parties enjoy more often than not.
---
well, in other Bethesda games, the text turns RED if it is owned by someone else, or if you are stealing something.. I'm not sure why that wasn't implemented in this game, but maybe in a future update?
---
Bethesda is tracking and going after dev room items that shouldn't be in the game. 
---
As far as I've heard, only well known verified dupers have been touched by bans. (Youtubers and braggers I'd imagine.)
---
Or turn 2 super into 3 regular?
---
Zetan's would approve 
---
I still can't wrap my head around that one, but here we are, and it's a real thing.
---
Proof bitch.
---
Jesus, you really don't know how MMOish games work do you?
---
There are only ever 24 people max on a server though.  So you are only competing with those people for a current CAMP location.
---
In my case I physically saw the queen. I hit her multiple times with a shotgun. Though when she landed a guy pretty much one shot her with a tse shotgun. I wonder if that had anything to do with it. 
---
thanks!
---
Happens quite a bit and is very annoying.
---
Indeed you were =) 
---
Supers and diluted are vendor trash for me. Tend to just rock a ton of regular
---
I can get 19 with hard bargain and 5CHA on my main
---
Easy solution: phasing. 
---
WoW’s been doing this since... forever. And Elder Scrolls Online’s been doing this since release. And in ESO’s case, it has seen some large scale use for some of the later chapters/dlcs. Because, honestly, how do you tell a story to make the players feels like they are making a difference? Change the environment, make an impact, create a crisis. IMO, ESO’s story telling stepped up drastically in later dlcs partially because of this. 
---
I really don’t see why fo76 can’t do it. 
---
I rarely get dogs or molerats, but the problem is they sometimes spawn under the foundation and eat my fusion reactor. Mildly annoying.
---
Out of curiosity, what would be an example of that? I can't think of a single thing that I could equip in the game that I couldn't also get myself.
---
With walking pharmacy level 3 thar drops by. 5
---
happens a lot. I have three stars not drop anything on occasion.
---
Is there any armor in this game that doesn’t look shitty? 
---
I have been one shorted by slap damage. There was one specific guy that did this to me and another person in my party after the sbq dropped. He was in power armor, I was in a Hazmat. We were both ±125. We hadn't initiated PvP the sbq event had just ended and he was in passive mode the entire time.
---
Well, last night another 6 hours and it was a completely different story.  If I wasn't dealing with greifers I was having issues loading into fast travels, especially at White Springs.  Can't explain it.  
---
I'd love to name a Two-Shot Laser rifle "Red Glare" because of the two red beams. Of course they'd have to allow players to inspect items during trades so that we wouldn't get tricked or confused in a trade.
---
I am one of the few using Gatling energy weapons. The laser is at least manageable but still requires regular repair even with Gunsmith and Luck of the Draw. The Gatling Plasma gets 2-3 cores and breaks. I understand these weapons being more fragile than traditional guns but the current state is insane.
---
*opens movie maker*
---
Insulting people who have found ways to manufacture our own fun within the rules and mechanics of the game seems a little immature. Perhaps instead of name calling you could simply say “I don’t like this or the people that do it.”
---
If I was just out to be a dick I’d throw on a TSE and some Assassin/Sentinel BoS and be basically invulnerable while grieving people. Instead I intentionally use less than stellar options which ends with me having mediocre stats and being at a huge disadvantage against the people I’m raiding and creates a situation where I’m relying on wit and ingenuity not just grieving players.
---
I’ll keep you in my thoughts and hope that you can be a little more open minded and a lot less insulting in the future. I hope you’ll see that hurtful name calling is much worse than what I’m doing and try to be more tolerant of people who don’t share your exact same sheltered world view.
---
Since when is like 10 steel and 5 lead rare and expensive? Hell you get 37 at a time with ammo smith.  Issue is its not balistic ammo so on my sniper build it weighs 0.1 a shot.
---
I've been getting stuck on load screens when fast travelling between workshops. So frustrating. It's not frozen, just stuck on load screen.. I wait and wait and eventually have to restart the game. Happened twice within an hour tonight. 
---
Just don't go over the workshop limit (green) in that case! 
---
Also another thing that justifies not putting it into the game is that (as I understood it but it's been a while since I read the notes and listened to the holotapes) it was the military that was called in to stop the strikes.
---
Lolz woopsies I thought was explosive diarrhea 
---
My main would eat horribly bad stuff and would get dysentery and that a lot 
---
I do them just for the stuff. You can get weapons and armor to scrap and learn mods. You can get ammo, you can get provisions. 
---
And of course, XP. 
---
THey aren't meant to be great. 
---
Maybe, just maybe, people need to realize that games often put in a wide range of things for a wide range of players, and maybe, just maybe this isn't for them?
---
especially getting it from the Scorched beast queen
---
i can say with certainty that I experienced phantom weight around the time of this post. idk if it is attributed to ghost grenades, but I emptied every single item i had on me into a bag except a power armor chasis and had 16 lbs remaining. While i don't know what it is attributed to, I was inspired to record it because i had just "picked up" 10 frag grenades off a super mutant that were nowhere to be found when I checked my inventory. [Here is the clip](https://gameclipscontent-d2009.xboxlive.com/xuid-2533274800480478-private/2d036db7-81dc-4001-b7ff-5be2b99e1f4f.MP4?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=LKhicEqKrWxKqi0vuhvXwkyhWC2anZ42imBDJE2cJcA%3D&amp;__gda__=1547733308_e48c28191a7e326f7a0aeff4e3796a3e) I never uploaded it because I realized after the fact that I didn't go over the "ammo" tab, and i knew people would nitpick it, so i intended to rerecord it and never did. I guarantee that the only item in my inventory with any weight at that time was the chasis.
---
Im posting ITT because some guy sourced it as proof that the bug doesn't exist. I appreciate your efforts, but all you proved is that A) it is likely not caused by the "phantom items" from loot corpses, and B) *you* were not experiencing the bug.
---
I enjoy pvp and especially hunting wanted players, but yeah she really ought to enable passive mode when she's not actively doing one of those things.   
---
No need for one when you can use the one inside Whitsprings resort.
---
That's alot of misinformation there bud. 
---
I feel attacked
---
You do realise it's completely impossible to see a newbie level character in stuff they couldn't have gotten themselves, right?  
---
So you never have, you never will, and yet you're 'always annoyed' by it?  
---
Wow... :D
---
Sure thing! When I’m home later I will take a pic and pm you 
---
Who even does workshops? Because of the random crashes I steer clear since December. It’s all next to no resources anyway.
---
Welp, I've done a derp derp move
---
Just realised while looking for my excavator armor that one of my PA chassis was the Ultracite one. I had no idea it was rewarded by Belly Of The Beast. The rewards just said PA Chassis and I thought they'd just given me an empty one...
---
I was under the impression the versus part meant....
---
See who gets more candy.....as in you and your friends.
---
I wasn't expecting someone with a 2 shot explosive weapon decked out in chameleon armor to sneak up behind me and kill me with one shot.
---
Even if I wanted to play PVP......I can assure you that one shot kill weapons and invisibility wouldn't be fun nor fair.
---
What part of I'm choosing pacifist mode because I don't want to play PVP in a game where people are duping OP weapons and selling them for $$$ on eBay does Bethesda not understand?
---
I mean I get it, but I have had things happen to me (people stealing atom shop painted power armor pieces off my god damned chassis on the crafting bench) that 10s of people then proceeded to tell me CLEARLY I WAS LYING!1!!11!!!! so I get that a lot of people are spreading blatant misinformation and hysteria but there are also real actual issues that people (likely people taking advantage of) are saying "you're lying/that can't happen/fake" etc.
---
What!? No! I'm Not Having Bethesda Put Off Starfield And Tes6 So They Can Fucking Move A Fucking Steaming Pile Of Fucking Shit Out Of The Fucking Garbage back Into The Fucking Trash. I Swear To Fucking God I Will Go Fucking Postal...
---
Sorry, I don't hate Fallout 76. I'm just a little pissed because the only Tes content I'm getting is for a sub-par online game that is literally ruining the franchise through retconning. But for real, I don't think they should pause the upcoming titles, they already have a whole branch in Austin(?) working on 76
---
I'm level 82 and would of agreed 100% that the pc community is above harrassment. Until 2 days ago where I had a level 220 and 2 of his high level buddies spend 2 hours into baiting me and my friend into a fight.(should of server hopped  Immediately) This included trying to nuke my base , and ultimately when I negated that,  he tossed grenades until he was wanted,  and when my teammate when after him, made it so that I was open season as well. He did manage to "grief" my decontamination shower, before I logged out, and probably got 20 hardened mass from my junk. So make no mistake about there are a few duche bags on pc lol.... but on a whole, our community is much more helpful than hurtful.
---
am i still nice if i hit people with a combat rifle once and essentially do no damage just so when they hit me back i quickly switch to a black powder rifle and 1 shot the rest of their health?
---
In the early game, when Stims of all varieties were hard to come by, diluted helped me increase the amount of healing I had available. (On the flip side, I was constantly out of purified water.)  
---
Now diluted are vendor trash.
---
Lol. Last night ran 4 queens.... All four 1\* legendaries.... Rage quit and went to bed LOL
---
Remember when you do the quest for said armor, DO NOT register the current power armor you have or the quest bugs out. You'll know what I'm talking about when you get there 
---
That drill though is pivotal for post apocalyptic modern day construction, it's not like we have a do it your self build menu or anything..
---
Most non-player characters in games like have a very limited dialog that never changes, so they might as well exist only as a holotape.  A few characters are created to interact in a way that players become emotionally invested when interacting with them and FO76 does not have those at this point.  I think that at some point there will be some characters like this, but that is supposition on my part. 
---
There is a story present, but you have to invest a bit in discovering the story, which is a form of exploration, which appeals to many people, but not all.  I wish I knew better how many people are playing game like you can on Steam based games, but that is not an option, so I can't easily say how successful it has been.  I suspect this is a game will grown on people over time and some youtubers will at some point give ti a second look and pronounce it worthy to play and credit themselves with BGS making the changes due their personal criticism and their followers will dutifully take their lead and begin playing and telling everyone how it was due to their own boycotting of the game that things got better.  Meh.  I and a lot of other people are enjoying the game, and turn a deaf ear ( which I actually have) to the naysayers.  Naysayers can server a purpose, but there is time for them to move on.
---
It is. And it isn't an actual camp, it is basically a foundation with flooring and just a row of turrets. No benches, nothing.

&gt; With Super Duper, there is 30% chance of getting ~~8~~ 6 diluted.
---
Super duper only doubles the base amount for everything you craft (i.e. Ammo and Chems)

Legendary shotgun with nice paint job that you get from a quest at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary. Not sure what the quest is called or exactly how to get it, but I killed a specially named Mr Gutsy and took an “Arrest Warrant” off the wreck of the machine and was given the quest upon reading it.
---
No dupers are getting banned I have an email from bethesda banning my ass lol

They buffed the fusion core generators at workshops. All of the power plant workshops have a fusion core generator. They produce 8 an hour now which is pretty decent!
---
If you take a power plant workshop you can power up the fusion core generator (it takes 100 power, so you either need to be able to make the fusion-generator (the one that looks like the one in the world, but does not produce cores) or the attached power plant needs to be powered up (there are spots you can connect the resources to the power grid).
---
If you are on PC I'd be happy to show you the ropes (and otherwise help you).
---
I’ve been trying to figure out a way to eat other players. Thank you 🙏🏻 
---
Then you wouldn't need to twink out a new character would you? And if that's the case, you don't need to have a method to move things between characters, like a shared stash box, or mail system.
---
Because i know you can't use higher level stuff. It was to see how you respond.
---
That means the only reason to have this ability, is to create multiple characters, and use them as mules to hold more stuff. That's all this would be for. A way to get around the stash limit easier.
---
I just need 1 more score...
---
hahaha what a great quest, the developers are such geniuses creating this chore of a quest that exists only to frustrate and waste our time hahaha so realism am I right? I sure am glad they chose to lean towards realism for this quest rather than fun, who wants fun when you can have a slice of mundane time wasting in your video game.
---
Nah. I've played almost ever MMO launch in the past 20 years, this is no worse than ANY of the others i've played. You've obviously never play ArcheAge, this game is a master piece of a launch in comparison
---
Happened once yesterday at the Chemistry station. It was weird. I still tried crafting, but it didn't work...lol.
---
Yep I kill them to make the food. 
---
Are you using the power attack to proc the vampire mode? You must be, I myself have a Vampire Mr. Handy Buzz Saw and the continuous attack does not heal me. 
---
You're not paying attention then.
---
No need to start anew, past 50 you can also switch single points around on a level up
---
That would simply make mules omnipresent, and inventory infinite. No way they would allow that.
---
You on PC ?
---
Yes the recipes, sorry.
---
PC.   
---
I was doing Mama Dolces event and running out of time to get things started.   Running around like a mad man to collect the ingredients and put them in the hopper.   
---
When I activated the hopper, a couple of my armor pieces were included in the list of things I could transfer, even though it's usually just the applicable ingredients.   Not paying attention and panicking as time ran short, I accidently transferred a very valuable piece of legendary leg armor.   I couldn't take it back and when I exited the container and went back a second time it was gone.   Reloaded to another sever and confirmed my armor piece is gone forever.   Not cool.
---
Yeah, sorry, in my original comment I had attempted to shift off of INT doing anything and relaying that the crafting/repairing perks that gave greater condition percent inferred a temporary bonus to armor stats while the condition was greater than 100%.
---
You're right. I do long for the days iof "gun nut" and "heavy gunner", and "Science Expert" but that's not what inwas trying to say.
---
Does health pool grow? Currently at lvl 110 and I've only ever used diluted stimpacks the entire time playing. First Aid rank 3 makes 1 diluted restore about 40% of my health. 
---
And 2 of them would be equivalent to 1 stimpack, but with chemist, I'm turning 1 into 4 anyway, so I figured I'd just always use diluted and spam the heal button if needed.
---
To 0.1 and 0.15 fully upgraded.
---
Does it increase base durability? Or is the effect the same as the extra durability after repair perk
---
Ah I see. Thank you for the correction. I did not realize that.
---
Fair enough though Bethesda haven’t really done much that makes sense so far. Can you honestly say that you don’t think there’s a very good chance that they’ll keep the rate of earning atoms similar to how it is now even if they add a variety of ways to earn them?
---
No it was a test to see how people responded.
---
I know you can't. 
---
So what this is really all about is using alts to be mules, to get around the stash limit easier. 
---
Thats because the 50 cal machine gun just chews through ammo. Ive got a 3* 2 shot, explosive, dr when aiming combo. Im not even heavy weapons but i love it. That 50 cal is my go to for just mowing enemies down and laughing like a maniac.
---
You wouldn't be able to build close enough. But if you join their team you can build stuff in their camp

This is what you signed up for

Unfortunately I deleted the save file to try and fix my game :-(
---
I'm currently unable to load Fallout 4 anymore since the Creation Club came out...
---
Actually some data mining has revealed that the majority of enemies have more energy damage resistance than ballistic or explosive which only compounds to the problem of the low base damage.
---
Something that you can already do easily if you have 2-way communication with a trusted friend online at the same time, or you're on either of the console systems rather than PC.   
---
And just because you CAN get it, doesn't mean you will. I've got a L1 All Star Vamps Baseball bat I like to use all the way up to the 20s, for example. I \*could\* get it, you wouldn't be able to tell I \*didn't\* get it, but chances are pretty high I \*wouldn't\*
---
Then you should stop playing video games, exploits and bugs have existed forever in video games. Speed Runners make a living using these. Every modern game need tweaking even some thing as polished as God of War needed patches.
---
Comparing video games to movies is false equivalency and holds no merit. You don't interact with the movie, and if you do (bandersnatch) it's super simple choose your own adventure. The film makers don't have to worry about optimization for the hardware the person is watching the movie on. They don't have to worry about people using exploits ruining the in movie economy. 
---
This happens in video not because people defend it. It happens because of the inherent complexity of video games.
---
You're right.
---
Lol. I said that in the title.
---
They you would need to rework charisma and card sharing too.
---
Add me I'll play with you when I'm on I'm kinda casual only get weekends but I think helping others is fun now that I have lots of stuff I can craft and don't need 
---
Same ign on Xbox as here
---
&gt; before paying a couple hundred caps to those tin-head
---
It seems like an instant buy no matter what given its rarity. You can probably sell it to someone else for more than you paid. 
---
I know I would have paid someone double for one rather than server hop the billion times I did. 
---
I've gotten 2-3. It is possible! I always try my luck (I've got 16) when I see 'em.
---
I keep hoping for the day someone who doesn't know you can get it sees me get one and has their mind blown. ;P
---
Haha. I guess.
---
Boner Jams 76 
---
I get that there will be high level players there, but even when following the quests i'll get there at level 35 which is severely underpowered with 150+ people around.
---
So basically the advice seems to be grind the quest, then grind other stuff and don't bother us high level players and don't go to our grind sites.
---
Frankly, that sucks. I get that monsters need to be tougher if there are high level players around but if those players  keep hanging around the end of the starter area spawning monsters that aren't killable by people who should be there according to the mission tree, something somewhere has gone wrong in terms of balancing.
---
Am I whining now? Maybe. I want to play the game, but the difference between me and the people who seem to do nothing but play the game makes it so that i'm either limited to the start area until I reach level 100 or must get lucky and find a server that doesn't have people in it with more than 10 levels above me.
---
Watch that's what colonel Autumn is going to look like in the fallout 3 in fallout 4 mod.
---
I got mine a couple months ago and registered it but no bugs happened. What happens now when you do it?
---
Also please make it so 1 of the 3 Ultracite plans it drops not ALWAYS be Explosive vent
---
Dont get your panties in a bunch. That is expensive compared to other ammos my guy. 
---
Sometimes people see the kernel of greatness where others do not and invest in nurturing that which others would stamp out of existence.  I think that applies to FO76, you love it or hate it, there are may not be so many people in the middle.
---
One of Roses.  Not sure if you need to be on it to trigger the trap.
---
Not sure why all the other comments are saying they exist.... because they don't.
---
Good luck! I got my hunting rifles so maybe you can get your pipe revolver :D
---
Cons: never did enough for me, made it so I can't build how I want.
---
Fuck 'em.
---
I've literally never had them help enough to justify their existence. Enemies are either good at avoiding them or are too tough.. or are brought over BY the turrets. So whatever. I just repair what I gotta every so often and that's that.
---
Knuckles or so are necessary, but with all stacked mutations and Party Boy/Girl you can smash out 200+ with just knuckles.

Please.

---
My issue with the queen is explosive vents. Typical women doesn't know what men want. She just keeps on dropping that plan. 
---
Yeah, it's not obvious. Only reason I noticed was due to the first time I crafted rad shields I ended up with an odd number. 
---
God forbid you ask for evidence to these claims lol. Anecdotals everywhere but no one has a *single* video of it happening. **Not one single video on the entirety of the internet** If that's not telling you something, I don't know what is.
---
Holorifle confirmed! /s
---
&gt; but the duper's inventory would be rolled back to before they dropped the item, hence they would own a second copy
---
Is this particular bit confirmed to be fixed? It is the core issue that can be exploited for duping, that your inventory can be rolled back to a state where you still have an item that you previously gave away to another player, who manages to keep it as well (e.g. because they hopped to another server before yours crashed and rolled back). The same concept could also be applied to robot vendors. The board crafting trick was just one way to exploit the flaw in how saves are (or hopefully only were) handled.
---
There's a "Bethesda replied" post somewhere on here that said it is coming out today.  I wish there was a way to track those.
---
Sooo, you don't have an example then?
---
Your assumption is that the only reason this has for existing is to create multiple mule characters is also wrong. Given the state of the respec system, a lot of people have 5 very different characters that they actively play. I personally have an unarmed non-PA one, a PA melee weapon low-HP one, a shotgunner, a rifleman and a heavy gunner. Very different setups for each. So when I get a two-shot explosive Minigun on my unarmed non-PA character, I really cannot use it. Heavies require Stabilized perk, which requires PA. The ability to take a gun, that I, the player, have earned myself, and give it to one of my characters that actually *can* use it would be nice. Has nothing to do with muling or twinking.
---
Most importantly, you can already do this, in at least 2 ways. Meaning, this **already exists**. All that people are asking is for an easy, reliable, safe and convenient way to do this. 
---
15 is just fine for now.  What we need is either loadouts or make these situational perks passive.   Crafting/lock/hack.  
---
Still kinda heavy, any perks that reduce weight on kitchen items?
---
If you did that get a ban email, I wouldn't assume you were banned. I had similar login errors a few times and just needed to close the app and try a few times to get in.
---
Check your junk mail because everyone who was actually banned so far seems to have e received an email with instructions to appeal the ban. If you didn't this may be something else.
---
The fences at the very bottom of the defences menu snap to the edges of floor tiles
---
The weight is amazing!
---
&gt; Something that you can already do easily if you have 2-way communication with a trusted friend online at the same time
---
Oh, it's easy already! Great, don't need to add something that allows you to do this without that trusted friend. 
---
Sorry. Why would they put something in the game, that would literally allow for so many Mule characters with maxed out stash boxes, when one of the designs of the game is limits?
---
By the way. You can have things you didn't earn as a low level. Plans, recipes, under armor. I mean, did some of you read the OP?
---
Friend randoms build on their base help with quests only use a combat knife treasure hunts stop grinding 
---
Oh damn thanks my dude!
---
When I walk up on some one in the vendor, I will wait around for a few minutes.  If they don't finish in a timely manor i will start unloading my ammo into the wall right behind them.  Most will drop trade so you can snag the vendor while they check their hp.  
---
In FO4 I modded a two shot plasma gun into a Plasma Thrower, and let me tell you enemies just melted against that thing.   I've been keeping an eye out for the same legendary but no luck.   Anyone tried this yet? Any good? 
---
I feel like its in the artisans store
---
Both are good ideas, especially the first one. Every weapon I use is a legendary so thankfully I won’t accidentally scrap any important weapons but I did have to tiptoe around the scrap menu in the early levels. And for my armor, all the pieces I wear outside of PA are legendary too but I do have the chance to scrap my Power Armor chassis and that would really, really suck.
---
Called it 😂
---
I can HEAR it!! 
---
Probably gonna have to wait for mods to come later this year, hopefully.  
---
Yeah I've seen a lot of people talking about their camps being wiped. I find this hard to believe. Even with TSE weapons or fatmen, wiping a camp is no easy task. On top of that the person would rack up a huge bounty and become a big juicy target for everyone else on the server.
---
Personally, I've never seen anyone with a wiped camp, never had my camp wiped, nor never seen anyone with a bounty over 500. I think a possible explanation of all this is that people have their camps in high traffic areas like near vendors, farmable spawns etc, and their camp is getting attacked by super mutants, mole rats etc that slowly over time destroy much of the camp. And as for the bounties, I've read that there's a bug where sometimes a bounty appears double than it really is, but when you fast travel to them the bounty is half of what you saw it to be earlier.
---
I assume that it is. Knowing how much of this sub loves to see the game fail, I'd expect to see front page posts an hour after the update if this wasn't the case. Since nobody has mentioned this and dupers appear to have resorted to older methods, it seems to me that the core issue was indeed fixed, but I have not personally tested it
---
I love Monster Mash--great event.  The issue(s) is (and will always be) that PvP has no incentive, alot of disincentive, and as reloading a new world where you are the only participant in Monster Mash is so easy, rarely does anyone actually compete/PvP in the event.  I personally love to PvP (though FO76 can hardily call whatever that system is PvP); but there needs to be an incentive to do so.  Like factions or cosmetic items that are unlocked via PvP (e.g. raider paint jobs, etc).  Just my 2 caps.
---
Agree
---
Buttstallion cease-and-decist letter from Gearbox is in the mail. lol
---
I managed to get stairs up two levels, though that involved putting an extra foundation for the bottom one to snap to. The second then snapped to my upper floor.
---
You can't make something that people can spam farm always drop top tier gear.  If this was a once a week/month thing, thats different, but when a group can literally drop 3 nukes and kill SBQ 3 times in less than an hour (I was on a server where this happened) then jump to another server, guaranteed 3* drops is too much,
---
It is already available for people with a trusted friend online (and ability to communicate),  and everyone on consoles. Are mules already omnipresent? How would it hurt for PC loners to be extended the same courtesy?  
---
In fact, if you're worried about mules and server load, this actually HELPS by dumping stuff onto characters rarely logged in, that would've otherwise been carted around all the time
---
Uh, I don't know if others will have a similar experience, but all I keep anymore are the super stims. If I need to heal small amounts of health, I just eat food. With carnivore, the meats I cook heal a lot, and the healing of a super stim is like double a regular one or something, and only 50% more weight.  I just carry less, like 10-15 at a time. 
---
Sell stims, keep super stims, eat food.
---
I believe the issue happens when you register a set that someone gives you, rather than crafting the set yourself thru the questline and then registering it.
---
I think it makes you unable to complete it, and therefore unable to get the Power Armor Station plans.
---
So that's why I have 6 of those bad larrys?
---
The world is full of kindness if you know where to look. There are some douchebag bros that will wreck ur shit up tho. But worry not. If you are on PC and u need help, u can add me (blodskaal) im lvl 70, still dont have any legendary gear or nothing, but i can craft you some gear, give u some stims and help u out with a quest or 3
---
Pro tip: if someome wrecks ur camp, u can repair all of it by going to ur C.A.M.P device and clicking R(i think). Also can access ur stash thru it
---
Just roll with the main quest and don't fast travel. lots of enemies. lots of xp. And: Be well rested, and craft stuff... You really don't need someone to pull you through to lvl.
---
or shot blue radiation out of their asses like scorchbeasts can do occasionally
---
i want to kill people to try this but at the sametime i dont because i will get destroyed
---
well there's about dozen more masks yet to be released. 
---
I just minor damage I get from players in those events and they do the same from me.  So far that seems to work just fine.
---
Niccce
---
mandont you hate it when your trying to save someone and just eat them by mistake
---
Harpoons and missiles for me.
---
A harpoon is .2  which isn't much but I had 100 harpoons 
---
Missiles even like 10 is a shitload.
---
Mini nukes too but they aren't as common as missiles so I normally only need to drop 1 or 2
---
Couldn't  
---
Didn't  
---
These words are different.  
---
Nice attempt at wriggling out of being called on your kneejerk envy though :D
---
Chuck Norris kills SB by screaming at them!
---
Didn't mean to decline the chat. I can shadow it all I'll have to check and see if I can dense it though
---
As long as the server doesn't die. Which can be... variable.
---
I use the full adrenaline perk. It’s awesome. I can’t see how it makes sense to think it’s bad to have the full perk because each point you put in it is giving you the same as the last.
---
join us in the feast
---
I know right? I had to drop all of my bobby pins to pick it up.
---
Ooh nice!
---
That's basically like having one of those "realistic" looking pellet guns :D
---
Then turn those regular stims into 4 diluted stims with chemist
---
What do you mean about consoles ? it needs a trusted third party like on pc.
---
Who knows, its all headcanon really so its not like its gonna hurt anyone either way
---
Don’t worry about the dense I can grind for that, the shadowed however is a huge bonus so thanks! What’s your gt? 
---
WOOOAH! (Thats English for stop a Horse) Easy now! But yes on the break down ammo we have to make other ammo, i NEVER have enough .45 EVER!
---
It was changed in a recent patch to make the Supply Drop box locked to the person who sent the signal. It's a level 0 lock, so anyone can pick it... but doing so flags them for PvP.
---
-6 is weird? Doesnt Marsupial only deduct 4 from int?
---
Thats the proposed plan, because of the Atom Shop
---
Here we go again. You got an example?
---
Throw a Grape Mentats in there for 10 Charisma and an extra bonus to vendor prices.
---
Maybe the Appalachia needs a Vigilante???
---
Umm no I still love Bethesda, have over 1-2k hours in every game they made, and still make mods. Just stating they shafted Obsidian that did happen, and fallout 4 fell short in comparison of expectations and is not as good as the Witcher 3. 
---
I've seen two. One right after a nuke was dropped in a nearby zone, and one *very* brief one while I was traveling through the Savage Divide.
---
Or more with super duper
---
Make sure your wife doesn't sees it, will be hell for you next time you come homw drunk.
---
The fact you opted to go on the defensive before anyone even constested you is already suspect honestly. But you have no evidence besides your anecdote which is of basically no value.   
---
However there are multiple videos debunking these claims
---
 Here is a video of a guy using the bobblehead exploit to achieve tens of thousands of damage on his weapons and doing no more than 5 damage.  
---
https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ  
---
I see two options for your narrative:  
---
* User error. ( You probably fucked up and started PvP and didn't realize it). 
---
* You're lying. (Why are you lying? Please stop.)
---
The vaults are going to be dungeons and you’ll want to group up to fight them. Similar thing.
---
Dense armor is only available for chest armor and apprently it's -50% explosive dmg. If we assume the guy in the webm had 5 pieces of pvp armor wouldn't that be -40% reduction? Plus we don't know if it's additive or multiplicative, but even in the "best case" for him it would have been -90% explosive dmg, so still enough to lose a sliver of health?
---
That said I've had the same happen with ballistic weapons as well. That guy and the one I went after with a bloodied dragon that does 1000 dmg at 50% hp both had excessive bounties and took no dmg, coincidence? The game has no cheat protection or client side verification so it would be very easy to spoof a packet that tells the server you have a constant 100% hp
---
You still could. I can turn 1 stimpack (1lb) into 4 diluted stims (2lbs). 8 (4lbs) if super duper procs.
---
Bobby pins weigh next to nothing now tho
---
If one of the designs of the game is limits, are you advocating applying those limits to all the people who play that game?   
---
That console players shouldn't be able to 'join' servers through the 'recent' list, or that there should be limits on the number of items transferred between characters ?
---
Scorch Beasts aren't even that scary, just annoying AF.  Even the SBQ who ultimately works on a similar mechanic isn't as stupid as regular SB.
---
You can just buy the power armor station plans from a vendor in the Whitesprings bunker.
---
Well, if "nothing ever came of that," then, "you have proper *evidence,"* RIGHT?!? I think someone needs to remove their White Knight perk. 
---
For example, who cares if the reports of a trade steal exploit were fake? Then the fakers were just karma whores, and those 'exposing' them probably were too. However, if even ONE person has a situation where someone trade steals from them from that moment on, and they come to this forum and try to get help, shitheads calling them liars and victim blaming will be the response. All because of people like you. Don't blame the players. Ask for details if you want them. Help people if you can. Let Bethesda work out the truth if they can. That's their job. Oh, and don't pretend to know what Bethesda has or has not, and is or is not working on. That makes you a liar. Unless, "you have proper *evidence*."
---
Where did you find this info?
---
Lol. You guys think you are all clever with your attempts to make cheaty things sound like legitimate quality of life upgrades to the game.
---
But you are all lazier gamers. You need unlimited space, because you can't think for yourself, and then say, I don't want to do inventory management. You have to do it, because you just grab everything, so you don't have to actually think.
---
You grind for the best gear, the most caps, XP to level really fast. 
---
Then complain that you are bored, bored, bored. Nothings a challenge.
---
The game isn't convenient enough for you. 
---
Envy? Why would I envy a bunch of lazy gamers that have a hissy fit when you ask them to put a little thought into playing?
---
They'll like it less if you just leave and don't play into their power fantasies. Not really my style though I will say. You want to try to jack me? Fine. I'll play along and take down at least one of you trying. Go ahead and  low up my camp I made out of trash I found on the side of the street. There's plenty more garbage lying around to make it again. 
---
Most of the haters left, hopefully the doomsayers will be gone soon as well.
---
Well they are kinda getting one lol cull the herd
---
If it was towards the south I found this too. "Merchant deathclaw." No reports of anyone finding it alive though. May have killed it myself when swarmed by ghouls that were going to attack it, or the OTHER deathclaw that was behind me.
---
65%? pffft 
---
They should change it so the paper bag is sparkly when you drop shit like that and walk away.
---
I wish it became a very rare drop from 3* enemies, it would be awesome now that duping is supposedly gone.
---
By the way. Did you read your own post? Can you SEE what plans or recipes a character has read? Or the stats on someone's underarmor? OK, maybe they could only get Enclave Armor themselves if they'd bought it off a vendor after someone else sold it, but if that is what's 'always annoying' to you, then I'm not sure what to suggest... Maybe meditation?
---
Message me your PSN. Im generally carrying some sort of extra plans 👍
---
If you create your character during the B.E.T.A. that's 
---
IMO bobbleheads should have just worked same as they used to. Ie there's only 7 in the game all hidden and they buff your special once. The way they are now is crap and I never use them
---
*spoilers ahead*
---
There is actually an observatory that the government had converted into a weather weapon. The telescope was converted into a large cannon that would be able to fire these shells I assume.
---
If you are level 40 and have two TSE handmade?   I would say there is probably 97% chance you bought the TSE or cheated to get them.   I am level 120 and never seen any drop.   Not even a 2 shot.   A few explosives though.
---
I would think that as long as the perk didn't say "(no power armor)" that it would work while in it.
---
Yesterday, on ps4, the game would crash after 10-15 minutes of play. It was unplayable.
---
You would be mistaken friend. Serendipity for example does not work in pa.
---
I can’t remember the name of it but it was a YouTube video and there was also an article. I think they said it would be a future dlc.
---
What i always did was go to vault 80 (i think. The one with alot of clean items, and the vault was never used) i always grabbed clean plates and mugs, and used the static item mod. Though over time, through many load screens the items would clip through surfaces. But thats what id love
---
ya i got a 2shot assualtron head in my stash waiting to be used. also want to know more aboot this player vending thing they mentioned, i got so many plans i want to sell ingame if possible(without middleman stuff like the reddit bazzaar)
---
&gt; unable to get the Power Armor Station plans
---
Luckily those plans can be bought at vendors if this happens to you. But, good info regardless. 
---
Wish there was a way to filter for all "Bethesda replied" posts....
---
Bethesda could adjust the Tables of the Vendors.
---
It may not even need a Patch, could be Serverside.
---
But they just dont care.
---
Cheers! Glad you like it :D
---
The budget with level was tested to be false. 
---
I'm wondering if Bethesda implemented a hidden tracking system in their latest patches?
---
There are good people in the wasteland. Hence why I keep playing. But yea, those asshole raiders did the same thing to me the other day!
---
&gt; never happened to me.
---
First of all as an end user, beyond a 'normal' requested disconnection, you can't tell why you got disconnected. A server crash and a simple disconnect look exactly the same to you. 
---
And you are saying that your client has never 'bluescreened' ( or whatever the term is now )? That's amazing.

You get a lot more of them show up if you run with Pharma Farmer and search medical kits.

Its been 3 months and they have released zero new content and fixed zero of the games biggest bugs. Austin is fixing things at a glacial pace but i dont expect them to shut down the rampant black market or fix duping ever. No doubt the DC office is focused on the future, sadly.
---
I love dramas like this!
---
To be fair, he should be younger.. :\^)
---
Bring back the giant Bloat Fly from old world blues that one shot your ass through power armor. ~*Good times*~
---
Er.. The Fashnacht mask \*is\* in the game.  I found it laying on a table where you play the musical instruments to bring the Nightstalker.
---
A friend gave me plan for the Marine armor Helmet and he does not dupe or buy from others.  He found it somewhere.
---
I have BOS mods on my combat armor (not paint), but they have the star/logo of BOS and different color.
---
All these are legal.
---
not evey 3 star is top tier gear. i wouldnt be mad if she dropped me a acrobat leather leg with lockpick sweet spot bigger. The point is that fighting the end game boss is pointless and rewardless a majority of the time.
---
That's suspicious as hell, I'm not seeing any health lost on that guy.
---
I got more
---
I hope you recorded it. Ah who am I kidding of course you didn't. Because this "bug" does not exist.   
---
No amount of damage will one shot a player who is not currently engaged in PvP *regardless* of level and until any can produce a **single instance of it** any claims of it should be dismissed.  
---
Pro tip for PS4 users the 'share' button can record gameplay.  
---
Pro tip for Nvidia card users install GeForce software and you too can record gameplay with the push of a button. Default UI command is alt+z.
---
I thought there was one in the production area?
---
I'll admit those are one of my favourite as well!
---
In what plan are the support beams packed? Cant seem to find them when I browse my items in CAMP.
---
Unfortunately there are very limited mechanics for actual engaging PVP. This leaves it up to the community to create interesting situations. While the restrictions I place on my roleplay prevents me from being truly competitive against these people I do have a fun little trick I can use to try to get their loot. The best part about this particular method is that it requires my target to be unprepared(no dense+fireproof, sentinel) and for me to outsmart them.
---
Yea i use the bazaar cause its all there is, but i would much rather go and find player vending machines and then finding a good deal or gun would be way cooler
---
I get what you're saying but those of us who don't min/max and spend 24 hours online get shit for rewards. I don't think the 10 or so SBQs I have killed have ever dropped anything I actually felt was a reward. Lots of it got abandoned in the Rad zone to make space for mob loot and Flux. That's broken.
---
And I played anyway.. cussing all the more.
---
I'm still waiting for my chance and carrying some Orbital Strike Beacons exactly for this purpose, so here's a question: do you have to disable Pacifist before attacking someone's camp?
---
Parkour!
---
I will be legitimately disappointed if I don’t start hearing about the adventures of the vault chef 
---
I just pop a stealth boy for reactor and mainframe. 2 minutes is plenty of time to run them.
---
Thanks so much, I appreciate you and was unaware that sub existed!
---
it really isnt when compared to all the hassle to do it
---
Yeah it is weird. -2 is what is displayed when I view my effects but my SPECIAL is showing -6.
---
You must just have to own the Workshop, then.  Normally you can't fast travel to any Workshop... at least that's what I've seen.
---
Where have you seen info that i'm level 40 ?
---
I'm 170 and i bought first TSE Double barrel in first days of release, bought this one just for trade since i don't wanna sell the one i actually use.
---
Btw handmades were used just for examplw.
---
My man those plans you just got are rare and not the easiest to find for the masses.
---
I mean.. if that suppressor effect stacks with the Suppressor perk card this might actually be kinda fun to use with that swing speed boost.  Add in Blocker, Dodgy, and Lone Wanderer and you'll take almost no melee damage from stuff you hit.  I'd definitely give this bad boy a chance!
---
no one knows
---
As I understand it, on consoles you get use 'join' from the recent players tab, whether the account is friended or not, as well as the friends tab, whereas on PC, you can only use 'join' from the friends tab.   
---
Happy to be corrected on that, as I've only got PC to check. But that's what I've gathered from reading a lot of the comments online
---
I always used to lean guns up against the wall and place dirty plates in the sink and make them static. I used to spend whole play sessions decorating. Now im struggling to build a symetrical structer around my large purifier to protect it. Which is a huge pain. Lol
---
YAY ME!
---
&gt; **Trade**: Fixed an issue where players could view another player’s inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.  
---
&gt;**Trade**: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade. 
---
Yep. Rumored trade issues. Totally false...
---
You could probably use two accounts on one computer with a virtual desktop.
---
Xbox. GT is WildMutfruit.
---
Haha ive learned theres generally some work around, its just working around it that you have to figure out haha
---
Don't forget the squirrel that spawns over to the N side of the main building, between the entrance and the maintenence building.  There's a couple trees at the end of the main building wing in a small courtyard, and I always see it there.  Tasty squirrel stew.
---
Of course not. Why would you also abandon the thing inside valuable enough to put into a safe? Safes are an insane bitch to move around and are relatively cheap to buy a new one. Or course, these safes in the game were "abandoned" because of one of the 2 fairly sudden apocalypses that hit West Virginia recently and I would imagine that the owners didnt have the time or inclination to grab what was inside. Which is just going to be some MedX, 4 prewar dollars, and a silver spoon anyway. 
---
I try my best to keep them hoping we get a update like this
---
*lying.  
---
*User Error.  
---
I kid you not, those are their only options at this point. There is no evidence of this happening anyone on the internet.
---
I see them a lot in the flatwoods area too. I am usually dropping off loot. I will fast travel to vault 76 and make the normal run to the overseer's camp and flatwoods. There are Frogs, Foxes, or Chickens it is random really. Though I usually see the frogs by the lake down a little ways from the moonshine shack.
---
Yea i spend ridiculous amounts of time with badass construction, only to have to downsize just to furnish it :/  we need a bigger budget for sure
---
Let me give you a dev reply "Thank you for the suggestion, it is not on our immediate priority list at this time, stay tuned for more information soon."
---
Nice, maybe your character is one of Colonel Autumn's ancestors.
---
You have other equipment giving you -4 INT?
---
I haven't tried that yet (since I have to desktops side by side)
---
I know some games you can rename the exe file in order to run 2 instances of it at once. 
---
Well, I suppose it could count as a 'heat of the moment' thing, I guess? :)
---
Were you bored when you wrote this essay? 
---
Sure but repair all isn't free. The person who destroyed the turrets only loses what 10 caps per turret?
---
&gt;Take a salt tablet.
---
What why not a pitchfork for trident RP
---
I have all those mods u mentioned! Though for me, on xbox, after a few load screens and returning back to my settlement, items would clip through surfaces
---
Thanks! I know a trading hub has been suggested for a while, but I wanted to put my own idea into it
---
They saved my hide early game but later on I kinda ignore em
---
I see these a lot in un-nuked Whitesprings.  Sometimes they do drop legendaries, and I've even had weird experiences where if I kill a group of them all the inventory ends up on a single ghoul body which has 2-3 legendaries.  Some sort of server hiccup if you kill several simultaneously I guess.
---
Cell phones and melee weapons require +3 Agility.
---
B-thez ? Is this some gangsta rap shit or whatever is cool these days ?
---
Not really, its just a property of an object. If you are not doing any calculations with that field or manipulations?  no impact.
---
Lets say that everytime your character logs in, it just does a check for the unique identifer between all your other legendaries (stash and on character).  This is just a simple search function.   It will only add to the length of time it takes to log in as all.  Plus you can put that code on client side in the executable.  No strain on the server and if it detects duplication, just send flag to the server and ensure you get temp banned right away.  
---
Even in javascript, its very easy to implement a search based on a property of object.  Obj.find(function (data) { [data.ID](https://data.ID) = [priorData.id](https://priorData.id) }
---
Or you can just do enumeration and handle it that way.
---
Or old style and go with bubblesort (more intensive)
---
Maybe also take an addictol and a disease cure?
---
Ohh, I did all of her quests I just must not remember this. Thanks! :)
---
permalink ?
---
Nope. If I take RadX my intel returns to 8?
---
And there are so many collectable items in 76 u cant keep. Like the different coloured teddy bears. Or the robot statues
---
Yeah. If you load things in quickly it's easy to accidentally load in some of your inventory. It's annoying how these things just enter the list then if you accidentally click on them, while hurrying, you can't get them back.
---
I just do not care about the stuff in the Atom shop. It is great others do. If have enough Atoms to get something, I do, but I honestly don't care.
---
never mind Fallout I want this irl
---
If they can drop plans then I'm all over this. I have about 40 or more saved.  I was super annoyed that they're player locked now. What I'm going to start doing is take the items out of the box, jump on top and then drop the bag with the loot there for anyone else to have without turning "red".  Paying it forward..
---

No they don't; it doesn't exist. I love that you get down voted for even asking though smh lmao.
---
1. Who the fuck records every minute of their gameplay?. Why the hell do i even have to?.... in all my many years in gaming Jesus Christ....
---
2. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aaedli/want_to_know_why_the_servers_are_unstable_bethesda/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
This is far from the first fucking time i have had to deal with these cunts. Its getting worse and its not fun.
---
3. I am in a pissed off mood my anger should not be directed at you but your irking me because your not helping the problem at all. Stop making excuses and how about help us to get Bethesda to stop the stacking exploit among other issues.
---
Sorry but jesus man...
---
Orbital strike sure is pretty too
---
I hear you, it's amazingly useful for exploring. One point in Sun Kissed and my health bar just clears up and restores itself after any rad exposure.
---
Ah that’s a good idea. I don’t see any other effects listed but could be a disease or addiction. The fact that RadX temporarily fixes it has me leaning towards a bug but I’ll give this a shot
---
Vsync is off, running in borderless window...
---
Ok, thanks
---
They can’t ban people who bought duped weapons for caps but didn’t exploit themselves. They’d get sued to death.
---
I'm so sick of scorch beasts. Their near constant stream of sonic attacks, that also apparently cannot miss ever, that also apparently travel through hard cover like hills and concrete barriers, but worst of all that stupid bullshit is blinding.
---
Sure terrorize us with an obnoxious boring enemy, but at least let me fucking see what I'm attacking. Nope all I get is a screen full of green and blue.
---
I'm pretty sure they originally stated they were doing the snallbincrease to 600 but were planning further increases once they were sure the servers were still stable with 600.
---
However, dupers have probably ruined that for awhile because the servers are being extremely overloaded with inventories containing much more data than even an entire server's worth of players should have, causing uber instabilities. 
---
Wasteland is now a true wasteland. 
---
Lucky Hole is incredible. Even after Dunwich and Parsons, I still wasn't expecting to see &gt;!a Great Old One napping down there!&lt;.
---
I wanted carnivore originally and had it briefly before I overdid clearing mutations trying to get rid of a specific one.  I ended up with herbivore 2nd go around and actually love it.  I like to use veggie soups anyways for same reason as above so it works well
---
That would be a problem. Maybe they can salvage the scrap from the item, but the item stays there?
---
I bought the Santa suit :( rip
---
Trolly McTrollface, begone :p
---
Lmao stop lying. Did you record it?
---
I’ve been a player for a long time and I’m not ok with that. Speak for yourself and no one else.
---
Weird, I scrapped a few fruits and veg, all the way out, to no storage 0% on my bar. Left for the day. Patch comes. Open up the client and find all the food i'd scrapped is now 'stored' instead, the stored bar is now functioning properly, and a bunch of 'phantom' items appeared. but were identical to items i had sitting outside of my 2x3x3. Weirdest goddamn thing. No other errors to report, but i've noticed those items duped inside had no condition. 
---
I didn't get it. Why do you need a stash there?
---
new mole rat spawn points added on all floors of house, roof is now a scorchbeast nest
---
Stopped pvp at level 80, at that point, you realize that most people past level 60 can quickly kill you regardless of level. It just becomes harder to earn caps back, because you have to kill most enemies twice to earn one death back.
---
Not to mention that with this melee meta, even a level 40 can steamroll you.
---
Again. If you can already do this so easy, you don't need a way to do it even easier. 
---
you are all acting like you are just trying to pass on things to your other characters. But in truth, you just want to bypass the stash limit.  
---
That's all. Claiming it's already easy is bullshit. It requires having friends, which some of you clearly don't, because you prefer to play solo. 
---
So sorry, not buying this, it's already easy. No, it's not. It's already possible is what you are really saying. 
---
You just hate having to find someone, or a friend, give them the stuff, log out, log in, and then transfer the stuff again, and then log back to your other character.
---
And whenever you want something on your mule, you have to do that all over again. Doesn't sound so easy. And it's time consuming it seem.
---
So yeah. You got tricked, and the truth comes out. 
---
Sorry, but no methods to transfer your stuff from one character to another. 
---
Try playing the game as it's designed, instead of spending time trying to game the system because you're a lazy gamer. 
---
Maybe you have an addiction? I hear it doesn't tell you when your addicted.
---
Sorry, not insinuating your level. I was just providing a what-if scenerio that would be an easy thing to check for.  Was not intending to point any fingers here.  Just like you use the term "handmades".  I'm just trying to show that these TSE are all almost always dupes or purchased dupes.  Very few are actually non-dupe.  They are supposed to be the rarest in the game.
---
He’s trying to tell you to go to their official news sites I think. Like Twitter. But instead of just saying it out right he’s trolling.
---
Yeah I found the witch plans on halloween corpses. There's also a male corpse wearing the vampire costume. No plans for that though, probably because it's on the atom store. 
---
got plans
---
I've had plans for assaultron, eye bot, and sentry bot helmets and I have no idea where I got them.  I have two buddies that are 60s and 110s and are lacking the plans though. 
---
They aren’t allowed to ban people for that. They’d get sued so hard they’d still be in debt a decade from now.
---
Man, I get angry just looking at that gun.  And another thing -- range 60, accuracy 16.  16.  Yet you can get sniped with these guns from miles away because of the explosive radius on the rounds and the sheer number of pellets.  I still don't understand how these things just showed up in a multiplayer game after being completely broken in Fallout 4.
---
LOL OP downvoted you! Don't worry bruh I'll bring you back to positive.
---
Yeah, I assumed it was due to my crap Internet 
---
If you want to save them on PC follow this steps (I'm sorry for the bad english):   
---
\- take a pic with photo mode, then you have to do a screenshot with the xbox's function (double tap on xbox symbol and Y). 
---
\- Now you must go on [xboxdvr.com](https://xboxdvr.com) and you could manage the screenshot, save it into PC and load on Reddit 
---
Although there is a photomode in FO76, you can't save the photos in game direct to xbox from PC  
---
I agree it isnt realistic due to nonbig cities, but the fast travel is a point. If you fast travel all the time the gane feels small. If you walk places, then you notice the vast size of the game. 
---
maybe YOU are the troll.  what game are you playing?  "sends you a message"?????
---
Not only that but full Bethesda.net accounts. 
---
There was a mod for that on FO4.  Not sure, but it might be possible to contact the mod author and see what might be necessary to transplant that mod over as a tex-replacement for 76.
---
While i'm sure that my first double barrel is a legit TSE, the second one is probably a dupe.
---
It's a dumb workaround, but after hours of trying, someone on here told me you have to stack two steel beams to the stairs, then remove the lowest one so the top beam is floating. Then you can place a staircase. Oh. And It breaks physics for anything touching it, so you won't be able to move or remove floors that are connected.
---
How long have we known about this bug? 
---
Gotta be careful with that. I try to only swap piece for piece in party chat/after talking for a little bit. Check their reddit history. 
---
They do spawn outside the circle.  I got some near the furthest north green west of the club house and in the multistory building near it.
---
I just found an explosive shotgun the other day. It is OP, I mainly use it to destroy all the damn bots attacking Phoenix instead of wasting more ammo to fix a problem that shouldn't have been one in the first place. Other than that I just stick with my 50% Anti Armor lever rifle and Damage output redux Shotty and my melee weapon. 
---
I'm afraid if I used that shotgun as a regular weapon, I'd be blowing my own ass up constantly. 
---
Colonel Fall
---
I've been saving them because they're fantastic for healing my idiot ass when I get into a bad situation, but good lord 70 of them is a nightmare regardless of perks.
---
I am on Xbox but are you really sure to give me yours
---
I am trying to figure out what 'slap' damage is. I am thinking some kind of splash damage from area effect weapons since explosive weapons do splash damage. To me SLAP is a kind of armor piercing round meaning Saboted Light Armor Piercing used for .50 cal and I think has been developed for some of the 7.62x51 aka .308 in civilian calibers. I haven't really played any multiplayer shooter games as I only got back into gaming late in 2017 and have mainly played single player games. 
---
Sounds pretty cool.
---
I would watch that for way more time than I would admit.
---
Is there a way to choose if quick stim uses super or regular? (right D-pad on controller) The only time I'd ever want to use a super stim is when I am about to die, and in a game that can't pause, I can only use whatever shows up after hitting quick stim.
---
Get off my lawn!
---
Totally done this. Only the one I saw was close to a town, the guy put a tool chest next to a power armor station behind a level 2 locked door. I figured it was a power armor spawn point. It was a lure, and I fell for it. And once I became wanted, got 1 shotted. Sometimes thing can be mean, but still fun and amusing. 
---
Handy to know! Still have that one outstanding! 
---
havent seen this posted yet so here goes:
---
if you have the "electrically charged" mutation, it will trigger pvp as if you attacked if you have passive mode off. a lot of people dont know this and assume they can just take slap damage with passive mode off.
---
also the only bobblehead that stacks is the explosive one, all others function normally
---
I don’t know. You’d have to ask them, but for the most part they’re irrational and won’t give you a real answer.
---
Most people acknowledge the fact that the game is a mess and Bethesda are a bunch of cunts. I do. I also enjoy the game, however frustrating it can be, and I’ll defend the game, just not the developers.
---
Almost everyone who buys these items like TSE or paints, know they are probably from dupers. 
---
its the reason I refuse to buy any items at all from players.  No serums, no ammo, no weapons, no "cool" items.  Not a single thing.  The exploiters have screwed the game up and I dont want to contribute to that.
---
I'll take this too minus the flames. But more realistically I need everything Nuka Cola. Bed, lamp, door, floor, statues, furniture. 
---
Just a tip after the one encounter for the Missing Link quest, shooting + nades to get its HP down somewhat and then you want it to come close to you, then out comes the super sledge and BAM CRUSH SMASH it goes down like an OP tin can lol.  It interrupts them a lot, + some staggering.......
---
It is a serious issue but wasn't "just overlooked". It's not something you can stack accidentally. 
---
He's Steve Carrell with his fantasy character "Michael Scarn" 
---
Yeah, I ran into the issue of having floors that can't be removed if they're attached to stairs because "this would leave an object without support."
---
Get off the gene pool !
---
Glad it wasn't a yao guai in that case. It may have survived the fall.
---
You won't be laughing when that irradiated pancake DLC boss attacks
---
But pay your bill or the duper’s will break the bank
---
Yep. Dupers are ruining servers. Apparently the reason I had so many disconnects recently is cause of how they are duping
---
I got the blackbird
---
Yes..
---
.. yet you risk buying items off players and know exploitation has probably occured that got you that item?  No way would risk it.
---
Not THE Ricky Spanish, the most hated man in all of Appalachia? :O
---
This is where my thought came from, I always ran that mod in 4. It just looked so much better, even with the NPC's.
---
Yes, they said they don't have the tools to reimburse items.
---
I've seen one rad storm. It was gorgeous! The sky looked amazing. 
---
Ok will do!
---
It's very fortunate for bethesda's PR that the crashes and disconnects are being blamed on players and not on bethesda. I'm sure they appreciate it.
---
if you have "electrically charged" mutation, it will trigger pvp even if you dont return fire
---
You cannot sell plans to vendors.  You can only sell them to players.
---
Same ! I'm playing on PC
---
The big excavator atop mount Blair?
---
Yes it should. It’s bugged. Has been this entire time.
---
Ok I got you. 
---
No faster reload? Damn, you got robbed. 
---
I have medic pump, supers work best for tough battles. Traveling farmacy is a must
---
For the Warriors out there, I can see how this would be massively frustrating. Even more so because level and visible equipment mean nothing :/
---
Let us dilute them into Stimpack  x2
---
relax...he was being sarcastic
---
You honestly think i will be gone for long. Do you even know how cheap the game is. I am getting another one regardless.
---
this doesn't remove the need for a trusted third party. Are you really going to give loot to a rando and hope he'll give it back when you reconnect ?
---
Should i carefully check everything i buy ?
---
At the time i bought the plan the fact that the dev room was accesed wasn't known
---
Rice
---
I wonder if pacifist mode can still trigger pvp acceptance. Maybe this was what happened: You both hit each other during the event. This happens all the time during that event. With pacifist on you don't do damage. Event ends and the player sees a red dot on his map/radar, then targets and kills you. Couldn't have been too difficult with only hazmat on, especially when that player obviously was geared up for sbq.
---
search this reddit for Random Encounters. server hopping those spots can get you the plans for Witch costume, Skeleton costume, Skiing Outfit, and a lot of Civil War outfits. I also got the Flannel shirt plan in the building by the Harpers Ferry spawn point, and the BOS knight and soldier outfits from the train near NAR trainyard.
---
Yea I know, just want them to fix this bug. more than 2 months in the game now
---
Is that right? I can’t find you. Are those is or ls 
---
I found a wedding ring but can't remember where, been looking for another as I play with my fiancee, thanks for this info I'll check it out. 
---
Yep.  Usually I get in the word and go to look at the pipboy and it freezes solid.   It’s happened on the first launch every time I’ve started up since the patch.   It usually works the second load but I am careful not to pull up the pipboy right away when the world loads. 
---
Thought you meant selling to players, haven't checked vendors tho
---
Thanks for the correction! I haven't had it slotted in a while (been working on my CHA alt) so i wasn't 100% sure on the numbers
---
If we still had the shortcuts of Fallout 4, I'd use them. However in the heat of battle, faffing about with the favourites wheel or, god forbid, the inventory menu during combat...
---
So I agree. They are useless. Let us break them down.
---
On this subject though... when we hit left does it use a stimpak or a diluted stimpak or either? I ask because I had a lot of diluted stimpaks that seemed to disappear and my only possible reason is that they are on that button. That important button that only seems to work about 1 time out of 4 in the heat of battle.
---
That's the one.  I couldn't remember the name and was on mobile. 
---
Two people downvoted your comment. How sad is that? Have an upvote.
---
Kinda new to this but why do they have such little power in stopping duper’s or reimbursing items? 
---
Stairs I believe.
---
I think most people on this sub are realistic about the state of the game and what it needs to improve on.  Many of us have also had our frustrations with particular bugs/glitches and Bethesda's customer service.  At the same time, there is no denying that the game can be very fun in a lot of ways.  Do I enjoy it?  Yes.  Will I think long and hard before pre-ordering another Bethesda game rather than waiting just a few weeks for a 50% discount?  Oh yes.
---
Do you have a score of 10?
---
I have totally completed this quest with my alt with power armor crafted by my main.  The character who completed the quest never crafted a single piece of power armor.  I'm guessing that something else bugged the quest.  OR whatever bug caused the issue you encountered got corrected?  It was around the holidays/new years that I completed the quest with said alt.
---
B-thez? 
---
Cringe. 
---
Should be under stairs, very bottom.
---
Yeah, very much this. I walked from just the NW to NE corner, and I appreciate the vastness of the game.
---
It's an older engine that was used for single player games and has many limitations regarding the online stuff.
---
Agreed.  I do not think 65% of people have illegal items. 
---
I'd start with running the repair tool from the Bethesda. Net launcher.
---
In your first example in which you buy it why would you return? It seems like you got what you wanted from a vendor and can then go somewhere else. 
---
If your that worried about accidently scraping it (assuming you have any frame) just build an extra chest armour and attach it since there's a PA crafting thing right behind you.
---
If your over encumbered, chances are you were encumbered before entering or you were really close to it. There is the train station which is a short walk from the fast travel location. You just probably "put the horse before the cart" and didn't bother storing items before buying things.
---
Mods weigh anywhere from 1 lb to 4 lb so they arnt too heavy. Assuming you saw a very good legendary weapon or armour would be the only real way youd get encumbered. At this point you would either walk, drop stuff, or sell stuff to get back the caps you spent. 
---
Also like the other commenter said a jetpack mod is rare enough that any one would buy to either give to friends or resale, which i belive to be true. 
---
I'm not saying that this wouldn't be a nice QoL upgrade, and i'd be more then happy. I just rather they focus on other things if your only valid argument for it is "in one rare scenario it'll be really useful so i want it, but all the other times it'll just be nice having it"
---
When you make suggestions you need to give valid examples that would actually make a dev go "huh you know he's right, this would make game play better for all players a majority of the time, let's do it" 
---
All i see here is "hey add this please cuz i want it"
---
Like i said it would be nice and im not gunna oppose this idea, but you need to do more on the side of convincing devs with actual words instead of getting a bunch of upvotes if you want to see any change. I've already upvoted cuz i agree i just think the message could be better.

He is role playing with his words, he just bought the plans from the whitesprings vendor.
---
What About traveling pharmacy perk? It make stimpaks weigth 90% less
---
I dont think they counted on people stacking them tho
---
Oh yeah really stupid of Bethesda to do that
---
I'm on xbox :( 
---
I got video of mine. The missile is actually really tiny. I almost caught the bastard lol. 
---
Plenty of bugs have been fixed in this time, more fixes will come.
---
Sorry if I say this, but that's a ridiculous strawman.
---
I didn't say they made no changes, I said they were minimal and individually justified, and that the fact that you add some ideas doesn't mean that every reddit post with a new idea is a good one.  Most aren't.  And the reason is branding.
---
You can just use a world container. If you make it back to the same server, things you leave in a world container will still be there
---
With those two services I mentioned it's automatic. 
---
 IDK if you know about it or not but if you set it up it can record video for you automatically you just have to push a button and it would save the last 5 minutes of it automatically it's actually pretty handy for WTF moments or anything cool you happen to run across and wish you would have been recording takes all the fuss out of it. All aside it's actually a pretty good feature that I recommend having on. It only stores up to the limit you set, so 5, 10, 30mins etc so it's not a memory sink if you don't want it to be.  
---
That being said dude, the absolute best way you could solve these kinds of issues is by uploading proof of it.  
---
The same dude from video I linked you also has a video of him one shotting the scorched queen using the stacking bobblehead glitch and that IS a problem we all want fixed, and I guarantee it will be. I'll stand beside you on that one for sure.
---
I’ve been wondering that. If two people with a weapon each that suppresses 20% damage and a perk each that suppressors 30% both hit an enemy, does it negate all damage...
---
I dunno, i always assumed different enemy archetypes (organic, robotic, (maybe) scorched, etc) had different resistances as my auto laser (which afaik Commando buffs) shreds super mutants but does fuck all damage to robots of most kind
---
Source or just rumor?
---
&gt; we are telling the devs, it's ok to release a buggy mess as long as...
---
Except it isn't. Guess what, if they choose not to fix it they still have your money on their books.
---
dude look up sentinels gear, hes not hacking. hes wearing gear that makes him take less damage when hes not moving, thats why hes only jumping up and down and not moving around. the way to kill him is to stagger him. hes probably also using "dodgy" to reduge damage until he runs out of AP, a single large hit wont kill him, you need fast fire rate to drain his AP.
---
"Bethesda made me do it".   You still new that junk was duped.  You did.  You know it.  We know it.  Now you get to sweat and the rest of us are laughing at you.
---
And it's bugged out. For some items, it costs more to use repair-all than repairing them individually. Plants are the obvious ones that come to mind (cost 2x as much)
---
Because the engine was never designed to do what they're trying to make it do... so there is still a lot of work they've got to do in order to make it support all of the baseline multiplayer online stuff
---
You will get all BOS plans and some combat armor mods from BOTH vendors in Grafton. Fair warning, you WILL get extremely tired of the mayors voice while server hopping
---
Ye especially the last patch made the game running waaay smoother for me... I'm just sad you know T_T sorry
---
I always drop some junk before droppong important stuff. And the 1 time i accidentally hit the square the bag bugs
---
Needs double magazine capacity.
---
&gt;Cheers for those individuals who raze CAMPs because they admittedly just want to break some shit and don't expect a support network to coddle them outside of the game.
---
NOW QUICK. Let's set up a support network to coddle people who get their stuff destroyed in a PvP game!
---
Yes.  Kind of annoyed they changed something that affected very few people (bobby pin weight - wtf was carrying hundreds of these anyways?) when they could have changed something that affects anyone using a very popular perk. 
---
I'm down for this. I rarely use the supers.
---
That's a pretty big "if" too.
---
Sounds like a plan, where is this option found?
---
This is some bizarre PR. You doing this pro Bono?
---
Sadly no. I opened a ticket 6 days ago. The status "Waiting for an agent" hasnt updated for 6 days by now.
---
Do plasma flamers get treated as actual flamethrowers for perks like Friendly Fire?
---
The - sign is just showing that you have some kind of negative modifier applied to your original value, it doesn't mean you have a negative Int value.  Just like how if you have something buffing your stats it shows a + sign and then the modified value.
---
I've seen some tone deaf requests on this sub but this has to take the cake really. Dear Bethesda, please give us ways to not spend money on microtransactions.
---
I've heard about the duping method that involves you building a "certain structure".
---
Never saw any evidence in game that it works like the old method with the boards, but I've never tried myself either.
---

hes wearing sentinels gear, thats why hes only jumping in place so the effect doesnt drop off

&gt; There was supposed to be ways to opt out of PVP.
---
Gonna need a source on that one because it directly contradicts everything Todd Howard said about PvP pre-launch.
---
Also a gatling laser user. They may pale in comparison butfuck me the light show is worth it.
---
I have a vicious reciver i believe, and i have rank 3 of rifleman, expert rifleman and tank killer and rank 2 of master rifleman. 
---
Oof. Yup that is exactly what's happening to me. Ive taken a few videos of it happening but sharing them anywhere other than xbox is a pain in the ass
---
The PVP events are hidden and lame in regards to rewards except for Monster Mash, but since people farm Monster Mash for XP, you'll usually be called a griefing dick. The most fair way of pvp right now is the Converted Munitions factory. People expect a fight there.
---
Same
---
Level 99 who just learned that plans and recipes weight .25 pounds. It's nice been able to loot again
---
On a side note, I'm pretty sure I accidentally duped my power armor last night.  Going to send the info to Bethesda after I confirm that it actually happened.  
---
(I was really tired/high af)
---
That makes sense, i used the magizine that pierces and increases ammo so more than likely that is what happened, thanks!
---
Also if you want reistic, Charelston, WV is about 5 hours away from Harpers Ferry IRL. Which would be like a hell of a long time spent walking...soooooo....
---
This happened to me a few times on the PS4.  I just had to re-equip them, then hop out, store it, place it, hop back in.  Eventually it fixed itself.  It's like the system had a different PA loadout stored when equiped vs when stored/collected.
---
The pieces still existed, they were just deposited, unequipped, when I entered the Power Armor.
---
Reading saves lives. It clearly states this every time you claim a workshop
---
Its an r/gamingcirclejerk joke but OK 
---
This was in FO4 as well. Just remember not to try and move when exiting.
---
i's what's your gt I'll add you 
---
I completed the game with only 2 game breaking bugs. One was graphics related and was fixed when I changed settings so not really Bethesda's fault.
---
The other we the inability to load a holotape which stemmed from too many holotapes in my inventory. A 2 minute Google search showed me the solution of dumping some tapes and all was good.
---
As both were fixable not really game breaking. 
---
And I had fun for about 90% of the time spent playing it. 
---
Freezing and getting stuck in an endless loading screen on start and while fast travelling have become common.
---
*all the time

Galath11
---
10/10 would buy in the first place.  
---
Yeah i think that is the case, but im talking on the same enemy. I have never been able to 1 shot a stupid robobrain, but always 1 shot scorched. 
---
If you've got an 'anchor' on the server, a character you can use from the main menu to get back to that specific server, then it's guaranteed.  I'm just a little antsy that today the unaware friended account I chose as an anchor happened to log off right during the crucial seconds I was going back to the main menu, so I couldn't get back, heh  
---
It takes more resources to repair plants then to plant new ones anyway
---
It's built specifically FOR visitors. No locks, minimal defense. All workbenches, free water, instruments, a bed. Lights to be seen easily.
---
It gives me nostalgia from when I was getting my birth certificate done
---
I always leave it open.  They can't steal anything, so what do i care?
---
I have my resources unlocked for all to have.
---
Strike breaking was big business back then, with even, union-wide major private law enforcement agencies being involved, among the most famous the Pinkerton Detectice Agency were known to be involved frequently from what I recall (not an American, a europen with an interest in the events of the Colonial era and early US)
---
Was worried I lost my T-60 jet pack. Will give it a try when I get home from work. Made going into a nuke zone a terrible ordeal. 
---
\+1! This was the last thing my camp was needing to be perfect.
---
Yea happens semi often. I have also had non legendary enemies drop legendary items for me, though I think it’s only been in whitesprings.
---
I use one missile turret, with one spotlight, on an elevated position where Mirelurk spawn near my house. It does the job fine, but it's annoying listening to it fire for 2 minutes to kill a small pack of mirelurks. 
---
Turrets need to do more.
---
***please bethesda***
---
For me it depends. I move my CAMP a lot and it depends where I move it to. If I am over a junk pile, I will lock my doors, but if I don't have one, I don't really care. Come in, use my benches, takes some water if you want. Done ruin stuff though. If the doors are locked on someone else's base, I stay out. If they are open, I see everything as fair game.
---
I personally crafted my own and went thru the quest.  So I did not encounter the bug.
---
Maybe it's if you go right to the registration location without first consulting the power armor station / terminal to learn the plans?  I don't know the exact steps to repeat the bug.
---
We're lucky we have you here , so smart.
---
So now the fanboys can begin to witch Hunt people anytime they have a problem with the game. Really though it's perfect. Horrible game for horrible people.
---
Yet, I have never once traded/bought from a player.  So I know for a fact I don't have.   Anyone that does have any TSE, there is a 95% chance its dupped because I have found over 400 legendary items (level 50) and not a single TSE has dropped.  Not one.  Zero. Based on \*my\* experience, the percent chance of having TSE is more like 0.25% for \*my\* personal experience.  But thats taking into account of actually getting one.  So... I assume every single person with TSE is dupped and I will be 99% correct.
---
I found a legendary ripper.. the chainsaws are just their bigger brother, so I don't see a reason why they can't be put in there!
---
This isn't my work some guy here made this, but it's been helping me.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ylPujGxWO3z_C7yrXe_gPV067AIXgGwsvJJKxq7v_AY/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
On my power armor character I've got a full set of Excavator, T-51, T-60, Ultracite, and X01 either stashed or in my inventory.
---
I am absolutely stuffed anytime I want to switch between them because I have to place multiple suits of power armor it's needlessly frustrating. If bethesda doesn't want us to keep multiple sets of power armor then they prohibit us from picking up additional sets. Either that or let us name them or give them serial numbers even.
---
Fixing duping would solve the problem too
---
Or...that’s when the server disconnects. 
---
Imagine if u get banned for that 
---
It´s this one.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agn5ir/will\_there\_be\_an\_inside\_the\_vault\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agn5ir/will_there_be_an_inside_the_vault_today/)
---
Aaaah, fair enough. Sorry for misinterpreting!
---
While that was a good read, it sadly didn’t address Dodgy in particular. Thank you though 
---
you need a lesson on fallout 76 pvp. with full assassins and sentinels gear you can easily reach 90% dmg reduction. from there you add perks like "Dodgy" to take even less damage until your AP runs out and you are literally unkillable unless someone staggers you, and in that case you just stand in a corner.
---
trying to kill someone using Dodgy with a single big hit like a fat man will never ever work because his AP refreshes faster then you reload, you need high rate of fire and staggers to defeat the build he is wearing.
---
Same issue with my excavator armor. When I put it on, the torso was not equipped.  Just had to equip it.
---
#6 The TSE Duper
---
Hides in Watoga high decked out in chameleon armor with his TSE gun that he bought on eBay and sneaks up on the guy who thinks 'pacifist mode' meant that he can enjoy playing the game without someone sneaking up behind him and shooting him with a weapon that kills him with 1 shot.
---
which part can you skip with the lockpick?  The blow up the mainframe cores part? 
---
I agree that it's a bit of a loophole and I don't know if that is the best way to set the rules for workshop encounters, but basically they are not dealing slap damage, which is the OP's point. There is no cheating going on with this. 
---
I know lol couldn't pass up the opportunity for a joke
---
So, I know where this camp is. Just to the west in the next little lake there is an acid resource in the water. It's always funny to see people choose this lake instead. It's free acid!
---
I just changed my character to be Pam and decided I had to move into that house. Looks pretty nice now, can’t wait to get neon letters so I can write ROACHIE on the wall. 
---
This was happening before the Patch, mostly with the Excavator PA, random pieces would un-equip upon entering.
---
Go to your inventory and re-equip them, for me it was mostly the Torso &amp; Right Arm, but the left leg also sometimes.
---
I just switched to using the T60, and it has not had the same issue yet.
---
Ok, you've stated that you want to plead your innocence on Reddit, can you explain what activities you engaged in that may have triggered the ban and why you shouldn't be banned for them?
---
Leave Whitesprings. Go to a different faction this is OLD NEWS
---
I can confirm this is still happening. Having to file a bug ticket should not be required to progress the main quest in an RPG. Especially a bug that's been known about for months.  
---
I was all about defending Fallout 76 from its detractors but it's very hard to defend this. I let the similar bug with the ignition cores go as it wasn't a crucial part of the plot, but this is, and obviously it's impacting a lot of people.
---
This whole thread reads like some kind of shady internet campaign to rehabilitate this games rep. This sub is reaching Star citizen levels of cult like behaviour.
---
same for me...  
---
I've seen locked resource extractors show up as red when I try to lockpick them. I think that might be because I've already "attacked" the workshop though, either by dealing damage to a player structure there or picking another lock.
---
I'd love to be able to share in this find but I freeze every single time I go anywhere close to Charleston and several of the surrounding locations. 
---
GET OFF MY LAWN. SERIOUSLY. I'm a hermit off in the deep woods. 
---
I mean as long as you don’t break anything even if you take some resources or use workbench I don’t see how people would be upset over that
---
City of the future? More like village of the future amirite
---
I'm happy to have visitors. My place is way out in the Savage Divide just spitting distance from Silo Charlie and I hope it's been useful as a staging area for nuke runs. I leave everything unlocked, feel free to make yourself at home.
---
Sledgehammers require +3 endurance too.
---
I've been dumping them in cash registers at vendors because they are now taking up so much stash capacity.
---
I don't think a ban would result from this.  I hope not anyway.
---
It's a nuisance to me, not a benefit.  especially since I don't use power armor.  My son does, and I collect them for him  while I'm online.
---
Yeah, but *double* that. 
---
Common since when, The patch? I've experienced loading stutters before, but this is an outright freeze Upon entering the world either with my controls or loading the pip boy. I was disconnected last night after almost the entire day of smooth play. 
---
Yeah! A Super Stim is still too much HP for me. Feel like it's a waste
---
What I mean is that the method used to stack them isn't something you would likely find in testing, so given the high serverity of the issue it's unlikely that they knew about it and "left it in". 
---
Oh derp. Well that makes a lot more sense. Thanks!
---
Severer doors are purely cosmetic
---
If he was dressed like Santa there's a good chance it was me haha I'm on the plant next top of world and I ditch goods and legendary on the regular when ppl wander through my base😆😆😆 im "butthead" ingame.
---
I'm stupid. 
---
Hi stupid, I'm dad!
---
Yeah we probably couldn’t have figured that out without me!
---
A child's toy that shoots flames out of its ass....would make a great trap!
---
A great trap for what?!?
---
I’m considering launching and standing still for 30 seconds or more to see if that solves the issue.   I’m in the habit of launching and checking the pipboy to see if I need to drink or eat right away however. 
---
MAXIMUM OVERRUSTLE
---
Np, I hope Dodgy would work in PA. Was so sad to find out Serendipity does not work in PA and thus I have to install Emergency Protocol for my bloodied melee build
---
Interestingly I just killed 9 attackers who came at me one by one then the 10th got me :(
---
Junk is useful for more than selling, and ammo cant be sold. You need to fully understand that this is an MMO. Bethesda aim with the game is for people to be longing in every day. The slower they make gameplay, the longer you play per day. They are trying to slow you down.
---
It is? I thought the whole point of melee was to inflict melee damage. Now if it was a shield..... ;)
---
Wdym the method?
---
I have neon and can write it for you if on ps4😅
---
PSA: To get a crosshair with the gatling gun:
---
Hold down the trigger, ADS (Aim down sight), then leave ADS. As long as you don't pull off the trigger, you will have crosshairs. 
---
They're at the very bottom of the stairs tab.
---
My wife and I server hopped for hours to find the X-01 Jetpack. Finally got one, but still searching for those calibrated shocks...
---
Hmm. I'd take those power cores lol
---
You can also press E when the missile is near and put it into your inventiry.
---
This is how actual missile defense works btw.
---
Yeah I’m trying to cement whether it works or not because I have this idea to mix Dodgy and the Kinetic Dynamo torso mod for a cycle of AP Regen/dmg mitigation
---
Food and beds outside , along some defense perimeter some fences here and there , some junk. 
---
Some big ass copper lions 🦁, but the inside is locked , inside is a big warehouse with all work benches some decor to make it feel more like it was part of the games design.
---
And a small room with another bed and next to it another wall( 1x1 space) with another room with a couch a bed a jukebox and some cigarettesmachine lol
---
It happened to me as I was loading, somehow I ejected from my PA and then as I was about to get back in, it stops in 3rd person mode and just sits there. 
---
I felt like one of those living statues in the park. 
---
Since you grew up in a bunker underground and surrounded by people, I find that completely understandable.
---
"nitpicky" is rather hypocritical, considering you're the one saying this specific suggestion should be lower on the priority list than an arbitrary number of other undefined QoL suggestions. 
---
Making a suggestion is valid at all times, they don't have to be implemented immediately and it only hurts the game in the long run to NOT have them written down somewhere or at least just generally known.
---
https://i.imgur.com/aYbSouR.gif
---
Why is it nobody can definitely answer these questions? Shouldn't Bethesda's stance be clear?
---
It’s the second house along. If you look at it, it’s got a gnome to the left near a broken tree. 
---
Took me a bit to find it also!
---
I will have to check into that. Was it under charisma? That is one tree I didnt really incest in. I out 4 points for lone wanderer but that was it. I think it is under INT though and that would be fine cause I put 15 points in to INT but I am also respeccing it down to 10 or less with a different build I am working on.
---
Haha, maybe dense, but I doubt stupid my friend.
---
Just Curious, how does this affect the game YOU play?
---
They don't need more durability, they just need to take less durability damage per shot.  By less I mean like 1/10th or 1/100th of the damage per shot that they do now.  
---
I never duped lol. I'm not even playing the game anymore so I don't care. I just find it funny that you blame people who are trading in good faith instead of blaming bethesda for not fixing their shit for months. 
---
Any Evidence? A lot of people are saying this but the only evidence we have is a photo-shopped email from Bethesda lol
---
Had a similar experience. I was away from my base doing a mission when i get a notification saying my camp is under attack. I ignore it thinking it is something my turrets will take care of. (Ghouls mostly spawn in the area) About 15 minutes later i finish the mission and get ready to go back to my camp when i see there is a guy who is level 37 in my camp with a 150 cap bounty. I fast travel there and when i spawn in I see that he has already destroyed all of my walls, generators, workbenches, water purifiers, etc. he wiped my entire camp down to the foundation. He attacked me as soon as he saw me, I fought back and he killed me. this happened about 6 more times until he left my area. i followed him and noticed two other guys near him. he must have done the same thing to them because we ended up teaming on the guy until he left the game.
---
Sorry should have commented I found it
---
 Thanks you tho!
---
This is not true. I started "Falsely Accused" without wearing the collar and encountered the robots on the street that leads from Wilson Brother's Auto Repair to Grafton.
---
I finally broke down and bought the Marine Wetsuit plan from somebody last week and have now found that plan 3 times since then in that train car. Does make you wonder if they tweaked the drop rate.
---
good robot 
---
well at least you can run a power core/instamash/water store when player vending comes.
---
Did the same thing after I put 2 calibrated shocks on my x01. Would unequip left arm and torso whenever I entered...  spent 5 minutes picking it up placing and entering the chassis, re equipping the pieces everytime. Eventually worked itself out. Never lost the pieces. 
---
I'm having extra pieces of power armor appearing in my inventory too. Same with water, but I can't use them or drop them. Just an identical stack appears.
---
I feel like I'm a healthy mix of 1,2 and 3. If you have a bounty I will kill you and take your junk
---
Yeah, they are idiots.... 
---
Bloody dupers crashing servers, mutter mutter.
---
Do they come with warehouse plan? Because that's the only one I haven't bought 
---
Have they stated on twitter their stance on cheating? I don't understand why it is so hard to find solid information on this sub.
---
Yes! I am working on maxing that skill tonight when I get in from work since I am getting to where I am testing out mutations that are beneficial to my melee build atm.
---
Please tell me you guys are tracking the health regen/damage glitch with the Salvaged Assaultron Head as seen here: https://youtu.be/9-AFywI188A 
---
Only happens on multi charged shots (2+) but happens about 90% of the time for me. Tried it again last night and it happened again. 
---
I sent this to u/lonevaultwanderer before as well and was asked to submit a support ticket which I did. Just want to make sure the team is aware!
---
i don't think we need it, just carry your essentials, its what i do.
---
Lol, so true on the screws. I was trying to do the handmade, lever and gauss at the same time.... painful.... 
---
I've been hoarding screws and ballistic fiber for that.
---
I have soooo many.
---
Why are people downvoting this? This is a useful reminder
---
I'm pretty sure forever. I'd just get a friend to take it and try and get some caps back. And if it's under 100 who cares? 
---
It's questlines like this that make Fallout series so great. I wish there was more of it in this game.
---
Do they come with the warehouse plan? The only one I didnt buy yet 
---
I'm 100% certain I don't have duped items. Because 100% of the items I 100% collected all of those items myself. It's really not that hard to not be a cheater. 
---
Especially when I'm just mining places like Gorge Junkyard I often keep an eye out for low level players and join events to help them out, or drop weapons I don't "really" need to scrap for the components. It feels nice to do. With the winter storm in the Northeast United States this weekend I'll likely be on a lot when not shoveling. 
---
Ditto i get double load screens like crazy now
---
It uses your lowest strength healing-specific item.
---
Salves/stimpaks.
---
🙄🙄
---
No Id want a hard 10 hr quest line and that too be the end reward instead of rng 
---
Well that is entirely up to you.  I am willing to spend 4k on a serum from vendor rather than spend 500 caps from a player because I know it was not duped. &lt;shrug&gt;
---
It let's you reach out and touch things for sure. Need? No....
---
Ahhh see I wasnt big on stimpacks at the start cause I was running ghoulish perk which allowed me to massively heal by drinking toxic water from Poseidon reactor 😂 which I still do now if I find myself in a tough spot and can spare the extra rads. 
---
Seriously I'm only encountering cool people.   Haven't seen a griefer since right after release.   
---
I had my friend give me the set i made on my first account to my new one. 
---
Registered the set without building it and the quest completed and I got the PA station plans. 
---
What you DON'T get is the plans to make the armor unless you visit the terminal that gives you them before scanning your suit. 
---
Colonel, I...uh...we... uh...
---
Captain Joe Dawson, acting General of the 5th Division, US Army.  We are... in dire need of guidance from Central Command.  We have heard nothing from Washington.  I can only assume that General Whitlock, 5th Division, is dead.
---
Your orders sir?
---
Gen. Dawson
---
*PS. Our call sign on XB1 is USArmyGenDawson, our channel is open.
---
Affirmative, I killed 4 Legendary Ghouls as WS Golf club yesterday, and none dropped a legendary item, but the non-legendary Wendigo did.
---
Until someone kills you and collects it.
---
Store all your junk in your storage and then run out to a town and wait for your death.
---
I don’t think that anyone can or does really deny that the game is flawed, but the severity of those flaws differs from person to person and I’m not sure you’ll get the consensus you’re imagining when you say that no one can defend the game.
---
I think it can and should be defended because in my own experience it has value as part of Fallout canon. The world that Bethesda has created, if buggy and broken, is beautiful and interesting and exploring it with others is exciting and new.
---
The biggest divide in the fanbase is not strictly critics versus defenders, but those that critique from negativity who seem to want the game and its players to fail versus those that defend from optimism who want to see it fixed and thrive.
---
I dont mind if people come and visit. I even make some of em a sweet roll if they have a mic.
---
Everything is unlocked except for the room leading to my junk extractor and generator. If they want access to that I will open the door for them but if they dont ask they will be removed by force. 
---
Is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?
---
I had 1 camp with an open workshop area at a very open public spot, visitors welcomed.  New camp is in a secluded spot so its locked and not really designed with visitors in mind.  Had a neighbor check it out the other day though - saw him jet packing off when I returned home.
---
Ah, so it's the armor plans themselves that you skip if you register a gifted set.  Thanks.
---
I thought they were baseline and everyone had them to start, but I do have the warehouse plan so now I'm not sure.
---
Okay, Google, how to write an essay.
---
Yes, and someone mentioned here that he uses the Grenade-Drop-on-Death with Orbital strike to take out the golf camps.   10 caps is all it cost him and let the turrets kill him.   Drops the orbital strike.
---
This is presumably intended gameplay.  You're supposed to discover stuff, not be handed a recipe.  With popular games, over time, all this stuff ends up on sites like wikia anyway.  But some of us prefer the ambiguity.
---
When do you mean register? 
---
Just anchor on your friend. I’ve them your items. Go into your new character. Join your friend and grab your items
---
No it isn't.
---
Yeah, I dunno. I ended up restarting the PS4 entirely and then had a relatively stable game for a while, until the server seemed to die. Hope it settles down today. 
---
I play in pacifist mode because I'm not interested in the (broken) pvp. I just wanna have fun. Was just hanging out in my house by the river when I turned around in my bedroom to see a Level 14 (I was Level 36 at the time) just standing there. Seems I left my door open. They waved, I waved, then they dropped a bag. I inspected it. It contained a few stimpaks and a fisherman's outfit and hat. I thought that was so rad, so I retrieved from my stash a complete fully repaired raider power armor set and went to give it to them since they were so close to level 15 (was holding on to it just to give to someone), but they were already running off. So I chase them down the road a bit til they stop so I could drop it and a couple fusion cores for them. They seemed skeptical so I kept spamming the wave and trade emote til they grabbed it and the bag of cores. They did the heart emote back, I reciprocated and we went our separate ways. A bit later I received that friend request from them. It was awesome to see that kind of behavior in game, so I've taken to helping out new people when possible.
---
I wouldn't be too mad if it was from a quest like that. But a drop would be better so it's rarer, have it be the top, legs, arms and helmet a separate drop, and it should be the top tier non PA armor in the game, would be awesome.
---
What they need to do is hire a bunch of modders to help fix the problems. 
---
It's also one in France isn't it?
---
I'm missing Harper's Ferry &amp; Treehouse Village. Needless to say, I have them as fast travel locations. I first entered the Mire after 3 weeks after launch at lvl 100+.
---
I move from resource deposit to resource deposit depending on what I need. I try and find the ones out of the way but I still won't lock any of it down. I love letting people see what I spend a few hours designing, and if they realize that there's free things to it gives them a reason to stick around for a bit and relax.
---
From a user above, seems it's the excavator armor plans themselves that you can miss by registering a gifted set.  Not the final Power Armor Station plan reward.
---
woah, as a history nerd i thank you for this little piece of knowledge
---
a newt?
---
So true... This one time I was helping a lvl 20 with a quest. He needed 10mm ammo so I thought hell I don't use 10mm so I tried to give him attack 1500 of it :l he got excited when he saw a bag and poof no more 10mm  :c
---
better yet 
---
make one of the map regions covered with **Rad storms** and another with gas fumes and one with steam lava on roads or active volcanoes, witch ever
---
that would be epic.
---
If only borderlands were older than giddy up buttercup.
---
Wait. There is a tower in the bog.
---
I guess thats another locations I'm yet to find.
---
Dang, 8k?
---
Yeah.  This is fundamentally a performance glitch, but it's new in this patch.  I "fixed" it by dropping from 4k down to 1080p fullscreen and tuning down a bunch of the detail sliders, and the issue just went away.
---
And yes, you probably only see it on PC because the consoles graphics settings are pre-tuned already because the hardware is all the same.
---
You don't just click, then click again to use another, like you would with stimpaks. I'm not detailing the method to do so here.
---
I think you get those when you scrap parts looted from bots.
---
Just before I was going to get my picture taken, I was dropped by the server. Upon relog, I had to do the entire quest over.
---
Spent the last 2 days waiting at camp, just waiting for ANYONE to take a look. I was in the double extractor site in toxic valley. Had to show someone what was in the secret room before I moved. Made myself a nice train depot in savage divide now, waiting on vending to start! 
---
Just picked up the cannibal perk card, let the adventures begin! 
---
I believe this is at the snake icon south of whitesprings it's a rather well-known spot so can be annoying as you may have to server hop a few times to place your base
---
I'm more irritated when I kill any kind of legendary creature and the only thing it drops is normal loot. 
---
I wish I had 6.62607015×10^−34 upvotes to give this.
---
I've been getting tons of Fusion Cores in my inventory this week.  I just assumed I was picking them off of dead Mole Miners as I was doing a lot in Top of the World area.  I never paid attention and just looted all.
---
They have the hobo trashcan fires
---
Ohhhh so it was a bug?
---
I wish I got more traffic.   To be faiiiiiir, I am in a spot just for the lead and it's not exactly in the way.   I could move somewhere closer to where people commonly are, but I like the central location and need the lead.   
---
I don't mind visitors.  So far my favorite part of the game are people's camps and outfits.   I keep my lead locked and that's all I need to do.   Everyone has been cool so far.   My door is always open.   
---
not 2x exp but increased drop rates for stuff yhea sure :) can make  whole new events around it
---
If it ain't locked down, I'm entering/looting it...
---
Likewise at my CAMP.  A few water purifiers are locked, but the majority aren't.  I have my bedroom/2nd floor deck locked but anything else you'd need is available (crafting/STASH/water/food/bed)
---
That one is known and being investigated. It will also be on the list. Thank you!
---
Yes, since the Patch, prior to that this was something that happened on rare occasions, maybe twice a week, but now it's many times each session.
---
Ah, well I actually completed the entire quest up to the last part, including getting the set plans and all.  
---
Very true, and the XP you get from her really isn't worth the trouble either. 
---
Being rarer is nice and all but either one boils down 2 time. I think 10 hrs is a reasonable time span for a reward like that, where as your suggesting about 100 hrs worth play through or more becsuse if there armour drops that also means legendary specs so then you look for super rare low drops from 3* enemies. Hell people would be looking forever for a full sent/unyeilding set 
---
Glad you got some enjoyment from a friendly experience! My days on Fallout 76 are spent providing experiences like this to new players all the time. Here’s what I do:
---
I’ll get on and check the map right away. I look for low level players hanging around the early parts of the game. If I see they’re pretty stationary, I’ll fast travel to them cause they’re probably testing out base building. I’ll wave and send a team invite. If they accept, I make them the leader right away in case they want to go on a quest. If not, I’ll help them build and use any plans that I see they don’t yet. Sometimes I’ll drop them plans or water or stimpacks, or specific materials they ask for. 
---
When we’re done hanging around their base, I signal for them to follow me and fast travel to my base. It’s a very decked out house, garage, and viewing platform overlooking the crashed space station. They usually try out all the instruments on the platform, grab some free water, etc. I then have them follow me to the crashed space station and get them the two space suits and helmets behind the inaccessible door (password is 111418). Then I wave goodbye and leave the team, then the world. Rinse and repeat. 
---
I like to think this provides a good first impression to new players and gives them some plans and a cool outfit to remember it all by. 
---
More of an exploit, but yeah. It's something they *have* to fix soon, but I totally understand how it wasn't found during QA.
---
I actually found it a couple days ago and marked it on my map! Haven't decided on whether to move in there or not though 
---
Are you on PS4? I'll buy screws now screw the eventual update. 
---
Pin intended 
---
Yeah I'm fairly certain this is the case since I can't build the set. 
---
That was just me rushing through it and not caring about being able to build excavator since I had a lvl. 50 set already. Wanted to save those precious screws and springs for later power armor needs. 
---
And boy did it help. currently sitting on 300 of each. 
---
That excavator set build really drains your supply if you do it at level 25. 
---
Find someone who is just about to be level 40 and drop it for them with a chef hat. It may not be good for you but it’ll actually be great for someone
---
I'm working on that as well...crimson flux...story of my FO76 life...
---
So I'm not the only one to kill a legendary creature and it not even have loot on it.
---
It’s not just ghouls that do this. I did the AWOL event the other night and the last robot to show up is always a 3* gutsy. After initial damage, then letting him heal, I killed it. Knowing legendary robots explode shortly after death I quickly ran up to inspect the corpse...no legendary drop. I backed away to get out of blast range only to stand on a normal robot corpse that decided it was going to explode instead. After respawning and hunting down the now relocated corpse I found a trash 1* on it that was not on it previously. 
---
Do not worry fellow gamer i am not a bethesda employee please share these exploits my mountain dew drinking companion
---
Modders are 'fixing' a lot of things that should have been in the game from the start. A healthy modding community makes for a healthy game. Look at the Civilization franchise and how they approach modding. Good stuff and definitely a big part of Fallout.
---
I duped some corn in my stored tab!  Unintentionally and was irritated to have too click 100 times to get rid of it all.
---
No, PC.
---
Servers would seem full as long as there's 24 players. 
---
I had a huge friends list since launch. There's maybe 2 people online in a day. We've consolidated many discord channels into a core 5 people. 
---
I sell most of my chems
---
There’s a fallout76 wiki but it’s not complete
---
Yes! Wrote more about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agr2b9/so\_this\_patch\_is\_anybody\_else\_freezing\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agr2b9/so_this_patch_is_anybody_else_freezing_after/)
---
They need to fix this!!!!
---
Same :(
---
All are welcome tents with sleeping bags set up. Full workbenches and farm to access and a band put around a cmapfire
---
I strangely get lots of Chinese Officer Swords.... obviously its trying to hint my allegiance is wrong. ;)
---
A lot of times people just want to see what your camp looks like or maybe scrap some junk and move on. I never lock my doors anymore. 
---
You’re the best! Thank you for the response. I really appreciate all the hard work by the dev team and community managers to stay up to date on issues
---
I have lots of extra plans and recipes from repeat visits to areas. Instead of dumping them when I need to create inv space, I do a quick map check and look at what levels are around 76, flatwoods. 
---
If there’s someone fresh I’ll shoot em a message. Drop some stims, chems, couple basic plans, maybe a serrated or sacrificial machete at level 5 or 10 (which ever their closer to) little food and water then wave and run away. 
---
There are trolls and griefers but I find way more people willing to help or give gifts then there are nasty bastards. 
---
Agreed... I don't think anything can rehabilitate this game at this point
---
To show your dad how hard you are.   
---
They might be holding the STASH box locations/numbers as is because it stimulates a reliance on the CAMP system. Just a thought.
---
The Dragon breaks really fast. 
---
&gt; Right now Fallout 76 is hemorrhaging players. I feel perhaps it would be in your best interest to pause development on other projects 
---
Is this a joke?  Don't work on that other stuff that might make you money, please throw cash into the giant hole over here.
---
That is, needless to say, not the way business works in the entertainment industry.  Games, like films, are a hit economy.  Some pay off, many/most flop.  We're playing a flop.  You can't rescue bad games, you just put them behind you.
---
If you are not engaged in PvP, the game has protection in place to prevent random people killing you out of nowhere. No matter how powerful their attack is, the game only lets it deal a tiny sliver of damage (I've heard people say 5 hp) per hit. It's called slap damage because it's more like a slap fight than a shootout until you in some way engage back in PvP, either by getting a bounty, claiming/contesting workshops, or attacking another player
---
That's been happening for a while. Guess that's still not fixed. I have a pretty large adhesive farm and I want to build a new camp but don't want to have to delete the 200-400 duplicate crops that will be stored 
---
I usually keep an eye on them, 90% of the time it's just someone looking for shelter/workbench/stash so I dont mind. However I have had someone steal water before from my locked purifiers and proceed to destroy my turrets and other pieces of my base in self defense. So because of that I am very wary of people near or in my base, I'm always ready nearby to take someone out if they try and steal mah stuff
---
Dont care that mich about the caps. Caps aren't hard to come by... but good armor/weapons definitely are! :/
---
We're getting REALLY hard
---
Just as a heads up for anyone who sees this, don't expect this bug to be fixed, it's been an issue since FO4. So I'd recommend looking for a way to cancel it, pretty sure there's a way but I don't remember it. 
---
They objectively are. 
---
Doors are in the game. Secret doors would probably be a different look for either regular or powered doors.
---
As of the last patch, you’re giving them a bounty by doing that. The drop is tied to you with a lock that if someone else picks, they’re wanted. I hope that’s a bug because I loved helping people and meeting them like that. 
---
Or just make a banker mule...
---
I really don't want to think where it hid that. ;)
---
This turns everything into a piece of cake!
---
Servers are instanced.  They always seem full because they always are.  What you need to count is the number of instances running, which isn't really feasible.
---
This x 1000.
---
They are the worst designed mob in any game I have ever played.
---
"I'm so glad that I gave FO76 a fair try.
---
It's strange how infectious this game is.
---
I find myself thinking about FO76 constantly, always looking forward to my next opportunity to jump back into the game and explore the wastes. The game itself is this deeply tranquil, insulated, and immersive experience that I don't think I can find anywhere else - thank goodness that I didn't allow a barrage of negative press keep me from this game.
---
I've experienced bugs - as I'm sure you all have - and the game has a lot of room to grow yet, but I'm excited to be a part of the process.."
---
Holy fuck, are you the point man in the circle jerk? 
---
Lul this thread
---
Comment removed by moderator&lt;--- Was a pretty awful comment. But since it was removed I can't "prove it"
---
"Maybe they should stop selling Beta period. When you sell a game in Beta to players, most of these players don't do what beta is intended for. Did you play beta? Did you report all the bugs you found? Is any of this your fault? No, it's the gaming community in general for buying into paying for Beta"
---
"The problem is the game is still in beta but they tried to say it was a full release. So no, the problem isn't with the community, the problem is Bethesda. Or are you such a blind fanboy you can't fucking see it?"
---
HUGE FUCKING DIFFERENCE YOU PLEB. i bet you deny the holocaust happened too. fucking wank.
---
There's a couple replies to a couple of threads for ya.
---
I know that. Even posted a thread about it a while back.
---
I have a camp on the hill overlooking that exact same pond, but your camp is so well done compared to what I've got thrown up.  I'm tempted to scrap the whole thing and start over so I can get those nicer looking layouts.  I've got to start hunting for those wall plans.  
---
At least i tried
---
Posts like this make me feel like I'm doing something wrong in this game. I will invariably end up with dozens of dozens of food and drink items bloating my inventory. Same problem I always have in fallout. I have more heals than I can possibly use, and I can't resist the urge to pick crap up. See also: ammo
---
40mm grenades, especially due to them being a common event reward.
---
Im sure u shouldn't worry as long as u never have been in this room in person
---
GET ME THAT DAMN WATER PURIFIER CODE!
---
*PS my GT is Nomad C7E add me if you don't mind
---
I'm going to take another look, because I can't find them .. otherwise I'll buy the warehouse plan to check
---
I keep mine open for all with all crafting stations, 3 instruments, 3  beds, 4 each of tato, corn and mutfruif, as well as 2 unlocked water purifiers. I have the cardboard people pointing to the resources so people know they are free to take. I've never had anyone break anything and 95% of the time my resources are replentished when I get back. I see players stop by allot.
---
The only thing that I’m scared of is being blinded by epilepsy rays and walking into one of those fissures you can’t retrieve your junk from after killing the Queen and losing your flux. 
---
It’s happened once. 
---
There isn’t any difficult content after a certain point. Endgame is making your camp pretty. 
---
Great use of the Flamingos!
---
I have 2, and I'm sick of switching over. Takes forever to do on xbox
---
Bethesda missed a trick this week being toy themed, I would have paid 500 atoms for a clean repaired giddyup buttercup, and I’d give them a 1000 of those precious atoms if they’ll give me clean white on the inside brick walls
---
Till someone puts a bullet in your skull.
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave. 
---
OP is a fucking Ghoul kill him.
---
Children, obviously.
---
This game doesn't have an RPG bone in it's body. Who are you kidding? 
---
Lol JFC you were right.. I didnt see it before tho. Thanks
---
All the burnt books ? Lol
---
Supposedly that's what the other vaults are going to end up being, raids. Hopefully including bosses for said raids. 
---
Better idea! Lower all the prices in the atom store
---
Do you have turrets? They eat up a ton of your budget I think about 10%.
---
Once I got rid of mine I was able to build an actual base with multiple structures 
---
i still take damage with point blank TSE shots, not instakill anymore but still taking big chunks of health.
---
using dense mod BoS Stand Fast chest armor w/ maxed Fireproof
---
Seems like the general consensus is don’t be a dick, and everything will be fine. Now I won’t be so timid to creep on a camp when I come across one. 
---
Yeah i was thinking about it, not my smartest move 
---
I'd cautiously include that as a sub-category of #4 :)
---
Not in the big, in the Savage Divide. Just north of Johnson's Acre and south of the Monorail Elevator. 
---
Go stand in the corner.
---
Warrior then? :)
---
Lol no worries, I also had someone in this sub point it out to me.
---
Anyone who has ever studied the engine in any detail could tell you that was a made-up excuse. 
---
That's Category #5: Clint Eastwood xD
---
Id love just a separate pool for weapons and Armour. That would save a chunk of space. Just make it something we have to craft, rather than gift to us. 
---
Oh come on not again...
---
I do have electrically charged. I don't remember it proccing but maybe he hit me before he shot me. I can't guarantee that didn't happen.
---
I was about to say that
---
PC 
---
Power armor light is too bright now. It went from flip phone illumination to eye shielding bright when you get close to objects. This makes it difficult to tell what I'm looting in dark rooms.
---
Thanks I'm currently sitting in my car while my wife has a job interview perfect way to kill time
---
I love the online community aspect that's propagated by decent players in this game. However, the longer it's been out, the more griefers I run into. After having my CAMP used and blown up multiple times, I've taken to just quitting the server if the Dbags outlevel me, or going on a neverending revenge spree, if I can take them.
---
You got links?
---
The cardboard cutouts always make me nervous because I just keep thinking IT’S A TRAP! Hahaha
---
Agree this is true 
---
Almost the same thing 
---
I agree that there should have been some sort of explanation in the very least. I thought they might throw out some Atoms too but no luck so far. Bethesda has pretty much just whistled past the graveyard and acted like there is/was no problem. It’s still pretty stunning how poorly they have handled the controversies with this game. I used to gripe about Bungie but Bethesda makes them look like saints. Bethesda has displayed neither shame nor humility. 
---
NOW!
---
you have even more than that!
---
if you enter your power armor, it wont trigger electrically charged, but weirdly unstable isotope still works, but it doesnt trigger pvp
---
K add me plz
---
You are completely missing the point. There is a difference between a few bugs and exploits and a game being borderline unplayable or immersion breaking because of these (which f76 is)
---
No, seriously. How much do you think you play?
---
Sure give me a bit. Currently at work so my reply will come next break.
---
It's not bugged. It takes up 8lb. Without the reduction, it would weigh 80lb.
---
Cool.
---
&gt;  I'm just wondering if there is a way to stop them shooting.
---
Sniper rifle
---
I built my base on the hill above the Rusty Pick. Every time I logon there are a bunch of Supermutants or Protectrons there. A few times both were there and I watched them fight.
---
I look at it like free xp because repairing my shack doesn't cost much.
---
This. The Gauss rifle should be a super fun end game type weapon that can be modded into something special not the dinky thing it is right now.
---
Buying an item from another player for caps doesn't make you a cheater
---
I left one of those plans at Lewisburg Station in the cash register last night along with a dozen other plans.  Got it from a workshop event.
---
I was repairing a gun for some kid and his gun disappeared because of this.  I must have told him like eight times not to pick up the bag until I tell him to because this exact thing would happen - over and over he repeated that he understood.  Put the bag down with one bullet in it - go to put the gun in and boom gone.  Of course I made him a new one but ARGHBVOGBUOIEUR...smh
---
That joke didn't even register with me until just now. That's fucked. Sorry to hear it.
---
It’s probably the mods you added to it which aren’t affected by the weight reduction. This is either a bug or a very awkward and weird mechanic that needs removing.
---
That said, it just being “you missing something” doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t stupid. ;)

I'm by New Gad and have that all the time haha
---
Odd occasion i have got a bounty i just strip naked, and stand there till somebody kills me in an area with high activity! I think most players realize that's why am there.......................unless they think am some kind of post apocalyptic pervert?
---
Please and thank you
---
Two days ago a group of players and meself got the scorched queen 3 stars level 95 , somebody along the group one shotted after a few of us had given some minimal damage (5%) and i got nothing of the queen even tough she was there for a few minutes attacking and taking damage before being one shotted 
---
Kuddos, and I'm with you on that...  If I see a camp behind the golf club with turrets, I smash it.  90% of the time they log out.
---
I just don't get it... why would anyone even need to do it?  I walk into the golf club, nuked or not, with an endurance of 4, in the FREE x-01 power armor, and just tank out the whole place.  1 point of agility reserved for the auto stim perk.  And I don't even use a TSE, just a lever rifle, one shotting ghoul after ghoul.  2 shotting glowy ghouls.  All my loot is in on spot, easy to harvest.  It's not a complicated or difficult thing to do solo.  However, if others are there, I do drag them all into the parking lot to share.
---
IGN has an interactive map with a lot of options to mess around with.  
---
[https://www.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia](https://www.ign.com/maps/fallout-76/appalachia)
---
YES. Even if it'd be a single save slot (preferably per character, at least), that would be a huge help. Because yeah, just like you, while I love having the option to be able to change everything at any time, I'm always terrified to actually do so, because I always worry I'll screw everything up and not be able to get it back the way I liked it.
---
It's true though, as much as I love Fallout 76 the prices are absurd
---
Wow! Just checked, its the heavy rocket mod which is exclusively available only for the all rise... without it it would weight around 20 instead of 80
---
In 80ish hours I think I've seen them half a dozen times. They seem to spawn at the big monorail station near Freak Show.
---
Yeah, different storage for different things would be cool. Like let me store and display my power armor collection on stands.
---
Put my excess chems in a medicine cabinet.
---
My Cram collection in the fridge.
---
Outfits in a dresser.
---
Guns in a case.
---
Something for my holotapes.
---
A digital frame populated from the pictures I take in the wasteland.
---
etc etc...
---
So many things that this game can do to enhance base building and gratuitous wealth display.
---
When I was by the power plant on the east side of the map, I'd get quite a few visitors using my workstations, which was nice. Not as many opportunities to scrap and repair out there, so it was probably like a welcome oasis. 
---
However, because of gulpers and super mutants and other high level randoms that would spawn, I moved to the east side of the map, near Flatwoods. Now, I don't really have to worry about random enemies and can craft and repair in peace, but amusingly, three other players have gotten bounties for wrecking my shit. (I'm assuming that they just see my turrets at a distance and fire at them, ignoring the fact that they're not red / hostile.) I still haven't gotten the trophy for 20 player kills, so, I'm not exactly sad about this development either... 
---
I love how people are downvoting this amazing joke, sorry about your luck 
---
You use an iphone. It's called karma.
---
I leave everything in my base open, I don't get why ppl lock it, so someone takes water, who cares they make the shit that fast that you just end up selling it. Tonight when I logged in my base couldn't be loaded cos there was some else's there, I went to take a look and everything was locked, so I dropped a nuke on it, locking everything up is why ppl will trash it.
---
To bad it's not tse 
---
Dada da .. Quest started : Threat Level Midnight ..
---
No, that’s not it. The weight reduction doesn’t apply to the mod. So the heavy rocket mod is adding weight to it. Without that mod it’s like 2lbs
---
Good for you
---
Go through the secret entrance to the resort from the bunker.  You dont have to travel nearly as far, and you can hit the stash box inside there
---
It blew my mind when I found that door!
---
Definitely need an option to lock items in your inventory so you don't accidentally sell/drop/trade them.
---
The mod it comes with....remove and its massively improved.
---
That's a lot of very good idea, I hope they will add this in a near update !
---
I can't get thru a core with mine it's the worst they need to fix it 
---
im still pretty suprised they replied lol
---
 By design it would work but by greed it doesn’t , maybe they’re stackable because they’re probably meant to be included in loot boxes 
---
The Halloween witch costume is available normally, if someone found the stupidly rare random scene of a dead person with it on with the plans on the dead body

I actually have been running a sneak / combat knife build so I’m using a lot of these perks already. I’m definitely going to give your suggestion a go!

Oh I did walk away

I would say 2-3 save slots, but I suppose 1 would be enough. Glad to see I'm not the only one.

Problem is that its the best mod the

I keep my camp locked because animals and ghouls can get in and destroy shit.  So outside my stairs I put an extra Stash box, campfire and water purifier.  I keep a separate purifier within my walls as well.  Whenever I'm wandering the wasteland I find that those three things are the most essential.  I probably should add a bench of some kind so people can scrap stuff too.
---
My first 3 star legendary drop was a lead pipe which wasn't super useful for either my sniper nor pistols build. 
---
I just wish we had an option to scrap legendaries we don't need. It's a bit crap my option was to sell it to a vendor for 12 caps...

Nothing to see here.

My bad - I was not aware you could switch with shift 1-8.  I had looked at it but thought you still had to go to the perk menu to change decks...thanks for the correction this sounds like a decent band-aid at least for now!  
---
&gt; As I understand it, on consoles you get use 'join' from the recent players tab, whether the account is friended or not, as well as the friends tab, whereas on PC, you can only use 'join' from the friends tab.
---
PS4 player here.  We are same as you on PC.  Apparently on XB1 they can join from the 'recent' tab so it's much less risky to use an open world container.  
---
I have found a few people on my friends list that seemingly don't server-hop, so I have been moving stuff that way, but it's definitely not safe and I get nervous when I move anything more than junk/aids/ammo.
---
Yeah, I got the Civil War Era suit off a drop. 
---
Dupers make up maybe 10% of the player base. Not 65%.
---
Good point but it still does great damage
---
I get about 40-50 and then drop them in front of Vault 76, let the newbs have em, not worth shit at lvl 100+
---
It’s endurance, each costs one point. It’s cheap, it’s a nice quality of life set I like to run with.
---
Ah thanks a lot! I assume its like that for every weightless weapon/armor? 
---
I suggest dropping your 'test' item, then stepping onto the bag. Almost impossible to take a paper bag through join team and trade prompts. 
---
Some of the high 100s and higher level characters exploited now-patched bugs to skyrocket their XP.
---
Though I'd say level 160 and lower is 98% likely to be legit
---
I didn't know this was a thing till i accidentally did it.  the guy on the other end goes "aw jesus man you didn't have to eat me."  good times

It's crazy how downvoted these two comments are. 
---
Nah, just regulars into diluted.
---
Yep, even weight reduction perks only apply to base weight not mods
---
Appreciate all the comments. Was fearful for my beloved bother hood of steel t60. Had to pay an arm and a leg for her attachments,was worried I lost them to the abyss
---
I want Professor Farnworth’s nuclear powered teeth.
---
I'd say you'd be surprised how flexible people are to new types of currency. I don't take caps or trades anymore, so I basically started taking canned dog food. I think it'll flow as long as you get enough customers. Good luck.
---
&gt; Why in the world is there marine combat armor in a land locked mountainous state that has no large bodies of water?
---
Someone better tell the Marines in Afghanistan that they shouldn't be there.
---
Seriously, plans can exist all over the place because the Fallout universe had a hyper military industrial complex. 
---
It does but it shoots too slow for my taste. Also seems like it has bad range.
---
This is literally a made-up issue. A guy posted a video of his fucking 200k damage explosive shotgun after stacking bobbleheads that one-shots a scorchbeast queen and it doesn't do any more slap damage than normal. 
---

Fuck off with that misinformation I have weapn artistan 3 and pick of the draw 3, my Gatling plasma can get thru half a core andy Gatling laser can get thru 1.15 cores if both start at 200% durability.  
---
It's not fucking addressed it's fucking broken 
---
Ya.  My two teammates and I spent this last week doing it.  Screws were the bottle neck for all of us.  Takes 60(?) I think to make the whole level 25 set.
---
We all knew a good screw farming run spot with lots of fans, fuel tanks, type writers, hot plates, and misc loose screws.  Only took a few hours of playing to finish them.
---
I bet you can make some *killer* bread.
---
...that would also mean no one can sell or trade anything to anyone, ever?
---
Did you think that one through...?
---
And let's call it deluting 
---
If you dont like it move the fuck on 
---
That sucks. Switch to melee or lvl up another gunsmith
---
But... you're not being *handed* the recipe. This would just let you know it *exists*.
---
Example: I'd stopped picking up Leather armor for a while because I'd assumed I had all the mods for it - and then I saw a friend get the Stabilized mod, and I realized how ridiculously nice that'd be to have for a sniper character, and I didn't have it yet. I ended up crafting and scrapping probably the better part of a hundred or so leather arms to finally get everything. Or, I *think* it's everything. Either way, I probably never would've gotten it if I hadn't seen it on my friend's game, because I didn't even realize it existed - a change like this would help a lot for situations like this one.
---
Whitesprings is a nice place but I farmed high lvl deathclaws.
---
The biomes each have a different base level that can be adjusted upwards by having high level characters pass through. 
---
At level 15 focus on gearing up and acquiring weapons and chems that will help you.
---
I would actually consider using this. Get it upgraded, break 100, no weight, beat things savagely quickly.... I don't hate it, the RP aspect would be fun! lol
---
......someone didn't read the post lmfao
---
Workshops now give 8 fully charged cores per hour
---
Do you have anything in blueprints?
---
If you are trying to farm flux, it is reasonable to get 60+ in one run.  Those things run 1lb a piece.  You may not want to use it immediately but you don't want to go through the hassle of making it on demand and you don't want 10% of your stash just gone holding onto the things.  Hence, make a mule to hold onto it until needed.
---
I know a couple players who are around 190 who play all day because they don't work. Up to around 225 I think CAN be legit, but over 250-300 probably isn't. Just grind whitesprings, events, missions etc.
---
Lol are you on Xbox if so I'll be on today if you wanna see
---
I'd love the Vaults to have their own end of dungeon boss. Perhaps we could fight a super mutant Overseer, or a couple of Vault dwellers who have become legendary glowing ghouls because of an error with the doors. 
---
Scorchbeasts are still fun to fight, but if that's all I'm going to be doing from now until Fallout 5 comes out, I'm going to be a little burnt out.
---
This is well reasoned. Thank you for taking the time.
---
Gotta take the secret entrance to white springs and use theirs.... cause that makes sense right? Lol totally agree we need a stash box in the bunker. 
---
Do you know if that Scorchbeast will attack the lead node? I want to try to build there, but I don't want to have everything green-misted through walls and have to repair all the time. I can easily kill a SB, but I'd rather not have to worry about it whenever I fast travel or load in. 
---
Me and friends raze camps to entice people into pvp for that juicy reward, or to defend their camp. It has nothing to do with destroying a camp because it's fun, because honestly its kindof boring. Also where do you get this info that wanted players have less damage resistance? I've never heard of that at all
---
No mods for xbox yet. 😢
---
Weightless armor though with an ultralight mod can make some armor weigh 0 though I believe.
---
A 3star legendary dropped me a drill yesterday at whitespring
---
Blueprints maybe?
---
I assumed you can't flag though during group events. Because if that was the case, at the end of the sbq everyone would attack everyone. Especially me since I use an explosive weapon and then switch to melee when she gets crippled. If you could flag during that I would be pvping after every sbq encounter lol
---
Doubtful. That way someone could get a bunch of cool stuff from the dev room and dump it to a mule to keep all the stuff.
---
I should make a video of my camp to claim some original ideas I’ve had, but I am lazy and don’t do it, soooo my favourite thing to do is show ppl my camp lulz 
---
I've been playing since beta and I'm only level 118 on my main character, so I'd have to agree with that. I actually saw a player that was over level 800 with the appropriate username of GlitchManGaming or something like that.
---
Bethesda needs to make the Prime Fissure nuke return better gains overall, not just the queen.
---
Makes no sense that you get 10x more from playing whack-a-ghoul from Whitespring nukes instead of the endgame content.
---
Events needs legendary loot tweaks/buffs too.  As it stands, there's no reason to do anything besides farming Whitespring or hopping a couple of locations where legendary foes will spawn.
---
I’ve had an issue twice where I load in and have no controls except I can hit start to bring up the map and scroll it around.  But outside of that no aiming moving pip boy etc.  Fast travel didn’t fix, had to leave the world and rejoin
---
That would canonize New Vegas a bit too much.  Conceptually BGS has shyed away from explicitly referencing anything related to that game.  I was thinking the same thing the other day, for some reason, when I was doing that teahouse event. But the conclusion I came to is sadly that.  
---
You never fought a skeever in Morrowind :p Those hit boxes were something else.
---
Maybe pick up your camp and set it back down? that might restart your budget.
---
Oh I will be junior, right about March 15 when TD2 releases. 
---
Ugh. This happened to me twice over christmas. My wife and I wanted to do something nice for the new players, so we upgraded a bunch of low level weapons, and were handing them out.
---
Happened twice in a row. 
---
I would buy this 
---
A little bit harder to load sometimes, but way less crashes. Like 10 times less.
---
I have two of them one is explosive instigating twoshot.... The other one is a five star with explosive two shot instigating incideary and 25 percent reload speed
---
Where is this secret door people mention
---
Yup, got 3 ultralight weightless marine pieces. They are truly weightless now😂
---
No I did not
---
90 percent my bad 
---
Thanks for the tip! 
---
You need to hit up higher level areas with better enemies, try funding large clusters of super mutants. Also a handful of folk abused some old xp exploits. Take it from some one who is lvl 122 and has more then 350 hours on just that's save patience is key. 
---
Just a last little thought but you can get an extra xp boost from a few events on the map like the one at mama dolches or the landview light house and even the palace of the winding path. And dot forget to get your well rested bonus and the card for bonus xp on a team.
---
I had this happen before. Try restarting your game that occasionally fixes it. If not, move your camp to a different location. Other than that, you should contact Bethesda.
---
You sound as bad as me 
---
Maybe you could get the normal armor with no effects or just like 10% more accuracy something like that, and from drops the ones with the other legendary rng effects, anywhere from 1-3 stars but have it be really rare. I like when an item is really rare in a game, it's something to strive forward to getting.
---
Nice 😁
---
I've done that about 20 times, but thanks.
---
doubtful is that they will punish people for trading
---
I think this describes me. I just don't care. Shoot me, it's fine. I'll zone if it becomes a nuisance. I like my junk better than your junk, anyway.
---
Nope none stored or ever made.
---
Don't care at all if I happen by someone's camp that needs repair I repair it too
---
I fixed a bug like that for myself by picking up the C.A.M.P. and moving it, reloging and 
---
Then checking my stored tab, it showed I had 4 missile turrets stored. Might not fix, but that's what I was able to do. Good luck
---
Yeah i carry all super stimpacks from queens we kill 50-100 super stimpacks. Without this powerfull perk i wouldnt have chance to be santa for people i kill (yeah im raider, i kill lowbies that have bounties). Farmaci FTW!!
---
I don't know, I'm still one shoting them just fine if I'm still hidden and aim for the head. It'd be worth testing to see if something has changed. 
---
To be fair though, that's always kind of been a trait of Fallout games. Partly because I doubt they can account for the effectiveness of all builds before releasing a game out into the wild, but also because I think they're just trying to provide variety, in terms of effectiveness and entertainment. Like I got a chuckle when I saw the wood-related perk in Luck and thought, "Man, I hope nobody actually picks that one." (And six months from now, someone will post about their build that uses that wood perk to get infinite caps...) 
---
Was this in the Top of the World mezzanine level?  If so, it might have been me.
---
I was there last night and came across a level 15 or 16 who looked bunkered down (or possibly pinned) by a pack of scorched, and I felt bad because they were all leveled to fight *me* (which put them at about twice his level), so I cleared a few out to give him some space and dropped all my duplicate plans and recipes.
---
If that was you, I’m sorry I didn’t respond to your team invite.  I didn’t see it until I got the notice that I declined it, and when I turned around to reinvite, you were gone.
---
******
---
As a general principle, I keep all my duplicate plans on my person for when I come across low-level characters.  I figure if I can’t sell them, they are literally the least I can do to help out someone newer to the game than me.
---
I'm level 38, and I'm always wary of higher level players showing up. Thankfully they've all been friendly and curious, giving me a wave before heading back on their way. 
---
&gt;You are all acting like you are just trying to pass on things to your other characters, but in truth, you just want to bypass the stash limit.
---
Oh really?
---
Can I ask where you got such intimate and practical knowledge of my personal motivations?
---
I don't know that I've ever read such a self-absorbed crock of shit on this site. Get your head out of your ass dude.
---
I have a PA heavy gunner, a stealth sniper, a hand to hand character, a shotgunner, and an explosive specialist.
---
My PA heavy gunner doesn't need the bloodied power fist I looted yesterday, but my hand to hand character does.
---
Shit with 5 characters, more stash space isn't even an option.
---
That didn’t stop a scorched from spawning inside between my workbench and a wall. I was running outside trying to find him. He couldn’t move, so I put him out of his misery. 
---
I leave my purifiers unlocked, especially since I’m usually closer to where lower levels may swing by. My adhesive farm is open to folks. I do lock my front door, since I like to be out of my PA and sleep in peace to the white noise of the generators and turrets. 
---
Yep, this is exactly the same thing if I manage to bring down the all black screen pip boy
---
What "duper supporters" don't understand, is that Bethesda does have big plans for this game. With duped BIS weapons circulating through the game, the ability for future content is meaningless. Whats the point of coming out with any DLC, if every future update can be one-shotted through by thousands of people, therefore making and long-term lifeline of this game shrivel up and die. 
---
Not to mention the server instability, 100x more $$ and man/woman hours needed to chase down these extra dupers/exploits (essentially slowing down progress of the bug fixes and new content), the trading economy (in future updates), and many other things. By banning people now (even if it is a very large number), Bethesda will attract many more users in the long-term... Especially when the game keeps getting improvements. 
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vkwc2/fallout76_zone_map_with_level_ranges/
---
I spent a lot of time in Toxic Valley and Grafton area at lvl 15 
---
It'd also be nice if when modifying an item if you get the list of stuff you can put on the item, that it'd identify which items are available because you have a mod item to attach.  For instance, if you had a Submachine Gun and you were trying to modify the barrel attachments and had in your inventory the Suppressor mod, you'd get a list like:
---
Compensator  
---
Much Bigger Compensator  
---
Suppressor (From Mod)
---
So you could immediately see that the Suppressor is from your inventory and not going to be using materials.  They could even further display it like below if you know the plan and have an item in your inventory, so you can decide which to use.
---
Compensator (Crafted)  
---
Much Bigger Compensator (Crafted)  
---
Suppressor (Crafted)  
---
Have you tried placing a few objects then scraping them? Might work?
---
I've deleted everything in my stored (all 11%) several times.  Logged out, left it that way for 24 hours.  Moved it, moved it again.  Nothing.
---
Thanks though.
---
I agree man completely but its like tse weps before duping started. No1 had heard of the buggers because they were so rare 
---
o7 
---
Colonel, it's a pleasure you've joined us. We could use your assistance. Whitespring keeps being nuked constantly. 
---
# YES
---
And robobrains no longer drop fusion cores like they used to, Bethesda fixed their loot table bug
---
You really paint with a wide brush there, cuntface.
---
I completely disagree with almost all of these.
---
Refractor and ironclad are very little yield for high investment until you step into a nuke zone or silo reactor with a hazmat suit. I keep 5* ironclad and 3* refractor on reserve for exactly this on my sneak rifle build.
---
Gunsmith and the like enable crafting and weapon durability. It's simply a cost-benefit situation. I choose to run with 4 gunsmith on because I dislike repairing. Others might choose other perks to min-max.
---
Same with demolition expert. You don't *have to* take all 5 points, but you can. Those weapons are quite strong even without it.
---
Adrenaline increases stacks allowed for each perk, so it's 6% x 6, 7% x 7, 8% x 8, etc. That's a pretty good return on investment for builds that focus on keeping up their kill count. Frankly, I'm surprised this one even made your list because each point gives more increase than the previous, meaning higher perk investments are better.
---
I believe many of these are balanced quite well already. It simply sounds like you want to have your cake and eat it too. "I really like these perks but don't want to give up another that I'm running." That's the perfect balance. When a decision is too simple that it's made for us, it's out of balance.
---
In other words, you don't use these currently but others do. If *nobody* (or nearly so) used them, then it should be addressed. However, hopefully they have the ability to track least-used perks and weapons, etc. to beef up a few here and there because I might be completely wrong and the only person who uses 5* ironclad ever...
---
Looks great! Did they increase the capacity size? It looks like you have alot of stuff. 
---
I'm not sure you know what ironic means.
---
Im a long way from fighting her.  But ill keep these in mind. Thanks.
---
I've done all of that including contacting Bethesda.  The thing that was most frustrating was contacting Bethesda.  Apparently for support they have a group of trained monkeys that push one big red button that is marked "Tell the moron to RTFM"
---
Looks like you'll need a good scoped rifle, bud. I've got a similar issue with my housing situation. I set up behind the power station outside of Watoga and every, single, time I log in (or even when I spend enough time away on a quest) I find a Lvl. 91 Glowing Deathclaw and a few Glowing Soldier Ants going at it or teaming up to forcefully renovate my house. I just consider it part of my house chores now (fortunately I have an explosive shotty to clean with).
---
Oh I hate it when that happens. Before the patch I would exit and the back hatch would only open halfway and I wouldn't be able to exit it lol
---
Yes. Once you own it you can fast travel there. The doormat is used to change where you fast travel to
---
Thanks for the advice. I got one before this bc i saw it on here and wanted it. Now i have a plain Dragon i dont use. Anyone want it? XD
---
Had this once, I couldn’t move but could look at the pip boy
---
My group's end game has been hunting rare plans and outfits from events.  Pretty fun still as a lot spawn in new locations.  I imagine it will eventually be old.
---
So if I claim a workshop they spawn in my stash?
---
I just sell my super stims. They're so heavy!
---
I had a smart idea I though about putting my purifier behind the walls.  I stupidly was using the wooden elevated platforms which I discovered let mole rats under them.  So I came back to all my shit destroyed.  Converted all elevated floors to concrete to stop that action.  I do enjoy that my turrets are close enough to the Bot Stop that when that quest starts my turrets help wipe out the invaders.  Makes that little quest go by quite smoothly.
---
I suppose you are correct. Thank you for shedding light on my comment.
---
Does gunsmith help with energy weapon degradation?
---
Yes they are crap. Not even worth the 1lb they weight, stacking aside.
---
No the power plant workshops. Usually  the fusion core generator is already built somewhere. 
---
that's one hell of a judges gavel

This should help
---
No I just think that’s what he’s saying.
---
A few things you can try:
---
1.check stored, blueprints get stored in here and you have to dismantle them to gain access to the “stored” stuff.
---
2. move your camp and shut down the xbox/PC to restart, occasionally the temporary files hold a bug that needs to be cleared by reset (or at least this is the easiest method anyway)
---
3.unfortunately as there are numerous bugs still in the game and new ones from the patch if these dont work your only bet is to message support and hope they get back to you about it
---
Ah, got it, thanks.
---
New Game PLUS!
---
I don’t think so, I have the game installed on my main hard drive and my PS4 pro still blue screens. It seems like the newest patch introduced more crashing at least on PC and PS4.
---
How do parent defend their wayward children
---
We have had this post many times before, I would agree however they are releasing a steady stream of patches and if it was that bad you wouldn’t see loads of level 100+ players running about helping others
---
Stop screwin around you screw around too much
---
Happens a lot, best defense is teaming with other players, which allows you to join back to the same server, provided they don't also get disconnected.
---
Have you captured a workshop lately? Try going back and checking to see if anything was stored. I’m just talking outta my rear-end here, so don’t be shocked if thats not the problem.
---
Oh so that's what that quest is for. I got it at one point after killing a random Mr. Gutsy, and then the quest was added to my list. I'd figure I'd do it sometime later, but after a couple of days it disappeared from my quest list. 
---
GIVE. ME. THE GECK.
---
Oh. That actually works? 
---
I've been past that place 3 times and couldn't get it working.
---
IDK why but I sorta want it. Are you on PS4 and would you consider selling?
---
I will be checking this out this evening thank you. Ps. A stash box in the bunker is still needed regardless
---
Hi. I [might have the same problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agxs9y/odd_mouse_stutter_in_interior_cells_when/), but not sure. I have some strange stuttering lately when strafing and moving the mouse to look at the same time. I don't have any GSync/Freesync monitor and it runs at 60Hz. Could this be the same VSync issue?
---
Maybe so, maybe not... either way, the day keeps moving ans the fucks are still nowhere to be found. 
---
I agree, but 8k caps for 1 piece is a bit. To each thier own though, sorry you lost it mate. I feel for you. 
---
Congrats, you just jailed yourself. Unfortunately for you, wasteland bounties are only punishable by death.
---
Thanks!! 
---
This has been happening to me for such a long time and I'm so sick of it. I've lost legendaries and my first of some non legendaries I like. (lever action and railway rifle) Usually not at my fault of not dropping junk first but letting someone else mod my gun (low Int build) and them not dropping junk before dropping it. I've learned to drop junk first (and to respec some points into Int lol) but that, along with not being able to place items in your inventory in your house makes me more mad than stash limit issues. 
---
And for that matter ... allow us to turn diluted stim packs into regular stim packs.
---
You can just go in to your fallout install folder and double click the fallout .exe.  It'll launch a second copy and you just have to type your login details there.
---
then alt-tab swaps accounts =P
---
Yes they should its just one of many many many things needing to be corrected.
---
Hey man there ppl like that everywhere but hey tell me your console and maybe I can help you with anything you need 
---
It's totally random.  Don't forget to also scope out the ghouls/scorched/mutants that show up on the periphery.  They can also be legendary.
---
My usual circuit is to start at the station, head up the ramp to the high school, drop down to the eastern side, walk around the diner, up to Phoenix, into the plaza, up the northern road, then head west and zig zag through the western streets, up the stairs to the top of the transit station, check the three protectrons up there, back to the station and server hop.  I don't kill any non-legendary bots unless I desperately need steel and lead.  I also just loot everything they have and drop off what I don't need later, because I hate leaving metal piles everywhere and someone might actually be able to use scrap aluminum, copper and fusion cells.
---
I think it’s game. I play other games with no issues whatsoever. The only time my PS4 pro crashes is when I play 76. 
---
I have 44 fusion cores bug fix now 
---
This is legitimately a great drop
---
You don't have to rename the .exe.  The launcher tells you it's already running but you can just go in to the install folder and launch it again.
---
Have you tamed any animals? Mine is stuck at 40% with nothing stored and ive heard of a few others with this same issue. Inky common denominator was tamed animals. 
---
I usually have the problem where they don't see the bag so I end up yelling "the bag!!!! Look in the bag!!!!!"
---
Everyone wants it, so if they put it in it chances are it will be a high-priced Atom shop item.
---
Well I know that, that's why I said hire them to make fixes not make mods. Bethesda took a month to make a wide screen fix for PC that was crap compared to a modder that did it better in less than a week. It took Bethesda two month to fix the loading of the lever action when a mod for that what put out on FO4 over a year ago. Technically any mods on Bethesda.net are property of Bethesda so they could've literally just ported the fix over the FO76. 
---
Point is Modders are somehow better at fixing FO than Bethesda is. 
---
It's like 2105.  Mose died a long time ago.

Yeah screws are pretty easy to come by if you know where to look like you guys did.

Springs were the main thing I was worried about. they can be farmed but a lot less items yield springs it seems like.

No one's gonna buy them with the astronomical prices of direct currency conversion.
---
This might be the worst iteration of a cash shop I've ever seen from a business standpoint, and it's not much better from a community standpoint.
---
I'm honestly impressed they managed that. I thought those were kind of mutually exclusive.
---
What's your console we can play I'm almost at 100
---
FYI: I figured this out last night maybe it will help you.  I have a 240hertz monitor and when I run at 240 I get stuck on everything.  As a last resort before quiting for good I set my monitor to 144hertz....fixed it!

I want to put magazines on the magazine rack, not have it be a stash.

Also if using the Lucky Break Perk, all those wasted Air shots have no chance to repair for you.
---
Even so, players have the choice between cooperating and griefing. The hypothesis was that you're more likely to find players who just want to grief and troll if you're on a certain platform. Although I've run into them on others for sure
---
No problem!

I'd like it if we got perk load outs and we got one special point for every ten level ups past 50. Just one extra point to make leveling up have a purpose. 
---
Each weapon types perk cards take a full 9 points of 15 to fully max. Add in the quality of life cards and crafting, specialty cards for nuke zones etc and it's impossible to boost more than one weapon or you spend a ton of time swapping cards in and out. The game already micromanaged you to death with stash limits and food and water meters etc. 
---
I think it would give incentive to play more, eventually you could have one or two weapons maxed out, you could lockpick without having to change cards in the middle of exploring etc, youd just have to work for it. 
---
Sorry, I love me a good modded combat rifle so I need them myself. 
---
An actual alien, or the flatwoods monster? 
---
Nearly every weapon perk affects laser weapons. Have a plasma pistol? Pistol damage perk works for it. Gauss rifle? Rifleman. Automatic laser rifle? Commando. 
---
Am I missing something here?

Staying alive is the big thing. You’re in your awkward teen/young adult years. It’s a tough time because the quest log is long, and you can’t go after much of it. What helped me was exploring (primarily the left side of the map). I focused on chasing misc. quests and finding places. I’m a solo player also, so I sneak and snipe a lot to farm XP from scorched, mutants, mole miners, and random critters. 
---
No they don't...
---
Unless I am very mistake, all of your challenges are account wide.

I laughed for a good minute on that I'm sorry XD

Sorry to tell ya man we warned them ages ago. Still waiting on the fix from this. I had hoped the 1.7 million damage picture would be enough to go yep hotfix time.
---
Now that's what I call taking a bite out of crime.
---
Unless you use a lot of explosive bobble heads, I’d say no. 
---
Sweet, thanks for these tips! Much appreciated. I just launched a nuke and I'm around level 53, so my next "big thing" will be attempting the queen. 
---
re: #1, what is a good damage for a weapon that'll actually help? Like, I have a legendary lever action rifle that has 250 damage resistance when reloading, and 20 percent faster reloading, IIRC. With my rifle perks, my base damage is around 120ish, so I can do about 500ish damage a clip. Is that enough to be helpful, or should I be looking for a weapon upgrade before tackling her? 
---
Nah, he comes back as a swampfolk
---
This would be quite a sight, seeing someone store a missile launcher in a meatpile
---
I’ve seen one in 300 hrs of gameplay.
---
Laser weapons especially the Gatling Laser have always had absolutely garbage durability and about 0 use. Bethesda hasn't sad a damn thing about it, either. Add that to the list of reasons players have left.
---
Leave one character slot open, make a new character walk through the vault, collect your atoms.

Not hard

I'm always welcoming to any who might stop by. Just the other day I had a fella with almost no health stop by and ask to use my benches and decontamination arch. After he'd healed up and fixed his gear he paid with about 25 bottles of purified water (not necessary but appreciated) and went on his merry way. If anyone's ever near Watoga (on PC) and needs a respite from the robo-revolution you can always stop by the power station just north of town for a chance to find my red shack. It's the one with the big "Welcome Home" sign and more often than not a deathclaw corpse fertilizing the crops. 
---
Maybe you can get a reset by leaving your base in a zone that you know someone will have a camp set up next time you relog. It’ll force you to place your camp for free or relog again.
---
It’s either that or something with the workshops you previously owned. 
---
That'd leave them only doing 31% dmg.  Not bad.
---
I haven't done has many SB Queen runs as others, but she is easy to kill, or impossible to kill the times I have so not sure if the damage multiplier matters.  Also I thought damage was quantified, 50% more against scorched and -20% against others.
---
I'd be completely willing to "Give up" 100lbs on my main stashes for each character in order to have a separate stash box that had 100lb limit that was shared between all characters on an account.  
---
I always carry around an auto grenade launcher and with demo expert 5 it definitely does work, especially against large groups of enemies.
---
Kind of a waste of time on stock weapons, but if you're putting the receiver on an already OP bloodied/furious/whatever two-shot explodey .... that's when you see that health bar actually move.
---
wow, that sucks lol.
---
Whitesprings is off-limits for you. Those lv 68 ghouls are deadly. And yes, although technically it's in the Forest, there are many unpleasant surprises including a patrolling Scorchbeast. Forest and Toxic are more than enough.
---
I dont think it's by that much, the resources required to make the ammo is just too expensive for the slight damage increase. 
---
Sorry, with a weight of 0.04 I’m keeping this sucker.
---
Check out some of the earlier places that have cores that you might have forgotten about - Grafton Dam, Grafton itself, Camden Park has two or three fusion generators. Doing a quick loop around them would probably take 15, 20 minutes for half a dozen, and none of the enemies there will provide much resistance. Plenty of the mining holes and the spots between Welch and Charleston also have fusion generators. 
---
Catch for me was they compete with herbal that does not require animation.  
---
Leveling doesnt get harder and harder. The exp to go from level 50 to 51 is the same all the way to 99, then from 100 to 999. 
---
Better than my 3* hunter’s knuckle xd 
---
Ok bye.
---
How so? We get daily updates to the Atom shop but Bethesda took their sweet time to do a ban wave?
---
I found a two shot 10mm submachine gun, had the ability to prime it even though I'm a rifle build. Decided to try it out I melted through a lvl 50 scorchbeast (when it landed) faster than my TSE Handmade could've. 
---
TD2? ( Don't post this in the Fallout 76 sub Reddit, you'll get down voted, instead post this on the Fallout Sub reddit where people actually agree with you instead of fanboy)
---
also some FYI.  The damaged cores are 0 weight items.  And you can craft them while having super duper equiped and get more... meaning about every 3rd run you can replace all the cores without crafting =P
---
(hopefully they'll add it in. I think it'll come with or soon after private servers)
---
The Enclave drops always look like they ordered from Amazon and had to throw in a few other random items to get the free shipping.
---
Won't help at all, but fyi, before the latest patch (I'm on PC) I showed nothing in stored. My used budget seemed high for my modest dwellings, but I didn't really care as I basically just use my camp for crafting and storage. First login after the new patch, stored showed 2 water purifiers and a ton of corn. Scrapped it all and, of course, the budget number came more into line with what I thought I had. So, stored items can be basically invisible in the camp interface. I think one purifier was just the well known bug, but the corn and other purifier I think were somehow related to an instance a few weeks ago when I logged in and found my camp auto stored for some reason (no one was near my spot). Got a warning about it, but stayed on the server. Placed my camp back down in the same spot but the purifier and crops I have were gone (I had blueprinted none of it previously). Nothing showed in my stored at the time. Somehow the missing purifier appeared after patch, and the corn had somehow multiplied in the meantime. 
---
Anyway, I know it's no help to you, but whatever you may have in "phantom stored" mode may hopefully appear one day.
---
Thats not true. Even with 100s stacked you can't bypass the slap mechanic. People have posted this test on YouTube.
---
I kill the sentry bots at white springs, they seem to drop one every time. Just make sure not to kill them too fast, allow their names to turn red so they’re an enemy or else they’re not dropping any loot. 
---
well, flatwoods is "technically" an alien.. i guess.

I’ve been playing since day one and I just learned about sharing perk cards in a team. I never understood the point of the group cards and points in charisma....man I felt dumb. 
---
In addition to what everyone else is saying, take sixty seconds and rest in a bed to get an xp bonus for two hours.
---
I say give everyone 5000 atoms for this shit show
---
Idk the "best" I think has like 4 different mods added in one. Rare but we can buy. I have a few in stock. There are a few different mods, the one I'm talking about has all in one.
---
This is great work. They should pin this!
---
Well that depends, doesnt it?
---
My main character is actually a support chef granny, I would love to find a legendary like this for her.
---
Items were lost about 20% of the time pre-patch, often if you dropped another item the first item would appear in the new bag.  It was so frequent I haven't tried it post-patch.
---
the event "line in the sand" usually gives them as a reward.. I havent; checked after the latest update though
---
Do you think that even with all the right perk they do low damage?
---
Just ownin is their excuse. 
---
Get your head out of your ass and stop pretending everyone is cheating like you.
---
Isn't there a scatter shot mod for laser weapons? 
---
The crossbow this is technically real world accurate. Don't know it that was the intent or not but... There it is lol
---
Ehh gonna need to see proof l. 
---
What we need is + special point /5 levels. Feels  kind of dumb to level after u have most of perk cards
---
I have a gun that does ~780 damage per shot. It does about 0.2% damage per hit depending on how many people are fighting her.
---
I honestly don't think you NEED to have high DPS in order to fight her, but you do need to find a way to help. IMO, cryolator and being on a team as an empath are some of the best ways to contribute
---
Yes I did have a couple of tamed animals and was concerned that might be the issue.  I don't have any now and wonder if maybe taming another will help or hurt? 
---
I am grabbing them all now. I used to only get off of enemies, and even then I had to throw a lot away. Since the update I am going through them insanely fast. I just went through 2 in a SBQ fight and had to go scavenge some more. They either changed something way too far, or it was nerfed on my end or something as I would go through one every 10 hours of playing, now going through 1 an hour?
---
Exactly! It seems a lot of people don't read the part that says owning a workshop can cause you to have to PVP.
---
"Noob! Go hug that Fog Crawler.   Twice."

To all the asshole wanteds out there. We're Sniper Legion and you're being hunted. Play nice or die.
---
So, I'll eventually unlock buttressed and deep pocketed if I scrap enough? 
---
All 3 floors of my camp are open to visitors, besides my artillery room (which has an open roof).
---
Ground floor's for crafting, first floor's got a bed and chairs, and instruments on the roof.
---
Haven't had any trouble except for Scorched wrecking my farm (so I scrapped it), so I leave it mostly unlocked.
---
Unarmed Power Armor
---
My mistake. It still takes far too long (if you don't farm in plot suffering ways) to be with it if you need to switch out a perk card.
---
I don't see how that fix could possibly work. Am I missing something?
---
I got mine at all. Players are welcome to visit and make use of workbenches, instruments or take some food and water. As long as they don't destroy the place. 
---
I have found the only time I've had players destroy things is if I've left doors locked. My last camp was open save for my private rooms, someone took offense to that and destroyed the locked doors. I just figured what's the point in locking them.
---
I'm even fine with extractor, if I have one. I leave that unlocked too. Never had much bother.
---
As for myself if I happen upon a camp and it's open I'll take a look round. I'm nosy! If it's locked I move on, fair enough people want thier space.
---
No I don't typically capture them because of the server stability issues.  Do items in workshop stashes count toward your budget?
---
DAMN GOOD MEAT!
---
I’d love that I be able to open the boarded up buildings, and rebuild America. But I understand why that isn’t going to happen. Server load, rendering, all that jazz. So much jazz ..
---
I can't think of anything else sorry, contact Bethesda and tell them what is going on. 
---
Oh and I'm sure the community will try their best to help you out without a reward be8ng offered :) the people I've come across are all good people :)
---
Best of luck anyway 
---
For the rate of fire and ammo weight, dps will be low, especially when compared to TSE weapons. 
---
Now that’s not to say it wouldn’t be fun, I just wouldn’t take them against the SBQ
---
Now that I’ve had some time to let the disappointment subside I totally agree, I’m def going to give it a go.
---
Rad Sponge in charisma.  Rank 1.  Get card, share with team member, never worry about rads again in a nuke zone.
---
Done all of that including support.  Support (I use that term loosely) was the least helpful.
---
Could be a frame rate issue still - indoors I can go hit 240fps
---
I pickup Burnt items for this reason 
---
Ain’t no maybe bout it. It’s just tacky. 
---
Counter example: I'm a completionist who collects and scraps everything without exception, and enjoy being surprised (and rewarded for my effort) by new capabilities I didn't know existed.
---
Different people like different things, and this kind of discovery mechanic is pervasive in other MMOs.
---
I do agree about the lack of commitment thou
---
No vegetables left in stash or on person.  Nothing in stash Aid except magazines and not really that many of those either.
---
It would also help the people that got rid of the mistress of Mysteries rewards
---
Check out gamerMOMover50 on YouTube. She has a series called "Secret Places You Can Camp." It has a lot of nifty little camp sites like this. All with static structures and such. It's a very cool and interesting watch.
---
You are the chosen one.
---
With the new duplicative powers rising, TSE guns plague Appalachia.
---
Someone has to stop them.
---
That someone, is you.
---
Agreed, still sad no mods for xbox yet. 😢
---
You won’t be doing much damage to the queen, but I think after this lever action fix you may have a chance at killing the extra monsters and things. If you don’t have a high damaging gun (I’m talking 500+) your best bet for damage on the queen are melee weapons and just slapping her while she’s on the ground 
---
I've had an increase of respawning after death and I'm in a perma-load screen.... have to quit the game completely.  Bye-bye junk.
---
What you are talking about is for the normal sledge, not the super sledge
---
It’s bad , I was helping a bud of mine build his armor / power armor.
---
50% rate of items lost , haven’t checked since the 
---
We lost 2 pieces of combat armor before realizing stuff was being lost.
---
Luckily we used the bag trick and we finish his full excavator suit 😊
---
They just unlocked the frame rates a couple patches back.  Previously, if you went above 60fps all kinds of crazy physics issues would arise.
---
Or just drop the stuff that you dont care if it may be lost and trade  the stuff you dont waht snu chance of losing.
---
Well that's what mmos are usually like, have items that are so legendary very few people have it, i'd be ok with that.
---
I'd love this, all of the quests again but make them more challenging and require differing play styles rather than just power armour + TSE guns 
---
That's my hope.  One day I logon and find stuff has mysteriously reappeared in my stored.
---
Grandpa can't get it up!
---
I want this or pve servers. Bethesda your pvp sucks and its broken and not fun. Please don't force us into dealing with griefers and idiots using exploits to troll.
---
u/LadyDevann  I have only seen replies lately on threads showing off camps. Any chance we could get a reply on this issue. Just a passing it along to know this issue is heard loud and clear.
---
Devan bro people are getting really bored end game lately. On the chat mod in game we see alot of lads posting about been griefed over and over. None of them want anything to do with pvp at all.
---
We really need pve and pvp servers these crowds don't mix at all.
---
I actually carry around a 3\* weightless tire iron I've modded with the blade.  I don't recall the other two stars off hand, but I find it handy for dealing with lower level mobs if I'm farming something.  It reduces wear and tear on my better weapons and is cheaper to repair, while only weighing nearly 1 lb.  I wouldn't get rid of that honestly.  Mod it and keep it as trash mob weapon.
---
I like this. I will substitute my reality of this one.
---
I need a catchy super hero name though...
---
Your karma has been rescued and now my comment means nothing :'(
---
But yeah dude, I completely agree with you.  The fake "30% OFF" on new items was especially a low blow. 
---
We don't know that right now. The glitched flatwoods monster shows a Zetan model, but Beth hasn't yet put in the game that it has an alien. It could just be lazy modeling like they sometimes do. 
---
You say you’re not complaining but you’re looking for help to fix the gift Godd Howard has given you. Do you think you’re not worthy of immortality?
---
Yes, I need a place to display my Portfolio version of *The Lusty Argonian Maid, vol ii*.
---
I've had this happen and tried exactly that.  Got the warning, moved my pathetic camp.  Didn't work.  Thanks though.
---
gud boi dindu nuffin
---
Enclave underarmor clipped for me too when I was wearing Hunters Longcoat.  Switching to Road Leathers or any other underarmor fixed it.  
---
Question though, Does the Science Scribe outfit clip through the fingers at all for you?
---
I have the best enclave vendor luck. I’ve gotten two jet packs and two stealth boys from them when I don’t even server hop. But I have YET to find the calibrated shocks 
---
It also has to do with the spot you pic as I understand it. 
---
I would love this actually. Enemy levels would be properly scaled, I could take every workshop for plans and resources, I could do some things at white springs without super high level spawns and PvPers.
---
But, yeah, you go ahead and quit the game. Seems like you just got the push you needed all along.
---
Why would you wanna tame something players will for sure kill?
---
Mad scientist, no armor, brotherhood lab coat only, only energy weapons (gauss doesn't count).
---
I apologise. It was not my intent to question Godd Howard.
---
I will embrace this gift and remain unblowupable.
---
This isn't a bug it actually does increase while you level
---
I'd be against multiple 'mothmen'. Although there are multiple types of him it kinda ruins the mystery that there's only one mysterious Mothman
---
Ha. My rolling pin is explosive. I die every time I fight something.
---
Im definitely this one!
---
Stimpacks plan (as well as other Meds/Chems) is also sold at the Whitesprings Bunker in the medical wing.
---
It's a Bobby pin and a screwdriver. Former could be kept in hair, latter on belt or hell, rubber banded to a magazine or weapon stock. It would literally take only a few seconds to pull them out. Which I guess is all that it takes to swap out perks now that I've done it hundreds of times.

Since the update, i've been having double load screens loading into anywhere. It starts with one of the screenshot loading screens, then goes to the black screen with the vault tech symbol in the bottom right, then back to another screenshot load screen with a rapid spinning 76 vault door logo before i'm actuall loaded in. It's getting to be rather annoying...
---
You do you.
---
Me, I'd hit the gyms for the lead and Charleston for the screws, springs and gears.
---
yep. I didn’t even know buttressed existed until I accidentally got it for the legs, and thus started my quest to unlock all mods aha  
---
Good to know, I definitely need a better legendary, I put a exterminators combat rifle to one side in case nothing better came along, only other receivers I have are for the hunting rifle and western revolver so I won’t bother with those and il hod off with the combat rifle till I find something legendary that’s  a lot more deadly 👍
---
on Xbox my inventory has been growing psychotats magically. I server hopped with 30, logged back in to have 45. Game crashed, logged back in, and now I have 74. I've seen this with some other aid items as well.
---
Doing that now, what is it so I don't get rid of it?
---
Yes, the installation will not complete otherwise.
---
Its funny you say that. Up until yesterday I'd have agreed 100%. But I got swarmed by two lvl 80 SBs and didn't feel like quitting the server. They didn't spam AS BAD as they normally do and they actually flinched from gun damage thus stopping them in the middle of toxic donut spluge. Sadly I lost one corpse to the mire which still bugs me that a corpse that big is so easy to lose. The one of two I did get to had at least a 1* legendary armor in addition to the usual meat drop.
---
So you’re upset that you now have a new solo Fallout? That had optional co op if your friends join? With everything being your level? 
---
I'm laughing out loud because I know the feeling. 
---
LOL.  That would a sight to see during an SBQ.  Maybe get a lab coat or straight jacket to round out the ensemble.
---
I know it won't happen but I really want NV assets like just NCR flags or Standard armour nothing like eminence, maybe even a skin for the Handmade that turns it into service rifle
---
"son's a bitches Bunpuses".
---
You can always contribute 😜
---
Exactly. This probably never would have been found out if not for duping. I've never had more than 2 of the same bobblehead at the same time. And even that was super rare.
---
Then an upcoming wouldn't go amiss, unless you think I'm wrong of course. 😎
---
There's nothing worse than farming whitesprings and having some assholes turrets wipe everything out before you even enter the building. TSE .50 cal helps out very nicely here
---
Working as intended. 
---
Do you have or have you ever tamed any animals?
---
F indeed
---
After the update got 2 fully charged cores each round.  Especially if I see anyone else doing that event I jump to it since it's less caps than fast traveling to power armor spawn points hoping they have 50% cores.  Pain in the butt solo, but with other people it's easy.
---
easy way.   
---
in watoga are 4 power armor spawns next to each other.  
---
1. next to shopping plaza where the crashwd vertibot is at    
---
2.  a corner around the first is a ladder on the red building which leads to a roof with another power armor in front of another vertibot  
---
3. from the place of the second you can jump and fly with jetpack or follow monorail to get on the roof of medical center where there is another power armor and power armor mod spawn   
---
4. roof of watoga high has another one    
---
just collect all 4 and server hop to collect again.  
---
takes around half an hour to get enough cores for the next few play sessions
---
Today I had my first crash but, it wasn’t a game crash, my entire console crashed and shut itself off.
---
In FO76 i think there is a false sens of variety in perks. Many perks are just variations and dilution of a single theme rather than significant gameplay options. 
---
Mutations are somewhat more creative.
---
You really needed that reduced weight
---
WHy not use karma and then turtle, pump psychobuff, x cell, and mentats and come out after the 1 minute god mode period
---
also of note, my build was outclassed by a friend of mine that has a min-max build. He started with unyielding armor (1* legendary) and a mr handy buzz saw blade repaired to 200%. You don't need a god roll weapon, you need a build that uses the best weapon available to you.
---
He's upgraded since then, but it goes to show you how easy it is to out-think the system rather than play with 1-in-a-billion drop type weapons.
---
If they don't do something about the OP duped weapons, has the damage to the game been done?  If someone didn't dupe but bought a TSE from a duper, they aren't necessarily guilty (Maybe they knew, maybe they didn't) but the weapon is still out there... lots of them.
---
Bobbles should be fixed or disabled. Something needs to be done. 
---
Wow that is the dumbest complaint I have ever personally seen on this sub. Like literally an open server means you can find everything without having to wonder if someone got to it first.  Who cares about a nuke you found the super rare server. 
---
Uh, while I don't doubt your claim...this post has provided zero evidence of anything lol
---
sorry, i suppose i kinda killed the fun.  i actually love nerdy science puns, and these two are top-notch.  more decimals than i memorized, but i recognize the number easily enough.  i just wanted to be cool, too!
---
Since the last patch it feels like it's been nerfed a bit to me
---
it's been happening to me for about 2 weeks.. hop in, hear the unequip noise, and notice my PA right arm and leg are now in my inventory (adding weight). I also noticed that my leather  right arm and combat armor right leg are equipped after the PA pieces unequipped themselves.. so my guess is that the game got confused. 
---
Somethings I noticed.  Logging out in power armor seems to cost you 20% core drain when logging back in.  Jetpacks now DEVOUR cores.  One full burst drains mine by almost 5%.  Sprinting seems to have a larger effect as well.
---
As for finding cores... just yank them out of the power armor frames that spawn in the wild.  Usually can pull 3 in watoga and that'll hold me for the day.
---
I think the reason they have a stash limit to begin with is technical limitations. So having two stashes would be about as bad as just have double the stash limit. 
---
They changed fireproof to add explosive resistance, I'm pretty sure it gives more than it says though, as I too, am immune to all explosives. I'm also immune to gunfire and melee but that's another issue altogether.
---
Yeah they usually are these days, dunno whats going ln at bethesda but it better be good for this steaming pile they refuse to comment on
---

---
Whoops! You're right, sorry for my mistake.

Edited my previous comment and corrected my mistake.

Following in the Responders’ footsteps as I’ve been, I have purposefully been trying to design a C.A.M.P. that is welcoming to visitors and has most of the amenities a Wasteland Explorer might need in their travels. All crafting stations are open along the road, water and corn are free for the taking, and there is a bed and musical instruments available for use as well. The only locked doors are a back door (for security) and my character’s bedroom door (for privacy).
---
I do get nervous though, looking around other people’s C.A.M.P.s though, because not everyone wants visitors. If it seems like the owner hasn’t designed it expecting or wanting guests, I’ll admire it from a distance and won’t hang around. If it looks like the builder made an effort to make their base seem inviting, I’ll have a polite look and use their crafting stations before heading along. If would be nice if we could leave notes or gifts behind.
---
Except players' camps disappear when they log out. So either he fast traveled away, hid, or it didn't happen.
---
I would pay 2800 atoms for ornamental turrets. Give us a Rudolph laser turrets
---
You could try deleting the save data. It's a hail mary, but there are reports of that resolving some crashing issues so you never know.
---
Delete all blueprints?
---
The soundtrack is pretty good in FO76, althought sometimes a bit melancholic. I think they reused a few pieces from FO4 too.
---
Try without music AND without radio sometimes. Listen to the crickets :-)
---
Not quite... Items take up less budget the higher your level **when you craft it**. You don't gain budget with subsequent levels, just items created at higher levels take less budget space. If this has proven to be false then there is some other mechanism working behind the scenes because every 10-20 levels I'd scrap my entire camp and recreate. Every time I did that I was able to create bigger and more complex camps.
---
Yes and some are thinking this is the problem.  I've since had them killed off or die to mobs.  Wondering if maybe taming another would help but then again I only have 11% left. :(
---
Yeah what a terrible change. It *wasn't* overpowered, it *wasn't* being abused, it was okayish content for the early game.
---
Now it's just bait for poor confused newbies (or even people who don't read every patch notes/Reddit) to lose some caps and an hours worth of junk...
---
max carry weight

Fog crawlers drop fiber optics bundles. Fiber optics bundles make orbital strike beacons. This is sound advice
---
I didn’t know that. I thought it was the same everywhere on the map. I usually build in The Forest area, close to Morgantown.

I'm also pretty sure people will begin popping in be ause it is probably brand new with you as the first entrant
---
I had that happen with beer bottles. 9 bottles duplicated and couldn't be scrapped or moved or dropped from inventory. We'll see if it fixes itself when I go in later. 
---
Just scrap all of your defences and try to get rid of anything that provides defence
---
No that's the scorch killer receiver. Prime receivers just add the 50% against scorched and SB without the 20% penalty.  They also add extra dmg to the gun usually the same dmg as a hardened receiver.
---
To everyone being dicks about my corny joke, calm down. I get sick of seing dear bethesda posts so I came up short. Its not that serious. 
---
Just still looking for evidence of somebody not in combat already actually being one shot?
---
Played since a week after launch.  Did some whitesprings nukes, but most of my levels have been from just playing.  I'm at about 120 hours level 146, friend is over 300 hours and the same level.  It's all about how you spend your time.
---
You want to go tame a small animal.  
---
This will replace any "saved" spots for dead tames.    
---
It MAY free up some camp space for you.
---
I mean yea but one could assume there was an overall significant improvement fron t51b to t60 and from t60 to x01
---
I haven't looked at the effects screen in the pip-boy, but yeah, if I have strange in numbers equipped when I lose my last teammate, my mutations get weird for a couple of minutes.
---
I see, he said he turned his monitor. He meant he changed his settings on the PC. I'm old and took it literally. 😀

If the shoe fits
---
Since I try never get out of my power armor, I always just run around quick and pick up the new mainframe cores laying around instead of repairing. Never know when a couple of assaultrons will decide to sneak up behind you while trying to craft, haha.
---
&gt; Some people say it's griefing. Some say it's just PvP.
---
Think about the term PvP. It is player vs player. This inherently means some type of mutual action. Next month is a UFC event, Whittaker vs Gastelum. This means both participants have agreed to fight and agreed upon the rules. If a UFC fighter strolls down the street and suddenly starts attacking people you don't call it Whittaker vs John Doe, you call it an assault. And those type of people are put away because the world is better without them.
---
There are ways to opt-in to PvP - Ask the other player, shoot the other player, capture a workshop, attack a workshop or camp, tune your radio to the hunter/hunted station, etc. If you want to play against other live opponents it is built right into the game, have at it.
---
But attacking non-consenting players, or destroying their camp is not PvP. The game actively discourages this by protecting the other player (slap damage) and punishing the instigator (wanted status). Arguments that they can do it so it must be okay hold about as much water as you can dupe so it is fine, or you can get into the developers room so it is okay.
---
This just proves that people will literally complain about anything and everything. 
---
False. You can look at youtube a few people have debunked this lie. You can't one hit someone is pacifist. 
---
You can't download the schematics for it to craft your own pieces 
---
This is an excellent tip, simple, but will potentially save so much hassle. Thank you!
---
Nothing good can come from a loaded crossbow in your pocket.....
---
That’s pretty cool. The increase is still too low, though. Placing turrets in your camp eats up your budget like crazy.
---
Rub some dirt on it
---
I lost literally all of my spare plans/recipes last night!  I was playing with a group I had just met and they were being very generous so I decided to drop a bag with all my recipes and plans as well as several decent legendaries for them to look through and see if they needed anything.  Once they were done I pulled up the bag using R and then hit R again to pick everything from the bag up.  A little while later I went to put all the plans and recipes in my stash and they were GONE!  I did have the legendaries in my inventory though.  After double-checking the bag was gone I decided to log out and back in, nope, they're all gone!
---
See ya
---
Oh ok, I haven’t seen those YouTube videos but I’ll check them out.  there’s a lot of crap to sort through lol
---
This has been occurring more often lately. I think they may have fixed their health checks on servers and bleed players off of them. Kinda sucks if you are launching a nuke and the servers gone bad so they stop adding players to it.
---
Damn, probably duped anyway and if not, it will woon :D :D :D
---
Yeah that's why I usually have on or two only
---
Its great. Super powerful. I can get my base damage up to around 550-600 with brawling arm mods, adrenaline perk, brawler perk, mutations, and str buffs. And with my instigating mole miner gauntlet I 1hit KO most small/Med enemies (sprint punched 91 deathclaw in 1 hit). Plus I like the rapid attack speed. I split my build between damage and survivability so if you really want to be OP you can probably get much stronger than I am. No power armor tho. i have a secondary 2H setup for when my rad suits are broken and im in a nuke zone
---
Haha that might have been me. Did you help me finish the Feed the People quest? 
---
Imagine me going around saying that I was the King of Appalachia because some watery tart lobbed a 12-gauge at me!  
---
Before they add more, they need to fix what they have now. There are way to many achievments that are bugged right now between discovering locations, killing enemies, and collecting materials. Pretty sure at level 140 i've killed quite a few yao guai, but still nothing in the achievement log.
---
My teammate sent me a pic of a lvl 956 player he scoped in on. WTAFM

Exploit the exploits on a massive scale. 
---
And if u place a metal door in a dooropening wallpiece and you open the door, then place another metal door in that same opening, and u open the door, then place another door in that same spot and open it,  do this until you have like 5 doors in the same opening.  When you move your camp, you will have 5 blue prints of your camp, disassemble all of the blueprints and store it in your camp, you will have every object u used in that blue print 5 times  and your budget will be over 100% aswell,  but you can build huge camps now with the stuff you have stored.  I have xbox so idk if it works on ps4 or PC. 
---
I lose my +20 carry, all of my extra jump height,  and my extra reload and movement speed. Maybe I haven't waited long enough to see if it comes back, I usually just re-log
---
What do you think?
---
That would be if there were leftovers.
---
Tune your radio to the hunter/hunted station. That gives you a target to take out and puts someone else to hunting you down.
---
Yes its a real worry in this day and age how anything does not have 2FA. Too many security issues can be prevented by it. 
---
Be careful as you're likely to bring up the enemy levels to your level and you may also attract witch hunters.
---
The last part made me laugh so hard 
---
Wait is that canon
---
But the cake is a lie!
---
Yes. This is still frustrating to me. Hell, half the time when I pull the trigger and charge it to 99, nothing happens and I have to recharge it!
---
K well if the person you bought it from had 105 tse shotguns and over 1000 explosive bobble heads then he was a duper and what you have is duped. If not then your fine. 
---
Don't yell, sir.
---
I just rolled an alt for when I feel like doing such things.  Not sure I'd understand the point in your method, but whatever floats your boat.  I personally have fun with both being overpowered and being in a survival game.  
---
Where did you see this? The scorchbeast queen can drop radiation on the ground for ~15 sec but you can avoid it. 
---
I have not heard of her radiating radiation though.
---
Thank you for making my accomplishments even more meaningless. 👍
---
Witch hunters? Iv not heard of such, but that sounds fun. And yea I’m aware of the scaling. I can handle that fine though.
---
Sounds good! Is the spawn rate consistent or is it a finger cross type of find?
---
No, it was funny because I thought of what you pointed out when I posted it but I couldn't figure out a way to incorporate that. And "shedding light" was another pun. 😉
---
I did not know this!
---
This is actually happening to all my weapons.  I'll reload the gun, server hop or go meet up with friends and gun will have one bullet or something like that when I load back in.  Not game breaking but bugged for sure.
---
Idk why that comment didn’t reply the way it was supposed to but... vvv
---
Well that makes sense, but I feel like there should be more backstory other than mysterious monster/alien.
---
Anyone have an leads?
---
Happens to me all the time. If you leave the team, that you’re in alone, it will fix itself.

It's fine.

Reread what he said before you start calling people liars 🤣
---
I some times log into my stash being 700+ of 600
---
when i investigate i find 100s of my crops
---
like 100+ corn
---
100+ black berries
---
100+ muttfruits
---
I run at 144 hertz, but I still get the bug.
---
I believe it's something to do with frame rate and having more than 30-60 fps. The physics break, even after they did some changes to allow greater frame rates. 
---
I drop mine I the stash box at the church in Flatwood.
---
Holy shit, my mom really did sell the rolling pin she beat me with years ago!

I could sell whatever I wanted in ESO, that's an MMO published by Bethesda, right? And they had the crafting bag with ESO plus to fix the inventory limit.

Fuck I might just go back to ESO now that I think about it...

Feral Ghoul - All mutations, any perks but no guns or armour.

I thought that was because the gloves were tattered. If that's not supposed to be how the outfit displays, yes, it's clipping on the fingers.

Thats 10rads per sec. I was hitting her with melee, and i was getting 30rads per sec when i was around her, until she died. Never happened before last patch. Well time to get sniper. Melee ninja is no-go.

I'm level 90 on two characters. I've seen a total of two rad storms and one light sprinkle of rain between them. I sorely miss weather after the glorious weather mods in Fallout 4.
---
Oh, yeah, sorry that I wasn't specific. I lose all of that as well. I don't remember what it takes to reset it. Jumping a few  times? Logging? I don't remember. I just remember that it's not permanent and is only really frustrating when I'm being swarmed.
---
Good to know. I play PS4, I’ll have to test it out later. Thanks!
---
Yes, started using that as well.
---
I actually keep 2 bobby pins and 2 paperclips in the lining of my hat (that little band on the inside). Super accessible if I don't have my wallet which has my credit card sized pick set.
---
Resources are o make the ammo isn't that much more than crafting the normal ammo.  The 5.56 for example is a lot more efficient to me as I can add a flux and ultracite to basically the same resources and get almost 2x as much ammo especially when SD procs.
---
I wish I could get one to myself that would be awesome.
---
Order of mystery build.   One hand sword and pistols and sneak
---
you dont get to be 3 star legendary tough without armor that looks like it came from the bark of a tree.
---
Maybe due to it being 2 shot, and maybe shotguns spread allows some of the damage to be dispersed.  It's possible padded is better than dense, but doubt it.
---
What new mistake ? 
---
This is probably the answer then.  See this thread for more info:

I don't care but don't scare the bejeebus out of me by creeping in when I'm crafting. I only  go into other players' camps if the door's wide open and/or they have something like a pointing pip boy/girl cutout pointing at something like their water purifier.
---
Saw a weird camp one time: Was right across the street from the overseer's camp in Flatwoods. Neon signs for trade, buy, sale, whatever, a welcome home sign, a big red rocket from the atom shop, party lights, etc. Somebody wants to help/welcome us low levels! Great!
---
I check the door and its locked. I got that the owner was away, but why lock it? 
---
You mean mercenaries?
---
That looks familiar--I think we're neighbors! /waves
---
I didnt realise these are now locked to the player who called them, thats a shame really as i generally take anything i need (which isnt much usually) and leave the rest for someone else. I suppose you could always take the loot then drop it for someone else to pick up, save them getting a bounty but its seems like a lot of effort
---
Yeah fair point. Id prefer the quest but I could work with your idea as well
---
Not really, since the durability is impacted by modifications made to the gun.  It is a cleaner solution to change the durability damage per shot to more closely match ballistic weapons than to have to go back and rebalance all of the mods to increase or decrease the durability of the weapon by new amounts based on each mod.  It is less change to get the same result and much less risk of having derpy things like mod x gives way more durability than mod y which totally gimps an gun back to the original unusable state because some value in a database didn't get updated.  Also I'm guessing that the durability per shot is based on an entire classification of weapon so you can potentially impact all laser weapons with one change (depending on how the implemented durability in this game).
---
If the house is built in a main area with lots of Vault boy signs pointing in, I might come &amp; check it out from the window. However, if it looks like it's sealed up pretty tight I will give it a wide berth. I never go inside.
---
I had the intention to have a nice place that was open for people to use, all benches on the outside, separate bed and stash on the 1st floor with my own second floor. But someone was shooting at it the first week while I was there. Scrapped that and went hermit. Bare minimum floating platform in a spot that no one would really go to unless they feel the need to explore every nook and cranny of the map. I have only seen one CAMP anywhere near mine before and that was a few hundred yards away. 
---
&gt; I've never seen a game so faithfully recreate the tedium of dealing with the government.
---
Nothing specific about DMV or driver's license in OP's comment. Cianfanelli Bank in The Witcher series is directly tied to the government and overseen by the Temerian Monarchy.
---
I thought you couldn’t keep karma after whatever quest it’s associated with
---
No you send nuke on edge of prime fisure and pull SBQ out of nuke zone. I was killing her many times with normal armor. Hazamat only if some idiotic noob puled her in nuke zone.
---
Banks or mules is you creating a secondary character to bypass Bethesdas 600 stash limit. Using a mate (only) you xfer stuff back and forth as you need. Mules don't need to move so they can have as much weight as you wish. 
---
Yes, otherwise you do no damage. A friend of mine was showing me his camp and asked me to check out his prison cell. When I got in he shut the door behind me and kicked me from the team just for the lols. I got my TSE double barrel and it took me longer than I'd like to admit that I couldn't get out coz I had pacifist mode on. 
---
Can anyone confirm if artillery is a budget hog as well?

Picking up burnt books is equivalent to picking up a single bottle cap. I grab as many as I can find and cash them in

I was grinding Defense Events outside of Charleston, and someone nuked the Charleston area proper.
---
It had a great combo of TONS of Cobalt Flux and a bunch of enemies (All Bloated Glowing Ones and Super Mutants, along with a Snallygaster or two). 
---
The ruined, flooded areas are FULL of of Quantum Leaves (Bloodleaf) and Neutron Pods (Silt Bean) to collect, while to wooded area to the south had a bunch of Kiloton Creeper (Starlight Creeper) and Fission Fruit (Wild Mutfruit). Walked away with  over 50 raw Cobalt Flux, which became 7 Stable Flux with Super Duper!
---
What's especially nice is because of the yellow/whitish terrain color, all the Cobalt Flux plants REALLY stand out!
---
Will try more times and inform you back.
---
I have heard others say on this sub, they get the loot, just no xp. But that of course, is 3rd party info. 
---
This happened to me last night while "entering" my cooking station.  I just sat down and stirred the pot.  No menu popped up lol.  Had to exit game.
---
One of the new glitches or rather old but tweaked is some kind of removal and duplication glitch. Atm seems a but random but people keep reporting duplicates since patch as well as baggies disappearing and items getting removed when used or crafter.
---
Theres also still a glitch with items being removed when taking things like mineral deposits and junk piles and such.
---
Leftover Crack - Born to Die
---
If your 100 hours in and that’s your first three star you aren’t playing effectively lol
---
I had the jetpack and calibrated shocksx2 in one run haha I actually beat the game 
---
yea, I'm confused.. what do you mean?
---
Heads up, the "Confederate Uniform" looks like a chef outfit. 
---
They see you rollin', they hatin'
---
I have seen a Goliath mob at the workshop in Cranberry Bog. It wasn't during a nuke, and I'v only seen him once. He was pretty fun to fight. Would like to see a higher leveled glowing version of him.
---
Don't put on Dodgy perk from Agility. Then you take no damage until your AP has drained empty.
---
I went into my first SBQ event the other day. I’m only a lvl 40 and didn’t really know what it was. 
---
It was chaos. I quickly realized I wasn’t doing any damage. I tried helping by keeping the ground enemies off the higher levels.  Still not super helpful and I felt bad. 
---
Then it hit me. I had 1,300 in 5mm ammo.  Everyone was using a mini gun but me.  I just started screaming who needs 5mm.  I just became an ammo depot dropping 200 at a time for the higher players. It actually worked out really well and took down the SBQ relatively quickly. 
---
It duped itself, common bug been happening since day 1 but ignored so far by Bethesda.
---
Blaming poor server stability on Dupers and Bethesda do it themselves....between this and the blueprints for camps duplicating, I wonder how much of an impact it has towards the stability issues.
---
I ended up getting 2500 atoms out of them for pre-ordering the Tricentennial Edition and then seeing it 50% off a few weeks after launch.  But it took a good week of regular sparring with their customer service, and then the item I bought with the atoms glitched anyway.  So don't expect to get satisfaction, just try to enjoy the game as best you can.
---
It may hapoen that you dont see any blueprints, then u just need to relog and you should be able to see 5 blueprints. Just remember when u arrived over your budget you cant add new objects or wire electrical stuff.  I use those lantern poles and oillamps or candles to provide lights. Also make sure all the stuff you need is attached to the blueprint.
---
Why not just lower your perks? 
---
I have an explosive 10mm. Single shot. It can take out a level 22 no problem but I wont boost it higher because I dont want to be that asshole who one shot kills everything. It does decent damage on high level enemies but not so much my team or other players can get shots in. 
---
That's rough dude. I only have 60 but i can at least build a shack and my benches. Im doing my best to find a solution, please let me know if you solve it somehow. I'll be sure to do the same.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I didnt call him a liar. I gave other options. I've read it several times now can you point out what I'm missing, please?
---
it needs a legendary perk called "Thompson's teeth" that allows you to eat mole rat teeth
---
I'm already running in full screen.  It is really odd that I have to gimp the performance of my game just because of one patch.  It is certainly something that they should fix since it is a step backward.  Anyway I'll open a ticket and hopefully get a response.  
---
Yep from the replies so far I think I’m going to wait for a two shot legendary to drop and pop a prime on that, also see if the rng wants to be kind to me and drop me a few more viable prime receivers before spending mats on the ammo. Good to hear that on the right gun they can melt a scorchbeast
---
I tried over and over to fix it. It goes a away for a little...but it always comes back. I wanna die
---
No perk challenge
---
You might be looking in the wrong 'stash' check your 'stash' in the builder menu not 'on your person' or 'in your box'
---
Getting ultracite isnt a problem, but getting enough flux is a pain. Especially if you have a lower damage, automatic weapon, the resources spent isnt worth it
---
Eh? Do not?
---
Huh?
---
I've had this happen a few times and was curious as well
---
Haha if it only had special sneak value while in rural areas....that would actually give it a place in this game...although a flamer wielding player would be its nemesis lol.  
---
Whats considered a small animal that can be tamed? Ive only really seen deathclaws, sloth, yao guai
---
If you ever find yourself with 1300 rounds of 5 mm and you’re on PC, come find me and I’ll craft you some serums
---
There are loading screens which specifically say they don't stack and that using another one resets the timer. So it is a bug and yes, it was overlooked.
---
Are you in a group? When killing in a group the caps earned from a bounty are distributed between all team members. Also there is decay so even between a fast travel it can drop from 20 down to 10 etc etc.
---
Thanks! That damage benchmark is helpful - sounds like I'll be looking for something with a bit more of a punch, unless I'm just running interference. 
---
Yeah getting enough flux is annoying for automatics. Each shot doesn't do much damage, so you will be eating up ammo. Not worth in the end.
---
Because its what the game needs. These are common sense updates that are going to happen. Bethesda took an engine that was used for single player and pushed the limits to make Fallout 76 and are still testing things out. We will get the content we want. I'm sure once the bugs are fixed and we are stable that we might even get a bigger map on top of everything else.
---
A skill to learn and transfer legendary effects would be nice! 
---
well at least it wasn't an asaultron head. at least you got a weapon that works, and doesn't burn 100% of your ammo for it in 1 shot. lmao, not like me.
---
Means they don't have enough caps on them to cover the full cost. They do get a debuff to do less damage to other players for a little based on how many caps.
---
Is nobody else noticing the legendary farming exploit here?!? LET the legendary enemy kill you a bunch?!?
---
Yeah - Since the latest patch, I've been very pleased with the LAR's performance. I use to alternate it with my hunting rifle, and switch to melee when something got close, but since the patch I've basically been able to kill all the common enemies with one clip, at the most. 
---
Nope. I find enough in incidental power armor frames and generators.
---
That's weird. My base gets attacked fairly often and I've never got loot from the bodies. Same thing with the workshops I take. Only thing I can think is they tag the enemies as the turrets are shooting, but that would give xp too. 
---
From the vendor or on the open market?
---
From the vendor it’s 700-900 depending on what perks you have equipped/grape mentats.
---
On the open market? I’ve seen 1500 as about average for clean space suit. I haven’t seen winter jacket much on the trading floor, but I have one and I like it better than Hunter’s Long Coat—but I imagine it would be commensurate with clean space suite/longshoreman outfit. HLC can go for 4k+.
---
That happens to me if I have plants planted and move my CAMP without breaking it down first.
---
not for me it's not. on pc
---
Link for that build planner?
---
He's referring to the literal definition(s) of irony. The word is often misused, to the point where it's probably used incorrectly more than often than not. No big deal but yeah, Bethesda focusing on other things (things that generate money, as in your example) vs. duplicator, that's not irony.
---
Its more of a throwback to a real life cryptid from the area, seems like the only story behind it is that they didnt wanna make a nee alien so they just remodeled a zetan to fit the bill.
---
(Only reason its legs are short is to prevent clipping through the armor similar to how the player model changes to fit power armor.)
---
The real story is about a monster sighting in the woods shortly after a supposed UFO sighting/crash
---
Yea buddy
---
I hope not, but that would make sense.
---
In his defense , I haven’t had really any problems with the game until this most recent update. Experiencing bugs I’ve never experienced, crashes, weird delays. Things that just didn’t exist before the updates. So I’m not out here blaming dupers for server problems, Bethesda just messed something up with this update. I’m not upset though still playing regularly. What I am upset with is there were updates that they continue to not include in the patch notes and that is frustrating. Every game I’ve ever played typically includes every little detail in a patch yet Bethesda adds or changes things they don’t want people to know about. Not something you would expect from a AAA company.
---
Amen
---
Like I said in the post, her health scales (or maybe it's damage mitigation), so it really depends. Melee is the easiest way to cheese your way into DPS. 
---
Why? Wouldn’t that double the weight?
---
The issue is that your pipboy is not loaded yet. The most simple solution is just to watch 10-20 seconds for it to load, then try it. 
---
I looked at my Bobby pins and they say they weigh zero now. I’ll have to look again, perhaps it’s a glitch. 
---
Flux is easy to get I'm not sure why you're having problems with it but if you go to a WS nuke area you can come out with a ton of raw flux and materials from ghouls to craft the stable flux.   Even if you don't get a hit on the ghouls you can still loot hardened/glowing mass and high rad fluid from meat piles.  Now The color types are somewhat a limiting factor there as most of it is either yellowcake or fluorescent but there's enough there to get at least 2 cobalt and 4/5 crimson.  Violet you're best off going to prime.
---
You can actually do a lot with a character. A lot of good perks aren't even available till you get close to 50. I'm level ~180, and I'm still gathering various perks. Early on I finished shotgun cards, and some survivability cards. Then ammo Smith, chemist, super duper. Lately I've been toying with a power armor centric alt build. I didn't jump on mutations till level 110, so I had to get starched jeans, class freak and strange in numbers. 
---
Right now I can play heavy weapons, melee, and shotguns in various combinations since I have multiple perks of different ranks for those weapons. I also have a mini sub spec for rifles so I can use a Tesla rifle in group events without being totally useless. It's rifleman 1, expert rifleman 1, tank killer 1, and tormentor 3. I have plenty of luck to spare, but only 3 perception. It interferes with my shotgun build just a little, but nothing serious.
---
I have pretty much every crafting perk, and every gather perk including scrapper. It makes doing my repairs and all sorts of other things way more efficient so I can grind on events more. I'm a bit strung out chasing plans lol.
---
I’ve had this happen a few times with my Excavator PA. In the latest I noticed a weird dup... a military cap was oddly duplicated, with no weight and I couldn’t deselect it. I could drop it though and I put on the regular cap - no more issue with the helmet not loading when I entered the PA
---
If you follow the Brotherhood of Steel or the Enclave questlines they will bring you by a few marked and unmarked military style locations and tents
---
Yup, this and Perk Load our would Up my RP game ten fold.
---
Okay I'm going to try this, but I only have 11% left and might be scewing myself. :(
---
Use rad sponge perk and group up with other players makes radiation non existent

---
that makes sense, if my budget was that big lol. Also i dont move my camp often. Maybe a delayed reaction?
---
ooh maybe that's it?  I'm using a TSE Lever Action
---
Yes, rifle perks effect it.
---
Nice repost...

If you camp near the pond to the east of the lumber mill in the forest area, they sometimes spawn there.  Love them :)

According to lore, a Super Stimpack is not just a concentrated Stimpack. It's a more advanced chemical (requires a Stimpack, Nuka Cola, and fruit along with very high intelligence in earlier games to craft).
---
The diluted ones kind of don't make sense either, though. I don't think water in the veins is a good thing.
---
Just joking about Dodgy being so OP that you shouldn't even use it. It's too good.
---
None to delete.
---
That’s crazy... I’m not going to complain much about the state of things but damn, Bethesda at it again.
---
Or you “Win a Sweepstakes” and still owe a bill. 
---
More pasta
---
I've thought about a "Bad Doctor" build. There's quite a bid of medical inspired stuff (too bad we can't use scalpels for melee). Syringer, throwing knives, melee knives etc... I think any improvised chem stuff fits like nuka grenades, hallucinigen and the like. All those charisma perks when in a group. All kinds of clothing.  Prob chem addict. 
---
Yep, can totally face tank scorchbeasts now. 
---
I never suggested anyone drops chems. If this is in reference to HEALING others, last night a level 120 kept dying and waiting for people to heal him with a stimpack. You just run up to them and press E.
---
As for the weapon repair, I only fight from forward station delta and I’ve had it offered to me
---
A deathclaw outbreak event would be pretty epic.  After you kill a bunch of them, the mother comes out to settle the score.  Call the event "Maternal Instincts", "If Mother Only Knew" or something of that nature.  Maybe rewards including raider underarmor shielded lining, unique raider power armor pieces or unique 3 star weapons and armor.  Hopewell cave would be perfect, and there's a lot of good nearby locations that would be in the blast for additional legendary farming after the event is finished.  It's kind of a bummer to see an SBQ go down and the blast is empty aside from maybe one person for the rest of the time because of lack of areas for enemies to spawn in, including a fissure site and the pumpkin house.
---
Maybe something similar with a new location or somewhere like Big Maw, which is screaming for something interesting to happen there, like a 3 star mirelurk queen that's XXL with plenty of minions.  Possibly Brotherhood related plans, new Free States cosmetics or camp plans, or unique legendary weapons and armor with a fourth guaranteed exterminators star, reduced damage from bugs or poison resistance.  Radscorpions and crickets are awful.
---
Of course you'd have to nuke the site to trigger the events.
---
Know of any good spots for one? I must of farmed the crash vertibot spot 200 times for my deathclaw and never saw a mongrel. Thanks for the help btw
---
On a side note....
---
I _hate_ that the price slider rolls over from 0 to 25,000 now.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if it rolled back the other way, 25,000 to 0, but it does not.  You have to cancel it and reapply the price, carefully setting to zero, cause one click too many and you go back to 25,000
---
(PS4 btw).
---
I’ve built on the side of a mountain far enough away that I don’t see many people. Yesterday, this lvl80 in his enclave officers get up stops by and offered to trade. I’ve never traded with anyone, because a) I tend to play solo and b) didn’t want my things stolen. He offered to trade out of the blue. I decline. 
---
I invite the guy in, tell him to make himself at home and I get the heart emoji. Offers to trade again, remember the patch came out this week and I should be okay. 
---
He’s got a TSE Minigun modded out for 1500 caps. 
---
That’s my first TSE. 
---
Thank you wandering government salesman, where ever you are. 
---
Is it *actually* good? I'm using an Unyeilding set so it might actually compliment that style of play. I've always figured that my AP would just vanish right away...
---
Right, servers have to be under huge amounts of pressure with all of this.
---
That's weird. Because Witcher 3 kinda sucked. The only thing I can say it did better than other games was that it had very nice animations for non-pivotal npcs in an open world game. Other than that, gameplay, story, exploration, immersion, characters, fun, everything else falls short compared to other games. I will grant it it did a great job of not failing in any area and receiving a solid B- in all areas with animation bumping the game up to a B (maybe even B+). But I'll never be so awe inspired by a characters slightly raised eyebrow that it'll make up for other things like floaty, unrewarding combat, or making all your central characters Mary Sues. 
---
Legendary kitties...
---
Feels fucking good.
---
https://youtu.be/hNuu9CpdjIo?t=56
---
Not too worry they will be dropping god roll level 1 weapons and armor. Has happened to me twice now. Oddly enough I got the best doll items ever, only at level 1 and 5.  
---
don't know about op but this happens on PC
---
I just meant it had the same end result... weapons not breaking after 10 shots.
---
So Bethesda is duping now? Smh. 
---
WHEN WILL IT END? Lmao. 
---
The BoS outpost on the bridge in the Cranberry Bog is a spot that you can put your camp on. If you don't know what I'm talking about it's the bridge with the "Replay Last Transmission" thing inside of it.
---
I have started getting loot when my base kills something. It just happened last night when my base had super mutants attack just outside the lower gold course at white springs. I didn’t see xp granted but when I went up to the bodies they were like I had killed them myself. 
---
I'm honestly in favor of making more ways to engage of pvp. This whole online-single-player-experience ruins the entire point of the game. Gives us reasons and let us to shoot each other good damnit.
---
I enjoy the non tutorial holo tapes. There's some great voice acting so I don't miss NPCs in the reclaim stage of the game it makes sense as a cautionary tale.
---
That said as the game moves to rebuild it would be a shame for settlers and other NPCs to show up along with player made factions and the drama that would entail in an economy of scarcity.
---
hmm...must be pinkeye
---
Who is devann? Is that a mod?
---
I did two things at that level not very long ago. I did the Tourist Bureau quest in the Toxic Valley (longer) and the Mother Lode quest (short) in Charleston. Tourist Bureau was kind of meh, but it was a satisfyingly long hike. I did trigger some Super Mutants in Lewisburg that were way above my level, but everything else was extremely doable. Totally possible to trigger a rad scorpion up there that will also be double your level, but I managed to escape it inadvertently. 
---
I've got ten levels on you but still feel vastly under powered, but I'm okay with that. Makes the game last longer.
---
Pretty sure they use it while the servers are down to test how items behave, especially when they’re rolling out a new update or hot fix. Having a dev room in the game makes this much easier.
---
and Mama Dolce ^^
---
Or you have never fought a Cliff Racer in Morrowind. They would aggro on you and get stuck on the top of a mountain you couldn't get to. Wouldn't be that big of a deal until you tried to rest or sleep. They eventually released a mod that removed Cliff Racers from the game because of this reason.
---
He is someone who helps get community feedback across. :)
---
Gotcha, I was just letting you know so you can either decide not to do those events or can be ready next time if you choose to do those events. Hopefully down the road when they get private servers going you can get the option to opt out of PvP entirely.
---
The Zetan aliens also appeared to have abducted people in West Virginia; Sally is the first that comes to mind. There's a holotape referencing her character who is from Fallout 3. You can find her holotape in that responder's building in Flatwoods; it's the one facing the church. Holotape is titled: "Who goes there?"
---
Theory is Sally might've been abducted in some unknown time before the war, and whatever experiments done on her made her immortal, since she's still alivr 200 years later during the events of fallout 3.
---
Nah the guy's wrong. They're permanent and with three ranks in barter they cost like 3840 caps. Plus you can just pop some berry mentats to further reduce the cost. 
---
Maybe have mothman disciples, like cult followers. Also powerful toads and bloatflies.
---
What the hell! You can re-equip the armor  while in your PA? I always thought that's how the power armor works lol ugh I'm kicking myself right now
---
Awesome Job on your Camp!!
---
Why do you seems so upset my guy? Calm down bud.
---
&gt;Heart bite
---
This guy Cannibals.
---
Better to transfer them to a suitcase or some other nearby container than attempt to communicate a process to fix the poorly implemented bag system.
---
Yeah honestly its staggering how obvious some of the glitches are, i mean forget alpha and beta tests alot of these would be obvious if they played their own game for even an hour let alone an open and public beta test.
---
Oh, cool.
---
Don't ruin it for yourself. Just play the way you want and do the quests. Level 50 is a "soft cap" and you don't get any stronger after that, you just unlock more perks.
---
Boston's a long way from WV.
---
&gt; Whether you have pacifist or not people can still only do a tiny bit of damage
---
I know that's how it's supposed to work, but that's not always the case.
---
I have been one-shot in pacifist mode at least 4-5 times. 
---
I've had this happen before, tried to save this noob in an event and ended up eating his face
---
I still don’t like their in-game justifications for the lack of human NPC’s, like oh a whole bunch of people (including) made it through the bombs but it just so happens that every single one of them dies or leaves just before you get out..... yeah right, not one person stayed in a bunker or a city building or up in those damn mountains, sure
---
Beth is already informed about this bug, more and more people are coming up with it. /u/jessBethesda is the person to tag for this issue, she/he collected a few of our threads and gamertags to forward it to the staff.
---
I hope they come up with a fix very soon...
---
Yea it’s sound like a phantom glitch.
---
I’ve had this happen with my decontamination shower.
---
It’ll cease to exist and still count towards the budget and then one day it’ll magically appear. 
---
I like it when I meet Grahm, why not super mutants leading quests, he's friendly enough,  there could be others....
---
same issue on pc
---
The game runs a little rough now but hoping next patch will clean it up again. I'm having fun with just hitting level 42 yesterday and got 3 legendary from a 3 star queen. I can't wait to use the Tesla rifle i got as one of them.
---
My Fallout 4 Giddyup Buttercup collecting ass desperately wants this to happen. 
---
With or without the flames, but preferably with. 
---
^(yes)
---
Haha sweet, can use that on my alts.
---
Just think though, their government has been shut down for years, and they still got you the ID you needed.
---
I think that Idiot Trump might be onto something...
---
Right! But who are we, huh? Smh we don’t get paid to know better.
---
Yes please 
---
this happens to me a few hours ago on PC also
---
Last three drops from the queen...two rolling pins and a golf club.
---
The double load screen is intentional I believe as it let's everything fully load. On the first launch though I'm not sure if I'm seeing a double load screen which would make sense with this issue. I'll need to confirm when I get home from work.
---
Actually....I stand corrected. Sorry about that...its early lol
---
Ah... weird, can't recall one for the life of me.  Wonder if it's cause of Skyrim &amp; fallout 4 being connected for the mods.  
---
It's going to be interesting to see how wide the net is cast with the dupe ban waves.  I have a friend that runs a mule character with a ring of his duper friends and he was online last night, I was gonna laugh my ass off if he was banned. 
---
But wouldn’t people be able to steal them? 
---
Again though, I think this is them attempting to mimic previous games. :)The time of day related perks in FO3, for example, or Basher and Cannibal in FO4, etc. 
---
We need the thing in Lucky Hole to escape.
---
You'll experience disconnects every now and again, get the occasional crash. If you played and liked Fallout 4 on PS4 you'll like 76.
---
I cant thats just it. Other than trolling them while they dupe stealthing in snagging out of coolers and trust me i am no rich player. I had a total of 600 caps when i last logged out.
---
How exactly do robots become diseased? I have met a few...
---
appreciate it. I really do. ^_^
---
She doesn't have an aura, she straffes the ground with rad dust. There's no conspiracy here, move along.
---
Wouldn’t doubt it after the fallout 4 quests with the immortal zetan enhanced guy.
---
But my current theory aside from them just being lazy and reskinning models is that its an old prewar zetan that crash landed, got injured and homebuilt a hover wheelchair. Would explain the breathing apparatus and the hover jets looking like mr.gutsy’s eye models.
---
In reality of course the short legs point towards the reskin idea but i like to dream lol
---
Another filthy casual here! I dont think ive ever seen one....
---
You're the only person i've seen refute this.
---
I am on xbox and for me its worth it, i made it to level 95 so far and i play it almost daily, eventhough i did all quests i just find always something to do.  
---
what are you talking about?
---
that last patch has my game running the smoothest it ever has.
---
&gt; give it some time.
---
Assuming the game doesn't drop you ...
---
Agreed; the only place I need multiple explosive vents is on reddit
---
ahahahahahahah. Yeah.... no. If you look for stable game without DCs or crashes this is definitely not the game for you, atm.
---
I've played it since early access on PS4 and I've had an overwhelmingly positive experience with it. Yes I have had disconnects, but I'd say it's been about 10 total in 3 months. 
---
Hi Dad.
---
I thought you could craft them once you earned them. 
---
Cool that a legendary level 1 eye bot exists.  
---
We're no strangers to love
---
You know the rules and so do I
---
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
---
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
---
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
---
Gotta make you understand
---
Never gonna give you up
---
Never gonna let you down
---
Never gonna run around and desert you
---
Never gonna make you cry
---
Never gonna say goodbye
---
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
---
We've known each other for so long
---
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
---
Inside we both know what's been going on
---
We know the game and we're gonna play it
---
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
---
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
---
Never gonna give, never gonna give
---
(Give you up)
---
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give
---
Nope. 10 super stims turns into ~210 diluted stims by the time you finish with chemists and super duper. Multiplying your healing items by 5-10x+ is too much for me to get behind. Healing items are already so prolific that it's not even funny. 
---
If you don't use them manually and don't want to carry them, they're worth up to 15 caps each. I sell mine. I already carry 1-300 diluted stim packs pretty much constantly.
---
I have a slight aversion to melee in games - I always prefer to hang back and pick at enemies from range - so while the LAR isn't as good as melee still, it is definitely a low-stress, effective weapon. (By that, I mean that it is somewhat common in the wild and has low crafting requirements, if you can find that damn plan for it.) 
---
Should add that people who can spare a few perk points should always get Tenderizer and Suppressor...  those debuffs make her take more damage from everyone and do less damage to everyone.
---
I swap out my usual Lone Wanderer for Tenderizer/Suppressor for queen fights.
---
all good 👍 Just a matter of time until they release the plans for the mod :) 
---
It may be Event related. One of the early events at the Morgantown Airport has a scorchbeast that flys around and spawns a small amount of scorched for the Event (Maybe Daily?). That one is not ‘red’ and does not attack. 
---
If you’re a low level they just don’t bother with you. Just like in certain events like mayor for a day the scorchbeast that’s appears is passive to you 
---
Ohh! Thank you for the info!
---
I've had the frozen in place bug multiple times but even worse is the constant hard crashing. I used to get it occasionally when putting loot in my stash but this is totally random and happening way to often. I've literally been unable to play since the patch. Xbox One X. 
---
And snow please
---
End game helps not to cheese farming legendary weapons/gear. Or rushing through to level up.
---
Oh so those players I met weren't hacking, they just bought an insanely rare set of gear off ebay along with their TSEs? 
---
Case in point from the video comments
---
&gt;"I got my set on Gameflip. I just searched Assassin Sentinel and the entire set was available for purchase. I love it  When people try to harass me in game, I just wreck them  and get free caps! Even the two shot explosive weapons don't stand a chance against this set.﻿"
---
as well as the author claiming he got his 5 pieces through a "week of hard work" when in reality the chance to get 2 of those modifiers on 1 piece of gear is the same as finding a TSE, and consider the fact that your guy in the video has 
---
so the lesson is to buy off dupers and profit, while legit players don't even know about that shit and think you're hacking which when you take 0 dmg from a point blank nuke you might as well be especially after spending real money on the armor that lets you do that, but of course, there will be people who defend this
---
I think I mentioned tenderizer
---
Yeah it's pretty stupid. It is now a set amount of stuff for anyone also, instead of everybody getting their own loot from it. We ganged up to start throwing them out last night since I had 84 government supply drops and when I unlocked one of them belonging to my friend that marked me as wanted. He went and then started taking some stuff he wanted out of it and it removed it from my screen. They are now completely worthless.
---
The vast majority of people would disagree with you but to each their own.
---
Yeah wouldnt be half as bad if they would communicate but they basically shut themselves behind a door and are fixing stuff slowly while ignoring the community. But oh well, i managed to get the game alot cheaper for it since i didnt pre-order i suppose and thats something
---
Same same. The whole server shut down last night "server shutdown imminent" after we killed the queen. Of course it shutdown within 2 minutes. Looted her body, got xp but ZERO event rewards. Also, travelled to Watoga b4 the shutdown, and realized everything I grabbed off her body (a few nice things for once) NEVER appeared in my inventory. I was slightly annoyed.. 
---
The fact that you used the term cuntface just proves my point about what kind of players I'm talking about. 
---
Thanks for proving what kind of person you are. And what kind of player. 
---
Even just sprinkle of NPCs in each key area of the map would add so much life to the game
---
&gt; ARGHBVOGBUOIEUR
---
Is that your Murloc noise?
---
First I'd rather they fix her not dropping anything at all and then despawning completely before I worry about the quality of the not-loot I'm getting.
---
Nope. Game's been running like shit recentally
---
Balanced, no. 
---
P2w, depends on if buying off ebay counts.
---
Game is fun if you enjoyed scouring the wasteland for scrap to build up your camp in FO4.
---
If you *didn't* play fallout 4, I suggest you do that first or read the help screen religiously.
---
Sorta works but its not optimal.
---
Grenades and grenade launchers are pretty great, but awful for the endgame because they send the bodies flying and everyone will hate you for it.
---
Quad Tracking Rocket launcher feels great, but breaks after 3-4 reloads. Broadsider and FatMan are more fun than efficient. 
---
Ecin
---
Yeah that's a good to. I've started using tho. Psycho is a hellovaDrug 
---
I thought you could manufacture more, unlike quest rewards for every other quest. 
---
I would like to reset the game though and play through as my character started out during the beta and I didn’t get all the achievements, but I’m doing it now on another character. 
---
However, on said second character I’m essentially not doing the quests because I want the lvl 50 rewards! So yes, a reset of all the quests would be fantastic. 
---
Communists hate him!
---
I'll do that for now, thanks
---
As of right now there really isn't a reason to nuke anywhere but the 2 usual spots. Even if you were to nuke the Twin Lakes, nothing special happens to the Behemoth. Yes, it does level up, but that's about it. Nothing unique happens,  nothing else shows up, pretty empty except for the behemoth whod be there regardless. 
---
Nukes should at the very least spawn swarms of enemies,  but more events / bosses / mini-bosses / unique spawns would be great. 
---
The idea of multiple aliens in modified Mr. Handy wheelchairs is amusing. Too bad they're not wiping out those damn armor piercing gutsy bots.
---
Once I figure out percentage increase per level on each weapon I will more than happy to contribute to the wiki.
---
Yes. It seems to be that legendary mobs have a higher % chance to drop legendaries, but you can still get a crap roll and get nothing. 
---
I got an explosive legendary shotgun off a non-legendary scorched at the Golf club. So both have a loot table ability to drop good gear, it's just at a lower chance with a normal mob. 
---
Well that sucks 
---
Yea I preordered... really need to stop doing that in this day and age, we all know it snot worth it.
---
#good for you!!
---
Seriously, fuck those lazy arseholes. And what really gets me, is they act entitled... like if you come into the clubhouse and start killing ghouls before their turrets can get them, they come in and stomp around and if you close the back doors they open them again, it's NOT YOUR CLUBHOUSE fucktards. It's public domain. Those are NOT YOUR GHOULS
---
Isolated Cabin, Southeast of Vault 76, NW of the light house.
---
Responding to keep in my history. Thanks
---
Ganking is a gameplay mechanic that has drawn me in to games every time.  When I'm out there gathering flowers at level five and godlike (aion character I'll never forget) comes around with his glowing sword and wrecks me and my brother, it motivated me to continue playing for years and he was still there wrecking people two years later lol. But I got him a few times, and went on to gank his faction as well.   You seem to be anti ganking, but pro pvp.  That's fine, that's what balacned pvp games like cod and fortnite are for.  Battlegrounds, etc etc.  These are theme park MMOs concepts.  This is a sandbox, and I reserve my right to get ganked and gank.
---
yeah, it's pretty screwed up right now. Challenges for Atom points is what's keeping me going lol
---
Good write up.
---
There was a discussion not long ago about shotties/enforcer/stagger interupting her landing animation. I was upset to hear that I may have been hurting the group more than helping. Because of this I now stick to the nastier adds until she lands and then switch to try help keep her grounded. 
---
In the first point of what do not help, "If you choose to do this, please have pacifist mode off" made me laugh. 
---
Cheers
---
It shares in a group, and if they don't have the caps they only pay what they can.  This question pops up all the time, it is to much of a coincidence that its always around half the display bounty and that there are so many people that have a tiny amount of caps.  There has to be something broken with the reward, or the display.
---
Anyone under level 60 shouldn’t be allowed to join the event. Tired of al these low levels contributing nothing and making her stronger for the rest of us. 
---
then they do all kinds of things to get around it
---
In my experience they leave servers at least. I will 100 percent of the time destroy the turrets and the camp if there's anything else to destroy because this practice annoys the living snot out of me
---
I agree with this issue. I've got to think the limit was in there so people would not have a CAMP with 20 turrets running making PVP pointless, however. PVP when it comes to CAMP's is really not a thing that is happening. I'd like to see turrets scale for space based on their size.
---
I wasn’t raging mad just stating a fact 
---
All u need to do is explore and kill creatures, leveling goes pretty fast tbh
---
Wait this game is cross platform? Can I play with my ps4 friends as a pc player?
---
No, these are not common sense updates. And even if they were we have no proof of common sense being present in the dev team so why anyone would expect updates 'that seem obvious' is beyond me.
---
If you'd care to understand more about that wedding ring and all the other things in that house, please enjoy one of the funniest videos on the internet: [https://youtu.be/\_1jGnFt78H8](https://youtu.be/_1jGnFt78H8)
---
I'm pretty sure they all died or turned to scorched... 
---
A person's bounty goes up for each item destroyed. I recently destroyed a camp that had like 4 turrets and all the workbenches and some walls. My bounty was 800 caps when I was done
---
Do quests and events, those grants exp
---
* Remember that a higher level player may spawn higher level enemies if they passed thru that area before you. You can always "leave world" and try another where the enemies spawn more "at level" if you (or a lower lvl than you) spawn the mobs in the area
---
I'm on my third build (ok, fourth... fifth - i might have issues...) and notice that I was underestimating the effectiveness you can have early. At level \~20 you can take down lvl40 mobs (particularly headshot-able ones with the correct build and tactics), just don't get swarmed. Practice kiting differint enemies into one another, they will usually engage each other if you make yourself a worse target. On my current run I restricted myself to "no server hopping" so anything near the southeast of the map looks like its going to be a deathmarch. When, at lvl 19, I'd spot a lvl68 Mutant Warlord I would not directly engage but look further out for some other friends for him to play with - and introduce them.
---
Some places in quests this doesn't work as there may not be any other type of mob, but it is generally easy to pull off
---
Only if you are an extremely hardcore Fallout fan. I'd recommend waiting a few more months for the game to get fixed to a consistently working state.
---
There are a few here and there. 
---
There is one at Morgantown airport who is friendly and is related to an event that happens there. 
---
I've seen friendly ones off and on during my travels. One was up near Helvetia, although that one isn't always friendly.
---
Saw one at Watoga as well. It was having it's own battles with the robots (could have been linked to a mission, and was just friendly to me, I never noticed if others were about as I was having my own issues with mirelurks kings, scorched and Flatwoods monster at the time!).
---
Had this happen last night after we killed her. I accidentally dropped my three star grognaks axe cause I though I was on the screen where I press x to take a radaway :(  I went back to try and find it but couldn’t. So I assume someone picked it up or it just vanished into the void 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
you can ONLY improve the level of the items at the crafting station. If you go into the crafting bench, you need to use the item as a crafting component to upgrade it... basically sacrificing the item to make a better version. 
---
Nukesdragons.com 
---
That should be temporary. 
---
Have you checked again?
---
I wanted to do the exact thing you are talking about.  So this is what I did with my current toon.  Pistol vats crit build and I just got the level 45 summerset special last night.
---
Do melee and PA from 1-50 but don't take any melee skills...you can go to 50 using a nail board. Get cranberry cobler for the exp buff.  I would take Blocker and Batteries Included to help with leveling plus you probably will use them later too.
---
I did the work shop at the dirt track till 25 - AT 15 grab the raider PA.  also you can make a bunch of adhesive by doing a little loop around the track and snagging the corn, tato, etc that grows around the track in between server hops to reset track.  Also the wolf event that happens there drops low level legendary.  You should get a good amount of stim packs and plans and purified water from workshop reward.
---
25-50 I ran the big bend tunnel back and forth.  This will take you to watoga area so you can start checking vendor for plans and stuff.  Also the tunnel has two PA spawn points and some PA plan spawns.  Mobs can be anywhere from level 25 - 62.  So just melee them to death with the gear they drop. 
---
At 50 you should have your build..weapons a ton of scrap.  Start questing from start.
---
Been fun so far.
---
I personally have noticed a decrease in that type of crash. However I have also acquired some items that have lead me away from power armor and I've also heard that mass notes, plans, holos does something weird with the stash. 
---
Killed second one, it was same. Near queen 30rads per sec, on 2diferent landing spots. When she died instantly rads were gone. I have clip, can upload on youtube if someone want. Also had no loot 2fucking times, even when i was hitting her with melee.
---
They actually did put a cap on all bobble heads just not the explosive one. It's a bug they are working on fixing. 
---
I remember reading it. It may be in their patch notes if you look far enough back when they bumped it from 400 to 600.
---
Freakin' laser beams attached to its head.
---
Yeah, it is. I thought it was just dmg reduction a bit and consumes AP fast, but it works really well with Fireproof and Lone Wanderer. It might even be bugged too, or the stacking of these is just really OP.
---
Hi, just wanted to add my voice to those of other folks encouraging you to not do this right away and instead explore the west side of the map.  You'll still level quickly if you clear out all the locations and do the events that pop up, instead of trying to rush east into higher level areas.  And while Whitesprings is a good place to farm legendaries in end game, it can get boring pretty fast and at your level you will struggle with the enemies.  Plus if you farm it for XP now you will basically just be burning yourself out faster since all you're doing is leveling up so you can then do more Whitesprings farming at a higher level.  Enjoy the game, the levels and gear will come at their own pace.  Good luck!
---
Ah I see it now - tenderizer works even if you don't join a team, so its an appealing option for lone wanderer types to contribute to the overall effort.
---
Well its worth alot
---
I found it on my second visit.  However you know how RNG is in this game 😋
---
I don't know if it's been patched yet, but that weapon is bugged. It'll fire all your fusion cells in a single shot. Again, maybe it was patched in the last update, but if it was it wasn't in the patch notes.
---
BRILLIANT thanks for the info. Going to do this heh heh
---
I had my X-01 duplicate, and I've never stored it, I don't know how to dupe. I'm afraid to scrap it, give it away and keep it. It just sits in my stash quietly for now.
---
&gt;you can ONLY improve the level of the items at the crafting station. If you go into the crafting bench, you need to use the item as a crafting component to upgrade it... basically sacrificing the item to make a better version.
---
Also, the good things about these rewards, is if you get a level 20 version, you can upgrade it to max level
---
Keep farming that server. I've been reading on here about how loot spawn and legendary rolls are determined per server, so chances are you might find another TSE on a 2*+ wep. Assuming it's all correct of course!
---
Well, now I'll have to try it out. Thanks.
---
Nope but on a team with strange in numbers on can net you better results than just ×2
---
Stairs and floors do not have health bars. that's why. 
---
I would still like to see actual numbers when this is released, rather then the anecdotal friends list stuff. Last time I saw this claim mentioned was 1 week after Christmas, a user posted data which showed a huge spike (from obvious reasons) followed by marginal decline that still left the population well over what it was pre Christmas.  I'd imagine more of the Christmas kids dropped off, but without actual facts, lets not try and spew bullshit to fit an agenda.
---
Ideas for some legendary cryptid raid bosses:
---
* **The Mountain That Strides** - Enormous legendary Grafton Monster with massive AOE slams (acidic eruption?) and wide arcing swings. 
---
* **The Prophet** - Larger than normal legendary Mothman that can do the usual Mothman shenanigans of *poofing* about and powerscreeching but also cause blinding smoke (like the Robobrains) when vanishing or as a large AOE blinding cloud it can cast in addition to summoning swarms of Mothman larva or maybe even feral glowing cultists (or maybe even radtoads!). 
---
* **The Ace of Space** - Legendary Flatwoods Alien with a noticeably larger spade-like hood/cowl and larger thrusters that has increased speed and beam attacks similar to the Assualtron but that can pierce through targets to hit multiple attackers. Possible able to call down 
---
* **Schneller Geist** - A much larger legendary Snallygaster with a longer neck and hints of a tail and deformed wing-like protrusions that can spew torrents of acidic bile and reach further out in an arc with it's longer more powerful neck and tongue. Can roar to summon a small group of Snallygasters for aid. 
---
Sorry but whats your point?
---
if you check my other comments, I'm lv 180 with a 2se harpoon gun and zero assassins sentinels and one assassins cavaliers. every person with the full set is a cheat
---
Same here. It’s like on and off for me though. 
---
Hi there, could you explain it a bit more ? i also have some phantom items that holdes my budget high, but disen't quiet understand what you where saying :)
---
The point is to let people know that pointing turrets at the back door of the clubhouse is extremely douchey and they should not do it
---
If some moistened bink lobbed a scimitar at me...
---
You didn't mention any qualifiers of who'd they be banning.
---
Huh. It's like people have differing opinions. Someone must've screwed the pooch pretty hard to allow one to slip by
---
Obviously he lives a very exciting life, it would be much better if we imagine what that may be. 
---
If he tells us, it will probably be for some mundane reason and shatter the fantasy. 
---
Bleed = Oil leak  
---
Poison = Bleach reacting with oil
---
Nice I have a 200hertz monitor so this could be the issue I'll try it out!
---
No , I meant that I’ve talked to people all systems and all have the same bug.
---
I'm certainly not against more npcs being added, but I've enjoyed the writing and voice acting that we have so far.
---
Personally I don't care how the story is delivered as long as it is engaging. I think that those who can't be arsed to listen to a tape would probably be the ones space-barring through npc convos anyway.
---
Plus it's not like this engine is capable of delivering quality facial animations that would greatly enhance a story.
---
Cheaters showing others how to cheat getting banned? How can that possibly be a bad thing for the game?
---
No prob man
---
Not for everyone, but I’m also referring to people getting into the dev room. I had people trying to sell me PA skins that hadn’t even entered the atom shop yet
---
That does sound familiar. I think it was some speculation for the most part, but I can see Vaults opening up and acting similar to dungeons or raids where you have to fix something or recover something while surviving the experimental conditions gone awry.
---
My gamertag is MergedSpy93289
---
Before and after the update, I have always found that discovering Fusion Cores, was either feast or famine. I might go a day or two without seeing any, then the next day, I found 5 in a row, in stashes, generators or workshops.
---
According to to my 2400 fusion cells, it was not.
---
lol no worries, it was years ago, I like to poke fun at myself ;-) I'm much happier now
---
My point is that people getting banned for breaking TOS isn't a controversy. As well as to explain my opinion on the matter.
---
The second one I saw was at wotoga train station and I'm a lvl77
---
Crafting a level 5 Fireaxe can one-shot almost everything in low level areas. A weapon you usually can't naturally obtain at that level.
---
Gt is Trailsniper01
---
What a coincidence that's what Op's mom requires too.
---
I'd run around in my chonies and a beer hat smashing everything and looting listening to country roads 
---
I hope so. It’s been a few months and I preordered this game for $60 and now it’s down like 76% 
---
I was so fucking hyped for this game but can still barely play it without crashing, getting sick, or just not having fun
---
I am on pc but it should be in the menu after you joined a game. Got to gameplay and turn on pacifist
---
Dude fuck that cave. That scared the hell out of me the first time I explored there.
---
From what I have experienced, energy weapons cant do explosive damage unless they have some form of physical damage to scale the explosive damage off of. A prime example would be a plasma gun, it does both physical and energy damage. So the explosive effect on energy weapons is literally useless unless you can somehow add a mod to give it physical damage
---
Screw that, finally found the second one for my excavator armor, 590 carry weight! Perfect when you need to go on junk runs.
---
Nope it isnt
---
Cuz that’s how you roll?😜
---
Nope its all random
---
Honestly I had no idea there are rad storms.
---
I'm impressed he couldn't spell bait and you couldn't spell ingenuity.
---
I'm 32 and finally watched this movie for the first time yesterday. I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.
---
&gt; 1. Players should be rewarded and not banned for giving light to the exploit. Instead of fixing the problem they ban the player.
---
No. In security parlance this is called irresponsible disclosure. The correct thing to do is to make a video on it and submit the video to the game support staff to get a fix underway and when fixed release the video.
---
I have absolutely no problem with people practicing irresponsible disclosure getting banned.
---
Happens all the time in security research. All disclosing publicly before a patch is available does is to entice others that would not normally engage in the behavior to engage in the behavior.
---
There should be some kind of reward involved as that's the way real life stuff works. Disclose a bug to Microsoft/Google etc... and you will get some cash. In games I suppose virtual currencies should be the reward.
---
I agree that the Quartering is off base with his whole confess a crime thing. But I also expect that because he is not a smart guy. Yes when the game company reaches out to you they are seriously in search of every way something happened so that they can fix it. More often than not assisting will result in you not getting banned. His attitude encourages more people not to cooperate and get perma banned. I don't care because cheaters and dupers should be banned.
---
Couldn't they just take it out when they're done? I know they are there for a reason. Though there is a solution to the problem and they could just be lazy at implementing it. 
---
High level crafting good low level weapons, like a Level 5 Fireaxe, which is able to one-shot most low level enemies.
---
Hey mate i m on top of the excavator in mount blair right now looking for this recipe bit can’t find any mirror. Do you remember precisely where it is ?
---
no, its intended. Imagine if you could kill your buddy who racked up a 1,000 cap bounty, have him lose 0 caps and you gain 1,000. 
---
AND half the time I go to request one the terminal is broken and I don't have circuitry. I'm not going to carry circuitry around just in case I run by a relay tower, jesus christ. I have 150 goverment supply reqs in my inventory and beginning to wonder if they are causing lag being in there? Probably not but these sure do suck. I request them and never pick them up... can noobs get the loot i hope?
---
I'd love to take it, I'm level 5 or 6 atm. Sadly I dont get off work until 330 est. If you still have it then, I'd like it.
---
Is that the highest you’ve been? The game is really pretty dreadful for me since I’ve leveled 2 different builds past 85. I guess it depends on what kinds of games you enjoy but the quests, and the main quests are awful
---
I am on pc and I am crashing much more often now, and I am unable to move if I access my pipboy when I load in. 
---
AND can it be shut most of the damn time ?
---
So yeah.. to play the devil's advocate here, we need to be *fair*.
---
Don't blow sunshine and rainbows pretending that an issue isn't an issue because:
---
- You didn't experience it yourself.
---
- You don't believe the person posting it.
---
- You don't believe the person's proof is adequate / legitimate.
---
- It's not popular opinion.
---
We all want the game to succeed, but it will only do so if we keep an even keel about these things.  If we swing the pendulum too far to the "NOTHING IS WRONG, EVERYTHING IS FIXED NOW" side, then Bethesda won't have as much of an incentive to fix existing things.
---
It's a great and fun game.  It's not a complete shitfest, and it isn't all carebears and lollipops.  It's a work in progress - by design.  This is not a turn and burn game.  They are going to be working on this and adding new things for many years to come.
---
I think that post is unsubstantiated for the most part. Not saying he’s wrong, but it’s main corroboration is anecdotal. Mine mostly is as well. 
---
I just don’t think it’s worth shooting her in the air because there’s something changing in her damage mitigation or something else in flight. If she’s static in the air, then maybe it’s worth it.
---
Yeah, sometimes it's a real pain to figure out the snap order. Thank you so much for the suggestions! I finally had some time to try them out today. The problem here is the angled wall piece at the far end (the one right above my red lines) is higher than the position where I was trying to snap the problematic roof. I ended up going for a different approach, because I just couldn't get it to work again with the current setup.
---
I think you're definitely gonna have to post video proof of this - especially if it could be a something as small as a temporary UI glitch.
---
After the now-debunked bug where people could allegedly take your items without consent via trade, people are gonna want proof otherwise people may end up just downvoting this...
---
I like to think that the ones you encounter are more like specters or projections of the true Mothman since they all seem to crumble to dust when killed. 
---
On PC we still have hotkeys assigned to the wheel, I couldn't live without it, especially fighting SBQ. I'm still &lt; 100, but I refuse to hide and I do reasonable damage to the bitch even if i don't have a TSE. Rifle or 50 cal if she's flying high,  AP shotgun if she's low, Grog axe on ground. I'm primarily a shotgun build so I have all the perks and enforcer. I can generally stagger her a few times and get her to land. Fun for all. 
---
Jup my teammate got the same issue yesterday 
---
Or...Stink Eye......
---
As soon as I saw this headline, I knew...
---
Dev room and the game is still horrible for a lot of people. 
---
But that's what the big chunk of text above says..... ;)
---
Agreed, I'm hoping the DLC and content drops will add more end-game stuff to do. I'm keeping busy with doing challenges and getting info for guides I'm working on, but overall the end game is weak. To be fair, even World of Warcraft, one of the longest running (if not THE longest) MMO, their initial release had literally no end-game content: there were no raids and some of the high level dungeons didn't exist. I'm hopeful BSG takes this opportunity to make end-game fun and interesting... And buff Field Medic range, I hate having to literally pat everyone's back to have them be affected by my stimpack heals lol
---
If you follow the monorail from the large elevator and head Southwest out of the mountains you will find a skeleton in a lawn chair with a wedding ring on the arm of the chair.
---
Damn shame bro looks like you have the same bad luck as i have on rng
---
My main character is a nun (I was going for a sort of Canticle for Leibowitz homage) so her camp is supposed to be like a monastic community, place of refuge for anyone who needs it, and everybody’s welcome to harvest her plants/water or use her benches/instruments/beds, that’s what they’re for. There’s a lock on her sleeping area but that door is only closed while she’s sleeping, and one on her generator hut that was intended to keep enemies out but really it just locks them in so I should take that off, heh.
---
That said, it catches me off guard sometimes when strangers show up when I’m there, when I look up from crafting or I’m just hopping back at the end of a session to stash stuff and now I’ve got company.
---
Here's my player interactions from today.
---
I was doing my vendoring run from my camp (across the street north of the tracks from Whitesprings Station.  I noticed a "help" player emote coming from Blackwater Mine, so I veered left and sprinted up the rocks to find a lvl 31 trying to take out a pile of mole miners.  I helped him light them up, looted all the bodies he didn't get a hit on, and left them all the guns, ammo and scrap as if he got the kills.  I also left him a dozen stimpacks, all the rad-x I had and a handful of radaway.  After he picked it all up and gave me a heart, I gave him a "follow me" and led him to my house just down the street where he could break everything down, stash stuff, grab some food and water, get rid of his rads and have a nap.
---
The other interaction was while doing my Watoga legendary farming.  I saw a few people around the station with one guy constantly getting 5 cap bounties, so I went to check it out surreptitiously.  I hid partially behind a shrub with chameleon armor and saw lvl 90-ish someone with an explosive Dragon one shotting players that were spawning in.  He appeared to be showing off his bad-ass damage, allowing them to kill him and remove the bounty once he showed them how big his dick was.  It was kinda like some fool revving his engine and burning out at a stoplight.  Childish AF.  I gave him a head-tap with my two shot lever rifle and a thumbs down when he spawned back in.  I server swapped after dumping my steel and lead, so I don't know if he continued acting like a prick when I left.
---
And just to prove that it's not all wine and roses, I was trying to make my Watoga circuit today and had a run where i was completely cockblocked by some guy with 20% health, a TSE combat shotgun, excavator armor with marsupial and Speed Demon mutations that was jumping around and one shotting everything.
---
&gt; Its been 3 months and they have released zero new content
---
As is expected. What, did you expect new content every month?
---
+1 to that. Busy unloading into the sky, taking a step and falling into her crack is really inelegant. I should have respawned in a clown costume.
---
Thank you for the clarification. I knew I saw them on crafting list.. just did not investigate further. 
---
"Current mods: Wood"
---
People who don't get banned report they've been banned.  People who get banned for something extreme report they've been banned for something minor.  Maybe you should run an internet poll for some super duper accurate numbers.
---
I am in this bucket.  It was some insane rocket sledge that took me down - not a TSE, or whatever.  I didn't have the presence of mind to take a video capture of the incident.
---
Had a group launch 3 straight nukes last night and 3rd Queen loot never materialized before her body vanished.  Even though the transfer screen showed she had 41 of weight of items on her.
---
Computer viruses.
---
Yeah I'm glad I asked sounds like there's some easy ways to farm I didn't know about.
---
I know this game has pushed my limits alot but the community and my 76 mates keep me grounded in the game.
---
If it was not for them i would of dropped this game already. Having alot of issues since the last patch. But i still have faith that 76 can only get better and better.
---
That was fixed in one of the last patches.
---
To be honest, if you were fighting say SBQ or something like that it wouldn't be a terrible idea to just go ham on her with it. Would decrease her output while shes on the ground. Granted you ain't setting the world on fire, but at least your not a barn-flower in the battle lol.
---
That's what happens when your entire fan base is purely single-player.
---
I feel that others like myself who have played these games see nothing besides the normal launch issues.
---
It’s on YouTube for all to see.   I have heard a lot of people say it can happen but no one has posted proof. So I will believe the actual evidence I can see. Not 10 people making up things Bc they don’t know how the games pvp system works. 
---
Unless someone offers something crazy for it, I would just keep it and hope they fix the salvaged assaultron heads
---
I keep wondering if this would be useful against the SBQ. Anyone out there try it?
---
No, there should be no reward for exploiting a games mechanics for personal gains, whether it's real life or in game. Ban them all, they are the reason this games economy is horribly ruined and the experience is a joke. 
---
I was also grinding the handmade, took me 30ish hops to even get the quest. Then I finally got it, server disconnected at the final moment. Well, tried again... after another 20 hops I got it again, finished the quest, got a .44 plan. Couple days later I tried again, disconnected at the final moment.
---
Love my life
---
Suddenly I pictured a hermit crab using an unexploded nuclear bomb as a shell, and if you fail to kill him in time it blows. *nods* yes, I would love to do that
---
Yeah, there is plenty of room in this game for LOADS more content.  Raid bosses, raid dungeons, long-chain quests, more dynamic events, expanded story line quests.  
---
Of course, they need to get some of the basic stuff nailed down first.  You know, things like fixing the CTD and disconnect issues--simple stuff like that.
---
Damn, alright thanks guys!
---
I have a two shot assaultron head legendary never used , thanks to you will never do lol 😂 
---
Thanks for the heads up 
---
Would you mind copy/pasting the text to Reddit, for those poor souls at work who can't access bethesda's site?
---
if you don't complete the quest you keep it
---
I agree, I think it's still a fps issue that they have had even after unlocking it.  I'll play some more tonight and test it some more.  I remember not having the issue when the game was locked at 60fps...
---
Have you tried 120hertz?
---
Oh ok, just wasn't very clear from your post tbh. 
---
No banning people for breaking the TOS isn't a controversy, cheaters get banned. I just hope that the cheaters do get banned and not just 1 or 2 you tubers that for whatever reason Bethesda choose to single out.
---
If people have items in there accounts they shouldn't have they should be banned, no need for videos or 10 million snowflake articles about it. 
---
Didn't you know? I'm entitled to do whatever I want, and I deserve a thank you for spitting in your face.... /s
---
In all seriousness these YouTubers have an ego problem. They think they're special, they think they're smarter than they actually are and they get off on believing they're leading some kind of charge against evil video game producers. They remind me of the guy that leaked all the Half Life 2 content. He had such an ego he actually thought Valve was going to hire him because he was such a genius. Spoiler alert... Valve had him arrested.
---
Kinds curious too see what happens. 
---
I'm actually going to bed since it's  eeally late in Australia right now, but I'll be on around 2030 EST. I still have it, if you're on it's yours. 
---
That is so true lol. Like finding a needle in a haystack. I found the YouTube video from a post on reddit here talking about it. 
---
Update: You can find this now here: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019)
---
Thanks again!
---
Rip ammo :(
---
Stay off people’s private property. You come to my base, I’m shooting you.
---
Really ? Where did you found it ? For me it was at the 2nd floor I believe.
---
Had this happen to us too. Hopefully BSG will be able to make improvements to the trade UI in the near future
---
My game has been freezing and crashing since launch. Not as much but it still does. It happened twice 2 nights ago. 
---
Its a fallout game so if you're into them I'd say it's worth it.
---
Like most games with shaky netcode your connection is key.
---
Some ppl dc every 20mins others it takes hours.
---
My experience has been pretty good but others have horror stories
---
Wow, I can't believe nobody has thought of this before! 
---
**/s**
---
Dang they still didnt fix this?!
---
Ops. I didn't know that :/
---
Yeah, ignore things like the ghouls or the collapsed floors or the straight jackets or even *the skeleton that was handcuffed to its bedframe* (WTF?!), but kid's blocks. That's the reason.
---
... I'm just being a smart-ass. I saw those blocks first time I was going through and thought it was a neat touch.
---
The true measure of an op TSE weapon is whether or not you can blow yourself up with it with one shot.
---
That's true. Lets first decide whether hes a hero or villian in this fantasy. I like to imagine he's kind of a hero and goes around picking locked car doors for the local townsfolk when they lock their keys inside the car.
---
So you grabbed the duped items and thus had them in your inventory.. which is probably what triggered the mass item creation flag on Bethesda's end... 
---
What did you do with the duped items that you grabbed?
---
will buy. IGN: Rinzler4171. How many caps?
---
I just keep dumping the points in other classes so if my weapon meta changes I'm prepared already 
---
Yeah. Cant be hard to make the popup on the right side show a plans needed picture instead of the perk needed picture when you hover over something grayed out. 
---
Wrong, just post on Reddit about how horrible dying was.  :p
---
True. I know there's a mod out there that'll do this for you but I do not know BSG's stance on it, and I'd rather ask for their permission than their forgiveness because I'm loving this game too much
---
Same here man, even though the game might not be respected in the community but i have deep and strong respect fir the community who recognise what this game is and what it has to offer
---
Nice shots! 
---
Where’s that power armor helmet at? 
---
Hey, you wrote it out smartly and it's a good point. It's just something that has been suggested before. That's all.
---
Twin shoe environment 
---
Was it not a mistake to keep it in the game 
---
No. It doesn't increase. It's been tested.
---
Those folks are just guessing at this point with no evidence.
---
Top floor when you’re inside the resort. There’s a little hand scanner that opens a wall to reveal the entrance. 
---

---
I'm going to farm this spot tonight after work. Fingers crossed
---
🤔 but which is the true Mothman?
---
You have to go over the patch notes with a fine toothed comb.  There was one a few patches ago where they fixed a bug that was preventing melee attacks from building the crit meter at all (kinda important) but they buried it in one of the last rows of this huge set of patch notes -- under "User Interface."
---
Yeah, cause we need more turret spam WOOO /s
---
I wish we got Jacobstown 2.0
---
welp. they really want to force you into power armor jesus christ.
---
Diablo 3 loot drops at launch were pretty fucking abysmal too
---
Don't know if you are serious or just trolling me a bit xD
---
Yeah it’s genuinely difficult to play the game because what do I do?
---
no, i meant the point behind their actions. the people with missile turrets
---
The scariest part of fort defiance is the damn wendigo that is smart enough to use elevators and appears out of seemingly nowhere every time I let my guard down. I searched that white building once looking for it, heard in breathing, and finally determined it was between floors in a sealed room. Went upstairs and got jumped at a crafting bench.
---
Nope. I think it will cause the issue too. Also might be something to do with the game designed for consoles where they wouldnt reach over 60 FPS anywhere.
---
Yeah, hang on while they click their heels and say the magic phrase.
---
I dropped or accidentally sold my Vampire, Swing Speed, +1 str combat knife and was pretty sad about it yesterday. I liked that knife.
---
It was much too late when I realized it was gone.
---
Yeah weight reduction weapons/armor apply only to the base weight/"Standard" mods. The  mods take up their full normal weight. On the plus side, Lite and Ultra-lite build 90% weight reduction armor weighs 0.
---
Yeah til time starts getting close and all your team mates ninja-vanish and leave your ass high and dry. 
---
Well seems like my attempt at some build crafting discussion fizzled out faster than a Gatling Plasma :| 
---
PRESTIGE~ I love it
---
Yes they do. 
---
I have multiple lowbies that generate better atom  points then my main.
---
I don’t really care if you believe me.
---
The crabs face is armored and the best/only way to hurt him is to enter the house (filled with mirelurks hitching a ride) and shoot him from the inside.
---
Indeed, accidentally shot a players base shooting at a ghoul near it with a TSE shotty.  Said screw it and went base bashing till about 1200 caps, players were absolutely coming after me and all of them ate it except for 1.  
---
The last guy I saw had a harpoon gun, instead of spamming his personal space (getting up in his face so he couldn't shoot me and would be force to switch to a more practical weapon) I figured I'd give him some fun.  I ran around in the far distance from him where I could barely still see him, and he managed to pick me off running with a sweet 1-shot.  Those guns for me do like 2000 damage so no way I was gonna tank that lol.  
---
It's always a drag to get a wanted level, so when I do, to make it funner for me as a cat and mouse thing I go big with getting a big bounty, and conversely the person that takes me down also gets a hefty paycheck.  So it makes the drag into an actually fun event for me and the claimer of the bounty, but shitty for the victims of what needs to be done to jack up the wanted level to make players want to come hunt you....  **c'est la vie**
---
It doesn't actually shoot all of it. Just makes it disappear.
---
I want to try other outfits but I can’t bear to take off my spacesuit. 
---
Why can't we scrap legendaries? With the 200 cap trader limit, it makes it hard to get rid of stuff, and if I'm overencumbered, which I always am, it takes a lengthy amount of time to go to and from a trader.
---
It’s not about the tools.  Those you whip out right away.  You have to spend 5minutes to remember how to pick a lock (equip the cards).  System is stupid, should be a passive talent - same with repair/home defense/crafting.
---
Yeh, very happy with that.
---
It’ll solve the duplication issue.
---
But they have to make the vendors have set items.
---
I mean these are just the principles of any mmo
---
Youtubers are trying to villanize Bethesda for getting rid of cheaters ruining the game for us 🤔
---
Give the caps to some low levels if it works, I'm on PS4.
---
TLDR is nerfing TS to 25% dmg boost, no more TS drops, no more mod scrapping! 
---
No, it wasn't. They have their reasons and those who cheat to access it are rightfully getting banned.
---
Rad Shield?
---
On my ps4 any button used, d pad included resets it to 25,000 thanks though
---
I have the same issue all over the place indoors, and it gets rather frustrating without having any idea as to what's causing it to happen.
---
IIRC, the legendary effect was +10% damage.
---
The truth is either you are in market for TSEs or you are not, every community creates their own language and online gaming is no different, as you progress in the game and participate in game-related terms the language becomes obvious. PSA was kinda new to me but after reading few posts that described how to spare yourself a fuckup it became clear it means post scriptum advice ;)
---
Ok then I'll wait in a corner for this change I guess. Would make the swapping/leveling up smooth
---
Yeah my friend and I preordered this game and his character was broken so he hasn’t  played in a long time I think. Only reason I didn’t even try and get a refund
---
It just works. That being said, they should just remove Bobbleheads cause they suck.
---
Man I got a vampires swing speed knife aswell lol, its my fav weapon right after my boxing glove! Really feel you about that one wow dang!! :((
---
Hey, thank you so much for your details suggestions and explanations, really appreciate it! =) 
---
I tried to play around with your ideas to get the roof to snap, but I think as my camp setup was kinda complicated, so in the end, I still couldn't get it to work. 
---
The problems here were: 
---
1. I wanted to create a multi-tiered roof setup, where the roofs offsetting each other in height. That's why you see the angled roof at the far end was higher than the one I was trying to snap. 
---
2. The foundation right below the problematic roof has to be lower, in order to create enough space for people to walk through - therefore I couldn't put half walls right on it for the problematic roof to snap to, that will make that roof way lower than what I want it to be. 
---
So the only solution is if the problematic roof could snap directly on the roof to the right. Well, it could snap, but just the wrong direction..as you can see in the picture ='( ...I really have no idea how I got it to work the first time, I remember I managed to let it snap quite effortlessly and not like this time lol
---
Thanks again for your help! I eventually went for a different approach to create the offsetting roof set up and I'm liking the new design now =)
---
My armor regens me when not in combat. I have the maxxed cannibal perk. I make 2x the chems with the chemist perk. I make SO MANY stimpacks and try to use as few as possible because i play tank and because my husband is constantly at 0 stimpacks somehow.
---
Yeah - I wonder if they mean just TS, or TSE, or both.
---
Yes. Ive been getting an infinite loading screen and ive never had that before
---
Price of TS skyrocket?
---
Haha!  I got ya.  Disregard if you already know this: your monitor refresh rate effectively limits your frame rates, so having a monitor that has a higher refresh rate allows you graphics card to display more frames, if it can.  Most monitors run at 60hertz.  When you get one that runs at 120,144,or 240 it's a huge difference.  
---
Redrum written in building blocks are all around. I've seen it at least 10 different places.
---
Lolz 
---
I think folks are so paranoid now that when I highbie sends love, lowbies don’t know how to process.

It doesn't increase

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a77cs6/psa_proof_that_camp_budget_does_not_change_with
---
Same =D! I could totally just build camps all day hahah
---
why no ask for a fix to this broken interaction instead, not everyone comes in to reddit. 
---
Yup. Had some trouble getting started last night. Needs fixin’, and fast.
---
I would save it for awhile. You never know what future patches could bring. The next FotM build could be an all energy weapon build and ballistic could be nerfed so bad they are unusable
---
not everyone is a native speaker yknow
---
Damn, I just promised my only TS weapon to my friend and now I would like to keep it as a relic.
---
HOLY SHIT That's why I'm overencumbered 
---
I loved the Riot Gear
---
Finished Belly of the Beast last night and in the last section of the tunnels the SBs were flying through the walls and strafing his deep in the tunnel. Like the rock didn't even exist. Contemplated just wearing them down but figured it probably wasn't worth the ammo and I'd level quicker just going top side and blasted scorched.
---
Give that OP some gold, out of caps irl
---
The community of his game is very difficult. Especially sometimes on this subreddit and especially in game 
---
Any more tips senpei?
---
i love it when people visit my camps. i don't even care if they take my water.
---
i work hard on my camps, EVERYONE COME BASK IN THE GLORY
---
*APPRECIATE THEM*
---
"the damage bonus for Two Shot legendary modded weapons has been reduced  to +25% damage, and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world."
---
Even as it decreases the damage, this will make two-shot weapons into legacy items, which is cool (for those who have them). I think focusing on the two-shot aspect rather than the explosive side sort of misses the point, though. After all, the shotguns aren't so powerful because they get one more pellet.
---
what was the damage boost? 100%?
---
The assaultron head is a horrible gun. Gets rid of all of your ammo at a single shot.
---
Great tip. Thanks. I think I have 40+.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure 
---
PLEASE let them stablize the servers first
---
&gt;"cautiously" 
---
sadly i treat "idiotic cockgobbler" PVPers as guilty until proven otherwise now. They always have top tier weapons and gear, fat stacks of ammo, or are using some other exploit
---
Really? Okay, that just sucks.
---
It's also the middle of the workday so a lot of people aren't on reddit.
---
Same.. I only use stimpacks when I'm in danger, which means I always go for the regular stimpack, since it has a dedicated key.   
---
As a matter of fact, all diluted meds are vendor trash for me (and radx in general, but that's because I only use Radshield).  
---
I tried using them in the beginning, but I would inevitably run out and have to resort to the regular ones. Just decided to cut out the hassle. 
---
Ahahahaha
---
The problem with this is, a lot of enemies spawn based on the level of player that entered the map cell. If you start encouraging high level players to go back to the start again then all the players that are going through for their first time will be plagued with all these super high level enemies .
---
OH yeah I was thinking of the assaultron
---
What's the phrase? "locking the stable door after the horse is stolen"? It's out. It's OP. And by removing it from any potential loot drops, you're just screwing over the newer / lower-level players. What are you going to do, implement more bugs that forces players to drop or lose their current TSEs?
---
Nerf the damage output, sure. But removing it from any future loot isn't the best answer they could have come up with IMO.
---
I thought TSE weapons are worth alot
---
If that new PvP mode isn't optional, then my time in Appalachia might see a significant reduction. 
---
Yeah, I also thought that it's weird that they focus on TS, because explosive is more game breaking in my experience.
---
Fun fact - nuking Fort Defiance turns all the ghouls inside into glowing ones. Not a ton of legendaries, though. 
---
I usually just claim the workshop, then when the defend it event pops up I leave the area and ignore it. After a while a new event to reclaim the workshop comes along. Only then do I worry about building anything.
---
wow was basically inventing the genre, and even to this day endgame stuff gets stale after a while
---
wow had (like) 20+ zones and quite a few dungeons, we got less than 10 proper questlines and 1 dungeon (silo? have not done one but i would like to think its difficult) and 1 bossfight and thats it.
---
i have read on this sub so many awesome ideas that make the game seem so much more barebones. it makes me sad to start looking at other games, but serverhopping simulator or whitespring roaming makes vault boy wanna nuke himself
---
The higher the level, the lower the ROI, sure.  However, a level 21 taking a workshop for plans is still worth it.
---
It has the weight of 4 bobby pins, AMAZING!
---
Well, this is from the same folks who in the last patch stated there were changes to 'anti-ballistic fiber' (since corrected).
---
It feels to me that that standing in front and emptying a .50 cal right into her face when she's on the ground does even more DPS than whacking her with a super sledge but I could be wrong. I think something about headshot damage on the queen is a little buggy and you do more than you should. 
---
You're blowing smoke out of your ass dude. You specifically wave your right to a class action when you hit agree on the TOS. They also reserve the right to terminate your account at their own discretion. As outlined in the TOS..
---
You can find a mod for ts? or are they referring to guns with thsr effect won't drop 
---
Ahh man.  I was doing this for somebody last night.  I made the same gun with the same mods 4 times.
---
Well, this is the third time this has been posted in the last 15 minutes. What's the record?
---
Raiders, am I right?
---
It sounds like this would be something special you have to join into, but I agree, I really hope it's optional since the PVP is already a big mess.
---
I've moved my camp and had my camp budget max out because it duplicated tonnes of stuff.
---
Ive also relogged and had phantom wires that use budget restore the budget they were taking.
---
Its dead easy to test and the thread i linked did that.
---
#BRING OUT YER DEAD
---
I see your point, but honestly explosive itself is pretty overpowered. Especially on an automatic/fast firing weapon or a shotgun.
---
They aren't saying that TSE weapons cannot be looted anymore. They are saying you will no longer find the **MOD** for TSE anymore.
---
This is the main reason i posted, It's frustrating but i don't really use energy weapons that much.
---
'Ts mod will no longer drop' 
---
Does this mean that there will be no more weapons with that mod dropping, or the mod as a standalone? I was not aware that you could get two shot as a mod and then apply it to a weapon? 
---
High level servers could fix that. Maybe level 75 (76?) and above start playing in their own servers unless specifically joining a regular server
---
I had a quad ammo one, the irony
---
Yeah but they are rare. I’ve got grape and berry learned, I think. Definitely from the enclave bunker. 
---
I think most of us crossed that bridge long ago. Is there a way to make an alt and trade it to a main or does it count as a quest item?
---
Tip: Drop One Bullet Before dropping anything else to know for sure your gonna drop what you want
---
See stuff like that is super helpful. I paid so much attention to playing FO76 like normal fallout that I neglected learning the cards and I’m only really starting to pay attention to how they work. 
---
Well considering it’s not possible to be in pvp below level 5 or even take damage from players...this seems like a stretch
---
Same here
---
That's nuts I'm gona have to test it out this morning. I've ignored so many enemies bodies just because my turret killed them lol 
---
Yepper, I checked before posting and it hadn't updated yet, oh well it's still an update!
---
I think the latter.
---
Bad luck i guess, i havent been murdered much
---
Well I’m 100% positive the slider changes when selecting quantities of items or caps being changed wasn’t included in the patch notes whatsoever.
---
I play with no armour at all. There’s no penalty for dying so why bother?
---
In fact the only penalty in the game at all is repairing and replenishing your resources. So, I never heal or wear armour, and rarely even use guns against mobs. Just die, respawn nearby for free and your progress is saved. 
---
Fighting scorchbeasts is another matter entirely. Power armour is basically the only way you can win a solo encounter against one of those, since there’s no strategy or careful planning that matters. Just a mindless DPS race. 
---
If you give 5 mins i'll post the screenshots.  Had to do a double take when I saw the recipe in there.
---
god I love the perk loadout mod. Without that I just didn't go around picking locks
---
I was kinda ging that direction too. 
---
Chameleon armor is great though. I have 1 piece of chameleon and 1 piece of shrouded wooden that breaks after 3 or 4 hits. 
---
You re a legend mate
---
Where can you find that mod? It's a legendary effect, no?
---
You're not going to believe a common thing? Lol, okay cowboy. I've spent well over 20 hours server hopping for x-01 mods. I was about 20 hours for just 1 toon and I have 5. Not all of them took that long, but between them I've got maybe 30-40 hours of server hopping for mods.
---
You're right. And someone will get needed/useful info.
---
I apologize if you thought I was attacking you. This certainly isn't the most annoying repost ever, it's just a common issue with Reddit.
---
Uh-huh. Just be patient and you will see all of those real soon
---
You need a legendary flamer to go with that so you can ask "DO YOU WANT THAT PAN-SEARED?"
---
Awww
---
I would love a veteran ncr ranger outfit or something similar to one. 
---
There is no point they’re just jerks, store all junk and it’s not a big deal, besides armor getting damaged. Or you can jump servers to avoid players like that. 
---
YES, it could act like the aid tab so it only shows the chems inside your stash and nothing else in that single box.
---
I'm not a PVP guy myself too, I love the game but I have to agree with you. 
---
Hopefully with the TS prefix going away they'll be able to find when someone dupes a TSE easier lol
---
Doesn’t matter. If thousands of people sue Bethesda, Bethesda will at the very least have to pay a fortune in legal fees. At least. TOS and rules don’t mean shit if you piss off enough people. The people ultimately rule. For example if the us government ever becomes tyrannical, the people will kill them all and a new one will take its place.
---
Right I'm so so confused rn 
---
Well shit I guess this post just proves you right.
---
Yeah, no shit. It is a personal problem. All of these problems are personal problems dumbass. That's the whole idea behind QoL changes dipshit.
---
Im also seeing people online who haven't played since BETA. Or im pretty sure havent played at all
---
They totally can be cause it happened, it might not supposed to but it did. I’m going to see if my recording goes back far enough to get a screen grab. 
---
No big deal to me either way. I usually pre-plan  my trip down there if I want to off load stuff. Maybe I'm in the minority, but don't most of you have all of the available amenities at your camps that the bunker offers? Minus the vendors of course. I know I do + added stuff that they don't have. I mean if I'm planning to do a big upgrade to my PA, or craft something I do it at my base 9/10. Unless I need some food asap on the road or something. Don't really get the absolute "NEED" for it. . . But I will say it is kind of pointless to have all of those work stations there and no box to pull from. Although if traveling to your camp and/or the resort are too much of a hassle for you, I think the problem lies in the mirror, lol. Just saying.
---
I saw a post with detailed map of deposits, and thought to myself, "Would be nice if this were searchable."  So, I started gathering info on making my own interactive map, and stumped across yours.  You beat me to it.  :D  Ty for the interactive map.  Very useful.
---
 Not crashing at all for me. Try rebuilding your database 
---
Just drop all of your ammo on the ground and pick it up again 
---
Exactly this \^
---
After beating SBQ  "Dinner... is served"
---
How about not popping a ton of bobbleheads and insta-gibbing her before everyone shows up?
---
Honestly, it would be amazing if they up-leveled the "dungeons" like WoW does. Like a certain vault has a recommended level and number of people but there is a "heroic" or whatever version that is for higher levels. It gives low levels a place to farm some low level gear.  For instance:
---
Vault 1 Regular level 20-25, Heroic 70-75
---
Vault 2 35-40, Heroic 85-90
---
Vault 3 45-50, Heroic 95-100
---
Vault 4 100+, 4 man teams recommended. Actually make it hard, immune to certain damages, technical aspects, like if you fail to do something aside from laying waste to everything you can't survive. Having to power up generators to shock the boss before he rages and basically wipes party, closing off breaches in the Vault walls to prevent the constant flow of mobs. I dunno, something where your not just walking through there with a TSE and blowing everything away.
---
Basically add 50 levels to the "base" difficulty. Maybe base the regular difficulty off the upper end of the recommended level for that area. I hit a stall in the 20s I think so a dungeon around that area would be great.
---
To me yes it's buggy yes exploiters yes to all the above but it's Bethesda I expected this I've played their games for a looooooong time I wasn't even gonna get it for the first 6 mths but it was gifted to me so I played it and it's not game breaking everything that has been happening happens in Dang near every game it seems nowadays so why should I hate on it and all these people saying their is blind optimism or herd following are literally going the same IE like I heard someone on YouTube say its horrid so imma just say it too but I won't play it or I can get a bunch of likes or views by trashing the game 
---
I expect in a few months it will be better long as people stop worrying about who's right or wrong and has an open mind play it or don't really doesn't matter to me but I'm not gonna be on one side or the other I just want better stuff in the game so I have more to do lol 
---
Yes someone made a post saying that it happened to a friend. Definitely "something"
---
I got so excited when I saw a two shot combat shotgun drop from a three star ghoul. Then I realized it was only one star, so no additional effects. Two shot is still decent, but I expected more.
---
I agree that something needs to be done with that, but think about all of the bugs / timing delays that are in the game right now. If you remove that restriction, there are going to be a LOT of people complaining about scrapping their equipped gear.
---
two shot masssssssive nerf unreal! Now lets see some overall weapon balance. 
---
Mod scrapping - eh a modder beat ya to it Beth but thanks lads i guess lol.
---
PvP servers  unreal and i hope that means the normal ones stop camp damage and caps slap damage. So all the griefers and a holes can go pvp their hearts out among one another.
---
Yes, it is and I think it's weird that they chose to nerf/remove TS?
---
It still gives a sense of progression though, which kept people coming back for more. It did with me lol
---
I think it’s only annoying if the scorchbeast queen is being fought, or if you use explosive guns. But I’m not an expert either 
---
Hey, if that works for you and the people you meet, it's fine with me. 
---
I'm almost always short on some kind of scrap because it's not unusual for me to help people upgrade things for free, and I regularly craft some decent armor and a decent gun for low level players. 
---
I'm also set in pacifist mode, so someone showing up and trashing my place would give me some heartburn. 
---
keep it even tho it eats all your ammo in few weeks time you'll have a gun nobody else can get as tse weapons will no longer drop at this point it's a relic from the golden days 
---
I logged in and they personally mailed 50 gold bars to my house.
---
Am I the only one who thought these weren’t a problem? Or were they and I missed some major discussion here? I thought it was the explosive guns that are way to powerful, especially against mobs. 
---
RIP my two shot handmade and my two shot lever action :(  
---
Fight how you can, there is no real etiquette other than not being an ass and either intentionally killing other players or actively leaving them to die to take their junk. If you’re using Molotov’s then set yourself to passive mode, otherwise it’s far to easy for someone to force pvp on you or accidentally start pvp in a clustered area. 
---
At whitesprings (assuming I remember correctly) you can take potshots at scorched and then sprint towards the guard robots.
---
Just don't accidently shoot the robots. You will not win that.
---
Sad/happy. Farming white springs during a Nuke maybe a little easier? Happy because I haven't pvped since beta
---
I claim workshops for these reasons:
---
* Free fast travel point. 
---
* Get new plans
---
* Resources (lead, steel, nuclear material, junk, acid)
---
Some workshops aren't all that useful, others are better. There are some I never bother claiming. 
---
I suppose the sense might be that the recent fireproof perk card change makes it possible for players to negate some of that explosive damage, so there is already a "fix" on the player side of things that they say they are focusing on here (how effective this is with other exploits in place, well, that's another matter). However, explosive shotguns will continue to wreck swarms of enemies, which is what I see as many complaints about as people being one-shot killed.
---
So the process of dropping items is actually a “process “? Could be that you pick all items to drop, close Pip Boy and drop just happens
---
Have pacifist mode on or you're gonna have a bad time. Make sure your teammates have pacifist mode or you all will have a bad time. I had a nasty surprise when guiding some newer players when one got in a grief off with a 100+ lvl player. 
---
Don't get in people's way. Bring a gun capable of tagging enemies quickly. Don't expect people to bail you out. Stash any junk you don't want to lose when you likely die.
---
Thank you so much! I really appreciate it
---
All you need is unyielding gear, adrenal reaction, and a bloodied weapon to break that barrier. Take that vs some sort of TSE or something. You can make a decent bloodied build by level 60, maybe even feasible by level 50. Getting a TSE by trade isn't necessarily hard, but if they're charging you market price that could take until level 80. There's nothing special about 50 cal headshots. Any headshot from any weapon will do higher damage. This is especially true with a min-max build.
---
Totally agree. Not to turn Fallout into a WoW with guns, but there are very general ideas they could use since they already know it’s a solid concept. 
---
Here is it https://i.imgur.com/8lSoyFe.jpg
---
Well the place I'm thinking of is not called fort defiance I thought. Was there a painted tricycle with it?
---
Sounds like pulling the sqb out of the nuke zone for a more casual kill isn't intended.
---
Makes sense though. The sqb shouldn't just be a tanky sb.
---
The removal of PvP restrictions had better be on different servers.  Otherwise, my camp (which is actually a large house with all the comforts of home) is going back into "hobo" mode.
---
I would agree with you if it fixed the problem, but I'm still loading in with things half loaded in, items I can't interact with, and can see through walls/the floor.
---
On my end at least, I'm seeing no reason for it since everything loads in just like before the patch, just with the extra load screens.
---
Oof they’re patching tse next week
---
&gt; All rise
---
Oh, I had not even considered the All Rise reward.  Will definitely save that for post 50.  
---
I like the idea of throwing more points into END for solar power for both damage and better health thresholds while staying at 20% or less; not sure what to swap it with after 6 PM though.  
---
https://youtu.be/0OT_0xAfBnw
---
I remember telling someone on here that they should either remove 2 shot or explosve and they definitely listened
---
So no communication on new content or when it will be as people are running out of stuff to do. All they say is "oh now you wont scrap your mods, and were nerfing the most powerful guns people use so not everything is a bullet sponge"  
---
Its getting hard to not agree with the anti-beth hate at this point.
---
I'm surprised there isn't a "Nuka Cola Package" for the CAMP I would totally buy!
---
There are no two-shot mods. When they say it can't be looted, they have to mean they will no longer drop, because that's the only way to find them.
---
So the people that have two shot weapons will keep them but you can’t ever get a weapon rolled with two shot?
---
That essay had too many syllables. Aplogoize!!!
---
so from now no one can get twoshots anymore and only existing ones will stay while nerfed to only 25% dmg bonus   
---
I understand the nerf, I dont understand why you can no longer get two shots as loot
---
I was upset about this nerf and then i realized why they did it.  This essentially destroyed the 2shot duping market.  Anti and Furious legendary actually might be more viable now.
---
Awesome thanks a lot ! So that s in mount blair in the huge excavator thingy right ?
---
Very true
---
Does your Fallout 4 Giddyup Buttercup collecting ass shoot flames, too?
---
A little fun I had trying to get the kill players trophy https://youtu.be/0OT_0xAfBnw
---
literally all it says is theyre nerfing the best guns, and making it so you dont scrap your mods.  
---
Ridiculous. No news on new content.
---
I hope it works like an Oppressor MK 2 and we finally get a vehicle
---
&gt; You may recall late last year we mentioned we’re working on a new way of playing the game that removed PvP restrictions. While we’re still doing some tweaking and adding, we thought we’d give you a little more info to go on. Think it of it like playing the game you’re playing right now, but with no PvP rules. 
---
I hope we get the opposite as well. Since I got little to no interest in PVP.
---
Nah and I have twisted muscles so I can basically kill an entire city block by jumping to not kms 
---
I would assume that level is part of the to-hit and damage calculations such that leveling keeps adding to combat effectiveness even after you've made on stuff.
---
If like special to get to 70 (all traits at ten) as in fo4. Which I guess would be one point per level till sixty, with your choice of allocation in this system.
---
Caveat emptor. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Rip my two shot powder pistol
---
i have 15 and would put more there if i could, just because of the perks.
---
currently using gunsmith, power user, power patcher, stabilized, and scrapper.
---
Those rads only kill some builds becouse without pa/hazmat you die there no mater your radrezist. And with them you take rad sponge and sbq become buggy tanky sb. 
---
Was the damage buffed? All I saw was the reload animation patch and that wouldn't effect killing enemies.
---
service entrance is still outside.   and even with the more reliable loading you've still got a REALLY high chance of being microwaved before you can get inside.
---
You’re a true gentleman! I thought about nerfing it, but I was just fed up with it
---
I think that this isn't a bad thing. Especially until they figure out a way to stop the doopers. 
---
you should probably not revive people and discourage others from asking to be revived. If you store your junk before and choose death as soon as you're downed, you'll get back into the fight faster 9 times out of 10. 
---
&gt; Think it of it like playing the game you’re playing right now, but with no PvP rules. We want to introduce significantly more tension, drama, and consequences with every encounter with another human player. 
---
Finally something that should been inside the game from the beginning. 
---
They’re somewhat rare for me. It seems I’ve only gotten about three including my legendary 
---
4 to 5 turrets and a machete. Then I go about my business.
---
The hero we need
---
I would rather them keep adding additional content. Which I assume we will get once they are done getting the game to the state it should have always been in anyway.
---
It could be because it's easier for them to just remove TS weapons than to address the bugs associated with them (e.g., not working in VATS). 
---
Ah well, okay. Thankfully I held onto my 2* furious lever action.
---
Got the recipe in a silo
---
I thought we were an autonomous collective!
---
I've been hoping for a change to the TSE weapons and them being in game. 
---
It just became to much of a focus in the game, and people were to spastic about it.
---
I hope that PvP isn't changed into what it is in most games. No rules or regulations, just higher level players ganking lower level players because there's no chance to fight back.
---
It seems like a stretch, because it is a stretch.
---
Exactly, it's the sense of growth and rewards that will keep people coming back, or even exclusive cosmetics or gear. I think we all like to show off at least a little :-)
---
Find this ugly ass wallpaper design in the resort, and you'll find the secret entrance if you look hard enough.  http://www.notpurfect.com/travel/nuke/green/green14.jpe
---
The backlash would be worse if they pushed content instead of fixing bugs.
---
Ppl don't buy a buggy game.

Not at all, just join a group and tag enemies is going to be your best bet.  Lots of low levels come but it can get rough quickly when you have 10 glowing ghouls chasing you. Best place is near the golf course country club there is a raised flower bed to the left of the front door which you can jump on top of most ghouls can’t get to you, a few make it up. Bring something like a Tesla or sub machine gun so you can tag more than one enemy. 
---
Low levels are most welcome but you may not survive long and drop your junk. Best to also get familiar with the area during the day.  You might be better off in PA,  make sure you have loads of radaway if you do, pa gives you can extra in strength but start with the hazmat suit and see how you do.
---
Look for groups of people then you should be fine else you may be surprised with loads of ghouls chasing you.
---
Make sure you have pacifist mode on so you don’t accidentally sheikh someone and start Pvp 
---
Good to hear.
---
lol i'm already over encumbered man.
---
Maybe don't grind Whitespring's so much?
---
Correct. And instead of 100% damage bonus its 25%
---
Rose _IS_ an NPC.
---
Aren't these two items from the January 10 patch notes germane to the trade stealing issue?  It never happened to me personally, but these did make me think Bethesda had found a problem.
---
"Trade: Fixed an issue where players could view another player’s inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.
---
Trade: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade."
---
I use Gorge for black titanium. I f I get it at the start of the session, I can usually gather a nice chunk.
---
Hmm I like this idea, i'll start planning a build.
---
Removing two shot????? Lol that's stupid. Explosive is the biggest part. 
---
I'm jealous!
---
So it's been my experience that if you pick up a ready made mainframe core (hell I call them star cores 'cuz Nuka World) it interferes with repairing the damaged ones. IF I pick up a ready made one from the ground, THEN I cannot repair the 15 damaged ones at one go and replace at one go. IF I do NOT pick up a ready made star core before I take the damaged ones off THEN I can repair and replace all 15 in one go. Thanks to my pal J3di for figuring that out
---
Well, it's probably not car doors since those will require more torsional torque to open than either the paper clip or bobby pin can deal with, lets stick structures, such as little old ladies locking themselves out of houses with pies baking in the oven. They always offer him a piece for a job well done. 
---
YES please :)
---
I'd love to see more different nuke zones have different bosses with different rewards.
---
Last night I saw someone nuke Morgantown.........and I didn't even bother going there.  The only thing worthwhile there is flux.  No boss creature, no legendary enemies in the mobs.  Worthless.  I was actually mad that someone wasted a perfectly good nuke.
---
This sub circle jerks about dupers way too much and talks about the game way too little. This is a tangent I'm not interested in going down. 
---
Not at all brother, I got what you were saying which is why I just shared that I tried to make sure I wasn't spamming up the community with extra posts by checking first.  It's all good brother, I am pretty excited that they are looking for our feedback on events!
---
I got the ban hammer at 230pm on Tuesday. Still no response from Bethesda to my email 
---
Yeah, it would be awesome (and way OP) to fire once with 100x damage output though!
---
Dumbest thing ever xd
---
I remember _my_ first 10 hours with this game. Dont worry, once you get far enough in the main quest line, it explains all of it rather nicely.
---
Fine here on pc
---
Yeah I'll use it to revive in other places like whitesprings then
---
I have quite a bit of black titanium, I don't think I've ever used any. 
---
If you dump all regular and diluted stims, that key will use super stims
---
This is Mr. Bumpus, you'll be hearing from my lawyer for your trespassing and defaming my character in public.
---
Biting Bumpus gets you bit back!
---
Totally.  That was actually my own strategy for a while when I was lower level and desperate for plans; just claim ownership and leave.  Still, that was me just taking advantage of a game mechanic in a way the devs probably didn't intend.  It would have been nice to actually stick around and collect resources. What's more, it's not as easy to grind for resources lower level, and having awesome plans that I couldn't afford to build isn't much better. 
---
They were only scary to me when I was low level and didn’t have the defense/damage output to take them on. Now, they’re just an annoyance unless I directly seek them out.
---
Um, cap is some point where it get captured? So some maximum. Like bottlecaps have cap at 25k and you cant get more. Same is with radrezist from trapper/robot armor parts and you get 7rads per sec wearing them.
---
They definitely need high level servers where the low level regions are scaled up and the high level regions are even deadlier but with great rewards
---
You still get to keep them, and they'll still be good. And TS weapons will become legacy items, and they will become more and more rare as time goes on. (Provided duping gets fixed for good)
---
I want the xp.
---
I would like to see an option where you choose when you create a character  if you want to join a Rust style PVP server or the normal style servers.  Also make the buildings MUCH more durable, similar to Rust again, so that it's actually work to get at someones goodies.
---
Please don’t forget about the Tesla rifle ! 
---
I'd settle for a camp revenge system as a mutually assured destruction anti-trolling mechanism. When someone or a team of someones are red for you due to leveling your base it highlights their camp location that you can travel to with a couple saved fatman nukes to launch from a safe distance of their turrets.
---
It wouldn't be a problem that they stack if it weren't for people duping them.
---
Super weird to just completely remove TS drop completely unless they're using that as a function to ban dupers. Pretty knee jerk.
---
Completely agree, if the balance was the goal I'm not sure why they went with nerfing/removing TS over E.
---
Ooh boy, we cut it close last night. It was probably the 5th or 6th time I had engaged her. All the previous runs were super smooth, so I was feeling cocky about her being easy. 
---
I was one of the first 2-4 people engaged on the queen and we did nearly nothing to her for the first 15 minutes. Took more than 10 minutes just to get her to regenerate. I found the biggest problem is she would not land. Part of the reason (I think) is someone set up a rocket turret base in the middle of an otherwise open field. Luckily, more people poured in later, including someone doing a nice job with a Cryolator. Finished with less than 3 minutes on the clock.
---
I am sure I partially contributed to the issue as two of my miniguns broke early on and I had to move to melee, but it was also very clear that most (including me) were waiting for her to land. So there is such a thing as too many melee targets, especially when people may be causing pathing issues preventing her from landing.
---
I also lol'ed mid fight when I saw someone go down, immediately respawn and the hyenas all pounced on that loot bag. Why wouldn't you wait even 10 seconds for someone to get you up?
---
Alright thanks! I’m actually okay with the change because I use a TSE pump and It just made the game too easy to one shot things. Happy to see how the change will effect the weapon 
---
Drop your regular stims, it'll use supers then. (make sure you don't have diluted either) 
---
I've never seen the mod itself in the wild.   
---
I do not think the people writing the blogs / updates are fully up to speed with in-game nomenclature.  
---
But then again, nobody seems to be on the same page with nomenclature (e.g. plans such as "revolver" and other nomenclature mismatches).
---
I regret I have but one upvote to give.
---
Wtf? Seriously? 
---
Yeah which is pretty dope tbh turns the guns into relics 
---
Can the American flag be covered with Communist propaganda? Asking for a pengyou...
---
Yikes, sounds like id need to use melee with chems and alcohol. 
---
does this mean after the patch the only two shots will be the ones prior to the patch? Would there be other ways to get one??
---
Mhm. Check Inside the Vault
---
Exactly 
---
Kind of like this idea but it doesn't help those who dont want to be part of pvp. 
---
Do the math and compare a reduction of the two shot bonus and a reduction of the explosive bonus on a tse weapon. Then come back and reevaluate your post.
---
I honestly never used two shot very much in fo4 cause I preferred accuracy over damage but now that multiple legendaries can apply at once it is pretty nice to have double effects.
---
The main reason Two Shot is considered a problem seems to be the pvp component; people are getting deleted through the slap damage by TSE shotguns and such. I can understand why that is something that needs fixing, but I've never liked PvE stuff getting nerfed to try and balance PvP. It's especially bad when PvP is deliberately such a limited part of the game.
---
They boosted explosion resistance via perks with the latest patch so I'm ok with the 2 shot nerf. The event fix would be nice as well. They just need to add a timer.
---
The way they worded makes it seem like you'll have to opt in. They called it a new "mode". 
---
Yeah I know what a cap is guy. I don’t know what the cap is for rad resist
---
A +25% damage weapon seems desirable to me, even if it doesn't fire twice, so why doesn't it drop anymore? 
---
So two shot weapons will no longer drop? Is that really a good solution rather than find another way to balance things out? (Considering that the damage of two shots will be reduced anyway).
---
I'd be fine with two shot and explosive legendary effect could no longer be found on the same weapon.
---
I don't have a two shot weapon just so that's said, but I wouldn't mind finding one.
---
Totes, that 20% is helpful. Just have to get her on the ground.
---
YES. I'm on PC and afraid to do anything like take a workshop or launch a nuke because DISCONNECTS/CTDs are happening ALL THE TIME. My friends in my Enclave discord are dropping off too. It's just a dumpster fire at this point
---
I've been able to mitigate issues somewhat by:
---
Targeting torso or legs.
---
Charging shots only after switching to VATS, if I want to use a charged shot in VATS.
---
Not spamming uncharged shots (allowing the weapon to return to neutral position between shots.)
---
Swapping weapons, then swapping back.
---
Mod for hip fire accuracy over range or recoil.
---
Two-shot makes it worse.
---
Upvote for SoW
---
This happened to me as well, sometimes when building I place things and it teleports into the phantom zone using space without actually being there. 
---
I'll just hold on to my Two Shot Gatling for some time and wait till they turn more valuable...
---
Plus: bugs are being squashed.
---
Minus: no new content (more pvp? bring on actual content instead)
---
The +1 pellet is misleading as a two shot and one shot explosive shotgun 1 shots everything regardless.
---
Without explosive the damage diffetence of two shot is noticeable. 
---
Visually its 1 more pellet but damage per pellet is much higher.
---
I'm not really pro or anti anything. I'm interested in gameplay.
---
Ultimately everything is a net gain of nothing and a net loss of nothing regardless of how it plays out. A hand full of average mats and _maybe_ some caps are the only rewards and are also the only consequence. Nothing. :\
---
In scenarios like the end of Scorched Earth you can "bet" the quest rewarded flux and have some fun in impromptu PVP. Betting your flux on ganking another player's flux is a game with risk and reward.
---
I got better.
---
You know it's a good find when my 6 year old living deep inside your gaming conscience is jealous that you found it first.
---
Now on the list after I finish my power station tree house!
---
I have no problem with people visiting my camp. I enjoy the interaction. No locks on the door or water purifiers make yourself at home I always say. Only exception is my junk extractor is locked.
---
My 2 shot gatling gun doesnt has the explosive feature
---
Sounds good
---
I understand this, but I just see this as a weird aproach to TSE/TS/E problem. But I really don't know enough about games to tell Beth how to do their work.
---
They made them so Fusion gennys in the wild have a random chance to spawn vs. a guaranteed spawn. I was luckily (&amp; an inadvertent compulsion) grabbing any I saw (sans ones in chassis, so others who didn't have PA or cores could take the armor at least.)  
---
Now we are left to the world spawns &amp; snatching them from chassis for any guaranteed chance. I was really conditioned us to forget places I got them because of the bug that would recharge your current one on a world exit. I barely used any at that point.
---
That sounds great. If they make the mode like objective based where you are killing other factions then I'm totally down for that. But throwing in people who are trying to play pve and complete the story won't work because they will be targeted.
---
You "fell" into her crack.
---
Suuure, that's what they all say. 
---
But definitely no xp unless they tag. Some people report missed loot as well
---
&gt;There are only a handful of intractable NPCs, Rose among them
---
Before everyone freaks out about TS getting nerfed instead of explosive, consider that they already nerfed the crap out of explosive last patch with the addition of fireproof granting explosive resistance. 
---
With this update, it seems 2 ranks of fireproof and a torso mod make you almost completely immune to explosives. Without the TS damage bonus, a TSE gun will be borderline useless for killing players. 
---
tnt dome 2
---
They are reducing two shot by 25 not adding. This is so dumb. Now all my weapons are going to be much weaker. I don't even pvp. This wont even help any thing. Its the explosive attribute that needs to change.
---
Just move your camp, move it back, then place your stuff back down from the blueprint/stored menu. Your destroyed decon arch (and everything else) is repaired, materials free, for a few caps.
---
I have owned a two shot shotgun and an explosive shotgun. Believe me. The two shot is nothing compared to the explosive... jeeez. Could this be the worst typo ever?
---
They don't need to nerf explosive, since with Fireproof and a Dense or Padded armor piece you're practically explosive-proof. 
---
I agree with you. I love my two shot handmade and lever action and am a little disappointed they won’t be as powerful. I never wanted a TSE because it was too powerful, but I was content with my TS.
---
I have seen some people make a point that it could get rid of the duping market... but isn’t that only granted they fix duping? If people can still dupe, they will just dupe the next best gun after two shot explosive, right?
---
I think she's too easy. I've killed her about 10 times now, from just my husband and I to groups of 10+ high level players. It's boring. The fact people are struggling confuses me.
---
Im fine with them nerfing whatever but as long as they add more weapons, be it in new form, types or modifiers. Give us more variety. It is the spice of life, afterall otherwise everything is just stale bread in the end game
---
Yepper, I was more surprised by this than by the fact it was nerfed.  I am wondering why they didn't take a pass at explosive as well.
---
That defo makes more sense. Coz sometimes I don't get to tag an enemy and still get legendary drops
---
Cool, gotta go for being the One Punch Man!
---
Last night I found a rock you can build INSIDE (because one part of the rock doesn't render) and no one can see you from the outside. You can't put much in there but if you crouch while in there no one can find you if they don't know how to get in there
---
Yeah but it prevents one-trick ponies. More team work. Everyone can’t run with with 50 cals or lasers and walk through it. Maybe no immune but more than 50% resistance
---
Or make them procedurally generator so dungeons are random. I dunno is Bethesda can handle that lift but every dungeon being unique is fun
---
The worst part for me is when they shoot while they are flying away.
---
I hope they remove two  shot and explosive modifiers and make the game actual realistic survival themed.  Sorry but getting a 2 shot or tse gun makes the game a fucking comical enemy flattening laugh a thon, turns it into damn near whack a mole.  I dont like seeing 7 foot tall super mutants die in one fucking hit, talk about cheesy and not realistic at all.
---
I kid you not, I disconnected at least 8 times last night. It's been rough.
---
maybe they need to pull a ff14 to save the game, from november to here the best thing is still the stories from good player interaction
---
im mostly resentful of the company, having experience with ESO (zenimax having polished it over a couple years) i expected something less rough, considering they recognize their fame for buggy games.
---
&gt; they stated from the beginning 
---
oh so many things
---
My power fist shall once again rule the wasteland!
---
Two shot literally was double damage. If my revolver was two shot explosive rather than just explosive, it would do 600 damage, instead of 300 like it does. Now after the patch, the tse version of my revolver would probably not hit 400. Pretty good nerd in general. I don't like it very much but oh well. I'd rather have dupers inventory wiped.
---
Yeah I just posted about this as well. This decision makes absolutely no sense. They definitely shouldn't just DELETE two shot either. They should've moved it to the second modifier tier so that you could never get explosive and two shot on the same weapon.
---
Also nerf explosive ffs. Two shot giving a 2x damage buff (less if your weapon has a standard reciever) is still far less than the 3x damage buff Explosive gets. 
---
No damage buff, but in addition to the reload animation being fixed, you can cut off the reloading. Meaning, you can only reload an extra bullet or two, and then shoot. Very helpful if something does manage to survive my initial five shots, and it makes it quite a bit better than the hunting rifle now as a result. 
---
Ah! I now see what I did there &gt;blush&lt;
---
True tho... wasting perks points for only pvp is a little dumb. You could still quick swap the perk when entering pvp but i goddamn hate changing perks so I kinda share your opinion
---
Same I have ps4 and it's much worse after the patch. It's more "server not responding" than flat out disconnects. 
---
But I imagine it's dupers trying more franticly to dupe things cos they know it'll all end soon. 
---
Never will be in (well maibe unoctanium mod on the store anytime) otheerwise.. no
---
Also, well anyways I suppose you speak about the vanilla-standard NRC ranger armor, instead this unique version.
---
What I miss is the properly redone of the environmental suit...

Tip, ALWAYS stand on the bag you're dropping things into, that fixes this issue :)  They can't grab out of a bag you're standing on 95% of the time.
---
**Step 1 -** Drop a bag with some quick gifts that you know they'll most likely just snatch up (stimpacks, radaway, bobby pins).  That lets them know you're here to bring gifts, and they like the first gift :)
---
**Step 2 -** Drop another bag with other stuff (weapons, chems, etc).
---
**Step 3 -** Drop scrap last.  It takes the longest to figure out exactly how much scrap you want to drop (and it takes more time to individually drop 10-20 items).  But by this time, they've gotten stimpacks, radaway, weapons, and chems, and they'll be interested in what the last bag holds :)
---
I've found that this works a lot better than any other method I've used to give things to people.  Hope that helps!
---
People in this sub report all kinds of shit.
---
"OmGz! I did Tradez with a guy and he stole 3 TSE shotguns and 873,837,876. Bethesda replace or you obviously don't care!"
---
You yourself just made up a statistic...
---
So yeah. Bans for owning duped weapons? If there's no proof? Bullllllllllllshiiiiiiiit.
---
Does that means 2 shot weapons cant be found in loot anymore? 
---
"Colonel Summer" 
---
While the PvP rule changes are fine **for PvP players**,  what about us PvE players? 
---
I want a 'PvE only mode' where other players can exist on the map, but they cannot to \*any\* damage to me.
---
You should feel powerful end game, but not to the point where literally every enemy is an absolute joke besides like sbq.
---
The damage boost was originally 100% of the gun’s base damage (before perks)
---
We need more mechanics, too. Waves of adds, invulnerable portions, weak spots, activating mcguffins for extra damage, different boss phases, safe and danger zones, wipes, AoE, DPS, things that only The Boss can do that dont appear elsewhere in the game... 
---
New players cycle in and not everyone has top tier gear. I don't struggle, but I also know there's plenty of ways everyone can participate. 
---
I think I've gotten around six of them, and I'm level 53ish, so I'm not like swimming in them, haha. But I imagine it is a weapon that people stumble across in normal gameplay, whereas I haven't seen any of the explosive shot weaponry that's all the rage. 
---
They should've just put Two shot and explosive on the same effect tier. As it is explosive is broken powerful And has nothing to compete with it. 
---
&gt;Think it of it like playing the game you’re playing right now, but with no PvP rules. 
---
N U T
---
I worry that it will be the base game + pvp removed which gets away from the softcore survival I want.
---
But I do want some PVP events. I just don't want to deal with that in my main game world. 
---
Maybe we'll get both eventually.
---
That sounds really nice. So in a way you could shoot forever at a slightly reduced rate if you have speed demon.
---
Agreed. Biggest issue is the durability (especially the beam splitter which kills the gun in a few shots), Tank Killer not benefitting energy rifles, and the ash/goo pile bug where loot doesn't spawn if you kill an enemy from a distance. 
---
Plus the drop chance on any energy weapon is extremely small,  so even getting a good legendary one is a miracle in the first place. 
---
&gt; I was feeling cocky about her being easy.
---
This is the only thing I read
---
This will definitely help.  Motivation factor 110%.
---
Once the next patch hits yes. 
---
I'm finewith it tbh.
---
I have 2 guns, one tse, the other just explosive.
---
I need vat crits to one shot with the explosive, tse is point and shoot and nearly anything dies.
---
And i don't even run demo expert.
---
Vendor Bot Responder sells a clean version and helmet for around 1k caps. 
---
Now get going farming the only acceptable outfit upgrade available to you since Beta
---
It definitely does not seem like an effective solution to the problem in my eyes. There's also a question of how that 25 percent damage will apply. As it is, two shot adds another bullet that does full damage. In this case, will the extra bullet only cause 25 percent more damage? Will the gun now fire one round that causes 25 percent more damage? Will both shots have to hit to cause the 25 percent bonus damage?
---
That and I only have 2 endurance in my build xd Not gonna respec just because Bethesda doesnt understand their own game. They should listen to their community... they play the game...
---
I'd like to see a mod with popup damage on numbers.
---
Fair. I walked into that one.
---
That's a shit ton of Abraxo 
---
Soinds good to me
---
Wow... aren’t they aware that the explosive perk is the real Problem. Like wtf?! 
---
Yes I agree. But they didn't and now these weapons exist, so it's kinda bad looking to remove features IMO.
---
No, so they probably make it so that instead of saying two shot it would say +25% dmg
---
Thanks a lot! 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1pB3jkcq5unlYTB3TTURrZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-17-2019
---
Lmao, let the revolution begin then
---
Cant. Once you store a camp with more than 3 foundations the game pretty much refuses to put it back down all together and no one wants to spend an hour rebuilding their amp anytime a troll shows up.
---
I'd say Two Shot is still a bit too good in comparison with other prefix modifiers, but Explosive as a major modifier is just plain outright broken.  A single shot explosive weapon can outright replace grenade launchers and other explosive weapons or AOE type weapons like the Tesla Rifle.
---
I'd like to see minor tweaks for Two Shot balancing, but its Explosive that needs the kind of balance pass they're doing to Two Shot instead.
---
If you kill them at a distance, they become unlootable. If you're close to them, you can loot them.
---
Why are you buffing two shot? This is totally unfair to players that are legit and dont pvp. You need the buff for explosive. Or weapons with both. Thanks for nerfing my only good weapons. I just don't understand why I have to pay the price for shit other players are doing. This legit makes me not want to play. 
---
I think that the clipped into me when I was swinging at something else and that “consented” to pvp bit I’m not really sure it didn’t look like I had hit him on my screen and I didn’t think level 5 or below could consent to pvp like that so i wasn’t thinking about that at the time.  He was level 15 but was kitted our with leather and metal armor and the modded bat. 
---
Participating sure, but this post and others I see suggested it just reminds me of that really old Onyxia Wipe video hahaha. She's so... boring. There's no phases, no drama. The only pressure I ever feel is against the clock, which has since subsided since people are stacking Bobbleheads.
---
I really want a explosive shotgun with the perk that doubles damage when the target is at full health. Looks better than TS
---
So people will only ne able to buy it from other players. Or are there other ways to aquire it? 
---
Well with the news today, still keep it? lol.  Cant believe they are nerfing TS weapons.
---
Oh, no, I totally understand what you mean. I think it would be a great idea to add more combat mechanics that will prevent folks from blasting their way through with the popular TSE weapons. I remember a bug they fixed where certain enemies wouldn't take damage from high-DPS weapons or (in my case) enemies would simply regen health super quickly to the point of being unkillable. So I can see there being a vault with a severe reactor leak that's full of standard ghouls but also super-irradiated glowing ones that are so bathed in radiation that they heal faster than one can damage them making them essentially immune. You'd have to either cut off the radiation or lead them through some decon arcs you repair or perhaps even find some cryolators (provided in vault) to slow them down enough to complete your quest. 
---
I got over encumbered by that 
---
Agree that wasn't a good way of referencing it to regular players
---
Funny thing is melee with perks is powerful, vats with any gun is powerful.
---
Explosive with demo expert is powerful.
---
Tse with no perks at all is more powerful than all of those
---
There used to be more than 7 bobbleheads. Pretty sure it was around 30, but there was only 1 of each type.
---
WOOHOO FREE PUBLICITY
---
Jokes aside and in all honesty I hope he makes a video. I really just want to spark civil discussion about topics.
---
They're removing two shot completely from drop lists though. That's removing features. 
---
Also using tm , my character was melee first. Do know tm affects only vats accurasy or us it all accurasy?
---
So separate servers? Because right now, we are playing the full game. So that statement would lead me to believe it's note than just event based. Thoughts?
---
I'm wondering if it's a deliberate mechanism in the game (fast travling always porting to the exterior of the point) and working as intended. Meaning the reason they won't port you to the interior is because when your teammates (some that may not have access yet) fast travel to you that it also doesn't port you to the interior.
---
Got a few weeks to find another one ...
---
I found plans for orange mentats on a shelf in the garage/shack across street and down from the church in Helvetia this morning. 
---
I’ve got nothing off the corpse after whole process. Thought maybe I just dealt to few damage. For the event itself it was some reward though.
---
Only be able to buy from other players. Genius way to encourage even More duping. 
---
Remove it all and make the game actually realistic like it should have been from release.  As someone who has had access to all of these weapons, I gotta say that the minute I got guns like this and started easily one shotting every enemy in the game, I got painfully bored and ended up quitting very soon after.  It's kinda anti fun, it takes all threat out of a survival game unless you are dumb enough to kill yourself with explosive splash damage.
---
I think removing two shot from the game isn't a very good idea.
---
I can't help but think that the obsession with Two-Shot Explosive weapons is a symptomatic problem with how rare Legendaries are combined with how mediocre some can feel. Players want to feel powerful and TSE gives a very tangible benefit. It's like how in Destiny 2 the best perks were kill clip and rampage. All this is going to do is make people try to dupe TSE guns more before and after the patch. I think they should have nerfed it along with bringing up other legendary perks onto a more tangible level of power, making 3-stars always drop 3-star Legendaries, etc.
---
Removing it is a band-aid fix and I hope they put it back when there's a Legendary overhaul.
---
Manta Man
---
I had an explosive gatling plasma with explosive rounds that did no explosive damage and was unaffected by demolition expert. While it shows explosions on impact it did no actual explosive damage
---
We you do is you close the game and it works
---
But you cant melee swing anywhere near as fast or from range so that's the tradeoff there, explosives like rocket launchers and grenade launchers only have a few rounds then you need to reload so that is balanced, and I'll say it again because it's the absolute truth, but tse, both two shot and explosive need to be trimmed from the entire game.  Those mods in a multiplayer survival game are just cancer and anti fun.
---
Yes! Instigating is a hilarious modifier.
---
I have a lvl 35 bat with it and + power attack. I'm not even melee and that thing one shots alot of stuff
---
That's the way I read it which is very odd for an online game. Legacy items or effects can cause a lot of issues and drama down the line. 
---
Either leave the items in loot tables or remove the effect entirely. Keep it fair for future players. 
---
Bravo, nicely done! 
---
Lmao
---
Hence the reason I said what I did. It looks bad having to remove features. If it is game breaking now, it was game breaking when they made it.
---
I didn't read that they are removing it? Just that the mod can't be found but the drops are still possible
---
They should fire the guy who came up with this. So stupid and unfair.
---
FERTILE SOIL. Get rid of it. Lol
---
Better now?
---
Stop spreading misinformation and making statements about things you really don't seem to know much about.
---
Nobody cares if you want to be ignorant and risk your account but encouraging others to do so by implying there is no risk is bad.
---
That is also a problem. That should be looked into before these new dlc type contents come out.
---
Added functionality for botstops?
---
Well,  it WAS an insane asylum before the war. And I'd take those blocks. Good source of lead. :P
---
That’s how I read it and honestly could be the final straw for me, they didn’t listen at all. I have a TS Assault rifle that makes using it actually worth the ammo cost now it’s gonna be useless again. 
---
Anyone have luck finding the silver spot south of Cliffwatch?  That would be a perfect place to set up in collect silver to repair my ultra site armor while leveling up at the golf course.
---
Why have a dilute recipe for it when the Enclave MedBay vendor sells a recipee to make normal stimpacks, and with chemist/super duper you can get between 2-4 per craft (depending on how super duper is behaving that particular day, it's kinda...weird....sometimes it applies after other perks, sometimes before, all in all, it's glitchy)
---
Death Claw: Scaly Skin, Carnivore, Deathclaw Gauntlet. 
---
My friend dropped a 3* golf club and that was my first 3* weapon and I’m lvl 85. It’s not that bad tbh once I over repaired it does 137 damage +1 strength +30% to super mutants and deflects 50% of blocked damage back
---
I'd just love bosses that you can take on alone without the entire server joining in. I'd love to be able to beat the Scorchbeast Queen first.... I have tried so many times and failed because of the amount of people that come calling when I launch on her. 
---
I just did about 8 hops on another character and didn't spawn.  Might be a rare one.  Please let me know if you find it too.  :/  
---
To be honest with the stim recipe it's easier to buy from the enclave.  As for the super stim recipe drop.  I can confirm 100% that the cranberry bog event rewards with it.  Have now had it twice.
---
I remember the first time I found a bird decoration in the wild and got excited thinking I could place it... but nope. Not even that.
---
(Unless it’s a buildable camp item already, but that’s not the same as seeing a thing in the wasteland, liking it enough to haul it back home and putting it up on your wall)
---
I really hope so. 
---
If it's just regular all out PvP, then no thanks. That's just going to be griefers riding high all the time.
---
There's nothing fun about having a player twice or more your level with all the best end gear coming and killing you, because they can, and because of game mechanics, there's no chance of you winning. 
---
Because that's really what PvP has always come down too.
---
Bethesda should really, really get some idea of what the players want. If they want to go this route, then I want them to add an option where I can join servers that DONT have the PvP rules. 
---
Do you have a tse and just an explosive gun?
---
Have you seen the difference?
---
I just wish her radio station played music. 
---
Agreed. Two shot isnt the problem here.  The explosive prefix when combined with weapon damage perks AND the demolition/explosives perks is by far more unbalancing to the game than Two Shot.  I appreciate that Bethesda is listening to community concerns and addressing them, but this "fix" isnt going to address the core problem.  It would be better to omit Explosive Weapons from being affected by explosive perks and increasing the strength of actual explosives like grenades in order to keep the perks relevant than to just kill the Two Shot affix.
---
Fuck it - I used to play the tag and let tag game at Whitesprings / Nuke Zones
---
Not any more.  I will be pulling that TSE Combat Shotty trigger so fast on anything I see move.  
---
probably because that would nerf other explosive  weapons. lazy solution.
---
You are right 
---
Not sure removing TS from the drop tables is really the answer but \*shrug\*. 
---
Thanks! It basically just gives no warning that a perk is duplicated and gives no value... meh.
---
Fair point, I did forget about that because of folks using bobble heads.  You are right though, fireproof has made a pretty big difference, thanks for reminding me!
---
Absolutely yes. Btw the volume of posts exposing how annoying the current perk system is gives me hope that Bethesda would do something about it in the near future.
---
Do you have Tank Killer on as well?
---
&gt; That would simply make mules omnipresent  
---
They already are. Arrange a trade with anyone, they're likely to show up with a lvl 1 character.
---
&gt; and inventory infinite.  
---
From a certain point of view it already is or if you prefer your mules to be able to move then the limit is ~4000 units.
---
All I know is that my Plasma Gatling just became that much more useless. :c
---
The problem isn't waiting for more content. 3-6 months wait for the first content drop would be fine.
---
If the game as released wasn't so lacking in such a sad state.
---
I will add you tonight if your still doing this. 
---
Bethesda is banning people caught glitching in, though.
---
Basically all my weapons will be weaker now. I dont even PVP. Im pretty upset about it.
---
I completely agree.. it my knowledge 2 shot doesnt benefit from perks like explosive does right? Also why the heck are the removing it from world drops??  Once they fix all the duping itll go back to being fairly rare anyway.. I'm mind boggled 
---
Going along with you, something like this, perhaps?
---
Three stars  - semanal event - Three Stars garantee loot (weapon\\armor)
---
Two stars  - nuke-site daily event - Two Stars garantee loot (weapon\\armor)
---
One star  - daily event - One Star garantee loot (weapon\\armor)
---
I have found that the loading time at a new locating is really hit and miss. Sometimes it's instant, sometimes it's just as long as before the patch. 
---
I had a pretty bad one last night though. I have my camp south of Whitesprings right next to a cave that always has a Yao Guai (unless I killed it already). I loaded in and went straight to the cave for that delicious acid and springs drop. Problem is, I wasn't fully loaded in, so I couldn't pull out my weapon. Yao Guai also wasn't loaded in, but I could hear him growl and that telltale doink sound as he hits me. I start running away, hoping that everything would load in, but instead the game freezes. I had to hard close the game and reload. Of course I died during the freeze and the reload lost my junk. It's ok, I was only going to sell that stuff.
---
I like it when people come in.. my camp is on the golf course and no one every comes near it.. I wish there were more people in one server to increase the odds of running into someone
---
I think it should modulate your voice chat to sound like a robot
---
I wouldn't expect any Civil discussion.   They assume anyone who enjoys playing FO76 is brainwashed to love Bethesda.
---
That is why they condescendingly say 'It's ok that YOU like the game'.
---
As if we needed permission. 
---
Interesting.  I often find general weapon mod plans in the trunk in the tunnel that opens when the event is complete.  Where did you find the recipe? 
---
Yes. But I would think that armor penetration wouldn't matter so much when attacking level 1 enemies?
---
They should just remove the explosive effect
---
And everyone would be happy
---
Now you wont be able to loot it which is unfair to players that doesnt have such weapon, also this will encourage dupers because the weapon will be exclusive
---
&gt; PS4 player here. We are same as you on PC.
---
Try using the PSN recent list, not the in-game list.
---
There should be stash boxes and bunkers every few meters.  Also every mildly hard or annoying encounter should automatically drop 3* legendary items, also there should be a nanny bot to hold our hands.
---
and the miner's monument south of whitesprings
---
Still the only enemy I haven't seen in the game. 
---
A 25 percent damage bonus is still respectable. I think this will just move the focus more toward bloodied and instigating, though. Whether that will make for an interesting change in the dynamics of PvP, I guess we will see.
---
I bet their doing it as bait for dupers.
---
I’m level 45 and when I’m bored I’ll find someone who’s lower and kill them just for the hell of it :)
---
I am sure there are going to be a lot of folks upset about it, including quite a few of the folks I play with regularly, but I am hoping this change helps more than it hurts, only time will really tell.  If they are planning on having new weapons, new legend mods, higher level caps on items etc then not having two shot in the game anymore will eventually sting less.
---
The "two shot mod" means that the modifier can no longer drop on legendary weapons.
---
MY.POWER.FIST.IS.PENETRATING.WINK.WINK.
---
This has happened to me since release, but at random times. One day I’ll have the bug and the next everything is fine
---
One can dream 
---
This shit is super unfair
---
I'll be quitting the game then. 
---
There's vague news on new content on the button but I share the sentiment. Definitely want something more to do than nuke zones
---
Uh, I hope that doesn't mean you can't get ANY new two shot weapons from killing enemies.
---
Otherwise you just handed the DUPERS a huge advantage and even more dominance in the marketplace.
---
Good luck getting a two shot weapon if the only people that have them are DUPERS :(
---
For sure, I'd like some really tough ones. A lot of us are at the point where literally nothing in the game is a threat. Even the Queen is pretty easy to survive. She's just a bullet sponge. 
---
It's a tough nut to crack though. Armor doesn't scale up that much so much too much damage will even kill high level players really quickly and fuck up the durability of their armor. Too little and it'll just be a damage sponge like the Queen.  
---
Nope, that's entirely intended. You get their caps on hand or the bounty (whichever is greater). They get a damage penalty if they aren't carrying the bounty in caps, but the damage penalty is pointless.
---
I've posted about this previously but shotguns get much better than double damage from two shot. It only increases the pellet count by one, but still increases the base damage by the damage of a standard reciever like it does on every other two shot. Meaning either all the pellets are doing Much more damage, or that one extra pellet has insane damage. Having used one I'm inclined to think it's the former.
---
What they should have done is put two shot, as it exists, on the same effect tier as explosive. As it is explosive has nothing that can compete with it. It gives 3x damage ffs, at the risk of Maybe killing yourself. 
---
with that logic there will never be new content
---
I have an explosive gatling gun, maxed explosive perks. It's a beast without 2 shot. 
---
That’s the way it sounds, seems like a strange decision. I think TS was fine, it is the explosive effect that needed to be modified. All they had to do was change Demo Expert to three star max or mod the % buff for each level. 
---
That's right.  I did a double take when I first saw it there.  Also I learnt it right after so I wasn't confusing with a normal stimpack.  Unless someone placed one there which I highly doubt lol.
---
You’re not allowed to post factual, logical, or positive information in this sub at any time. Doing so will warrant immediate downvotes.
---
And please make them drop your level gear. Got 3 star level 15 armor from level 65 super mutant. Im level 69.
---
There was 1 level 20 player nearby but it should not affect my loot that much... 
---
Hurray is how I feel. 
---
A lot more disconnects after the patch. Even afraid to claim a workshop because i know i will dc soon.
---
Now i also get complete darkness except the stats like hp. rads , ap etc...
---
Leaving and joining a new world didn't solve it..
---
I'm awful at PVP. I'm a prey animal, I know it. But I'd play this PVP mode just for the added tension and feeling more of a need to survive. Sign me up.
---
Shotgun damage is spread across 8 pellets.
---
if damage for the shotgun is 80 each pellet will deal 10 damage.
---
4 pellets miss, down to 40 damage total.
---
damage reduction is calculated PER pellet. so 10 - DR = final damage.
---
For your rifle, if it does 80 damage, it does 80 damage per shot. so dont miss and you get the full damage.
---
80 - DR = final damage.
---
i dont know how the DR is calculated for damage, i just know that because its calculated per pellet it ends up doing less damage.
---
They need to Nerf the SBQ then, these are what took her down, now it'll be close to the limit on time...
---
It’s meant to be a sniper rifle
---
I drop them in the overseers box in Flatwoods. 
---
That's what I think too - honestly I'd be ok with Two Shots remaining as is even, just fix some of the other prefixes like Furious should be able to scale beyond Two Shot so it can be better for boss fights.
---
Its really Explosive that's the big problem - it makes whole classes of weapons redundant in the game.  I wouldn't mind if they removed boomsticks entirely from the game...  I suspect Bethesda has gotten the wrong message from TSE.
---
Probably because their employees clearly dont play the game.
---
You can find part two of that in a mailbox. Not sure if it's the same Sally as she seems lobotomized and mind controlled or something by the abductors. 
---
But why do you need to level so fast?
---
Where did you read this at
---
Personally, I have no problem finding wood and steel all over the map. Although it may have the most trees, they are found in most all other regions too. And like half of all junk has steel in it.
---
I think what is happening there is another symptom of power gamers. Players who are just interested in the quickest leveling, the quickest way to get “x”. Not that I entirely blame players for that. It’s the result of developers taking a single player game format and changing it to a multiplayer game. So many unexpected kinks are going to show up like this. 
---
Youtubers are not above the law. showing exploits is not good for the game
---
Will have to look into this event :)
---
Thats what Sebetter was saying.  the first shot it 100%total damage, the second shot is only the wepons base damage.  If you count perks, chems, etc, that second shot is already only doing around 50% danage as the first.
---
Whole heartedly agree. I'm not opposed to PVP but a no holds barred option with a game full of exploiters with TSE shotguns and multiple bobbleheads stacked really devalues the idea.
---
&gt; I mean these are just the principles of any mmo
---
That's not true at all. "Bound" gear is definitely a valid choice for a game world but it runs completely counter to the concept of a player economy. MMO games run the entire spectrum from everything is bound immediately to nothing is bound.
---
True or I could just break my promise and keep it to myself...Nah, he really needs it and Maybe I will find a new one.
---
It comes down to managed expectations. What people expected, versus what was offered. Throw in a healthy dose of cognitive bias and what was actually said has become irrelevant.
---
People are getting their sandcastles kicked over, and they're pissed. The real world isn't fair, or just, but they've been told their whole lives that "bad" people get punished. No one wants to feel powerless, and they REALLY don't want that in their power fantasy.
---
Absolutely, I think like many things if they try and force it on people rather than offering it as another option you can choose to take part in, then it's gonna be a rough road ahead for many.  If it's just another way for them to allow more people to play how they like best then it shouldn't be too much of an issue.  Thanks for sharing!
---
I hear you, but I'm not sniping with the shotgun. Point blank shots will only do about 5% of their health. 
---
Hey you never know !
---
i kinda like the size. Its bigger than the other cities, but can't get lost in it. That's just me tho :)
---
Agree, it's extremely suspect balancing. I have two of the same level single action revolvers. One is plain two shot and one is zealot with explosive. The explosive outdamages the two shot clean on everything from what I can see. Two shot ain't the problem.
---
Pretty crazy by the fact that you can gain complete immunity to grenades, launchers, and fatman. I know that explosive spams can be annoying in any game but yea pretty crazy. 
---
Noooo. It takes roughly 2 minutes to complete at higher levels and is quick xp. 
---
Bethesda, if you're listening, pelase hear me out. Rather than completely eliminating the two shot effect, simply "upgrade" the explosive effect to being a primary trait so that they don't both drop on the same weapon. 
---
TS is excellent for powerful, slow firing weapons like the Dragon, and explosive is great on rapid fire guns with lower damage per shot. Neither one is particularly overpowered on its own, but the combination of the two is what leads to completely ridiculous damage values because people can stack all of the relevant gun perks *and* the explosive perks.
---
tl;dr: don't take either one away, just make them mutually exclusive.
---
I have mixed feelings, I’ve always got my doubts. I had a bad experience during the beta where 5 people wrecked my house because I accidentally looted a box at Wade airport and became wanted.
---
So now I have a house that is a maze behind a locked door with punji boards and traps all over the walls and floors and a turret greets you at the end, which is of course where I live and is behind another locked door. 
---
At the base of my house though I have a newspaper machine lit up with arrows with those “we are in this together, we MUST win!” posters next to a stove with some decking and seats for the friendlier types. I never fully trust anyone which is why most of it is locked off
---
&gt;Keep it fair for future players.
---
And the actual players (I casually play since day one) but do not got one.
---
Nobody wants my stuff, and I don't want to drop them.
---
other mods do more than 1.25 . bloodied, junkies, noctorunal, armor piericing, maybe even furious but thats capped.
---
DLC....... eventually
---
I've been on-n-off RPing a cannibal chef since I first found the hat.
---
I rock the vampire costume, monocle, slave neck, ***meat hook and chef hat. I drop soup and cooked meals to randoms. 
---
My *** has 40% super mutie dam, +1 str, and I think damage reflect on block. 
---
PSA: meat hook and other like weapons scale with both fist and one handed damage.
---
I might catch some flak for this but here goes; can we please, in this game, with this good community, not degrade into the sort of elitist MMO mentality that often goes along with boss fights and end game content, where you have to do specifically what we tell you, or you're not invited? 
---
Yes I know its frustrating to deal with a fight that could have gone a lot smoother sometimes, but if you're just casual,or you want to try new things or challenge yourself, you dont want to be forced into a box, and with the game being so open about your choices there should be room for that too.
---
They may have an ego problem but I think they need valid and relevant content for ppl to navigate to their channel.
---
Right now the focus is in Fallout 76 and it’s issues, duper’s server dc, griefer. Anything that can bring ad money and traffic to their channel is highly prized
---
I say just keep them in the game, but Nerf it in PVP
---
There was an explosive effect change last week, though.
---
Two-shot is silly and I wave it goodbye. There are far better modifiers with a better skill gap.
---
Two-shot is an additional projectile at the base weapon damage plus weapon bonuses (including explosive) with additional perk effects (cripple) at the cost of weapon condition. Bloodied and Furious are stronger with rewarding mechanics - you risk your HP with bloodied, you risk being a bad shot with furious, and neither adds additional cripple or effect damage.
---
Yeah, the problem witht he current situation is that it is a halfway house that pleases no one. It seems some what unrealistic to me have a Fallout world where othe players can't be a risk to you.. but at the same time, for people who don't want PvP to be aprt of their, offering servers where PvP is impossible.. it will make those people 100% happy.
---
For people who do want PvP to be an option, gave them servers where PvP is fully operational and take the gloves off. It doesn't mean you have to attack people.. but the threat will now fully be there, and if they can flesh it out a bit so there are rewards to fighting but also rewards to working together depending on the situation.. they could make something that isn't total chaos.
---
Yeah agreed. Everything TS just gained value and will continue to do so. 
---
I don't think it signifies anything important.   Human Player character models exist and putting them on an NPC in the dev room does not mean anything.  That's my opinion :P 
---
Finally someone that's honest. 
---
Though I disagree about the player economy part.
---
Looks great! Props for having realistic architecture.
---
You ARE the wise Mothperson.
---
An even better idea! Unlimited c.a.m.p storage
---
Adding fireproof isnt a nerf, its a bandaid.  All fireproof does is force people to use slots on a suboptimal perk as defense against the possibility of griefers.  
---
I've had some really nice interactions, and almost all with no mic, so I try and be really nice back. I don't want high lv players to have a bad reputation with newbies
---
I'm with you there. My biggest pet peeve is when I'm in a nuke zone and accept a random group invite and some numbnut isn't on passive and tags a high level player it drags me into PVP engagement which gets me killed even while I'm on passive and not doing any damage.
---
The last time I was picked on (meaning some random came by decimating my base) I kept building a wooden wall that he kept smashing down. He didn't realize until it was too late that his cap bounty rose to a pretty rediculous level when I took him out for all his caps and switched servers. I was already at maxed caps so it went into the ether but considering the swearing I heard on the other end it was kind of worth it.
---
I can’t one shot a super mutant with my TS lever action. Maybe a level 10, but not a level 68 which is what I mostly encounter. I found an explosive shotgun which I don’t use because it’s too powerful, but my TS lever was just fine.
---
There is also a good house just north of Seneca rocks visitor center.
---
I know, I play with Bloodied/Explosive radium rifle and it's pretty game breaking too.
---
Except no one complained about TSE in PVE, except when they couldn't get tags off quick enough, it was also about PVP.
---
I see it working if they increase the weapon level cap too, if we get level 75 or level 100 weapons but no TS or TSE that could work. 
---
Exactly, wouldn't it be nice? 
---
Do you know what I want? A weapon that allows me to PvP one-shot tanks, evaporate power armor and walk through everything in the game with no effort. Yup sounds like "the best guns" alright if you're an underachieving scrub with no skills.
---
Exploding has an entire weapon class and perk card set devoted to it. Nerfing it too hard would potentially mess up an entire build philosophy. Two shot was drag and drop damage. Not exactly breaking someones perk loadout with fixing Two Shot.
---
Show me where it says anything about 'if you think you received a duped item send a support ticket'
---
There have already been half a dozen posts on it and most folks aren't cheating their way into locked off areas, so there's not much they can do about it except talk. So why get worked up about it until we see what BGS is going to do with him?
---
Same, never even thought about it then, bam, I was out or cores.
---
Ah, that's hot
---
So my  quad ammo, double barrel, explosive shotgun will still be OP? 
---
Agreed fully..or pve ONLY servers you can opt into before u join a world. 
---
So the good guy thing to do is pick the lock and leave it, so some noob can loot it without a bounty. Is that correct?
---
The main problem is the game doesn't know what it wants to be and end up doing what it does mediocre. 
---
Low health and wear 5 pieces of Unyielding and get a +15 to Charisma.  If each have a modifier effect of +1 Charisma get it up to +20.  Currently have 3 Unyielding pieces.
---
Yeah it's fait to say I've been addicted to fo76 sinse the beta. I've put up with dupers, griefers, SBQ disconnects, bullet sponge enemy's missing camps, stash limits, no lovable npcs, the data leaks, the canvas bag-gate, lack of consumer feedback, the atomic shop debarcle and just the general re-skin of fallout 4 tom-fuckery. 
---
But this... 
---
This has killed it.. 
---
He's most likely only there to test weapons etc.. doesn't necessarily mean NPC's will be introduced into the game. 
---
If I was one of the dev's I'd make him in the likeness of the boss just for fun. 
---
In my experience this is a UI glitch. I was trading my wife around 1500 ammo when I accidentally canceled the trade and it disappeared from my inventory until I reloaded. Note: she said she could still see all the ammo after reinitiating the trade before I noticed it was wasn’t viewable by me. 
---
So you can make a certain kind of build so you can make anything in the game easy. 
---
Sometimes I don't really get why people play a game if all they do is grind to make everything easy. 
---
And then complain about the game. 
---
Yeah but that's ok, because the rest of the mods are stomachable.  But I'm sorry a gun that fires 2 projectiles per bullet that also explode is a fucking hilarious joke and doesn't belong in a game like this that is already ridiculously easy endgame.  Like who wants to be able to 1 shot a fucking lvl 60+ super mutant a month into the game? What's left at that point?
---
I've only beaten the queen once with a large group. Can her wings be crippled?
---
Who knows, maybe they will boost enemies explosive resistances if legendary explosive guns will still be overpowered.
---
Yup, I have 3 *two shots which will now be useless. One explosive pistol.
---
You can also play the mini games on them and change a specific lights color
---
Can you see a way to cancel out all those duped items but implement this?
---
Do you know where I can find this mythical rock?
---
https://ibb.co/5k6jbSM
---
There have been tons and tons of videos and posts about wooby.
---
It's just a human skin on an NPC, used for dev testing. Doesn't really mean anything at all, could have been set up before they set up any other characters or as a joke almond devs.
---
Inside the vault 
---
They just just majority nerf it for PvP, with the additional of explosive resistance to the Fireproof perk. 
---
I would love one of those Halotape briefcases the overseer stored hers in 
---
I woulda thought the caps cost is based on their caps current stash ?
---
Can you stash caps in inventory?
---
Just because that fixed it for you doesn't mean you're in a position to make a blanket declaration about what causes the issue and what fixes it. I don't have those bugs when playing on my 240hz screen.
---
Sweet thanks
---
Ya. It’s very weird. I played for an hour last night with no crashes but the night before i kept crashing over and over. Last night I stayed away from workshops though 😂
---
So instead of fixing it we are just gonna remove it entirely? 
---
Bungie just did this with a gun and exotic in forsaken. Its lazy as hell. Jesus. 
---
You said it, man.
---
Can they please fix the damn trade slider scrolling past 0??? Put it back the way it was. 
---
A duped item is an exploit. 
---
Lol if their useless then drop them.
---
I know got won't as you know they won't be useless
---
 bugs fixed and I wonder how many of those fixes created more bugs.
---
Also keep in mind its basically not possible to drop keys, so if you've picked up that key at any time you should still have it.
---
Please update when you've discovered the key, otherwise we might have a new mystery to try and figure out.
---
Can you post a screencap of where exactly it is?
---
That's why they're nerfing the mod to only do 25% bonus damage AND prevent it from dropping in the future.
---
Okay that's fine but you've took to insulting people who enjoy ganking gameplay by insinuating they lost in call of duty or fortnite and are angry.  I'm saying it's a legitimate game mode and some enjoy it.  I like playing the hunted and the hunter and sneaking around my base as a low level is an adrenaline rush to me just as much as stalking prey.   I enjoy it, and I'm sorry that you do not.
---
Have you tried crouching? If you abuse the bad ai and keep your distance for sneak shots you can easily take out an entire group with 1 shot per before they know what's going on.
---
 salzig  
---
&gt;This is a really big deal.
---
Why is it a big deal? What are you expecting from there being a test NPC in the test room?
---
Wooby is in an area player's shouldn't be accessing. The people going there are using cheat software. Wooby is the harbinger of permaban. 
---
Yeah, this is a good argument for auto. Proc those staggers. Also, full auto doesn't necessarily mean "spray and pray." 
---
Yeah this, I wouldnt mind if that means that the item will be permanently unavailable from there forward, as long as I could decorate my camp, or at least, variations on camp items, so that there are multiple choices of shelves; some with food, some with books, some with ammo and so on, so we can choose the same shelf but with different items on them.
---
Never thought it this way.....I’m about to be rich 
---
Not bugs. Not Robots. Not Deathclaws. 
---
And then you breed them together to make different version. The way you tame them faster is to use kibble you've made from other ground up dinos...  
---
Those perks should be good, because they have a trade off. Instigating sucks for team/group play and sucks for PvP. Bloodied requires you running low HP and rewards the tedium of keeping up with it. Berserker requires low damage resistance. Those perks are all much more balanced. Two shot is just straight free damage with no cost, and currently more free damage than any other perk is capable of. 
---
That is not going to give those youtubers a lot of views. Now talking about how people sell the unreleased items from the dev room will do it.
---
I haven't had it happen to me, but thank goodness.
---
well i like the challenge and hard enemies, too    
---
BUT if I kill a hard to kill enemy, I want adequate loot for the effort and ressources wasted   
---
So for me TSE was highly regarded as the weapon to use simply because of balance of used ammo, stims etc / loot from the enemy  
---
So if they make enemys really hard again thats fine, but loot has to be something which feels like a reward and should be like said  balanced around the ressources needed to kill that enemy
---
Yup this is a buff to only 2 shot. Im done.
---
Good at least they're getting that right.  Explosive needs to go too.  It's the only way that they can increase their chances of a longer lasting game, like seriously.
---
Sometimes I don't really get why people criticize every little thing someone does. If I wanna play the game and criticize it, I should be free to do so.
---
Given they're saying it's a "new mode" it's probably an opt in situation. Time will tell, I hope so. 
---
That would be what best would mean, yes. Which is why they are so popular.
---
The comment is more about how they hype up these blog posts then all it says is "new stuff eventually, also were nerfing this type of powerful gun". Its not communication, and could have been put in a simple tweet days ago.
---
Based on that inventory, Bloody Arrow had more than one screw loose when he chose to fight you.
---
Well leave world and go to another server? or is it persistent?
---
RotoDAP if you wanna add me :) 
---
Hm, I wonder if that would stack with my reload speed increase on the gun... Might have to do some experimenting, thanks. :) It's already pretty quick for me though, and it helps that the LAR works well in VATS. 
---
Nope. Not on my current layout but perhaps it could with a different wiring layout. 
---
Making people dupe more might be the point. There’s gonna be an even greater uptick in duped TS weapons starting now. Easier to track and catch people.
---
Well here’s hoping!
---
Oor, they could just fucking nerf it too. Not every problem is solved by getting rid of it.
---
happened to me, same situation, but he was in a group. when i tried to get it back, he tried to sell me it cheeky pr¡ck. i tried to kill him w/ an EB lever action, but the group kept mowing me down. had a ton of hardened mass too. absolutely hate people like that.
---
If item load is an issue they need to create prefilled shelves, book cases etc with items already attached so it functions as just one item but looks full, for camp use. That way the game references one item, not a shelf and ten things on it and our camps look lived in. What is the point of 10 empty shelf meshes. 
---
Hey, at least they're fixing something.
---
It actually does fire 2 shots in a shotgun-y spread. You can see it easily with TSE automatic guns or lasers.
---
They should be non stackable, that would be a great idea!
---
Edit: Found a Golfer dude and gal on the road near the Enclave Bunker, she registered as my  3 of 3/10 but thecloths lining guy was busted and did nothing. Oh well will keep hunting and hopping.
---
I have it and fucking love it. Its a tse heavy build. I just love life when hammering those rounds into living tissue. 
---
Explosive was and is and will still be THE mod to have.
---
Like a horrifying ButtStallion? I'm in.
---
People are assholes.
---
If people were grinding them and not cheating it wouldn't be an issue.
---
They'll introduce new e
---
Weapons and mods in the future once the duping glitches are patched, remember the game isn't "finished" and will continue to evolve.
---
This is AMAZING actually, you're free to leave the game
---
Well, no one ever said people can't be civil. Especially when talking about animal dismemberment/brutal people slaying. 
---
What’s the second star? :)
---
They are a waste of time doing in their current form. I've got 132 of them rotting in my inventory hoping one day they will add a chance for legendaries or recipes to drop in them.
---
Yup. Ppl cling to old outdated info because it fits their narrative.
---
Add in Super Duper and it's crazy. I have a .50 receiver for Hunting Rifles that's only a couple points less damage than hardened. The ammo is definitely worth the trade off. Now I just need to find a good legendary hunting rifle. 
---
Honestly I think that the best way to balance the explosive legendaries would be to just make the initial shot do no damage but give the explosion all of the damage that the gun would normally do. 5 damage per pellet on a shotgun, for example, would still be 5 damage per pellet but with an aoe. 200 damage rifle, still 200 damage but now with an aoe. Still a badass and useful legendary effect but doesn’t just add a ton of single target dps. 
---
You can't steal from their camp but you can get a decent amount of caps off someone looking to defend the homestead.
---
Yeah. I’m getting a steady resupply of purified water. I have about 50 now in just a couple of hours.
---
I did Messenger 3 times and never got stuck. I like doing escort missions, sometimes they feel like chores, but some are fun to do like Always Vigilant or Beanstalk.
---
I leave part of my camp open for guests and another portion locked for myself. I also have a resource farm which I leave opened up and free to grab as a peace offering so no one griefs my base.
---
To touch on the silencer bit; covert ops and mister sandman are pretty handy, if you've invested in agility. Sure, sandman only works at night, but it's pretty handy all the same.
---
Lower per-shot damage full auto weapons might be worth investing in "Long Shot." I haven't needed it with semi-auto rifles, however.
---
I am honestly wondering.  Why did people not equip the mods right away with how well know this issues was? 
---
Fireproof + dense makes it do no damage
---
Same on PS4.   Game loads.  Then freezes on black screen.  Then does a second load screen. Then loads.  Then freezes. Then after about 5 minutes of this all the assets and environment snap into being.
---
Plus 10 damage while aiming 
---
Man
---
Yeah, but now double damage is a quarter damage. I'll just have to be happy with what i got. I do have a tse gatling laser, it'll be interesting to see how that's affected.
---
Go away? I did, I quit the game because it's a fucking joke now with good weapons.  It barely  feels like Fallout at all besides the setting and a few other things.  This game has no real challenge or reason to keep getting on to play and I hate that which is why I still keep up with it and hope for good news constantly. 
---
Beth just killed off the remaining players. I don't even PvP before I got my tse I HATED the hordes of bullet sponge enemy's. My tse was the only thing keeping me in the game. 
---
So tah tah.. 
---
That person sounds like such a jerk, If you're on Xbox I'm always happy to share resources, I seem to horde them 
---
When it happens, exit vendor and open the vendor again.
---
Explosive is still a 3x damage bonus. It's still broken, just slightly less broken as a TSE.
---
Non TS, explosive weapons were still massively overpowered.
---
This just makes TS on its own pretty much ass compared to Anti-armor or bloodied. 
---
10 percent while aiming damage my b
---
If your entire enjoyment is based off of one legendary mod, and a nerf to something overpowered is a problem, nobody is making you stay.
---
Nothing has been ruined, and you're the one whining.
---
Event feedback:
---
I'd like more costume based rare-drop awards from events.  Having to collect every piece of a set (hat/mask/outfit) would make me feel more motivation to replay events after I've done them once.  I'd replay them even more dragging my friends through them so that we can all match.
---
A hangable wall decoration from the event area would be nice too.  Something like complete say, Tea Time ten times, you get plans for a painting of the Giant Teapot to hang in your C.A.M.P. It'd be like showing off a trophy you earned.
---
And of course in general please just make them less buggy.  My sister, husband and I completed Swarm of Suitors the other day, and it didn't ever flash as 'complete' and gave us no rewards.  And we DEFINITELY mowed down all the 'lurks.
---
If you don’t want to drop your shitty legendaries then deal with the encumbrance. It’s really not that difficult.
---
To do this you would have to have those with pvp enabled not show up on the map. Otherwise you can just camp and ambush people way too easily. Because pvp would be much easier, you would have to reduce or remove the cap penalty from dying in pvp
---
If it pulls griefers away from the rest of us then I'm fine with it
---
Every online game has had a removal of items in the past. At least bethesda is announcing it ahead of time and not removing old two-shots
---
Thats some serious dedication to the role playing haha
---
I’d politely back away from your offer slowly
---
I’m a Capital Wasteland vet, not a fool. No “strange meat” for me, thanks.
---
nearly every item is in the dev room no matter if it is going to be used or not.   
---
It could be, mine said zero weight. I sold a bunch and it didn’t seem to make much difference if any to my carry weight.
---
Not invited. You were an annoying prick for 25 long years and I was serious at the party when I said I hope you die of bone worms.
---
The second part also mentions other players using exploits. If you get an item through trade like the marine armor helmet plan, it is from the dev room and is an exploit. These items are flagged and your account can get temp-banned for it.
---
I'd sell two shot Gatling for 2K are you kidding me
---
Well, I've been in similar situations and found that people are generally the opposite, so it balances out. I actually died alongside my friend at the end of AWOL Armaments when the legendary bot exploded while a random in power armor survived nearby. I thought for sure our junk was gone, only to find him waiting and guarding it for us.
---
Unfortunately, in a nuke zone, expect it to get snagged simply because of the number of players. "Even if I don't take it, someone else will" mentality runs rampant (and is completely true) there.
---
One of the two takes a couple of seconds to fix and is a necessary balance change.
---
I've been having a lot of fun with this game, but damn... this is bullshit.  Prices for 2-shot anything are going to skyrocket on eBay, and that will be the only way to even get one after this patch?  This is creating even more incentive for duping, and it's more of the same focus on non-issues while not fixing game-breaking problems.  Whose moronic idea was this?  
---
I think this game has bigger issues than this.
---
It would make the game better and having a camp more engaging. 
---
My mule acc was banned for carrying duplicated items (not even from dev room). I play on PC but don't think that Bethesda will make an exception for console owners.
---
There are some weird camp bugs.  My budget was at max with the remainder in storage so I went to go look... I had over 100 corn, mutfruit, and tato plants in my stored tab.
---
Figured out that whenever you log in and your camp spot is taken, when you reload to load your camp it duplicates all your crops and puts them in storage.
---
What happens in the Savage Divide stays in the Savage Divide
---
Idk maybe they just don't work for some people, but mine works fine, I don't need to use power attacks for it to heal me.
---
They aren't shitty.
---
I never once said that, and I never proposed removing any of the other glaring issues from the game.  I think that a massive nerf would be awesome, enemies should fucking feel like part of the game because right now they're a complete nonissue and a laughing matter.  You have to REALLY fuckil up or not be paying attention to die in this game at high levels unles you're running some weird ass build, and I think that's utter bs.
---
Two Shot is a legendary weapon mod. It’s not a perk. 
---
I cant understand why they are focusing on things like generic pre-war clothing and halloween customes. 
---
I somehow believe that Bethesda has a extra department for their Atom shop that is more focused on marketing strategies and detached from the other development teams.
---
Got a load screen for power bench just a min ago made me reload into base?????? Weird...
---
I don't see an issue. I don't PVP though. Is it a PVP problem? 
---
For everyone saying explosive is the problem, fireproof 3 + dense mod makes you take no damage. They nerfed it in last weeks patch by changing the perk
---
PC
---
During main quest: Into the Fire, at the final physical exam (in the mine with the beacon) i run into scorched level 47 &amp; 68, while i am only level 14. I cannot possibly kill them all without using all my ammo/stimpaks, and it seems i have to kill them befire i can interact with the beacon in the end. Anyone know what to do? :)
---
I'm cautiously optimistic about them being more transparent. Let's hope they keep it up.
---
Diluted weigh less than regular stimpacks
---
Yeah, good suggestion. Remove them from the map so they can farm or hunt in peace. I'm not sure if I would remove the cap penalty entirely but I think it does need a cap at 50 or 75 for example.
---
I agree, destroying camps loses its appeal quickly. Unfortunately, that really is the best way to get the ball rolling.
---
Stop asking for nerfs smh
---
That's why they released the fireproof perk that mitigates explosive damage. 
---
The terminal is attached to the input side of a pressure switch on the interior of the structure. The exterior door switch is a keypad switch attached to the main grid. Perhaps the pressure switch prevents the terminal from connecting to the door. The indoor wiring is run on a separate line through the roof and over to the genny. 
---
I run melee adrenaline crit build so I normally focus on ground enemies in my immediate area until the SBQ lands on the ground. If I see other players going after adds I wont bother running out of the way to help them kill a lv 30 scorched that they should be able to 1 shot. 
---
Huge pvp problem, and it's just way better than any other prefix. Like why do +10% damage to players or +30% to ghouls when you can do double damage to everything?
---
Or not create\\fix at all. One can very clearly saw that the mod it is about to be scrapped.
---
Well Fed causes this and Rejuvenated makes it even worse because death happens at higher hp %. This also happens way more often than when the Well Fed status wears off. Somehow the status is calculated constantly (or at least often, maybe every % change off hunger)
---
I ran a test where I radiated my character to \~15 % of health and when I put rejuvenated on and made few jumps my character died. When I removed rejuvenated everything was ok and I could jump all day long. Or I thought everything was ok until I went to farm whitespring nukea area and died at \~7% hp. Then I realized that it is not the rejuvenated that is the problem but the Well Fed status. Rejuvenated just boosts the +25 hp to +50 hp and that amount of health is somehow deducted from current hp every time the well fed status is calculated. The hp drop shows in health bar and it is very rapid drop and regeneration.
---
I took a look around the river but couldn't find any safe, please share the safe location and I'll take a look (I've finished the game and have plenty of shit in my inventory, so may have a key)
---
Sneaking would probably ruin all of the fun left for ya honestly.  If you run silencer + sneak perks you can really one shot or two shot very high level enemies with the right weapons, it is disappointing.
---
They really just need more high level areas/dungeons. They can even add dungeon events to areas that already exists. I wouldn't mind a full scale assault with a team on Harper's Ferry against an army of super mutants and a big boss behemoth at the end. The result being that you took back Harper's ferry and it is mob free for X amount of time.
---
Yeah. I like it but after a couple of hours I legit think to myself "oh I just leveled up a few times and what am I doing with my life" then log off. But I come back to it again because I like Fallout stuff.
---
I actually kind of enjoy that one. Not because it's difficult, but because it makes a legitimate change in the world until it's completed. Kind of encourages people to get involved.
---
They dont, they just play the damn game and do challenges you savage.
---
In general I would love more events that make it easier for players to come together like they do in nuke zones. 
---
Make powering the power plants a server wide event. Make fast travel to events free or really cheap to encourage people to join. I'm not jumping across the map for an event for 33 caps. But for 5 I might. 
---
Make the rewards better. Power up Poseidon, get 5 fusion cores for all players on the server. 
---
They need to make larger events to draw people in to work together. 
---
I like the small ones as well but as it is I barely see other people at all. Lore wise were all vault dwellers trying to reclaim west Virginia, wouldn't we work towards some goals together? 
---
There are certain items only available through the dev room and is an item only obtained by cheat software. Those items can be traded and are flagged which can get your account temp-banned.
---
Duped items (like millions of bulk wood and lead) can be reported through a ticket. 
---
I don't see how this balances anything. 
---
1 shot exploding shotgun &gt; 2 shot non-exploding shotgun
---
I would like this. With or without the flames :)
---
Yeah, I can close it from the inside with my terminal. I like having my doors closed. 
---
&gt; We’ll go further into this **new mode** next week.
---
Reading comprehension is hard. Do you honestly think they're going to change the entire world to be constant PvP? It'll be some sort of opt in method whether it's dedicated servers that you choose on start up or something like Hunter/Hunted that simply removes all restrictions for anyone who starts it.
---
Love it. 
---
You can easily see both mini nukes launch in the two shot fat man.
---
Raiders, Raiders never change.
---
I'd be more than happy to have my camp attacked a bit more if I could loot the bodies when I return home and also have more budget for turrets
---
I can sell two shot Gatling for 25K. I just need a buyer!
---
No. I meant go away from here. Nobody wants your opinion.
---
no, just no.
---
There is already a 'tame' mechanic in game, if you've got the right perks, for having an animal to guard your base.  This would be an itteration on it, and honestly, the Giant Hermit Crabs have a food truck for a shell, those things have alot of storage space, you can even see some duffel bags kinda 'hanging out' the broken front of it, near the crab
---
That’s basically what’s gonna happen after this patch. TS is gonna be nerfed so hard that doing enough slap damage to kill somebody is just entirely unfeasible.
---
no they dont
---
I bought it from the watoga vendor, called signs and letters. I’ve seen it sold by grahm too 
---
Salve, diluted, regular, super. 
---
I just vendor all but super (but being in PA means I don't need stims often) 
---
good you should be ready for that kinda thing when you are in zones too high for your lvl
---
Agreed. Don’t like others leaching off my nuke runs 
---
The post never said anything about duped items in the first place. I was originally talking about items that are found through the dev room that aren't available in the normal game. People have been scared of being banned just for having said item. This post is for those people.
---
If you’re vendoring them or wanting to scrap them then they are shitty.
---
You absolutely do, legendaries and all. Plus if you just put a single round in every enemy, you even get the xp when the turrets finish them off.  
---
I know I'm in the minority in this, but I think the turret platform can benefit all if used properly. If everyone stands on the golfcarts in front of the rear doors and just tags enemies with a pistol or something. It would save massively in weapons, armor and ammo. Just lure and tag and let the turrets finish them off.  
---
For the record, I don't do this. But I do think that the turrets are the smartest and easiest way to grind.
---
The reason I suggest that is it would be too easy to hunt or ambush people and just take a bunch of caps from them, but yes a cap on the amount is also a good idea
---
I just find it really weird that [explosive is considered a tier 2 legendary effect](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713408867500032/535475359580291092/unknown.png) despite how powerful it is. Personally I would've put it on the same tier as [incendiary and wounding](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713408867500032/535475523867115520/unknown.png).
---
This is also concerning in a way because it meant that at launch Bethesda was alright with the idea of someone potentially getting a two shot explosive wounding weapon somewhere in the future. Just imagine that on a minigun or even a shotgun.
---
The bullets still do damage, the explosions don't (for me anyway, if I shoot a TSE at the floor my health doesn't move)
---
My terminal has no functionality unless I use a laser tripwire and those were bugged for me when I placed one the first time. I attached a Tesla coil to the tripwire and tested it. Afterwards I could not get the laser to reset neither physically through the cursor nor electronically through the terminal. I pressed reset but the Tesla coil would still fire up every time I attached it. 
---
won't drop.  there is/was no mod to be found in the world for TS, it's a prefix on dropped weapons only.  was.
---
Anti armor is a decent effect too at the moment. Sometimes I like it more than instigating since it still works on follow up shots. 
---
exactly correct.
---
But that only fixes the PvP aspect of it. What about people 1 shotting every enemy in the game? 
---
The final straw... 
---
I understand this for single-player games...and while I know FO76 isn't _quite_ an MMO, I tend to apply MMO logic to this: Want to play through the questline with a friend? Start an alt. Want to play through the story again? Start an alt.
---
I get it...I put 99% of my time into my mains in games, but alts can be exciting to play too...frees you up to really change up your play style without much consequence and in this game it means you get more storage AND another CAMP you can build. :)
---
Plus maybe you play a straight-laced do-gooder on your main and you rock a super punk-raider look on your alt for fun!
---
It will not because items drop in a paper bag in 76
---
You mean this post which is your opinion of what would qualify instead of anything specifically said by Bethesda? 
---
Are you sure endangerol is bugged? Other people on this sub have recommended using it. 
---
Thats a bad idea. There are already perks and armor available in game that can reduce TSE in pvp damage to practically nothing above normal base damage.
---
Fireproof and dense mods will do this. Use the perk carda for that, thats what they are for.
---
Why did I read that in J. Jonah Jameson’s voice?
---
Well perhaps bodies would only stay around for a set amount of time. Kind of like the water purifier fills up and won’t fill more till you take what is in it. It would be too easy to throw off the game balance if there were piles of junk when you got back. Haha
---
I hope so. When I see on Ps Store Atoms on sale, I feel like I have a knife in my balls.
---
I have a 2 shot missile launcher and it fires two missiles.
---
You are only projecting.
---
Nowhere does it say gankers are CoD players. If you look at the end of the whole thing again, you'll see it's not the gankers that I'm making fun of..... it's the people who show up asking the sub to support them after leveling a CAMP with crappy music playing over area mic. :)
---
It isn't really a legitimate game mode with all of the considerations above - I have no attachment to my CAMP because the mechanics allow me to replace the entire thing in moments from decon arch to foundation with little cost. I have no investment in "adrenaline rush" of sneaking around to chase a player because Lone Wanderer and Sentinel help me outclass anyone wandering around in Excavator armor, who I can easily shoot in the back as they fast travel in, while their turrets watch - and dozens of other one-sided scenarios.
---
There is entirely no risk and no gain.
---
If you (or I) raze a CAMP we razed the CAMP because we wanted to raze the CAMP. No one is any more "virtuous" than the other person. That's the point.
---
I always thought it was dumb how having the right perk cards equipped was required to craft certain weapons/armor/etc. One minute my character knows how to craft a super advanced Gauss Rifle, but the next (after I swap my perks back to combat) he’s be lucky to make a lead pipe. Just dumb game design. Should have never done away with skills.
---
Dat weight tho! Lol!!! Sorry for your luck my friend.
---
Aren’t you stooge who keeps pissing and moaning about how dupers are ruining the economy? Well prepare for eBay markets to make a lot of money now
---
Well that's the thing, PVP should not be able to be started at your level regardless, it only starts at level 5 as you will see, also thought no one could kill you either .. but with so many bugs anything is possible.
---
Let's not encourage Bethesda to set foot in the same trap WildStar did.
---
WS launched with an amazingly casual-friendly, solo-friendly game for level 1 onward to max level with some cool crafting and cosmetics and a great story... 
---
...and then focused entirely on nothing but intense hardcore large team raids and rep grinding for raids and raids and raids and raids after that. The game died on the vine soon after.
---
There'll always be a player base that wants kick-your-ass-hard raid bosses but let's be practical and acknowledge that that is not going to satisfy most of the player base, only those at the peak who love that playstyle. And they alone aren't enough to sustain any game.
---
I'll buy any turret that doesn't have a clipping hitbox like an amputated hovering unicorn when you'll trying to put it on an incline or building.
---
Well I am glad I get to keep my TSE Handmade and 2 Shot Combat Rifle. I wonder what they will be worth in 6 months when they no longer drop
---
Don't be that guy. If you are, Bye.
---
Thats great. X3. I was making a joke about him literally having over 200 loose screws on him when he decided to act crazy. :p
---
1. Change hasn’t been out yet
---
2. If that was the only thing you were playing the game for, then maybe you shouldn’t be playing it
---
Yeah nah, I suspect every item of being duped at this point, there’s no avoiding it 
---
Seriously.... I haven't been playing too much so there's plenty I haven't seen yet, but this has been my biggest concern as I get close to 50 and beyond. Is there no way to sell an item valued at over 200 caps? Besides player trading?
---
I don't believe it's a dick move at all.  Just make sure Pacifist is on and go to town.
---
Just.. try not to hit any of the cars, trucks, or buses close to where others are standing (or running).
---
Or just add more value to the card so at rank 2 or 3 you can get springs and such from weapons instead of just more steel and wood
---
Yes they are reducing the damage 
---
Each item has a base item ID (i.e. "10mm Pistol"), level, legendary affixes and most importantly a *randomly-assigned maximum condition* that would have been duplicated and can't be changed. Bethesda should be able to identify these "identical" items which exist in unlikely quantities and just delete them.
---
It is infinitesimally unlikely that anyone has looted their own item that has the exact durability of a commonly distributed duplicated item. If some poor bastard is caught up and loses his legitimately looted TSE weapon though... well I think that is an acceptable amount of collateral damage.
---
I just tested this with a shotgun and it does not. 
---
Or only one person can where it through y’all the servers and whoever kills them becomes the sequoia boi!
---
Ok nice. I only recently discovered the Watoga vendor. The Harper’s Ferry vendor has been my go-to dude for camp plans so far but I will start checking Watoga as well. Is server hopping effective for plan hunting at a specific vendor?
---
Absolutely. I think people have become so accustomed to talking about TSE that there's a general lack of awareness, or at least discussion, of how many powerful effects exist that can easily take the place of two shots.
---
I know that, but this would be a reliable way of getting it where you wouldn't have to worry about the fact that it spoils in 10min and there are only so many plants to grab. It's not "pointless". It's sort of a quality of life improvement. Nobody like running around an area for 2 hours looking for those 2 random trees with glowing sap and such.... that's just an example, yes I know there is a place you can nuke with more than 2 glowing sap.
---
I equipped the first ones immediately, but those were spares I was going to sell to other players because of how sought after they are.
---
So you are telling me there is more to do than grinding for legendaries? Are we playing the same game?
---
I'll have some of the Roast Beast, please!
---
DLC for 2020..
---
This thing will become useless for me, it already does so little damage. 75% nerf is a bit extreme.
---
Is that a picture of the river Whine? 
---
Coming from your tears of whining about whiners?
---
The TL;DR
---
I don't know who beat up your Pikachu or wrecked you in Fortnite after you couldn't win in CoD, but these pleas for praise to only PVP within the parameters that put you at advantage are a joke. Don't cut yourself on the hardcore edge of those safety scissors. After your apple juice and nap you can join us in Monster Mash.
---
Cheers for those individuals who raze CAMPs because they admittedly just want to break some shit and don't expect a support network to coddle them outside of the game.
---
End quote... 
---
Honestly though, one star legendary even if it's explosive or two shot it ain't worth fortune. I would say up to \~400 caps for one star, mostly less.
---
I have a 7 luck (stealth rifle build so I tend to save food that boosts Ag, Per and Luck).  A friend of mine has a full set of Unyeilding armor and his Luck is 20+ because he runs around at less than 20% health.  I haven't noticed any difference in the amount legendary enemies we find running around Watoga.
---
Without 2 shot its going to be harder to one shot enemies, and over time enemy levels and gear levels will go up making this gear less viable.
---
Also there will be the introduction of 4 and 5 star legendaries down the line. The nerf for two shots is a 37.5% damage decrease, which is quite significant
---
Can you find it as loot sitting on a shelf like a T60 Optimized Servos Mod?  Can you buy it from a vendor like the Skate Blade Mod for the Ski Sword?  There are no legendary mods that you can find, and then attach to any weapon that will accept it.  
---
Hence the confusion.  Legendary modifiers / perks / whatever you want to call them, are not mods.  I cannot find a Two Shot Mod anywhere in the game and attach it to whatever gun I wished.  If that was the case I'd be all over Google to find out where the Two Shot Mod spawned :)
---
How are you feeling 
---
Ive taken monongah power plant 3 times this morning to farm fusion cores and DC’d right after. 4th time I just took the workshop and built a fusion reactor, managed to get 1 fusion core before DC’ing. Its been a fun morning. 
---
&gt;If that was the only thing you were playing the game for, then maybe you shouldn’t be playing it
---
Right? That was my first thought. You are playing in this huge open world for just one single item?
---
It's all in today's 'Inside the Vault'. This constant removal of fun stuff makes me want to flip a table.
---
Yes and no. You don’t get more budget at higher levels, but items take up less amount.
---
This means you have to scrap things you built at lower level and rebuild higher level “less space versions” to see a benefit.
---
You see the confusion thus has caused, even with tests.
---
That's kind of what I was thinking, having more ranks that allow you to get better scrap from weapons, and also search robots and turrets like that
---
he was prob a duper
---
I was re doing my camp and they got scrapped during that...
---
It's very easy to double check this. Equip awareness, shoot here with endangerol, then see if her resistances change at all. They don't. 
---
Likewise, if you have one of the mods that let you view hit points you can compare shots before and shots after if you think there's something going on behind the scenes. It's a pretty well-known fact that endangerol has been bugged for quite some time.
---
Pretty easy to get the toys back though. Hardened mass is difficult to farm sometimes, it’s all rng
---
Did they fix the bug when leaving a crafting table you immediately use it again unless looking away?
---
So instead of properly balancing everything, they made the most powerful weapon type legacy? That won't solve any balancing issues. The nerf hardly affects this.
---
You do know that two shot comes with decrease accuracy and increased recoil right? So if you want to get all your shots in, pretty have to be in shotgun range. And what is the skill gap for anti-armor effect?
---
I like it because I have one that only does 35% to mirelurks, but I love the whistle sound it makes when it fires
---
The problem is it takes so long to spawn in and be able to use your weapons that half the ghouls are dead by the time I even get in the building. It's just a dick move really as it's usually high level players that do it and it takes away the grind for low level players. And if the enemies scale with the high level player, the low level player might die straight away and not get to tag anything. It's the same reason I put away my TSE weapons if there is other players around me
---
Yea maybe I'm not against that at all
---
Hurts shotguns too. As it was the only thing that could compete with TS was bloodied. 
---
I'm okay with reduced damage with two-shot modification, I'm fine even if they fix the damage with explosive modification, but we need a damage bonus for each Percepition point. If you nerf to ground ranged classes we'll be again with 1 shot melee builds meta.
---
And energy weapons, don't ignore the problem.
---
On Xbox I have more issues than ever
---
There is a large percent of innocent people who have never duplicated or exploited anything that have seemingly found a good deal and bought a duplicated weapon not to their knowledge. If Bethesda deletes the characters of these innocent people, they will lose the majority of the people who play this game and it will die almost immediately. I would be willing to bet duplicated items have trickled down into 60-70% of all inventories. Whether it be a duplicated purified water that was gifted to a low level player out of the Vault or a TSE Shotty that was sold to someone looking to get their first powerful weapon. Bethesda knows this, and that’s why it will never happen. Their bottom line of course comes first and they would lose money on the game. 
---
I feel kind of frustrated, but I just checked and I was able to loot a medics Gatling gun and a vampiric Chinese officer sword, so it’s not all bad.
---
wish they would tell us when that is instead of posting the same "in a few weeks!" every article.
---
Yes please :)
---
Both transfer items to other players and rejoin last server (if it's still alive and not crashed).
---
Its odd there fix is removing TS from being obtained through "the world" making the ones in existence all that much more rare and valuable. Seems like they should of just done the opposite and made them some sort of quest item, by guaranteeing them (like an all rise), would devaule you them in the dupe /ebay community.
---
Nocturnal FTW. You have less damage when it is not night right now. Great!
---
I have nothing against the nerf. I just find the way both TS and E were/are nerfed/removed little weird.
---
The nerfs were really needed, but I don't know if those perks are enough against E or was it just a way to put responsibility on players, and was it necessary to also remove TS, because it will be nerfed too.
---
But I don't know anything, so maybe it was?
---
&gt;So you are telling me there is more to do than grinding for legendaries? Are we playing the same game?
---
Yes. There is.
---
Yes we are. Only some of us are playing the WHOLE game, and not just focused on a small part of it.
---
furious will greatly exceed two shot on a gat or .50 cal after this change.  furious caps at 200%.
---
It is less xp than a single glowing ghoul from a nuke zone...
---
Weird...not my experience at all...
---
I just wanna place items that I’ve picked up, like teddy bears or bobble heads. 
---
So glad I got a tse .50 cal yesterday.
---
6 months? It'll take less for prices to jump up 
---
So what else is there to do?
---
You know you could have just put them in your stash for later not use them
---
The TS nerf is so significant that I don’t think people will want to use them. I won’t use them anymore. Partially on principle tho. I really think that Bloodied, instigating, Furious, and assassin’s are better than TS at 25% since TS also kills accuracy (particularly in VATS)
---
Will never be possible because of the weight
---
There breaking the game only ones complaining are the ones without a tse weapon , a big part of this game is explosive/tse weapons 
---
Stupid games =  Stupid prizes 
---
Ymmv, but I did this just yesterday to fix my arch. My house had a footprint of maybe 15 or 16 foundations.
---
Nice edit and follow through lol
---
Nope, I don't care about the economy since I just but from vendors and play the game...
---
Stop whining and learn strategy and adapt.
---
Thats an issue for the person who bought it.  No one forced their hand.
---
No. I imagine you would sing a different tune if you thought some items you traded for or bought legitimately would see your main deleted from existence.
---
These people didnt just dupe weapons &amp; armor. Materials, Serums etc were all duped. It would only be fair to treat ALL people who unknowingly purchased duped items the same. There is no severity based upon the relevance or power of the items duped. 
---
Stop thinking so small.
---
I appreciate that BGS is getting better with their updates and Inside the Vault articles but I genuinely feel them wanting to have “conversations with us” is complete bullshit.  I have a ton of ideas but I feel they would fall upon deaf ears.
---
On the topic of events, I feel like most of them are not so rewarding.  I like Brotherhood of Steel events because you can get plans for Power Armor mods.  They should also have a chance to drop Plans to craft Power Armor if they do not.  Uranium Fever and One Silent Night are also good events for some higher level Legendaries but they should always be Level 45 or Level 50 items because they are more difficult.
---
My least favorite events are the Power Plant and Horde events because half the time you need to travel to different locations to find the boss.  Even when you do, they usually do not scale with you.  That includes locations like the Cranberry Bog, The Mire, and the Savage Divide.  I cannot say I have gotten a Level 45 or Level 50 Legendary Item even in those more difficult locations.
---
All events should give more caps than they currently do.  Farming caps is much harder since you cannot server hop for cap stashes anymore.  Another reason is because half the time you are fast traveling to the other side of Appalachia for an event you you complete the event to get your 25 caps back.
---
I do like the idea of weekly and daily events.  Weekly events should guarantee a Three-Star Legendary item upon completion and daily events should guarantee a random tier Legendary item.  They should also give more loot like caps, ammo, and chems too.
---
This is by far the most Herp derp thing I've seen on the internet in a while.
---
LoL
---
That would be a very welcome addition.  They're already in the game and functional, just give them to players.
---
I like the change to the two shot.
---
But I also hope they remove Explosive. It doesn't make sense. 
---
But if we could craft different kind of bullets, like incendiary, armor piercing, explosive, I think that would be fine. 
---
I completely agree... Plus god mode isn't that fun tbh
---
The nerf to the 2 shot damage will also affect the explosive damage since the explosive damage scales off of the weapons normal damage. So tse weapons will have a huge impact from this
---
The combination of two shot and explosive is the problem.
---
Events are pointless after a certain amount of playtime. They need to have a larger impact on the player and environment. Everyone misses the feed the people event, because it altered the environment and impacted the world. 
---
There are also far too many events going at once for them to gather large amounts of people. Give them meaning. Give them purpose over repetition.
---
I had a one shot explosive assault rifle doing 151 damage.  With full explosion perks I’m 2-3 shotting nuke zone ghouls.    The TSE shotgun I got will now do 400 instead of 600.   Full explosive perks will still make it op.   Now most will just move to armor ignoring melee.
---
Agreed, I’m sick of iguana bits. 
---
Coming from someone who has no constructive input on this thread.  Do you have anything actually adult / productive to bring to the thread? If not please keep the meaningless comments out of here thanks.
---
First time in a Whitesprings nuke zone?
---
There will be many more.
---
Yesterday I was working on my new camp and a level 135 (i was level 23) came up to it in full X-01 power armor painted in the new toy paint and started exploring it. I dropped him some water as a thank you gift for visiting and he stood still for a while. When he came back, he had dropped 5 or 6 plans for a bunch of camp stuff, all of which I didn't have. I grabbed it all and went to take a look at all of the cool new decor I just got and when I went to go drop him a full fusion core I was likely not going to use for a while, he was already far down the road. I will always remember you when looking at my new high-tech table, Jimmy.
---
Can't get two shot anymore, because giving subpar weapons a chance to be comparable to others is just too much.
---
Can still get exploding shotguns that delete anything you point them at though ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
&gt; TS not working properly in VATS
---
TS is working as intended, it adds +150% worse accuracy on both shots which can cause your bullets to miss. "Hitting" in VATS just means the shot is aimed at the correct place.
---
Even outside VATS you can manually aim at a Scorched's head and the bullets go to either side.
---
Then Two-Shot being nerfed makes the game more challenging and enjoyable in the long term. Most of these kids who one shot everything with TSEs won't be playing the game much longer because they are going to get bored, and they/their friends have started getting banned.
---
How exactly would you suggest fixing all the TSE weapons already out there?
---
This isn’t an accurate take on flux at all. First of all, Flux doesn’t spoil in 10 minutes, it’s more like 3-4 hours. If you have to run around a nuke zone for two hours to find a couple of trees with some sap on it...find some different plants to pick or find a different nuke zone because I clear all the flora in a nuke zone in 15 minutes and am loaded with Raw Flux.
---
The only quality of life improvement would be for you I’m afraid, as it sounds like you’re having an unrealistically hard time finding flux like the rest of us.
---
Im not trying to be uber and have the best gear Ive been grinding for a weapon that goes well with my perk build and how I play
---
no &lt;finger guns&gt;
---
I thought 2 shots currently do 50% more? Not 100%. If that's true its a 25% nerf instead of 75
---
Yea wow, I don’t know how many people here have played with a vanilla two shot weapon but they’re trash compared to a vanilla explosive weapon. And you didn’t mention the most important part! They’re removing the two shot mod FROM THE GAME. Only existing stock in circulation will continue to be available but no more drops. 
---
As some one who has a Regular Two Shot, I'm not upset to see this change, currently Two Shot just doubles damage, making a 2sLAR hit for about 150 base, no mods, and no perks, which is pretty absurd imo considering it's only using 1 unit of ammo, and it's .45 which is pretty common (it drops in groups of roughly 20/ammo box in my experience as it's the same ammo combat rifles use)
---
Oh my god lol that’s insane. I’m probably wouldn’t even get mad if that happened to me. But yeah the bobble heads need to be re-worked
---
It would be helpful in this system if it's tied to the specific character and not the entire account. This way it would allow people the flexibility of switching between their Responder, Free States, BoS, Raider, Maiden of Mysteries etc. characters.
---
I still still want them to implement displaying our character name. Example: CharacterName (Gamertag)
---
You can put plants on campfires
---
I think adding new content before they stabilize all the bugs would be silly personally. 
---
Forget MMO crap like raids. Can we have *questlines*, please? Literally the only one we got, other than the main questline, was the Mistress of Mysteries questline. I'd like several more, please. 
---
good riddance
---
Bye. 
---
I disagree. Explosive weapons ie grenade launchers, grenades, missile launchers, have weapon class and perk card.
---
Granting the benefit of those perks to weapons from other classes like rifles and shotguns was unnecessary. There really is no need for the explosive legendary effect, at the very least it shouldn't be boosted by the demolition card. Other weapon classes shouldn't be able to double dip because of a legendary effect.
---
Yes, so I can swap back and forth genders after accidentally falling in irradiated pools of water.
---
It's a tier 4 legendary, so presumed to be something for 4 star legendaries whenever they start dropping. [There's a fifth tier as well, but it only has 3 effects](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/499005909880668161/535519309649281035/unknown.png).
---
Active increases player AP by 10, Healthy increases player health by 10, and dangerous increases damage by 20%.
---
That does make sense and would work extremely well but how would that affect current weapons? It might cause a lot of bugs and glitches
---
I thought that was really odd way of doing it. I'm kinda hoping they misrepresented what they're actually doing. Which is hopefully changing the existing two shot modifiers to be +25% dmg and removing the two shot modifiers from the loot table and replacing it with +25% dmg
---
The peices of the 2shot are going to go way way up
---
I wasnt expecting help because i thought i was alone, i was the only player in the nuke zone and then i saw him crouched watching me kill the ghouls and took the opportunity to get some extra loot by just sitting there
---
Not exactly what your looking for but for now it might work?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9qred/bless_the_person_who_told_me_you_can_plant_on_top/?st=JR0XLHFP&amp;sh=bccbfa95
---
Items yes...   level no
---
Agreed. I dont want to worry about encountering other players if I stumble across someone and I can give them gifts or check out their camp that's awesome. 
---
I built my camp next to a house so I can make a guest house for people who find it. With crafting stations and purified water. 
---
On another server someone had built their camp so you would encounter it when you left the vault and not the overseers camp. It had food and water and makes a great new player experience. 
---
Sadly this.
---
If you buy something from the merchant, a portion of the caps will go in to the merchant's cache. That's the only way to sell an item valued over 200 caps. Although I don't think any exist? Outside of players themselves valuing them on the open market.
---
I would imagine it pissing off people who didn't manage to get one in time
---
Cheerio, good chap.
---
That happened to me earlier today and I also at screamed when I got attacked by a horde of ghouls and a wendigo while  fixing my guns.
---
Since they removed them from drop tables then I’m gonna guess that if the nerf to 25% isn’t enough then they’ll nerf it more. I think it will be. The other good effects will be better. Furious, instigating, bloodied, and the enemy type effects will become better.
---
Yes please, I think that 2-3 star legendarys should be TOUGHER but guarantee that 2-3 star drop.
---
Also those drops should go back to SCALING with your level.
---
Nothing is more disheartening than getting a trash 1 star piece that's not even scaled to your level.
---
I've been grinding Uranium Fever recently and EVERYTHING I grab is 1-3 star trash that I can't do anything with but donate it to lower level players.  Half the time it's not even worth that, because I'm killing 3 star enemies and it's giving me 1 star under-leveled trash items.
---
I think this, or a level-locked server that is more hardcore than the current server. I'd love to see a "Horizon Mod" style server that gives risk vs reward, and makes survival harder.
---
I don't pvp, I just approve of ganking being a thing.  Whatever point you're trying to make you're failing to make it.  Probably the run on sentences and switching who is the subject your talking to every other sentence (literally).   However, I believe I understand what you're attempting to say.
---
Crafting different ammo sounds very awesome! It would allow you more flexibility in your playstyle
---
Instigating, AA, and Furious are going to be in demand now.   Furious is going to be top shelf.
---
No one wants to nerf explosive weapons like the grenade launcher.
---
It was clearly never intended for the explosive legendary suffix to make a shotgun into a one-shot room clearer.
---
They need to do something about the explosive effect, not the 2 shot effect
---
I've seen that sometimes, but I think it's a damage scaling bug. In those cases I see my own damage chunking away at her way too much. I don't think it's a bobblehead issue (I don't have 1000 sitting in my stash), I think that's a fallout issue. There tend to be a lot of those. I also tend to get worse quest reward armor when it's an easy fight, but it's only happened a handful of times.
---
Is it that hard to remember to put them in your stash first? It's for a few days. I mean, seriously, how much do games have to literally do ALL the thinking for the players?
---
Have you found that when you scrap plants that they go into your stash with no timer/spoilage?  Thought this was interesting.
---
i dont really care about the stash box in bunker because i've learned to use the one at whitesprings before going there to dump items but i would really appreciate a hidden entrance to the bunker from whitesprings basement just like they have in real life. 
---
Unlock safe https://imgur.com/gallery/RfykrZE
---
I'm writing that on a sticky note
---
They could add npcs little by little, like some brotherhood soldiers in their bases, a group of lost responders you need to save, etc
---
Most likely taking a break myself, until im not salty anymore. Its so hard to play when you feel screwed over. I hope the feeling passes soon I really love this game a lot. 
---
If that’s so, it’s just like Conference call / Bee Shield combo in early borderlands days.
---
Cool story.
---
Sure, not like I already went through all the other strategies that don’t include legendary items and now I’m min/maxing
---
If "Two Shot" becomes "One shot with bonus damage", then this effectively halves the damage of TSEs, right? 
---
Instigating Explosive will be the next must-have for single shot weapons.
---
Good point, they were at least scary when starting out.
---
Quick question, what did that event do to alter the environment and impact the world? Maybe I'm missing something, but nothing changed.
---
I looted a two shot harpoon gun...I guess I have to keep it now.
---
Practitioners of technophilic bestiality.
---
I'm kinda glad I haven't seen mothman the flatwoods monster was terrifying and I didn't even fight it
---
How? Because you somehow got a dupped weapon without knowing? That doesn’t make them dupers. If I watch a youtube video about duping does that makes me a duper? No. Stop trying to justify your action by saying everyone is duping.
---
Half the time I walk around forgetting to swap the correct perks back, so yeah, ADD is a bitch. 
---
Time to get some armor ignoring explosive weapons.
---
Kind of surprising considering they worked like this threw-out all of fallout 4.  Fix was intended to make PvP usable I would assume.  Pretty much no one cares about PvP, the should have just put damage caps and nerfs on player damages if wanted to fix weapons for this purpose
---
Sure?
---
&gt; and because my husband is constantly at 0 stimpacks somehow.
---
Lol! Mine is the same way.
---
I have WAY too many but can't get myself to sell them either because I know as soon as I do I'll suddenly need them or something. 
---
But I play as a sniper/stealth so it makes sense I don't use a lot.
---
Done with you, move on to another thread to inject your brain seepage or what you call your arguments into.
---
the 2 should never have been combined in the first place, both should have been primary affixes 
---
Why do you use any weapon but the pistol and melee weapons you find after leaving the vault? Why do you equip armor over your vault jumpsuit?
---
Why are you trying to make the game so easy? Why can't you just sit back and enjoy the ride?
---
Yea I’m pretty sure it’s random so server hoping should work. There’s also a vendor south of watoga at the train station that’s worth checking. Good luck! 
---
A week is more like it
---
I dont code so forgive me here but actually rolling back all existing tse guns. Change the modifier tiers and have all existing tse weapons roll back to only explosive. I think that would be the more desired modifier of the two. 
---
Leave both two shot and explosive in game but never at the same time. 
---
Pro ably to keep it from being added to certain gun types.
---
"If you think you are experiencing an exploit, stop using it immediately" - that is clear enough. Are you really that naive to think that TSE you bought was not the result of an exploit ? If you want to play ignorant, be ready to face consequences.
---
Ahhh shame but makes sense 
---
Taking a cue from Destiny. That’s what they call
---
“Balancing”, they nerf the preferred weapon instead of improving the other ones to be competitive 
---
Seems like you know your stuff so I'll take your word for it. I was just asking cause I read an apparently misleading PSA post on here a few weeks ago saying endangerol does help with the queen.  
---
Thanks for all the tips! My friend and I plan to launch our first site prime nuke this weekend.
---
Wouldn't it? Naturally the gamers who do everything on automatic will complain to no end about how they used up all their best ammo on a mole rat because while at level tenhundredbillion their auto reaction to anything is just attack.
---
Screw them. One thing I like about fo76 is raised the bar back up on having to think a little. Games were getting so dumb down. 
---
Well they aren't two shot or explosive so I feel nothing 
---
I think it's the same since regular is 1 and diluted are .5
---
Getting downvotes for saying the above.. Oh, you guys...
---
That's my read as well.  I holster my weapon and throw out a Hi!  emote as I come up on it to help show my intentions.
---
You can plant on the campfires currently, but I also suggested this before.

The event "feed the people" previously gifted all players on the server one item of food. Now it is only those who do the event.

I can confirm I've heard more of this recently.
---
I do a lot of trading on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  Several traders have mentioned their friends have been banned for duping.
---
I'm also seeing LESS "will sell u guns for real money" posts.  Those were happening ALL THE TIME in those reddit markets (they'd literally make new reddit accounts all day and every account would get banned from reddit, only to come back an hour later).  Chances are those dupers got the axe, so they're not posting anymore.
---
those types of people ruin every game with pvp, was only a matter of time honestly. just gotta enjoy things while they last.
---
lol
---
sigh
---
Ok bud, dont get so angry that someone has an idea that doesn't seem to pertain to you. The patch notes a few patches ago said it changed flux spoil time from 30min to 10min so 3 to 4 hours cant be right. All my friends and everyone I have played with liked the idea. If you dont like it then that's fine, move along but dont come here being hostile for no reason. Do you not having anything better to do? Actually I dont care if you do... just move along.
---
I can't believe they think its a good idea lol.
---
Didn't pick that quad lever rifle up yesterday in the Watoga Station suitcase did you? :P
---
For mods I normally go max damage, max armor penetration and max hip-fire, although I wouldn't know what's good for VATS because I rarely use it. Recoil reduction is good on the combat rifle though because it's really bouncy. If you're using the combat rifle for emergencies then put a compensator or muzzle brake on it rather than a suppressor. Sniper rifle gets a suppressor.
---
The lever rifle has a damage handicap over the hunting rifle due to lack of magazine mods, and you don't get recon scopes, but otherwise it's a really good sniper if you can get an Instigating one. A Quad could be a replacement for a combat rifle for spamming, although you won't get as many Tank Killer staggers.
---
I'm cool with how it is now.  I literally earn atoms for scratching my butt in-game.
---
If I wanted to grind the atom quests I could, but meh.  I have made 7,000 atoms by doing nothing but playing.

Sounds like you want too many cosmetics.  Prioritize your purchases, you don't have to have EVERY cosmetic :)
---
The second bullet will do +25%damage instead of full damage. 
---
bethesda will never be able to solve every bug in their games, its something their fans have learned to deal with tbh
---
What mod? You cant get legendary weapon effects as mods only the sacrificial blade and scorch killers.
---
Two Shot Legendary Weapon Modifier is being changed to a Flat +25% Weapon Damage Boost
---
Now, you are Gruel.
---
I can sell it for that price if u give me 45 mm ammo too? 
---
if he has that much damage he likely duped the bobbleheads, you should report him if you haven't 
---
Most weapons deal +100%, there are some weapons with multiple projectiles that the damage is increased by less, my flamer that has many projectiles adding 1 more increased its damage by 25% only.
---
If you dont use survival/efficiency perks (like me), there isnt even enough perks to fill a combat only build. (Focused around 1 weapon of course: pistol, melee, etc)
---
I have about 8 perk cards i dont even need/use in my build.  I dumped them into luck and agility. I rarely use crits (melee bloody sslege build)
---
I started using fireproof and i like it. Helps with pvp combat.

I'm not saying that Atom points is useless or a theft, but the ones that are on the store are ridiculous.
---
I'm saying that is ridiculous __paying__, not obtaining.
---
That's pretty messed up.  Did you have pacifist mode enabled?  I run with that all the time to avoid accidentally hurting other players during crazy nuke blasts.
---
Unfortunately, doing heavy damage to the rare griefer or outright slaying them in one hit is difficult unless you have a really specialized build for a specific weapon type and possibly a damage boosted legendary weapon.  I have a lvl 45-50 2-shot combat shotgun, crossbow and a furious ripper stored away for sale to a good home.

If you play on PC, my name is Shankwell.  Send me a friend request and join my server.  I'll happily give you a bunch of screws, nuclear material, ballistic fiber, ultracite and other junk items that you can vendor to make bunches of caps, along with whatever random camp, armor and weapons plans I happen to have on me.  If you haven't unlocked all the vendor locations, I'll fast travel to all of them so you can follow for free and unlock the location to make 1200 caps a day selling junk. (1400 when you get deep into the main questline)
---
i mean i had it on prior to patch, maybe ill try taking it off and putting it back on.
---
Will stand at a wall and shoot my TSE Lever Action and TSE Comat Shotty and see what happens
---
Melee has been broken for ages as well, but at least melee doesn't have an explosive radius, and melee cant fire off several dozen rounds in a 30 second span.  Melee has a swing speed limit that is alot slower than rifles so single target is great but what if you need to kill 20 enemies? That's at least 20 laborous slow swings right? 
---
I haven’t seen him for maybe like a month
---
Yeah, its mostly theory here, but if we used to be able to swing the air and get the bonus without even hitting something, then it has to be tied to direct weapon damage instead of how much damage came off of the enemy hp bar. 
---
It is so and it's why after next patch shotgun use will go from 50% fotm to 90% fotm.
---
Im not sure what you mean.
---
Do you have people that you trust that you can play with? You could make an alternate character and keep them at that lower level and get the gun. Then trade to friend. Trade back. Viola.
---
The problem is the players who don't have it and are whinning about not having it. Go nuke Whitesprings and farm that shit. RNG being an ass? Oh fucking well. Don't ruin other peoples' fun because RNG shat on you. PVP griefing with TSE? Welp, make some noise and have Bethesda do something. Oh wait, they did by totally screwing up the TSE weapons. Geez. 
---
Hmm. ok. I'm an ebay -er too. 17 years so far (dang). But I've never really dealt with reporting another seller. All I'm basing my  opinion of ebay being strict and quick to respond is how helpful they are over the phone. Every time I Call them, because I have an issue with a buyer or a seller, they're very attentive, very quick to respond and deal with the issue. I've never been given the run around. They have been super helpful in that sense. Last time, I bought a car, and I had a bunch of problems with the transaction itself. So I called, and they didn't get off the phone with me until the issue was resolved, and they listened very well. My problem was fixed with haste and attention to detail. 
---
It sucks that for this particular issue, they wouldn't act, (or be able to) quickly on it. 
---
Totally agree man.
---
That's not how it works
---
There’s nothing wrong with the nomenclature. It’s a legendary mod that will no longer drop on legendary weapons. Mod = modifier. Anything that alters the weapon or item from the original form is a modifier.
---
As a member of the 'Regiciders' I fully support this post! Be a team player, We take down queens quick with 3 or more players. I personally run a 5 Cyrolator loadout for the queen with 2-3000 rounds - its doing no (meaningful) damage at all. The ability to keep her on the ground makes this fight into a far simpler affair. We have 2 x STRONG Melee DPS who actually kill her and the others are on Add duty and pouring in additional fire when free. Our current record for the Regiciders crew is a 1:54 kill from 8 of us, and we've had 3 minute kills from  a squad of 4. 
---
There is so "mod itself." It's a legendary effect, not a weapon mod.
---
In my house toys get taken away if they aren't taken care of. When you accidentally scrap one just thing that you broke it playing with it. Mom and dad aren't going to run out and buy you a new one. 😀
---
In my opinion they should just remove TSE weapons. don't put exploding and 2 shot on the same weapon to balance it out instead of turning 2 shot into 1.75 shot and taking out the drops. This is very upsetting one more way PvP has ruined a great game, wieners whine about getting killed with a 2 shot so let's take it out. 😒 this has to be stopped we've rly got to change Bethesdas minds on this one guys.
---
It can certainly be situational.
---
I was playing the other day with my brother and someone dropped us witch costumes. We rush over to our stash boxes (we were in white springs) and put our witch hats on that we’ve been saving. We ran back over to him and sent him the heart emot. Still so happy about it. I always try to drop helpful stuff for lower level players. If I have extra plans or important items (like the clown costume), I leave them in the hallway in white springs. Someone saw the clown costume and was stoked! Love the nice players!
---
looks like the TSE's on ebay will triple in price now. Let the bidding wars begin.
---
Probably will cause bugs, but my guess is that they would either just make them 2 shot or explosive. Not both. While it would be a headache, it’s still better than completely removing a legendary effect
---
Weren't they going to release a mode where you would be the only person on the map all together?
---
...that is unless the asshole who one-shot murdered me, while on Pacifist mode, was using one of these suped up weapons.
---
Just makes my Assassins Sentinel build even hard to kill. Thanks Bethesda 
---
Maybe they (other player) were AFK/AFC since they were crouched. I dunno but this stuff is not uncommon and part of the game play. 
---
There's nothing remotely hard about having to pump 20 bullets into an enemy instead of 10. Just means you spend less time exploring and more time farming mats for ammo. 
---
&gt; the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world 
---
what does that even mean, was there a mod that gave weapons the two-shot legendary effect?
---
How so? It doesn't say they are removing them. Its says that they will not drop in the world anymore. It says nothing about removing existing ones.
---
They're the same thing. Legendary effects are mods that can't be player-changed.
---
Yea but it's not exactly nice for new players to be unable to attain legacy items that are actually highly desirable. 
---
i can add 150 shots .45 
---
Two shots are being legacied *and* nerfed. Instigating and Bloodied will take over as being better
---
I always liked sniper builds and thats what i do and i play with friends help them out. I just hit a cap on solo accomplishments. I will be rebuilding my camp as soon as someones in my spot again for something to do. And id love to try differnt rifles but at 20lbs a piece and my hoarding habits cant really accomplish that. That saying i dont get armour drops on every legendary
---
Dammnnn I would love a sweet roller like that.
---
What is ur gamertag 
---
I'm sure I'm going to catch hell for this but unless I misunderstand what they're saying:
---
&gt; the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world
---
is an absolutely amateurish mistake. Is this an indie dev team? No these are experienced developers and game makers with a proven record of successful games. How are they making such an ignorant decision? Don't feed me that "but it's their first multiplayer game!" nonsense. Developers and publishers don't live in a vacuum. They look at their competitors, they look at their fans, they're not blind to what keeps people playing and what works for other games. 
---
Someone in a management position at bethesda is either power tripping or critically out of touch with reality. When this patch goes live the players without two-shot weapons will be unhappy that these superior weapons exist but(aside from trading) are no longer available. If reducing the damage to +25% wasn't enough of a nerf to justify keeping the legendary effect then either remove the effect from the game entirely, or nerf it harder.
---
The whole RNG legendaries was the worst idea Bethesda ever had
---
'slap damage' is still annoying as hell for PvE only players.   This is why I generally dislike online games in general...there are always jackasses out there that live to make others miserable - no matter how difficult!
---
I already stopped playing weeks ago.  The game, its contents and problems got old. 
---
If nobody is buying them then they are shit. Drop them and move on. Or don’t drop them and be encumbered.
---
I've been playing a mixed build.  I only go into power armor in Nuke Zones.
---
For the rest of the game I'm busy trying to grind better normal armor.
---
Try using Power Armor less, it makes the game more challenging :)
---
Alternatively you can always go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits and buy fusion cores there.  Lots of people selling them now.
---
Imagine the poor souls using just 2 Shot guns. Lmao. Explosive is soooooooooo much more powerful.
---
They'd probably run into all kinds of issues re music and broadcasting rights here
---
What type of loot?
---
So true. Also I just realize that the increase in rarity of them may cause dupers to duplicate them like crazy now which will help devs to identify cheaters and ban them. Lol. It's actually smart. Though duplication still needs to be stopped in general. It's a fundamental issue with the game.
---
Considering it myself 
---
Seeya
---
Because i just typed it on my mind and didnt think on what to call players
---
Sucks. Mainly because I haven't found one yet. And it was my favourite in FO4
---
You must be projecting my inner monologue. Nice psychic ability. Too bad you couldn't translate that talent into better arguments. Oh well!
---
You seem to be under the impression that I created the idea of TSE weapons, sorry to burst your bubble but im not a bethdev. You also seem to not realize that there will always be powerful weapons in every game and people instantly flock to OP things because it is by definition the best thing to use.  
---
Theres so many other weapons that will one shot - basically any melee build, the dragon, etc. so youre basically out of luck. Try an arcady FPS then if youre that set on balanced weapons... oh wait, those games also have people crying about OP guns or playstyles.
---
&gt;can noobs get the loot i hope?
---
They used to contain instanced loot for anyone who opened it, but the recent patch made them locked to whoever called it in, so if the noobs pick the lock they'll get a bounty.
---
I agree but the critical ones like duping can and will be.
---
A lot of the little bugs I actually enjoy it at least amuse me.
---
Oh word! I haven't seen these, thanks! 
---
I haven't seen anything with crippling or lucky tier 2 effects yet. 
---
Also what will be the difference between crippling and kneecapper? 
---
I agree with you
---
And no one is buying them they are shitty! /s  
---
Gotcha
---
Now we have to solve this mystery ! 
---
I'd like one too, but you know what I'd really like?  To be able to clean that freaking cooking stove.  I mean really, I can build a functional Fusion Generator, but I can't scrub my oven and fix the door?  Jesus.
---
:(
---
PvP free for all is not the game they sold...
---
The nerf will do nothing to TSE shotguns as they only gain 1 pellet anyway. 
---
X/Explosive for everything probably means Explosive should probably be looked at next.
---
already got them. Download the launcher on PC to get them
---
Ugh why isnt there a f76 battle royale. Ugh. 
---
But I don't even PvP??? I just don't have enough time in my life for bullet sponge fallout. My tse was literally this games only attraction. 
---
Yes, the ore update really f'd over workshop usefulness.  That combined with the "claim workshop, fast travel, kill player" deal, just not worth it.
---
The only exceptions in my mind are ones with junk piles (love junk collectors) and fusion core generators.  The ammo factory isn't even worth it anymore.
---
Goodbye unbalanced OP shit :)
---
I really don't beleive the nerf will be as much impact as they are making it seem. It was worded very strange and TSE will still be strongest.
---
Well, if it's opt-in, then it may very well isolate those players to their own devices so that the rest of us can play normally.  :)
---
Nope! Love the change! Makes me happy!
---
You know, I get why people would be annoyed about the nerf/removal, but to be honest, I'm okay with it. Two shot is a boring legendary effect. It's just a flat damage increase. I might feel differently if it actually shot two projectiles, but it doesn't.
---
Im super angry, they need to not do it. Its completely retarded and out of touch. 
---
All valid points. So you could use any of these actually good reasons for keeping the event, instead of just saying "it's quick xp" when there are much better quick xp?  Even a non-nuked whitesprings is more xp in 2 minutes, and the mass amount of robots is great for lead, steel, and aluminum as well.  I have never gotten a non-shit plan from it.
---
And no, I can't ignore it. Friggen everytime I go to flatwoods to sell to vendor, it puts me in this event. I wish they made it to where you had to op-in for an event, instead of being automatically put in it and having to go drop the quest.
---
Yeah they fixed the hit detection on plasma weapons, idk about the muzzle flash though
---
Hardly baseless I base my opinion on plenty of factors. 
---
There are hermit crabs in fo76.
---
Forget flames, you want some RAINBOW LASERS.
---
Like the unicorn weapon in Red Faction Armageddon.
---
The nerf isn't going to make the TSE shotgun any weaker, it only gains 1 pellet anyway so it will retain almost the same damage.
---
The confusing aspect is that you use a weapon bench to modify a weapon. Where as the legendary effects come as is on the weapon - pre-modded if you will. Because lots of us associate modifications with something we personally do to the weapon rather than something that came with the weapon when we got it, the choice of using “mod” to refer to the legendary “mod” or effect can be confusing to some.
---
Let's be honest, there's a non-zero chance that in the course of nerfing two shot weapons Bethesda will turn them into three shot.
---
Yes that's what I told you.  For example, I'll now type something I know to be difficult to understand (making it my fault):
---
Did you just tell me that my failure to understand is mine? If so cheers to anyone who thinks so.  Do you think so, if so screw you.  
---
:)
---
Sadly has not been explained into detail yet by Bethesda. The trade off with the accuracy and only +25% damage is not worth it imo.
---
Yea plus if you throw on your scrounger and pharma farmer perks, always good for extra ammo and drugs if you use them
---
I wouldn't expect you to see a difference in the number of legendary enemies.  What those legendary enemies drop, though, that's the question.  Does your friend with high luck get better drops?  Does he always get 3* drops from 3* enemies?  Does he get higher rated drops than the enemy rating?  Does he get more desirable legendary effects? (like maybe a two shot rifle instead of a nocturnal rolling pin)
---
\+25% over normal version with a drop in VATS accuracy is not a game breaking ordeal.  
---
Bloodied or instigating are more ideal at this point.
---
Dupers trying to make as many TSE weapons as possible before the next patch. Probably going to start selling them for real money after they're no longer available.
---
Past level 50, you can move a perk point instead of taking a card. You can always fix it.
---
I don't like dudes touching my junk
---
I personally try to find legit sellers, but I understand why you did what you did. Essentially a non TSE ballistic or energy weapon... is useless and burns through all your ammo in 30min.
---
I feel like it should be able to hold the full amount that it produces. 😑
---
Personally I don’t mind the nerf. This will make other legendary effects relevant. It’s super boring that the only good/seeked out legendaries are the TSE weapons when it comes to ranged. If killing the queen is too difficult I’m sure she’d get nerfed due to people’s complaints. As for deathclaws and other enemy types, please, they’re not hard to kill. 
---
smart! thanks
---
I wonder if something happened with ingame mouse acceleration or something along those lines. I usually bump my mouse's resolution up a notch from my default since the in game one is rather pokey. I might have to play with mouse, game, and os mouse settings tonight see if I can figure it out. 
---
I mean is it really a big nerf though.  Cause isn't the second projectile lower damage than the base weapon of the gun? And not to mention it's highly sporadic in terms of where it actually goes. Sure you can buff the accuracy and get it to be a bit better. But as soon as you actually need it to go where you want it hits the ground. Don't get me wrong I have plenty of tse weapons. More than the average player. 
---
We weren’t even in combat it was towards the end. I play on Xbox tho sorry can’t play with you. Thanks for the offer though! 
---
Yeah, there's a house on the rocks above and some other structures, but I haven't found any relation to the safe just yet.
---
It only holds 2 at a time
---
Better only get regular explosive since two shot is being nerfed
---
I can see why you read it that way, but considering two shot currently only exists as a legendary effect and not a mod you can apply to a gun I think it's more likely they meant two shot will no longer be a legendary effect on legendary weapons found after the patch.
---
Yes and the enclave medical terminal sells stimpak and a few other good meds
---
don't forget that you get a reload speed buff from strange in numbers. I'm also pretty sure that squad maneuvers affects reload speed. There is a cap on reload speed, like all other things
---
You can add me on PC if you need more anchors, I only leave a server if I CTD or get disconnected. It will help me out, because I dont have many people on my friends list that still play and I run into the same issue :p
---
I thought they could do a grid system, where the camp circle fits in the grid square then it would just drop your base in one that isn’t occupied:
---
RIP my plain 2shot Gatling gun that has carried me the past 40 levels :( 
---
Yeah, one of the most un-sung mutations in my loadout.
---
After every fight, heal right back up.
---
In a nuke zone, not aggro'd?  Hit a radaway and watch your health zip right back up.
---
This mutation also lets me help newbies with extra stimpacks.  I carry 40 normal stimpacks, anything above that or any super stimpacks all 100% go to newbies :)
---
p.s.  **Super Secret side benefit.**.........you don't need to crouch to find out if you're still considered "in combat".  If you see your health NOT going back up, it means there's at least 1 more enemy somewhere within aggro range (if you crouch you'll see either "caution" or "danger" to confirm).
---
username checks out
---
diluted is better than regular. Just heal when you get down a little bit. no need to wait till halfway. and I get 4 diluted from 1 regular with chemist... overall you get twice the healing power when you use chemist and break them down to diluteds...
---
On that note, how about 'concentrating' *Diluted* back into Stimpacks, and I guess regular into *Super*?
---
Also, why is there seemingly no recipes for them? It seems the game forces you to have to vendor them, but you'd think you would find a *Diluted* recipe early on, then the regular, and so on.
---
Even so Two Shot is significantly better than ANY OTHER legendary effect.
---
All you have to do is unlock it, once its unlocked nobody will be wanted for looting it.
---
Maybe they're adding it in as a mod? That's the only thing that came to mind when I reread it. The wording is goofy
---
Its a lining mod for raider underarmor, so you need to mod some to see it as a modify option
---
Don't let the door hit you on your way out 👋
---
Haha, I love the way you put that but yes, I agree. 
---
I'd go for an instigating explosive one instead tbh. Two shot kind of useless next patch.
---
That’s a mod plan basically. You need raider under armor to apply it to, such as raider leathers, road leathers, or harness 
---
It does? I thought the sonic attacks counted as energy damage so you wanted energy resist and refractor grants that.
---
I'm also pretty sure they said they were not going to do this PvP rule change....but are listening to user feedback.  So who knows...
---
Private instances would do it for me as well. However, I think a PvE only opt-in would be easy to implement and would work well. 
---
I get paid to fix things people "say" are unfixable every day. This isn't an unsolvable problem, as long as they keep working at it. 
---
5 disconnects within the last 40 mins (3 in the last 15) and i don't normally get them so i definitely agree.  
---
Was going to make a post myself, hopefully this one will get some up votes. 
---
I tried to do the base under mama dolches and got disconnected 3 times before reaching the checkpoint, it's not even that big.   
---
I have given up and shut down the game for now.
---
What you need to know is these will be separate servers and not the standard for all.
---
When something like this becomes the single most sought after item in the game it’s always because it’s too over powered. 
---
Well, it's not like it's mandatory being that it's a new totally optional gamemode, but you do you.
---
That metal box next to the PA racks across from the MODUS vendor where you can buy x01 Mods. Please right there, that's the spot.
---
I'm actually going to sugar grove if there's something there
---
Yeah lucky hole is great. I am a little low on steel and acid right now. But I just realized I never had steel tagged for searching so that should help. I know snallygasters have a good supply of acid, what region are they mostly in?
---
Yay more server space!!
---
Its a modification for Raider Harness and Road Leathers (maybe a couple more), but it is a mod for underarmor, not an underarmor plan itself.
---
This might help ... https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/
---
Wow.  That's a lot of stat boosts.  What do you use to get numbers like that?
---
I don't like it.
---
"it just works"
---
It’s an alternate mode that they’ve discussed as opt in. They are likely referring to PvP enabled servers/characters. Based on the use of the term “new mode” over and over we can assume it will exist at the same time as other modes (like current, normal play). I think you’re overreacting a bit. 
---
Yes... for those of us who use these the way they're intended. We're getting punished because of dick heads.
---
Has anyone said that this could be similar to blueprinting your CAMP?  Instead of structures you would have cards. 
---
Wow u so smart. Cheers to you if that's what you think.  To the rest of you, go back to sippy cup and fortnite.
---
They’re common in the savage divide for me
---
**It's FuCKiNg RAw**
---
Looking fo one as well
---
They completely missed the point and are not address the root issue, which is explosive weapons and bobbleheads
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah07in/thanks_for_the_inside_the_vault_but_i_think_you/
---
If I wanted such a weak comeback, I'd wipe it off your crippled sister's chin.
---
Why are they exploring a server type like this over a peaceful pve one though?
---
I totally agree! Bethesda remove explosive weapons or even better implement explosive ammunition (expensive to craft). This game will soon lose it fun and be just a resource grinding simulator.
---
Probably a bit premature until they actually provide details. It's possible that it will be optional. 
---
https://youtu.be/mcDgOGC5Lcc
---
&gt; Do you honestly think they're going to change the entire world to be constant PvP?
---
I want to say now but their handling of pvp to begin with, and now two-shot weapons makes me wonder. It's possible they would make that change.
---
Bye bye
---
Ugh.
---
Honestly who is complaining about being killed by someone with a TS weapon (not TSE, huge difference)? That can’t be right. Explosive weapons are wayyyyyyyyyy more powerful and TS just adds an additional projectile to explode on impact. The actual ballistic damage of two shot weapons is balanced. They needed to focus on changing the % damage increase of the tiers in Demolition Expert. 
---
What about when you and I are doing the same event, and you one-shot all the enemies before I can even get a hit in?
---
I agree with this actually, I love playing fallout but don't like PvP and the way things are now even if you're in passive and don't want to PvP people can still take you down in a few shots. 
---
Yes cuz Bioware will never ever nerf op weapons.
---
Bloodied does 150% bonus, TS only 100%.
---
Holotape holder would also be cool...
---
Cool man. Can I have your stuff (PC)?
---
Ganking was under attack.  You've just changed the meaning of your words through further and further clarification.  You should just type it correctly the first time.   
---
Never got this video. I talked to streamers after you said this and they all said the problem was still there. I saw one guy using a Gatling gun and it was doing  it and it's fire rate is super slow. I wish they would fix this. This game breaks my heart.
---
That's how I took this. It was an opt-in type of thing. Honestly I rarely run into issues with people being dicks, and if they are I grab my explosive dragon and usually does the job to atleast even the score. Most I had was a guy shooting my base with something explosive it seemed like. Followed him to his base (was wanted) and waited for him to come out. Dropped him at his door step, thanks for the junk jack ass.
---
Rideable too. 
---
The second great duping war has begun. Don't understand why anyone would want a two shot anything after the change though. Even Junkie weapons would give you more damage hahahaha.
---
If anything they should stack duration and not multiplier... it's kinda insane they went this way and didn't anticipate the shenanigans.
---
No thank you. I played EverQuest. Travel between continents took like a half an hour if you didn’t use magic. 
---
* uranium fever, one violent night, lode baring, it's a trap
---
* The messenger, patrol duty, escort missions are dull in every game and should be excluded where possible
---
* undecided
---
* more varied multi-star legendary events with unique themes such as a Mr.Fuzzy ghoul at camden park
---
* many daily events don't feel particularly rewarding
---
You could nerf whatever base weapon it is and the level I am and the build I have I can still have a ridiculously op weapon. Exsplosive or 2 shot dossent matter.
---
How am I upset? I just made a statement and then provided supporting evidence that I'd seen in game. Then I followed by asking if there is some concept I am misunderstanding with the post.
---
Not everyone that attempts discourse is doing g so to be a dick. 
---
You really don't think an explosive automatic or shotgun even without two shot is OP when stacked with the relevant gun perks and explosive perks? Hell, skip the gun perks and just have the explosive perks stacked and an explosive automatic or shotgun will still completely annihilate everything (and non-explosive ammo is way cheaper/easier to make or obtain in large quantities).
---
Yep that would work for me as well.  In fact, that would probably be the best solution.  
---
Maybe find out what they are actually doing with PvP before making dramatic grandstanding statements.
---
Yeah, to pay for them is ridiculous, you are right. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
I honestly don't mind if those people leave. If they want to PVP only with people they severely overpower, they are just trolls. People who enjoy PVP for PVPs sake want the challenge.
---
The 'Inventory Wheel' is much easier when you press 'F' and it comes up on your screen, from there you can completely customize it by pressing 'C' (i think) to change what's in them.
---
It's way more obtuse than the favorites were in FO4, but it's what we have to work with.
---
This gives me such a good chuckle. Nobody want's your items not even yourself, but you are dragging them with you because they... erhm...  are sticky? :p
---
Was that implemented recently? Because I've bought tons of stuff from vendors and have never seen their cap count go up. My biggest gripe with the trading system, how it's not like it's been in every other Bethesda title, even previous Fallout ones at that. If this has been fixed I'd be crazy happy 
---
Not with vats teleporting im sure that nerf is next
---
I can melee enemies before anyone gets a hit in too. At what point is it asshole players instead of a weapon issue. 
---
Dude yeah I have 5 in my camp rn and it’s so annoying to take them all out. Find the right one. Grab the other 4 put them back in the camp and go
---
I’d say keep it, because you won’t be able to get one in a drop after the next patch. I have 2 shot missile launcher that I am sad will now be less impressive but I plan on keeping it anyway.
---
I think two shot and explosive legendary traits should both be removed from the game personally. I had an explosive sub machine gun in Fallout 4 and loved it for the first couple sessions I used it, but then I realized it made the game less fun. So I stopped using it. I was very disappointed they decided to keep that trait in Fallout 76 and knew as soon as someone reported finding one that it would unbalance the game. 
---
But even if it gets nerfed. Isn't 25% damage the same as what the other projectile is doing with the 2shot? Or was that fixed? 
---
I agree, the only reason I run demo expert is because of how much of a damage increase I get... otherwise I'd run power patcher. What they should do is nerf Demo Expert to a 2 Star Card with 25% more damage each rank.
---
Looks like my Two Shot Handmade just got more valuable but less useful 😑
---
It will attract the pvp centric crowd to that gameplay and further separate them from the pve players.
---
What rifle perk cards are you using? I have demo expert 5 on and all three rank 1 rifleman perk cards and do 450 damage with the handmade.
---
Wait did they actually announce a TSE Nerf? 
---
My buddy ran into this last night.
---
Transfer all junk into your inventory.
---
Scrap all junk.
---
Transfer junk into your stash.
---
You should now be able to craft.
---
Surface to Air is hell. The damn mobs spawn INSIDE the damn AA turret. lol
---
I’ve gotten him twice and he died while doing transaction both times. I took video each time. No wonder you can’t ever find him. And he hasn’t had an outfit on him I don’t have yet. 😢 I try to spawn him several times a day. I’ve gotten more Mothman than responder not. Lol
---
I don't think Sugar Grove would have anything people haven't already found. Unless the key only shows once you've tried to open the safe (unlikely)
---
Do you have definitive proof? Those are some big claims.
---
Yeah, i can't stand how I miss way more often than not in VATS, even when the percentage is always near-maxed.
---
I think you'll find that a lot of players dont enjoy difficult games. Look at Bethesda's previous games. End game is always easy mode. Bethesda wants to make money. They want players to stick around and buy cosmetics. They aren't going to up the difficulty and tell their player base to git gud.
---
I didn't see an option for "yes, I am ok with them being here because they are allowed to be here but no, I don't want them to pretend they are not employees."
---
Yet another example of a great potential solution.
---
I'm inclined to agree with you, before joining a server there should be an option to go pvp or pacifist. I'm not a huge pvp player but I love the randomness of other real world players scampering about doing their own thing and I do enjoy helping lower level players on their journey.  What I don't enjoy is little shits blowing holes in my C.A.M.P walls or tickling me with their bullets, that annoys me more than mole rats tbh. But which ever direction they choose I'll still be playing the game the way I want to and enjoy it. 
---
I don’t think they want to add beaver meat to the game regarding the innuendos associated with beavers 😂🤷🏼‍♂️
---
ahh gotcha! 
---
It would be simpler to just divide the explosive mod by the number of rounds.  This would preferentially nerf the shotgun explosions, and tone down the two shot ones.
---
Too bad the people complaining are whiny millennial fags so you will never make these daffodils happy.
---
I think that when Super Duper procs, it gives a bonus equal to what you'd get without the bonuses given by other perks. So Super Duper would give a 30% chance of giving 6 diluted stimpacks, not 8.
---
Thats how it works when making ammo with Ammosmith anyway. I'm not totally sure if it works the same way with Chemist. 
---

---
I got this so far :D 
---
Wish it had more stars but it's still fun, when I sneak with it and get a headshot it can one shot most enemies except the level 68 super mutants or deathclaws etc
---
You said more than any other legendary effect is capable of - objectively not true. Yes, it's difficult, but not true. It's also not without cost - there's a massive accuracy penalty on TS weapons. Try using a plain TS weapon and see if you can hit anything at range - it's really fucking hard. TSE is only effective because the AoE compensates for the accuracy somewhat - shotguns will still completely miss many pellets at any kind of range, but 50% of them getting splash damage is enough to be effective.
---
The T part thusfar
---
they need to rebuff the loot drops too becuase if your spending all those resources to kill a "hard" enemy you should actually want to again they way i see it why should i even waste ammo on a behemoth that takes 4 clips
---
The munitions factory? Grafton Steel Plant? First two off the top of my head that might apply.
---
Then the game would FLOOD with 1* explosive weapons which would still overpower many 3* weapons with bad combinations. Explosive being 2* is fine, they should have moved 2 shot to the second star not the other way around.
---
TS was hands down the best modifier on shotguns Excluding explosive. Which I refuse to use because it's stupid amounts of broken.
---
This hurts shotguns. 
---
It would be a start for sure. Not sure about it being only 1 point though. One idea that i've seen tossed around that I like, is have set bonuses. It's an online game, why not? For wearing all combat armor, you get "X". So on and so forth.
---
No, it's not, I'll finish the game by that time and won't be back probably - I've enjoyed TSE's...
---
check new posts, every second post talks about it
---
Show evidence to that because I've seen tons of videos and tests that say otherwise. My Quad explosive double barrel does almost exactly the same damage as my TSE double barrel. I think if every pellet did more damage then they would be further apart. 
---
i guess there was a mod that dropped 2 shot for weapons, they removing that not the actual two shot weapons
---
Well as Bethesda has asked.
---
If the PvP isn't a server select thing I'll play each new content but not much more.  I respect others in the Community who want more PvP, but as an individual I don't want more.  
---
At LVL 127 having almost all CAMP Plans, I just pass on most Events, unless it's to help out, lower level players.  So I tend to fast travel, but helping is worth a few Caps.
---
TSE, well people have mostly complained on here, so I get why Bethesda has reacted.  Can't help but think it's what happened in GOW, with nerfing over months and months.  Until everyone seemed to be happily unhappy.  Played Whitesprings Nuke the other day and a melee build was one hitting everything  couldn't even get a TSE shot on things, even if I had been using mine. So what's next.
---
Improvements I'd like to see is increasing the Stash, maybe stepping up by player level.   I'd also like to see the build Cap altered upwards maybe 10 or 20%.  Final thing would be to protect certain items, based on player setting.  Something asked for in previous games but never put into place 
---
Considering the lies and dishonesty since launch? Not suurprised really.
---
Hell yes, i’ve nearly replaced my face I spent hours building/tweaking with the presets countless times.
---
And all water production is capped at 12 per hour, no matter how many purifiers you have. More purifiers just means more storage before they are full (so less frequent stops to empty). I use 5 industrial that hold 25 water. I only make it back to my camp every two hours or so, so that's the right amount of storage for my playstyle.
---
The industrial water purifier at Charleston Landfill does seem to produce 60/hr (5 every 5 minutes and then it is full). But ones you place collectively seem to only produce a total of 12/hr no matter how many you have.
---
So I'm doing more damage than my pip boy says?
---
You'll see after it goes into place that it's not very special at only +25%
---
I've always thought two-shot was a dumb legendary modifier anyway. Doesn't really do anything interesting like the other modifiers do, it just outright doubles your damage. Makes it 100% required if you want to be competitive damage-wise in any way.
---
This is a good point, too many game developers take the nerf everything into existence route instead of buffing other things.  Stick instead of carrot.  If you nerf a lot of folks tend to get upset, if you buff a lot of the under performing things it encourages people to go do other things instead and it's generally a happier bunch.  I am not sure how this could be accomplished without a pretty large weapon overhaul.
---
Maybe? I've only been playing since shortly after Christmas so I can't say how it was before, but it's always been like this for me.
---
Note you don't get your full caps in the register once you buy. It's some percentage. Like if you buy something that's 250 caps, it'll only add like 50 caps to the vendor amount. But it does add something anyway
---
So am I reading it correctly, they are leaving current ones in existence but nerfing them, and stopping any future drops?
---
Found my third ever last night, 2 shot black powder...
---
Frankly I won't miss em. My alternative is shooting at enemies twice with handmade versus once. 
---
Eh, I see their reasoning, as much as I hate it. Most affixes up damage by a meager amount and when it does get to double or 50% it has modifiers like target must be at full health or below 40% health. Having an affix that has double damage no matter what devalues every other mod.
---
Now, I do agree with you on the explosive. I know it's *kind of* fair since to get the most out of the affix you need the 5 INT to make the explosive shine. However, I don't want to be forced to:
---
1. Get an explosive gun to be on par with everyone else 
---
2. Dump perk points into a perk I'd never want in the first place. 
---
It just takes a lot out of build variety when, to be on par, you are forced to dump 9 in PER or STR or AGI and another 5 into intelligence just so you can do the same amount of damage against the guy shooting you. And that's on top of your 5 into gunsmith so your weapon doesn't break. That's 19 points that are essentially taken up by "the meta."
---
If they are moving towards balance, they need to remove the 100% explosive damage bonus the explosive affix gets so that it is more in line with the previously mentioned affixes (instigating and executioners).
---
Explosive legendary weapons are the God build, even more so now that two shot is losing it's teeth.
---
It will definitely put my nuts in a twist if the Nerf them.  I've grinded out hundreds of hours to finally find one legitimately just a few days ago.  If they make all of that effort for naught, I'm going to have a hard time putting any time or stock into going further with the game.
---
I can just oneshot lvl 91 glowing deathclaw whit deathclaw gauntlet (non legendary) so really those are not tough maby queens are harder for reason to kinda make people play together.  well even 3* legendary mirelurk queen is not tough u can easy solo that whitout powerarmor or whitout eny stimpack used. So maby ur build dont fit to ur weapons? 
---
Nope that's not it.
---
this would by far be the better idea, removing the TS from game is just gonna make the players who have them be more arrogant about it, dropping the existing ones to +25% instead of double damage will just spoil the TS guns that don't have the explosive effect. After 500 hrs of play since the "BETA" I haven't even found a TS gun, most likely because I don't spend all my time farming Whitespring, I actually play the game.
---
This is some tin foil hat stuff. Also don’t care if they do. 
---
- Bethesda Customer Service
---
1/2/3 so...60% bonus i think.
---
Its hardened of course.
---
Maybe Mama Dolces?
---
Two-shot isn't a necessity by any means. I don't use it because I hate the accuracy penalty. Instigating is better for sniping. Bloodied is better for anything if you're willing to sit at low hp. Anti-armor's potentially better if you're not at point blank and it's not an explosive weapon.
---
You're right that they're nerfing the wrong thing though. Explosive is ridiculously far ahead of any other second-star effect, mitigates the weakness of two-shot and makes real explosive weapons pointless. Melee damage stacking on STR is far too high. Too many different effects stack on low hp. Even VATS crits stacking and stealth are probably more broken than two-shot.
---
Do you think that's easy to create for them? I have no idea but would assume a game that's announced, launched and tested as a multiplayer game wouldn't suddenly change.
---
Imagining myself in the shoes of a developper, and assuming it's a lot of work to change this, I'd only go ahead with it if it creates more revenue. Besides, they created mechanics that make it rather easy to almost completely ignore pvp.
---
I like pvp, but understand and respect others don't. I just don't think it's realistic they'll change the game so drastically. But maybe I'm wrong, I don't work in this business.
---
That is awesome!!
---
Could you imagine the craziness if you split by worlds? You are here to PVP only in a world of people who also want to PVP. You kill people and break armor for no reason and no real reward considering everyone will be running without junk and the bounties may not be enough.   
---
It's an interesting thought that i think may only be plausible if they added some things that were only in PVP worlds that would drop if you were killed. 
---
Project harder for the cheap seats in the back.
---
This!
---
Didn’t realize it was broken until I was reading last night lol. Made for a super long transaction. 
---
Now I want to see a racoon suit.
---
Yup, it's one of the best options to deal with them really. I have a plethora of them including a two shot hunting rifle, and I welcome the change with open arms. You shouldn't really ever be able to one shot every enemy unless it's a headshot with a big gun or a fat man kinda thing, it's just unhealthy for game longevity.
---
&gt; Is there actually two bullets shot? I'm pretty sure there is not, otherwise we could see it pretty well with missile launchers and fatmen.
---
my 2 shot auto grenade launcher whole heartedly disagrees. It absolutely fires 2 grenades and they fly off in weird directions. It's a garbage gun and I really wish they hadn't nerfed it by removing any effects that heavy weapons perks applied to it. 
---
Even without 2 shot at all the difference in damage between my quad explosive and TSE double barrel is only about 60-70. With no two shot my quad explosive double barrel is still doing over 1000 damage. I think the shotguns will be fine.
---
I'm a two handed melee and I'd be ok with having to 3 shot this seems fair
---
No. I haven't been on in a few days.  
---
VATS tends to work quite well for me and I go with the same mods you suggested. I will try and keep an eye out for a better lever rifle. I would like to find a place to farm them from time to time to get all the mods for it.
---
I can get behind that
---
Three rabbits always spawn up the hill from the service entrance to the Enclave Bunker (the hill the main entrance is built into).
---
Your grammar and spelling is appaling... also you're just proving my point on how melee is what needs to be nerfed. Thanks for that at least.
---
I would eat beaver all day if I could.
---
I've seen him 2 or 3 times in the past week. He seemed to be doing a clockwise path around the main roadway/center of map each time?
---
Can't say that's the norm, but it's where I've seen him and Moo Moo. I have seen Moo Moo one time without Graham being around as well.
---
saumäsig, das darfst du glauben. :)
---
Im a loot whore, what can I say. This is the worst type if nerf for me. 
---
Ah fair enough. Rereading it under that context, I get what you're saying. I probably should have written it more clearly.
---
I was more asking if I was missing a certain item type that I don't use very often, like Big Guns, and the perk is currently glitched. To my knowledge the only ones that weren't working we're rifleman (for Gauss) and commando, but they fixed those. Was more asking if _I_ was wrong. 
---
Either way, sorry to appear snappy. Have a good one! 
---
Theyre cutting the bonus damage by 75%. They don’t want to say that. 
---
At the beginning of the game I found it immensely frustrating not coming across any randomly wandering legendaries (as it was in F4). I much later found out that legendaries are only spawned in specific places and during some events. So your chances of stumbling upon one without the sole aim of grinding them is close to none. Thus,  at level 30 I still hadn't had a simple legendary, not even a bloody rolling pin.
---
Thus, you are more or less forced to grind the hotspots, namely golf club, to try your luck and get something actually fun and worth using.
---
I wish they would make legendary spawn rates higher in random places across the map. That way people wont congregate too much at the hot spots and make it into a lag fest.
---
Straight up whomever came up with this 2 shot nerf is an idiot. So many people will stop playing now. Fucking ruinining your own dam game. Absolutely lazy and pathetic fix. You should be ashamed for even thinking it was a good idea. I love this game but I feel fucked over. I spent tons of time finding the right weapons.
---
They already dealt with explosives. They buffed fireproof that needs to be it. If people cry because they get killed by an explosive weapon but they don’t want to use fireproof that’s on them. Don’t nerf explosives even more for PvE because of PvP. Enough already. 
---
Yes this needs to be an option. 
---
Make sure you have weapon artisan and get both the minigun and flamer to 200% before the fight. Don't lay on the trigger. Feather it in bursts so you get more luck of the draw procs. If you have a crit build, maybe build your crit meter and see how many you can cycle in. Bring AP regen/restore aid items and hot key them to continue building crits with those weapons. Canned coffee is good for AP regen and can be found in kitchens. Nuka quantum is sold by most vendors (usually just 1 per), but you're guaranteed to get one nuka quantum from the soda vendor per server log on. The vendor is upstairs in whitesprings resort.
---
I want drivable vehicles
---
I never saw that mod if it did exist then hopefully that is what they meant and not that they are removing one of the few good legendaries.
---
Non explosive I agree. 
---
Could they not have just made the demolitions expert perk card do reduced damage for the legendary effect specifically? 
---
That way grenades and true explosive weapons like the missile launcher wouldn't be hurt, but the TSE weapons wouldn't be as good. 
---
Maybe it is a little more complicated than that? idk 
---
Well imo they need a nerf because they are way too damaging. Idt any weapon should be able to decimate every monster in the game (TSE shotguns being by far the worst) but I just hope the go about it in the right way. Honestly I think the Two shot and explosive should be mutually exclusive. 
---
At the same time big guns and laser weapons need a huge buff because they are jokes right now. Just my opinion tho
---
bobbleheads shouldnt stack in your inventory either and become single items that way people with thousands of bobbleheads would have their inventory flooded and be barely usable.
---
Do you have any luck with this? I tune in pretty often and get zero fights.
---
I don't have any issue with funding the development with solely cosmetic items.  If it isn't P2W I'm ok.
---
They should make bobbleheads function like they did in fallout 4. Just be a permanent stat boost and make it so if people have more than 1, the stats can't be boosted by the same type of one. Same thing with magazines. I agree about explosive being moved to the first pool of prefixes that can be obtained. Eliminates 2 shot explosives and creates better balance. There is no need to eliminate 2 shot all together 
---
Well yes instigating is better for you sniper types. But for those of us who are putting out the DPS... It's a necessity.
---
It lists what factories you need to take pictures of, click on the challenge. The only one you might not be able to find is the Atomics Factory as no one knows what it is. The rest are easy, all the power plants, nuke, tygart water plant etc. You only need 5
---
The legendary has to do with the enemies level
---
It's easy to confirm. Just loot a container right before you log out at the end of a day and it will be empty when you log back in. Been that way since beta (unless this patch changed it, haven't played this patch yet). Looted some ammo containers before a forced log out in an early beta and the next week when we could play it was still empty (and it wasn't looted by anyone else since I logged in as soon as beta went back up).
---
&gt;Ok bud, dont get so angry that someone has an idea that doesn't seem to pertain to you.
---
I'm not your bud, pal. You confuse anger with bluntness. It's okay though people get emotional and defensive on the internet all the time when faced with confrontation, no biggie.
---
&gt; The patch notes a few patches ago said it changed flux spoil time from 30min to 10min so 3 to 4 hours cant be right.
---
I'll concede that it certainly isn't 3 to 4 hours, but it also isn't 10 minutes. I'll need a source if this point is to move forward.
---
&gt;All my friends and everyone I have played with liked the idea.
---
&gt; If you dont like it then that's fine, move along but dont come here being hostile for no reason.
---
It's not that I don't like it -- it's just not necessary as many people have no issue farming stable flux. As long as you got the Hardened Mass, Glowing Mass, and High Radiation Fluids ready to go, all you need to do is go to the nuke site and pick the flora with the Green Thumb perk on (x2 yields) and head straight to the chemistry bench. With the aforementioned process being as simple as it is, I don't see how your idea will be taken up by Bethesda.
---
&gt;Do you not having anything better to do?
---
Is that a rhetorical question? I'm on reddit...
---
&gt;Actually I dont care if you do... just move along.
---
Damn the snarkiness is real today. Learn to take some criticism.
---
 You have a good one as well. What ever the case in parks they at least need to not break so easy and have damage that can keep up with ballistic weapons I think.
---
My problem with "having a different gun" for every situation is simple. We don't have the space to carry that many weapons.  My stash is constantly hovering around 550-580 of 600, even after I bulk and sell a lot of stuff. Weapons just weigh far too much to be able to keep more than a few around. 
---
On top of that, removing the effect from the game completely gives those who have one (especially a TSE one) a huge advantage over those who don't as they can't even acquire one now. In the interest of "balance" they just made in unbalanced,  unless they introduce a new effect that gives a +25% increase across the board. 
---
Explosive weapons are far stronger than two shots, yet it doesn't seem like Bethesda has plans to fix them yet. 
---
Finally,  two shot was one of the few perks that allowed guns to keep up with melee's massive damage. Now enemies will just be even bigger bullet sponges, so I'll be spending more time having to farm mats to make bullets while melee are running around smashing things to death. 
---
Thanks for the feedback Bethesda! I feel like communication is the biggest thing us players are looking for. You tell us you're working on stability and quashing dupers, we're happy and can afford to be patient.
---
I would like some sort of official word on game mods. You mention above about using mods to access 'restricted' zones, and I get that, but what about users using Quality-of-Life mods such as the one to show *Known Recipes* or other client-side tweaks?
---
&gt; Changes to the Two-Shot Legendary Mod: The Two-Shot Legendary Mod will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful this mod is, especially when it comes to being the victim of it. With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot legendary modded weapons has been reduced to +25% damage, and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world.  
---
This is absolutely the **wrong** way to go about this.  
---
What next, remove Assassins? It's "frustrating" to be the "victim" of that too!  
---
Chameleon? It sure is frustrating not seeing the enemy...  
---
This is absurd. And I say this as someone who does not have an arsenal of TSE's, I just have my one star two shot shotgun, which I guess is now just a generic trash weapon that happens to have +25% damage.  
---
And worst of all, it **does not actually address the issue**. If this is the path you want to go down there are other weapons that can deal high amounts of damage: Where is The Dragon nerf down to 25%? Auto grenade launcher? Any explosive automatic weapon? Etc.  
---
Meanwhile Gutsy's still fire magic AP howitzers and even rad-rats can hit you with "immersive" seconds long stagger sequences as Scorchbeasts rave-party to lagtown.  
---
And I'm sure it won't be frustrating at all for new players to find out that "two-shot" does not actually fire a proper second shot, it fires some kind of super weakened nerf ball instead after they've been tricked into paying 25k caps for a weapon with a mod nobody can even get anymore.  
---
Better remove trading since it can be frustrating...  
---
If this goes through I think this will be it for me. The only thing I was looking forward to was getting a Two-shot explosive .50 cal. There's no other content for me.
---
Explosives need to be nerfed for PVE. Even without two shot you can easily one shot any enemy with them, and that is not healthy for a "living game" which fallout 76 is meant to be (a stream of new content over time, somewhat like the Destiny platform.)
---
I'm not sure why everyone thinks that balance changes are punishment
---
When teamed up I regularly get up to 20+ strength and 25 agility which are 12 and 15 regularly.  If she was mutated, too, that would be higher.  Endurance is still pretty low, around 3 or so, but if you are doing low health you are one hit anyway, might move some Charisma and Perception into Endurance and leverage the high radiation part of my build beyond the extra strength from that one perk card.
---
Yeah me too. Looked like a fat suit with a tail. Lamo
---
Came here to mention how much I enjoyed Feed The People pre-patch.
---
Further, there should be more events like this. I know that the idea down the line is to make encounters with other players more... tenuous, but I really like the idea of helping others when I can. 
---
No you're doing less. Ever hit an enemy with just the additional shot, and not the main bullet and seen how little damage it actually did? Plus not to mention the fact that when a weapon becomes two shot the hip fire spread or crosshairs become quite a bit more inaccurate 
---
Exactly, all because of some dickheads ruining the fun of people like you and me.
---
Oh yeah, some balancing is certainly needed :) 
---
Yeah I know not everyone cares about decorating but building stylish CAMPs is like 75% of what my wife and I do in-game. This would add a whole universe of "personal touches" that could really make your CAMP shine.
---
Lol. They really need to go in more detail on this. Finger's crossed that it's the ability to choose to play on PvE or PvP servers
---
I can already see the prices exploding 
---
At the same time two shot now only does 25% of its former damage (not entirely sure how they calculate that... like is the Second shot 25% only...?)
---
Wascally wabbits!
---
That’s right. There are hard limits on getting anything back from the seven vendor factions in a 24 hour period. 
---
If you have lots of junk or things to dump, try a post on /r/market76; lots of activity and people buying almost anything for decent prices. 
---
It's still going to be one of the strongest weapons... Not many weapon mods can beat out a constant 25% damage increase. I mean hell the other weapon mods do like what 10% damage increase on average? And those usually have requirements to get the damage out like being addicted or mutated. Before this change two shot is just, hey would you like 100% more damage with no strings attached?
---
That being said I don't feel like this change was necessary and they hit the wrong nail. No one was upset about the TS part of TSE weapons. They're especially fucking up by letting the two shot weapons that exist remain and removing it from world drops. That's just rewarding people who duped them or bought duped guns and punishing self found legit players. Even after the nerf it's still one of the strongest possible legendaries.
---
&gt;We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful [the two-shot] mod is, especially when it comes to being the victim of it
---
That's not quite right.  I've never heard anyone complain that somebody one-shot them with a two-shot weapon.  I think two-shot is balanced just fine.  The problem is the combination of two-shot and explosive.  If you changed 'explosive' to be a prefix modifier instead of a major modifier (like others have mentioned) that would fix the problem.  But, maybe you can't do that for some reason.  How about this.  On any two-shot explosive weapon the second shot doesn't explode.  That would make TSE a bit less overpowered.  Or maybe two-shot and explosive just don't drop together on one weapon, and you update the database so all TSE weapons are now Furious Explosive weapons or something.  That would rebalance things nicely.  As it is the TSE weapon is the one everybody is looking for and if you don't have one you will pretty much always loose PVP to someone who does.
---
Two shots don't need to be removed. That's ridiculous. Just make them use two rounds instead of one and boom. Ammo use goes up and gun overuse goes down. The nerf is acceptable the removal is not.
---
You must have gotten there before me ;)
---
I'm hoping the DLC is another Vault opening up. Giving us new places to explore, and most importantly, NPC's.
---
I'm loving 76, but the world feels very barren and lonely just reading terminals and seeing Robots with 2 lines of speech.
---
Yup total buzz kill
---
Not exactly. 
---
\~to be replaced with da maths in a min\~
---
Experienced this last night on PS4. Unbelievably annoying when trying to set any slider to zero
---
I find it very confusing as well.  The problem was always the Explosives affix, which is op by itself, and also in the wrong tier so it can then stack with stuff like two shot to go completely nuts.  I mean they could just take a bunch of these different affix permutations out in the field and test them to see for themselves.  Did they not do that?  I don't see how you otherwise miss that the explosives part is the problem.
---
I think of the little level 25 player just trying to farm wood for his camp, and 3 high levels come along just to kill him over and over. A forced PvP mode will just make the griefing problem worse. But we will see what happens. I think PvP should be gone all together, and put in its own dedicated servers, where some legendary effects are limited or prevented at all. TSE is not much of an issue except for PvP, for example. I do not think many people complain because it 1-hits mobs, I think they complain because they get 1-hit killed by them. Same with Assassins armor + suppressor + dodgy builds. With those you can get a massive 70-80% player damage reduction, making you physically invincible with stimpaks, there is no manner those builds can be killed by another player.
---
I don’t really care about caps, I play the Fallout franchise for story, world and sometimes rpg (when Bethesda doesn’t kill it off) so I’ll continue to do what I do until there’s something else to do in this game :)
---
Ok, the "bud" thing was to show that I wasnt trying to be super hostile but I guess what I should have said is "ok, loser with too much time on his hands. Maybe you would have liked that better. Also snarky? You started it with that smart ass ending to your 1st response saying "the only quality of life improvement would be for you as you seems to be having an unrealistically hard time getting flux" or something like that. Move along keyboard warrior. 
---
OH I agree! But I just see the reluctance 😂
---
Yeah they could fix it if you could get 2 shot explosives anymore I would be fine with that but just removing 2 shot outright rubs me the wrong way
---
My current toon is a lvl 12 or so, just starting over and refusing to cheat by transferring anything from my other character. So he is avoiding the PvP right now. But during the beta I got my main up to lvl 30 or so and kept tuned to that channel. I would be assigned a target about 25% of the time. 
---
Keep tuning in and tell the other PvP people you see to use it. The only way it can become a functional alternative to rollplaying griefers is if there are targets to hunt when they log in.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
If you need to buff every other option, it's showing how much of a power gap there is. And as I said, explosive still needs to be dealt with.
---
Caustic and flaming will be neat, I'm sure flaming will come out at some point considering it's already on that one 10mm smg whose name is escaping me at the moment
---
No, those that already have one will keep theirs - it’s written in the link 
---
Yeah well i just collect lead steel and gunpowder and have that perk card where i craft 80% more ammo
---
&gt; Power up Poseidon, get 5 fusion cores for all players on the server. 
---
*You are overencumbered*
---
Dude fucking nailed it. Why hit over 10k on a player with like 200-300 hp? I get buffs and perks but stop it at like 1k or somethin that sounds fair af and would let people use other things 
---
I said it is more FREE damage than other perks are capable of, referring to the lack of consequence/situational increase that i explained earlier in that comment. TS is just a flat buff. For comparison, the other flat buffs like mutant/ghoul slayer are 30% and only against very specific enemy types. 
---
 I use several 2 shot weapons and haven’t had the accuracy issues. I just don’t use shotguns/explosives where the accuracy penalty is the most problematic. I have a TS Gatling gun that is basically a sniper rifle. Because TS guns are still effected by stability perks, it works amazing. Same goes for my pistols. I did have a laser pistol once that shot offset V shaped patterns, with one beam going straight and the other to a side, but it also broke in 2 mags. 
---
Only the extra bullets seem effected by the accuracy penalty, and even if those missed half the time I’d be doing 50% more damage than a normal gun, on par with executioners at low health and exceeding the damage of enemy specific perks by 20%. But they don’t miss half the time, realistically it’s more like 15-20% at most for me. So over time doing 80-85% more damage than the gun would normally. The only consequence being that the free bullet that doesn’t consume ammo or durability sometimes misses and slightly reduces the absurd increase to DPS. 
---
No, it's because nobody will buy them and I don't want them in my inventory.
---
Yeah they say that, but I have a feeling that after the nerf somebody will discover some random possum in the woods that drops them 100% of the time.
---
I dont. Lol. Never said I did. Try again.
---
Do you think the perfect storm would be a good weapon against the queen? 
---
You have never been able to get a two shot "mod". Two shot legendary modifiers will be removed from the loot table entirely in the next patch, unless they change their mind. 
---
I could get behind this idea.
---
Removing 2 shot? Lol Bloody explosive new meta
---
You'd be surprised. I've been joining since mid 40s in excavator and I dump my lvl 35 explosive dragon into her, once it breaks I grab my 45 vampires pickaxe and go on add duty. I can pull 2 or 3 lvl 50 scorched and kite them around or pull them off people and dump a few explosives. It got me from lvl 45 to 50 pretty quickly.
---
IF no adds I just shot her in VATS to build up some crits with my Luck perks with a regular mod'd hunting rifle. I am also big on grenades so I always have 15-20 on me. Usually toss those if shes too far away.
---
Yeah, I don't use turrets and am in a low level area, just so I don't have to Live in an empty cube shack with no furniture 
---
I mean, like I get what you are saying and I agree.  But, theres a difference between a difficult game and a game that is moderately hard to play.  At end game with a solid weapon this game is a laughing matter, enemies should if anything hit harder and use more explosives and be just a little smarter.  Idk, I guess I'm just dreaming unfortunately.
---
You mean the mode we are playing now? Yeah, not working very well.
---
people on twitter need to work on their reading comprehension and note that the new pvp is a *MODE*, and not something automatic.
---
How would a two shot harpoon gun, crossbow, black powder rifle, dragon, or broadsider work?
---
Why is it not acceptable besides that you like two shot?
---
Really happy with how this is going especially with the way they're taking care of dupers but I'm hoping they'll adress the Bobblehead stacking issue and back down on the two shot removal since I haven't actually owned a TS weapon and in the least I'd like to try it; maybe just nerf the damage and still let us find TS weapons? 
---
Its ridiculous on how much ammo some  creatures take. I mean melee is more powerfull and easy , it almost makes guns useless
---
No not fixed. Deliberate cap sink strategy which reminds me of Destiny glimmer sinks. Can’t do the perfect trade this for that which was in FO3 and Skyrim etc and worked perfectly when they had stuff you wanted but just items and no caps. 
---
They should work like the magazines. Taking a second should only reset the timer. 
---
Agreed, dupers will just be able to charge more for TSE now. Issue is with explosive not TS.
---
This is a lie just got a 2 Shot Hunting Rifle
---
I can see a bit where your coming from, but really, so far for me, this game has been quite and friendly I'd say. I find more people to be cool and helpful in general. Now Workshops could be different and I think the PVP part of taking those over is fine. If we had a PVP open game mode, then I think you'll find people that want that going that way. I might change my mind if becomes a really huge problem of anyone you run into is simply trying to kill on sight.
---
Its a mode which indicates we can all opt out
---
I did find a throwing plan can’t remember but I found it near where mothman place is. Can’t for life remember what it’s called. Just know it’s far left side of map. 
---
I think it would work better with a visual indicator on the map. Maybe a circle indicating the general area of a hunter/hunted participants
---
When they've made a few more fruit hats they'll probably start working on that
---
I'm just surprised with how small they are. Have you seen a real beaver? Those things are pretty damn big and radiation seems to have increased the size of most fauna in the fo verse. Kind of confusing why they're so small. Opossums and mole rats are bigger than they are. 
---

---
This is my baby &lt;3
---
As do I hence 31,000 rounds of .50 cal and 15,000 .308. Which I have to carry because EVERY high level enemy is a bullet sponge.
---
I didn't say buff every other option, just the really weak ones, the ones that will still be considered very weak if Bethesda keeps moving forward like they do.
---
Where is the stash increase?!
---
Just want to be another voice saying the nerf to two shot is a bad idea. 
---
I have enough caps too. Thanks! I see you added me. 
---
Shoot a wall, it's two projectiles.
---
The explosive legendary effect should be changed to just do exactly what it says in its description. No added damage, just area of effect.
---
Yeah, some of the higher tier ones do spawn in as quest rewards, like the SMG from Cold Case is incendiary, but you can't get something like that from a random drop as far as I can tell.
---
Trying to use the trade menu is problematic at best when someone "wants" to trade you.
---
Now try doing that with a noobie that doesn't know if you're there to say "hi", team up, or kill them.....lol
---
And them making Two-Shot will only worsen the problem.
---
I sincerely hope this is the case. I really do.
---
I just hit 50 and have only recently been exploring the mire at all since around 45. I've found that's probably about the right level, but haven't hit any super serious mobs like that yet. 
---
Best to avoid it for a while except for one really good reason: The vendor there has consistently better stuff (especially plans) and is a separate vendor faction, which is really useful at low levels since you probably only have access to responders, raiders, and whitesprings vendors.
---
Learn to get to the vendor from the fast travel point quickly. From the train-track Y you can head straight into town towards a blast hole a little to the left of the street blockade by the eastern tracks. cut through that building and then run straight up the alley and you're there.
---
Not really, what are you talking about
---
I don't think I ever found a consistent lever rifle world spawn. They'll occasionally show up in locked safes or boss monster corpses. Mostly you craft and scrap, and hope that you don't roll the suppressor last.
---
If that were the case, its the explosive mod that needs a serious nerf, not the two shot. The TS is a nice stopping stone until the HE version drops. I've yet two drop a TSE in over 160 levels. Oh, wait...
---
So the dupers will have a ball, as their stock is invaluable, or am I missing the point?
---
I haven't heard that since high school. 
---
Too bad all the op weapons are going to get nerfed. 
---
In ur mind everything need nerf well maby not game for u then.. Ur right demolition need nerf thats true but melee is for reason higer dmg u cant melee flying things and u haw to be close to hit enything can u say same about rifle or shotgun that do same damage or more whit 2 shot and not risking enything?
---
Something like a behemoth or a scorchbeast or other really bullet spongy enemies should absolutely drop enough stuff to make it worth your while, unfortunately that's been an issue since launch.  But at the same time, it is somewhat of a survival game so finding and crafting ammo still needs to be part of it, but you shouldn't have to worry about crafting ammo the entire time you are playing though.  It's a tough balance.
---
I have a. 50cal aswell but i use the gatling gun more. It shoots slower and most ammo reaches the target
---
Lost a TSE lever action because of this impatience 
---
Maybe it will be good. Maybe PvP will be better. Maybe they will nerf the queen to compensate for the reduction in DPS. Maybe we are overreacting. We will have to wait and see I guess.
---
Or you get the quack surgeon perk and stack up on booze like a good drunk. I’ve only been able to revive people 3 times with booze but it’s great. 
---
I'd disagree for two reasons:
---
(1) you need one-touch stimpack in combat as waiting for the UI to spawn the favorites wheel could be fatal in urgent situations.
---
(2) this reduces commitment to build even further, allowing someone to completely respec with a single touch is balance breaking. It's also lag exploitable in multi-player settings. If someone is going from rifle expert in stealth to melee expert in power armor basically mid-swing they become Heisenberg's tactical opponent. 
---
My counter-offer would be the ability to put load-out slots into the favorite wheel. In the current UI you'd select "Change" (R1 on PS/4 etc) and one of the options would be "Current Config" either on the menu or as a UI button.
---
...**BUT**...
---
Changing an entire loadout woud take a the greater of:
---
(a) some fixed amount of time (like 6 seconds).
---
(b) until all other client machines in your rendering cell have acknowledged the change.
---
Also, during the change you would be effectively naked, with no perks, weapons, or armor in effect.
---
Basically switching a whole loadout should be a _strategic_ action, not a tactical one. That means you should be hidden if you want to do it safely.
---
The entire point of requiring you to go into the perk screen, and the entire point of not being able to instantly change to power armor instantly, is to prevent exploits and make massive changes like this "fair" to the tasks (and other players) at hand.
---
NOTE: Better remember to re-save a config if you sell off or drop part of it, otherwise you might swap into birthday suit plus fists mode if that armor and gun is no longer in your possession.
---
Same for after leveling as that might lead to unspent perk slots with possible cards just chillin in your list of possibilities.
---
As do I. But I can do that with many many weapons that aren't two shot. I mainly use a instigating, 50% limb damage 44. The head counts as a limb added onto the double damage at full health you can get rid of anything up to a scorchbeast in 1 bullet with a sneak attack. But the the problem is that the "nerf" they are doing is on the wrong thing. That 25% damage boost it will give is all that secondary shot is doing. So they are taking away the second projectile and giving the same damage to the main weapon with needing to have that extra projectile 
---
It really sucks.  He lasted for around 10 minutes last night before randomly dying.
---
I don't have a TSE weapon and don't want one.  Got several two shot weapons though.  That being said:
---
&gt; Removing two shot is good, it freshens up the weapon economy making other prefixes viable for the first time. Explosive is bad too but we need to take baby steps for balancing.
---
1) people never like it when things are taken away.
---
2) "freshening up the weapon economy" could easily be done by *buffing the other prefixes*.
---
3) it's pretty well understood that the E in TSE was the problem, not the TS so much.  Particularly with shotguns, since it's applying on hit effects to every pellet.  If they ever implement bleeding / burning as a prefix, shotguns will benefit the most.  start with that first.
---
Technically, I'm mostly fine with a two shot nerf, but +25% without changing the accuracy penalty?  that's too harsh without solving the E problem.  Buff the other prefixes, how hard is that.
---
When balancing a game, if there is a significant power difference then it is always going to be easier to either remove or reduce whichever is the most powerful than to buff many other parts.
---
This is by no means the final balance patch, everyone assumes this is the permanent state of the game
---
And I can’t help your tiny dick grow or your attitude brighten, I was legitimately saying something and you dropped an analogy that doesn’t respresent or mean anything. Your a total tool
---
I read it as if the mod itself is in the loot table now, and will be removed, not that they are removing whole weapons with two-shot already attached.
---
I was glad the xp exploit was around when I made my alt.
---
Agreed, I feel like I'm fumbling around in the dark when modding weapons and armour 
---
I dont give a shit, even the ones that have the beth tag, post like normal redditors and occasionally join conversations, or create their own. I like that, they seem closer to the community.
---
Slow news day 😢
---
no shit, i've linked it in my post
---
Balance updates and effect rework are a part of every online game. I'm not sure why this has shocked you so much, but it happens all the time. I image they're focus is on fixing PVP damage and not PVE damage. Explosive is already useless against a player using 3/3 fire proof + dense torso mod. 
---
Ok, the baby wants the last word. I’ll let baby have the last word. 
---
So many down-votes with not a lick of negative feedback. 8-)
---
Mr Fuzzy outfit. You get it with 450 Mr Fuzzy tokens at Camden Park.  That’s for the head and body. 
---
Yes, I have the perk right now and it's essentially useless....lol
---
It needs to be a 3 star and give more materials and rarer materials the more you upgrade it.
---
Enough that it needs to be nerfed.
---
Yes and without us with our two shot weapons you guys can't fight flying things. Meaning have fun with Schorched Beasts, The Queen, and getting keycards.
---
Any time anyone posts about this quest, it’s because it ate their armor. I haven’t done it once, are there any significant rewards I’m missing out on because I’m not doing it. I don’t want to lose my shit!
---
&gt; Maybe we're over reacting
---
Over reacting about Fallout 76!? Surely you jest. 
---
Cheers, shot you an invite :)
---
At 0.04 weight units, you can't afford *not* to carry it!
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Very little change. The game has crashed or locked up on me 4 times in the last two days (XBox) which is roughly the same as my pre-patch experience.
---
This is an almost unplayable game. Not going to waste time claiming workshops since I can never hold on to them long enough to realize a "profit"
---
I don't know if people like it or not
---
The sbq wont get nerfed. Itll be back to 25 minutes of wasting ammo and she'll just fly away.
---
Time to RP and open up a Post Apocalyptic Dick's Sporting Goods.
---
Okay I’ll try that, thanks. 
---
Oh I know ahahah
---
I failed it solo 2 times at level mid-40 before managing to complete it around level 60.
---
Meantime I did it with a group of level 100s (im 80 now) and its of course much more fun and easier.
---
That would be neat too! I've played a lot of games where there was a cleave/aoe modifier on weapons/attacks.
---
(Ex. Explosive in destiny, which is kinda like what you said)
---
Regional bosses and the reward is their mounted head on a plaque for your camp. 
---
I dunno I been running west tek every day and there is usually loot there. No idea when it respawns honestly 
---
I just wish you could truly interact with her, not just initiate the one option available to progress the quest.  But some conversation trees.  Everything else about the no human NPCs is fine, but a 'sentient' being like Rose should have interactions  At least MODUS gave us some options to select when taking a test.
---
It means the game will actually be challenging.  It's a welcome change.  I mean how nice would pvp be without being over in one shot? 
---
I think it's a poor way to handle the issue of op weapons. It essentially makes legendary weapons less exciting to earn because the pool of valuable legendary effects is now much smaller.
---
So you are saying that your additional armor, perks, bobbleheads, chems, magazines, food, drink, and mutations is just not enough to give you that edge, you have to have an un-nerfed TS to get over the hump?  Not buying that argument for a second, and I have a TS weapon that I use at SE events.  
---
When I was a lowbie and before they fixed the energy power plants were supposed to provide, that same scenario played out for me at Poseidon.  I was solo and low lvl so it took a while and a lot of resources to power up the plant, and every time I'd get d/c half way through the event.  At the time it was 100% an issue with the servers.  After several days of this, I finally succeeded only to find it didn't actually provide power to the fusion core generator as intended.  I was livid.  They've since fixed the power issue and improved server stability a bit, but I'm still too salty to bother with power plants.  Those events are tremendous fun, but ultimately not worth the frustration atm.  Same with SBQ.  I've been in five of those events and literally d/c (server side) or crashed out of the client, every time thus far.  It's bonkers.
---
Dude...you don't understand, I'm a volly EMT and had to bail waiting for the last bit at the 2nd bot cause we had a run. Came back, logged in.  Started. The. Hell. Over! I just logged off, finished it the other night. Was so pissed. But I did throw some mines in that side room and made easy work of the scorched. I hear the boom, turn, bodies flying everywhere
---
&gt; Like player factions don't really exist. They do on paper but not in practice.
---
This. Sure, we can band together and call ourselves factions. But...to what end? We can provide things to low level players. Claim workshops. Help one another gain levels. But, there's no real end objective. There's no effect on the world. The lack of an in-game faction SYSTEM makes it purely imaginary. There's no room for faction based radial quests, even player created/driven.
---
In FO4, if you joined the minutemen, you retook the castle, built up settlements, defeated bad guys, etc. And it altered the world. Things were legitimately changed. Settlements became busier. You gained access to more powerful weapons (a.k.a. artillery). It felt like player choices/actions made a difference. Factions meant something. And say what you will about Preston, and how annoying the settlement defense missions were, but the fact that they kept popping up meant there was always something to DO (even if it was repetitive).
---
Imagine if we had a faction system that allowed us to rebuild the responders similar to the minutemen. But because all of the main actors are now players, everything is much more dynamic. You don't have to be the superhero who wiped out a raider base on your own. Instead you have a fireteam. Guide us toward Events. Maybe you get a faction objective to complete Fertile Soil or Feed the People because the factions food storage is running low. Go take this workshop to establish a foothold for an upcoming operation.
---
This went a lot longer than I intended because I've been thinking about it a lot lately.
---
Even then, it'd still be too strong.  You're basically taking any weapon and turning its damage into 100% AOE damage...  the AOE/explosive portion needs to be an incremental damage with the majority of damage output from direct hits.  If not, then it just makes the grenade launchers and other explosive weapons totally redundant.
---
I have this perk x2 actually and still nothing.  
---
IMPORTANT - Those items are NOT deleted!  I've only seen this happen with things that have a quantity of more than 1 (so ammo, junk, etc) and not weapons / armor.
---
I had to figure this out the hard way after it happened several times.....lol
---
**Step 1 -** The trade glitch happens, and the bullets disappear......stop what you're doing.
---
**Step 2 -** Go deposit ALL of that type of bullet into your stash.
---
**Step 3 -** You should see that ALL of it went in there, including the missing bullets.
---
**Step 4 -** Try the trade again.  It can be buggy at times, but usually the 2nd or 3rd try works if you're having problems.  I've occasionally had to do more, but it wasn't 10 tries, I would've remembered that.
---
Hope that helps!
---
I've added about 7-8 strangers since the game's release into my friend's list; never have seen any of them on since...
---
See it’s weird it seems like people loot a lot of the same kind of stuff idk I have looted enough nocturnal wood armor to outfit the commie army😂
---
Bethesda clarified on the new mode:  
---
**\[UPDATE\]:** We’ve received questions about our new mode and want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately – **it will be a new option accessed from the Main Menu.** This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience. The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
Helmet is the one found right outside the main entrance to Hunterville, marks the grave of a Paladin I believe.
---
He is on a Quest to find Legendary ingredients and is willing to KILL for his Art!
---
Ugh I played so many hours in BL2 but can't remember this one.  ELI5?
---
In terms of multiple kills, and not using the advantage of instigating which is sneaking. Of course. Not saying that TS are not worth using or bad. Cause they are good. But I think that people make such a big deal about them just cause it says additional projectile without knowing anything else about them 
---
I know several players that run a Mule Character as well, but not for Duping, one of them is doing the player vendor thing, and does what he can to avoid Duped items, but there is no way to know if the Item you are trading for is Duped unless they have several of the same rare Item in their inventory.
---
I have another Character that I started (separate Console &amp; Account) and have been passing stuff off to the new one, not as a mule, but to create a good start, and to use as an Anchor Point for Team play so that we can get back to the same server.
---
feel the same way
---
"Legendary mod" as in short for "legendary modifier" is how I read it. You won't be able to get a ts legendary to drop after the patch. 
---
I tried, they don't have an applicable catagory that will accept it.
---
Don’t sell any firearms😂
---
I have never seen the assaultron one closed
---
It actually hasn't shocked me, and I understand balance which is why I was only letting myself use Two Shot instead of TSEs. All of that is moot though, I dont participate in PVP and I dont need to rework my special to include those perk cards, nor should I have to for a game they said you could play by yourself or in a group, in which they're definitely struggling to do both. I wasn't even really doing OP damage to a lot of enemies with my regular TS rifles, this just makes it even more spongey in my opinion.
---
I would think they would want to invest into PR at this point.
---
I havent spent any time farming legendaries and I still feel the same way. I think part of the fun is finding armor pieces and weapons that suit your play style or build, but I have yet to come across anything that really blew my hair back, and after this many hours in game I would expect I would have found SOMETHING cool by now.
---
This completely guts them before  removing them, this is fucking awful. Why not nerf the interaction between 2 shot and explosive since that's the actual fucking problem. I would much fucking rather do full damage to mods than balance this around the **BULLSHIT FORCED PVP**.    
---
If this goes through I'll actually stop playing.
---
That's what im wondering. Most of the damage from tse is coming from explosive, the 2 shot just being the carrier. Depending how much of a nerf it really is these things are going to be worth alot later on. Bloody explosive will be top dog for dmg (I don't mind ive been collecting).
---
I find it easier to explore the lore and stuff with my level 172 character. With my level 8 character, I'm too busy trying to fight off scorched with a level 5 weapon that's constantly breaking because I have next-to-nothing in the gunsmith perk.  
---
Prices for TSE guns will skyrocket after this.. 
---
Removing the Two Shot effect from the pool is clearly the wrong way Bethesda. Both mods on their own are very strong but not op. Keep TS the same and make both TS and Explosive a prefix. That way theres no more insane damage possible.
---
Im glad you keep the existing TSEs in tho (not the duped ones hopefully). 
---
Ah... Okay. That makes sense.  Thank you!  (I really was wondering)
---
Same bruh, had to leave to take an ambulance run for my volly FD. Was so frustrated.
---
I guess considering all the modifier affixes and types of armor and weapons there is really only like a 0.5% chance of getting something you want.
---
Fast travel to Charleston train yard. Then run across bridge to Charleston railroad vendor. He will spawn there maybe once out of every 20 times I do this. I always get Mothman prior to reaponder bot. Friendly Mothman. Anyhow the vendor dies...drops dead within 1 minute of my arrival every time so get to him and open trade menu fast
---
Just add scorched killer rolling pin mod and your golden!!!
---
There are companies you can hire to do all that.
---
1 and 1/4th shot. That's garbo
---
It’s crazy I don’t really play anymore unless someone wants to trade
---
probably not, but it's always funny to see a SBQ that is both frozen by a cryolator and on fire from perfect storm.
---
I'll be sticking around, but I'm also a VATS stealth sniper so I've also had good dmg output before I ever got my hands on my current tse lever action and ts handmade. Some mobs will just take a few extra bullets to put down, no biggie. Let's see how it plays out before assuming the worst over just the mention of a nerf.
---
Sounds like a nice idea.  But the monorail only rides throug the ash heap region to the bog. And you can travel from ash heap to the bog using that train tunnel.. 
---
Yeah the rewards are cool, but the event in itself is a chore to do. Even more solo.
---
Im glad they're addressing the cost of fast travel to an event! :)
---
It would be easier just to display the timer in the map for example.
---
Completely unrelated, but I quickly read your comment as addressing Battlestar Galactica instead of Bethesda.  Thanks for making me chuckle a little.
---
you're right about shotgun fixing, but start by fixing the *real problem first*, at least.
---
like I said, a small nerf to two shot is warranted, but 25% is too much.
---
Although, now that I think about it, what if they went the other way, and nerfed all the overpowered prefixes?  that might devalue legendaries too much, I suppose.

Nerfing Two Shot is not a solution to any of the problems that we have brought up on here. It is a shim for properly doing anything. The community seems to generally be behind the idea that you can no longer have guns with both Two Shot and Explosive - you can only have one or the other. Perhaps, what you intend, is that for all the **already obtained** TSE guns, that you nerf their damage. That sounds great.  
---
In lieu of that, you should at minimum nerf both. But there are so many better alternatives. Buffing the other legendary affixes for one, even doing work to introduce newer affixes that might level the playing field.  
---
Maybe I'm being a bit selfish too, my best weapon that I found on my own is just a TS Handmade (I use it as a semi-auto rifle) and without it I'd be forever trapped swinging a super sledge to do the kind of damage you need to do in the endgame. This nerf is going to make many fair use guns useless again. The complaint was never about TS in general, its almost always specifically about TSE shotguns and/or automatic weapons.  
---
My only guess here is that somehow, implementing this change will enable you to catch dupers. I am very excited about that. The best part of this post for me was just hearing from Bethesda that you very much **intend** to ban dupers. While you are very late to the punch here, and the player economy has been close to destroyed by releasing the game with so many exploits, I am glad to see you finally attempting to sort this out. Now of course... intentions are very different then actions.
---
Lol triggered.
---
&gt;the only quality of life improvement would be for you as you seems to be having an unrealistically hard time getting flux
---
I mean, sorry not sorry that you got offended by my "smart ass" remark, but it kinda summarizes the entire thread. You seem to be having an unrealistically hard time getting flux, therefore you want something added to the game that makes your gaming experience "better." When in reality you're just bad at it and need to learn how to properly farm flux.
---
+3 STR +2 PER if I'm not mistaken, as well as a little damage and energy resist
---
Sounds like no more slap damage
---
I don't want quick sweeping knee jerk balances, and I have no clue where you are getting this everyone consensus from but a majority of the people in my circle are against this change and it's implementation.
---
And once again, I disagree, the solution to Zealot's being useful isn't to quadruple it's bonus. It is to move it on the lot table to be competing with things like increased rate of fire.
---
Quadrupling it's bonus would be a quick solution, but faster isn't always better.
---
Maybe not even stuff I want, maybe just something besides wood armor or other useless junk
---
The black screen I'm talking about is the pip boy
---
Actually yeah, when the nerf goes in place, I have a Two Shot Lever Action, Two Shot Handmade, Two Shot Combat Rifle, Two Shot Dragon, and a Two Shot Hunting Rifle. Plus some really nice armor. I am not joking, they're yours when I am done playing, hit me up around then.
---
Im really but hurt about the two shot buff
---
Not necessary. PVP people are already running around with no meaningful junk to drop, so the current situation is just like your worst case but with existing player predators.
---
So if you pick regular, pacifist, or pacifist-only in your settings and the next time you log in it's just the way it is. You are then stuck in your selected mode until you change servers.
---
One thing that I would change is that death drops by a pacifist character should not be accessible to other players.
---
Ok maybe 2 lol
---
I don't use chems, I shouldn't have to rely on them. They're just caps to me, same goes for bobbleheads.
---
As long as you have put something into it to keep it running, like fusion cores or circuitry, something that requires repairing it to keep it going, then go ahead.
---
My thought is it should be a tier system. Since we find these lying around all over the place, so like let's say the tiers are 1,5,10,20(more can be added)
---
1 UGSR - food, water, stims/chems and a chance for a random plan or mod
---
5 UGSR - Same as above but with a much greater chance of a plan or mod. Random weapon or armor of your level
---
10 UGSR - Guaranteed plan or mod. Chance for a rare outfit. Random weapons or armor with better mods or attachments
---
Etc. This isn't a perfect system but more of an outline for how it could work
---
TLDR give more supply requisitions get better stuff
---
We've been told they MIGHT increase stash size depending on stability (which hasn't been great) and we will be SOL until they do.
---
Yeah, bloodied and instigating will be able to do full double damage with drawbacks vs 25% all the time (with worse accuracy and recoil), which isn't a huge deal, but people still won't even have the option for a blanket damage anymore- a weapon that's less sepcialized, but more versatile. Nerfing the damage is fine. Removing from the game entirely is stupid. Just balance it.
---
I read what you said about explosives. Doesn't change the fact that they're a bigger issue than two shot but haven't been addressed (for PvE at least).
---
I don't think two shot and melee are overpowered. Quite the opposite- I think regular rifles and pistols (combat, assault rifles, laser, plasma) are underpowered. I don't think it should take a full clip to drop one enemy,  but that's more of a personal preference.
---
Wouldnt removing 2 shot encourage people to dupe the ones they already have and increase those stupid Ebay sales?
---
I think you mean nerf
---
The tedium is almost unbearable until about lvl 25 and then it becomes silly easy. Probably in part because that's when you can get the excavator armor and carry a lot more.
---
Do you run anything else? I don't think it's time based but rather object based. So if you loot say 50 (random number, no idea really how many) containers after that then it allows the older ones to refresh.
---
That is very good to know. Thanks for clearing it up!
---
Oh yeah true, I didn’t think of that. Maybe because they’re docile and always flee they didn’t want to put the effort into making them bigger. Their size helps them be sneaky.  
---
Diablo 3 Vanilla lvl bad.
---
Boooo. it's now 1 and 1/4th shot. Why would they nerf this? The game is 94% PvE 
---
Okay cool. Last I checked I don't decide what they do on a subreddit dedicated to their game
---
So what you're saying is all the people who duped these items will be the only ones with them forever and forever be the best, bc they cheated. Awesome, even if I played for 100+ hours I'll never have as good of a weapon as these people who cheated to get it. 
---
It's more sutible for a heavy gunner build like mine. I don't use or really need stealth.
---
Watch out for phishing. They will send you a link to a very similar we site and try to get your login information
---
I'm bad at it? Lol. How would you know? I'm lvl 197 and I'm good on flux and I just think this would be easier for anyone. Stop acting like you've never seen a hyperbole before you little troll. It's obvious that's what it is.
---
I agree I just think the issue isnt just 2 shot weapons, they really dont do that much damage, it's the 2 shot explosives that I think should be removed.
---
Agreed, I'd personally go with the explosion only gets counted once rather than per pellet, but let the AoE be based on all the pellets to keep the shotgun flavor. 
---
Is that with no rifle perks?
---
With a few perks, a double sneak headshot should easily one-shot level 68 super mutants, although I think you'd be lucky to land both of the bullets.
---
Would be cool like that OCdecorator mod in FO4 for static loot
---
I am unable to craft missiles even though I have the required resources.
---
Who knows? Would it be cool if they were instanced content, limited to the team you're on with a designated end-boss and a limited, high-end loot table? Hell yeah.
---
But who knows what they're going to be in the end?
---
You don't start circlejerks with evidence.
---
I know my budget is increasing. If that is because I'm leveling or because there was some kind of bug before using my budget I do not know, since I've seem items I didn't craft appearing in my stored tab.
---
Next druid ring teleport in 2 minutes! 
---
Good ghads, man. We are OLD.  :) 
---
They nerfed the weak affix instead of explosive, which is what is causing all the balance problems.  
---
TODD
---
Idk what vaults will be. Maybe it will be a sick joke, spending hours, days, months to find the key to enter.. ' just to find out its empty. 
---
It wasnt immersive but I liked knowing other players were doing an event to help aid their fellow vault dwellers. 
---
I wish the Poseidon power events notified you as well that power was restored to the region thanks to other players etc. 
---
Hoping to start asking C.A.M.P. posts to include the player's level, so we know what sort of budget is required.  Also, what items are ATOM purchases and what are in-game for the cool stuff.  
---
I always run out of budget!!  
---
This is such a cool looking C.A.M.P.  I'd love to see a C.A.M.P. plan exchange, where we could get blueprints of other people's stuff!
---
Lol😂
---
Just because something does not have proof, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. There are many companies world wide that do exactly this. Social media manipulation.
---
I don't like that all the duped TSE's will become more valuable. Even if they nerf the TS to 25%, a TSE will still be better than anything you can loot after the change. (unless they add something else etc.) I also agree that I always felt the explosive ammo was more of an issue than two-shot. 
---
Garden plots from FO4....
---
True point.
---
My husband also plays. Having the advantage of being able to craft high end modded low level gear for my alt and use him to transfer it to myself takes off some of the pressure.  As does having a companion to play with. 
---
Polite, respectful. To the point.
---
Sure, go for it.
---
I agree. My TS combat rifle still takes(from stealth), at least 3 shots to kill a super mutant. This is with all rifle perks and bloody mess. It is not OP. 
---
Yes exactly.   That's what I am getting at. Grinding to level 25 and then having to gather all the materials to build that armor again... ugh.  
---
Well, I for one agree with your stance.
---
This, is what I ask myself about everything that people get worked up about, and yet I keep hearing about supposed loot boxes and negative things instead. This post was intentionally poking the bear for that reason.
---
I always thought we got more budget the higher level we are. But, quite a few people are saying that it’s just the items take less budget the higher level we are. I also don’t use turrets which take up a massive part of the budget.
---
I paid 1000 for my winter jacket 
---
I got the space suit off the vendor 
---
That would be insane and i would be just as happy. 
---
I fully agree. My big question is, will TSE have reduced damage on the second explosive shot? Because these items will still exist in game, but just be unobtainable to the new player or player who hasn't yet received one.
---
I have a lvl 165, a lvl 50 and a level 31. I still spend 95% of my time on my 165. It is hard to go back to leveling especially since higher levels are around many starting zones causing enemies to be much higher and harder than before. 
---
&gt; and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world.
---
What does this mean exactly? Legendary enemies wont drop two shots anymore? I say anymore even though I've never gotten a two shot anything in my 190ish hours of play, but still.
---
Yup sorry im angry and not thinking straight lol
---
why not just nerf by half the explosive effect when they came with the two shot effect.
---
there's a shed full of bicycles in the mire that could be used.
---
Some vendors will have them as well.  There is also plans for the two pianos.
---
So you're saying it should package the double mod into the weapons with 1 ammo? And explosives haven't been nerfed nearly as much as they need to be yet. 
---
I like the mutants change, but I feel like most of everybody is going to be having a lot of mutations over time.
---
Crossbows definitely need a buff, I love my two shot but it's kinda sad sometimes
---
This needs more upvoting... massive mistake nerfing two shot effect. Explosive weapons have always been the problem and many people have made that clear, yet they have completely missed that fact.
---
The house is not all that blue. It does have some light blue highlights in the brickwork. The sink does not work. You cannot sleep on the bed. But the place is very clean and has all the doors. Not all bad.
---
I didn't notice the Attic. Got me curious now
---
Same. About 300 hours in to earn everything I have. 
---
I am ok with making ts and e never appear on the same weapon. I'm ok with rolling back tse weapons to only be ts or e. 
---
But where does it end? So the next item down that people find hard to get and say is too overpowered gets axed next? The point of the game is to work hard and hope you get good stuff. Not level the playing field so everyone is eventually just beating each other with boards in their undies? 
---
Rick Astley did not give up punctuation.
---
Holy shit bro....
---
Potentially you would be forced to start a new character to play it and death would mean you lose everything , however my guess it’ll just be the same game just with no slap damage.
---
Really?  I use supers as an 'ohshit' button since I run Heal Factor, they are much more useful to me than normals for that reason and they also seem to restore more limb hp
---
They are different classes of armor, so they each have their own mods. Heavy combat armor is NOT regular modded combat armor
---
What guns would you recommend? I have a stealth rifle build but the best weapons I have is a suppressors handmade. Level 80
---
I've played low- levels both solo and with companions and I dunno... I just found it infuriating in both cases lol.
---
I've been trying this method, keep freezing intermittently when crossing the second bridge back
---
Good point. Really. I´ve not considered those situations.
---
I have 1 of each rifleman, tank killer 3, and 2.15x sneak attack damage
---
Fucking hated rose. Wish the instructions would be on a terminal in the ToW rather than coming out if that loud mouthed bitch 
---
If I had the power to make rash balance changes I would turn explosive into "Does 20% of weapon damage to surrounding enemies."
---
I have done Battle Bot like 10 times solo, where are you having trouble? Is it the part where you have to do the two key cards? It usually takes me a couple tries to get it sprinting but it works.
---
Yeah you would have to fight that super mutant for them though. I think he collects them lol
---
And I can fully understand that. But there's anti armor, furious, bloodied that all do so much in terms of damage 
---
Howdy, neighbor! ^_^/
---
Anywhere in particular/certain mobs?
---
Oh. Yeah, that's fair. I deride all of the 'sky is falling' loot box posts too, I usually just notice them when I'm too busy to actually verbalize my scorn.
---
Oh my that is a beauty.  Congrats.
---
Areas have level caps and high-levels are likely to be wandering around them anyway. Only the Mire and Bog can go up to max level IIRC, and Forest can't go above about 6. Low levels will be able to manage.
---
“Ah! Really great house, bro. Virginia! Oh, good butts under openly irradiated earth. Ultimate release! ... shake my head.”
---
Passive need to be changed to a No Pvp mode. You do no damage to other players, including no damage hostile robots. WS robots will turn on you very quickly if you accidentally hit them and they can be relentless for a long time.
---
No damage to other players CAMP and your CAMP cannot be attacked. 
---
In other words, Passive mode is "I want nothing to F@#$ing do with PVP" mode.
---
to balance it a bit, you cannot enter passive if Wanted and entering Passive mode should be a 30 sec countdown to prevent people from abusing its safety status.
---
Right! Which is why itll probably take a hot minute to balance across the board, as they still need to make stuff like energy weapons work and all of that.
---
Totally see it happening balance wise sooner than later, just saying it's understandable that they'd push the easier to adjust two shot fix to start the process in the meantime. 
---
Honestly could be a bit more thought out than that. By nerfing one affix and making it no longer drop while keeping the other as is, someone attempting to dupe and stock the new flavor of the month best weapon movement we'll have won't know what to dupe. Fix duping and roll out an explosive fix same patch. Now the majority of stock is not only antiquated and mildly nerfed, it's now supremely average and a mid-range affix grouping. What you could sell for 5k caps will become 300. Stock would move slow as hell. Wouldn't be worth it very quickly.
---
Yeah, the only good legendary I've ever got is a level 20 explosive combat shotgun, and even at level 20 this thing helps me (level 183) shred any and all enemies.
---
So yeah, safe to say the two shot isn't the problem with those weapons.
---
PS4:
---
Alright, to follow up on my prior post, now that I’ve had more time to play... I can confirm that the enemies randomly dying has NOT been fixed. It seems to be less common thanks to the white springs being fixed, but it is still present.
---
And, I too have been experiencing an issue that others have. That issue is the one where I cannot craft ammo despite having the required resources listed.
---
Can’t wait for that!!!
---
 Depends on the circumstances. Suckering a griefer is fair in my book.
---
 I don't have a TSE but I do have a level 20 Combat Shotgun with both Explosive Damage and a big magazine. Its OP. Piss me off enough and I'll use it on you. ;)
---
You don't have to rely on anything in this game, doing so, or not, is a choice.  Some people feel they need it for victory or convenience, its all 
---
 about choice not need.
---
Every game that offers both pvp and no pvp servers has found that the non pvp servers are favored by the great majority of players.  I would definitely support changing the passivist mode so that you select it at the log in and are then taken to your chosen world.  I would never choose a pvp world in this game.
---
Exactly.  The amount of ammo I burn through just to take and then immediately defend the ammo factory is usually greater than the ROI I get in the time I can keep it.  There have been exceptions, but it's crapshoot.
---
&gt;Stop acting like you've never seen a hyperbole before you little troll.
---
The only hyperbole here is your entire post because it's not meant to be taken seriously.
---
Honestly, I'd like it if they could do two things, make moonshine, and make flamer fuel (as well...flamable liquids)
---
And the event should be called "Fill the Trough".
---
I think it's both of them. I love my two shot weapons (none of them have explosive), and while the nerf on the two shot weapons seems harsh, the main culprit here is being alone.
---
Yes, ***explosive***, I am looking at you.
---
well with games on disc this seems to be not necessary.   
---
on xbox i guess its the gamertag that needs to change
---
Don't worry though, they're gutting them before making them legacy.
---
as  someone who has a two-shot weapon NERF IT TO THE GROUND BABY
---
Yes. This what I was hoping for. Great! perfect! 
---
You know how we repaired some kinda scorched detector that apparently does nothing? And how, apparently multiple factions can communicate with every persons pip boy? (Rose and the nuke alerts for example).
---
Seems like there could at min be special events that are global announcements like “a herd of giant sloths is going to Berkeley springs” or “mirelurk queen and army detected at  Morgan town “ or whatever and then, similar to nuking white springs..., everyone could go to a town that has a huge horde spawn with like level 80 ebenmies snd legendary enemies etc. could even tag it with other in game special events like doing something during the horde calls in vertibird attack and supply drops or like satellite mini nukes. Like in the same city st the same time could another event to repair s mainframe or something, similar to the power plants.
---
Point is, all these mechanics are already in game, it’s no like they have to make new shit.
---
This thing took many different iterations before I liked what I had. I scrapped the whole thing a couple times to start over lol.
---
Thanks, even the people who don't are okay in my books. There is so much frustration surrounding this game, combine that with a passionate, usually lifelong fan base, there's going to be some heated debates. But in all honesty, this shit is going to kill the game for me. I don't find it fun to waste a whole magazine of 5.56 on a super mutant, especially with ammo prices and crafting material rarities like lead.
---
Be sure to perfect your Justin Wilson accent and Cajun idioms first.  Bon chance!
---
Unfortunately it is very easy to determine if a house/building is player built. It would be cool to be able to create a house that looks like any other building in the game. Would make for some cool discoveries when you go into a building in the city to loot but come to find out it is a players base
---
Can it be a unicorn and instead of its ass out of the nostrils with a cat wearing a monocle and a top hat riding it? 
---
As someone who’s been grinding just to get to level 30 and some serviceable gear, why on earth would anyone ever want to go back to Level 1? We can’t recapture the thrill  of discovering a new open world for the first time, the holotapes will be reruns, so what’s the appeal of starting over?
---
Well we'll know in a week, a very concerned worrying week lol
---
But only anti armor and two shot apply at all times. Bloodied and Furious require either losing health or multiple consecutive hits.
---
I only tried it like twice but I can't do both keypads in 4 seconds.  I'm old.  I tried hard for like 20 minutes, then bailed.
---
This is wrong. It was 100% of a standard reciever after perks. The disparity was because most people don't have standard recievers on their guns.
---
I tested this with my TS combat shotgun and a regular one. With perks equipped and a standard reciever on both the TS was exactly twice the damage of the regular one. When switching both to hardened the TS increased its damage by the same amount as the regular.
---
Tldr: TS is affected by perks but not the mods on the weapon. 
---
https://youtu.be/aYDfwUJzYQg
---
It does not increase with level
---
I don’t mind.I go other when I can and they are generally cool with it and try give me a “tour” with emotes,I also get ideas from there base,so I leave my open so they can do the same.
---
I've bought a two shot western revolver because two shot was the only way a pistol could hold up in the end game, and now its gonna get nerfed? 
---
I hope they at least buff the base damage of some guns because there really is only a handful of weapons worth using in the end game, and I tell you, pistols aint in the category...
---
Fireproof mitigates 45% of the explosive effect though. That’s already in the game right now.
---
Saying that TS isn’t a problem is hyperbole and outright false. Both explosive and TS enable instakills. Both are problem.
---
Get a camp built up and be constantly trying to improve you weapons.
---
Yes. I usually walk that bridge slowly because what’s in front of the shack is loading in. Usually I’ll see the cow first and the vendor bot will be slowly walking up the hill next to the telephone pole.  
---
Of all request I honestly think that this is a bit of a secondary request.
---
Ive seen Camps that aesthethically are terrible to the games landscape. 
---
Some have a couple of ladders that lead way up that a bunch of tiles held together to support benches and turrets.
---
Others build enormous mansions completely out of place with the environment around them.
---
I know this is fantasy but I wish peopke would keep it a bit more in accordance with the games aesthetic. 
---
More budget will lead to more stress to the servers and more humongous Camps throughout the wasteland.
---
I don't think real-time mounts/traveling would work well especially when 76 requires a server to stay stable.
---
There's a Fallout 4 Mod that allows the motorcycles to be used, and you'll soon find out that the game simply won't load all the surrounding items by the time you got there on your mount.
---
If I were Bethesda I'd reduce the explosive damage boost to something like 10%, even on the first shot.
---
Absolutely no criticism meant here, but I'm truly wondering how you both really like the game but spend more than half of it simply grinding for legendaries. Is the grinding fun as well? If it is, I guess that's it's own reward. I've spent my last four play session going to the same three places to pick off enemies for xp and ammo, overburden myself with junk for ammo and for the Excavator plans I'm going to head off for soon (I'm low level), while also spending time modifying my rifles. That's a grind too, but I'm enjoying it. For that reason, I have absolutely no desire to have an overpowered weapon like a TSE. I like a rifle that's good, but not so good that it makes easy prey out of everything.
---
Sorry, this is not about me. Getting back to you, what would you do if, say, your next 3 drops were the weapon of your dreams. Would you keep grinding for more, or what? Serious question.
---
Get on the fallout 76 discord if you want to trade or team up, great place to go
---
Yeah thats what i miss about junk fences, you could make super convincing raider bases in 4
---
I feel ya as a mostly solo player it’s hard to find a weapon worthy of the endgame enemies and then when you do you gotta respec sometimes lol even the queen usually drops 1* stuff.
---
two or three headshots do it for me, it actually has to due with how shotguns work, as super mutants have a very high physical damage resistance, and shotguns have a kind of 'pellet' effect from the feel of it, with the damage devided between all the pellets, making them effectively count as sepparte hits.  It's why the Combat Shotgun's damage jumps up so quick after putting an ap mag on it
---
I got you moth man. I'm on xbox. I remember you from the vault. You gave me your cocktail fruit. I can provide some help. 
---
Pleasantville
---
I just hope the private servers are not too expensive.  Once those are implemented, then the players that do nothing but be toxic to the overall environment of the game, will probably be left only playing with others that are also toxic.
---
I also hope once they do the private server, I also want the ability for it to be public, but with the ability to turn PVP off completely.
---
Thanks for the answer but this seen a bit unfair to people that dont have a TSE, would it not ? Or is it meant to be traded by people that have them?
---
&gt;Reply
---
Just imagine all the winers saying they got a TSE legit.  
---
Just make both effects a prefix. Problem solved. No nerf or removal needed. 
---
Using a water tower tank for a shell.
---
Have a team of people with non legendary weapons take on a Queen... all their guns will break before they even put a dent in the Queen. 
---
How is balancing an OP weapon combination bad? Tse takes all of the fun and skill out of the game. Honestly we dont need tse weapons, my bloodied powerfist can almost one shot a glowing deathclaw :D
---
Nothing random about it, over 90% of my legendary drops are leather left legs, no exaggerating at all. I'm about 250hrs in, best weapon was 2* quad double barrel that glitched out my inv within a couple of days, talk about a kick in the nuts... 
---
You smell
---
Yeah I know. Sometimes you have to sacrifice to get the most damage out of things. 
---
I completely agree, I'm just trying to rationale why they targeted TS and not Explosive. Since they addressed it pvp wise last update with Fireproof, I figured they may only care about it being OP in PvP. 
---
I make sure to swap my TSE to a weaker weapon when  doing any events with other players, it's annoying when people aren't considerate. 
---
As for being able to 1 shot everything, I would agree if there was more group oriented content. BGS Fallout games have always gotten to the point that you'd be super OP. Using it decimate packs of ghouls in nuke zones is a dick move, but there are tons of dick people that don't care I guess.
---
He followed me, hit me over and over again until i thought, ok i'll try to kill him... but no when i'm about to win with my gitarr sword he bring the big boy out :(
---
Wow legit just said this in the other thread. This would also give competition to 2 shot and Bloodied
---
That should be a Flamer Skin
---
Budget and level are 100% unrelated 
---
Thanks i will try this as soon as i can.
---
The second bullet, instead of adding 100% damage, will only add 25% damage. I assume that will be added to the total damage output and divided between the 2 bullets. So instead of 1 bullet doing 100% damage and the other doing 25% damage, they both will do 62.5% damage. So  if that's the case, if you only land 1 of the 2 bullets you will be doing LESS damage than a normal 1 shot gun
---
I got about a 50% red resistence when carrying about 20 toys.  Trying to find out if there is a limit.  Then I hit the "scrap all" and have to start over
---
You are mistaken, or its a bug.
---
Tbf I think that losing everything on death would be quite fun however I wouldn’t worry if I were you , if you don’t want to play it you won’t have to , it’ll be optional either way.
---
Well it’s all opinion and yes I like the game, the environment, the mechanics, the perks and build options, but for a mostly solo player finding worthy endgame equipment is hard and while always finding the same wood armor piece from legendaries something different would be nice. So once again I do like the game there’s just not much to do once you finish the quests and legendary grinding isn’t very rewarding. To answer your question if the next three drops were the weapons of my dreams would I keep grinding. Well that’s just the thing I don’t play too much at this point another 130+ hours of grinding I’m pretty sure I’m not gonna get what I’m looking for I just get on every now and then to trade.

 "~~and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~.

---
go back and check the article again.  it changed.
---
I laughed aloud at the doctor's office.  
---
I got a TS Lever Action two days ago and started enjoying killing stuff in a reasonable amount of time. 
---
Bethesda just posted an update on their forums.
---
The pvp mode their talking about is chosen from the main menu.
---
Its literally pvp servers
---
That, however is not accurate lol
---
They just updated the post and are nerfing explosive as well to +25% as well.
---
I've never seen a heavy armor plan aside from leather. Maybe a very rare world or mission drop.
---
On the plus side you don't need heavy armor plans, because the mods are common across classes: Any mod you unlock on light combat armor also applies to heavy combat armor. Heavy combat armor is a common drop, so you can just find some and mod it up.
---
Do you get the games if you pre-order ed from Amazon ? Please anyone who can give a correct answer , Thank You.  
---
I honestly don't mind the current set up, I don't think the trolling is nearly as bad as people make it out to be.
---
Nah I don't need to try again it's pretty clear that's what you thought from your original comment. "lol too bad for everyone else cause I already got one now I'm gonna be running around with the only OP weapon". Get real.
---
I feel you..
---
Got my favorite weapons as Tse yesterday and now saw this post. Wtf.
---
Still TSE are not gone yet. Theres still people finding and sadly duping it.
---
For best results i suggest checking out r/fo76bazaar or the other market subreddit r/fo76market
---
There is a "Crashed cargobot" rando encounter. I see it often near Charleston RR.
---
I totally agree with your statement
---
Rank 3 fireproof is your friend
---
Duping kinda messed with the community's view of legendaries. It used to be a snowflake to find something cool, now anything is just compared to a TSE and tossed aside if it isn't even close.
---
I like what bacon said, where explosive mod doesn't add damage but it spreads the normal damage in an AoE like Destiny
---
Imagine buying something with real money from the atom shop 
---
Here is the update
---
**(UPDATE):** We’ve received questions about our new mode and want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately – **it will be a new option accessed from the Main Menu.** This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience. The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.

---
They also updated the explanation around the Two Shot mod
---
&gt; Your grammar and spelling is appaling... 
---
irony, thy are rich.   
---
The Heavy,Sturdy and Regular plans are all different I myself was told to run the vendor bots in the responder line. I have found a few of the leather, metal and 1 Combat 
---
Oh, I never pay attention to the challenges until they trigger the award. I'm not in it for atom shop stuff, and if the points are ever used for actual in-game benefits, then I'm out. I already fund Galaxy of Heroes and a few other mobile games. I'm not 'subscribing' to fallout.
---
All that being said, I didn't know that and I appreciate learning. I'm sure one of the guys I run with will appreciate the knowledge. Thanks!
---
I run plasma gatlings so I know a bit about weapons breaking.  Take multiple weapons.  Some people have become really dependent on TS current damage level, but there are plenty of workarounds, it won't break anything reducing the damage.
---
I offer 7k ;) Seems like you're on PS4 too
---
Thank You sir.
---
Nothing there but I found an unpowered keypad at Tanagra city which no so far from the safe
---
See I feel likes it’s broken somehow I’ve looted a nocturnal wood right leg at least 100 times and have never got a repeat of any other legendary I have found.
---
I got 76 on XBox, Do I stil use the launcher?
---
I wouldn't bother shooting back right now. They need to balance the current armor meta. Assassin, each piece negates 8% of pvp damage and then Sentinel provides a damn near invulnerable person unless you can either stagger them or hit them enough to drain their AP, making Sentinel ineffective. Then they have a certain perk loadout (forget which cards), but basically they can sit there and eat some TSEs for a while. 
---
Wow, really surprised by how clean and aesthetically pleasing this design is. Great work, I'd love to see more from you! 
---
Actually that is fine. The explosive suffix by its description adds 15 explosive damage, increasing that to 30 isn't inherently overpowered.
---
Scaling the explosive damage with the equipped weapon perks, with two-shot, with 7 or 8 shotgun pellets and having it able to strike a single target multiple times - those are the problems.
---
TLDR: 30 OK, 600 BAD.
---
It must be hard since you completely misunderstood what he said while simultaneously insulted him because of that.
---
I really like the suggestion to make fast travel to events cheaper. That makes a great incentive.
---
They update the explanation
---
**(UPDATED) Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods**: The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damag~~e, and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. **Note:** This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. **They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes.** Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes.
---
Would you mind posting the link please?
---
Ok. You've conformed my suspicions  that you are just a troll with no interest in the post or what its about at all but rather that you wanted to get a rise out of someone. I hope your life gets better that way you dont spend your time on the internet trying find people to piss off. I really do hope things get better for you because it's sad to see someone with such a pathetic and empty life that they have nothing better to do than purposefully try to upset others and they are such garbage people that they would like to troll someone rather than find posts they agree with and spend that time making someone feel good. I wish you the best and this will be my last reply to you. 
---
Does that help against players too? 
---
Alas I don’t require assistance but much thanks. Ayuum is my gt 
---
I have multiple, and it'll hurt our ability to perform efficiently.
---
Throw me an offer be on around 9:15 pm est due to work of that is fine with you or could to tomorrow morning if you can wait
---
yeah i remember it. I guess a dude can dream. I figure it would be akin to riding the vertibird in FO4
---
since this is a month late, you proably already know this, but there is a regular spawn site for ( most of the time) 51b armor.  it's on the shelves near the power armor stations in  camp venture.
---
I think they'll be similar to sqb.
---
An avenue to unique plans but probably more legendary drops.
---
Exactly. This change is unbelievably misguided.
---
Yup exactly. 
---
Something I wonder about as well though is whether this effect comes into play with things like accuracy and armor penetration for the second shot, since those are often affected by weapon mods. 
---
I couldn't really test this myself though unfortunately, but it seems likely that if the reciever doesn't affect the second shot, other mods won't either. 
---
 Yeah assholes abound. ;) I dunno what the attraction is really. I guess you can pretend you are a Raider but still its very lame.
---
Who runs with fireproof and points in endurance though?
---
Lol I think you messed up on your quote there.
---
Ayuum   :)
---
If losing junk gets you down then this might not be the game for you..happened to me many times..junk is always easily obtainable 
---
I agree. My quad explosive pump action destroys everything, I actually don't use it unless im up against a boss, it's too powerful and makes combat a little dull
---
Re-spec to melee before that shizzle gets nerfed.
---
I feel ya man 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Ah fair ^^ jw 
---
What about other weapons such as rifles? 
---
Every time they nerf something something else will get complained about until everything is doing slap damage in PvP and PvE. People will never be happy until every single item and effect does 5 DPS, except for their chosen weapon/build. It's fine and should be left alone. Nerf explosives. Nerf melee. Nerf this. Nerf that. Nerf scissors. Rock is fine. Love paper.
---
lol...yea...that's gonna work...
---
Yeah that made me feel like they're really out of touch with what's going on.  If they feel like that was the right fix, they should have said why.  As it stands, i'm not sure if they have any real idea what's going on.  Which worries me.
---
Also... no changes to pvp rules in the current game mode?  I mean... it needs changes, no?
---
Great! Thanks for this and thanks Betheada for the speedy update.
---
I have found Heavy Leather plans and some medium (sturdy) plans, but I have never seen the plans for Metal or Combat armor, medium or heavy.
---
they are also nerfing it.
---
It does!  
---
Apparantly rank 2 + dense mod on your chest reduces explosive damage to none. Rank 3 is similar
---
I feel you brother. I havent played in a month due to the mob respawn mechanic, but I keep haunting this sub, hoping things get better
---
Boohoo.
---
Ok kid. I wish you the best and hope that your life improves enough that you have something better to do than insult random strangers on the internet without provocation. Its pitiful honestly... This is my final reply to you as I do have better things to do.
---
Well shoot 
---
Maybe not what you meant, but Tesla does have a shotgun mod. Probably still uses rifle perks, but can't confirm.
---
I made an alt to try out a new build. 
---
gd mole rats burrowing into my base was the most annoying thing. My new base location sees almost no enemies and they always attack from the same side so I know where to place my single turret to defend. I agree though...we should really get more budget for our CAMPs...or a turret budget...or better yet, a reduction to how much budget each turret costs.
---
shrug, I don't trade for weapons, and don't just "toss aside" anything.  Shit, all my best weapons have come from vendors, my luck blows.
---
&gt; I like what bacon said, where explosive mod doesn't add damage but it spreads the normal damage in an AoE like Destiny
---
Yeah, that doesn't seem so bad.
---
but you also get twice as many that way...
---
I’m just gonna throw this out there, I’m not sure about you but I enjoy the building, just got done hunting down tons of plans to make my house all nice. Personally I’d like them to add more stuff for the camp but it’s still fun for me at least. I’m finally at the point now where I understand people talking about lack of end game content, but until we get more nuke bosses I’ll have to be patient
---
I have monongah down to a science and doesnt take much to do 100% repairs. But the invisible wolfs that kept attacking the workshop and the D/C’s when i only had 1 fusion core at 40% i was getting a little frustrated. 
---
As I posted they just updated the 'inside the vault' with corrections to it.
---
I'd keep this as my go-to melee solely based on the carry weight.
---
Your idea is valid, but it doesn't prevent griefers from griefing. One of the ways a no-PVP server can still lead to player-on-player grief is kiting in enemies and/or jumping in front of you while you've got an explosive weapon equipped.
---
Instead, what we need (IMHO) is ...
---
(a) Remove all "slap damage" on pacifists. The pacifist already does zero damage to other players, so make that kind of code exists, just make it symmetric.
---
(b) Death drops from pacifists should not be visible to other players.
---
(c) MOB tunnel vision. MOBs that are agro to other characters should ignore pacifists until that combat is resolved or the pacifist takes a pot shot.
---
{Item C would be done with phantom teams. When a MOB is triggered it is triggered for "whole team" to which the offending player belongs. If someone not belonging to that team also triggers the MOB explicitly, the newcomer's team is temporarily merged with the initial team. If pacifists can only agro idle MOBs passively then most of the kiting nonsense is prevented. As a bonus, if everyone is always in a team then when the teams merge the team buffs would naturally merge. Ta Dah!}
---
(d) track all dynamic events back to the first actor to determine if damage "counts". That is If Alice is a pacifist and Bob (and only Bob) shoots the car Alice is hiding behind, when that car is set alight and then explodes, the damage is "from Bob" and so does not injure Alice.
---
FO4 could already figure out that a given scenery explosion was caused by a particular entity. If Piper set a car to burning and I had the "cant be hurt by my companion" perk active, the resultant explosion would be harmless to me.
---
So what we need is that logic reinstated to track source-to-dest damage so that it can "go around" pacifists and the things they own.
---
If the engine is rational it shouldn't be that hard.
---
Yeah Ive never been trolled
---
but I really really want a PvP server. I really really dont like slap damage. 
---
Again, I want to feel the risk of danger when encountering someone. Slap damage negates that danger. Splitting PvE and PvP servers that youc an actively switch between might heighten that danger too high. 
---
so you can actually get from one keypad to the other, and target it, in 4 seconds?  You are a god my man :)  I can't get it done :(
---
I wonder if it's defines somehow by your card loadout, in combination with what you are wearing and weapons used etc.. the game certainly thinks I am millipede than has been split in two anyway.....
---
I like your train of thought here.  
---
I originally locked my water purifiers, steel collector and doors, but eventually realized, what did that gain me? I now leave everything unlocked. If I notice someone visiting my camp, I tend to fast travel back and drop some aid items. As long as they don’t try to break anything, I love people visiting my camp.
---
Not really true.  The only enemy that requires hundreds of rounds is the Scorchbeast Queen, and soloing other Scorchbeasts might require some ammo but isn't bad really.  I can solo Scorchbeasts with my gatling (with all the wrong legendary mods, it has Medic but I don't use it with VATS (extra weapon, so I can keep my primary in full repair for Queen battles).
---
Everything else still goes down quickly enough.  The Queen if people aren't cheating (stacking bobbleheads on top of Explosive weapons) won't ever die too quickly, even with TSE players around.
---
For me it was to try new builds and perks. 
---
Even now with a newly minted 8 I have started to see my play style change more than the first two (which for the life of me I don't know why; stopped at 40 each).
---
I have found new places with each one so the discovery aspect didn't diminish for me.
---
Then again I don't try to grind either. I rarely do quests and the only reason i'll cap a workshop is for the plans. SO I play sorta strangely I guess....
---
No matter the amount of bullets I put into him though (and a couple power fist hits) he took 0 like completely invincible. He would also just emote and taunt me to add to the matter.
---
Well hhmm I can maybe get a screen shot and send it to you via pm in a while. Remind me if I forget 
---
Here you go.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ah199n/to_put_peoples_mind_at_ease_about_the_pvp_mode
---
It does make your feedback more relevent as its a reality now
---
Problem is the game is horribly unbalanced when it comes to PvP. The fact that regular armor outshines Power Armor by leaps and bound isn’t how it should be.
---
Then they should put double on weapons that only have one round but the two shot modifier and make it again like double were it takes two reloads not just one. 
---
The Mutant's modifier can stop at 5 so it's a plus 50. Not going to destroy everything but still going to be a big boost.
---
I actually like that my crossbow isn't as powerful as my gauss rifle. It keeps the weapon honest. If that makes any sense. Like I can only really be effective with it while sneaking and it certainly isn't going to win any major firefights. However I would like more mods for the thing. At least a glow sight or a scope. Different skins would also be really nice.
---
This nerf actually kills one of my favorite weapons, it's a two shot crossbow with 10% damage while aiming. Closest I've gotten to having a usable one haha
---
The two-shot variant of the weapon takes the base weapon damage *with mods*, and adds the base damage *without* mods in the paper damage (listed damage). When firing, this damage value is halved, and each projectile deals half of the total damage. If both bullets hit one target, it only uses damage reduction once - treating both projectiles as a single shot, meaning it's better at penetrating armor.
---
So for instance, you have a hunting rifle. I don't know the real numbers, but let's say it has base 40 damage. With the 50. cal reciever you put on it, it deals 56 damage. Now, let's say you find a two-shot hunting rifle. It's going to have its damage listed as 80. Base damage plus base damage. Now, you mod it by adding .50 reciever. Now it shows 96 damage - modified base of 56 plus standard base of 40. When you fire, each bullet will deal 48 damage. If both hit one enemy, their damage resistance will be calculated as if they were hit by a single 96 damage projectile. This is what I was trying to explain. It's not as good as most think. Try a anti armor 50% limb damage rifle and shoot something in the head and you'll get the same one shot effect as a tse rifle 
---
Thank you for the clarification!
---
What happened with TSE weapons?
---
This is when I start engaging them after the thumbs down emote is ineffective... They'll shoot back and die or attempt to ignore however if you stand close enough they'll eventually wipe themselves out. Part of the online gaming experience.  
---
I would assume it is a game setting similar to pacifist that people have to opt in and out of. And to prevent cheating, only people that opt into the pvp setting can fight with other pvp people. So person A and person B both have to have the setting set to pvp and there are no rules between them. If person C is set to pacifist, they cannot enter pvp combat with person A or B (workshops will be an exemption). Person D is set to default, the pvp for them would act how it does now, there must be consent from both parties before pvp is engaged. This is just an idea of how it could work
---
You misunderstand me in turn.
---
Alice is a pacifist.
---
Bob is a griefer.
---
We already agree that Bob should be unable to damage Alice. So let's say that's implemented.
---
Problem is that Bob puts on his power armor and goes and pokes a nearby bear, then he runs towards Alice. Alice is forced to fight the bear and dies. Then Bob finishes off the bear and takes her loot bag.
---
This is bad.
---
So we fix the indirect griefer reward by having all death-drops by a pacifist be invisible to all other players.
---
Now Alice can deliberately drop items that Bob can pick up if she would like, but bob can not turn the environment against Alice for an indirect kill and reward.
---
All Bob can actually profit is the joy of ruining Alice's day.
---
Not a perfect solution, but very real progress.
---
So many tears on pvp. 
---
Dont rush to the east areas. Keep in mind that the area are leveled.
---
Take your time around the forest. Explore every bit of it. Gather supplies and level up.
---
Then it toxic valley around level 20.
---
Go south to ash heap and explore all until level 30/35.
---
Then go to top of the world. Do Rose quests. Explore north of the Mire until Abbies bunker. Beware that from the Savage Divide to the east all enemies are leveled according to the highest level player in the area. So if a player level 100 went by the place youll get enemies leveled for him/her. Start the BOS quest.
---
then go back. Explore Savage Divide. Beware wes tek (army of super mutants) and the caves (deathclaws and wendigos).
---
By the end of this exploration youll be level 50ish and the rest of the Mire is explorable. Start north all the way south to Watoga.
---
Rush through the city and go complete Mayor for a Day quest. 
---
Finish BOS quest.
---
Start enclave quest.
---
Launch nuke around level 60.
---
So they **ARE** removing two shot from all future drops though? But honestly the biggest change will be for PvE now because TSE was already nerfed to infinity with the new patch allowing fireproof and padded or dense armor to reduce damage to 0. SBQ bout to be a REAL time sensitive boss now haha
---
A lot of people. But the PvP system is so stupid most people can't enjoy it. Losing caps equal to you level makes a bad PvP encounter a terrible encounter. Not to mention the person who gets the first full damage shot off will usually win, so initiating it makes you at an extreme disadvantage. The system doesn't make pvp fun for anyone, except for those who accidentally get hit, who can then turn around and one shot the person and take their junk.
---
No worries.  If you can respond as to whether or not it works for you I'll include that in the bug report I'm sending to beth.  
---
I got a TSE Dragon and that thing does work. Pair that with my sneak 2.5x damage bonus and I ate the health bar up on my first shot. The fight after that was tough but it’s kind of fun downing those things. 
---
One's prob level 5
---
You can trade for them right now for 2k caps.
---
Most ppl that have them did that and it was most likely duped in the first place.
---
Near launch they traded for 20-25k caps as they were rare
---
Are you going to address how useless energy weapons are?  Like the durability is totally broken and no word from you guys on it.  
---
Nobody is using them
---
Honestly all they needed was to make better loot available if you flood a market it drops the cost online simple economics  really 
---
Nope lol. I usually get bored playing by the time I finish that run 
---
Yep, exactly what I'm saying. They should not be together.
---
So the crybaby’s won huh? That’s bullshit. Then again Bethesda is local to where I live which is full of crybabies so it shouldn’t surprise me they gave in. 
---
I play a rifleman build, two shot is not neccesary to play it. I wreck sentry bots and scorchbeasts.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb here as well and say that any TSE being sold is 99% likely to be duped. As rare as they are there is no way they would be selling for less than 15k each if they were legit. Of course that is a bit hyperbolic but it's enough to stop me from buying one. 
---
Hey there!
---
We've updated the article with the following corrections:
---
* **\[UPDATED\] Changes to the Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods**: The Two-Shot and Explosive Legendary Mods will be undergoing a few balance changes in this next patch. We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat. With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage\~\~, and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world\~\~. The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. **Note:** This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mods. **They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes**. Thank you for your feedback, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes.
---
Let me know if you need anything else cleared up!
---
That’s probably due to the fact a higher level player may have not long been there. Server hopping to a different world helped me when this happened until the were the appropriate levels.
---
Where is this posted?
---
Lol they literally don’t see it apparently. I know this update was recent, but no one below is mentioning it at all
---
They changed the language they will still drop. They are reducing 2 shot damage to +25% and explosive to +20%. Check out the article again it was updated
---
Then buff other things. Don't nerf shit it ruins the game.
---
Last two patches have destroyed end game. White spring nuke and sbq is completely pointless now
---
How exactly do you go about proving a social media account was paid for? Most of the ones they use have at least 2 years on them, most of the time with a good post background.
---
Lol. You're funny bro. I mean that. They are both lvl 50
---
The event, forget its name, but in the toxic valley where you put fertilizer in the big machines, events like that should do something to the region for x amount of time. That one should make plants give a bigger harvest. 
---
They should have one in the ash heap to make the air nontoxic for so many hours etc. 
---
And notify everyone on server. 
---
Yeah so does reloading, so does being attacked by scorched, so  does yet somehow people succeed many times.  This change is just not that large in effect.  It just means kills might take a bit longer and SBQ farming might not succeed quite as often and that has been way too easy the last month.  A little more adversity in that regard won't hurt anything.
---
That's kind of the point. 
---
How’d you get the bed? Despite having both Vault and Vault 2 plans I don’t seem to be able to ever use them.
---
Its no joke - unless you happen to be a Bethesda dev.  One has to wonder if they even play their own game.  Seems like they are so out of touch.
---
Yeah it wasnt meant to counter that. Im optimistic theyll remove the damage on explosives or sth
---
I doubt that many (if any) mods apply to the second shot. Be nice to test with some real numbers🤔 wonder if clientside PC mods would be able to show a numeric amount of health so that these things can be calculated
---
HAHAHA Nerfed even more - what a bag of fucking dicks....
---
OK, so they aren't removing two shot entirely, just probably changing the name. I'm OK with that. I'm even more OK with the explosive damage nerf. 
---
Still going to suck that melee will become king again while we plunk away at enemies with our pellet guns. 
---
I have never seen heavy combat armour plans. However mods learned from making and scrapping light combat armour can be applied to heavy armour.
---
1) I found all the plan's in Camden park. Various plans spawn in the raider camp
---
2) the "BOS" mod can be bought from both vendors in Grafton
---
3) Whilst I'm told the enclave vendors sell pieces I haven't reached them yet. But monster mash does drop heavy combat armour. Sometimes 1* 
---
Yeah its tough overall. Maybe then just a limit of only being able to switch once a day so you cant just switch depending on your task. Or maybe only be able to switch to PvE once a day. Maybe you have to choose after spending a few hours or levels in each server. Just something to reduce hopping, which I think will be a core problem
---
Im not sure about the details of the PvP server yet, but Id be down with radar so long as you cant just track people on the map and hunt them down too easily. A tracking card or tool would be cool. Im ok with radar though, as its just an RPG way of indicating the characters awareness (mixed with map locations.) So if you crouch and sneak up, you wont show up on radar
---
Can someone clarify???? Are they actually nerfed or just talking about it?
---
use mini nukes and plasma grenades so you trash everyones PA while doing little to no damage to SBQ. 
---
Thanks for clarifying!  It's a very suspicious change though =P
---
Saving levels bars you from unlocking new perks as you level
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314304/bethesda-two-shot-wrong-nerf/2?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/314304/bethesda-two-shot-wrong-nerf/2?language%5B%5D=en)
---
This makes more sense 
---
This is what they did for Ultima Online. There was Trammel, which was PVE only, and Felucca which had unrestricted pvp. I think all you need to do is make it so that your PVE only characters can ONLY play on PVE servers and your PVP only characters cannot transfer to the PVE ones. You'd want to keep the economies separate, and you'd want there to be a reason for people to be farming mats, using the workshops, and so on. You wouldn't want people to be leveling on the pve and then jumping over to pvp just to find fights because all that turns into is an arena. And if you want an arena, just build an arena pvp queue so that people don't have to fumble around trying to find people to fight.
---
Thanks buddy :)
---
In short, yes and no. Like you, I don't participate in PvP, but I have found 90% of the PvP instigators use them. They walk up to you and shoot you with something like a 10mm pistol, then as soon as you agree they switch to their TSE and lay waste to you.
---
I recently found a TSE Revolver and I have tons of fun with it, even if I do occasionally get a little too close to the enemies and get myself killed by my own hand.
---
I think there is definitely a sense of jealousy from those that don't have one, but if the people that have them aren't instigating PvP for the easy kill, it negates some of the complaint.
---
can't stop laughing

I just like to poke the bear a bit! I understand some people like it but I would say majority of people find it a hinderance. I like the idea of Pve and pvp servers. Make pvp servers level balanced in levels and make it full out pvp no restrictions. If you’re into that sort of thing and head into a world like that, at least you know you can be shot or get shot at, at any time 
---
HOLY F*CKING SH*T, YES!!!
---
A critical hit headshot with better criticals equipped is going to instantly kill players in most cases without TS, so I'm not sure why that matters. Especially if you get the +50% crit damage modifier on your weapon, and/or give it extra crit damage recievers.
---
TS also has absolutely terrible accuracy in VATS so it's hampering VATS characters in other ways already. 
---
I'm experiencing the same. Very frustrating because I've invested a lot time in the game and enjoy it when it is stable. Example, last session it crashed 5 times. Twice after I spent many resources setting up a claimed area. Sometimes it crashes a few seconds into login AFTER a crash. It's very ridiculous. Strangely, after a month of disaster they still can't fix the core issue. Just got updated again (which took an hour) yesterday and it crashed immediately. I think the patches are not working ;)
---
Just frustrating. Ruining the game. Buff other things. Nerfing everything for balance destroys even the best of games
---
Wrong. Only Explosive bobble heads stack. No other bobble head stacks. And it’s a bug. Also slap damage is capped. You can’t pass it unless you flag for pvp (workshops, revenge, go wanted.) 
---
If you have any proof that slap damage can one hit you please submit it. 
---
Those would be pretty cool tbh.
---
Bloodied comes with the obvious low health tradeoff. 
---
@JessBethesda,
---
The clarification helps a good deal, but it still reinforces for many the apparent disconnect between what is actually a problem in game and what Bethesda/Zenimax "feels" is an issue.  
---
**Examples:**  
---
"Fixing" Feed the people which results in effectively no one doing that Event, and Nerfing Public workshops, that people rarely took and held for any significant gain.  
---
**In this case...**  
---
Blooded+Explosive, or Instigating+Explosive will effectively net the same effect in most cases, even with the Nerf I'd be willing to wager, because it's not resolving the root of the problem.  
---
Nearly every MMO I've had the pleasure of playing worked with a few select groups in the Community, hard core / over power prone players, to make sure the "real" issues are being address.. **These updates feel like they are coming from someone who doesn't actually play the game, but is making changes that look good on paper.**  
---
That I can understand. Thank you... I tried going into a nuke zone, and found that the only way to get drops is to spray into a crowd with a shotgun or SMG, hoping to hit as many as possible before the explosions took them out. Realistically, though, if that wasn't there, battles would last forever, and depending on how much time you have, this could be a blessing or a curse. I think a domino effect may happen, but I don't know. Growing pains of this game are hard to deal with sometimes. 
---
Tbh that’s on you for not storing or selling your scrap after obtaining that much over hours of play. 
---
There's also loading screens which say marine armor is second only to power armor, and that's clearly not true.
---
When do you get the somerset? I’m 56 and I don’t think I have it yet. 
---
&gt;I've already got mine so I'm fine with this
---
OK, kid.
---
What do you mean? Do I need to use my perk points in order to get new ones? 
---
Those deadbeats have been teasing us since beta.
---
Turn down your settings :)
---
Can you get your named changed to "Captain" Cookie?
---
This is exactly what I wanted to hear. Want to retract the comment I made on here. Thank you for listening! This is awesome!
---
That was fucking fast! 
---
Clearly you havent gotten any legendary rolling pins
---
Yeah, sorry if I wasn't clear in my comment.  I meant removing the potential for future drops.  IE Removed from the Loot table, not your already acquired drops.
---
Means the prices go up, and the dupers can sell them for more =/
---
Max caps you could sell something for before mist recent patch was 5k. I'm guessing you use a ton more ammo than I do.
---
As for events, the only ones I Do are Census Violence and Distant Thunder. Of the two times I've seen Patrol Duty since release it was way too long for too little reward. The Enclave events are crap unless you love scout armor, or need them for the quest chain. The Rest are just there and just plain are useless. 
---
It's a Trap is Broken. I've seen it 3 maybe 4 times and it bugs and you cant activate the trap. 
---
I've Fast travelled to events and either the event will not start, or fails as I load in. I've had multiple times of Census Violence Bugging and not starting, but another instance of the event will show on the map elsewhere while the previous bugged event still shows on the map.
---
The Frequency of Events needs looking into as well. Patrol Duty, It's a Trap, and Flyswatter seem to occur so rarely in contrast to The Messenger or Line in the Sand.
---
Horde Events are bugged. especially when starting via fast travel as the location you spawn at seems to be totally random and nowhere near the event at all.
---
If Certain mods or Plans only drop from Events they need to be not so super incredibly rare. I've done dozens of Distant Thunder events, and I have only a T51b left leg plan and right leg plan to show for it. Also it makes more sense to get plans more often as opposed to getting a Gauss Rifle or Gatling Plasma Magically dumped into my inventory.
---
Or...loot their junk bag and leave a fertilizer in it. 
---
As a sniper I can tell you i'm not hurt by this at all. If we only could take one legendary stat instead of three, I much rather have instigating over TS. My instigating pipe rifle easily drops standard enemies up to 68 on a regular basis with one shot. I have a TS combat rifle that I use to carry as a backup weapon which I rarely used honestly. 
---
I kinda just thought she came across as s kind of “tiny tina” from borderlands. Even the sign for the gang that is outside looks like borderlands art.
---
It's a difference that is NOT explained by the system and should be.
---
See here's the thing your weapons break so fast because you use two shot, it makes weapons break faster. And it's very much a needed Nerf as it was ruining any form of ranged build diversity using anything else was gimping yourself. 
---
You don't need twoshot you need game knowledge like how weak points work and how stealth or vats crits work or how to make a proper build instead of relying on a single op weapon to do all your dmg regardless of perks. 
---
Hell non twoshot non explosive pistols can 2 or 3 tap most "endgame" level opponets(besides queens claws and the like) with the right build you just have to have a clue what your doing and pistols are far from "meta"
---
okay, so a zero cost for deaths. I personally would like that. On 7 days to die there is a scrolling option for difficulty and what you drop when you die is one of the options. I think being able to control that seems like a good enough idea to me. 
---
It’s called the Simple Modern Bed.
---
Preach it brother!
---
It's in the talk for January 17th.
---
 Unless they remove all Explosive damage I doubt I will be impacted. It does not matter much to me as I kinda hate to pull it out. It solves the problem simply and my skill is in solving it with what I have. I'm quite good at that and my long ass fights with enemies well over my level is kinda what I do. So its backup.
---
All I know is if it doesn't drop a Nocturnal Wood Leg, I AM DISAPPOINT!
---
Sounds about right - I'd go lower personally because modifiers are allowed to come into play.  If it was unmodified damage, 20% would still leave a really good mod to have.
---
Lol you too!  Since my two-shot pump action (level 50) does twice the damage of my normal pump action (level 50).  Maybe you remember wrong or the explosive effect interferes.  Or maybe it's karma from buying duped guns.
---
So far you dont even need a lot of junk, people are just too used to hoarding it
---
Buffing shit can ruin the game too. They need to make the weapons more balanced, and are trying to do so by nerfing the mod.
---
Because even with the small chance that you’ll get into PVP against someone with the mods, getting one shot by them wasn’t fun 
---
This would be fantastic. My only concern would be how heavily it is tested before releasing to the public, the last thing people need is it accidentally triggering somehow.
---
This is where I found mine.  Thank you very much!
---
Anything nocturnal 
---
24 hours seems like a long time. WoW and Star Wars Galaxies had around a few minutes timer I think, which worked well. If you turn it on in SWG it would take a minute or so to activate and your name would be flashing, so people would know when you went combatant. It would take a few minutes to turn it off also. In WoW you could activate it immediately, even by just hitting a pvp enabled player. To turn it off, if you were on a PvE or RP server it would take around a few minutes if I remember correctly, while not engaging in any further PvP.
---
Awesome.  I am happy you all are listening.  :)
---
While I have you - would it be possible to fix the (COMPLETELY SILENT) Slay Bells that many of us spent Atoms on?  Mapping it to the original Tambo sound should literally take somebody a couple of minutes to do.
---
They fixed this and revised the article by the way. You can put your pitchforks down now.
---
&gt;Ok. You've conformed my suspicions that you are just a troll with no interest in the post or what its about at all but rather that you wanted to get a rise out of someone.
---
Oh I have interest in the post—interest in how unnecessary it all is. You'll find my thoughts on that in the comments above.
---
&gt;I hope your life gets better that way you dont spend your time on the internet trying find people to piss off. I really do hope things get better for you because it's sad to see someone with such a pathetic and empty life that they have nothing better to do than purposefully try to upset others and they are such garbage people that they would like to troll someone rather than find posts they agree with and spend that time making someone feel good.
---
You don't know a thing about me.
---
I've been juggling a number of tasks for the past couple of hours. Inadvertently pissing you off being one of them.
---
&gt;I wish you the best and this will be my last reply to you.
---
Sad to see you go. It was just getting good. Good luck with your ideas.
---
I.C. -- This was ye olde' Bloodborne-elemental-rifle-spear pre-patch. Jesus.
---
Good think we now see that it is addressed as well. looking forward to it.
---
Hi there!
---
We've seen questions surrounding this new mode, so we've updated the article with the following clarification:
---
* **\[UPDATE\]:** We’ve received questions about our new mode and want to clarify that this mode will be playable separately **– it will be a new option accessed from the Main Menu**. This mode will be designed for fans that want a more hardcore PvP experience. The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
I hope that helps clear anything up, and let me know if you have any questions!
---
It'd be nice if Bethesda would just give us the information themselves so we didn't have to go figuring it out but yeah.
---
I can't stand the weapon mods that say crap like "superior recoil" or "superior armor penetration." Give me numbers damnit. 
---
Interesting idea, but I like to swap back and forth personally.
---
This is fantastic! Good to hear about. I love that perk in the other fallout games. 
---
Easy solution to that is to remove the buff from the demo perks. If they can flip a switch and make the M79 stop benefitting from shotgun perks it shouldn't be too hard to change this.
---
Wait, it says that the Two Shot mod can no longer be looted in the world... Is that the mod itself or does that include weapons that already have the mod?
---
Not only that it'll add more damage than the additional projectile 
---
 The wiki explains how two-shot prefix works and why it isn't double damage. The two-shot variant of the weapon takes the base weapon damage *with mods*, and adds the base damage *without* mods in the paper damage (listed damage). When firing, this damage value is halved, and each projectile deals half of the total damage. If both bullets hit one target, it only uses damage reduction once - treating both projectiles as a single shot, meaning it's better at penetrating armor.
---
So for instance, you have a hunting rifle. I don't know the real numbers, but let's say it has base 40 damage. With the 50. cal reciever you put on it, it deals 56 damage. Now, let's say you find a two-shot hunting rifle. It's going to have its damage listed as 80. Base damage plus base damage. Now, you mod it by adding .50 reciever. Now it shows 96 damage - modified base of 56 plus standard base of 40. When you fire, each bullet will deal 48 damage. If both hit one enemy, their damage resistance will be calculated as if they were hit by a single 96 damage projectile.
---
Someone should start a petition so we can junk these into toilet paper.
---
Yes it will, so you spend a bit more time securing ammo.  You will make it through this transition, I know you can!
---
People have to get close to you to use melee. With a TSE rifle they can just one hit you from far away 
---
Ah, that's the issue then. You'll get a new pack at level 30, so hopefully it will be in there. It sucks sometimes having to wait for a card you really want.
---
The options given were kinda bullshit anyways.  If he illustrated his point a little less bias I may see a point.  I personally haven't observed any deception, but if its there, this thread certainly doesn't oust it.
---
To be confirmed 
---
I don't know why you're getting downvoted.  I've been disconnected from the server about every 20-30 minutes today. And what I do isn't being saved. I moved camp and am completely rebuilding. After I get disconnected when I log back in the last few things I did are undone. Like I planted 12 corn and 12 tato, after a disconnect none were planted.
---
And items are replicating in my camp storage again. 86 corn, 54 razor grain etc.
---
I don’t think they know quite yet how to fix demolition expert in relation to guns and not mess up actual explosives.  Otherwise that would have been a better fix.  
---
This isn’t really game changing.  In the example you gave, the damage will take 2 shots on high level enemies instead of 1.   
---
The bigger fix is the elimination of the two shot weapons.  Sooner or later the cheaters are going to get tired of playing and abandon the game sooner rather than later.  The only TSE that will be used will be the legit ones.   
---
Yes thank you for your insightful yet repetitive post reiterating a point that had been made 20 times in the last hour on other threads. 
---
Hello!
---
We've updated the article with the following corrections regarding the mods changes:
---
Please let me know if you have any questions!
---
Oh no Marlo. Melee is sooo Op compared to snipe one shot killing players with a shotgun form 200 yards. Nothing broken there. Especially because they are all legit and definitely not duped. RIP TSE you will be missed, but this was entirely necessary.   
---
P.S. if you initiate pvp and cant shoot somone to death before they can run 20m to kill you with melee you are doing it wrong.
---
 So what do you think they will do?
---
Might depend where you are then. I'm in the UK and the cheapest/shittiest vodka you generally get is Glenns, and even that comes in a glass bottle
---
"normally" with godmode enabled you mean lol.  In a nuclear wasteland with mutants and plague, yet nothing can kill you.  XD
---
Here's the thing, those combinations you listed would be stronger as Furious + explosive or Instigating + explosive (which exist in the game and arent going anywhere). At least this way we would have more item variety as it would compete with explosive. It would also allow different builds that dont run demo expert to compete with damage 
---
I love the cultist blade 
---
ah first time seeing them and was like...WHAT?
---
Good band name
---
I will, but I don't want to. Or maybe I'll make enough noise to make a difference. 
---
Interesting. People never cease to amaze me.
---
They always manage to make it worse...
---
The way I've noticed was the sub stations' alarms going off.
---
Well, no shit. That's your fault if you got rid of them.
---
I literally cannot tell if this post and comment are sarcasm or not like am I the dumb one for not automatically assuming that OP is kidding by saying that thats Steve Carell or are y’all the idiots for thinking thats steve carell? If its clear sarcasm then sorry lol I’ll accept the downvotes
---
I’m very grateful for these types of players as well. It took me a while to even purchase the game, because I thought it was going to be another RDR2 Online style, where whomever you run into will try and kill you. 
---
However, I bought it and within the first hour I encounter a high level and just froze. He just gave me some nice starter gear and led me to my first PA frame. Ever since that encounter I always go out of my way to find a low level of they’re near and drop them some good stuff. I always include a teddy bear also, just as an extra sign of encouragement. 
---
He is making a sentence out of  ARGHBVOGBUOIEUR 
---
Buff other things so everything in the game is a 1 shot kill? Are you serious? Get Gud Scrub.
---
Something bypasses slap damage then if it is not stacked bobbleheads. I'm always in pacifist mode, don't claim workshops, never wanted, and I've been 1-shotted by explosive shotguns three times this week. So, if that's not stacked explosive bobbleheads, what is it?
---
Yea but the complaints worked lol. They just changed the notes.
---
nice todd listened to me!
---
I tamed a lvl 5 toad, had it for a few days. Didn’t fix the problem. 
---
Eve Online has a good system, and a lot of "Care Bears" love Eve Online. They play as miners, traders, engineers, mission runners, etc. They play generally in high sec space. In High sec space ships appear and kill anyone who commits an illegal act, like firing upon another player. There could be Responders who respond to protect people if fired on or killed in high security areas in FO76. That doesn't mean people won't do it, it just means there are systems in place to deter it and make people feel safer doing whatever they want to do. Responders wanting to preserve the last few surviving humans would be motivated to protect them I guess. It fits in with the story. But in higher level areas and pvp zones then it would be much more risky. Risk makes a game more fun. You're not 100% safe. Just like if you lived in a post apocalyptic work, you wouldn't feel safe. Why should you? There are a lot of crazy people, radiated, hungry, thirsty, mutated, etc. That feeling of risk adds another level to how a game is experienced.
---
That should've been there day one.
---
Also they've had gauss, lever and dragon so this isn't buffing anything.
---
Let's add a gun that should've been there and make it 165% less damage than the other rifles... Not a buff.
---
It will still be effective, just it may take 2 shots instead of 1.  It’s the explosive damage that does the bulk of the damage.
---
Hooo boy there’s gonna be some whining man babies on here when that update goes live. It hasn’t gone live yet, end of the month is what it says on the link op provided. 
---
why even use guns when with melee you don't have to worry about ammunition and it wil lstill be just as strong?
---
I just checked the article and it hasn't updated. Was this just a twitter update?
---
This is bullshit.  I refuse to have to kill high level  enemies with two shots instead of one!  Totally unplayable!!
---
they only added that after I made my post :P
---
Not saying SBs aren't annoying, but you can dodge their attacks, you just can't hide behind cover. That part isn't what bugs me, I think it's kinda fun since there aren't many other attacks you can dodge in the Fallout universe
---
It's because this reddits filled with a bunch of people head over heels blatantly ignoring the bugs in this game, aswell as a bunch of people who think this game is the living embodiment of hell itself. 
---
Yes, I was reading the thread. I'll edit my post.
---
I've just decided not to do the requirements if I don't want to take part.....
---
Not trying to rag necessarily, but given the feedback received here on Reddit, I'm curious; how are these decisions being made? It's clear there was some thought on how to change weapons, but why was it initially just Two-Shot and not explosive, and why did the inability to loot these in world also change with this update?
---
If these were already considered before the original article was posted, why weren't they included until these issues were brought up here? It would be nice to see how these initial considerations were weighed and balanced I guess...
---
I am doing it now.  It's a bit tedious, but also has some challenges.  It makes you really notice the perk cards you don't have until x level.
---
My high level is a rifle/snipe, and the lowbie is a heavy gunner.  Very different.  I have made it to level 30 and still don't have a single heavy gunner perk card, nor fusion core extender card.  That's a challenge.  I have a lvl20 two shot gat which carries me, which is nice. 
---
I am done with all quests at level 30, except for Taggerty and Watoga Mayor.  This really surprised me, not only how much easier all the quests were at level ~20'ish, but also the low xp rewarded for doing all these quests.
---
Ammo supply has been my main obstacle all along.   Acid is the most treasured commodity in this game.
---
I've read that it caps at +200%
---
***The more you know***
---
Who at BGS said they are nerfing TS and not touching explosive?  Or could it be that its easier to deal with TS for now, and splody stuff will be dealt with later, and maybe TS could be adjusted back up once that happens?  
---
Yeah and they aren't removing two-shot entirely.  Just lowering the damage and probably changing its name,  which I can deal with. I just hope I don't have to waste all my time ammo farming now because a single super mutant eats 30 bullets. 
---
good
---
Great now all of my legendary weapons are nerfed im fucking done. Even more angry now. 
---
Easy fix would be to make it powered from the other side. 
---
Oh no, you're actually going to have to try now....
---
When does it take affect and can you send link?
---
What the difference? I have to hit back to start pvp aka I'll be in melee range
---
I'm so happy about this.
---
All the redditors duped Two Shot Keyboards.
---
This is bullshit.  I refuse to have to kill high level  enemies with two to three shots instead of one!  Totally unplayable!!
---
Pro-tip: Put down a campfire. Now put your small water purifier on top of it. It won't want to place easily, but there's an area on the fire that technically counts as dirt. Place it on that, then move it by selecting only the campfire. You can now place it inside and anywhere you want. Just gotta do a little design to hide the raised concrete block floor.
---
I've got my rad arch and water purifier on a single campfire. They are carried around like a little unit. Have water and rad healing that fits snug and looks good inside any 1x1 square.
---
but not a 1 shot kill everything so boohoo he's crying
---
Use logic. 
---
Buff enemies, then other guns to match.
---
Hmmm. For some reason, the strike-through isn't working. The "and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world" should have the strike-through line.
---
The mods will still be available in the world! They'll just have some balance changes.
---
Actually, I completely agree. I think PvP done right is exciting and adds longevity and meaning to a game but Camp-stomping is just knocking over sandcastles for the sheer joy of annoying someone else.
---
&gt;SBQ bout to be a REAL time sensitive boss now haha
---
Right!  Gonna be staying the fuck away from Fissure Prime after this nerf... 
---
It still says they are making two shot non-lootable
---
I have over 90 explosive vents, if that gives you any indication of how often I kill the SBQ. I still haven't seen evidence that it is as pervasive as reddit seems to think it is. I think this is fallout 76's version of those stupid challenges like the cinnamon challenge or fire challenge. They exist to be sensational, but it's not like it's an epidemic. Yet, at least.
---
For now, I'm trying to suggest ways that others might possibly try out new things and make new ways to get more fun out of the game. Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I think syncing up in team events is fun
---
I just meant that I dont want to hit level 100 and have all the perks for both PVE and PVP that I can swap between, and then need to level another secondary character just to be able to do the second option.
---
Sure, I'm sure it will still be good, but I was wondering if it would still be the best. Betheada updated their post to show they are nerfing explosive down to 25% instead of 100% as well. 
---
I agree they should be scrappable and have a higher chance to get a mod off them. Not legendary effects just mods you may not have yet, and maybe more junk for scrapping them too.
---
See here's the thing there have been perks out there that do fine dmg but weren't even looked at due to how overpowered tse is, and likely still won't be looked at post Nerf because people will still gravitate to what has the largest attack vallue 90% of the time(explosive and mutants), because making a build is hard, figuring out game mechanics and using them is hard so everyone will just flock twords big numbers regardless of how much dmg it is doing compatibly.
---
I'll rank those immeadiatley! Thanks! 
---
This would be amazing
---
No connection/server/blue screen/random dc errors on FO76.  Welcome! (Laughs manically)
---
They already edited what they said. 
---
Get good 
---
Considering that is exactly how I've gotten one-shot killed, when minding my own business....I agree.
---
Ok, only ask because I bought a plan for 700 caps once and the vendor still had just 200, this was before Christmas too. So I'm thinking that was changed recently, or I just got screwed over lol. Still such a strange system... only a percentage of the caps? I just miss the bartering mechanic since I've come off recent playthoughs of FO1 and Morrowind
---
THE WEAPON WAS BULLSHIT ANYWAY. 
---
It's near the top of the subreddit.
---
I get it, few people want to give up an advantage.  Good luck either way.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agzo5e/inside_the_vault_is_out/eealpv4/?context=1000
---
if you found the bobble heads you should be able to use them as you please.
---
What if you could only switch servers once or twice a day? That seems like a solid compromise that still solves the issue
---
Lool
---
Nerfing everything and adding no content ruins any game.
---
GOOD.
---
I'm not happy with messing with TS explosive I get explosive. Well see how its goes. If they pull a Destiny I'm gone. At least Outer Worlds is coming out in a bit wouldn't mind a change of scenery of the same genre
---
I don't care about chances of getting mods and whatnot, I just want materials to keep rebuilding my shack after everyone keeps destroying it. 
---
even without curator thats 2 hours of 1 shotting everyone with their infinite bobbleheads
---
Yeah happened today. Died, got not respawn points on the map (not even vault 76), server crashed, lost all junk, lost progression on an daily event I was doing.
---
Turned off the console and went out shopping.
---
I just wish I could atleast store my weapons and aid in the stash, 80% of my stash weight is just scrap and im running around with 200 worth of weight just by weapons alone, I like collecting guns and im not sure what materials are needed besides the important stuff like optic fibre, black titanium and so
---
Yea just saw that.   Back to using the Blade of Baset and All Rise.  I’ll turn my TSE Handmade into a sniper rifle.
---
there's so many horror stories of griefers that you really can't blame newbs for being a little gun shy. 
---
&gt; the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage
---
This still isn't accurate. Two-shot currently adds the weapon's base damage, before modifications. This differs but generally works out to about +80% apparent damage. That damage is then split equally over two (or eight) projectiles which are fired with a fairly significant penalty to accuracy and recoil. In isolation two-shot is only so strong against targets that are close enough to guarantee both projectiles hit. Two-shot should be brought in to line with Bloodied (+50% damage at low life), Anti-Armor (approximately +28.9% damage) and Furious (against enemies that can survive more than six hits). You should definitely leave it alone as it applies to shotguns currently, adding 1 shotgun pellet is only +14% damage.
---
&gt; The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%. 
---
This is even more different from the mod description. Explosive says it should add 15 flat explosive damage, which is in itself fine. However in combination with any shotgun or two-shot weapon it is adding multiple independent explosions, this is what has to be adjusted. The best possible fix you can implement is: **Split the explosion damage equally over all projectiles**.
---
Explosive is also being affected by at least one and possibly all of the following bugs which is causing its damage to scale way beyond expectation:
---
* Explosion damage is scaling with the equipped weapon perks for up to +72.4% damage.
---
* Each explosion can strike the same target multiple times. Speculation suggests it is hitting multiple limbs multiplying damage by up to 6 times against a player.
---
Not bugs, but may be worth considering:
---
* Demolition expert. It's an explosion and if everything else were fixed, 30 flat damage wouldn't be out of line.
---
* Global damage increases - i.e. Bloody Mess.
---
**TLDR my suggestions:  
---
Have a look at how two-shot compares to other prefixes in terms of total damage.  
---
Split the Explosive Suffix's damage equally over all projectiles and fix the bugs causing it to scale unexpectedly high.**
---
I hope they mean that it's just getting changed, but the wording seemed almost like they wanted to make sure we knew they weren't removing explosive. If it's a rename then I'm down for that
---
Get better at building your character and stop relying on your one OP gun. You can become extremely powerful with a good build and any other legendary effect of your choice.
---
TSE were overpowered as fuck, get over it.
---
No, but are you not getting anything? I thought that was one of the only mods, I got it the first time on several alts... Is it possible you have it but don't have the ability to make it so the option is filtered?
---
I can see it now... new lower level comes there for the first time and we all watch as the bots roast him then go back to whatever we were doing as if nothing happened.
---
Supersledge buttercup mod
---
Seriously, a NG+ server would be fantastic
---
 From what my rather low level Explosive shotgun does, I can see why.
---
Ah, okay. But it seems there was a mistake in the article, it's updated now. Two shots will still drop.
---
I literally already said that.
---
They update the patch notes. The news is even worse. 
---
Thanks.
---
I guess removing the TSE/TS weapons will make the SBQ a bit more challenging for (newer?) players. I guess I'll switch back to my caveman melee build. :/ So will the meta only be melee going forward?
---
The only solution that works for games like this, I think.
---
What's bad about that is that there are better things for the queen. Using a  furious or bloodied weapon have proven to be more effective than a two shot 
---
I’m a lowbie I’ll keep an eye out!
---
If you need to lvl up a toon I have 2 toons, 1 main melee 70 and a 18 stealth sniper
---
maybe a beaver tooth chainsaw that lets you collect wood\*10 from a pile or something.  woo
---
Super stim packs and stim packs are different things.
---
Allow us to break down a car into two bicycles and an engine.
---
Huh I guess ill have to change my hoarding mindset from other Bethesda games and focus on the good shit like optic fibre or stuff I want or need.
---
Im not sure if I get what you mean about workshops, ive only done a handful of them so dont know what "sharing" is 
---
OMG, this is my #1 request, I really want to be able to show off all the strange stuff I collect.  It's really disappointing that we can't.
---
They're all pretty useless.
---
It would be kind of cool if there were a few unique quest reward items that were worth using.
---
Right now it's all 100% trash.
---
Well now the are nerfing both, they edited the article
---
Me and my gruop have been experiancing the same thing. Some servers are... fine. They work and aren't too laggy. A big majority are just... fucked. Can't open doors, can't pull up crafting menu, can't activate locks, takes a million years to load in somewhere. 
---
Yeah, even after clarifying the wording seems weird. "Still available in the game" can have a few different meanings. 
---
Clearing the same hordes you've cleared a 1000+ times gets annoying fast.. If you've used tse you'd understand what a relief it is.
---
I don't use it constantly, only when I'm trying to quickly get something done
---
At level 8 you couldn't make the same camp.
---
And i bet at level 8 tonnes of camp bugs that ate up budget were still in place
---
Pretty sure your HP only increases with points in Endurance as opposed to Endurance + your level like in FO4.
---
That’s Steve Carell
---
My good deed of the day - A legendary pipe rifle dropped (it might have been 3*, definitely at least 2*). I was never going to use it. It had a lvl 20 minimum, so I looked at the map and found a lvl 22 player. Moseyed on over to their camp and handed it over. A quick ♥ emoji and off I popped. That gun was a monster and I reckon they'll be using it for a while
---
You were only supposed to nerf the explosive legendary effect....
---
The reduction to 20% is correct, now just remove the ability to buff with perk cards.
---
Leave 2 shot how it was please.
---
So you deserve to be punished for buying items from other players even if you did not know it was duped.? C'mon bro. You didn't do anything wrong just for buying stuff on reddit from other players. 
---
So when they say "find", does that mean looting off legendary foes or in world containers? 
---
Then it is duping that is the problem here.
---
There are definitely a lot of ways to enable this and that is one of them. I was just saying that if all you do is enable the scrapping of legendaries (say, by flipping a switch), then you're going to get complaints. If there were other steps involved, you'd get less accidental scrapping, but you'd get people complaining about how there are too many steps involved.
---
It'll be interesting to see what, if anything, Bethesda finally does about them.
---
You can search it on YouTube. I have yet to see any videos showing it can actually happen. Just that it can’t happen. And I’m not begging. I just want lies to stop being spread. 
---
Bethesda has done enough to make this game hard for fans to love. Players need to Stop making shit up just for upvotes. 
---
Yeah it happened to me aswel. Well i managed to launch a nuke but when fast  traveling to the blast zone the game crashed. 
---
I opened a post and some people have issues with this, I think a good compromise would be a limit to switching servers to once a day, or just a limit on switching to pve
---
**Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you?**
---
Of all the ones I've done, I can't say I've found any of them particularly rewarding, except Fertile Soil as a newbie. 
---
**Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?**
---
Powering Up X is something I avoid at this point. They take too long for the rewards, especially considering I have a lousy sense of direction and I find I get turned around and lost easily in these power plants. And I'm just not going to repeat them enough to learn my way around because, again, the rewards don't match the time sunk into them.
---
I liked Tea Time as a newbie, too, but I dislike standing around, waiting for the animals to show up. Same thing with Corpse Flowers. Did that one once and never again. 
---
Destroy the X Horde was fun the first time I did it. I fast traveled to take out a Super Mutant horde and when I landed the horde was nearby. They were a challenge compared to my level at that time, so it was fun. The next several times I did that same event, once with Super Mutants, once with Mole Miners, once or twice with Ghouls, I fast traveled to the event location only to discover that the horde was somewhere else on the map, in a couple of potential spots - far enough away that I needed to fast travel again. Just no. I have since given up on the Horde events and refuse to do them. The horde should be within a reasonable walking/sprinting distance of the event spot indicated on the map, not another fast travel.
---
**Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why?**
---
I find just about everything in the game more fun with other players, whether I'm playing online with an IRL friend or a random player, but most of the time if I'm not playing with my friend I'm doing an event solo because no one else ever shows up for them.
---
**What types of events would you like to see in the game?**
---
For me the most fun events are the ones that involve combat, not go fix something or escort this bot.
---
**How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?**
---
I actually don't join events anymore. With the cap on vendors and vendor caps, Nuka caps are too valuable for me to waste fast traveling to events that end just as I'm arriving. And then I'm either stuck in that part of the map or spending caps to go elsewhere. Until there is a timer, unless I happen to be right next to the event when it starts, I'm not doing an event. Tired of wasting caps on events that I end up not being able to participate in. 
---
How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?
---
I always enjoy working for Atoms doing challenges. If a timer is made part of events and there's a way to earn Atoms from doing them I would probably make an effort to do them.
---
Speaking of Atoms - I'm actually happy to spend earned Atoms AND spend actual dollars to buy Atoms (I bought the 4,000 Atoms bundle over Christmas to get the lights and snowman bundle), but there is so little stuff I want in the Atoms shop. I don't know what your sales are like, but please add more nice camp items (clean rugs, clean curtains, clean beds with different bedding, clean working stoves and fridges, hanging plants, etc.) and more clothing and PA skins. 
---
Glad you brought logic and understanding to the table.
---
Lol people got mad.  I was just joking 🤷‍♂️
---
Don't forget perks like Tank Killer not working either. 
---
How did they *misunderstand* their own written down patch notes?
---
We really just need to have community raid/dungeon events for major towns/locations with Bosses. Having the ability to claim a town and have it be Mob free for X amount of time and possibly give the whole server a buff would be pretty fun. You already have, grafton monster, mothman, etc.
---
Triggers and bumpers go down by percentages. Trigger is like 25% bumper is like 10%? L1 l2 r1 r2 for playstation. Not sure on the amount, but it saves sliding the whole bar.
---
Flux would need more applications before any more acquisition options should be added to the game. Decon showers and making PA parts (which plans for are stupidly rare) are the only real uses for that. I am sure quite a few people are swimming in flux, I have about 20 of each personally.
---
It would only really be in contention due to the cap sale value of flux. It will probably ended up being used by people to get vendor trash so they can just sell that and leave people who will need it SoL. I can see it being abused more than used for it's intended purpose. 
---
I understand where you are coming from, but without a need for it, it seems like it would be redundant and "harder" than a nuke zone. At least there, a lot of people don't bother picking up hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluid anymore. 
---
If down the road where base recipes for all high end crafts require it, it would be a reasonable workshop for them to add.
---
Right but twice as many is useless when you don’t have space to carry them because your stash is full and you’re overemcumbered 
---
It fires two; I've even miss with o e on occasion... And kill the guy behind my target (TS lever action, non-explosive)
---
Yup skipped the last sentence lol my bad. But either way its bs and I hate it. 
---
Well, looks like with the upcoming TSE nerf I'll be able to change my build a bit if I can get a new weapon. Dropping 5 from int and not using Demo Master will let me move stuff around.
---
A whole week, eh?
---
Nope, I have had the same camp from level 10 to level 39, there is no budget increase as I am still at 99% max budget.
---
Now, I have had things disappear, like turrets, then I have to move my camp to get them back, normally though, it will dupe the blueprints and I have to scrap all of the additional items that it created.  Once I am done with that, I am back at 99% budget.  The only thing that I can add right now is one wire.  After I add the wire, then attach option is gone from all the attachable items.
---
I think that you have encountered the camp move budget bug.  One of my friends had this, moved camp, at over 100%, scrapped everything, budget at 0%.  Okay start building, Fusion Generator doesn't move the needle, adding 2 turrets, finally he is at 3%.  Now, he keeps trying to recreate this but I think it was a 1 time exploit/bug, you might have been hit by that smooth criminal...
---
I'll have to give it a try, bums me out that I do zero pvp. I love the ability to co op but idk just think they could have gone about this better without nerfing the weapons pve damage. 
---
This is good information to have. I got involved in my first SBQ fight last night (I'm level 41). I sniped at her wings from atop the roof of that shed, sniped at the additional spawns from that same spot, and when she landed, jumped down and hacked at her legs with various melee weapons. But yeah, I noticed my shots at her wings weren't doing much damage. Next time, I'll stay down on the ground as bait. ;-) 
---
No problem, get the fuck over it or leave the game, we don't  care.
---
I see 8 errors
---
It's better then having them be overpowered and constantly duplicated because of their power.
---
Take fireproof perk. No more problems with TSE in Pvp :) 
---
My game crashed while duping 11,364 bobbleheads. Absolutely unplayable!  
---
I got killed in a fair fight because you nerfed my duplicated 10k damage OP god weapon. Absolutely unplayable!  
---
A++ comment Disco I'm seeing these people everywhere lol.
---
 Me too. I've been all through the mine a couple of times now. I have the Blade of Baset and its very good but I'm gonna try out the dagger. Do you know how strong the Health Restore is.
---
There is no weapon in the game that can one shot deathclaws and scorchbeasts
---
You’ll get to the point that you don’t care about leveling up, for example, I have 17 level ups at the moment lol. 
---
No there isn't, and adding disease has really complicated things. 
---
Level 3 lead belly means you'll never take radiation, but even Level 3 Thirst Quencher only grants 90% disease resistance.
---
That's a lot of points to spend to avoid boiling water imo. 
---
If Agility is more useful to you, take Thru Hiker and your food and drink weight almost nothing.
---
Barring that, get an SMG. Spraying it around (in passive) is also a good way of tagging the scorched.
---
lol deathclaws in flatwoods! Imagine all those lv 5 players dead lol
---
Just curious, but why does one need more than one character at a time? 
---
thank JEEZ they changed that... I mean common. I found two-shot weapons on Legendary glowing ants all day lmao 
---
Bloodied is harder to gear for than paying 2k caps and using a gun with 0 perks to compliment it.
---
Have you tried the new Fireproof perk?
---
You haven't had any psychobuff yet ;)
---
I've noticed more asshole melee players than TSE players, personally.
---
Especially in Whitesprings just sitting down on the spawn one-shotting everything as soon as it spawns. 
---
I mean this entire post is about how abusing bobbleheads allows someone to one-shot a player with slap damage. Someone tested it and found that bobblehead stacking has zero effect on slap damage. I'm sure there are other ways to abuse slap damage with fast-firing varied damage methods, but this is literally misinformation. 
---
/thread and all further threads about this.
---
So If some finds a TSE hunting rifle before the patch they will likely have one of the rarest items in the game even, since they are removing the TS completely from future legendary finds.
---
You were duped... Or not.
---
So you and your buddies clear down to a nuke launch site, using ammo, healing, durability and most importantly time. You launch the nuke on prime. You get to the queen and then let it eat up more of your ammo, healing, durability and time. It dies and then after waiting 10 minutes for the loot server hamster to finally get up to speed... you can literally get nothing. 
---
Rewards should be rewarding or at least feel like your effort was worth something.
---
Please don't nerf the two shot. Those weapons are not that hard to came by, not expensive to buy, they are really good and they don't break the game. The explosive effect is the reall issue. They do AOE DMG and combined with two shot, that is insane. My suggestion: When explosive and two shot come together nerf the explosive dmg on the weapon.
---
Yup def taking a break for now. They nerfed all of my weapons. Im livid. 
---
OK you have principles, that is good. You are passionate about your favorites, good.  Your strategy of distancing yourself from disappointment and adversity may indicate some immaturity in coping skills.  That will be 5 cents please.
---
Look at MMOs, people like large big group pvp. They can still prove they're better than other people by packing 8 people into a roam and attacking groups of 4 and whatnot.  The 4 man will take the challenge and probably keep trying until they get all 8. So I think you're wrong, but I like you because I dislike PvP in this game :) 
---
Tldr PvP thrill is enhanced by worthwhile prey. Only griefers that we don't want will be hurt by something like this imo.
---
I once scrapped this one hunting rifle I had. One bad son of a bitch. It could take out enemies left and right. Now I'm stuck scrapping hunting rifles to try and get its attachments to try and make one exactly like it.
---
The problem is it's in an area that is not easy for lower levels to get into.
---
Level 15, you can make it to Whitesprings with a little difficulty.
---
Level 15, try dodging scorch beasts, death claws, and higher level enemies on your way to watoga.
---
I made the run to Watoga at 15 on my new alt to get the vendor fast travel points, but it was a butt clenching "fml please don't aggro you dumb scorch beast" run at best.
---
Whitesprings is the best option.  Plus there's tons of places for people to build camps all over the golf course and surrounding area.
---
Funny you're posting this. I had the same experience and that led me to just putting stuff in chest, toolboxes, crates and other storage for newbies to find for themselves. I travel to Flatwoods every few days and I put stuff in the available storage at the farm and near the church. I hope it finds it way to needy hands.
---
I sorta feel like I am obligated to the newbies cause I had some high lvl dudes gift me stuff a few times when I was &lt;lvl 5 and it really helped.
---
does it matter? We can all calm down now.
---
I care.
---
No it does not. Stop spreading false info.
---
This will be a good first test for server rules/groups.  If they can pull off allowing us to choose the ruleset before going in, it will be a good first step to other ruleset.
---
3 crashs for me and one infinite loading... 
---
Check your stash box. I recently moved my camp and somehow my crops got converted into their base vegetables, copied three times over, and stored in my stash box. Once I pulled them out of my stash box, which was pushed to 700 and change from 600 because of this, the space freed up on my stored camp budget. That or try building some stuff then scrapping it, specifically crops and water purifiers. Might help to unstick whatever is using your storage space. 
---
If you really wanted to prove your point you would have posted a link.
---
I like that they are nerfing one of the good legendary stats and doing nothing about the 2 dozen pointless stats.
---
I don't get the sense that they are going to buff the solo game, I'm pretty sure they want all the M's in MMO emphasized. 
---
Yeah that's why I moved &amp; am rebuilding. And I still have bugs. Been getting disconnected from the server all day and each time stuff in my camp storage replicates. Maybe my current budget is bugged to be too large.
---
I agree with your point there. Long distance shotgun sniping is nuts, a sniper rifle on the other hand, that’s what it’s for....long distance face tapping. And yes, the people who mass kill everything with TSE before others can tag is annoying. Me personally I don’t PVP so I don’t care much about that but that’s just me. I’m just saying that after the nerf full melee will own PVP especially with the VATS warp. There’s always going to be someone unhappy with something lol. Can’t make everyone happy. The duping, well that’s on bethesda for pushing the game out with soooo many bugs and glitches to exploit that certainly needed fixing, but unfortunately because they are using the crap engine they are to run an MMO game they don’t have proper tools to track and remove the duped weapons, replace stuff legitimately lost to game glitches, like paper bags not appearing etc. I don’t dupe but I can’t say that I haven’t bought a duped weapon from someone who has. But I’m also not one of those people who stand at the door in whitesprings and blasts a TSE shotty into the mass of mobs killing them all in 1 shot. 
---
ah, good stuff, that.
---
You take that back, the auto grenade launcher is divine fun.
---
They should still give it bear arms back though :(
---
Ha, I knew it :)
---
Man you must have an upsetting life to use social media like this
---
Obviously.  It's the knowingly buying duped items part.
---
IF THE WAY IS HAZY
---
Sorry, phone has crappy service at the moment and says it didn't post.
---
so you gave TSE a fat -75% nerf making it useless (if you dealt 1500 damage before now you will deal 375 damage) now people afking and doing nothing in SBQ fights are gonna be even more of a problem now 
---
GG 
---
When my .308 is more powerful than a .50 cal, it's glaringly apparent they don't know fuck all about weapon damage.
---
I don't want to be forced into a bullshit Melee build. Ballistic damage in this game is woefully inadequate at endgame levels.
---
No one should be forced into PA/melee
---
Yeah, the gold cards in the perk packs? That's all they're good for - animating your perk cards. There's no other significance.
---
Sometimes. My teammates that I do play with are also in pasifist mode, don't claim workshops, and are not wanted. The three times this has happened were when I was solo though, no team formed or team disbanded (so my mutations and Lone Wanderer work properly).
---
Yeah. My play style isn't really about accumulating caps or stuff. I have away a full set of T60 armor the other day, with some good mods, because I like the excavator armor just fine and someone mentioned that he had been trying to put together a set for a while. (Not knowing that I had one.)
---
My assumption is based on my limited exposure to griefers. You say that you're not one, so I take you at your word. 
---
Players who randomly just decide to attack someone's camp, attack someone who is idle in a train station, or harass players from one server to the next are clearly missing something when it comes to their emotional development. None of those things have happened to me, but I have heard plenty of stories that have made an impression, along with my own less extreme experience with griefers. 
---
If I misjudged you, then I offer my sincere apologies. 
---
Meh. I couldn't prove they were dupes and I believe innocent until proven guilty.
---
Nocturnal death tambo
---
Wow, so my Two Shot energy guns/heavy guns will become even more useless now and have to use the (meta) melee only again unless I want to fight bullet sponges. RIP my build/character I guess ..
---
The fundamental issue seems to be balance, if you are less than level 50 the chance you can do anything about a 100+ level player griefing you are pretty low.   This will continue to get worse for new players the longer the game continues.  If players don't feel the game is fair, it will continue to receive negative reviews.
---
You get the animated ones from the gold card in perk packs.
---
I actually had this or similar.  I killed a random ghoul, and he fell in front of a terminal, that I didn't know I needed to get into to get the quest moving.
---
I would go up to the terminal and press the button, she would almost start and animation and 20 seconds later, back to moving around.  Tried for about 10 minutes, even throwing a grenade at the body.  Nothing worked.
---
Logged into a different server, and no ghoul sitting in front of terminal worked as intended.
---
Also had this at camp like everyone else reported here.  I had a bed next to a weapons station, and she would do the same thing, start the animation, and then nothing for 20-30 seconds, then back to walking around.  It wasn't in front of the station but next to it, wasn't glitched into the station but close.  Moved the bed a little bit to the left, and band everything working again.
---
I didn’t know that :p
---
You are wrong about how these things work.  2 shot doubles the listed damage, the game uses the listed damage to determine what damage you do, it's not some arbitrary number.  Same with explosive.  That's why listed damage on two shot explosive was 4x normal. It really did add that much.
---
Then why are you making a fuss about TS getting a nerf if it won't have much of an effect on the end game boss?  You know this could be that since the TSE combo is so dominating, and that clearly nerfing explosives is much more fiddly and take more time to get right, that a quick nerf to TS was done as a temporary measure and  that once explosives are rebalanced TS might one day be restored to some degree. Maybe. 
---
Bethesda screwed up the only "merchandise bless" item they have had throughout all the Fallout games they have made.  They were simple, effecient, and useful.  Now they are useless for anything other than glitching.
---
Imagine that.  Had glitchers not found the stack bug, the only thing people would even say about bobbleheads is that they weigh to much.
---
Good job, Beth.  Can't wait for the next Skyrim so I can search for standing stones only to find out they are a 1 hour buff...
---
Sorry. I wasn't trying to criticize you. Just confirming your statement.
---
Hell just go hunt challenges. Try and take over every workshop in the game in one session. Use melee for an hour, rifles for an hour, shotguns for an hour, pistols for an hour, pacifist for an hour, snipe for an hour, 2h/1h/unarmed. There are countless hours of different styles of gameplay. Making enemies so weak that you can one shot cant possibly be more fun than varying your challenges and trying new things for the same amount of time played. Yes it may be harder, but walking through the game mindlessly with 1hit KO is boring as hell. I even limited my melee damage to 500 max because even that was getting to easy.
---
I agree, balance needs to come as well
---
I've never seen one! I was legit thinking the other day, "how come they didn't put them in?!" lol
---
No thanks.
---
If they split up the game, you're going to have players that won't even TRY the new servers.
---
I already have 2 x 150+ level characters.  I am NOT going to spin up a new character with every "flavor" of server they come out with.  
---
Characters, plans, and perks must transfer to new servers.  I can deal with stash and weapons / armor not transferring.  FYI I will not be bringing my end-game gear to a server where it drops on death EVER.  There will be more incentive for people to use hacks on those servers and I'm not losing that hard to trade for gear there.
---
I use a bloody gatling add radicool and your character self heals while getting attacked by scorch
---
Yeah definitely haven’t put this much time into a game in a while just kind of bored I guess hopefully dlc isn’t too far away
---
Yeah. I love compensation and gifts. I  love it when a company gives you free stuff to apologize for stuff like crashes and disconnects. Or like in RDR Online they gave players 15 gold bars for beta testing, and then another 15 gold bars for beta testing if you played within a certain time frame. Some games will give you gifts if the servers are down for a a prolonged period. Some will give gifts if they change any system. So far there hasn't really been any of that generosity, or even to my knowledge an actual apology for the game crashes that are so prevalent. But I don't pay much attention to social media and stuff like that so maybe they have.
---
Is there any benefit of having an animated one?
---
Plainly, you are wrong. There are a lot of myths about how 2 shot and explosive work.  These myths are perpetrated likely by those who want to downplay their effectiveness.
---
Really so have you ever used a vats crit dmg build? Or if you like heavy guns so much a stealth harpoon gun build? Or a vats crit Gatling gun?. one taps almost everything with even "bad" legendary effects so long as you have that crit dmg bonus. Also I tend to use my swing speed switch blade I butter knife people I find it fun. Though I do have a level 100 heavy gunner a level 120 stealth sniper and a level 60 vats gunslinger not a single one of them using a twoshot weapon and still killing everything at endgame.
---
I think the the primary issue with TS is that it also multiplies all other bonuses, so anything that's overpowered is twice as overpowered with two shot.
---
Still, the legendary system is every bit as broken and frustrating after this nerf than before it, and saying you can't find it at all anymore when the new verion is still very desirable is also kind of annoying.
---
Who told you that? What's your source?
---
I suppose that's one way to combat the duped market? I'd rather this than the crazy suggestions I've seen of "Raise the gear level cap."
---
I guess nerfing the two most powerful Effects is fine (I feel like Two-Shot and Explosive bonus damage in Fallout 4 was on par with the new values they're making the effects with this patch). It will make the other Legendary effects a little more valuable now, and people won't immediately discard stuff that doesn't say "Two-Shot Explosive" in it's name.
---
Nerfing two-shot this way actually makes it an awful legendary effect. It doubled damage because it simply added an extra bullet but at the cost of worse accuracy. Lowering ts damage at all means you have a gun that is now less accurate and if only one shot hits (not that uncommon at range with the accuracy penalty) you have a 50/50 to do normal damage or 1/4 damage. Basically no weapon but shotguns could benefit from it anymore.
---
If tse's are a problem, how about actually buffing the other effects that are next to useless? All this is doing is switching the preferred roll from tse to bloodied explosive
---
It’s cool, I didn’t take your comment in a negative way. Thanks for being polite though!
---
Wait, wut?    
---
So, if I merge two cards, does the animation stay?  Or is there a specific way to do it?
---
Heart of the swamp is a great event, but when it spawns in the strangler queen it gets awful, that thing can take so much damage it’s unreal.
---
That’s... actually pretty viable lol
---
&gt; Boooo. it's now 1 and 1/4th shot. Why would they nerf this? The game is 94% PvE 
---
Even for PvE purposes having one legendary prefix that is so much better than the next isn't OK.
---
Order of mysteries event please :( 
---
I would be okay with the two shot perk being removed only if it were given away as a quest reward.
---
Yeah I've been using tse handmade for a while. Found a non tse lever not bad stats. Tried to use it for a bit an it has only 8 dmg less then my handmade but feels so damn useless.
---
They changes it, the statement now says they will remain in game just nerfed, both 2 shot and explosive. 
---
They gave gold for beta testing? I ain't got shit!
---
They've updated it to now say: 
---
&gt;~~and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world~~ 
---
so I'm guessing that was a mistake and they aren't going away.
---
That's fine, I understand. Critisism needs to be constructive. Misspellings makes it harder to understand.
---
It would probably cost 5000000000 atoms
---
And they will look at those too, can't fix everything in one patch. For now the worst offender was this gun. 
---
I have no idea how me calling a cunt a cunt has anything to do with me *allegedly* being a lazy gamer.
---
Like. *Generally,* the biggest assholes are really far from lazy. You have to put effort into being a real asshole.
---
I actually agree somewhat with the general sentiment that there’s nothing inherently wrong with there being some clear cut “best in slot” gear, at least in terms of people who want to seriously invest in and enjoy PVP.
---
But Two Shot and Explosive are already fairly OP alone, let alone getting them both in one roll. It’s one thing to have BIS gear, another entirely to have a couple things that wildly and disproportionately unbalance the whole damn game.
---
They definitely need some tweaking. I still don’t like the idea of just having them straight up removed much either though.
---
I think It just looks pretty lol kinda like having a hologram version of a baseball card
---
Sure if it you are good with melee being tanked to make it "nalanced". Cant nerf one without the other being  nerfed. Ny exploding shotgun only does maximum of 561 damage with perk cards, melee users are hitting at 3k with perks. Nerf that too and I would be on board with nerfs.
---
Suggestion for event rewards. Put the rewards in a box you can open rather than into your inventory. This way you don't become over encumbered because you've finished an event and suddenly a missile launcher appears. 
---
Go for a skate on the Canal and end the afternoon with a BeaverTail.
---
Ottawa tourism at its finest... :p
---
We know that you are complaining about them nerfing a weapon that makes the game so easy a caveman could do it, so it stands to reason that are a caveman.
---
omg all the dupers and dupe buyers are crying so hard it's kind of funny.  I myself have 6 weapons that are TSE or have two shot or explosive on them.  Seriously, get over it, we'll be okay.
---
Nerf the f$ck out of it, but DON'T remove it from the loot table.
---
In my opinion nerfing two shots is a huge mistake, it’s the only way rifles can become even remotely competitive to melee damage… My slugger build sits at nearly 500 damage before adrenaline and takes no ammo… My sniper rifle is what 150? And can’t do dick in nuke zones because stealthing in power armor is s joke. Yeah that’s fucking stupid. 
---
You just gave me an idea for mantlepieces/trophy plaques with the heads of your kills on them. That could get fun, too.
---
"Yup, Diseased Scorchbeast Queen. Me and 11 others shot at her for 24 minutes and then her health came back to 100%, but a last chance barrage got her."
---
"That empty one there is a Grafton Monster. You see, no head, so I can't really mount it on the plaque."
---
"Those three in the corner are the three m-f'n mole rats that always spawn at the Flatwoods motel."
---
"Over there? That's xX_PLAYAKILLAZ69_Xx's spot. Gonna bag him one of these days."
---
You can play the game quite well without TS or TSE though. TSE shotties are going to stay super op but I wouldn't be surprised if they won't get looked at as well, and as far as other stuff goes: not sure if TS at 25% is so superior to other weapon combinations anymore. Reduced accuracy also happens and it is noticeable on a lot of them. 
---
You are definitely not alone.
---
Please do because my current primary weapon is an explosive gatling laser with an explosive shotgun as a backup. Right now my world is being destroyed.
---
Good question, I’m not sure 🤔 
---
Risky click of the day
---
I wouldnt totally hate the pvp events staying. You can just avoid them if you dont want to PVP and it would allow PVE players to step in and get a taste of it so they know if they want to try PVP server too.
---
Nice! How do you get the factions on your name?
---
I doubt itll be full loot, is it?
---
How about this as a compromise, you can only switch to the PvE server once a day. I think that would work for both our issues
---
 Is that your guess or published information?
---
Wait so do you launch 5 nukes or server hop, I’m not sure, how ever I only have only taught her once and lost, I was too low a level, not em I’m not and I want to 
---
The best solution is to play the "weight management game" until they come out with bigger stash.  Don't carry that much junk on you.
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
Can we please have a rifle weight reduction perk?  Pleeeeeeease??
---
Agreed
---
Hey guys a little personal wishlist. Completely of my own opinion of course. (Written quickly from phone)
---
Anyone ever play Stalker Misery Mod or dabble in Dayz?
---
Having rare bullet types and being able to switch clips to them would be awesome rather than using it as a legendary mod.
---
Darker night time. More usage of lights and night vision (especially for pvp mode)
---
Check out Agony Mod for Fallout 4. (Having some amazing gameplay with it on survival)
---
Different weapon scope reticles.
---
Bullet drop/bullet physics
---
Add remove silencers and some mods on the fly.
---
Backpacks.
---
**Power armor voice modulator for people using voice chat and wearing power armor** 
---
Being able to go prone. 
---
No name above player character.
---
Walking around and having no map marker location indicating where you are. 
---
Set grenade bouquet traps on the fly.
---
I also really miss the quick slots of  Fallout 4 versus the wheel.
---
Thanks guys.
---
K luv u bye
---
Any updates on new features players have been asking for like vending machines and the ability to transfer items between your characters? I'd really like to be able to easily move some stuff to an alternate character to save space. 
---
The no longer drop is an ABSOLUTE KILLER.
---
Why the fuck would they do that?
---
You think I want all the other shit mods that drop? 
---
Whoops, wrong decimal place!
---
Because those youtubers are RMTers?
---
That sounds reasonable to me. 
---
&gt;these are just the principles of any mmo
---
Lmfao I'm sorry WHAT?
---
I have never in my life played an mmo with no sort of player economy.
---
You're smoking crack.
---
They had those in FO4. Was surprised they didn't in this game. 
---
Fix the bug that canned meat stew rots first. 
---
dont, they're nerfing the 2 shot.  Read patch notes!
---
Yeah I thought that was a bit heavy handed but they have just updated to say they aren't!
---
How is it ruining the game?  Is it ruining it for you because you don't want to be bothered with collecting and managing ammo which is part of the gameplay?  Or is it because you like running around facing zero challenge with the exception of SBQ ?  
---
Maybe you should go play an offline game, set difficulty to casual to get the gaming experience of just running around killing things easily that seems to be necessary for you.  Or get the second most powerful weapon and kill things with 2-3 shots.
---
But also with PVP being the way it is...just say I’m a range build and you’re a melee. I accidentally shoot you, being the first PvP hit it won’t do much if any damage. You then run up to me, hit me to accept the PvP then wreck me because at that point we are both in melee range. The only way I could see would be if the melee hit first then the range backs off and shoots the accepting shot then keeps shooting until the melee gets in range to hit or dies.
---
ha..yeah i have a TS Dragon i was trying to get rid of..on second-thought...
---
I’ve noticed that SBs when on the ground have a rad causing effect not unlike Glowing One ghouls. 
---
I appreciate the tips but I've actually done these and more.  Thanks though for trying.  I literally might have to start a new character because of this.
---
Not really, the food you get for completing it gives you 5% XP boost for one hr but it spoils fast you can't save it. use immediately or lose it.
---
Bro why do you hate fun. it was already in the game so any nerf is gonna suck. I have  a TS gattling gun. It won't be as effective now. anything under level 40 or so is a joke any way and can be one shot with regular weapons. how buff other effects then? Why nerf good ones 
---
Your fault for relying on tse
---
i kinda waited this nerf, though it's imho not done that well.
---
that said, if they would have done it right (the actual elephant in the room), it would nerf exp too much making it okay and we'll all be running with furious/bloodied, low HP, unyielding melee. 
---
the one issue remains: scorchedbeast queen
---
i have explosive shotgun (zealots). yes it oneshoots pretty much anything, but the queen. But specifically against the SBQ even at current state, it has it's big drawback: it's effectively useless while the queen is midair. 
---
current state:
---
* If queen is flying: no reason even to shoot. it'll be just a tickle, no more
---
* If queen is hovering over the players: Explosive shotgun (NB! better without skeet shooter) has to hit her in the very specific spot , it's slitghtly below belly (pu\*\*y basically), then you'll do okay damage (noticable \~1-2% slice)
---
* If queen sits down on the ground, only then can explosive shotgun dish out decent damage. But you have to shoot the ground (not the queen) and shoot also at the very specific place (under the belly)
---
The very reason EXP is good, is AoE hitting multiple body parts at the same time. you shoot a chest, projectile hits it. projectile damage applies. As a bonus, explosive damage applies. But this same EXP damage will also hit other parts are too, and they are separately calculated.   
---
When queen flies: limbs (places, where hit is calculated) are apart and you only it one part, if queen hovers, you can hit more parts and damage will be higher, but if she's on the gound, her all limbs and belly is tight together and you damage more parts with one shot.  
---
It's easy to test. unequip grenadier. much lower effective dps. much-much lower.
---
Now, when patch 5, it's over. Exp relies on AoE. it's still 4x lower AoE (grenadier or not. SBQ and explosive is useless. Any exp weapon, heavy or shotty or automatic. So for queen, we're down to low-hp melee. That's it.
---
smaller targets will still die just as fast. bigger targets may require little bit more targetting. And level2 grenadier becomes essentially compulsory. Good part is less self-deaths. For roam around farming, nothing going to change much for explosive. it's still going to be the king. And players are small targets, so damage against players will still be good.
---
People like talking about how Bethesda ruined the franchise with FO76. It tends to get more views.
---
Wired connection?     
---
Any other devices on the network?
---
They've updated their announcement, Two Shot legendaries will still drop.
---
Directly below mono power on the cliff. Best prebuilt house you can get. Aracade machines, food, sick decor. Anything you need.
---
Interesting, I gotta read it when I get home.
---
And explosive.
---
The other day i was cutting through the wooded areas and cliffs, I cam across 3 CAMPS and went in to each one to look around. Only one had someone in it still building so after i was done looking I gave the thumbs up and kept on moving!!
---
Because most youtubers are self entitled idiots
---
I sprint off a cliff usually. I have _got_ to stop hanging out in the Savage Divide...
---
So I need to be in/near the HQ to get these?
---
They updated it now they are nerfing both
---
OP isn't wrong.  Not even a little.  The whiners will move on to the next thing and do what they do:  whine.
---
8 projectiles?  I assume you mean TSE Dragon?  That doesn't do 8.  It does 5.  
---
The legendaries in general aren't even slightly power balanced.
---
This is why it was a terrible idea to copy/paste mechanics from a single player game into a multiplayer one.
---
I hate that I can't pick one up when I find it and put it down again in my camp. There is a perfect one in the White Springs shopping level you can grab- but it is either scrap or paper bag.
---
Because it’s unnecessary? Two Shot never needed a nerf? Ranged weapons are already massively underpowered. And just because it’s easier to do it this way doesn’t mean it’s the RIGHT way to balance TSE. It’s a half effort job. And nothing suggests this is a temporary fix for a large fix down the road so that’s not an excuse to use.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agzo5e/inside_the_vault_is_out/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
It increases to lvl 50 then caps.
---
Because they don't want to get banned for exploiting the game and cashing in on it with views. If they truly felt they had a responsibility with addressing such exploits, they would communicate these things with Bethesda long before publicly posting monetized videos detailing how to replicate said exploits. 
---
The VATS warp is a fair point. I had to sacrifice a large portion of my AP for my latest melee build so I mostly forgot how powerful it could be.
---
"The duping, well that’s on bethesda for pushing the game out with soooo many bugs and glitches to exploit that certainly needed fixing" - I partially agree. This should not have been able to get that bad, and that part is on BGS. But the people that participated, supported, and abused this are completely to blame. They could have chosen to completely ignore these exploits and continue to play the game. They didn't. That was the one reason I refused to player trade for weapons, mutations, and chems. I didn't want to support this behavior. 
---
As for your behavior in nuke zones with TSE, and your non-involvement in PVP. Thank you. That is literally the majority of the problem with TSE weapons and the people that actually abused them are the reason this was necessary. Some decent and legitimate players are being screwed by this and I honesty feel bad for that percentage of people.
---
Happy to help, if you can’t find anyone in the next 10mins - offline atm.
---
That would make sense, the scene was at night and I believe it was a silenced gauss rifle so that must be it. Might get it myself at some point in time but rn none of my weapons have silencers.
---
Pvp balancing once again ruining pve. They should scrap the pvp bnb side of the game. It isn't fun, and these kinds of changes will make me quit the game.
---
 Excellent. I'll take the nerf!
---
Not to me maybe nerf them being used together or nerf stacking bobbleheads. There has to be a better way.
---
They're mad for one of three reasons.
---
1:They make videos about duping and dont want their accounts ban.
---
2 They hate 76 and will attack it no matter what.
---
3 all of the above
---
Level 10-40 can be a grind.
---
I just brought up a new 2nd character so I could have a melee build.
---
HINT - Whitesprings nuke zones are your friend!  Follow behind the other higher level players and get ONE hit in on every ghoul (burn up that crap .38 and 10mm ammo).  Alternatively if there are packs of ghouls, toss a nade in and you get ONE hit on everything near the detonation.
---
You'll power level in no time flat.
---
It's even faster / easier if you get a Tesla Rifle.  Farm bots for fusion cells, go to whitesprings nukes, hit everything, power level like crazy :)
---
Awesome! Reply whenever you're ready -- I really appreciate this!
---
Had that happen but I'm a melee build killed him fast traveled dumped my junk I did lose caps but a event started they couldn't do anything anymore so blocked and jumped servers lol
---
I disagree. It’s exactly as it should be in my opinion because I remember the days before duping was known when these weapons were literally one in a million and if you wanted one you had to put in the hours or spend a fortune. I put in the hours and I spent a fortune on one gun, and found one gun. Both of which I still have. It only seems obscene because fucking EVERYONE has these weapons now. And the frequency at which they drop in game has not increased one bit. Now I’m not mad at dupers honestly but Bethesda is trying to catch the water leaking through the dam instead of plugging the fucking hole. I’d be less aggravated if they wiped everyone’s characters and we had to all start back at the beginning. I know a lot of people don’t want that and I don’t blame them, I’m just saying it’d be more fair then these half measures they keep taking. Idk I’m just aggravated. I’m going back to red dead 2 story mode. 
---
I know but looking at it from the perspective of money solely it adds up a lot. I do understand that you can earn it but it does cost roughly $14 for a power Armour paint
---
I saw in. Abbie’s quest line to have wood armor, not sure I want to go toe to toe with a Mirelurks queen or hermit crab or SB in 1
---
No, nerfing them seems like a good way.
---
10/10
---
Didn't even realise he exists
---
A friend of mine has the recipe, so he gives us stacks of 10 for when we play solo. It's awesome
---
Maybe shops will be a seperate thing. 
---
No, there is a side quest began by having the misc task of exploring Hornwright HQ. After you repair Mother lode she'll dig back under and only pop up during uncommon events in the Ash Heap at Hornwright testing sites
---
I had a cat just give me the super stim recipe when I was still a teen. I always wondered why, ya know? That's an awfully generous gift to someone that you don't even know. Or so I thought until now. I'm still thankful that he gave it to me but this does take it down a notch or two.
---
Slap damage is an easy fix if they wanted to. Make it a set amount unaffected by buffs, bobbles, perks, etc. As for camps, just make them follow the same rules. Whatever faction you are declared for is what faction your camp is set to.
---
If anyone has seen Sword Art Online, they have a system of coloured dots. 
---
If you have killed someone recently you have an orange dot for x amount of hours, 
---
If you’ve killed lots of people recently you have a red dot. 
---
If you’re friendly all the time/ for x amount of play hours, you’d have a green dot. 
---
That would be great as well
---
Lunchboxes weren’t only in the dev room. There is other solid evidence, including footage, as to what was planned with them. To Bethesda’s credit they have not put them in the game yet but I could easily see them introducing them later on after the fires are put out. It’s pretty clear that they are not to be trusted. 
---
Which platform?
---
Honestly, I'm still baffled they *didn't* do it that way in the first place - what's even  the point in moving a single point each level? That'd be 'okay' if you realized you made a *slight* mistake in your build and needed to correct it, but if your stats are a complete mess because you just did whatever seemed like a good idea as you went, rather than planning your entire build out before starting... or, heck, even if you're halfway through, and realize you made a mistake - I realized around level 30 something I'd probably only really want 3 in Strength, but I already had 5 there, and at that point I'd have to wait til 50 to fix that.
---
It'd just be a lot more convenient and practical if we could respec all of our SPECIAL stats at once. (...you know, like how most other games do it. Of course, most other games also have shared XP when you're in a group, too, which is another major gripe of mine...)
---
Oh, I'll completely agree about the combination of the two being broken AF.  But, I've found that a two-shot level vs an exploding lever, with the stacking of rifleman/explosive damage perks, that the explosive effect to be more damage bonus than two shot.
---
That being said, I always prefered the two shot to TSE.
---
As for shotguns, I think there is some math off in how they calculate damage on the TSE variants.  Although the TS effect only adds 1 additional bullet, the damage is doubled.  Seems like it only has to have 1 bullet hit to do full damage.  Guess they won't have to address it since they are phasing out the two-shots for future drops.
---
Why not just cap weapon damage based on the health bar in PVP to make so a player has to be hit 2 or 3 times to die.  It would address everything, not just 2 shot and explosive, but also the stacking of bobbleheads for pretty every weapon type.  Doing so would not screw up the experience of the 95% of players out there that don't care about PvP.
---
I meant more tracking any new guns after this to see who is duping (if they can even do that?)  
---
Neat build but I cant stand floating buildings.
---
I don't own a TSE. I own some reg old two shots that will now fucking suck. I was so happy when I found these. I dont even pvp. 
---
I don't want them to make a habit of just playing whack a mole with whatever gets popular like poe does... It just shows that they have zero concept of balance. 
---
That said, they really have no choice with the dupe wave but to nerf that shit. Add or buff something that didn't get duped to shit and make that the best in slot endgame stuff... When people literally have hundreds of thousands of tse they are tryna ebay, the devs have no choice but to nuke shit. 
---
I'm still trying to get a spiked walking cane mod which sometimes drops from those forest events, which is slightly better than the barbed mod the vendors sometimes carry.
---
I'm level 58 and my 3 star lv50 vampire's rapid weightless walking cane is literally the best weapon I've found. I soloed a silo and fired my first nuke with that thing.
---
Nope, all you can do is request.
---
That won't stop people. See the World Wrestling Foundation vs World Wildlife Fund case.  Wrestling group created in the 80's sues wildlife group created in the 30's for infringing their brand by using "WWF".
---
Now you know why WWF changed their name to WWE.
---
Well it would be a nice feature.  But on social aspect. They should make it easier to communicate, like in game chat instead of sending xbox messages.  Its so time consuming. In game chat would be easier if u wanna sell stuff.  And also with chat options like 'world' 'team' 'friends' 
---
I get that. But that's exactly the reason Passive mode is in the game. Just don't initiate pvp intentionally with a melee player at close range. The only zones where it's necessary to do pvp like PVP events and workshops don't require them to hit back.
---
So it wasn't in the article itself but clarified via post. I think the main reason TSE weapons are so popular is the base damage on the weapons is  considered too low by many players. This is especially true for any heavy or automatic weapon. Especially once you factor in how quickly they break.
---
i drop that crap right on the ground.... 
---
I wonder if they can sell stuff to our shops or be like the vending machines and just able to buy
---
No doubt you will find someone to help.  However, another option you can do is just get someone to party with you, put your stuff into a container, then rejoin the world.  That's only if you have trust issues as, like I said, we have a great community and someone will help.
---
Ping me as well if you need to help. I’ve got a main and an alt with similar issues.
---
I’m on pc
---
Not worried about the patch. I have the weapons I want so I’m good.
---
Same here, it crashes 3-4 times per session. I'm on PS4 and usually hangout at Whitesprings where there is a lot of activity. Bethesda can't seem to fix it.
---
Yeah, melee was the original balance problem from back before dupers overflowed the game with TSEs. 
---
Mine is a quad explosive +1perception pump shotgun. I've grown very attached to having 32 shells loaded in the gun... Plus it's really satisfying to reload with speed demon / reload perks
---
I go to supply drops friend request them then drop and server hop lol or whitesprings in the repair hall
---
Removing two shot from everyone to own the dupers. Awesome.
---
 This is why most Fallout fans were fighting against a MMO kicking and screaming. I get my game nerfed because some morons are willing to pay real life money for a gun that makes the game trivial.
---
Loading now
---
Been trying to get BoS plans from him for ages. What lvl are you?
---
My source is understanding how game assets work. There's a reason people aren't freaking out, because the simple existence of a human-skinned test asset is basically meaningless. You realize the 3d modèle is just a humanoid shape and then they add a texture skin and give it a "character behavior" right? So they could put the human skin on the current scorched assets if they wanted to and it would change nothing but their appearance.
---
 A dev room is a playground used to test things and as such the devs need all sorts of things in there. Sometimes they mess around and make them funny because it makes testing less boring. 
---
The game is already full of NPCs, just none with human skins. Having an asset in a dev room which is set up as a test vendor with a human skin doesn't really mean anything in the great scheme of things.
---
If it had dialog options, then maybe there would be something to talk about, but it doesn't and there's no reason to think these will be added.
---
Aside from that there are already some decent theories that human NPCs may be added when the other vaults are opened. Bethesda said there would be no human NPCs at launch, they never said they wouldn't add any later.
---
Wooby is interesting and cool, but it doesn't provide any real insight into anything and could very well be a meaningless inside joke.
---
Ikr, and I want them be be good so bad.  The auto grenade launcher got me so excited when I saw it, but it just doesn't do enough damage.
---
The should bring the Crippling prefix back to weapons. You can take an Alpha with ease with that. Otherwise, I'll switch back to my reg shotty and use the Enforcer perk.
---
I loved workshops when I started. Then I found out that I could build resource collectors in my CAMP, and pretty much gave up on them. For me it isn't really disconnecting that's the issue. Every time I take one, I want to start building it up. Make it awsome. But then I remember that when I log off an hour from now, all that work will have been pointless. I probably won't have enough resources to make up for the caps/resources I spent taking/defending/building it up. I want to use them, but I just can't justify it to myself.
---
I love the quick kneejerk edit there after everyone freaked out. I took a SS but deleted it, wish I hadn't now lol. "Oh there was a miscommunication." BS lol.
---
Sorry but its taking it too far. No need to nerf two shot. Not going to go back and forth with you tho. I just hope im not so angry about it tomorrow because I really want to play this weekend.
---
The Dense chest mod will do the most for you. I've personally found plans and individual mods for marine and combat armor from the two vendors in Watoga.
---
I gave a level 6 player handful of stimpacks, water and some grilled Radroach meat 
---
The player took forever, then someone invisible jumped out of the bushes, screamed „DUPERS EAT SH*T“, grabbed the bag and ran 
---
He later returned and apologized - people are still nice in this game 
---
I cant stay connected to a sever if I own a shop. If I take a workshop I can guarantee I'll be DC in 30 min tops. Don't take a shop I can usually play 2hrs or so without a dc.
---
Keep two shot the same, make two shot and explosive mutually exclusive, and eliminate the stacking effect of bobbleheads. 
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO... Fuck them changes. Y'all are no fun Bethesda
---
Me and a friend did an event in the ash heap (lode bearing?) where we went into a mine, my friend said we should go store our stuff first but i said it would be fine. 
---
Well we didn't have a clue what to do for the quest and just ran around until suddenly the cave collapsed insta killing us both. Plus the entrance was sealed so our loot bags were gone for good. 
---
Needless to say my friend wasn't happy with me. 
---
It’s because they are trying to enjoy the game while also voicing dissatisfaction with the sloppy work done on the game. 
---
Lol - yeah whatever helps you sleep at night =P  Like I said.. Bethesda's lack of control over the situation didn't exactly make it a difficult decision for a LOT of people.  I'm just saying.. maybe your numbers are off because.. karma.
---
Now what is going to be the point of grinding for these end game weapons if they are getting nerfed? They are meant to be powerful because of how rare they are. 
---
I want to create a secret room in my CAMP and have it stacked with 500 Gold bars. That and an Armory where I can place all my unused Legendary weapons on the walls or stands as displays.
---
Yeah I'm taking a hiatus from it cause it's nothing but nuking the same places over n over. Even nuking random places yields no difference. There just isn't enough end game content to continue playing without burning myself out. I got tired of farming mats and I've got most if not all the plans. With online games I never expect content to come out until maybe 2 months of the games launch due to the simple reality of let's let everyone get leveled up and geared with what's in the game first. Before we challenge the playerbase with things that give better rewards then basegame items and so forth. But I never expected to get done with this game in such a fast pace that I did it in. Dont get me wrong. This game is a Gem in the right eyes and this "DrySpell" isnt going to give a bad taste in my mouth and make me drop it entirely. I plan on playing this for the looooonghaul. I could care less about the bugs, I just want a more refined, tuned reason to log back in everyday and feel drawn back to the wasteland of Appalachia. 
---
I definitely see some good ideas here on how to they should implement separate PVP and PVE. I'm starting to like the idea even more.
---
I don't know what the conditions are, but often it doesn't add me to events when I enter an area unless I click the event on the map and pick "join event".
---
it already did, the queen emits 30 rads per second now. 
---
This means melee are forced into power armor which reduces their armor drastically due to lack of legendary armor.
---
if they dont wear power armor and just take lots of rad resist/rad shield that suppresses their mutations. This also reduces their damage drastically.
---
I merged one card with animation and one without animation, the animation stayed. 
---
I agree. They should have nerfed Demolitionist to only effect guns by 50% instead of a 100% would have fixed the problem.
---
They still don’t address the over power melee builds. They don’t address that base gun damage across the board needs 30% buff.
---
This was a knee jerk reaction and quick fix.
---
It’d be more effective to go 3x Melee 2x Expert melee and 1x Master Melee since damage perks give 10% for the initial level and 5% for the subsequent levels. I typically do one of each so I can have 1x Traveling Pharmacy and 2x Bear Arms for additional healing items and a backup weapon and still get a 30% buff on damage. Blocker, Martial Artist, and Incision should be absolutely maxed though. 
---
Wait... you can have non-consensual intercourse with the radstags? checking for... research purposes.
---
Dev room abusers should be banned as there aren't too many, it'll be stupid for Bethesda to ban dupers as they'll be banning a large portion of their playerbase.
---
Ruined what exactly? 
---
I like these. I'd like for them to do something with the Maw. The note on the picnic table tells of a hypnotic predator lying beneath the surface. Doubt it's suppose to be a radtoad or an angler.
---
An explosive shotgun will do you just fine. 
---
I've said the same thing, and honestly, I still think with the reduction, I will destroy most things in one hit with my TSE Pump Action + Shotgun/Explosive perks + Bloody Mess.   Maybe two. 
---
I dunno, pretty much all of my performance, crashing and other technical issues have been resolved with the latest update. Hell even performance like load times, lag/latency and jerkiness have gone away 90%+!
---
And this on a Day 1 PS4, not a PS4 Pro, Xbox One S or a quality upgraded PC. (Still would love a macOS release with the Metal graphics engine… but I know Bethesda’s game engine is basically the same as it was for Fallout 3/4).
---
I’d still like to see some game balance improvements, UI enhancements and whatnot, but all the truly dealbreaking stuff has been fixed for me from what I can tell. (I was crashing every hour or two when in game, got hit with the inventory limit crash bug, and whatnot…)
---
Nerfing an overpowered mod won't prevent you from playing the game.
---
i am a little interested
---
It would be neat to have something like a cap refund if you fast traveled to the event and participated in it in a meaningful way, sometimes I wanna do an event across the map and the costs add up over time
---
They could make serious bank by selling second or third storage boxes that are unique from each other. I would buy at least one, and I despise microtransaction.
---
How should there be any frustration, how powerful two-shots and explosive weapons are? That's for what most people play and hope the whole time. I killed so many legendarys and never get a two-shot or explosive. The only two-shot I've got, gave me a teammate. And man does it feeled good, to get even with all the bastards in Apalachia. After 2 Months of gaming, killing and dying I feel like I have a real chance against everyone. That I really can handle nearly every enemy by myself.
---
And now it feels, like you take all these efforts of battling ghouls, super-mutants and scorched-queens over and over again away from me. The reward of all of this. Even if I didn't achieve it by myself but by my teammate, because I was not that lucky with the drops. Or unlucky with disconnects or crashes just before the queen was dying. There are still so many issues with the game. But that the two-shots or explosives are too powerfull is none of them. At least I am pretty sure, it isn't for over 90% of the players who are still there.
---
Unfortunately there will always be those people that exploit bugs and glitches. Me personally I don’t see the point, it just ruins the game imo. What’s the point in playing if you have 1000s of buff items and all the best weapons/gear as soon as you start. Farming for that stuff is part of the fun of the game for me, tho yes it’s gets annoying. I’m an old Final Fantasy XI player and been on XIV since beta so I know grinding for stuff.

---
yesss add me bee! nidiacanmeow
---
So why is it okay that others get nerfef when they have specific condition to hit 1k? I can only hit 1k with a tse if my health is really low with the use of perk cards. Nerf one nerf the other.
---
IMO furious will prob end up better (either with 2 shot or explosive) stacking damage is op :D 
---
I guy can’t I give you more then one upvote :(
---
Lol, I'm so happy that you will not get to use it anymore. Muah!
---
thanks for the input. I’ve never used dodgy so I was wondering how much strain it puts on AP. I could see that minigun situation being god awful. I’m guessing in that situation AP regen works only does so much given a constant hail of fire chunking your AP away 
---
I want to know why 'emergency supply requesitions' have friggin' money in them, if some one's calling in an emergency supply crate, they don't need cash, they need actual supplies
---
Friend request sent
---
it also has a literal army of robots guarding the joint.
---
Err of all the problems with pvp, that's not a big one.
---
Workshops are one of the few pvp related activities in the game and if you play smart you can avoid junk loss entirely.
---
Choosing to do pvp activities and ignoring pvp mechanics then asking for changes because of it is misguided.
---
HEY! oh wait.. yeah. :D
---
The nerf is coming no matter what, just because you got a duped gun and like it doesn't mean that it should be that strong.
---
The bloodied melee build will also be addressed down the line
---
Loosing caps period to that shit is a stupid game design
---
3 pieces is 24% but yeah I get your point. I have a full set of Assassin's armor and I was getting one shot by TSE shotguns. I didn't have my full defense perk build at the time but it did suck and made it feel useless. So I welcome the Fireproof perk, even though I also use some explosive weapons.
---
Tell me about it. 
---
Once I run out of the 20k ultracite ammo a random gave me i will probably switch back for crafting purposes. Honestly cant tell much.
---
Pretty sure one of the big issues is that all these guns have the same ID for each thing. Two shot has its own ID, explosive has an ID, and the base gun has it's own ID. they can't tell if the gun is a legit drop or a dupe so they can't track who is duping or not. 
---
Joining you now

---
If you just put on pacifist mode or avoid combat, you'll never have the issue. If you want to do pvp, it's a risk associated with it
---
so no NPC's...ok..still wont buy the game
---
I'm in favour of nerfing TSE and replacing them with different legendary effects. Main reason is to make those duped items totally useless. It's better than wiping the servers.
---
You should get a free respec at 50th level and every 50 levels after that or something. With the current system useful for minor tweaking of your spec.
---
I am interested.
---
Nerf it in PVP.  Problem solved.
---
I love my explosive, just going around shooting Scortched and ghouls is a hobby.
---
That's my bad. I meant 4.  But cheers, it's nice to meet someone who has been through the same thing.
---
Seems like you're still in it. I don't know if that's just your mental age speaking for you or you're actually in high school. 
---
:D nidiacanmeow
---
That would be a great accessory to roast your iguana on a stick with.
---
I've definitely heard that too, I was just hoping there was some silver lining for this idiotic decision. v_v

I can’t find the server on my iPhone. When I click the link it tells me I have to dl discord, but I have it. I type in the server and it’s expired.
---
It only says 0 because there isn't room for the actual weight (5mm is probably like .000x with bandolier)
---
one of the few times i honestly thought we were goners, but i got lucky and managed to pick up both my partners for free off a single stimpack, then healed myself to finish the beast off. we used everything. It was also one of the few events that gave me something of worth, (like a power armor modification plan for torso, cant remember which. and a piece of legendary chest armor i wore up to level 70) 
---
I can see a massively grotesque Radtoad that's more mouth than anything else being stuck in the Maw. Before the war it could simply have been called the Maw because it looked like a giant mouth had opened up in the ground and filled with water. But after the bombs dropped and the mutations began, it could be that one (or maybe even multiple) toad(s) became extraordinarily mutated to and is either stuck in the maw (too mutated to move on land properly) or it has mad the Maw it's lair). I imagine it may even look similar to[ the mutated Qanamingo concept art.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/1/16/WanamingoCA.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120220152612)
---
Thanks :)  Been wanting this "scrap a legendary for mods" for a while.  I'm sick of wood legs and crappy 1 star under-leveled items too.  I want to grind, but FML a 1 in 1,000,000 chance to get what I want is pretty demoralizing....lol
---
Until that happens, go over to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  You can buy, sell, trade, get caps, etc there.  That's where I got 100% of my good items from.
---
Oh I’m on passive now but I’ve had my bad experiences before when I wasn’t and that was because I had just started and didn’t know there was a passive. 
---
I kept running into him early on when I didn't have many caps. Now I'm rich, he's nowhere to be found! 
---
Do you want to drop it to a bag?
---
I have pvpd one time,  when some dudes were blowing up my base . I killed them with a baseball bat and moved my base somewhere secluded . Have been killed one time in the last 60hrs or so , and guess what ? I respawned and went on my way.  You babies are crying about the random off chance that you might get killed.  
---
To respond to your comment as dumb as it is,  considering that logic works both ways...   it does take away from my experience.  I like the looming threat that not everyone is friendly and that I may possibly get attacked. It would fundamentally change the entire context of the game . I have zero interest in a fallout clone of ESO . 
---
"Yeah, let's fix our screwup with duped god-tier weapons by sapping all the **second-tier** weapons."
---
Genius move.
---
How about "Limit all explosive-buffed damage to a total % of the single-projectile base damage, AoE but unaffected by any perks or Bobbleheads." So the buff is just AoE plus a 25% damage bonus max.
---
Please adjust energy weapons. I always use an Energy weapons build and it’s pretty unviable in 76 so I haven’t been playing as much as I would another fallout game. I would definitely return when my favorites are able to be used again. Thanks!
---
I thought of a way PvP could be overhauled and remain a general feature, sorry in advance if this gets long or technical.
---
* New PvP ranking based on the general grades we all know about.
---
* Everyone starts with no PvP rating,simply taking part in mutual PvP will add to the rank where as killing/griefing will diminish it.
---
* An 'A' ranked player (most honest) will receive bonus rewards where as an 'F' ranked player (obvious griefer) will receive penalties.
---
* &amp;#x200B;
---
As long as they address melee at some point, I'm happy
---
It looks like the old article is still showing up for some people like me. Here's a comment by /u/jessBethesda the above:
---
Well you see, after the adpocalypse, people have resorted to many different ways of getting money, whether it be talking about new trends, clickbaiting, or joining in on the massive hate for a game, like No Man's Sky and FO76.
---
Over 1000 damage each isn't bad karma to me
---
Err its easy to reduce incoming melee damage.
---
Building for pvp is universally strong and what ppl did it launch doesn't mean much.
---
Melee was easy to be potent with.
---
Nope but a community manager commented something. She said they arent removing 2shot from the world just nerfing it and explosive into the ground. Basically making both on par with all the other shitty legendaries that they have lists of.
---
Best way to find him again is take sunshine meadows workshop wait for a defense do said defense wait on road he will show up. Sometimes instantly sometimes in 30min.
---
I never said it was a good plan :P
---
I just see it as inevitable now that melee will be leaps and bounds more dps than anything else.  
---
I don't mind. I keep everything unlocked, players are welcome to help themselves. This includes crops, water, fertilizer (Please don't hurt Betsy), and access to all crafting benches and a radiation arch.  
---
This hasn't stopped the occasional griefer from just obliterating my house, which sucks. Like last night someone apparently took the time to break literally everything breakable in my base. But what can you do.
---
Well that pretty much suggests it's a possibility by removing the poll right? Bethesda haven't exactly been honest and open about Fallout 76, should we be surprised if they DID pull this kind of thing?
---
You can only play them on PC
---
Should have thought ahead 
---
This change just went from "What are they thinking!?" to "Hrm, all sounds reasonable, I like this".
---
That's why I made that point in my post, bud.
---
Logic and reason are my sources, and most people are thinking the same thing, which is why nobody is really freaking out about it.
---
Please share your source that it actually means anything, oh, you can't because there is no official information about the dev room or wooby either way.
---
It might turn out to mean something but there is absolutely nothing to indicate that right now.
---
At least it got you excited though. Not sure why since it's not like there aren't already lots of NPCs.
---
That's a valid critique 
---
The Tricentennial paint job is mint.  
---
Not sure if you can buy it in the store, it came with the digital Tricentennial edition. I got it because Green Man accidentally listed normal and Tricentennial editions at the same price for about an hour.

William Turner vs Jack Sparrow Blacksmith Fight Gif
---
About the only viable heavy weapons I've found are TSE "blank" and the fatman. Sadly I think the later is too dangerous to be used as a primary weapon and serves better as a "first strike" support role to soften a group up so you can mow down the survivors with something else.
---
😂😂 my favorite one!!
---
Gotta fix things first, it's how it goes. You don't get a new paint job for a car that's on fire
---
They did say they'll tell us more next update.
---
You gotta wear some item that allows you to open a secret room in the house to get more quests. Not sure how the initial quest is activated sorry. 
---
Lol, all those suckers that paid real money
---
Relogging now.
---
Thanks for the info👍😁 I use market quite a bit that’s how I entertain myself now lol
---
Is he like...a shittier Aqua Man?
---
They should place them at centralized places like flatwoods, whitesprings, watoga and the train stations. Maybe just a few in each spot that you have to claim to sell your stuff for the duration you're on the server. 
---
when was this?
---
being able to spawn kill someone 4 times at their base is not controlled pvp. This game is broken. pure and simple
---
This is the literal last thing in the game I could care about them changing.  Let's focus on the real issues, which this is assuredly not. This is like the third post by the same group of ppl about the same non issue.  
---
I'm looking for this right now but can't find it, can you help?
---
You got a note of what was included?
---
"The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100% "
---
\-FALLOUT 76 – INSIDE THE VAULT: JANUARY 17, 2019
---
By claiming a workshop you are consenting to pvp
---
Or just normal FONV Cazadors.
---
Thanks for being the 12,000th person today to inform us of this completely new and unheard-of news
---
You do this as part of the Motherlode quest, correct? I did it like 20 levels ago so I don't remember all the details.
---
Thing is, these TSE weapons are pretty much the only viable ranged weapons late game. Otherwise enemies are just bullet sponges. And even with TSE weapons, killing the SBQ was still challenging in the sense of killing her in the time frame. I’m all for nerfing it for PvP, but PvE is about to become a chore outside melee
---
It's a real shame because it's going to absolutely nerf my two shot lever action main
---
It's nothing to worry about if you don't get duped ammo, bud.
---
I've always thought optional visible camp markers would be amazing 
---
Yeah. To easy then
---
The supply drops are only good for finding rare weapons, in my opinion. I’ve gotten cryolators and flamers from them, so if you need the mods for weapons, they’re worth it.
---
You can buy the plans from the enclave vendor. They're a bit expensive though.
---
 "The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100% "
---
It shows up at a few vendors for 1k caps, Phoenix, Enclave, Watoga (pretty sure). 
---
I actually just realized I don't care.
---
Enjoy all the free shit.
---
Its a good step for Bethesda to actually address exploits and TSE head on. This is the kind of communication I've found lacking previously. I hope they keep it up.
---
Pretty sure the enclave sell them.
---
More things appeared in my stored tab, I scrapped them and got more budget. They were not in that tab before as I have not crafted them and I play alone so no friends could have crafted anything. Could be a bug? Yes, definitely, but it's definitely happening as I've hit my budget limit many times and later I could craft more.
---
Ouch. I haven't really paid attention to that so it could still be that way? I always sell then buy so I've never tried it the other way around.
---
In order to get the PVP crowd off Bethesda's back, it's going to have to be full loot.  Every other survival game with PVP is full loot.  Which is fine, I just won't bring any legendary gear to that party (which is why I'm ok with inventory and stash not transferring).  I'll craft what I need, if it drops, who cares, craft more.
---
There really doesn't need to be a time limit I think.
---
I start out the day in PVE until my friends come on.  Then we go PVP.  After they leave I want to go back to PVE.
---
Bandolier is currently a waste of a perk card. Move on. 
---
So only make half as many... 
---
Wtf are you gonna use lets game then? Everything is just a damn bullet sponge ! Whatever I’m almost done playing this bs
---
Right? It's such a cool design. I miss the Wanamingo's. 
---
(Also to clarify, I didn't draw this particular beastie. It's just from the wiki, but thanks!)
---
With Fireproof rank 3, and dense mod on your armor you are immune to explosive damage. 
---
Understood. 
---
Wouldn't it make sense to cut the excess code used to calculate the weight of the item instead of having clashing code between the ammunition numbers being portrayed and the actual values, bud?
---
I figure it's a public service to help people realize they're only hurting themselves.
---
Mothmi?
---
Black ops 3 is a rehash of the same game they've been making for decades, they don't have fixes. Fallout 76 is the first full online translation of a single player game (eso wasn't skyrim online), and therefore doesn't have all of the experience CoD does
---
Nice, T-45 is my favorite.
---
I haven't done any of The Enclave missions yet so I can't speak to that, but getting your excavator was pretty easy minus getting all the materials together.
---
1 shot should be removed from the game.
---
The problem was that often the 400 hour legit player had the mediocre gear due to nothing but bad RNG luck, while a 20 hour player could just buy a TSE shotgun off eBay and one shot everything in sight.  I've seen level 15-20s running around with these things and having no problem with level 62 ghouls in Whitesprings, it's nuts.  Ultimately it remains Bethesda's fault for even having the guns in the game in the first place -- near as I can tell they took everything from a completely unbalanced 1 player game and just dumped it into a multiplayer version and then stuck on this slap damage/Pacifist feature and hoped for the best.  But this game needs to evolve its content and become more balanced, and bringing explosive shotguns back down to earth is part of that process.  I mean all the other "op" builds at least require a mix of hard to find gear, particular perk cards, and have various weaknesses be it low hp or limited melee range or something.  But these guns require zero skill or game knowledge and can be just spammed in the general direction of a target to kill it with no effort.  Personally I think if you like the game and want it to succeed you will understand why that doesn't add anything good or lead to the types of builds or diversity of playstyles that a health game would contain.
---
 "The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100% "  
---
"**They will still be available in the world but are just undergoing some balance changes.** "
---
Thanks for this.  I've not been digging my dog's breakfast style build and want to get it more focused to what I've been finding the most fun (pistols! yeah!).  Been kind of dreading starting from scratch, but that outline seems totally doable.  How many hours do you figure it took to get to 50?
---
Exactly, they had them in FO4, I was surprised we didn't get them in 76.
---
So what you're saying is that everybody else who hadn't paid for their TSE (cause drop rates of TSE are laughable) should be shit out of luck? You're basically confirming that this game is P2W (only difference is that you're paying some cheating scum, rather than the publisher of this game).
---
I play this game with the drops I FIND myself. I don't need a handout, I'm doing perfectly fine. Crybabies can keep whinging on about how it's unfair to nerf their favourite toy. Suck it up and play the game as it was intended.
---
Sorry i forgot last night. I just logged in and took a 15 second video of me shooting my combat rifle on full auto. Pm your XBox gt and I’ll share it with you.
---
Seems to work on my end, the only thing that I can't tell if it is actually working is the run speed from EP. It could be speed demon that messes it up?
---
Took the words right out of mouth, present company excluded lol
---
Hard to think ahead when you're learning a game for the first time m8
---
I don’t think you get it, even if I make half as many I increase my weight, if I even do it once I increase my weight 
---
Nope. Keep it all for being a good Samaritan.
---
 ***Can we convince Bethesda not to do this?*** 
---
LOL- you own a % of Zenimax?
---
Can we not use "we" like that right after you asked what peoples' opinions were or if they wanted this and then didn't give a shit?
---
'I like the looming threat that not everyone is friendly and that I may possibly get attacked."
---
I don't see how your scenario couldn't happen on the PvP servers. 
---
No, I don't like having my game disrupted by immature people that have nothing better to do than demean and harrass others.
---
No code is clashing bud, it's just the ui. Try using excel bud, it'll round but still keep all the decimals
---
They just updated it, they didn’t include anything about explosive before
---
To be fair, I like to run around in just the hooded rags so I'm essentially a glass canon....that occasionally blows itself up. 
---
My Opinion at level 86, and as an Owner Player of the entire FO series. Having ground endlessly to get good Weapons, I have done some trading, but all my current Primary Weapons are self looted. (Yes I have TSs, TSEs, &amp; Es)
---
1. I am disappointed at the Idea of my Hard Earned TS Weapons being Damage Nerfed, since they already have an Accuracy Nerf.
---
2. I support the Idea of moving Explosive to the Prefix Table so TS &amp; E cannot Occur together, (don't know how they could fix existing ones)
---
3. I like the Idea of dedicated PvP Servers, but would also like to have "PvE Only" servers where players couldn't do any damage to other players or their CAMP. (A true coop mode)
---
4. I would like to see all active events displayed in the DATA menu with a Timer, even better if they had a 10 minute pre-start notification. (if you're not in the event area within 3  minutes of start, you can't participate).
---
5. I would love the ability to re-log to last Server, it would make Death followed by disconnect so much more tolerable.
---
6. I would like for the Game to allow for Overlapping/Connected CAMP areas, so we can build communities, even if it reduces the allowed footprint for both CAMPs.
---
7. I enjoy most of the existing Events, but find them to be relevant at specific levels, (which I believe is intentional), some should have a Minimum/Maximum level requirement.
---
8. I would like to see Free Fast Travel to Events including Blast Zones. (if you meet the minimum level requirement for the event)
---
9. I would really like the ability to Re-Spawn at the point of my last death (Drop me right in front of the Deathclaw if I so choose) just don't spawn me into a Blast zone in my underwear when I first log on for the day, an option would be nice, like, "Your last location is in a Blast Zone, Would you rather Spawn at your CAMP"?
---
10. For Future Events &amp; Quests I suggest Bethesda open a forum for submission of Quest and Event Ideas where players can upload Detailed Ideas, each Month, or whatever frequency is feasible, Bethesda implements the Idea they consider best, and reward the Player who submitted it first with their choice of Caps or Atoms (Caps may not be feasible)
---
11. I would love to see a Perk Card that allows for Fast Travel while slightly encumbered (Maybe up to 100 lbs)
---
Thanks for Considering our opinions, which is what brought us FO76 in the first place.
---
Buffs and nerfs messing up character builds has existed since MMO's (saying that losely with 76). Every MMO I've ever played has buffed and nerf'd different aspects that can make or break different builds. Getting the gun legitimately or not doesn't change the fact they were OP as hell
---
What are they needing?
---
Remove PvP and they aren't a problem at all, anymore. /s
---
Sorry a little louder.
---
The SBQ will be a real pain after all the weapon nerfs take effect. With XP harder to grind I am banking levels to redo my build after the next patch.
---
Well... everyone... he did specify ENDGAME player hub. You all are assuming lower levels would have any reason for being there in the first place. It should be a default spawn point once you hit level 50 and there should be an option when logging in to log into a server with an active SBQ event.
---
&gt;Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you?
---
At this point. None. Sick of getting food receipes for EVERYTHING or a plan I've already got eight times (Ultracite Explosive Vents anyone?)
---
&gt;Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?
---
Swarm of suitors is a solid no. It's so broken even if you're lucky enough to complete it, you get no rewards.
---
I enjoy Census Violence and Uranium Extraction, as so many enemies can be thrown at you it can get crazy. Too bad the robots talk so. Slow.ly.... Feels like 5 minutes of waiting for the same dialogue before I can even start!
---
&gt;Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why?
---
I play solo, it's how I do. I would *like* to be able to get Queen loot without **requiring** teammates
---
&gt;What types of events would you like to see in the game?
---
Big community driven events. Not community driven events that force my anxiety laden self to team up with randoms. But something I can contribute to in an overarching grand scheme
---
&gt;How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event
---
Fast travel somewhere close(Vault 76 or my Central camp) so my caps don't get decimated for fast travel, then join and travel in using the hexagon.
---
Events need to spawn more regularly... Considering there is nothing else to do but nuke Whitesprings.
---
Events on the West side are ignored as they give crap rewards and are not near any fast travel reduction points
---
&gt;How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?
---
Will the reward be worth the time and effort required?...
---
Bobblehead stacking is an issue, either way if they kill you once just go somewhere else. You already know it's not a fight
---
Welll...you could just block all the other players on the server. A bit of an annoyance but wouldn't that work?
---
They did nerf explosive
---
&gt; There SHOULD be a major disparity between players who have played for 20 hours and players who have played for 400 hours. 
---
I think that's what balancing is for.  Some guy playing for 20 hours who bought a TSE on ebay shouldn't be ably to ohko someone who played 400 hours casually.
---
That's a flat out lie. That's not in that post.
---
Literally just double checked by going to the post and ctrl-f for explosive. It's not there. 
---
Yah most def agree about server wide rewards and noticable changes in the world from certain big events happening (and succeeding).  I've been saying that from the start as well: we need to have large and interesting and rewarding events that encourage people to come together to do things, and reward everyone for the results.  
---
I keep hoping that one of the service content events we'll get is something like a large map event that has us repairing and clearing and fixing the railroad system and then, when successful, everyone on the map will be able to go to stations and fast travel between stations for free.  
---
I think it will make other legendary effects more attractive in contrast though.
---
That’s great but it still doesn’t change how what I said is true. Explosive is the problem here. And I still have extreme doubts that the “fix” will even be that useful. Rapid fire weapons and shotguns will still have explosive per bullet/pellet and so will be much stronger than a gun without. Single fire explosive weapons will be much weaker though.
---
Exactly, for both melee and tse you have to have low health to hit those kinds of numbers. Melee hits that mark sooner tho because the trade off for more damage is you have to get close to something to damage it, making you very vulnerable 
---
What are they nerfing?
---
r/fmehard
---
Believe me when I say my explosive black powder pistol is not op that reload kills me almost as much as I do
---
I don’t want to set the world on fiiiiiiiyerrrr
---
I would like an activity feed of sorts that can be optional but would show “player X completed Y event” and maybe things like “Player X killed Player Z.” Whenever I see the alert that someone has gained a wanted level it always makes me want to know more about what others are doing in the game.
---
The mutie vendor with a the Brahmin?
---
For real, they need to take a page out of the destiny 2 book for event's like that.  Randomly spawning big ass invader creature or something.  A super sized Assaultron the robots are able to assemble that requires teamwork to take down.  Shit like that would be awesome
---
Dropping Demo Expert really messes thrown explosives and mines though. I think they just need to nerf the explosive legendary effect. More so than the TS part.
---
Says the person with their head in the sand.
---
They did  nerf the explosive. 
---
"The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100% "  
---
LOL. He's a part of my regular loop. A Responder so part of the great Responder network that occupies the left side of the map. Bought the BOS Arms one a few days ago from him. 
---
For me the easiest solution would be to simply change the explosive perk so it only affects explosive ammo types. That will instantly reduce the damage of all 2 shot explosive weapons by half, but still giving them aoe damage. It will also increase the effectiveness of the explosive type weapons like the fatman and grenades. That way you’ll achieve your “nerf” to these types of weapons but still leave them a viable option without the need to remove them from the game
---
I've been losing mods for ages now. Thought it was an annoying (and expensive) bug. Turns out I've been scrapping them lol
---
Bethesda isn’t really AAA anymore....
---
Thanks that's good news, yeah the speed demon serum could be cancelling the run speed out for you. 
---
I wouldnt mind if i could sell stuff at my camp, mines always on the road near top of the world
---
No it's people like you who won't mind their own business. 
---
Sorry, I'm on PC. I've had that stutter, crash problem a few times. It seems better since the last patch, at least on the PC.
---
There is no other car like it though and people have been waiting for it for a long time. Sure some people will get a new car, but the people who see it through are gonna enjoy it a lot more than the people who settled for something else or waited until the car had been in production for years (please don't make me keep going it hurts xD)
---
Gat laser isn't too bad, but the rest are like paper mache tbh, and I hate having to use bear arms for one fun dakka dakka pew pew gun
---
I think they will nerf this game to its death. 
---
You're getting butthurt over a completely optional game mode? Wow.
---
Wait, the original did that!?
---
Somehow I missed the memo on this fact.
---
You can either find the plans for the underarmor (there isn't a paqrticular spot that they spawn at), buy a set from one of the raider vendors, like the ones at the top of the world, or some kind sould out there can craft you one that has already found the plans.
---
Since the servers will be up forever and you've already paid, just play something else and keep an eye on the updates to see when there's something worth coming back to.
---
I got bored with Fallout 4 until they released DLCs, but I had to pay for those DLCs unlike 76 where they will be free.
---
I'm in so much agreement with you it's not even funny. Events that are especially rewarding social should have the option to invite other players. For example, let's say one player kicks off Powering up Poseidon - it could trigger an invite to players who are currently capable of fast travelling there (not over encumbered, not too close to enemies, not inside etc). They could then fast travel and join the event for free. People would be ALL OVER that. I'd do it all the time.   
---
It would, with a single feature, make the game 100x more social. 
---
Two shot sniper rifle loss is brutal.
---
 Too bad they wont address the fact that 50bmg is weaker than 308... 
---
And capping dmg at 25% is that against players or just in general?
---
It depends on the person, I guess. You gain access to the Enclave vendor as part of the man quest, so if you can spare the caps (about 1500) I think that'd be easier. 
---
On the other hand, if you like the Excavator armor and have a ton of spare crafting materials (about 75 springs, screws, black titanium, etc.) then Miner Miracles is a 15 minute quest.
---
You can also borrow a suit of Excavator armor if you have any friends with it. That'd be by far the easiest method.
---
Personally, I did Miner Miracles since I didn't have the caps for the vendor, then gave the armor to a friend of mine. 
---
Well, fair enough, but it's still nuclear power they make locally.
---
yet not being 1shotted at your camp 4 times
---
I was really hoping for Chef from southpark...
---
I wanted to hear you yell "it's a goddamn succubus!!" During the SBQ fight.
---
I'm not sure if there is some rational system to it.  Like something we can figure out, time, or otherwise make easier.
---
If you get sick of server hopping, head on over to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  People are buying, selling, trading caps for everything.  Right now I'm in the process of buying all the different Jet Pack Plans, Calibrated Shock Plans, and Serum Recipes for caps.  People are also trading lower level stuff too.  Plans, recipes, weapons, armor, ammo, you name it.  All there!
---
I think I found it, two cabins here, one has a red star. This should be it right? Has one at arcade machine.
---
Sometimes it wont show on the pop up window that there is anything in them. You have to actually hit "transfer" to open that window and you'll see your resources inside. 
---
If this is about the fusion core. We went out delayed shipping  notifications last week.  We’re waiting on the second wave to arrive at the warehouse and then they will ship out. I believe we are looking at February. 
---
Nothing works 
---
You’ll DEFINITELY get junk back, the amount of looting that goes on means it won’t be long u TIL you’re over encumbered with all the pointless scrap again 
---
The game really hasn’t been out that long. It came out when, November? I got it early December and just hit level 80. Probably plenty of people got it for Christmas and are still working through the game. If you’re bored, go play something else and come back when they add content. Don’t expect new content every week just because some people blitz through things in the first 24 hours they come out.
---
Love this. 
---
Events related to factions and that would add lore to them as reward. For example, finding a note on a BOS camp and finishing a task for them. 
---
Events that require player interaction. Example, find a low level player and escort through whitesprings. Or help a level 5 kill a scorchbeast. 
---
Or something like: Random Act of Kindness Event, meet a random and offer 3 different items.
---
Better swarm events, ghoul swarm with several legendaries and a huge boss fight. Only completable with 3 or more players.
---
Just pretend it was an assaultron that one-shot  you with melee from stealth.
---
except the tracked down my friend to their camp and spawned killed them 4 times
---
Both 2 shot and explosive are being nerfed from 100% damage to 25% damage.
---
Two shot 75% and explove 80% nerfs to damage will take effect at Patch 5 with a release date of sometime later this month.
---
The mechanics are super simple though 
---
Yea.. I usually just don't drop anything if I see them walk up to my test bag. Half the time they take the one .308 bullet and give me a heart emote like, okay?
---
Try opening it with transfer and the material should be there. It just dont display it when you mouse over it.
---
Bethesda makes a broken game - people exploit it - Bethesda bans them. They could've just fixed the duping and let it be that. I'm unaffected but they probably shouldn't get rid of big name people actually playing their game
---
Wired 1Gb connection - and a hell of a network setup that rivals most small businesses :)
---
 Yup, most drugs, the Marine Tactical Helmet, Purified Water etc etc. Need caps ;)
---
With previous nerfs to legendary drop rates, nerfs to XP in Whitesprings, and now the removal of Two Shot legendaries all together, what's the point in doing Nuke Zones at all? 
---
I guess you can farm SBQ for plans but half the time the server DCs or she disappears before you can loot her. 
---
All I keep hearing from the people defending this game is that it's all about the GRIND! But what the Hell are you grinding towards? 
---
Just because they talked about TS and E changes doesn’t mean other changes won’t happen. 
---
TSE threads have been a highly discussed subject over melee damage.
---
I think the PVP settings should determine what server you're placed on. That way you know any other player you see will have the same setting you do. That would work for pacifists and for pvp free for alls.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/1fQiCkl](https://imgur.com/a/1fQiCkl)  Maybe try harder since it is there
---
Yep at least you dont have to drop ammo at trainstations, every weapon should be like this 🙃
---
Where do you get the assultron head
---
Can’t tell if your joking or not. Is this function able to 1 shot the Scourchbeast Queen because that’s the only application worth 2000 energy Cells that I can think of.
---
And it's worth a whole 8 caps 
---
So much this. You get what drops and you figure out what works, you improvise and adapt. These weapons are not the be all end all. Once they are nerfed, people will find other good combos and builds.
---
I use ten different weapons and change perk loadouts for them based on what I am doing. If your entire game depends on one specific weapon, that's just sad.
---
there is NO reason to have a PVP mode! getting heavy junk from people isn't worth shit. no one has anything that anyone wants. there needs to be a complete rework of this entire system. not just "pvp is turned on", oh well.. why should we play that, what is to benefit. boring
---
Haha Nice, do you have any tips for a melee build? I'm currently working on mine :) 
---
On the one hand, I'm sad that my TSE Gauss Rifle's getting nerfed hard. On the other hand, maybe I'll blow my self up less often now. I've lost count of the number of times I've killed myself with that thing. 
---
Two shot is not overpowered its only overpowered with explosive. And yes its pissed me off enough to not want to play.
---
I've had issues with FO76 no showing people on my friends list when they are online, but usually one of us just restarts our PS4 and it is all fixed.  
---
Haha true 
---
It was a random drop from a ghoul in Whitesprings.
---
I would guess they're going to make Bobbleheads not stack which will fix the major issue with the explosive effect. Hence why they're not mentioning it.
---
I'd totally be ok with Giddyup Buttercup shooting nice weapons out of its ass
---
It's definitely going to need some tuning, and it's going to be expanded quite a bit in the future (there's tons of room for more mod diversity like flaming on the one quest reward) as well as the new mod slots for the fourth and fifth star.
---
I can't wait to see how it looks in about a year's time
---
I completely agree with everything you said. All events need more meaning and should be able to impact you or the environment/world greater and in more ways. Events could even have environmental impact temporarily to servers, similar to nukes, but not as large scale.
---
I also think they should lower the event count to fewer on the map at one time. I think this would also help bring more players together. 
---
You the one who made the claim you could be on hit in from someone using bobble heads when you are in passive mode. 
---
If you can provide proof I will gladly go search my YouTube history and find the video.  
---
But you made a claim first buddy. 
---
And i'm totally fine testing out a new FO world that everyone is new to and discovering. Atleast reward us with free shit if you're gonna make us suffer :) 
---
When it comes to events the rewards need to relate to the event. I know that Distant Thunder gives PA rewards which is good.
---
But when you do Enclave events you get trapper or robot armor, we should get scout armor instead.
---
That's the main reason why I don't bother doing them. 
---
Also Two Shots aren't the problem, explosives are the problem. I sold my Two Shot only Handmade because my Executioners was better at defeating enemies. But I do agree with getting rid of them cause they are pretty silly, bring back powerful ones. 
---
I'd also want to add, I dont believe it's very balanced that one of the workshop defend events spawns THREE scorchbeasts. Yet the same workshop another time is 2 waves of mole rats. 
---
One scorchbeast is pretty bad. Especially if you're taking workshops to build up supplies to make bullets. You defeat the entire purpose, but its three of them. 
---
Wow, someone's really invested in the game.
---
My saying it's not worth playing doesn't change whether or not you yourself enjoy it, you know. No need to be so defensive.
---
Good to know.  Their edit doesn't show what part was part of the section was updated.  Just that there was one.  
---
I am not saying it is right or wrong, it just does not affect me. I was taught to mind my own business. If someone is stupid enough to buy it (which is exactly what they do with the atom shop) and it does not hurt other people, then why does it matter? After all, it it just a game. For me, at 48 years old, it is a way to “leave work behind” and i could care less how other people decide to use the game.
---
Without TSE (with how the ranged weapons currently are balanced) TS or E, they can’t come close to the damage you do in melee. No matter what build you have, a regular combat rifle without Two Shot and/or Explosive might as well be shooting cotton balls. 
---
What do you mean/?
---
Totally agree they fucked us. All I have is a two shot, fucking useless now.
---
Which one exactly? I have about 20 of these things and never use them. 
---
If you're in PS4, feel free to give me your stuff before you quit. 
---
Oh no, it takes many bullets to kill things, THE HORROR!
---
Reduce the strength of explosive when combined with 2 shot, make it so new drops don't have a chance of getting TSE and add new effects that are competitive with tse
---
"2 years on them, also with a good post background."
---
That sounds like proof they are not likely paid shills.
---
I got regular Mentats recipe today. Can't remember how though. I think maybe an event reward
---
BYOBBQSBQ
---
So how would public workshops work in your magical care bear world?
---
As someone who doesn't farm for weapons I understand why a rifle build would. I had first made a rifle build and the damage at lvl 70 was stupid low. I made a new character who is a slugger melee and I've never looked back. 
---
Tse will still work fine until you find something you like more, it's not like you found the tse anyway.
---
&gt;by now most players have a two shot weapon
---
Not me. ;(
---
I was really hoping for one (explosive or not) for my sniper. 
---
They still should be plenty good for almost anything. We all got complacent with broken stuff that should've never been in the game in the first place. 
---
If they could somehow make Demo Expert do less damage specifically for the legendary effect and leave mines/grenades/true explosive weapons like auto grenade launcher untouched, then I think that would work. 
---
Idk if that can be done though. 
---
&gt;You seem to be under the impression that I created the idea of TSE weapons
---
Wrong, the only thing I'm assuming here is that you like them and probably own some. Maybe bought one like a sucker. Who knows possibly even dupe and sell them. Making stupid assumptions is fun, isn't it? 
---
Yeah, people like you have always existed. The only difference is when I seen pro-OP shit people argue in the past it wasn't pro-game-breaking-shit. It was more like "Get good bro. Just get/do \_\_\_\_\_\_." Games should have a set of rules. Someone does some OP shit, you should have a way to counter it with an item or just skill level. TSE has a specific fireproof counter, don't do it you die instantly. So forget all the work you've put into the game. You now have to scrap it all because \_\_\_\_\_ has \_\_\_\_\_, and this is the only thing that works. 
---
Guess the fact that TSE weapons are also the only ones that can take a fully repaired 200% set of power armor and completely destroy it in seconds. Doesn't matter at all to you does it? Must be a fucking duper. Whoops there I go again making those stupid assumptions... idiot.
---
You're welcome! 
---
Lol...IF Bethesda is trying to force us to play Melee. I will quit streaming the game and quit playing..
---
With Anthem,Metro Exodus and other games getting ready to drop. I might just retire Fallout76..
---
They don’t seem to realize you have social influencer using multiple new accounts on reddit and other place screaming nerf TSE. When all Bethesda has to do was nerf Bobbleheads and Demolitionist perk. Bad game design and flawed logic. I’m think I’m done with Bethesda and Fallout 76 when Anthem drops.
---
“A years time”
---
In other words fallout 76 was released a year too soon
---
Doesn't matter what program is used, superchief. You just want to be on the offensive and change the topic so you can attack, rather than focus on the actual point of munition weights, and get pissy when I debunk your duping claim by how easy it is to make 5mm.
---
Under 6, what mobs did you not want to hit? Only ranged scorched? 
---
Huh, thanks.  Logged out but I'll check next time.
---
Yeah, it’s probably still that way. I’m still frustrated that it’s not the same barter system as FO4. Why the hell are these bots eating my caps dammit
---
Even with the edit, nerfing 2 shot is stupid. Call it something else if you are going to bring it down to a 25% damage increase. It makes no sense to fire a 2nd shot that does only 25% damage and none of the two shot guns are OP unless they have explosives with them.
---
Weird.  Thanks!
---
All I can think is dedicate the line to the ps4, not network it in.   
---
I dont think this is your fault per se, but Bethesda isn't going to do much to fix it, maybe we can?
---
People saying this is gonna make the game funner are the ones without tse weapons crying about them
---
Red dead did well on that with the free gold, so far fallout hasn't done much besides the free FO1/2 but that's not really doing much for anyone
---
Geek squad! Get real, gamers. Stop wasting time and gear up to stop the jewish menace! Will you stand by and watch your race be erased? No? The go forth! HH Brothers. 
---
Yeah I am finding that out.   Their post isn't clear about what part of it was updated 
---
There is no removal.
---
Yeah if it's not the best weapon in the game then it's trash, amirite?
---
You get it in one of the bunkers as well. The one with the dad who's losing his memory
---
I personally use the anti armor gatling gun as my main weapon, and it can shred through enemies.  Especially when I get max adrenaline.  I also use two harpoon guns as support weapons.  One is quad with flechette and works great as a shot gun, and the other is two shot and I use it as a sniper to pick off a few enemies before I rush in.  The two shot harpoon gun does 600 base damage so sneak attacks can one shot just about anything.  I keep TSE .50/gatling on me at all times though, because scorch beast fights aren't fun anymore and I don't want to waste 500 rounds on one.  Plus they're the only weapons that will even remotely tickle the queen.
---
Considering I kept every single one I found in FO4, including one large one, I'd be in. It kills me that I have nowhere to store the ones I found, and they weigh 6lbs each.
---
I also hoard Jangles the Moon Monkey.
---
Troll Skulls in Skyrim. Got a house full of them.
---
I thought it was just the bolded part and the strikethrough part that was updated since it looks like a edit.
---
I had a card with 4 out of 5 stars on it. I wanted a level 2 of that same card. I was forced to first upgrade the original card to 5 before I could make the level 2 card. This needs to be fixed so we can pick which version to level up. 
---
I found Miner Miracles by accident. I don't know if there are any conditions for it to proc other than being in the area in which it starts. By that logic, if you survive the trip, you could knock out Miner Miracles at a fairly low level with some material farming.
---
Conversely, it takes a while to go through the storyline to get to The Enclave, unless there is a quicker way which I guess is what I was really asking.
---
Please don’t nerf my ‘nades. They are my “oh shit” button”.  Getting good at throwing them on a run across a wall so they plunk backwards and blast mobs chasing me
---
Assaulttrons drop them too. And I'm pretty sure it isn't a bug. 
---
My friend and I set aside an hour and tested this passive mode and wanted stuff. In pacifist I could not become wanted no matter how direct I shot or hit him in anyway. I couldn’t do any damage to his workshop or at his camp. Turned Pacifist off and with a 2SE handmade at close range did more damage to myself than him and became wanted. That was with no bobble heads. 
---
&gt; The Queen will be literally impossible after this patch.
---
Hey don't worry, as soon as the queen lands the melee bruisers will proceed to kill it in seconds.
---
Enjoy your 20 shot weapon!
---
I always enjoyed the ones that benefited folks, like the "glitched" Feed the People, or stuff like supply drops everyone can get things from.  More "positive" events would be great.  Like how about a version of one of those BoS ones fighting the scorched at a base, but if you win it puts all scorchbeasts into passive / white healthbar mode for 45 minutes or something?  Call it "All Clear" and let people explore the bogs in peace for a little while.
---
I'd also like a feature where if I get disconnected during a live event  it saves me a "slot" and I can rejoin directly from the menu.  Particularly if I started the event.
---
You're not wrong. Just wanted to share that they're reviewing both. Nothing wrong with being skeptical!
---
My in-game name is RobotJock on PC if you ever want some building assistance. If for some reason I'm not on the mic its because I'm playing away from the PC on a controller.
---
I didn't attack at all, and 98% of the people I've ran across with over 40,000 of any ammo time has been duping it, if you haven't then great. I didn't get pissy either, just found it funny how you use bud to belittle others.
---
Lmao that was beyond swift. 
---
Will do, haha. 😂👌
---
Ruined TSE guns. If they were legit drops they would be far and few between and those that got them legit could be having a field day with their op guns. I highly doubt they would nerf them if they were never duplicated to this extreme.
---
Explosive needed nerfing. 2 shot was fine and relatively obtainable. all the faction specific mods are technically better now at 30%. Now everything is just going to be hillariously bullet spongy.
---
I feel like they are treating the symptoms instead of the disease. Players getting one-shot in PvP? Must be those two shot explosive guns so it's best to make them just a little better than regular weapons. Now we don't have to address the PvP system and we broke up the duping groups, genius!
---
I was hanging out with some guy who gets 500+ damage out of a non legendary pipe rifle just on how he had his perks loaded out. This will not fix the 1 shot issue and will make the game a lot less fun for people who don't PvP but have a TSE weapon.
---
Reminds me of the stage at slab city 
---
Exactly. A whole bunch of stuff that’s fun for cutting loose in Fallout 4 has no place in a multiplayer environment. Not in PVE where it’s negatively impacting every other player who hasn’t rolled one, and certainly not in PVE. They need to balance the whole game, but currently TSE is the obvious starting point.
---
One thing I’d say they definitely need is to change slap damage if they’re gonna keep PVP that way. It should be a flat small amount, not a percentage. And maybe a cool down for how frequently you can take it from the same aggressor.
---
People shouldn’t be getting one-shotted, or even need to touch healing items, for what’s supposed to be the challenge to duel glove slap.
---
&gt;e are just gonna remove it entirely?  
---
&gt;Bungie just did this with a gun and exotic in
---
SMH, BETHESDA!!!
---
2 Shot is not the issue, its the +100% explosive damage that's the issue!
---
Normal 2 Shots (+100%) are functionally necessary to continue to play the game after 50th level if you aren't an Unyielding/ Bloodied Melee monster. They already have the additional damage balanced by their horrible accuracy, and since Gun Damage doesn't scale with SPECIAL stats, effects like 2 Shot are how we stay competitive as Armor and HP skyrocket in higher level monsters.
---
Nerfing normal 2 Shot to +25% will do nothing but make the game harder for ballistic players.
---
TL;Dr Leave 2 shot alone and just nerf the "Explosive" part!
---
That's my take as well. Wondering if one can weasel one's way into The Enclave earlier than it comes up in the storyline.
---
Same same about TS rifle feels from another stealthy sniper player.  
---
Check Bethesda's site, if you weren't already.
---
Notice. #nounicorns
---
You are a donut. It's a living game like Destiny or an mmo that changes over time 
---
Even now with my TS lever action and rifleman cards I can only 1 shot a level 60+ super mutant if I land a sneak head shot... and thats how it SHOULD be. 
---
This is such a dumb idea. I hope they change their minds on this change after seeing feedback. 
---
Yeah they are really bad at communication haha. My post shows the original text for that section. 
---
I respect that post, no mocking here. Iv spent 15k caps dumping explosive bobble heads and duplicated items
---
Ur the best even if ur a raider. LOL 😝 you’ve just found another way to take my money!!
---
Also we did the wrong ID and instead of explosive shot its MIRV explosions.
---
Re read the update. They changed ut your post can be deleted now to stop confusion.
---
I know how you feel, I met myself (Other Character I have 2 Xbox ) to do a bit of trading, and noticed my High Level Character was out of uniform so to speak, upon checking my inventory, &amp; Stash (on both characters) I realized nearly all my 2\*-3\* Legendary Armor was simply gone, I  only had 3 pieces left from 2 complete sets, 1 Combat and the other Polished Metal, so I'm back to grinding for Armor again at level 86.
---
I also lost a 3\* TSE The Dragon to a glitch the first time I tried to use it, and a lot of other stuff during a disconnect while trading.
---
Agree 100%, and yea for a FF XI an XIV player I agree that you know what you're talking about lol.
---
Eliminate mules?
---
Wtf is wrong with you
---
It's a fine line between useful damage and carry weight I'm usually over encumbered for Max damage I use 2hd Max slugger incisor tenderizer bloodymess and barbarian with either psychobuff or buffout  looking to get twisted muscles hopefully soon lol coupled with my all rise it's so much fun 😂 
---
Having the marsupial and speed demon mutations helps because you can more effectively dodge the attacks.

&gt;  making 3-stars always drop 3-star Legendaries
---
Or at least make loot reasonably decent and useful. yes, thank you for the  protest sign and cigar box, 3-star legendary ghoul. I am so glad I took the time and materials to engage you.
---
the same problem Borderlands 2 had with The Bee. Adds the damage to every projectile, making shotguns and multi-projectile weapons massively OP. 
---
The fix was exactly as you say- split the damage across projectiles. 
---
Almost every event I’ve wandered into has ended up going down that way, with all of us basically a team. It WOULD be nice if they auto-partied you for them. I’d suggest they have a message pop-up like a trade request, and you can hold the button to opt in, if you ignore it you’re left out.
---
Dude hey changed it stop posting this shit without reading the real post. 2shot is in game. They nerfed explosive and two shot.
---
Yea its pretty stupid, its angered me enough to finally put the game down for a while. 
---
That kind real ugly real fast tho
---
you'll need to provide them your platform and IGN (then add them) for them to get on your server.
---
Secondary Objective complete, continuing with primary objective. 
---
They corrected themselves. Will still drop but damage is being lowered.
---
What gets me about the whole pvp fiasco is that they put in an option for people to opt out of pvp, and when I have shot someone that was annoying the fuck out of me, I did 0 damage. That same person, a level 4 kept plugging away at me with a 10mm and was taking hp away from me. That is bullshit. If I opt out of pvp, then some douche bag piece of shit griefer or annoying low levels shouldn't be able to hit me for any kind of damage.
---
I have no idea wtf they have been smoking at batheseda (yes, I know it is misspelled), but they need to get to rehab or switch to crack light and get their shit fixed. 
---
Im level 59. superkill64.  I'll be on after 4:30 central time.
---
You're entirely not listening to the point and grasping onto that. I have ammosmith 2 and super duper 3, I am well aware. 
---
Finally got it to let me view the updated post. Apologies. Corrected my comments to reflect this. 
---
Nerfed TSE????
---
YES!!!!!
---
I needed a lvl1 science to make Tesla rifle even though I have science master lvl1?
---
I woulda thought that some tacit grandfather rule would’ve applied 
---
A Karma system in a Fallout game? I'm pretty sure that's never been done before, I mean Fallout 4 didn't have a karma system did it? That might be asking a little much from such a large and successful publisher as Bethesda. Especially when you consider that this is their first multiplayer game and that's pretty tough I don't want to push them too much.

---
I’ve encountered this, maybe 3-4 times, where Fallout 76 does a complete “crash to desktop” but on PS4. The PlayStation throws the error code CE-34878-0 which I’ve looked up and it appears to be potentially related to a corrupt drive?
---
I’m pretty confused and it only happens with Fallout 76. It also will happen when I’ve been playing for hours, or sometimes just a few minutes.
---
I’ve submitted them with videos to Sony as prompted though.
---
I have noticed I’m usually in the Stash screen or Pip Boy inventory screen.
---
server hop for avaiable ones, just like non-pvp players do now
---
I fully believe that duping will be dealt with one day. I will keep buying until there’s none left or I cannot afford them any longer. One of those are gonna come a lot sooner then the other haha
---
Thanks deva for your hard work! 
---
The other legendary effects were bad. Everything is bullet spongy even if you use a zealots gun vs scorched. They need to buff guns in general. Keep the TS and E nerfs, but buff guns.
---
I can guarantee that once it was a giant crew trying to push to get the name released.
---
Since it was released they probably have a bare boned skeleton crew working on it.
---
The majority of developers went to work on their space game and the next Elder Scrolls game, among others.
---
I've been told by a guy who likes to dig in the data 15 is soft cap with 20 being hard cap for crafting, so no need to go crazy with buffing
---
Yep. My first build was a shotgun build and I could only do about a 4th of the damage of a mutated melee guy with a sledge despite having to operate in similar engagement ranges. Plus I went broke on plastic every ten minutes because the shells were so expensive.
---
93 damage?? That's better than my old 3* shishkebab! And I loved that!
---
I've thought about starting one myself to be honest... Somewhere extortionate prices and conning trades aren't welcome and a place that promotes a genuine effort to help people get what they're looking for.
---
Do they stack? If tenderizer 3 increases damage by 7%, what happens if more than one person uses it on her?
---
Why was home boy running up to you and then just standing there? Lol Derp 
---
Hey, why not do something about melee? Or is it only bad when range can deal actual damage but Melee is fine hitting 3k or more damage?
---
No TSE nerf required, just make PVP optional.
---
Can I have some of what you're smoking?
---
People really thought it was going to be forced pvp? 
---
Let's keep up the racket people.
---
This has always been the case.  Even before update.  Bulking junk allowed you to sell it to vendors. 
---
So... 3 questions:
---
1) where did you get the electric switch plans?
---
2) How does your garage door work from the outside?
---
3) how'd you get pictures off you XB1?
---
While I do think two-shot was a "problem", I agree that it was because other 1-star traits were mostly garbage in comparison. I agree that this might be a case where 'buff, not nerf' is applicable. Two shot made ranged weapons feel significantly better to use (without going into explosive shot territory), and is partly what makes them competitive with melee weapons.
---
Realistically I think the ranged weapon meta will move to furious, bloodied, or instigating (for farming). The % increases to specific enemies are too niche given the game's weight constraints, and the above traits seem better regardless.
---
But really there's a problem with the balance of *most* things in the game, e.g. between weapon types, between weapons of a single type, different perks, amongst 1/2/3 star traits, etc. They also need to fix the size of legendary trait pools, as melee weapons are far more likely to roll well (even ignoring how much more frequently they drop). Hopefully the patch notes themselves make a lot of other changes.
---
I think the change is good, the legendaries are way to powerful, just imagine when they add 5 star items later. I got a TSE 50 cal machine gun, and i kill everything way to easy. I can use it single shot rifle and kill everything. Even after the nerf i can kill everything pretty easy (maybe not scorched queen). But i wont kill them in one shot anymore.
---
Yeah I use grenades a lot when enemies like to group. 
---
If they straight up nerf the Demo expert card I will be very disappointed. 
---
I assume they have already ruled that out though. My guess is they don't really have an answer for the exploding legendary effect. 
---
If you nerf it too hard then it is going to make it just another unwanted effect. there's already too many of those. 
---
I saw this dudes camp and i stole all the water out of his purifiers and ran 
---
Yeah, no, that's not the best way to accumulate mats. You should get out of Whitesprings more. But I'm sure your shack is there, and it has rocket launchers, and that's why it keeps getting destroyed, amiright?
---
True hardcore you die you are done no more time to re-roll. If that is the hardcore I am 100% in on it. 
---
That's weird because I used to be able to sell individual junk items
---
I'll conceit that I'm not the best person when it comes to number games and video games, but this is what they said:
---
&gt;With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage 
---
So my two-shot handmade (non-explosive) will have a significant drop in its current damage? Or am I missing something?
---
If my tse does 50 percent damage now, that means i have to shoot you a couple times now. I can click my trigger waaaaaay faster than you swing a hammer. Melee is still waaay behind for pvp. Why woukd you want it nerfed more? Wtf.
---
All other damage prefixes need to be buffed. TSE was so prevalent because other options were pretty much trash beside furious and RoF 
---
Hell yeah. Waiting for more explosives perks so I can get my mirv and nuke shit cranking 
---
Always been that way
---
Yea and prime base locations too. Ppl just endlessly server hoping until they are in a server by themselves.  These are just the 1 player die hards, upset they have to play with other people... some of which they don't get along with. 
---
Your original point was that it was portraying 0 when it was in reality .00001, which I already said was mentioned in the post. So if you need a lesson in reading, go to r/HelpWithPreschool.
---
Thats interesting... or just allow us to copy an existing character maybe?
---
I'm not sure about the time it took because I am kinda a altaholic. However, it does not take long - I am doing this with my two other alts too.  I was getting a level every 2-3 workshop (clear mobs, claim, defend one round with no turrets to get most exp, hop server).  Then its pretty much a level every 2 tunnel runs - I would also clear all the mobs at the base of the tunnel entrances and right up the hill there is a substation on the ash side.  The cool part of this is you will get all the PA upgraded from running the tunnel so you don't have to worry about grinding that out.  
---
I love my pistol vats build - I always play gunslinger in FO games.   Once I hit 50 with her, i stashed my PA and just use normal armor.  I also don't use TSE because they OP IMO.  And she is awesome!  I highly recommend a vats crit build with max concentrated fire and tons of AP regen.  If you learn mobs weaknesses its a lot of fun for instance, high level robots - take the legs out etc.   Plus lots of awesome head shots.  Mod your guns with extra dmg /crit dmg cause you will be crit crazy.  The build I'm running now is a lot of QoL so that I can explore for long stretches and she does great.  My most fun toon for sure!  Here is the build [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=96248ed&amp;d=sb2sa2sg2p02pb2ek1c72i12ic4a72a80ad2s72ak0al0a00a30l22lr2l12lk2lv0&amp;w=&amp;n=Gunslinger](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=96248ed&amp;d=sb2sa2sg2p02pb2ek1c72i12ic4a72a80ad2s72ak0al0a00a30l22lr2l12lk2lv0&amp;w=&amp;n=Gunslinger)
---
&gt; DON'T FUCKING BALANCE THIS GAME AROUND PVP
---
They're not, or melee would've been nerfed aswell. But as it is, 600 damage from guns is too OP I guess, but 5k from melee is perfectly fine, especially when they can wear PA and have the ability to just constantly inject stimpacks.
---
&gt; You are a donut.
---
Hah. Upvoting for funny comment!  
---
(I mean, I agree with you. I just think the sentence is funny.)
---
So it did 200%, now its 125%.
---
1.25/2 = 62.5% of the damage it did before, 37.5% reduction
---
they didn't fight back that is the issue
---
My bad, didn't see the updated text before I wrote this out. I think it still stands whether the nerfed versions are still in drop pools or not.
---
Tell me this was meant to be sarcastic because I read it as sarcasm and loved it.
---
Soooooooo back to unarmed melee to one shot everything still?
---
Exactly my point. There is no way of proving it.
---
not if you broke it down. You can still sell junk that's not broken down.
---
They should rebuild PvP
---
They aren't, or did you not notice they're not doing anything about the melee one-taps?
---
Some, not all items, can be sold individually. I know circuits is one of them. I dont have a comprehensive list but some only sells in bulk, and others won't bulk at all (why I dont know, everything should bulk)
---
They. Should. Have. Left.
---
It’s balance. 
---
Right now on rifles, 2shot/TSE is basically always the best. Now it’s a trade off, where it’s closer to equivalent. Zealots/ghoul slayer/mutant slayer/exterminator/hunter does a shade more damage, and doesn’t have an accuracy penalty, but only works on a specific subgroup. Mutants does less damage but has zero drawbacks (aside from requiring a mutation, but that’s basically nothing). Aiming has zero drawbacks other than needing to be aiming. Armor piercing can be situationally better or worse, depending on the gun/mods, your perks, enemy DR. 
---
IT BRINGS BALANCE. And that’s a GOOD thing. 
---
No worries. I think we can all agree that they need to work on communication.    They way they formatted it I would have thought the Bolded and strike though was the edit and the explosive wasn't
---
Agreed, but like I said I also think they sort of need to take a look at every weapon class, because they almost all have serious issues at the moment, either too weak or too strong
---
Of course I tried it, but it made playing that tank no longer special... just like this will do to my .50 cal. 
---
Yeah I love farming ammo for hours to waste it on one enemy that’s not even a boss
---
Then you weren't paying attention to what is stored vs budget. This has been debunked multiple times.
---
Maybe specific types to certain vendors?  When ever I bulk them I can sell any junk I want to any of them. 
---
What if I'm secretly a wood elf from Skyrim and want 3 star legendary wood armor?
---
o7
---
Dang someone took a dumb in your cheerios, hope you feel better soon bud
---
So much for grief control in this game. It doesn't work
---
Disagree.
---
I had the same issue on XBox, definitely done my share of Damage on the SBQ, and 3 regular SBs, got no Scorched Earth Reward, and they were all un-lootable.
---
Just remove it from the legendary loot pool
---
Anthem alpha was shit. It is like they have learned nothing from the past few years. 
---
This really doesn't fix any of the issues the community really has, unless duping get fixed and bobbleheads become unstackable it just means the dupers are going to load up an extra hundred explosive bobbleheads before killing players with tick damage
---
I didn't say the auto grenade launcher wasn't fun, nor did I say they were bad in general.. though they're not good if I'm being honest. I said my two shot grenade launcher is garbage. Sometimes it doesn't matter where I'm aiming, because the two shot reduces accuracy so much I still might kill myself randomly with a shot that lands at my feet.
---
Yeah the things I used to be able to sell individually I can't do that anymore.
---
That sounds more like a Shelbyville idea...
---
And here I am, just having found a 2 shot fatman and got really excited. 
---
I guess it is still great, but I haven't made a build for heavy guns and explosives yet so by the time I get around to making that character and using it it'll be nerfed. 
---
Did you pick up Elton johns glasses?
---
Vats teleporting with melee and one shot with 1k damage
---
Yup why waste ammo when you can one shot anything in the game aside from queen with melee
---
&gt; I know Bethesda isn't perfect, but they definitely listen to their fanbase.
---
So when are they nerfing the 5k damage melee builds? Oh wait, gotta nerf the ranged weapons damage instead of fixing the exploits around them. So really, the exploits will still be around, it's just going to take more effort for the exploiters to get obscene damage while legit players get to suffer.
---
Agreed.  every nuke should spawn a boss based around the primary mobs in the region.
---
This is my problem with this change. We need a rework/buff to the damage you deal with ranged weapons in general. Without the damage provided by Two Shot or Explosive, feels like I’m being forced to go melee. Hell, even a standard Fatman took 5-7 mini nukes for me to kill one Assaultron. That’s ridiculous 
---
Apparently you do because they *literally* do. 
---
I had been selling individual junk scraps also. If the vendor had say 3 caps left for the day I would sell three glass shards or something to snag the remaining caps.
---
This stopped working for me after the patch.
---
They should just delete this game and start from scratch.
---
Some answers:
---
I have no idea about the switch plans. I think harpers ferry, could have been a workshop event.
---
I have a switch on each side of the door. The one on each side has to be off for the door to close, so you can open it from either side by hitting the switch. The inside one has a connection to the outside through the wall, not sure how but physics i guess!
---
Its tedious for pictures. You capture in game. Go to your gallery, take a screenshot. Hit the xbox button, scroll to the right and find your recent captures. Click your picture, upload to onedrive. Then you can log on to one drive feom your phone or comp.
---
I'm still relatively new (less than a month of play) so I'm not super familiar with all the events but:
---
Rewarding in what way? A sense of pride and accomplishment or in actual drops? In drops I'd say Uranium Fever. In accomplishment maybe the Messenger quest? Although sometimes I'm like "omg dude JUST FIND THE HOUSE!" lol
---
The ones where I get disconnected in the middle of trying... especially the power plant one since it takes SO much time and running around.
---
Team: power plant. More people fixing stuff = more chance to actually complete it. Doing it alone is TEDIOUS.
---
I'm pretty cool sharing an event with anyone for the most part, though. But I'm ok doing many events solo since I tend to play as a lone wanderer.
---
Scavenger hunt? Idk
---
&gt;How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?
---
I will fast travel if I see other people there so I can help them do it. If it's one I like to do and feel I can do alone, I'll fast travel whether I see other yellow dots or not.
---
Fine by me. I'd say weekly is better than daily, but it's not like I *have* to participate every day if I don't feel like it.
---
They retracted that.
---
People are always outraged. Im outraged at the outrage lol.
---
Bethesda’s doing well, I hope they keep pushing to improve the game.
---
No I stick with my build, I like being Frank Horrigan United States Secret Service. 
---
Yea I’ll be on around 5pm est GT HerbalxAssassin
---
Who is this "everyone" that you're referring to? 
---
A better game 
---
I love the 10mm in the rpevious games. A good all around gun.  
---
here, no matter how you max it out, it is just good for clearing lowbie mobs.
---
Anyone ever look in the baby stroller at Whitespring Golf Club?  :)
---
? I'm doing fine with my non-legendary lever action and level 50 All Rise. 
---
It was very obvious they were going to nerf those mods. I was hoping they'd do it sooner. 
---
&gt; We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat.
---
Reading can be hard.
---
Same here, and the duplicate camp items are happening again in my camp now that I checked that. Just scrapped a ton of food items.....
---
So why not wait until duping is over? If you buy 50K bobbleheads right now someone could literally make another million in the time you took to trade.
---
Dang, sorry man. It works for xbox, so I thought it'd be the same.    
---
Thus the burden of proof. Otherwise anyone can make allegations without proof, this already happens anyway, but still.
---
That’s the only time I’ve noticed decay, is when fast traveling to get closer...when actually making the journey on foot I haven’t seen decay.
---
I agree. If they balanced both I wouldn't have a problem, I like challenging games.
---
Give me permadeath and I’m in. 
---
Boy, killing absurdly spongy high level mobs is sure going to be fun now with the only high damage build available getting nerfed away. Great gameplay improvement folks. 
---
&gt;We know that there has been some frustration over how powerful these mods are, particularly when combined and used in player vs. player combat.  
---
Reading comprehension **OP**
---
Workshops are basically PvP areas. What they can do is start capping the workshop, cancel it, and then find and murder you in the few moments before the server registers the workshop isn’t being contended. It’s actually pretty lame because, from what I understand, asshats can start to cap your workshop and then fast travel to you to kill you even if you’re not at the workshop. This completely negates slap damage and you take regular damage. 
---
REALLY???   man that is completely not obvious at all.  I never would have figured that out.  thanks
---
Kinda sounds like where I had my camp once.  Little to the south east of Johnson's acre, a little to the north west of Hancock base.  (Maybe not Hancock, but in that general area is a BoS forward base with 2 of those trailers in it.)
---
I remember a cliff and a pond that was perfect for the purifiers, and plenty of logs for wood scrap.
---
You can respec after lvl 50
---
As my only 3 *** Legendary find, I also got a Rolling Pin. Same 90% weight reduction and 40% swing speed inc as yours, but 3rd effect is Furious. Inc damage on successive hits on same target. 
---
Oh god, i forgot about that... HAHAHAHA. 
---
Man, i have 2 tse shotty's and a handmade that will still be better than the stock guns after the nerf- thank god i only paid pixels for them.
---
Make it so we can "lock" any gear we don't want to accidentally scrap/sell
---
They say that, yet they're going to ignore the fact melee builds will just always have a way to one-shot a player. Totally PvP minded balance right?
---
Which is why melee needs a nerf too. 
---
Seriously there is no reason to be able to one shot powerful players or creatures. It takes all skill out of the game.
---
They've updated the notes. Explosive being dealt with.
---
I understand what you said but I think they shouldn't  because a melee vs gun is hard for a melee user because the opponent can jump and shoot from a far range. TSE needs to be nerfed because there's no draw backs and it deals touch damage to the point what're the opponent can take a step before being blown to pieces
---
Its because of TSE and dupers/exploiters. I lost a great weapon now because two shot nerf. But Honestly this needed to happen.
---
For those legit players effected. This sucks but toxic players caused this.
---
What if I told you that you dont have to use the legendaries weapons on your pve. Instead of nerfing it and ruining the fun for everyone you can simply just not use the legendary weapon and have your fun. I know a shocking idea!
---
I know 
---
On that I agree. Low accuracy on it is deadly - for you.
---
XD i know i know, the distance is simplified, but I don't know, give to Watoga a real sensation of a city, maybe with a better panoramic view. It's like in the middle of nowhere. I know it's not a real city but still spected more "posapocaliptic cities". Just my opinion.
---
Or they could fix the game and ban anyone that cheated / used exploits.
---
Just because everyone was doing it doesn't make it right yeah, you understand that yes?
---
Big name people playing there game....if you mean youtubers by that you really need to get out more, LMAO Big name people....you cracked me up.....lmao big name people, like does he only use a giant font when typing his name?
---
Not sure if your on about the video the OP linked but damn son, 350 views.....must be the big time lol Fallout will be around long after the whiny lil' bitch you tubers declare the game dead. Makes me laugh when these self centred asshats declare / assume a game is going to die because they are not playing anymore!
---
Oh Did you use Berry mentats?
---
It's almost as if ignoring one of the most broken things in PvP since the beta isn't PvP minded balance...
---
Crap, I will have to check that tonight.
---
So from 163, a 37.5% reduction leaves it at 101.8 damage.
---
That makes it have 50 less damage than my non-TS lever action.
---
It also brings it to having lower damage than a two-shot critical .38 rifle (without nerf), a Tactical Powerful Automatic Combat Shotgun, 
---
I think the current TS damage is very skewed and that sniper rifles and melee should've had far greater damage to begin with, but this is a very significant drop.
---
I just think given Bethesda nerfed Fusion core output by more than 90% only to raise it again soon afterward their estimates when it comes to buffs/nerfs may be wildly off.
---
I'm more concerned with them nerfing items in the current game purely to counter PvP engagements. For additional consideration, the role of stacked bobbleheads can't be discounted from this.
---
My non-explosive TS guns feel fairly "medium" in the scheme of things (and I don't usually play PvP) and with nerfs its going to turn bullet sponges into bullet blackholes that require absorbing hundreds of rounds for most enemies.
---
You're disregarding that nerfing TSE does not solely effect PVP. It's nerfing it from just pointing at the ground and derping the monsters.
---
PVP as a whole needs to be reworked. Melee is fine pve as it is. Once they totally rework pvp then I'd talk about nerfing melee. I also do not have a single melee character.
---
How did you manage to fit the stairs into it? I’m having trouble with my base, and seeing how you did it may add some insight 
---
Bethesda has updated their article to explain that they will be introducing an opt in PvP, no rules apply, mode and the rest of us will still be in the slap damage mode. They will not be offering a PvE, no damage to CAMPS or players mode.
---
Sharks with frickin' laser beams.
---
.50 receiver &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Anti-Materiel. 
---
Didn't use bud! 
---
&gt;It's closer to the real world were guess what not everyone is nice and their are consequences for your actions.
---
The lore of the game is that you've been in a vault with these people for 25 years.  They are your friends, you've head beers with them, gone to their kids birthday parties.  Now that you're out, you'd kill them for a pile of aluminum, or even just for fun?  That's  closer to the "real world" for you?  
---
How about a friendly Mr. Handy delivering it to you?
---
Its probably incoming. I do believe that not having range is adequate enough in most cases (if it takes 2+ hits to kill a player).  But the current pvp seems to be marsupial hopping around, which may make melee users frustrated if they cant kill quick and have to deal with bunnies hopping.
---
Why do you think the people buying duped items, people buying lootcrates, and people posting on Reddit are all the same people?
---
Is it so hard to understand that most players aren't even on Reddit? Is it so hard to understand that there is no "we?"
---
No matter what you talk about on Reddit all day, no matter how you play or your friends are into, there will still be thousands of players from completely different communities and lifestyles than your own, and they're going to play however they want, without ever even knowing that people exist out there who hate microtransactions. This subreddit is a blip in the population that makes up Fallout players. 
---
I must be a wino then cause I've been chugging this garbage since the B.E.T.A. 
---
You are missing out on the most entertaining parts of the game... It is a game, they can't hurt you irl unless you let them.  I much prefer to enjoy the show, embrace the idiots, they are people too.
---
Game isn’t dead. People can like things that you don’t approve of. Accept it and move on. 
---
I havent' done this event, can you explain?
---
The only issue with that is that PvP is disabled until you reach level 5, making you unable to take or give any damage whatsoever from/to other people
---
Mutation serums i make got 2k price tag. Just lol’d when thinking about vendor thoose.
---
I really do get it. It's just frustrating, when jerks ruin great weapon types for the rest of us.
---
* Also melee needs perks, tse didn't
---
I have to disagree there.  At the least you need demolitions expert to make TSE work and weapon perks made the "2 shot" effect vastly better by doubling the impact pre nerf.
---
So if you actually spent all 9 weapon perks to get +60% weapon damage 2 shot multiplied that to +120% effectively.  Never mind the impact of things like tank killer, enforcer, etc etc etc that really maximize ranged weapon efficacy.
---
So yeah you can say you don't *need* perks for TSE to be effective but you could also say you don't need melee perks
---
I think scout armor needs some love.  Legendary pieces of it do drop, but it's a 1 in 1,000,000 chance or something silly like that...lol
---
That will be in the Sweeney Todd DLC
---
Its been 2 months. Its still early for all new content. 
---
Great point. I hadn't thought of that.
---
Sounds nearly the same as mine. I have it on ultra. I dont have a gsync monitor. Can I turn the water and stuff up to ultra too or would that put a strain on my systems card? I'm not sure because ik semi new to pc gaming and idk how far I can push stuff before it starts dieing
---
Just got a TS lever action over the weekend also. after the nerf it will be pretty shitty.
---
I have been a workshop player from day 1.  It is the main part of my playstyle, and is typically how I begin any play set.  In over 250 hours I have never encountered a PVP style workshop attack.  Many times I have been attacked at workshops, never FOR the workshop.  They are always PVP based players using the forced PVP of the workshop to make me fight them.  They NEVER WANT the workshop.  
---
You don't PVP for workshops, they are for MAKING STUFF not spending stuff.  Workshops are just bait for pvp players.  Dont over build, don't use turrets, dont spend any resources.
---
That said, non-pvp servers will never happen.  They need us for bait. PVP players are not looking for a fair fight.
---
I believe melee will get nerfed at some point. They are just focusing on TSE due it being a bigger problem, because dupers tend to focus on TSE weapons.
---
If I was stuck in a vault with the majority of the ppl who post on reddit for 25 years,  I'd likely want to kill them too.
---
Isn’t the true culprit here the Explosives perk that when maxed gives 100% damage?
---
Tank killer doesn’t work?  First I’ve heard of this.  Evidence?
---
Explosive shotties are OP and that won't change. It will have very little to do with TS after the nerf, though they'll still be probably the strongest weapon. As for the TSE not being the superior choice, really it will depend on the weapon, but for raw damage output at semi close range it will still be unbeatable damage output. Perhaps bloodied might overtake it if you're playing super dangerously especially at long range. They're almost going to have to reduce the accuracy thing on TS otherwise it'll be garbage on most guns that aren't shotties and heavy weapons. They'll still be king for shotties and heavy weapons though, and those will still give the best **dps** output.

---
If your on xbox and wanna see my Nuka Palace so far let me know. 
---
It took me about 10 tries before I got it on mine
---
youre really sperging out simply because someone used the word best to describe some of the highest damaging weapons in game lmfao
---
The hangover is real. Lol
---
Have anything rare to trade for it?  I have one, but I'm too full on caps to trade it for caps.
---
Serum Recipes, Jet Pack Plans, Calibrated Shock Plans?
---
And my head is in the sand how exactly?
---
Will there be a post on reddit to share the article with the added notes? It seems like not a lot of people are seeing the updated version. 
---
And previously you stated that the dev team is looking through the problem with energy weapons which is great! I just hope this extends to all energy weapons like the Alien Blaster, and not just Plasma &amp; Laser.
---
That’s a big old nopers.
---
Bethesda doesnt have share holder that's why I had faith in the beginning. They are falling into the cry from gamers that don't understand what makes a good game, much like how d3 turned out. 
---
Yeah, my fear is that Bethesda isn't used to the MMO realm and will get too heavy handed. Like...they need to steal some people involved in the balancing of other MMO's from their employers. Like Blizzard. They weren't perfect, but fair and if they fucked it up they were quick to hot fix it.
---
Only problem with vendors are they easy to cap, which I do everytime I play. So drop stuff on floor, outside vault 76 or in containers at random locations.
---
Pretty sure those were referring to a bug where you could see somebody's inventory without them accepting a trade invite. I have yet to see anybody who traded anything within that circumstance
---
A bug zapper!
---
The antibiotics recipe was fixed with the new patch. It requires Pharmacist 3, but if you have Chemist and Super Duper, you can scrape up 20 antibiotics in ~30 minutes, once you know where to find Firecaps. In addition, Rejuvenated 2 will bump the disease res of well fed/hydrated from 50% to 70%. Radaway and Radaway Lite remove 50% resistance for 1.5 hours. Since I pretty much always have the Radaway debuff, my disease resistance is always 70%.
---
Agreed! I LOVE the perk card system but it could certeainly use some quality of life tuning. 
---
Melee build: Slap on PA, slurp them stims, run at the one shooting you, laugh as they fail to do enough damage to you before you get in VATS range and just one-tap them.
---
Melee can reach several thousand damage easily and can get 100% armor pen. Super balanced right?
---
You must be a blast at parties 
---
yeah, looks like Berry Mentats
---
Nothing should be nerfed in my opinion. 
---
As a third grade teacher, I appreciate this. 
---
Hey, don't sweat it I'm a Professional with a Happy Go Lucky attitude. 
---
I do no armor with hazmat suit. 
---
Can you get a silenced gauss rifle? I didn’t even know that existed lol. 
---
The silencers are huge huge game changers if you go for stealth like I do. Crazy shit doing 2.5x damage to a creature right now with a normal hunting rifle. It’s awesome. 
---
Two bad they’re nerfing the two shot :( never had a chance of getting one :/ 
---
They need to totally reblance PVP from all aspects.  They need to try a bunch of different builds in PVP testing, then adjust each accordingly (bloody build, armor pen build, melee builds, everything).
---
Base durability and defense needs a serious buff.  Bases are ridiculously weak at the moment.  If you're not at your base, anyone can destroy 100% of it for no reason and nothing stops them.
---
A lot of times to block me or inspect me. Thank god the last patch fixed that. Havnt had a chance to try it yet. Been in vegas till tomorrow.
---
Seconded. All the people crying are acting like they have 0% personal responsibility for this happening. It sucks for legit players that collected these gun types have to deal with the blowback tho.
---
Can't get a hangover *if you never stop*.
---
Rose is a well written character.
---
Congratulations to Gearbox are in order.
---
Exactly what I said, it adds one and adds 100% damage shared across all. Shotguns I used to demonstrate because they already have more pellets.
---
I think your hostility comes from fear of abandonment by a male figure given the phallic symbolism.  Tell me about your relationship with your father in our next session, and that will be 10 cents please.
---
You're right about bear arms though, there's absolutely 0 reason it shouldn't affect this gun. It blows my mind that it doesn't. Probably it's no longer classified as a heavy weapon at all to prevent the damage increase from the other heavy weapon perks. The way the system was designed it's an all or nothing situation I suppose. :c
---
Yeah, because I can figure out how to play games
---
Gosh I hope not. Otherwise my camp built on the rail is gonna be a pile of rubble. 
---
Roleplaying purposes? I'm running a limited vats use sneaky sniper. 
---
My reasoning is that if we were the best and the brightest, or children thereof, that our first instinct when encounteting the extreme hostility of the wasteland would not be to hit stuff with pointy sticks.
---
Whereas a rifle is commonly available, intuitive and reasonable powerful. 
---
Though from a gameplay perspective, rifles are not as powerful as they should be, and a rocket powered sledge hammer would realistically tear itself apart as it hit the shell of a mirelurk queen.
---
So why not ask for a nerf to melee? The answer is because it's just a convenient scapegoat for people to argue in defense of their God Tier duplicated TSE weapons.
---
The issue is caused by garbage collection, the server is attempting to clean stuff up, which includes bodies, if you all looted all of the corpses and meat piles BEFORE you drop stuff you give the server less to clean up and lessen the chance of it cleaning up the trash you are technically dropping.
---
TLDR; this is caused by not looting meat piles tile they go away. 
---
Honestly, Fatmans and Mini-nukes are absolute carry weight killers. I carry a Daisycutter just cause it has -90% carry weight and 2-3 nukes. That's really only when I feel like screwing around or know I'm gonna see a lot of grouped mobs. I'm curious to see what happens with some of the nuke grenade plans I've found. Between that and mirv grenades and some other stuff I might never need it again.
---
Not super rare, just easier to obtain on a new character if you got rid of it 
---
That's lovely! 
---
This post is amazing, thank you! 
---
But don’t forget it’s the first time on the store so who knows if that’s the 50% discount
---
Surely, Beth knows people want this.  So have the not addressed it because they are worried about more serious issues with the game?  Is it something they are planning on bringing in the future and don't want to let out of the bag yet?  Is it actually a technological limitation of the code?  Or are they hoping to monetize it?   I don't know, but they sure put a lot of different teddy bears in the game world for no real reason that I can figure out.  And I know they all went through beanie babies with the rest of us, they know what people do with stuffed animals.  Display them for three years and then put them in their attic.  Also, when will we get long term attic storage? And will it count against our CAMP budget?
---
Seriously, if they want to nerf TSE, fine, but the reason people use them is because shit is SO FUCKING SPONGY at high levels and some of the guns do god awful damage without TSE. You wanna nerf this be my guest, but you gotta scale some other stuff back too. 
---
Im affected and I didnt even dupe. Got the email yesterday. I saw that as was like welp my time of playing is up. I have sent them my appeal but ive heard its unlikely. So guess Ill just make a new account..buy another copy for $10 and play 
---
I think it's a bug that it uses all the ammo otherwise it is a pretty mean joke for people who use that ammo.
---
I have a three star vampire assaultrons head and a two shot assaultron head in my stash just in case a fix comes out.
---
I need the western wear for my fertilizer farm. Finest brahmin shit in the entire wasteland. 
---
I got assaulted when I brought this point up pre-release. I wondered, publically, how a narrative game would provide the same narrative feel without human NPCs. Folks flamed me by reiterating what Bethsoft stated in their pressers.
---
Now that I have a ton of time in the game, it's obvious that avoiding human NPCs simply forced them to create a completely different way to try to achieve the same results. It felt, and still feels, like an arbitrarily introduced limitation...and I would agree that there is way too much to read or listen to when you are on a team. I am the same as you, and I want to read and hear everything, yet the game does a great deal to make that difficult. (Tape sorting, latest, date/time picked up, would all be easy ways to simplify). My kids read slower, so grouping with them takes even more time when they feel like reading. When they don't read, they then have no idea why we're working on a particular quest, and it just feels like a cumbersome FPS to them.
---
If the goal was to increase the overall value and perception of human interaction, then our capacity to interact should have been an increased component in the game. Allow me to be a vendor, a farmer, a sales person, a broker, a mercenary, or more. Allow US to fill the NPC role, instead of trying to pawn it off to robots. Using robots, and mutants that talk, and machine AI, are all ways to do what human NPCs would normally do, and the humans in the game have no ability to even try to fill that role.
---
I believe the best pivot to take is to have the other vault(s) open, releasing npc humans, with ulterior motives, and it becomes a Vault 76 versus Vault (whatever) scenario. They set up shops and take over areas, and we can either join them or push against them...for a whole different storyline.
---
Stop reminding me of TV Tropes!
---
BOS Officer Uniform plz
---
Beat me to a thread.
---
- Events that spawn legendary enemies or give you legendaries as part of the reward. Events that drop plans as a reward are good too, especially ones with a more narrow pool (like the Powering Up events for advanced generators), although obviously these have diminishing returns the more plans you learn.
---
- The escort quests like The Messenger or On the Beat aren't a whole lot of fun. And a problem with a ton of the "defeat waves of enemies" events, especially for public workshops, is having to play hide and seek because the enemies spawned in a bizarre spot. Regarding public workshop defense, there's not a lot of reason to build anything other than walls of turrets to handle enemies and possibly surrounding your generators/extractors with barriers. 
---
- My favorite events are the ones that encourage teamwork, like Feed the People or the Powering Up quests. Even solo, they're hectic but a lot of fun. What I like is that they're more complicated than just fighting off waves of enemies. Events that engage more parts of my brain are better. 
---
- Not just events that encourage teamwork, but how about events that encourage a variety of builds working together? Like having to protect a player from enemy hordes while they try to hack a series of terminals, or special enemies that make the event harder if they're not killed from stealth. And PvP events that aren't just all-out fights would be cool - like two teams race to meet a goal that doesn't necessarily involve killing the other team. ie, PvP events where low-level players still have a chance against high-level players.
---
I mostly fast travel to events on the map. I don't walk to areas to start an event, but if an event starts when I'm in an area I'll probably join in.
---
**How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?**
---
I'm not sure what Bethesda means by this. Do they mean like global events, and if the playerbase as a group meets the goal in the allotted time then every player gets a bonus? Because that would be dope.
---
Or much more fair simpler way - Demolition Expert applies damaged bonus divided by amount of projectiles fired.
---
Anything to save the Handmade, it looks do lowres and unsalvagable wtm
---
Also that BOS Jumpsuit is THE BUSINESS
---
That's too funny
---
2-shot is not the problem TSE is the problem.
---
Guns in general need a base buff and most of the legendary mods need to be adjusted somewhat to compensate for the raised floor.
---
exp damage works  just fine after patch. Still one shotting everything
---
How about the giant elephant in the room, which is that we still have no new content on the horizon. Nerfing things like TSE, which are the only reason a lot of people are still playing, along with xp nerfs is just a horrible idea.
---
Also their idea of balance with the fireproof perk is hilarious because it made any pure explosive build completely useless in PvP. You can counter an entire build with a perk card lol. 
---
You will have to monitor this change.  It brings these weapons more inline with the other weapons, but you have to realize that these guns became so necessary because people were tired of running out of ammo.  Every build I had prior to getting a tse weapon had to carry melee weapons to use whenever I was low on ammo for everything else.  You can't bullet sponge 300 rounds of 10mm into every mob.
---
I've just come across this bug, it's so infuriating. So the only answer is to send tickets through to Bethesda? 
---
This post was mostly just for the over armor outfit pieces 
---
Oh for sure
---
Guess what. TSE is GONE!
---
I agree.  If I'm at my camp in Flatwoods with plans to go to Cranberry Bog, I might go out of the way to fast travel to the Mire for an event if it's at a discount price.
---
Is your armorer perk high enough to apply the mod?
---
Ran into this with melee mods and not having the right perks. 
---
I use it as the damage, DPS and gunplay is insanely good
---
So the solution is to nerf everything once it gets popular, so nothing will be strong enough for players to grind for? great concept. Maybe try buffing other prefixes ffs.....
---
The only correct answer.
---
It's sad
---
Relay Tower EL B1 02
---
its near a fissure site as well
---
Lol well you shouldn't have to move all 50 points I wouldn't think 
---
Yeah, I don't see many people asking for that to be nerfed.
---
It's particularly crappy because I had one, and it vanished for no reason one day, and I spent thousands of caps on a replacement that's suddenly not worth as much. Gooooodtimes.
---
Ohh, is that what causes it?!
---
Wow, that line of work must really stink
---
If it takes you hours a day farming ammo to play the game. You are playing wrong. Craft ammo, better yet their are 2 perks that massively increase ammo created. Take over the Ammunition factory its soooo easy to get bullets. Trade vendors. Trade players. Stop lying and making excuses.
---
Always an upvote 
---
forsure - It does feel like it's been much longer though haha
---
Issue is caused by players not looting meat piles on the server, triggering garbage collection, stuff you drop has a higher priority on the delete list because dropping stuff is treated as garbage. 
---
Maybe youre not causing the issue but others on the server are. 
---
yep but 1 at a time
---
IKR, it's ridiculous. 
---
OR, get a dense modded chest piece and Fireproof lvl2 and quit whining.  They created a simple build method to be nearly impervious to all explosive damage, not just TSE.
---
Sent the request, I'll be around during the day tomorrow (and possibly later tonight).
---
I never thought it would happen but you have finally made me not want to play anymore. Thanks guys gg.
---
It was brought up to me a while back. When using Awareness you can apparently see the drop in DR with Tank Killer equipped and it only works for ballistic damage, not energy damage. 
---
Lol 
---
Bloodied mole gauntlet, adrenal reactions, twisted muscles, talons, nerd rage. If I let my health get low (high radiation or something) my damage gets up to 1200ish, without any food or chems or booze or anything.
---
You can buy them at the Enclave.
---
West Virginia wasn’t directly nuked, there wouldn’t be that many.
---
Seems similar to buy the new 50k truck we’ll take 15k off the price.  Why not to just list the price you want?  It’s all about marketing and making the buyer feel good.
---
I can understand not nerfing bloody as it's a high risk build. Even with a bloody explosive after the nerf it wont come close to how powerful melee is.
---
even with 200% repair and luck of the draw 3 I can't get thru 2 cores with my gat laser
---
Yeah those pink clouds are the enemy's behind those walls
---
This. No armor combo will come close to hazmat or PA- best case in reg. armor you'd be dicking around in your aid menu popping radaway 4 times a minute and get skull-F'd by a Glowing One or a Fog Crawler while you're staring at your pipboy or aid wheel.
---
Never really a issue. Only see groups of three unless I'm at White springs
---
Yay, I'm going to throw on my Excavator Power Armor with my Super Sledge and I will fit in with the other 100,000 other people doing it! Thanks Bethesda!
---
Yea I want more bosses like the scorched queen that gives us more choices if nuking other areas.
---
Yep.  Most of the complaints about melee seem to be when people min/max it with bloodied or unyielding, which means they are really complaining about bloodied and unyielding (which of course give crazy buffs to any weapons not just melee).  Melee weapons themselves are pretty well balanced among themselves, and of course require you to be right on top of somebody to be effective.  If you are a ranged build and let somebody with a sledge hammer get that close you have bigger problems than a melee nerf can or should fix.
---
Here's the thing though...I've never touched a 2 shot or explosive weapon and the game is too damn easy because everything dies in 1 or 2 hits. If i had a TSE weapon with my build i feel like enemies would die just by entering my general vicinity,  that's the only way i could become more powerful. 
---
The only thing that gives me a little pause are scorchbeast packs but i still took 5 minutes of my time to save a level 42 from 3 level 80 SBs and destroy them utterly. 
---
I'm not melee spec or shotgun spec either if that's what you're thinking. Ridiculously strong builds outside of the popular ones do exist. 
---
I think people just need to take a step back from the meta builds and look at things a bit more objectively. 
---
Let me get this straight, my tse is now going from a 300% damage increase to a 45% damage increase, looks like I'm going to a melee only build
---
If you are on Xbox and wanna see my Nuka-Palace so far let me know!
---
Yeah, hazmat suit and all of the non-PA defense perks like Barbarian, Ironclad and Evasive.  
---
Well they've made pure explosive builds essentially useless with their damage being so little for the ammo weight.
---
Here's a comprehensive guide
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad7fxu/enclavescout_armor_all_you_need_to_know_about_it/
---
Sounds like it might be because the mod is named the same for legs/arms/chest
---
If course people will still use them. If you come across a weapon that is better than the one you have (assuming it fits your build) then you use it.  Super Mutants don’t care about principles- pick up the damn rifle and blast away.  
---
That being said, 90% of my kills are with a 1* Instigating Lever Rifle.  Got it as a drop in Monster Mash at level 40ish and have used it ever since (lvl 120 now).  My close-in weapon is a TS Handmade with +crit in VATS (also a drop)
---
Would it be worth using with Bear Arms and Ordinance express? 
---
Dont use turrets. Its cheaper to repair an item or wall then a turret that kills your budget. 
---
I see. I remember I was in an early part of the game when I first donned it then got rid of it for some Tattered Rags.
---
My First SBQ netted me a Vampire’s Rolling pin. Not even the obligatory combat armor piece.
---
[Everybody gets a nerf!](https://i.imgflip.com/1ttjvy.jpg)
---
How? it's been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that doing 100k+ damage does little to no damage via capped slap damage. Unless you consented to pvp by accident or without your knowing.
---
 I'm asking for details because everyone so far has failed to provide proof of dying while in pacifist, through slap damage.
---
[Link of exploited shotgun](https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ) Can oneshot a queen but tickles carebears, because that's how pvp works.
---
More bosses *plus* better fight mechanics other than "shoot til she lands and then melee and shoot". Also maybe not such a stupidly massive health pool. Takes years to kill that thing. 
---
Don’t do anything to the two shot damage. Nobody wants it changed. We want duping and bobble head stacking fixed. 
---
But when you do change it (because why does the player base’s opinion matter?) change the attribute name to something else. Shooting “two” shots for only 125% weapon damage is ridiculous. 
---
“Vicious Handmade Rifle”
---
_Weapon damage is boosted by 25%_
---
I can't believe we're talking about nerfing things in a game full of bullet sponge ads.. Ok a boss should be a bullet sponge. But not the shitty ads. This is getting wildly out of control. 
---
Yep. Nuke zones were always the problem, especially with those damn robots lol. But what I was getting at originally was yes, TSE are OP in PVP now and when used greedily in PVE. From what experience I have with PVP I just see melee being the OP form once the nerf hits. I know it would be damn near impossible to find that happy middle between both set ups. While yes, I do use TSE, I use them to make my life easier not screw or wreck others. Id like to think they aren’t duped but these days it’s a fair chance they are. I have a TSE .50 cal that I’m built around and use for the queen and the queen only even tho it’s almost a waste because of having 10-15 low levels show up and scale her resistances to near impossible levels lol. My TSE handmade, I use to farm or do events when I’m the only one doing said event. When others show up I’ll put away the handmade and use my melee despite doing shit damage. Or like last night, I was doing AWOL and someone else showed up. He was melee so I waited for him to tag the mobs then I killed them. We both got exp, we both got claim on drops and it worked out just fine. I can understand to a point why the nerf is coming but for people that don’t abuse them, we are the ones getting screwed a bit but that’s life lol. It’s just a game 😂
---
Adding a wall first helps to place some stairs. The stairs will clip against it. 
---
While I dont mind a lonely wasteland, the lack of humanish NPCs really detracts from well, everything. 
---
Narratively, you know the ending of every single quest and story: they all died. So while the voice acting is probably the best Bethesda has done, I cant help but feel like, as I play through the story and the missions that there really is no point to any of this. I could just sit in my CAMP, and live off the land. There is no one to save, no one to help, no one to hate, no one to kill. There is no urgency to uncover truths or rush to take action because.... there is no one left to care.
---
The intro also feels jarring, that somehow we are the absolute last person to leave the vault, no one stuck around or teamed up, and worse, of the entire vault population, only 24.5 people... what, stayed in West Virgina? Did not get Raptured out? Where are the other Vault 76 dwellers? We are supposed to be reclaiming the wastelands and rebuilding, so you would think we would stick together.
---
And then following the Responders story, and BoS and even the raiders its like "Boy, these people seem like they had a really cool adventure! Wish I played THAT game!" Also, the amount of fresh corpses is weird, did everyone die like a week before the vault opened? All at once? 
---
And then on top of that, it is just suuuuuuuuuuuuper convenient that everyone thought to automate and record every little detail and recruitment process.
---
In a way, it is an interesting narrative, Fallout 76 is really one big ghost story. But I don't think it really makes for a compelling environment. I kind of wish they would release a borderlands-esque co-op game that takes place before Vault 76 opens, and has us play as all the interesting characters who are now dead.
---
There are a bunch of junk items that can't be bulked that this still works on. I hadn't noticed that stuff that could be bulked needed to be now, that's an interesting change.
---
I wish we could've known what was rare from the beginning... Who knows how many rare outfits were just thrown away 😭😭
---
I like this idea a lot. 
---
They should make super mutant s invincible as wel
---
Fuck PvP. This is a solo rpg and u know it.
---
Dude that would be 12.5 hours a day since launch. Even with beta hours, wow, just wow.
---
If you are on PS4, and I happen across you, I will give you a free sample. 
---
agreed, 2 shot on it's own was never even remotely the issue.  The only problem was 2 shot COMBINED with explosive.  
---
All this nerf does is make melee god, so time to respec to melee + shotgun (for enforcer).
---
this is my 4th attempt lets see whats gonna happen now
---
The only bad wine is the wine you can’t keep down.
---
Fallout76 isn’t an AAA game - it’s just AA.
---
I got to 82 before I feel comfortable with builds and such.  At 82 I’m still not completed the build fully which is why it would be nice for a one time character thing at least in my eyes.
---
Just because you don't have the bug does not mean its not a bug or a fix.  Many bugs they fix in game are not experienced by everyone and some fixes don't solve it for everyone. 
---
Omg that was one of my first 3* but my first was a pool que 
---
Exactly, if PvP is supposed to get balanced with the PvE balance being ignored completely, then everything need to be nerfed to stop one-taps.
---
I'm over 250 hours now and I have still never found a weapon with Explosive. Decent few Two Shot guns in my time. Mostly Big Guns that I passed off to my buddy (melee/rifle build myself). All these people mad that they are losing the duped weapons they didn't put any effort in for. 100% easy mode crutch weapons, Agreed.
---
Got to have a real game first
---
Im an alcoholic with this game... Is there a 12 step program? 
---
How about no. You can shoot a melee person with a gun... If you can't do that, then you obviously are not good at the game.
---
Sounds like we want the same thing.  People who want to RP a raider survivalist can use the PVP server and have their 'survival of the fittest' fantasy, but those who want to RP a vault dweller survivor can use the PVE server.  Am I wrong? Can both play styles be happy with this arrangement?
---
They already did, the queen emits 30 rads per second now.
---
Don't think so, pretty super no matter what mods you put on an energy weapon it stays the same base type. Example being a laser rifle with a scattershot mod, even though it works and behaves like a shotgun it still is considered a rifle. As far as I know that same thing happens with flamer mods, the gun works like a flamethrower but is still treated as a rifle when it comes to perks.
---
"We Failed"
---
Failing to kill the SBQ means havoc on the server for forty five minutes or so and results in losing 25 caps - and she doesn't just fly away. The Queen brings hell down on the Bog. Watoga is uninhabitable due to her and other SBs attacking everything. Fort Defiance is a target as well. 
---
Scorched spawns are increased across the server, leading to big bosses everywhere. Scorched Mirelurk Queens, Deathclaws, Anglers, SBs, all that and all level scaled to the area. A SMQ in the Bog would be a level 90 but in Toxic Valley would be a 70-80 (can't remember what she is rn.) It means consequences for not killing the SBQ and not just failing an event. You don't kill her, other players suffer.
---
Of course, they'd need to lower the buffs she gets for each player in the event significantly but not to the point she's easy. 
---
Something related to the Bot Stop events
---
I'd like to see a rare event where MODUS and the Muldoon call on us to help them. 
---
"Greetings, members. I regret to inform you that the programming for our new bots has...had an issue. We may be...machines but we make errors...from time to time. The bots are currently...targeting [INSERT SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE] and needs to be eliminated. We assure you that participation will be...well rewarded."
---
And have it drop like two two-start Legendaries or one three-star.
---
Trade parties or something else fun at the Whitespring Resort
---
There's way too much space at the Whitespring resort to not use it. Have weekly trade parties where players can interact and trade with each other if they like. The New Years thing worked, proving people will interact. Or have some of the rooms be starting points for raids on locations or other events.
---
Trading events
---
Lots of people have regular trading runs they make to the factions, killing scorched and mutants along the way to exhaust every cap from every trader. Let's make an event out of it. 
---
Ex: Grahm needs you to go find X thing. Bring back to Grahm and he'll pay you lots and lots of caps and drop legendary items.
---
I forgot how y’all 76 fan boys are 
---
This is honestly one of the most annoying things about the game. 
---
140. So not on Lvl depending like handmade, which i found twice in a safe. 
---
Range has the advantage of, well, range. Melee has to be standing pretty much right in your face to hit you. If you have marsupial and speed demon how is the melee even going to hit you?
---
No one really cares about the Two shot.  Two-Shot was just in the name of a problem weapon... Bethesda needed to focus on Explosive.  Make normal Two-shot weapons practically worthless now while not dealing with the OP explosive ones...
---
They need to split PvP and PvE balance.  Having said that I think TSE needed a nerf in PvE, not necessarily this much though.
---
Get tired of online games not balancing PvP and PvE separately when it’s entirely possible to do so.
---
TSE isn't becoming weak. Two shot is being reduced 75% due to instant killing all enemies besides scorchbeasts. Gotta be some kind of end game challenge, even if they are bullet sponges. Also the enemies do increased damage at higher levels. If that's not enough damage to you, remove some of your defensive perks or armor.

&gt; I want PvP active so I dont know if Ill encounter a friend or a foe, that was Todds goal. If we split them, everyone will be foe.
---
Not necessarily. Look at WoW PvP servers. Some people are gung-ho war nuts, others might like to see a little action, &amp; others don't really care for it, but don't mind being on a PvP server. I have seen an alliance help a horde or visa-versa with a quest mob or something along those lines. I've played for many years on both servers, at this point I just do PVE b/c I don't want to have to worry about AFKing somewhere or doing something that I have a limited time to do and can't afford to be camped. 
---
It would certainly skew the playerbase, but it wouldn't be so black &amp; white. 
---
Bet you’d like to blow Todd too for creating the “greatest fallout ever” too
---
Me too
---
i dont have time in my life for that... kids... work.... woman you know i just wanna enjoy the game and maintaining learned plans is no fun to me i hope they will give us this quality of life change
---
Take all the crap weapons from high level three stars ...so soul crushing to kill a high end three star and get a freaking wooden board of B's. 
---
Huh, I found that brother hood of steel lab coat and didn't think much of it. Just tossed it in storage. Also found a black cowboy hat and black prospector hat. 
---
I get that but then I lose all my plans and stuff. But I guess my idea isn’t popular but would make a qol adjustment for me
---
Still slows down mob kills, and that was necessary. Now we can move forward with higher lvl guns and leave dupes behind. Better than a full inventory wipe.
---
It really does. Personally I may have played a little to much to fast and I'm starting to him my wall. That being said I'll be honest and take the blame for that lol.
---
Yeah, but all real life lore and in game lore tends to suggest its an alien. Zetans are notorious for fucking with earthlings. 
---
My opinion’s changed since Bethesda made the edit to their post.
---
I think the viability of TS is heavily dependent on the weapon. I’m using a pistol build and on my revolver it’s gonna be pretty shit at 25%. The accuracy penalty is bad enough. On a mini gun or something automatic TS is still really viable
---
They can also stimpack as much as they want in PA, guess I just need to get a gun that can out DPS the healing of 30 stimpacks...
---
If you did it like a stash, where visitors can see them but not take them, that would be good. Or, have them lock and unlock. Where you could lock them to keep them safe, or make something where visitors can take items if they want. Like if I have extra plans, or food, I could stash them for newbies to take.
---
Yes, but even with gunsmith and luck of the draw, energy weapons still lose durability and break ridiculously fast in comparison to a ballistic weapon
---
Everything in bunker 3 should be CAMP displayable! https://screenshotscontent-d2002.xboxlive.com/xuid-2533274837653431-private/f20f0177-50ef-4773-aaba-d67a1d2bff16.PNG?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=fTsihCKQmL3g3HZ%2BTj2EIf9ESyD3oM6CNSGEXlRpELU%3D
---
You may want to go with instigating instead of 2-shot.  They're nerfing 2-shot on the next update.
---
Being able to stack damage from the same source shouldn't work. I can't take 100 bufftats to give myself 200 strength
---
Wow your post opposite mine.
---
There's a Nuka cola that removes rads (available for sale in Whitesprings).  There's a perk that removes rads during daylight hours.  
---
I do seem to recall seeing the rad removal from death being mentioned in the patch notes somewhere.
---
What is this? I keep hearing of “Inside the Vault” but I don’t care to google it because of how disappointed I am in this game.
---
I’m looking for any reason to come back and this is interesting, but I need a summarization because I have lazy eyes.
---
Please provide evidence, video preferably to avoid spreading false information, same as the inventory stealing myth, no solid proof besides "a guy on the internet said, saw, heard..."
---
200k [Exploited shotgun video](https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ) does little to no damage to non-consenting players. 
---
Obviously the video is exaggerated by the damage output but it further proves the point of 1-shotting through slap damage has not been recorded.
---
None of those would be as good as the current version of TSE.  I agree though that changing the prefix/suffix isn't the solution.
---
talk about a rocket launcher!
---
I believe its not. Go back and get it and show us 
---
Lol bullshit is it a "necessity". It's great, sure, but not absolutely 100% necessary.
---
I did a rifleman build from beta on my first character and could kill anything with multiple different rifles without a two shot effect.
---
I mean, the change won't remove dupers. They'll just move on to dupe the next best affixes until they get banned.
---
tell this to people like me on PS4.... im sick of tired of thinking that i dont have a specific plan and after buying it.... you can imagine end of the story :D
---
You move slower backwards than forward, so if you need to walk backwards to shoot them, they can sprint as you do...
---
Can't wait to get home and take mine out of storage now. I've only just started getting into melee (lvl 47) because I found a monster legendary Death Tambo. I take it you can use this in PA? 
---
man, for console players just waiting for new content the pacing on the info here is painful
---
It's a bit  complicated but it's still LLC from what I understand.
---
Well that makes sense.  Big difference between shooting a tank with a slug of lead and hitting it with a zap from an electric gun
---
Yea, this is a feature on purpose to curb the death exploit. Not lore friendly to die 30 times to have more health. You just need to get starched genes, sadly. Or radsponge with friends.
---
I enjoy meeting other survivors on the road and if someone stumbles onto my camp that’s great as well. So long as they don’t blow it up. Yes I know it can be repaired easily but it’s the principle.
---
Black Cowboy Hat isn't rare, the Cowboy Hat is and Atomic purchase and the Black Prospector's hat is rarer I believe
---
And you get duplicates.of them allll the fucking time
---
Three gold master hackers at L104 so far
---
I'm the same way with Vault Tec. If you play on PS4 and see a Workshop with something out of a Vault Tec merchandise catalogue, it's possible I did it.
---
Or you know, option C - Don’t make a shitpost🙄
---
Yes, but laser weapons with the scattershot mod are still treated as rifles, not shotguns, when it comes to perks which hopefully is a bug and not an intended feature
---
Living the dream brother.  God knows how many thousands of caps I’ve wasted.  I’ve probably funded half a couple friends plans learned
---
Sadly with the track record of having FIOS as my backbone provider for well over 14 years - their side (as well as my own network) have been great.  
---
Its sad that we have to deal with these sorts of issues because you and I know there's probably not much that could be done.  PS Pro?  Perhaps - but it was a typical scenario I've had before - Robot bearing down on you and then too much going on causing the system to take a hit and crash.  Can't tell you how many BSODs I've had from "too much" activity going on where I think the Playstation just craps out.
---
As others have posted - my FO4 used to crash on PS4 in the past and was so choppy - I gave up and went PC to play it.  Even now - I went back after FO76 came out to play FO4 just because its been like a year and the stuttering and delays on the game were bad.  Perhaps going to PC is the answer... sadly.
---
&gt; This means melee are forced into power armor which reduces their armor drastically due to lack of legendary armor.
---
lower armor isn't less survivability due to PA having the added bonus of letting you stab as many stimpacks into yourself as you want without animations slowing you down.
---
Thus begins the slide.
---
These are positive changes.
---
Please also consider:
---
**1. Allowing us to lock/protect some of our gear from scrapping or selling**
---
**2. Allowing us to scrap legendaries for...something**
---
**3. MARK KNOWN PLANS!!**
---
But then how would they artificially extend game time?
---
Not as quickly as a commando or heavy gunner build. 
---
Someone above suggested a hermit crab in a nuke with a timer to kill it or it blows and others suggested adding a no damage zone that detonates the nuke if you damage the nuke part of the crab too much. That seems like a fun idea and would force people to be careful with their aiming while still needing to put out the dps to kill it in time. 
---
/thread
---
I like the shading. See you in the wasteland!
---
You’ve built a really nice house! My favorite C.A.M.P.s are ones like yours, where their owners have put thought and effort into making them look like they belong in the West Virginian Wasteland.
---
No, I've scrapped 6 so far, and nothing. I certainly don't have it.
---
I haven't done much weapon scrapping on this playthrough. But now that I want it, they're not popping up. .....I dunno.....?
---
Now thinking about it mabey this is there way to get rid of duped guns 
---
Its called the fog and I do not recommend standing in it.
---
Yeah it would be nice to see dupe prevention added to those.
---
I've got a few TSE weapons and played for a bit today. What was nerfed? Stuff still died in a respectable time frame
---
They changed it, explosive effects are being rediced to max 20% of base gldamge as well and two shot is max 25% of base damage. Updated links are in an earlier thread by a bethesda employee
---
Killing 2 shot explosive means my +40% melee attack is back to being OP
---
Exactly, Seeing all these pissed off people coming out of the woodwork at us melee builds are laughable. Hello, you can kill us with a gun, We have to be on top of you to kill you. Them dying is a skill problem, not a balance problem.
---
I have tried a bunch of different weapon builds. Unarmed my was my main from the start, before I knew how OP it was. Especially because I'm normally a shotgun/rifle build in these games. This was my first Melee main character. 
---
I would still be okay with a slight nerf to melee. I can 1 hit all but Behemoth, Mirelurk Queen, and Scorchbeasts. And I'm not even a bloodied build. 
---
Yeah the Tesla Rifle and Laser Rifle both have mods for shotgun conversion, but are still affected by rifle perks instead of shotgun perks
---
Sounds like a fun time 
---
Her voice makes me cringe. I will probably never reroll a new character knowing I have to go through her Quests again.
---
I agree and higher level tiers need to be introduced as well
---
Yeah, I've had someone gift me plans, and a full power armor set at a low level, but then I've also had them shoot me and follow me until I just server hopped to get away. 
---
"Inside the Vault" is Bethesda's annual/bimonthly/monthly/fortnightly/weekly/daily/frequent/sporadic update on the game and patches and upcoming changes or at some point content additions.
---
Can't blame you for being disappointed in the game.
---
If only there was some way they could place the latest "Inside the Vault" into game's main menu.
---
The nerf will come in the next patch.
---
I'm finding all these dupers crying about the nerf pretty funny
---
" **Systems**: Rads will no longer completely be removed when by dying repeatedly " is the official line from the patch notes.  The way it reads, death should still remove some rads, but I've noticed that it doesn't seem to anymore either.
---
Level 120 tribal character here
---
I have full legendary trapper armor and a modded vault suit under my wildman rags. Before i enter a nuke zone, I pop a rad shield and a rad-x diluted as I have mutations and rad-x proper suppresses them. I have max rad resistance as a perk too. I have to devote a lot of resources into this arrangement.  
---
Note: I use trapper armor as it has the best starting rad resistance. I make all pieces leaded to improve rad resistance, and most now have +25 rad resistance legendary effect, Though I think that legendary effect is broken at this time.
---
I also have my pockets stuff with toys at the moment which are also giving me a slight boost apparently.
---
It's not hard to hit someone with speed and marsupial if your close enough you can just vat them each time they get far enough 
---
I 100% support this as well. Nerf one, then the 9ther needs a nerf as well to make it balanced.
---
Well it's true the real life naked mole rats are known for their [pain insensitivity](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/10/how-naked-mole-rats-conquered-pain-and-what-it-could-mean-us):
---
&gt;In 2008, the studies led to the finding that naked mole rats didn’t feel pain when they came into contact with acid and didn’t get more sensitive to heat or touch when injured, like we and other mammals do.
---
So I can see an offshoot in Fallout where some specific subspecies of the Molerat, in the Ash Heap let's say, could have developed a denser, more fire resistant hide than the standard variant. [It would be like in FNV where you can skin the various Gecko types to craft better leather armors](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Gecko-backed_leather_armor,_reinforced). 
---
They’re substituting TS for Powerful, an effect in F4.  See, Explosive has a counter-acting perk and modifications, but Two Shot is just extra damage.
---
It’s all pointless. The One Punch meta is coming.
---
Actually, yeah, I haven't had the radio on a lot in 76.  In fact, if I'm in an unsafe place, I'll often turn the nearest radio off, even if it's just static.  Did that yesterday in the Bog, and was suddenly in a fight with the toughest mirelurk queen I've ever fought.
---
Of course, that's because after I turned the radio off, I could hear it pretty far away, and decided to pick a fight!
---
What do you want me to draw next?
---
46480359
---
I saw your post, and those enemies you mentioned *should* be tougher. The SBQ should be more of a race against the clock than a 3 minute fight (or less with bobblehead stacking). If you see a level 91 deathclaw coming at you, you should pee a little. I know it's fun to be powerful and beat them up fast, but it removes the challenge 
---
Patch notes are amazing.
---
That sounds cool. Retake areas. Add in factions so maybe whichever group retakes the area gets bonus loot or vendor discounts. 
---
Yeah, I kinda marvel at these people. I have a 2* Lever Action that is +30% damage to Scorched and +33% VATS accuracy, and that is my go-to in almost every scenario. And outside of giant monsters (cryptids and such) I rarely need more than 3 bullets to kill anything; if I catch them from stealth its usually just one.
---
Like, what game are they playing where they consider it impossible to be successful without a TSE? The highest level mob I’ve ever fought (outside of the SBQ) was a level 91 glowing Alpha Deathclaw and I dropped that thing in 5 bullets. Does anyone really need to be *more* effective than that?
---
12 steps to the can, and back, then 12 steps to the kitchen and back.....
---
Ugh I hate having to repeat the my points.  What your are asking for is comparable to having a world where all the herbivores get to live happy lives secluded , safe,  and protected and all the predators exist on a separate island where all they do is kill themselves. It makes no sense. I don't even pvp,  it's not something I'm super interested in, I just like the looming threat that pvp can happen.  That there is a reason why you shouldn't wander around with 600lbs of junk, knowing beyond doubt that NO ONE can ever hurt you, I don't like the idea of people having to constantly switch servers to claim workshops or prime real estate. I like the idea that there is a small chance that the random nearby MAY not be friendly .
---
Didn't know you could lock these, holy shit.
---
Gonna be nerfed on next patch, looking at 75% damage reduction on 2 shot, and a 80% damage reduction on explosive.
---
if the base damage is less than 15 away from all rise’s then it might be better but if not then i’d keep it as a secondary or sell it
---
Then just... stand further away?
---
I was also disappointed that the accordian was only junk and I couldn’t play it or anything
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I know. Even after promising concise patch notes you'd think they'd stop the stealth changes but that still hasn't happened.
---
This guy bought the rum bottle...
---
Man we thought this game was a grindfest before. Just wait till this goes into effect. Better be ready to spend 15 minutes killing a glowing one.
---
It is, I didn't get a delayed shipping notice and mine should have gone out in wave one originally.
---
&gt; remove it from the game along with nocturnal
---
Conditional weapons like that were only good in single player Fallout when you could rest for 8 hours in game and in 30 seconds it would be night again. You could define your own play style b/c of that, especially with Mister sandman.
---
In a world where you can't accelerate time, they are horrible. Even the conditional perk cards that work only during the day. They would be great if they were only half as effective at night or something. But get rid of the weapons, for sure. 
---
I like the trophy idea. Let's you get a guaranteed reward from the boss. Make it a guaranteed plan drop, but make it a quest item or otherwise untradeable so the trophy is locked to your progression. Maybe add in a unique junk/crafting item it drops that's necessary for building the trophy so theres some value in repeating the kill if you want multiples of the trophy or you need to rebuild it after scrapping it. 
---
Deal.
---
I know and i don't care 
---
I think that's the point, market should be super low right now, then when people stop freaking out and realize that they're still great guns, it'll go back up.
---
Wish the gallery was longer, lol. great job compiling the list! Thanks
---
If you're close enough is very situational. If  a ranger has a good enough build and weapon then you probably won't get close enough anyway.
---
Lol
---
Oh damn that sucks. Several of my weapons aren't amazing, but are either two shot or explosive that I enjoy using and clearly not duped. Kinda shitty to nerf legitimate weapons from people.
---
Clear out the duped, or nerf TSE sure, but doesn't seem right to kill off other weapons
---
45% explosive resistance ain't worth not getting diseases.
---
Ah ok, thanks :)
---
Set that amount to zero and I'm down with that.  :)
---
All Rise is a great starter weapon, but there is much better rng items. I would take that over AR
---
We have already seen that developers in the Bethesda aren't brightest stars when it comes to balance the game. Looks like they want all people to choose melee build, which is ridiculously overpowered already.
---
Bobble head in their intended state should be fine, issue with that is dupers have millions of them.  Since you can't craft bobbleheads, and they are supposed to be rare-ish then stacking them would have been totally fine. 
---
If the night/day cycle was longer I could see the Nocturnal items being minimally useful, but as is it's pretty much an instant drop/sell whenever I find one.
---
I think 500 or 1000 caps is fair
---
If you tried to invite them first go to team and press X on your name, leave team. Then try. Won't show if you're in a team and it makes one if you're alone, if you join and meet ingame there's also a button prompt there to invite eachother without using the menu, could possibly work.
---
Yeah, there are. Vendors sell them. Annoyingly, they aren't called "Excavator Mod" but just "Mod". If you look at the scrap materials for the mod and it lists black titanium, it's an excavator mod.
---
That works too 😁
---
Yep. Enjoy your guns, dupers!
---
"*I didn't dupe though and now mine is worse too*". That sucks. It's a shame other players have forced this change.
---
"*They should have buffed everything else instead*". Why kind of logic is that? So now **everything** in my inventory one shots 95% of NPCs on the map? Erm. No. This is meant to be survival?? Softcore or not.
---
Stimpacks are not always instant heal. I have been killed plenty of times trying to stim during a fight, and even witnessed multiple people die too. People mad about the TSE weapons need to get over it. It was a severely OP weapon. If they want to whine about losing the effects of it, they can blame the dupers for duping them and making them a common weapon for people. This wouldn't have been a problem if they remained rare. But it was fucking annoying to be killed constantly in one shot with them from people being assholes trying to attack you and passive mode never saved you from it. If they didn't do that, the constant explosions would be enough to crash your game. So ultimately blame the dupers for duping them to the point that everyone had one, and blame the users with these guns for being little pricks. I'm literally jumping for joy at this announcement today.
---
I generally just listen to videos that give me specific info like build advice , how to find something or gives me backstory or history . I tend to shy away from videos that either argue for or against Bethesda being a evil entity or God like saint :p  
---
Same, see too many of the same outfits! And not a problem 👍
---
Is that that place in the mire with all the bones in the water at the bottom? 
---
The first DLC will be a massive infestation of Cazadors. 
---
I played fallout since 1 on PC....always been a sniper build. My first character on this was a sniper build until I found out that there were no legendary sniper rifles. Then I went to my 2nd choice big gun/assault rifle build. I’ve never been a fan of melee but that’s me. Fallouts have always offered different play styles a fair chance. I can’t one shot the big stuff either with my usual weapons, now if I change a few perks and pull out the TSE dragon that’s a different story. That damn thing is way OP especially when doing 2.5x dmg from sneak attack. 
---
PS4: So... Umm... Whitespring ghouls... The seem to be dropping legendaries like candy even if the ghoul itself ISNT a legendary.
---
It’s happening between servers so... I think you may have messed up there Bethesda.
---
I trashed mine and regretted it, then found a new set in a random baggy on the ground, crafted the lvl 50 versions, and realized I can't use them for my build anyway :P
---
you would finish that one new thing in an hour then be right back to grinding and farming if you have not already developed your own mini-game objectives. 
---
Been happening to me for two days now. Frozen in the pip boy and can only view the map. I have to restart the game every time
---
Agreed, unless melee is nerfed or pve and pvp servers implemented then everyone will go melee and it will be nerfed next.
---
One system in the game is "designed that way."  Easy enough compromise - on PvE servers, you can't take a workshop unless it's unclaimed.  Have the player lose their claim if they don't do the "Defend" or "Reclaim" quests.  
---
If only we had a little more storage to make collecting stuff a viable option
---
Were you on Xbox? I just did a queen exactly like that a little bit ago. It was a blast
---
Sometimes I forget to eat...in real life that is. 
---
It is if you don't perk as a glass cannon
---
I'm reminded of Top Gear and the prototype car runs...
---
Yea, than nerf that too.
---
Sounds like bad perk priorities then, paired with dense its 100% resistance for me.
---
Sounds like your problem is you are using the wrong gun. I dont have a TSE, and I dont have a problem dropping enemies (besides SBQ). 
---
If your problem is ammo conservation, dont use an automatic gatling gun on every enemy. Diversify your arsenal, and use melee.
---
This definitely reminds me of the Creation Club horse power armor! It neighs when you get in it and you can jump extra high! I would love to have that in fo76.
---
So I started as a sneak rifle build. Recently swapped to melee. I was able to 1 or 2 shot most things from stealth safely. Now I get to 1 or 2 shot things but take damage.
---
I die more in melee more than I did as stealth and the only advantage I have as melee is I can kill a bit faster. Downside is I am at way more risk of dying.
---
Melee isn't that OP.
---
Only real OP thing I can say about melee being great is I don't need to farm for ammo.
---
This is PVE only. Pvp is broken as hell and they need to adjust a LOT for any PVP to be worth discussing at all.
---
I really don't feel melee is that OP when I can alway sit and hide, very very safely, in stealth and kill almost as fast as melee. I kept my stealth and rifle perks and don't see much of a damage difference between the 2. 
---
Also keep the garbage ass armor. Honestly Fuck this game. I have 268 hours in this fucking game and nothing to show for it because the opposition is way too OP and I don’t cheat or dupe.
---
Man they toasted some expensive cars
---
Yeah takes hella skill to play a PVE, game doesn’t have massive problems, the learning curb is just so high that only super intelligent people like you can play it, my bad I forgot that
---
Worked in FO4 too
---
That’s annoying...thanks for the tip
---
If it can be bulked, it can’t be sold for caps. If it can’t be bulked, it can be sold for caps. Been that way since beta. No change here. Fake news.
---
Same, hes probably a melee build which will be the next nerf
---
Let's wait for the nerf before suggesting buffs.
---
To early to tell
---
Careful about saying servers will be up forever.  Forever is a mighty long time 
---
How much would you take for all the 308 ammo?
---
I think they will release some more "raid bosses", but it might take a long time. Bethesda is already focusing their resources to other new games and only few people are maintaining FO76 current and future updates. Don't expect anything big to be released, because its not going to happen anymore.
---
So i'm gonna start off by saying that's convincing and thank you for backing up what you were saying.
---
I would have liked to see the other player's armor and perks.  That would help a bit.  It does sound like I most likely got caught up in the frenzy.
---
Feel free to post that up front next time.
---
It'd be cleaner to have the pacifist flag be set at character creation (or at level 5), and not be changed.
---
Imagine if a boss like the Queen would go rampaging around the entire map. Coordinating attacks on her would be something to see. Lowbies hiding in buildings and shooting from the windows, groups of high levels in pursuit. Allow any weapon to hit/register damage so anyone that can get off a shot gets basic credit for the encounter and allow those who stay with it or do large damage get bonuses.  
---
A world announcement lets you know to take cover or converge for the hunt.  
---
World quest started -"Death comes for all!"  
---
Take cover! Take courage! Together we can prevail!
---
Deathclaw the size of a house comes rampaging out of the fissure. Or whatever.
---
I'm about damage output.
---
I think you whooshed yourself ;)
---
I see your point. I think they can still reach a balance where they have a couple things that are ridiculously hard no matter the numbers, a few things that requires groups to be done well, and a bunch of stuff that can be done however you want. 
---
I believe I saw one on a shelf in a shed in the cranberry bogs. There were a bunch of animal cages there as well. Not sure it's the same item or what the location was called. 
---
Incoming Fallout: Battle Royale....
---
The ones up in arms are the idiots who used them to be pricks. I'm living for the angry posts today because the terror that I and many other people have endured from these op weapons is worth all the salt today. 
---
A Nuka Cola bottle.
---
Nice part about outfits is they only weigh 0.1 so that helps a bunch at least
---
Painting a rusted car might be a better metaphor. It takes work to fix it, fire usually indicates damage beyond the ability to fix. I know where you are coming from, though.
---
&gt; (please don't make me keep going it hurts xD)
---
But please, for the record, give us a detailed &amp; exceptionally thorough description from conception of the car to the arson/glitch. No detail is too small nor should be omitted. ;)
---
Melee str bonus goes. Also bloody..
---
Strength 1 = +5%  
---
Strength 2 = +10%  
---
Strength 3 = +15%  
---
Strength 4 = +20%  
---
Strength 5 = +25%  
---
Strength 6 = +30% 
---
Hell yeah.  That's pretty much how I ran my favorite character in FO4, except with more stealth.  But I haven't really had a whole lot of luck with stealth in FO76.  Might be time to change tactics.  Thanks, man! 
---
meh just sell them
---
Alright! I could probably do it right now.
---
Please since you did heavy job with the list... how much time you waste every day maintaining it ?
---
Plus, I would prefer servers to be a little bit more stable before letting players bring even more things into them 
---
They could lock the plan to your account only like they do atom shop purchases. So you can only build it at your camp and no one elses .
---
This I agree with
---
you are absolutely right
---
Ok, the specific term they used is "until the sun burns out"...
---
https://segmentnext.com/2018/11/05/fallout-76-servers-will-remain-live-until-the-sun-burns-out/
---
Not my words, theirs. 
---
Truthfully that doesn't matter really because in ten years technology and games will be so much more advanced I can't guarantee I would even want to play. 
---
&gt; Global damage increases - i.e. Bloody Mess.
---
It's been a global damage increase since FO3 and survives FNV. No way that changes now.
---
Or the burning smg.. sad face
---
Working fine on ps4
---
It's still a terrible change. The TS isn't a problem at all, I have no idea where they got the idea that it is.
---
I have to disagree.  I'm relatively certain that opening PvP for everyone will increase griefing.  
---
That poor noob. Walked straight outta the vault straight into deathclaw mating season and into the arms of a very aroused Alpha Male Deathclaw. 
---
Uh well I ran out of blinker fluid
---
And you need a lesson in either math or the mechanics of the game, since you think that ammosmith and super duper makes 360 rounds of 5mm. It's 280. 
---
Lol that's great. Thanks for reminding me of that as well!
---
Now we need some screenshots 
---
I totally support deathclaw mating season. If only because it'll be fucking hilarious. 
---
Same goes for Nuka Cola machines. I'd like to store my bottles and display them.
---
This. Sadly my one two shot weapon will now have to be retired. Good thing I found it myself.
---
Yeah especially since a massive portion of the duped guns were sold to people who then used them to ruin other peoples' gaming experience through griefing (not to mention duping itself was constantly crashing servers). Now they are all whining about their gaming experience being ruined. It's pretty delightful.
---
I keep my doors open if I’m there, lock them if I’m gone. As long as they give me a wave, don’t drag enemies in, and don’t wreck the place, I don’t mind.
---
I do diversify except the my shotgun doesnt damage scorchbeast for some reason. My lever action is even slower at damage. My gatling gun is the only decent gun that does damage to scorchbeasts
---
Seriously, teddy bears should be collectible with a display case available to show them off. They really missed something here. They could have an achievement or three attached to collecting bears, and I (personally) would buy a display case offered in the atom shop (which is saying a lot, because I don't buy anything there unless I've earned the atoms in-game).
---
Just a lot of stuff they can do that they just aren't. :-\
---
PS4 around 13:45 EST.
---
Yes, you can stop it by going on a hunger strike.  Start tonight.  
---
As someone who only recently got a two shot lever and a two shot pump...two shot is not "really good."  Yes its better than most of the other prefixes, but unless I start spamming chems, bobbles and buy duped serums, its only a little better final damage than what I was doing before.
---
Each point in charisma gives 1%, so 15+5 (for armor pieces that have +1C) 20% making your total 55%
---
And cranberry relish gives 10%, you said food gived 5. Making your total now 60%.
---
You’re welcome :)
---
Thanks for the update - I didn't know they did that.  
---
If they drop slap damage to zero and prevent CAMP damage, I'll be happy with that solution.
---
As a flamethrower weapon? Mmmmm ok
---
Scout armor mods are lacking the flags in the description for chest and limbs.  If you can't place the polymer on the leg it's because it's for the chest same with other mods and vice-versa.
---
As someone that went full rifleman sneak (not a lot of vats) that’s a bummer. I never got a TSE, just had a few two shot rifles but even that damage was negligible. My gf that plays went melee and would easily face tank and do more damage despite my obsessive need to maximize dmg/perks. Now my two shot is even more bleh. I usually love doing this glass cannon class in previous fallouts and other games, but in this one it’s not worth it. 
---
Your choices are get a TSE gun, go full vats build, or go melee, all benefiting in PA. Being funneled into these “choices” doesn’t seem like fallout games, it feels like FO4s main storyline ending. I’ll admit the explosive dmg was definitely broken on TSE, but what isn’t broken is standard Two shot guns. Rifles specifically need help, and other guns to some extent when compared to melees dmg. Normally I don’t use vats, and the clunkiness of this new vats makes it even harder to submit to the spamming. 
---
I feel like we all go into this game expecting to have so many different builds, but we all end up quite relatively the same.  Despite all the duping, exploits, and money hungry atomic shop, the least they could do is pay attention to balance with a closer eye.
---
Yes you are also endlessly farming ammo and most enemies come to you, not to mention vats tele. 
---
I have one I took right as we launched the second nuke right before I disconnected. :C
---
Feelsbadman.
---
Under what circumstances would you want to carry around multiple weapons for specific enemy types just to get a 5% increase in damage? Until/unless they add in dungeons that consist of 80-100% of a single enemy type, most people would prefer the +25% against all enemies rather than +30% against a single type.
---
I don't have one, but the terror that I and others have endured from the trolls with them have been worth all of this salt that I am seeing today. News couldn't come fast enough. This is a step in the complete right direction.
---
I just love you pretty much kill everything in the stroke zone, to complete objectives, so they orbital strike dirt...
---
I have proof of staff doing and allowing an encouraging an proffitting off hate speech an slander an exploitation an extortion etc
---
&gt;You may recall late last year we mentioned we’re working on a new way of playing the game that removed PvP restrictions. While we’re still doing some tweaking and adding, we thought we’d give you a little more info to go on. Think it of it like playing the game you’re playing right now, but with no PvP rules. We want to introduce significantly more tension, drama, and consequences with every encounter with another human player. We’ll go further into this new mode next week.
---
You want griefers? Because that’s how you get griefers. 
---
There are lots of counters to high melee damage already, the simplest being to not let them get close...
---
Just purchased a calibrated shock plan and I have more free cap space.  I'd be willing to do 6,000 caps but it has to be within the next 10 mins or so.  Leaving soon.  I'll message again when I'm leaving.
---
If you don't get this message until after then, hope you're able to get one soon.  I know how it feels trying to server hop over and over....lol
---
Look at OP’s post history. His very first post is him selling tons of TSE Weapons...he’s a duper. 
---
You are wrong ive never once engaged in pvp and im fucking pissed about getting my non explosive two shot weapons nerfed by 75%. Its not even a two shot anymore. Im so heated.  
---
how do you get 100% armor penetration?  And someone who tested the effect of anti armor plus the melee perk showed it didn't add that much damage.
---
People cried because of getting one shot in pvp not understanding how it's a buggy mess then cry it's the dupers no it's a buggy mess now it's the bobbleheads tse would be fine if they fixed exploits first I hate that I hate melee and now I can't compete I mean I'll check it out but for real the exploiters and dupers get fixed first then stability then game balance
---
i always do it this way the first time i saw the north west of it i was like WHAT THE HOLY FUCK is this shit, its trash do south east its way better
---
I don't entirely disagree with that, but I think bound items in a survival game doesn't really fit.
---
The only real way to play a Fallout game.
---
r/Fo76Enclavians
---
It’s just dumb when you follow her instructions as low INT char.  E.g. remember Stanislaus Braun: you may follow his instructions or do things in your way. With Rose there is no your way, only stupid raider way. My only wish during her quest was to disintegrate her into the plasma goo. And I can’t! Such disappointment. I don’t remember any NPC in whole fallout series I hate less.
---
Wait so two shots dont drop anymore? Good thing I got a two shot gatling laser early on.
---
Yes, of course! I’m not saying it’s ok, maybe just a little bit less noob friendly
---
&gt; a world where all the herbivores get to live happy lives secluded , safe, and protected and all the predators exist on a separate island where all they do is kill themselves.
---
You could always choose to live life as a herbivore on the predator island, nothing is stopping you from doing this.  It seems like it would give you what you desire in your game play experience, the looming threat that PVP can happen.  
---
Seems like everyone would be happy then.  
---
Is this more of a Goldilocks problem, where you feel that a no risk is too little and that a PVP only server would be too much risk for you?
---
Perhaps this could be balanced out if the PVP server had greater rewards?  What do you think?
---
I don't even drink but I considered. Glad I dodged that bullet. But I do have an actual Nuka Cola mini fridge in my room! lol 
---
Im just over here missing my kneecapper mod. Best 10mm pistol i ever had.
---
I am speaking to you from the future, do not be afraid. It is not pint sized slasher, it is just a weird toy box kiddy themed Power Armor skin. Now I must go, the time space continuum is a fickle mistress!
---
850+ hours and 5 characters over lv 100? Homie, no offense but go outside or something lol.
---
I agree with everything you say but the reality is melee will be op after the nerfs, in that it will deal many X more damage than ranged.
---
This will likely lead to complaints, which will lead to nerfs, just as already happened with TSE.
---
I'm not on either side here, I don't really have a dog in the fight.  I hope the game winds up in a fun and balanced state in the future regardless what changes they implement.
---
Fair enough, I can agree with most of this, even if tentatively simply because we don't have any experience with the post nerf world.
---
I plan to become a diluted radaway factory in Flatwoods once this feature is in. 
---
You will see the community in my profile 
---
Oh I cant wait to see Dangerous Wounding Two Shot Explosive weapons...      
---
     
---
Arrrgghhhhhhhh power creep
---
Yes. I want this so much. Along with a camp budget increase so I can actually afford to add them. 
---
The display manikins for your armor from skyrim dlc 
---
Even as going as far as one shotting entire areas that others are farming is still a dick move even if you are not pvping. I've seen tons of that too. Then they give you that thumbs up to be a douche.
---
Would be sad to see people leave the game because of this. While I feel like this totally destroys my current build, hopefully the community can band together to find alternative builds that are equally effective on the strongest enemies. 
---
I want some molten boron. Nobody doesn't like molten boron.
---
That's because of an exploit and I'm hoping it will be fixed with this patch too.
---
They need to nerf the things that are op and buff the things that are weak on an individual basis. They already did across the board buffs to automatics that still left the LMG near useless but also made the Gatling gun uncharacteristically powerful. If they nerf melee across the board I’m going to really boned since I’m using brass knuckles and a lot of of other melee users are as well. 
---
Great suggestion but that will have a heavy impact on their business model - getting people to pay 5-20 bucks for an asset that already exists.
---
Yes I have one for my Lancer. It has 3 spawn points I know of. 
---
Hopefully it helps.
---
I use the slugger, master slugger and expert slugger plus the one that makes youvswing faster and ignore aome of the enemy armor, can’t remember the name but it’s all under strenght
---
Yup the nerf will fix nothing. People will still get one shotted. 
---
Thank de bebe Jesus
---
Yeah. When I found a few I was like "ooooohhhh!" and then the crushing fact hit me all I could do was scrap them. 
---
Another great read is "The Road to Wigan Pier" by George Orwell.  It's set in England, but describes the working conditions of the coal miners there, and it's unbelievable based on what we know today.  Some of these men had to crawl up to a mile through a 2'x3' tunnel just to get to the start of their shift, then back again after a day of backbreaking labor breathing coal dust.  
---
pretty sure 2 shot is the biggest problem doesn't it give 100% damage boost?
---
Alright that’s all I had. I was wondering if there were any others
---
So, I did some more research and it does show that you'll just hop in and be able to play with dozens of others. However, with Bethesda, that's not a good thing as we've learned from ESO and their unstable servers because they didn't expect so many people to be into Elder Scrolls. Maybe they could have learned from their server problem and let people actually have a server list.
---
Bye felicia 
---
Holy crap dude, get starched genes you crazy son of a gun...lol
---
I'd hate to play russian roulette dropping my junk bag every time I needed to die to offload rads.
---
I can't tell if you're serious or trolling by this point, what you're saying makes no sense.  It's irrational blame a majority PVE playerbase, playing a majority PVE game, for the lack of PVP participants.  You can blame Bethesda for not implementing a better system, or for not providing dedicated PVE and PVP servers.  But regardless of their intent, this is a PVE game, with a PVP side activity that most are avoiding in favor of the more fleshed out PVE content.
---
And you can judge what we do however you want, but it won't change that we're the ones getting more out of the game.  Some people like exploring, building, grinding, even roleplaying.  The "tiny safe box"  you claim we restrict ourselves to is the entire map, especially in pacifist mode, and "non-imaginativeness" is an even harder claim when you compare creative camp layouts and roleplay to a higher level players demolishing level player's camp out of boredom and spite.
---
The attempt at PVEVP failed.  It failed hard, and it failed quickly.  Bethesda should've known better, since they know the kinds of people who play their games.  I have nothing against PVP as a general concept.  If FO76 were more balanced and less glitchy, I might even have some interest in it.  I think the workshop PVP idea is fine in theory, as well as the nukes, though I think both could use work.
---
I'm not arguing that it shouldn't exist.  I am arguing that it should be offered separately, through dedicated servers, which would solve the whole boredom problem pretty easily by ensuring that PVP players get grouped with other PVP players, or at least PVE players who are open to PVP interrupting their exploration and building and whatnot.  I'm not sure why you don't see that, and instead just want to bash PVE players.
---
The reason is financial, not developmental.  2x development cost/resources.
---
I think just about every vendor is going to be selling any TSE weapon in circulation shorty. 
---
Arent they nerfing and eliminating new ones from dropping?
---
I'm not that guy, I was simply annoyed that he didn't post these links which were easy to find.
---
Agree, I'm totally onboard it being just a two shot. That explosive effect is what I was referring too.
---
I thought you wanted screws, not pins 
---
I played my Beta character a few times after release, when I would team up with a friend. My release character was still low level. Once he got leveled higher, the Beta went inactive. 
---
It seems that it is mainly to put all the griefers on one server, leaving the pve servers to breathe a bit
---
Wouldn't joining a team solve this? 
---
Different teams would be different raider factions?
---
Nuka World taught us that raider factions do go to war with each other under certain circumstances.
---
I don't completely disagree with the nerf it's just I think they are going around it in the wrong way. splash dmg was/is overpowered. If they nerf melee I would be fine with it, I do like a challenge. 
---
Thanks all, I found the required leathers and made the item.
---
I think it's mislabeled, though. It's a MOD, not a plan. You can't build it by itself and must have another item to make it.
---
How about we move away from basic things like +damage for effects, or at least give them hefty downsides for that? (With two-shot's damage bonus being lowered, maybe the accuracy penalty will be more of a trade-off).
---
Perhaps even have explosive not be bonus damage, but rather that it turns a portion of the damage into explosive (for example, a normally 100 damage weapon would now do 80 damage directly, with a 20 damage tiny AoE explosion).
---
I just think basic bonus damage is a bit boring, and so much more can be done with legendary effects.
---
Just for example, how about we see neat effects like a % chance to grab aggro? (Maybe with a limit to it to avoid abuse).
---
That .44 ammo looks mighty Juicy. I can buy a Lilly bit with what I got. Not rolling in caps though.
---
The are making TS legacy. Meaning that no new TD weapons will drop. But explosive will still be on the table
---
Dupers are already getting banned and I've seen a bunch of them saying they are just going to buy another copy of the game in threads in this sub today.
---
Which is good because that's more money for future development to benefit us all. 
---
For those that follow the appeal process and decide to act humble, maybe the bans will be reversed. Otherwise the game is cheaper now and goes on sale so if they want to play again they pay the 30$ fine and start over.
---
I’m having the same issue. I’m unable to log into Bethesda’s website and unable to change my password. Have never duped, but I do have a mule character that carries shit me and my friends have found but can’t carry but he only weighs 1400lbs
---
All those Nuka Cola statues and posters and toys that I can't actually put in my CAMP. Makes me shed a tear. 
---
One tip if your not too fussy about messing with options is just use Nvida's Experience software (Would have installed when you installed the drivers for your card) and set it to automatically choose the best settings for any game you install. Open it up, choose your game and set to optimal. See how it runs? Set it to best, see how it runs (Helps to also use its built in FPS counter which i always have on anyway). If not happy with either then its the in game settings until you are. If you have not already, go into settings of the bios and see if you have an auto overclock option. The standard 4790 will overclock to 4.0mhz on all 4 cores. You'll squeeze that little more out of the CPU. Mine is unlocked but i have it set simply to 4.4, as never needed to take it further! 
---
There’s peobably a lor more combination of perks that adds to this though.
---
Thanks! I received a lot of great feedback I might just have to come up with a few more concepts to share again :D
---
I too want this please
---
say goodbye to your account if you do just fyi
---
As a level 21 baby I had someone do this the other day and I really appreciated it! They must have motioned to me about 6-7 times and after the first 2 my suspicions flew out the door!
---
I also had a 3 star rolling pin drop recently. I immediately added the metal (aluminum?) mod to it. I'm not spending another dime on the game so here's my suggestion - Someone needs to make an account named Mama Dolce and role play it.
---
I'm not even sure how to respond to this, any mod is equally rare, people will just have new priorities
---
Literally never done that but I kniw what you mean. Two shot alone wil barley 1 shot anything over 40. Im all good with nerfing explosive. Or at least balance the enemies out to not be bullet sponges. I feel really fucked over rn. 
---
Is this still the case?
---
He asked if budget increases. My budget is increasing. That is my experience. If it's a bug or not I don't know but I'm telling him that in my experience budget does increase.
---
Are you able to fire automatics yet?
---
That awesome, I need to see that homes..
---
the removal new ones was retracted. In cases like these its better just to follow the official forums
---
I have this problem ! Is there a list to be on because I am desperate for a fix. 
---
I was helping a lower level with I am become death earlier.  His game crashed when in silo and never came back.  I solod the rest of the silo and nuked whitespring.  
---
Fast travelled.  My game crashed.  Lucky I tried a recent player on my list and got back in.  Killed a 3* legendary ghoul...dropped a 3* rolling pin.
---
Turned off my console straight away.  I'm not farming for the next 2 hours for these drops.  There needs to be a reliable way of farming good loot, even if it means using more resources/ increasing difficulty.
---
2 shot makes every other prefix worthless on guns, it's still unhealthy 
---
I think the Two-shot nerf is justified because it invalidated nearly every other primary legendary prefix. 
---
My ideal scenario is them replacing every Two-shot prefixed gun with an otherwise identical [Violent](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_weapon_effects) gun, then buffing enemy specific prefixes (Troubleshooter's, Zealot's, etc.) to +100% damage. 
---
Explosive has some weird, janky damage values that really need to be ironed out. I'd like to see it add *at most* 30 damage per shot with demolition expert, like it's supposed to. Right now, my TSE Gatling gun gains more than 300 damage *just from putting on demo expert*. Something isn't working properly here. 
---
Once that's done, make shotgun pellets modified with explosive disappear after about 20 feet. IMO a big reason exploding shotguns are so ridiculous is that explosive removes damage drop-off with range.
---
What if they can loot your corpse 
---
I, too, hate vegetables that float in the air :)
---
They spawn in the world? Which locations if you dont mind sharing, first I hear of this, I had only seen those helmets in the atom shop datamine
---
Sometimes you’re shy at least me of showing that I have an issue with having different costumes on me lol.
---
Joking the issue with trade is that I’m trading to give something for free I’m not trying to charge not even one camp.
---
I’m the wasteland giver ;);)
---
You can sell junk before you scrap it.  Once you scrap it, the stuff that can be bulked must be bulked before sold.  Stuff that can't be bulked can just be sold.
---
"There are about 7... mole rats... in the gas station. We need to kill them all. Please kill them for us do that we can... bomb the site from orbit, just to... make sure they are dead."
---
So far I haven’t found ANY of the speed effects available stacking up. Gun runner, speed demon, squad maneuvers, emergency protocols all seem mutually exclusive as best as I can tell (I know for sure gun runner and speed demon don’t stack, I’ve stopwatched them; so far it’s just “feeling” for the other ones)
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
btw, there are a couple of recently deceased vault dwellers scattered throughout the land, one at Harpers Ferry, and another ease of Sons of Dane, I think they are all from 96
---
Nobody has noticed that in the patch that JUST came out, utilizing a Dense modded chest piece and Fireproof made the explosive damage negligible.  Beth allowed the public 0 time to realize the potential here and actually strategize before announcing a bow to all the non-strategic players crying foul.  With the mod and perk listed above, the dmg received from a tse is nerfed to ONLY ballistic damage.  If your build cant handle one shot from just a TS without explosive, your build sucks.  They already nerfed TSE Dps but didnt even let the dust settle before they went for broke on it.  "Yay we won its EASY again!"  What needed to be nerfed was Bobblehead stacking.  If you couldn't stack Chems, not being able to stack Bobbleheads should have been a no-brainer.  
---
You're not alone and a "co-op only" would be nice.
---
I have a ts gat but I feel like the accuracy isn't accurate I get most my shots on 
---
That it is separate is really bad, only one of the options survives. Fortnite killed it's PvE this way.
---
&gt;Complete removal is a lazy fix I think. Explosive is a cool dynamic. Reworking the legendary to have better synergy with an actual explosives load out not just focused around the weapon would be best.
---
Eh, if I didn't want visitors I wouldn't have made a huge supply base outside Flatwoods.
---
Be a buddy and collect those piles people !!! lol 
---
That doesn't make any sense though. Griefers WANT to grief carebears... they don't want a fair fight on an open PVP server.  xD
---
And I mean, how do you even grief in this game? It's impossible, short of using exploits.  
---
Its a concept I literally just invented which means Player versus Queen.
---
I invented it because TSE has been a problem with Queen/legendary battles and people running in and one-shotting enemies which would otherwise take several players to work together to take down.
---
Any help would be great. I plan on taking the information and posting it on the fallout wiki.
---
I have this same issue you are having. Tamed a sloth that never showed up and a toad that died. Tried the fixes you've tried. 
---
What if.. *Hear me out*.. **What if we make the other weapon prefixes have meaningful contributions to the game than to nerf the only combination that is the min/maxers choice**?  
---
I vendor or drop anything that isn't a very selective set of prefixs because their weight or value is trivial in comparison.  
---
There is a tier list of prefix choices, it's not our fault that most of them are trash in comparison to other options.  Make the trash better, please?
---
Want me to care about hunters/zealot offer me something to offset having to carry it.  Mutants is 10% everything and troubleshooter is 30% to some things.  Carry a wep for each archetype, you say? Nah.  Plan ahead and bring a wep for the encounter? Nah.  
---
I could argue that quad explosive is just as good or better for some wep types.  But the only reason I keep my zealots combat shotgun is the explosive minor.  The only reason I carry my troubleshooter's sledge is the 40% swing speed.  
---
We have a breadth of options in the bargain bin of loot.  No wonder why the only options people want are the ones that apply to all enemy types.
---
They are introducing a pvp server to my knowledge , but they aren't removing pvp from the normal mode. Also none of these ppl are going to do that and I certainly wouldn't want to do that again. I like that there is a chance of pvp, I don't want there to be a WAY higher risk of getting constantly attacked because I'm on a 'pvp' server. I run around in pacifist mode.  Have never had any of the problems you guys are complaining about.  
---
His math is incorrect. It’s PLUS 25%. So it’s a 75% decrease, so if you had a gun that did 200 damage without any effects, it would do 250 after patch 5. But right now, it would do 400 damage.
---
I agree with you man, its your fault you are getting killed if you have a bounty.
---
Srsly man. Client side inventory was like, 2 decades ago. Back when diablo 1 was a thing.
---
Considering the accuracy trade off, I think it's reasonably balanced already. Only thing that makes sense as a "nerf" to me, is to make them cost 2 rounds per shot as well.
---
I want to see the reactions when people realize it's just a Battle Royal =P
---
Popular/things and unbalanced are two different things. Do you enjoy walking around clicking on people and enemies and watching them disappear? If so then I'm sure you don't want to lose the TSE shotguns. Why would devs waste time buffing EVERYTHING when they can nerf the offensive weapons? 
---
With the hit to accuracy on two-shot I don't see myself favoring it over anything else if it's at 1.25%
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I’ll do what I want, Mom.
---
I think that moving around modifiers in the the tiers may result in unbalance with other weapons. Why not just disable TSE drops. They just cant spawn together. That seems easier to me. 
---
So you've been playing something like 13 hours a day, every single day, for 2 months straight?  
---
Prolly not something you want to admit in public. 
---
I use shotgun with enforcer to make the scorchbeasts land, then swap to melee. In my experience, the shotgun basically does little to no damage when its airborne, but even peppering it with enforcer on does seem to make it land quicker.
---
On the ground I can do decent damage with a shotgun, but I decided to use melee to conserve ammo (I was burning through shells).
---
You dropped this \

In addition to all of the strength perks you can max out Makeshift Warrior for mods and Weapon Artisan for increased condition and weapon damage. 
---
Don’t forget AWOL, that’s the main event I look for. You have a chance at lvl 52 legendaries during the 3 waves but the last robot is always a 3* lvl 52 gutsy. 
---
Is this not already a thing in the sbq fight? ( to a degree)
---
The two shot and explosive nerf will fix the weapons, but bobble heads will still be a pain.
---
Thats exactly what it is so maybe tell your teammates to stop engaging with someone who you guys cant kill or fast travel somewhere else after you've been killed so you dont lose anymore caps also your damage output doesn't increase the higher the level you get i think after level 50 and I've been killed by many players 50 and above and I'm in the 200's so if u cant kill a level 100 at level 85 maybe your guns suck or you do
---
Honestly I want there to be strictly pvp servers. Also among other things there should be actual matchmaking for whatever type of play style you want. Want to play aggressively pvp. What about together then co-op. So on and so forth.
---
Father Elijah and his Holograms would like a word. Those fuckers are more annoying than any Cazador I swear.

Good bot
---
Fight club
---
Thanks for clearing that up for me finally. Was unsure about it for a long time. 
---
One violent night is probaly one the worse events solo the legendary is nice sometimes but not worth the hassle solo imo 
---
I'd be impressed if you made an actual octagon with the way things snap, but go for it. It seems like a cool idea
---
It's amusing since the BoS thunder event was done logically.
---
Well you dont have the *right* to avoid things that arent fun for you. I mean, what about people who get pissed when they dont win? Do they have the right to avoid things that arent fun?
---
That said, you experience is a good reason I hate the slap system
---
There's a bounty hunter club on Xbox 
---
Second that. I’ve had that happen a few times.  Even sit there and wait for them to come back, so no one steals their stuff while they respawn. I’m thinking about just taking their junk, so they do have something to whinge about...
---
I steal from the rich to build for the poor. Over 100 aluminum in your junk bag and I take all. 
---
Strangely I find helping these noobs terribly boring and would like to just be an ass sometimes.
---
Noobs are often noobs for life.
---
Been awhile since they changed the vendor caps mate
---
Server hopping for events - luck of the draw. Their timers are still instanced to servers and hopping should work
---
Thanks I'm a fan of the armour too. Just missing a right arm and chest piece. So back to the grind .
---
also no TSE's legendaries they need to re eval that whole system if they are considering this.
---
Actually they changed it again and edited the article to include explosive and also say they're not taking them out of future roll chances
---
If you’re storing so much junk. You’re obviously not using it. So rethink what you keep.
---
I’m always crafting Ammo and Repairing my PA. So I know what I need. The rest is just hoarding.
---
Craft, build and repair.
---
The only things I pick up no matter what are Springs, Screws and Ballistic. Everything else depends on my current stashed amount.
---
Aren't you kinda complaining like he did but just on a different platform?
---
correct
---
I have one. They spawn at the antique shop Northwest of watoga. Someone probably found it there and sold it. The one I found was at the Eastern end of the store on a shelf. Should be safe to get. I've been wearing it a lot with the bomber jacket. Been roleplaying in my mind as a bos pilot who was shot down over WV by sbq. Wants revenge!
---
Lol, yeah, mine does 200 with zero rifle / explosive perks 
---
Blowing up bases, constantly slapping, etc
---
Thank the Gods they gave us an easy way to respect in order to deal with changes like these and the ones to come. /s
---
I'd like to be able to do a full respec. With the changes coming down the pipeline my build will need to change. Since plans aren't account based, I don't want to make another character. 
---
Even if we could only do it once a week/month or a serum that costs like 10k caps.
---
I have a quad explosive pump shotgun and it doesn't seem to do any damage to scorchbeast. I think explosive shotguns are glitched against scorchbeasts
---
Please remember the first rule. 
---
So just go to a new server? Or don’t build in common areas? 
---
Theyre working on balancing it, nerfing it heavilly. We'll see how that works out
---
I think you should quit being a smart ass.
---
Players and most monsters don't have explosive armor so Anti-Armor is a non issue.
---
Explosive probably shouldn't scale with any other affixes though.
---
In terms of the events.  
---
My primary motivation with the events after I leveled was to get items, this means that any event that was going to provide sub-par items or low level items I would just ignore.  
---
Some of the events like the setting up the golf course felt really tedious, waiting for the censor robot for 5 minutes with mobs only spawning like once a minute was pretty tedious.
---
When I've got to the endgame, it's not great when an event basically just asks me to tab out until I hear noises.  
---
Honestly, I feel there is a lot of waiting in general during the events, If we were playing a DMV event then I could understand but the events just don't seem to scale well when compared to the available firepower.  
---
What I hope we get in future events is no artificial wait periods where we wait for a timer, if someone speeds through then they should be allowed to go play more fallout rather than wait for a timer to tick down.  
---
It would be nice if we got some player choice affecting the events where one player makes the choice for everyone involved - Maybe the player who hacks the terminal gets to decide between requesting a drop cache or sounding the sirens to attract a horde of powerful enemies. More challenging options for players pushing the limit.
---
Lastly and most importantly, I think enemies should automatically be tagged for everyone nearby during an event - Nothing ruins an event quite like another playing killing the enemy so quick that you don't get any drops for the entire thing.
---
Following. 
---
Read what I wrote a little slower.
---
I have a two shot gun, with no explosive effect.
---
From Bethesda's patch notes they say its a 37.5% reduction on just the two-shot effect.
---
This is great information. I do wish Bethesda would take it one step further and make Two-Shot and Explosive mutually exclusive effects.
---
Well, technically Two Shot isn't exactly double damage like Instigating, you fire two bullets (+1 pellet for shotgun) and each got damage reduced by enemy resistances and one of the bullets could miss the target or so I believe, but I admit currently other legendary effects feel not worth compared to Two Shot.
---
I wonder what they mean with Two Shot damage bonus reduced to 20%. Will each bullet deal 60% damage or just the additional one will be 20% of base damage.
---
Just disable legendary drops with both Two Shot and Explosve. Easy fix
---
I’d buy that piperifle
---
You dont have to rebuild.. switch servers..
---
I think the main point is that pvp shouldn’t be like: the first who hits, wins
---
With the huge nerf to two shot and explosive weapons coming, how are we gonna kill the scorch beast qween? There basically required to even put a dent in her health.
---
I've never placed any so I can't. Sorry
---
Really the only thing you missed is that "the bonus from two-shot" is reduced by 75% where you said "two shot weapons will do" 75% less.  It shouldn't affect the base damage, just the bonus damage.
---
Honestly, if they want full loot there are other games. This game would need a revamp to have full loot. 
---
You can set the price to 0 in trade...
---
Dude, I meant it was me who posted the links lol
---
Cranberry Relish is all you ever need my friend :)  +10% XP for 1 hour.
---
I agree completely. There will be further balance changes for sure, they really didn't put much thought into that side of things
---
agree
---
No one is on the right topic here (UNIQUE guns). There aren’t many. Perfect storm is it. Why? 10mm smg is decent on its own, but the fiery legendary on an SMG is basically pointless. 
---
&gt;similar odds of finding wooden **left** leg armor
---
Ftfy
---
Not really.  There are certain events I'll do repeatedly.  Census Violence, Uranium Fever, Distant Thunder, any quick Horde mission, etc.
---
If they made it a rare one (like it only spawns at 1/3 the rate of other missions) and hard as heck, but gave good rewards.........I'd do that one every single time it came up.
---
No it wouldn't because there would be no gain in attacking other heavily armed groups , that give literally no reward ever for beating them.  All you would be doing is wrecking your armor and losing ammo. It's not fair and I don't do it nor am I interested in doing it but I think that if ppl want to attack 'plebs' they should be allowed with the risk of becoming wanted as a penalty. 
---
 I come from an eve background and I think this came could benefit from a similar model, making the starter area a non pvp zone with much harsher penalties for attacking ppl such as high level npc get dropped on you and you die if you aggressive ppl in high second areas 
---
Me neither, no legendaries, let alone a TS one :/  
---
I actually checked before posting and I believe you can add silencer to a gauss rifle, some dudes were talking about where they found one on reddit. Silencers are really cool, I try to sneak occasionally even though I'm in PA all the time but getting sneak multipliers is a huge game changer.
---
I just give the ammo away. I'm on PS4 so no need to waste caps. DM me. 
---
My my you really are that clueless.
---
Thanks man. 
---
U beat me to saying it
---
&gt; I can pull 2 or 3 lvl 50 scorched and kite them around
---
I am level 35, and this is what I do. Sniper, so I legshot 2 or 3, then lead them on a merry chase away from the DPS folks. It takes a while to kill them, but people give me thumbs up so I assume it is appreciated.
---
Ok, let me put this another way, I missed the mark.
---
You're talking about stackable bonuses, dude. My beef isn't with people being able to reach or surpass +100% damage, my issue is with a SINGLE bonus giving +100% damage, hence 'nothing should be able to give +100% bonus'.
---
If someone wants to spend 10 levels of strength increases and various buffs or other legendary affixes to get +100% damage, power to them. That's not an imbalance, that's called \~progression\~. xD
---
All they probably have to do is get rid of the damage boost from STR to balance it.  I'd greatly prefer they give Stat boosts for ranged damage though  (i.e. PER for rifles, AGI pistols).
---
Finished! It’s my first time drawing one, hope you enjoy.
---
This game is no Fortnite.  You don't have to worry about people flocking to Pvp.  I've played since beta and had two people attack me, roughly 45 seconds of my fallout experience.  
---
Dont step on a fisser
---
Yes, stack them all for much damage
---
I could've been doing stuff instead of guarding ammo presses the whole time. Thanks lmao.
---
So you destroy a low-level base and if, miraculously during this 10 seconds it takes you to do it - you expect them to wait around - so you'll fix it?  At what point are you assuming you aren't a griefing dickhead?
---
It’s so annoying how little stuff there is in 76 compared to 4. I loved the settlement feature in 4 but the camp system really makes me sad.
---
They said it is an isolated mode you choose from the menu, so it shouldn't have any effect on the existing game modes.
---
I don't see a problem.
---
Pretty sure this is not the case.  Certain mods seem to have a much higher chance of dropping.
---
But hey if you've extracted the odds from the game files or similar please educate me :)
---
Yeah I can’t really kill anything with a lead pipe in 5 hits though? I’m fine with the tse nerf but my main focus was that the rng in this game is abysmal. Multiple nuke farms and the best I’ve gotten is a two star switchblade. Never even seen a 2 or 3 star gun besides my tse, and armor is a joke. Would love for a perk to just slightly increase legendary drop chance .
---
I think you provide sound advice so Im not speaking specifically about you, but I feel like this sort of guides usually attracts that sort of mentality from people and ends up fostering the behaviour in turn. I want people to show up wet around the ears sometimes and still be able to be included and have fun without being judged for it.
---
Yeah players should not receive the same dmg as monsters. Idk seems like they are focusing on pvp in the laziest was possible. Even then a good death claw build can one hit a player with ease. 
---
I'm still only a few levels away before Starched Genes becomes available. I'm walking on eggshells, trying not to get too many rads
---
Incisor tenderizer bloodymess barbarian and don't forget Chen's and mutations 
---
That does make sense but even in pve they need a slight nerf. It's no fun when I can kill a glowing deathclaw or mirelurk queen in 1 shot
---
nope they clarified that they are just nerfing, you can still find them.
---
Incisor and Martial Artist are good too
---
75% armor ignored | faster swing speed, lighter weapons
---
I agree 2shot should remain as it gives incentive for higher levels .. the explosive trait if any should be the one removed, it allows stacking perks/bobbleheads and mags which make balancing that much harder for them. With an explosive rifle they get added damage with both sets of perks + bobbleheads and mags that can stack .. where leaving 2shot would only give an extra buff to their current layout, strengthening their build. It just feels like this is gonna lead down a road where they will eventually will nerf explosive damage stacking or reducing the perk amount per card. If they detach explosives from weapons(rifles/pistols) etc they can down the road could eventually make it a viable alt. to ammo/melee builds .. 
---
Crap i shouldn't have gotten your names mixed up sorry!  Yeah F that guy.. thanks for posting the links!

Issue: last night at roughly 2 a.m. i bought a two shot dragon from another player, and ended up lobby hopping so i can try to get a specific plan from a vendor in watoga, something i frequently do. I load in from the main menu and see the loading screens. After a little waiting the screen goes black with the little loading icon in the bottom right corner, only for the screen to freeze and not allow to do anything. I closed the game and reloaded my character to no avail. I then tried loading a separate character, and it loads. Thinking it was just a server issue that coincidentally got fixed i tried my other character 2 more times before giving and going to bed. I just tried logging on with my preferred character, and ran into the same exact problem. Hes a level 83ish, so if i cant access my character thats a lot of time wasted. 
---
Look, the original topic of my thread was about Bethesda cracking down on dupers. Believe it, or don't believe it, I don't care. But don't act like it's something I just made up.   It doesn't even come from me. This is something that has been written about elsewhere.  Example here. https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-players-are-punishing-people-they-suspect-of-1831775419
---
It's a joke. Like "How to make it rain: Wash your car"
---
Ive got a pilots helmet (think its called the flight helm).

Looted it from somewhere a couple of weeks back, can't remy where but it defo didn't come out of no dev room.

---
I guess it depends on the circumstance.
---
For me in PA, it's not terrible. Outside of PA though...
---
One time I was frantically running towards a bridge I'd just passed a short while back hoping I'd make it so I had cover to then get into my PA. Had a frantic fight with some bloodbugs and a few ferals I'd attracted in the process before getting on my PA. 
---
By that time the Scorchbeast flew away.
---
I've yet to take one down solo.
---
They need to abandon this two-shot nerf. Explosive is fine. 
---
Sorry, I guess I need to clarify that "The Mountain That Strides" Grafton monster would totally be a solitary raid boss (with a massive health pool as it's essentially a flesh hulk). I'm surprised by how it only ever seems to appear in two specific areas and usually at a low level. :C
---
I recall someone mentioning they should implement a PTR to test patches before releasing them proper and I think that would be a neat idea especially for trying out wild new ideas that would need more feedback from actual players but without releasing them into the game fully. 
---
Just leave anti armour alone and I’m happy
---
It's not much different than getting charged for purchasing stolen property. There's a certain degree of onus on a player because a rational person would question how a person would have so much of X thing when they are hard to come by. 
---
"These 50 bobbleheads just fell off the back of a truck. Scouts honor!"
---
I agree! It would have been nice to have more plans of these items in the bunker. I especially would love a pre-war condition version of the Nuka-Cola machine but honestly just more stuff would have been cool, especially because of the trek to get the key in the first place. 
---
Fine but give people that want to build another way the even playing field to be competitive 
---
I want to preface with the fact that I do not care either way.
---
However, in regards to PvP, these guns do effect other people's playing experiences. The guns were better than anything by a wide margin. 
---
It isn't a bad thing that they are putting these weapons in check. They needed balancing. One shotting everything just leads to an unexciting gameplay experience.
---
Yeah those are the most rewarding.  They need to address how uncontrollable and common it is for someone to come in and 1-shot the legendary.  If that's all you go there for, it can be rewarding but often isn't.  I think that happens more often that fast traveling and finding the event is already over.
---
Also, I put up a post talking about how to get most of these, should be able to find it after scrolling a little ways down my profile 👍
---
Impressive technical trick aside (and it does have an impressive effect) that's one good looking shack, my friend.  
---
Just use the attic for sparring/fight club activities!
---
Stw and br are drastically different to each other there whole different game modes this is just a server with pvp restrictions off 
---
Yeah especially that event. If you're doing that one solo or with idiots who can't find the markers you end up spending a bunch of caps just to fast travel between places to get the stuff done in time and the rewards aren't enough as is.
---
Not that I don't believe you, but where are you getting this? I'm genuinely interested.
---
With these types of nerfs coming, we could really use a respec option.  Make it 2k per respec if you must, but otherwise people will have to spend 20 levels redoing builds.
---
Your weapon got nerfed for a reason. It doesn't take skill to shoot the ground with just one bullet and decimate a circle of 20 feet around where you shot. It's trash and I'm glad the op trash weapon got a nerf. Suck it up. 
---
why are level 25 able to get the strongest weapons 
---
ThAts behind the ranger station. Didn't find mine there though
---
ah I have found the toxic community people are talking about. Forgive my attempt to defend myself and clarify my meaning in a polite manner oh great and mighty troll
---
I have come across only one (I'm level 48). It was right outside of one of the bunkers. It made a bunch of weird noises and then the music got all intense... then it was gone :(
---
&gt; I have a legendary lever action rifle that has 250 damage resistance when reloading, and 20 percent faster reloading,
---
I love lever action. That would be a great one.
---

Ironic considering lots of you are using the “TSE Worshippers” scapegoat on people debating against you. Melee doesn’t need a nerf because the damage is where it should be. Not only would you have to empty loads of ammo to kill anything, you have to smack things a long time to kill them. Nobody wants to shoot or smack a standard enemy for minutes on end to kill it
---
Melee where it’s at is decent without perks, great with perks. Ranged weapons are horrible without perks, average with perks. That’s the issue. They need a buff toward ranged combat with this nerf so you don’t waste bucket loads of ammo trying to kill a standard mob or be forced into melee combat because that’s the only way to kill effectively.
---
I was thinking more of a 50 cap entry and the winner gets 90% of the pot and the house gets the other 10 for organizing and supplying the arena
---
I mean your right, I guess I had been caught up in trying to help and not researched all that much. Was under the assumption duping had for the most part been dealt with.
---
Oh ok that makes sense
---
Turn on passive and your gun will not harm other players or structures - it also keeps things friendly at farming areas or while killing the queen so you are not accidentally going into PvP with the other players.
---
False dichotomy.
---
I like playing _with_ others. And I occasionally like playing against others on a level playing field (player skill not withstanding).
---
I don't like being treated like a prey species by exploit-happy griefers.
---
Spoilsports spoil sports.
---
It would be nice if the 1-2% of people that care about PvP flocked to the pvp servers, but they will get board of having to play the same type of people after a couple days and go back to griefing.
---
'Inside the Vault' solicited feedback. 
---
It just doesn't make much sense to carry around multiple weapons and use up valuable encumbrance for a mere +5% damage against a single enemy type.
---
This is the last place I expected someone to reference Leftover Crack.
---
Legend!
---
It can't die as it was never alive in the first place let's be honest here br is the reason people probaly know about the pve 
---
I would rather them make the wood armor better. I use wood armor for the shrouded + sneak speed effect. Obviously, I play a stealth/unarmed character. Speed + sneak attack + stealth = not much need for defense, not to mention the super low weight. With the exception of my combat chest piece, through perks and legendary effects, my defense is 430/290, and it could go much higher with the right pieces. So keep selling it to vendors (feel free to drop them!), I appreciate it.
---
Or, you know... One that shoots.
---
He basically saying that part of this community are acting like children who got a toy taken away from them.  And OPs kind of right.
---
I see what you mean, and I fully understand I'm not entitled to anything. I just feel like that when you are a high level (personally level 185), you kind of deserve to be able to do that kind of damage.
---
I know it takes some of the challenge away, and 1-shotting a mirelurk queen was never what I wanted. I just wanted the enemies to go down with headshots, and not tank 10 of them.
---
Yeah like the current state of a game like destiny when it comes to weapon nerfing it's so stupid. Why can't we just have two separate values one for PvP and the other for PvE? Like come on it'd make people happy that they can use their guns like normal but be balanced when in PvP.
---
People no-life Bethesda games, it's the kind of player they draw in
---
RNGesus is not always kind.
---
I had the same issue finding Calibrated Shocks for the T-60. I know they spawn at the BoS Watoga vendor and the train station there, but could never find them and server hopped quite a bit trying.
---
I was busy on a conference call today and walked to Watoga yesterday and figured I could do a bit of mindless server hopping while distracted. In a half hour I had found four T-60 calibrated Shocks AND the T-45 Jetpack plan as well as a couple other T-60 mods I figured I'd grab.
---
So don't give up, I feel your pain but they will show up.
---
Had my first experience of some asshole shooting up me and my C.A.M.P about an hour ago. I was in the middle of building it when he came along all happy and waving hi, then he shot me in the face :(
---
I just logged off because fuck him.
---
Was it ever confirmed that killing the scorched that are spawned causes the SBQ to land?
---
He is speaking the language of the gods
---
In my opinion if these guns were that big of an issue in pvp then they should buff the dense mod for armors which makes it more resistant to explosives.
---
which is what I said 
---
I'm hype for a real pvp mode honestly 
---
&gt; Have never had any of the problems you guys are complaining about.
---
Count yourself fortunate.  I personally have had several bad experiences with griefers and camps being destroyed.  I set up near flatwoods with plenty of food and cooking stations and water purifiers for low level players.  Camp is so routinely destroyed by other players, not mobs, that I eventually ran out of scrap to repair it.  I don't even use it anymore for anything other than a fast travel point.  Would have liked to been able to use that feature, but I guess it's not practical.  
---
Thanks for your perspective on this, I enjoyed the discussion.
---
Either you're done or there's a next time.
---
Even if they cant justify it they will do. Personally i am against how they handled this if you are on Xbox you no longer can log in making your digital copy worthless or your physical copy a paperweight. My assumption from talking to different players something in the update triggers when you have a certain amount of items or certain items.
---
The explosive is the issue it seems. Quad just increases the ammo count.
---
You don't have to make a new camp. Just switch serves. It's what I do. 
---
Is that right? I don't know, ...all I know is that sometimes I've been playing, while on Pacifist because I ONLY and EXCLUSIVELY play on Pacifist,....and someone attacks me, I do nothing, and then they end up murdering me. And I'm left confused as to why. I wish I would have recorded those times, to provide proof. 
---
Switched 2 servers and they connected me 2 times in a server with another camp in the same location. They had one job :c 
---
Thanks for the heads up, il maybe get into prime receivers at a later date if they make the ammo cheaper to craft or buff the extra scorched damage 👍
---
The dumb thing is crafting a diluted stimpak uses super stimpaks if you dont have regular ones
---
Well I didn't know what the response to the post would be before I posted it. I am saddened that people disagree with me but it is their right. Bethesda should give the community what they want even if it causes me pain. I guess I need to look into rebuilding my character.
---
I want a none broken warehouse windows and hole filled walls 
---
I don't understand the want for hordes of enemies to die in a single shot. Or why people want mobs to die so quickly and effortlessly. For me I want enemies to be tough to kill. I want it to be challenging even up to max level. That being said if I'm level 50+ a level 6 enemy should be a cake walk (which it already is) but enemies that are near my level should present some challenge.
---
For context I have never used TSE weapons and I'm super happy they are getting the Nerf. Also I think their need to be harder enemies because I'm level 60 and I can easily take down everything BUT the SBQ by myself within 10-20 shots (Crit shotgunner build)
---
That's exactly what I'm saying. 
---
Did you build in whitesprings or something? Ive never had it happen more than twice ever
---
Why another repost of the Nov 27th one? That's the third time...

....Does this mean I'll stop accidentally blowing myself up?
---
Because it still can be annoying when someone is trying to kill monsters and some douchebag decides to wipe the whole area out without you getting a kill.
---
A friend of mine soloed the queen one night with a stealth min-max build. Even when he left the adds alone, she still landed despite her not knowing where he was. I don’t think there just one landing mechanic
---
I'm playing on PC and I have an issue with the way the "Chemist" and "Super Duper" perk cards interact. They both say double results so if I'm making a stimpack and I get the benefit of both perks I should get four stimpacks but it only gives you three. It's ok if they want to keep the mechanics of this working as they are but the text of the perk cards needs to reflect the ACTUAL effect. The description for super duper currently reads "When you craft anything, there is a __% chance you'll get double results!" so there's really no reason it shouldn't give four stimpacks in this scenario but if it read "When you craft anything, there is a __% chance you'll get an extra crafted item!" Then that would at least be accurate to how it currently works.
---
You must be a complete non-PVPer if you think that's griefing haha (and I don't mean that in a dickish way or anything, it's just so far from what actual griefing in PVP is). 
---
Griefing is making someone's life hell, making them want to log out and stop playing generally. Corpse camping, stealing everything they own, that kind of stuff. You can't do that in 76. 
---
Your base is blown up? Single click with a low resource cost repairs the whole thing, done. Don't even need to defend. Someone is constantly slapping you? Single click fast travel or server swap, done. Don't need to see that person again.
---
While I'm sure there are ways people can be an ass, that's not really about the game's PVP mechanics. Someone who wants to be a dick in this game would cause more damage simply by following people around stealing all the environment loot or killing their mobs before they can tag for XP, so it's actually much easier to PVE grief than to PVP grief. xD  
---
Lol, I ran a Psychotic Chef character up until I started regularly using Power Armor, its really fun to mess with people like that. I used a hunting rifle, rolling pin, and cultist blade until level 45, and the Cannibal perk always makes it a little better of course ;)
---
I've never had molerats burrow into my base. I had a big group come yesterday and they burrowed next to my base and that's it. But then again I have floors.
---
Only crying ive seen yet is this thread.
---
I normally keep passive on when farming but I thought I’d help this dude out and kill him and watch over his stuff. Instead of someone else. 
---
Gimmie a ghoul whale already goddamnit 
---
It would be nice if Rose didn't radio spam me *every single time* I logged onto a server.
---
I agree with this. Other players don't really attack CAMPS so what's the point?
---
I play a solo crit build. I carry 5 two-shot weapons on me, all of them are legitimate drops and none of them have the explosive prefix on them. This nerf basically just screwed my glass-canon build, and wasted all my time farming for those weapons.
---
For what it's worth, I just read the post that people are referring to that purportedly disproves the various theories (including the one I personally believe and referenced). OP does a great job documenting w/ pictures and video but his results seem to be at odds with my, and many others, experience with camp budget space relating to item crafting at increasingly higher levels. His experimenting shows it doesn't increase in any way at any level but it's possible his results were due to a bug, as MUCH anecdotal evidence points the other way.
---
That's fun for some people. Some people just want to breeze through the game after they have done all the leveling, getting beaten up by Scorchbeasts, Scorched, Supermutants, etc. grinding to maximize their build and gear. When you get to that point when you have everything min/maxed and you can one shot everything, for some people that is when they feel like the hero. Like Superman/Supergirl. For some people that is what they play RPGs for. To get the best gear and build the most powerful character. I know you can probably still do that without the TSE as they are but whatever. I personally want to one shot everything. And if I don't then I simply use a weaker fun weapon, and remove some perk cards to increase the challenge.
---
It worked just fine. 
---
Is it good?
---
I have a two-shot black powder pistol and a two-shot explosive shot black powder rifle (my only TSE). My go-to weapons are a two-shot handmade and a two-shot gatling. Yeah, this patch will hurt for sure.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if they were ways to cut down the grind, e.g. rerolling a single trait, 'gambling' like Diablo, salvaging/merging/crafting for legendaries, focusing your drops, etc. Just *something*.
---
300+ unique downloads of ReShade mod and even 1400+ on the Ultrawide mod.  If all those got banned, there would be a lot bigger backlash on Reddit than the few threads there've been about bans.
---
The only "truth" is that the people who got banned for using Cheat Engine were also using ReShade and/or the Ultrawide mod and then blamed it on the mods when in reality the only reason they got banned was for using CE.
---
Lots of legit users using these mods and more haven't been banned.
---
I just want to delete dupe cards I'm not using 
---
Yes! I'm just perking into it now and even 1 pt has saved me
---
This is great. Can you tell us max cap discount and carry weight too? Even if you can't we all appreciate you testing this
---
I’m skeptical he didn’t just make up a ‘girlfriend’ to get sympathy like a few of the story posts on the front page have gotten.
---
He’s the one who got banned most likely. 
---
The thing I'd like most from FO4 would be preston garvey... as the only NPC we can repeatedly kill.
---
How is it an even playing field when TS and E are the ONLY things in this entire game that give such a huge bonus from a single source? 
---
This is why these items are imbalanced and need to be nerfed. They make no sense in the context of the game, and frankly, as I wrote before, are idiotic things from a design perspective. 
---
They make Scorchbeasts seem friendly...
---
Thanks for the nightmares im inevitably going to experience tonight. 
---
I fixed this by server hopping, and upon reentry my budget was fixed.
---
How are we gonna kill the qween after these nerfs? As is your basically required to have a tse explosive weapon to even chip her. 
---
Mr. gutsys and super mutant warlords are gonna be a pain in the ass again too...
---
Nuke zones are the harshest environment I have found. So if you can figure out how to keep your rads under control in them you dont need power armor.
---
You've obviously never played a dead/dying game. Been playing Fornite STW for over a year and never had trouble finding people to play with. And yes, a lot of people (myself included) wouldn't have heard of it if it wasn't for BR; so BR being added did the opposite of what OP is implying.
---
Think about it , you put your camp in a super populated area , in plain view  and you're surprised that ppl are attacking it ?  I honestly thought the only ppl who did that were the ones actively baiting players to attack their base to pvp. 
---
My base has never been attacked . Why? I put it at the edge of the map past deathclaw island , past the super mutant lumber mill, tucked away near the river . Plenty of food, wood, and a decent enough spot to farm ammo. 
---
Your heart is in the right place,  if not your camp my friend ;)
---
My first experience with others was claiming a workshop, and immediately having people fast travel nearby and coming and murdering me. :(
---
I wish I could up vote you more than once. A mini nuke should kill most things in 1-2 shots 5 -7 is 25-35 weight worth of ammo to kill one guy and that is way too much.
---
And what about those without TSE? 
---
I'm ok with dis
---
A Nerf for TSE! The qweens already a pain as it is. We need strong weapons to be able to take her out.
---
I agree the pvp sucks being able to 1 hit kill but Every game needs to have end game weapons. TSE would still have been a rare end game weapon if it wasent for dupers giving them out like candy.
---
Now that dup is fixed they should start adding higher tier weapons that are stronger then TSE but a do low damage vs players.
---
Right?! I bet these guys bought it from a duper with real money, then wanted to be that asshat that goes around kill stealing and one shotting everything so they can get all the loot and XP to themselves. Hell the terror I and others have endured from them running around shooting me while in passive and taking my caps have been worth the salt to see today. Some people would even shoot me repeatedly with them so the constant explosions would send my game to a crash. They abused the weapon instead of using it responsibly. So they got what is happening to them. I'm literally fucking Living for today.
---
Well *i* have 72752 so nerr
---
They're still gonna be broken af
---
Mine is set up by Charleston Station. Had a couple of jack ass encounters but for the most part everyone has been cool. Its nice to go buy/sell a pile of stuff then be able to go to a full crafting building and build/fix whatever you want.
---
PA just makes the game easier. I too spend a ton of time out of PA but my build is gearing more toward it and heavy weapons.
---
Welcome home mat doesnt work...
---
I'm not sure that's exactly a bad thing. Are you seeing primarily one star legendary items dropping from these creatures? That's what I always see and I think the point is that if you want to find a really awesome 3+ star item you have to really get into the grind and mow through waves and waves of the legendaries before you'll come across something really good.
---
&gt; Granted, it depends on the gun thanks to other bugs, but assuming they ever fix those bugs, it’ll be good in the same way on basically every gun.
---
This is where it gets really difficult to take people who are worried about "TSE nerf" seriously. You haven't lived until you've unlocked the Pistol challenge using a Two-Shot Exploding Gatling with Martial Artist equipped. The cascade of intentional or unintentional mechanics interacting outright invalidates every other weapon (and you get free atoms).
---
The examples that you've given about Mutant's, Zealot's, Ghoul's, etc are completely valid. Why use any of that if Two-Shot is guaranteed to be effective on everything? There's an entire meta for being mutated that have an effect on armor, weapons, perks. Another entire meta around doing additional damage to scorched (the mechanic appears early in the game). There's an entire class of Ultracite weapons that have no reason to even exist.
---
that's exactly why I feel like the playtime update was a commentary on the community :P
---
I did the scorch queen so many times that I was looking at my weight and I had 52 super stimpaks. They're just useless when you have the 45% extra healing for stimpaks unless you really want to fight like a god being invincible for like 5 seconds of overhealing
---
So, back around November, my brother bought me this game and while it was ok, I didn't love it the way I loved NV and 4. But I persisted, and one day I'm at White Springs and I'm shooting some mobs (and dying) when a random bloated one drops a double barrel with an explosive mod. Only level 25, i thought it might not be that good and persisted with my rifles build.
---
Once I started using the shotgun though, the game changed for me. It became way more fun. No more tedium through breaking my guns in the middle of the fight, no more running out of ammo. I found a weapon that I loved.
---
I'm worried about this change though. I changed my build to move to shotguns and I dont have enough perk cards to swap out to a new build. And due to the stash limitations, I've thrown many other weapons away leaving me with only what I can carry. This nerf may actually mean that I have to start from scratch in some way, and it may just lead me to quit.
---
I know explosives are a problem for PvP but surely there's a specific solution without affecting PVE. 
---
All I'm saying is if they ban me for having over 1,300 stimpaks which I've obtained legitimately through searching and diluting all the time I'm going to be pissed 
---
Agreed 100%.
---
This and the fusion core login bug fix are quite disappointing.  They're going to take some enjoyment of the game away for me.
---
This is one of the drawbacks of the game being online only.  Fun stuff gets removed because of the way people are.  Ugh.  
---
No kidding. They’re useless half the time!
---
honestly I'd love more events like this - I felt it was so cool when I suddenly had the items in my backpack and went over and handed the people who had done it some stims and ammo and remember when I actually saw the event I'd go over and help just to make sure everyone got some items 
---
I'd love to see more community oriented events that let people do something that gave everyone something in the world so people who are co op style people can show everyone hey I'm not some crazed murder hobo worshiping a bronze statue of a lion named Reginald (my neighbor) I'm actually wanting to team with people and survive this wasteland together 
---
Need to modify that thing. Put some spikes on it and raise the damage. 
---
Craftable respec serum for player vending🤗
---
I have a hard time believing that. One thing to remember is when people get banned for doing stupid and shady things, they tend to lie about it in an effort to gain sympathy, drive hate towards those who they feel wronged them, and otherwise cloud the views of the action taken. 
---
so you've already got your next FOTM lined up? Have you prewritten a post where you cry about them rebalancing that one too?
---
That's part of it for sure. This game's PVP is not well designed at all. It's just basic Fallout combat with pretty much zero PVP mechanics or incentives, short of the mechanics that actively trivialize PVP like slap dueling.
---
A bunch of PVPers running around this game for no greater thrill than Fallout's gunplay and collecting bounties on each other? Yeaaaa... sounds boring as hell, haha. xD
---
There are ways that you sign up for pvp without knowing most often it's when you take control of a workshop, it warns you but we never read it and I'm sure there are other methods. Take full advantage of the record functions, the sooner exploits can be isolated and presented to beth, the sooner it can be addressed.
---
They barely even bother. I have mongrels that will walk right up past the turret minimum range without it even firing lol
---
How are you in the air in the first place? If you stay on the ground you wouldn't get killed in the air so much.
---
*Noice.*
---
With people thinking it's junk now there's a higher chance we'll see it in a bag on the ground, or available to buy at the robot vendor or when player vending becomes available we might see it in a dispenser.
---
Here's hoping. the RNG gods have not been nice to me.
---
Charlie solo at lvl 40. I’m so sorry mate. It’s gunna take a looong time to get all that ammo back.
---
Yeah, 920
---
This is just a vague blanket reply where they reserve the right to do anything they want.
---
Well, prices vary depending on the original value of the item (one cap item may not change but a 200 cap item would have a big difference). But I could just set the example as a 10cap item. 
---
Carry weight also varies on the type of item, but I can list all the things that can reduce weight too, that’ll be a long one. I’ll start looking into it!
---
I have a friend and she can hit 1900 damage with her bloodied/unyielding build. It needs a nerf too. Seems like min-maxers go for bloodied melee and casuals who want it easy go for explosive guns
---
It gets better. Banned dupers are already posting that they will buy another copy of the game and create new accounts.
---
Cool, that's like paying a real world fine for misbehaving AND puts more revenue into Bethesda's pockets for future development.
---
Strange how they still want to play when two days ago they were all saying the reason they cheat is because the game is unplayable otherwise...
---
I'm not against a nerf, it just focusing on one thing leaves ranged in a sad state. More balancing is needed.  
---
Thought they already did nerf the issue (Explosive). Maybe not nerf, but allowing players to counter TSEs from a bullshit OHK weapon to manageable with Dense + Fireproof 3. Of course Dense is not available in PA, so yeah.
---
But it seems to me that this game has inherent limitations on builds. The game requires you to lug around junk for maintenance purposes.  I don't see any way around investing a significant amount in strength,  Not saying you have to get 15, but it's hard to imagine having less than 6, and even that's pushing it.  I think you probably need 9 strength minimum.  I also find it hard to imagine functioning without a hefty investment in luck to avoid running out of supplies.    It's really hard to imagine creating a build that is intelligence- based, or charisma based, or perception based.    
---
Here's the load out I use when I'm playing in 2H melle mode.
---
Notes: 
---
STR: I only really run PA in nuke zones, so I keep Barbarian active most of the time. When I jump into PA I swap it out for level 3 Pain Train
---
PER: There's not much here to benefit melee, but Glow Sight is a game changer at Whitesprings, and since most locks in the game are level 0-1 I just keep 1 level of Lockpick active for normal play. Green Thumb for double the flux.
---
END: There's not much here either, but Ghoulish and Radicool are helpful in nuke zones. If I'm with a teammate and they're sharing rad sponge I swap out radicool for Solar Powered for +1 strength
---
CHA: Lone Wanderer gets swapped for level 3 Bodyguards if I'm on a team. The other things are situational (Hard Bargain gets equipped for vendor runs, etc), but I wanted 9 points so that I could share level 3 Glow Sight, Insprational, or Bodyguards depending on team needs.
---
INT: I don't really need rank 3 First Aid, but I needed 8 points of INT in order to equip Makeshift Warrior and Weapon Artisan at the same time, so I figured I'd put those points to use when I'm not fixing/crafting shit.
---
AGI: nothing out of the ordinary here. Faster AP regen and skyrocketing damage when you start killing hordes. 
---
LCK: I have a bunch of stuff like Can Do and Woodchucker that I slap on during supply runs, but this is the battle load out. 
---

Ever tried to pour concrete in -15/20 windchill? No? Kay.

Some people’s livelihoods are seasonal. Off season I work from home, not that I need to explain myself to a keyboard warrior. It’s actually pretty fantastic to be home during the holidays with my family and not be a cranky sod trying to demoralize people over the Internet on reddit for their hobbies and something they’re passionate about, but who am I to judge?
---
Exactly. I even put up spotlights because I read that they’ll trigger the turrets when enemies approach but that is clearly not the case. 
---
I'm with this. I would much prefer separating the two mods so they cannot exist on the same weapon than gimp both so it's punishes those who have only one of those legendary effects (who aren't really the problem).
---
Nothing really changes with the proposed change. Basically the TSE would still likely be a top tier weapon so it does little to affect the duping market if that isn't taken care of in the next patch or so.
---
Nerf will make tse weapons bad so don't bother 
---
Blame the dupers for making thousands of them, not bethesda. If it was rare, this never would have happened. 
---
I don't -want- to play with these dickheads, but if I'm launching a nuke there's no way to stop pricks from one-shotting the Queen. I can't switch servers, since I'll lose ALL PROGRESS in the silo.
---
This is on Bethesda's court. Kill the bobbleheads, kill the TSE. 
---
Steadily losing faith in this game.
---
Guy asking you to shoot his face, literally only his face
---
Yes, to be fair I hadn't factored that in and was using the total damage value for my calculations.
---
If this is so, then it wouldn't be as great of a nerf as I was thinking.
---
Then again that relies on Bethesda actually doing this as you suggest and not as I suggest.
---
Mostly 1* items but yes, I have seen 2, even 3 stars from them. And I don’t think it’s normal getting 15 legendaries in 1 run.
---
I hoard teddy bears/board games/all flavors of Nuka Colas (especially Quantums...I lose my shit over Quantums.)
---
You are contributing to that, I'd say.
---
I have an endless supply of those (made out of cut cardboard) and will sell for 1 cap each.
---
Or crazy idea, make it to where people simply can’t be killed in pvp unless they CHOOSE to participate.  I don’t mind getting smoked when I get into a scuffle with another player, just makes me use some kind of strategy to get even
---
That's how mafia works.
---
On x1, I’ve got a TSE handmade that I’ll let go for 2k. 
---
Curious what your build is.
---
Im sensing some sarcasm, but ill just go ahead and say it: Fallout 3 and new vegas had a karma system. I dont remember it in 4. Im assuming the ones prior to 3 had some system, but I never played them.
---
Plays fine for me since the last patch.  Shrug.
---
Just give up and make pungi board traps
---
Not really. Fair criticism isn’t hostility. 
---
Posts like this one, make me realise how much I still need to play to fully discover everything in the game.
---
Even though I already played it for 76 hours! Thank you for showing us this list!
---
lol let one of the supposed OP melee people hit me with reactive plates on. Melee is not an issue in pvp.
---
I do sqb and whitespring in hazmat.
---
Sqb is sketchy as if she focus fires you, you're dead.
---
I'm going to retest with fireproof 3 though as that helps with sb spam
---
Yeah, weightless pieces with the shrouded mod weigh 0.0 pounds.
---
Perfect time to get them though, everyone will try to offload before the nerf so they should go in a firesale. I imagine as long as they don't change demo expert buffing explosive they will still be a pretty good weapon choice. Maybe not the best anymore, but not garbage.
---
Not a problem! There will always be something we miss, but I already can't wait for the DLC lol
---
Did that before the spotlights. But I kept walking over them, lol. 
---
So, no *Faction* PvP.
---
*sigh* I guess Faction will continue to be absolutely meaningless.
---
It maybe a your food noticed when I moved had alot of each plant in hundreds after deleted down to 5 each budget was fixed also Brahmin pen does it to..
---
Hell yeah. Bethesda has restored my faith in them in pissing you off here.
---
Ive actually seen more ppl accepting this than not accepting it. Ppl know TSE is way OP.  Rhey need to nerf explosive not TS 
---
* Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you?
---
Uranium Fever,  One Violent Night (appalachia radio needs more bluegrass), and Scorched Earth.
---
* Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?
---
Feed the People post nerf since you're only feeding yourself now. The regional horde events since the locations are spread out far too far apart to really be worthwhile, particularly if it's in a lower level area and only going to give a low level legendary from the boss (that criticism applies to most events in low level areas, legendaries should always be scaled to your level, not the mob's level; finding legendary enemies is rare enough in the first place without having to worry about getting a low level item).
---
* Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why?
---
I always play solo, but I would really like some sort of informal grouping done for all players participating, at least as far as loot is concerned. It sucks to miss out on a legendary because it was killed before you could tag it, particularly during hectic events like Scorched Earth.
---
* What types of events would you like to see in the game?
---
More endgame events, particularly more reasons to nuke someplace other than Fissure Site Prime or Whitesprings.
---
* How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?
---
Fast travel. I've had some events only start via fast travel, just being in the area didn't cause it to activate, I had to fast travel to the event marker despite being at the event marker already.
---
* How would you feel about bonuses for completing a daily or weekly event?
---
Sounds great. I'd really like to see special nuke-zone-only events at all the fissure sites on the map. A bonus for participating in all of them over the course of a week would be a great way to give players a reason to choose them over farming Glowing Ones at Whitesprings.
---
Lol don't let anyone sell you them for more than 200 caps. They are going to be worthless now.
---
I don't love playing in power armor either but I find myself in it more often than not because the benefits are too strong not to be,
---
I can pump 500dmg out of a non legendary Lever, 850 out of a TS, and 3k out of TSE lol.  I'm all for the nerf.  It's still about a +45% increase in damage for both effects.  Maybe I won't blow myself up when I accidentally clip a wall next to me or something =P.
---
I rarely even use the TSE, almost always just a TS because it's more than enough to take care almost every mob.
---
i am online rn and will most likely be for a while if you’re still interested 
---
I think most MMO's have PVP and PVE servers (or areas / Settings) - it should be standard with Fallout 76 as well.
---
OMG this so much 
---
I wish I could upvote this 1000 times.
---
Screw them , they have no balls ! They caved in to all the cries on the forums.Just let the weapons as they are and make 2 different servers , PvE and PvP. Best solution
---
Fair enough
---
There's a big difference between one shotting from 200 yards away and one shotting from 2 yards away. Even with the vats teleport, anything but a black powder gun can get multiple shots off before the melee user can sprint into melee range. Couple this with the fact that most of the high damage one punch melee builds are based around running around with under 30% hp, and it becomes even harder to make it to melee range.
---
There's a reason almost ever shooter ever makes melee one shot while most guns take multiple hits.
---
Nocturnal definitely needs a buff. As is it's a legedary effect that gives you a negative effect half of the day.
---
Its not too bad to make an alt to get it. I went at lv 15 on an alt and got it on  my first visit. Id also bet they might fix the level lock on it being sold at Harpers Ferry in the next patch.
---
I also play on the xbox one. I have issues with stability but just short of frustrating. According to a buddy of mine it's worse on the base system.
---
So tier wise xbox one X (good), xbox one S (moderate), xbox one (you're going to have issues)
---
I'm genuinely curious what version the OP is rocking. 
---
Adding options to maybe decrease some shaders and things to increase stability for older systems might be a future fix.
---
I'm only referring to the "Melee needs to nerfed now too" whining crybaby posts I keep seeing lately. 
---
Please can we get junk decorations for our camps, this was such a critical feature in fo4 to get realistic camps
---
I wonder how hard it would be to establish servers based on average levels--in this way, you opt in to a standard server or a survival server; the standard server is exactly what we have now, while the survivor server is one where the Forest Region can get nuked, where areas of effect are much greater, and where massive player factions might duke it out over the remains. 
---
they're in the game files already (and being used as decoration in a lot of places) so the assumption is that they're coming, they just aren't available yet.
---
I got it fixed now, actually (by reinstalling the whole freakin launcher and game), but I'm still salty that crap like this happens nearly every time they update
---
Thanks though lol 👍
---
Oo hell no, melee is just fine.  You need to close the gap.
---
They want to be able to kill the mobs easily because fighting them just isn't interesting. You're never going to be surprised by how you have to go about killing something because it's using interesting tactics. You're just going to have to press a button for a certain amount of time.
---
The Two Shot nerf seems like super overkill.  
---
Sure when combined Two Shot and Explosive make for ridiculous damage but the primary culprit here is the Explosive effect.  Assuming you're either smart enough to not fire at point blank range or set the right perks there are zero downsides to an Explosive weapon, it NEEDED either a nerf or the addition of an extra penalty.  But Two Shot already comes with a huge penalty to accuracy that can make even high accuracy sniper rifles unreliable at range.  Sure nerfing the damage on Two Shot is going to be a major hit to TSE weapons, but it's also going to destroy regular Two Shot weapons because that accuracy hit just isn't going to be worth it for a 25% bonus.
---
Thanks. I don't group much so I can get to about 26% I guess with the Relish, Well Rested and the event one that IO haven't currently used for XP. And I guess you get 1% per point in charisma, so 6% from charisma. Maybe I could use some other charisma boosting chems also to get a little more. Thanks for sharing though. When farming it is nice to try and get the most out of my short yet heavy grinding sessions.
---
Yes, somewhere along the lines i think Bethesda forgot that TS, explosive and in certain cases TSE, are the only way some weapons are viable, and certainly really helps with how bulletspongy every single late game enemy is.
---
Man have you missed it around lunch mtz  every post was why tse it exlp that needs a Nerf then it melee next they'll complain about the flare gun being op 
---
Theyre nerfing both, which is absolutely idiotic. Theyre forcing anyone who wants to use a ranged build to run a bloodied build now.
---
Filthy Raider 
---
fuck I died reading your comment in blackout 
---
Xbox s and also tried on one x both same amount of freezing playing on a 4k tv
---
Would be nice if they made you ignore your own traps

Did you tell him to not be a baby or don't play....or did you just come to this sub to let every other mofo know:/
---
I feel like your definition of large must be dlc size worthiness. Mayor for a day was annoyingly long
---
And since basically all of these can be done in less than 1 day, all discussion is pointless
---
Organic solution was rather long and took longer than mayor for a day for example
---
I haven't done the mistriss stuff yet cuz it seemed boring to me after I finally got inside the mansion, but at the least they only seem long because there's a ton of vague shit. And with even a bad guide of only telling/showing you where some things are, it's probably not long at all either
---
Same, but I have 2 turrets on one side, because there is a molerat spawn over there somewhere. they like to chew on my walls.
---
you can stand in place at 20% health and take no damage, it's not hard.
---
I stopped reading when you said they are removing Two Shot prefix. Just to let you know, they updated it saying that was a mistake. They aren't removing it from the loot tablem
---
Find a high level who has double plans and will sell at face value.  They can also take you round the Vendors to get more Caps if you haven't discovered them yet.
---
Jetpack plan @ Watoga station or Watoga Shopping Centre?
---
Yup, exactly. 
---
Nope, near a lake in The Mire region but the same issue happened and will happen again. I can't believe there aren't server that can avoi overlap. Locations weren't so common 
---
Can you not go back to the house and make a new one?? Has anyone tried??
---
&gt; I might go out of the way to fast travel to the Mire for an event if it's at a discount price.
---
Which unfortunately would be a balance problem they'd need to figure out if they did that.  People using events to fast travel to distant parts of the map for an event...and then ignoring the event and wandering off or traveling a second time to where they really wanted go.  Using the event as a discount flight rather than actually caring about the event.
---
Btw how tf do you get 850 out of a non legendary lever? only perks I can think of is bloody mess nerd rage ad mutation and max rifle perks?
---
That was your fault though, you know the gun is aoe and you used it to close to his base still....
---
Hey, hopefully I'm commenting in the right place but I'd really like to see more excitement in events that occur on the map of 76.
---
Look at nukes for an example of a good "event." Players all over will rally up from levels 20+ as long as they can tag along and make a good time out of it and people even become more social... but nothing else has that same outcome. Personally I believe that is because normal events often don't generate loot that is exciting for me which is a big turn off. Even if I get a plan, its always a plan I already have which is terrible because I barely have any. 
---
The solution to this I think would be to have some tougher events that arent just defending events or killing events. Maybe there's a battle between scorched and something else going on that you can interrupt that is exciting to jump into and maybe we can get plans that we don't have, especially since there are so many to get.
---
I hope this makes a change for the better in this game that I've been supporting since the stress test and I hope others can agree with me.
---
Same I made an alt got to level 15 had a friend down in watoga run me through mayor for a day. Once that was done got some caps ran between the two vendors and got plans for all of us.
---
I'm laughing especially at those ones that paid real cash to get them. 
---
Well I mean they're making those no-rules PVP servers soon so I wouldn't see this as much of a far-fetched idea. It might be more ideal really too, so that newer players can get a more watered down experience, while more experienced players get right into the thick of it. 
---
Everything is cooked well done!!
---
What armor has higher base resistances than Marine? (excluding any type of legendary armor, which includes unique armors)
---
I get that a lot.
---
That’s good..Read it all though I address things in the game that needs to be addressed as a whole.
---
I was going back and forth so can't be 100% sure as I was also on a call but I believe it was the station.
---
HOLY FUCK IS THAT WHY IM ALWAYS OVERENCUMBERD IN MY ULTRACITE SET
---
I want the lamp from a Christmas story. 
---
I stand corrected. Thank you for the update
---
One at thunder mountain same tent as the camo fatigues, two at the ranger station in the bog. One is by the chainsaw the other is in the vet room with the dead beavers. It is a possible spawn out of at least 5 helmet types including the BoS hood. More often than not it is some common hat though. 
---
My earlier comment claimed you were incorrect.
---
After another comment pointed out what you were saying in a different way, I realized what you were trying to say.
---
I still maintain that Bethesda should be rolling balance changes based upon the use that is problematic (PvP vs PvE vs PvQ)
---
I bought one, but when I pulled it out of the box, it ended up being a scorchbeast shooting sonic waves out if its ass. Vendor bot already told me No Refunds, so I guess im stuck with it
---
Please if the game crashes from people shooting around you the game is broken not the gun plus the bobble issues you know exploits again not the gun and the terror lol if you fear people in this game don't go outside in the real world it's gonna blow your mind
---
Legit asking. No salt. I thought the notes said 25 percent nerf. How will that ruin a gun that's waaaaaay overpowered. Could someone explain to me. I'm a moron. 
---
okay smart ass I didn't realise how big the aoe damage is guess it was my fault 
---
If Bethesda somehow think that introducing a battle royal mode or just giving us pve / pvp servers count as DLC / Endgame content we in serious troubles :(
---
1. PC
---
2. VintageSwordsman
---
3. N/A
---
4. Not knowing if I already have a plan or recipe in game, need to have an identifier on whether or not you have used that recipe or plan before. This would be mighty helpful!
---
Because they are nerfing things that are fun which in turn will lead to people leaving the game (as you can see from the new threads in this sub). That fact alone makes it worth their time, given of course that they still care about the game. 
---
Btw op things are usually popular in video games. Just saying. They should just disable pvp on current servers, name them pve servers and make the new servers they just announced pvp servers and balance items on the 2 servers differently. Mainly focusing on pvp balance on the pvp servers and pve balance on the pve servers. This is the only way this game can survive imho.
---
YES PLEASE part of the reason for guild wars 2 popularity is the ability to change your build on the fly so if any undocumented changes hit us or a change in direction from the devs sweep in we don't have to go through the whole tediousness of leveling a new character into a another build. I think they think it would be more profitable for them, but it won't .. people will easily become exhausted with dealing with the survival aspects over and over and over and the same repetition. 
---
Being able to change our builds on a high level character who can immediately jump into the role will help retain players longer.
---
How far do you think the vats range is for melee? And those 1k damage builds require running around with like 40 hit points. I run around using unarmed most of the time. I can one shot most things. I also die a loooot more than i did before I started using melee, in both pve and pvp.
---
Wait though. If Im standing still how can I possible be a threat? I need to get close to hit you.
---
So as soon as I start moving you shoot an kill me?
---
What's so hard about this to grasp? 
---
I should note I am not a fan of full auto. Not logical, just a personal dislike. Spray-n-pray is the Army way. Marines have to conserve ammo. ;-)
---
Give everybody a pipboy food coupon that can be redeemed at Dulce's or train station vending machines.
---
Legendary item traits should be learnable by way of dismantling them
---
In the world of Fallout, due to the radioactive changes to the fauna, killing a beaver should let you harvest a waxy liquid from a gland near their anus that can be used as a Disease Cure or as an ingredient in recipes that call for raspberries. It could also be applied to a hive in order to increase honey production.
---
Oh, wait. Actually that's \[our world\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoreum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoreum))
---
What is there to "kill"?
---
I mostly play solo, I honestly would not notice if half the playerbase were to disappear overnight.
---
The TSE is a op weapon. Get the fuck over it. If you can't kill a melee with a gun you just suck at the game.
---
Marsupial mutation.
---
This is not the kind of balance that should be focused on first. Lets balance the builds before we balance the legendary effects. At this time you can play heavy guns, two handed melee, auto rifles, simi-auto rifles or shotguns and be helpful against the SBQ before the patch. Post patch you can play two handed melee and heavy guns and do damage to the SBQ. Lets make 1 handed melee and pistols worth using as opposed to making two builds usable end game bosses.
---
I'll buy it
---
They're not removing two shot weapons, look at the edit.
---
Also, I don't think Two Shot needed to be nerfed.
---
Good riddance to Explosive rounds however, though with what the new Fireproof and Dense mods already did to it, this is more of an execution.
---
I haven't played endgame yet, but I FT to Whitespringes every time there's a detonation. My HazMat suit has served me fine. 
---
\[aside\] I remember working hard to get the "right" to train to wear PA in FO3, how exciting it was at first, and then how much I just didn't like it. Having it up front in FO76 doesn't make me want to wear it, because I just don't personally enjoy the experience of wearing it. \[/aside\]
---
Sorry for your disability then. 
---
Thanks for this bro! 
---
Dmg boost is 100% and they are changing it to 25% so think about that 
---
on pc? I can make you an overrepaired one
---
GT - Chris W8976. 
---
3 did, 4 did not.  NV had factions and that was interesting... but that requires having groups of NPC's at war with each other...  pretty hard to start a holotape war in 76...
---
Thought they planned on creating an Open PvP, no holds barred mode, that means you would select to go into a World like that, like an ultra survival mode. Me, I'd stick to one where Workshops are about the extent of PVP is live once someone tries to steal one.
---
More missions and questlines we can complete as teams that arent tied to location would be awesome. Lately it seems like if we want to play together we have to either launch a nuke or wander around aimlessly looking for something to do. It can get a bit mundane.
---
That's the best part lol 15$ a set of something just to lose the op weapons now they need to kill stackable bobbles or it will be pointless 
---
Legit. Marsupial mutation + jetpack is killer.
---
I love how, based on lore, all of the human characters in this game are just former vault 76 dwellers and yet ppl are like, "hey Bob!  Haven't seen you in weeks/months since Reclamation Day!  I know we used to be neighbors but imma kill you and eat your flesh!"  Instead of, "holy fuck, someone that isn't a robot/mutant/ghoul we should team up to survive this shit show"
---
I'm with you there brother. Even with the nerf I've been wanting a TSE gauss
---
I could have been solved if they let you use multiples of the same card but with varying ranks. Currently you can only have one or another. I would have kept some low purposely for flexibility. 
---
Yhey didnt have a jetpack
---
Min maxing to get the most out of effort put in. 
---
Yeah I'm just saying. 
---
Perfect!  Thank you!
---
It's on XB1, GT is AlpineYJ.
---
I took some video of it last night, but haven't had the chance to upload it as of yet.  If you think it would help, I can PM you the link once I have it up.
---
Haha sick Zelda floor lights. Didn't know you could stack em'! 
---
the mutasion
---
Ahhh
---
Ohh
---
It's very much legit
---
You're incorrect about TSE not one shotting people in PvP. That's what allowed people to one shot with slap damage enabled. My level 5 explosive shotgun can one shot players, imagine what a level 50 explosive weapon can do. Quite frankly, this is a good balancing act for these prefixes and this is how it should have been at launch. They should not be this powerful, nor should they outclass every single other prefix or combination thereof. 
---
I added you
---
Harder to find? I have 48. And I use a laser gatling... o.O
---
In a pinch, go run Line in the Sand for at least 2 fusion cores. If that takes too long go beat up the Sentry Bot at Dyer Chemical.
---
Exploiring power armour stations for spawns of them and pieces of PA. 
---
There are apps that have all the locations 
---
Be careful, if you make it too powerful people will cry and Bethesda will nerf it. 
---
Theyre not wrong though. The explosive part is the problem. With both being nerfed theyre forcing anyone who wants to run a ranged build to run bloodied now.
---
Sounds good. Join on me. 
---
No it can not we did three day worth of testing of this. I will edit the link and the results.
---
Agreed. Those flamingos are lit.
---
Fair enough, wasn’t aware of the Line in the Sand event being useful for anything, thanks.
---
I have a pvp melee build, almost always win vs tse, especially after fireproof patch. Mind boggling right. 
---
Just pointing it out, if that's the bench mark for being a smart ass then we got problems o.0
---
I just jumped in my first PA yesterday at level 56 and it’s hilarious trying to be sneaky in that big clunky suit of armor haha. Hey if you’re on PS4 and have a bunch of T-51 PA parts I can mod them with Nuka Cola paint if you want! 
---
I'm not convinced that killing every in one shot is more interesting than a drawn out fight but I'll conceded on the fact that many enemies lack proper AI to make them super interesting to fight. Especially when they don't do any real damage. I look for challenges in a shooter. If it can easily blow through everything that when I lose interest and I don't mind high health pools IF the enemies presents a real threat.  If not then it's a bit annoying. Still in the world of a wasteland survival game there should be some actual threats in the world or else you have a wasteland building simulator XD
---
You're right, FO3 had a karma system. FO1 had a "general reputation" instead, but that was functionally the same. FO2 gave it the name.
---
FO4 instead went for companion approval ratings and faction statuses, which made sense for the story. (The four factions are fighting for both survival and control of the Commonwealth, so they mostly care about whether you're allied or hostile to them than how many puppies you've kicked.)
---
You can already see the dupe market adjusting to this in the trade reddits, people are dumping their mountains of TSE 's and trying to trade up for Bloodied weapons.
---
They won't be "Bad." A TSE will still do more dmg than a  non Legendary version. This just helps to make them less OP which will also lower the duping game. 
---
PVP aside...I think the problem that most people have with TSE, and rightfully so, are with those that abuse the use of them. Perfect example is that guy with a TSE shotty posted outside the door to whitesprings golf course clearing out the entire lobby full of glowing in 1 shot. It’s not fair to melee or those without explosive weapons and I see why. I am a TSE user myself but when I’m doing things with others either A. I don’t use it B. I take off the 100% explosive damage perk so it won’t 1 shot everything. The TSEs I use are to make my solo farming life easier or for SBQ fights. 
---
I never thought of that... I just came across 2 low level players with 4 sets of bare PA chassis in a building, wish I’d have though to grab one or two of the cores.
---
I will in a minute
---
In all honestly this is not going to work it never has in the past. What should have been done from the beginning is make 1-2 factions people can align with or none and stay neutral .. only faction based parties can claim workshops and can only attack enemy faction players., so neutrals can watch and or decide to become part of the fun or stay neutral and go be single players on a multiplayer map but not interfere with factions.
---
 I thought they had some understanding of their target market, but it's diverse, either they failed to properly research or simply ignored it. 
---
Rarely had crashes unless it was from someone near me using the gun. Go back to finding a gun now with the skill, ok?
---
Plus strange in numbers charisma perk
---
The problem, in general, is that Bethesda is probably going to fix Bobbleheads but also apply a nerf for TSE weapons that also is aimed towards what is a root cause of Bobblehead stacking.
---
So once Bobbleheads get fixed, the nerf against TSE and other guns will end up being too strong and they'll come back at the next patch buffing the same guns once again.
---
There is already no pvp.
---
This. Make the slap damage NOT scale and cap it at 1 or 10 or anything that is an ACTUAL number, so one shotting iliterally impossible. Instead, they nerf the fun things. Great job Bethesda!
---
I would guess less than 1 million weapons of the TSE variety is real. The other 99 million are duped. 
---
Its not a 25% nerf. Its 75% to the 2 shot and 80% to the Explosive.
---
Handful? 
---
Last time I went there, there were so many concierge robots there that they could not all fit behind the counter. 
---
I honestly didn't know. Thanks for answering
---
Instigating and furious have good rolls too everyone is just so deer in the headlights and I hate to say it but the duping market literally made this if they were rare mods we wouldn't be in this horrible fix 
---
Haha fuckin' gotem
---
Damn I've seen it 2 times today
---
Ok. Thank you. 
---
What about unyielding armor? You can probably get charisma up a lot more with that also.
---
Posted this before they updated their post.  Have trouble reading timestamps I suppose?
---
Not to mention these people are so out of touch with other weapon types that they don't realize while melee can be OP, it's also one of the few weapon types that already had base perk specifically to counter it. Blocker. 
---
And yeah bloodied builds can still one shot, but at their health, it's not like they're all that hard to kill in return.
---
Typically splash damage is only powerful when it maximizes the area of effect, say by hitting 4 people instead of 1. When aoe hits only one person it's generally to reduced effect, which is how balance is maintained.
---
I'm with you on everything you've said. If my choice is a dull fight where I burn a lot of resources or a quick fight that gets dull when repeated where I do not burn a lot of resources, I will choose the latter. I wish that was not the choice, of course, but, well...
---
I agree with this
---
I keep 5 regular stims in my stash to break down and 15 dilluted stims on me for emergencies (using auto stim armor is pointless without having some) and that's it.  Everything else gets sold ASAP. I was saving stims for a while till I realized they're just wasting space because I'm doing most of my healing in combat with hot keyed canned dog food, and regular eating and drinking keeps me topped up otherwise. I do carry about 30 cans of dog food though but it weighs way less than stims and heals about the same (with associated perks). I also carry a vampire's bowie that I use on mid to low level enemies and I usually clear mobs and locations with no loss of health if I'm using that thing.
---
Nope. Fuck TSE, fuck the player whining that they can't dominate with their shitty broken weapons that they bought duped. 
---
I 100% agree lets make some noise
---
Okay so my takeaway is this: Why is BeThEsDa TaKinG my Ez MoDe AwAy.   
---
Nearly 600 hours in and I have to create my own challenges, I was spoiled early on I managed TSE 2\* early on and I have managed quite the collection. Can't get a bloodied anything to drop ever though it seems. So when I mock people about easy mode I mean it. Those guns are broken as fuck and need a nerf.   
---
Currently I am playing 1-50 no perks or special points and only using items dropped...problem is I have had two TSE's drop which I gave away since I wanted to play and not just spam fire will prancing/jumping around like a derp.   
---
TL;DR TSE are OP need the nerf as game is EZ mode anyways. 
---
I’ll do some research and revise it
---
Sneak attack for 2.5x damage is more than 100% damage boost
---
That’s essentially what I was implying, and yes I do believe that is true and only true for the quest rewards of that questline. 
---
Cheers ▲
---
I never liked how easy the Grafton monster is. You can just stand on any platform and defeat him, and I always find ones at level 10 or so that I just blow through. 
---
This has been an issue since day 1. It took me a couple weeks, tons of caps and resources to finally give up on workshops. Claiming them only to get disconnected is just not worth it.
---
I know, all I'm saying is at the moment alien =/= flatwoods monster. We can speculate it, sure no problem. But when someone say they fought aliens most of us think of the zetans from the other games. That's all Inwas saying to him. 
---
yep no problem good hunting, if I hadn't sold my spares I would offer you one.
---
Pay?
---
thats okay, it will give me something to keep an eye out for while im wandering around
---
I'm kind of glad there isn't so many now. Helps with the stability of the game when you are in Whitesprings.
---
It's complete crap!  Are you on Xbox?  I'll take it off your hands so you don't have to bother selling it to a vendor....  I mean I'll give you 2 caps over vendor price... that seems fair....  I'm just a nice guy like that. 
---
Now you know, happy exploring 
---
OMG this. I have very limited space this would help immensely 
---
Ok, I see what you're saying. I never noticed that since laser weps are useless rn. 
---
If they ever did this, hopefully they'd increase CAMP budget. I would 100% love to collect stuff for my place
---
I do a bit of both. Take workshops to start PvP, always kill bounties ( even if I spend 30 caps to claim 10 ), but equally happy to drop low level legendaries etc into the overseers camp if I see new 76'ers emerging from the vault.
---
I don't actually enjoy destroying camps, especially when they have shit like decontamination arches ( although I have destroyed 2x2 wooden shacks with artillery for lols before )
---
I'm like a chaotic neutral raider, might punch you in the face, might just sell.you chems.
---
Exactly make a safe place for casuals and reluctant bfs/gfs who will quit if they get frustrated
---
No, you're right. I love it!
---
Sneak attack is a situational ability that requires some planning and a particular state to be effective, not a static effect. 
---
One could make an argument that 2.5x is also an overpowered outcome, but it's apples and oranges.
---
What about players like me that got 2 legit TSE drops?
---
MMOs change over time with nerfs or buffs, players MUST have the ability to change with those as well. 
---
I stopped reading when you claimed ranged weapons have no advantage over melee.
---
It doesn't matter how much damage melee does in one hit if you have a ranged weapon and don't get near them it does 0.
---
Will be interesting to clearly see how many folks really want hardcore raider style pvp.  
---
Not how I would word it, but more or less
---
Feed the People before it was nerfed. Really liked how it could benefit all players on the server so it felt like you were doing something altruistic.
---
Events that help you with getting harder to get RNG items e.g. plans, from various events like the penitentiary.
---
Quests that a nigh on impossible to do solo, particularly at lower levels like Steelheart, corpseflower and Feed the People to name a few examples.
---
The Messanger Quest because the pathing it TERRIBLE!
---
N/A as I never play in a team but there should be some that's more rewarding (either in player experience or literal rewards) when played in a group but without restricting the ability to solo the event.
---
Ones that aren't solely reliant on combat e.g. puzzle hunts.
---
Larger events that are like raid bosses or nuke zones but triggered by the game and not the player. Something that'd be a real draw for multiple players, much like Feed the People was pre-nerf or the penitentiary is now.
---
Depends on circumstance. It's not that common I would explicitly fast travel to an event unless it's a rewarding one e.g. penitentiary.
---
Otherwise, I just take on or pass on events as I encounter them organically during gameplay.
---
Right now, I'd much prefer daily and weekly events to actually be daily and weekly i.e. they last for 24 hours or 7 days. Right now, dailies disappear if you're disconnected or log out of the world you picked up the daily in. It should be around for a full 24 hours, regardless of how many times you've disconnected or logged in.
---
That aside though, so long as the dailies and weeklies aren't tedious, I don't mind having bonuses attached to it.
---
They are junk now, why use a two-shot weapon for a 25% dmg boost when you can use a bloodied weapon for 4x that amount of damage.
---
Yup I totally agree. Or even make it so they can not be on the same weapon. 
---
If rifles and shotguns pistols are THAT much worse than HW without TSE, they were that much worse *with* TSE (aside from shotguns, which were all kinds of broken with the TS (very bad) and the E (insanely good). So adjusting TSE is perfectly fine, and a bigger priority than build balance (which is still important, don’t get me wrong)
---
I would love a laser buff
---
No, I want to complain that the Bethesda "launcher" is a piece of shit. Oh, and the game too. 
---
Here's something else to consider.
---
Grape Mentats CHR +5 
---
X-cell CHR +2 (not sure if it stacks with mentats)
---
Sweet roll +3 CHR
---
And a bunch of alcohol will add +1 CHR.
---
Unyielding will give +3 for each piece so +15.
---
&gt;The rules of PvP as they currently are in the game are not changing outside of the new mode.
---
So there's still slap damage?
---
*shrug* Big hard drive?
---
My name is julieisdead on PC # 190117-004175 
---
I tamed a deathclaw and he came to my camp. I moved my camp three times then noticed 30% phantom camp budget in my storage.  I scrapped everything in my camp.  Still I had 10% budget from the deathclaw and 30% phantom budget in storage.  I moved my camp.  I had 10% from the deathclaw and 40% phantom budget.  I had a player kill the deathclaw.  I still had 10% and 40%.  I moved my camp.  The deathclaw is alive and I have 50% phantom budget.  Please clear out my camp storage.
---
Its likely that client stability is being handled by different people than balance changes.
---
Lack of endgame is a plague of all MMO's.  Because either you add a bunch of stuff to do that in the end the community will figure out which is the best to farm because of time/effort and thus  the extra stuff is wasted development resources.  Or you have what we have now.. one thing to do.  Feel like they didn't plan for experience point exploits to be found which made getting to "end game" a leisurely stroll through the soot flowers.  Feel like the game needs a hard level cap because in the future they will probably increase the level that you can allot points into main stats and new perks and the level 100+ ppl will already cry about no endgame due to already being there
---
Guns will always have range on Melee. Melee with right build rule DPS and builds with Nerd Rage and Bloodied get to the point Guns don’t damage them at all. So don’t tell me Melee can not get close enough.
---
We don't need OP weapons in the amount they exist. I sense this nerf is temporary, possibly, and will remain until TSE weapons have dwindled a decent amount by being sold at vendors, or Bethesda deleting duper inventory. They might bring it back after that with different changes.
---
Free food and water 
---
I agree. 
---
I bought the game around Xmas for half price, thinking that it'll get better. It has. It will probably get better still. I'm plenty happy with it right now, and as far as I'm concerned, any further improvements are  just a bonus.
---
In their post history they're trading large numbers of TSE weapons in /r/Market76, so my first assumption was that the two might be related, but digging a little deeper it looks more like a connection problem.
---
Well truth be told that does tend to get away from me at times.
---
Okay cool, glad you still like it then 😁
---
True enough, thank you.
---
They've updated the post.
---
there we go!  
---
hell yeah!
---
Im with you, lazy ass decision on their end. 
---
Damn out of the 50 or so of these in the last two weeks, this is by far the most insufferable.
---
I agree.
---
Yeah, I’m trying to build a cyberpunk-ish camp and it’d be nice to have more neon billboards to decorate =D
---
No they're not
---
Oh, I see
---
- fast travel with maxed out Strong Back like FO4
---
no
---
get a box of tissues and curl up in bed. Balancing happens.
---
75-80% nerfs are a bit much, but good to see something being done.
---
Still have it? I’ll buy it from you for the right amount! Add me, PSN: Liversss
---
If you can build a melee build guns can't hurt you can build a gun build guns can't hurt too.
---
Seems your problem with melee isn't actually the melee itself.
---
Why are you against ez mode, to turn it around? People have different play styles and prefer different "modes".
---
If I'm having fun blasting away the enemy with a gun I spent a long time searching for, what does that take away from your experience? 
---
It's fine if you want a more challenging experience, as you obviously think the game is too easy to start with. But then why not implement different servers with different difficulties? 
---
Then players like you could join a hardcore survival server, and players like me could join a "vanilla" server, and we would still both have fun.
---
Happened on Xbox one x 3 nights ago,stuck and couldn't move, stopped playing,waited till the patch,started up again,things were fine,until the insane amount of crashes, 6 in maybe 20 mins or so, I cannot in any sense now play the game,at all. I was one of the idiots that played on day one,and hung in for dear life living on a prayer like Bon jovi.
---
There's a pacifist mode you can use in the meantime
---
He should just be in the center, kinda curled up into a ball until you get near.
---
They posted the retraction after the community lost their respective minds, I have a 7 page post going on BethNet...
---
For power armor. The picture should show our power armor instead of just the frame
---
I was just thinking about making a post inviting someone from the team to take a stroll through the wasteland with me. I think some time with players would do a lot of good.
---
Did Bethesda hold a knife to the throat of these dimwits? Its all in the TOC, do you understand the purpose of a TOC? Its exactly for this reason they have them. NO GAME IS PERFECT.
---
I can taste your bitter, salty tears..mmmm mmmm.
---
all the best 
---
Preach
---
Right. I'll keep that in mind.
---
This "nerf" doesnt fix anything though, now all its going to do is force players from being able to have creative builds to everyone who wants to run a ranged weapon being forced to run bloodied because thats the only good way to deal effective end game damage.
---
What! They removed it WTF has exsplosive been removed too? If that is the case what other legendary effects are worth keeping
---
Which events do you feel are most rewarding to you?
---
Love - Bots on Parade, Uranium Fever, Battle Bot, Distant Thunder, Grafton Day, Surface to Air, Scourched Earth, 
---
Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why?
---
Breach and Clear (Ore SUCKS!, get rid of it and hand out scrap!), Back on the beat (The robot dies WAY too quickly, all escort quests should take very little interaction from the player), Death BlossomsDouble the hitpoints for these, they die too fast), Distinguished Guests (Increase rewards and scale it base don number of people, way too hard for one or two people and doesnt let you know that 4 people are required).
---
Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why?
---
Scouched Earth is best in a team. Most others are best solo because I can run and kill everything without worrying about loot rights. I suggest you change loot rights to include people all people in an area or all people in your team, not just people that have tagged the mob.  
---
What types of events would you like to see in the game?
---
Puzzles! Randomized so you cant just look up the answers. Did any of you play The Secret World? The game wasnt that great, but  some of the quests were amazing.
---
Building quests! You build a fantastic building system and NO events that involve it past some wiring for powerplants! How about a quest to repair a bulding. Really simple. Later quests to build bridges, defenses (you have to hide for some reason them mobs are pitted against your build), etc.
---
Way more interesting and new bosses from Nukes! Nuke the Behemoth? Oh, that would be amazing. Nuke a specific rad-immune Mirelurk Queen? Now she has 3 heads and breathes plasma. So many options!
---
How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an event?
---
Almost always fast-travel. It seems to be the best way to ensure I actually join an event. If I just walk to it, sometimes I dont join. Also, sometimes the even it way far away from the actualy Event Octogon
---
Forget Daily quests, it really sucks having to feel like I have to log on every day.
---
Weekly quests would be cool. Make the rewards a 3star though, guarenteed. 
---
I'll be ok thanks for the offer
---
It’s not an issue of balancing it’s a issue of bad decisions. I gave a proper way to balance every issue. The correct thought out way.
---
OMG I have this exact same outfit and you're right, it is dope as fuck.
---
I put on my "gas mask" (T-51b) when I'm in the ass heap.
---
Who do you think is listening to your suggestion?
---
Ohhh, my queen melter is a simple furious .50 cal it shreds 
---
Hw can use furious to a much greater effect which is why they will still work well after the nerf
---
To shreds you say?
---
Nah on the contrary, nerfing the peaks is necessary to then buff everything.
---
What makes people lose interest is the fact that literally no regular weapon works at high level except melee and TSE. This game and Fallout 4 have a big issue with damage resistance and bullet sponginess. 
---
Yeah honestly I'm kind of pissed about my two shot weapons becoming 1.25 shot weapons. Even with all 9 levels of heavy Gunner plus stabilized it takes a good amount of ammo to take out super mutant masters and scorch beasts. If they nerf two shots they seriously need to need some of the enemies, fighting bullet sponges in a game that you already have to spend a good chunk of time farming materials to craft ammo is going to suck.
---
Guess I'm farming the armors. Are you on PC by chance? 
---
No change is actually listed for the explosive perk. 
---
 Even saying this for a while. Best fix for slap damage to not be one hit deadly is a set damage and not a percentage. It makes bobblehead stacking and any other ridiculous combo people find (because they will find other combos) irrelevant to PvP.
---
That said, nerfing the crutch-guns is fine by me.
---
It’s value goes up soon not down. 
---
My dice roll isn’t 20 every time I roll. The dice must be broken...
---
I like your ideas and would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
To me, one of the thing that shows blast zones could be better is after the SBQ, everyone leaves the zone and it's done.  There might be a straggler going after violet flux (ferns), but ya it's not an engaging place.  That's a missed opportunity.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
The Mods for this in fo4 where the very first I installed. It adds sooo much more detail to a home. all furniture should have display locations. one of my favorites is the Mr.Handy Figure or a place to display weapons. Put food and drinks on tables type writers on desks or so many other cool options. 
---
5 fusion cores is way too many, I’d have to drop them.
---
The respec isnt meant to change your whole build, just to do adjustments. This game isnt like other online games where you pick a class and a respec lets you change the skills in that class. Getting to respec all your special points when ever and wherever would be a broken mechanic. 
---
Completely agree. The entire reason that I even started seeking legendaries (I’ve only come across an explosive shotgun so far worth keeping) is because rifles weigh too much, the rate of fire and reload is slow and it’s very demoralizing to waste 3 clips of ammo on a ghoul 30 levels below me.
---
Hemorrhaging ammo on significantly lower level enemies is not fun. And the changes to those legendary mods are more than just balancing...its gutting them.
---
Why would it go up xD it's getting worser not better..? 
---
Is there any source of information for DPS tests?
---
Seeing the difference between a Two Shot weapon compared to a TSE and other legendary rolls would be interesting. If people genuinely think that the main choice for endgame (SBQ) is TSE or bloodied builds then just how far away is the next best build?
---
Like I have a legit question. I have never once had a hazmat break  on me. EVER. I mean what is the condition for them to break?  I have been beat to death countless time and across 4 characters not once has a hazmat broken for me.   
---
Am I broken? Do my characters have super powers that does not allow hazmats to break?  All other armor or PA can break just not hazmats... Am I the destined one? Is it my legacy to be in a hazmat and comb the wastelands with its invincibility? (Okay i was being a smartass but still why won't they break for me) 
---
Don't put your camp in a populat place. I watched a few videos of "best camp locations" and specifically chose NOT to build there
---
Pacifist mode does not work like that, it only keeps me from damaging other players, I can still take damage. I only play with passive mode on. 
---
Finding Giddyups and scrapping them for parts still makes me sad thinking about Arlen. 
---
I like that Bethesda is doing this kind of update where they're giving some insight into future content and addressing some current concerns.
---
It'd be nice if Bethesda did a video version summing up these sorts of things for major update releases. Much like League of Legends or Overwatch do it. Examples below:
---
League of Legends - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tydJwdQRMqs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tydJwdQRMqs)
---
Overwatch - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-XwHIlZU3k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-XwHIlZU3k)
---
Yes im hoping they will hear what the majority post are trying to explain. Knowing Bethesda it will take time to sort it out though.
---
Then they will nerf bloodied and adrenal reaction. It's a cycle. They do however need to balance weak guns with more buffs, and I believe 100% weapons will have higher levels than 50 and do more damage in the future.
---
Yeah it's been two weeks of server hopping with no change.
---
On the occasion that I come out from under my rock, I really only see the few that seem to love pvp and don't like them, talking about it. 
---
- Offering rewards unique to the event/rare in the world.
---
- With guaranteed legendary mobs e.g. Uranium Fever, Horde events.
---
- With server wide benefit/affect e.g. Mama Dolce's Canned Beef Stew.
---
- Where the time runs out as soon as you get there
---
- Where previously glitched enemies/glitches have prevented completion
---
- Where rewards are disproportionate to time spent/difficulty/cost to travel e.g. Enclave events
---
- Personally I normally play solo so events that draw people in such as Uranium Fever or Line in the Sand are good as often other people are there to work with.
---
- More waves of enemies type events
---
- Mini-boss events which would challenge a high level solo player. Perhaps spawns more mobs if there is a team present.
---
- Level 50+ Epic/Legendary events with high difficulty and reward.
---
How do you join events? Do you fast travel? Do you go to a location expecting to start an events?
---
- Mostly fast travel however stumble upon them whilst exploring.
---
- As a level 110 still interested in developing the 1 character any change that provides extra incentive to do daily events/quests would be very welcome.
---
I used to have a seculded base and never got attacked during the lower levels, but I wanted to RP differently. Too bad that the way I want to play this game is the "wrong" way.
---
Perhaps you're right and this game is not for me. A PVE only mode would get me back in to it, but perhaps it's just time to call it quits. 
---
I'm partial to the drifter outfit, is it considered rare? Also, the wrapped cap can be buggy at times.
---
Suggestion: When referring to legendary mods, a better term to describe them might be legendary effects as to distinguish them from actual weapon mods that can be crafted/found/applied to weapons/armor. Ignore this if you actually plan on selling mod kits in the future that allow us to add Two-Shot to a regular gun of our choosing.
---
As for the change, I'd advocate for the other legendary effects to be buffed. Assassin's needs to be like +50% more damage. Hunter's/Exterminator's/Mutant Slayer's/Zealot's should also be buffed to 50% if not 100%. Picking a situational gun should give you a substantial upgrade over an jack of all trades like Two-Shot. Buffing the latter also strictly impact PvE so it's not even a PvP concern. 
---
I'd also like it if it was clear somewhere what classify as what...  Is there any large "bugs" that would benefit from additional damage of Exterminator? The closest I can think of is Fog Crawler but is that Exterminator or Hunter? Gulpers? What about Scorch Beasts, are they Zealot or Hunter? Scorched MoleRat?
---
I'm also not a fan of the number of classes, it makes things too situational. Maybe merge Exterminator into Hunter and Mutant Slayer into Zealot? 
---
The plan or the mission?
---
So what is getting nerfed? TS or Explo?
---
I have the same problem. I bought the 'Resort Paintings' at WhiteSprings and those show up in my C.A.M.P items to build, but the 'Modern Paintings,'  which I received after defending a workshop, do not show up in C.A.M.P at all. I know these are two different plans. "Resort Paintings' are the more 19th Century style oil portraits of people, landscapes, and kittens. I assume that 'Modern Paintings' are the 20th century style, more abstract paintings that you see hanging at different locations in the game. 
---
I am so disappointed because I went around repeatedly claiming workshops just to get the Modern Paintings to drop, but even after finally receiving the plans they don't show up as craftable C.A.M.P. items like the Resort Paintings do. I'm wondering whether anyone has gotten these to show up for them, or if they're bugged for all.
---
Plan
---
It’s a great low-level player event. And if you camp in the zone ... free rewards whenever newbie players are on the server!
---
Thank you for saving me the time 
---
I might just have to do that. 
---
Where does this come from, patch sticky looks to be from 10th?
---
I've been begging for hard core 1 life servers since June. I don't see it happening, and this is the wasteland why should shit be easy.  
---
I'll check if they are there
---
Haha said the same thing effectively to JessBethesda the "retraction" (clarification) to the removal of TwoShot..  
---
All of the changes being made effectively look like someone who only "knows about" the game and hasn't played it for more than a handful of hours, or a very very casual enthusiast.  
---
**They look good on paper and that's it.**
---
Any of the changes they've done to "balance" things like Feed the People or Public workshops effectively results in no one doing them.
---
Both
---
Your Hazmat Suit can break, it has a normal CND Bar after which it will display a "broken" status. However it will remain active in a diminished state so long as you dont unequip it at which point you will need to repair it before being able to requip it.
---
Scorchbeasts don't whine on Reddit and the forums when you use four shotgun shells to wipe out their eight minions. It's not the Glowing Ones at Whitespring that complain about TSEs killing them before they can take a swipe at the lowbie who wandered into the nuke zone.
---
Thats the thing though, online games shouldnt be a cycle of nerfing things to the ground anytime someones found a favorite it should be about bringing up other weapons to the same level to give more options and open up better build possibilities. If anything developers shouldve learned this from the idiotic cycle Destiny 1 had where everyone month there was a new "op" weapon and all the others were trash.
---
Amen!
---
I thought the article only said TS on TSE was getting nerfed? So I might as well just look into exploding weapons, right?
---
To be fair I talked to him on ps4messenger and he was pretty forthcoming. That effect is achievable at like 10 stacked bobbleheads and It wasnt something to report as he was pretty cool. I think he may have grinded them out but who knows
---
If you want to retain the ability to kill with ease it's looking like melee atm
---
/signed
---
Wow this actually makes Instigating on sniper rifles and Furious on fast firing weapons much better.
---
This is a terrible idea.
---
I'm all for a video response addressing a lot of player concerns and future plans (of which they could request questions beforehand). However, doing an AMA is a suicidal PR move. 
---
No good comes out of this. They'd just be pinatas to commentators and especially the haters and edgelords of our community (I mean collectively, not the fo76 sub).
---
The issue IS whether or not a person enjoys the game. That’s the whole goddamn point of games. 
---
I don't believe so no... And yeah I mentioned that lol
---
So  I haven't seen it so much on Queen runs, but I CANNOT play at Whitesprings.  My wife and I will be on the same server, in the same team, and I will ALWAYS crash to desktop at Whitesprings (2-10 min depending on mob density).  Now, the fortunate side to that is that I can just join her and have all the Glowing Ones respawn at the clubhouse, but still... I feel your pain.  Maybe it is a RAM issue, seems to be the only difference between her and I at the moment, especially since we know it is  not a server crash.
---
But every game that spends time on the shell game of follow the Nerf ends up failing or doing an about face when they realize it comes down to better testing and not adjusting the whole game to a minor subset of the community.
---
Blooded Explosive is already more effective than TSE, and they clearly don't even realize it.
---
I’ve got that one but I think there’s some type of glitch regarding trophy’s. I’m missing the hack 50 terminals trophy but have hacked waaaaay more than 50, also the mod 50 weapons trophy. Same thing tho, I know I’ve modded more than 50. 
---
If you decide to go back to water farming rather than your new gold farm, there's a spot just north of RobCo that has space for three industrials, lots of open ground for easy starch farming, and is close enough to Cranberry for Pitcher Plants to spawn.

Thanks for saving me from that Scorchbeast earlier, by the way.

A trash can? low blow

I know it has condition mine has never once gone down on any of my suits ever. I have a level 1 suit that I wear a lot and it is still 100%.  I also unequip it and reequip depending on area. Hell the SBQ killed me like 15 times in a row last night while I had it on it is still 100%. 
---
Oh, so that's why explosive was crazy.  I assumed it was a small static damage value like fo4.
---
Please let me know if they are. You're on PS4?
---
I just think balancing pvp / camp dmg is a more realistic approach than just splitting an already small player base into two even smaller ones.  Like having pacifist mode include your camp. So yea ppl can destroy it but it will take a stupid amount of ammo to do so. It's just annoying that people are so divided on it that it has to be only pvp and only pve .
---
Would the "Powerfull" legendary mod be returning? for the damage is dealing, maybe a combination of powerfull + antiarmor its my only hope for killing the Queen in 20 mins.
---
You said stacked bobbleheads don't bypass slap damage mechanics. That's correct, the don't bypass it. You take 1% (slap damage reduction) of 3,000,000 damage, which is 30,000 damage, and all your PA parts explode and you die. Confirmed here:
---

---
There will not be a single viable gun build after this patch. It will be melee or nothing. Energy weapons are still broken and now any decent gun is nerfed to shit. 
---
Even the strongest guns will max around 500 dmg and you can still get claws and super sledges up to 6k easily. 
---
Thats how eyebots are made 😂
---
Yes I'm on ps4 checking now
---
Same. It also allows you to be killed if you're in a party with wanted people regardless of you engaged or not. Doesn't help that TSE are incredibly OP, they make fatmans look like a joke
---
Triggered.
---
Yep. Good points.
---
They changed the wording. They will still drop in world loot.

We could use the Mad Scientist car to help kill him

There’s no longer PvP servers in WoW. There’s a toggle you can flip when you’re in your capitol city. People with the toggle on are put in the same shard.

I want unboxed, ready to play on top of a table or on the floor board games.

We can agree to disagree. Do you have suggestions on how BGS can better connect with the players? Or maybe you think its ok as-is, and that's fine. I don't. I see a comms strategy that has not recovered from launch. I know they're working hard and the intent is solid, but there's a gap between players talking on this forum and "thanks for the idea, I've passed it on to the devs." And that gap is communication, IMHO.
---
Salty 300lb sweatboi. Go eat your tendies and leave reddit to actual humans.
---
At the Poseidon Nuclear Plant, you can repair it to claim it as yours and generate a new Fusion Core once every ten minutes.
---
Things have strengths and weaknesses. Nerfing "the peaks" and "buffing everything" seems like homogenizing everything to be the same, which in my opinion is one of the worst things that can happen to a game. I  personally think this TSE move might be a good thing, and I got the initial WTF out of my system. But as I have said in some other posts we will just have to wait and see how it turns out. I hope they do plenty of internal testing before making these decisions and announcements, and the people testing are hardcore and not some office staff who maybe aren't as deeply into the deeper aspects of the game and playstyles of many of the actual players.
---
You must be remembering wrong, because nothing has changed for me. Junk items, bulk junk, and single junk scrap are all able to be sold by me.
---
Duped bobbleheads must be a bigger problem than I imagined if the only problem with TSE is that people buff the explosive with bobbleheads.
---
BINGO, YATZEE
---
I've actually been looking for that, never found more than a 1* piece :/
---
that's called being bored at work, little one
---
notice its been 4 hours, that's called, being busy at work, little one
---
I'd really like to see bobble head stacking, duping, and PvP scaling fixed first. Please do that, monitor the results, and go from there.
---
In a game with such bullet sponge mobs, nerfing *Explosive* may improve PvP, but at the expense of PvE (which without the aforementioned fixes is destined to continue being the player base's priority); and nerfing Two Shot will have even less clear overall benefit.
---
I've had a problem with invisible enemies recently. Everyone else can see them and shoot them but ruger good part is I don't take damage from them. Sucks when it happens in the Whitesprings nuke zone
---
And you need to be what 20% health and be sneaking to hit that? So if something gets ahold of you then you die and you have to be right on top the mob. Spamming a TSE from range instant kills with little fear of death unless you shot something that got to close and killed yourself instantly.
---
You find one? I can hook you up if not
---
In terms of the queen the next viable build is leagues away and will never compare. After this nerf melee will be the ONLY way to damage a queen. 
---
All your comments and posts are getting downvoted.
---
He probably thinks Bethesda keeps old legendaries unnerfed and only nerf future drops. I dout it it's like that because it would bring Bethesda the worst ridicule in history for raising the value of duplicates.
---
Weapon Artisan perk is still not working on XBox1
---
Lol beautiful 
---
well yeah they do say "bonus damage" in their post so i'm not overly concerned that it'll target just that.  I mean... they could mess up but I'm sure they will have at least targeted the bonus damage =P
---
Wait, what? How? Because I'm definitely missing it and I desperately want to respec my character. 
---
Yes it was
---
&gt;With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world.
---
&gt;**The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%.** 
---
&gt;Note: This was a misunderstanding in what was being addressed with these mod
---
I was thinking that yes a blast zone should be bigger but instead of having two different areas, have it so that after a period of time the blast zone starts to decrease in its radiation effect. That way at first instance it's what it is now, super rads and high level mobs, and after a given time it turns to a lower amount of rads and the enemies are lower level. That way the high levels and anyone who wants to join em can do what they do in the first instance and after the given time it'll slowly switch out to be a mid level friendly blast zone (as friendly as a nuked blast zone can be anyway).
---
&gt; Nerf scissors. Rock is fine. Love, paper.
---
This isn't World of Warcraft and there is no rock-paper-scissors balance in Fallout.
---
A TSE weapon was dealing 4-6x as much as any other legendary combination, that is not healthy for any aspect of the game.
---
Look at it this way: If Bethesda ever wants to release new and challenging content they need to make it a challenge for TSE users. No one else will be able to complete it, or even get half way to completing it. Or on the flip side if it's made "accessible" then TSE users will complete it without any challenge.
---
That map is very helpful, thanks
---
You can either spend half of your perks to 1) reduce limb damage 2) increase resistances and health 3) decrease fall damage 4) increase carry capacity 5) a long etc. ... OR you can just hop into a PA and spend those perk pints into nicer stuff
---
IMHO PA is way overpowered 
---
It would be nice, but I don't see this being possible with the current state of the game. At least not before Beth increases camp budget and stash size and does something with its servers. My friendlist is crushing few times a MINUTE, cuz I have around 80 friends now. So yep, every item counts in this game.
---
Wow, that is very helpful, thank you!
---
I'd even settle for a wall that's the inside of brick on both sides for interior walls. I'm doing my best but it's impossible to avoid some brick inside unless it's just a one room rectangle 
---
I see what you mean, but don't agree. To some extent, you are right; this is the wasteland, and it shouldn't be easy. But for most players, it isn't actually as easy for them, as it is for you. 
---
Many players I know, still struggle to kill most mobs on their own level without building for 1 specific weapon.  
---
If enemies should be able to tank 10 shots to the head, they should at least react to being shot, in my opinion. But they don't, and many players, including myself find it frustrating when enemies are too bullet spongey. 
---
So my point is; I can see why you are against ez mode. But that's essentially any fallout game when you reach high enough levels.
---
Most of us struggled between level 1-50, so why not let us enjoy finally being able to kill pve enemies in less than 5 shots?
---
Your suggestion for a hardcore 1 life server does sound very fun, but perhaps is better suited for when private servers is released? That's just my opinion.  
---
Thank god.
---
500 dmg is still good. Its just not OP anymore. And for all you people jumping on the melee bandwagon, what do you think will be nerfed next after TSE? 
---
Thanks, I'm curious about the thought process on nerfing 2 shot.  I understand the explosive nerf but were 2 shot weapons that lack the explosive modification tested and deemed over powered?  If so, why?  
---
I feel like the explosive nerf alone is enough to address the major balance concerns, though it's not a huge deal to me personally.  Just feels like a bit of an overeaction.  
---
Also there is no change to explosive effect working per pellet for shotguns, so despite this nerf to explosive, explosive shotguns will still deal substantially more damage than other explosive guns that only apply the effect to 1 projectile.    
---
Lastly, was it intentional for two shot shotguns to get buffed?  Currently 2 shot only adds one additional pellet for shotguns which is universally less than 25% more damage.  After this "nerf" a 2 shot shotgun gets a flat 25% damage boost which results in a much more powerful weapon than before.    
---
On the whole it seems like whoever made the changes to 2 shot didn't really understand people were complaining about TSE's specifically and not 2 shot individually.  It was only the combination of 2 shot + explosive that was causing balance issues primarily, and then secondarily it was explosive being super powerful ESPECIALLY on shotguns.  
---
Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide!
---
IMO while it's obviously very powerful... It doesn't look good in a power armor suit, and I prefer heavy weapons.
---
I figured it out around lvl 25,  dont feel bad.  Im 127 now
---
I can't speak for everyone, but whenever I'm deciding where to wander off to next, I always see if there's any workshop defense events, especially if there's only one defender present.  It's how I've earned the bulk of the plans that I've earned.
---
Sweet bloody Jesus is that a *strong* and *severely misplaced* overcorrection on Two-Shot.

That is weird indeed. I am using a prototype Hazmat Suit and it breaks all the time

500 is good for everything except the queen. I'm not sure how many times you've participated in one bit even having 10 players with 500 dmg guns is not enough to kill her when you consider the way her resistance scales 
---
Could you post a pic? I'm helplessly lost lol
---
No you couldnt
---
They’re not doing any of this. It’s been updated with corrections. 
---
That is a good idea, but I imagined the damage would still be insanely high.
---
I was talking to someone yesterday who used a stealth build and he lamented there are no good wood armor items for sale by other players because they're regarded as trash and discarded.
---
You need some trash to make the good stuff stand out.
---
Raise the roof man, 80 upvotes and counting.
---
Still waiting on yours ;)
---
no, but I'm looking more for like a vendor, or spawn for it
---
Simple, 2-shot is not the broken mechanic and nerfing it doesn’t make sense.  Explosive however is rather op and needs some balancing.
---
Its been rock solid for me on XBONE X since the last patch.
---
But prior to that I would have frequent hard crashes when accessing vendors or crafting benches.
---
In the southern lake? Because I drop into the northern one all the time and the only thing there is an engine with some guys arm cuffed to it and his junk. 
---
That would have been a good idea a month ago but the cat is already out of the bag at this point. I can't believe they're doing this instead of just not making demolition expert apply to explosive legendaries, which is a huge part of the problem.
---
If you mean the Resort decor plans, no, there's no place else that sells them.
---
That's massively disappointing, rifle builds are by far my favourite. I wish Bethesda would bring in the anti-material rifle in and let it spawn with a legendary effect that increases damage based on distance from the enemy
---
There is balance though. Maybe you don't know about it or see it. If you're playing it like Caall of Duty then maybe. But if you take a more tactical approach then snipers and stealth will wreck some TSE shotgunner.
---
Calm down bro. It’s already been corrected as a mistake. 
---
What!? No!  I’m trying to get a whole set!  The shrouded mod on wood armor is amazing for stealth rifle build!
---
I love it when people use this word. 
---
It’s an amazing time saver that lets you know you can go ahead and ignore the fuck-face using it.
---
Damn Bro not there sorry
---
Hmmm probably cost 50 Screws and 50 Springs for each leg to build seeing as you get roughly 2 from scrapping them... But OKAY!
---
It's pretty random if a scorchbeast or two turn up. My hubby tried this event the other day but no scorchbeast.
---
They can appear anywhere though, really. I had an unexpected ally in one while at Dyer chemical. The creature had the good grace to thin out the robots there, making my life so much easier. I couldn't stop to wave to thank it though, it wanted to kill me too. However I just hid in a building and it left eventually. 
---
That would be a fantastic gun. I'm surprised the 50 cal hunting rifle doesn't work similar 
---
Username does not check out. 
---
Wow, fancy meeting you here! And you’re welcome, drinks are on me next time you’re near Watoga. We can swap big game hunt stories.
---
Good luck in the wasteland!
---
I dunno if you saw the correction but explosive is also getting nerfed. 
---
No worries bro, thanks for looking. 
---
I want a mod to shoot flames out my ass! 
---
The perfect ass flame moment would be when I sprint down the railroad tracks in my X-01 armor, bright headlights beaming into the blackness and screaming "CHOOO CHOOO COMING THROUUGHHHHHHH!!!!!" over the all talk! 
---
The flames would make it so dramatic. 
---
Maybe it could be one of the most elusive mods for the X-01! Even worse than a fucking jetpack! 
---
&gt; buff everything else to meet that level
---
You think you want that but you don't. There won't be any challenge anywhere in the game, unless Bethesda also buffs every monster in the world to match. That's a lot of work for the same net effect.
---
Well this xpac, sure War mode is a thing. But it is insanely one sided, mostly with horde. But even then, they are effectively on another "server" completely vs. people who don't engage it. I haven't played since just before the 8.1 patch, I know they wanted to incentivize the outnumbered side, but even then I don't know if more people engaged it. 
---
Did you test that you're seeing 76%, or did you just add up the possible bonuses?
---
Yeah this pisses me off to no end, Bethesda nerd MELEE first! I found my TSE lever myself and I feel cheated by the fucking exploiters. If the guns were as rare as they're supposed to be, not enough of these whiny people would have bitched.
---
Mostly Saying the same thing over on BethNet, but you can get very insanely OP damage with bloodied ranged builds as well.. Have a friend who constantly one shots Lvl 85 scorchbeasts out of the sky.
---
Explosive should have remained a primary legendary effect; if they wanted to modify damage, then use the "plasma" in its place 
---
Yay!  Nerf everything until the game is bland crap.  Might as well put more nails on the coffin.
---
Thank you! Had someone else point out the correction to me. Quite happy about it now! 
---
No problem mate! Happy to help :D
---
Hopefully once they finally open Vaults, it will give us more stuff to do than kill the queen. Plus since they seem like they will be made for 4 player grps, you shouldn't have the issue of too many people causing screwy scaling
---
I used a barn wall as a divider and the contrast doesn’t look too bad, it was a case of having to because the resort mirror disappeared into the concrete on the brick wall and the only way I can use it is to put it on a wood or barn wall, we definitely need interior walls though 👍
---
Maybe include your luck stat as that effects loot drops
---
Yet you can't figure out how to post insightful or even helpful comments.
---
You must have specced into everything but intelligence and charisma.
---
assassin metal armor with one weighted and one brawling mod on arms, talons and twisted muscles mutations, anti-armor powerfist with puncturing mod, 15 strength with martial artist, incisor, iron fist? barbarian, and blocker. Other special stats aren't specific to melee but you can look up non power armor builds to see what works. Melee characters need plenty of Agility to close gaps with sprinting, use vats for perfect hits, and to keep swinging 
---
mostly so you don't have to gimp your health to achieve it but yes, other effects are now more impactful and the top end items are no longer TSE in all cases.  
---
still tho TSE is a good combo of effects it's just no longer god tier.
---
Yes I am, that would be awesome. 
---
Just imagine... Sitting there in your camp with a bunch of friends playing some Catch the Commie...
---
Oh. Yep. I do those. I thought you meant a quest of some sort. 
---
Still broken as of 01/17/2019.
---
I’ve recently had an issue with West Tek both before and after patch. I’m on the original Xbone and 4 out of 4 trips there lately my game freezes up, makes terrible noises, then crashes to the home screen. Seems to happen after I take out a ton of super mutants and after so many, pffffffffttttt crash.  I think I’ve noticed a trend of it crashing during a VATS attack with melee but not entirely sure. Otherwise game is random with crashes but this place has been like 100% crash for me lately.
---
I agree with you, except this part that got me curious:
---
&gt; Nerfing "the peaks" and "buffing everything" seems like homogenizing everything to be the same, which in my opinion is one of the worst things that can happen to a game. 
---
Why is that bad? If some weapons cannot be used at all (I'm thinking 10mm pistol) they deserve a little buff. Is it homogenizing or just making something usable?
---
And it's weak and useless
---
They’re not removing them they revised that original inside the vault thing. Just FYI if you didn’t already know. And I agree with you. I’m playing less and less anyway. I was fucking retired at level 210. All I wanted to do was hunt legendary creatures the traditional way, push my base building to the limits, and help out new players. Having the guns that enable me to be relaxed in combat and not waste a ton of ammo be rendered 75% less effective sours me on the game. 
---
Yeah it's pretty sad since they were NY favorite weapons in FO4. Like I said though, hopefully that's just a bug like how they forgot to add legendary hunting rifles to the loot-tables lol
---
Are you on now? My PSN is TrundelTheGreat 
---
Monster Mash, Hunter/Hunted, Battle That Never Was.
---
The scenarios you describe are fun but I just don't understand why people are afraid of these events.
---
I’d like to see a competitive mode in the future which has no pvp restrictions and has to start over on desperate servers.
---
PvP worlds, but not until many more patches.
---
YEESSS.
---
Or add something like... "Wood Armor reduced the distance that animals become hostile at"... and a full set makes animals non-hostile
---
I think Bobbleheads are a more significant issue than TSE.
---
TSE is certainly overpowered but people have been carrying thousands of Bobbleheads and consuming several to put their explosive (and I believe non-explosive damage) into the tens of thousands.
---
Besides PvP issues, this represents it also means that players have been able to one-shot the Scorchbeast Queen and Legendary enemies in common farming areas (like Whitesprings Golf Club).
---
The problem with one-shot kills of PvP/PvQ enemies is that other players are unable to contribute and therefore do not gain any loot or XP from kills even if they tried their best.
---
Obviously these issues come across on several layers and my worry is that Bethesda is once again doing a Medusa-style balancing attempt and besides nerfing the weapons, will also end up nerfing Bobbleheads. This will leave the players with the aftereffects of a double-nerf.
---
Also helps that all these kids crying obviously dont understand end game and now we suffer for it. They assume tse is the best thing in the game so it needs nerf. Tse isnt even close to the best dmg in the game. It's just a convienant way to kill pve. Plus with the new fireproof change tse is already useless in pvp so what's to cry about? 
---
From Graham, Harpers ferry and watoga
---
I love it when people resort to insults like fuck-face because it shows they have no valid argument nor vocab to articulate it. 
---
Or just remove it's effect from legendaries, I have a couple TSE guns any they're plenty powerful without the demo expert perks.
---
Anyone buying tse of all things for real money is the biggest tool lmao
---
Omg ima have to disagree. Played my first 70 hours with no melee. Switched because it seemed OP. Now almost always use melee. I don’t even have a Bloodied weapon but the fact that I can put 9 perks into my shotgun and still get less dps than a Death Tambo with no investment is crazy. Not to mention they don’t take ammo so I no longer have to spend hours farming before a big fight. Melee is definitely OP.
---
Legit. Marsupial mutation. This allows you to jump much higher.
---
It’s so funny how many of you made basically the same post and corrections. 
---
Level 30 here, do I not want to do that? 
---
I feel because they're much more tedious to organize than just simply 'running to the bounty marker on the map'. 
---
Big huge lumpy humanoid?  I think I know of a regular spawn.
---
I play on an OG XBONE and have very few issues.  Almost seems like some server I log into are junk and others can play 5 hours and no issue.
---
I saw one poor guy stuck in the outdoor hallway that leads to the rear of the resort STUCK b/c of all the damn Mr Handy's that spawned around him. I watched him try for about 2 mins trying to get out of that situation before he fast traveled away.
---
upvote so bethesda might see
---
It's just one of those things. Is TSE as bad as people claim? Or are the people complaining just louder and larger in number?
---
Tough to say. 
---
Bethesda however is in a spot where ignoring community complaints could look bad, so we may get some undeeded nerfs/buffs.
---
Not saying this is needed or not. Just the state of nerfs/buffs
---
Can we get free for the community 
---
My mic was dead and charging couldn’t tell him before he blocked me from session 
---
Like I said, I've tried those three bots countlessly. No sign of the plan. Brick, yeah, but barn, nope.
---
Legendary !
---
It looks very nice with the sniper outift (1400Atoms)
---
and the Myster Veil. 
---
&gt; But if you take a more tactical approach then snipers and stealth will wreck some TSE shotgunner.
---
That's not rock-paper-scissors. You don't pick "TSE Shotgunner" at the character screen and be stuck with it.
---
&gt; so far challenge equals massive healthpool
---
Monster AI and bulet sponginess are a separate issue that have been discussed a lot since FO3.
---
Beth' please do some research and maybe fire a coder or two! Or at least get in there and put your foot up there collective arses! 
---
Nerf's are never the answer! the game is out 2 month's and the first round of nerf's are pencilled in already :( Look at other ways to fix the issue, once you've nerfed one thing your going to have to nerf another and another and another etc.
---
Please learn from the other companies that have gone before you! yes it's your first online fallout, but you can learn from the others! All customers want is to feel valued and not ignored. If you actually communicate with your players base on a regular basis you would get all of the answers you needed to fix the issues appearing in game.
---
The modern paintings unlock all the animal paintings :/
---
I don’t think they should be needing stuff, it’s gonna make stuff boring and slow, budding weak points instead will mix up the Meta a lot more and keep things more interesting 
---
1.25 shot fizzle guns selling cheap now (not by me)
---
Ill be online in an hour, psn is sirgimps
---
My friend did that haha 
---
Group of people just standing in a circle waiting for someone to move.. Good thing tse got "fixed". 
---
I'm really hoping so. I refuse to be forced into a melee build if I want decent damage. Instead of nerfing dmg theu should have just made two shot and explosive not allowed on the same gun. Simple. Easy. And all guns would still work fine. 
---
Or how about fixing energy guns before you nerf the ballistic guns
---
Its not whinning its just you are not a short sighted mule.
---
Melee will be king again after patch.
---
From reading their post looks like they are nerfing tse so hard many other mods will do more damage. Anti armor, furious, executioner, fire rate bonus
---
Don't worry, after they nerf TSE, everyone will complain how OP melee is and it will get nerfed too
---
Yup.  My Instigating lever rifle accounts for 90% of my kills
---
Just hope my TSE rolling pin stays usable 
---
Looking to buy Jet pack 1k caps for Ps4
---
You even tried melee? Staggers are an unknown factor to gun users
---
Also, don’t **request** nerfs
---
This game’s already nerfing shit left right and centre. I’ll feel like this is a full time job soon (except I’m not getting paid for it) instead of a way to kick back and kill some ghouls
---
There's a difference between someone using a melee build, and a TSE build that is over 75k damage due to an explosive bobblehead glitch. 
---
More incentive to pvp! As of now there is no reason. Bring high reward but high risk events into easily accessible areas to bring the server together.
---
We're not all in agreement that your solutions are the proper way to balance. 
---
Yes and no. It’s an amazing idea I would LOVE to have.
---
No, only because it’s essentially a cap generator. Unless you put your own caps in for the lid, I doubt they will do something like that.
---
&gt; Or maybe you think its ok as-is, and that's fine. 
---
Oh hell no. Couldn't be further from the truth. Just saying the specific suggestion of an AMA is ludicrous even to a layman like myself.
---
Bethesda has already started moving in the right direction with their Inside the Vault series. More so with the most recent one i.e. addressing major concerns, requesting targeted feedback (events) and projecting what's on the horizon. Though they can do a better job on the last one. Right now it's just an announcement of an announcement for the most part.
---
&gt; there's a gap between players talking on this forum and "thanks for the idea, I've passed it on to the devs. 
---
Agree with you 100% with this. Right now it seems communications are HEAVILY centralised with Inside the Vault and the odd occasions that Pete Hines pops his head up as being the only output of comms. 
---
The community managers seem pretty passive (with maybe one or two exceptions like u/lonevaultwanderer) and it seems there role is to gather info for the team and little more.
---
I wished these community managers had some authority to communicate directly with us regarding resolutions or feedback regarding certain issues and concerns we have. Even do like the Hearthstone team does (and I'm sure other games too) and have actual Bethesda devs be active on Reddit and nip concerns in the bud rather than the playerbase working themselves into a frenzy before waiting for the next Inside the Vault.
---
Maybe.
---
I had a whole conversation with lots of laughs in Monster Mash. That event pops pretty consistently and you don't even have to enter the school to see it it's up - the announcer will tell you.
---
It's a big ol' event marker that clearly says (Versus) on it.
---
gave up after season 8....good to know at least!
---
I prefer my Ultracite or Blackbird X0-1... But everyone wears the X0-1 and its jetpack burns through cores. Plus T-51 was my favorite power armor and Ultracite is bigger and meaner. So I stick with the Ultracite, just wish I could paint it.
---
I love the costume idea! 
---
The Respec system is not exactly need friendly. They may need to revisit that.
---
The image of that in my mind did make me laugh, at least.
---
It's around 33k hp, but she has a lot of damage resistance, especially when flying
---
They didn’t really think that. They just wanted to be upset. 
---
Duping is it's own issue not to confuse it with balance 
---
Fixing TSE will help PvP. Battles that are over in 1 second are annoying
---
This would be the way to go! Picking up and dropping items like fallout 4 wouldn't be a good idea for the servers but static props for the camp would be awesome.
---
To clarify for others, dropping non-static objects allows people to cause excessive load on the servers when all the clipping on those individual objects interact. Anybody who played Gmod before prop spawning limits were popular will know what I'm talking about. 
---
I don't have to prove shit. I already got my way, TSE I'd getting nerfed. 
---
I have the plan learned on XB1 if interested. 500 caps plus your resources to install it.
---
I used some mods in fo4, trying to balance it out. Probably getting the numbers wrong but boosting in- and outcoming damage to x3, combined with a x2,5 headshot damage multiplier (helmets better get some armor stats). A base carry weight of like 90, reduced carry weight gain to 5 per strength, and world placed backpacks with around +15 carry weight without nerfs to stat and nerfs to stealth / agility for the bigger ones with like +25 carry weight. Critical hits, based on your luck, naturally happening outside vats.
---
This made every encounter terrifying and forced to make choices and real sacrifices. I really had to rp a character and choose it's gear and playstyle.
---
I could live with permadeath if guns (you can only find placed guns, buy or craft them but the only drops come from legendary enemies), ammo and aid was drastically reduced. BUT: everything put in your stash box would transfer over to a new character. You could slowly grind out your gear to the point you eventually be able to stand a chance to beat the game. Balance wise I'm unsure if learned plans should transfer too or not. But i guess farming those in such a high risk environment should be rewarded so i think transfering them may be justified.
---
Pvp is open at all times, and killing players allowed for looting all their gear, not only junk. Limited carry weight could balance this out. Players shouldn't be shown permanently on the map. You could have something like a ping mechanic, revealing players for a short time on the map in close proximity, with a decent cooldown to that ability. Some quests had to be reworked to prevent camping questgivers to farm on the players turning in the quests.
---
I only use PA in Nuke Zones. Dont like them. 
---
I agree, it makes the other effects perceived as so inferior that those other 2-3 star items just get dumped in bags by the dozen after big events. It can't be the optimal design. 
---
SO you agree.. TSE isnt the issue its a bobblehead glitch?
---
Rose made me appreciate holotapes and terminal entries. I want to eviscerate her. 
---
Just sent you a friend request. Thanks bro, hit me up when you get on
---
Nope.
---
You are a parrot with a victim complex.
---
wat
---
I get staggered by pop-in adds in the middle of reload all the time...
---
Apparently Phoenix in Watoga sells the plan for it but I haven't seen it on him over a few days server hopping.
---
It's a give and take relationship with melee you give a lot of damage but you take a lot as well
---
TSE + explosive bobbleheads stacked for like 40,000 damage let's fix that. 
---
I only do 238 with my Grog Axe nowhere near a OP as you think
---
What is an op melee build anyways? Running a low health build and using bloodied?
---
I just do not understand how people can struggle with the game I literally am playing with no perks and just level 1 specials. There are times I run out of ammo and I just use a melee, even then if it breaks I fist them to death. 
---
I guess if you are not used to this kind of game maybe. Also if an enemy is taking 10 face shots sound more like you are hitting them wrong a normal pip revolver drop will kill humanoid same level mobs in 3 hits. If it is on a protectron yeah that takes 10 but that is because that isn't one of their soft spots. 
---
The mild nerf to TSE is just that it will be an oh no I need to shoot something twice now or worst I have to make sure to have 9 points in my X  weapons perk to achieve the same thing. 
---
So unless you are RPing a specific build and it is pure support the game is easy if you do not rush it. Yeah if you are level 30 you probably shouldn't be messing with level 68s. That takes about 9-10 headshots also from a lvl 30 marksmen hardened sniper rifle no perked (I know this since i did it last night) 
---
Hello all , Im new to this but i have noticed that if i launch a nuke on the scorchbeast queen at level 230 she is unkillable. Now i have experimented with this and had a friend at level 110 launch 1 on the queen and she dies pretty easily. So my question is whether Bethesda is punishing high levels players that enjoy the game to much ? I mean should it not be fair all the way around. 
---
It would be awesome if everything was usable to some degree, or useful in certain situations at least. It just depends on how they do it ultimately. I've seen games go from extremely complex and interesting to everything being the same and it ruined them. At least if you are that 10mm pistol user and you're at a disadvantage compared to some other cookie cutter OP build or weapon and you win it makes it feel that much better when you really master it and become formidable with it. If they can make things interesting and fun it will be good. But if everything just does the same kind of damage then not so much.
---
You should try an instigating gauss rifle:) much higher base damage
---
Or you end up watching something like this:
---
https://youtu.be/C1WwZJpcqLg
---
Had 3 of them so far, all from workshops and defend events. Gave away one today again (got it from Lakeside Cabins).
---
I melee one shot people with tse on the regular, they can't even hurt me.
---
Well the explosive prefix did need a nerf, I'll admit that, but the one it is getting is excessive. Apart from that there is a reason that two shot, bloodied, quad, and explosive (for guns) are pretty much the only requested effects. They are good, and the other effects dont come close and are not worth using.
---
I agree that some high level enemies should be buffed a bit too, it's easier to kill a level 91 deathclaw than a level 50 Scorchbeast and that is ridiculous. By wanting all legendary effects buffed to be near ts and explosive it's a way to get rid of the bullet sponge problem of Scorchbeasts and to make other effects at least useful.
---
I love this idea.
---
I also wouldn't say no to a toy factory either.
---
My prototype on my 204 has never broken either and I got that like 160ish level ago. 
---
It's just getting nerfed into complete oblivion. Melee is untouched and all ranged weapons are getting are nerfs. It's bullshit, people wouldn't have even bitched about the weapons if they were as rare as they were supposed to be, exploiters ruined it for everyone. I won't rest until Bethesda nerfs melee into oblivion too, but that means bloodied will be chopped as well as instigating, so an even shittier situation for firearms.
---
Article was updated some time after my original post. 
---
The monorail is pretty trashed, it would need a lot of work. Besides, public transit doesn't exactly shout "post apocalyptic".
---
I have often wondered why we can build generators that run on gas or fusion, but not a car? We have running engines all over the place, but none of the vehicles in the game function... I suppose it would be hard from a technical standpoint to have player vehicles all over the place, but it would be fun to have sort of Mad Maxed out cars and trucks in our CAMP driveways...
---
With such huge nerfs they really need to buff durability or no one will have a working weapon to finish the scorchbeast queen after shooting 1000 bullets in her.
---
So wait wait wait. Both Effects have been nerfed now?
---
TS from 100% to 25% and 
---
E from 100% to 20% regardless of if they come alone or together. WTF. 
---
So from 200% to 45% nerf...?? Or am I wrong.
---
That's a Game Quitter for me than. Would be 2000+ Rounds for the Queen now to see the bar go down by 1%.
---
They might as well be.
---
Lucky. All I get is shit like jukebox and metal box over, and over, and over again.
---
I’m sure the time other people spend on Netflix or whatever is waaaay healthier lol. 
---
Was it any think like this guy's 3\* rolling pin?

---
I started playing 76 with the intent to go melee primarily. I had a blast doing that in fallout 4.
---
The lack of a "lunge" perk killed it for me, I'd rather gun everything down at range than soak shots sprinting to enemies.
---
I'm not saying melee is not overpowered. I will say that the power seems for the most part useless outside a few select enemy types, as ranged does enough damage to rapidly clear most enemies at higher level. 
---
It is one of the most evil and trolling quests ever devised. Vault-tec approves.
---
&gt;   I think this game would be nearly impossible with 1 strength and 2 luck
---
\*Hold my beer\*
---
Lol, but i do agree that if the build mechanics (as well as repair ones) require mass amounts of junk it's not going to walk itself to your camp. F4 had companions so they could accommodate that extra weight, but yeah, I do find the desire to up Strength each character for the carry ability at the earlier levels.
---
Someone got there bolt stuck...
---
Never had a TSE and I play since first beta. I only have one TS weapon, a Radium rifle. It's my favorite weapon atm and not that powerful, no explosive shots or anything. It's just slightly better than the other rifles. And now it will be worthless. :(
---
yeap.  They complain TSE because that what they see.  Its what is ever in front of their noses.
---
You can blame the greifers, every game with full loot open world PvP lost either players anf the game went to shit or they opened a PvE shard and the PvP server lost players anyway.
---
The asshole in the stupid clown mask camping vault 76 waiting for the level 2, to the asshole in xsyon that camped the spawns for new players and destroys them when they leave their base. Or the asshole in mortal online and every PvP game that abused the mechanics and just go after bambi. These are the same assholes that chicken out when a  PKKer shows up and they log off.
---
Pvpers in old mmo games use to have honor. now it's mostly just stupid gankers and griefers, that wont engage you unless they have zero chance of losing.
---
Chances are those players will stay on pve and continue to do the little bullshit they do cause they are too chicken to actually play the game with a chance of losing.
---
This is awesome, thanks SO much for taking the time to put this together for us! I was wondering why some mods worked on some parts but not on others.
---
I support this. Want to experiment a bit with my build but I literally have to use 4 levels and buy 9 of the same perk to reduce it by 1 rank.
---
You pick it as your build and weapon of choice. Which is basically like a class in this game, you're just not stuck with it. 
---
This is true. I just wish it wasnt the case. Thank you for your polite responses. 
---
I disagree with the melee but every other gun and class needs a serious buff I do agree... You try closing the gap getting shot by mobs of adds to kill one or two to reopen and try again.... However don't grief a melee closing the gap on one enemy is fine 😂 
---
Unless they don't have marsupial and a jetpack like me
---
Press f for respect 
---
It's a cowboy standoff
---
If you use keep Gunsmith rank 5 on and repair guns to 200% they last a freaking long time
---
Wow, finally found someone with more hours than me. LOL my paltry 650 hours seems small fry now. PS4 too, so with 1500 hours between us we may have even been on the same server before.
---
My only two shot weapon is my lmg (not explosive) since it's the only thing that made it usable. Now I'm probably gonna have to stash it again.
---
Upadated the post!
---
That is really weird
---
Events:
---
As a higher-level player, here's what I'd like to see from events:
---
1. Tiered difficulty.  It's great that there's events for low-level and mid level players, but at level 200+, there's a distinct lack of threat from PVE.   I want bad-ass monsters that do high-damage and make me use effective *tactics* rather than just a bunch of ammo.  I want to fail sometimes, but the rewards should be worth it when I do win.  
---
2.  Events that are strictly cooperative or competitive.   Maybe don't start the clock on a co-op event until at least 4 players join, and make them work together to complete it.  Good examples are Uranium Fever and Feed the People, but those can be completed solo.  Up the difficulty and rewards and push players to that "heck yeah!" moment where working together pays off.   Conversely, let players compete against each other to complete similar portions of an event to see who can do something the best.  Reward skill, not damage output or resistance.  Events like Lode Bearing would be perfect for this, as each player could defend a miner (and simultaneously perform some other task), and whichever auto-miner team gets the most tokens gets bonus tokens, or bonus rewards.
---
3.  Let us affect Appalachia and rebuild!  Server-wide effects and rewards are really immersive!  Maybe we could get a "server status" tab on the map menu?  Obviously the effects should be temporary,   The "Powering up" events are great start for this, as they provide power boxes to certain regions, but let's do more!  Maybe have factories that can temporarily produce Nuka-Cola products or Medical Supplies that the whole server can collect.
---
4.  Weekly C.A.M.P. and clothing reward events!  Lots of folks like to build and change outfits!  So give us temporary (or some permanent) special items that we can build, display. or wear for a week.  
---
Thank you for listening and giving us the opportunity to be part of the game building experience!
---
It's a good community
---
Completely 
---
Well there is a downside to being a melee character, you can die pretty easily because your up in peoples faces 
---
Welcome 
---
Not telling you.  You will want it nerfed.
---
Just give us a Dark zone similar to the Division. 
---
Rare loot and junk that you have to "extract" back to your camp.
---
I don't understand why we can't have down be emotes and keep the 3 slots on up, left and right as before. It's not better on console, either.
---
Well, the max caps you could *trade at one time* was 5k, but it was certainly possible to sell things for more than that. And yeah, I'm certain I do use more ammo.
---
Untested, as i dont have unyelding or cranberry relish recipe yet. BUT i did test the rest and its adding up. As soon as i have the ability ill post a screenshot of all the bonuses together.
---
You dont take any damage...  PA is OP.  Nerf that too!
---
I don't know what you're doing, but you're doing it wrong.
---
Ultima Online was different, though. They had Felucca and Trammel on the same shard (server). You had to go through a portal to travel from one to the other, but you could do so freely as long as you had the portal stones.
---
There were far fewer players (mostly Red e.g. wanted players), but resources and housing places were more plentiful there, making it tempting for even peaceful players to dip their toes into pvp.
---
Honestly, the recipe is garbage. Takes like 3 stimpaks, some antiseptic, some other stuff, and a disease cure, to make something that, for all intents and purposes, is just a disease cure.
---
Updated!
---
Well, I also did a lot of defend events. Have my camp near this dried out lake and often take the cabins and the airport nearby. Got some good stuff from those, but might have gotten everything now since I only see duplicates lately.
---
Lol it's already possible to nearly negate melee damage.
---
You know that perk Blocker that's been in since launch? Use it. Combined with other perks like Lone Wanderer, Dodgy and Assassin or Sentinel armor and you'll see how little a a threat you're able to make melee.
---
And you can do it WITHOUT Bethesda intervening with a patch.
---
That speaks volumes on how big a problem TSE weapons actually are.
---
So boohoo, those of you using TSE as a crutch are now at the same level as everyone else playing the game.
---
&gt; bullet sponge problem of Scorchbeasts
---
Or just reduce the health of scorchbeasts, make one change instead of a dozen.
---
If it's even really the problem... Scorchbeasts die really quickly when they land. If they didn't spam the screech attack which makes them not land and also makes them very hard to hit (hard to hit what you can't see) this kind of change might not even be necessary.
---
We are mostly on the same page, and i agree with Inside the Vault being a good start, with CMs having authority being a logical next step. We differ on how we view accountability and risk, and its all good.  My view is they launched it, they own it, stand by it. Use your video firewall idea, or the AMA proposal. But do something better and more detailed than what we have now. On that you and I are solid. Thank you.
---
Im not arguing but how are you weighing 1100lb? 
---
I play similar hours, due to disability. I'm supposed to hide my disability? Gaming helps me cope and because of that i put a LOT of hours in. But I guess I should never say that in public right?
---
Correction,  melee will be the only OP way to play if you want the game on EZ mode. Guns will still be viable
---
You're lucky. On console it's damned near impossible to slam a radaway in combat, other chems are just out of the question. Want to switch between more than two weapons? Good luck with that.
---
I second this. My TSE lmg does maybe 300 and my TSE gauss does 1.7k and that's running every possible perk, which sucks. Given 1.7 is alot it still doesn't one hit everything that moves. 
---
Pvp should be a setting on character creation
---
It was hilarious they even got the voices down for how they often act 
---
I guess if this is what "the community" wants then fine.  However it seems that even though I play daily, you are playing with a very different community than I am.
---
When after a bit over the 250 hour mark I finally got a TSE.  And guess what I did with it?  Started launching queens daily for the server.  Because hey now it's OK if a couple under prepared curious people show up.  I will still do it but probably not as much with this change.  Is it OP yea, but it had a use for me and was kinda fun.
---
I realize I am a for the most part a solo PVE guy and there are many other that play different.  We all have to give a little fun for the rest of our diverse player population.
---
Here is what I would like going forward.  Use a survey and like those little messages we get logging in.  Say hey we want to see what all of you active players would like, ge here.  Then make those poll results public.  So we don't have to go to a forum that not everyone uses.  Only active players would know it exists.  And we all get to see what the active community would like to see.  Just an idea.  I want to glitch, cheat be OP sometimes and do what I want with my game because it's fun to me by my self.  But I have to share with others and we all deserve to have fun.
---
How the hell do you have 1,100lbs of crap on you?? What are you carrying around? 
---
Because 2 out of 3 you listed have no long term play value whatsoever.  MM and BTNW are fun with enough people - a couple times at most and you're sick of them.  A game like this, with PvP touted as a core feature, with a player/fan-base as big as Fallout, needs at least a couple dozen varieties of these sorts of events/scenarios to cycle through to avoid monotony.
---
They aren't even touching bobbleheads?!? Melee?!? What the fuck? The exploiters ruined it for everyone because Bethesda seems to only listen to the whiny little bitches and casuals who get demolished by something op they couldn't put the time in to earn, and then bitch on the forums about op griefers and TSE weapons ruining the game. Fuck dupers. And fuck these whiners too, guess what? They can still one shot the queen, just need 4x the BOBBLEHEADS now. Melee doesn't even need too much at all, and they can still ONE SHOT YOU. Also, my armor makes me completely immune to damage, TSE weapons or BE weapons were the only things that could even sometimes touch me. And now those are getting nerfed into oblivion so I'm gonna be SUPER invincible! 
---
I have over 1,300 stimpaks and carry all my ammo on me
---
I won't be gambling with you then
---
&gt; you're just not stuck with it.
---
"Stuck with it" is how RPS balance works. You have an insurmountable weakness. It lets everybody be a "winner" 50% of the time.
---
If you have the option to change but you don't... that's on you.
---
Calling DayZ PvP-centred makes the OP clueless. Also, calling the PvE easy as it comes? Haha, try playing it now. The zombies are tougher than they’ve ever been.
---
Ok
---
Here is a guide I made for starting new characters:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agdwy7
---
You either enjoy the process of leveling or you don't. 
---
If you don't, the respec mechanics are there for you.
---
1,300 stimpaks 
---
If you're on PS4 I can look for you. I see it at vendors a lot. It'll be about 380 caps, less if I pop a Grape Mentats first.
---
Well by workshop I do mean defend events also. Every session I takeover like 3 or 4 and then just let it trigger. Always the same shitty plans.
---
All i know about food and water is if I play for 8 hours I need to eat about 40 pounds of food and drink about 60 bottles of water.
---
When you buy an expensive item from a vendor, a portion of that purchase goes into the vendor's available caps to trade. That's why I first sell 200 caps worth of gear to vendors, and then purchase an expensive plan or item. When the vendor has more caps available, I can then sell more stuff to the same vendor.
---
Yeah, an air drop at Mama Dolce's would give me a reason to stop by that area, and possibly get to interact with some newer players.  As it stands, I have to "chase down" new players through Xbox messages or try to talk/emote to them when I visit the Forest area.
---
Unless Bethesda specifically asked you to break there game push it in every direction it wasn't supposed to go then ima going to go out on a limb and say nope, your ban along with everyone else's will be in your email soon(tm).
---
All these posts with people trying to get out ahead of there duping exploits makes me lol have some balls man, you used an exploit in a game whilst knowing you shouldn't. Stand by your choices, or man up apologise and grip. Get ready to take whatever they give you (Lol) and get over it, if they ban you maybe in your next game when there's an exploit going round you'll remember trying to give Bethesda a reach around so they don't ban you and think better off it hey ;)
---
You should put your platform 
---
I bought the walls from the Watoga vendor. It's been awhile though so there is a chance I purchased them from a different vendor.
---
Agreed, it is stupid. I seriously had to make a new character, get it to level 12 and the make my way over to Harper's Ferry to find it. It only took about an hour of server hopping to find it but an hour is far too much. It's a stupid mechanic and I drew the line with the handmade, screw looking for shocks and jetpacks.
---
ALL THE YES.
---
Nah, PC. Thanks for the offer, though.
---
hmm true. There was also the abandoned housing decay that people would fight over.
---
While Bloodied is risky, the build was already pretty popular to reach really high damage output because of stacking multiple damage effects. After this patch if the proposed changes are final I can see Bloodied Explosive being the the "god roll" for guns. Explosive is still preferred for major modifier because even nerfed it is still stronger than the rest of the rather bad effects, except maybe crit damage for crit builds. Imo the nerf to two shot makes it not worth the tradeoff of bad accuracy for 25% damage. Even Anti-armor would be more preferable
---
&gt;With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage
---
With this patch, will Two Shot guns be renamed to One and a Quarter Shot guns? Doesn't make much sense for a weapon that shoots an entire extra bullet to do any less damage than the same amount of damage as the other bullet. If I have a single fire weapon like a hunting rifle that normally does 100 damage, firing a 2nd bullet should do 200 damage, and increase of 100% damage. However if I have a 4 shot weapon like the Dragon and it does 400 damage (100 per each of the 4 balls), the 2shot variant should fire a 5th ball for 500 damage, which would be +100% the damage of a single balls, or +25% the overall damage. Basically the extra bullet/ball should do the full extra damage of a single extra round being fired.
---
As far as the 2shot explosive  weapons go, the explosive part should definitely be reduced, to make other build more viable.
---
With reducing damage output of explosive damage, the Queen's damage reduction should be reduced as well. With all the overpowered weapons currently out there, the queen I still a pain to kill
---
Nuke fort defiance!
---
Yea, I'm not looking forward to this. I have a 2 shot gatling. Not explosive or bloodied or anything other than 2 shot. I have all 3 heavy gun perks on. It does around 250 damage. It's nice but far from game breaking. Now the TSE heavy 50 cal my mate gave me...is dumb overpowered. I only use it when fighting the queen and even then it will more than likely kill me because the recoil can send bullets at my feet or a  deathclaw jumps in front of me. 
---
Yeah, I used to have my CAMP near there, and if I saw a few noobs in Flatwoods, I would help them run it really fast for the xp and stimpaks.
---
Anyone buying 2 shot explosive?
---
My rebuttal on this, is that this is a post apocalyptic world, a world in which the raider is you, there are no rules and the world is unfair. I would love to have some of the most op things in the game but I don’t have time for all of that. This is not the anyone’s fault but mine for the life I chose. It the Bethesda Charm.
---
Yeah I heard that, its no good
---
And here I thought carrying around 300ish was a lot 😂 do you use traveling pharmacy perk? 
---
Saving the thread. If I get one again, I'll think of you (also playing on PC).
---
Oh. Didn't realize it was a secret, just did some googling and can't really find anything about melee builds after December. Now I'm just a little bit interested :)
---
Uugghh nerfing is uncool
---
Keep replying 
---
I had an interesting experience with someone nuking Harper's Ferry.  It didn't do much to the town itself, but there were lots of fairly rare irradiated plants that showed up in the surrounding swamps.  The power station north of town also kept spawning really high level glowing enemies as players joined, which was pretty cool.  Got a nice three start deathclaw gauntlet off some legendary fog crawler there.
---
Are you some type of anal magician? Pretty impressive how you pulled that number from out of your ass.
---
With my second character I'm not doing missions at all.  I'm just killing stuff for XP.  I'm only level nine, and it's hard to even imagine doing missions with such a week character. 
---
Couldnt have been better said
---
TSE, melee, sentinel/assassin's are just a drop in the lake. PvP is an issue because this game is built for PvE but includes PvP. Just a basic problem - damage is scaled off the level difference, seemingly completely ignoring your gear. There are low level TSEs and other god-tier effects out there. A level 60 with a furious lmg or something would get destroyed by a level 30 with a tse lmg. That's if they were equally matched. With the damage scaling, the level 60 would barely be able to get a shot off, even with its ridiculous fire rate
---
Running into a problem where Glowing Mass weighs 2.0 to my stash when it's listed as .2.  It is filling up my stash while it is only acting like .2 to my character inventory.  This happened since the latest update on PS4.
---
U/lonevaultwanderer
---
Yesterday with an explosive combat rifle with full 2x durability i shot the queen non stop until the very last minute. She literally died in the last minute with over 10 people present. My weapon broke in the last 2 minutes, i wasted like 400 bullets, i ended up punching her face with my bare fists luckily others shot her too and she finally died. Now with the explosive nerf i doubt anyone will be able to kill her in time without reaching a poing where everyone's weapon is broken.
---
I haven’t received any emails pertaining this issue yet. Does it come later?
---
Happened to me on my first nuke launch cause I was running the silo and someone wanted to do SBQ and I didn’t, they came in and stole the silo from me right at the end. Even used my keycard. All they did was run to the panel put in the code and do the launch.
---
Pretty much yes. Add unyielding and some perks and you can get all your specials (except endurance) up to 40+. That’s how people get their melee damage up to 15-20k
---
It's the exploiters fault. I have a TSE that dropped for me, never duped, never traded. I farmed for days and days for this. I threw out and sold weapons that would probably now be better now. I feel cheated. These weapons would never have been bitched about by all the casuals without the time to farm, if they were as rare as they were intended to be.
---
This nerd is 100% the fault of the dupers. Bethesda is punishing them and by extension alot of innocent people that EARNED their god tier weapon. Also the only thing that can even compete with melee so let's talk about why in the fuck melee isn't being touched or bitched about nearly as much.
---
Maybe an event where you have to like hunker down in an area and defend it for a period of time. I'm not talking about one of those occasional events at workshops where some enemies attack you and it's a bit lackluster, but maybe one where you defend a hotspot, for instance, a generator or bomb being powered up, and there's maybe some things nearby to help you, for instance manually activated traps or turrets you can fire around the place.
---
Oh, and a boss-like enemy event would be cool. Not like the scorchbeast queen shit that takes forever and it constantly heals health, but an enemy that has unique attacks, a decent amount of health, but not a bullet sponge amount, and unique drops. Instead of just a bunch of crappy weapons and whatnot, maybe have it drop some unique apparel, or weapons, or something that can only make it available by doing that event alone, but don't make the drops overpowered or really rare. I don't want people selling boss drops for like 3k caps or real money. That's fucked up.
---
I hate the events where you have to go to a workshop and kill a bunch of enemies there. It's a waste of time, ammo, and health. They aren't even that rewarding!
---
Probably Feed the People. It's fun to play an event that can affect the map, and its players. I like having people all getting their pay, no matter what it is. Even if it was a measly cup of food, it was worth it.
---
Bethesda, for love of god please give us some information on if and when you plan to raise the stash limit. When you initially raised it you stated it was the first increase and you would look to see how it affected the servers and stability. 
---
I know some players are good with the stash limit size but many of us really want a stash weight increase. With all the junk it takes to do the various crafting, repairs, and mods my stash is primarily filled with crafting items. I really have no room hold weapons, especially heavy weapons I might like to use later.
---
Also chrck your spam folder for any emails from Bethesda 
---
Been looking myself now for a very long time. It's almost as if they don't exist anymore. 
---
The thing I don't get is that a hazmat offers 1000 rad resist. I get my character and use rad shields till they're at 1500 rad resist but yet I still get a considerable about off radiation, and yes I know it's a nuked area and in reality you can't just walk in with a bunch of meds in you, BUT yet this is a game that takes place in the future where everyone has a needle that can fix broken limbs in a second (stimpaks). So I know that they are just trying to make power armor a much bigger thing in game unless you want walk in there naked.
---
Yeah because everyone is level 200 with all relevant perk cards maxed out and has all top tier 3 star weapons in their inventory and can just change to whatever in the heat of the moment. Or rather people build around a certain weapon and use that primarily. Yeah.... And that doesn't have any weakness that someone elses build can counter in rock paper scissors fashion. Totally.
---
Yep plus the strong back, bandolier, the junk weight reducing one, and the armor reduction perk. All are maxed out so I have them all always equiped. Without my armor or other weight reduction perks I weigh over 1,600 pounds. I run around at about 245 with a carry weight of 330 at any given time.
---
Don’t they need to send one?
---
I used my TSE when wandering alone to make quick work of mobs while trying to get from point A to Point B, never used it in PvP and always switched to non-legendary max level weapon while doing events with others.   I have also witness the terror of watching friends base get demolished by a group of TSE shotgun wielders.  
---
So not everyone up in arms over this used them to be pricks but the few that have are what caused this.  “One Bad Apple Ruins The Bunch”
---
And never have to pee or 💩
---
I’m really really disappointed with their decision. BUT if you go re-read the inside the vault, they changed their words. Apparently there has been so much hate today on reddit that they retracted two-Shot no longer being a drop.
---
Tnx, homie.
---
Once they put this patch in, that will probably be it for me, I love the fallout series, but this game had drove me insane between the stealth nerfs, disconnects, forcing players to server hop to obtain plans &amp; mods, &amp; the fact that Bethesda let the duping thing get so out of hand that now the weapons I worked &amp; fought for are getting a 75 percent nerf. Damn them for trying to turn this awesome franchise into  some PUBG or fortnite clone, I guess I'm headed back to Fallout 4 modded at the end of the month, I wonder how many more are planning to do the same... 
---
I said in my post that regular vehicles would take away from the post apocalyptic feel and then you said Mad Max and now i feel like an idiot lol 
---
I found plans in the wild down south at one of the mine shafts or air purifier sites (not sure which). Maybe someone dumped a set there? But might be worth exploring those sites.
---
Yes, and yes... Been there since beta
---
They could just limit the amount of turrets you can place in the C.A.M.P. If that's such a problem for them. Plus nobody really cares about destroying bases anyway. 
---
You're doing it totally wrong why the fuck do you need 1100 pounds of shit. Only time I ever crossed 260 was at whitesprings or prime. And that's before I respecced to 1str. 
---
You need better inv management. Period. Melee is legit the most OP build in the game until they rework the guns. 
---
Tilted Towers.
---
Thats...... not how it works.......
---
I'm a hoarder of stimpaks haha plus I give some away to lower level players when I come across them. I hated running out of them and having to ration them out so I just started diluting left and right haha
---
Dont blame the griefers, blame the lame games. The only good full loot games ive seen are mortal online and darkfall, and they also have tons of issues.
---
In full loot games you dont have griefers, you have aggressive participants. 
---
For mortal online, going after bambi was a huge motivator to play the game right. Find a guild, join a group, and hide until you can compete. This was known going into it, so you had to work around those who would kill fresh meat. The game had tons of other issues that lead to its death.
---
When did pvpers in mmo have honor? I remember getting gank camped in vanilla WoW constantly
---
And even still, I havent played a single game where people will only fight you if they are garunteed the win. I mean, just attack them and theyll fight back.
---
In MO id often go out with cheap gear to find someone with better gear so I could take it off them
---
But I agree, abusable flag crap sucks 
---
I’ll usually send the lower level players a message after I’ve left stuff near Morgantown or flat woods.  That reduces their fear levels.  Of course I did have to block a squeaker after that.
---
Do all those stimpacks give you joy?
---
That would be nice.
---
Being able to display my swag on power armor racks would be good as well.
---
Do you remember if it was the station vendor (south part) or the shopping center one (north part)? 
---
Bloodied will no doubt be nerfed if only because of melee. Gun users are gonna get double fucked.
---
Tnx for the info.
---
i get the same thing but it’s not that bad, doesn’t happen often enough to annoy me 
---
Charisma doesn't boost XP, intelligence does.
---
We might have found the problem, Jim.
---
I'll give you mine, XBox?
---
It needed some balance but they will hit it too hard make make it worthless.   TSE isnt the issue here.  Its not even near the most OP thing in the game.  It just kills trash mobs fast.  
---
Range needs more viability.  Melee is far superior.  
---
I feel like most of the TSE hate is from PVP which should not even be in this game or be completely separate.  PVP and PVE ALWAYS means balance issues and a bland not fun either of them. 
---
no idea mate. most of the time if you try to click craft anyway it will have a pop up tell you why you cant build it. 
---
That's what I mean. In fallout 4 you had companions to help you lug around junk, but in Fallout 76,  it's doubtful that anyone will help you lug around junk because you team mates are close to being over encumbered themselves. 
---
And in Fallout 76, you need way more junk that Fallout 4. In fallout 4 you didn't have to actually build entire weapons and ammo. 
---
Still won’t do most of them
---
Have enough Recipe: Mirelurk Cake already
---
Really nice work.
---
&gt;I just do not understand how people can struggle with the game
---
That's because you are playing, and seeing the game from your perspective. People are different, with different skill sets. Some are very good at staying alive in this game like you, and other people keep complaining about running out of stimpaks because the enemies are so hard to fight.
---
&gt;The mild nerf to TSE
---
The nerf of two shot bullets will go from damaging +100% to +25%. That's a 75% decrease in damage, not something I would call "mild". Same goes for explosive damage, which goes from +100% explosive damage to only +20% and having an even smaller area of effect. An 80% damage reduction is not something I would call a "mild nerf". 
---
And I am used to this kind of game. I have played over 3500 hours of Fallout games combined, I just think Bethesda are confused about how the balance from singleplayer to multiplayer should have been executed. 
---
And you are also right, if I am a level 30 player, I shouldn't be messing with max level enemies. But they will spawn out of nothing, especially if a higher level player is nearby, sometimes you just don't have a choice, which is most of the time. 
---
Did you press the button to make them anyways? I know plans show grayed out even if you don't know them sometimes I just press A and learn it. 
---
So? With fireproof and dense armor it made tse useless in pvp. Melee will be nerfed next to cap damage as well to make it "balanced"
---
I am beginning to think this too. Been looking for weeks in all the recommended places.
---
That's how I feel. xD  I saw them and brick as uncommons, then they fixed the Free States bug and now I never see barn but I still see bricks around. I've also seen metal a few times on vendors.
---
Yes, I'm hoping to God that my bloodied explosive Gauss isn't a paperweight after this patch. But they are nerfing explosive down to 25% of what it used to be? Or is it the demolition expert card getting nerfed?
---
Check your spam folder, if you used any exploits, that's what this is about. If you didn't there is an appeal process outlined in the email. It would be the email associated with the bethesda.net account.
---
Check your spam folder.
---
Long live the ban-wave.
---
got it, I though I was missing something thanks. hopefully they fix that sometime soon. its not terribly annoying but annoying enough. 
---
OK.
---
No just no, no one wants that. Although the exterminator legendary effect will be in high demand then
---
So you have to switch a few times. So what? I know it’s a bit annoying but at least it no longer demolishes your camp when you have your spot. It’s not a big deal. 
---
I think I got one from that same spot...went back hoping to get the outfit that goes with it...but no luck.
---
Just carry a bunch of toys
---
Hey, use blocker 
---
I  completely agree with what you are saying!                 
---
Right that's why I said they should give new and better rewards
---
Definitely seems like that would be an easy solution with the added benefit of not having to completely remove a legendary effect.
---
Right. Im a solo player. Rifle build. Mirelurk queens are tougher than scorch beasts, and it takes too many resources to drop one. If this game was meant for solo and team play, why is my strongest weapon getting axed? 
---
Which trailer is this? Been trying to look for it to know which outfit you're talking about
---
I doubt it, nobody has found a legendary chainsaw as far as I'm aware. I don't think it's in the drop pool
---
Why specifically wood armor? Is it statically better for stealth or more of a looks thing?
---
So waste 5 points just so your gun wont break, because a ranged weapon should never last one full boss battle without breaking at the last 10% of boss, I have 1 plain two shot handmade which is getting a 40% damage nerf, so now instead of needing 1000 rounds over 10 minutes for SBQ I now need 1400 rounds, 14 minutes to do the same damage, and 5 points assigned to nothing but stopping my gun breaking halfway through the fight.
---
Did you have GS5 perks on?
---
Hey, use blocker
---
Even nerfed it's still effectively more damage per shot than the +10% DMG by aiming, by a base of 15%, before perks are taken into account.
---
For bobble heads, only the explosive stacks.  And having that many isn't nearly the same problem if you take out the duping.  If they just fix the bug with it stacking it wouldn't be nearly as big an issue.  AFAIK they're going to fix that.  Hopefully they do.
---
Honestly though you can 1-shot anything except the queen without any buffs with a TSE shotgun.  It's again the duping that makes the problem terrible since now everyone has one.
---
I'll just leave this here because you are one of the exact crybabies I am referring to.

---
The point being Melee is already in the place TSE
---
is going to be in and calling for it to be nerfed even further just reeks of salt.
---
Man if only there was a cola plant in the game
---
That would have been a time saver but I'm on PC. xD   Thanks anyway though!
---
Uninstall and reinstall fixed it for me. I rebooted the console after uninstalling then reinstalled.
---
There are some instructions to rebuild the database out there too, but that didn't work for me. 
---
How would blocker increase gun damage? That doesn't even make sense 
---
that does nothing to change the fact SG's benefit more from explosive than other guns.  They would have to also change explosive on shotguns to divide the damage by the # of pellets.   
---
At the moment you get 8 (iirc) pellets per shot and each gets explosive, so lets just say for the sake or argument if you get a total of 100 bonus damage from explosive legendary effect, a shotgun gets +800 damage because it gets the 100 per pellet and there's 8 pellets per shot.  
---
Compare this to any other gun with 1 projectile, you would get just 100 damage bonus from explosive using the above value so the SG is 800% more powerful.  
---
tp resolve this they would give each pellet 12.5 explosive damage so now both the single projectile rifle/handgun etc and the SG will both have 100 bonus damage from explosive.
---
1) True, but the most common issue people are having with this is individuals hyped up on bobbleheads one-shoting passive players from hiding. Any risk of splash damage is eliminated
---
2) There are many TSE weapons with higher fire rates than the dragon.
---
3) The rarity of TSE drops is immaterial with the ongoing problem of duping.
---
4) Ammo is plentiful and can easily be crafted or purchased.
---
Now, does that mean I disagree with you? No. I think the two shot should have been left alone and the stacking of bobbleheads and magazines stopped - or at least limited to something reasonable like 2 or 3 on the same effect. 
---
yeah but the most caps you’d get is 20 per hour lol. not really worth it
---
Deathclaw island
---
Which is great for sbq when she lands, if you're at low health and not in radiation and then only until you die (if you die).
---
It seems overkill on pretty much anything else, and a lot more fussing than just blasting away at enemies at range.
---
So you guys play the game with the rest of us? This is all wrong. 2 shot is fine, explosive is also fine in most cases. The exception I would say is shotguns where the explosive effect is multiplied by the number of pellets.
---
This Nerf will basically ruin my pistol character. And now my shotgunner will have to buy shells in bulk.
---
It's probably been stated 10 times in this thread alone, but nobody cares about pvp. Just turn it off.
---
THANK YOU!!! they can do it.. they do so with armor and weapons that do move or less to pvp players. nerfing TSE in PVE is dumb
---
You can try and pull the disability card, but I'm 100% VA-rated and also receiving SSDI, yet I'm still able to realize that spending more than half of every day playing a game is not healthy. I seriously can't count the number of randoms I've teamed with where I hear spouses/familiy in the background yelling at them because the game is all they care about and all they do all day.  
---
So sure, spend your time how you wish, but don't cry when people comment on it when you share how much time that is. it's the internet. 
---
What should happen to the ones that already exist?
---
Hmm... BREAK it in early test application 🤔 did you preorder it? I know I did because from Todd himself this is your chance to break the game for us. Did you watch the e3 announcement?
---
Which part, me mistaking the helpful person for the unhelpful person?  Or going along with what seemed like a plausible scenario of people getting 1-shot due to insane amounts of duped bobble heads?  Guess that makes me a moron.
---
Just use blocker 
---
No... I didn’t see a change
---
I like to think of it as the character tripping or stumbling over the environment, it keeps the immersion going. 
---
Just nerf everything, make it all deal 1 damage so its even.
---
Has anyone on the Xbox had trouble with the hornwright estate elevator not spawing in?. I have the key card and can open the door to the elevator but can't do anything else. 
---
Restarting the game doesn't fix it either.
---
Lvl 102 mostly melee perhaps I should revisit my perks because I constantly take damage and have to quick stim......
---
pvp needs to go.  It always kills pve having pvp in it as well.
---
When I wrote my post no one had replied yet and I made it clear that I didn't know if it was because leveling or a bug, so I'm not contributing to misinformation. If you didn't understand that then its up to you. It doesn't matter if you believe or not, I was getting warnings on my screen telling I coudn't place anything else because it would exceed my camp's budget and later I was able to place a lot more stuff. If Bethesda post here that leveling does not increase budget that's great as it will finally answer OP's question, but doesn't change the fact that I could build more stuff as time passed. I had loads of bugs happening in my camp since the beta and this could be one of those. And I did say so in my first post. 
---
Damn you Pavlov
---
Seems to be an issue with taming animals, you can't tame anything over lvl 35 or so, no matter what your level is, how much build space you have left, nor how high your Charisma is.
---
LOL. I have a one shot exploder and nerfing it to 25% seems just about right.
---
 A level 25 Combat Shotgun that has double capacity and explosive bullets. 
---
 Completely changes the game. By accident got the golf ghouls to attack me, a level 28 player. Wiped em' out and harvested maybe 6 Legendaries. ;)
---
Not how what works?
---
Because that's exactly how legendary effects work.  There's three "groups" of legendary effects and it's only possible to get one legendary effect from each group.  Effects like Bloodied and Two Shot are in the first group that serves as the base for all legendary weapons.  Two star legendary weapons then get an effect from either group 2 or group 3 and three stars get an effect from all three.
---
How'd you get the Responder firefighter outfit?
---
Try this:  Go over to your stash in f close by and dump all junk.  I had this happen last night while trying to build a lever action, had all components and perks but the level I wanted was grayed out.  Went over and dumped my junk into stash and then was able to build the weapon.  Not sure why, it just worked.
---
If you try to defend yourself or choose revenge on respawn then you are agreeing to PvP and they will not get a wanted status.
---
Yah it made no sense, but they seem to have rectified it at least. I mean it still doesn't address the fact that other guns are still behind all the rest.
---
Test bag? Never did that. Just drop everything I want to give away in one go. Never failed.
---
Ok I'll try that
---
I'll take you up on that, though I don't get home from work til about 4 hours from now. Will you be available then?
---
Yep. Nothing pops up. I just added more lead, and now it will let me make 308, but still not shotgun. 
---
That shouldn't be possible 
---
I’ll offer 3 caps over!
---
Well, the TS element is getting nerfed, so that will weaken them a bit. In another comment I suggested changing the explosive prefix so it no longer benefits from the demolition perk. Maybe just set it so that "explosive" gives a small AoE explosion equal to 25% of the weapon's damage, so they' still be powerful, but not "fuck up everything in one shot" powerful.
---
i have 2 2\* furious western revolvers that I want to RP as a gunslinger. sadly duel wield isn't a thing
---
Getting on now, send ivt plz
---
Best idea I've heard all week. Building a big camp specifically designed to help other players and then getting the entire thing trashed by some asshole while you're away is the worst feeling. And perks like Wrecking Ball are just encouraging that crap. Not cool. I don't do it to others, and I don't want it done to me.
---
In game or Irl 
---
Yep, no instructions, it just says I lack the materials to make the item. But...I don't.
---
Straight to 20% is pretty hash as a nerf, I know they've never done a multiplayer game before and the percentage on this nerf seems like it but do it in incriments not just a smashing of 80%
---
Maybe make it so you need to ng+ to enable PvP
---
Duping and the fact TSE weapons as they are now are two different subjects that I pointed out in my post are completely disparate. Removing duping and making bobbleheads not stack is the solution to the problem you bring up. Such an extreme reduction in damage is not a solution to exploits.
---
So, is my AA ,vats crit ,reload speed Dragon OP now?
---
thank you my thicc man
---
You mean like if they had a budget system to limit how many you could place? /s again since it went so well the first time.
---
&gt; Level 50 Somerset Special 
---
This ... exists? Where/how?
---
I completely agree
---
For 1 you need to only use the lv 1 version of the slugger perks.  You only get an extra 30% at an investment of 6 extra perk points whereas you have 30% tied up in 3.  Also there's no reason to have that many stimpaks ever. I carry at most 30 on me and that's usually plenty
---
Yep, that totally worked. WTF with these bugs. Thanks for the help!
---
Well that's the downside of melee. Doesn't mean that it should deal ten times the damage of a Gauss rifle to compensate. That's not how it works in real life and it shouldn't be balanced that way here. Also anyone can be pretty much invincible melee or not with sentinel assassin or cavalier assassin armor and dodgy, combined with fireproof and dense, you are an indestructible tank. This is the kinda shit that needs nerfs. Not the obvious powerful weapon because nobody understands the games mechanics and can't counter shit. There are op armor effects just as there are weapons. People are just ignorant.
---
Totally worked, thanks!
---
Nah I'm good
---
Okay bare with me here. If you have a TSE right now but have 0 weapons perks you will feel this the most. However if you are already running perks it should be a lot less noticeable. I have a vampires ultracite laser pistol with explosive, I run the pistol perks but not demo and I one shot a lot of mobs already. If anything I can swap in demo expert and still one shot since you get the 100% to explosive damage so you only lose 60%. It will be the same for my instigating expo shotty.  
---
The notice I will have is I tend to use TS/ TSE 50 cals on the queen, worst case is I go from a 3-4 minute solo to a 4-5 minute solo on her.  People I run with we should still be able to take her out in 45 seconds when we 4 man her. 
---
Perhaps you could dig deeper into my comment history and reply even more?  That will demonstrate just how rustled up your jimmies are.  Three is only a mild obsession.
---
Glad to help!! +karma
---
That's...really interesting. I've shied away from low health builds because it seemed like there was huge opportunity to get one shotted. Guess it's time to start collecting unyielding armor, Ive been itching to get out of my power armor anyways and this sounds like fun to play around with.
---
Think about what you are saying. You are asking for proof of nefarious activities by a highly secretive gaming subculture.  
---
People don't go around drawing attention to stuff that could get them banned. They are really secretive about  it.   So you asking for pretty is pretty absurd. 
---
PC? Xbox? PS4?
---
Are you having other issues with the system or internet?
---
And yes, getting garbled or late packets from the internet when ruining a badly programmed software can cause it to fault. A good programmer has it check the incoming data (was it between 1 and 10? no, then ignore), a sloppy programmer reusing resources and patching together something off of an old engine may skip that part (query - what is the players health. Answer - purple. okay, let's stuff "purple" into that variable and see what happens...)
---
Anyone know how long the ban lasts
---
You rarely see fucktards solo. They always bring their own audience with them. 
---
My only guess is by storing junk it refreshes your inventory. No idea why this bug happens now. Didn't see it before patch.
---
Will we ever get an official text chat? I can't always use the voice chat in this game, and communication with other players can be a pain in the ass without it. 
---
Maybe ill dust off the Bloody Handmade, while the nerf storm passes. Or just focus on the op melee.
---
Don't forget nerd rage and serendipity.
---
I play the game how I see fit and that doesn't make it wrong. If I play with a team I'm the medic because I can literally heal every person multiple times without worry. I help out low levels all the time which is fun for me.
---
I found a wind instruments plan on the counter near the entrance to the ski lodge at the top of the world. The one that has the raider vendor-bot. There was also a stealth boy behind the counter.
---
Be thankful. They could have eliminated it entirely, I'm sure they considered it. 
---
Pro tip: It isn't your responsibility
---
Nerf-Away Bethesda
---
Hardcore pvp server — there needs to be an easy and explicit flag to disable your icon from appearing on the map. 
---
It drops at your feet you just have to not move...
---
For pvp it is kind of a big deal because the right melee build is a whole lot stronger than any TSE build could be (without the bobble head glitch of course)
---
That's a shame a 200% condition flamer chainsaw is a beast. a legendary would be amazing
---
They’ll hide it
---
Only underarmor (which can grant effects and ~~won’t~~ shouldn’t be sold in the atom store)
---
Best bet, wait till an armor paint you like rolls around
---
Maybe store and put the tinker back down? FT to a world tinker? Pull the mats out of storage?   
---
That's about all I got other then joining a different server or a full quit out 
---
Do you know if furious will top it? Or hunters for the queen? As well as all the situational damage affixes? Is it still going to be stronger than those percentages? Obviously bloodied explosive will be the next ranged weapon top affixes, but will two shot still top everything else?
---
1. you can snipe with a shotgun for more damage than a sniper rifle and any melee character more than 15 feet away is dead. Then they re spawn and you can shoot them from 100 yards again and again and again. 
---
2. one shot is a kill with most TSE so fire rate is a moot point. PA melee builds are restricted to AP for movement and no long range.
---
3. TSE guns are easy to come by and completely over saturate the game simply because 90% of them are duped hundreds of times and bought from players. Its far to late to take them all back
---
4. Ammo. really? Explosives do 15-20X the damage so they use much less ammo than any other guns. "oh but melee doesn't use bullets" yea thats the trade off for long range, cripple, headshot double damage, etc etc etc  
---
IF your issue is "Melee builds are too strong" then ask for a melee nerf. Stop using it as a scapegoat for these extremely over powered Exploit duplicated weapons.
---
I'm not saying melee shouldn't be nerfed, it is very broken. What I am saying is that TSE should be nerfed first, and they are. 
---
Cool getting on
---
Guns in general need buffs. Plasma and Laser definitely need like a 200 percent buff
---
Maybe our outrage will make them stop. Probably not though
---
Finally leveled up enough to use my 2 shot guass, I've barely had enough time to have fun with it before its scaled down... : (   I just dont get it I guess, idc that people have op weapons, it's not ruining any fun for me
---
The subs would make you think that nobody plays the games except toxic man children, but in reality it’s populated with mostly friendly people, with a few cucks and edgey teens
---
It's because you both open the transfer window
---
Got a 3* Handmade last night. I was so stoked. It was a Junkie's. I wept.
---
I feel exactly the same. After finally finding a 'simple' TS lvl 45 lever action that barely holds up to the higher level mobs *with* all the right perks, they're gonna nerf it even more. I'm downright pissed off and disappointed. These weapons are hard to find if you play it fair and square like I and so many others did so it's downright bullshit to punish everyone for the actions of a few. If my only TS gun really loses 75% of its dmg bonus by the next patch, I won't have any motivation left to keep finding endgame entertainment in this game. Been playing since day one of beta and I have been more than patient with this rough gem but this would be the straw. /rant sorry, had to get this off my chest somewhere someone from BGS might at least notice the opinion. 
---
It was the Watoga Train Station vendor.
---
Vault 76?
---
Stole your sweetroll, eh?
---
Damage percentage perks shouldn't even be a thing. As far as I'm concerned, they're generous for even allowing them to continue to exist in any firm. 
---
Nerfing both now fyi
---
&gt;With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage ~~and the Two Shot legendary mod can no longer be looted in the world.~~
---
&gt;The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%.
---
Your own camp!
---
On my build I went with Lone Wanderer over Suppressor or Tenderizer because you'll (hopefully) be 1-shotting most things, but I also use VATS so the AP Regen is really useful.
---
I bought mine from someone, but a little while ago I put up a post with where to get most of them! 👍
---
Is this the bacon party?
---
Irrelevant. For example with Demolition perk i do 300 dmg that means if weapon breaks in about 1000 shots that is 30 000 dmg before it breaks. If i had GS5 instead of Demolition my weapon would do 200 dmg but last for 1500 shots. That is 30 000 dmg before it breaks. So Demolition and Gunsmith 5 offer the exact same identical weapon breakage on equal damage dealth. But the advantage of using Demolition instead of Gunsmith is that you do the damage faster. So nothing to lose only to win. Too bad it won't be the same after the nerf.
---
This. 
---
Go to my camp near charstan
---
Well bloodied is better than two shot and needs nerfing first in my opinion, that would hit ranged AND melee builds
---
Wooded armor has a special mod called shrouded that improves both your stealth and your movement speed when crouched and stacks with every piece.  It also reduces the weight of the armor to practically nothing - which is super useful because stealth builds tend to have super low strength.
---
Yup. There are no rules, i play the game my way.
---
Lol that was my entire point. It doesn't take that much skill. You just have so little you cant keep up with the casuals. I mean unless you have your TSE to cuddle with and keep you warm. 
---
Hell yeah!!
---
Now I'm imagining a chair where the seat and back are oversizedb bottle caps and the legs and arms are bottles. 
---
I'll go to the telegraph station on my way to the 5 and dime. Unless you would rather I pony express that?
---
well what's your logic behind disagreeing with this then?
---
Heres video evidence showing the opposite.
---
Ppl are liars on reddit
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/z/edw2m98
---
I'd agree if it didn't come alongside the accuracy and recoil addition. It is not a flat 25% increase. It's only an increase in the second shot hits.
---
Explosive mitigates this downside almost completely, which is a large part of why they are broken together.
---
But Two-Shot by itself on most weapons is not consistent.
---
My fusion generators are behind 3 metal doors +3 stories high above all water and molerats spawn/dig(?)  Inside that specific room ..

It is insanely overpowered done correctly
---
I've been having frequent issues where crafting items or repairing gear is telling me I don't have the resources when I actually do. Seems to be a common bug. 
---
This is where I always nuke, far superior to the NW nuke area. It's probably the most common drop point on PC now.
---
All 3 slugger perks at rank 3 are 30% each. Making it a total of 9 points into str for a total of 90% extra weapon dmg, + martial artist for reduction and swing speed your at what 12 already? 
---
No, just no.
---
I got the plans for both the legs and chestpiece from the station vendor but the arms from greg fairly recently, I'm level 132 if that's of any help. I can also mod your armor if you're on PC and you're interested, and I'll keep my eye out for extra plans since they don't cost much.
---
Workshops open you up to pvp.
---
Being in a group has a lot of weird behaviour too.
---
The shots with two shot "scatter," causing them to frequently miss at range. If there wasn't that drawback making the double damage pretty infrequent, you would be right.
---
Yes, I agreed with your conclusion just disagreed with the individual points. 
---
I think Bethesda needs to take a wider look at the entire state of the game before resulting to these knee-jerk reactions. This band-aid that is *not* going to fix the griefing problem is going to further hurt the queen health scaling issue everyone is already facing. 
---
Can you post a pic of it? Want to see if is the same
---
You're not limited to AP with a melee build, that limits your power attacks and VATS, not your ability to swing over and over again without need to reload or have ammo in the first place.
---
They should allow for a full character respec with these changes...  Or some vendor I can spend caps at (the cost would increase after each use) to respec my character.
---
Heavy Weapon durability versus damage output is in a bad place. These weapons are fun and unique, and they are also super frustrating to use.  
---
Energy weapons need a buff. And also it’s super annoying to have to reload every time I get me Gatling lazer or plasma out. That’s quality of life stuff.
---
Make known plans have some sort of flag that it’s known, how did this not even make it as a feature.
---
Some perks may not be working correctly. Luck of the draw for instance,  I have a rank three, and sometimes it works, Other times it doesn’t. I will get the icon and sound that the perk procced, yet my durability was the same if not worse.
---
If we nuke other places, give us bosses. Let me nuke Grafton and fight a giant badass Grafton monster.
---
If you get disconnected from a server, save that persons spot in a server for several minutes, allow us to reconnect to the same server, and still keep ownership of workshops. There’s got to be some way it can do some sort of check, and after 5 minutes of being off the server, it then registers as unowned. This is driving people away from really getting into the workshops.
---
The compass in power armor is off. 
---
Stash limit needs to be increased. I feel like I get stuck in gameplay because I can’t sell anything else that day, due to cap restrictions, and my stash being full.
---
Give us an aid tab and a food tab. It’s rough going through all the stuff in my inventory on the fly sometimes. Maybe even make a key tab, so my misc tab is easier to peruse.
---
Unless they changed it last update At rank 3 slugger perks grants 20% each.
---
How about making turrets actually fire at enemies? Can’t tell you how many times I’ve been at my camp with Scorched shooting it up and mole rats chewing on my crops and foundations while the turrets sit there merrily scanning and beeping and never reacting.
---
I've seen T51 calibrated shock plans at the Brotherhood vendor once.
---
That nerf is fucking stupid. Make that active on the pvp servers only 
---
Sentinel, Assassin's, Fireproof, Padded armor. Lots of ways to mitigate explosive dmg.
---
Sucks but people are dicks
---
Yeah, you really have to use cover smartly with a low-DR build. But it's exhilarating! I'm not patient enough for Fallout 4 survival or any of the hardcore mods; the build I have (Garb of Mystery, Berserker, and Ironclad is all my DR) is softcore enough for me to still consider it doable.
---
On that note, why not have vertibird taxis after you complete the bos questline.
---
I'll take them! Lol. Xbox 
---
Maybe we could use the flare gun to tag events requesting help for the station. 
---
There already is.
---
I'm sure no PvP mode will come with private servers, and not before. Which I am okay with.
---
Damn I had no idea, Thank you good sir
---
I also am submitting this as a ticket to Bethesda, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. 
---
Power Up (Insert Power Plant Name) - Now that the fusion core fabricators are producing at a decent rate again, I like this event because I can take the workshop and then do this. By the time I am done I have some fusion cores ready to go. I also like that when powered up the sub stations get power. I like events that effect the world.
---
Battle Bot - Love this event. I have done it 10 times. How do I know it is 10, because I have 10 copies of the key cards you get during the quest in my inventory and cannot drop them. That doesn't impair my love for this event though. And I think I will still like it just as much after my 2 shot missile launcher isn't as effective, because it has the quad barrel, so I will just have to pull the trigger 3 times instead of 2 to kill the sentry bot. So what I am saying is I love blowing things up with my missile launcher. More events where I get to do that!
---
Feed The People - The way it used to be where it gave everyone on the server some stew. I loved that. The idea that me doing some little event could help out other players without me even knowing them, is awesome. It also helped me out a couple times when I had no food and other people did the event. Let it be one of those Bob Ross happy accidents and change it back. 
---
Scorched Earth &amp; Nuke Zones in general - I think each nuke zone needs to spawn a boss event. Love fighting the SBQ and the mobs. It can basically be just the same idea, you have 20 minutes to kill this super tough creature, and there is a decent chance you won't succeed, but swap out the monsters based on the locale. Would love to nuke Grafton for example and spawn a 90th level three star Grafton Monster that rampages through the town with swarms of other local baddies showing up periodically.
---
Summoning the Mothman - One of the best moments of the game for me was this. Don't change anything about this event. It is difficult enough that I am not always successful, but not so hard that it is impossible. Might be cool to be able to have other events where we can come into contact with non hostile versions of the creatures we usually will have to fight. Love the friendly Scorch Beast that occasionally shows up in Watoga too.
---
Which events do you not care about doing or dislike? Why? 
---
Dross Toss - it is too easy and the rewards aren't much. I think it shouldn't be an event, and should just be something you can sit there and do whenever you want for as long as you want. You should have to pay caps to play. But if someone wants to sit there all day and play that so they can get tokens, let em.
---
Which events do you prefer to play in a team vs. solo? Why? 
---
Mothman Lighthouse - My camp is nearby because I prefer doing this event with other people. If I notice the event is on and there are people in the area, I gather them in and we give it a whirl. 
---
Uranium Fever - I like this one when everyone there is playing by the unspoken rules of point out the legendary creatures so everyone can get their hits in.
---
Scorched Earth - Couldn't imagine trying to do that solo.
---
1 - More events that effect the world. I want my actions to matter. Our mandate is to rebuild America. Let the things I do improve the lives of the other players in some way. Let me take over a radio station, collect holo tapes of the songs in the game, and DJ for my fellow players with those, and maybe some of the tales from Appalachia tapes as well. Or let me do something at Vault Tech agriculture center that improves the quantity of plants that grow in the area. Or the water treatment plant. Maybe fixing something there would make the river yield purified water instead of dirty water. Stuff like that.
---
2 - More opportunities to blow up stuff with my missile launcher.

Most of the time I just happen to be in the area, see the event is going on when it comes up on my HUD and then I try to complete it. If I like the event, I will keep an eye out for it in the future on the map. If I am looking for something to do, or happen to be going in the direction of an event I like, I will fast travel to it. Would be nice to have it show the time remaining to complete when I hover my mouse over it, so I don't waste the time if there is like a minute left.
---
If it is specific to the event, like you do something involving food, and then you get decreased hunger for the rest of the week, or you do something that requires strength and then get a +1 to your strength for the next 24 hours, I would be fine with that. 
---
Happens sometimes to me too. I end up having to hard reset the box. 
---
You magnificent bastard. You just made my day.
---
Yes, Im a little salty today, because even after this, the server dc'd me in the middle of a defend red rocket event. Whats worse than some random douchbag destroying your camp? Getting dropped when your holding multiple workshops to try and get resources to rebuild your camp!
---
No medic role need 1300 stims. Period. You're sitting on hold tho that's forsure sell then 10xaps each shitttt. 
---
And you kind of are. Absolutely no reason to have that much chems. Even as a "medic". I personally carry 30 to 50. I only go higher when I do whitespring. Unless you're living at the golf course. Damn dude. Like damn. 
---
And I gotta give you credit for acquiring 1300 stims. That's to say they're legit. Not accusing here. 
---
What is a hard reset? Unplug it from the wall?
---
My current build is a bloodied explosive lever action gun I use nerd rage rank 3 and demolition rank 2 with adrenal reaction I do 1300 damage I also use dodgy 
---
I’m on PC and have an extra, if you still need it you can have it, only thing is I won’t be out of work for another 5 hours.
---
Ya 
---
Not really... you basically get one shotted when your using bloodied
---
Alright I'm back. Let me take a step back quick. I was wrong. Read what you posted on my way out and totally misinterpreted. You are correct. My bad good sir.
---
Np.
---
I hardly pvp and I'm getting it to stop my #1 cause of death, my explosions
---
Nah, they're working on the dupers too, don't worry. 
---
This is a good balance solution to the fact there are way too many of these weapons in the game when they were meant to be ultra-rare. I am sure they will eventually add more powerful weapons as rare drops back once they get a handle on the duping and glitching situations.
---
Fallout is about adapting and overcoming, so do that.
---
Hold down the button on the console until it turns off. Wait until the fan is off, and then turn it back on. The screen should be green when it starts back up and then it’ll load normally. 
---
You are the one coming in making crazy claims. So, proof bitch.
---
Get off the stage!
---
I think that this will make other perks more relevant like instigating and anti armor
---
I have MANY level 5 cards that I REALLY want to level down. I'd pay caps all day to re-spec some of my max-ranked cards. 
---
hey if you read the post it says this.
---
  The Explosive Legendary mod has a reduced damage bonus, now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%.  they are doing something about it :).
---
stop with the rant explosive mod is being changed 
---
Two... hours? How?
---
Yeah i talked about this before. I'd love it so much. Would be a highly contested workshop for sure
---
Both if those conditions were met at my TOD
---
Yeah, it took them a decade to implement it though and generally speaking war mode is a shitty substitute.
---
There are chickens?
---
I’m level 57 and have never seen one ..
---
Your looted items have the best maximum durability so you have that going for you.
---
Who grinds ammo? Its handed to you at every turn.
---
But rolling a 1 every time might mean it is broken is his point
---
I'm butt hurt because I have a bunch of Two Shot (non explosive) weapons which are going to get bricked.  Also I don't have any problem with "OP" melee builds.  I can out run them, create space, and shoot them pretty easy.  In my opinion being in PA with Speed Demon, Marsupial, and a jet pack is kind of broken.  You shouldn't be able to be that tanky and that mobile, but it hasn't been that big of an issue.
---
Ive only played about 3 hours post patch but didnt disconnect at all, pre patch i was lucky to play for 30 mins between disconnects.
---
Honestly I need to check. I thought they were 10% each rank, I'll log the main rn and look. 
---
Glad they are nerfing TSE items... but I wish they would focus on fixing weapon durability and energy weapon damage. 
---
I am specc'ing for a heavy gun build, and just bought my first TSE 50.cal today, which would have finished the build. Saving up for it took me two weeks.
---
Getting the perk cards took me 3 days of leveling, since I play legit, and higher level players levels up more slowly(iirc). 
---
Up until today, I didn't even use any two-shot weapons, I have a nocturnal handmade with explosive damage, and for the day, I have an explosive 10 mm smg with extra damage towards scorched. Anything gets close, I melee it with an instigating fireaxe, most mobs go down in 2 regular hits. 
---
But I have high strength, I am equipped in high-tech power armor, I should be able to hit that little rat dead in one hit, you know? Its the same principle I want for rifles. If I specc'ed for rifles, I expect to be doing very well with rifles. 
---
But that is not the case in most of the time. Many enemies are very bullet spongey when engaging them without legendary weapons, and unless you spec for one specific weapon type, you are at an disadvantage. So I might be a bit onesided since I feel like I worked hard to be able to slay enemies as easy as they can take me down. 
---
And it's not like the explosive damage comes without risk (90% of my deaths comes from my own explosive damage). I will agree, it is kind of over-powered, but a 75-80% damage reduction is still way too much since there are a lot of bullet spongey enemies out there. 
---
I love pvp. It needs adjustment and balancing, but it's a lot of fun.
---
I'll hunt someone down over a 10 cap bounty. I'm not in it for the caps. I'm in it for the hunt.
---
But I don't want to get wanted and/or start picking on someone who is busy doing quests and not interested in pvp. So I play Bounty Hunter instead of Raider. I'm glad there are Raiders who accumulate bounties so I have people to hunt. 
---
I've been sniping with a two shot gauss a fair bit recently, and I don't know that I'd call it "frequent".  I'm not a VATS user though, and I do hear it's a bigger problem there.
---
I'd be down for that.
---
A dedicated PvP mode.
---
You can't see anyone on the world map, and they don't get that little orange arrow above their head.
---
As said below, have factions, and you collect ears from dead players like back in F3 and can hand them in for rewards or fingers dependant on the faction.
---
Grinding events is kind of the worst when you're chasing down that one item and you feel like you're hitting your head against the wall over and over and over just trying to get one silly plan in the game because you're a completionist, give me faction tokens and a store that has a wider array of loot drops from those events and let me choose, the cap and aid item bonuses are nice, I've been doing every event that says shielded plans drop in since mid December, I play more than I care to admit and I have yet to get any shielded plans for under armor.
---
I'd like to be able to craft mods I can sell once you guys get the duping under control, it can be stressful trading with a player to have mods put on your armor.
---
As an avid hunter of plans I've had to make different level characters to get different rolls on items, this is frustrating because moving plans between accounts sucks, can't we just have plans unlocked across all characters on the account?
---
Give me an in vendor way of telling me what plans I already know.
---
Some kited 2 scorchbeasts to my camp and it was totally destroyed. I asked them why and he said, oops?
---
I am still trying to track him down to return the favor, but he doesn’t seem to play anymore. 
---
It sucks because the bounty doesn’t equate to the amount of resources I have to use/get to fix everything. 
---
I mean, you can't kill people coming out of Vault 76 anyway. They are immune to damage from players till level 5.
---
Enough with the spoilers 
---
Really.  OP.  With 6 lvls of Rifleman, 5 of Demo Expert my TSE Handmade does 560dmg per shot.  With 9 lvls of Gladiator, a couple steaks and drinks, not to mention buffs from incisor, blocker, and martial artist, my 3* Vampires Ski sword does 590 per reg swing, and has +40% Power Attack and with Martial artist the power attack is reg swing speed, AND there's no effort to conserve ammo.  The game is geared for Melee.  The TSEs balanced the equation(and had hidden nerfs that required the use of selective build strategy.)
---
I dont disagree that it was easy to abuse by adding grenadier, which I do not, but anything can be extremely OP by stacking 10 of a relevant bobblehead on top of it. 
---
It isnt fun because legit players get 1 shot by dupers and duped-gun-users.
---
Better yet, re.ove all weapons and replace them with megaphones that go "REEEEEEEEEEEEEE" when you pull the trigger.
---
You should be a pro with that setup ;)
---
It will be hard "Banning dupers from selling" which means even the innocent player who bought it will be banned its best to write a report on a PLAYER just tell us the name and when it reach to the Devs they can adjust either they will be banned or write a sorry letter 
---
How would you go about getting the hunters long coat is it a side quest or a main or random i would love to have that badass looking coat on my character 
---
Dude, i rarely carry more than 20 stimpaks on me.
---
Your problem is unique to you and its easy to fix.
---
Oh man I would be pissed.
---
Do you rely on criticals in vats? Do you want stuff that drops at 90 to something over 100% condition? Do you want legendary loot with a large conditon bar? Luck is what effects that 
---
Even worse when the scorchbeast queen drops you rusted knuckles... 3 times in a row? I mean... does the universe hate me or something?
---
I deleted and reinstalled the game yesterday and had a couple of multi-hour sessions with only one crash. That includes launching a nuke and killing the SBQ. Your mileage may vary, but it was a lot better than anything else I’ve tried...
---
Once I reach cap limit god help all your pretty bases HAHAHAHAHAHANANABA
---
I've been playing a melee build since the beta and that's why I don't use them upgraded.  The only one that I do have upgraded is iron fist as there is no expert or master rank for it
---
Ah was wondering what was happening. This one is annoying.
---
I been on reddit about a week now lol cut me some slack man. I still don’t know how it works tbh. 
---
Defense and build budget 
---
Pretty sure it's a whitesprings thing. 
---
Okay, i didn't think that would be possible but i really like that you can take builds to extremes like this. Is the trade off that you're constantly on deaths doorstep, or does your damage resist get high enough that its not as bad as it seems (low health)?
---
You can mke yourself immune to explosive damage with dense mod and 3 points in fireproof.
---
NO DONT NERF 2 SHOT AND EXPLOSIVE PERKS!!!!
---
before you jump on me for wanting to keep my op weapons how about instead that make standard guns just do acceptable damage instead of shooting airsoft BBs???
---
In case it isn't obvious enough, the problem with the current system is that you can't put a lot of cosmetic/utility/farming stuff in your C.A.M.P. if you actually want to defend it with turrets. With an hard cap at how many turrets/defense items you would be able to place they can just limit the problem without having to hurt people you actually want a C.A.M.P. that doesn't suck. 
---
Yeah this is new. 
---
They’re just jelly
---
You sir are correct. It is 20% each which makes a total of 60%, 
---
My bad!! I gave wrong info. 
---
What level are they sometime they are just bored. Lets say a level 200+ yeah mostly they wanna have fun
---
Maybe it could produce Nuka Cola Syrup, and have a crafting station to make the drinks themselves. Ingredients can be a nuka bottle, nuka cap, boiled water, nuka syrup, and something for whatever flavor you want to make.
---
You get to "earn" soda ingredients by running the factory, and they can't use it as a cap creator
---
How many caps you got?
---
good points, idk maybe you are right, maybe its for the better of the game, I just wish there was another solution, my single 2 shot guns are my best guns, so this will just hurting my game play.
---
How bad could you have possibly screwed up your SPECIAL? I just use different characters for different playstyles. I have 5 very different characters and they all hold up well in different ways. What did you do to regret it so bad?
---
No it was in whitesprings no workshops 
---
Don’t buy from dealers 
---
I suspect most will stop playing. At least until dlc 
---
Bethesda dont give a fuck. I sent them some black market profiteer's spreadsheet of stuff for sale for $, and a few days later i got an automated response saying they will do nothing and consider the matter closed.
---
However it is stated that the guns are a problem because “everyone” has one, the problem is more than just the dupers, people are buying and enjoying these guns knowing damn well they were duped. 
---
They were maxed until today, I bought some armour. 
---
Yeah, it removed all the hair from my face and head.
---
&gt; adapt and overcome 
---
Bear Grills now plays fallout 
---
Yes. Yes it does. Sorry
---
Counterpoint create an "I am root" perk that makes wood armor op
---
EXACTLY THIS!! I agree completely! If people want to PvP great let them all they want but it won't do anything to others that don't want anything to do with it,
---
"How about we not ban cheaters who knew they were exploiting something they weren't meant to do. They were being SMART cheaters!" 
---
How about a "game doesn't crash" mode?
---
Improvise, adapt &amp; overcome.
---
I only wreck someones base when they build it next to Charleston Station or jack bags during PvE.
---
I'm low level. 17 right now, I think. Still in the forest mostly. I visited Charleston a couple of days ago and was blown away by the level design of the toppled buildings. I raided the prison just Northwest of Morgantown yesterday. Died a lot. I don't have much to gift, but I enjoy the ritual. I'm looking forward to sharing awesome loot with others when I get up there, but for now I gift what I can. Sometimes I'll give a piece of gum to a stranger between waves of scorched at the airport. Once I dropped a detective file (which is considered junk) and a carton of cigarettes to another player. I think gifting has a lot of fun potential in role playing. 
---
This one time I actually had a decent rifle that had been given to me and I wanted to pass it on. I'd just found another rifle with an advanced receiver and suppressor to take it's place. I found a player who was the same level of the gun and sprinted towards them. Helped gun down some scorched, waved, dropped the rifle and teabagged the lunch sack.
---
He wandered off. 
---
I did the follow emoji, and another wave. A confused emoji and the dude was not having it. I picked up the rifle and walked in front of it, dropping it at his feet, hoping he wouldn't stab me out of paranoid confusion. 
---
There was no bag. The rifle disappeared into the ether. I didn't know there was a loot bag glitch. FML. The other player ran away from me. I just wandered around the spot looking down, like I'd lost a contact lense. Maybe I lost a little hope that day too. 
---
The nukes are going off on a daily basis, just outside my region. I haven't seen one up close yet. This is the world I am supposed to help rebuild? *sighs* ok.
---
At this point I just enjoy claiming bounties and taking their dropped loot and distributing it in the bins at different stations, just for my own twisted amusement
---
It feels like a punishment to the TSE users who found theirs too. Alot of innocents are suffering because of exploiters spreading duped weapons. There are things that need to be nerfed FAR more urgently that two shot or explosive. 
---
They already nerfed explosive stealthfully with the changes to fireproof. (For PvP anyway)
---
Bloodied deals more damage than two shot to begin with.
---
Melee is too powerful, and stealthfully abused by players because it isn't as loud or obvious as the explosions from an explosive weapon. They can deal WAY more damage.
---
Bobbleheads are going untouched. The dupers will still grief people and one shot the queen and such, they just have to pop 4x the amount. (Dupers have alot stocked up and not all of them are getting banned.)
---
I can also literally tank anything with the armor effects sentinels and assassin's combined with dodgy. Good luck and have fun trying to kill me now with your nerfed two shot explosive shotgun, when I took no damage from one before. People can also make it alot less damage with the mentioned perk fireproof and a dense mod on any chest piece.
---
The level of ignorance behind this nerf is crazy, Bethesda seems to only listen to the players bitching about griefers and hacking, when they don't understand the game mechanics. Most folks don't even know about armor that can make you completely invincible, or that BOBBLEHEADS are what dupers are using to one shot them through slap damage. They think a TSE is the best weapon in the game and the power armor is the best armor. These people make me sick. Do some fucking digging and research before bitching. 
---
Instead of getting rid of the duped weapons, or just the dupers, Bethesda is punishing everyone by taking away a weapon archetype that isn't even the top. The ignorant complaining is the cause, as well as the duping to fuel this complaining.
---
I disagree, i rather nerf two shot and let explosive. Maybe just remove demolition perk from it. Because two shot is stupid it isn't fun. It makes accuracy a joke. While explosive bullets are fun and awesome.
---
Just thought about this but if you nuke your own camp and have crops will they change to flux?
---
The same reason i played past fallout games alot.
---
Theory craft a build &gt; play thru the game &gt; go slow and enjoy the ride &gt; do it again as end game is a snooze fest.
---
Well I can attest that fact my girlfriend doesn’t even know much about the game to begin with let alone any of the things mentioned lol 
---
That’s the back of the behemoth, he rises out of the water.
---
Can you show this on a map ?  I’ve done a few runs but not as many as what sounds like you guys have done .. wanna try something different 
---
I like your idea
---
No because the harpoon gun is treated as a heavy weapon
---
Where to find eggs and why?
---
I have filed dispute but haven’t herd anything back for going on 3 days now 
---
Youre totally welcome. 
---
In enjoyed this. And agree with the better portion.
---
Maybe make the Factory turn into a workshop that can be claimed afterwards would be cool. Have it produce those cans of food as a resource.
---
I’ve been running a few limbs of studded leather, as I get new legendarys and swap them out I vary between 1-3 leather equipped and it really does break super fast, I have tons of cloth and leather more then I know what to do with but I’m always running out of ballistic fiber, it’s only been bareable at all by swapping in white knight rank 3 when I need to repair otherwise I’d probably never use the leather, it really breaks fast I even spent a point to get an additional white knight rank 1 to equip when fighting to slow down the breaking and swap on rank 3 when I repair and it still breaks fast 
---
I did that on FO4. Went through the game a fair few times. However, with the lack of an actual storyline I don't feel the same appeal of doing it on FO76
---
Problem is that i was kicked from the server while looking at it
---
I have a VATS auto-commando build and it slaughters pretty much everything pretty quickly. 
---
Just don't do pistols. They shoot a lot in VATS but without armor penetration it must doesnt stand up. Maybe with a good legendary .44 but the 2 you get guaranteed are either unmoddifiable or come in at lvl 5 if you arnt careful. 
---
Bump yourself into the big leagues. Bases need destroying
---
Reducing durability degradation greatly is not irrelevant.
---
This is actually my second build, my first was melee.
---
Wow this is definitely the worst thing to happen to this game yet. I wonder how Anthem and Outer Worlds are coming along.
---
The mothman museum, and one run can get you about 90 caps after selling them to venders 
---
Is that better or worse than whipping out a fat man to kamikaze and take their caps?
---
id be happier if they nerfed the fuck out of TSE weapons and gave a dmg modifer for ballistic weapons in perception like strength has for melee. you'd suddenly have every weapon available at competetive damage numbers for the same investment in perks instead of having to grind out hundreds of hours to find the single weapon that will make your entire build functional
---
Oooh la la
---
That’s what I would think they would do but my girlfriend has never crafted a single board or done any glitches or anything like that. 
---
Are you sure charisma increases XP 1% per point?
---
If I recall right, it can be purchased from the roaming vendor bot, but don't quote me on that, only like 90% sure 
---
I feel nerfing two shot to fallout 4 numbers would be way more acceptable, and I don't think they should touch explosive at all.
---
Should be noted my perk card layout is built for group support/(perk card sharing for weight reduction and crafting) not damage so any little dps boost to add to the crippling limbs and staggering enemies helps me not be super terrible in a PVE fight when solo.
---
I like wandering around and murdering stuff.
---
That French was for you tasty info
---
They just need to make face hash codes like in Mass Effect so you can write them down and type them in to put your face back.
---
NO
---
Yeah, I’m revisiting some of that rn, and testing in game
---
The guy who wrote the article made a mistake. Go re-read it they updated it.
---
Two shot will still be lootable, but there are changes coming to how it works.
---
It has a storyline 
---
Now I want a set of weightless shrouded wood armour
---
This Im RPing as a wood elf who used a elder scroll and is using a crossbow trying to find a way back to my time
---
I'd love to see a screenshot of that email saying they won't do anything. Haven't seen any that say that yet.
---
At least you got a response 
---
That’s awesome! The first scorch beast kill is so satisfying! If you’re in ps4 and looking for someone to join you, shoot me a message on Psn!- hankypankspanky. Good luck out there in the wastes! 
---
I would use Lone Wanderer but I usually play as a team.
---
Unfortunately this game has terrible options for pvp in general. It really feels like Bethesda didn't know what to do with pvp, and until they resolve that, balancing the game around pvp is going to be a disaster.
---
Thank you I'll see if that works (I'll get to you on that)
---
I fuckin hope so
---
Camp building and exploration 
---
I love this. Its so fitting. 😂
---
Yay changes!  I'm a filthy casual that has little time to play but I appreciate that things have been improving since BETA.  Personally I'd love a way to turn off/on event notifications, sometimes I'm just wandering around gathering resources or following other quests and then an event starts playing just because I strayed too close to a trigger point.  Extra bonus annoying points when it happens when I'm trying to listen to a new quest holotape so that I've got two voices talking over each other.  Not a very high priority thing but it's just a quality-of-life gameplay thing I'd love to have.
---
Wishlist item - because I'm a special snowflake and like weird character concepts, I'd love to see more mods and perks for knives, both of the throwing and the stabbing kind.  
---
Anyway, thanks for the information!
---
Give it some time, if they just banned a shitload of accounts they're going to have a lot of disputes to go through. I know it's frustrating and patience wears thin when these things happen, but when studios do big ban waves they have to sift through quite a bit of disputes as pretty much everyone who was banned correctly or not will be bombarding them with disputes. 
---
In comparison to other FO installations, it is lacking in the storyline department. Im not saying it doesn't have one 
---
I think this is what is going to happen.
---
If you go back to the article, they updated it. Two shot isn’t being removed but it’s being rebalanced
---
Or have your shit break 1/2 thru and do no damage then cry on reddit about it.
---
Its a choice you can make
---
So, are you going to post this every day now or just yesterday and today?
---
Sentinel prefix reduces your damage taken by 75% with all 5 pieces. Plus perks/mutations. You can have insane damage reduction where a level 91 glowing death claw will hit you for almost no damage
---
Where: Point Pleasant, around the Monthman statue
---
Why: Cuz it's a lot of easy food 
---
Yep exactly. And anyone who says "I didn't know" is lying or Extremely naive. Nobody want to take any personal responsibility and admit they were part of a problem that caused this to happen.
---
The story. There's so much fun detail, even if you need to dig around for it, reading terminals and listening to holotapes. I loved the Cold Case quest because it was such a fascinating mystery. 
---
That's because the majority of the player base have abandoned the game. You're just left with Bethesda apologists who circle jerk this flaming piece of garbage.
---
Eh? All three can reward unique plans and some mediocre legendaries. Worst case scenario, the rewards in caps and crap to sell is consistent.
---
Surely in comparison to firing off mininukes into houses.... The replay isn't all that terrible.
---
Every open world PVP battle is two scenarios, anyway: the poor schmuck in Excavator armor dies or the first person with sentinel and berry mentats wins.
---
Awesome! My GT is Maxy88, shoot me a message if you are on then :)
---
Sell your shit.  Problem solved.  You're not supposed to be able to carry tons of everything.
---
Aight, GT aGraciousGod
---
From what I've heard from other high level players is that the increased C.A.M.P. budget is just a myth. I'm lvl150 and mine feels the same as it did at lvl50 
---
But that build is just as potent with a gun.....
---
Oh come on this is such Bullshit.
---
Theres tons of people still duping. 
---
Also how would Bethesda know someone unwittling found a dupers bag stash when they disconnected and couldnt come back to collect it?
---
Every day just for you big guy
---
PA, Marsupial and Jet Packs also benefit all builds for mobility, escape and to give you the time to heal. Your smarminess aside, I think you're not considering the entirely of the post.
---
Yeah I would definitely like it more had it not shaved my entire had when I put it on lol
---
Never knew that, thanks
---
My regular armour has better DR than my T-60, so I tend to only have excavator in my pocket to bolster carry weight up
---
Meh theres talk of DDOS amongst some for being wrongly banned. Petty but Ive seen worse.
---
According to them, highly doubt it. They read what people are saying even if they don’t respond, and reddit has been nothing but a shit show over this since it was announced earlier today. I think they knew they fucked up and are putting their tails between their legs now. And for me none of this even matters because my main is a stealth build that still has the 0 damage bug so ammo and weapon maintenance is quadrupled when it takes an entire clip to kill a single super mutant while doing 3.5x stealth crit hit. Which just results in me playing my melee character instead.
---
Not encouraging duping just saying that dupers are not the only reason these guns a such a widespread problem
---
Zenimax has private investors and a bored like any company but they aren't as hostile as the real life stock market where if you fart wrong investors freak out and your stock drops 40% because the wind shifted and grandma's knee started to hurt
---
This is necessary now. Sad as it is. Blame the Exploiters/Dupers and everyone that Knew exactly what they were doing when buying them.
---
Considering the damage and accuracy of shotguns at low level, that's surprising you're effective. But I stand by my point and you could have done just as much damage while baseball batting in your PA
---
Tse is already nerfed due to fireproof 3 negating explosive damage.
---
So by your own logic we should see melee everywhere......yet that is patently false....
---
Some people are reporting emails from bethesda in their spam folders. Check there.
---
Pretty much. The aim/recoil penalty is so massive that the damage nerf just makes it not worth it.
---
Huh. If that's accurate and also true for pickups like plans then it explains why I have an inventory full of plans and other people empty handed players claim they take 36 hours to respawn.
---
Clans  I love the idea of 
---
Love the GT. I'm BreakingTexas77
---
They really should do a wipe. Or at least give people the option to wipe their characters and be put on servers with others who have opted to wipe their game.
---
Realistic physics based on the way something reacts when it hits a fictional item...
---
I think wood armor should be a default craft able, like light leather, wood armor can be used to good stealth effect, but it's so difficult to get a complete set together and scrap enough to learn any of the mods it may have.
---
Reboot in like initialisation 
---
Without being on your Friends list, I'm a bit uncertain how to log onto the same server as you. 
---
he's at soccer practice.  he'll get back to you after juicebox time.
---
Yeah this, people are idiots, you could build in a house and a lot of griefers will probably walk by and not even bother entering. Also get a piece of chameleon armour and crouch when you at your base if you not doing much. I had 3 people in PA suits headed by way, I crouched and then they changed direction, was classic. They could of been friendlies but I wasn't going to take a chance.
