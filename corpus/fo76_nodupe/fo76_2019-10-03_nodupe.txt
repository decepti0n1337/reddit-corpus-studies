An easy one is Charleston station. Walk south along the red bridges and it has a chance to spawn in the gulley below you. The event grafton day always has one.
---
---
---
The whole thing is a simulation anyway... we’re all still in the vault...
---
From what I have found with personal experiance, it affects Grenade launchers, missle launchers and fat man.
---

---
Not explosive legendary effects.
---
I have one I can sell or trade you. Very rare drop from what I understand. I think you used to be able to buy from enclave vendor but cant anymore.
---
I had one spawn right up against the hill at the end of the bridge while I was walking toward the station. As soon as I drew my gun it flew straight up and was gone.
---
You on Xbox?
---
Yup.
---
Get a job at bethesda please
---
Really? I have not found plans yet then, or deconstructed one. I will keep an eye open.
---
Cool, I’m broke so I probably can’t buy it.
---
Welcome to tranquillity lane!
---
You on now? Maybe we can do some bartering.
---
I am not to low of a level. I just hit 80, but I am poor. I will keep that in mind though! Thanks!
---
For me it’s been mixed up. I’ve had hw red eyed one run off and the yellow eyed one go super agro on me after it whipped out a group of Super Mutants. I was only lvl 20 something at the time so it took a while to kill.
---
Yeah I’ll be on for a few more minutes. I actually have a good bit of ammo and some crappy legendaries if those interest you. My gamer tag is Mushieus.
---
My camp is about a one minute walk under the WS bunker, where the little pond and river is. Honestly, I think it’s that little forest that’s between the WS white boundary wall and the road, I get loads of weird spawns like behemoths, mothman, flatwoods monster etc
---
Awesome Stuff! i have the same thing at mine!   
---
i Have Clothing,Weapons,Aid And Misc  
---
In My Mis I Have Some Robot Models For Like 25 Caps. And Someone Bought All Of Them!
---
i also have some things for people to donate/ rate my camp. I have a donation thing of 5 caps lol
---
K be on in a minute. I'll hit you up.
---
My space people need me!
---
The banner for wastelanders was also changed 2 times, and the vault in the new one is 79.
---
That's the grafton monster the flatwoods monster is an alien. I left queen of the hunt uncompleted on one of my alts so i can always get a flatwoods monster for dailys.
---
I thought that they hired people, after firing some people. I may be wrong though
---
I could go camp to camp selling my wares, instead of them sitting in my vendor where no one ever seems to buy them. 
---
I'd love to have something where I "order" 3 bulk acids for x caps and maybe in the map hovering over my camp shows that I want to buy acid (or maybe it will just show up by altering how the current way camps are shown, maybe the "junk" will blink or be in a different color)
---
Google SR-71 Blackbird
---
So I've come up with a few medic builds in the past which I am happy to share :)
---
Firstly, do you know how perk sharing works/do you want to know more information about it?
---
Okay, there are a few different medic builds you could try. First, there are the passive perks
---
Anti-Epidemic and Team Medic are your go-to perks for that play style
---
* Anti-Epidemic allows your disease cures to affect other players
---
* Team Medic allows your stim-packs to heal other players when you heal yourself
---
If you share team medic, then everyone will be healing each other heaps. They are both effective perks, but they are both very passive. You won't be actively healing anyone, they'll just be getting healed just for being in your party really. But hey, maybe you'll like that since your also focusing on melee.
---
Secondly, there are perks that are a little more active. They focus on giving you bonuses for reviving people. E.M.T., Healing Hands and Injector are your go-to perks for this play style
---
* E.M.T. causes players you revive to get health regeneration
---
* Healing Hands causes players you revive to be cured of all rads
---
* Injector causes players you revive to have greater AP regeneration
---
You could share whatever perks you want to with this playstyle. The benefit of this playstyle is that you don't need to be in a party to use it. So if you don't know if you're going to have a group of friends to play with this might be a better option.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
...Now I have a few crazy options that you might like to try. These rely heavily on perk sharing, so if they sound fun you might wanna learn how that works.
---
First the reviving build. Essentially you're using the perks from the reviving build I mentioned above, but you're also sharing Mysterious Saviour and Revenant.
---
* Mysterious saviour would make it so that there is a chance people will be revived automatically when they are downed
---
* Revenant gives people a massive damage boost after they have been revived.
---
The difference between this build and the other reviving build is that you actually want your allies to die so that they can get the massive boosts from all the revive perks you're using/sharing. It takes a bit of team coordination and a bit of trust but it definitely makes for an interesting experience.
---
The second crazy perk-sharing option is a radiation option. You want to be sharing Rad-sponge and Ghoulish
---
* Rad-Sponge causes you to heal nearby players of rads if you have rads
---
* Ghoulish causes you to be healed when you take rad damage.
---
This build will not only allow you to shrug off most sources of rad damage, but it also makes you (and your allies) *want* to take rad damage because of the massive heals you'll get from it. Rad damage is literally everywhere so don't worry about not having a source of rad damage. If you're in survival mode you could even heal allies with a gamma gun!
---
There are a few options for a medic build. As you can see there are actually many ways you could go about it, I know that I just dumped a lot of information on you but I have no doubt you'll have a lot of fun when you get the hang of it.
---
By the way, most of these perks are in the Charisma tree, although a couple of the sharing perks were in Endurance though.
---
I’m having a good meat week. Haven’t been able to play much but finished the meat cook 3-4 times. It seems just crowded enough and it’s nice that people seem to get how the event works and are willing to crank a grill or play drums. 
---
I do hate that the prime meat spoils...that’s idiotic. Just limit it to 15 or something per person. I hate it when it goes bad because I may not have time to log in every day.
---
No need, that's common knowledge.  Im asking what it has to do with Fallout.  Why should I want my hunting rifle to be black with red stripes.
---
If the player is part of a 'developing' story and Bethesda is asking us to participate, then applying a storytelling logic to what's going on would make some sense. The players are decimating the number of scorched beasts and scorched, so it only makes sense that when the Wastelanders return the player will inevitably team up with the Wastelanders to finally eradicate the Scorched from this developing story. 
---
It would be a humongous server drain and logically implausible to integrate a bunch of human NPCs into the game while the Scorched/Scorchbeasts are so prevalent, and not be focused on a longer evolution of a storyline. 
---
Eradicating the scorched, or reducing their numbers to a 'manageable load on the server' while still having them around to support the existing storyline makes sense to me. 
---
I imagine that the Wastelander NPCs would have dialogue related to running from, fighting with, or defeating the Scorched. It doesn't make any sense to think from a story perspective that Bethesda would just say, "Hey, none of that other stuff matters, and these are new characters you need to care about this now."
---
Very yes! Sigma Squad and Tesla Armor skins! It may be lore breaking (what’s one more thing) but I want some X-02 armor added.
---
Actually no it was off, hoping you were right :(
---
Got these few loots a few hours later. Omg. After hundreds of hour playing. I got sort of rewarded.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/541ivsI
---
No it was off, just checked thanks anyway, wish it was the reason.
---
I had mine on a cliff but moved to a small flat area because when I would fast travel or log in, I would fall to my death
---
It works for explosives and explosive weapons, not explosive legendary effects.
---
I got ya. I imagine since the fallout universe takes inspiration from the Cold War and the SR-71 was a big deal during it, fallout just adopted it into the lore. I view it as an less than subtle Easter egg. Not down with the hunting rifle skin though. Would have been better on the assault rifle or laser.
---
The funniest momentS I've had is random band startups, Mr fuzzy rides and so on, always a good laugh
---
sick , the new meta is here boys!!
---
Amazingly cool!
---
1 more month and 28 days
---
This.

 So much this.
---
Whilst im still kinda annoyed how much stuff BoS get for free, i've been waiting for enclave stuff on the atom store since beta. 
---
Take my money already, bethesda!
---
He may have had a full assassin set with sentinel or cavalier.  Could be the 75% chance just triggered on every hit. Ive had weird fights where my vats head shots hit but deal no damage for the first 5 hits and then kill them on the 6th and 7th hit. Ive never built for pvp, so i dont know how effective those armor combinations can be.
---
In all honesty, they could delay til 2025. It still wont work at launch.
---
Hopefuly Bethesda makes it so both can be worn with hats. They may clip a little bit, but I'm certain most overlook it already with the urban mask
---
My 7 year old laptop runs this game more stable than my RTX + 8700K
---
Edit extra.
---
They were standing still at the beginning just stood there as I blasted him with my Anti Armor Explosive handmade, then ran off to hide. 
---
I took grape mentats and sneaked up to him and began swiping with gauntlet and again no damage. I'm guessing a veteran Survival/NW player with some Sentinel type setup. I have no idea about such things, interesting anyway.
---
I had a two shot The Dragon once that picked up this bug. It was amazing while it lasted.
---
I know these pains. I always buy them 1c and make sure you do the ash heap events for copper.
---
Also telephones lamps and fuses.
---
I see your point and thanks for the advice. I got it to work nonetheless without freeing up any new space. :)
---
I dont think it is. I think its drop.rate was nerfed. In 20 kills since the last patch ive hotten 14 1 stars and 6 2 stars from loot and 20 2 stars from quest.
---
Well done! :)
---
How?
---
They aren’t doing much to bring in new players outside of the battle royale. Wastelanders might help with actual NPCs being added but for the most part atm the only thing that gets Bethesda’s constant attention is the atom shop. New items every week. Because you don’t need to bring in new players as long as you can keep the current ones buying. And fan boys will buy
---
I observe a trend by people to group up and chain their camps recently, and make multiple camps thematic. Like a village where everyone owns a sizable plot of land.
---
Raider lvl 15 armor. One spot to hop if you're looking for fast PA
---
Now with this change we can blame dev companies for not implementing crossplay rather than sony or microsoft
---
My raid group have dropped off now because apparently the raid isn't worth it, it sucks because I probably won't get the full power armour set until they start playing again
---
I updated my firewall, then disabled it, installed the game, enabled the firewall and the game worked with no issues. :D
---
For some reason I seem to have issues with the game whenever I’ve updated windows. It is quite annoying even though I usually get the game to work in the end. :)
---
Claiming a workshop is inviting someone to come kill you. If anyone comes to claim your workshop it enables them to kill you anywhere in the world until the claim/defend the workshop event is over. I had a low level player come try to claim one of mine, and I killed them over and over again for making me leave what I was doing to come defend. Hopefully they've learned their lesson now.
---
This would make an excellent secondary home alternative to the camp with a free fast travel target for the resort. And we could have a camp set up elsewhere. Similar to other games that require an ingame currency to rent housing... like gta5 or the camp rent on rdro. I feel like camp should have basic amenities and stuff maybe resources and stuff, food, a mineral, water. But like just to sleep play music and maybe a smaller sized stash for the hotel room for clothes, armour, and aid items would be well worth 100 or 250 caps a week even.  Hell I'd pay 500 caps week to have a place to store things away from camp and my vendors. I dont need the hotel room for much aside from basics like a cooking stove a chem station(maybe) and a place to get my buffs(sleeping bonus and well tuned). And of course imma push for a side stash.
---
Every nuke should have several rolls, where each success uncovers a cave enterance or something like that.
---
Upon entering the cave, we should be getting a procedurally generated randomised cave. The level of dangerousness of the cave should be between dangerous and really fucking bonkers - each time you enter you should hope there ain't twelve deathclaws just around the corner. Or hope there are.
---
That would give nuke zones infinite replayability across the whole map. They should publish a list of 10+ special  encounter caves that could be opened in various locations, but don't tell anybody where they need to hit for a chance to open them up. Et voila, everybody is nuking everything furiously for the next few months in hope to find the special caves.
---
I throw them away as nobody ever buys them.  Literally.  I put a ‘free’ bag on my shop counter and dump them in there because I’ve never sold one.  
---
They are usually still there when I log out.
---
You're confusing Flatwoods Monster with Grafton Monster.

Can i have some?

I got over 500 of then except im on xbox.

I was a Paladin in the Lost Hills Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. Under orders from High Elder Roger Maxson, I was tasked with forming an expeditionary unit to investigate the status of the Appalachian Chapter.
---
Our journey was perilous, and we lost most of our equipment and a lot of good Brothers and Sisters along the way.
---
Since our arrival we have discovered the fate of the Appalachian Chapter and the threat of the Scorched Plague.
---
We had endured a lot, lost much more, and now we face an impossible task. Morale was low and we were at breaking point.
---
Then I recalled a letter that Maxson hastily scribbled as I was leaving Lost Hills. It simply said:
---
Only open if our worst fears are confirmed.
---
- You are now Sentinel. Lead your troops well and they will follow you through Hell.
---
- Defeat the Scorched Plague.
---
- Allow only the strongest and most dedicated into our ranks.
---
- Defend the citizens of Appalachia.
---
- Safeguard technology from falling into ill hands.
---
- Re-establish communications with Lost Hills.
---
I am now Commanding Officer of the Brotherhood of Steel Hellfire Chapter. And we will succeed where the Appalachian Chapter has failed.  
---
“Through the fires of Hell, the Brotherhood is reforged.”

The fact that you called ESO a "Skyrim game" hurt me more than it should've, you know what ESO stands for right lol
---
I would change my build in a heart beat if they put them back in, chances are if they are in the dev room they might be added in wastelanders.
---
Sorry.  I’ve taken to only stocking certain ammo.  The rest I put up for free.  
---
Sellers:  .308, .45, 5.56, 5mm, .50 cal, fusion cores, plasma cores.  
---
The rest go in the bag.
---
I'm interested! I have 2 keycards and never been in a a silo.  running a level 200 blooded rifle build. In EDT
---
Yes. From that.
---
Cool! I’m out of bot models (need to do some RobCo runs), but I mainly have toys for sale (you know, stash space...) and plans/recipes for 1 cap each, usually..
---
I still need more caps to go on spending/donating on other people’s camps!
---
They have said that the existing quest-lines will remain and can be run simultaneously with the wastelanders for new players. So yes, scorched, scorchedbeasts, and nukes will all still be there.
---
Yeah you need either to turn off or set on fast vsync. My setup now runs a 4K 32" screen off a RTX 2070 and its really quite sweet. I have G-Sync running on my Free-Sync capable monitor and it helps a bit, but as its a 75 Hz monitor, not all that much. ;)

Always knew I didn’t get out of that office damn near enough. I’m the Captain, head of Vault Security, a position I earned by leading a platoon of T-51s into the damned Chinese Base at Anchorage, Medal of Honor came with a job offer from Vault-Tec. This was supposed to be a cushy job. I was going to retire to a cranberry farm after Reclamation and maybe find the right girl... too bad the one I found - enough of that.

Now I gotta keep the damned bats off the rest of you... some retirement, huh?

Anyway, if any of you see the Overseer you let her know that she and I have some unfinished business - it’s also no damned business of yours!

---
My girlfriend got a scorched glowing moth man once
---
 I have killed the sucker more times than I can remember. ;) He's in the Savage Divide a lot and it was my path to The Whitspring for a long time when I quit fast travelling. The Flatwoods Monster shows up there a lot too. Him I usually stealth kill, as I know the sound he makes and I stab the sucker with my Combat Knife. ;)
---
Sorry but like I said I'm not educated on Skyrim. Is Elder Scrolls not part of that or is it something like entirely different?
---
I'll check back on here tomorrow and, if you haven't found anyone, I'll be happy to make as many as you need...within reason. No charge.
---
But then how will they force you to go collect more resources by spawning three Scorchbeasts at your camp and destroying it?
---
Copper/Lead/Plastic on a tinkers bench gets 30. Add ammo-smith 2* and super duper and you are looking at an average of 150 cells for every 8 copper, 16 lead, and 8 plastic.
---
I guess since Survival mode has gone players who don't now live in NW and still play, have moved back to Adventure and will get PVP at Workshops again, but are fully kitted out for PVP.
---
I may start looking into finding a PVP armor set now, only played PVE up to now.
---
Sorry guys, I was at work.  I didn't get a chance to comment back on your comments. I am happy to see we could have a little fun with this. Lol. I wish everyone the best.
---
I have tons on PC.
---
Usually there are a few mirlurks and mirlurk kings in the near by pond west of the Bog location, annoyingly distracts the fog crawlers from coming out of the trees. Killing the mirlurks before starting the event would help getting them out of the woods faster.
---
I'm talking about the website.
---
Lmao! That dam vegetarian ham. Lol. Yes, I  could not agree with  you more. I  wish you the best.
---
I didn't think that could even happen.

Its for the meat week event. You throw it into a pot near the middle and you'll get legendary script

You take it to Grahms Meat Cook and exchange it for scrip at the grills.

Youre right. It use same pattern as unyielding and nerd rage etc

Over by Vault 76, the event starts on the hour every hour.

I set Camp in the savage divide near alpha and they randomly attack my base. Killed 3 in the last month. Even killed 2 Flatwoods monsters in the same amount of time.
---
Thanks!!

12est, I believe so. Bc last time, old Meat Week end on 12est in weeks ago. Hope, this helps. 👍

Pm or am? And thanks

maybe wastelander settlements will be in separate cells and therefore unnukable ala inside whitesprings

My character is a raider who is left over from the Top of the World group. She lives right by and sometimes when people are near my camp I'll stalk them and spook them a bit with raider antics. Lots of fun when people to back!
---
Demolition is a waste for just an exploding weapon.  Use 1 rank maximum.  Bloody Mess 3, Adrenaline 5, all 9 commando perks, etc.
---
Umm.. Im on pc. Where is this bag. Comando laser is hungry.
---
Hunting Rifle pretty much sucks unless you can’t get a Lever.
---
If that was the case My team would’ve heard a lot of I’m gonna get you boi as I’m chasing someone
---
lmao what???
---
this game definitely needs more non-feral ghouls.  Gob is one of my all-time favorite fallout characters... I'm surprised and disappointed there's not a ghoul town like Necropolis or Underworld
---
Fighting scorched is no problem I just wanted to know which turrets do mist damage to them to make the fights slightly quicker
---
You can’t there’s only 1 kind of crappy roof
---
Now THIS is a smart idea. I support this 100%
---
Always AM. Np.
---
Wana do another?
---
You can only trade it in increments of 5, and only 15 per cookout.
---
It’s the stupidest event ever . Idk about you but I don’t want to pick up poop and kill rabbits
---
Sweet
---
I think I have more than 15.  I’ve killed sheep squat here like 10 times among other creatures.
---
I was careful to put it in a place to not cure the rads of a bloody build.  Pus with the radstag there is only one little place to cure the rads.  you have to be very deliberate.
---
For a studio that size, yes.
---
Sorry to hear about that. With no disrespect to any one, this has become a joke again. If you say you are fixing something, keep your word Bethesda, and do it. We aren't your donkeys, we are your player base, honesty goes a long way. 
---
I have had this problem as well on Xbox, and I have had some hard crashes that have caused me issues with my Xbox, where I had to do similar, restart my Xbox, but the load screen for the Xbox would not boot,  and I had to pull the plug for 5 minutes and then restart it again. Not with meat week, but the SB Queen, 3 times now. It can't be good for anyone. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you the best.
---
I used my explosive guns from range and as enemies draws nearer I change to non-explosive furious to handle the crowd
---
I’m beginning to wonder if the reason they haven’t put out any Enclave or BOS items is because those factions won’t be part of Wastelanders. Really, if they don’t want to smash existing lore to bits, they kind of have to leave them dead.
---
Did my part, couple hundred tonight...glassed cavern, big bend tunnel, Morgantown Airport and train yard. Rinse and repeat :)
---
I've ran into a couple furious mothman and twice ran into and killed the mythical flat woods monster.  Pretty cool when it happens.
---
Ah.  Thanks.
---
Bedtime here in the UK, feel free to add me though buddy
---
I had one. Sold it to Wallace, as the Veil weighs zip. ;)
---
6 for handmade around 4 for combat or fixer, all ap reduction mods including -25% legendary effect counts from base ap cost. I even made a video couple weeks ago showing how mods are affecting ap cost based on regular fixer (before legendary was possible) https://youtu.be/5Pb33QSP7Zk
---
...and yet they still continue to sell it for 500 atoms.  Now that I know the above, I won't get it.  It's something I have been on the fence about, but now my mind has been made up.
---
Yeah whitesprings vendor next to the crafting area.
---
Yes that’s what armor is in the fallout games and that’s what ballistic anti armor effects
---
Perhaps a defence mode in the enclave bunker with defence getting power armor and so super mutant attackers
---
How does the math work?
---
I would just like to Bulk it in my vending machine.  I could sell it if it wasn't 1Cap per bullet or more.
---
5mm ammo should be sold in bundles of 100.  
---
And on that .... the 10mm weapons need some love in regards to being buffed to be viable.  The SMG needs a silencer, faster fire rate and way less recoil. And the pistol needs to be dual yield.  That would make 10mm ammo worth something.
---
I can make it for you in about 2 hours. Add me and I'll message you when I get on. Fat_Boys_Brunch
---
How many scrip do you get per 5 meat?
---
I hope not having them have a very detract presence would be disappointing
---
Used to be able to buy it from Enclave Production but no longer (sure of that), now only drops from Enclave events (fairly sure of that).
---
Send us the link to your build! Did you find a nice fatman?
---
steel, lead, and gun powder.  Even if it is at ridiculously small rates like 1000 10mm ammo scraps down to 10 steel, 10 lead, and 10 gunpowder ... double that with "Scrapper" and "Ammo" perks equipped.
---
Derp! Well I can pass along where I have found 3. I had a camp on the water at site alpha, and they came by sometimes.
---
Too expensive in materials to use and ammo is too heavy even with ordnance express x3.  It’s DPS is way too low on late game enemies, and useless in PVP.
---
That would be cool... like you could select wanted item: bulk acid then price: 20 caps and like a vendorbot, the person could go to your camp and sell it. 
---
Stash space would automatically save enough storage for the acid.
---
I tried at one point. But it had many flaws. Main one being the ammo consumption. Which i kind of fixed by just punching things with the fat man but that just broke it faster. It's ammo to damage ratio sucked real bad meaning I needed multiple shots to kill scorchbeast....
---
It also didn't work well in doors.
---
You need to do the other quests given by Rose to complete Missing Link.
---
No one is for certain but it’s a curved line graph of damg to anti armor penetration
---
I pretty consistently save up a bunch of plans.  When I feel I have enough I look for a low-level player, travel to their camp, and drop it in front of them.  It's always nice to suddenly be able to make everything that you can for a camp.
---
They were just trying to avoid getting reported for duping and glitching.
---
The gun is kinda held back by its rate of fire and magnification and rate of fire.
---
But what i mean is how is it possible to fit that much in a stash/vendor
---
Yeah, I think what Bethesda means by 3* legendary is that we have a chance for UP TO a 3* drop, not a guaranteed 3*. I agree it's total BS and I'm tired of it too.
---
I mean they are seeming to be doing factions bundles at the moment so it's a safe bet that the enclave will get their time........in time.
---
When was that? Such situations were common in the days of easy duping and bobblehead stack glitching, people would stack hundreds or thousands of bobbleheads and one shot the queen.
---
You’d think so, but they do surprisingly little damage. It’s a novelty weapon.
---
There have been glitches that allow you to put more stuff in your stash.
---
Patience.
---
I wouldn’t mind that for the Camo Combat armor skin. I haven’t even been able to use it yet. All they’ve Replied to me is that it’s a known issue and they’re working on it.

Fireman Jim was born in Beckley in November 2051, the son of a professional race driver and a young mother, Clover, who died in childbirth. Young Jim was un-preposessing physically, although unusually nimble with his hands.  He was mildly talented in science at Woodrow Wilson High School and was granted meritorious admission to Vault 76; really though, that was mostly through luck.  His father, Isambard, was excluded due to his risky and unorthodox lifestyle.  When the bombs fell, Jim was escorted into the Vault, forced to watch his father stoically remain behind the gate.  Jim always resented never getting his driver licence because he grew up around cars and driving with his dad who was a bit of a wild man (drove mostly for Corvega factory) and presumably died soon after the bombs fell.  Nevertheless, Jim adjusted well to life in the vault and became a reactor technician and general handyman.  Initially angry at the loss of his father, Jim had some good mentors in the vault and eventually grew greatly devoted to vault tec for his opportunity to rebuild the world.

I lucked out with my fishing shack build. You’ve seen the spot on here, it’s on the water next to the red fishing boat. Through sheer dumb luck my foundation supports create an optical illusion with the water reflection which makes it look like they rise up *out* of the water instead if hovering just above it. I’d definitely try to recreate that if I were to move elsewhere.
---
Thanks a lot and good to know. Did you get the multiplier info from the game files?
---
The multipliers in this game are outta control.
---
Yes! Horrible rewards and nobody participated.

I'm an ex raider, investigator that documents, takes pictures and discovers the fate of multiple characters. My current investigation is the monorail and the professor who tried time traveling. My parents never returned back from their trip to help a scientist so I assumed they died when I was a young teen. I wandered the wasteland until I started being stalked by a deathclaw that I didn't even see. Thank God this group of people dressed up in spikes showed up to turn that deathclaw to swiss cheese. I grew up receiving training from the raiders. I was the top best stealth sniper, with my slim body and high climbing, I could be every where. I terrorized Appalachia. I even laughed and had fun making people run. That is, until they asked me to shoot the parents on the wagon with supplies. There wasn't supposed to be kids on that wagon. I realized then who I became. I couldn't pull the trigger. So it came down to either I shoot them or they shoot me. So I stood up and shouted to that family to run. I was tackled down but after a quick brawl I managed to take the knife out of my boots and stab my boss in his chest and I left running. I ran so far and kept running. Until I found some vault people coming out. Decided I no longer want to kill unless I have to and started being an investigator to see who killed my own parents. They were closely working with the professor who went to pylon 13. Occassionally I would stalk the vault people and shoot near them to see how they react. I grew up as a raider. I may not kill anymore but a girl still has to have fun one way or another. The thrill of crawling away is fun when they take out their best weapons or sometimes they just run away. But back to my story. I travelled all over the monorail looking for evidence of it working. Evidence of this time travel. I couldn't find my parent's bodies nor the scientist but I have a blueprint and a clue on how to reconstruct the experiment. I even found evidence that they may have travelled in the past based on structures that provide clues and coincidences on what happened. Like someone from the past was trying to say something.

I'd like an SS officer uniform.. a pink SS officer uniform.
---
It does seem high, and it is alchemy.

Stealth and headshot really bump up the damage.

Thanks for checking!
---
Both weapons are non-junkies and my char isn't addicted so that's not the case for me :)
---
Not as rare as flatwoods monster
---
No problem glad it’s not just an issue with my character. I had my friend also tell me they was having it with their junkies 25% fire rate .50 cal machine gun. It’s a strange bug that’s for sure.
---
It would be pretty cool if it did, but I doubt they put that much thought into it.
---
It’s started at 12 pm I assume it’ll be pm again for the end
---
Through some stealth in that mofo.
---
I created a dual-chain flaming chainsaw, looked cool, sounds, but yeah, not great on damage.  I don't know why.  I think I sold it off, because it was too cool to just scrap :)
---
All they have said is November. But id say there is a good choice for them to release it on or close to the 1 year anniversary
---
With my level of faith in Bethsda, I'm sure you will find the tooth fairy before they fix this.
---
Lame.
---
We? Do you want a skeleton outfit too for the other person?
---
I do have ps+. Ill probably get it .. I just wanted to know if its fun.. There was so much complaints around it. How  good is it compared to fallout 4?
---
that is pretty cheap.. I am in NZ though.. No idea what the prices are here.. Lets see. I will probably end up getting :P
---
We're cool on that one. Would you like anything for it? We have a MASS of magazines that you may have in return. I (the Nix side) want to have the outfit and take pictures at the Pumpkin house.

There are rare ghoulified yao guia in the game.

Didn't try harder enemies, but still... How can those 64 get to 460? My instigating revolver should jump from 164 to... 2000. And it doesn't happen. My rifleman character with sniper perks, multipliers and his instigating crossbow should be causing 3000... It's weird.

I had a lil rng luck earlyer was running in and out of the cabins at whitesprings. Came across a 3* glowing goul and after killing it.i seen it gave me a 3* armor peice.
---
You know what I really want to see in the game this winter is santa ghoul.
---
I still don't get the numbers. It's 7 (Seven) times Pipboy damage. Not even my Unstoppable Monster gets that type of math.
---
Here you go. Big old upvote from me
---
Also I bought the hot rod power armor station from the atom shop and I can’t build it at my base.  I’m level 40 so I don’t know if that matters.
---
Dude, lvl 8 here
---
You’re a fuckin’ beauty
---
They better have good content for high levels.
---
For some reasons, cryptids really seem like my camp. I’ve have a Flatwoods Monster, and more importantly, a Mothman encounter. I think it was a scorched mothman. Me and my friend died to it multiple times, but luckily it was right next to my moment we respawn.
---
I have a feeling Oct 23rd we'll hear something
---
Some Places have better acoustics. Morgantown Airport is my fav. Jamming place.
---
Given your well crafted replies and depth of knowledge about the 10mm SMG, are you able to compare and contrast it with the other SMG (.45 version)?
---
That's a super cute idea
---
That's just the first thing that came to mind because I've had the same thing happen when I test guns at west tek. Some times the mutants will all be lower level and I'll take them out with like 2 bullets and it took me a minute to realize it was because they were lower level. There might be some sort of multiplier for damage against enemies lower than your level, or no to very little DR on the enemies messes with the multipliers
---
I tried with my explosive expert. It was fantastic to see those 4000 ish points of damage on the Pipboy, but it wasnt able to kill shit. I expected to rain pain on a group of supermutants and had to run to save my ass. I still have a bloodied fatman in the stash because maybe explosives are fun to use during Wastelanders.

Add me and get 1000 of them. Just bring 44 or 10mm. I use those.
---
Additional suggestion for Nukashine: The safe area around Vault 76 does not apply to Nukashine. ^/s
---
Missing some damage from Adrenal Reaction mutation and Mister Sandman, but still that's gotta feel pretty damn good to finally be able to dunk on those nuclear fart dragons.
---
nah, in the right sub, they’re just good. anyways, do y’all know how to fix my problem??? i cant figure out why i cant hear my friend on ps4, not i game chat, parties or anything
---
Autumn began, like, last Monday.
---
Give it some time, man.
---
But I want it now though man
---
In my previous response.  Only on weekends, but get what you can
---
I want a solo version
---
This game is buggy enough without releasing another update before it's ready.
---
I like to kill scorched to farm steel too with the scrap perk.
---
I don't know, I'd say its more unimmersive when I'm in an event area and I see 10 people wearing dresses and mole costumes jumping higher than a building and killing everything with one punch.
---
I would buy atoms for that.
---
A secret, hidden multiplier when your level is higher could be a thing, but... I never read anything about it.
---
That shouldn't matter so long as you have the plans for the power armor station I believe. Also I'm not sure why you wouldnt be getting script sounds like another bug.
---
I would do it but I have 3 alts in the go so....
---
For some reason some person dropped a nuke on Grafton. While I was there in my PA I ended up in a nearby creak. My radition meter dropped from +6 to &lt;1.
---
Well... It's worse when the corpse just disappears. Waste of ammo on a fucking 3 star glowing sheepsquach. God knows I spent ten minutes looking for it.
---
Wiki book?
---
To be honest, it's hard to see a 1* enemy lately, even 2* is not as common as it was a few months ago, most enemies I see in the wild are 3* and I don't remember seeing then as regularly as I see now.
---
It’s cool if people don’t want to make floating camps, but please don’t complain about others doing it because it’s unrealistic. Both Fallout 4 and 76 let you scrap a single cigarette for enough cloth to make a sleeping bag. If my suspension of disbelief is going to start triggering in the wasteland, it’s not going to stop with just unrealistic camps.
---
They definitely don't effect them, but I don't think they affect them either.
---
Right right, silly me, lol. End tomorrow on 12:00 PM.
---
5% I believe
---
Is that enclave with a plasma heavy weapon on the left? And BoS on the right?
---
i always wondered that too. you get so much like: Rank paints for t-60, the outfits just by farming tech data.
---
Whats enclave get? an officer uniform, scout armor, and various enclave plasma rifles, which you cant even mod unlike the ultracite weapons. 
---
The X-01 paints are mainly atom shop, only "free" ones are the military green, proto (if you didnt swap) or standard
---
It's random. I don't think it helps you get better loot but it might help the cook complete faster. As long as the cook completes at the max reward point you should get something each time regardless of prime meat.
---
This last patch is Glitch Bug city.
---
How would I be able to tell I’ve down at least 5%? Sorry if it’s a dumb question
---
Guess how much a mini-nuke deals to the queen. 1 damage
---
Idk I've been running around killing stuff and I dont think that's it, now. My damage seems to be about the same no matter the level but the lower level enemies have a lot less HP so they go down quicker
---
I have met Mothman maybe five times, vs fifty times meeting the Flatwoods monster. So, rare.
---
I bet it's just a visual glitch. Sometimes I see something like 50 screws for 2 or 3c each on a player vendor but when I try to buy all of them, nothing happens, but if I try again buying one by one, I can buy some, like 10 or so...
---
Their main strength in this game is blocking airborne diseases and preventing gas damage
---
If you bring me a bag of 10mm ammo I Will give you an instigating faster swing ski sword which weighs less than a stimpak. One armed melee can be fun.
---
My character, Esquilo, was a former member of the enclave's C.H.I.L.D. training program (where they train selected soldiers since they are very young children). 
---
Esquilo is a mute (due to trauma from child training) and has learned to communicate through gestural language. 
---
After completing his training, Esquilo was assigned as a covert security guard in vault 76 (he worked as a security guard while spying on vault 76 for the enclave). 
---
When the vault doors opened, Esquilo, tired of being a subject of the enclave, took advantage of the chaos and attempted to escape the control of the enclave (destroyed all of the coms and tracking devices that he was aware off). 
---
He was one of the first to leave vault 76 searching for a quiet place to camp and live his life on his own terms away from the controlling grasp of the enclave.
---
Since he found freedom Esquilo has become addicted to 5 different drugs and became heavily mutated.
---
I get too manny of them from the event in flatwoods from killing all the robots.
---
May not be under, but in? Vault Tec looked at putting vaults into space IIRC from the lore.
---
Go to the fallout76 market. Should find sellers there
---
Yeah, but I can walk around Appalachia with a Minuteman General Outfit so I don’t think they care too much about that.
---
Or better yet, ingame!
---
What’s his GT? So, I can buy it from him, ha.
---
My characters parents were wealthy socialites in the mothman cult, but then they accidentally got pregnant, so instead of joining the other cultists with the Mothman's prophecy, they bought their way into the vault.  She was probably one of the first kids born in the vault, and her parents died while she was young by getting fried while fixing a reactor.  She ended up isolating from her fellow vault dwellers when that happened.  She dug through her parents stuff and found out about the cult's plans, wanting to know more about her parent's past, she waited until Reclamation Day.   She followed the cult's story to Lucky Hole Mine.  She got scared by the Interloper, as it wrapped a tentacle around her arm and burned a black twisting mark around it.  She ran the fuck out of the cave but tripped over some cultist robes she hadn't seen when walking into the Interloper's lair.  Now she's a priestess for the cult with a travelling church, at which her fellow cultists can commune.  I also occasionally do a cross map pilgrimage to Lucky Hole Mine and drop a few blood packs at the interloper as "sacrifice".
---
Highest I've seen is a 400 lol
---
When things are going bad and you just need an escape, have a shine.
---
If you are level 50+ and you just go out there swinging at her you should have no problem. There have been plenty of times where she refuses to land for the whole fight and I have to pull out a gatling gun on my unarmed character. I think he hits her for about 6 per shot with that thing and I only hit her with short volleys in between cleaning up the trash on the ground. Never had an issue getting loot off her. 
---
Completely different story when she lands.
---
My username says it all. Former postman. Now I’m the last Fire Breather.
---
Thanks man. Would a TSE tesla rifle do some damage? Cause I have one and have used it on scorchedbeast before and it doesn’t really do much from what I’ve seen. I have an instigating handmade as my other rifle
---
How manny MMO's have we all played were things actualy disapear..in ESO we the players were to end the dragon threat yet there still everywere.WoW enemies all still everywere even tho you compleated areas to rid the enemies from the lands.nothing will go away in 76 all Scorch beasts will be there.
---
.50 caliber rifles are great for their cost of ammo/dps ratio, and I spent my first 60 levels using a hunting rifle with a short barrel and glow sights until I found an instigating +fire rate rifle
---
not soon enough
---
I bought mine off of the Responser vendor that spawns by Charleston Station. Only like 240 caps if you can catch him.
---
The only diffrence is we will have Human NPC target Practice when dropping nukes.then see what happens to them.
---
is that another page?
---
Well now I just want a Little Bo Peep feral ghoul that spawns with the 'squatch.
---
I remember seeing one at a similar level ages ago.  I felt sorry for him...he was up at the ammo factory trying to fix the vertibot pad but he wasn’t having much luck because it seemed to break every time he fixed it.
---
Same here.
---
seen a guy who was level 945 before said he was gonna get to level 1337 then stop and just hop on to show off lol
---
Highest I ever saw was lvl 517. Damn, you found the 50 foot shark.
---
And bath water, don't forget the bath water
---
I've legit seen a level 1,002.
---
2 Million as of a few minutes ago.
---
For Wastelanders, they should make certain workshops like Grafton Steel and the Munitions Factory faction-held workshops that only become available to capture periodically. While your faction holds it, it adds claimable scrap/ammo/healing items to a special claim vendor belonging to the faction. When the workshop is open for capture, members of the capturing faction have to fight waves of opposing faction NPCs defending it as well as any players from the holding faction who came to defend it.
---
Most of the time I've run into greifers, it was because I claimed a shop.  I've hit them in the head with sniper rifles and they don't die.  I've shot them point blank with missles and they don't die.  But everytime they shoot me once I'm dead in one shot, so this is what I've learned. 
---
a: they are always higher level and use weapons that will one shot you every time.
---
b: they usually leave shortly after if you don't reward them an you can retake your workshop.
---
c: check your caps before you decide to fight, because if you have lots of caps they will stick around to farm you
---
d: when all else fails, hide somewhere in the area so the workshop remains contested so they can't actually take it.  Move slowly and pick your spots carefully.  Try to pick a spot where you will get a clear shot on them if they find you and keep rebuilding your turrets if you can.
---
Idk
---
lul
---
Ive seen level 500 before. But i ask myself at what point do you say maybe i should put the controller down? I agree with the last part of the title..... Jeez Usss. Jeez Uss indeed.
---
Yes tesla rifles work awsome on her. I use my 3* tesla rifle on her all the time.
---
Most likely from artillery exploit as majority of players who did it to pass limit and duped never got banned at least on console. Played nothing but 76 for months and met a lot of people including people who used exploits and none of them got banned and a some still play. In short Bethesda desperate right now hence why no perm bans on players outside of EXTREME situations hence why you see a lot of people with the extremely rare faschant event masks and on PC the combat helmet thats not in game yet but someone took from dev room and duped.
---
Have never played a game where "3* gives guaranteed 3*" 
---
That seems like a sure fire way to break the economy in less then 24 hrs.
---
They should get just this once for their buggy items. What a joke.
---
It's really not that hard to level up though and with the time its been out, its not that surprising. I was 180 in the first couple months and then stopped playing for ages, started again 2 days ago and I'm 188, and that's only playing in the afternoons
---
Thanks so much, I took your advice and literally just helped with the event and got loot this time, that’s the first time that’s happened.
---
Yes
---
I’m usually in party and have invested 1 pt each into rad sponge and team medic. With my meager 4 CHR I share 1 with the team depending on if we’re in a rad zone or not. We have all invested into ghoulish (regen health when taking rads) so with 3-4 of us we rarely use stims outside a rad zone, and we never use stims or radaway in a nuke zone.
---
I have a legacy explosive Tesla and have tried using it on her with my commando. It hits for 1 or 3 or some unacceptable number. It would still be enough to get you loot but not worth the fusion cells imo. 
---
When a high dps group shows up and her health drops at a decent rate I'll hit her with maybe 200 rounds at most with a handmade or combat rifle on my commando or rifleman just to save ammo. It's more than enough. 
---
Don't get me wrong if the group is struggling I'll throw everything I have at her. There's times I've switched characters if she's still alive with 10 minutes left on the clock just to make sure we don't fail.
---
LOL
---
November. Worst case scenerio, December.
---
Until all the other teams notice. No one wants to be killed repeatedly by someone they can't kill back. It's crap.
---
Windows 10 never crashes, Fallout 76 on the other hand.
---
Yeah me too, no matter how much time they take to polish it will still a lot of bugs so let it out already
---
Would help with NW mode for sure if we combined servers.
---
There's currently nothing tying it to Race for the Presidency, which was intended to reward a unique PA paint for T60. The event itself is likely abandoned.
---
Most likely because this question is asked 2-3 times a day and the answer is the same every day. Don't get me wrong, I would like to know when as well, but nobody knows, nobody knew yesterday and well, tomorrow is Inside the Vault article day, so maybe then...
---
The problem with that is the game is rendering every item as an individual item and model. So they would have to basically start over I believe in order to do this.
---
R-responders too. please.
---
I was a just a regular school girl who got hit by truck while walking the street. Suddenly I was in a bright lit place that looked like a cross between a library and office space, with strange statues around me. I was immediately approached by someone who said they were a deity looking for promising individuals to inhabit another world, a world described as a barren land whose former residents destroyed themselves in total warfare. He promised me that I could be whatever I wanted to be, and go anywhere I wanted to go; I would go out and make the world my own. I took up his offer and started seeing some dark circle open up, revealing a blinding light. Before crossing over I turned and asked this benevolent deity his name, so I know who to pray to in this new world. He responds, saying,"My name is Godd Howard, G-O-D-D H-O-W-A-R-D", just as Fleetwood Mac's "Sweet Little Lies" plays in the background. I am then whisked away and awake in a cart, immediately being reminded that I was trying to cross the border and instead fell into an Imperial trap. Welcome to Skyrim.
---
Anyone over 500ish are and have used the exploit xp glitch.
---
Perfect for me to place my fourteen dollars worth of refrigerators in!
---
Whoa highest lvl ive seen thus far was a 515 or something close.
---
Shame you're not on xbox. I've always got some in my free vendor machine.
---
I leveled a character to 120 on XBox, then bought the game on PS4 and leveled another character to 120, and now I’m on my 3rd character already in the 70s. I haven’t been playing since launch. I just take advantage of foods that help with XP gains, double XP weekends, and teaming up so I can put on the Inspirational perk card.
---
I was just thinking about this I'm level 140 and have been playing in spare time since day one. What do you do to possible gain so much xp I'm getting bored playing one violent night and that's a fun high level event what do they do?
---
I've seen him at least three times in the past forty-eight hours. First was stalking. Last two, at least, have been vengeful. I also saw him long ago between the vault and the Mothman museum, but he looked more like a person dressed up as a Mothman, so I'm not entirely certain which kind of Mothman he was. Not sure if Mothman also has imposters.
---
I don’t have those plans.
---
Ok so you turn in the prime meat for script.  Then you go and use the script somewhere?
---
Pretty sure they did that for Skyrim, so I know it's possible.
---
i got a glowing mothman at one of the scenic overlooks today. killed him dead, it was awesome.
---
I don’t have plans for the station.  I was hoping to just buy the hot rod power armor station in the shop bc I can’t find power armor station plans anywhere.
---
Explosive flamers don’t suck. But in fairness that’s not how they were intended to perform at all. The “normal” version definitely sucks
---
Mine and my friend's characters were neighbors as children. Mine is the only child of a carpenter and his wife, and my friend's character's large family used to babysit mine. Unfortunately, the night the bombs dropped was babysitting night. She gets packed up with her friend and hauled off to the vault. Her parents would've made sure the babysitting family had all the right documentation to get their daughter into the vault *just in case.*
---
So naturally the first thing she wants to do after the vault doors open is go find out what happened to her parents. I haven't started filling in her story past that point.
---
I have more, cause multiple characters, but I'd be writing all night.
---
There we go. I'm not usually bloodied enough during PvP for my one-shot damage to equal 110, so I gotta keep 'em on. I don't use sneak tho to make room for dodgy. I keep escape artist on tho cuz I like to think it helps break vats a lil easier when I accidentally get caught in it. That usually just equals death tho. 
---
I thought you could not be vats'ed if your gun was holstered. Either this changed or never was tho cuz I tested it yesterday.
---
You should build a town. Call it Las Vegas..............
---
They do?
---
I can't get abandoned bogtown to register for me.  That's the only one left for me to discover before I complete the challenge.  I have crawled all over abandoned bogtown and claimed the workshop several times.  Nothing works.  Don't waste your time if the locale doesn't register after you have explored it.  Just move on.
---
Yes, but I'll never tell
---
I haven't. Does that increase it? Doesn't really matter. Wrecks as is. Think the damage is at the cap without perk buffs anyway.
---
unless you are going for one of them fancy low health builds ( i dislike them) it usually takes more than 1 shot. i also haven't tried an inciting fatman yet as i have not obtained one.
---
In previous fallout games
---
Is this a suggestion? Cuz the cards don't say that. Had my character stand up to check. Haha
---
Ya a guy tried to buy 300+ acid from me, but couldn’t. He messaged me telling me about it, I went back to camp to look and I only had ~30. We both chalked it up to a glitch.
---
Clearly a suggestion.
---
Anyone check out his page? Found these which look awesome. Check out the description line... 👽

---
Watoga would be an awesome map for a deatchmatch mode
---
I like to imagine that my person had parents who went into Vault 76, and that she was born there a year or so after the bombs dropped. Parents died before the doors opened, so she had to learn how to survive on her own. And that she has since made allies (my buddies that I've been playing with since January or February) that she can rely on, and they all help each other out where they can. Also, she's a bit of a loner, so she lives in a brick house far up north away from everything and everyone. But she's on an acid deposit cause she's gotta make ammo and smelt lead a LOT 😂
---
Don't roleplay, but I like creating that background story. Makes the game a bit more fun
---
"Scrip".
---
Not the 23rd 😢
---
Have a full set of powered/sentinel/assassins, but it is named "Powered" and has all 3 perks/effects. Never seen the Cavaliers effect/perk on a powered piece of gear, pretty sure it's only Sentinel.
---
Quack doc. No need to lug around heavy stims. Bottle of bourbon fixes anyone in need of a pick me up!
---
Sadly you can't at the moment. Hopefully it'll get released in future.
---
I apologize to you! I assumed “all” used that exploit.. I’ve teamed up with people who bluntly admitted to have used it. I honestly don’t go all out to get my character that extra boost in getting xp. Again.. My apologies!
---
I went to change the receiver and had no plan for it. I’m sure it was a automatic .38 combat rifle receiver.  I checked the web and found all kinds of .38 receivers for combat rifles on one page that I trusted until now cause another page had just only one, a refined .38... and I don’t think that I’ll have the patience to single fire almost 4000 .38 bullets😒
---
Loool
---
It's an S model without a disc drive, so it will preform the same as a S model. Well enough to run it.
---
I too have an S model and can confirm that it performs like an S model.
---
Apple Cider I would find acceptable as a kid, as an adult, especially hard cider.
---
how about you don't shoot back? nothing angers a griefer more than ignoring them.
---
kinda like spongebob in that one classic episode.
---
Weren't a lot of people in the community saying they wished there were raiders in the game?
---
Yeah, I’ve had people try this many times.  That’s why I alway put on PA when there is any risk.
---
Yes, let's do it!
---
I can help when i get on about an hour or 1.5 hours if youll still be on friend.
---
We are talking about the blue mask that looks like the marine tactical helmet merged with a gas mask? Base value 50 caps?  How did they become so expensive?
---
Mods are not the issue the constant hacking is. Mods do nothing but maybe some small qol improvements
---
Ya there is manny variance of traps 1 player i seen had a trap that forced u into a hole filled wirh pungi boards and flame throwers.
---
Hacking eh.  Dont know much about what kind of hacking theyd do a grey area to me.
---
It happens. Not too long ago one came to my camp and probably stabbed me 200 times in about 2 minutes while I boiled water and made stew. He turned his back on me for two seconds and I melted him. I LOL’d imagining how pissed if he must have been being caught unawares.
---
Im fairly comfortable claiming that ESO is more popular and has a larger playerbase.
---
I got no numbers to back it up, but thats my assumption from watching the activity, both ingame, forums and reddit.
---
Also, I think you're wrong. ESO is a great game, and I dont think it would've been a benefit to make it Skyrim Online.
---
The veil from the mistress of mysteries quests is a gas mask with no perception loss
---
Can kill her easy if someone tanks pylons. Don't know why people are scared of it either.. (if you ps4 will help anytime)
---
I could go for a prime .50 receiver. Put that on various legendaries and you'd really have something.
---
What platform you on?
---
Levers out class it. It's the way of lvld weapons. Whole game needs a balance pass.
---
There's a group on the marketing sub.
---
I tried it but it didn't work.  I find it serious bug due to we pretty much need ultracite ammo and like for the queen and stuff
---
I don't enjoy that event. Shoot, die. Shoot, die. Repeat until it fails. It's not fun.
---
It only drops from encryptid if you've finished the lying Lowe questline
---
No problems for me.
---
3* enemies are literally just saying you have a chance of getting up to a 3* legendary. They are no harder to kill than 1 star legendaries
---
Do you actually hit stuff with that Two shot explosive .50? I certainly don’t, it just sprays the area around your enemy... like that Pulp Fiction scene.
---
Ideally, but we both know that won't happen. I also have a lot of atoms saved up so it won't really affect me that much
---
It changes with your INT.
---
Xbox
---
I fucking love that event.
---
They refund every Atom item if broken.
---
I hit things enough. It's easier in PA than without because of the Stabilized Perk. It's a medium-range weapon that I only use on really tough enemies; which also just so happen to be the bigger ones, so they're not terribly hard to hit even at long range.
---
Then it's hex editing. You can change numbers like your rifle's damage or swap an item to something you want
---
Anchorage co-op wave mode pls
---
According to the game files this should work with all explosives including grenades/Mines and the legendary effect
---
Well, if it's anything it's nice to hear that this game has a livelier sub than Anthem's.
---
Legendary character is still on progress. We can say goodbye to robot companions?
---
It clearly states it's for hunting rifles
---
They can't give up with patches and adds.
---
... are all rifles hunting rifles?
---
Or can we get some enclave focused content added to the game that includes armor, weapons, and skins. You know instead of shoving it into the atom shop.
---
I think we should expect more in game loot rather than more atomic store stuff. I mean we're playing a game to gain loot, not shop from the atomic store. Sure have unique stuff to buy with atoms, if you want that bear lamp, go for it... but if that is all we see in the way of updated loots... Well... I think it's like someone pissing on us and telling us it's raining. 
---
That said I'm still enjoying the game, just won't be spending too much on buying atoms for a wiffel bat skin...😆
---
It was an over scan issue.  Thanks
---
I haven't had any problems yet.
---
Ultra light is only obtainable from plans.
---
"autocorrect"
---
Hope you're not drunk
---
These numbers are actually very very incorrect. I'll post the correct numbers for the scrap chances on things tomorrow
---
How the hell do they do that? Never heard of hex editing.
---
Aimbotting, damage increases, unlimited ammo, radar in NW, noclip. These are just a few examples.
---
Well I don’t think you’d have much left after hunting using the ASSAULT rifle as a HUNTING rifle ;) but no hunting rifles as listed as such
---
Yeah you will see a hell lot of those in no time if Bethesda doesn't do something.
---
“I hit things enough”... mirelurk queens, maybe. it’s a garbage weapon. I traded a lot of shit to get mine and LUCKILY was able to trade it for something else the next day.
---
I feel like the biggest issue is there are a lot of people that use bloodied builds, so they have no HP to sacrifice for a pylon. Let alone stimpaks to heal. Before I had a vampire's gun I would burn through a good 20 stimpaks tanking a single pylon and I'd still end up dying a couple of times. Course that changed when I got myself a lovely FFR Vampire 50 cal which makes you a lifestealing tank against the imposter, but I don't think everyone will be so fortunate with their legendaries. I WOULD recommend keeping a spare full auto vampiric weapon around, though. Just one will suffice for imposter in most cases.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
I have the unstoppable monster. Is it valuable
---
Lol atleast bethesda tells us everything going on unlike bioware that keeps players in the dark.
---
This is why I like doing my vendor runs in power armour. Only way someone can kill you in PA is with a clever flip board trap that tosses you into a pit full of traps.
---
Both hunting rifles aswell as shotguns need a buff.
---
Buy the flux and use the rest of the ingredients from what you have stashed. I don’t farm flux either. Buying the flux gets rid of caps, using the random things it needs frees up stash space and storing the serums give you easy 450-500 caps when you need caps later on. Also they weigh almost nothing so you can stash tons of them
---
I'd love it if that was true. I'm still trying to work out what energy weapon actually is worth having. Apparently something called a QFFR Tesla or something
---
Can you provide link of those photos?
---
I get far more damage on my meat hook vs my poor .50 cal recon sniper rifle.
---
What level do you have to get before the game stops giving you perk cards?
---
I’ve had several times where I’ve just taken damage until I died without being in combat. Now when it starts I just quit out which does stop it.
---
They won't. The game's direction changed towards new players. The new questline will probably be for low levels.
---
Ya except when they have themselves marked as a vender.and this is 1 reason i never go to venders.
---
How about that? New content !!!
---
I call them "zoomies."
---
Bloody hell ! I'm level 300 and had no idea
---
Doubt it. You may have found everything marked, there is much more than just that...
---
I recently noticed the lowest new thread rate I’ve personally seen here so far: two threads were posted within one hour last Sunday evening at about 8 PM PST, which would be 11 AM in Beijing and 1 PM in Australia, and there are no China- or Australia-specific F76 subreddits
---
Change your monitor to 60hz in Nvidia control panel and you can keep vsync. I lag horribly if my monitor is in anything above 60hz.
---
Hard to decide if you're getting downvoted because you don't seem to get the concept or because you called your characters "toons"
---
Too heavy?
---
That's a lie and its very easy to notice. "roughly 725". You go around posts in r/76 lying about how better you are and being very condescending at that. If I were a mod I would shadowban you. Thats a very toxic behavior to have, even in real life.
---
I've been doing that to everyone since November. You've just been avoiding me.
---
This isn’t the community you remember? There’s a reason pacifist mode got buffed in the first place. I made my base into a shopfront before vending machines and played the role of merchant, I had my base and all of my decor destroyed so many times I lost count. I don’t blame the players. People love blowing things up in games (the whole Red Faction franchise was built on this) and the only thing you can really blow up is player bases. Bethesda needs to add destructible terrain/buildings that repair 15-30 mins or so after being broke. Maybe even have things like the  trams being triggered to fall from the tracks when people enter them etc.
---
It's not impressive, he used the disarm XP glitch a while ago, probably set up a macro and left it, not sure why these people like to make it obvious.
---
Matchmaking would make events like this so much easier.
---
I think that we are in a "down" period for the game, seeing that we are in between Nuclear Winter and Watelanders, I'm sure when Wastelanders we will see an uptick in the amount of people in the sub, even more so if they knock it out of the park
---
Lol
---
Snowflake
---
I think it’s a combination of things. People are taking a break from the game until November.  Some have stopped playing the game since the end game is monotonous. There’s also been a significant lack of any communication from Bethesda on here unless it’s a “fun” post or very egregious bug. This subreddit also tends to be an echo chamber and there are many who are super defensive when any sort of criticism is raised.
---
I saw one too but I am sure he was a cheater. He 2 shot killed everything. Normal enemies 1 shot, prime legendary level 100 2 shot. He a was also looking like having an aim bot because he was killing them from every angle.
---
ok so what do you gain if u level up past 50? cause I know up until then u get SPECIAL points. Also does the experience needed follow an exponential curve or does it get linear at some point?
---
Could it be that the server thinks people are cheating? With all the pebbles counting as 'bullets'. Making the decision that there is no way a single person can shot so fast so heals the enemy? 
---
But as a follow shotgun user I hope this gets fixed asap. Having to shoot something 20 times while it should only need 2 or 3 shots is really annoying.
---
I have a Furious handmade (forgot the other two effects) and it works fine on the SBQ. I'm not doing extreme amounts of damage but enough to get the 5% for her loot.
---
Yup. Ground bois
---
&gt; not impact performance on the rest of the game world 
---
Places accessed with a loading are still in the game world, only out of reach (usually above the sky limit or under the terrain). While I'd love the idea of a secluded personal space in FO76, it would still impact performace and (most likely based on past experience) spawn an array of new bugs/exploits.
---
Always next to supermutants. They are part of the same faction so prob not fixed to find them anywhere else.
---
I think you can get them forever.
---
I was like people are actually playing FO76? Then I noticed the sub.
---
Is it anything near enjoyable to play?
---
Out of the hundreds of times I've been to vendors only 1 has been a trap. If you never go to vendors you're missing out on some amazing gear.
---
Yeah we've known about this for decades.
---
I saw a level 800+ a few months ago when they had the free trial week. Just when i thought I was 400 level higher than everyone else on the server, I ran into this guy 400 levels higher than me lmao 😂
---
I wouldn't really count on it. They are shit.
---
Not always. I haven't seen much hounds at safe n clean for example.
---
I think the improvised weapons are like guitar swords, commie whackers, death tambos and things like that.
---
Lol do you also ever cross street? Cause, you know, car might hit you that one time.  
---
Just kidding. Stash junk. Go visit vendors.
---
This game is all about aimbot bruh... ever heard of fats?
---
Lot's they need to re do... Whole game needs to be looked at from lvl 200+ view.
---
Total overhaul could make things much more interesting. But it would include serverly gating what people can switch up to.
---
I don't think fallout players are ready for picking your specialty then sticking to it and relying on others where they dont excel. That's more of a mmo game.
---
That can't be right, can it? I thought once you get enough cards that you had all the ranks of them it didn't give you them any more? Or is that only when it gives them in those card packs?
---
All it takes is 3 seconds from clicking on OP's name, scrolling down his reddit history and finding out he's on PS4. Just sayin'.
---
Nice, my character had a father who was a retired firefighter. He got into the vault but his father and mother did not make it in and stayed home in lewisburg. After the vault opened he found the responders and firebreathers and decided to continue their efforts against the scorched by seting up an outpost by lewisburg. On a trip into lewisburg to learn about and cull the scorched in the area he found the service award fireaxe his dad got which now hangs above his bed in his outpost. My character also found a deathclaw egg and raised it as pet, but that has very little of importance in his back story right now.
---
That vault door opening is Vault 76, though.
---
Nothing to see here.
---
Does that place always have hounds? No matter your level? Never a low lvl Mutant?
---
I agree there so much that needs re doing or just that needs to be added, I could write a bloody novel on things that should have been here from the start.... yeah true that, just figured since we have a behind usless legendary weapon might as well create a legendary armor set to go along with it so they could go hand in hand, think about it, you’d be doing around the same damage as bloodied (without adrenal and nerd rage) but you’re at full health, only downside is no armor
---
Fucking give us normal respec I don't wannna grind and level 20+ levels just to change up my build..
---
Thank u
---
I never visit vendors hanging off a cliff, or that aren't on a lower floor.
---
I low-key feel sorry for those people. Like I've been playing since launch and only have 120 levels, with 740 hours. To me, that's a lot, so those people must be spending every waking hour playing the game
---
Damn, i am only in the 80s lol.
---
I am lvl 86 and i have only been playing for about 3 weeks. But players in the 800+ most likely used the xp glitch.
---
Meat week has an exp glitch too. The prime cuts event near the top of the world sometimes spawns honeybeasts that spawn infinite swarms of bees that instantly respawn when killed and you just shoot into the swarm and get exp till you run out of ammo or the server crashes.
---
I found a chain-wrapped bat, which works. But still, even if the bladed tire iron isn't considered improvised, it shouldn't be considered blunt, right?
---
don't know about exp needed t at higher ranks,  but after lvl 50 you get to pick a perk card or move 1 special point to different attribute
---
when normal fallout fans meet mmorpg fans
---
After level 50...no more SPECIAL points. You get to move a point or pick a card to swap, and you get a card pack every 5 levels I think.
---
Someones salty as fuck... Lol
---
I don’t run bloodied. I don’t mind running pylons cause I keep lots of stimpacks. But I still die with 1 hit from the sheepie. If someone could tell me how to stop that, I’d be glad to go {PS4}. But otherwise it’s a waste for me. That beatch don’t like me!
---
So bitter.  It's a video game and none of it matters.  The point is to have fun and that is fun for him.  Just because someone doesn't play the game the same way you do doesn't mean they are a dick.  You just fail to recognize that being on  the receiving end of trickery means it's malicious intent.
---
I was going to say West Tek. If you need to kill a lot for Atoms I'd say just server hop.
---
Right, I started at Beta but I’m 93. I noticed my higher level friends will spend a lot of time running through the same spots etc etc. I’m here to play, not run errands. . So I lvl slower than them obviously.
---
I never said I don't remember this, i said it's not the nostalgia i enjoyed. I had the same stuff happen to me all the time before they made those changes too. That stuff made the game terrible.
---
I cant stand the lack of petticoats. It makes zero sense how skirts have their floof
---
Usually some people n Huntersville as well
---
1005 is the highest I’ve ever seen.
---
oh cool, thx. unfortunately my pc's busted rn so i cant enjoy Appalachia :(
---
No man.
---
I keep pacifist on and don't attack (hence they are just wasting ammo). I just stand and wave and ignore them. But then they follow you around the map and it just turns into bored annoying nat that doesn't have anything better to do with its time. Nothing's more annoying that going to loot something and someone is just spamming explosive bullets and stuff just flys away, glitching into the void. Yeah, I'll find a new server, dude.
---
It’s at the moment probably the rarest plan to get
---
Its always on, but it solve all the issues.
---
I'm level 380, don't have the plan.
---
Totally this.
---
Yeah, I agree that is definitely a big reason, I guess post-wastelanders will be a big litmus test
---
Hate when people do what they enjoy.
---
It's legal speech. They are not ackknowledging any automatic claims on this bug or establish presedence with it.
---
There's no objective answer to this. 
---
ATM I'm not playing because of all the issues I've seen and are not happy with. I may do in future but it may not be for some time. On the other hand, people are still enjoying it now.
---
One thing I can say with some degree of confidence. The first 40 levels or so can be really fun. Challenge is decent. Rewards are decent for level and effort. Some areas and quests are fantastic.
---
If you take the game at a slow pace, explore everything you can within an area before moving on rather than rushing through the quest-line or power-levelling, it's perfectly fine.
---
Aside from that, you need a decent tolerance for bugs. It's still a very buggy game. Better than launch but worse than it was as its peak maybe 6 months ago or so.
---
This happened the first time to me the other day. Went to a camp, sat on a sofa to get in and then fell to my death. Well joke was on him when he came to find my junk bag, I never carry junk.
---
Charlotte was born to a wealthy family who managed to buy their way into Vault 76 by having close friends in the American Gov't and Vault Tec. When the bombs dropped, she and her father were separated from her mother who was out at the time when they got the early warning signal. They were suppose to meet at the vault, but sadly, her mother didn't make it in time, and both her and her father were left utterly heartbroken.
---
During her time in the vault, her father went into a deep depression and turned to drink to numb away the pain. Because her father was mostly absent in her life, she acted out in front of everybody and became somewhat of a delinquent during her teenage years. Eventually, the Overseer saw how she was behaving and got involved by getting her to come to her office for counseling. Charlotte hated these sessions at first, but then one day, the Overseer managed to get through to her and she finally broke down crying in her arms. At that point, the Overseer became the one person she could confide in and became completely devoted towards making her proud on Reclamation Day.
---
Reclamation Day finally came, and she was left confused and scared when the Overseer left without her. Didn't she care enough about her to let her come with her? Nevertheless, she went out into to the world in hopes of finding out where she went, but the longer she travelled the more disillusioned and angry she got when the Overseer was no where to be found. She finally lost it, after finding all of her personal recordings and discovering she wasn't mentioned in any of them. What a fool she was, thinking that somebody might've actually cared about her, but in reality nobody cares about anybody in this already fucked up world. 
---
It was at that point, she met Rose at the Top of the World and found out about the raiders. Now, those were some people who saw how the world really worked. Caring about other people only gets you burned in the end. Take what you want, do whatever you want, because in the end, the only thing people care about is themselves. At least the raiders were honest about who they were. Everybody else just pretends to care until they don't. Well, from then on, the only person she was going to look after was herself, and if anybody got in her way? Well, bullets had a way of solving any problem.
---
It really makes you wonder what they are really getting out of that, you know? I've had the same, also paired with auto just repeating the same elementary school name calling and insults over and over while I just keep confused on loop. They hate that, lol
---
Water can be contaminated and irradiated. I figured the water in fallout just has tons of radioactive particulates in it. And that’s why you can still purify the water and get clean drinking water, but you get irradiated I’d you just boil it.
---
Does it still function as a gas mask? The tool tip doesn’t mention it
---
Why specifically 1337?
---
Every Tuesday with each Atom shop update, my heart breaks a little seeing no Enclave stuff
---
Apparently, it would seem you have avoided me, as I don't seek any of that out.
---
I take it you haven't optimized your build yet?
---
Usually posts are only downvoted when they have been asked  17,000 times already in the past week
---
Power armor and spamming stims
---
The DCG is rarer if it actually drops...
---
Nope it not legal at all, there is most likely something about it somewhere on their website and in the game. It’s should be in the fine print nobody ever reads
---
You can get some as plans. What platform are u?
---
I have an odd experience with the event. If I take all pylons and shoot the Imposter, I can usually make it without dying, even if I'm being chased the entire time. However, if I join an event where others are the conduits, I die from 1-2 hits over and over without having any time for me or my medic torso to apply Stimpaks.
---
I like Ski Swords - it counts for bladed, sword and improvised simultaneously.
---
I read you can hide in the cabin?!
---
Yeah there are a few super rare, I should have maybe said it’s in like the top 5 rarest. But does the DCG have a plan for the claw? I have never seen this being sold or anyone saying they have received it
---
I saw a post a few days ago that it only drops from a from a deathclaw.... I’ve been farming the sh** out of them but still nothing....
---
I've seen one around the same place
---
Wtf are “toons”?  As in “cartoon”?
---
It’s cause people don’t know what to do. My self I Have a blooded build so all I can do is run around and die, lol. But just got me a troubleshooters explosive and have some vangaurds armor pieces... also on ps4 and do the event every time it pops up
---
I’m a little confused as to what the random encounters are, what is an assault and an object in this context?
---
The squatch can still come in and maul you, could be worth standing ON the cabin, and lookin out for the head laser
---
DR Plans outside BoS are scrap learned.
---
Mods, common ones are scrap learned, rare can be scrap learned, but plans can be found. 
---
As to which Vendors, Responders and BoS will have most of the Rare ones.
---
I'm playing since launch on average 4 hours per day, 1700 total hours and I have 279+276+321=876 combined levels with an average of 1 level per two hours gained. So it is possible without cheats or exploits.
---
lmao
---
Because they add another 20+ things to scroll through in your Misc tab.
---
"The one who has no life"
---
I think it is 1 of 2 reasons usually:
---
1) they have no idea what to do for the event
---
2) their build will give them almost instant death by activating just 1 pylon. For example I’m a bloodied stealth sniper/commando and if I activate a pylon I can’t get more than 5 steps to try an activate another pylon. I’m pretty much useless to tank them but when sheepsquatch is uncloaked I can wreck her quick.
---
Those are the 2 biggest factors I have experienced
---
Also, you can not hit them. It seems, the game thinks they are standing and you have to hit/shoot where they should standing.
---
1500 damage. Enable damage display and see how much damage you do to her head. Given your weapons fire rate/swing speed, you can calculate how many shots/hits you need. For example, I do 22 head damage with my AAFFR Prime .50 Cal with 11 shots/s. That's 242 dps and I have to fire \~70 rounds to get over the threshold.
---
Nice tip!
---
Never knew that! I will have to see if I have learned that plan at some point. Sometimes I don’t pay attention to plans I learn so it’s a surprise to me at times haha
---
He sure went through a good amount of effort at least
---
Xbox?
---
I'm not hating, it's a free world do whatever you want
---
It was the year where his great great great great great great great great uncle traded a cow for a herd of cats.
---
That was a great year.
---
Not for the rats and mice in barn tho.
---
I'm only level 77 but I have found it fun so far. The locations to me are far more interesting than Fallout 4 and the overall world is just nicer to look at.
---
Still has a lot of bugs but it's playable. If you don't rush through the main quests and take a slower pace then it feels like a strange expansion of Fallout 4.
---
Grafton will have a lot of the mods for sale
---
After lecel 50 you will earn one per 5 levels
---
Lol I love reading stuff like this. I wish people would take it in good sport though instead of get negative. Think of it as someone teaching you something.
---
Thanks for that. I was majorly bummed by FO76. I played FO4 like crazy, but some of the bugs ruined a couple of play throughs.
---
Never finished the game using BOS due to a ridiculous known issue that Bethesda didn’t bother fixing. Was pissed about that and then 76 launches and the Bethesda shitstorm happened, and I never bothered checking it out besides watching YouTube videos of gameplay.
---
I’ve optimized as much as I know how to optimize but at level 140 I still can’t reliably take down an albino yao guai.
---
Yes mate
---
I am so glad this is popular in the community. I don’t often partake in fo76 community discussion so it’s good to get the feels out.
---
I'm lvl89 and I've been playing the same character since beta, seems mental to me that some people are so high!
---
I think it's normal to have trash tier weapons in the game. Hunting is very commun and must be less powerfull than a lever.
---
Just out of curiosity what do you do in game?
---
U the one that showed up just after it was finished?lol
---
I have gotten the plasma grenade plan 3 times, I am level 500 and killed an extinction level amount of Deathclaws and never gotten the extra claw plan, and I have know the Gauntlet Plan since lvl 50. It does not exist. It is either glitched atm or was never properly added to the game. Remember when Bethesda snuck in in the middle of the night and yanked everyone’s bottle cap mines?? Something like that is going on. My only guess is that if someone can craft it ( without having the mod box in their inventory) it was pulled out of the developers room and transferred to an alt that wasn’t banned. Same with plasma mine plan. The plasma grenade plan however you can grind any ash heap event or any horde event, good luck 🍀
---
Thank you back. We did a fair job on that Mirelurk Queen too!
---
You're on to something here.
---
its illegal of course, and i think its bannable. Believe or not, i do same thing in other games, people got hell of a money nowadays
---
(Xbox) I have done the event only once and with meat week occuring so often I have not seen it again. I want to get that Fixer plan (let it be know I dont know what the hell to do. Last time I did it there were several people already there.
---
WTF?! The firewall usually has no bearing on fileaccess. Are you using the windows firewall or are you talking about the fw in your router?
---
Im guessing object like crashed satellites or nukes and assault like the handy that tries to rob you
---
It is legal, just nor conforming to the TOS of Bethesta.
---
You go to a camp thats on a cliff, thats what you have to expect.
---
It is legal, as there is no law that forbids it. Just the TOS.
---
I've yet to see Nuka-Cola at the Watoga Train Station for example. Yet, the Watoga Transit Building, West Tek and Dyer Chemical restock pretty well.
---
Damn dude,
---
&gt; "Raiders" in this game are nothing more than pathetic basement-dwelling losers who need an outlet for their shitty, toxic behavior. I just wanna come home from work and unwind by slapping a few Scorchbeasts out of the sky. Newsflash: People play games to have fun. If your idea of fun is being shitheads to everyone you come across, I'd hate to meet you in the real world.
---
You’re the real world asshole here, generalizing a certain type of playstyle with a certain type of life? Haha and you’re playing an online multiplayer game set in a post apocalyptic wasteland complaining about folks doing whatever they want. You opt to play the game you’re signing up for whatever happens. It’s a Fallout game.
---
Name one Fallout game where there are no enemies and everything is dandy, everybody is holding hands and singing Kum ba yah. 
---
&gt; Y'all just wanna raid, and I just wanna fight monsters and not have to stop at my camp every five minutes to revive my cow. Why am I in the wrong for that?
---
Never said you were wrong. Go ahead and farm your cow. I literally don’t give a fuck. You made the choice to be exposed to any type of interaction the game yields the moment you logged in to play it. 
---
All I see here is some person who thinks their righteous way of playing is the only way of playing. 
---
I play as a “raider” in the sense that I just like to blow stuff up. Hide in your camp and “steal” crops. Don’t really try and kill other players cause it doesn’t yield that much fun and is pretty much pointless. So much for your generalization, dick head. Got NW for that.
---
Like you said people play to have fun. I just don’t think it’s fun to play as a goody two shoes. Let alone cry about a video game about some chumps who were messing w me. Lol
---
I've got a kinky vendor beside my pet deathclaws "house" I built for her.
---
It's got random things that are priced at face value for the most part. Stuff like hand cuffs, prison collars, bulk leather, bulk rubber and bulk oil, stun batons, RP outfits, duct tape, cigarrettes, marine wet suits and mask, various "toys", dog helmets, dog food bowls, yard sticks and spatulas.
---
I read it all and let me first off, thank you so much for all of this. I usually play in a team of duos, so the reviving ones are actually very helpful! Like I said, since I am quite new, it's a bit hard to get the hang of things, so these informations were very helpful! I will check this to add to my build instead of investing in Strenght all the time and an occasional pharma pharma. Thank you for your message, it was a pleasure to read it!
---
Jump on top of the cabin. Or alternatively place powerarmor frames to block the door.
---
I like your logic. I feel like my pastie white toon (not modeled after me I swear) also stands out, so I use a dark underarmor. I have dropped it for more useful items too though
---
Super easy with friends, makes me wonder if everyone plays this online game solo for some reason.
---
It would need better damage at least with the .50 receivers, currently the refined .50 receiver is even slightly weaker than the basic .50 one, that does not look right. I would add a hardened .50 as well. Also, to give the weapon at least a niche advantage, buff the range and accuracy to make it actually better for long range sniping than (semi-)automatic rifles that do not deal much less damage per shot and are more than 10 times faster.
---
Shut up and take my money.
---
Majority have left the game for me.
---
Niceeeee
---
Simply untrue.
---
Highest i’ve seen was 901, but he was at weat tek so i think he hasn’t left that place since he got there
---
It has always been 250 HP at level 1, then +5 with each additional point of endurance (so 320 HP at 15).
---
Survival is gone, so all the "raiders" are back in Adventure mode looking for easy pickings. 
---
I was playing with friends a few days ago and someone ganked them for the workshop. Like, we had been playing the same server for quite awhile...they had owned the workshop for at least an hour and then the moment they went back to it, they got ganked and the "raider" took it. They just wanted the easy kill. It's like they were just waiting till someone came along to the workshop. They could've taken the workshop at any other time we were on the server...but no..
---
Nah bro, I just explore around, do events, and build camps. I don't play to level up
---
Overall you just seem pretty salty that your not doing it too
---
Was the image updated on Beth's site or as part of a news update?
---
The XP curve is defined in such a way that there's no difference in how much you gotta grind to grt between level 177-&gt;178 and 877-&gt;878.
---
When I comcentrate solely on exping (I rarely do that), I can get 10 levels daily, or 20 if this is double exp weekend, on my level 200+ toon.
---
Conclusion, it should take approximately two months of legit, exp focused grindy grind to get to such levels, but you would have to stop doing anything else, no exploring, no camp building, no hanging out: load, shoot, kill, repeat.
---
Glol!!  Not the first time I’ve spaffed a load of money up the wall!
---
I see what you did there...
---
LoL it’s 30 C here in Italy...i would love some snow
---
All these people being high level and I’m level 11... been playing since BETA but made a new character. My old character was level 17...
---
in survival mode meat week was intense. Easy lure but other people try to Jack your score.
---
I think there was a mod for it in 4.
---
Huh? I have no idea what you’re talking about
---
Why are you scrolling through your misc tab? And don’t they stack on top of each other,
---
? So it’s just two things.
---
Should just make 3* items untradeble and that'll be that. It'll destroy the duping, and real world trading instantly.
---
I just want the metal barrel and chemical barrel for my camp. I have noticed if you play the different instruments in the same vicinity that it does sound like an actual song though.
---
You’re
---
There not the legitimate leader
---
They being high might actually contribute more to their levels/playtime than you'd think
---
Damn I've only earched 55
---
at level 220, I actually just unlocked the auto .38 receiver for the combat rifle. It was a Plan I got as a reward from a daily or event. I think that certain mods for weapons are only unlockable by finding the plan in the wild.
---
Feel better?
---
I don't grind much either, haven't been through Whitesprings in a month but my three characters total about 400 levels with a playtime very similar to yours. You must've explored the whole map ten times and know it off by heart
---
You have to grab the three pylons to make the Imposter visible so you can do damage, when shes cloaked, she takes no damage.
---
I mean it's very easy to lvl up without using glitches but if you want to cheat too lvl up faster that's on you, I just don't agree with his assumption that players with X amount off hours and with Y lvl did used them.
---
the battles in survival are the battles the PvE players think they are having. Some of them were epic. The chases were incredible. Seriously though you nailed it! I used to just go to Pve server to do dumb dailies like dross toss without having to watch my back but now that I can't go to survival ... it feels so peaceful? like all the action and chaos is gone. Sure it's fallout and I love fallout but my whole game was centered around this arms race that now no longer matters? I still have stuff to do and still will play daily. Just can't believe they took away such an awesome broken game mode... plus I never got to kill that arcanian88 guy or Xplod.
---
hell yeah;
---
Bloated glowing ghouls at WS used to be 600 xp each. Those were the days.
---
These are dupers who wants real cash for duped items. For me it's just stupid paying real money (usually more than for the game itself) for virtual items. But where is the demand, there is a supply - if people wouldn't buy duped items for cash, no one would be selling those. And Bethesda can't do much about those sellers apart from banning their multi accounts and, what they should do, make sure there won't be possibilities to duplicate items.
---
back in the day you could get that stuff for like 6k. it's not about TSE but anti armor or bloody explosive. I got an explosive LMG that wrecks.
---
Assault is when two groups of enemies fight, mostly. Object is like a corpse with stuff
---
Not by the Devs, but the TOS of the publisher, but theoretically, yes.
---
But that would mean that Beth needs to investigate every trade going on, which is not really possible.
---
Furthermore there are countries where any EULA/TOS that's been shown after the sale of the software are invalid...
---
So effectively, Beth can't do shit about the sale of items.
---
i got the plasma mine plan from battlebot couple of days ago. I skipped a beat for a moment thinking i finally dropped the nade plan ,but nope.
---
I have a feeling it has something to do with the current Clean Appalachia event. Like they're spawning extra scorchbeasts so people have more opportunity to kill them and reach the required numbers. Hopefully it will die back down when it ends.
---
thank you
---
The sale is actually sick. It will basically be 10 scrip per 3star reroll right?
---
It's an exploit and it's not healthy for the already stressed servers.
---
I see your point, but at the same time I rarely encounter legendaries anymore, especially 3*. Maybe I just don't play enough to have them happen much.
---
It works on regular 50 cals. Only the 1 unique version cant be modded
---
It's still bugged - I have the same problem, despite re-discovering this city with 3 of 5 characters. Hope they'll fix it some day and award points.
---
Why not both? ;)
---
They took away slap damage and survival mode how did he kill you?
---
You made my day! :))))))
---
I've got -75% Troubleshooters armour, Blocker level 3, constantly block with melee weapons and the Imposter Sheepsquatch does very little damage if I just stand there. But nobody gets the pylons. Three times in a row and nobody gets it. The event has been out for months, and it now gives a description of what to do when joining. Come on.
---
Yeah this is 100% ommitment 0% technical difficulties to make sure .ini settings, the actual settings that is used by the game, could be approached through the game client, not through text editor only
---
This gives me hope, cause I just want to run threw Appalacha with my combat rifle blazing them .38 untill it’s all gone, lol. Remember the event?
---
I read this as my game just freezes while being attacked by Yao Gui and levelling up at the same time... ugh. Yeah this game still ain’t stable a year after launch by a long shot...
---
Yes, please, but for gods sake, don't split it into 3 bundles like with raiders...
---
They don't stack.
---
I agree! I'd love a Modus stand in my home.
---
Sir I have the same CPU, my RAM is on steroids, and I have an RTX.
---
I also play on a 7 years old laptop with SLI to make things more complicated.
---
When it comes to overall smothiness, obviously the desktop wins, but when it comes to baseline stability, laptop wins hard. Its barely able to cross 40 FPS, but it doesn't fall under 30, while RTX desktop certainly does sometimes.
---
I hope that they add this function, I would love to jam with my guild.
---
Also it would be great to choose to sync to instruments in the same camp via option. Some people, like myself, have instruments throughout the camp that aren't meant to be played in conjunction with the others.
---
That's why I tank pylons. So I know they are grabbed
---
Wrack n everyone waits to see if anyone joins and because they're waiting on other people no one jumps in. Also has a reputation for attracting fuckwits that don't know how to read or follow obvious instructions
---
The meat hook is the most powerful melee weapon in the game because it double dips the one-handed and unarmed damage cards.
---
Yeah, she's basically immune to explosive damage. So grenades, rockets, fat man all useless on her.
---
I had a bloodied fat man and it was listed at 3000 damage, dealt 1 to her.
---
truth hurts...yes, but how we should get a change or why should bethesda change anything with all the blind lemmings praise them for nothing, rather than talk real crap?! just makes me sick and on top sad lol
---
Anyone know how to get most mounted plans?
---
Me and you could do the event if we had a few damage dealers
---
Lul no, max is 50% if we hit the 3x mark.
---
Only like using it with instigating, it's fun if you get crit damage as well. Definitely needs a flat damage buff
---
They're downvoting you but you're right. It's a game ,there are no consequences.You don't need to play like you do in real life( which is fundamentally the concept of gaming). Otherwise gta would be burned as heretic.  This game also has raiders and trapper as its lore.
---
"Thank you Bethesda for no scamming me". 
---
The standards are so low
---
Don't forget about pistols
---
Why on earth are you being downvoted?
---
Additionally it would destroy the trading for all of the people that have been focused on trading so far.
---
So yes in the name of fighting an extreme minority lets fuck over everybody else with collateral damage, instead of trying to apply solutions with precision greater than this of atomic bomb.
---
This is brilliant.
---
Glad to help :)
---
Change server
---
Tbh if you keep fighting her, I could keep the pylons active the whole time and deal with adds.
---
I love doing that, two of my characters are specced for pvp. People just pest and pest, as soon as they get bored I pull out a railway rifle and melt them.
---
Here is a short list of reasons why I and many others don't really do this event anymore.  
---
1) People have had a lot of bad experiences with the event and don't want to try it again.  
---
2) If you had junk on you it was as good as gone because people went to the event to steal bags exclusively (been patched but people don't actually read the patch notes)  
---
3) Trash spawns can be inconsistent. I've had events were practically nothing else spawned to distract and then I have had ones like tonight where there were about 30 gutsys and endless eyebot spam to the point it was hard to even see her...  
---
4) People don't know what to do because it is hard to read at times when all you see is explosions and your health dropping to 0 faster than a stimpak can heal.  
---
5) Legendary trash spawns distract people from the objective.  
---
6) Pylons take to long to show changes in activation so it can be hard to tell if all of them are actually being taken.  
---
7) Sheepie has a very odd aggro mechanic where she will usually hard focus the highest player making them kind of useless  
---
8) Sheepie can do a lot of damage even with appropriate armor and perks for tanking  
---
9) Lack of commitment to roles (trash clearing, Damage, Pylon tank, and maybe CC) which means all jobs get half-assed and problems start stacking up. Communication can help with this if people speak up and others are listening.  
---
10) Rewards are crap, the only thing worth more than 100 caps are the Fixer plans which are a bit rare.  
---
11) Resource cost can be pretty high for most players ( I normally blow a good 30-50 stimpaks per event tanking)
---
I had claimed a workshop.
---
If a small amount of people wanna be dicks then the whole community will suffer for their selfish dickitry. That's how it always goes. One person screws up and eveyone has to suffer for it.
---
Pretty sure the sale is on the weekend and we are currently earning whether the sale will be 25 or 50%. Could be wrong though.
---
3 star legendary, not 3 star legendary weapon. Things also aren't usually live until like 8am PST
---
It hough the same when reading the other comments.
---
Or they're like me and get easily distracted and spend way to long walking in circles around the same place
---
Yes, the vault raids have the same if not worse performance than the rest of the server.
---
Funny thing he still misses the 7600 hours challenge.
---
Ok. I’ve never noticed them as every other key stacks. But seriously... why do you go into your misc tab ever?
---
...fuck I’m old
---
The thing is that my life is not screwed over by other people being incapable to obtain their gear legitly, and as a solution for your damaged feeling of justice, you are proposing an approach that would screw me over, that would screw over extreme majority of the players I know, just so that you'd feel a little better.
---
There is no worse solution how this could be handled than what you proposed. It takes away from everybody without giving any legit alternative
---
Bladed&lt;&gt;blunt
---
Make a new character and reach the place on foot and not in a team. You can fast travel near by,but not too close.
---
Right? Takes some time and effort to set up properly.
---
Actually ... I believe that if it is illegal in most countries to sell digital goods of which you do not have distribution rights or are owned by you (the game or rather its game license may be, but not its content).
---
Took me 4 tries buying teddies for display cases before I finally got them done. Kept buying a batch of teddies, got distracted and scrapped them all while scrapping other stuff.
---
Why, though? The worst that can happen is... you die. In a game. That is all.
---
Berserker armor: the value of DR is reduced by X for the Berserker bonus damage calculations (meaning you get the armor, but it doesn't count)
---
Additionally, perk like serendipity but gives 10% dodge chance per each armor piece you don't wear.
---
I like the sounds of that better tbh!
---
&gt;So bitter.  It's a video game and none of it matters.  The point is to have fun and that is fun for him.
---
You know that making something bad for someone is... kinda evil, no? Games are not just for fun sometimes, many people play to release stress from real life for example. You are being bad if you keep "being fun" at cost of other's fun.
---
That's just trolling.
---
Found one yesterday outside dolly sods, it does looking ghoulish - slim and unhealthy.
---
My bloodied , FFR +50DRA flamer is a beast. It can seriously cause some damage. Someone told me that explosive flamers were bugged in some way and didnt work properly anyways. Not sure about that, but thats what I was told.
---
Just don't play it then
---
There is no alternative though. Bethesda can't patch up duping methods nor remove dupped items nor remove legacy items so the only way to fix it all is making 3* items untradeble. 2* star items are just as good as 3* so I don't see a problem with it.
---
If it were legal ... you would see it selling in physical and web stores of great reputation established in important countries of iron laws (China, Inidia, Russia, etc. does not count).
---
And who does the refunds?
---
I mean it’s a common weapon hence why lever is better. It’s still a decent startrd rifle.
---
there is some new plasma weapons like the plasma caster from fallout 2 being added in wastelanders
---
honestly, you aren't the brightest light out there, right? have you ever seen a school from inside? or are you stupid by nature? if i wouldnt want to play it, i wouldnt do it, and i wouldnt waste time on posts trying to make the game better, so that it's a joy to play it.
---
there's sheep, lemmings, blind fanboys...and then there's just the stupid. and even you should have realized where i see you. although not sure you got it...smh
---
Or keep pacifist in and attack. It will frustrate them even more lol
---
Please!!!! I have to play with my brother and kill him in PVP!
---
If you don't see the problem, doesn't matter the problem doesn't exist.
---
2* gear is worthless, compared to 3* items where the 3rd roll is perfect. The sentence that they are just as good as 3* items is utterly false.
---
This is not the way to fix all this, this is a way to FUCK all this into even worse scenario. Its by far not the only possible approach to handle this.
---
An approach that is literally infinitely better would be to allow scrapping legendaries into legendary mods (i.e. you put 5 weapons with some legendary effect i.e. faster fire rate, you get out one faster fire rate legendary craftable mod, you can apply this legendary mod onto any weapon to add it onto appropriate slot - i.e. 1* -&gt; 2*, or 2* bad -&gt; 2* good) - as a result players could start a "targeted grind" instead of current "randomised grind" (this targeted one would still be pretty random, but at least with possibility of setting and following goals). This alone would not only make crafting more viable for everybody around, but would reduce the incentive to pay for rare items with real money, which in turn would reduce the prices to keep people buy it, which in turn would reduce the incentive to do this bullshit, which in turn would reduce the amount of people doing that.
---
This is how you handle such issues: by providing an alternative that fucks over the niche the real-world-traders exploit, not by fucking everybody else as collateral to hit the real-world-traders.
---
\+1
---
Thinking what Berserker needs to be where it should be is something I spent quite a decent time on :)
---
Stings and wings and sheepsquatch quest line and sheepsquatch side quests (go to motel in mire and look on the table outside for one of them to start)
---
Ask him how far he is on the 7600 hour challenge. It's worth a whole 20 Atom Caps. Highest I've seen was some level 400-odd.
---
Right on man, the weapons are just beyond useless (as are some other effects) but this would be a near lil fix
---
Yeah we should be able to add a do-not-scrap mark on selected items to prevent this!
---
Wait... why the hell are you buying repair kits?
---
You can drop SH armor without the problem - I've helped crafting calibrated shocks for someone with strangler heart armor 2 days ago - he dropped the frame with pieces, I've entered it, crafted shocks and dropped the chassis back. No problem and no warnings. 
---
Trick is with "atomic shop' paints - you have to paint the pieces, remove them from the frame during crafting and when you drop the frame for someone else, they "re-appear" on the frame. I don't know if it still work, but definitely worked before last patch (I've seen it in my game).
---
It's annoying
---
Well there is the hours played tracker, like the daily and world records.
---
So leave
---
I am not afraid "to die", and i couldn't care less about the junk.
---
But what point is there for me to die so others can brag about how good their PvP gear is, when I am geared for PvE?
---
Where is the humiliation and shattered pride/ego you see?
---
What makes you hard killing a defenseless toon? Are you really so mentally challenged that you can't get your jollies in NW and need to PvP in adv?
---
I have read a lot of people saying SBQ has a lot of explosive resistance which seems true from what I have tested with my AAE minigun and TSE .50 cal. Handmade would definitely be a better option.
---
Theirs a atom mission to plau 7600 hrs so should say I.e 203/7600
---
Well back when getting killed was possible losing 300 caps each time made pvp too expensive.
---
Pvp only really exists in NW now.
---
Inconvenience. 'nuff said.
---
Brotherhood vs Enclave
---
I thought it was a bit more than that but yes, those were the days. Being able to jump 5 or more levels in a nuke was brilliant
---
Me too lol. About level 210 on 1st and only character I use now and started release day. With 2 other characters at most 30 levels together so would have been 240 if I stayed with just the 1st...
---
Like you said some people must not have lives? Or they think it's impressive being at those ridiculous levels?
---
I've unlocked all perks I wanted a while ago, unlocked almost all the mods and plans I could ever need and have an arsenal that would make the terminator jealous lmao. Don't need 500+ more levels for that!
---
Ohh oohhh they just told on themselves teehee
---
I wish they had kept the Survival server - it generally kept the griefers out of the Adventure mode - and if they WERE in Adventure, then you knew they were really dicks and not just bored Surviors.
---
Use broken armor, all the benefits with no dr.
---
That's how it's supposed to be played.
---
just a copy and paste from a response of mine earlier here, as it seems it's a unviversal response and fits to any kind of stupidity
---
"honestly, you aren't the brightest light out there, right? have you ever seen a school from inside? or are you stupid by nature? if i wouldnt want to play it, i wouldnt do it, and i wouldnt waste my time for sure on posts trying to make the game better, so that it's a joy to play it.
---
there's sheep, lemmings, blind fanboys...and then there's just the stupid. and even you should have realized where i see you now...although have my doubts on it, smh"
---
since most of what you listed is pvp related:
---
i dont fear dying/pvp.  it is a waste of my time.  80% of the time im busy doing other things (sometimes il engage if i feel like wasting resources)
---
if im not in the mood to engage its just annoying, im in passive, running a farm route, stop shooting me pointlessly, im not gonna engage back. quit blowing stealth and find someone else who wants to pvp.
---
Come to think of it I just learned something interesting about armor effects considered useless.
---
So a guy tested vanguards set, and as it turns out, whole set of vanguard bonus decreases the actual damage you receive by  around 6-10%. Vanguard is considered good and expensive.
---
At the same time, one piece of Ghoul Slayer armor gives you 15% protection from ghouls - only against ghouls, but single piece is much better than whole Vanguard set.
---
So, for PvE, armor that has 5 pieces: Troubleshooter, Zealot, Mutants Slayer, Ghouls Slayer, Exterminator is vastly superior than Vanguard/Bolstering set could ever be. All these items are considered cheap shit, but in reality its Vanguard/Bolstering that should be considered so.
---
Have you seen the shitshow that NW is on PC?
---
Dunno about that, I still get dr with broken armor sometimes
---
Mutations, perks, etc.
---
I also play to play. With all the glitching and disconnections going on can I really say that I play to relax? Kinda wish theres a way to see my charactor build via mobile.
---
Those last sentences are quite offensive and generalising; hope that wasn't meant for me.  
---
Anyway I was talking more about people unwilling to visit any vendor due to the fear of traps or dumping on workshops, because in 1 in 20 sessions someone might come and contest it frome them.
---
I feel like the one over analyzing things in regards to "dying" is you. Nobody likes dying in the game because it's an inconvenience in every way, you lose junk you spent time gathering, you lose caps and depending on how casual of a player you are those caps are slim in presence, and then respawning can be a pain if you're far from a location or of you're doing a nuke zone run and etc.
---
No
---
i'd be happy if stupids like you would leave and being replaced by ppl actually care for the game and make bethesda make it playable. would be such a great game! but yet common sense has to suffer from global mass stupidity...
---
I’ve been wondering this myself. I’ve played plenty of FPS shooters with multiplayer with no issues. Still, for whatever reason, Fo76 PvP gives me this.. “anxious” reaction, under the right circumstances. It isn’t always this way, but when it is... it’s intense!
---
How is this possible? I hve two 120 characters with 500 hours.
---
That info might be slightly skewed, yes if put into a percentage it does come out that way. But it’s the dr and er resistance that makes it better than the other mentioned pieces, I mean an extra 175 dr and er is really useful against a Tesla rifle and handmade as if used properly it does provide a lot of damage negation from players and AI
---
But I see what you mean !
---
Vanguard sentinel on a full heavy combat set is so useful
---
Yeah nah
---
It's just a trend I see popping up often in posts; was curious about it. That's all.
---
Well the game is losing what few players stuck around this long. Unless wastelanders is a huge success the game will keep limping along until they kill it for being unpopular like survival.
---
Mods would be sold irl. Have them untradeble and also 3* gear that way the only way to get one is random drop or crafting like your idea. 2* gear is also perfectly viable for normal gameplay. I have 5 unyielding pieces that's 2* and never gotten a good a 3* piece I wanted to keep. Majority of the time is just pointless ammo reduction or food or junk reduction. That's just a small quality bonus, nothing game changing. Only thing people want is cavalier and sentinal on unyielding pieces with ap regen which is just overkill for the main game aspect. Makes the game very boring so people want pvp but now that's gone. No challenge is left now for those who have unyielding cavalier/sentinal and ap regen and that is why I don't bother with 3* gear.
---
Chances of you encountering a legendary vary greatly depending on the location you are at, the enemy type, and event specific spawns. If you are going to the wrong events or locations you could go quite awhile before seeing a legendary let alone a 3\* enemy... Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap, and some of the Savage Divide regions usually have a very low chance to spawn legendaries since they are more beginner zones.
---
I've played the entire game without having a single crash/bug/glitch ever happening. Only major crash i had was yesterday when everyone on the server fast traveled to the sheepsquatch event and got out of their PA and the same time. Believe it or not its just a game, and games have glitches, no matter what. But yeah bud you can quit anytime you want cuz like i said its just a game.
---
I heard November 31
---
Each instrument adds a different piece when played together. It could be better, but it is a song.
---
Instead of broken armor (which I don’t think was how Bethesda intended the build to be played) (also I had broken armor my dr was 379 I repaired it and it stayed at 379 so like I said sometimes doesn’t work) a matching armor set would be pretty sweet
---
So many assumptions so little to base it upon.  Sorry sir but you have proven repeatedly to be unable to see beyond tip of owns nose. Have a peaceful day.
---
Demo expert is worth it if you use really explosive weapons (Rocket launcher, grenade launcher, Fatman etc.), for explosive bullets affix it's not very useful, especially when one bullet does little damage, like with 10mm SMG. Grenadier doesn't work with explosive bullets AT ALL, it's only for grenades and really explosive weapons (listed above). And, as far as I know, AA bonus is multiplicative not additive, so bonus from weapon and Tankkiller is diminishing the more AA bonuses you'll get. So shortly - you play it wrong ;)
---
I have doubles of a few cards. I've rank 5 of one set and rank 3 because I changed my loadout to suit explosive build. So you can keep getting cards forever to suit different builds and swapping out.
---
For PvP, Assassin is proven to be vastly superior than Vanguard/Bolstering.
---
For DR calculations, if you reach 250 base DR, the difference of damage taken between 250 DR and 425 DR is, as I said, around 6-10% of actual damage, all depending on the damage sent in the incoming hit.
---
I've been quite shocked when I read all that yesteday, but this math seems solid. Vanguard is commonly perceived to be useful, but not really.
---
It is though, isn't it? Guess most of the players just aren't into it. Which is OK.
---
Well I guess keep dreaming instead of using what works.
---
Oh I agree 100%
---
I guess so? I imagine they will have to make it clear elsewhere that the human wastelanders are newer arrivals. 
---
I just can't imagine them wanting to keep an older version of the game available.
---
Having a second character go to these locations on foot usually fixed them for me but I think Beckley is just still broken since it didn't trigger on my two alternate characters as well...
---
I'm in the same boat. I was on every day for a long time since BETA, I'm on about 4 or 5 times a week now, for maybe 1 or 2 hours. I'm level 191, to get to 800, you'd either have to be on every waking hour and using all the experience boosters, or your exploiting.
---
ok good for you .
---
According o the game files it should drop from deathclaws but only after you've learned the plans to make deathclaw gauntlets. That being said, a lot of people suspect that it's bugged and never actually drops

Every weapon below 'Big Gun' category should be capable of the same level of damage output so anyone can use anything to suit their personal preference.

I want to use shotguns because they're fun, but they've been nerfed into the ground.

&gt;Dying in PvP, dying in workshop through PvP, dying to griefing (which is in itself extremely unlikely), dying in vendor traps...
---
in his defense on the pvp based comments, 3/4 of the things you listed are pvp related
---
Why you're addicted to *games*, not just RPGs.
---
Also includes, golf, tennis, watching sports on TV...
---
Tattoo parlor, legendary vendor, and the burrows are some of the last things in the load order and on bad servers can take up to 10 minutes to load in if no one else has been there recently on the server.
---
Im fairly sure i can make a dcg, but yes food point I’ll check...
---
Spot on! Amen to that! Could have been written by me.
---
I have 200 hoird and just hit level 115. I just took advantage of double XP one week and me and my buddies launched like 12 nukes on that weekend. So we leveled up so much from it
---
My floating treehouse in adventure mode isnt going anywhere. D: no turrets, just an immersive build that gets a lot of traffic and thumbs up:)
---
So you've got ranks 1, 2, 3, 4 AND 5? Or you've got ranks 3 and 5? Because I'm asking if you get more of cards once you've got every single level of that card. 
---
For example, if a card has 3 ranks, it would take 6 cards to own ranks 1, 2 AND 3 simultaneously. I want to know if you can get more of that card at that stage. It's not the car for single rank cards, but I don't know if it is for cards with more potential ranks.
---
Prison collar i guess
---
I'd guess that many who praise the game personally find the game to be in a playable state and just disagree with your entire premise. 
---
Like for instance the Grafton Mayor thing. Stuff like that doesn't really make a game unplayable, c'mon. Its just a minor annoyance if even that. And that's the one example you give from "millions of bugs"? Not very good for helping anyone see your side of things.
---
Just a thought. Or maybe we're all just paid shills. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Is that how you activate it? I had this glitch once and couldn't replicate it. Thx.
---
And yes since accessories have a armor slot,i would like more. Maybe some for completing as many challenges as you can.
---
He must have no life.
---
And Wedding Ring and Old Ring.
---
Close to 900 hours and this is spot on. The number of unmarked locations is crazy and some you can easily walk by hundreds of times without noticing.
---
That's fair, but at the same time maybe people keep asking because they'd also like to engage in interactions with the community. Better the downvotes than people making asshole comments over something so simple and harmless as a question though.
---
And if you complete the grafton mayor quest it goes away. All it take is 5 min and you don't have to worry about it again.
---
As long as they get out private servers, I'll be happy. Even if the main game goes away, at least I'll be able to run it solo/with friends.
---
I really hope the game stays up though. I'm having a blast.
---
I think for me it might just be a monkey brain thing?
---
Like when I get caps theres the little noise and I go "yayy" but if someone kills me they go away and I go "naww"
---
And could we have a clarification -- does "scorched" just mean scorched humans or do scorched animals count?
---
(Of course, scorched humans are much more common and easier to kill, so it probably doesn't matter).
---
You to man.
---
I don't think it's a good idea. If you need jetpack, use PA.
---
I mini nuked a whole mob of glowing bloated ghouls with MRIV double shot and got so much xp.
---
They used XP glitches... Anyone saying those levels can be achieved legit is kinda right. Sure they can be, but nobody would play this buggy mess willingly to those levels since there are absolutely nothing meaningful to do. I played from launch (legit) and i'm \~350-400 i think.

With all those buffs and a -15% robot damage magazine she does very little damage, so yeah I suppose we could do it with just the two of us

How are you only 114 if you have been 0laying since beta? Don't get on much?
---
Sucks now it's public
---
To keep it short. Yes. I have had rank 1 2 3 4 and 5 of Gunsmith to suit every type of build. I landed an explosive 2 shot lever, so changed my cards to rank 3 Gunsmith and rank 5 Demolition Expert, while doing this I've had every rank of Gunsmith, and I also have spares that I've landed with as I got new cards every 5 ranks.

Oh, the bomb daily one in the mire?

I took vacation when fallout 76 came out and I hit level 100 in a week or less. I just came back as well.

Yeah I have a lot of hours, somewhere around 800-1000 and I see small areas sometimes that I never saw and some areas that I’m positive they added in the past few months. A lot of places are so small or well hidden some might never discover them and think they discovered everything on the map. In the corners of the map where no locations are marked there is so much
---
Join the club, my friend.
---
Because game is full of bugs and dying can make you loose items, one way or another. First example - SBQ fight - I always get there without any junk, but after you've been awarded fluxes for Scorched Earth event and you die, you'll loose those fluxes, no matter what (it's a known bug). When I get them and immediately fast travel to Watoga station to put them in the stash I risk server crash and not getting loot from the queen and legendaries that have been killed during fight.
---
They are as offensive as your question. And yes they were meant for you.
---
What are you going to do about it? Maybe the same that those that don't want PvP do and get it forced on them nevertheless? I don't care .)
---
Anyways, I'd give you the same advise we all give them...
---
Stay away from those situations where things happen that you don't like. There is no real reason to discuss preferences, at all.
---
So you've got, total, 15 gunsmith cards? And you currently have gunsmith ranks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 simultaneously at the moment?
---
Or you've got 8 gunsmith cards allowing you to have ranks 3 and 5 simultaneously?
---
Happy Cake Day Natural_Justice! You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
---
Yeah I get you, I’ve made posts doing the same and they aren’t taken well. Most of my posts here have little to no up or downvotes. But later someone says the same and it’s trending.. I think it has to do based on timing when posted as well. When all the normal nice people are asleep and the dicks are out and voting haha
---
Here's a bunch of maps, the one for Delbert's company tea shows starlight creeper locations and unfortunately, they're all to the west of the savage divide. Without fast travel, you're gonna have to hike it for starlight

Because that loading screen may never finish and then you have to reset the game if you even wanna hop back on at that point.
---
Bloody hell, I’m level 248 with 1116 hours done since Beta.
---
I work from home so often have the game running in the background, so I can drop in and out between tasks, so thought I was a heavy user, but that’s redic!
---
The fuck are you even talking about?
---
Thanks
---
Yeah.. I’m familiar with MAppalachia. One thing it doesn’t account for is the *inside* of... anywhere. So I’m hoping out that star light berries can be found. I imagine something like West Tek, or the one Mire bunker with gourds
---
Lemmings?
---
Having your shit stolen in a videogame after your character dies doesn't apply to any life lessons
---
I found ONE last night. Right behind the dam up on the ridge. Its in the beginning of the tree grouping overlooking the rear of the dam.  I looked everywhere else around there and could not find another one.  Good luck!
---
It's not worth playing a character at that point as any death from a player and you'll loose ALL your caps!
---
Because the fact it's not currently working on one specific Legendary is not a reason to refund everyone who bought the skin.
---
I agree with you since i had always good experience with ppl in this game, at the same time i'm sad cause when finally i found a cool game (i love all Fallout games and settings) with cool people, my interactions are almost 0 cause i cannot use a mic for various reasons and it has no text chat :(
---
This player use glitches and exploits. 
---
I didn't belive it until i met somebody who went from level 1 to 65 in one afternoon, couple of hours. After I asked him how he did it, he said that this game is broken and he gave me 10k nuka colas, 10k nuka colas quantum. I was busy for two hours before i could move. Fun time. 
---
Many of the exploits and glitches are still working and bethesda cant do nothing about it. That is sad for peoples like me who struggle to get one level per day.
---
Very good point, I seem to remember a few starlight berries in vault 94, actually! No other interior comes to mind
---
I've had no issues in XB1 as well. I have a friend of mine who rage quits and complains when people mess with him at workshops, but that's about it and it's to be expected. It says in the warning, when you claim a workshop, that you are open to PvP lol. 
---
With the passive mode setting and not taking much damage until you engage back, real PvP barely exists in this game unless you want it.. 
---
Closest thing I've seen to "griefing" was a random at the meat cook trying to PvP. They kept shooting everyone afterwards. No one engaged back, they got bored, and dipped a few minutes later.
---
I avoided speed leveling and made a few other characters. I also don't play every single day.
---
Usually around 10-12 EST is when the servers update. For clarification this sale is only for the surprise option which is not currently listed but is a random 3\* weapon OR armor piece.
---
Well said my friend.

Thanks for the info we have known since last year

Ahh fair enough

Used to it... been encountering alot. Double my ammo wastage

Just don't bring important junk and you're fine

I do join n make myself activate one of the pylons. But there are alot of people standing and doing nothing to help. Thats why i avoid the event
---
You write as if you’re mentally and morally superior to the poster asking a legitimate question. You hurl insults at people you nothing of. Then ask “What are you going to do about it?”
---
I’m wondering who made you judge of what’s acceptable to discuss.
---
They changed it a few updates ago.
---
It was there, thanks for the info!
---
Agree, some will immediately kill u n loot u if u take any workshop. Well, thats life in reality anyway.
---
I hope they add a single player and creative mode for when the game eventually dies and they drop server service. I'd hate to have a glorified frisbee on next to my other Fallout games.
---
Found them on Phoenix in Watoga
---
It's old MMO terminology for a character, and it is short for cartoon.
---
Interesting idea but I think the servers would struggle with multiple people doing this. Maybe if it limited like 5 people per world. And the current camp system is super buggy with saving and placing big structures so that would need to be fixed also. In a perfect world this idea would be cool for some. All this said I don’t have any personal desire for it. They just need to polish and fix everything and not add any more new shit for a while after wastelanders.
---
I'd imagine so as well. But if they're gonna keep it up with this *Game as a service* deal, then I somewhat expect them to continue upgrading the game and it's capabilities. And thus, more things should be improved if the possibilities are there.
---
Oh absolutely the core game needs to be fixed first I agree, there are a lot of builders and people who spilt play this for the camp tho (I’m not one of them I just enjoy all aspects of the game) but yeah if this could be implemented down the track in a proper non game breaking way it could be extremely fun!
---
You and me both !
---
They said private servers were coming “sooner than you think” in august. I was thinking a week so...where the fuck are they. This would be a version of single player. Obviously not offline but still, I could have all 20 of my friends working together in a server or pvp servers or whatnot
---
to anyone saying that the game is in a good place and that the bugs are only a few i say you have to be either a liar, or a fucking moron. this game has more bugs than a swiss cheese has holes. and i go as far as saying that all those that only talk only positive about this game are either bethesda scum emplyoees in disguise or just sheep and bethesda their sheperd.
---
as said, lmk, and i fill this post quick as fuck with a ton of clips and pictures that show HOW fucking broken and pathetic this game is and what kind of laughable bugs you have to deal with daily being ignored by bugthesda.
---
\- favorites being constantly kicked out the quick wheel
---
\- ghouls attacking in sleep pose
---
\- phantom damage and deaths
---
\- legendaries or any adds vanish into the ground
---
\- legendary adds vanish into thin air before being looted
---
\- server dc's, blue screens, hours for buildings to load in, graphic issues, random dmg, if dmg at all, adds regenerate health, invincible, sbq flying out of the map, 
---
etc etc etc etc etc tec
---
pls, dont gimme that crap! i could live with a "few" bugs...but here we are talking about a game that is a bug itself! while the same time these pathetic bethesda morons sell pa paints for prices worth full dlc's!
---
again, lmk and i post a LOT of proof! just created a YT chanel only for it. and only to be able to share the clips i take with ps4 share, as i'm just an amateur and no pro YTer.
---
The game hasn't even been out a year and you have spent 30 full days playing this game. Jesus christ. Do you have job? Do you need sleep?
---
But, what if, you aren't a PA build? Or alternately switching to a PA that can use a jetpack leaves you immediately over encumbered? What is the drawback of there being non-PA Jetpacks in the game?
---
I don't bother with camps above cliffs etc. As soon as I see them I walk off, plenty more to go around. I'm not that desperate.
---
When they say private servers, I imagine servers you have to purchase like Ark and tbh I'd rather play on the public servers unless they have an option for console users to get the mods on them.
---
Some hotel. There is a note on one of the tables out front that starts a quest.
---
i'd hope more ppl would call the crap out happening 24/7 daily in this broken pathetic excuse of a game we only hope to be functional.
---
Sure does. 
---
Lesson 1: Protect yo shit because people do fucked up things.
---
I am only hurling the insults right back.
---
" Is it a sense of humiliation, shattered pride and ego? " 
---
Of course people geared for PvP will win over PvE-People, and asking if loosing those "fights" are humiliting asf is just plain stupid, thus the mental challenged comment.
---
imho killing defenseless players is the same as beating puppies. No one will discuss the benefits of doing that, so why should we do the other?
---
Same goes for preferences, some like PvP, some PvE. Why discuss it? I am not a judge at all, but I question the reasoning of doing to. Preferences are personal and need no justification or discussion.
---
I literally only just started playing again after initially writing this game off, solely because I found that survival mode offered everything I wanted from the game, and now, after about a week or so of enjoyment...gone. Pretty gay, tbh.
---
I'd be down for doing that event anytime I'm online. My PSN is damian_13_666 if you want to add me
---
This^ the higher your INT the better you play
---
Because there is something inherently uncomfortable about anti-social behavior and I don't play games because I want to see or experience more of that. And before someone says it's a game about killing shit, raiders are a thing and whatnot, admitting you don't see a distinction between fantasy/interacting with AI and real people isn't really helping your case.
---
Bethesda released a patch quite some time ago that limits the number of caps you lose to another play at 50 caps, regardless of level.
---
no! you dont have to worry until you enter grafton again. nice fix! how about them fix it once and for all? that's how pathetic you clowns are! accept bugs, find workartounds, instead of asking for serious fixes in a full priced game that sell pa paints for $18! facepalm deluxe
---
Go play Minecraft or sim city
---
Yeah you’d have to purchase the servers. But if it’s like battlefield you could scroll through a server list that shows open servers and how many people are in those and what’s your connection to the world. You wouldn’t even have to purchase your own if you don’t want. Just the ability to see optimal worlds would be cool. I would still pay $20 a month for my own server though. So I could do single player or the raids without too much instability
---
I thought that was a survival only change, as back when that was announced I still lost 300 caps on death!
---
Indeed!
---
You literally had an event idea to build a town why are you bashing on this lmao?
---
Nope, it's implemented in adventure too. Also, Bethesda sunset survival mode ☹️
---
It's called balance. It would further trivialize power armors.
---
I know that they got rid of it, but even last month I lost 80 caps on death for my younger melee character!
---
I also discovered that late, while over level 200, while a team mate shows me a nice place to find firefly. There are about 5-10 Fireflys in a small hunters lookout west of the CrossHair.
---
Level 20s taking arcs is amazing but not a frequent sight
---
Most of the issues have been fixed. Server stabilty is..... questionable right now. However with the exception of the server stability which I think (well I hope) they'll fix soon most of the hate is undeserved. 
---
Also with Wastelanders on the horizon now is a good time to buy FO76.
---
It was for an event that you need to defend a horde. :)
---
I know I read it, still building ain’t it mate? :))))
---
Now that you dont even drop your junk in events I don't mind dying constantly. Oh no, I need to stimpack... Naw, I'll just respawn with full health lol.
---
Same question u/2HappySundays  ? If your on pc Id have to double check my inventory but i think i may have  a few just sitting in my shop since i do not really use ultracite power armor.looks cool hate the upkeep cost.  I do know for certain i have some of the armor pieces plans for dirt cheap but could just give them to in exchange for some x-01 mods or totally free if you don't have any X-01 power armor mods.
---
One has conflict. The other does not. I wouldn’t find this fun.
---
Okay sick opinion 🤘🏻I would find this fun, your point being?
---
You again. Ferk.

My story isn't quite done yet but I'm a raider leader that goes by the name Lola a vault dweller that fricking loves rose and vault-tec, a psycho addict to impress rose and a bloodthirsty killer. I was born into raider culture was abused and escaped to the the mothman cultist's which treated me much better thinking I was some gift from the holy mothman. But I became aware of the bombs and sneaked into vault 76 pretending to work thre (surprisingly easy). Then I got a friend that secretly was sent to kill me from my raider parents cuz they hated me. When I found out we argued for a bit then she pulled out a 10mm and I had a dagger gifted from the mothman cultists I always had with me. I killed her and escaped with only a vault jumpsuit and the cultist dagger. Then I found Rosalynn Jeffris the only raider I actually liked when I was younger. She gave me some equipment and a backpack. I tried to form a raider clan and it worked now I'm roaming the wasteland of Appalachia a feared raider leader for multiple clans. I'm still a vault-tec and mothman cult supporter. Age 34 lesbian and badass. The outfit I'm  wearing is the imposter sheepsquatch outfit with the vault girl helmet found at VTU (still waiting for the blood face vault girl helmet) and then the meat cooler backpack. I play bloodied melee cultist dagger sometimes sneak.

I'm a 12 year old boy from Sweden irl
---
1. I dont care for PVP (and I dont care for someone trying to force it on me). IF I want to do PVP I would go to the NW section.
---
2. I have lost plenty of stuff from dying due to glitches, instand death zones etc.
---
3. Having to either respawn at vault 76 or NOT having a respawn location at all.
---
4. Load screen takes too damn long
---
I'm a power armor heavy weapons build (original I know) and I'm solo. So if you ever want to squad up I'd be down. My discord is SacrisMortem#0008. I wont be home for another like 6 hours tho
---
W/o the ability to have your toons across all servers I'll stay away from private servers that I don't control because I'll never know when and if those server go down and I loose all the play time.
---
Because, in my opinion, backpack mod that changes backpack into jetpack doesn't feel right. And because backpacks weight only 1lb, to be realistic and not overpower - jetpack should change it to weight 20lbs and won't provide any bonus carrying capacity.
---
They announced that in their patch notes some time ago.
---
If it’s auto saving the same way and gives you a warning timer that the servers are shutting down like usual it should be fine
---
First off, you need to have completed the Defiance Has Fallen quest first, all Technical Data you can't turn in any Technical Data you collect before that.  
---
If you just picked up Technical Data from  a valid source (Desks, Safes, File Cabinets etc. NOT other players and such) and the quest didn't start, try server-hopping until it shows up. It's a bug that happens sometimes, changing server fixes it for me.  
---
After you turn in Technical Data it seems to stay in your inventory even tho it says it was removed for some reason, you won't be able to turn already "used" ones obviously.
---
update: i'll upload a few clips, stay tuned ,) out of the millions of bugs i call out you talk about the "least annoying" one ,) lmao...gimme a few minutes. i'll also will give all these beautiful clips an own post, deserves it i guess ,) best, on some one can see the grahm meat week event, so they are all pretty much actual\^\^
---
me again. and again. and again. and again ,)
---
...and again, stay tuned ,)
---
All the loading is just your computer not being able to handle whatever settings you run. I never have a load time over like a minute. Also just move on if you dont like the game. Its not perfect yea, but writing an essay on reddit called all the people that do like the game "fucking morons" is just childish and doesnt get anything done. Dont criticize without offering a solution
---
They were, at one point at least, the right numbers. I'd hope they've been buffed since then but hope is a dangerous thing to have 'round these parts.
---
Another person here, but I also have easy 600+ levels without any exploit. It's not something I have chased, but I do play alot tho'. Me and my friends are pretty nerdy when it comes to Fallout, so it's not that big of deal really. Some of us try not to level up after the character is done, and others just start a new one. This depends on what each of us find intresting. For example one friend has run up 10 characters to about lvl 60, complete with backpacks and all. Needless to say maybe, but we don't play other games.
---
My question wasn't meant to be offensive; I was merely asking why people fear dying in a game which doesn't really punish you for doing so (as in other survival games), e.g. folks that won't go to any player vendor for fear of being trapped and killed or players that meet workshop contester once in a month, yet want to change whole mechanics.  
---
You took something out of it that wasn't even there. Guess it must have offended it you somehow, but I won't call you mentally challenged.
---
There was a mode for PvPers but it was turned off - personally I'm not surprised this happens now, but as a PvPer I'm completely disinterested in fighting unprepared people
---
Well, don't play it if you don't like it. Take your game to gamestop and suck it up buttercup.
---
I'd love to. Hopefully someone else will show up before you get home. Honestly I'm willing to try in two if we have to, I'm down to anything.  
---
Let me know when you're ready to play.
---
Someone smarter than me did, months and months ago. I saved the numbers into a notepad doc, which would've been a lot more useful if I'd also saved what weapon mods are in each tier. Alas.
---
My main is called Mark Starbuck ex police cadette retrained in environmental engineering in vault 76 
---
upon leaving the vault and travelling north to Morgantown I met a dying traveller called John Dunn from Saratoga Springs who had been sent out from the Saratoga Springs Militia to try and contact other Militias with the goal of unifying them to help defend the numerous small settlements that had been starting to form under the fledgling Commonwealth. 
---
He was trying to get to Lexington when he was attacked by a large contingent of Scorched and after killing them all he finally started to succumb to his many injuries. After explaining his goals, I agreed to take up the mantle to help the survivors and ex vault dwellers from West Virginia in the hopes that the work being carried out elsewhere in the North East could be emulated in West Virginia.
---
One day I hope to travel to Saratoga Springs and inform his kin of his brave sacrifice, until that day  I am sure that somewhere there is a settlement in need of my help, let me just check my map.

I'm a 159 and have been playing since beta. Mind you, I did take a couple months break but I get this. I power levelled my husband to a 120 so that he could play with me as opposed to having to hide behind me but avoided doing it myself.
---
Ok
---
I get this "I don't like my player dying" on my Fallout4 combat mods. 
---
Its seems many offline RPG players, which is probably the majority of the 76 audience, believe that death exposes an inadequacy. For RPG optimisers and dead-is-dead players it is rather inconvenient.
---
I had a guy try to trap me at his camp in Whitespring, he had his vendor in an enclosed patio with a powered door. I was browsing his sale items when I heard the door close and he and his buddy start waving at me from the other side of the wall, while powering up a whole 3 tesla traps to try to kill me (lvl 160 or so at the time). I actually enjoy trap bases but this was a pathetic display. I waved back, gave a thumbs up, waved again, and went right back to browsing (all overpriced btw....typical Whitesprings).
---
Sorry, we can't all be weak, child-like carebears who need to have their hands held while playing a game.
---
Curiously, though, it would never cross my mind to suggest a game mode that I found inferior, such as adventure mode, should be scrapped. Obviously some people enjoy it, and to each his own, eh? Although not to you, clearly. ...Perhaps it's something like the bitter jealously and resentment of the weak, cud-chewing herd animal towards something strong and exceptional. The cow says, after all, "down with everyone not like myself. Be soft, ineffectual. Graze lazily. Live carefree." The wolf says, "of what worth is my life without the thrill of the hunt? What good are my teeth if I can't wage war? Let the grazers graze and grow fat and weak. I'll have my fun, then, all the more."
---
If that happens it would definitely lower the price of legendary items at play shops. That shit is getting ridiculous.
---
Would be cool!
---
I’m glad you would find this fun. But this game is about killing things and staying alive at its core.
---
Maybe a slight damage boost, say 20%. I think leave the rate of fire alone, but the gun should have a couple perks as standard that are present regardless of the mods and leg effects. 
---
I think it should have a range of 500 and also ignore 20% armour as standard. In fallout 3, some guns had higher crit multipliers than others, so I think the hunting rifle should definately have a huge crit boost as standard.
---
If you can't interact with the Brahmin then it's very likely another player has milked them already, they have a server-wide cooldown. Server-hopping until you find some that haven't been milked already is an option if you're really looking for milk.   
---
Also you're not guaranteed to get milk from Brahmins, sometimes you'll fail and the Brahmin will do a kicking animation.
---
And he didn't have no fancy bot to help heard them cats either!
---
I would love that, like community building!
---
I cannot physically facepalm any harder than I just did reading this, I’m almost certain the point of this post has gone over your head and me explaining further will do the same but here it goes
---
Nah shit Sherlock, but go ahead and start a new game save, what does the cutscene say? They talk about rebuilding.... they talk about it a lot actually maybe you skipped that? But anyways semantics aside I don’t see how having a third mode with infinite freedom to build has your nickers in a twist , cheer up mate lmao

Ok, I get this angle, thanks for the anwser.
---
Finally a rational anwser, thanks.
---
Has nothing to do with fear of dying for me.
---
 Has everything to do with I don't need my E peen stroked by fighting another player. 
---
 I have no interest in PVP nor will I ever have interests in PVP in a Fallout game.
---
 I play video games to relax not to look over my shoulder for every douchebag who wants to shoot me in the back.
---
Thank you! I think if done correctly it would be amazing and fun! Also could bring in a whole bother audience for Bethesda so there’s incentive for them

---
Who the fuck buys repair kits!
---
PS4...nice try ,) but pls, nxt time try harder
---
I think its mainly due to the display cases people start buying novelty stuff. I managed to get my full set of Teddy Bears and it was a bit of a slog finding them and ensuring they had spawned with each variant :)
---
Beating puppies is not even the same as PvP in a video game. Just making such an analogy shows the irrationality of your thinking. 
---
I sucked at PvP at first. I got griefed and couldn’t do anything about it so I adopted that bullshit reasoning as well. 
---
Then I decided to learn how it worked and improve to the point where I could defend myself.  I became friends with PvP players and found them to be generally more intelligent than their victims. 
---
Again it’s not your place to judge what’s acceptable for discussion.
---
Pistols need a mega buff first if you ask me
---
Thanks. I didn't realise other no-good varmint players were stealing my milk!
---
You went to a trap and could disarm it constantly if that’s what your referencing. I did it for 10 minutes to test it and got like 2 levels.
---
Its amusing to realize this post is just one big bait. Nice try guy
---
Heavy raider armor plans are more rare than plasma grenade imho. The one spamming  plan collector Scrooge with a B in his nick on the market sub wont admit it because he and others try to scam new players.
---
it's not. it's just facts.
---
I’m up for doing the vault raid sometime as well. I’m available most of today and will be throughout the weekend. My IGN is full_swanson.
---
well, that 18 carat run of bad luck. :P
---
Without actual damage numbers, its kinda hard to tell if its bug or not.
---
My character has a little shack in the Mire and he's doing the same thing he was doing before the bombs dropped. Hunting the world's greatest foe... Ghosts.
---
Don't get me wrong, I also hunt the occasional demon, vampire or cultist. There's no supernatural foe I won't burn with my trusty flamer. But ghosts are my true passion.
---
Looks like any fallout game to me
---
tried on a level 3 trap, works but it takes forever and you'll get a heap of junk. ;)
---
Wow, I've yet to see anyone near that.
---
Thank you!
---
Which translates to less incentive to do this, which translates to less people doing this, which turns the whole community cleaner
---
Built my 1st house near there during the beta. Those big cliffs really have a nice view. And Cryptids love spawning there too.
---
Not rebuilding with all enemies gone..
---
Elaborate on that, this’ll be good lmao give me your best explanation
---
Also r/whoosh
---
Very well. I think we should wait for the other member to be ready before we begin though.  
---
If someone else joins or if you think you can handle dealing all the damage yourself (Sadly being a medic means my damage output is pathetic at best) we can try by ourselves and then again when he comes back.  
---
If you know someone else who'd like to join that'd be nice as well.
---
Same here
---
Man, the bugs are really f\*cked up for a game launched nearly one year ago, but damn son there are perks you can use to prevent limb damage, try  Adamantium Skeleton for example.
---
p.s. you're going to get downvoted into oblivion for that post ahah
---
Point scored... hmmm
---
It’s the post apocoplypse. There are mole rats and ghouls everywhere. Unless you are claiming we someone quarantined the whole area. Your game mode doesn’t belong.
---
Not being hyper critical but isn’t posting that here a bit late? Join the community after buying the game and playing for a bit???
---
Or is that just how I do it.. 😁
---
Mister Sandman is a cool idea. I'm trying to get away from the bloodied build to be honest.
---
Okay by that logic how does nuclear winter fit in and belong? How’s an entire vault fight to the death and one survive multiple times a day, it’s an extra game mode you knob jockey, it’s not meant to adhere to other game logic and loops lol it’s for building and nothing but building. Untwist those nickers mate!
---
You must be fun at parties!
---
If you go in the vault and listen to the holotapes it explains it very well actually. Have you played nuclear winter? Lol
---
The truth is it was rigged from the start
---
Great.. add me and let's do this!
---
Vinegar!? 
---
How dare you!
---
Again... you are describing Minecraft. Just play that
---
Server wide cooldown like the other poster said. Plus when I was farming milk for Faschnacht donuts it seemed like I could only milk them once a day. Doesn't help there's only two guaranteed spawns for them besides the ones at other players camps
---
Yup, X A Y and B
---
&gt;Just because someone doesn't play the game the same way you do doesn't mean they are a dick.
---
Well in this case they are definitely a dick. If you have fun ruining everyone elses fun you are a douchebag, plain and simple.
---
I hear you lol
---
I just moved my camp yesterday near Pleasant valley station cause i needed some concrete and i usually use that node near the station from time to time (i love the location too) but i forgot the meat event...after 5 minutes lots of Yao Guai swarmed my camp spawn killing me lol (no players was doing the mission so monsters were free to roam toward me), it reminded me the glorious day in Battlefield...but since that i managed to set up my usual 10 missile turret configuration i was able to repel them until some players showed up :D
---
At least i have chick...ehm yao guai to eat :)
---
So it explains how an entire vault dies and literally seconds later it’s full of the next batch to kill and repeat and repeat? Lol from a lore standpoint I understand that it only happened once and it was a fight to the death we can all watch an oxhorn video, but if you want to be all semantically correct about game modes “fitting in” then you’ve screwed yourself there mate
---
TBH Better off with Junkies 50% damage VS. 45% and you don't need 9 shots to get the multiplier.
---
well, seems you have to get used to it, as i don't plan to leave anytime soon...i'm on amission, fight the evil darkness sitting on BGS hq scamming ppl^^
---
Okay again, by that logic go play gears of war and your event idea can get fucked ? Doi
---
Who is oxhorn? I don’t watch youtubers.
---
^^
---
Biggest face palm
---
I try and think for myself...
---
for every single person that i safe it's worth\^\^
---
There are countless frustrating bugs to be found in F76.  
---
There is also ton of fun, unique gameplay and colorful world to be found in F76.  
---
Definitely not a game suited for everyone's taste. A niche hobby, if you may. Still, I've spent money on much more polished and ultimately much more boring games...
---
Ha thanks. Something i always knew just never had a name for it. Always learning something new everyday on the internet.  Is it worth while information probably not but learning something new none the less.
---
Fair enough ;)
---
That, to me, looks really really worth the price
---
Check your dms you silly cunt
---
Save or put in a safe?
---
Im guessing after the new year. 
---
Low expectations = little disappointment
---
Gears has a mode where you build defensive structures with a 24 person server to fight an enemy attack? I’ve never played.
---
I think 391 is the weapon's base.  3,700 damage is required for a 1 shot kill.
---
retten, if you understand this one better.
---
Yes exactly that but 5 people instead of 24 haha
---
hahaha^^
---
Watched one episode yesterday and I really enjoyed it...
---
Well I guess I really should stay off of reddit.
---
Yeah built my base on the golf course near whitespring. Opened my map and noticed my vendor wasnt operational. Fast jumped there and two high level players aggroed every high level friendly robot in the area, hid at the top of my base, and let the robots destroy it. I quickly logged servers but half my base was gone.
---
I agree with you, it’s probably best we wait. If anyone else comes to mind in the meantime then I’ll shoot you a message.
---
Aaaah the good ol'   5318008
---
it's nice to see people collecting novelty stuff :)
---
Im fine with 3 star enemies dropping 1 star gear.
---
Mmmpphh or whatever her name is has guaranteed 3 star drops.
---
i ever played fallout and i know...but this is the first where they sell pa paints worth the money of a full dlc, while not put in even a minimum of effort on the other hand to fix the game...therefor i just feel i have to show ppl what a bunch of scammers and greedy ferks our beloved BGS has turned into...easily having replaced EA on it. as their games are at least playable.
---
Great video, I've been looking at doing something like this.
---
Your nukesdragons levelling roadmap doesn't start until lvl 15. What should the special point distribution be up to then?
---
lost....
---
but no fo game before sold you a single pa paint for a price worth a full dlc, while on the other hand they do shit to fix the game ,)
---
I've also been playing hard since beta, my first character is ~200, my current is ~370. If I did care for xp after lvl 60 it would be easy to reach 800 imo...
---
&gt;I power levelled my husband 
---
Context.
---
Yeah, that's where my previous camp was. Got throttled several times during the previous meat week.
---
If the man enjoys the game and he plays it a lot aint no shame in that theres people higher level than him and on other games like League or overwatch people spend way more time than I thought be possible.
---
As in how? The how was mostly slapping him in a hazmat suit and taking him into nuke zones, letting him tag all the glowing ones, then I or a friend would finish them. Mind you, a lot of this was when we got 700xp off of a glowing one.
---
They could just add Enclave or Bos remnant factions that wil eventually cease to exist because of declining numbers and an inability to contact other parts of the factions.
---
For early lvls i will recommend focusing on strength as melee weapons are very effective early on, or push intelligence for more exp and faster grind.
---
He posts it every couple weeks
---
It's pretty thought-out hardhitting PvE build. First I was gonna comment on your perks, as folks usually do, but if it works for you... Also I haven't seen anyone using Excavator with Emergency Protocols, haha, but why not.
---
The why is that I wanted him to play with me and he couldn't survive some of the areas I went if we got separated. Also, he wanted powerful guns like mine.
---
Well seeing as DLC is free... yea
---
JFC go play MHW or ESO you damn crybaby
---
No other Fallout game allowed you to earn full DLCs in game. Wait how do I earn creation club points in FO4? What do you mean I can't?? I can't play Far Harbor by shooting ten thousand raiders with different guns???
---
Was it on PS4? If so you may have just met the "Doc" CJ Martin. He role plays, he's got a doctors office and pharmacy in Flatwoods. He's also got quite a few people who work for/with him. For instance, one guy spends 8 hours a day killing tics. It's a lot better to watch a YouTube video about than for me to try and tell you.
---
With emergency protocols you are basically immortal, you can be slightly more immortal with better pa but it makes no difference 😅
---
How is level 159 any different to level 50? Once you have the special points maxed, you don’t get any better stats do you? (That’s a question, an assumption I made..)
---
"Context" is a non gender specific version of "That's what she said...."
---
right now it's BL3, i'm good, no worries ,)
---
so you watched the clips i put on main post? so what you say now? a lil annoyance? hahaha\^\^ the denial is strong with you\^\^
---
what is this full dlc you talk about hahahaha^^ pls tell me, still waiting for it hahaha^^
---
Yeah, I get it. I'm running full health PA heavy gunner, for PvP mostly, so quite a few of my perks are different, but still have Protocols on torso (and Jet Packs on arms), as it's really good and serendipity unfortunately doesn't proc in PA.
---
Find somewhere easy to farm for junk near a train station sell to vendor get ur 1400 caps a day 
---
Could do morgantown high school tons of plastic you can sell to players low lv enemies and other junk you can sell to vendors
---
Imo this is the most they have ever done to fix a game. The only other time I can think of Bethesda actually CHANGING a game as much as this one was in Skyrim VR where they finally gave players hands. Man that took that game to the next level
---
Your special is maxed but you still get new perk cards. And with certain cards being more necessary than others, it can take more than 50 levels to get the right build. Also, he didn't know what build he wanted. First he tried a shotgun build like mine, then went melee, then to a 10mm. Now he is a weird mix of all 3. It is his first fallout build. 
---
I get it now. However, context can also be used to request more details as to the setting in a specific comment and/or question. That is how I took it. Lol.
---
What changes would you make to the perks?
---
Is it though? Are we playing the same game? Do you consider Fallout 76 balanced?
---
That last bit there about it not being inserted explains alot
---
I actually would love if there was one event that took prewar money... and A LOT of it
---
Sorry, most people don't enjoy FPSs with auto aim and weapons that only need to be aimed at the ground to be effective. I don't need my hand held, i prefer a challenge. Sorry you and others spent real world money to feel superior in a virtual world.
---
Yeah, I'm not disputing those business practices. It's an unfortunate GaaS trend nowadays - just look at Ghost Recon Breakpoint...  
---
With that said and all those bugs acknowledged, I still find plenty of fun in wastalend. But game as a whole is definitely suited for a very small subset of players, no doubt about that.
---
whicxh dlc? you are joking, right? hahaha^^ dude, what you call dlc's, i call small events not worth more than a dollar lmao^^ for 2 pa pints you get a whole season pass on other games...dlc*'s sized far harbor + nuka cola or any witcher dlc with playtime 10-15 hours^^ what you call dlc, i call small events that every pathetic game adds truly for free^^ every MHW free dlc is 100x the size of all the fo76 "free dlc's" stacked lol
---
I'm not saying you can earn DLC, the point is you have always had to pay for it. You don't have to pay for the atom shop skins. You could grind atoms like the rest of us day one players. You can't grind anything for a DLC except a JOB
---
Lol. Yeah, I was taking it in the literary context. But I applaud the concept. Next time, i will get it.
---
Yeahh milk is my bottleneck, I wanna sell stacks of a dozen donuts a pop but at this rate it's just not really desirable anymore
---
It's difficult to say, but I'd say this:
---
\- Jester/goblin fashnacht masks (on consoles, I don't think anyone on PC has them)
---
\- Winter man fashnacht mask (obtainable on both platforms)
---
\- Hunter's hood+Hunters pelt (possible to have on PC only, due to dev room leak)
---
\- Red asylum outfit
---
\- all event reward outfits - I'd say they're equally easy/difficult to get, because it only depends of event frequency farming possibilities and luck (not game Luck, real life luck). I dropped myself almost all possible event outfit except Western without the chaps and Fireman helmet, but I played more than 1800 hours...
---
what dlc's you talk about??? so far all i've seen was pathetic small events no one did bother to play after just a day lol
---
Sheepsquatch questline is bigger than workshop DLC. I never claimed they have stuff bigger than far harbor. If you add in other quests added and addition things such as trading, seasonal advents etc, it actually amounts to a pretty substantial add over the past 9 or so months.
---
you compare it to workshop dlc? hahahahaha
---
dude, ONE SINGLE PA PAINT IS $18!!! O N E !!!! now go and do the math and check the gaming world...
---
unbefuckinglievable^^
---
If you’re based in the Forest, some good XP and chances for legendary gear come from the Leader of the Pack event near the Tyler County Fairgrounds, which themselves have a nice bumper crop of Scorched you can farm, then sell the weapons they drop at train station vendors.
---
A great and relatively safe place to level up until you feel ready to push into more aggressive areas of the map where there’s higher risks and rewards.
---
I agree completely. While I don't personally think it would be ideal for it to be a backpack mod, a jetpack that takes up the same slot would be fitting. But I was taking OP's point more to mean they should add jetpacks outside of power armor.
---
My pleasure. I have even had to sticky this warning on my combat mods to avoid the bitching and moaning:
---
"***lets be super clear that if you want a predictable player never dies RPG storybook experience, don't use this UNCERTAINTY, FEAR and EXCITEMENT combat mod***. "
---
Then what would everyone do?
---
I'm talking about other Fallout DLCs. You couldn't earn those in game. So it's not right to compare the skins to the DLC. If it was possible to play Broken Steel or Far Harbor without paying money that would be cool. How are you getting in game currency for those?
---
It’s completely optional... and it’s 1200-1800 atoms. Not $. 
---
You don’t need to buy power armor paints. They are there for people who want them. All actual content is free. Why complain about something you don’t even need? I hve zero desire to buy a power armor skin lol. Why exactly should I be outraged if someone else wants to waste their money and play dress up? I just enjoy the free content added regularly. Big drop coming in another couple months... for free.
---
Grind to complete their character just as they do anyway, but with ability to see how far next reward is, to anticipate this reward, and to happily participate in continous positive feedback loop
---
I try that but as soon as that beam hits, I’m gone.  I’ve got a couple of recall cards. I’m willing to give it a try again if you’ll let me know when you are on.
---
Get Bloodied... you'll never go back....
---
what a pathetic liar you are\^\^ you have to be the only person in the universe hahahahahahaha LMAO!°
---
Nice build. I run Bear Hands in Strength instead of Bandolier though. I recommend it for saving on weight as maxed out it makes your heavy weapons weigh 90% less, so you're talking 1 or 2 pounds per gun. It's a bigger weight saving than 90% off ammo I think.
---
Here's the one I'm toying with at the moment, still tweaking at a bit though... 
---

Your YouTube channel sucks.
---
After discovering there are only two static spawns for Brahmin and one static spawn for frogs, I realized pretty quickly it wasn't going to be viable to make them all the time. So after player vending released I just put them in display cases at my Slocum's Joe. I have a dozen sitting out in the counter like at a donut shop lol
---
How in the fuck have you played 1800 hrs, I’ve only played 500 and I play everyday
---
Mods for Ultracite and all T series Armor are available from the BoS vendor in WS.
---
Raider mods : the raider vendor in WS.
---
Excavator mods : ... free states, I think... vendor in WS
---
X01 mods : production terminal in the WS bunker.
---
Cited vendors do not have all the mods all the time - you may have to revisit .
---
I should be on around 1600 EDT. Sound ok?
---
You must be some sorta cactus cuz damn your a prick
---
If you're on PC, it's pretty easy to make a mod that silences mole rat death sounds. I would make one but I'm really busy with life right now.
---
This isn't fortnite
---
Well, for what it is intended to do (raiding, doing massive dmg in low health), it's pretty much sorted out.  
---
I would maybe drop Batteries included (and carry less fusion cores), put those points in CHAR and swap Tenderizer (doesn't work) for either Lone Wanderer when in solo or Strange in Numbers/Suppresor/Squad Maneuvers in raid... Also 4 points in CHAR mean full Hard Bargain + Travel Agent, which makes/saves A LOT of caps when filling the daily cap limit and travelling around vendors. But that's just a suggestion.
---
I play almost everyday from December, usually 4-5 hours, sometimes more in the weekend. I know, it's too much time in the game, but I like it ;)
---
Thanks wasn’t aware of that! This also isn’t pub g but here we are with a battle Royale mode, cheers
---
Thanks. You're talking about mods, right? Not armor plans? If so - awesome!
---
That’s mainly depends how much ammo you have, when I farm ammo it’s like 100k rounds and that’s a lot of weight plus normally i carry only up to 3 guns, i was loaded with multiple guns only to showcase my build ;)
---
I play heavy gunner, but I have slightly different setup - for me revenant and aqua boy is too situational, life giver meaningless for amount of points it uses. I prefer Lone wanderer instead and some point to agility for Action boy and Gun Fu (I love gun fu with Gatling Gun). But whatever suits you better...
---
I'm sorry but I went to both of those places recently and they dont
---
Will do my dude.
---
Totally agree PvP is different story, maybe i will do pvp guides if Westlanders will bring some pvp mode apart from workshops pvp that we have now.
---
887 or 1000 is just crazy, I mean hell 300+  is doing something. I am on much more than I should be since beta and I am just now 167 with my main and 118 with my alt....
---
am i? what are you then?^^
---
Well I did want something in the shop that's eye catching as a nice breather so a teddy collection was a good choice for me :)
---
Eh im level 2 so im just gonna ignore this post
---
nothing i worry about^^ i know that it contains too much truth to handle for sheep and lemmings^^
---
1 atom = $1
---
Life giver is there for (adrenal reaction + bonus hp + emergency protocols) immortality combo (life giver provides reliable and significant bonus hp, only your highest bonus count, theoretically rejuvenated is better but losing well fed bonus usually result in death)
---
\^\^\^\^\^\^ ---- THIS......We are all running around looking like carbon copies of each other because we never get any love. None of my weapons would ever look rusty and broken so how about some skins fitting a general in the Enclave please and not for a pickaxe!
---
its not a mod its a completely seperate weapon type so there is no way to change an ultracite weapon to a non ultracite version
---
I'm on PC. I don't have my list in front of me but I think I'm after the Targetting HUD, Kinetic servos, Optimized bracers and I think Emergency Protocols.
---
Any help is much appreciated. I am currying an X-01 jet pack mod kit and one other.
---
shows just ingame bugs, the game being broken as fuck and yet you are salty over it hahaha\^\^ lmao\^\^
---
care to elaborate?
---
Hopefuly some kind of faction wars with normalized dmg/res; less reliant on gear and more on tactics and skill. A man can dream.
---
great..I can try.. Add me as each time I start up I always check for friend requests.
---
So if you're immortal why use revenant? You let yourself kill everytime before more serious fights? Impractical for me...
---
killed a few hundred last night and finished all of my tasks above as well :)
---
Sorry, should have been clear -  plans for the mod, not the mod itself.  I'll edit the post.
---
I have every PA except Raider, and have paid the specified vendors price for the plans to put targeting hud, optimized bracers, motion assist servos, and calibrated shocks on each type.
---
Stop trying to milk the bulls.
---
Ok. Do you have the codes for this week? Thanks
---
And once you build your character?
---
Yes that's a fair point. I go the other way, I carry 7 guns in total with 1k-2k bullets for each. Two of my guns are energy-based though, so Bandolier isn't massively effective on my build. I tend to craft less ammo in one go, but more often. Usually do a loot run or legendary farm for a bit, then pop back to camp and switch to my crafting perks to make more ammo and do repairs, then switch back to the main build and head out again.
---
Oh yes, that's fine. I've done the same for many PA parts too. I'm currently trying to downsize my PA collection and take my Ultracite PA out of mothballs. I have a kickass T-60 and T-51 set soon for sale.
---
I'll check out the WS BOS vendor tomorrow- thanks!
---
Dam dude,you beat me to the comment.i was going to say maybe your Brahmin is a dude.
---
My ego won't allow me to be killed by an aimbotting (VATS) stealthboy tesla rifle spammer. Come fight me in NW!
---
1st vid Server delay caused the mob to spawn late
---
2nd vid You jumped off a bus with Marsupial which is high enough to cause fall damage and Server delay caused the damage to proc late
---
3rd vid That's an odd visual bug? But it doesn't seem to effect gameplay.
---
4th vid you were killed by the explosion again server delay caused the damage to proc late
---
5th vid Dissapearing bodies. Not sure what causes tgis it's annoying AF sometimes they come back when you wait a little while (may also be server related??)
---
6th vid the grenade clipped the bodies through the wall. Yeah this needs a fix it could be a server issue IDK but the bodies "should" be back when they turn into meat piles.
---
7th vid same as first mob spawned late because of server lag
---
8th vid I've seen the extra scavanger bots hanging around after a player logs out. I suspect this player was logging out and back into the same world multiple times.
---
9th vid It sucks they reintroduced the damn floor ghouls. Please fix.
---
Most of the issues you see are from server delay. The Collectron is new to the collectron and not game breaking. 
---
Basically if they fix the server issues almost every problem you've encountered will go away. The servers do need some serious work.
---
So yeah mostly server issues with the exception of your overly dramatic emotes but they can't fix that.
---
Not salty. I just think it's sad you have to post 10 or more videos to artificially drive views to your channel. It's smells of desperation.
---
I watched them. I said the Grafton Mayor example was just a little annoyance, not every possible bug in the game. I'm not in denial, I was just telling you it wasn't a good example. Those insta-deaths are better examples, you should have used those to begin with. 
---
And I'm curious, regular PS4 or PS4 Pro?
---
Got my vote mate
---
Point taken.
---
I've only used cloaking against CPU generated enemies, not PvP - real person reaction may be different.
---
Y’all count me in please. I’ll try those buffs. I’m good at hitting the robots. Terrible at hitting the squatch.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
Do you have a nukesdragons build?
---
Is that still in the game. I went there recently and the trap wasn't armed.
---
You don’t need it, there are other perks like fire proof or chemfiend, but i like revenant you can really boost your dmg for sbq fight and save ammo, plus all you need to do is exit pa and shot ground with rocket launcher or grenade launcher then enter pa again.
---
90% reduced weight is a legendary modifier. Otherwise, heavy guns can have weight reduced by using the Bear Arms perk.
---
What do you mean by Marketplace? Atomic Shop?
---
Sounds _very much_ like those who infringe on  @mendment #2.
---
It's the perks, chems, and the mods on the guns.
---
Legendary effects such as bloodied, mutants, junkies, can all increase the damage.
---
Legendary effect weightless, will reduces the weigh by 90% before mods are added. Mods are not effected by reduced weight.
---
There's also perks that effect the damage and weight yes. What your seeing in a screenshot, is what all that person is capable of getting from that gear. Might be different for you.
---
All these down votes, heck maybe it's just my account is bugged out and it's fine for everyone else...
---
I opened  windows security and disabled the private network in the "firewall and protection" tab.
---
BoS vendor in WS = Robot vendor at WS Trainstation?
---
Market reddit probably.
---
Where do you even get Ultracite Lasers?
---
That would be brilliant! I've always wanted to use pre war money for something.
---
YES, make .44's hand cannons again!!
---
I’ve got 2 recall cards on PS4. I’m dixiemomma1577. Add me and I’m game to give it a go with you all!
---
That would prevent NPC's from attacking your base I believe?

Sad but proud face

Dixie. I think we already are friends loool. My psn is my name on here.
---
Unfortunately yes, my main is level 338 and I currently have Gunsmith level 5, 4, 3, 2, &amp; 6 level 1s.
---
Perk packs are Random so my main has a total of 9 Super Dupers, but my level 42 hasn't gotten any yet.
---
It's my setup for usual runs, for SBQ I change Glowing in PER for Refractor and Good Doggy for 2\* fireproof.

&gt;1 atom = $1
---
Your math is bad. I have 1100 Atoms saved from farming them. I've earned thousands of Atoms for free. 
---
1500 Atoms is $10 with some free bonus apparel. Even if you buy them 1 atom costs less than 1 cent.
---
Everyone play in a bit different way and I love it, there is no build that is the best. My point was to showcase how powerful and fun heavy gunner build is, but after all most important is to have fun and for me testing guns, builds and hidden mechanics in game and then sharing with community is fun 😀
---
I just want it where you spawn into the 16v16 and have 30 sec to 1 min to build a base, then it starts. Easy and unique. And massively increase wall hp for this too.
---
Collect all the scrap you find. I mean everything. Scrap for whatever material you need and sell everything else to vendors (train stations or whitesprings). 
---
The Hard Bargain perk helps you get better prices when buying/selling.  Grape Mentats help as well.
---
Let me remind you back in context:
---
Right now it is possible to grind the Strangler Power Armor set within a month, and every other armor is second-tier if you compare it to Strangler Powrr Armor.
---
The concern of yours is already part of the game, my proposition doesn't make it worse.
---
I actually "finished" my character in June, and have been unable to upgrade it any further up until recently, when the change in the landscape of threats made me readjust the focus. When I rebuilt my character recently, I didn't obtain new items to do so - I used what I kept stashed for months. Oh, and after completing my main character in June, I have since completed and perfected four others, meaning I have 5 perfected combat characters now. I'm literally talking about this from a perspective of somebody who doesn't need this personally because of the perfected gear they have, as well as access to stash I started that is now managed by multiple people and that could allow me to equip few dozen characters. 
---
Do you know what I did with the overabundance of items I have? Built an organisation and equipped multiple people, so now I can explore the wasteland with multiple teams.
---
As the game progresses and changes, there will always be new rooms for improvement, new people to help, new goals to define, new strategies to experiment with.
---
My suggestion doesn't reduce the amount of things to do. My suggestion increases it by allowing noncombat, community/crafting focused playstyle to be even partially as profitable as the superoptimised multiperson coordinated grind I'm doing now.
---
Yes, we are!
---
No, they fixed that glitch months ago.
---
But then again, you know all the high levels that would just buy them all?
---
you also need to be addicted to chems
---
Really? How do I cash in the 4000 atoms I’ve earned for $40?
---
Ahem, as per the laughable videos of how hilariously bad this person is at playing FO76 i would like to comment on each of the videos in descending order.
---
1: Not a bug, you're just bad at the game.
---
2: That's a VERY MINOR glitch that's already been addressed.
---
3: No glitches here
---
4: Still no glitches; died from explosions and rad.
---
5: You're logging in WAAAAY too fast man slow it down. 
---
6: Another minor glitch
---
7: YET ANOTHER GLITCH BETH HAS ALREADY ADDRESSED 
---
8: Scavenger  collectron is still very new so of course that going to have another minor visual glitch
---
9: Congrats a visual glitch. 
---
All of theses are NOT effecting gameplay. AT ALL. your just seeking attention for no reason. And i still stand by my first post, if you don't like it don't play it. Go play another game you do like. There are PLENTY of people here that do like the game. Go play your BL3 and bugger off.
---
Ah of course. That slipped my mind.
---
I don’t think so, it’d totally burn the player up.
---
Sweet. Well when I see you on, I'll let you know when I'm gonna pop one
---
If you cherry pick the right drugs you won't notice the negative effects.
---
While doing this event look for unyielding armour pieces then play with low hp to get high intelligence (it directly affects your exp gain)
---
Totally agree. One of the best things about the game is it's not just full of people running around in cookie cutter builds. There's such a wide scope for different playstyles and roles that you can literally spend hours just switching things around to see how it affects your build. I think it's one of the most underrated aspects of the game.
---
I'd say the brotherhood jumpsuit is more rare than the others because the mission is glitched out for some people.... like me :/
---
I kept dinking around trying to pick the "perfect build" and so never got above 30 for ages, while my husband just straight up played, so he's level 110.  I finally buckled down and used the double XP weekend to get myself up to level 62, can solo Whitesprings, solo scorchbeasts, finally got a full set of power armor.....and he's bored and won't play with me anymore, lol.
---
Yeah I always explained it away like that in my mind. But In fo4 200 years after the initial blast the contaminates would certainly have lost the majority of not most of their radioactivity.
---
It’s probably not your hardware, it’s just the game.  Because of the game engine it runs in and the server stability overall it will most likely just not run as well as other newer titles even with an insane PC like you have.
---
I have played more than enough hours with my wife to be that level If played different.  Right now I'm 275.
---
If I slept ever hour and ate cranberry relish, an did nothing except events, dailies, and running through the three main experience areas; whitesprings, West tech, and the burrows.
---
No, it's not - BoS jumpsuit is rewarded for many Savage Divide events and dailies and you get it in bundle with WhiteSpring Jumpsuit, White Powder Jumpsuit, Mechanic Jumpsuit and since last patch with both Scout Masks.
---
I get it for Guided Meditation, others form Uranium Fever and there are some other that has those in reward pool.
---
Berserkers Junkies works quite well for me.
---
Get fireproof in endurance for scorch beasts :) their great weapons become so weak you can stand around until they land or move into your range!
---
Just a heads up if you kill the waves of bees.  Check your junk for royal jelly . They've been dropping them pretty rare but at least 3 times a session for me ...  I've accidently scrapped twice but even if u dont need the jelly for possum badge, I bet they sell for a pretty good amount.
---
I get that. Eh, I'll just keep playing and see if my luck changes. It's still annoying though.
---
Seriously I want to at least one shot head shot super mutants without need of a legendary rifle, while sneaking
---
NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE.As a former heavy gunner now one shotting everything smaller than a behemoth with an instigating hunting rifle and only 4 points in perception, I am absolutely disgusted by the damage output.  2.4k dmg headshots?  How is that weak?  I would have way more damage if i was a rifleman build too.  My one star gauss rifle does 1000 damage per hit to the SBQ.  And this is just the non-automatic rifles we are talking about.  I cant even imagine what my damage output would be if i had 15 perception and a 3 star fixer. All rifles are crazy op.  If you aren't finding success with them, you are using them wrong or misunderstand how damage is calculated.The hunting rifle in particular will never run out of ammo as ultracite .308 can be crafted in mass at little cost.  It's exceptionally accurate and stealthy and grants just high enough damage to one shot super muties without adrenaline.  For an early game weapon that scales so well into late game, you cant ask for more without making all other rifle options obsolete.  If you need faster fire rate and reload, you get a different gun.  Every gun has a weakness the hunting rifle gets exceptional vats accuracy at the cost of fire rate.  Things like the handmade have accuracy penalties in comparison.  The fixer is sort of the exception, its only downside being difficult to acquire.If rifles are buffed they will become far superior to all other weapons.  In my opinion, they already are, and steatlh bonuses need massive nerfs.  Crouching shouldn't quadruple my damage but it does.I tried making shotguns viable using sneak attack headshots and that was miserable.  They could use a big buff.  My suggestion would be introducing receivers/barrel mod options like a slug or fletchette receiver that grants armor pen at the expense of as many projectiles.
---
It does indeed happen, but (thus far), those idiots are easy enough to avoid if you don't want to engage them.  Block via XB Live (don't just block for session), then server hop.  Make sure to block their whole team.
---
I seen a level 1,023 at west tek the other day. Took a screen shot I couldn’t believe my eyes lol
---
To be honest...if you just xp grind and don’t do anything else you could easily do 2 levels per hour.  Although now events are timed probably not.
---
Exposes an "inadequacy" of what, exactly? Elaborate, please.
---
People have already given you their reasons, and yet you still feel the need to give your armchair  psychoanalysis of the player base, as though you were Freud? At least Freud would give an in-depth analysis for his observations, whereas you merely state personal  opinion.
---
Once the door is opened it could benefit everyone though... they would have to be careful choosing what objects were in boxes and what were just loose and there to pick up. 
---
I am not a super low level person but I would hate for something where newer players can’t come along for the ride. 
---
Part of what makes meat week awesome is how everyone can be a big part of it and get rewarded.  More events with that level of openness would be good.
---
Do you have any extra troubleshooters armor?  It’s hard to come across. Thanks
---
i can never be as bad as you with your pathetic attempt to distort truth hahahaha
---
magic^^
---
Or maybe the OP and others having issues, ideas or just general comments could start saying what system their on since this is left out 90% of the time... jus sayin’
---
in my country it goes 1:1
---
ps4
---
yes that's right because reddit is just opinions, not paid consultancy.
---
Ok thanks alot . That really explains it.
---
Bloody Mess and all perks will up the damage a lot. There's also chems/food which will increase the damage Psychobuff for example adds 25% damage. Bobbleheads add damage increase as well.
---
Ignore and block, they’ll get bored...
---
and you have to maintain an addiction, furious is set it and forget it
---
Mutations no longer trigger PvP. I have personally tested this many times. I was fixed a while back.
---
Could you elaborate why they're useful?  
---
Haven't really done a ton of cooking besides some basic soups (corn/carrot) for my stealth rifleman build, curious to know what else I should be doing.
---
Yep, i got all of them from the Bots On Parade event
---
Addictions do not go away. They fixed that it's now set and forget.
---
for my channel? hahaha^^ i never plan to run a professional channel, as it's obvious as how amateur like the channel is lol^^ was just the best way to share clips i record with ps4 share...no stream or anything^^
---
however, feel free to add whatever nonsense you feel like....at the end, all the things important is on the clips ,) no matter how hard you try to deny ,)
---
And i don't think I'll ever understand why your seeking so much attention of such minuscule problems that are mostly your doing.
---
Where are you from?
---
Some people use it as a selling point of pictures.
---
They either go full on low health or get addicted to loads of chems or even perk cards (all depends on the legendary effects) so they can get super high damage even if it's only for a few seconds just to get a pic. Sometimes it's not realistic damage for general gameplay. But people will buy it because it has a chance to get that high. An example would have been the time I sold my junkies melee weapon. I got addicted to 5 chems, used all perk cards to get high damage (including temporary damage like adrenaline) took a few more chems drank booze and did a few more things. I managed to get a few thousand damage at its max lasted about 30 seconds or so. But in reality it only had about several hundred damage on average.
---
Travelers leather coat ( not hunters) with back pack and green hood.
---
Quest rewards, crafting, legendary drops.
---
i had it yesterday after 1200h of play, i have all the vendor plans so it's very rare, still waiting for the plasma grenade plan...
---
try harder^^
---
seems all the other game companies have magicians employees, as i can't think of ANY other game that has a million bugs too hahahaha^^
---
dude, pls...lame as fuck if you ask me...but you dont need to, just whatch the clips, show pretty much about what the ferk of a game we are talking about here^^ or...keep going full denial^^
---
Thats fine in comparison to the sound bug with the sentry bots....
---
Cool thanks for your input. I actually made the plunge into a bloodied junkie build. I like it. I got an awesome junkie .50 cal. shortly after. It’s been fun. I’m level 359 on that build and it’s definitely got me into aspects of the game I hadn’t tried. I’m crafting booze and experimenting a bunch. A message to all. If you’re bored with the game like I hear people saying. Starting drinking and using chems like rose told you.
---
I always considered the railway rifle to be a heavy gun for some reason?
---
p.s. btw, i don't have any collectrons on my camp, never bought it^^ so, it seems magic they found their way into my camp hahaha^^
---
Ultracite laser and laser weapons ate separate weapons so it's not a mod. 
---
You will have to find a different gun if you don't want the ultracite version.
---
They know the reasons already. They're not really interested in knowing why, more than they are in having a venue where they can tell you those reasons are irrational, at least according to their own plumb line.
---
I've had a similar issue but it's about once every 4 hours of play, not really consistent. also run into a few flat out invisible enemies here and there, I'm paranoid when I take random damage as to what it actually is.
---
That's where a middle finger emote comes handy...
---
Now that's some heavy grindy role play, killing ticks for 8 hours. Wow.
---
Wow. Bitter much? This is exactly why I made the post. Way too many people are angry all the time. I was pointing out that they did what they could to make things right. There never was an attempt to "Scam" me
---
you still have to maintain, as in when a chem wears off you get withdrawl symptoms, and even ignoring that I just looked it up and literally every chem reduces several special points, I don't feel like taking that hit.  I'll stick to my furious vanguard tank thank you very much
---
I didn't think you could trigger PvP in events anyways. Or am I mistaken? 🤔
---
It would absolutely help if folks would state their platform in the post. Doesn't change the fact that it really takes less time to find one's platform in history than it takes typing and asking for it.
---
I dont know what makes me more excited. the new Human NPCs or the new weapons and gear
---
p.p.s. none affecting gameplay,nooooooo hahaha^^ congrats, you are no sheep or lemming, you are just stupid^^ it's all okay, these aren't gamebreaking bugs bethesda, no need to fix them although in game since beta, one year ago hahaha^^ we find workarounds for you, save your time and money....can we have more atom-shop items please? hahaha you are so laughable hahaha dude, to fix issues in a game is common in gaming industry ,) to not do so in a year, is absolutely not, you moron^^
---
In that case he's just looking for somebody he can attack. He killed me and my team mate who was turning the spit at the time. I was putting wood into the wood pile and my mutation triggered when he hit me with his buzz blade, which i assume started the pvp, so he killed me and got lucky killing a team mate who was covered by my pvp start up.
---
I saw a level 700 the other day I’m only level 250 and been playing since launch
---
I have a few friends that "power leveled" from new to 50+ doing ONLY meat week. Sounds to me like it went pretty well for them.
---
Wouldn't it be better to not beg them for more usage of microtransactions?
---
Geez, several hundred damage is still a lot. Thanks a lot for the insight, and giving out the info on a trade secret. I probably would have been very pissed off had id been duped out of 8 or 10 thousand caps on something. I didn't really no you can double up on chems like that,which will help the next time I'm getting my a"$ kicked. Thanks again
---
Not afraid, just annoyed by people bouncing around trying to instigate PvP that are angry that others are ignoring them...
---
p.p.p.p.s i'm logging in wayyyyy too fast 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
OMG^^ that made my day hahaha^^ nxt time i need to make sure i load in slower hahahaha^^ i give my best, i promise hahaha pls tell beth i'll try hahaha
---
can't fucking believe it hahahaha
---
Both. Damage is relative to user. So if it is bloodied and that person has low health, it will show high damage. Will also be impacted by chems, mutations, etc
---
Yeah I’ve seen it before but not since last July actually
---
yes, i've already noticed the lack of survival, and i've never played it, just logged today and hopped to someone's camp to check the store, of course got welcomed by the host attempting to trigger pvp with a chainsaw, ignored and returned to my base, the said guy chased me till home and started to throw granades attempting to break my base i suppose? i was in pacifist mode so don't think he was able to break anything.
---
If it is today nothing would lead be to believe it would not be like any of their other updates that are usually scheduled at approximately 10am US EST.  Check fallout Twitter and see, if any mention or Bethesda status update section.
---
Did you uninstall it? If you did let it go and move on...
---
No, not the train station.
---
All the faction bot vendors (except X01, which is in the bunker) are Inside the resort building.
---
IIRC, the BoS vendor is the hunting/weapons shop.
---
I think that the criticism is justified and while they may not purposely targeted a scam at you, the game is very buggy and they don't even test the stuff the they sell in the atom shop, They are negligent.
---
Good for you if you have the bar so low.
---
At that level you don’t even need alt character to try out other builds.
---
I guess I need to find out what kind of build I have
---
thank you, i was just curious cause i was looking at their site and saw today til the 7th that this is going on
---
Nukacrypt always has been right on top of things...!
---
germany ,) now go check

Yup, it’s the game. I have a 2080 paired with a 9700K and 32GB of ram, still pretty poor performance. Frame rate is actually capped at 72fps which I changed to unlimited in the ini. file then used rivatuner to cap it at 144fps. I also run the medium graphics preset and only changed the textures to ultra which helps a lot. My fps ranges 144 to 58 in some areas. The game also freezes sometimes cause me to do a hard restart of my rig, happened 3 times within 12 hours yesterday. So yes the game is optimized like crap and no it’s not your pc.
---
no, i feel pretty fine here^^ and still have a lot of work to do^^
---
Anytime,  have a good one
---
Those collectron are from other players trying to login but I guess you chose a really popular spot. Beth is already aware of this happening.
---
me seeking attention? then it seems i'm very successful considering the millions of downvotes hahaha^^
---
i seek something else...and i can understand bethesda doesnt like it ,)
---
good news, i never give up ,)
---
you too, best of luck also to getting god rolls!
---
Private servers will be coming out in 2020.
---
I do believe they will still support the game for more than 2 years. and the reason why is because they have dedicated Bethesda Austin to handle 76. This allows for Bethesda Maryland (Todd's Bethesda) to work on the new main games. This game is no Anthem and Bethesda is no EA. They don't seem like the kind of people to just cut support for a game that didn't do to well. Remember that ESO also had an awful launch and was very lack lustered yet they are still adding more content. 
---
The more content, features, and bugs they fix, the more likely people will pick up the game later down the road and more likely to spend more money on the game. This is why the atomic shop is constantly updated, to give people something to buy and "add" to their game.
---
Fingers crossed
---
&gt;seems all the other game companies have magicians employees, as i can't think of ANY other game that has a million bugs too hahahaha^
---
Really? How about FO3, FONV, FO4, Elder Scrolls.
---
Anthem, BL3 has a mega thread for bugs, pretty much any game released ever has had bugs. Yes, some companies are better than others at fixing them.
---
Bethesda has always had buggy games you knew this before you bought FO76. Yet you still complain. 
---
You are super active in the market sub so you're obviously still playing. If the bugs were that bad you wouldn't play. 
---
So why you still playing?
---
the instruments do sync
---
Yeah bud believe it or not its software. And software need to load before you start doing shit. Do you also watch TV without the tv being on? Or do you call up the company because the TV didn't turn on the millisecond you pressed the button? You're overloading your PS4.
---
&gt;Starting next Tuesday, October 1, Dwellers can kill Scorched throughout Appalachia to earn progress toward a new set of rewards. Take out 8,000,000 Scorched, and the community will unlock a **Legendary Sale Event from Purveyor Murmrgh from October 17 – 21**. Like the last challenge, there will be stretch goals along the way offering cosmetic rewards. Help kill enough Scorched to complete the final stretch goal before October 14 and the community will receive a massive buff for the Purveyor Sale, which will increase the discount on legendary weapons and armor to 50%!
---
&gt;As a bonus, the Purveyor is planning to host her first ever **Mystery Pick Event from October 3 – 7**. During this event, you can choose the limited-time “Mystery Pick” option at the Purveyor for a chance at a greatly reduced Scrip price on a purely random Legendary item.
---
i'm playing BL3 since release, NOT a SINGLE BUG EVER! here, most of the clips were recorded in one single day lol
---
dude, try harder ,)
---
This is what I'm using. I carry lots of chems and food/drinks and use melee often as it's a waste of cores to kill small stuff like wendigo or deathclaws and I only use power armor for stronger stuff such as bosses or high radiation areas.
---

---
Wow...so much hate here. I still have my Atoms and the 50 Cal Paint job. I got it for free and I am supposed to be angry and bitter like you? No thanks. I'll continue to enjoy my game. Have a good day
---
and why i still playing? do i? do i want? different answers...but what i can tell you is that i won't stop show ppl what a bunch of scammers bethesda is. like it or not
---
Berry Mentats (great for double XP weekends to maximize leveling) (also PvP)
---
and Sweet Labrador Tea, which then gets upgraded to Company Tea. It’s a total bitch to craft, but I’m pretty sure it’s the best AP Regen drink available. Plus it adds 20% disease resistance.
---
People bitch and cry about everything today damn...
---
I never found it confusing, but I wonder if the milking-failures need a notice to keep players from thinking it's a bug when it's an intended behavior.
---
that might be the most idiotic analogy i've ever heard, congrats, this needs a skill of its own hahaaa^^
---
lowes taxidery starts a line that yields 4.
---
Really dangit. I just spend like 500 scrip last night. i had 980   i didnt think anything started till the next wave of event was over so like the 17th.  oh well.  I guess this is sooner then i thought
---
&gt;I've had two survival mode rejects
---
why are non pvpers the most toxic?
---
the other day i was called a nikker (n-word) because i killed some dude at a workshop..
---
Didn’t spot anything when I just looked. Could you be more specific with the location? Which side is the rear of the dam?
---
I feel like that event was abandoned because people played the game a lot differently than what Bethesda thought. 
---
IIRC the event was supposed to be a massive free for all where people would have to compete against each other and time to get as many votes/ballets as soon as possible to become the president. This would have forced people to play against each other and only 1 person would have won. this is the opposite of what the player base became since people are helping each other and not really participating in PVP content or being complete assholes.
---
They have said themselves that people played the game a lot differently than expected. The event might come back around in 2020 (when US presidental elections happen, and God help us) but drastically altered to be more fitting to how the current player base is playing the game.
---
&gt;2nd vid You jumped off a bus with Marsupial which is high enough to cause fall damage and Server delay caused the damage to proc late
---
hahahahahaha omg, it gets better and better hahahaha\^\^ your laughable crap was worth this post hahaha
---
dude, if you TRULY believe that then i'm more worried about you rather then the game hahahaha
---
The best thing to do is stand there giving the "follow me" emote. 
---
Like, yea, you keep wasting all your ammo why I stand here and laugh at you.
---
The semi-auto receivers are boosted by **rifleman**, and the auto receivers work with **commando**. This was fixed a long time ago. 
---
It kicks like a mule, has a small clip, and no armor penetration, but the damage is fantastic. It's a VATS wonder-weapon.
---
I like to carry enormous amount of food on my unarmed melee character, I’m using good with salt there and have like 6 or more types of food for dmg bonuses. By the way nice build mate 👍
---
No kidding, dedication. Lol
---
you have to complete the excavator quest to get the PA station plan
---
You're using Euros? It 1 Atom is 1€ then a 1800 atom PA skin is basically $2000 USD. Yeah no way they're that expensive. 
---
Unless there is some other currency I'm unaware of? But Germany stopped using Deytsche Marks awhile ago.
---
“This weekend only, take a chance on a greatly reduced, but purely random 3-Star Legendary Item at The Purveyor!” yeah, ive been really itching to spend my scrip since yesterday wanting a better fixer roll (still love my fixer rn though just wish it was tse or bloodied) but i checked for anything going on and saw that
---
Cold hard facts friend. You're in denial.
---
XDD
---
Every BGS title has been buggy AF why would 76 be different? TBH 76 actually has less bugs than the majority of thier titles
---
Remember also that you cant milk the Brahmin at all during the Free Range Quest. They only become available for milking afterwards. I think it may have something to do with the flags during the quest on them?
---
Best way is to get one for your camp really :)
---
so similar to Line in the Sand but not completely shit and totally unrewarding?
---
I would love a Horde style game mode, where you can use the camp system to build your fortifications and you try to hold out as long as possible. This is semi what happens at the workshop, but the workshops only have about 3 waves and are very easy to defend against with just a vanilla weapon. If it was an Instanced event and you could choose where to defend, that would be amazing
---
fusion (and other) generator plans from power plants - Grahm also sells the fusion generator).  
---
AFAIK, the only way yo get the PA station plan is completing the Excavator quest.
---
Proyecting much? I  played  the game a lot and I enjoyed it, does mean there's not a lot of things  to  fix
---
On the Enclave wishlist:
---
MODUS Terminal
---
Enclave Flag
---
White springs scrapper bot (complete with tux paint)
---
Vertibrid landing pad
---
Enclave radio (with patriotic music)
---
Computer terminals (like those in high command)
---
Edit because mobile sucks
---
Shotguns, yes! They can still crank out some damage, but compared to how they were before they got nerfed, they're trash. And especially compared to a bloodied heavy build, they just don't have a high enough DPS now
---
500 atom = 5€ do the math
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Yet you ignore Anthem and every other Fallout game ever 👍
---
This is exactly what I want from the atomic shop, everything else is useless to me
---
Is that why you haven't given me a single peice of evidence? Cuz you think 6 people downvoting you is considered 'successful'? Hahahahahahaha
---
.01€ per atom so yeah Math
---
was wrong with 1 atom = 1 euro...see other response that makes it clear. it's 100 atoms for 1€, so still, 1800 atoms = 18€
---
It's the 'random item' sale, not the 25% or 50% off one.  That comes later (on the 17th if we meet the goal, which shouldn't be a problem).
---
Whatever I want 😂.
---
Rebuild camp. Run thru some places. Stock up. Take A Workshop. Do an event. Run a mission with a lvl 5. Lock 2 guys in a portapotty for stalking me. Really depends on if I’m tired and if I’m solo or not.
---
166 - shooter - shotgunner / handmade / stealth. Power armor
---
and I have a 110 melee bloodied build that does tons of DPS but the bloodied might be bad in there
---
I love my Instigating .50 cal hunting rifle. It one shots almost everything running as a sniper
---
I do zero maintenance the chem addictions are permament. If I want to negate the negative effects I have to take the chem but I don't need to.
---
hahaha^^ dude, if your crap would even be right, what's beyond ridiculous and laughable, do you want me to show you a pic of where i have birdbones active? lmfao^^
---
Power user is a waste of three perk cards unless you are primarily a Gatling laser user.  If not, and you don't use explosives either (most people don't), You only need 9 intelligence.  This free up 3 points so you can run lone wanderer.  Or more weight reduction for guys like me that have 500lbs of heavy weapons on them.  
---
But with a BE Gatling, I'd probably just get rid of all my others lol.  
---
I never though of self reviving to proc revenant though, that's awesome.  Makes me want more points in endurance.
---
That is my dream role. Congrats and I am totally jealous 
---
I am saving so much script for the 50% off Purveyor. So help me god, if I don't get an explosive LMG, Minigun, Gatling Gun, or any TSE heavy/rifle. I am going to hunt down those nuke codes and my first ever nuke is going to land right on top of that building.
---
Don't reference the word if you're to chicken shit to type it.
---
but the other games didnt sold you pa paints for (now look) 18€, but gave you full dlcs for that price....fo76 is the biggest scam in gaming history ever!
---
I feel like either the combat rifle or the LMG would have benefited from that skin a lot more. and both of them really needs skins
---
Two decimal places make a huge difference. Still a little more expensive than the US with the current exchange rate 1€=1.1 usd
---
Free Atoms negates a lot of the cost though.
---
if only it was blue tape :(
---
in the beginning i said $18, well, it's 18€, which is slightly the same...so dont nitpick on a typo ,) the point is still the same ,)
---
don't forget about what?
---
I love how all the people who never played survival think these griefers running around with Mr Handy blades came from survival.
---
You said 1 Atom =$1
---
will look tonight, completely forgot last night :)
---
anthem? wtf is a anthem? and however, so you name another broken game to defend the most broken game in gaming history? are you serious? lmfao^^
---
I got swamp itch from sleeping on the sleeping bag, woopsies is the only one I need to though
---
&gt;  I am absolutely disgusted by the damage output. 2.4k dmg headshots? How is that weak?
---
On creatures with a weakness in the head (creatures like Deathclaw's are weak in the stomach instead and head shots don't work on them) a well placed shot doubles damage...after instigating doubles damage... *after* sneak attack multiplier doubles damage. My 1* Instigating usually hits between 450-1000 but I've never hit 2.4k, I'd like to see that
---
We used to call them Marathon bars, no idea why they changed it to Snickers.
---
wait seriously? 
---
if this is true, holy hell. but I have yet to see people actually use a meat hook. they either run with a super sledge or a deathclaw gauntlet

Well, real life Jetpack also work without power armor and are kind of backpacks. So why not.
---
Need to get bitten by those small things the Mirelurk Queen spawns.
---
This may be totally wrong but months ago leaked pictures before the purveyor arrived showed another option at the bottom of the list
---
*** Murmrgh's Mystery Pick! for 65 scrips.
---
No idea if that is what is coming today or not. So speculation would be pointless when we should know for sure in a few hours. If it is totally random we would need to know what the drop rate is for armor versus weapons to determine how good of value it really it.
---
I tried and was there for 20 minutes do I need no clothes and armour on or something?
---
Have you seen Candy Crush? Or Pokemon GO, or basically any game with P2W mechanics like almost every EA game? 
---
PA skins are optional you don't need them and as I said you can farm Atoms.
---
I think you should re-evaluate your definition of a scam.
---
Imagine if you were this passionate about something that really mattered.
---
Man, don’t gatekeep this of all things. Everyone has a level they are comfortable with and you are over here insulting someone whose been racially discriminated against.
---
Side note: I’m not sure why you appear to be downvoting the guy, doing that if all else would seem to be proving his point.
---
inb4 at fissure site Alpha
---
i know, on which i was wrong, or was more a typo...again, first i've said was 18oo atoms for 18€/$...so what is it you want now? distort from facts?^^ you know very well what i meant and pls save me from this pathetic crap now^^ it's just wimpy^^ at the end, all bugs are still visible on the clip, and pa paint is still 18€, the price of a full dlc ,) no matter you nitpick over the 1 for 1 crap
---
You're playing a Fallout game and ignoring the history of Fallout games. Are you serious
---
so if one wants to negate the negative effects they have to, say it with me, MAINTAIN.  how you choose to deal with minus special instead of maintaining is beyond me, which is why I don't do junkie legendary effects, you either maintain or take a hit to special, whereas furious is just furious, and it's literally 5% less than junkies w/o the hassle
---
Fight unprepared people is called trolling, not pvp...
---
We aren't the ones trying to fuck up somebodies game session.....
---
I want it too but I dont know what im doing in that event
---
I paid 55k for a bloody swing speed meat hook. just a two star
---
Maybe at same time as inside the vault later today...
---
a slug???  more like something out of a fucking horror movie!!
---
Auyyyyy just got swamp itch then nvm I stripped completely and got it
---
I take all your bullets
---
well shit, I really wish I knew they had value because I have been scrapping them for scrip
---
Whoopsies is from a diseased mirelurk spawn. If you go to Quarry X3 in the bog, you can sit in the building and kill all the spawns from the queen other than the diseased ones. Then just wait for the disease. It can take a while but using radaway and being starving/dehydrated can help speed it up.
---
As everyone else is saying, that’s just FO76. I have a 2060 + 2700x and see similar frame rates.
---
When the twat with the buzz blade wouldn't shut up on the mic about what a PvP god he was (even with a controller), i'm pretty sure he's from survival.
---
you can't compare melee to any ballistic weapons
---
then you haven't watched literally any YouTuber or streamer, like half of them run around with a bloodied meat hoot
---
Best place to go is the quarry in cranberry bog with the mirlurk queen and her baby spawns. Be very dehydrated,  almost starving and take a radx. Let one of the babies attack you. You get it from them. I died a few times trying this, but got it after 15 minutes
---
no, I do not.
---
I choose chems which won't effect my build. By cherry picking my chems I don't have to worry about the negative effects. 
---
I don't think we're on the same page here. I'm honestly not trying to argue. Sorry if I came off that way.
---
I found and had a gunfight with a purple alien. I won, welcome to earth.
---
I had a bloodied ripper that I hung on to for months until player vendors came out. Haven’t seen them in forever though.
---
Your wrists are weak.
---
As mentioned by others baby shark is good (although hard to get out of your own head) but any bad song really. Even the old tried and tested means of just singing really badly and really loudly can be just as effective. Follow them round the map until they give up and hop servers. Good luck in your future travels bud
---
the real kicker is that it also works with nukashine for another +100% dmg
---
Wait does hunger and thirst affect it?
---
It might have been while we were stood around waiting for the event rewards to pop up, not technically in the "event" then.
---
The more quenched you are, the more disease resistance you have
---
I've been playing since launch and i'm only level 63.  Then again I don't exclusively only play F76.
---
All valid points man, and in regards to ESO I hope 76 follows the same path. I'd love it if a couple years from now we started getting expansions on the same level as Morrowind, Summerset etc, being able to learn what status other parts of the US are in would be a dream come true and definitely something I'd happily put $$ towards. End of the day it's Fallout content and 5 is at least a decade away so it's nice to have something to fill in the gaps, even if it does turn out to be hit and miss at times.
---
It's too bad that leveling in 76 doesn't do as much as it did in 4.
---
At higher levels in 4 you just have so much hp that you fear nothing.
---
In 76, you fear everything regardless of your level.
---
but why take a hit to *any* of your special points when you don't have to?
---
The highest I’ve seen was 548, I couldn’t even imagine holy shit
---
While I agree, its a fact the cellar bunker idea will still impact server load, I (might) still like the idea because it is a money maker for them and because its a camp feature that will impact player gfx cards less than something rendered "on the surface". I have a fairly old alienware with the settings turned down and I do get minor gfx stutter if a complex camp is set up near other complex objects such as right on the border of a town. Caveat: If it is going to impact servers so much that the gain I mentioned is negated I would be against it. No point in having good fps if you have server related latency.
---
is the green hood rare?  what about the wrapped cap (white hood)?
---
Didn't you hear? Killing someone in a GAME gives them the right to be toxic and call people assholes. Best just to ignore them and continue "ruining their game session"
---
I think u should be able to play things like a guitar in ur hand and just walk around playing songs ive seen banjos as junk items before i think it would be awesome if u could play them and different buttons would make different sounds so u could make a song or play a custom one
---
Can we just complain about the stability of this game? Why complain about something that is a possible, hell you be lucky if you get anything at all. There has been time I've killed a 3* and got nothing out of it.
---
I have 1000 hours but only because I run 5 dif. Characters and I am AFK half the time because of wife and children and work and adult life. So I eat and drink. A lot.
---
Right?! I loved survival mode because I wouldn't have to attack all the nice people in adventure mode.
---
looks like i have the plans for all the ultracite power armor pieces And for mod plans i have the motion assist servos and jetpack. if your interested and want to private message me your username we can work out the time to trade/ give u the mods of your interested.  Ill take the x-01 jet pack if your willing to give it but otherwise i have no use for the plans so i can still give them to you. As well as i can keep an eye out for the other ones your looking for since all i really do is drop nukes solo and run certain events these days.
---
The Virgin proper grammar vs The Chad combining words
---
A B2515 LMG can outdps the B2515 .50cal with the Lock and Load Rank 3, but i prefer too the .50cal in every situation over the LMG.
---
Since they buffed energy weapons I’m using my bloodied ffr ultracite gatling a lot and it eats cores without power user, i was using 4 charisma earlier it’s good for a lot of stuff.
---
OH! I would love to be able to visit some past fallout locations in earlier years. since west Virginia is next to Virginia, we could see a very early and freshly nuked DC. they could even add in some story elements that would help set up stuff that happened in Fallout 3. like discovering and clearing out Rivet City before people settled there, or help build megaton and stuff like that. They can even do something like that with Pittsburgh (the Pit)
---
that's legit
---
I hit level 522 last night.  I played way too much when the game first came out.  Any time a Fallout game is released, I use a week of vacation from work and pretty much spend 20 hours a day riding that bitch into the ground.  When this game first game out, XP was very easy to come by.  You could level up four or five times on a single Whitespring run.  And if you kept yourself well rested, your belly full of cranberry cobler, and had the proper charisma cards equiped, you'd be flying up the charts.
---
Agreed, this is why, as a PvPer, I am disinterested in that :&gt;
---
That sucks. I got bored as well and went back to new vegas for a few months. It slowed my progress but what can ya do? I'm back and having fun. I'm trying to do the tadpole quests now for the backpack.
---
Can the animals that spawn as part of these random encounters be tamed as pets?
---
What do you mean? I haven’t played in 4 in a year but it seems similar to me? Are you saying because you need to learn new plans?
---
07734
---
Your right, though when I first read it, it appeared to say "I was killed by.." and not "I was called a.."
---
for the lever action
---
all rifleman perks,
---
bloody mess,
---
tank killer,
---
(demo expert adds a bit of damage but its usually not worth to invest in it)
---
I believe you need Demo Expert, but ive seen conflicting posts as to whether its worth the perk slots or not
---
I haven’t played in a long while but I made a TON of caps selling bulk plastic and ballistic fiber. Try to learn where the military spots are and farm that ballistic fiber this was before white knight got nerfed, I can only imagine what it sells for now.
---
If you're on PC, in line with classic Bethesda tradition, there's a mod to fix that bug that they decided they don't want to or cant fix.
---
*If you're talking about the gun firing sound that never stops
---
It automatically equips better armor I thought?
---
Neither of those hats are rare. Just have to know where to look
---
I've been playing since launch and am level 251, with a little over 1,000 hours.  I've spent a lot of time exploring and camp building.  Once I reached level 200, I didn't worry so much about levels.  But I used the double XP weekends to get my levels up.  I get on during the weekends and an hour or so a night before going to bed.
---
Ok. Ill invest in those
---
It only buffs the 20% worth of explosive damage. So if base is 100, explosive is 20, so even if you double it it's only 20 more damage. The explosion radius however is worth it, as long as you kill them before they get too close lmao.
---
Meanwhile I'm struggling at lvl 25 to level up smh 
---
I'm clearing fallouting wrong
---
Ill have to go in depth to find out
---
Personal opinion: farming weapons/armor and scrap to learn mods before selling the scrap is better. You don't get as many caps but learning mods can super beneficial later!
---
Alternate for caps, loot any meat and flora you happen by and then cook and sell. You Need the thru hiker perk for reduced food weight, and hard bargain helpful.
---
Lots of vendors sell recipes for cheap to help maximise cooking. Hmu if you're interested in on PC, I'll donate recipes to the cause.
---
Yeah. I hate people that just sneak around in cloak! "Stand up and fight! I'm here for your workshop!" is what I say.
---
Eh, not exactly an even comparison though. It takes way less xp to gain a level from 1-100 than it does from 200-300. I don't remember the exact numbers but the difference is significant. I think it's like twice as much to go from 101 to 102 than from 99 to 100.
---
&gt; Is it a sense of humiliation, shattered pride and ego?
---
To me that is a straight to the point cut and dry question. That you took offense to it only reflects upon your approach and potential hard line bias toward the subject.
---
I think the OP has posed some very good questions that are applicable to many situations in this game, both in PvE and PvP scenarios. 
---
I'll bring up a fantastic example that occurs at least once a week and I think fits the OP's question perfectly. A player gets a bounty for one silly reason or another. There are many goofy mechanics in this game that can lead to an unintentional bounty, we all know that. Rather than facing the music and getting a bounty cleared, many people will elect to simply log off and server hop. Sadly when they load in, they still have that bounty. 
---
I've had people scream at me over voice for taking a bounty off them. Call me every name in the e-dictionary. I cannot think of any logical reason why a player should expect to be left alone when they earn a bounty.
---
Well I wasn't either, but you still hold other peoples assholery against me. Enjoy being griefed, can't wait til you guys are begging for a separate PVP server again.
---
if you want to use the weapon perfectly you probably want to do a stealth sniper btw so sneak,escape artist and covert operative would be nice 👍🏼 have fun :)
---
Ok. Too bad it wasn't an explosive shotgun
---
I see a huge boost in the damage numbers when I apply demo 6 to my explosive harpoon guns typically. Like from 650 to 1120. Is this just a bug in how it displays the damage in perks view? I've heard of that before but never really tested myself.
---
VTU baseball cap is also up there
---
Thanks!
---
Just last night while playing with a friend i ran into something similar, a dudes camp near Spruce Knob, had it built on top of one of the monorail towers, the last accessible one i might add.
---
he was gloating on about how he felt it was in his list of 10 camps he has built and blah blah blah, i gave him credit for how he did it, but trying to access it from directly below it was next to impossible even with the marsupial mutation or jet pack.
---
the only way to access it was doing a tightrope walk across the monorail rail and even then it wasn't really worth it, only had a couple things in his vendor and one was a 1\* knife he was trying to sell for 18k caps
---
Same here, mis read the post arrggg
---
Nah, you could get 5-10 levels an hour before they changed ghouls at whitespring.
---
Marsupial
---
I'd be down for this if they removed PVP restrictions from adventure mode.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  Don't think I have either recipe,  but I also didn't know that AP Regen differs thanks to the lack of info on the actual item ._.
---
My character is addicted to
---
Alcohol -1chr, -1agl
---
Daddy-O -1per, -1int
---
Daytripper -1chr, -1luck
---
Med-X -1agl, -10 DR
---
Mentats -1int
---
So I'm only losing -10DR, -2chr, -2 agl, -1per, -2 Int, -1 luck. For +50% damage. 
---
None of those stats hurt me much I have plenty of AP my DR is still great and Chr, Per, Int, and Luck are not even effecting my play. 
---
Also if I ever want to negate every negative effect it's just 1 X-Cell and a Med-X. Really it's not a bad trade off
---
Aren't they surprised when they find out I'm in anti-fall damage armor. 😋
---
keep your head up, things will get better.
---
An offline mode with no server limits, no enemies, no friends, no goals to reach, no grind, just a giant sandbox to build whatever I want for the sake of it. I always wanted something like it on this game, just to chill like in a giant zen garden or something. I know I can do all this shit on Minecraft and I used to do that, but I just like 76's graphics and world better, even with that awful building mechanics.
---
&gt;Next time, i will get it.
---
Yeah you will!
---
tehehee theys hunting wabbits

But, they seem to like it...

---
Myself and a fellow heavy Gunner will be on tonight around 8:30est if you are interested send me a message.
---
I'm about level 200 and I play maybe an hour a week because the game has gotten so boring. How can someone, xp glitch or not, spend that much time without becoming unbearably bored?
---
me too
---
The two spawns I know about are Flatwoods and the lakes near Top of the World. Are those the ones you meant?
---
Seconded, love me some pvp ahah
---
Huntersville.  If you fast travel there, there's generally a Mutant Hound spawn just up the road.  It's either that or, as you point out, West-Tek.
---
For spawns I'm less confident about - I know I've seen them at the Crashed Space Station.
---
You act like we started the game geared for PVP. But I was a PVP noob at one point. Died hundreds of times before I got the hang of it. Getting over the gear of dying is a must if you want to PVP or even just fend off PVP players effectively.
---
lol
---
loll
---
We never asked them to take away survival in the first place, donut.  
---
Show us on the doll where the bad adventure player touched you.
---
Yes 😔
---
I’d just be happy if the loop you play was a little longer and less obvious that the loop restarted
---
You could use the int one that gives 90% Energy ammo reduction, i have it instead og the one that prolong fusion cores
---
Sneak sniping the great khans was a highlight.
---
&gt;My one star gauss rifle does 1000 damage per hit to the SBQ.
---
You must be running stealth, Bloodied, or doing something special that causes this, because that's certainly not an out-of-the-box behavior.
---
&gt;steatlh bonuses need massive nerfs. \[...\] Crouching shouldn't quadruple my damage but it does.
---
Ah.  I.e. "I have the one setup that makes these weapons awesome, so everything needs to be nerfed."
---
Not how it works.
---
Wtf I did the exact same thing. 
---
Dammit Bethesda, with all the announcements and community challenges with different tiers or whatever.. just make a calendar next time.
---
I remember that also, There was that battle of the bots bug where in the end you hit a button and it gives you the pay out for the quest. But if you hit it repeatedly you could also gwin infinite quest payout it was nice.
---
Really? Just had some guy come into my camp recently and smack me over and over until my mutation went off and then he killed me and then proceeded to destroy my camp until i spawned in
---
I use batteriets include instead of power user, fusion cores at 0.3 is way Better than double time in power armor
---
Is that where the shooting noise never stops?
---
I was fighting robots last night and couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. Had to mute my game because it was so loud
---
When they teleport to the event , they open the pip boy , tab over to data , and deactivate the event. Then all they have to do is get shot by someone without pacifist on. Yesterday I had some time to kill waiting in a doctors office. I go to you tube and search for recent fallout 76 videos. One of them I saw yesterday was from rage chronicles. They are a couple of griefers that I have personally blocked on ps4. Small world I thought. The video I saw was showcasing exactly what you are talking about. They went to uranium fever and turned the event off. Proceeded to kill lots of players at the event . I did all I could and gave the video a thumb down.
---
Again, I don't think you played survival.....like ever. There weren't twats running around talking about how good they were at PVP. There were plenty of really tough people but there was always somebody who had their number. The few with major egos and little kid mouths never stuck around for more than 10 minutes, usually about how long it took for somebody to pop in and clear their streak. 
---
There's a handful of survival players that I tipped my hat to on a regular basis because I either flat out could not crack them with my builds, or I could kill them once for every ten times they killed me. Some of them were respectful, some of them had no interest in talking. But eventually I saw all of them die, repeatedly. There was always a counter. People I had no trouble killing could routinely take down people that gave me a hard time. 
---
The names I have seen running around trolling meat week are names I never saw in survival. Not once. 
---
I've had my share of meat week fun. At the cook event I stick around for five minutes just hoping somebody will shoot me or buzzsaw me. Sadly it has only happened twice. The amusement and area chat giggles of explosive harpooning a dumbass to death never gets old.
---
Cross-play would definitely bring down the prices of a lot of items on the 76 market which I am all for considering the prices varied widely between consoles. Plus I'd be able to game with my friends that own the game for XBOX or PC :-D
---
Or have it work like a combination of furious and junkies +5% per mutation flat damage up to 45%. But I don't see them ever changing it so Mutants Prefix will continue to be scrip
---
Which is rather unfortunate
---
Hey guys, new to the sub and don’t play fo76 very often (but I enjoy it very much!). Any word on when we’re getting NPC? Thanks!
---
It sure does to me! I'm full melee build and never touched a gun. Atoms here I come!
---
FOGGY MOUNTAIN BREAKDOWN!!!
---
Yup
---
Upvote I like it
---
Yeah, its probably only ky pet peeve, but trying to get the mods i want takes so painstakingly long. Its feels like a gamble. For example, ive been trying to get the handmade rifle some more mods but i dont even get enough handmade rifles to scrap and possibly get a mod. The current 'scrap to get plans' system is just kinda meh to me, but im sure not everyone shares that sentiment
---
Yeah I am. GT: Rocky Two Milli
---
I added the green hood since it goes with the travelers coat with back pack that covers the back pack from scouts. 
---
The assault mask is common vendor item that also goes with coat. 
---
The coat is a rare drop, took me forever.
---
Kids these days don't even know. If you do that on your calculator app and then turn your phone upside down, the screen just rotates with it 😓
---
Yep, still not fixed...
---
Yes that's a good shout. I was thinking about switching out Portable Power as I have only been using one PA recently anyway, so that would be a good replacement, especially since I tend to carry several Plasma Cores.
---
Standard. But not the same.
---
\*zoombies!
---
XBox so no solution till a patch fixes it! Well i could mute everything....
---
dense mods on armor is a really useful when you get caught close up using explosive weapons. i can't count the times using an explosive shotty that i've dropped loot. loots and loots

---
I know we all like to act hard as fuck, but I still had to deal with the sting of being killed too. I think it's hard for some to go from knowing the game very well to essentially being a noob again. PVP has its own sets of skills and reflexes, and learning them takes time and practice, it's honestly like learning a whole new game. I got railroaded and killed so many times to get there.
---
Being a good sport when killed is a skill you gotta develop. But it is so freeing when you don't fear death anymore.
---
This is really the only way to go with rifles.
---
Just got it and finished the challenge thanks man
---
Probably because it should have been one lol
---
Yep we are back to this shit now that their sandbox got taken away. I have been accosted more than once by these rejects trying to screw with anyone they can....
---
Over four times the population of West Virginia actually.

If you use Flachettes mod, game calculate bonus damage for all separate harpoons, so it looks ridiculous (my BE Harpoon showed 4500+)
---
yes, you're more prone to diseases.
---
Zeta alien or flatwoods monster?
---
Yeah, but you miss that great fizzz-BANG!  sound.
---
I kind of like it. It’s Grindy, but I like having to collect more weapons to be able to tweak that perfect weapon. This is resource intensive, but you can buy handmade plan and build a bunch and scrap. Use super duper to make multiple at a time.
---
It could be the exact opposite, that they ARE a part of Wastelanders, and they’re saving most of that faction gear for Wastelanders release and/or as in game rewards.
---
I will be on tonight as well, lvl 166 IGN Janynfletcher
---
Given I have 5-6 mutations right now, I would like that. 
---
Would offset the loss of bloody mess (in order to equip starched genes and class freak)
---
No! You can only get atoms with money! 800 atoms is $8! Fake news!
---
A bit of googling told me it was the flatwoods monster.
---
Well I'm kinda interested in game development and this type of problem is on hell of an issue to fix. And I don't really care about weapons sold on eBay, what I admire is the work that the development team of Bethesda game studios Austin is making to fix this game. So my only solution resides on the community of fallout 76.
---
Thanks for your opinion.
---
its because these fools lost their sandbox so they are all back in our backyards again with nothing to do....
---
I've always turned off that annoying feature. If Im in bed, Im laying on my side, I want to be able to see what's on the screen.
---
Im quessing it will take quite a long before phones use front camera to see which way the user wants to keep the phone.
---
That's what I like about this. It comes with trade offs to help balance it further yet ,especially the weapon suggestion. If you want to get the extra boost in damage from more mutations, you need 5 perks invested into starched genes and class freak to keep the downsides to a minimum. Where AA or two shot doesn't require that
---
Actually yes for “reroll”. Spend 50 on 3 star weapon, scrip it to get 40 back. So it really only cost you 10
---
I hit 3 to 4k in headshot with my IE lever (sneak+instigating+1 nerd rage+1 adrenaline)
---
I am very much interested. Let me know when you're ready.
---
Alright, let me know when you're ready.
---
Isn’t the half-life of uranium like several billion years?so why would particles of uranium scattered throughout the landscape not be radioactive after 200 years?
---
if you dont have the quest for it active you cant deliver them. Just because you found the documents doesnt mean you can deliver. You have to have the quest active first...
---
Gain + win = gwin
---
Very neat! Although one thing I’d like to point out is that the Vault pictured in the image is very likely not a Vault that currently exists in game. The updated Wastelanders promo image is from the E3 trailer, and if you zoom in close on the image of the Vault door, you can see the number 79 on it- and Vault 79 is not one of the Vaults currently in Appalachia.
---
Based on the presence of the crashed space station in the image I’m assuming Vault 79 will get added to that large swathe of empty space in the northern Toxic Valley, finally giving us at least one Vault per region.
---
its a complete cluster foxtrot...all people do is run around and shoot things and die. There is no coordination, no one takes a pylon, I stay far away because it is just a waste of time most times. The chance of finding a few players that actually know what they are doing is very slim.
---
&gt; Super Dupers, but my level 42 hasn't gotten any yet.
---
That's  not random, the card has high level requirement. 48 to 50 I think.
---
I couldn't get it to work.
---
I saw dudes using the glitch and the were only 170~ and it was taking them like 15 minutes to get a lvl up
---
Lol. Are you serious? After initially being bummed that I couldn't use the skin, I was very impressed with how they handled the situation so I decided to make a positive post about it. You are the one who came in here with a negative comment
---
Forgot to mention he picked one of my level 0 locks to get a bounty before he hit me. Maybe a work around?
---
I understand the concept of the workshops but i thinks it crap someone doesnt come up to you for the challenge instead take you out while youre defending or building.  I just dont do em anymore not worth the headache.  It would be nice if they let you opt out of the pvp so you can just give it up if someone wants it.  Woukd take away from trolling players from doing that nonsense.
---
Cold hands.
---
A bunch of versions ago, whenever you had a (quantity) of tech data, when you turned one it, it took them all.
---
A few patches later, only the first tech data you find (marked with a diamond in your inventory) the one that initiates the quest, is the only one that's taken when you do the turn in.  
---
Any other tech data you pick up after the first one, but before you do the turn in, remains in your inventory.
---
After turning in the single, dropping/picking up the remaining does not restart the quest
---
They are worth 1 cap, so you can sell them to vendors.  in my experience, buying them back from the vendor will sometimes restart the quest, but not always.
---
We will aee but thanks mate.
---
Something called sportsmanship goes a long way. You can have friendly competition... I’ve met more people doing PvP than picking up tin cans and desk fans. A friendly “GG” message or a shoutout in area chat goes a long way.
---
It’s just a game.
---
My guess would be mid to late November specifically. Gives them just enough time to polish it and push it out the door before Christmas.
---
Will do
---
Still waiting on the zeta to show up.
---
frigging dupers....
---
No extra sorry, trimmed myself down a while back. Got full sets of most legendary types and scripped the rest.
---
I wrote a paper checklist of every set I wanted and crossed them off when I got them. Like 
---
Ghoul Slayers LL LA RL ~~RA~~ C
---
Troubleshooters ~~LL LA RL C~~
---
Takes a while, but you'll get there. For my second character I got three different pieces of Exterminators armour for 150 caps each at a player vendor about an hour after I decided to look
---
or you could get +45% dmg and not take any of those hits.  you said several times cherry pick, well sure maybe you aren't losing what is important to your build but that means you are taking a hit in a stat that is already low.
---
Just get yourself a fertilizer producer, milk, store, repeat.
---
.50 was buffer some updates ago, the dmg is really good, rifleman almost always are sneaking so you can one shot almost everything with sneak bonus, even better if you have a instigating one.
---
&gt; solo scorchbeasts,
---
I got my first non-PA melee solo this week!  Level 60!  
---
I have to go on a spring-finding mission though, all my stuff broke.
---
You probably know I asked this also because of your answers on different post; and no, I didn't know the reasons, hence me asking.  
---
Anyway, while I might find such attitude amusing, to each his own.
---
That's not a workaround. Picking your lock makes him wanted and starts PvP for him. It's as intended.
---
Yeah I search constantly. I’ll find them eventually. Thanks for checking!
---
Orrrrr... New Vegas.
---
I had a guy leave 5k of 10mm, .308 and .556 on the ground in their camp.
---
Also had a guy leave his stash for a mule underneath a couch at a camp. Due to the building rendering being bugged, I could see through the couch and could pick everything up... Lots of stable flux...
---
Pair it with professional drinker. Saves on water
---
Nigga so i can pick a lock and pvp with anyone i want even tho they dont hit me back?
---
I think most people- myself included- avoid it because 9 times out of 10 unless you formed a group specifically to tackle the event, you’ll end up with either too few people to successfully complete it or a pile of disorganized and/or underleveled people who don’t know what they’re doing who inevitably cause the event to fail, making it a huge waste of time and resources.
---
It was definitely a bug because I accidentally removed my addictions and now my damage is back to where it should be.
---
I agree I dont think it is funny, they are assholes. I am coming to spend caps at your shop and this is how you treat me? Your lucky I cant burn your place to the ground and my fucking nuke ability is still bugged or I would nuke just your place in return!
---
Yeah it helps but you got a trick for frog Eggs?
---
Mutants is still a decent  prefix.  It’s as good as two-shot, that everyone seems to WAY overpay for on nerfed TSE weapons.  I’d rather have a Mutants Exploding Lever than a TSE.
---
It all depends on who else is there and how much DPS they are doing. This is the REAL answer! IF they are kicking your ass and you dont make it in the top list of DPS people you wont get anything. I have been there and kicker her ass and gotten nothing because they other guys beat me when it came to DPS....
---
Weird. I've done the event and my entire server just spawned in to help. We took care of it with ease. It was usually me or my friend that would tank the pylons while keeping her attention away from the DPS in our party.
---
Mmm donuts 
---
And I like adventure mode players too! Coming back and checking out vendors and admiring your camps and doing events with polite teamwork was fun too.
---
If their mutation hits them then yes. Wanted players are hostile to everyone.
---
Definitely skip Demolition.  It’s a waste of points.
---
Thats awesome!
---
So its technically a work around buddy.
---
Interesting, so it works like an Exploding Gatling Plasma.
---
Building your base there gets up a lot of  peoples noses as it can interfere with the ghoul spawns...
---
TBH the losses don't effect me. I notice no difference with the stat losses. 
---
To each thier own. Furious has its merits and I'm not knocking it I just like drugs.
---
Also while we're on the furious effect topic. Do you know if it actually works on a Tesla? Or does hitting everything else nullify the effect?
---
The accuracy loss really sucks with 2-shot.
---
In theory, but exploding gatling plasma has enormous spread, while harpoon with flachettes works more like a shotgun.
---
Thanks! I haven't had this issue at all up until this week's update so I didn't know about these glitches.
---
I mean we do earn atoms from playing soooooo
---
Workaround is when something is used for an unintended purpose. PvP here is intended. If you don't want people picking your locks, don't put locks.
---
weeks? Some of us have been after it for months or almost a year now and still not gotten it. Saw one for sale at a player camp for 25000 caps. Saw one on ebay for $35. That is how rare it is.....
---
No problem. With the racial sets the level/damage resistance don't really matter. With a full set you're going to be negating 75% of an enemy's damage anyway. I also Ultra-Light and either BoS or Standard every piece for the lowest weight because you're not gonna be wearing these sets that often. So try not to get Heavy pieces, or swap them out if you find a lighter piece of the same type because they'll just be a hindrance when you're rarely wearing them
---
Oh, you 100% can. And have been able to forever. You simply have to quit the event and then run into people's gunfire and hope one of them aren't on passive for it to count as them triggering PvP for you to shoot back at them.
---
It was gone for hours for me the other day with multiple server as well, but I checked last night and it did indeed show back up.
---
Damn!
---
Exactly.  That’s why it always baffles me when I see person after person looking to buy TSE weapons.  TSE is a below average weapon, there are so much better combinations. Still people continue to happily pay 25K for a TSE. 🤷‍♂️
---
So true. Occasionally you get some shit talkers but a lot of players seemed way too focused on the fight to engage in shenanigans like that haha. A guy waving around a buzzblade like a dick would get dropped so fast!
---
Good to know!
---
After I maxed my Vanguard Sniper, ive just been spending levels on crafting perks, and various QOL perks.
---
Thru Hiker has saved me so much during both meat weeks
---
Totally the definition and only definition reddit user
---
And ammo is insanely easy to craft. I'm collecting reduced weight 3star ones for my rifle build. Instigating kicks ass. Still hunting for an executioners
---
Although I'd rather new locations, I'd 100% be down to revisit The Pitt, the tone of that area is unmatched and I loved the whole burning sky/industrial design of it. Appalachia's great but I miss having more urbaness.
---
This is why games need level caps
---
trip wire exploit with auto clicker and just leave it running all day
---

Sheet music plans.  Find new sheet music, learn new songs.
---
I agree! So, I've been using the wrong perk cards 😑
---
Leader bobble head will help with xp but keeping with story line of overseers mission and discovering everything in Forest area will help you also. 
---
Starting the scout quest line, Frat Party daily guest line will help a lot. 
---
Scrap everything so you can learn weapon plans and even armor plans.
---
Just lower the weight of rifles please
---
I've been making sure to join this and Project Paradise every time I see them as I'm high enough level that all the other events except the SBQ are easy to solo now. I'm usually just tank the pylons when I show up, I do two-handed melee and don't do bloodied so I can take a beating. I helped another group that was running it the other day, though I was a little frustrated that I didn't get to tag the imposter so didn't get any loot.
---
Does that give people the right to start using racial swear words and death threats over mic because someone did something that's perfectly fair within the game's mechanics? Get over it, it's a videogame.
---
With bugs to...enhance the difficulty.
---
You do. 
---
Even when survival mode was active... there are 2 goons (not in a group) in particular that always go around stabbing &amp; shooting everyone when buying or doing anything ( my camp is near WS station ) 
---
It winds then up to lock them out of the vendor bot... spent 15mins one night watching one of these losers trying to smash me out of the station... all in the hope that if he got me far enough away that I would disconnect from the robot... so I had a beer and a sandwich whilst he pushed me out and down the steps of WS station and into the rubbish pile... I was still locked into the trade screen and it killed him !! He left the server shortly after :)
---
I somehow didn't discover the freak show until a couple weeks ago. was poking around the savage divide looking for a new camp.

At the Super Duper mart.

How does this work with concentrated fire. If fighting a beast long enough in VATs, like say an SBQ, do you end up doing huge damage?

Blocking build my guy. 90% damage reduction while blocking. Then you get the reflect 50% effect also on a weapon and ooh... You're cooking. Not with gas, but somethin'
---
I'm level 40 and I've been playing since beta.
---
176, just after you in timespan.  No clue where my hours are at.  Agreed that too many people make assumptions.
---
Dude whitespring used to give 5-10 lvls per clear before xp nerfs.
---
I hit lvl 70 week one. Quit shortly after. Came back recently about a week ago I'm already lvl 90.
---
Grinding is very easy in 76. The issue is y'all don't know how to lvl properly.
---
I would agree with you but it’s the 3rd of October... it’s like Christmas music before Thanksgiving...lol
---
Good advice!  I have a mismatched set of unyielding I use when I go to purveyor.  Otherwise I don’t run bloodied. So just same principle.  Thanks!
---
Was there a reason to why they took it out?
---
If they're gonna retool it to make it more survival (adding cold weather that hurts you if you arent kept warm) or make it a rust type mode where you go in with nothing and drop everything on death, I wouldn't mind that either.
---
Love this idea. My toons are dressing up starting tonight!
---
What platform? I do it every time I see it. I think it's a fun fight AND you get a bunch of lead and steel scrap from the bots.
---
Ok. It's rare .... Thx for the info . Won't spending my time on it
---
I love the PVP adrenaline in this game. Ever since some high level dude came and took the munitions factory from me back in the day. I just can't play it any other way now! I don't know what to do without survival mode.... I really don't like fighting in adventure mode at all. And for some reason NW just doesn't give me the same adrenaline rush.
---
I’m in my mid-40’s and don’t remember this. I am also in the phase of my life where my brain is randomly replacing my knowledge with random neuroses like turning lights off in rooms where family members have vacated.
---
Honestly, that doesn't even register what with the server crashes, slugworm ghouls, and half a dozen other serious glitches still in the game.
---
I think it's dropped for good so they can hopefully leverage the playerbase over to NW.  
---
Which probably won't work as these people have spent *months* fine tuning their armour and weapons.
---
Eh, they fixed those to where they don't do the ridiculous damage they used to. Before the fix, shotguns got a 20% bonus on each pellet. Now they only get the regular 20% bonus that everything else gets.
---
Learn how to play? 
---
I mean heck add me on xbox if you are on Xbox. I'll show you how to power level.
---
It’s weak because a lever hits just as hard, but has a higher fire rate.  Hunting Rifle sucks right now, unless you can’t find a lever
---
A lot of people are telling you to sell junk. Be aware that most junk has to be bulked at a Tinkerer's Workbench to be sold to vendors. My advice is to focus on leveling and questing. Once you get far enough, caps aren't much a problem. Enjoy the story and the atmosphere.
---
I know I have killed a lot of MOBs with one easiest way to know for sure is track the challenge and then kill someone with it.
---
I was referring to them calling non pvpers toxic.
---
You used to be able to blow up the vertibot at the ammo factory. 
---
 Blow it up then repair. 
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
You guys sure get pissy when someone pokes fun at you so do what ever you need to cope.
---
I appreciate that a lot. Please feel free to reference. Remember to send me a link of your video. It going to be great.
---
Anyone that wants to know how to lvl fast add me on xbox gt: The LastDudeGuy
---
Serious, way to many on here who think it's some big to do to level...
---
The Mystery Pick event will start a little later today, just as Meat Week ends, around 12pm ET!

Thats what I been doing as well. Get some shot gun ammo also for selling.

As a rifleman it is going to be hard to out dps a handmade in the long term. Consider running low health with adrenal reaction to boost your output. I use a quad explosive handmade and it hits her on the nose for around 75 +10 per shot without a sneak bonus. 
---
I have a bloodied lever that thumps her pretty good but the slow fire and reload rates can't touch the overall dps of the quad handmade.
---
you can only equip one of a card at a time. If you try to equip a second, it'll replace the first if you have capacity.
---
Yeah. I'll take workshops from other people but I don't kill them unless they attack me first. A lot of players just let you take it. Few actually put up a fight it seems.
---
I meant it like if there was loads of human semen on someone, I’m not sure what a “Boston cream pie” is
---
1337=leet
---
old thing from the late 80s??? jesus christ... am I an ancient thing born in the late 80s?
---
Yeah, I discovered the railway rifle when the purveyor gave me a quad + faster fire + faster reload that I run on auto, and it's fantastic, though the recoil gets old.
---
I've got a low health junkies with the plague walker mutation. I'm an irradiated disease ridden drug addicted mutant. Usually starving and dehydrated from all the parasites and dysentery I get from eating raw meat and drinking dirty water.
---
I respect that honestly. I hate PVP in adventure mode because you guys just wanna be chill and friendly. I love the PVP adrenaline, It's a totally different way to play but I don't know how the two styles could really ever be meshed together. Wish they just kept survival mode up so you wouldn't have to worry about us like that.
---
Well we killing off 1/2 of the US population to get a great deal.  [Shame](https://tenor.com/view/reaction-shame-hot-fuzz-shotgun-gif-4971896)
---
It's totally doable solo, especially if you make some feed for Chally beforehand. You just have to keep grabbing the greens and chunks and pick up poop and put out fires if you see them.
---
Pretty sure console has those problems as well.
---
Okay I had to check, but I’ve been playing since launch.  I have 1130 hours on my character that is a level 300, and I never used any exploits either. That averages 3.4 hours a day, which sounds right to be honest, so that 878 is either cheating or has even less of a life than I do.
---
He never saw their names before in survival listen to this guy.
---
DPS checks like the SBQ convinced me to invest in the full set of commando perks to swap over to as needed for my former rifleman. Now I swap back and forth between commando and rifleman as circumstances dictate.
---
No. I'm sure I understood the first time: [Non-PvPers are mad toxic and they don't even realize it.](https://youtu.be/USwueQH_7j0)
---
He was right. Gotta love the downvotes for be literally right, though. Racial slurs and death threats are actual bannable offenses.
---
thanks, Robopop789. i trust your input. this is what i thought. many thanks! 
---
edited: i answered my own question i asked you.
---
I went to highland marsh, killed the adult enemies, and ran back and forth over the eggs to get the spawn to emerge.  I then killed the non diseased spawn, took a diluted rad away to increase my disease chance, and let the diseased spawn feast on me.  Contracted the disease the first time I tried.
---
I’ll look for the skeleton outfit, people should make and sell them in vendors for 1 cap
---
Out of interest, which country are you from?  
---
Here in the UK we have Halloween at the end of October, not the start. I actually thought it was the same everywhere
---
Entire month of October is Halloween. My decorations are up at my house already!
---
Or pointing out horrible flaws.
---
There was a good amount of people there last night and I was doing about 90-150 damage with my bloodied power fist on her and I got enough hits in to get her loot. I used a handmade now and then but I can’t remember how much I was doing and I used my tse Tesla rifle but it did 11-33 damage.
---
I have the plan and will do this 👍🏻
---
Would tank killer help? Heard they added it to energy weapons but not sure if guass fell into that.
---
thank you. i'll check the vendors after work today. you're the man, eckserah.
---
I'm not opposed to your idea I just think that Marsupial is the equivalent...to many people i see on gaming forums cry about new suggestions when it fact if you don't want it don't use it plain and simple....hope it comes just watch out for the lames that are gonna scream "Why , so they can add it to the atom shop them greedy bastards ! "
---
Are you on pc?
---
I am in the UK too and the whole of October is Halloween for me. :-) you have to wring the maximum amount of spook out of the event if you love it as much as I do.
---
Thank you everyone, A lot of useful information and tips. I'll definitely take them on board 👌
---
I don't think anyone here is referring to the people who want to PvP. It's nothing to do with sportsmanship when people are trying to exploit pacifist players for an easy "win", sure it's just a game but there's also something called playing dirty.
---
Radioactivity in the FO series behaves how it was believed to behave back in 40s or 50s (the exact decade escapes me.) Hence the giant roaches and other scientific impossibilities. 😉
---
I’m only kidding, I love Halloween!
---
Bethesda's probable releasing nicer items (clean/non raider) later. I see it kinda like Rockstar with GTAO releasing faster and better vehicles as time goes on. Gotta make the old stuff feel inferior prompting players to buy before its gone.
---
I'm a sneaky sniper build, so I can keep shooting while they're flying around, then I use Mysterious Stranger as an aggro draw, and the last one I fought had a lvl 66 yao guai show up to distract it, which I then had to dispatch once the scorchbeast was dead.  But I was still pretty proud of myself for killing a lvl 65 with a squishy gun build.  And this was all at some stranger's camp - I'd been shopping when the scorched hit.
---
So you could pay your debt of 68k dollars to the lottery?
---
I’m with you on that. I have already unzipped my case of horror films. Hoping to find inspiration for a creepy camp.
---
Surely that's not impossible? Granted I've only been playing since the free e3 week but I'm at 280ish now I think. Without food or sleeping all the time to stay well rested. From what I hear xp gain has been nerfed quite a lot since launch so maybe they just grinded out a lot of events early on? Plus the double xp events and stuff
---
I don't think it's a big enough buff to weapons. They would still be scrip at 2%. It's also not all that interesting of a mechanic. 
---
The armor suggestion is interesting. I think that is large enough to make it a preferred prefix for a few people (also interesting if it would add to END, unlike unyielding), though the current state is not that bad. Mutants is not an auto-scrip prefix. One of my armor pieces is still mutants because all of the other rolls (base type and affixes) are great.
---
Hopefully a better more original mode will come into play that has elements of survival in it.
---
Looking at you, Survival mode from Tom Clancy's The Division.
---
Hope we can blue tape everything soon.
---
Gatling Plasmas and 50 cals work nice. My JE 50 cal does 12 per shot with just lvl 3 Stablised and one each of the heavy gunner perks. I also have a few Gatling plasmas that do good damage but I think the fire rate may be quicker on a Gatling plasma so overall they may be better.
---
If you have points in luck... and are bloodied...
---
Bloody vats crit gauss
---
Critical every other shot... 
---
Quad work nicely too if not bloody build as the reload can suck...
---
As a rifleman, you aren't really going to "melt" her - even with commando perks.  Sure, you will definitely get her down within the timeframe, but that will be it.
---
I'm running with a BE primed handmade, have maxed out commando perks along with bloody mess, tank killer, ground pounder, adrenal reaction, better criticals, etc.  
---
If I take chems and the stars align, I can hit between 500 to 600.  If it's a normal fight, I average about 150 per shot.
---
That said, we have a guy that can put out 6000+ damage per hit on her.  He's using a BSS+str meat hook, and pickles himself with a cocktail of chems, booze, food, and magazines during the fight. 
---
Our team can get her dead in around 30 seconds once she lands.
---
atom shop full cover masks provide protection without the -2 PER loss.
---
i think it's because it's a random drop and hard to farm. i was fortunate enough to get one on my main back when arkos content first dropped and more people were doing it, but very few people run that event now. and i think you get it when all the animals survive, not with just one, but i'm not 100% sure on that.
---
i'm honestly surprised people even sell them since it would always be better to just level up an alt and learn it on there so you could get additional rolls with scrip on a second character.
---
Considering the crazy prices on the fixer (which is relatively easy to get because people still farm the imposter) i would imagine the price on the bear arm plan to be kind of nutty if not impossible.
---
a better way to get it is probably to organize people to go and run the event. then lots of people could get it. since lots of people want it, maybe not so bad to do.
---
i think the random nature of that event also makes it kind of painful to acquire and schedule parties to farm it.
---
Agreed. Playing one character since the Beta and I’m halfway through 98th lvl right now. Trying to reach 900th level seems like it would take me eight more years of playing. :)
---
I got a gjallarhorn!
---
I agree and also feel bad for anyone who thinks 25K is the market rate for non-legacy TSEs.
---
Highest I have seen was someone about 650
---
Ah, fair enough. :)
---
so glad i bookmarked this to read @ work, so many great stories and characters!
---
1) Pipper (main ch):  The first vault baby and mastermind of the Great Nuka Cherry Heist of Vault 76 before Reclamation Day.  Great-great-great-great-great-grandmother to Piper Wright.  At first, she attempted to chronicle the events of Appalachia but bitter encounter after bitter encounter have left her timid and apprehensive.  Now, she spends her days as a junker queen, collecting and scrapping each and every shiny bauble that catches the attention of her deteriorating mind.  It has been so long since she's talked to other people, she can only communicate through grunts or gestures.  Plans, magazines, and other content may stymie her descent into gibbering madness, but eventually she will still just become a moleman.  (como mi tia, Murmurgh!)
---
2) django: junky pistolero.  "i cant believe those dipsh\*ts at the vault actually let my mom in.  she was some floozy shacking up with a bigwig when the bombs dropped.  we were always second class citizens in there, it was even worse when ma died.  Sooooo im sooooo glad to be out!  been wanderin' around, just killin, shootin, stabbin, whatever i had to to get that next fix, but i'm alright.  its those tin can sonsabitches you gotta watch out for; they've got nothing to live for but to kill ya and take whatever crap you had in your pockets.  stay frosty amigo and don't get burnt up, hahahaha"
---
3) Camden Callie: One-handed Commie Whacker Specialist.  "What you want me to talk into this damn thing?  I worked at the park before the war.  Vault-tec hired me to do custodial work, so I was in there when the bombs dropped.  They wouldn't let me out, my house is still there.  My house is still there right next to Camden Park, yes.  These dumb Vault lunkheads kept me locked up in there for 25 years.  That's my house, damnit, right next to the park, now can I go?  I'm late for my shift at the park."
---
Nice! the second star for explosive helps with the first kill where adrenaline and nerd rage aren't kicking in. What do you hit for the first shot at full HP, or do you run bloodied?
---
Hmm lets see. Did i say people around your level rang hmmmmm no i didnt so whom sounds ignorant. My glitch comment was directed towards what i posted. The players that are in the 800+ range. You should go back and reread what he wrote and I wrote lol. All your comment is doing it proving my point. That players in the 800+ range most likely used the glitch. Where do you fall in that category?
---
I think it does. I had it equipped.
---
Just a friendly reminder that for some people with disabilities or fragile medical conditions, social games like this are their only way to get the kind of regular human interaction we all take for granted. That player may not have been outside since last November, so I'm glad they are enjoying our community enough to spend that much time in it! 
---
The real question, though, is do they FINALLY have the explore for 7200 hours achievement?
---
I was going back and forth between 2-3% a mutation. But a 45 % buff from 15 mutations is quite a bit and kinda kills AA and two shot, even 10 mutations puts you above them at 30%. Using 2% with 12-14 mutations sets it right between the two atleast. Junkies is a nice buff at 50%, but you need to maintain addictions. Bloodied needs low life , and furious needs a fast fire, low damage weapon or a high Life enemy. I was just figuring on balance. I also think it's a good thing that you personally wouldn't want 2% , that enforces my idea of balance and variety, and that it might not be the right choice for everyone, I don't want it to be the best ,just viable 🙂
---
as soon as the first leaf falls, it is the spooky time.
---
It’s basically goth Christmas. And my inner goth is very strong. 🖤🕷🦇🕸
---
Honestly it's some of the people on this subreddit, maybe even reddit in general. There has been plenty of toxicity thrown our way around here. Pve players call us assholes and just can't be chill about it even when we have our own corner of the game they can completely avoid. There's always some excuse as to why PVP shouldn't exist in this game even if it's separate like survival mode. Just check out some posts for this week, the haterade flows strong here.
---
Go to any other subreddit for a game that has open world PvP modes and you'll see the same PVP/pve drama. When I saw pvers in other games complaining about devs wasting resources on PVP stuff, and saying all the same bullshit assumptions about pvpers, It's almost like a copypasta. It's a tale as old as time and we are just playing ourselves. maybe it's not the games themselves guys.
---
They won't bring anything else back to replace it. This is a cost saving exercise, they don't need to maintain two slightly different code sets and they won't need to have another set of server images waiting to launch with Amazon.
---
to me, Xmas music before thanksgiving is WHY we need to start Halloween as early as possible. if Santa can get two months of buildup, then Jack should have at least one.
---
Get yourself a heavy gun. The rifleman build is good for clearing mobs but just doesn't have the dps to make a big dent in the queen.
---
Not that there's anything wrong with that. You can still be effective at a queen fight and win the event even if you aren't one of the top damage dealers. There's no shame in being a support character. I'm fact most queen fights I go into could use a few more people clearing mobs. 
---
But if you want to feel like you are a deciding factor in the fight.... Go for the heavy guns. 50cal, minigun, gatling laser or plasma.
---
No, I thought you were saying that you were looking for sturdy combat armor not heavy combat armor.
---
Haha. Totally.
---
is a spacesuit with the moonshine mama fasnacht mask acceptable? i have a skeleton costume and map if not, but i feel the spacesuit with a blue face that has a rocket sticking out of its eye really matches with the whole "Space Zombie" thing i go for.
---
As alot of other folks said its an inconvenience. I play RPGs mainly and have never been a fan of pvp or battle royal modes. At all. And most, not all but most, fallout fans are the same. We just love fallout, we dont like dying repeatedly for no reason. This is the only new fallout content we're going to get for years. And we want it our way. This is the wrong view of course because as advertised this is fallout with pvp. Which imo is implemented poorly. And thats on bathesda. The only way to make anyone even slightly happy is for these guys to implement seperate pvp servers.  
---
Its almost as if bathesda is catering to the griefers. They are the only ones who win under the current system. For real true pvpers have a server full of people who dont want to fight and us rpgers have to deal with the people who do. 
---
For the rpgers dying is a failure. Its time to tweak your build and change your tactics and try again. Getting insta popped by someone you never even saw and having no viable way to protect yourself from that happening is extremely frustrating. Thats not what we're here for. If there were a Fallout 5 out right now the 76 servers would be empty except for the pvpers. 
---
Its just two different types of gamers wanting two different types of games. And Bathesda trying to go into the pockets of both is kind of bringing down the experience for everyone. Just my opinion and I certainly speak for noone but myself. I dig the question though man, stay classy 😄😄😄
---
Huntersville usually has a couple of hounds accompanying the mutants there
---
Yep same happened to me. Was on top of Seneca rocks. Used to spawn on top perfectly an now I spawn at the bottom everytime. Tried moving the thing an changing stuff around nothing worked. Had to move CAMP.
---
If not toxic I’d personally call this topic controversial at least. From what I see from this post specifically, all comments with a positive tone towards PvP are getting pretty heavily downvoted. 
---
Looking at this from the outside as best I can there does seem to be some evidence to the idea that the PVE community is being atleast resentful to the PVP community.
---
I’ve tried to stir the pot with PvP at Meat Week event but not until the event is over.  I’ve also had it happen to me especially it seems at Whitesprings train station (go figure).  
---
The occasional PvP can be a lot of fun.  Myself and another rando got into it with the tenderizers.  God that weapon sucks but we had fun. 
---
I wish you could jack Grahm or Chally.  Just once.
---
*7600
---
I've noticed this as well.  The spawn points for myself and my visitors were very consistent for months.  But out of the blue, it now tends to randomly spawn me to the far right of my CAMP in the shrubs.  Couldn't tell you why.
---
I wonder if it's related to the Collectron wandering over that way and blocking those spawn points.  I can't remember if this was a thing *before* the Collectron.
---
I just put a post out on the market sub to buy the plans
---
I have a similar story: 
---
After leaving the vault I accepted an invite from a complete stranger to play in a band. I didn't know then that I'd wind up dead in a ditch, but I soon found out.
---
6 months later and I still don't accept random invites.
---
I don’t think these builds are OP, they require significantly more resources to run than your standard stealth sniper commando.
---
Good trade off to the damage and survival you get from these.
---
Some good points, so a caps sync and way to store caps like 5.56 rounds, I'll look at the recipes at the bunker :D
---
I do use serum to remove the negative effects from my mutations as my luck points are low this so will be a net positive.
---
That i can appreciate, I have things that could be considered 'halloween decorations' in my house all year round. Just not into the whole 'trick or treat' thing.
---
Which Trade glitch are you referencing?
---
The inability to initiate trade with certain players until you fast travel to an event and then return?
---
The random closing of the trade interface after you have tagged half the items you want to mark... then have to do it again.... and again... and again?  Until you finally give up and dump it in a world container?
---
Or some other trade glitch?
---
Hey are you on PS4?  I’ll gladly PvP at Meat Week and bring along my Quad Fletchettes.  That’s such a quirky yet fun weapon just like the auto railway rifles!
---
It's annoying that they're still at the penny pinching stage with the games funding. This is just about spinning down the survival mode server instances.  
---
What they save running survival, they'll spend on the instances for Wastelanders.
---
Have you seen their names in survival? 
---
The down votes keep coming but is it really so implausible that there are simply jackasses out there that fire this game up only when there are events that bring masses of people together to one spot greatly reducing the amount of effort required to grief? Not only that but the salt in the air over survival creates high probability for crying and retaliation, which is what these people live for. 
---
No that can't be it.....has to be those survival players. 
---
I'm not sure what exact parameters are/were in place for server region, but in several months of exclusively playing survival I saw two servers online at most at any given time for my region, and a total of maybe 30 regular players. By regular players I mean people that I saw online in survival routinely. Since survival was taken down I have seen most of those same names in adventure. Guess what, they aren't running around trying to instigate pvp. 
---
But yeah, what I'm saying doesn't fit the witch hunt. Plenty of legitimate good advice in these comments. Keep pacifist on, ignore, server hop, don't engage. Following that advice will keep you out of trouble.
---
I choose a different route, I hope they buzzsaw me and I get a chance to see what kind of pvp god they really are. A pvp god I am not, but so far not a single one of these dumbasses has survived, let alone come back for more.
---
I pretty much exclusively buy from vending machines. Every time I enter a trade menu with someone they want to buy my best stuff. Got tired of saying no.
---
Damn! I'm just next to a river so doesn't really matter, Seneca rocks I've read is a bitch to set up and get the spawn-in working, that's a real shame.
---
right here!  pretend u r on wasteland vacation (take pics of things that strike you as funny, odd, creepy etc).  just kinda walk around, get lost.
---
for caps, 1 cup/bottle/can etc = 1 cap.  so if u want to be super grindy (and/or "clean up the environment haha) pick up every piece of garbage and sell
---
*Plays despacito on snare drum*
---
It’s just a random legendary.
---
Seconded. Meat Week is over, time to take off the chef outfit.
---
I've not purchased the collectron but they might have edited something when they introduced it. I also get dumped way out in some bushes near the perimeter if not inside rocks :D
---
Ugh I always got rekt before I could pull it out and fire it. Hats off to you for mastering it lol.
---
I don't know what that is but I want 3 in different colours!
---
PC. Sorry because I would absolutely be up for it in good fun.
---
Yeah the video of my CAMP is here https://youtu.be/mgQqXXIH5S4 Used to spawn myself any people who came to shop inside the bedroom everytime. Then this last week myself an others all got stuck at the bottom.  I played around with it for 2 hours trying to get it working again. Changed severs an tried so much stuff nothing worked.
---
Yeah I hear you took Poseidon workshop about a month ago from another player and he completely melted down and dropped every gay epithet possible over his mic and then send me a bunch of nasty messages.  Then followed me across the map only for me to kill him a few more times before getting on the mic myself to tell him to take a Xanax. 
---
I’ve been straight up ganked more times than I can count in this game and been killed plenty in PvP but damn people get over yourselves.  Yelling and screaming alrighty then just don’t go and kick your dog.  Have a drink or a smoke or don’t play.
---
What you did there - I see it.
---
As I understand it, it's simply the random Legendary 3\* weapon option costing 60 scrip.
---
they still havent fixed it an dprobably never will since fast travel is possible and they dont care about ''minor issues with it'
---
Where you can not initiate trades
---
What do you do if you don't want people stealing your stuff AND you don't want involuntary PvP?  Lose the mutation?  That feels like a lot of mental gymnastics to avoid saying this is not intended.
---
forest scout mask drops from savage divide events? i've been grinding enclave events all over the map trying to get one. also, i know those outfits drop from savage divide, but they've been all dropping at once, correct?
---
It's (slightly) similar to the smoker/non-smoker argument.  
---
Those of us that go around *not* smoking/pvping, doesn't effect you smoking/pvping with other people that want to smoke/pvp with you.  
---
But going around blowing smoke/bullets into my eyes, when i don't somebody to blow smoke/bullets into my eyes, *does* cut in to my enjoyment of the game.  
---
Hopefully "Hunter/Hunted" should spring to life now that there are established heavy hitters.
---
and what did that sweet temptress give you?!!!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_random_encounters
---
here they are with the types of event that can be found at each of the random encounters
---
Sounds fun!
---
Cookin’ chems?
---
That’s convienent to have and meat week is still going. Is there an end to it?
---
That's called a rad storm m8.
---
It's a rad storm, a kind of radioactive 'rain' that does a small amount of rad damage
---
I appreciate your thoughtful answer, thanks.
---
And I do agree with that Fallout 5 statement; 99% of players (included me) would absolutely rather played new fleshed-out single player experience. Well, Outer Worlds is just around the corner, so there's that.
---
Radiation storm
---
It is pretty rad, I’ll admit.
---
Nope.
---
possibility of halloween themed PA skins?? cause id use that
---
Accosted?   Don’t be so dramatic. 
---
There’s no rule that says you have to respond.  You can walk away (or they will get bored and walk away) or server hop.  Or fight back.  It’s your choice.
---
Still an issue then but thanks!
---
This is incredible! I bet this place looks awesome in the am!
---
Havent heard that in a while lol
---
I wish they'd add sheet music around the world and when you put it in your piano thats the song all instruments in your camp will play,
---
Outer Worlds! I cant wait man. Ive been watching the gameplay videos and im stoked.
---
That it is lol. But dont worry bout em. They're not too common and they won't kill you unless you're at like 5 hp and full of rads already
---
maybe she's overstocked on drills....
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure that buzz blade guy didn’t play much survival if he did he probably got killed routinely.
---
This is good advice.  I hope this spreads.  Losing money to the "cap cap" makes me a sad mothman.
---
I have a TSE flamer and it behaves very oddly. The flames normally have a limited range but the explosive “projectiles” don’t, so you can effectively engage enemies from rifle distances. Also due to the normal high rate of fire, the explosive flames/projectiles/whatever they are spit out super fast and lay on a lot of damage very quickly. It’s not bugged because it does work, but it’s pretty weird and breaks super fast but is really fun to use
---
Makes you wonder of some of these people have jobs. 
---
I see people in the 300s regularly.  And I always think to myself  Is this the only game they play. 
---
But people in the 800s to 1000s, I cant imagine that these people are employed.
---
I get you. Trick or treating isn’t the highlight for me, either. I basically just use the Halloween season as a hook to hang lots of my fave activities off... Finding and curating creepy collections of images, reading ghost stories, listening to supernatural podcasts, watching my many many horror films, creating costumes if there’s a party on the horizon (I bought a wedding dress one year because I fully commit to a spooky look!). I do a lot of this stuff year round but ramp it up to insane mode in October!
---
My wallet sure isn't winning.
---
See I just feel the opposite. It's a shame that penny pinching led to the removal of the only thing I really cared about in this game. It really made me love adventure mode and the pve content even more. Was really looking forward to wastelanders survival style. You think the game improves with the removal of survival but on my end it's like the game disappeared in front of my eyes.
---
Im not sure if its still going sorry, been offline for a few days
---
I generally think that having *something* about Mutant scale with the number of mutations makes sense.  Right now, it's a reliable, but completely forgettable prefix.
---
The thing about "full-life Unyielding" though is that Unyielding already doesn't require low health to get a +1 to SPECIAL.  This belief may be a holdover from Fallout 4, where it was a flat-out +3 below 25% HP.  In 76, it kicks in a lot earlier and ramps up.
---
It’s probably coming eventually, the roadmap for summer originally claimed legendary players would be coming and that got delayed. I’m assuming they’re just prioritizing some things over others and pushing stuff back.
---
It’s the best at night - worked on the lighting a lot, the shadows from the flame barrels look awesome on the doomsday clock.
---
I've seen a lvl 972 a couple of weeks back... i've heard talk about an XP glitch a while back so maybe that's how?
---
Requires lots (5) of plastic.. 1 cap is an ouch..
---
&gt; Be aware that most junk has to be bulked at a Tinkerer's Workbench to be sold to vendors. 
---
No, most scrap has to be bulked to be sold.  Junk (i.e. stuff you've not yet scrapped) can be sold as is.
---
I’ve never moved my camp yet I spawn randomly and so do visitors every time... 
---
I’ve rebuilt my entire camp with nothing saved and it does the same thing. 
---
Maybe it works for others but it’s literally never worked for me.
---
You can get a plasma rifle with the flamer barrel.  I found a 1 star furious version of it and added the flamer barrel.  It's an ammo hog but it seriously melts!!!!  The nice thing about the gun is that it gets bonuses from the standard rifleman skills.  It breaks pretty fast and uses tons of ammo so I really only use it against the SBQ, Imposter, and Sheepsquatch.
---
If they're wanted and the other person isn't in pacifist it does work. Just happened last night to me.
---
I guess that makes us a movement! My main has the witch plans, and I already give that outfit away for free year-round when cool people visit my camp, so I’ll do more of that when I log on as her.
---
She can drill me if she wants... just saying.. y'know.. throwing it out there.. could do worse..
---
Best ballistic weapon I have for the SBQ is resolute veteran, followed by AA LMG.  The only perk I have for heavies is Stabilized3, and I generally do not use food, bobbleheads, etc for damage boost.
---
Honestly the perks at low levels are awful, least for my build. I restarted a new character who's level 40 now and I'm basically waiting til after 50 to be able to plan my guy out since my main is bloodied and my new one is gonna be vanguard
---
spoken like a PVP'er....
---
To be fair anything they do will add in new bugs and exploits.
---
What did your 60 randomness of scrip get you ??? I must know!!!!!!!
---
You can convert it to a Prime Automatic Handmade... you’ll go through a ton of ammo and have hours of fun farming material to make ammo...lol
---
Yeah but a wanted person is already open to hostilities. It used to trigger for everyone before, which they fixed.
---
I see what you’re trying to say but I’m sure you know thats not exactly the same.
---
Pacifist mode from what I understand disables PvP for a player. Is not being directly effected by another portion of the community not enough? 
---
There is for sure some conflict going on, but that’s something that will happen anywhere, are you sure what we need is separation of the community and not some common ground/understanding on all sides?
---
Edit: I would love more people playing hunter/hunted. It feels like I can barely get one game going, let alone 5 for the challenges.
---
Steal your stuff, like, what?
---
That's a dope idea
---
It's in the junk tab and OP seems new. You're correct on the terminology, I was just trying to make it easy.
---
I'm level 71 and I've been playing since beta!
---
I never understand this. Every now and then I'll have someone run up to me and initiate trade and attempt to buy my main weapon. Then they get all shitty when i decline. If i didn't want the weapon it'd be in my machine. Not sure how often this ever works out for them. Unless I'm on my way back to camp i never carry anything i don't need.
---
Probably not. Its 317 solid days so..... I’m guessing nope.
---
I can only imagine. I love camps like these that sort of sit right on the water. They really look cool to me.
---
if you dont mind some constructive criticism, i would swap out bullet shield for lock and load, you get more DPS that way.  Depending on if you plan on raiding I would take out fire in the hole and switch with exterminator. 
---
I would take out Slow metabolizer and dromedary, for fireproof because it seems like you are using explosives, maybe put the endurance points somewhere else. 
---
 
---
I assume you are going solo, but if you ever decide to go in a group, stranger in numbers is great, maybe include tenderizer anyways.    
---
You don't need portable power, i dont know how many sets of power armor you have, but even if you have multiple sets, all the pieces should be on a chassis.
---
ammosmith is good, but you dont want it on your bar when you are exploring, born survivor can easily be replaced with a mod on your PA so right now the point is being wasted.  I suggest either putting on point into adrenaline or investing all 5 points, either go 1 or 5 points.   
---
I would also take out good with salt, having food spoil slowly is nice but getting starched genes and class freak even better.  If you can, adding bloody mess will increase your dps as well.
---
Beggars can’t be choosers in the wasteland!
---
In adventure mode.. Hell ya.. In any type of competive setting... I would suspect that console players would suspect everyone of cheating. 
---
Tbh i can't imagine playing a fps and fumbling around with menus and no hotkeys.
---
Yea, that's correct I think its about +1 at 50% +2 down to 20% and +3 below 20, give or take a few HP
---
Questioning + Guessing = quessing
---
At this point its no buggyer then skyrim
---
I second this if you are willing to expend the ammo. I found it fun for a couple SBQ events but eventually the ammo killed my resources and I had to give it up.
---
You can make ammo out of it. 
---
Money&gt;Cloth+Acid=Gunpowder
---
Heavy gunner without a minimum of damage reductions? yikes
---
Lone wanderer is must have for any build, of course if you're not in a team. Dodgy also is great to have with heavy guns because you don't make use of your AP otherwise.
---
Fireproof is a good perk, not very necessary if using the above 2 damage reduction perks. But it helps to avoid killing yourself with things like explosive harpoons.
---
Exterminator 1 and Glow sight 2 is more than enough, save your points.
---
Aquaboy in Power Armor? Another wasted point. Radicool best alternative, good doggy if eating dog food, cola nut if you want more AP from cherry/quantum, but it's mostly used in pvp to avoid burst damage along with Dodgy
---
Power User is wasted points if you don't use a gatling laser.
---
In the end, what is "OP" about this? Heavy gun builds are very basic.
---
I just dont pay much attention i get caught up in the moment.
---
may i ask why aquaboy/girl? PA lets you breath underwater and there isnt a lot of water in Fo76 anyways
---
Kudos to you, its nice to hear about people who are passionate in their hobbies.   
---
If you are on PS4 I'm pretty sure i have some halloween costumes if you'd like em (although im kinda thinking you have them all already)
---
PSN SlyOwlbeard  
---
Anyways, I hope you have a fangtastic spooktober!  🖤
---
This
---
BFFR 50 cal melts her face pretty good. I assumed the OP wanted to stick with rifles even though they said they were willing to do some perk swaps.
---
Alright so I've checked the Brotherhood Vendor in WS (Shop called Creekside Lodge) on 3 servers. I even checked and re-checked every other vendor in WS. While they indeed sell T60 plans, he's not selling Ultracite Plans nor Mods. The Vendor doesn't have any Mods for sale whatsoever. Am I doing something wrong?
---
I've heard plenty of apples to oranges arguments about pvp in this game but this is like.. apples to beachballs. PvP is an intended part of this game. It doesn't make you a bad person to partake in it, or to try and goad someone else into it. How ever blowing smoke into your eyes is probably illegal.
---
Should be the very opposite... 50% damage increase if NOT mutated. 
---
That would make life more interesting.
---
I still wouldn't mind between ps4 and xbox because they both basically have the same controls except ps4 is slightly less comfortable but has better menu navigation because of the weird touch pad thingy
---
always stay well rested for the extra xp. quests, events &amp; dailies will give you nice xp so do those if you want to level up quickly. killing super mutants is a good source of xp as well.
---
I actually like this idea, it would put more Plans in my shop to beable to sell and they should also make it so you can place items on the shelves that dont have the hotkey to do it like the display cases.
---
And to solve the atomic issue they could simply put differect junk bundles in the atomic shop.
---
The plan is sold at Watoga Shopping Plaza on Pheonix. If you're trying to get them to scrap for mods it's easiest to build them. It's like 950 caps hard bargin 3+5 charisma
---
Yeah it drives me insane had it working (I think) briefly was able to one shot few level 60 enemies but then straight back to three shots to put them down.
---
Just drives you mad when you get swarmed have to use triple the amount of ammo and end up with broken armour from it 😂
---
Yeah, I feel that will be a big indicator on the future success of the game
---
Anyone over 300 i would say is suspicious for cheating xp exploits. I got to lvl200 or so on my main character back when Ghouls at whitesprings gave 600 exp a pop and you could reset spawns by having someone leave team and re-log. Nowadays its very hard to level up. I hardly level more then 2 times a day and thats grinding Queen runs and farming the enemies. 
---
All i hope is when "legendary perks" become a thing. That all the people who exploited exp get those levels removed or else they all will be at an unfair advantage. Since you get a legendary perk for every 50 levels past 50, you can see where this could potentially be a problem. 
---
I hope Bethesda has a log for how you obtained your exp because it would be easy to see who expoited exp. Its either 2 cases, 1 you have thousands of trap disarms or you have thousands of 1 particular event completed (the 2 exp glitches i know of).
---
I'm 122 after 2 months, but dang..
---
I use it very sparingly.  I always buy the plasma cartridges when I see them for sale a player vendors......but you are right it burns through ammo insanely fast!
---
Hunting rifles and shotguns are mostly used for early game because of how available they are.  I'm kinda a sneaky sniper so having a buff to the hunting rifle would be nice, the ammo capacity sucks as well.  The standard is 5 shots and the max is 7, you would think a large magazine would be at least 9 or 10
---
Definitely good 1 hit damage here but does your longer term sustained DPS touch that of a handmade? 
---
Don't take my comment the wrong way there is nothing wrong with wanting to punch her slowly with a gauss. I do the same with a bloodied lever for my own amusement as long as there is decent DPS around me.
---
Hmm if that's the case it wouldn't be "Mutant's" It would have to be called "puriists" or something. But that is a cool idea. Would be a good reason to avoid mutations, I like it.
---
Mutants should benefit from being mutated
---
Anything with a scorched pre-fix excluding Scorchbeasts.
---
I use a primed zealots handmade and it does the trick.  Especially if you can mop up the mobs with +% on death effects.
---
The instance should be free with in-game stuff (caps), but fine with "nicer" skins in the store. Base items should be added to the game.
---
Yep my mains doing this, also have discount on fasnacht masks.
---
Fluffy.
---
PC friends spotted a 900+
---
Some guy made a thing showing how the meat hook does the most damage in the game.  I also believe with the right mods the pipe revolver or pipe bolt action can double dip as well
---
Honestly tho. Why does anyone need a PSA saying "watch out for high places"?
---
Except on launchers... After many survival tests 2 shot fat man counts as 2 hits thus killing or almost killing a player instantly. I suspect it's the same for missiles.
---
And no... Not even fire proof 3 will save you. At demo 5 damage was over 3500. You're boned.
---
I'd recommend getting yourself a heavy gun like a bloodied explosive. 50 cal my one does 180 headshot damage and 220 headshot critical damage per bullet with the appropriate perks and mutations of course. If you want a queen killer that's your best bet.
---
Its exp expoiting. Disarm bug or the quest bug. Both have been patched but its dissapointing these players get to keep there exp.
---
Pistols could use a 400% buff. All guns could use at least 50% buff. Unless you’re bloodied... it’s so unfortunate that the game forces bloodied for good damage output.
---
No and yes
---
Ultracite Power Armor is currently glitched. You can add a Jetpack to a limb. The Jetpack will be fully functional, and appears to be strapped to the Chestpiece as usual. This means you can still add another mod to the Chestpiece (emergency protocols for example).
---
Thats not true. They do trigger pvp if that player has a bounty. It doesnt if the player is just attacking you trying to start something.
---
Earnable in game would be even more excellent... I’ll keep dreaming.
---
I play fully automatic, I recommend  that. Tank killer also works with fully auto and semi
---
I don't want to eat.
---
Ahh...didn't know this was a possibility. Thanks for the info
---
Auto unless you have 50% limb damage.
---
Awww, that’s mighty kind, thank you. But as you’d expect of a ghoul like me, I server hopped for days to find that elusive witch costume, and I paid a fine sum for the skeleton costume plan only last week. I had never seen either on sale before that. But I will add you, as I’m on PS4 and it’s always nice to know nice people. I am new to the social side of gaming, so this is a whole new world for me. 🖤
---
I know exactly what you mean. 
---
Here’s something you can try that, for me, mimics that intensity, somewhat. Turn off the HUD. All the way.
---
Sadly I agree with everything you have said here. Not sure if they have two code branches or if it is just a toggle but either way, getting their upcoming changes to work with survival which has such a low number of players is not cost efficient. 
---
When you take all the other BS out of the air, this is all there is to it.
---
"With the exception of Scorchbeasts, any enemies with “Scorched” in their names count toward progress. You can keep an eye on how the challenge is going and catch a preview of the rewards by visiting the Project Clean Appalachia event page. Good luck!"
---
Not done the maths. Base guns from what i see written down... Gauss has higher dps than h/m... but calculations need to factor in reload times and sustained fire rather than what each could do in just 1second.
---
 Either way the critical damage factor should also be factored in... and whatever % of peanuts is still peanuts.... whatever % of gauss damage.... that is not to be sniffed at.
---
Correct.
---
With the exception of Scorchbeasts, any enemies with “Scorched” in their names count toward progress. You can keep an eye on how the challenge is going and catch a preview of the rewards by visiting the Project Clean Appalachia event page. Good luck!
---
My rarest encounter was a town full of Behemoths and 1 Behemoth that was a 3 star legendary. It was awesome.
---
Last thing we need is PC cheaters.
---
Stop messing around and do some work. 
---
Your manager. 
---
(just kidding, I'm at work as well)
---
Because its not uranium. Most of the fissile material is scattered a few miles around the blast area but the majority of the radioactive material is ionized minerals at ground zero, which usually has a very short half life.
---
True which is why it doesn’t bother me much lol
---
60 scrip for a random legendary is pretty great. If you get a weapon thats 60buy:40return ratio. So you could keep flipping.
---
Dude. Not funny. My manager is called Sticking Toaster and I thought it was really her :(
---
Bwhahaha pml
---
I’m new to trading and it’s happened the last 2 times I’ve traded. Lucky for me the other players were experienced traders and told me why I couldn’t trade.
---
Auto is better, but I keep one handy as a semi-auto if I’m using rifleman perks and and my stealth is broken trying to snipe.
---
Ban hammer!
---
It's just not the same as open world PvP. Match based PVP is like playing a sports ball game together, while survival mode was kicking the sports ball around and messing around with your buds. Both are similar activities but they serve different purposes and have different goals. And are satisfying for their own reasons.
---
Yep.  I usually take my BE prime auto handmade with me and also Last Action Hero (50 cal).  Have also done AAE Gatling Plasma but breaks down much quicker than the other two.
---
She doesn't have any option for a random Legendary right now. Hmm..
---
Wow, i didn't even know that you could get the plans, ive been grabbing the outifts. I will have to find those now.  
---
If you are interested in gaming with nice people, i would recommend checking out [www.reddit.com/r/PKOA/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKOA/) \- its a friendly group from all over. We generally just like helping people out and stopping any greifing / bullying we encounter.   
---
Great bunch if you need help with a quest or finding something, and they fight the SBQ a few times a day
---
I love Monster Mash personally. Sadly I find myself playing alone most of the time.
---
 it's sweet as!! Now what did my future wife give you?
---
I don’t. I can annoy griefers now and it’s hilarious.
---
those are the 2 weapons i use lol
---
Even smokers get designated smoking areas away from people who don't want to be near it. If only fallout had something similar...
---
This, I feel like I’m walking on thin ice just revealing that I enjoy the PvP in this game.
---
 This one from the 50s of the last century: "If you don't play a sport, be one." ;)
---
All I wanted to do was find a good place for my C. A. M. P.
---
Automatic with FFR
---
Lol why a ban hammer?
---
Cool thanks. I was playing semi auto, but wasn't doing to well. Even with all commandos upgraded as well as the tank killer.
---
I been here since first day of beta. At this moment my hours played are 2579 and main characters are 113 and 420 (blaze it). I play a lot, but I don't grind for the levels, nor have I exploited any leveling glitches.
---
If you can compare hours to levels, that should answer the question of leveling glitches.
---
I just logged on thinking it had started but it hasn’t.
---
Interesting. I'll have to check it out.
---
thanks for posting this as i cant access the official site posts at work!
---
I know exactly what you said, and what I wrote, you still sound dumb making assumption without facts. 
---
That was all, bye
---
If i have to put the slightest effert into entering a vender camp i turn right around and leave. Not worth my time.
---
Save your breathe. I got about -50 downvotes for saying you can do this to initiate pvp.
---
Here is resolution from Bethesda:
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/30199/~/what-do-i-do-if-i-get-error-code-ce-34878-0-when-trying-to-play-fallout-4%3F
---
And if someone out guns me in PvP I just nuke their camp if I can find it to make them leave the server hopefully.
---
Certainly not something to be sniffed at. Seeing those high damage numbers on her gives me the giggles for sure.
---
Ah, alrighty. I saw Primal Cuts pop up afew times.
---
It means 'elite'
---
Great picture! This reminds me that I wish we would get a unique event for halloween, seems like the perfect holiday for a seasonal event
---
ima run around naked and say im invisible
---
 Dude... that's harsh... at least break it to me gently... 
---
y'know... ask me to sit down... get a cup of tea... and tell me a long story that parallels reality....
---
water is the most common. extractor output is also common.
---
Thats my lead, buddy. hands off.
---
Yeah it's dumb, what's worst they get all defensive when you called them out. Lol
---
Anyways you can look at your in game time, go to challenges, and the characters I think it's some where in there it tell you xxx off 7600 hours played.
---
I enjoy the community events, but am a tad bit sad they didn't put together a Halloween themed event for us this year.
---
It’s a little annoying to die and lose your nerd rage if you run Bloodied.
---
Betterment of the community
---
Perfect! You are my kind of people. And in the meantime, while you're scouring the wastes for the plans, I'd be happy to craft you as many costumes as you need for free. The witch trick or treater is one of many random spawns that happens on the road near Crevasse Dam (on the 65 road marker sign). Also, I got the plan for the civil war era suit in New Gad recently, too, which I didn't know existed. That is my go-to outfit with a bowler hat and gaunt eyes/damaged face! Good luck, and see you out there.
---
I did one early this morning
---
Just no. No. Cant. No. Need a minute alone now...
---
I get garbage every time so I stopped doing it.
---
Who said that??
---
This isnt a single player game.  If your fun comes at the expense of someone else's that is most definately being a dick.  Defending that behavior is also questionable.  These are things you should have learned when you were like 5 years old.  Nobody likes a bully.
---
In the top left it says location accessible at a later date.... ???
---
Limb damage works well in semi because 1 shot is usually and instant cripple. Don’t need to spit a bunch of lead when they are crawling at you.
---
Thats a very generous offer, you definately sound like one of our kind of people :D  
---
I'd actually already looked it up and im heading there now   
---
See you in the wastes
---
Hehe you sound like me.
---
Uh, they mention a new mischief filled event.  Maybe that's it.
---
&gt; Stay tuned for more details on what’s in store with the patch, including a mischief-filled new Seasonal Event. 
---
Did you miss that part?
---
Goddamn sleepers. I wish there was ankle armor.
---
A Halloween event called Mischief Week that's currently in the files is what the last sentence is referring to.
---
I have a quad auto FFR - I leave my heavy weapons at home now.
---
Whenever someone tries to attack me I like to put spoiled meat in a bag with a You Have Been Insulted note and do the gift emote. Then do the thumbs up emote when they grab it. I still want the flip off emote so I can do that after they grab the bag instead of thumbs up.
---
Sometimes the location bugs out like that. So does Lowe's taxidermy. Server hopping normally fixes it.
---
Would that be the "including a mischief-filled new Seasonal Event" they referenced?
---
Omg that guy was so mad! The rage was palpable haha
---
Those things are terrifying!  I'm high enough level that not much makes me scared anymore, but one (or more) of those sliding toward me make me panic and start swinging wildly until I settle enough to VATS them into their final death.  lol
---
I don't see why I would bother with the mystery pick event when a 25% or 50% off event is coming up later.
---
Yeah exactly. I usually keep 15-20 stashed away and if I don’t have enough to sell to get daily caps I’ll just sell 1 or 2 to reach it. Even if you pay some crazy price for flux like some people sell for you can at least double your caps usually. It’s just as good as caps to have around :)
---
I mean, i implied ties only between consoles. Should've been more clear
---
Mystery Pick hasnt started yet. 15 mins to go i believe. They said 12est.
---
Hmm interesting. I'll have to take a look at it. Maybe I'll start setting up a sneak build with it.
---
Auto uses less vats cost than single and only does slightly less damage per shot. Damage per second is way higher with auto tho
---
I just found Nicholson's End, somehow I've never been down there.
---
Sure, I'm glad for the input. I already made the decision to switch out Portable Power and Ammosmith so I agree with you on those definitely. Planning on switching Portable out for Batteries Included as I use a lot of energy ammo. Probably gonna stick White Knight in there instead of Ammosmith, or maybe go with the Adrenaline suggestion.
---
I did have Lock and Load in my original build, but I've been finding Bullet Shield a lot more useful. That +60 damage res comes in handy when I plant myself and unload my 50 Cal into a SB's face.
---
I don't really bother with Exterminator because I have a 3\* Exterminator's Grognak Axe, and that cuts through insects like butter. I like Fire in the Hole because it gives me more accuracy and distance with grenades, and because I don't really use ranged weapons it's a good way to get a good amount of damage in before they know I'm there. Plus I like to keep a Perception of at least 3 so I can switch over to the Picklock perks on the fly when I need to.
---
I agree on Born Survivor, I just don't have the PA mod yet so I was using that in its place. As soon as I get the mod installed I'll be ditching that one too. Adrenaline does seem like the best replacement.
---
I'm not really big on mutations so not sure Starched or Class Freak would be good for my playstyle, although you have a point with Bloody Mess. Only reason I went for Good With Salt is because I carry Ribeye's for when I need to increase my carry weight, but sometimes they end up spoiling too quickly.
---
You've definitely given me a few things to think about though, so thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.
---
But 3* legendary armor is already 60 scrip so the only benefit is that you might get a 3* weapon for 60 instead of 100? 
---
No thanks, I’d rather have 25% off armor (as that’s what I need) or 50% off either
---
Survival rejects, haha.
---
I only don't know my hours because I try not to look, lol.
---
I can't work, so depending on a bunch of health junk, I'm usually playing like it's my job (vending added purpose to my life, pathetic or not to say it) or I'm barely adding time over the course of a week.
---
Why would a scorchbeast not count?
---
Yeah it seems to do nothing. I'm going to swap it for motion assist servo for the extra carry weight
---
XB and PS cross play would be a great thing.
---
PC? Meh.
---
I don't like the idea of it being a plan you need to find but I could live with it being an atomic shop thing, so long as it was a bundle of say 5 items for 200 atoms. It would make it more likely that they would actually do it if there was some gain for Bethesda.
---
This.  It's happened to me on more than one occasion.
---
Hop servers and it should work
---
This sounds awesome! I've been wearing the witch hat and I'm gonna try to trigger the clothing plans today. Hopefully I can snag them
---
I always thought more open world games should utilize a base on base capture the flag style pvp. It’s the most exhilarating lol.
---
I wish we could have perk limit increased. The builds change and how they effect pvp isnt easy. I change builds a lot to find the most effective pvp build. I cant seem to find a full proof build. I have top armor and mutations and still getting 2 tapped with automatic weapons. Lol.
---
I swear adventure mode just got filled with those fucks had a guy just dropping nuke mines getting people who were trading with grahm irradiated sucks that he was targeting low levels at the meat cook, that event is always filled with shitheads trying to start a fight it’s like going to a bar in Boston
---
You doing Whitby goth fest?
---
Sorry I missed it, thanks for the great news! I am pleasantly surprised!
---
Commando is the full auto set of cards. You should have been Rifleman for semi auto
---
Hey man, I feel you when I first saw I was over 500 hours I kind off wanted too 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮, but hey I do enjoy the game, even tho at times it gets frustrating as hell lmao.
---
Well, some of us are being accused of not having a life, whitch may be true, but I have one character on ~200 from beta days and forward, my current is 373. In my group of friends we all have well over 500 levels (all characters). None of us has ever used an xp exploit, but we do like to grind the game. One in the group finds it intresting to run up new characters and has done so ten times now, it takes him about ten hours, I think, to get to lvl 50. This includes doing the Tadpole to get the backpacks. It's not that hard to level up, just takes some dedication and love for the game.
---
I do see what you mean by the legendary effects and exploits, but to say that evryone that is more than this or that level has used an exploit is ignorant at best.
---
We need another version of survival, more like those immersive mods in Fallout 4. No legendaries, no legacy, no swapping special or perk cards and exclusive for a new character. Fallout was Made for the real immersive experience.
---
You also do more damage on your next hit after blocking 👍🏻
---
You don't vats with a Tesla.....
---
I probably am rifleman. I'm at work so I'm not looking at my build right now.
---
Personally they just need to balance the risk vs reward for survival, and it'll be perfect. Make safe zones, so you can't camp spawns, and lower the amount of aid dropped. Maybe make a few survival mode passives that can be unlocked without the need of a stat slot that makes it a bit more rewarding to fo pvp, and it'll be gold.
---
&gt; What they save running survival, they'll spend on the instances for Wastelanders.
---
Now there's an interesting take that I had not looked at for wastelanders. I've been in agreement since the announcement that the development and release of wastelanders is the primary drive behind removing survival at this time, but never had I considered that wastelanders itself will be its own game mode. 
---
Interesting....
---
That event is so good. Plus on a real lucky day you can get an all rise player in there...
---
Can I wear the cultist gear as well? It's still pretty spooky
---
I really wish there was an event to go along with Halloween, too. For now I'll just stick to the Pumpkin House and those creepy *haunted* cabins where you hear the lady scream
---
The Mire
---
Just South of Berkeley Springs, there is a train station there.
---
You need to raise not lower the amout of drops. Maybe ammo.
---
Yeah, they said at....Quakecon I think? That they planned to have Halloween and Christmas events, alongside earlier events like Meat Week and Fachnact returning.
---
Yes i run bloodied always wirh less than 20% health, the dmg of the explosive is not much its like 150
---
So is 1337, like start of the internet old.
---
But the armor is already 60 script. What's the deal ?
---
Powerful automatic, unless it is an instigating one.
---
ask Beth.
---
Oh cool thanks didn't know that!
---
Really should be marked differently on the map
---
150 scrip per day is less then 7 days to max. You don't have to be at max but it's also not hard to do.
---
If your time is limited to weekend then maybe save but otherwise why not?
---
I tried setting up a group for the event but nobody bit. Since it cant be triggered anymore and the spawn for it is so rare, it's difficult to assemble a group. Unless you run with a group everytime you play. Which I don't. Honestly I started just bugging everyone at the primal cuts and cook out events.
---
It really has. 
---
What is the reason for survival going I haven’t really read anything explaining it
---
Run through Westec killing hoards of super mutants. Various dayly quests, especially since they give you legendary currency now. Running around the map getting plans and unlocking tier 3 safes for my camp to sell. Killing the queen and running around nuke zones. Go back through low level areas reading lore or searching things that may have been missed while easily killing everything in sight. Take workshops and kill other players for a bit of PvP or help new players build their first good set of combat armor. Not to mention all the super rare outfits that add a unique level of roleplay but take forever to obtain making them a constant thing to work towards. I could go on and on, but essentially end game is a sandbox to play in like most Fallout games. Choose what you want and have fun.
---
But Scorchbeasts don't have "Scorched" in their names... :-/
---
can you craft me a shielded raider leathers? ill give you the materials and some caps. my GT is tubus lobus
---
Sounds like a good haul. That event is always great for legendary ghouls and is one of my favorites to do. 
---
However, I have run into people who scream over voice when you kill them as if there is some sort of pre-understanding that the PvP event should not include PvP. 
---
I try to be friendly and press pause on the pvp when somebody calls out a legendary but yeah, everybody plays by their own rules.
---
Prime Furious LMG.
---
I don't think it's good to remove survival, it gave somewhere for the pvp guys to let rip, all they're going to get on the pve servers is foul language.
---
My most interesting build was a quality of life build. Invest on those secondary perks. Get 15 intelligence and walk the Wasteland. Nothing like optimal ammo, food, weapons and armor without switching perks.
---
But it's a train station by Berkeley
---
The party don’t stop man cookout at my spot 6pm music wolf ribs and plenty of nukashine
---
That's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
I had an explosive level action but I eventually stopped using it, solely because it seemed like I would immediately go from hidden to danger after the first shot, no matter the range. That was a patch or two ago though, so it could have just been a weird glitch
---
Strange... I'm going to try again today and see if I get the same message
---
You know his controller has eroded ditches in the plastic from his palm sweat.
---
So are mystery picks supposed to be live now?
---
i dont think white knight works with PA, so i would double check before you invest points into that.  If carry weight is an issue, excavator armor gives a +100 bonus if you wear everything, you can add an extra +100 if you have calibrated shocks too.  You also can find someone online to do the mods for you if you dont have the plans
---
Good, cause you are going to need the carry weight for ammo!
---
Apparently there is! I was wrong there is an event!
---
I have done Monster Mash about 10 times and only had another player in there once and we cooperated with no PvP.  Just harvesting Legendaries.
---
Custom sheet music like how Maplestory 2 had it with the ability to sync up with other players would be superb.
---
Give amplified versions of Well-Tuned for groups that sync up and play together.
---
Man the news just gets better and better, pardon my ignorance on the topic
---
Once you get good weapons and start farming more legendary weapons you level like crazy without even trying.
---
Highest I ever saw was 901. I was walking along, minding my business (when put of an orange coloured skyyyyy), and found him at his camp, fixing his gear. Took a picture and thought to myself that this person either doesn't have any alts, or doesn't have any time for anything else...
---
Always found it faster to target and re target myself. But some people love it amd it does offer a damage bonus.
---
I don't know that robot companions were ever announced.  People just speculated because the image had a robot and a person but who knows what that might be alluding to.
---
No one wanted to play survival because of the drops, and the farmers that would take all their shit, so raising it would only make it worse. I run in two large groups of about 2k+ pvpers, and we all agree that if they lowered it just a bit, and then made it so you couldn't be killed during a loading screen, survival would have been perfect. I'm not saying take away the drops, but lower it just enough that you might have a chance to get your shit back by the end of the session. This isn't Rust, you don't need to lose everything every 2 mins. Not to mention if you dropped ammo, people would just do what I do, and play a stealth melee build. I got tired of making ammo, and hauling it around, so I went for stealth melee, and even in raids, and queen fights I hold my own, and the meta would just adapt to need less ammo.
---
Mine works fine with my Bloodied FF Handmade on my main. My heavy guns alt isnt high enough level yet to test it out.
---
We sometimes drive out for the day to people watch, as I'm in Yorkshire anyways. I love it! The first time I went was by accident - I didn't even know that the goth fest was a thing, and as I stepped out of the car a woman in a full, black Victorian wedding/mourning dress and top hat passed by me by on the pavement. I thought she was the coolest thing ever. Then we saw lots more weird and wonderful looking people and discovered that there was an event going on. We were secretly disappointed as we really liked the idea that Whitby's actual population was 80% goth! But I love that the goth fest happens there. And I love the Dracula lore. And I love that it has an actual hand of glory in its museum. We were there a few weekends ago and there was a traditional morris dancing festival happening. It was full on Wicker Man. Amazing.

The best are all the downvotes.  Stay off my lawn!!
---
I thought so.  I'm not seeing it at this moment though, also checked on different characters &amp; different servers.
---
EDIT- I see it available now @ around 12:40, I was changing servers so try that if you still don't see it.
---
There's no indicator showing that it's the purveyor though. It should have it's own icon.
---
Where in Yorkshire you based?
---
Mostly so you don't annoy yourself as well? Defeats the purpose if you make YOURSELF crazy!
---
By no one you mean adventure players who called for nerf after nerf then still didnt play? Fuck those guys. They just didn't like pvp in thier game. You got hoarding problems if your worried about over abundant virtual loot.
---
Can you explain what you mean please?   I don't understand the reference to  an All Rise player.  BTW I just scraped my All Rise.  Using a 73dmg Combat Knife for PA melee, prefer the speed.
---
I just checked nukesdragon and there's nothing on the WK card that says no PA. Will double check it when I'm on the game to be sure though.
---
They just very recently stated. Modern Warfare was a testing ground for crossplay throughout all games on both Xbox and PlayStation. 76 will most likely be there too

No, probably not. There are usually super empty servers and ive only ever had server side issues twice in my few hundred hours of playtime. It all happened near launch aswell, of course the game isnt perfect but it could most definitely handle this.
---
What flux is needed for prime 5.56?
---
I feel the same way on my rifle builds but with this being a minigun and Bloodied that just doesn't work. If I could keep it spinning and let Gun Fu switch targets this thing would be a god roll. As of right now it is just another "this would have been a good drop if it were explosive".
---
Hopefully Wastelanders introduces some variety to this game. I'm burnt out on chasing the bloodied explosive cheese.
---
Could not agree with you more. I've now received the PVP brand here on reddit and I get down voted regardless of what I say on the subject. It has been the same story in every game I have played. I've mentioned Star Wars Galaxies in other posts, you should have seen the PVP vs PVE forum wars there. 
---
Yet, find me in adventure and you'd never know I was up for PVP unless you saw me deal with a griefer or fight over a workshop.
---
The irony with workshops is I won't even contest it if somebody is actually using it. It's the empty ones with nothing built that I go after, or ones that have recently been taken from somebody else.
---
Oooh, good luck. And if you don't get her right away at least you'll pick up a chunk of XP from the random spawns. One of which is a sheepsquatch, so beware the mysterious quills!
---
2 points in bandolier ;)
---
Must be a feature. 😂 I never play anything with my mouse and keyboard, so anything beyond just moving was unusually complex. I'm forcing my brain to send signals it has never sent before, and it makes my brain hurt! Just start punching keys and praying it works...
---
You're just stuck in your ways aren't you? It would help some people, and wouldn't hurt anyone. It would be a good idea to give it a unique icon, since it is a unique location.
---
That’s the biggest problem.  You get enough people in one spot of course some people will try to mix it up who are we kidding?  
---
I just get a kick out of the anti-PvP crowd and how sanctimonious some of them are.  The game wasn’t designed to offend your sensibilities but man some of the PvP outrage on this site is hilarious.
---
Clearly you should be playing Fortnight, I mean NW with the pvp you want. Not one of the guys I've run with have ever agreed with the nerfing shit btw. Most of us got pissed at how much shit was trashed because of people complaining, but here's the thing bud. It wasn't adventure players, because they loved op gear for npc fights, it was butthurt kids after they lost fights, and people being killed while loading in on survival that did most damage. And before you start in on the tse nerf, blame the damned dupers for that shit. So many people had them that Bethesda made a call. It was either ban everyone, or make them useless, then ban the next wave of dupers as they started to focus on the new meta.
---
I concur. I typically wear my witch hat all the time, but I've recently started wearing my trusty skeleton jumpsuit, as well. God, I love that thing.
---
50 levels? I must know, what level ARE you? 50 levels ago, I was level 12...
---
if you have 9 points into lets say riflemen for +60%, you can add 3 points into gunslinger for +30, replacing bloody mess if you have it
---
I use gun fu with melee and if I attack before switching targets it hits the new target as it switches. 
---
The animation can't keep up but things still die.
---
I think you are right about the spin up causing the problem.
---
Are you full auto?
---
Can you just hold the trigger and Gun Fu will switch or do you have to pause shooting while it switches?
---
I found that if I let off of the trigger right when my first target dies I can stay in Gun Fu but if I continue shooting it drops VATS and I just start dumping rounds.
---
Just tried. Got in with no problem
---
Awhile back they changed Vats to immediately close after killing an enemy. It was great except this ended up completely breaking Gun-fu. It would immediately close Vats and not switch targets. So their "fix" was to simply exclude Gun-fu users from the immediate close. It would be great if Gun-fu would switch targets as quickly as it would close without it, but programming is hard, apparently.
---
And that’s coming later
---
Na. More of a dayz kinda guy. Like death swift and. Only things you save is what you were smart enough to bury or hide.
---
lol sorry I was giving you a little flak but just for fun. It is still just a train station but maybe they could give it a different emblem. Should make a Reddit or Bethesda post suggesting that, might be a good idea
---
I didn't play until 2 months after release but I'm up to 265.   Granted, double XP, Nuke zones, and cycling Top of the World ( before the recent level caps) and now Westek helped.
---
Does it tho?
---
Hunting Rifle does only 5 less base damage than the lever action. If im not mistaken the fire rate in 3rd person is slower than it is in 1st so it could just be a result of that bug. A fix to that or a fire rate upgrade would work fine.
---
Hunting rifle has an AP mag, a plethora if easy to access mods, extremely cheap ammo with .50cal mod.
---
Yup, will wait for that
---
Because we're out there being badass in the godawful wasteland we find ourselves in, we want somewhere cozy. And not gross. I got so mad when I saw that new fridge with all the blood on it. That's just... ew.
---
It’s what I’m gonna wait for too
---
I said "Suspicious". It's not ignorant to say what ive said. A lot of people exploited exp bugs and thats fact.  I also have 5 characters, 1 lvl224, 1 lvl120 and 3 50-70. I know people like to grind. I got 1500 hours myself.
---
I think any attempt at a costume works, honestly. Mole costume, Mr. Fuzzy costume, spacesuit, etc!
---
Yes commando full auto. It just automatically switches after first target is dead I dont specifically hold it down constantly because everything dies in 3-4 bullets pretty much but I just hit vats once an I can kill everything without leaving vats. Stuff has to be in range for it to switch though or it will just drop.
---
I'm gonna save my scrip for the 50% off sale . Mystery pick is same price as 3* armor . Not enticing to me . I will slaughter some scorched though. It would be nice to turn off leveling up at some point if the player so chooses. Killing lots of enemies makes my level go up constantly. I quit sleeping forever ago , it's been just as long since the delicious flavor of cranberries has passed my lips. Seriously though, let the bodies hit the floor.
---
Don’t worry you will get downvoted into oblivion if you even suggest PvP has some place in this game.  
---
Just let me build pretty camps and collect and farm things and leave the killing and mayhem alone!  
---
If some had their way not only would they outlaw PvP I’m convinced some would get rid of enemies as well.
---
If you use your terminal there is
---
Does anyone know the price yet!?
---
It’s not how its supposed to be played at all. That’s using an unintended method (equipping broken armor) to benefit from stats. I play Berserker without armor and am quite effective. Berserker = no armor. That’s how it’s meant to be played.
---
Don't forget the trade failed on server one that makes the players inventory blank.
---
60 scrip for 3 star, but it isnt out yet
---
So go play that, and stop bitching about Fallout not being DayZ.
---
A clown suit and a hatchet (if your luck's like mine, it was level 5)... That IS unusual, and that kill would have taken FOREVER.
---
Heard it was more like 1k exp per kill
---
You mean it's the 3rd of Halloween
---
With egg head and maxed int and day-in added up to ~25 int gets you 400+exp at ammo factory.
---
I have 5 different characters I play on and off, my main is at 111 but my 2nd is at 87, 3rd is 65? The other two are relatively new so only lvl 20s. I've been playing since beta, so I have some hours invested.
---
My first thought was about the armor, too. That, and the fact that anything from the Purveyor is a mystery anyway!
---
Sounds like Nuclear Winter... but different in a good way ;-)
---
If you are looking for display items, take a look here:

---
Okay? Nothing looks different at Murmrgh? Am I missing something?
---
Probably went through 37 keyboards after he mashed the interact key on the myriad of glitched quests you could infinitely turn in.
---
But can you recreate sheer dumb luck? I find those things are usually one-off.
---
What do you mean? Learn to play? What is the right way to play this game? 
---
Do you want to repeat Whitesprings or West tek or Burrows 20 time in one day? No. Thank you. That is boring as hell. 
---
I like this game. I enjoy it since last year. I don't need power leveling. I'm busy with my new build now. I do not use any perk cards which increase damage output. I'm sure you belive it is stupid. That's my own version of survival. Game becomes more difficult and every encounter with enemies which are higher level than you is more challenging. 
---
I get down voted by peoples who use gliches and exploits and than sell things on eBay or Amazon. Nice. Lol
---
Animal sounds are worse in real life. A pig dying sounds like children.
---
I was walking along minding my business when love came and hit me in the eye (Flash, bam, alakazam) out of an orange colored sky
---
Ps4. No dev room for us.
---
Kinda fun to listen to people complain about stim packs tbh. 
---
The guys who were kicking your ass in survival were not concerned about these things. Improvise adapt and overcome. For example camping of stash boxes or vault 94 cause thats were people would flock. Figuring out ways to push it to the max so people rage over chat.... Mmmm sweet sweet sounds.
---
If this happened I could actually have a full group of people to play with.
---
Man I really need to remember to state the fact that I’m on Xbox. Nobody on Xbox has that plan. Kinda sucks
---
I just noticed it on the site. Didn't seem attached to any announcement, It's been there for months
---
That's my point
---
I've seen this as well but usually they fully load in a minute or two later.
---
Haha. Maybe one or two! I just have the one. Was the level 111 your lever action?
---
Nope, that's you being bad at the game.
---
That "unintended method" has been in this series for years 
---
The loss of 15 legendary effects for a measly 50% when you can get the same bonus with junkies is just stupid.
---
You went out of your way to be the worst build possible. Squishy with low damage, totally useless.
---
I've had 2 of those so far but no trick or treaters but as you say XP, so its all good :D
---
What a toddler.
---
Since I’ve never run heavy guns before, I noticed that the heavy gunner perk says “applies to non-explosive”. Does this mean that the perk does nothing to explosive heavy guns?
---
Yay, let's just repaste what we already know and call it news!
---
I did mine yesterday and got a lvl 50 3 star rifle perfect for my build. The candy rewards suck but go for the legendaries, not the candy.
---
Probably just cause that was the goal for the last 2 weeks
---
Going by the description, these people are more like the "wildus neckbeardus" type.
---
I bet that was a fight!
---
**Update - 12:40 pm ET:** Mystery Pick is now live!
---
~~There's been a slight delay, but we're working on getting the Mystery Pick event started now. Hang tight!~~
---
I've heard that Serendipity doesn't work in PA but can't confirm myself
---
~~Slight delay on this, we're working to get the Mystery Pick event enabled asap!~~
---
Also you have to have a good amount of AP to have it continue swapping. Are you watching the AP an running grim reapers? Also why are you using vats perks at all with a heavy guns build?
---
Yeha I totally get that, it comes down to play style too. I'd happily spend a few hours rebuilding my CAMP which would yield me like 0xp, whereas actually playing the game for that amount of time would probably get me ahead an extra couple of levels
---
What's you're int they could have nerfed it li str.
---
I jumped on the roof top of West Tek to test this. I can stand there in VATS and cycle through 5-6 Mutants. As soon as I start shooting it kills one Mutant.....breaks out of VATS and then I'm just shooting into the dirt.
---
If I time it in a similar way to bursts with an automatic rifle it will stay in Gun Fu, but this has major issues which makes it not viable. 
---
So disheartening because AP wise I can keep it going and it's popping crits every 2-3 shots making it an absolute beast for shredding mobs. I guess I'll put it in the stash with the rest of the hopefully one day they fix this but probably won't gear.
---
Listen, if we aren't all running around with skeleton outfits on with a witches hat, prisoner's collar, mistress of mayhem mask, wrap around goggles and a double saw blade baseball bat then what's this all been about?  (not that my character is wearing ANY of that or anything.......)
---
October is my favorite month of the year and you can bet I'll be dressed up all month long!
---
Edited to add: we should all dress up, meet up, and have our OWN HALLOWEEN PARTY AT THE PUMPKIN HOUSE!  Let's make this happen people!
---
Yep. I have a furious lever now, because I tried making a switch to handmade for a while, but I missed the slow firing of the lever. All my legendaries are QOL based so I'm only doing like 130 DMG, but it's incredibly cheap to repair and maintain.
---
Turbo controller.. nice!
---
I should be able to play Rocket 69 with any instrument since I have listened to it like 5738395 times. Man, Diamond City radio was not that bad...
---
I'm pretty bummed; I was a part of 3 cookouts last night and 2 this morning. All of them reached a full status bar with at least 3 minutes to spare. None of them awarded the Tenderizer, which I sadly did not receive at all during Meat Week.
---
/u/hottkarls scaring folks again?
---
Yeah I don’t get this one..
---
Yep, you're right. I somehow left that off. It's funny because that's the perk that prompted me to dig into the files for this info. It's been added now. Thanks!
---
Well im glad I only use my Hellfire for nuke zones and SBQ fights
---
Fair enough PA is loud but im surprised that sneak and escape artist dont effect PA at all.
---
I totally feel you man. For me, my 10mm pistol refuses to switch more than twice. Think it has something to do with certain weapons. Other weapons work just fine
---
Well when you're able it would be best to link your build so people can help you a bit more.
---
Has anyone else noticed mole-rats are bugged lately?
---
All variants of mole rat now have the 'glowing' texture, which is to say black skin and glowing green teeth. Before the standard variant of mole rats were pink skinned.
---
Right i haven't seen a turbo controller since the Sega genesis days lol
---
Sounds boring. You strip out everything all that's left is a sloppy combat system with bad graphics.
---
CS looks better and plays better and is ancient, why add the world's billionth first person pvp game when they bring nothing to the table?
---
What platform are you on?
---
I like to make Cranberry Cobbler- it gives you bonus XP.
---
Again as was pointed out earlier 150 scrip per day you have till the 17th to recap your characters out.
---
How about the camp you build has to look realistic, like something that might actually exist in the real world, and you can only build items in camp with plans that you have found in the world. You can't buy them. Or, you can't even have a camp/base at all: you just have to use the crafting stations and stashes you encounter as you're walking around. Too harsh...?
---
Its actually a cool part of the game and something that should happen more frequently that we should have to avoid.
---
Really? What's the event? 
---
I know there's things like *Monster Mash*
---
I couldn't agree more. I expect to have reduced sneak compared to no PA, but I would've expected those cards to have *some* effect. Nope. Or for escape artist to work while you're at least not moving. Nope.
---
Amen, I love the radier gear but I also like swapping my characters persona often. Atm, radier is by far the faction with the most cool options.
---
If you want lead and junk extractors go north of the alien blaster the 2nd junk pileand place your camp with the junk in the se edge of the build zone. Only place on the map for a junk and lead camp.
---
This was my second meat week. First week awarded me 3 tenderizers while this week gave me none. Think drop rate's changed as my friends weren't any luckier
---
I found that glitch back in the day. Turns out you could share your disarm perk and have a whole squad disarming the same grenade bouquet lol.
---
Ps4
---
Can confirm. Between 2XP weekend, Meat Week, and farming legendaries, I've gone from 53 to 91 in a few weeks.
---
Nope. I just make sure I have xp boosting buffs on. I can get 2-3 levels a day normally.
---
I play similar to you. I hate the bloodied builds and other cheap builds.
---
I play for fun. I doesn't mean to come off as condescending. Apologies.
---
I found them at player vending, but they are rare to find.
---
Dame Jeremy so it's not my platform. What did you do for it?
---
I thought about that too, but we have two weeks until the sale and it's not too hard to get back up to 1000 scrip by then if you play semi-regularly to that purpose.
---
I’ll add you but I won’t be on till 10:30 😭
---
I’m saving up for the discount. Only spending when I can’t script any more
---
Just double checking but the no-dropping-of-junk doesn’t apply to this event since it’s not technically public, correct?
---
It was actually reintroduced at one point (I think patch 11), but they fixed it at some point in the last few weeks wither with patch 12 or during one of the hot fixes. You could tell when it was active because people had massive stockpiles of fiber optics and circuits for sale.
---
So you have bought every plan and item on the game?  They are called cap sinks for a reason.
---
Edit: still a good suggestion.  Just lots of opinions on how game economics and value of a cap would be if you could have infinite caps in some way.  Right now max caps is 150,000 caps. All five characters. That’s what the current economics is based on. Since you have private sales going for over 30k caps on some occasions
---
Edit 2: same goes for scrip.  I can have 5000 scrip and then trade all the weapons between.  If you raise caps limit then someone else will want to raise the scrip limit. And then stash limit. And then rinse repeat until we’re are infinite
---
Are you talking about Rainbow 6 Siege? because im pretty sure no one has said that game is getting crossplay.
---
love my fully auto hand mades! If you don't want fully auto don't hold down the mouse button and you get a burst, it is the way to go. If you spec your weapon build correctly the recoil is almost not even noticeable
---
True , but today is my wife's birthday and she likes to celebrate all of October. So my time in game will be very limited for the next few weeks
---
&gt;Fireproof is a good perk, not very necessary if using the above 2 damage reduction perks. But it helps to avoid killing yourself with things like explosive harpoons.
---
Agreed, plus it makes you immune to scorchbeast donut spam.
---
&gt;In the end, what is "OP" about this? Heavy gun builds are very basic.
---
Yarp. Heavy builds are pretty straightforward. You can tweak here or there, but no one's going to blow anyone's mind with a heavy build.
---
What time frame are you?
---
It's expensive and demanding + most people can't tank those pylons. All my characters are offensive, and I love to be the heavy hitter and I love to do the trash clearing, but I need someone to tank. 
---
Rewards: a hat. I have like ten of them.
---
Ok so, it was public news that MW was used as a testing ground for crossplatform on all games that are on both Xbox and PlayStation. Apparently someone at Ubisoft commented on it or something
---
Pacific
---
Either way I don't expect anything but garbage rolls. Last sale I rolled 20 armor and only 1 was decent enough for trade.
---
They removed survival mode, so all the survival mode scumbags are back in adventure mode bein Dbags
---
Just leave pacifist mode on and they're just wasting their ammo
---
All my characters are sitting on 1000 caps atm
---
Damn it Todd
---
So it's 9:40 there now?
---
How is making cap stashes to store more caps not on par with making alt characters to store more caps?
---
Correct
---
I agree but got to be in it to win it!
---
Put up a post in Lfg...pretty sure you'll find some.
---
my full auto bloodied AAE hand made kicks the crap out of her, does more damage to her than any other weapon I have..I am not even running prime for it either, didnt really add much more for all the additional effort so I left the prime for my mini gun instead
---
90s, not 80s.
---
And I was born in 1975. *Imagine how I feel right now.*
---
I doubt it, I got 4 this time around.  RNG is just that, RNG.
---
I can keep myself busy for a bit. It'll only take me about 15 minutes to run the silo.
---
I’m willing to buy a tenderizer for 4500 caps cos I’m desperate to get my hands on it add me on Xbox- GrimKing027  and send me a message
---
True, but less emphasis on r4nd0m num83rs.
---
10 lbs is far more then hoarding 308 or 5.56 ammo.
---
Ahhh fuck they broke it again
---
Pfff, who in their right mind would waste their exotic slot on a rocket launcher.
---
Dont think the discount starts until the 17th its only the 3rd do both 👍
---
It maxes at +3 at 20%, so it lines up perfectly with bloodied and adrenal reaction. Hence the meta :/
---
I think the intention is to make players keep spending caps and make sure item prices do not inflate. Without 30k caps limit, people would be asking 1 million caps for a legacy weapon and caps grind would be a thing
---
I don't think so. It benefits a lot from Stealth perks and multipliers. A decently modded hunting rifle can do lots of damage. There are better weapons, but... It's great for headshots and criticals.
---
Spiders AND bugs ! woo hoo.
---
Lfg?  (Old lady here)
---
I never called you ignorant...
---
Your designated zone to avoid PvP is called "go play something else." There isn't a single area in the game that you're supposed to be safe in, and that's the game as intended. This isn't the equivalent of me smoking in your non-smoking zone. This is more like you going into an area where people are allowed to smoke and then complaining about it.
---
I could be wrong, and they are 2 different things, just my experience.
---
Haha it says we have mutual friends
---
I said low, not new, they were somewhere in the 30s. They knew the workshop belonged to someone else and tried to claim it anyway. Then they tried to run when they realized they were no match for me.
---
Looking for groups...on xbox in home page
---
Violet flux.
---
If they just let us pick our servers, they'd solve a lot of problems. All they have to do is have servers that are "everyone in pacifist mode" or "everyone in PVP mode" and most of this unhappiness would go away. Or even just input a simple check and see if you have pacifist turned on and if you do, you get put in a server with other people with pacifist turned on.
---
Wow, that's a very unconventional build. But I trust you because you made that power armor video explaining how the health restore from life giver makes you basically invincible: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d35mts/emergency\_protocols\_life\_giver\_combo\_is\_crazy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d35mts/emergency_protocols_life_giver_combo_is_crazy/)
---
Do you have the timestamp for where you explain how Revenant (50% damage bonus on revive) can be used solo? I watched the whole video through and seem to have missed it.
---
And how do you live with only 5 Agility and 1 Charisma and no Lone Wanderer? Sprinting anywhere must be really annoying. Lone Wanderer is such a powerful perk, and you can still swap it out when you're on a team for something like Inspirational, Rad Sponge or Team Medic. Also, 4 points in Charisma lets you slot Hard Bargain when at the vendor.
---
I thought that until my 10mm started causing 460 damage with the right build.
---
Eh yeah.. just loot watoga HS. And use the scrapper perk when you're breaking down weapons/ ammo. Go into component view in your junk tab and tag plastic as a resource you're looking for. You'll probably never worry about plastic anymore
---
Because my minigun is a VATS roll. It has 25% reduced AP cost which allows me to fire off roughly 12-13 rounds before depleting my 437 AP. It's bloodied so it scores a kill in roughly 3 shots which means I can kill 4 enemies on a full AP bar and with Grim Reapers Sprint refilling the meter once every 2-3 kills AP isn't an issue. It also has 50% VATS criticals so VATS is the optimal way to use it.
---
I know that heavy guns generally aren't good in VATS but I'm attempting to prove that wrong here by showing that  with the right roll and the right build it can be done. Right now Gun Fu not switching targets is the only thing holding this gun back from being OP.
---
No offence taken. No need to apologise. You are good person. You wanted to help me. 
---
I play for fun too. 
---
Have a nice day.
---
Same here, don't even try for candy.  Will also run the school when MM isn't running and still find a Legendary, usually a robot when MM isn't running.
---
This. A Buff would make it overpowered.
---
Oops, typo
---
Bruh I’ve been in my 30s for two weeks now - how do people find time ?
---
Hey, I don’t have one but was wondering how do you get it in game? I was away the first time meat week launched during the summer and I haven’t gotten it at any of the latest meat week events.
---
Ah. I usually get most of my playtime on weekends, so I plan to collect legendaries on the weekends and just pop-in for for 5 minutes on weeknights to grind them for the daily scrip.
---
And who is really surprised?
---
i just got one yesterday from doing collision course to kill scorched. Its got a graphical bug and looks too big
---
Lol nice.
---
Joe
---
Yeah i editted my bad.
---
I'm just a ni🅱️🅱️a with a rocket launcher
---
You can, but need to optimise perk usage. I do it with a non legendary Brotherhood recon rifle.
---
Isnt that the story of FO1?
---
They never reaaaally fixed it. For me personally all of my melee weapons have been RW/swing speed or agi/swing speed but ofc I'm not gonna complain about those. Been that way since the "fix"
---
yeah. even if you run with a group, you need to run with a *large* group to do that event properly lol. tough to do. i'd honestly be surprised to see people selling them for caps at all. at the end game, caps are kinda worthless anyway and even items are hard to swap for unless it's something that's kind of a commodity like some of the legacies or handmades that were duped.
---
tough item to acquire.
---
:(
---
I am going to see how good I am at this Update Patch 14 will happen on October 17th. We will also get Spooky Atom Shop items that week.
---
&gt; Must be a feature.
---
No it's an issue with my controller.. Not a B bug..
---
Im already sporting my post apocalyptic Pest Doktor outfit. :D

Yeah the mystery pick that was actually advertised when the purveyor was first announced lol
---
60 scrip for a random 3 star legendary.
---
Lmao
---
Must have been the wind ...
---
&gt;I've had two survival mode rejects....
---
before we start the continues name calling , i think pvers in general should take a good look at what there community realy is...
---
on this video im getting called racial slurs and as a person of color i doubt this would bode well with the pve community.
---
https://youtu.be/wv7Rcq3xx3I?t=295
---
It's a game, dude. Learn the shit out of every plan.
---
There are plenty of times I don’t even bother to kill or take the workshops but others time I might. Just depends.  I do typically give a warning (PvP emote) beforehand or let them engage me first.  
---
Got into a PvP battle at a vendor and ended up wrecking their camp but when they respawned I actually put it all back together and chatted up the other player.   
---
Most of the time someone initiates PvP with me it’s because they are bored or wanting to test out their weapons.  No problem on my end as I don’t always have to fight back.
---
PA is for lamers
---
Peeps are saying in other threads that melee is bugged again with only shitty 2d &amp; 3d star perks dropping from the vendor.
---
I teaches you to be cautious in the game, maybe dont keep all that junk on you before attempting a jump like that
---
My exact situation as well.
---
I’m not a completionist if I’m not going to use it I don’t learn the plan it’s a waste
---
I mentioned it because I'm the same, haha. Learning that allowed me to enjoy the games instead of being bothered by all the scientific inaccuracies.
---
Oh cool thanks, will the mystery pick be discounted too when the sale starts or will it be removed completely. I might chance my arm at it but generally i stick to 2/3 star ranged or 3 star Armor when I visit.
---
Always been there- i found it early on just hugging the edges of the map ...
---
Scorched Scorchbeast
---
If you don't manage to find one by sunday, send me a message on XB, and i'll sell you one
---

---
Might join. Add me. Andreslamantis. For mankind.
---
Only as a reward from Grahm's cookout unfortunately
---
That's nuts man. I haven't been able to justify tweaking my build to work with bloodied with an explosive shotgun and instigating hunting rifle taking down most spawns 1-2 shots but that's really cool.
---
keep in mind that when using auto if a bullet misses then your DPS shits the bed.
---
oh crap i thought it would last all day today!
---
I want a communist theme😂, with the Chinese Stealth Armor in it
---
200 atoms would be grab for 5 junk Iteams. That way they can do different sets of items and if they wanted they could implement more junk items into the game that were in the older fallout titles. And it being a Bethesda title, they could also add some Elder Scrolls junk props 😎😎😎
---
Low level Legendaries don't go for much, especially when they only have one star. Caps are easy, don't think he overpaid. It was less than the daily vendor cap so not too bad
---
No, leetspeak is way different than just text abbreviations
---
Thank you
---
flip a coin homie
---
Mystery Pick is available now for 60 scrip. Doesn't seem worth it when 50% off is coming up (50 scrip per 3* weapon)
---
Or for junkers that still like to be able to fast travel while carrying 500lbs.
---
Crap another hour or so for me!  Have a couple new guns I want to try...
---
Dang, that’s depressing
---
Todds personal account
---
Considering the Tenderizer is 20lb, you'll probably have some luck buying them from players. 
---
As its a lot of weight to either carry or stash
---
Any time i put something in my machines for free or well below normal prices some high level has cleaned me completely out. A few times i went to their camp and saw them putting them in their machines at greatly inflated prices. Maybe i will just just make some extra and drop costumes for people.
---
I keep seeing IE for sniping, however it’s only good for 1st shot, so BE is definitely best for sniping because every shot is powerful (especially with adrenal reaction mutation) and since your sniping you can easily run low health with out needing the bloodied build. Heck since your sniping a berserkers explosive would be interesting to test, again because you are sniping you could just remove all armor for lowest dr and run chameleon mutation. Might be the one case where berserkers are actually effective but bloodied still best I would say. IE is best for powerful single shot weapons like fat man, dragon, missile launcher and even broadsiders except now in pvp due to weapon caps. And though QE is great for automatics, what was left out was how cool this effect can be on powerful single shot weapons like the double barrel and the coolest of all the broadsider. The broadsider is already very powerful for one shot, add multi shot canister mod and quad explosive effect and you have a monster in your hands. It literally fires 6 shots as fast as a double barrel fires and reaks havoc. Sorry got a little off topic there but a lot of people don’t know this application of the quads.
---
With his idea, you don’t need a partner to help you transfer. That way everyone can hoard caps and make the economy even worse.
---
Happens on occasion at the clubhouse, I think. Kind of a pain in the ass. I've also had it happen with ghouls in Morgantown during Back on the Beat.
---
a lot of 1-star?
---
I have a couple left; there’s any PC players looking to make trade for my spare HMU
---
Gotcha. Was hoping it would be 50. Thanks!
---
Fallout 76 is more than a first person pvp game. Problem is to think that CS players should find in Fallout what they want. Cats and dogs, dude. PvP should be (and Is) just an aspect, just an element.
---
I'm doing what you did, but more slowly.  I am getting ffr (with crappy primay effects so... meh) so it's in the loot pool. Someone else in another post is saying melee can only be limb damage with agility or reduced weight, my one melee drop so far was indeed 50% limb damage with reduced weight.
---
good luck! had 12 opens and nothing too good sadly
---
Prime ammo is cheaper than its ever been. If you can find a good auto handmade with 50% crit damage and build for sneak crits you'll do a ton of damage. Prime it and remember to use chems whenever you can. Psychotats and overdrive work really well. If you can swing it get adrenal reaction and nerd rage. If you don't want to be under 20% you can run comfortably at 50% hp while still getting a damage boosts.
---
The MW crossplay beta was AWESOME. The game is too new for hax, and console aim assist seemed to level the KBM /controller thing so it all felt good ... erm, free kills ;)
---
If there was some proper investment in PC anti-cheat detection it could work for NW as well.
---
Yeah I’d prefer if I won it tbf, it’s too heavy to keep but would have had a bit of fun with it then bin it lol thanks for letting me know
---
It's over when I say it's over. Gotta kill them squirrels.
---
i sent you a msg on xbox
---
I'm old and don't get how to reply to certain threads, but the unlimited XP glitch is still a thing. My husband used it last night while playing. It's actually how he reached my level so quick. He's an ass... For this reason and others.
---
There's plenty of idiots and brigadiers around to downvote people for stupid reasons. It is Reddit after all.
---
I'm not a fan of PvP personally. I've tried it and discovered I don't care for it, so I don't engage. But I also don't really mind people people who enjoy PvP. Now anyway. Back when it was possible for someone to slap you to death, I minded a lot more. But afaik, that's been fixed, so really who cares?
---
Thing is, there's a bit of a difference between people enjoying PvP in the game and people going to an event and deliberately trying to trigger *unintentional* PvP while their target is trying to do the event just because they forgot to turn on pacifist. Or are too new to realize that they need to turn on pacifist. Which is what the original post is complaining about.
---
There's nothing wrong with enjoying PvP. Yeah, there are definitely PvE fans around here to think *any* PvP = griefing. But they're idiots. PvP in and of itself isn't griefing. But someone going around to events that are mainly catering to lowbies and trying to trigger PvP with them for shits and giggles because they don't know how/why to turn on pacifist mode? Yeah, that's getting more grief-y.
---
PvP does have a place in FO76 and, if you like it, turn off pacifist mode and have a blast! But maybe leave the lowbies at the massive events alone?
---
I had standard molerats just last night. 5-6 of them were attacking my Base (near the water treatment plant).
---
Where was that???
---
A unyelding armor set is a must too, it will buff all stats except endurance
---
It has been taking a long time for that location to spawn in. Try after being on a server for a while.
---
650 sounds fair. If it was for scrip that's high, bit a TS crossbow is a fun weapon, so they probably bought it to tool around with.
---
I did everything that post says to do, now to hope it works lol. Thank you
---
Thanks for the reminder, I always forget to turn it back off after grouping with people who don't want to pvp.
---
Pacifist off is the best way to deal with people who try to pvp!!  makes it a lot easier to kill them!!  
---
I'm totally serious.  the way pvp works in adventure mode the person getting attacked has all the initiative and get's to start the battle whenever they so choose.  This is a massive advantage, so just use it and you will win more than you lose.    
---
If you don't want to deal with the aftermath/seek revenge just immediately fast travel away :P
---
Oh no, all were 3 star, just not interesting enough to write them all down. Like +1 int on armor or limb damage on melee weapons.
---
I think server health is the problem. My 10mm and western revolver can gunfu five or six enemies.
---
3 and 7 too if i remember right
---
Im glad they heavily nerfed aim assist, ive played console most of my life and ive always been against aim assist. Im so glad Siege doesnt have it
---
Gotta love that FFR on a Black powder rifle / Pistol... T\_T
---
Yea, I just saw that. My pulls confirm that on the melee weapons I got. :(
---
Nail on the head with that one.
---
You do indeed drop your junk in this event. I try to only loot the candy then go back and loot meat piles when its over.
---
Read sub rules, no trading allowed
---
I have on 100% fall damage gear, so even out of PA I can't take damage. I did get caught in an oven once, though. I also never carry junk lol. It was pretty funny honestly. I laughed and gave him the thumbs up emote.
---
okay, phew, thought you paid 60 scrip for a lot of 1-star crap
---
Can we nuke Grafton and have to fight the mutated mayor? Pretty please?
---
i love you all for this thread, i needed this today, thank you
---
It's being removed on 7th no way they'll let us get a 3* legendary for 30 scrip 😂
---
It's great for heavy gun builds.
---
Dang. I want mine to get stuck that way. I get limb damage endlessly
---
I have salty and peppered if interested
---
The Vault 94 lootchest is not effected from my experience, got a Junkies, swing speed, strength buzz Blade yesterday.
---
Oh I will remove this post. Sorry
---
I have 2 characters, lvls 167 (started at Beta) and 48. my lvl 167 was just going around to nuke zones and scrapping crap to sale and that was getting boring. My lvl48 started because I was getting bored, so I am taking it slow doing all the quests, just finished the excavator quest, 1/2 way thru the Top of the World stuff, just started the P.Scout quest line.
---
Brilliant idea. I'm going to use it. Thank you.
---
I'm going to do a couple mystery picks but the bulk of my scrip I'm gonna blow out on the sale..
---
I'm sure we will make the stretch goal for 50%
---
I said it in the video (or did I?), it’s for this week vault 94 raid, even in PA water in the vault will give you up to 6 rads/sec.
---
Site seems to be down. Catch a screenie?
---
I think so.
---
Yes only demolition expert works on explosives (like rocket launchers or mini nukes) but it works for heavy guns with explosive legendary effect
---
So there’s no point in even getting any heavy gunner perks for an explosive heavy gun? Shame
---
That's kind of what I was thinking. I've been dealing with a lot of lag issues lately on PC.
---
I've only done limited tests but it seems consistent. If I time my kills and release the trigger it will switch targets but if I keep shooting it breaks VATS every time without switching targets.
---
I think there is a delay on the server/client communication and the minigun is too fast
---
Yeah, you won't be making much of a dent as a rifleman, but you can easily handle the mob and keep the tanks of the fight safe(r).
---
Correct. You need demolitions expert in INT for explosive damage bonus.
---
I'm trying to figure that out haha
---
I’d share the spot... But part of the fun is finding it!
---
And also I’d like to have a non-contested spot, thank you.
---
It was near Grafton. Theres like a small looking abandoned town with lots of broken buildings.  Might be Grafton itself but i don't remember. I'm a log in and check
---
What do I do with all this spare prime meat?!  
---
I finished the hunt over at mole miner village, travelled to vault 76 and ran towards the cookout site.  
---
And found Grahm beating the snot out of some propaganda bots in the 76 carpark.  
---
Ran over to the cooking area and there was a single solitary patch of burning grass. It's a good job we're around to clean up after that bloke.
---
.50 deals more damage than anything else other than gauss so at least there's that.  
---
But imo there's tons of other weapons that need love more than the hunting rifle.  A good HR can 1 shot mooks all day with the right build and legendary effects so as far as I'm concerned that's working as intended.  
---
Meanwhile the entire weapon class of pistols needs help, radium rifles deal tired and pathetic damage and have way too much recoil compared to how hard the mods are to learn, and most 1 handed melee weapons are hot trash.
---
HAHA! I have my main account that's level 260+ and I participate meat week regularly when it initiates on worlds -  2/3 per day at least and not once did a Tenderizer drop for me.   
---
So I bring in my second account with my main account that's level 25 to double my chances for rewards and all he did was churn the spit and he ended up getting the tenderizer... What even is this?! T\_T  
---
But good luck! i hope you get yours!
---
Never. You will always continue to get a perk card pack every 5 levels in the hopes of a non dupe animated card.
---
I think I saw a post here on this subreddit about outfits a few months ago... let me see if I can find it.
---
this is actually using the old legendary loot list instead of the new ones. its why it had the drill in it before
---
[Event Page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
The guy was literally killing a legendary 100 sheepsquach in less than a second. You see it spawn and then die instanly as he shoots 2 rounds. I am only level 45 and I don't know how op are end game builds but if you can do this then I am sorry to say but Bethesda makes a horrible job at balancing. You shouldn't be able to kill one of the toughedt enemies in game in the blink of an eye literally.
---
Depends what build your going for. The furious heavy is decent but save up some caps an go buy yourself something nice from a player vendor that fits your build. What kind of build are you trying to do? At lvl 100 I was playing a semi auto rifles build an had zero issues killing every thing.

I don't think it shows where or rarity, but it's a list of outfits.
---
No point really, just spend the scrip you have now and you'll be back to 1000 long before the 50% sale
---
Bard class, here I come.
---
You're welcome

Just learn them, caps are like rain in this game so easy to get, unless you are a mule user with multiple 30k characters then depends if they are full.
---
The accessible TNT domes are

2, 3 and 7. 
---
The others can’t be accessed
---
Ty

Sorry no.
---
What’s in the box!?!
---
I've been saving up my atoms for BOS stuff but it hasn't come yet. I will be very disappointed if it never does
---
They still did go to maintenance using a timer 2 days ago, not sure if it has changed since then.
---
Food build, when you kill them they drop a boat load of junk for you. Because they don't store their junk before doing stuff where they can be killed via pvp.
---
It was 1k per kill before they fixed it a few months ago. Good times ;)
---
Playing a normal, non exploit, game 4 to 6 hours per day since Nov. I have reached 442. You be the judge. See you all at 1,000.
---
Yeah, I have over 200 karma and am well over level 800. Probably a scam dude.
---
I got a friend who everytime Nole Miner come to his camp he being talking about how he F-ed Mermagur. Thank you for making me think of him.
---
Shit better be weightless if they do it..
---
As someone who grinded for the Tenderiser but never got it, I endorse this post 👍
---
I feel sorry for you.
---
Hah
---
Its not our fault as a heavy weapons user. How else we gonna get some armor piercing. PA is required :(
---
Haha seemed to break every time 😂 
---
That’s because HE broke it every time. A few months ago it was 1k each kill. Now it’s only 200xp más or something like that
---
I loved survival mode. It was honestly what I thought the game was going to be like when it came out. I was so disappointed that the community couldn't handle the PVP parts and slowly turned it into a huge safe zone. There are so many barriers to actually PVP in adventure mode it's like why bother? I don't blame people for resorting to goading and trickery, gotta admire the creativity. Just not my style, can't bring myself to kill someone who just wants to chill and cuddle their plushies in their campcastles.
---
I need a pumpkin backpack skin!  (have skeleton outfit and mask on PC)
---
Already happening with people running multiple accounts at the same time and just hoarding caps and buying outside of game.
---
plasma grenade plans are a 0.058139534883721% drop from ash heap events

Blows your mind to realize people with disabilities and don’t work can play games
---
Launch nukes at fissure prime. Don't try and set the, "all time speed record" for killing the queen allowing spawn after spawn of scorched mobs to generate and ultimately, eliminate.
---
This guy was literally using a heavy weapon and not even remotely facing his target. Not to mention my sniper rifle would barely get any hit chance and I run a perception build. Maybe I am not familiar to late game but I didn't meet any level 200 that came close to this guy's power. I've seen the vault raids on youtube and I am aware of how strong can you get but I bet this guy could wipe a high difficulty alone without a scratch.
---
I dont understand this but I believe you and will share with the FB peoples. Thank you for letting us know.
---
Something other than that.
---
Are u on PS4. I want to visit
---
First off that would be badass! Second off a pumpkin head enemy that's similar to the monster from the movie would be super awesome!
---
My main since i had from BETA got 0 Tenderizers. Had the exact same situation as yours with Prime meat and all that. I brought my second account level 25 to the event and all he did was churn the spit; nothing else and he ended up getting  the Tenderizer... What even is this?!?!
---
About sprinting endurance is reducing ap cost and if i need to do a lot of running or trading i have set off unyielding armour (with that hard bargain one already give me almost best sell prices and for buying expensive items from vendors i just eat grape mentats on top of that).
---
About revenant i show it at the end but it’s my fault video was already long and I didn’t explain it properly. Basically i have set of life saving armour, shoot the ground with rocket launcher or grenade launcher (those seems to reliably put me down without killing me all the way), life saving effect triggers and then i jump back in to my PA (+50% dmg for next 2 minutes)
---
That's a lot of resources to use. Was hoping for set spawns like the 50 cal, but if that's the only way, I guess I'll have to.
---
I got a few of the same weapon and most of the same stats, and no armour. All melee had limb damage.
---
Executioners Ultracite Gatling Laser +agility + 33 vats

---
This! I got a similar story.
---
Jesus christ. Read everything in my head normally and I sung that as I read it.
---
Because it doesn't have "scorched" in its name
---
Only for rockets, grenades or mini nukes, other guns that are explosive because of legendary effect will work.
---
Same, was hoping it would shut off at midnight.
---
You can't get all the cards for any decent build by level 50. But it's correct to say there is little difference between a lvl 100 and lvl 800 unless either was intentionally wasting levels. Most builds need around level 70 to 80 to get all the cards they will use regularly. Most cards you can even get up to about level 25 are trash you won't always use so you have to make up for those on the back end after level 50.
---
OK, that makes more sense. I was pretty sure I was getting trolled but then again you never know on reddit
---
My pacifist mode randomly turned off somehow and I got vaporized at a prime hunt event after I accidentally tagged some people. Luckily I didn't drop anything since it was at an event area, but it was pretty confusing.
---
Ok, interesting. What platform?
---
I checked with a party member (on PC), they advised they had the same issue.
---
No! Only movie that I have ever considered scary growing up. Pumpkin head can stay dead. He cheats anyways.
---
Np
---
I use a vampire's sledge hammer with 40% power attack boost and faster swing speed. Perks slugger and Incisor- thought it would be a great combination against her but it takes a lot of whacking, on the bright side I don't use any stimpaks.
---
It. Just. Works

I love it when you guys visit workshops. Easiest junk of my life.

There's not a unique map marker showing that this train station is different from all of the other train stations across Appalachia.

Junk is super easy to get. Just do a few runs through west tek an pick up everything an use scrapper to scrap the weapons. There is benches inside. You'll have more then enough to craft several weapons.

Please note that melee weapons are affected in the mystery pick as show here:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dctfrg/psa_melee_for_mystery_pick_is_screwed_up/
---
No, not really.
---
People with disabilities to the severity that they are unable to work are therefore not employed.  If I were to become disabled to the point I was unable to work I'd play a significantly higher amount of video games. 
---
I still can not fathom that someone who is employed , would have the time to reach level 1000 in under a year.
---
For some people it had, or at least i thought
---
depends on your perks/build.  I'm L142 melee, with stabilized as my only heavy weapon perk.
---
I would keep:
---
1. The AA 50 - might ultimately give better dmg against strong enemies and flying things.
---
2. Executioners gatling.  If its basing at 95, that's going to go up to 130 when the target gets to 50% life.  To be close to equal, furious would have to do almost 50% additional damage per shot to half life of the enemy, then 100% after.
---
3. Severe.  The other 2 are limited to enemy type, and still carry less damage per hit  (19\*1.3=24.7 where the severe does 38.)
---
Do the "Leader Of The Pack" event in the northern forest area(near the Tyler County Fairground). You can get three or more Level 10 1\* legendary items each time. These can be very useful early on.
---
Do events in the forest whenever they appear.
---
Take over a workshop at the beginning of a session and do the defense events that occur. More workshops = more events and you get caps, xp, aid and gear each time. Not a ton of caps, but you can sell what the enemies drop, cook meats and sell them.
---
Think we have to complete the what 3 million scorched kills or something by the 16th
---
Damn that really sucks, don’t think I should risk it then :/ I’ll try for a better handmade though
---
Maybe because almost nobody does ash heap events. But no it's statistically impossible that nobody on xbox ever found it. It could be as you said.
---
Lots off poop. I wished I’d just gone for the 100 scrip ones.
---
Picked up a 2S TS Fat Man for 400 caps. 
---
I use it for fireworks and whimsy mostly - but now you’ve got me excited for survival‘s hopeful return.
---
Their Twitter said it started today
---
I am experiencing the same thing.  So far 4 melee, all have limb damage.
---
Jerks I was there an hour ago and prices were still normal!
---
That's why I always stash before taking a workshop, or the stash box is the first thing I drop so I can unload quickly. It's a calculated risk. And I'm always crouched to not show on the map. I'd never go to an occupied one while loaded down like that. Or, I'll have my most valuable stuff stashed so you'd only get my wood, glass, and oil if you did kill me.
---
I have an Instigating pipe revolver that is excellent. Light weight, regularly hits for 1,500 to 1,800 on headshots, and is pretty durable with the Forceful stock. 8 points in Rifles and 3 points in pistols makes a big difference.
---
She's going to take her clothes off. Feast your eyes!
---
Two shot is plus 25% damage, even if you miss some shots that is still far superior to mutants which is just absolutely useless
---
Looks to be a regular issue and many users have posted about it with different experiences. Hopefully it will help!
---
Well, I feel I should repay Chally for the milk somehow.
---
Should I do that with 100 scrip melee weapons? I see that the effects  for the  mystery pick sucks for melee weapons
---
Salt and a baby bottle, if I have it, but same idea. Well done!
---
Deathclaw sized spider enemies would be so awesome
---
As a x-man or “sylar” player (spent my lower levels basking in rads to collect them all). 
---
I would love even a slight buff to mutants. 
---
especially because it requires a very high luck investment that leaves little room fo other - key - spec’ cards like bloody mess or tormentor etc
---
Depends on your area probably. It said 12 pm EDT I believe
---
It's not ideal I know, but still a cheaper way to roll for 3* weapons and armor.
---
You know, you don't have to lump us all in with the nasty assholes. *Every* group has toxic assholes. It's not exactly fair to paint the whole group with the same brush just because a few are twatmonkeys.
---
Are you kidding me, wow! I hope he is playing 20 hours a day, because that would be the only way I would believe he wasn't using exploits to level up.  
---
I have put in close to 2000hrs in,  and I am still in the mid 300, 351 to be exact. I could be wrong, and I probably am,  but that is impressive, and  it  shows dedication, if done with out exploiting.
---
 I wish you and everyone the best.
---
Well, my 16 tries got me 13 3 star weapons for 960 scrip. 11 3 star weapons would be 1100 scrip. So, while you may have different outcomes, I would certainly do it again...
---
On their site it still says the 25% discount is locked we're at 2m of the 8m required

---
purveyors mystery pick starts today. 
---
the 25% and 50% off sales are the scorched challenge goals and starts 17th October
---
Well fudge. This is the melee I got so far just for further evidence of a problem with the melee items ...
---
* Bloodied SSledge-50limb-90reduced weight
---
* Stalkers(lol) baton-50 limb-agility
---
* Junkie switchblade-50 limb-agility
---
Thanks for posting your drops btw.
---
Yes it has
---
Doesn’t traveling pharmacy work for both stash and carry weight? When I dropped it my stash went full and I was over encumbered.
---
Yep, I've got a TSE hunting rifle. It should be a beast, but 3-4 shots to kill a supermutant from sneak does not feel beastly.
---
Wow. Highest I seen so far, on xbox, was almost 400. Have not played PC version in a while.
---
Straight trash. Nocturnal weapons an trash pvp armor
---
But the idea that just because someone is disabled means they have nothing better to do than play the same video game feels as if it's kind of demeaning towards somebody to disabled.  To be clear, I do not mean to attribute that intention to you.
---
Good riddance to it then!
---
Nah, it's awesome.
---
Herm I'll check it out tonight you got me excited that I may actually not get trash for once (or at least alot of trash)
---
I’m a melee build and I never get melee boxes. Mine were all limb damage and +Agility and out of 11 items I got 6 melee. 2 were exactly the same weapon. The other 5 I got 3 rubbish Gatling lasers. Wasted all my scrip.
---
I got 2, and bought a third at a vendor and then modded all three with each mod
---
I’m all for grinding for stuff that is rare, I got 2 total tenderizers between two characters for both these meat weeks, but rare outfits weigh nothing, this thing weighs 20. Not even worth putting on display IMO. Probably gonna sell mine again

I don’t see why it needs to. Once you learn it’s there do you really need it to hve a different logo?
---
I had no idea there was a limit on max characters, I've only got 1 likely that I'll never make another. And I've got most of the plans, there's just power armour ones and a few serum recipes but I'll never use them.
---
I’m ok with a specific class of anti-mutants “purists” (as mentioned by others + zealot was taken) weapons but I don’t think a just general buff to non-mutated players would work at scale. 
---
Especially that high lol. 
---
Mutant players already have a world of debuffs and specific perks to contend with - for the sole goal of evening the playing field between non-mutants.
---
PC
---
Yeah, bloodied is def not what I plan on going for down there. Although standard isn't really that hard to run,  it's impossible to run solo.
---
This really makes me sad :/
---
I actually did test Sneak on PA vs my mule few weeks ago, to see if it affects visibility of one's dot on opponent's radar. It sadly doesn't.
---
I currently have a Trapper Blocking set all with AP refresh but it's a mix with Vanguard, Weightless, LS, Mutants etc. Ideally, it would be a dream to have it all Vanguard. I feel like it works amazing with my Unarmed build.  
---
What armor are you sporting for your blocking build?
---
Backpack + high capacity with deep on all armor, boom no PA needed
---
Ooh okay I see
---
Not as sad as me.
---
Well, ok. I just see them crashing.
---
Because a cap stash of 1000 weighs 10, so it's not like it's infinite caps, only as many as you are prepared to store.
---
Dude. Storage Wars it is ma favourite show on tv. 
---
After you buy the key and open the door there should be plenty of useless weapons armors and other junk. There should be also Mr Handy who tells you how great all those stuff is and how many thousands of caps you can get when you "find the right buyer" lol.
---
They're replacing survival with the server load of instances for Wastelanders.
---
Do you know is ricochet works?
---
These are different things...
---
Paging /u/Ladydevann
---
Hopefully this means that the event will be rescheduled after this is fixed.  Due to the current cost, it is effectively not a sale because 1/3 of the items will be garbage (limb damage is no good on melee) and armor is full price if you get it.  This effectively takes it back to something like a 10% off sale.
---
yeah I agree, even my main now I run somewhat bloodied if I am using my hand made because it is a bloodied handmade. But I can run my TSE shotty and not run bloodied at all. I wouldnt want to run that solo either :)
---
The price drop has not happened. Mystery pick is different.
---
I’ll probably spend half my scrips and if it’s trash stop and save em for the next discount
---
For their part,  Eck told Devann about a similar problem with melee and limb damage and she got it fixed but for whatever reason, they never went back and fixed the mystery pick which had the same basic issue that they fixed in the world spawns
---
Yes... it has...
---
Bruh
---
This is super important and helpful, thanks!  I have been using PA since launch....
---
Just finally saw the post... Sorry thought they were both happening at the same time. It's been a long week....
---
I feel ya on this one. What a resource hog trying to learn the mods. All for what....
---
Moment of silence for our fallen soldier
---
Anybody else thinking this is all linked to wastelanders? I mean... we're killing off all the scorchbeasts and scorched. Before they come back.
---
Maybe scorched will be gone soon.
---
I think they should.... but only during the next meat week.
---
MRRGA?
---
Maybe it would de value caps? Maybe. But like you said it wouldn't require alt characters to store them, i despise the use of mule characters.
---
I run a bloodied PA heavy gunner too, but I've taken a slightly different direction to yours. I went solo min-max with a bit of QOL. Here's my build:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e114ebb&amp;d=sb1sq2s32sr2sg2p00eu0c72ii0s11ip2ir2l71lt2lu2ls2a12a04s72ic4&amp;w=&amp;m=5c29fe8&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Travelling Pharmacy - meds are insanely heavy. This is the biggest weight saving perk in the whole game. I'd like points, but I don't want to sacrifice anything else.
---
Perception - throwaway for me (solo, not raiding). I swap this one regularly for glow sight, concentrated fire or green thumb (flux hunting).
---
Endurance - throwaway also, and this is one where I don't agree with your choices. You like lifegiver for +45, but you play bloodied. So it's +9. I usually play around 40-47hp (19%- for me), so I don't see that 9 hp makes any realistic difference for 3 perks. Your other choices seem raid specific, so I won't comment.
---
Charisma - big wasted opportunity here. Lone Wanderer is probably the most OP perk in the game for 4 points. Tenderiser is nice in theory, but with a B50-cal, what on earth lives long enough? Tenderiser is a lovely perk in theory, but a bad perk in play :(
---
Int - Agree on the batteries included (even for non energy weapon users, fusion cores are HEAVY, but I may drop this as they're easily farmed), stabilised is obvious and Nerd Rage is essential. I don't like your choice of power user here. Unless you're rocking a legacy BE energy it's just not worth it. 3 precious points. I like scrapper for 1 because an assault rifle is 19 steel and I use a lot of ammo :)
---
Agility - I don't get you not taking dodgy. Blocker kills the melee damage, Dodgy kills the ranged. It's absolutely crazy powerful. Thru hiker is my own choice, but only because carry weight :/
---
I do group sometimes, when someone is holding a gun to my head, and I swap out LW for SIN.
---
Mine's not as versatile as yours (raid considerations - I don't run it), but I think for solo play it's a better option. Would love your thoughts, as you're clearly very experienced :)
---
Ist.
---
Damn it Karen
---
So I'm hearing :)
---
With heavy and auto ballistics it seems the mobs need to be in a very narrow cone in front of you to swap. Auto lasers/lasers do not suffer from this and will have me spinning 90 degrees either direction. Plasma however functions like ballistics. These are my observations on Xbox and about 2 weeks playing around with it.
---
I think save for discount.
---
Thanks, I'll check that out.
---
i feel hard to level up when reach to 50 level..........
---
Not everyone is able to get that much scrip!
---
I don't have a blocking build personally. I would also probably keep them Vanguard. I got lots of zany builds though tbh, some I have used but some still need tweaks. One example is a berserkers life-saving build with broken armor
---
&gt;we're killing off all the scorchbeasts and scorched
---
Well, we've been doing that by just playing the game as it is
---
Oh god, bbs's. I am old enough to not only remember those, but to have run my own. I named it The Scratching Post and my sn was Catnip. My board also ran LORD. I was one of 10 in our tiny town.
---
Nope, you have to have a balance. If it's weightless I dont want it.
---
If A card doesn't work with power armor it should unequip automagically.  Like so many things this game just needs a lot of work imo...   it's starting to tip over with all the pay for stuff getting constant changes or updates while bugs get ignored.  Sorry I know this isnt THAT thread...   I'm an angry gamer.
---
Total shit, spend 13k scrip and have nothing to show. Makes me wish we could scrap that shite.
---
I don't really know if it's related but I keep having a glitch in my camp with traps...it's the standing swinging nailboard thing..every time I fix it, it breaks immediately. I actually need the thing but after a few times trying to fix it I scrapped it. Tho I didn't notice if it was giving me XP....just noticed it was giving me a headache. I put a heavy turret in place of it...tho it's not aesthetically pleasing
---
#Explosive2ShotRollingPinPls
---
Mystery picks at the purveyor? Is this an event or something?
---
Thanks for the report, I'll bring this up with the devs and let you know once I've got more info to share!
---
Just bought the bear outfit, guess I know what I will be wearing... :)
---
why don’t the developers make the mystery pick better loot when they know that’s what people have been grinding on their game for? Doesn’t add up as to why they’d continue to throw average trash loot out to players who invested time into the game
---

---
 &gt; Thanks for the report, I'll bring this up with the devs and let you know once I've got more info to share!
---
That would be fine too. Assuming there will be another meat week
---
Berzerkers build with broken armor? huh... Does that actually work? I mean it would make sense!
---
Early adopters to the game got tons of experience at the white spring. The glowing ones used to drop a ton of xp. It was common for me to level multiple times clearing the club house.
---
Great idea, DM sent...
---
Honestly kind of sounds more like a NW mode than its own game mode however if u  drop the class system and make. It u can use ur adventure perks and weapons  and make bases the workshops call it workshop wars expand the build radius and each one gives a different amount of a new resource which essentially equals points you would be able to solo or team up that being said the solo crowd would be at a disadvantage but for the more skilled pvpers it could make a fun challenge of it. As for larger team numbers u could add an alliance option so 2 or 3 teams of 4 could work together and be on a larger team without breaking the benefits of perk sharing and alliances. Could still be broken over friendly fire but in a shoot first shoot back kind of way like adventure as for items and new things  they should add new stuff but i dont think it should be game mode specific or give  existing items secondary function like ur stealth feilds could be the greenhouse domes but in new game mode give them the functionality of like invisa domes. No aid drops but un able to store youre junk in ur stash only at a workshop storage which once u or ur team lost that workshop they would also loose the junk stored there also possible multiploers like double or triple ur junk yeild for every 4 or 5 workshops claimed. at the end the winning team/playet would take the pot so to speak also camp placement could be different and inly be placable so far from an owned workshop essentially creating strategic outposts but u can keep ur camp eeven if the nearby workshop is taken until that camp is found and destroyed (as eventually after someone takes a workshop and u keep coming back at them to take ur WS  back they will eventually sniff out ur camp also only spawn points would be owned workshops or camps so if a team looses a player and has no WS and their camps have been destroyed that team mate stays dead (respawns must occur within x amount of time of death so if ur team cant reclaim a workshop then the dead player is just that)
---
Workshop wars? Junk wars? War nevere changes just like the great war in the fallout universe it all boils down to resources
---
-this might be a bit scatter brained but hopefully people get the just of it
---
Yeah, that's my plan too. Test the waters, otherwise, hold off and farm script for the sale (hopefully 50% off).
---
Same.
---
No. 
---
Source: I was born in the mid 70s
---
I got a winner. Heavy metal chest with vanguards AP and Weapon weight. 117 dr without the vanguard so im happy.
---
Alsoni did get a few weapons and 2 melee ones were indeed 50 limb.
---
Economy is already broken so just let us store between our characters and share items as well....
---
Do you run a facebook group?
---
The entire thread starts with a lump assumption from the OP; 'Everyone who tries to goad me into PvP is a [projected insult goes here]'. There's no stone to cast here since it was already thrown from the start. You know what they say about people who make assumptions.
---
Glad you got good items !
---
Umm yes i can as my 3 star belistic pistol gives less damage then my 3 star meat hook
---
i mean back when i was in my 50s i saw 200+ people. now im at 180.. could be done if you dont have a job and somehow find enought to do (which i cant these days)
---
back when legendary farming was easy, leveling up would just be a by product
---
Just like I told someone else;
---
If it would help some people, and not hurt anyone else, then it's a good idea.
---
Turns out that guy was just trolling anyway, for a laugh. All good. Not sure about you, you tend to argue with me for the sake of it sometimes.
---
Yep. Using Ammo as a currency is just fine and I encourage it. But you can't use ammo to buy things at vendors. Caps are always gonna be more valuable. So the trade off is that caps  have a weight of 0.01
---
I thought it was just me!  So they did fuck this gun up...  nice
---
If u mod it it weighs like 32# lol
---
Yep, americans are certainly a lot bigger on Halloween than the rest of the world, a whole month of dressing up?
---
 Using multiple accounts around 11,000 scripted blown through.. **(183 draws)**     
---
(3) decent weapons (BE Single Action, AE Pipe Bolt Postol, BE Black Power Rifle)    
---
(3) Decent armor (Unyielding/Cav, Chameleon/Sent, Unyielding/Sent)    
---
(3) good low level Items    
---
(0) rare weapons (Fixer etc) in all
---
What you cant get 1000 scrip in 2 weeks ? And that would be if you wanted to hit the sale on the first day it runs a few days I believe so you've actually got longer
---
Thank you.
---
Thanks for the warning lol will not be modding mine
---
Nope but I feel like the consul gamer on FB don't always know what is going on. So I try to share this type of information to a few groups I am apart of because you know just feels like the right thing to do.
---
I think you're missing the point. No one here is talking about a dislike for PvP, this is a discussion about those who try to FORCE others into it. Everyone knows if you take a workshop, you can PvP, and no one on this thread is hating on that. 
---
What people are complaining about is going about your normal business, and having people force their " style of playing " on others. 
---
If the vast majority of PvP didn't require specifically fine tuned gear, I'd likely be more likely to do it myself. I remember when the game first released and hunting bounties was fun. Now it's used as a way for someone with a mixed set of assassin's and bloodied to 1-2 shot you with a deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
I think about 95% of my most recent PvP interactions has been someone absolutely mopping the floor with me, in such a fashion that I feel like a level 2 fighting a COL Gutsy on Hard. 
---
People who want to PvP, build for it and are prepared for it and that's fine. Taking advantage of game mechanics and flaws to force someone else to adhere to your preferred play style is not.
---
Good question, maybe it'll be better in 2 weeks with the 50% bonus.
---
Yep! Supposedly. Soon as I heard about it I wanted to try it but have too much weighing me down
---
Did you at least do the challenge with killing enemies with a crossbow? Thats why I'm still keeping mine...lol
---
Me too, bro. Probably 40-50 cookouts, running around like a dickhead.
---
Purveyor? Is that you? I'd like a refund...
---
and here I was excited to finally get a bloodied 3\*.  I knew I was in for a rough road when it was the radium rifle, but im still trying to make it work. 
---
I have dropped about 30 hours farming screws to make rad rifles to learn plans. 
---
I hate that I still havent gotten a receiver  upgrade.   My TSE Handmade still does more damage, even under 19%.
---
I am severely dissapointed in this weapon.  
---
I concur with the OP, plans for this need to be easier to get, or they need to buff the damage on the weapon, it should do equivalent or greater damage than a combat rifle (uses the same ammo, harder to get item)
---
If you pass a river you went to far. Look up resources map fallout 76 and it's the first reddit link. 
---
Edit 1: more info
---
To be fair, there's a trophy/achievement tied to WINNING the damn 3-part event rather than just participating/completing, and if you just want to get the trophy, it still could take months to A) be on a server when you're playing that actually gets Monster Mash active, and once you get there B) you either "git gud" and win against some level 400 whale or C) you find other players nice enough to help you out and take the "loss" after you get their attention by "screaming over voice" to get their attention so they'll cooperate just long enough to let you get the effing trophy so you can be done with it.
---
I actually think it's your level that makes the difference. I've noticed it sounds better than when I started playing, but I don't have many points in INT. Just 5 for gunsmith.
---
good for you.
---
I'm starting to think that there is a small delay in the time it takes VATS to switch to a new target and if you fire a shot during this small window the game then thinks you're no longer in VATS. This game has a lot of issues with slow server/client communication.
---
Are you fucking serious?  It's the THIRD of October, how fucking early are you people running around in costumes with bags of candy?
---
Imma spend maybe about half of my scrip and I’ll save the rest for the possible discounts
---
On the other side... This is one of the only wepons in the game you can reliably sell service to mod them.
---
Paid 2 people to mod em and am looking to mod another.
---
Ya it kinda sucks if you're a solo kinda player but the idea behind having someone out there who is a weapon smith makes me happy. I wish more things were like this.
---
I'd be on the lookout for chefs/armors all the time if the game wasnt so do everything your self.
---
Fair enough keep fighting the good fight
---
&gt; Yarp
---
Narp?
---
A man of culture I see :)
---
I completely forgot junk shield doesn't work in power armor. Guess I need to tweak my load out.
---
I feel like all the weapons need a buff. Only weapons I see being used are gatling lasers, 50 cal mgs, and Gatling guns. The problem is that once you hit 50 I feel like all of the enemies become bullet sponges, rather than being actually more difficult if that makes sense
---
Nah, I've been known to drop 5k on weapons I wasn't even sure would be a viable combination of effects. 650 is great. You probably could have gotten 1k, the standard flat rate is 1k per star for preferred effects, until younger into meta weapon/legendary combos like BFFR handmades or QFFR teslas etc.
---
i'm ALWAYS happy to talk about the radium. I think it needs a buff, the handling is pretty crappy too compared to Chad Handmade. I'd also like to see the stinging mags of the other rifles increased to 35 capacity like Chad's. I enjoyed the challenge of learning all the mods, it was maybe the best quest i've undertaken in this game.  
---
What's more likely though is we see Chad getting a nerf rather than the other rifles getting a buff which i do not agree with.  
---
The radium rifle already is great, we just need to to be greater. Happy Radding brother/sister!
---
Its my choice to pay into bethesda I buy 200 repair kits and 200 scrap kits per month plus other camp items they sell.
---
Should. There aren't any conditions on it that check for armor at all. The only disabling conditions are if the subject has the 'NoRicochet' keyword or if its weapon type is grenade (pretty much any throwable explosive). There are 177 references to the NoRicochet keyword but they are all enemies. Looks like mostly cryptids, vertibots, turrets, and a crap ton of 'test' and 'cut' references. Too many to sort through for me to give an accurate list of what is and isn't affected by ricochet. But nothing referencing armor or power armor so I think it's good to go.
---
Oh I'm sure that's exactly what some will do once they're given private servers where they live in their own little bubble world in a game that was designed for multiplayer interaction. This game needs MORE incentive to interact,  whether positive or negative, not less.
---
Its spooky season boi! Get with the program haha
---
yes, today through the 7th
---
"Who knows? You may wind up getting the deal of a lifetime."
---
Doubt...
---
So like a ABC file in games like sota and starbound.
---
I did the event a lot of times....
---
Me too. 2 melee 2 50 limb
---
Yep! That's why I made this post. Glad it could help. Go put those perk points to better use! I can't wait until we get perk loadouts so I can have one for in PA and one for out of PA.
---
I have a heavy build and i can confirm its nothing spectacular, its the weapons that deal most the damage at the end of the day
---
Yeah fun that by the time legendary perks are released people like this exist to instantly unlock all of them for the wiki
---
Im on XB1 and alot run meat hook. I personaly got blessed by the pervayer months ago she granted me a 3* legendary Mutated Meat hook.
---
I also feel like this would take more of the pvp crowd off of adventure mode where as survival only grabbed the attention of the more "hardcore" pvp players and the average player still engages workshop conflicts over on adventure
---
My character is named Tandy and hes the last man on earth!
---
So I can stack all of those meats at once? And I read in one of the patch notes fury doesn’t work for unarmed anymore but I guess it still might count towards one hand?
---
It's going to be great. Don't forget one for crafting too.
---
I've got SS +1 str before this update so they did indeed fix it and break it with in 2 patches. :(
---
I'm embarrassed to note that your lyrics are more accurate than mine...
---
I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see that the story didn't end with a server disconnected statement. Congrats on your kill.
---
I'm with the comment above, caps come and go but you're probably never going to see that plan again. Your comment tells me you may have already made your mind up tho.... So charge 20k and see what happens :)
---

If Duke nukem wasn't already dead, this butchery of his tag line would have killed him.

---
I will try this specifically. Thanks for the input!
---
Haha! This is me, right here. Playing with shotguns means I'll always struggle with big enemies. But I find the outrageous noise fun! No sneaking here! The best I can say for it is the HUGE clip and it's one of the first explosives I ever got. MORE kaboom!
---
Bear arms vs bandolier depends on preference.  I swapped to bandolier and it saves me more than bear arms as I only carry 2 guns at a time (1 vamp, 1 damage) but I like to have over 10k rounds on me preferably 15k+.    
---
Having to stop to craft ammo is a pita :P
---
I’m just trying to protect the scarcity of my tenderizer
---
Shhh
---
I do 228 damage with my quad explosive hunting rifle. I do use it mainly for sneak attacks so I can one shot high level super mutants and scorched. When enemies do get closer I switch to a different weapon, so a ffr would be a welcome change. I haven't found a decent lever action rifle with the same effect so i can't compare what the difference is.
---
I know the water purifier at the junk yard by Charleston has been bugged forever. When it suposto drop one water it drops 5. So if you're hanging out there you can get a million waters in no time.
---
That's how you know it's all a lie! /s
---
Lol. Well it’s a train station so I think it makes sense to be labeled as a train station.
---
All bad. Things like suppressors machete and troubleshooters assault rifle. Mutants and mutant slayer armor. Junkies wardrum +limb and agility was the best out of 9 spins. Not today i suppose.
---
I’ve been working to max for the sale. Can’t max twice.

Yeah, but...  new skins in the shop!!! Come spend your atoms sheeple!!!
---
Does it not track properly? You said you have to unplug, so I know this isn't the problem you have, but my Bluetooth just drops sometimes. Not like I might want my Microsoft OS to work with my Microsoft controller or anything...
---
That's most of their fixes lol they basically roll back bug fixes every update
---
ETA on fix?
---
No I’m not missing the point, I’m pointing at something that comes up whenever PvP discussions happen here. 
---
Take mine and your interaction for example. At no point have I indicated that I grief or harass people in such a way as forcing PvP or baiting people in events or slapping to instigate PvP, the only thing shown by my comments is that “I like PvP”. Despite that I get downvotes and comments telling me how griefing, baiting, and harassing is wrong. I’m using you as an example here of this point I’m trying to make because you said it yourself “to adhere to your preferred playstyle”, you’ve lumped me in with this group you dislike because I mentioned PvP. Wether you did it intentionally or subconsciously You’ve mislabeled me And that’s what I’m trying to get at.
---
Imma spend some scrips and save the rest for the possible upcoming discounts. Sorry you had to waste scrips for bad loot :/
---
Any new weapons added should have legendary variants
---
This wholesome pvp post getting downvoted to hell is why I've loding faith in the 76 community. Holy shit guys Pacifism exists for a reason, and PvP encounters have already been nerfed to hell. Suck it up. Maybe even consider trying it. It's actually kinda fun.
---
Actually, the best solution would be to create two distinct servers 
---
Fallout 76 SIMS.  No PvP, heck no PVE either.  Just camp building and farming mats until you can’t stand it anymore. 
---
Then having Fallout 76 for the rest of us.  PvP, events, enemies, basically the way the game was designed before the haters complained to Bethesda
---
I killed a bunch of them yesterday. it's nice seeing someone not as jaded as me that's actually surprised by a sheepsquatch instead of going "great, another bullet sink". or "this is gonna cost me 10% of durability".
---
*Leaks personal info*
---
Lol, yeah. Yes it is.
---
Congrats!
---
Cheers to the first of many!

~~Oh okay brb~~

Hope your luck improves! I've gotten some pretty good rolls from her on the past, so fingers crossed.

They could even make randomised versions of what is inside and have a viewing time of 30 seconds when you can’t go in but you can see. Sometimes there is a full suit of X01 behind a taxidermy bear other times what looked like the edge of a Farman launcher was a toaster and some broken chairs 😂
---
best of luck to you!! we all have til monday thankfully 😄
---
Yeah I knew that one for a long time. That's how I leveled and got caps on my early characters. But my water purifiers at my camp do about 5 per for all 4 in about 10 or so minutes.
---
I also just checked my highest level character and I'm only getting like 1 per 10 mins. Lol i don't know what's going on
---
Yes.
---
Then why is it flammable. But it a strong candidate. Ty
---
Skins should definitely cover more than one specific model
---
Unfortunately none of the weight reduction perks work in stashes.
---
I only started playing this game about 12 days ago and already on level 68 how can one person get that high? Has his chair got a toilet and fridge  built in?
---
Hunter's 50% limb dmg drill. Get 'em.
---
we can only pray. Hopefully then raiders and ghouls and over new enemies can show up
---
Head on over to the market subreddit
---
It's funny.
---
Hey you just saw me kill the scorch beast with this legendary rifle.
---
Now I'm the  A-Hole for not selling my legendary you for 20 caps because you asked for it.
---
Go vending machine hop like the rest of us.
---
You are wrong. Only reason why I play with radium because I always love it. There is no sense run with handmade, everyone with this gun... It's looks boring. Game is so easy, almost all weapons are viable, doesn't matter radium or assault rifle you pick up today, just play and have fun.
---
Cool I've saved max for this then I'm gonna blow it and save max again for when the sale starts easy to hit the max each day op asked for opinions and that's mine.  And what do you mean cant max twice
---
Upload it to Imgur and put the link in your post. It should generate a thumbnail. Also, people will go crazy for it in the trade subreddit that cannot be named here.
---
I got the plan out near whitsprings
---
I do the throw up emote and puke on their shoes
---

---
Meat week is a good place to find people to PvP lol I guess we found the toxic side of the community the PvP haters.
---
yea this need to be hotfixed otherwise there is no reason to grab the mystery pick
---
Lol... Thx my man
---
Go buy some thing good on the trading subreddit
---
AFAIK no perks work on your stash just if you have the card equipped and look in your stash you'll see the reduced weight of what it would be on you. if you unequipped your perks and look at your stash you'll see the real weight it takes up which is full weight for any item.
---
This and the last couple inside the vault articles have been amazingly generic.  I miss old ITV's where they would actually talk about interesting upcoming content etc.  
---
I'm surprised they don't start teasing Wastelanders at least in a minor piecemeal way.  Like highlight one new upcoming creature, weapon, or armor per week.  Or preview some of the changes to areas like the crashed space station without getting overly spoilery about it.
---
Too bad theres no bug for bloodied 25ffr for ranged xd
---
I’m fine with that, as much as we grinded, but finding graham outside of meat week would be a grind also
---
It depends on the game...actually, when I think about it, if I'm on a PC game I'm more likely to, but on consoles I just try to make my character somewhat aesthetically pleasing. I did, however, change her hair color to match mine after I dyed it purple. :)
---
Both, it is e extremely easy to get scrip so spend away
---
But what would the lore behind that be?
---
Who says toxic waste isn't flammable? All kinds of stuff is flammable. Like steel beams of tall skyscrapers.
---
Agree, best quest also for me
---
When in doubt FEV abomination
---
Sadly
---
Ive saved scrips the last week for this event and Im so disappointed. Not to be that guy, but clearly there has been someone in charge of the event that hasn’t put enough effort into it. It’s literally ONLY the rng that needs supervision. The term “you had one job” is pretty well perfect right now.
---
This.  Even if you don't max scrip daily you can hit 1k or close without spending a ton of time on it.
---
Pre-nerf-ammo-capacity drum handmade powerful auto used with crit and ap perk cards used to be op.
---
Lever gun is better than single shot handmade.
---
Better yet just spend the daily limit each day you're on so you can immediately recoup it.  That way if you end up missing a day of fallout it doesn't cost you during the big sale.
---
Definitely would enjoy more events like this.
---
Amen!
---
Yeah I was looking into those as well. I'll have to check them out and maybe have them as a backup. Right now I'm running shotgun and handmade.
---
That is perk issue im pretty sure becouse i kill super mutant with non legendary in one shot no issue
---
Ya but they only mark flammable it's able to auto combust or if a flame or heat gets close  not saying it's not mutagen waste. You had a better guess then me.
---
Which is why it should have stayed in Far Harbor. Seriously almost all the enemies you encounter are radioactive beasts, which you are shooting with radioactive bullets! It’s good against humans, which there are none of.
---
Food builds gonna food build brother. LOL No surprise to catch one at "meat week" no less.
---
Yeah definitely
---
Wait... you mean your GF didn’t make you a Happy 1st Sheepsquatch Kill Cake???? What’s this world coming to? lol
---
Winter Man isn't rare on Xbox, got duped to the max and I assume it's the same on PS4/PC. Goblin+jester are bloody mythical though.
---
Should be easy enough since I'm used to doing it with the single shot handmade right now.
---
It and any other weight reduction perk will never affect your stash
---
You’d think they would stick with one system. WTF. Sometimes I wonder if they just grab code out of a hat and roll with it.
---
The same happened to me, I hoped there would be a final cooking event, but I did suspect the meat collected in the last hour might be wasted. At least I got a couple of legendaries to scrip from the Ash Heap. It does not look like there is much that can be done with the meat other than eating it or throwing it away. I guess in theory one could play other character(s) until Meat Week returns, and then turn in the months old meat, but for most that would not be worth it for the few scrip.
---
It’s so much more difficult now to get ganked or griefed given player complaints that lead to game changes and nerfs.  
---
How quickly people forget the one shot (TSE) death squads and slap damage and camp damage.  Prior to survival and NW there was far more of that type of behavior.  Forget PvP if you haven’t accepted a team invite only to have said team fast travel to your camp and kill you and destroy your camp you haven’t played long enough.
---
13k?? How much scrip can we have at once?
---
I saw a lvl 700+ today. Whenever I see a crazy high level I find there camp and travel there. They usually have some pretty cool shit.
---
*cries in year 1*
---
Yes, More caps = inflation. 
---
 I think you despise mules because like many players, you don’t have a reliable friend to assist you.
---
if you're on ps4 i can mod it for you. If not, stick at the quest, it's worth it in the end, i promise!
---
&gt;but were not slowing down yet!
---
You havent done shit. This game is dead now. I dont even care about wastelanders anymore.
---
Take this as my goodbye from this sub 👋🏻
---

---
I don't know where the down votes for your post are coming from, but you talked about people not liking PvP. That isn't what's being discussed here, people dislike being forced or coerced into it. That's the discussion being had here, that they should have separate game modes for those who want to PvP and those who don't.
---
If you've completed the Mayor for a Day quest, they become passive to you. Some people don't do it because the rumor is you get more XP killing them when they are hostile. Haven't confirmed this myself.
---
I know, right? That would be just awful for everyone.
---
it would neep a cap though as without that you could get up to +19 to all special and 95% damage boost.  That's nuts.  
---
That said imo it should just be +10% per mutation up to a cap of 30% on weapons and +5 dr/er per up to +20 er/dr on armor.  That would make it a nice middle tier legendary effect that is competetive with bolstering/vanguards/2 shot.
---
Congrats doing that all by yourself!  And btw a sheepsquatch often spawns there.
---
I feel you mate -- over 10k scrip blown only for guns and my best weapon is still the 1* bloodied handmade I bought from another player...
---
In my opinion you either have all the time in the world to play 24/7 or you just took advantage of the xp glitches that were available!!!! Lol!!
---
taking into account opening packs.. it will take roughly 500 lvls give or take a few depending on your rng to max every perk card..
---
if you plug it into nukes and dragons it comes to [542] but that doesn't include cards you get from packs obviously
---
50
---
So THATS why my escape artists isn't working with my stealth PA build.
---
Unbelievable.
---
I mean, Bethesda literally said as much when they announced this:
---
&gt; Vault-Tec has the answer: Project Clean Appalachia! As a former dweller, it is YOUR responsibility to restore the region to its former glory and allow survivors to resettle some of the most beautiful land America has to offer - starting with hazardous wildlife.
---
It's just the "story" behind this event though. Scorched and scorchbeasts will still be around post-Wastelanders.
---
I’d be down for that. Bring back like day 1 original survival mode and I’d be a pretty happy camper, and I’d bet it’d take off a lot of the conflict that’s happening in adventure.
---
Well someone always has to go first lol. Im sure there are other peeps having better luck. I hope sobanyway. Im with you though, imma save for the discount.
---
Rifleman and commando
---
The worst griefer I've dealt with was three players in  a group with mini guns, a Gatlin plasma and pacifist mode turn on.
---
They just kept following me around shooting me.
---
I'm assuming they were trying to bait me into turning off pacifist mode and attacking them so I would become a wanted player, so they could kill me  without penalty. 
---
At least they wasted their ammo.
---
I was lucky enough to find a vendor who was selling a quad capacity explosive for 5k caps. I didn't hesitate to purchase!
---
Challange Accepted!!!! lol
---
Yeah I thought so too, but I remembered being attacked by the robots a while after I finished that quest when I was visiting the watoga shopping center. It's only today that I noticed the robots are not attacking me.
---
I guess the bug was the game not recognizing me completing the quest?
---
1k per character at a max of 5 characters per one game account. At least three accounts basically.
---
Heard of was like 50k
---
Personally I’d like to see it as a drop of you know how to make it.  Then make it learned by scrapping (100% chance) but a bind on pickup item (i.e. like an atom shop weapon) when crafted.  That way it’s initially a sellable item for a lucky dweller, and afterwards the lucky ones can craft it and then have it as a potential legendary drop.  Keep it rare, but something we’d actually see people use.
---
which quest?
---
No it isn't
---
It's to cover the load of the Wastelanders instancing.
---
I would hope these events are indeed leading up to the release of Wastelanders sometime in November, although the lack of new information, and features like the legendary player system being delayed to 2020 are somewhat worrying.
---
I would keep the Executioner's Gatling and not worry about the bigger magazine. The extra capacity adds weight but I've never run the standard magazine dry in a fight (unless I ran out of ammo). There's plenty of time to reload its 250 rounds mid-battle. 
---
The .50s are great, but they use ammo quickly. Not bad if you want to spend some playtime farming components. The 5mm round is carried by many super mutants and the Gatling ROF is pretty conservative with ammo. I haven't made 5mm in weeks, but I always have 2-4k on hand.
---
I'd keep the Zealot's 10mm for use in low areas. Ammo is plentiful and if you can get some Commando perks the SMG is pretty good. VATS efficient, too.
---
Edit: Mods for the Gatling are pretty easy to learn by scrapping.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Because they’re ignorant and TSE is the word they know. They probably have a better weapon already, but they don’t know better. I saw someone trading off some anti armor, junkie and furious guns trying to get a TSE combat rifle. I wanted to chime in with advice to keep his guns, but experience and education are bad words on the internet.
---
Send me an invite I’d be happy to join in sometime. Usually only on Friday and Saturday nights though
---
Edit ign: Transorbital
---
You make a good point. I'm probably better off trying to get a rolled legendary bear arm. 
---
I could switch to a different unarmed, but I just liked the bear arm idea. It looks sweet. Might switch to a heavy gun medic build for my wife.
---
The menu has been total crap on Xbox forever. I can't comment on area chat as I've never used it.
---
You guys are crazy.  At our current rate we should get 50% discount which means the weapon type you want for 50 scrip when you recycle to get 40 back.  Mystery pick at 60 is a dud imho.
---
My opinion over about 500 or 600 probably cheated. If you add all my toons up, even deleted ones, I would have 600 lvls.  Take into account low levels are much faster, if I only played 1 toon maybe 550. Oh and I think cheaters suck.
---
Thankfully, over the few week or so I've been playing the game, thats only happened once or twice for me.
---
In theory, Wastelanders is coming in less than 2 months now. There is still time to begin revealing more until only a few weeks before release, but I do wonder about the possibility of a delay.
---
Was up till 6 am last night lol. It’s a fun event. Always something to do, but the reward for prime meat is a little weak.
---
Honestly at least when the TSE death squads were rolling I still felt somewhat competitive. I will never forget level 84 me trying to defend my workshop from a lvl 11 with a shotgun. I was in full X-01 and have a TS lever action ( that I still use ) and was doing fuck all damage while he killed me in two hits. 
---
Or the time more recently when at lvl 115 I watched a single lady in a red dress with a sliver of health murder me an four friends, even though two of us had TSE's and all the perk cards for the weapon. 
---
At this point I'm just venting, but not since the games launch have I had a decent PvP experience, and I get it. People use specific builds, which is totally fine. I don't want to use a specific build and I'm paying the price for it, but I also don't claim workshops and always keep pacifist on. Flash forward to a friend joining me who doesn't have it on, and now we're getting murdered left and right because someone jumped in front of him while we were fighting a scorchbeast. ( True story )
---
The grievance is this; 
---
There are places specific to PvP, ( workshops ) and events tailored to it. People playing without Pacifist and etc.. 
---
No one hates that. What people hate, and complain about, is those people who go out of their way to FORCE you to engage with them. I absolutely don't see an issue with having PvP and PvE servers.
---
Collect tonnes of junk and unlock 45 modifications

I hadn't thought about Duke Nukem in years.  All of the other words that went through my head would have been censored thoroughly.
---
No no, not +1 one special per mutation.... +1 if you ARE mutated. So each piece of armor only gives you a +1 to each special for a grand total of +5 special if all 5 pieces of armor is a mutants. I didn't suggest DR because we already have vangaurds for full life builds. And if you read my write up I did yesterday provided in the link, you can see why stacking DR becomes redundant.at a certain point.
---
And 2% damage per mutation....since there are.19 mutations you could only get  a 38% increase if you had all of them. 5 mutations would get you a 10% increase. Not sure how you got 95%
---
Here's a link to my DR post

---
West team still works? I thought I read somewhere that it wasn’t good any more. I go to the Charleston capitol building level 30+ section. There’s usually 1-3 legendary ghouls there.
---
Haha, bullet sink.  That is a great description.
---
If you are lucky, you may get a weapon for 60 instead of 100. This is good if you do not mind getting either a weapon or armor, but it is not good if you are not interested at all in one type of weapon (melee or ranged).
---
I think it still works

She was working on grad school work.  I did at least make her watch a few shots.  She laughed when she saw I was posting this on reddit.
---
I'll have to ask her if she will make me a Happy 1st Sheepsquatch Kill Cake.  When she asks why, I'll say because that's what is supposed to happen.  The forums said so!
---
the plan for the gun, sure.  now go and learn every mod for it and report back your findings! :P
---
You still haven't answered the question: player death exposes _what_ inadequacy, exactly? Instead of deflecting with irrelevant information, just explain what you meant.
---
Idk but dont blame bethesda. As me and others fought the queen on Xbox1 about a hr ago and there was a few there in full Strangler heart and they were not having any issues. And no one lagged what so ever.

---
If you’re trying to hit a moving target, only one projectile will hit most of the time. Given that the damage is divided equally between the two bullets, it’s a net loss overall.
---
If you shoot everything point blank or exclusively fight the sides of barns, you’re good to go with two shot.
---
Are you doing it more than once a day?
---
then you should agree with the option of buffing it, so the modding service would be more sought after.
---
I think it's because I've been in watoga the last 2 days and they've been attacking me. When I complete the mission I'll probably still shoot them anyways because a lot of them have lead scrap,and because I'm not going to forget the way they treated me last time I was in the city..
---
I like everything about Grahm's cook and the events. With the die-no-drop-junk, and the no-pvp-bullying, and the cool Atomic shop items shared with characters in same account I think Fallout 76 is the greatest.
---
I saw that when I checked the wiki to see how much ammo I really used.  4500 HP plus the legendary mutation.  33 damage except for the 6th one which was a critical hit at around 80.  The math doesn't work out in my head, but it might've been over 200 rounds.
---
Talking about buffing, I think Tommy Gun and Assault Rifle need to be buffed, too. These have their own characteristics though, these are just too weak in damage wise
---
Could you have accidentally aggro'd them with a stray shot, explosive effect, or one of the melee retaliatory mutations? When you do, they don't all turn like ones at the Whitespring, just the one you hit. I don't know if being teammates with someone who is aggro'd to them does it to you or not like it would in PvP.
---
Yea I have to hold back my damage in mine so acid won’t stack too fast. It sucks. Hopefully they fix it soon

None of the friends I met on 76 play, anymore. Hit me up if you are on xbone (gt=texware). I'm level 106 or 107. I could use some company!

It is absolutely Bethesdas fault... they've known about it for a while. It's not a system spec problem. It's a game bug
---
Sheepsquatch are very strong when encountered in the wild or in Arktos as 3\*'s, but they're pushovers at the Free Range event, where they're one-stars and  a half-dozen people are unleashing fire at where the sheepsquatch might appear.
---
Ask them and they will likely say different. It happens anytime you are using automatic weapons.
---
I haven’t had a friends list in game since the last update
---
Where are these traps?
---
Trade only, don't put up for caps. Also if you do put up for caps, get more than max caps for it
---
Well mutants on weapons isn’t an auto scrip, but mutants on armor is
---
If that were the case, it'd get hotfixed instantly.
---
On the other side i have a furious explosive gatling that i love. I would suggest sticking with the furious and maxing out the perks. Do you want more damage on the front end or the back end? Both have their place. Bear? Arms perk you can carry them all. Executioners for SBQ and PVP against bloodies and furious for everything else.
---
Edit: Oh and the AA .50 is gangsta. Definitely keep it. But you're gonna be on that lead/steel/acid grind forever.
---
Dude. 
---
This one is great too. 
---
From now one I'm collecting all the baby bottles and salt I can find. 
---
I will scrap my junk item per item to preserve all the baby botles but I'm going to drop it in front of every person which try to melee me. 
---
Thanks. You are great.
---
Usually not here for the wall-of-text story but the headline was a definite hook and as others have stated 0 mention of server DC. bravo.
---
Can confirm. I've accidentally gotten my stash up to 805 before. I've tried to figure out how out of curiosity.
---
I've been scrip lower-level legendaries in hope for good melee but I'm not sure it's going to be as good as my grognaks or powerfist (not legendaries) but it doesn't hurt to see. If it sucks I'll probably just give it away or something
---
If you are near the cap and need to spend scrip regardless.
---
:-)
---
Yeah I suppose. My problem With the mule thing is I feel like it's cheating some how. 
---
My suggestion has the same positives as muling, but with a downside to balance it out.
---
The friends list hasn't worked right since they introduced meat week the first time. I think it's quite telling that they introduced meat week again and it's still broken.
---
Definitely wouldn't sell.  Had they not nerfed the shotguns, I'd never part with it.
---
que?
---
That’s actually promising 
---
Wonder if there will be a different game world for it for people who have just started the game so that they can experience the dead open world of year one full of scorched and then choose to move on
---
I have been running Standard and Expert the last two days as well as multiple Standard runs for Washout last week.
---
I have not received plans for these runs.  Currently only missing the Power Armor Torso.
---
Other raid members have noted they are not getting plans either.
---
Rewards including Vault Steel and 3\* in the chest are properly gained.
---
Guess I'm not doing mystery pick, then, since they're out of the office on weekends as evidenced by the lack of kill count updates during Clear the Skies. Legendary melee weapons are useless without swing speed, legendary 3-star armor is 60 scrip anyway and I'm using a melee build and have the shotgun I need to force Scorchbeasts to land with Enforcer, so I don't care about ranged weapons (I've got a god roll 3-star 10mm SMG and decent laser and plasma guns sitting in my STASH anyway).
---
Might as well just save the scrip for the sale and roll for cheaper 3-star armor, I scored a SS Supressor's Death Tambo the other day to finally replace my SS Mutant's Meat Hook that had an awful durability roll, got my SS Sheepsquatch Staff and SS Shishkebab last week, so I'm good on weapons for now.
---
oh no, another bug
---
If you are able to make stashes you should be required to bury them around your camp or hide them somewhere in your house.
---
That doesn't start until the 17th so even if you blow all your scrip today there's enough time to get your full 1000 back twice over and then some.
---
Ok, I get it. There's an xp glitch to exploit somewhere... but WHAT kind of psychotic episode does one need to have to KEEP DOING IT past level 100 ? I've seen (and made) builds that need to get to 70 or more, but good lord. Is this the guy who successfully atom farmed the "collect wood 7600 times" quest?
---
the quest to unlock all the Radium mods, it's a corker!

I saw you in game a few days ago.  Nice camp!

When does their weekend start? Its thursday, I mean that would explain why things take a while if they start their weekends on Thursdays.
---
I tried using a bunch of quick walls mid battle to shield me like fortnite but it's just too slow to actually place em. Spoiler alert, I died.
---
The sick/puking emoji comes in handy too 😂
---
Haha, they seriously did this again?
---
Ha ha!  Thanks!  I figured I'd get a lot of looks with the title and then they'd look at the 'wall-of-text' and then move along.
---
Thank you! Appreciate it!
---
I already did this. Still gonna kill some scorched.
---
No. If it's easy then everyone already has it. Talking non sense man. I dont want to be a master at everything. I want to use the players in the world be become stronger.
---
Game is already way to focused on single player.
---
The way it works, from digging into the ESM, is that it rolls a random number to select a plan first. If you already know the plan selected or if the plan is in your player inventory or stash, then it doesn't award it. So if you are only missing a couple plans, you are just repeatedly rolling empty slots and are not getting anything. Eventually it will land on the one you are missing.
---
SMGs are lackluster endgame.  It sounds like you are looking for endgame.
---
The AA 50 is the best of the heavies you have listed.  Keep it, get rid of the rest. 
---
If you really like the gatling, keep the furious  The executioners is garbage, the fights this effect will help on, the AA 50 will still be more effective due to the DR of the bosses that make the exe viable.  The extra damage on the Exe is wasted if you cant get past boss level DR (SBQ, Sheep, Arctos).  For lesser enemies, the furious will tear through them just as quick, so the extra Exe damage is lost as by the time an enemy is at 50% with the furious, you should be at stack cap already, so the furious will be equal or greater than the exe.
---
Ditch the SMG and pick up a combat rifle or a handmade (stay away from radium or assault), as you can swap these between a full auto or semi auto build later if you want to try different styles.
---
The heavies that dominate endgame bosses right now are the mini, 50 and gatling plas/lasers.  The standard gatling has a lower DPS due to its fire rate.  The higher per shot damage doesnt pan out like a plethera of bullets from the others in its class.  It really is the lowest of the heavies rung, beating the broadsider, but not much else.   This is just my advice, based on personal opinion, from numerous tests with heavies of all types (been a heavy  user since January).
---
Heirarchy of legendary effects = Bloodied&gt;AA&gt;Furious&gt;all others (which are usually situational).
---
It sounds like you will need to start the vendor hop from player vendor to player vendor to find the weapons that will hold you up to the standard you are looking for.  Combat rifles and Handmades dominate the rifleman/commando perk trees.   Minis/.50/Gat Plas/lasers dominate heavies.  Melee its all about what you have access to, look at the legendary effects, melee is OP and its not about the weapon but the build.
---
Disconnects and crashes are your only issues? I wanted to love this game, and I gave it a solid run, but it feels like a letdown to me. It just *didn't* work.
---
Haha! That would be an awesome GF... make sure she knows that... might help! ...lol
---
Hit up nukes and dragons and plan out a build. 
---
Sell/scrap what you aren’t using. 
---
Always do events. Public events now are free to join/fast travel too.
---
If you aren’t planning on pvp don’t claim workshops.
---
Always carry a back up weapon. 
---
Lastly enjoy yourself.
---
It's not you, it's her.

Yes weekend deal 60 scrip for random 3*
---
Well I think most of us can all relate to our parents and significant others looking down on the true accomplishment of taking down your very own sheepsquantch
---
Storm door / basements would be cool. Like a little 5X5 under your camp for all the benches and small stuff. Basically a small vault.
---
Several times. Either people don’t want it or there isn’t enough hype to make relevant
---
Open your quest lists from your pip boy. Under this you can toggle to show the location on your map 😉. This should help!
---
I can't say that I have noticed much of a difference lately as far as my own CAMP is concerned. 90% of the time, I spawn outside my CAMP radius and across the river from where I have everything set up. The remaining 10% I spawn either in the river or outside my CAMP radius but at least on the right side of the river. The only thing I've noticed is that I lately tend to spawn further away when travelling to other people's CAMPs.
---
I'm just not overly confident in their ability to fix this by tomorrow afternoon before everyone goes home based on the current state of the game and its unaddressed bugs that have been present for months.
---
I thought you only get rewarded once a day
---
I've been having less crashes than usual lately on pc. Maybe one a day. I haven't been doing the meat cook though. I wasn't thrilled with it last time so i didn't bother at all with it this time. I good primal cuts or whatever a few times for fun when i saw nobody else was doing it, but that's it.
---
I have decided to just put it up for sale.  Ill stick with my TSE Handmade.
---
This sounds super cool!
---
complete mayor for a day, and most robots will ignore you.
---
You will run across exceptions as you are exploring certain areas of the city, but I won't spoil that surprise :)
---
There is a website (Nukesdragon ) that has a build planner that might be useful for you to have an idea of what perks are in the game and how I want to build my character.(side note many players run a bloodied build which uses low health to boost stats and damage so players with next to no health run these)
---
Radicool
---
Halloween Hazmat Suit would be so cool. A black one with skeletal bones crudely painted on. I’d wear that shit forever.
---
No.
---
But speaking of crafting the CAMP system is going to need a search feature soon like Minecraft has. Any character of around 100th level has plans to a couple hundred objects, especially if they've purchased one or more atom packs.
---
except i have to empty an entire clip of my bloodied radium into a lvl 68 SCORCHED to drop it.
---
I shoot it twice with a lever and it drops (not bloodied).
---
How is this a good weapon again, it uses the same ammo.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
For all your Appalachian chronicles that srs bsns players did months ago.
---
Interesting. What mutant weapon are you using? 
---
Mutant weapons are auto scrip for me. I don't think there's a base item or set of affixes that can save a mutant weapon from the scrip pile. You're just losing too much damage with that mere +10% primary affix. 
---
On the other hand, a mutant's heavy combat armor piece with powered and sentinel is still a very valuable piece.
---
I was in a similar boat as you.  I used to go around killing them back when they could be legendary, but at some point after that changed I completed the may for a day questline.  
---
I'd heard that they become unhostile after that, but the few times I poked my hear out there they were all still red, so I assumed I'd heard wrong.  Eventually I figured out that they're both red *and* passive, but for a while I was convinced otherwise.  Maybe you just assumed like I did?
---
I still go over there every so often and pop a few of them for old time's sake, but it's not as much fun now.  I've heard that if you kill enough of them, reinforcements (higher level Gutsy's) show up that *can *be legendary, but I haven't verified that either :P
---
I'd be happy if they just had a better chance to spawn as three stars. I swear 85% or more of the ones I encounter in the wild are one stars. Barely worth the bullets it takes to kill them for 3-5 scrip.
---
Reddit cares!  I saw my first one this weekend and ran the other direction. I was on a quest to make friends with a deathclaw, and from a distance that’s what I thought it was. Boy was I wrong!
---
I gave up on Meat Week the second time I failed the Bog Primal Cuts because no one else showed up and the timer ran out because everything kept wandering off to chase other mobs and I couldn't chase them down in time (melee player). I just used the events for free map travel to do dailies this time thanks to the new public events system.
---
The economy is completely random. 
---
It's not uncommon to see someone sell something for 70 caps, another sell the same for 700, and another player 7000.
---
I don't know if max caps is inflating prices, or the lack of consistent prices is driving everything up.
---
Isn't this what the collection bot does?
---
Not an unusual approach, but it's lazy and a crappy way to deal with the drops.  It makes it so you have to run the event a silly number of times in the hopes of completing all the sets.
---
?????
---
You know it's not a shotgun, right? The Fixer is a combat rifle.
---
So I have managed to track down and scrap 2 bayonet mods and still haven’t unlocked the mod for crafting. Is scrapping the mod not guaranteed to learn it or is it still a random chance?
---
I've had very few if any disconnects the last month.
---
On PC.
---
I just try to be fair in everything I sell, caps are not hard to get so I am not out to take anyone. If I dont need it, I will sell it at a very fair price :)
---
Ok. So when I say game world. I'm talking about the setting created. It has nothing to do with textures. 
---
It's varied, it's interesting, full of passive story telling. Incorporates nice references nice little nods to WV's history and folk lore. Obviously the cryptozoological ones are obvious. But the dispute between miners and companies using robots for instance is a nice take on revolving history regarding WV coal wars of the early 1900's. A personal favourite touch was the Sickleman reference.
---
Textures aside. The actual world building, the setting, is pretty excellent. The ability to tell stories through a few small little details in some random location, isn't easy. 
---
Discounting the quality of a built world as a setting, because of textures, is like reading LotR, and saying middle Earth isn't compelling because the type face of the book was too small.
---
They saw the purveyor legendary stuff working better so they switched to it for most things. They forgot about stuff like that chest because before 94 there were none like it
---
Sorry, the only outfit I ever wear is my Ritual Bindings and Cultist Headpiece. Wise Mothman wills it.
---
(I hope they add some swanky Cult of the Mothman duds to the shop sometime soon, I'm tempted to nab that new raider outfit, but I don't know how it'll look with my Cultist Headpiece. There needs to be a preview mode for trying things on.)
---
I'll be sure to let you know if I can assemble a team during those days.
---
Siege has not confirmed that cross play is coming
---
PC players would destroy console players in a competitive setting for having kb/mouse alone.
---
I'm sorry your loved ones don't care about your secret super life. You didn't mention the pee, did you?
---
Upvoted.
---
PC here. Servers have been very stable for me for a while now. Just have the ingame bugs to contend with.
---
I definitely enjoyed it, but yeah the list of rewards needed to be much longer.
---
You just described the scavenger bot.
---
I think the nature of the PVP mechanics and the duel system in adventure mode makes PVP griefier. At least in survival mode if someone was trying to sneak up on you or reject the event to bust it up you can start shooting them right away. I knew if I saw a guy with a red arrow trying to sneak into UFever that he wanted to attack me so I could prepare myself or just shoot him at the doorway. Or if I wanted to avoid I could quickly FT away (cat and mouse haha) If they reject the event they are immediately hostile and no one has the pacifist mode advantage. Very little trickery in that regard. But in adventure mode you really don't know what peoples intentions are until they sucker punch you.
---
On Xbox. Have randomly disconnected/game shuts down/ crashed a bit more than usual the passed few days. I wouldn't necessarily say the game is getting worse, as much as I think people's patience with the game is wearing thin.
---
Why do I have a feeling like he’s talking about his own Camp lol. All proud and wants to tell someone.
---
I’ve had the same problem for absolutely ages.  (89 days) Tried all the work arounds that I’ve found here and there but nothing worked.  Gave up in the end tbh
---
Very well could be, also noticed for the last week there is up to a 1 second delay for mobs to die, then after about 15 minutes it goes back to normal.
---
Color me stupid..... I thought it was a shotgun from day one.  It would still be far more useful to someone else though.  Thanks for the Intel though my man.
---
richochet works in PA.
---
It's a long list. Check the wiki.
---
Where do you find the wedding ring
---
Ok based on what, i have seen ppl selling the grenade plans, i haven’t seen ppl selling the DCG extra claw plan...
---
Or are you suggesting there is something rarer than that...
---
How is that helpful if the game states that itself?
---
"Not in Power armor" is in all those perk cards besides sneak and escape artist.
---
I appreciate their 5 minute effort to type all perks down.
---
Just do both. Hang on to your duds from this sale and turn them in over the next few weeks. That plus any new legendaries you acquire should get you back to the limit pretty easily.
---
Bring up the challenges menu. Identify challenges you are closest to completion or can be easily completed. Then track a few of those by hitting the Track key or button.  Just the act of working these will give your wanderings some direction and some instant gratification as you burn them down.
---
No that's just it, I haven't seen people sell or much less try to acquire it. I'm quite active on xbox lfg and the trading subreddit and have never seen anyone ask for the dcg extra claw plan
---
I started playing Easter weekend (on PS4) and am currently 235. With a lvl 62 alt. I don't play my alt much but my main I play everyday. I run whatever daily quests are up for the day and try and do all the daily and weekly challenges. I play maybe 3 hours a day and do the lvl up challenge everyday as well. I just get it with one lvl by wearing the clothes and whatever other condition is easiest. I've never used any experience glitches or exploits, I just play a lot. While lvl 900 is excessive, if he has been playing a lot everyday since the beta I can see him reaching that without cheating. I get usually half a lvl a day questing and it takes me about 45 mins after killing mutants to get the other half.
---
Damn, still haven't gotten that Tenderizer after 2 meat weeks.....
---
Ah ok, i was lied to by Coreross
---
More events like that are good.  But as with fasnacht ? Encryptid and now Meat Week the problem is the endgame of the events. 
---
Look at how fashacht was. People were hyped about doing it. And once they realized the odds of getting the rare masks it was just trolling and over all avoiding it. 
---
Same with Encryptid. Albeit with pinheads for teammates. 
---
Now look at Meat Week. People are not doing the main event solely because the prime events give far more over the chance to fail. 
---
But yes more events like them are good. Just need to find a way to make worth the investment on time.
---
Oh. So a legendary explosive heavy gun will work, just not actual default explosive guns? Ok thanks for clarifying
---
Same, I believe I got everything else.
---
you clearly did not read what I wrote so let me try again:
---
I advocated either - make the gun stronger so the grind for the mods is worth it --OR-- leave it as it is and make the mods easier to learn.
---
So once again, if they left the mods hard to learn as they are now, but then buffed the gun so that it's not objectively worse than a handmade it becomes more desirable.  If it's more desirable people providing weapon modding service for this gun would get more people using their service to mod it.
---
Does that make sense?
---
As it sits nobody with a handmade will ever use these in game player service providers because RR's are objectively worse than handmades and fixers.
---
At the moment being a radium rifle mod expert is like being the best VHS recorder repair man in town when everyone is streaming.
---
You are joking, right? Damage is ballistic primarily, so no problem to kill
---
Unlike the other train station vendors, this one offers a different service, and should be marked differently. There's no reason NOT to.
---
That armor is for pvp which no longer exists. Genius game design right there.
---
PC or Xbox, I have yet to buy FO76 on my Ps4 :(
---
I've only seen it as a legendary effect, then again I haven't been looking for it.
---
I absolutely loved reading this.
---
Congratulations!
---
Its not in running with a handmade.. The assault rifle is. Radium competes with combat rifle...
---
So no.. Nothing you have said makes any sense... Except "make game ez"
---
Have you seen any of the modder u/yabvone’s posts? Off the top of my head i see about 3 ppl per week requesting it the part of their posts...
---
Check camps, I got lucky and got 2 for like 200 caps
---
I don't think there is a food or drink that provides poison resistance. Astonishly Awsome Tales #9 and Grognak the Barbarian #3 magazines both  provide +15 poison resistance for 2 hrs.
---
Poisoner's armor pieces are the other way to go...
---
&gt; stealth PA
---
uh what
---
I would even like not being able to equip armor I find. Like, mod it first, then you can wear it.
---
lag and instability are part of online gaming. 
---
I could spend the next 5 hours explaining to you how packet loss across a worldwide network affects stability and data consistency, but I dont feel like boring you all with technojargon half will only mildly understand, and the rest will look at as a foreign language.  So here are some cliff notes.
---
Lag and instability pop up more when there are special events taking place (IE: Meat Week).  Special events usually cause more playtime across the board (contsant players play more, casual players log in for the events more, which means more people on the network). This causes more packets of information transferring from client side to host side.  When more information is transfered, more information is lost.  When data packets are lost or corrupted, you get bugs, lag and instability. 
---
Most of this has nothing to do with client side or host side system stability, but much more to do with local and national infrastructures.   The more rural you are, the more hubs your data  needs to pass through, which means more chance you lose data packets.  The closer you are to a hub, the less likely you will lose data packets.   This is why some areas experience a higher % of instability and lag issues than some people in other areas, they have more infrastructure to travel through, so there is a higher % of packet loss.   
---
When a system experiences packet loss, and the packet is important data, then it could cause the game to crash, or lag, or seem "jumpy"
---
The game has gotten much better, but as is  true with all online games, there will be instability when a new patch or special content is released.  Devs dont have an internal structure to test the network viability of 100,000 users all playing at the same time.   They test with like 10 people.
---
As an example.  I also play Neverwinter, which had a huge patch this week as well.   The boards were ripe with complaints about instability, lag, and disconnects.    This is usually a very stable smooth running game.   But a new patch came out, and everyone and their brother logged back in again, putting strain on the network.  and OMG, lag happened. 
---
This is a indusrty wide issue that has been happening in online gaming since the 90s.  Everyone thinks its the game and the devs, but most times it couldnt be further from the truth. 
---
Try packing \`100 pounds of dogfood into a bag designed to carry 50 pounds, then give the 50 pound bag an exit that purges half a pound an hour.   You pour in 5 pounds an hour so what will eventually happen, is the bag will overflow and the system will stop.    This in effect is what happens with lag.  Albeit a bit more technical, but the theory is still the same.
---
The existence of the Super-Duper perk would probably cause some coding issues with a “craft all” option. Unless crafting all would disable that perk, in which case I’d opt for the sore thumb haha
---
It's not supposed to. Otherwise people will put on all the weight reduction perks, cram their stash full and unequipped them and break the stash limitations. That doesn't sound like a fun way to interact with the stash system.
---
25% when it hits.  That’s the key.   I’d rather hit on every shot.  There’s a better prefix than Two-Shot for every gun/build. TSE is sold at “god weapon” prices, but it’s a mediocre combination at best.  I know I won’t ever use any TS weapon.  They suck horribly.
---
&gt; should of
---
I'm really on the fence about PA current state.
---
When I first started the game, I thought it was OP. Super high DR, and mandatory for nuke zones. Now it's only 'as necessary' as the Legendary effects generally outweigh the offset in DR.
---
If they did add Legendary PA, it would need to have different modifiers.
---
Same. Thanks for the mod plans Mr. Graham, but i need the damn weapon first to mod it!
---
I’ll join you add me PSN: kappers_1
---
I was playing for a few hrs last night, then suddenly got disconnected...after that for about 30minutes, I couldn't get a stable connection, and got disconnected a couple of times during the login/finding world process., then it cleared up...in general though, my connections on xbox have been pretty stable.
---
You do know that the radium rifle is borderline an smg right?
---
I don’t have time....
---
I did it with a flame trap and got 2k aluminum from it. I tossed most of it but still have about 800 left
---
I am running around in the bloody chef outfit with a sackhood and chainsaw. Chainsaw users unite!
---
I just don’t see the big deal. No other icon on the map says what stuff is available there.
---
Yeah, I just don’t get it.  If you just use a TSE weapon, it’s pretty obvious they suck.  Unless you are shooting at 5 ft range, TSE is garbage.  I’ll buy TSE to flip for profit, but I’ll never use one.
---
&gt; PA is for lamers 
---
You're probably one of those so called stealth commandos that press Q spacebar lmb at every encounter pve pvp alike? I know man..Lamer or not, at least I have to use my own aiming skills to play the game.
---
As the other user stated it's required for max damage with heavy guns because of the stabilized card, you're one hell of idiot for writing that lol.
---
Besides my strangler heart PA has something you can never see on your sneak armor such as acid damage that goes over all your super stimpaks, sentinel, lone wanderer and what not. ;)
---
Yeah you find that manager and give him a piece of your mind, Karen!
---
So I'm new to the game. I was able to get 100 scrip during meat week I'm guessing that I shouldn't spend it till I'm level 50 right?
---
I could be wrong but excavator with calibrated shocks is more weight than that. I have 496 lbs with excavator.
---
And the controls... My god the PC contols are something out of first year programmer who lied to get into community collage... Then dropped out cause it was too hard.
---
Non existent anymore
---
Non existent
---
You ever heard of stealth boy torso mod? 
---
That's the only clue I got about "stealth PA" lol
---
Kill many legendary creatures and you will get many legendarys
---
It works like Chameleon armor, so it only helps if you're like a sniper.
---
it might take a bit for the effect to change over from kill on sight to passive.  But after you complete that quest eventually this is normal: red dots that don't attack unless you shoot first.  
---
If you followed the mayor for the day quest it's spelled out the entire reason for completing the quest is to make the robots passive so you can chill there.
---
It's the same for grenade launchers, I use a two shot 40 mm launcher instead of the auto when I need to burn through grenades.  It definitely hits with two actual grenades, and it's super fun when it launches the super mutant corpse into space with the second explosion.  I wonder what the ceiling is where it never comes down.
---
Cheaper legendaries means our stash gets full and we are over encumbered that much faster, forcing people who don’t have mules to stop playing. This is a problem that needs to be solved.
---
Don't forget to place it where you can still travel to Overgrown Sundew Grove and Dropsite V9 so that you can fight the queen outside of the nuke zone!
---
Yes, if they are wanted and you are not in pacifist and have unstoppable isotope or are electrically charged, they can initiate PvP with you. Old school trick, also if someone randomly trades with you, they will exit out of the screen real quick while you are pressing R2 to scroll through the menu causing you to hit them and also initiate PvP. Yes this is what the game has come to lol smh
---
First off, my sympathies to you for your mostly poor luck with RNG.
---
This is why don't even bother with script.  
---
I just sell off unwanted legendaries for a fair (I hope) price. I'd rather  just have tho extra caps and buy what I want outright from other players.
---
only real use for that is levelling up an alt.  seems like a fair price to me.
---
Marathoner is a surprise to me. Stopped running that a long time ago though, so lol.
---
Personally I have found it to be better than ever. I've been playing since the beta but took a few months off during the summer. I started playing again about 2 weeks ago and I have only been disconnected a few times and not while I was in the middle of something critical.   
---
I'm on PS4.
---
I’m fine with the level 50’s being one star (but they should have the chance at being higher), the level 80’s should definitely be 3 stars.
---
There are plenty of unique icons, do you even use the map? Almost every single place has it's own unique icon. Are you talking about a different game and just don't realize it?
---
I got a b ss +1s switch blade off a ghoul at the whitespring just a couple days ago.
---
Lol I feel for you.
---
How do you guys get the legendaries? Because I'll get maybe 3 to 5 an hour, but they're usually one star. 
---
That's not a lot of scrip.
---
Go to Data -&gt; Events -&gt; Reject the active event.
---
Fixes it.
---
I want new episodes :( Fake or not, I loved it.
---
This will only work if you have one Salvagetron there where everytime it's his turn he goes 'yuuuuup'
---
Yes please! 🎃
---
I don't think it's ever worked from day one
---
They are talking about purveyor drops. So far 100% to get 50 limb from her. Last time purveyor was ok and the world drops were 100% 50 limb.
---
So the problem mutated just in time for mystery picks. :(
---
Oh, I'm on PS4!
---
When they’re going down for a planned reboot you’ll see a timer. If it’s a crash, then it’s unplanned, so a timer would be impossible.
---
Hahaha server hop their ass after you kill em and scoop their shit lol
---
Best answer 2019
---
Its ok we're your girlfriend, friends and family now
---
Fair enough it is what it is, do what you wanna do mate like I say I was giving my opinion on what was asked I can max out the daily scrip in 1hr n part of this game is grinding sometime to get what you want if I have to do 10 runs of whitespring or west tek that's what I'm gonna do
---
then they should call it a submachine gun, not a rifle.
---
And it shouldnt have a semi auto functionality.
---
I haven’t used it in a bit, but if you have ffr or explosive it’s very nice
---
Yes!  Came here to say that.
---
It would be pretty neat if Joke Bot were a wandering encounter, too.  We already have the wandering insult bot created by [RobCo and the Watoga High Robotics Club](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/You_have_been_insulted!). Seems a natural to have one sponsored by Perks Gum.  Would be cute if it handed out random gum packets, too.
---
I have a JE combat rifle that blows away my TSE handmade. I only keep the TSE because it's the first weapon i traded for on reddit, so it holds a special place in my heart... but for anyone reading it's yours for a bunch of caps :).
---
I'm glad most others are not as smart as you.
---
It works very well for PvE as well but you have a point.
---
Leader of the pack drops 3. They'll be low level, but that event spawns frequently, and is quick. Just gotta be the one to kill the pack leaders, or be in them with the person that does.
---
What about a wendigo that's still wearing an old Pumpkin Halloween costume?
---
It could lead a bunch of "Tricker-Treater" ghouls that are all dressed up in halloween attire.
---
Maybe because of meatweek. Extra pressure on the servers
---
Has anybody got any melee weapon that is not limb damage? 3900 scrip and every MFing last melee piece... 17 of them !!!! .... have LD with agi or WR...
---
I've had tremendous luck with Whitesprings the past several days.
---
I heard a lot of enemies are immune. I imagine the hp pool difference is also a factor.
---
It's really too bad that this whole clean up the wasteland stuff wasn't also tied into the main quest line regarding certain technologies and certain research that had been going on to deal with the scorch beasts and the scorched.   There were some really cool things in the storyline that could have EASILY been expanded on through events like this leaving the wasteland changed afterwards.
---
😂
---
Wow, for a moment there I thought they might be hard to get.  /s
---
Oh ok
---
Better than the crock of shyte that I got!!
---
Sentimental value is something I can understand. I had to get rid of my first TSE rifle because it was just too heavy to justify keeping as a paperweight.
---
F to Doubt
---
its been brought up.
---
The problem I see would be the mechanism that auto-scraps junk which contains a base component for whatever you are making.   Would the availability of those components-still-embedded-in-junk-items be considered in definition of "all possible" ?
---
(For whatever reason, you may not want to scrap one of those items.)
---
They’ve said, making it so we can camp anywhere (basically) was not at all easy to accomplish. I’m sure they appreciate your thanks. 
---
Imo it’s the best part about this game. Finding a place to live. Making it work from that area. (If desired)
---
Trick or treater ghouls with messed up costumes somewhat makes sense, wendigo not so much as it would probably prevent it from eating.
---
I haven't seen any enemy that was immune yet, although it hp pool does make it hard to tell on very high lvl enemies. It definitely works on the queen though, it melts with the BE gatling plasma but it also freezes your game.
---
I would never do anything like that. I play on pacifist and I'm  always lending a hand to people. I've been grieved and know how it feels to lose everything
---
Yes and no... robots on the outside after completing mayor of the day won’t attack you HOWEVER robots on the inside didn’t get the memo and will...lol
---
How dare they look down upon greatness!?!  They do not understand, that they do not understand!
---
I thought last time they did a special the buyback was also discounted 75%
---
You go in thinking "This is going to be hard, but I should survive."  You end up shouting "Run away.  Run awaaaayy!" like Monty Python.
---
You can always buy peoples shit drops to. Shop around. Mostly 25-50 caps per scrip.
---
So a 1* weapon is 5 scrips... If you find 1* for 125 to 300 caps scoop it up and drop it in the machines.
---
Good way to top off your days worth but don't over buy. I went bananas at some shop with great prices but then realized i didn't have room for them and already turned in my days worth. :(
---
It doesn't, I've tested it. If it did, that plus Emergency protocols would give (at best if additive) 95% DR or (at worst if multiplicative) 78.5% DR.
---
It gives neither.
---
I can't complain about that, my weekend starts at 3pm every Thursday :-)
---
I've been looking for a piece like that for a month, lucky
---
I'm hoping it will finally make my buzzblade worth using.
---
Thanks!  And as long as I can find a safe vantage point from which to hurl my pebbles, you bet!
---
I’m lvl 246 and I love my T60 PA.  I have the BOS paint effects as well along with stealth torso mod and all the other fixings. 
---
In survival I never used it but in adventure I find myself using it more simply because I can carry a lot more stuff including weapons and ammo.
---
I still run like hell from scorchbeasts and I’m a level 53. I don’t have the weapons to kill them
---
If I did to you what I did to my girlfriend BEFORE I got on the xBox, you'd realize why this is basically the best day of my life.
---
😢😢😢 Sadness 😢😢😢
---
I did NOT mention the pee.  I did change my underwear though.  Not my pants, it's not like it got all the way through.
---
I'm 826 and have never used a trap or the vertibird once.  I have had a 15 intelligence and permanent berry mentats since February.  My hours are around 1500. I know a few other guys in the 650-750 area and as far as I know none of them cheat.  
---
If I kill a super mutant warlord at night time with my intelligence I get 540 xp, which is almost like having permanent double xp weekend for non xp builds. 
---
How long the game is out based on what I know you could theoretically do, someone could be 1200 at least without cheating.  I took a fair amount of time off, and do lots of trading.
---
This is probably the best explanation I've seen so far. Bravo. Poor programming and a decades old engine don't help matters any, but the lag would be there regardless.
---
I would also throw in that your bandwidth has a lot to do with it too. I know a lot of people that try to play online games with DSL or similar quality internet, and then don't understand why they are lagging all the time. Those services can barely support streaming videos, let alone the information needed to play a client-side game.
---
Robot companions.
---
"catching up" is a non-factor. Another player being hundreds of levels ahead of you has a much a better chance of benefiting you, anyways.
---
With Wastelanders coming soon, you should get back in and experience the world before things change. Things change, but war...war never changes.
---
Also: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
True, I did think of that. But I figured it wouldn't matter, since realism isn't really all that important for a silly halloween event.
---
Although you could always have it so the pumpkin mask was ripped enough for it to get food into its mouth. lol
---
They already have an excellent version of this in ESO, it even figures out bonus results from crafting, so the same mechanic should be able to factor in super duper for it.
---
I would believe this if this statement wasnt shrouded in dogshit.
---
Actually it’s 34 pounds.  I have the salty tenderizer.  
---
The best thing is my Furious modded fire axe and spikes with 40% swing speed effect is like 50x better and only weighs like 5 pounds lol
---
Maybe make it blind but stupid dangerous and almost impossible to stealth. Like a blind death claw.
---
Doesn't worth but damn looks amazing under the 'kill, laugh, love' neon.
---
I run XO-1 with Stealthboy Torso for SBQ battles and remain Hidden/Caution about 60% of the time while firing a 50 cal, but... I'm also at 19 agility while in PA.

Hi all, due to an issue affecting melee weapons purchased using the Mystery Pick option, we're going to swap out the Mystery Pick Event with a 25% off Sale Event. We've updated Inside the Vault with this info on the website. Here's what we added to the article:
---
&gt; #### Update – 3:30 p.m. EDT October 3:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; After investigating reports from the community, we’ve found that melee weapons purchased using the Purveyor’s Mystery Pick option are only awarding certain legendary effects for legendary melee weapons. The Purveyor’s normal legendary melee options are not affected by this issue. Rather than keep the Mystery Pick option available in this state, we’ve decided to replace it with a new 25% off Sale Event instead so that you can still catch some great deals this weekend. 
---
&gt; **- The Purveyor Sale Event will begin at 4:00 p.m. EDT today, October 3 and it will last until 12:00 p.m. EDT on Monday, October 7.**
---
&gt; We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause for those of you who have already spent Scrip on the Mystery Pick, and we will be sure to kick off a new Mystery Pick Event once the limb damage issue is corrected.
---
It's pretty much in the same state. The majority of the bugs from beta are still active, no real content has been added.
---
I want a legendary alien stick. Oh wait.
---
I would legit pay 1000 atoms for this.
---
Fuck it, I've just thought it over, I'd pay 2000.
---
 Definitely not.  Based on what I know I figure someone could theoretically get over 1200 without cheating.  Permanent berry mentats and bobblehead isn't hard to maintain.

 &gt; Hi all, due to an issue affecting melee weapons purchased using the Mystery Pick option, we're going to swap out the Mystery Pick Event with a 25% off...
---
Clear out Huntersville, west tek, and the national radio array. When you're done server hop and do it again. If you find at least one legendary at Huntersville and the radio array  and three or more at West tek do not leave the server because rng is hot. When that happens check the nar trainyard, flooded trainyard, whitespring, and the steakhouse and by that time locations will have reset and you can run the loop again.   If you are a melee character this is a fantastic way to get 5.56 and fusion cells to hawk in your vendor as well.
---
I’m wearing 5 pieces of wwr armor so mine weighs like 3# but yeah ;D
---
I just hate how they took a bad system from F4 and made it worse. 
---
Less objects to work with, stupid building restrictions and a boatload of bugs.
---
That and you can't build anywhere interesting or within a half mile of another player.
---
My RP Character is a vampire so...
---
But besides SBQ where you don't have to move, how do you even use that build?
---
EDIT: Nevermind, you're not the original comment, so I assume you only use it for SBQ.
---
It is definitely a good time to get back in. You should have enough time to go at your own pace and level/explore/experience the story as it is before Wastelanders. Then when it comes out, you should have some nice new stuff to experience.
---
Confirmed server hopping does NOT fix the issue with shotguns.  I've always loved shotgun builds in Fallout games, and this bug has essentially ruined the fun of my main character in FO76.  Friggin' bummer.
---
Where do you get the witch's dress from? I have found witch's hats but no dresses
---
how is that going to work with super duper?
---
Enlighten us sir.  Inquiring minds want to know!
---
Yep, pretty damn annoying.
---
I got a full set of lvl 1 unyielding armor and I could level a guy up to 50 in an afternoon.  No need to cheat if you know how some things work.
---
Did you read what I wrote? I said nothing about unique icons. Every town has the same icon. Every train station has the same icon. Every tower has the same icon. Even though different resources may be at one town vs another there is no indication of such on the map. My point is the map does not tel you why resources or what NPCs exist at a given location. Why does the purveyor need to be the exception?
---
It would run the script X amount of times (like simming a season in a sports game) or give you a 30% boost to whatever the total is. I think those are both reasonable and didn’t take much to come up with.
---
Bloodied AAE handmade is not a thing that exists.
---
If I didn’t have a job or kids I would be able to max no problem lol
---
Is head a limb?
---
Run around the charilston capital building on the side of the DMV or run around whitesprings.
---
WE NEED MORE STASH SPACE!
---
Soooo... Second Life and then FO76?
---
Personally, I enjoy the cooperative aspect of non-PvP FO76 with enemies, events, and all that. I just dislike open season type PvP. Now if we had legit guilds which could spat against each other - like these people are in Raider (XXCLANNAMEXX) Guild and they're feuding with Brotherhood of Steel (XXOTHERCLANXX) Guild so members of each are automatically hostile to each other - that might be cool. Would make things feel a bit more like an RPG and not a FPS with crafting. 
---
You could even have guild ranking quests/dailies like "steal from 5 members of Ad Victorim Brotherhood Guild" or "subjugate 5 members of Wild Things Raider Clan". And have them get more difficult the higher in guild rank you get until you get something like "defeat the current Elder of Ad Victorim in single combat using only an unmodded golf club and raider leathers" with the current Elder being the highest level player in that guild on your server.
---
You can use m/kb with any XB game now, by using a 3rd party dongle.
---
There are multiple games that already support plug &amp; play m/kb connections. 
---
I don't want to, however.
---
You'll still have 14 days to earn up scrip for the next event...and with 16\*3 stars, you'll already be half way to the max scrip level again...and if you have cash, I bet there will be a lot of cheap 3 stars out there for sale too.
---
Lol get better at 2v1. Lol im always fighting 2,3,4 vs 1. More kills for me. Mouhahah Intel they pop steathboys. 1 guy with sb is ok, 3 tho. That's a pain.
---
Tape a shake weight or an electric toothbrush onto the button. EZ hack.   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Oh yeah? Try placing a wall facing inwards instead of outwards.
---
Lol. So the 50% limb damage bug is back.
---
Not too late. New players joining every day
---
Todd would never lie to us
---
Can you also fix the shotguns. Please!!!!
---
Well that’s just not true lol
---
https://gyazo.com/7e16ab03f550f866669b2819e540f7e5 killed 5 here. and had at least 3 doing Queen of the Hunt
---
“This piece of cloth is so old, it’s crumbling into powder. Did I win the lottery?”
---
It's not too late
---
Read up on guides, farm junk, farm legendarys for purveyor scrip, choose your perk cards and certain mutations wisely for your build (bloodied vats crit sneak rifleman/commando)
---
r/FO76roleplay
---
No!come back please its awesome!
---
Fairly certain I killed a Scorched Snallygaster but it didn't register. The list is rather odd too. Why a Scorched Tick but not a Scorched Crab Van?
---
Sure did
---
https://imgur.com/a/psWbdBe
---
It sounds like a evil Vault Tec experiment.
---
No it isn't. There are rules, if racist filth can't behave in a civilised fashion then Bethesda will ban them.  Normal people are not racist
---
I’ve read that the responder bot will spawn on the other side of the bridge if a camp is built there. I haven’t tested this, however. I would t worry about it. Build what makes you happy.
---
Same pool
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes
---
3. You didn't ask, but challenge progress is also shared so you can do the low level portion of the level up daily and then hop onto your main for the lvl 76+ one for example.
---
I'd prefer we didn't get the Playstation players on PC.
---
Every post here about super toxic behaviour is always on Playstation, meanwhile everyone I've met in 76 on PC has been friendly.
---
God I hope they bring pvp servers back in the future, I’m getting harassed so often in the last weeks, even tho I’m on pacifist mode they just keep running after me even tho I’m not responding in any way. Sometimes I have to swap servers bc it’s still fucking annoying.
---
That's a plan I could get behind
---
Conversely, we don't want toxic console players.
---
Hey I just read this before I came here. Glad to see talented people representing FO76.
---
The way Bethesda works, this would then mean that you'd have to re-equip them by hand once you leave PA ;)
---
The game is certainly fun, especially if you're just starting out now since a lot of the early game grievances have been addressed (mind you, most, not all).
---
The biggest complaints are based around non-PVP players being sucked into PVP either by not being in pacifist mode after level 5, or by not understanding how workshops can put them in peril. It's a thing, it can be annoying, but there are many servers to hop to if the griefers on your particular server get too intense.
---
Secondly there is much hullabaloo around Atom shop items. By starting a new account you will accumulate a fair amount of "Atoms" fairly quick and have the opportunity to get a sample of what the shop has to offer. The complaints come in at the perception of "pay to play" in that certain Atom shop items grant the user things that they would not naturally find in the game. Basically certain Atom shop items extend beyond cosmetics, and that causes an uproar in certain communities.
---
Otherwise it's a great deal of fun! I tend to play 99% solo due to being a father of small kids, and the only time I can play is after they go to bed with the Mic muted. But there is a very friendly community out there, ready to lend a helping hand in most cases.
---
Wow! Now Beth adds lootboxes!
---
Not sure. I just shoot at legs than finish off with a melee.
---
I'm on. Ign is ghostrider3506
---
Correct, I only use 50 Cal &amp; PA for SBQ battles &amp; Nuke Zones, paired with all 3 level 2 Heavy Gunner perks, Stabilized, &amp; Adrenaline, Stealth hits reach 193/round on SBQ head shots.
---
I've been rocking my skeleton costume.
---
Ps4 social menu has never worked right can’t invite can’t accept intermittent crashes I avoid it like the plague
---
TSE is a good all-round legendary combo, and faster reload is icing on the cake. That said, shotguns are pretty weak compared to rifles or heavy weapons so while it is good for a shotgun, it won't compare dps-wise to a TSE variant of either of those weapons.
---
I was hoping for a furious or instigating if anyone has those.
---
Shotgun is an up close weapon, tho not too close with explosive. What level is it? Have you applied mods?
---
That’s why crossplay should be optional and not forced.
---
Goodluck and enjoy!
---
Smg come in all flavors. Semi auto exist on nearly all of them.
---
It’s lvl 50 and I added some making it do 223 damage. Should I add anything else? Like long range mods so that the explosive works better ?
---
I just kill them.
---
OK, here is that info I promised: Due to this bug, we're going to replace the Mystery Pick event with a 25% off Purveyor Sale event this weekend, instead. We've updated Inside the Vault with the full details, but I'm also copying them here for visibility.  
---
&gt; #### Update - October 3:
---
Agreed. Maybe it could come in with wastelanders.
---
Im pretty sure it supports any usb m/kb by default.
---
I had 2 black screen of death yesterday on XB1 but nothing thus far today.
---
What lvlel was the mole miner. Do you have the shotgun perk? What legal is the shotgun? 
---
Yes keep it.
---
Yeah I have a tse Tesla rifle and after seeing the shotgun do that much damage I pulled out my Tesla and instantly one shotted everything
---
You can do whatever you want when there’s a mutual interest with another player but just harassing people and attacking them even when they’re in pacifist mode just to be annoying is simply stupid as fuck. And what op here described is exactly that.
---
I think lvl 45 miner and which perk are you referring to exactly
---
Yeah, you're probably leveling up so fast that any weapon you get now will be outclassed in a couple days.
---
You.  I like you.
---
Coreross is kinda stupid and his siege news videos are all mostly speculation
---
Did you taste it? That's the only way to know for sure for any strange substance...
---
It does, but it's up to the game devs to support it (Bethesda isn't one of them), hence the 3rd party dongle that lets you map for any game.
---
Damn, thats a shame.
---
ahh.. See this changes a lot of things.
---
Lol ESO has craft all possable but dont see why it needs to be on 76.
---
I see, good to know.
---
The constraints of the system mean that even a pro cannot make something that blends in and looks as though it were from the vanilla game.
---
I was born 85 so I feel like I'm on the cusp.. but I guess We're elder millennials. I blame AOL
---
You'll get a king's ransom for it for sure. Not quite a BE (which I saw someone post a 16:1 trade for), but a TSE will still get you more than you need for sure.
---
I understand your point. The bigger problem is that there just isn’t anything worthwhile (imo) to spend all these damn caps on. Plans that I don’t want and will never use? No thanks. 
---
I dropped out of the cap race months ago. Stopped vending and just max the robot vendor daily. I only use them to fast travel because I can easily find anything I need and craft the rest.
---
Perk cards, certain mutations, well tuned, crit, bobbleheads, comics, underarmor, legendary armor mods...
---
Without any of these other factors a weapon will not be enough damage to put a creature down.
---
Then* not than. 🤦🏻‍♂️😂
---
Bravo.
---
The BE is pretty much the current holy grail.
---
Haha I feel you man If i didn't have a job or kids I'd have 5 characters maxed out lol, just dumped 600 scrip on the surprise box got 10 pieces of scrip back so I'm thinking the 50% sale might be the way to go
---
Under armor helps with shotguns?
---
That would be a good way to get rid of some caps for the economy tho
---
I’ve found that moving your player forward and backwards solves this nearly every time. I have an opposite facing brick wall for a fireplace!
---
No the joystick will not physically go to perfectly centered. It's not electrical nor the app. It's the joystick.
---
Thanks dude. Good job. I was wondering what I get if I spent all my scrip. Now I know.
---
&gt; Update – 3:30 p.m. EDT October 3:
---
&gt;
---
&gt; After investigating reports from the community, we’ve found that melee weapons purchased using the Purveyor’s Mystery Pick option are only awarding certain legendary effects for legendary melee weapons. The Purveyor’s normal legendary melee options are not affected by this issue. Rather than keep the Mystery Pick option available in this state, we’ve decided to replace it with a new 25% off Sale Event instead so that you can still catch some great deals this weekend.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4QeLrJadNmlc5kduJiBGy8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-project-clean-appalachia-updates
---
Yup its bugged somehow,months ago i got them to work,not anymore
---
My friend put his level 7 alt on the drums and left him there.  Alt received a Tenderizer while his level 250+ self got the same generic stuff the rest of us did.  Go figure.
---
I read this sarcastically in my head.
---
Source?
---
Xbone
---
I got mine today but my brother wasn’t able to (PC)
---
If you start with a half wall inside of the building, you can eventually get them all turned, but it's a colossal pain.
---
Bandwidth is effectively the exit hole in the 50lb bag.  The more bandwidth you have = a bigger hole for data to go through. 
---
Its easier to fill up a swimming pool with a firehose than it is with a drinking straw.
---
Hay now i have happaly paid ZOS thousands of Dollars for thoes homes.
---
I want my 560 scrip back. I got got 5 garbage melee weapons. I got the receipt i want some refund.
---
Happens to me far too often, especially when I play with my lower character. Getting constantly attacked (more likely harassed) by higher level players who can’t accept that i won’t fight back. One time I changed characters real quick and showed up with my +200 rifle build with pvp armor and explosive Tesla. Let’s say he attacked me just once... I hate these kind of players.
---
Are challenges randomly given or will I find more the more I explore??
---
It’s only 3 points, there’s only 1 set of unarmed cards (nvm you meant the pipe guns)
---
what the hell not til midnight !
---
I tried solo once... and died alone and forgotten...  twice.
---
Thanks! I’ll definitely check this out when I’m done at work, I loved making builds in the single player fallouts so being able to have an idea at what I’m doing rather than aimlessly unlocking everything would be great!
---
Pretty easy to reach those levels when Bethesda let's EXP glitches exist for months. Some may not know but the last EXP glitch was discovered and then a week later Bethesda decided to do double XP without fixing it.
---
Back up weapon is probably a good idea. Couple times the other night I had to buy the atom shop repair kits because I kept breaking my pickaxe
---
Check the vendors
---
Ouch!
---
You don't make it to level 878 without some blood on your hands. He's probably been stocked up on resources and ammo since the Dev Room appeared. If the devs cared about the economy they could easily script a data log check to review population stats and likely see that this guy's character is still inventory bugged and that his IP has multiple accounts with stockpiles.
---
Good point, for some reason I completely mistook the two and no matter how much I looked at my post, it looked correct.
---
Non unyielding build caps around 460, adding 5 pieces of unyielding puts you over any PA.
---
It was unless they changed it.
---
wow what a surprise was so looking forward to the mystery box stop letting the interns work on projects....
---
I do. But not alot of people sell them. And i dont have like 25k caps to spend on a gun lol
---
I have had same issue.
---
congratulations man. i remember my first random encounter with one of these outside of an event. truly frightening. glad to hear you sucked it up &amp; doubled back for the takedown. 👍🏽
---
Just be careful about those. They may save you now but sooner than later you’ll need em. 
---
Yeah always carry a good pistol and or melee weapon.  Even if you never have to use them. They come in handy.
---
They still make nice lawn or roof ordiment.lol
---
You'd have to be blind to miss all the bugs. No aspect of the game works properly.
---
Mods are mislabeled or do nothing at all.
---
Perks that are totally broken like tenderizer.
---
Almost every part of camp building that has a function is broken.
---
All the added content was poorly recieved.
---
Burrows was a disaster, imp sheepsquatch was abandoned after a week and the new raid can erase your entire character.
---
This is why I think there should be a vendor or building with machines in it that give weapons legendary perks. Randomized sure but it'd be nice to have another use for Scrip just make it cost more  if anything.
---
I spend about 160 to 180 per day and am always near the 1,000 scrip cap. If we get the 50% discount then I'm going to spend it all, but until then I'm not going to spend more than I make.
---
*cries in power armor*
---
🙁
---
As far as I know, there are zero set spawn points for the gatling gun.  Just random drops.  I had to build and scrap them.  Fortunately it doesn't take many scraps to learn what you need.
---
I got explosive weapons and I do not charge 20k. The prices are 7900 to 15k depending on type of weapon. My psn cwn1972 if you like to take a look at my inventory. They drop just got to be lucky, I’m 285 and I only gotten one handmade Explosive from a drop.
---
Based on a post I just saw we aren’t on track for the 50 %-we need numbers out there fighting scorched
---
Yep! Would also like to see some 3* level 80 Sheepsquatch or level 90 Deathclaw.
---
That's *a lot* of perception and endurance imo. Spend your QOL point where you want though, i guess. 
---
Unless you are always on a team, i would strongly recommend moving some of those points to Charisma for Lone Wanderer.
---
A vintage diver suit does not exist, but a diver suit does. It is currently unobtainable though.
---
Bethesda forgot about it like they did with Biv.
---
Remember the drink that gives you fire damage and the keg?
---
Never got added to the game.
---
Need that! For sure!
---
"IF you cannot do something smart, do something right."
---
Well done.
---
Ditto! Yes! One of the best movie monsters ever made.
---
And to prove it, here's my Pumpkinhead action figure agreeing with your post:
---
[https://imgur.com/v7TwM1S](https://imgur.com/v7TwM1S)
---
It will not spawn when you build at Charleston station, no vendor bot appears at other station. Even if you build at Charleston station there are 4 other location vendor bot spawns
---
Build a doorway, then build a doorway on the other side of it, turn the one you want into a solid wall, scrap the other.
---
Wow thank you for this great explanation! Fo76 is my first online game (never had an interest before, but wanted to try bc I love the fallout series!) So I mean while people who like online gaming are used to this, I'm really not. This explanation really does clarify a lot for me especially based on my location and with the events. Thank you!
---
Nice story ‘sumabitch’!
---
There's several other places the vendor bot can spawn so I wouldn't worry too much.
---
I'm pretty sure the amount of exp needed to level past 200 is different then the exp needed from 0-50.
---
At the legendary vender i rolled a TSE lever action with 15% AP rate.  Bought maybe 40 plus weapons at Legendary vendor.  With legendary kills maybe roll an explosive every 150 or so
---
For PS4 it been blue screen since game was introduced, with each patch it gets better or worth.
---
That's effing brill. All this time and ive been missing out.
---
They could pop bunny man in as a boss. And b4 any ask yes its real vergina lore. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunny_Man
---
I mean the Purveyor already was kind of a loot box system, so...
---
I’m typically close to max caps so I hop from base to base, server to server buying cheap legendaries from player vendors. Hit Westek and Huntersville each server in hope of a legendary.
---
Well, disconnects and the occasional level 6 immortal bloatfly. In general I like the game! It's not as good as past fallout games but it's fun
---
 I just wish I could play for longer without getting disconnected when a lot of stuff is happening!
---
If you are on XB1 I have a bunch of random weapons with explosive
---
I read a while back that it's decent against Impostersquatch, but honestly, I'm too busy trying to not die as conduit of all 3 to shoot at the thing...
---
Next time im on il add and take a look. Most people overcharge for weapons. Unless its insanley good or a mistake. Noones gonna buy it
---
Explosives *used to be* the go-to effect, but they're falling (slowly) from favor a little.  Just having explosive isn't the top of the line any more.  It is not *bad*, but it's not as good as it once was.
---
I still put a premium on explosive weapons, but it's gotten smaller, and I find that they don't disappear as fast as they used to.  I've got at least a couple for sale, and they've been there for a couple weeks (I think one is a pistol, so no surprise that one sits).
---
FFR is about as good (better in most cases), and depending on your spec/preference, you may be better off looking for other things in stead.
---
I don't mean the actual game my brain just couldn't phrase it differently, for me it's just getting disconnected and crashing more often. Hopefully it'll get better soon.
---
Feel like a dingus but can I ask where you found the door? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
---
He still spawns if a CAMP is there. Ive had one of my toons there and farm it pretty regularly.
---
My new goal is to find the plans for the skeleton. Looks like I may find it at Freddy’s? I’m only level 42 so lots of places I haven’t been yet but it’s nice to have goals.
---
I've dropped one gun army from my build , it just doesn't seem to do much and most enemies die so fast it just seems like wasted points
---
Thanks for the advice guys, the last posts I saw about this were over 6 months ago... The people complained that their camp would always get nuked by angry players.
---
Queen of the Hunt is the only daily quest this can drop from at the moment.
---
Oh most definitely. Ridiculous offers out there for legendary fixers in general, but if you have a BE one you basically can name a price.
---
I'm glad I'm still at work and didn't buy anything yet. 
---
Who knows, maybe tomorrow they discover some new bugs and Bethesda will give us some free legendaries. Who knows. Lol
---
All the added content was poorly received lol? Player vending, entire sheepsquatch questline (not just the event), nukashine quests, pioneer scouts. All well received.
---
And yes bugs exist but game is 1000% more stable then launch. Used to get disconnected constantly or crash. Doesn’t happen at all now for me. I can go 6 hours with no issues. I haven’t played more than that in one session.
---
These were sold in the Atomic Shop. The only “event” would be entering your Credit Card in to buy it.
---
I dunno, it makes sense to me, how do you sneak around in a suit of clunky armor that weighs like a ton? I've always thought it was dumb that you can sneak in Power Armor at all
---
Isnt the 25% off the purveyor the award for killing 8 million scorched?
---
I spent 1440 on mystery picks.  I'm just going to tell myself I would have gotten 13 ghoul slayer's bash damage broadsiders anyway if I was doing my usual ranged weapon purchases from the updated sales event. 
---
I'm glad they're being responsive to the bug, though, for people who still have scrip to spend.
---
On the other end of that argument I got 2 solid hours of fun pvp last night from a group that usually stays on survival servers. I’m happy to see more action on adventure mode to keep people interested in the game.
---
it is a super crappy approch, i just got the last plan after about a week of hitting my daily raids.  
---
on the plus side for OP, since the PA needs a stupid amount of steel he should have all his plans well before he finishes the steel requirements (i had earned 120 steel at the time i got the last plan)
---
I’ve done many MM, never seen another player! Usually get a legendary though.
---
0
---
20 minutes ago from now.
---
Soooooo if we spent all our scrip before this was addressed are we SOL?
---
If you wanna get technical no crafting perks work with armor since you cant craft while in armor *bwahaha*
---
But seriously nice list, doing gods work
---
BOS paints aren't atomic shop
---
Edit: present for almost a year.
---
Well that’s a major bummer. I don’t keep up with the atom shop stuff too much so I appreciate the info. It had me thinking they could be posters on train stations for some kind of future quest line :(
---
Nice! Cool find
---
Colour me intrigued...
---
like diff "simulations" we could run in the mistress of mystery training/death chamber (which has Tardis dimensions, much bigger on the inside)
---
Yeah they all stack, the brawling armor mod also adds additional damage, but only apply it to one limb as doing the other won't add anything.
---
Fury works just fine with unarmed still. I use it all the time.
---
 🎃  🎃  🎃 Make the Wasteland Spooky again!  🎃  🎃  🎃
---
That's not what I meant. I have a BOS Chest that I want to paint. I own the Camo armour paint from the atomic shop. It won't allow me to paint the BOS armour.
---
Used to be 1/8 - 1/10 ratio at murmrgh’s, recently it’s 1/60 for me (one drop out of 3000 scrips worth of 2 star ranged weapons)
---
My exploding handmade is automatic, handy for when things are up close and personal. For single shot I’ve got the TSE lever. The only catch is having to switch the rifleman/commando perks.
---
Camo paint for combat armor is bugged atm. There's already 10-14 posts about it
---
Strangler heart PA is best all around IMO.
---
Better idea (IMHO):
---
Instead of "Craft All Possible" give us a "Craft Multiple" option which then brings up a slider. The maximum slider amount would equal the maximum number you could craft based upon available materials. That way you could opt to craft 1,000 rounds of 5.56 or only 545 rounds.
---
Damn I didn’t even know there was an armor mod like that! Thanks!!
---
Or Volkssturmgewehr﻿ 
---
Camo paints currently cannot be applied or removed
---
i had this same discussion with a buddy. Being able to bulk craft will be a time saver, but if i have to sacrifice super-duper i'll mash that button all day.
---
I didn't see those. Thanks. I hope they address it soon.
---
There was a problem with it, so they changed it to 25% off instead. Better deal really.
---
I hunted for firecracker whiskey forever and just gave up.  I'm more alcohol than man.
---
Pretty close! Just dug it up from the game files, they have exactly 4,000 HP. 
---
Floating damage numbers only show the damage you're outputting before your target's resistances are factored in.  For instance, the queen has 32,767 HP, and my numbers can show 5,000+ per swing, but they take less than 5% of her health instead of 15%. The difference is that the queen has a flat 70% damage mitigation on top of her normal DR and ER.
---
Seems reasonable.
---
(sarcasm)
---
If you wanna know when it broke it was after patch 13 so the next patch "should" fix it
---
They'll fix it eventually
---
I used it today quite a bit. First roll was a 3* be faster aiming db shotgun.
---
Good deal for 60 scrip!
---
Legendary mirelurk queens and legendary behemoths are the real endgame content
---
Eventually being the operative word.
---
It happened with two different weapon and this is new to the current patch.
---
It spawns for the player with the base. After that base spawns any new players do not get anything to spawn because the base player took it
---
I hope so. I look like a mismatched idiot running around in forest scout limbs and a big blue bos chest.
---
I am Captain Jonas Quark the lone survivor of the space station that fell to earth in West Virginia after a collision with an alien craft.  I spend my time searching for alien survivors and am determined to thwart their evil scheme to make earth like their irradiated home world.
---
I mean aside from raid armor, which I cant get because it crashes 3/4 times lol.
---
Would you happen to have a pic of that? I’m deff thinking of stealing this idea. I may make a second character just to display things. Like a curator of my real character’s stuff just cause of the weight issue.
---
Also, is that a particular neon sign or do you buy it and make it say whatever? I have some atoms saved for something silly and this could be it.
---
The prison yard and nearby Grafton dam have Supermutants and their pet hounds (usually one per site).
---
Strange. I had one of my guys get him and his camp was in the Bog. Ive never had an issue with him not spawning if another player is set up there.
---
I was able to use it once and got a furious fast firing cryolater with reduced weight.
---
Buy em. I didn't get my first explosive drop til I was 220. My alt has better chances of good drops at level 115
---
So I assume the BOS chest is a combat armour piece. Are you sure the camo paint you bought was specifically for combat armor? or was it for another type like leather or metal. I cannot remember off the top of my head if a camo combat armor skin was ever sold.
---
It's not for everyone, but I would consider creating a second character as a Strength build.  This way you can retain the Commando build and it can share/help the second build to level faster.  Gives you options.  I just know I wouldn't ever want to give up my Commando build, even if it isn't great at everything (and nothing is!)
---
First off, congrats. 
---
I’m in the 40s but encountered a legendary lv 50 sheep as well yesterday. Dumped 1200 .50 cal bullets, 150 .45, and probably 200+ fusion cells. All for a damn troubleshooting rolling pin. 
---
Still felt great to take one down solo though.
---
(Also has anybody considered that the Zetans could end up being some once a year event so as to keep their weaponry and ammunition(plans??) rather exclusive?)
---
I admit I have bought a few, but I've looted more than I have bought. There is no special trick, just luck of the draw. I looted a quad explosive handmade on my first character before I reached level 45. I later bought another one for a different character.
---
Yep, that's what happened to me in my first solo sheepsquatch kill. Goodbye hundreds of rounds of ammo, you we'll be missed
---
So what did you mean when you wrote
---
&gt;If you don't see the other details like exploding, faster fire rate, faster swing speed, +1 strength, etc., it's because they weren't there.
---
I assume this meant that you already included all the details, and that all you got was one stars.
---
Those are tougher than SBQ
---
Play the game
---
Hi are ranged weapons working ok?
---
I respect the heck out of you for not putting a T on scrip. Take my upvote and I will defend you to the death on this issue.
---
I dunno, this reminds me more of the "And then there's this asshole" Spiderman
---
I actually made a killing meat week with random armor pieces blew my friends mind. Just basic run of the mill stuff priced low.
---
??? jsut use the warehouse and wooden  building sets and dont use any fancy clean objects!
---
I literally looked up and double checked the plural of "scrip" because I'm that dumb about grammar, haha. Thank you for the recognition.
---
The game still hard crashes regularly when using aid from the pipboy, using vats while an explosion is happening and just randomly.
---
Pioneer scouts was not well received, it was a huge tedious grind where a large portion was impossible to complete.
---
The rest of them takes less than an hour to complete, hardly a years worth of content.
---
Use unarmed it's better. If you want tanky go junkies.
---
I would love this but they need to lower the price. I wont pay out the ass for packs regardless of how much i want them. 
---
What id love to see is 
---
Autumns coat from 3
---
The hellfire armor  i know its major lore breaking but if the minutmen and maxson battle coat can be in so can hellfire power armor. 
---
Enclave flags and wall decorations 
---
Our own modus terminal for our camps that we could use instead of the normal vendor. Complete with modus voice
---
Our own eyebot for our camps
---
the hand scanner door lock to use instead of passcode locks
---
I think you're right that there will be some kind of alien/invasion event at some point. There has been a decent amount of Atom Store alien themed items.
---
As for the ammo I don't think they will have the regular AB ammo being sold but continue to have the Fusion Cell Mods for any new weapons.
---
It blows my mind that people buy that crap. Every prima games guide is written before the game exists and is pure guesswork.
---
They are worse sources of info than that wiki no one updates.
---
What that! 1500 atoms for everyone. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
You are not going to be able to determine what something is from that diamond but rather just general safety information. Too many things share the same values for it to be determined off of just the diamond.
---
Why do you hate veterans?
---
I hope they don’t gimp legendary drop rates along with this
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the radium rifle kind of designated to be a specialist weapon similar to the gamma gun? Since most animals, and humanoids currently in the game are radiation immune, or resistant, the radium rifle is unsurprisingly a very bad weapon for use, since the other half of your damage type is completely invalidated.
---
But against players, perhaps it's a different matter and it may actually be a formidable choice?  I could be completely wrong though, especially with things like power armor being a frequent choice.
---
Maybe the radium and gamma gun are sleeping beast weapons at the moment.  Not often used, but as you said, when Wastelanders comes out and humans return to Appalachia.. That will be the time radiation damage on weapons will shine.  Maybe.
---
AA bypasses the sentinel/assassin.
---
i’ve already recommended this lol, i agree as well
---
More likely that they'd give us an free icon of a legendary.
---
For pvp maybe. PA is garbage.
---
I know I'm spamming threads on this, but want to make sure you're all aware: We've replaced this weekend's Mystery Pick event with a 25% off Purveyor Sale Event due to a bug affecting Mystery Pick melee weapons.
---
The sale will last the same amount of time as the Mystery Pick would have, until 12pm ET on Monday, October 7. [Full details are here on our forums](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/367439/purveyor-mystery-pick-replaced-with-25-off-sale-event-oct-3-7?language%5B%5D=en).
---
Now it's necessary for extra carry weight. I can never fast travel without it.
---
Bro I have new ones they r vanilla but they still dont work I have no clue what's going on I reinstalled more than once and verified. I'm level 100 and something tbh I dont know exact
---
bro 😎💪

Hey thanks for sharing this bug report. Due to the issue that was affecting Mystery Pick melee weapons, we've replaced this weekend's Mystery Pick event with a 25% off Purveyor Sale Event.
---
You mean every fo76 wiki?

u/TxJeepers ritual bindings has to be counted.

 &gt; Hey thanks for sharing this bug report. Due to the issue that was affecting Mystery Pick melee weapons, we've replaced this weekend's Mystery Pick eve...
---
The Struggle is real
---
Bro
---
Yeah they both suck. Can't believe no one updates them.
---
Anyone else do the mental gymnastics on what 1/2/3* combos they’ll scrip to hit 150 exactly every day?  
---
(“Ok, five times three for 1* armor, four times 9 for the 2* armor, one 3* armor, one 3* weapon two 2* weapons and SHIT I DONT HAVE A 1* WEAPON - FINE ILL PAY 1000 caps for your craptastic nocturnal cryolator and lug my overencumbered ass back to the legendary machine!)
---
Nothing makes me crazier than having 598 scrip with two left in the machine.
---
Yeah but as someone who played the other fallouts and didnt come here from cod, at least you know that's how it is supposed to be
---
Shotguns are way powerful PvE, and the best solo weapon. That cripple is guaranteed on 2 or 3 shots. On any creature but the queen.
---
Mystery Picks.
---
How can this happen r/valseek ? Is it not a repetition of a previous bug?
---
I join you in that. I blew 1000 srcip I saved up and had 3 AA limb damage pipe wrenches in a row.
---
I’m still into it, having only gotten Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow’s guide when I was 6(far betterthan 76’s proportionately if i had to be honest) but for free i will absolutely take all of the maps of every single interior inside of the book along with the big appalachia map(which could do without ugly font lettering for each region) and the digital e-guide code, hell maybei could upload some of this guesswork to the wiki and keep everybody fumbling around!!(book didnt even cover Fasnacht &gt;:/)
---
Backpacks my friend!
---
I’m looking for more people to play with in general I’ll be on this weekend if you wanna run around
---
Does running around in the Nuka Girl outfit with the skull mask instead of the helmet work?
---
Im running around with the Helmet Raider Mask with the Bloody Chefs costume
---
I spent 700 scrip today and got 6 melee. How unfair is that.
---
uwu
---
Thanks so much very helpful!
---
I don't care much for any events seasonal, repeatable or whatever but I'm more concerned with Wastelanders and you can tell their entire focus is on that since Clean Appalachia is pretty much a simple thing.
---
Very epic. My most valiant encounter was in the ash heap at level 20ish, i was trying to get miner miracles done too, so call it 25, im overencumbered, and i like a good trooooop so i work my way from the estates toward charleston fd, i was looking to get me sum free lead at the end of this, i get ambushed by cave crickets immediately, luckily im building this character up on agility, so hes getting away fairly okay until i see a sheepsquatch offing whatever random enemy for the randomencounter that it was, i run straaaaaight through the battle,(80 units away?), my only legendary armor piece on this character cloaks me, invisibly, and i get to watch the end up jurrassic park unfold, as the tyrannosaurus squatch takes out the velocicrickets, howls, and i scurry the fuck away because i like my loot, and i hated my weapons as i was very unprepared all things considered, but damn did i emulate the fuck outta alan grant.
---
I haven't camenacross a legendary behomoth yet. I really want to! My camp used to be right next to where the one spawned in the pond south of whitesptings west of Huntersville. But he never spawned as a legendary.
---
Any ideas where to look?
---
Yeah I have real gear instead. 50 damage doesn't mean much when you hit for between 12-50k.
---
That and sentinel with serendipity is far more effective than just high dr for damage reduction.
---
And I can't use mine because people complain it lags them... I spent 1 month farming this PA and now I can't use it most of the time :S A fix would be highly appreciated.
---
We don’t care either bro lolzzzz that was too long to read I tapped right out
---
So far everything is working good. Now to venture into Vault 94 and pray it doesnt happen there. I am going to try and solo it
---
The only thing I missed in Fallout 4 was the ability to share it with a friend.  In 76 I can share the experience with friends, and that's what I'm here for. 
---
Why would PvP players be upset that PvE players aren't interested in playing with them?  Where is the confusion?
---
Keyring : trade off; you take longer to open doors because you can't find the right key haha
---
Yeah, at this point I don’t care about lore breaks, especially after they released the mechanist and minutemen outfits
---
Yeah this was a pretty quick turn around so that is a good thing. I dont want to be angry over a video game man i swear. And im not. Mostly. But seriously another broken thing. Again. Anyway good luck everyone.
---
No kidding.  I dropped 800 scrip today.  Didn't pay much attention to secondary and tertiary effects until afterwards.  That's what I get for expecting things to work properly and for trusting the game.
---
Yah gaht mehhhhhhh 💀
---
and even if you dont use it, other people using it can break your game
---
this has made the game unplayable for me for 3 weeks now
---
all i can do is farming west tek solo which gets old very fast
---
Not when you’re high level, Bethesda would make it a limited time bundle, so it would expire way before you got enough from grinding dailies and weeklies, if they priced it like the Free States bundle (more expensive than the game is today)
---
The one I grab often is near my camp on the southern tip of Seneca Rocks. There is a stuffed panda and alien against a rock and the word ASTROPANDA scrawled on it. Between them is the ring. Kinda treacherous but it’s there.
---
Yeah toxicity is something that is never really associated with PC gaming lmao
---
I don't have anything locked. Water purifiers, even the max only do 5... I can pick up that and more walking around doing events or leveling. I usually either trash or sell my water to the vendor. I can't get outta the 20s. Same goes for food and my doors. Course I have a place thats geared to help out people. Free food, free water, free room and board. One room is open for them to craft, one room is to sleep in and outside is the cow, food and water.
---
We talking pvp? That's pretty much it.
---
I hear good things about weightless but that's antivats.
---
i spent 8000 screws (and other mats, but mostly i was struggling with screws) to learn the final mod
---
no luck
---
I’ve already done all of these challenges sadly, good luck guys
---
Down by the monorail line in the se. I fought two legendary ones. Not at the same time thankfully because they kill you in one hit.
---
I had some clown last night at the meat cook running around slashing people. I stashed all my junk and turned off Pacifist and slaughtered him. He had a team that turned around and slaughtered me in return. I just turned Pacifist mode back on and left.
---
Idiots.
---
if you play on adventure you can’t be killed unless you shoot back
---
This mode just makes it another pvp game
---
You should have robbed him.
---
What are some of them?
---
Stack some enforcer perk.  It's not going to increase the damage output, but the cripple effect is second to none
---
Can’t you get legendary pa from the  vault 94 raid?
---
If you find Jesus you’ll have infinite scripture.
---
No it's adventure and can't you still get killed in pacifist mode?
---
Been getting a ton of 40% faster swing speed melees, not complaining at all, but it would be superb to get some with +1 STR for that extra carry weight &amp; slight damage buff.
---
It was. I have painted many BOS pieces in the past. The combat armour paint is available to buy in the atomic shop right now.
---
Code crawler work better?
---
Can’t wait for more blue screens and glitches. 🙌
---
I have...uh. three? Four? I'm about a thousand hours in, though.
---
Dont have that kinda attitude. Ask and you'll get
---
If you want you can give me your username and I'll add you, there's a couple who sell missions you may need more than just yourself for
---
Legendary effects really depend on your build.
---
Chameleon stacks the more armor pieces you have with it. 5 pieces makes you near invisible, even after firing.
---
I personally like Vanguard (+DR/ER when at high health), as I don't run a low-health build. Bloodied guys prefer Bolstering (+DR/ER when at low health).
---
Vending isn't quite like it was 6 months ago, just try to find stats that you like with the best possible set for your desired resistances.
---
XD
---
Lv40 mutants e +1 agility pipe revolver
---
Lv50 nocturnal e less vat cost combat rifle
---
Lv50 suppressors E light machine gun
---
Lv45 trouble shooters E rw .44 pistol
---
Lv45 trouble shooters E 10mm pistol
---
Also every explosive weapon took super nerfs cause of nerfs to exploding legendary effects.
---
Can we please make these two seprate things so they can be adjusted accordingly.
---
I like that you said adjust it just during events. 25% off then 25% more scrip daily. Great idea.
---
They don’t do damage really, you don’t have to run.
---
Yep and it was windago stool.
---
Not unless you're contesting a workshop
---
Id say toxicity is more of a problem with PC gaming in general.
---
I actually don't know, good question
---
Since they don't \~have\~ to use the purveyor... I expect them to not use the purveyor and to come up with something new and cool. And since that's what I wrote, you don't need to ask what I expect. xD
---
Used to be a legendary would spawn on the cornfield by the lake.
---
I assumed it was more of a 'unique' PA. I haven't done a raid, as I usually play with only +1, and you definitely seem to need a group of 4 to successfully get through (tried twice, demolished immediately).
---
In a game with no in-game chat, it makes end-game raids pretty difficult.
---
It's still annoying when I'm trying to enjoy the game
---
Thanks a ton for this! Didn’t know about Lucky Break
---
Crouch while reloading. Not a fix but at least it usable until one comes.
---
I love the pre-war money idea.
---
However there would need to be some Intel about what is in the storage lockers.
---
Maybe a description of the contents as:
---
-4 firearms
---
-1 melee weapon
---
-27 types of junk
---
-379 total pieces of junk
---
-4 meat
---
-3 medical supplies
---
-9 containers of liquid
---
-1 holotape
---
That way the items in the "lottery" are always different and the bidding will be different every time and for each person.
---
People who want firearms might bid on this but not melee users.
---
Sorry and also a lv50 executioners explosive hunting rifle
---
No, it isn’t. Lucky break and Serendipity don’t say anything about power armour.
---
Agreed.  A server alert for harder content, sure, but not something a decently geared 50 (or less) could solo.  Honestly the old system with project paradise added as server wide would have been just fine.
---
Tho I will admit distinguished guests is fun with a lot of people.
---
Hope you put in a ticket.  Put mine in and gave them a detailed rundown of all the things I've tried that didn't work (cpu affinity, limiting cores, lowering particles in the INI settings, etc.)
---
I'm hoping it's just the particle clouds stacking that freezes and not the damage calculations because nerfing armor that we had to work hard for would kind of suck.
---
The weekly-daily
---
Forgive me , I know this is off subject . But you seem like someone they may be able to answer this. Crack shot. All pistols now have 30% more range and much better accuracy when sighted. Is this skill useless for vats/hip fire.
---
And yet it's still an inferior version of FO4's building system in almost every way. :/
---
I enjoyed it for the first few months, but it hasn't progressed much since then. Once you've unlocked the base plans, which wouldn't take most players more than a few months, you're just grinding atoms and spending real money to get new stuff, while the size of the base and the functions to build it have largely been left untouched.
---
Recently this has gotten way worse. My friends and I joke about how many super mutants are shooting me while I am at the "main menu". Last night trying to team up to NW, we all had to close and reload the game for one of us to be able to invite everyone.  Upvote for visibility.
---
Great job man. 
---
In my travels I’ve found that shooting them in the butthole and or groin also does more damage. Not headshot damage.. but more than a limb or torso shot.
---
It’s worse when they steal nukes.
---
&gt;it's not like it got all the way through.
---
You, uh, sure about that?
---
😘 💁‍♂️
---
True, but as die hard fallout fan for years and a person who got the early beta release, have some ass come into event and take out the end boss ( wendigo at sons of dane "one violent night"; or uranium fever, one shotting all the personnel before any one can get "a hit" on it is just more than irritating.  These events are made for all than can make not a event where you show off your duped weapon or a weapon you bought from U4GM/ebay for cash.....that is my main gripe with alerts to server wide.  Doesnt make it enjoyable or interesting.
---
Are there any AAA Open World Survival RPGs other than 76 though?
---
It's a fantastic deal, as long as you manage the daily scrip limit.
---
If you start with the max 1k scrip, my math gives 86 separate 3* weapon purchases if you then sell each one back to the purveyor. Now I REALLY wish the daily scrip limit were higher lmao.
---
Mystery pick is over now to!
---
As a bloodied unarmed melee build my self. I dont use barbarian or blocker or anything a like. I just do my best not to die as i sneak everywhere. Serendipity + nerd rage dr/er does wonders anyway. With dense armor under 20% health i take 0 dmg from explosives. I don’t usually let the enemy hit me so i dont need blocker. 1 bolstering armor peices is enough compared to Barbarian. I can walk up to a super mutant as hes laying down mini gun fire on me and my health will barely go down, I literally troll them. I didnt build my build to fight mutants anyway its all for the queen and other bosses like that. There the only ones that kill me. Blocker, barbarian, evasive, dodgy, iron clad are NOT saving you in those situations. Also if you are bloodied, theres a charisma perk i don’t remember what its called where stims and radaway work much faster, those stims WILL save you.
---
Edit: i dont bother with makeshift warrior either, i think its an unnecessary perk when it comes to melee builds.
---
We're 4 days in in a 14 day time frame and are at 2million 1/4th of what we need. So unless the kill rate goes up there will be no sale. Just saying...
---
"Disconnect from Server" is the server crashing.  So yeah everyone goes bye-bye.
---
Crash to desktop and that's just you.
---
&gt; Kinda wished they did one more cookout at noon before having it over. Guess I’ll be eating my Prime Meat lol.
---
Hi! Just wanted to say thank you for this thread, OP. The next time we bring back Meat Week, we're going to make sure there's one last Meat-Cook at noon on the last day so you can turn in those last cuts of Prime Meat.
---
:)
---
Hell, I started at the end of Sept, as soon as I came across the witch's hat. I combine the witch's hat with a  skeleton suit, and skull bandana. 👻
---

So is sentinels assassins still good? I run 4 pieces of that. I do have vanguards too though. I know aa goes through it according to what some said, but not everyone has an aa weapon.

Just start a new alt and do the quest, you’ll get a chance to do a different build 👍🏽
---
RNGsus is not about fairness.
---
Oh shit it’s Bethesda!!! Thanks you guys for doing it again. It was very fun! Can’t wait for Wastelanders.
---
no u
---
Thanks for the input! I'll try to remember that, although crouching with a heavy weapon isn't the most intuitive thing ;)
---
I may or may not have hidden in the Charleston train station bathroom while a pack of ghouls spent 5 minutes killing an AFK player who was hogging the vendor.
---
If I had I would certainly have taken their junk on principle.
---
I feel your pain.  I've been running a Lever Gun with Instigating and that +250 DR effect for a couple months now. (Didn't know about the bug when I bought it, haven't been able to find a decent Instigating lever to replace it.)  I'm running a sneak sniper build, so it's a real problem to have the Instigating effect spontaneously fail because I foolishly reloaded while standing up a few minutes back.  
---
Too bad, because the +250 DR otherwise makes the slow reload time more palatable.  It would be fun to have it on my Dragon.
---
I’m really not sure what’s going on when it happens.... server or game crash, but it logs me completely out. Probably on me. 
---
I’m on PlayStation Btw
---
I thought they fixed that?
---
That's the spirit!
---
I've seen them in vending machines for pretty cheap
---
‘This is good enough for me’ sounds kind of entitled; like you know there is a thread where they’re actively seeking feedback but you instead want to put somewhere else so a bunch of other entitled gamers can passive-aggressively jerk each other off.
---
We need Samuel L Jackson to be graftons mayor.  ITS GRAFTON DAY MF

Yep typo, bloodied armor piercing I meant

we were at 2 million over 24 hours ago. expect it to jump up considerably the next time it gets updated.

&gt;What are 
---
Nice!  What do you typically craft/sell to make the caps?
---
My friend and I do this almost daily. I take all the pylons and drink nuka quatums, he a bloodied type fellow, does what bloodied fellows(or gals) do best; output a brilliant amount of damage, and die, respawn and repeat. If other players show up, it's ok as long as they let me take all the pylons.
---
Anything that makes it easy to workshop PVP. Direct cap rewards and bonus scrap to bulk and sell.
---
Shepherd Book always told me that.
---
This checks out.
---
FYI i get over 50 additional script from dailies per day
---
Marsupial to the top of the shack, the imposter can't melee yo anymore.
---
Good to know. That's only the first tier though. To get to 50% sale we're gonna need 40 million if they use the same multipliers as the scorchbeast one...
---
The devs don't actually use their own forums and only post here. That place is an echo chamber for fanboys.
---
Off topic but that's the Charging shotgun mod?  Do you charge it or just spam it as fast as possible?
---
I just spam the crap out of it... fairly fast fire rate, slow ass reload. Plus it still benefits from rifle perks, so it can one shot assaultrons in a non-bloodied and non-stealth situation.
---
Yeah I did the same, but found a pair in a vendor. Don’t actually use it anymore so happy to sell, if you want it (PC)?
---
Wait. You think I don't have access to the same food as you??? 😂😂😂👍 You're factually wrong in multiple ways. I can get all the same food and chem buffs as you, PA can have built in stealthboy that works on AI as if you weren't in PA, normal stealthboys work on pa as well, and gun fun works in PA. You're the one kidding themselves. You arent as special as you think sunshine. Also you didn't back up your claim that my dps is a fraction of yours.
---
Camo goes on all armor except marine and raider.....well it used to.
---
They read feedback on reddit all the time, and that feedback varies from good to bad. Reddit is a big place with a lot of different views. And of course they're not going to ask people to post here, it's a third party platform.
---
Final comment: Choosing where I voice my opinions isn't entitlement, it's a basic personal freedom. You're just looking for any reason to use that word like some kind of idiot.
---
You two guys should definitely stream a pvp match; with all this amusing boasting before the start, WWE style.

Kidding aside, I run a Strangler Whaler and it's great fun in pvp - which is really the most important metric, as honestly no one cares about other players' epeen. Just sayin'.
---
Not many people farm script this way, but daily quests reward script. The amount varying from region to region.
---
My first kill was with a tank/bloody/unyeiding build. It took three stimpaks and multiple power attacks with a legendary death claw 3*. I avoid them with all other characters knowingly it's a waste of ammo.
---
Everyone has a difference experience. 
---
Turn passive mode on and you can't be "griefed" unless you're at a workshop. It's happened to me exactly once in almost a year of playing. Every high level player I've encountered has either given me shit for free, wanted me to tag along with them, or left me alone. 
---
Generally speaking, I keep to myself in the game, and other than that one asshole who killed me at a workshop unnecessarily, I've had zero issues with other players.
---
You can't drop keys
---
Another long winded post i couldn't get all the thru
---
Good job mate! Between now and level 50 consider the following two builds I've had luck with, when it comes to killing the sheepsquatch. Sneaky bloodied unyielding unarmed (can kill it in 1 hit). The other, which I'm using now, is a full-health Junkie's unarmed build, although it takes several well timed hits and you risk getting staggered / taking damage. However, because I have 15 points in Strength, I can slap on 9 Heavy Gunner points and use a Junkie's LMG. It takes about two seconds of firing to kill it.
---
Early in the game: Go kill super mutants or mole miners. Keep their weapons and sell them with level 3 hard bargain equipped.
---
In the end game, serums are the fastest way to get to your daily limit. My main character makes serums, and I give them to my other characters. I log into each character for 5 minutes when I get home from work and get their 1400 caps from the robot vendors.
---
Thanks for updating me on your short attention span.
---
PA can definitely be as good if not better than sentinel armor if you actually know what you're doing.
---
In adventure mode the only way to get killed by another player is 1) you own a workshop and are in area when they try to take said workshop 2) they shoot at you and you shoot them back or vice versa this can be avoided with pacifist mode on from settings . But now if you are doing an event that isn't a community event then if you die they can take your items. But it is only junk and well most of that stuff is easy to get back. I always empty junk to stash before going to any events that way I lost nothing if I die. So I  guess to answer your question ypu only get griefed if you allow yourself to get griefed by not take  precautions. And the griefers are far and few between nowadays.
---
I guess you mean October 7th instead of 3 given how today is the 3rd on thursday
---
So last night my wife and I were playing and we both got the "Disconnected from Server" message. We reconnected and were put on the exact same server, same people, same workshops owned, etc. 
---
So sometimes the game really does hate just YOU.
---
It's in the doors section, on the... third selection from the top? I think? But it \*is\* in there, so just keep looking through them until you find it.
---
Mutation serums? Aren’t those tough to make since you need rare ingredients... not to mention you need to find the recipes
---
They’ve done that. Plus they’re all available in the enclave vendor now. Discovered that yesterday when I needed a polymer mod.
---
Eat my ass
---
Monday october 3?
---
Oops. I've got October 3rd on the brain. Thank you!
---
Are we not comparing unarmed to plasma gatling?
---
Food buffs are melee.
---
I already told you how much damage I do, it's not rocket science. I have peak gear for min maxing unarmed, I'm assuming you do for heavy 
---
The potential for unarmed is higher.
---
PA stealthboy drains AP, takes a chest slot, requires you to be crouched and is far worse than the legendary effect.
---
You're a fucking moron if you think that I was trying to say PC is better than consoles. They all have their merits, but this thread is for PC obviously and someone wanted to go on and say "just play on console, it's better anyways".   
---
Also, I stated simple facts about a PC being able to run games better than a console. I'm not sorry if you got your panties in a bunch and got butt hurt about it. Shows how pathetic you are just like the others that have / had nothing constructive to contribute to this post.
---
So gtfo, bye :)
---
No God helped you other than yourself, hail yourself my friend
---
When is Mumbles big sale
---
What does FFR mean?
---
I just threw up a little in my mouth.
---
The argument here was armor in the 1st place bud. The potential damage per hit is higher that doesn't mean the potential dps is higher. Regardless I have all that same gear and don't use it because the setup described is more versatile and has comparable damage.
---
What a waste lol
---
Faster Farting Rate
---
Faster Firing Rate too 😂 typo
---
The recipes used to drop from the Queen. You can still buy them from players, but they’ve increased in price to around 10k. Otherwise they are 17-19k from the Enclave Science wing. The materials aren’t that bad, save for ultracite scrap and stable flux. That’s why I said end game. You need to be good at killing SBs to get ultracite. Flux is easy enough to farm if you can find a nuke zone or drop your own nuke. The materials and type of flux required vary by recipe.
---
Good to know. I haven't played much the last week or two, but I'll likely check it out over the weekend.
---
Plans can only be found on dead trick or treaters. They spawn at the random encounter locations, primarily in the Mire. The mask &amp; hat spawn at Freddy's, also the Pumpkin House. The skeleton suit has a static spawn in a ranger tower, but the witch costume doesn't spawn anywhere.
---
Avoid using teslas and flammers with max damage perks on. Thats about it because these weapons tend to trigger this bug 10x easier than other guns.
---
My build is useless for pvp, it's purely pve. Crouching with low health doesn't work so well against people.
---
Seems like there are better things you could do with your time. I’m really sorry you are still experiencing crashes though. Honestly it’s been so stable for me I forget what that’s like. I remember being frustrated last fall but it’s been awhile.
---
In my experience only pvp players will pay stupid amounts for weapons and two shot weapons are complete garbage in a pvp scenario
---
Please add to this list for what I am missing.  
---
Bloodied, junkie,medic,berserkers legendary prefixes all have builds based on them. For me the first question is weapon type, then legendary effect/build, then hunt for armor options that compliment. Then the icing, the to element, crafting a backstory.  My favorite build at the moment is my shotgun Medic, a junkie who uses his own supply of chems, vats centric for damage and crit heals, medic pump action with AP refresh armor, high charisma for teamwork.
---
I want arena battles to return. Mirelurk Queen vs Sheepsquatch vs grafton monster vs deathclaw vs a horde of ghouls vs wendigo vs random NPC battle royale
---
&gt;a work around or way to avoid the glitch without giving up on using the mentioned weapons
---
...
---
I have an explosive combat rifle for PVP. It has never bugged the main portion of the damage out to zero. Dunno what to say. I don't boost my explosive damage at all though. I only use the explosion radius to easily toggle on Vats against crouched opponents.
---
I’m going to offer a counter argument: 
---
I like the simplicity of it all. As you said, we’d be doing these things anyway, so now we have a reason to. It harms no one and presents a simple opportunity to add a little bit of community engagement to everything. I also like that they give me an excuse to visit some places I haven’t been to in a while. 
---
If events like this prove to be popular, I’d imagine they’ll push them a bit deeper into the game—new monsters, new events, score counters that are actually in game etc. There’s no point in doing all that if people don’t engage with it, so this was a good way to do it at first—though I would like to see them go a few steps farther in the future. 
---
For every person that isn’t happy with the rewards, another will be. I’m the latter. These aren’t particularly grueling challenges. Getting Meat Week back and all the scrip and caps that come with it? Huge reward. A 50% off sale at The Purveyor? Huge reward. You literally double your legendary take with that. I would like to see some more cool CAMP items and/or cosmetics—I don’t think anybody really cares about photo frames or player icons—but for something that doesn’t require much effort, I’m not crying about the rewards.
---
If only it had reload speed instead! I've got a Quad / VATS accuracy / Reload speed Lever that's an absolute beast.
---
They need to use the purveyor to purvey goods... there is a big update coming in a couple months they are focussing on. Sorry this isn’t enough free content for you.
---
Agreed. I was thinking about a similar idea for a mode myself.
---
Except I would allow players to bring their characters over from adventure mode, but then up the difficulty of all the enemies.
---
It would still have pvp, but the ai enemies would be harder and players would be weaker (no legendary effects), so there would be a real tense feeling regarding trusting other players (as partying up would becone necessary in the later zones).
---
Also I personally can't be bothered starting a new character, I'm guessing allowing people to bring their established characters would draw more people to the mode.
---
Yeah that’s not practical lol sounds like it’ll make good money but way too much investment
---
chems, mothman egg omelettes and whatever junk I have in surplus.. sometimes stimpacks when I build up too many
---
the omelettes with super duper account for roughly a third of the daily cap alone
---
Oh boy this is going to be a fun answer. The topic of hipfire/vats/scope/iron sights could fill a whole post. Ok first let's establish that these terms have no meaning as far as the code is concerned. They are simply user friendly terms to help you understand what the mods/perks are accomplishing. So don't get hung up on them. 
---
That out of the way, here's what crackshot does: There are 2 effects: Mod Gun Range and Mod Cone-of-Fire.
---
Mod gun range checks to see if you are using a pistol and not using a heavy gun and it checks if you are sighted or not (GetInIronSights(NULL)=1). If these conditions are met, it adds 30% to the gun's range value.
---
On Mod Cone-of-Fire, it has the same condition checks, but the end result of this effect is that it makes the cone of fire 45% smaller. So your off-target shots will land in an area that's 45% smaller circle than without the perk card. This is the same mod that Ground Pounder uses for rifles that give them more hipfire accuracy. Only for those, the iron sights check is 0. (Tip: ground pounder works on ALL rifles, not just automatic as the card says)
---
So, no, this has no affect on VATS or when you aren't aiming down your sights. If it were going to affect VATS, it would be something like ModVatsHitChance. When you go into VATS, it calculates a hit chance percentage based on enemy location and your weapon stats. Then it applies a modifier to the percentage to increase the chance you'll hit. It doesn't actually mod your gun ability in any way. It's just stacking the dice roll more in your favor by increasing your odds of hitting. Hope that makes sense.
---
So, TLDR; yes it's useless for hipfire or VATS.
---
What are you swinging that you’ve got it up to 5k damage? Also how?
---
also.. water is wet
---
Milk a bull,make a friend for life.
---
Do you always get this butthurt when someone writes a critical opinion? xD
---
I'll talk about the next big update when the next big update comes. Until that happens, it has zero bearing on the Project event and its successes/failures.
---
Be glad you have strangler armor. Vault 94 is unplayable for my friends and I because the time lag of 20-30seconds to log into computers is a detriment to the time to finish the quest on XB1
---
Yeah I knew it's always been a problem but It does feel to have gotten way worse.
---
I'm on xbox 1. I agree it is unplayable.
---
Cap Collector, look up mappalachia on here and find the cap stash map, start in Poseidon, head east to Blackwater mine, ft to morgantown, loot all those stashes, its like an extra 1k caps a day above the 1400 vendor caps. Loot all ammo and sell it in your vendor, The perk that lets you search for more ammo in relevant containers is nice, too.
---
I used to be a QA so every bug just glares at me and it gets annoying.
---
I mean how long does it take to fix arm mods?
---
Brawler, aerodynamic and weighted worked in F4 and they do nothing since launch. 90% of the bug fixes could be done in an afternoon.
---
Been playing these games since morrowind and now it's turned into this dreck.
---
It’s called gambling. And Bethesda doesn’t have a way to restore lost game items,probably on purpose, so they don’t care
---
You were both on two separate consoles when you were both disconnected? Hmm. Weird.
---
It brings a more immersive experience. Also there are the perks that add a unique element to the game play. 
---
Sounds like you're not the target audience for this game mode, you'd probably like survival mode more. It sucks that it has been taken away, but I'm sure it will be back!
---
It increases the ap cost while doing nothing. Seems like a mistake that it exists.
---
It's not gambling if one of the rolls is the same for every item. I'm not pissed about that, tho, I'm pissed that I spent my scrips on a random item and now don't have the chance to use them for a discounted item I actually want to take the chance on.
---
Survival is offline for now/forever(?), so there has been a very small increase in griefers lately, but they have done a very good job to stop most of it. Be wary of team invites from unknown players, and workshops can still initiate PVP. Other than those few and far between instances, people are pretty amazing. Quite a few times I've given people 1000s of rounds of unneeded ammo, and people have done the same for me. Overall it's a great community.
---
Cookie cutter response = "oh...that's nice" or "what the hell is that?...are you on drugs?"
---
Bahahahahhahahahahahhaa. You know this would never happen right?
---
It would require the devs to actually be able to fix their stuff.
---
Yes I can send a friend request to myself or ignore myself O_o
---
Thank you for the clarification!
---
We got you brah! Congrats!
---
Why the downvotes for this? Is thanking someone for providing a good answer frowned upon in the fo76 community?
---
I didn’t go down the serum path until level 130ish. It’s very practical once you’re at the end game. 3 serums sell for 1300-1500 caps daily. At first, I would just buy them in bulk for cheap once I was close to max caps, then I started making my own.
---
I have a 45 bloodied ss buzzblade and even that sucks.
---
Vfast needs some serious buffs.
---
25% instead, I feel like that is a better deal.
---
If you were doing these things anyway, you already had a reason to, so I'm not sure why you'd write 'now we have a reason to'. :P
---
'It harms no one' is also a pretty terrible justification/defense of something, and it's certainly not a counter-argument to anything I wrote.
---
As far as your last point, 'for every person that isn't happy with the reward, another will be', that's not something I can seriously consider an argument. I mean yea, some people like what others don't, why is that useful here?
---
This guide has some good ideas:  [https://fextralife.com/fallout-76-the-ultimate-melee-build-guide/](https://fextralife.com/fallout-76-the-ultimate-melee-build-guide/) 
---
and lots of slugger perk cards for two-handed.
---
But they said scorched and scotchbeasts will still be around after Wastelanders, so maybe just contained to the Bog, not eradicated.
---
yes it can be soloed.  This weeks mission "dead in the water" it's helpful to have the perk aqua boy/girl as otherwise you will take a fuckton of rads in all the water.    
---
Other useful perks are exterminator and glow sight as there's a good amount of bugs and glowing ones.  
---
The mission rotates weekly so the advice above only applies until this weeks mission rotates out.
---
For non PA, i use straight unyeilding on all slots if I am running bloody or Vanguards if im Full Health..

ad victoriam
---
Meteoric Sword used to be marked as Legendary but no longer. I might have gotten one to drop at level 45 but 25 or 35 varieties are more typical. Its no longer considered legendary but is in the same category as the MoM weapons where it has legendary-like abilities but can’t be traded for scrip.
---
With a passion
---
I had one but sold it without testing and I regret it.
---
It is though, unfortunately a lot of posts on this sub consist of "This is fucking lazy! Give us more free shit!" every week, but they are significantly longer than need be.
---
radium rifle - massive recoil, middling damage, and middling magazines but yet it has INSANELY difficult to learn mods.  Other weapons that are better like handmade require probably 10% the number of weapons scrapped to learn the same amount of mods.  
---
So basically This gun should either stay the same as far as damage but have easier mods to learn, or get a massive buff to make it better than handmade/fixer but leave the mods super hard to learn.    
---
As it sits there's no real reason to go through the hassle of learning the mods for a gun you will replace the moment you get a handmade or fixer.
---
It would be nice instead of hit chance it would be range
---
Worst idea ever.
---
I've searched for quite a while and can find absolutely nothing about Ubisoft confirming crossplay for rainbow six seige.
---
If youre on xbox you can have one of mine. Free of charge.
---
I’ve had a great experience, I play on PS4. I actually make a point of making weapons and ammo and going around and gifting them to lower level players in an effort that they hopefully pay it forward. I’ve had people do the same for me, depends on the platform
---
I gues the last patch changed quite a bit because it wasnt always like that
---
Bye sis.
---
Yeah, coreross is a liar
---
Ripper is good if and pretty much only if you have vampires effect.  that thing will heal you about as fast as a stimpack.
---
I have asked for a 50x in addition to existing options, it's in their best interest as it will reduce crafting transaction hits on the server.
---
Well let’s go ahead and tag the Bethesda team on reddit here in a post about and see their typical response of ‘we are aware of this issue and we are going to talk to the team about it” with another post 3-4 months down the road titled ‘Bethesda why haven’t you fixed this yet?!’ with no response from the team members this time around. That’s about the most you’re going to get around these parts
---
You misspelled "deathclaw"
---
With 90% reduced weight
---
It's an Unstoppable Monster. Basically a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet with +40% power attack damage and -40% incoming damage while power attacking.  5k is actually small compared what you can get from [this build guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cafk2s/bloodied_melee_build_help/et8pppd/) that I borrowed from. I don't have Talons or Twisted Muscles because I main rifles, but I do often use [these food/drink/chem buffs](https://pastebin.com/ajsXpAs6), which stack together when you use one of each.
---
That’s why I sold mine
---
Buddy, I just wanted to complain. Let a guy complain. I know they're not gonna do anything about it.
---
Thanks! Were you one of the people attacking me and then destroying my camp? You're name looks familiar.
---
I just letting you know where your complaints are going that’s all. Just adding to the depression fire
---
Again, you're not telling me anything I didn't already know.
---
I've lost friends who quit because they lock up 100% of the time when trying to fight the SBQ due to this issue.  Legacy weapons also seem to cause a similar problem.  
---
Yet strangely some people are unaffected, I personally have no problems yet friends with better setups struggle.  
---
In any event I agree with OP, this needs to get fixed ASAP as it's costing the game players.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
They said new players will still be able to start the game like the day one players or start with wastelanders which leads me to believe they’ll have servers for the original wasteland and servers that are filled with the “wastelanders”
---
It definitely isn't mentioned in the cannibal perk card description
---
It would make the most sense, but they probably will still spawn in fissures
---
I'm pretty sure the omelette's in the game are not considered meat or vegetable. So you could get the herbivore and carnivore mutations and survive solely off omelette's.
---
Eso mismo pensé yo pero en ese caso las personas nuevas que lleguen con el nuevo dlc no verán estos enemigos ni a la reina lo cual no tendría mucho sentido en un punto de vista de juego.
---
Wowza! Ha...ok, I meant something a bit more vanilla! But hey to each his own!
---
And that thrill will pale in comparison to how you feel when you take down a level 50 Sentry Bot with that 1* Rolling Pin 😀
---
Where do people get those from? Bought a pair in a vending machine cause i thought they were neat for survival.
---
Holy heck I did not know the mission changes. I thought it was the same mission just with the option to change difficulty. Do you get different rewards based on that weeks mission?
---
I havent played in a while, but I could count on one hand the number of times I had a bad encounter, with a couple fingers to spare. I played the beta, so I did have a level advantage to keep any low level griefers away.
---
I had one guy stab me for like 15 minutes as I wandered the wasteland, since I didnt fight back, he couldnt do real damage. 
---
I helped out low levels whenever I found one.
---
Legendary script caps out at 1000 in your inventory. So spend a bit as you get close to your cap.
---
I mean if you want them to spend all their resources on some other event and delay wastelanders, ok?  Why are you concerned about my butt? Very odd
---
Thanks for the advice! I'll be sure to look into those options. I really appreciate the advice!
---
If Bethesda released a middle finger emote for 2000 atoms that would be the most hilarious update of all time! Basically flipping the bird to all the people complaining about atom store prices haha.
---
I wouldn't buy it, because that's stupid expensive. But I'd appreciate the balls that kind of update would take.
---
The dream
---
Griefing is almost a myth.  There are a few people out there who will try to bait you to PVP, then ambush you with a full crew, but those types are the very small minority. 
---
Most players in Adventure mode will be more likely to help you than not.  The ones that dont will most likely wave, and carry on what they were doing to begin with.   Some will invite you to group.
---
The online atmosphere is for lack of a better analogy, Neutral to very friendly, depending on who you meet.
---
Drove me nutts until I figured, ok, I'll go bury the guy but forget my shovel, it worked no more friqen announcement from him when I log in. As a plus, after I finally buried the guy a couple weeks later and  now when I go to Grafton station, he is silent.
---
It's ok, I was replaying a build and killed a level 50 legendary sheepsquatch at level 20. Thank God the game was buggy otherwise o would of been done
---
Also, all your purchases in the Atom Shop are available with all your characters -- except the repair kits
---
90% could be done in an afternoon? Well then, you should probably apply for a job there. It sounds like you know best and could really turn things around.
---
I'll miss you!
---
"Journalists" haha. Real joke is always in the comments.
---
Last patch added both scout masks to the jumpsuits. Before patch you've been given 4 jumpsuit together.
---
Chemist + Super Duper + 30 minutes on the river near flatwoods 
---
Make Healing Salves.
---
Sell for profit.
---
Thank you for the info. This is great. I have the really ventured into the mire much yet but I guess it’s time.
---
With backpacks, deep pocket armor mods, and weight reduction legendary effects....I can't fast travel in PA xD
---
I did the same thing last night, I'm hoping a vendor will have them or I'll just get them on my second account.
---
People wandered down from Detroit through like 4 other major cities to get to West Virginia? 
---
Why wouldn't they be from Cincinnati or Lexington or somewhere closer?
---
I can promise you that it is.  I'm a legit 826. Never done vertibird or traps. I even got tagged in this thread because one guy thought it was me that this person saw.
---
Because Bethesda is lazy and just clumped all the legendaries together. They only played attention to a few things like no faster swing speed on guns.
---
Uhm no it doesn't? It bypasses DR/ER(on energy weps) nothing else
---
You can trade in today's crap for about 500 scrip, it would take the fun out of it if you got god rolls all the time
---
Lol I use that term loosely
---
What did you expect? It’s just a random roll except you don’t choose armor or weapon. That’s how purveyor has always worked.
---
I've been let down too many times. I think everyone eventually hits that point with certain games. In most respects, it's a good game. Fighting constant stability issues and core glitches, though, is too much. And the direction of the game has shifted from a brutal wild west to a hand-holding line dance. It's just turning into something that's not for me.
---
It's also worded weird. Its +100% so if your vats chance was 20 its now 40. Thought i was going to use a Harpoon as a heavy sniper but nope.
---
I think (theory) that they’ll have two different types of servers kinda like adventure and survival except one will be the adventure we have now with all scorched roaming around and the others will be the new wastelanders dlc. Servers
---
Again?
---
I scrapped everything to do with it in way of protest, pretty boring really and they where more often than not just a couple of others or none turn up :(
---
You're misunderstanding my complaint. All melee weapons dropped with limb damage, so they removed the mystery pick and replaced it with a 25% off discount that I cannot take advantage of because I used my scrips on the broken mystery pick.
---
Ya feel that.  Wooooooooooooosh!
---
I am sorry. My girlfriend and I kill Sheepsquatch together
---
No see people have fixed a bunch of the bugs already (for pc anyway)
---
If they do one maybe it’ll be someone in a crashed ship who’s scavenging from it... although you’re right about the Mole Miner so maybe Female Zetans are friendly too?
---
be patient, the time is coming for that 3\* Berserkers Radium rifle with +DR while aiming and Increased Vats hit chance.
---
Wow I never knew it worked like that
---
Also, I wouldn't want this to happen, it was rage induced sarcasm.
---
It's nothing new with any pc game
---
Yes!  That's the reaction I was going for.  Well done!
---
It took me literally 40 minutes to kill my first one.
---
We’re probably out of the zone to safely get a female gremlin version of a zetan all dolled up hilariously but that would be great, like trrryying to be human idk haha
---
I was more just making a joke about the deca would never be able to fix it. 
---
And I'm pretty sure there would be serious issues if BGS sold other people's mods
---
*I agree with you.
---
Sorry? So you spent what... 180 scrip? And you were able to cash those in for 120 scrip? So you are out 60 scrip? That stinks.
---
Well whats rare is getting a good roll all together. Explosive weapons aren’t necessarily expensive either. Good rolls are.
---
Well in this insane alternate universe they would pay the creators a small amount for the right to use them.
---
*edit* creation club type thing.
---
Unfortunately, there isn't and I don't think there ever will be a better nor more useful build than bloodied stealth commando. With the correct armor it's by far the best build for PVE.
---
(24/7 pvp player) 2 pcs Bolstering/Sentinel Leather 2 pcs unyielding/sentinel combat and 1 chameleon/sentinel combat and energy resistance / ballistic resistance backpack (change in different situations) works best for me.
---
Weapons: BE/-25% Railway , Quad/explo Railway, BE Laser , B/FFR Tesla , B/FFR Handmade , B/FFR/-25% Plasma Rifle shreds everything.
---
I also use a strangler heart / BE plasma gatling char if i fight more than 4 ppl alone
---
Until Wastelanders.
---
Patch 15 has to be Wastelanders, right ?
---
Everyone will be going gang bang on his ass once they give him a human figure. Or we mey nuke him witch ever or both.
---
I feel like I get them all the time from purveyor.
---
He did say "further", which implies he knows how unbalanced the game is.
---
Plus, just because a game isn't balanced is no reason to make it less balanced. If anything it's a reason to be more cautious when implementing things that might effect the game balance.
---
Congrats! I use reddit exclusively to chat about things I’m interested that none of my friends or family care about!
---
I have gotten 1 explosive weapon from a drop, it was a Mutants 10mm Pistol, I still use it for low end quests when I dont want to 1 shot everything.
---
All the rest of mine I had to find from players.
---
They do seem to drop very rarely, especially with a decent prefix.
---
Still Mothmanning it. Although I've been tinkering with outfits, haven't found one a truly love with my Mothman helmet.
---
Any suggestions? Right now I have the lab coat on. Have cycled through both golf outfits, Maxon coat, Nuka Cola outfits, Drifter, greaser, ritual rags, and the Civil War clothes.
---
Dun worry. I'm at a gaming stage that i aint surprise at anything that breaks in this game. All i do now is walk around helping lower level groups leveling up. I cant even join teams at all
---
Just do the mission shut him the hell up for me.
---
I have a couple 3\* radium rifles i've been holding onto hoping they'll make them a little better. Slowly saving mats to do another Radium Rifle scrap fest. I made like 80 recently and learned 1 mod for it lol. It's such a cool concept weapon, too. I learned recently it counts as an energy weapon so Science perk works to make them cost a bit less, I'll have to try that when I get enough mats saved up again.
---
Classic Poe situation here. Either way, I don't really care if you think my frustration is warranted or not.
---
I've seen several people this week having crafting issues with anything that includes ultracite it seems like ammo an serums.
---
WAIT. The game that was marketed as having no human NPCs ACTUALLY has no human NPCs???? Wtf..
---
I'm really happy its in the game, but the bugginess of it makes for some serious frustration.
---
Also, if I'm being honest, I'm just incredibly untalented at architecture and design. I see these amazing houses, and then everything I build ends up as a series of boxes. At least in FO4 my shame was hidden from others' judgemental view.
---
So if those robots were people you would like this game? I honestly don’t understand your post. Or you are mad that you have quests to do?
---
AA doesn't negate sentinel effect! Only vats crits do. AA just ignores a amount of DR/ER
---
Explain further????
---
If they were raiders or soldiers I'd feel more into it.
---
That’s literally all they said in the inside the vault!
---

---
“Our next big update, Patch 14, is coming to the Fallout 76 later this month. Stay tuned for more details on what’s in store with the patch, including a mischief-filled new Seasonal Event.”
---
Way to just sneak that in there guys!
---
Sounds like he was mad he found one of the rare griefer assholes and didnt server jump to avoid him.
---
Yeah I think Rose is a great NPC. Being a robot doesn't detract from her charm at all.
---
I thought they were adding human NPC's. I figured after the big update we just got.
---
May even get that Stalkers tire iron with +1 agility and reflects 50% of damage while blocking.
---
Ah ok I remember seeing that and thinking what aliens lol
---
I can give for free if you’re on PS4, didn’t want to sell, but will be happy to give away if someone would actually use and appreciate it.
---
And I don't dislike the game at all. I like the lore and the weapon crafting...I just wanted more.
---
you will eventually get the plans you need.  I have 2 characters that know all 16 plans and the last 2 or 3 took maybe a dozen standard/expert completions to learn give or take.  
---
by the time you have enough steel to make a full strangler hear set you will know the plans unless you've been mostly running novice.
---
She is a raider. Did you actually pay attention when doing her quests? Did you read terminals and listen to holotapes? Pretty great story.
---
Not at all. She’s awesome.
---
Yeah, there's really no down side for being low level in this game, PVP is pretty much optional, outside of workshops, so all you really need to do is...show up to events and farm and level.
---
🤔
---
Yes. Friend had a mierlurk king.
---
... It's gotten a hell of a lot more playable since launch, I don't know what to tell you. It's bethesda, so it will always be buggy trash you play for the environment and story.
---
Wastelanders with the human NPCs doesn't come out until November
---
Yes, that's sure. That is why I wish they would go for maintenance earlier before they crash and people loose stuff in the middle of an event or something.
---
STOMP STOMP STOMP, *leap* SLAM! STOMP STOMP.... Yeah, that's weird, sneak should work in PA... lol
---
Thank you. All the media coverage made it seem like it was sooner.
---
I think I paid 80 bucks for some special edition. Only regret is I didn’t get the PA edition.
---
Not true. Shoot them once then you can use vats
---
What can i ask make a human texture is the make or break for you? Did you not pay attention to the story? I legit wonder what people are on about with this argument.
---
I've heard players are merciless and will destroy it in a heartbeat.
---
These are the people who put a negative value on charisma checks in F4 and made it so the higher your skill the less likely you were to succeed and never fixed it.
---
There's no helping willful incompetence.
---
If I'm not mistaken, it was supposed to come out sooner, but the date was pushed back. Hopefully they will make it worth the wait.
---
I had the same concern until i realized i was scraping them automatically each time i was using at workbench, then i started droping or stocking it before using a workbench to avoid accidental scraping.
---
Thank for being positive dude. I appreciate if.
---
The game autoscraps it when you do some things like crafting. This is a reason why you see some people with bug parts or rare junk in their vending for 25000.
---
I’m 100% sure I’m not scrapping them. I also wondered if it might be a bug with the Stings and Things quest where maybe it’s taking all the parts instead of just 1 of each. I’m going to watch that next time and see if that’s what’s happening.
---
You should go down there and show them how it’s done
---
Mystery pick this week. Discounts next round
---
This need more attention! My alt character is a bloodied melee/shotgunner and the only ranged weapon I carry is bloodied explosive 250Dr while reload pump shotgun, but now cause of this its almost unusable, have to constantly re-equip it to do normal amounts of damage which is very annoying:(
---
If you run out of something whilst crafting the game will find something in your junk it can get it from. That's how I understand it anyway. Bloodbug proboscis scraps to either acid or antiseptic, I can't remember which, so if you were smelting say and didn't have enough acid, that's probably where it went.
---
Then I can sorta see why no one is talking about it really lol. Not much to talk about until we get more info
---
Welp, I’ve got no mystery pick and 25% Off right now.  🤷‍♂️
---
Don't forget butchers bounty for getting more tick blood for making stimpaks and more excess meat to sell.
---
Auto scrapping them when you craft. Say making gun powder it's breaking them down for acid.
---
That's awesome! They just don't get it, their loss. I'd be so mad if my boyfriend killed a Sheepsquatch without me - I wanna be there to share that success lol. When we killed our first higher level Deathclaw in the game together we went into photo mode immediately to take selfies with our prize. :D
---
Ah, maybe that’s it! If it needs one of the components in the part when I’m crafting. I didn’t realize that might be happening. Thanks!
---
Well fuck. I got mystery pick and no discount. You better spend up.
---
There was an issue with the mystery pick it has been changed to a discount
---
Thank you! That probably explains it.
---
Only if 4 star legendaries always spawn from the sheepsquatch imposter, the scorchbeast queen, the Arkos Pharma bosses, and the end of vault 94.
---
What was the issue?
---
Gotcha! Thank you!
---
"Here's a keyring! But you now have to select all of your keys manually. Enjoy!"
---
I think melee weapons were only getting limb damage.
---
I don't see why you would not want other people to also get a weapon if it's not in direct competition to you
---
Legend!
---
Immersion: 100
---
So do we know if we buy melee weapons with the discount it’ll have the same issue?
---
It’s a tease. Usually people speculate on this stuff.
---
Put a stack in one of your vendors for max caps. Takes up 4 slots assuming you're doing the daily and that stops it from scrapping.
---
More than a few players have noted that doing the quest ends the notification, but if you just start it and then deselect the quest in your PipBoy that also works. 
---
BTW there is usually a shovel by the big tree behind you and to the right of the open grave.
---
Used to be able to trigger them. Now I’m just triggered.
---
Supply/demand...if I want to sell it for big caps
---
Most ppl speculate when we get a little more info or a tease I’d not even call this a tease really they are just saying hey stay turned for a event not much we can guess with that info alone
---
Haha so true...
---
Games too cheap for perma bans to matter. They should but it wouldn't change anything.
---
Dude my bloodied pole hook was incredible. It was only level 10 and would wreck ghouls in whitespring
---
Thats almost as awesome as the Hunters Rolling Pin with +Cha and Vats Dmg
---
Oh well I feel teased lol
---
😃👍
---
That’s too bad. One of the first things I got was junkies explosive combat rifle.
---
Good thing I'm on XBox or I would win all your caps.
---
Was it confirmed not to be added by Data miners?
---
Awesome tip. Thank you!
---
That one makes no sense to downvote, since it makes bethesda aware of bugs they might not know about. I actually really enjoy the game, but I'm not going to defend the denial from people thinking it isn't broken.
---
 Lol this isn't wasteland publishers clearing house
---
Crap...  let's hope they add all that and more come wastelanders
---
You find the plan to craft it on the body of a trick or treater in the Mire. See my post above for her location. Of if you’re on PS4 I can craft one for you?
---
Griefing is pretty nonexistent now. They built in so many protections. If you liked 4, especially exploring and killing bad guys, you should like this.
---
Sheepsquatch questline.
---
It could be =)
---
Mine isn't great.
---
There are definitely more interesting ways to play than that, fortunately. That said, one of my alt chars is that build.
---
Damn, that almost beats my furious dragon with 40% bashing and move faster while aiming.
---
Makes sense. Got distracted on that. Now have 2 reasons to finish it up and start buying the recall things.
---
I agree, but interesting isn't always OP LOL and I'd rather be OP and save my ammo etc.
---
Plus, if I wanted to use melee I'd play elder scrolls.
---
I don’t think rewards change but there are 3 missions on rotation.
---
Furious Dragon.    I want to see that on a Queen
---
The bashing damage is a necessity especially when theres 2 enemies
---
Many thanx! Been frustrated as shit lol
---
In this kind if contests you should make categories. Because one guy makes a fantastic house,but the cake goes to the eccentric one that made a maze using bear rugs.
---
That’s why it’s a superior weapon.
---
Oh the horror! 🙄
---
I care bro congratulations
---
Yeah I know that.  Just be nice to be able to trigger them again with the notifications now but still keep a rotation going when people arent doing specific ones.
---
Wonderful.
---
This guy got "pocket change".
---
It works if you're wanted when you smack them.
---
" Yeah, it took a little while to get her warmed up, she sure is a stubborn one "
---
You'll be judged on either strictly function or artistry or both, depending on what you prefer.  If your turrets are on point that's just as impressive as whimsical artistry.
---
Agreed. I just couldn’t help making the pun.
---
 Buy a PS4 and another copy farm it up and win like a champ :)
---
It's technically possible. You'd need to find a tamable that is also chosen to be legendary.
---
The odds of that are probably less than finding a tamable deathclaw in a nuke zone,to get a lvl 91 pet.
---
 After this massive random chance,it could die anytime for absolutely no reason.
---
tbh builds matter less the only good perks r those that make u resilient like adamantium skeleton and aquaboy. usually people dont use stealth because they are against time so running is important especially in expert. rads is one of the most problematic things especially in 2nd mission so PA is good situationally. otherwise id say experience is the strongest factor. try not to solo on expert maybe on the 1st mission dead in the water is possible but 2nd and 3rd is like 99% impossible for humans. anyway there are cheese methods on every mission to help u save time, lots of time so be sure to find them out
---
Not anymore.
---
I have killed a scorched  Yao guai, Megasloth and Wendigo several times outside of scorched earth and none of them have counted for the weekly challenge.
---
Also needed:
---
\-BOS hunting rifle
---
\-alien blaster
---
\-drill/chainsaw
---
\-paddle ball
---
\-Commie Whacker
---
\-Enclave weapons
---
\-Pro Snap
---
Thanks also for the vending machine tip. Another fellow said that also. I haven’t seen people do that so now I know.
---
And ARE meant to be played together
---
They said they are not affected
---
No they said it didn’t effect the regular purchases only the mystery roll
---
I'm sure they can just look at Diablo 3 and figure out how to implement something like that with legendary mats and rerolling a stat etc.
---
They swapped it. It’s 25% discount right now.
---
Known on PlayStation. Call it a blue screen which freaked me out on pc cause a blue screen means your hard drive is toast.
---
The wastelands are surprisingly warm and fuzzy. If you enjoy collecting stuffed animals and joining the scouts this is the place for you.
---
It is back. Apparently they don’t know what they are doing. What a surprise for us all!
---
Pro status on the title!
---
Glad to hear you had a great experience with your first encounter with the devil of Appalachia.Sadly mine was rather underwhelming.I was running down the road in the east end of the ash heap and ran right into one.I started off with a power attack from my instigating grognak.That hit took out his entire health bar.But instead of normal legendary regen the bar refilled and then automatically drop all the way again and he fell over.My other encounters since have been more involved but you never get your first time back.
---
They’re actually bringing meat week back again as the ‘event’
---
To be fair you knew what to expect when you joined this game, heck this was a issue previously so it was well known to come back eventually like all bugs. We both know you ain't getting it back but take my upvote in hopes Bethesda actually cares enough to make amends.
---
Took down my first one when I was in the upper 30's.  Stumbled across it fighting a half dozen Scorched.  Put on my PA waited until the Scorched we're dead.  They had managed to get it to make its mutation luckily,.Then  I pounded down a couple Furys and grabbed my 51 dmg knife and jumped in.  It killed me once and I used a half dozen Stimpacks but I killed my first Sheepsquatch in hand to hand combat.
---
With a standard backpack my carry out of armor is higher than in everything except Excavator.  PA needs a boost in that area.  As a heavy weapon user the difference between my DR in PA and out is negligible for everything except Rads.
---
The extra weight for weapons and ammo is worth more than the extra protection.
---
And I have no perks that improve carry weight and no pocketed armor.
---
So how well do you do in tight corners say the West Tec or rad filled area like the Vault Raid?
---
Can I name myself RimjobDaPounder, wear a sequin dress, and chase people with an ax? Immersion this game ain't.
---
?? How is there meat cleavers on the ground and not in a brown lunch bag??
---
sorry to say, but it's not recent, i've been stuck on this for the possum badge since the badges came out. And i've posted and reported about it the first month, and have since just moved on. It'll get fixed when it gets fixed, I'm pretty sure the coders would fix it on 2 seconds.  But it all comes down to Management priorities, and i'm too cynical to think it's high enough to matter yet.
---
I Havn't tried the time modes yet. I am looking for some seasons psn vets that are willing to show ke the ropes of that god forsaken place lol.
---
One time I was doing okay with killing a sheepsquatch. I was going through tons of ammo and stims, and a scorched beast showed up and killed me.
---
Well, you just lost out on 40% more crap, from my experience.  
---
I feel your loss.
---
disabling aric will make the animals aggressive to enemies and heal between rounds.  
---
If your goal is to get the best rewards it's a bad idea to disable aric.  Even though they heal in between rounds they aggro everything and are more likely to die. You can only get the best rewards like bear arm mod plans if all 3 friendly animals survive.  
---
If your only goal is to complete the event successfully and you don't care about getting the best rewards, then disabling aric can make that easier so long as you don't have a lot of firepower in each biome.  
---
Generally speaking I think the best approach is to let ARIC run the experiment and just have 2+ people per biome with strong damage guard the friendlies.  This gives you the best chance to have all 3 survive.
---
Lode Barring is the only Public Event that's in the Ash Heap, which should imply that all the others still work as they usually do.
---
I think the underlying problem is that most players simply don't have a reason to go to the Ash Heap, and so many of the events don't trigger.
---
I've been in on a few sub-15 second queen kills we did with unarmed melee. Not saying you can't do that with rifles but I sure haven't seen it.
---
lol  
---
Well, unless you got a ton of melee weapons, you still got a reasonable deal.
---
Well you are asking for a more complex community event... which sounds like development would be needed...
---
I didn't go hardcore, but rolled 3-4 per day (including many failures with no rewards). Got 2 tenderizers, 2 salt and 1 pepper mod. All about that RNG.
---
*Fine*, I'll do the quest. But I won't like it, goddamn it.
---
Melee is undoubtedly broken for damage I'll admit, but as I said before. If I wanted to swing a sword id play elder scrolls.
---
Soldier's on the front line don't swing swords today, so I don't want to either.
---
Hoping for trick or treat evevt
---
That would piss me off. I love my all rise.
---
