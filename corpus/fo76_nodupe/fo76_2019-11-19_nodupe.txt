The whales are going to kill the game they love so much. Ironic.
---
or just let us use power fists with power armor
---
Wow! I got it. It’s my Protective Brotherhood Officer Suit. I had no idea it gave my strength a buff. I thought it was just for protection. Thanks friend! :)
---
No. If anything they got a lot easier. There are no more camera-requiring challenges and little to no ones that require other players. Just after logging into the game the other day I killed the molerat brood mother that often spawns at my base only to get a notification I received 20 Atoms since that turned out to be one of that day's challenges. You can now easily get 60, sometimes 70 Atoms a day and relatively easily 150-180 Atoms a week. Over the last two weeks I amassed 1100 Atoms by doing the in-game challenges alone :)
---
Legendary points in Strength from the armor or underarmor?
---
Np.  Now get yourself a shielded version for even more bonus. :-)
---
Thanks, its two characters to dump out, which location would be best to meet in game?
---
Yeah? What kind of bonus and from where do I get it?
---
If your goal is to keep all 3 friendlies alive this is a bad idea.  I've completed this quest with all 3 friendlies at least 30 or 40 times and not once did we shut down the computer.
---

---
Only time it's a good idea is if there's only 1 or 2 other players as it helps make sure at least 1 survives long enough to spawn the alpha.
---
Wherever you'd like. My camp, Vault 76, some sketchy location on the edge of a fissure. Not picky.

Clicking the link on bethesda's page that point to:

Ended up googling the exe and finding it elsewhere that downloaded fine.  All is good now
---
NO ONE CARES
---
Pretty sure shielded gives you a + 3 to strength, find somebody that knows the plan that can apply it or some people sell the shielded version for around 1K.
---
the event goes away too soon and people complain, bring the event back and people complain.
---
it looks like to me that: 
---
(A) there is no pleasing some game fans.
---
(B) people like to complain and will seek out any reason to do so.
---
Ok. I mean is it random drop or do vendor bots sell it?
---
Glad you sorted it out, hope you get back to wandering the wastes again.
---
it ain’t much but it’s honest work

The stickied patch notes have had 0 upvotes for an entire patch lifecycle 😮

No, it's alright, some Canadians sound like Americans anyway

Oh my. That’s unkind. I personally like a good story.

Kiwi is a weird muddle between Australian and weak British accent

I like it 😊

Wrong sub bro
---
Well, your camp will be fine,
---
I want the take 10 photos of players while challenges to come back even briefly. We have a team member who is our reluctant photo model so to make it faster for him we would do as many as possible in one photo. The most hilarious one to date was him running around naked at Whitesprings, wearing a mask, on chems and intoxicated while in combat and dying.

I’ve almost forgotten what the roof of my camp looks like!

"All things that are exponentially more difficult to do online"
---
Oh I'm sorry, you had a hard time using email online? Tell me more. 
---
Also, this is a story you've read. It's a reddit story. The OP may be telling the full truth, or not. Do you believe whatever any random poster types? Do you go around frequently basing your rage-filled arguments on those things you read?
---
Ok try this: I won a million dollars yesterday. You want some? Send me your bank numbers and I'll set up a transfer. You're clearly invested in the truthiness of internet strangers so I'm sure this will end well. ;)
---
take your pills and go drool in the corner, wally
---
Agree.
---
It was bad with disconnects and quests and bugs. It was good because there were so many legendary enemies and you could level up much much faster.
---
Wasnt as bad as the youtubers made it sound
---
They seemed easier these past 4 weeks. At least compared to the Previous few months. They're still not as easy as the first few months after launch but definitely better than the vault raid ones.
---
I only started playing in the last few months. I know few more people that lost item recently so maybe "rare but possible" would be a more accurate description. Crashes have been on increase in recent weeks for me so I'm worried it may happen again.
---
You can't hit a moving target. That qualifies you as bad, unless I need someone who can take out a rock or a tree.
---
Here's proof that what I'm saying is true. You claim that Frog Legs is some unbeatable advantage. So what would happen if you took a horrible sniper (me) and asked me to hit your so-called Frog Leg abuser, Mack? 
---
IMAGE 1 - what's this? Someone using Frog Legs??? I'll never be able to hit him! NERF IT!

You can buy one for around 10-15k or get lucky from the encrypted event
---
it happens to a lot of us.  people post about it all the time also
---
Thanks for the guidance, maybe one day I will get around to it.
---
Watched a stream yesterday and no, it's not fixed.
---
Maybe they had pacifist on and didn't realize like a dumbass.
---
"What are they dropping exactly? They barely post anything in an official capacity."
---
Good call. I'm sure Bethesda is paying their CMs to breathe in their own farts in a cubicle somewhere. Surely they're doing nothing that could be more important than coming to reddit 'in person' to soothe a bunch of mouth-breathing pitchfork-waving morons.
---
Yea, I'd have totally be all over that in any job I've ever had.
---
But apparently you're the pro on CMs. Can you explain the many, many complaints on many, many forums that don't get a CM response? Because that's just what they do and posting angry notes on subreddits for CS is just smart, right?  xD
---
I like farming water.
---
well, its definitely common sense enough that someone else like me thought of it afterwards as well.  So it must be lingering in the back of more people's minds too.  
---
Great idea!
---
I dont care.. I just bought fixers from vendors
---
lol you spammed my inbox. And you've had plenty of responses to think about already. Blocked.
---
There's a church in Point Pleasant that was setup as a medic station. I find about 10-15 chems. Don't forget to turn on Pharma Farma and doing the search on first aid kits, first aid bags, chem boxes and bathroom mirrors.

But no one gives a shit. It's the dullest thing in the game bar killing sq
---
You get to choose a card every level, and you get a pack every 5.
---
It annoys me that stingwing barbs aren't auto scrapped but all the other insect parts like blood sacs and Bloatfly glands will auto scrap. 
---
There should be an option to favourite scrap items.
---
&gt; I have very real evidence in the fact that recently i went 13 days with basically no actual responses and having to make tickets every day to try to get some sort of response from customer service.
---
And what does that have to do with the veracity of the other player's claims about being hacked, getting no response for 2 months, and having his tickets deleted? 
---
Your life experience does not factually support the completely different life experience of another person just because you had a common goal...

I like it when salty people who are seeking to reinforce their bias start to engage in conspiracy theory to explain simple things they don't understand. 
---
It turns me on so much.
---
I don't care about a lot of things I see but I guess other people do so I let them enjoy their side of the internet while I farm my mutfruits on the other side
---
No, I don't believe shielded is sold by any of the vendors, only the ones leading up to it.
---
Depending on which shielded it is it goes for a lot. BOS shielded is usually only one or two k , I think I have one in my vending machine right now but I'm on Xbox.
---
It's better to do novice with the same group you'd be with later ,and learn your role.
---
Fair enough, I'll get the guy in my group who usually shuts it off to stop, personally I've never noticed much of a difference when it's on/off but if it's better to leave off I'll make sure we leave it on. Cheers for the tip.
---
Just so you know, some time ago, if you stored your information on the launcher, it was stored in the server side as plain text. A hacker found it out and reported it, next day there was an emergency patch, but Beth didn't tell anyone to change passwords.
---
This is why you enable 2fA in the Bethesda launcher.
---
Yes .. the harpoon gun is my new favourite "FunGun" since sat. evening... i didn't   
---
know that they can be so great. i got a bloody explo :D
---
Wait, so even when i'm defending my own workshop, i appear as red while sneaking and chameleon? i guess sneaking is pointless in PvP then?
---
Coming from a dude who visits....Less....then...respectable.....places......Im not quite certain how this happens. There are so many ways to protect your information. Its a little befuddling to me. Perhaps OP just didn't know how? Like I find it cute when people say they will "Hack me" or send pout phishing emails...Especially considering they are so damn old and still work lmao. Mabe I am just throwing it outa proportion but it just seems strange that his account magically got winded away. I wonder if he to gose to....Not respectable...places....But isnt smart about it? Reminds me of all the gold sellers in RS that made all their money off stealing the accounts of the pll that bought from them LOL
---
He attacked me outside the workshop as well though
---
h come on Evan was fun. How many times did you go to kill him? When you finally got him, how did you feel? ;)
---
I wish we could have a bigger camp and settlers so I could relax and have a beer with them.
---
Saw a scan of a support ticket on a FB group, they’ve obviously been given the exact statement from the ITV to be copy/pasted as a response
---
Sometimes that wouldn't even help. Specifically when 2 and 3 star deathclaws fall through the map. This happens to me all the time...
---
&gt;Oh I'm sorry, you had a hard time using email online? Tell me more.
---
I have no problem sending an email. Getting someone to respond? Completely out of my hands. Getting someone to respond in person? Much easier. Trying to get someone you don't know the name of, or can see, to respond to you on good faith from across the planet? Not as easy as being in a store dealing with actual people. They can't usually pretend you don't exist and teleport you out of the store and block you.  
---
&gt;But maybe you're right, and posting angry threads on a reddit forum that  isn't even run by the company involved is the best way to resolve a  hacking. Surely that's reasonable! 
---
As opposed to what? Sending an email or a filing a CS ticket that gets deleted? Yeah that clearly works. You do realize that doing things the professional way failed right? that these posts only exist because the sensible, polite method was rejected by the people you're coddling. Posting here makes it public. It serves as a warning. Game companies tend to do whatever they want, until it becomes news.  
---
Speaking of sensible, what is your end game here? What do you hope to accomplish, by berating anyone who complains about bad customer service?
---
&gt; Also, because your final angry moment made me giggle, you should  remember thatthis is a story you've read. It's a reddit story. The OP  may be telling the full truth, or not. Do you believe whatever any  random poster types? Do you go around frequently basing your rage-filled  arguments on those things you read? 
---
Ah you see, I don't think it did. I think it pissed you off. Your ego now prevents you from moving on. You need to keep doubling down on your Bethesda defending. Oh I completely understand it's a reddit story. I also understand that the sheer amount of bullshit that this company is guilty of over the last year alone, makes it more than a little likely. Your good faith is naive at this point. *But it's really all about defending yourself from people who have a problem with something you like, isn't it?*  
---
&gt; Ok try this: I won a million dollars yesterday. You want some? Send me  your bank numbers and I'll set up a transfer. You're clearly invested in  the truthiness of internet strangers so I'm sure this will end well. ;) 
---
Who did you win it from? Did you win it from the company you bought lottery tickets from? Or did you get from a random email?  
---
One would think, with as much practice at defending Bethesda, you'd have better arguments than this embarrassing display. Because clearly a multi-billion dollar company deleting support tickets with no word as to why, is totally sensible to you.
---
It was my friend and yes you can simply drop the frame with the piece you want to trade.
---
The market currently bans people who try to trade that PA for the stupid reason that is considered griefing,since some people have lag around it. It's worth top level trades for a single piece anyway.
---
Didn't say unbeatable, it simply isn't fun or belong whatsoever. Don't know what your problem is. You still never answered why your defending this. It needs a real nerf or be removed like it should've been in the first place. 
---
It's simply true the game would be better without it. I told you it just ruins the game. A real nerf would make jumping cost AP . That might actually fix it a little. but reality is it doesn't belong.
---
I like to Use concentrated fire on the mini nuke and wreck his friends as well :)
---
Yeah, i already own the game for my PS4 but it's hard to get into when i've already built a character on PC that used to be efficient but i guess they nerfed mutant-stealth builds into the ground since the release. Haven't played since then, to be honest and i was enjoying myself until i found myself without the means to quick-travel to events or buy the plans i need to improve my weapons. Not to mention that the DR i had with my unarmored build seems to have lowered?
---
Oh just recognized your name. Lol your a frogger too if I remember correctly
---
Same here. Played since the Beta with a team of 5 still all playing, still all loving. Saying F76 sucks is super trendy and big brain move, I mean its not like people scream on the internet for attention in 2019 or anything.
---
Honestly, it feels like it was almost triple digit times. But in reality, it was probably closer to 50 or 60. 
---
I wasnt happy when i killed him though. I was playing with my little brother and he still had to do it then, so it was just like an "ugh, one more time now." 
---
After my brother finally killed him, i think it was a lot of "thank fucking christ"s and a lot of bitching about how much bullshit it was. 
---
Then, like all trauma in my life, i repressed it.
---
 Well, tried to. Lol.
---
To be fair you can complete regardless if you have enough people and most importantly enough damage in each biome.  Killing all the things immediately including the alpha = win :P
---
Ok. No problem. Thank you! :)
---
Yeah, i guess i was given a false first impression last night. Was enjoying my time at the industrial farm thingy because people came there, saw me and left me alone so i thought that's what players were like now. :(
---
Really wasn't expecting some goon to crash in at level 250 and take it from me simply because they could
---
You demanded a refund for a game you still play so much that you bought the subscription??? 
---
That’s like saying the food you ordered was horrible after you licked the plate clean... 
---
Messed up and abusing the system...
---
I am offended. Wallace is perhaps the best Bot in the game and you have appropriated his name. 
---
 The rest checks out, and_Vomit is what you are.
---
Love this idea!
---
Unsure. It would probably depend on the definition of "fraud" in this case.
---
Yeah, i was definitely an easy target since i only reached level 50 yesterday after a year's(ish) long break and my unarmed stealth mutant build seems to have been ruined by some nerf.
---
How exactly does high agility stop berry mentats though? Does it simply make you not visible?
---
So let me get this straight. You are worried about them fixing the game because you want to remember the bad times?  Do you play the game or are you just a person who comes on here for the karma?
---
I'm not asking for anything.  Just trying to understand why you take it as a personal affront other people will have more time to earn something you already earned.  Like they are going to cheapen your experience or take something from you.
---
I get it's a grind.  I only did 3500 and tapped out so kudos to 14k, I dont have it in me.  But if someone else gets an extra 5 days to hit 3500 and gets the same skins as me it's honestly not going to affect me in the least. Those skins and outfits have zero value beyond personal satisfaction.  You cant sell them or trade them.  Even if they have double the time as me they still have to grind out the same xp I did so it's not like they were just given to them as you're suggesting.
---
You obviously didn't play at launch
---
&gt;i clicked on the recovery button
---
You weren't hacked, you were phished. and you phell for it. I just checked. no option of their account recovery page asks you for password or CC#.
---
my customer support experience as well as those of the people i have talked to are the validation. The fact that the community managers have said there are problems with the customer support system is also proof. I have all the evidence that would be needed to show that the customer support generally is not doing their jobs. The only other reasoning could be that the software they are using for handling tickets is very very bad and/or they don't know how to actually use it. What I and others from the datamining group have had to go through in the past month shows that there's something very wrong with the support system for this game.

Fusion cores for me I've never paid attention to but considering they're a looted item I can see luck effecting their charge.

Gatling Plasmas are the best of the heavies right now.   They fixed  heavies a good 6 months ago, along with all energy weapons. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Stability is very much improved.  No more DCing 15 times an hour.
---
I love how this article just straight up lied multiple times. For instance they said wastelanders would be delayed again so they can add more to fallout 1st. When the source they credited said wastelanders might come early due to the increased money from fallout 1st.
---
Nice!  These bugs I like.  Server crash bugs?  No bueno.
---
this pisses me off so bad, needs a fix badly.
---
There really not
---
Probably Karma.
---
Very cool, neat job with the building's structure too. 
---
I'm making my first camp in the Ash Heap right now and I love the ambience/lighting!
---
In case you needed actual proof as to what they ask you when you seem to have a compromised account:
---
 https://imgur.com/ZG7eqFW
---
Not sure who told you that, also if you wanted to fight it and sue for a refund you are bound by their arbitration agreement.
---
If by "spamming your inbox", you mean respond to several of your comments on a message board, then yeah. You do what you gotta do, champ. Even if you were doing the same to others long before I showed up.
---
They buffed energy weapons in damage they do and they dont break immediately anymore. Idk what specific issue you had as i rarely used that weapon.  Im on ps4 and may get a blue screen here and there. Not consistent but sometimes when a patch comes out they can increase.
---
 OK. I probably did it 20 times or so but I was expecting it to fail when it actually worked, and I was pleased. 
---
 I'm not a heavy quester so I take these things less seriously perhaps.
---
Any End user license agreement that breaks consumer protection laws aren't legally binding, as it is a breach of an existing law!
---
Sweeet. I might just redownload the game specifically because i can use my gatlibg plasma again. Running out of shots prematurely regardless of how much ammo you still had ras ridiculous coupled with the one shot and stop after reloading. 
---
Side note, did they ever fix Anti armor for energy weapons?
---
Yeah plus anyone who ran with Rex in NV would know it's definitely implementable and very helpful.
---
As someone who ran Boone and EDE I wish there was perception perks to increase enemy compass tickmark ranges and to highlight enemies while using scopes since my Pearly Peepers suck and recon scopes only work while that weapon is equipped, same with the Pearly Peepers and their x0 magnification...
---
Forget the shit that happened, probably not. 
---
It didnt upset me in the first place, its a game.  I got my 1000 hours worth out of it.  The only other games that come close to that kind of playtime are MMORPGs (EQ, WoW, Rift, AO, UO).
---
Its a Bethesda game, its going to have bugs.
---
Its not unplayable.  Some things dont work as intended sometimes, but I dont care, I still like the game.
---
Bought mine for 15k on the market subreddit
---
No, but any mic works fine.
---
Always a shovel in a whitesprings flower pot at the Whitesprings train station. Another one in the small utility looking building near the miner monument in the South of the golf course area near the sleepy bear cave.
---
Yeah, I know the map problems. Game freezes every the time I try to use it.
---
Yup, they fixed that too, that was more recent though. 
---
If you happen to have an old Explosive Gat Plas,  then you are set for endgame.  Those things are super high in demand now, so keep it if you have one.  Then make everyone jealous by using it.
---
Then you're just a bold faced liar.
---
I too played at launch and huge swathes of bugs have been fixed
---
Im not either, id check it here and there, the hekk off and do other things. That night though i had specifically set out to do it. Because i was tired of seeing it in my quest window. So my 50 or 60 comes from trying it once when i logged on most days for about a month and then the 30 or so times i tried the night i got fed up. (Yes, i knew i could turn them off, i just left it up there because it was story).
---
Gatling Plasmas are fine, except for the spinning which is bugged and it stops if you ADS during the animation.
---
Stability? This is just the worst game I've ever played when it comes to stability. These past couple of weeks people are reporting freezes happening for pretty much every menu opened (map, Pip-Boy, vendors, stash...); the game doesn't crash as much as it used to, but it still does much more often than other games, and the lag is a constant issue. 
---
It's like playing a pre-alpha of an indie game.
---
You're more than free to correct me with some hard facts on what have their CM's doing, day in, day out. Until then, I can tell you what they aren't doing. And that's interacting with the community, in any meaningful way. 
---
You never answered my question either. Why are you here, yelling at people who have legit problems with a company you don't work for (presumably).
---
This is how real it gets in the trenches of modern gaming. Every day it's a little more Flanders Fields up in here.
---
Lol man i wish. The only explosive energy I've ever been able to get my hands on before i stopped playing was a laser rifle.
---
Death Tambo.
---
I go for the 2 near the safe on Deathclaw island, because a lvl 21 deathclaw = easy DC meat.
---
And people dont go there, so I dont have to worry about someone looting it for the wood and steel before I get there.   Whitesprings is a high traffic area and the shovel is likely to be gone.
---
I would love that to if i had anybodys to loot seeing as the despawn as fast as I kill them.
---
15? I got like a 100 lol but this is a good idea. Once u get all the perks they useless anyway.
---
Message the support. I just needed to provide the screenshot of the already completed ones and they refunded them. Also, try not to start Nuclear winter before the dailies are completed ;)
---
This health regen bug severely affects me and my executioners double barrel shotgun, since patch 12 or 13 I believe. I’ve tried a couple different builds to get away from it but nothing is ever as fun as that shotgun. The most game breaking thing I’ve ever encountered so far. :(
---
Agree. Lately there are no more alien / mothman or behemoth + hound pictures, and stupid pictures challenges (take a pic in nuke zone while naked). I'm glad those daily challenges are gone.
---
Good for him. I just wish E. Mack wasn't a gigantic jerk though. Extremely toxic bordering on genuine harassment. I have first hand experience as Mack essentially flames me every single game i am in. It seems Macks go to insults are " kid,  trash, and irrelevant"  usually all three arranged in some fashion.  
---
All because i messaged them a single Heart emoticon after i got what i thought was a hilarious melee kill on him by hiding myself inside a Grafton monster corpse. He didn't find it so funny. He responded with a unhinged barrage of insults and kept it up for awhile until recently.  I kill Mack and his gaggle of buddies? Mack says nothing. Mack kills me.  "Lmao you're trash kid i recorded that"
---
Mack would never admit it but I actually have a kill up on him right now in our little feud. He would probably claim it doesn't count because it was with a pulse grenade which he considers no skill. I know because he's already done precisely that in the past. 
---
A few things about E. Mack.  They are a meta slave (commando, constant froglegs spam, team of four high level buddies never leaving each others side). Which i cannot shame him for because, objectively you are hurting your own chances by not, and after some prodding and banter he did at least acknowledged it with "at least im not a spamming noob tuber".   Which is true. Mack isn't. Props for that. 
---
Overall Congrats on level 300 Mack and if you read this i genuinely do enjoy our little feud as you are one of the few players on Xbox NW that doesn't panic when I get into melee range. ( I'm the Grognak Melee guy, if you pair up with me drop me some fury I'm an addict.)
---
Yup. Jumped from the top of monorail with all the cement and lead. Sounds horrible when you land, but you're fine. Recovery time simulates recovering from a high jump /fall in PA.
---
I tea bagged him till me legs fell of.
---
So basically you create broad judgements of large, complex systems based on anecdotes alone, to the degree that you would use the word 'fact' when talking about the unconfirmed experiences of other people you don't know on the internet. 
---
You do realize that a game this large (even one that's struggled as 76 has) is going to have many complaints daily, right? And that the complaints that are fixed aren't going to be followed by reddit posts, right? Meaning you have no reasonable exposure to the actual data behind how many problems occur, let alone how many are failed by their CS? You get that, right?
---
It's unfortunate that you were burned by support but you've gone down a dark path if you think every complaint made against Bethesda's CS is accurate by virtue of agreeing with your personal experiences. It's not a form of reasoning I would apply to anything important in life.

---
Coming back after a few months, thanks for the info!
---
Yeah I agree with OP and disagree with you. A lot of the other perks come in a set of 3. Why cant unarmed come in a set of 3 as well as the other ones? Like they literally disregarded unarmed perks.  You're trying to substitute not having the extra perk cards by saying you can mix other perks with it, it doing more base damage than slow weapons, and by boosting it with mutations is kind of you just coming up with excuses. Most of the other perks come in a set of three, you can add extra perks to it even with them all maxed out, and you can boost them with mutations. Like everything you said you can do with a full set of 3 perk cards as well 😑
---
Can you share your build?
---
You seem to be blatantly ignoring the fact that I've had community managers agree with me that there is a problem with the customer support right now. It's like you are tailoring what I'm saying to suit your own ideals about what's going on.
---
Also depends on where you are. US tends to be shit in that aspect and rarely sides with the customer. Only places where I've heard of ToS agreements being thrown out is EU and Aus.

Roger!
---
I use that too. Amazing to see all the piles after a SBQ event.
---
So, you can easily solo the raid and kill the queen alone?
---
Take his, they are better than sentry bot cores =)
---
Sadly for you, calling me a liar doesn't change the facts.
---
Yeah, I'm currently level 5, so sentry bots would be...challenging.
---
I took photos of all of them for you.

---
Doesn't work for me, but maybe it'll work for you.
---
I agree that I enjoyed the game. But it is seriously buggy.
---
1. Scorchbeast queen fight. I get DC when we are about to reap the reward. Not once, several time
---
2. Sliding ghouls... seriously?
---
3. Mobs you simply cant kill
---
4. Killed mobs get teleported away from kill spot
---
5. Random crashes.
---
6. So many more bugs in the list...
---
I have the same problem with a Gov Aid drop too. That flare sound gets annoying
---
You should scrip it.
---
i have that.  its called a broken r2 button
---
Thank you so much!
---
I'm trying to plan a cosplay and I needed this to try to figure out which way to go. 
---
Again thank you!
---
He's betting your experience on the subject, against his/her nothing. A bold strategy. Let's see how this pans out.
---
New wall options would be nice
---
Yea, but that doesn't mean they have to track your issue.
---
Throw me an add: Mutinyofthemind  I'll see if I have some other stuff you could use at level 5 as well.
---
I'm ignoring that fact because it's not relevant to the point. Just because there are problems with CS right now doesn't mean every single story about poor CS is automatically true. There are problems with my local post service all the time, does that mean every person claiming a lost package is a saint speaking gospel? Of course not, that would be idiocy.
---
Why is this so hard for you to process? You can choose to believe that dude's story due to your own circumstances and CS problems, but that IN NO WAY makes his story a fact. You can't just write that he's telling the truth because you personally really believe it! If you can't accept that then there's nothing more to say because your brain may well never understand the essential principles I'm laying out.
---
Kill 5 in one match, best bet is a nuke or being awesome.
---
I had an issue where a game wouldn't work and I mentioned I was on a public PC so I couldn't do much.
---
Their advice was to do a bunch of things I'd already said I wasn't able to do, and wished me a happy weekend.
---
The cherry on top was that I got the message on Monday. Probably the time difference but it was 1 in the morning on Monday. I'd lost my whole weekend.
---
That sounds like all information someone could get from compromising your e-mail account, which is notoriously common for hotmail/gmail accounts.

Username checks out.

What consumer protection law is blizzards Eula breaking? And again even if you can find one, you have to go to arbitration vs suing them in small claims, good luck with that.
---
10 bruh
---
the reason. i love fallout. just when i think theres nothing else to do...BOOM! theres something that comes up and im like hell yea! 
---
im an avid salesman. always sell stuff cheap. im always needing more mats or fusion cores or ammo. not always but sometimes looking for legendaries and sometimes getting a god roll 3 star. still looking for a couple. never use them 😂😂 except when i feel like going hunting i use my instigating fire rate crossbow. then of course the events that come along every now and then. and of course gotta restock the shelves. and im always adding stuff to my camp. editing where things are, making room for other stuff.
---
Games with ten times the player base, manage to answer tickets the same day. If Bethesda doesn't have the manpower, it's only because they refuse to pay for it. And they certainly can. I can log a ticket in Final Fantasy XIV right now, and get a response from a GM in game, in less than 30 minutes. I've done it.  
---
You have no experience, and no idea what you're talking about, yet you continue to use that possible ignorance as your only counter argument. At this point, the CEO of Zenimax can show up and admit they are making people delete tickets and you'd still probably call their expertise into question.
---
_internet hate machine_
---
you mean people who bought this game that was originally 60 dollars?
---
Stop fucking playing this trash game. Bethesda doesn't care about its customers
---
Get fucked.
---
It's been awhile since I completed the story, but I'm pretty sure launching a nuke is the last of the story missions
---
OMG! This! Please! It drives me crazy!
---
Why the fuck would they leave out the 5?!?! Jesus christ
---
I don't find it full,I'm planning on becoming a farmer when I retire and looking after my property that I'm slowly expanding in-game gives me a small sense of achievement,much more than I ever got form killing scorchbeasts or memebers of the mirelurk monarchy.
---
Especially since unbeknownst to me when setting up camp here there's a super mutant camp right across from me so it's a steady stream of scrap to repair my homestead
---
Why are you commenting to something from 23 days ago?
---
Dude are you okay?
---
They've already forgotten, with Fallout 1st. Or rather, enough of them have to send the message that we *are* to be trifled with. They gave this rotten company $100 for things that they were promised for free. "Only cosmetics. There's that line we won't cross." Then it became "It's only convenience"... now it's pay to win and the response is just "quit the game then". Same with every damn video game that's done this, ever.
---
Someone probably accidentally logged into your account and took it
---
&gt; I like it when salty people who are seeking to reinforce their bias   
---
This is literally what you're doing.
---
Thanks so much!  I will, as soon as I remember how any of the social stuff works &lt;cough, cough&gt;
---
Variable not defined probably
---
Nuke is very last mission. I’m level 155 and haven’t done it yet. Take your time. Explore and enjoy the game.
---
If you do it like that it'll take a bit ,but you can actually get to the enclave within 5 hours of gameplay
---
You could skip ahead in the story and launch a nuke pretty early. I wont spoil anything here but you may want to wait til level 40 or so.
---
I specifically avoid using Frog Legs because it makes me an easy target. Do I have Frog Legs? Yep. Almost every player does.
---
thanks!
---
Can i please ask for the 10mm pistol to be buffed to either a blue crate or yellow crate?  It's a great [weapon](https://streamable.com/k4er1) and an insult to a classic fallout pistol to be picked out of literal trash cans.
---
Not to mention the whole pistol category is heavy in energy damage which is objectively less reliable than ballistic damage. Having a automatic 10mm pistol in the medium crate would even out pistols damage types and be a good fall back if you unfortunately mutate Grounded. 
---
As far as the Gauss rifle goes i think it's fine honestly. It's miles better than the garbage that is the standard level action. The Gauss is a two shot kill weapon by nature and if you work with that it excels.  At a average mid range a full charged body shot followed by a quick uncharged shot will kill anyone not stacking health or is grounded.  At medium range a charged headshot has a really strong chance of oneshotting someone not stacking health or high on battle drugs, or grounded.  You can also just walk around with a charge ready to go, and sheathe it if you want uncharge it. 
---
Using this strategy with the right perks, and being able to hit those two shots the Gauss rifle has an amazing TTK on unexpecting targets. So quick in fact they won't even have enough time to react with a frogleg panic jump.
---
thanks! me and my friends are taking plenty of time to explore and get destroyed by was over leveled monsters
---
You can start the quest anytime, but I found it more fun the first time naturally instead of chasing it. Might struggle with some sections of the quest at a lower level.
---
thanks! good to know
---
wow that’s not much at all, i’m gonna take my time
---
thank! i’ll keep this in mind
---
"One of support reached out..."
---
AKA Bethesda didn't give a shit about you until 1,700+ people on Reddit did first.
---
This has been asked multiple times, not happening. They have to pay for licences to put ANY new music into their game. And the cost of music licences varies wildly...but most well known songs (including Christmas music) are...expensive.
---
Ah my bad there of you don't use it.
---
Ctrl+Tab to bring up the social menu then throw my bnet name down in "click to add friend"
---
Well when one of the dailies is always "level up while" and one of the weeklies is always something related to Vault 94...and then sometimes they have stuff like "complete quests in a group"...kinda hard for certain players to get those atoms.
---
Yeah 76s campaign is horse shit
---
Same here
---
Its not their fault, talk to systems manager if you need it fixed
---
I run bloodied unyielding stealth sniper. I can one shot just about any mobs and most deathclaws. I have a back up bloodied gatling just in case.
---
This game has destroyed my friendship. My friend says eat the rich and i call him a peasant, you can assume where our POV’s are
---
Down the slope from Top of the World. The slope to the left that has all the mines at the top.
---
Awesome I'll go check it out
---
Some bugs are still around but the beta ended ages ago.
---
Judging by your edge lord twist I'd suggest not coming back
---
Are you sure the beta ended or did we buy a beta version
---
Im already unsubscribed. Im not going to give them anything. Just going to grind and do my own things.
---
I can help you.  
---
IGN: Pryce\_Permafrost
---
It sure feels like it.
---
What difference does it make?
---
The house across the street from Welch train station often spawns one
---
I'm sure. What makes you unsure?
---
It spawns in the medical skeleton factory in the mire. I get a sheep atleast 3 out of 5 times, others being anglers and giant sloths.
---
Doing the retake event instead of the publically advertised Defend event is important
---
This would be incredibly helpful in the Mire. Idk how many non-glowing enemies I've lost in that tall, dark grass
---
My man

its now in master beta stage.  plays on its own, but during group events it dont work.

Min/Max, Bloodied, or Junkies.
---
I used my shovel today. :) Maybe someday there will be a challenge that requires you to kill with a board. Cuz I got a BSS+1S Board waiting.
---
If you can tell based off of that...seems like I got my answer
---
Nothing is "fun" the whole game aka bug simulator is a pure employment therapy..
---
Not at all, when the "private servers are not really private" hate train was rolling it was way more about the recycled servers than anything else.
---
The ROBLOX support are better then bethesda support
---
Finally got one at the medical supply place in the more. Right after I got one free ranger poped up lol
---
Trees in the Ash Heap.
---
Three can be found on trees near Hornwright testing site 3.
---
Two can be found over the ridge due west of Hornwright air purifier site #03 (towards Welch).
---
At Welch.
---
On a tree near a house next to Vault 63.
---
Many can be found on trees east of the AMS testing site, around the mountain icon.
---
Ash heap. They are bright yellow-brown mushrooms and tend to be found on trees, stumps, or fallen logs.
---
Thank you
---
Think i jumped from like 72 to 85
---
No, they mean the internet hate machine. It was, and in some cases still is popular to hate on 76. This game has it's issues and it isn't the next Fallout game that most of us wanted, but it was nowhere near as bad as a lot of YouTube channels and websites made it out to be.
---
While it is not as good of a game as FO 3 or 4, it is still a game that was well worth the $60 that I paid for it.
---
Personally I want a game that is basically Fallout 4 with coop, just let me bring a friend along instead of an NPC companion. While 76 might not be that, it is still a fun way to mess around in a Fallout world with a friend or 2.
---
ps4? i cant find a subreddit besides one small one
---
100% and would be used by most of the community. I haven’t played fo4 in a long while but I swear the highlight perk did this. I was surprised going into fo76 how blind I was to dead bodies after being able to find them easily in fo4.
---
been trying all over to find someone selling one for a non outrageous price lol
---
Please make it a separate station so I don’t have to hear it
---
upvote just for your username 😂😂
---
Do you play the game?  What is pay 2 win?  I'm confused
---
Yeah, it's good when the game breaks in funny ways like the older fallouts when bodies would just be spinning around all the time
---
Haha! Nice one!
---
I seen them from time to time at silo alpha
---
You look awfully familiar traveller!
---
Try outer worlds it's a better game anyways
---
What does it matter? 
---
If you're still playing after a year, you got your money's worth.
---
No problem, just shout his name and he'll be there!
---
Well, other than the Mothman that is!
---
He is all around us, watching over our Appalachia!
---
Yeah if you explore the mire you might be able to get on your way to launching a nuke fast. But yes you might want to level up a bit.
---
Lol, like powdered toast man...

They might get a special prize if enough karma is earned. No but for real not sure why anyone would want to "farm" karma since it doesn't prove anything. If they want karma posting random dog pictures would be a better bet than trying to stir up the fallout76 sub

Indeed, and happy cake day

And definitely the one we need

It can rarely spawn on the road next to the Berkeley Springs Train Station (aka where Mama Murgh-y is). I once fought a Legendary Sheepquatch here

Food doesn't decay faster anymore, that was a bug for a while but it's gone back to it was before
---
The dragons in Skyrim use to do this to me as well.
---
No *you* make the game rule!
---
Bloodied, things die fast and so do you, presents a fun challenge with a high reward.  You don't have to go to the extreme of playing at 19% HP all the time for it to be powerful and fun.
---
In a game based almost entirely around resource management, to allow the player to remove the management part, is paying to win. There is no strict "winning" in this game. As it never ends. But everything becomes easier, as it was designed around limiting resources. You're literally paying to remove those limitations. Which can make fighting mobs and bosses, exponentially easier.

I have 170. All I want, is for all 7 of my cards to be animated.
---
I don't know why we can't just buy the gold versions of the cards.
---
Okay but if that was the case why don't the video titles reflect that? 
---
Your entire starting argument was "go search youtube for fo76 private servers arent really private titled videos" that has nothing to do with recycled servers. 
---
Unless that was someone else commenting your entire initial issue according to your words was all these youtubers were making videos about how private servers werent private and this was a lie etc etc. 
---
However I think at this point it's been largely proven that that was not at all a lie, that the private servers were not private. 
---
So, your initial argument that youtubers were lying about the servers not being private has been killed here so that's now closed. 
---
If you'd like to now try and claim that a bunch of youtubers made videos like "FO76 private servers are recycled" or something and try to argue that anyone saying any of that was lying that's fine. However I'll preface that by stating that I fully believe the private servers were recycled instances at least at that point in time and there was widespread reporting on it from more than just youtubers. 
---
So finally, once more, exactly what did just youtubers lie about? Please provide an argument with actual substance.
---
Junkies builds unite
---
The worms are called Bloodworms
---
And if they add Cazadores I'm uninstalling the game. Just noping the hell outta here. Roboscorpions would be pretty cool though. Hell, add more robot variations of existing enemies. Like a Robo-Guai or a Robo-Claw. 
---
And Centaurs are coming back with Wastelanders
---
The Quantum Say-What-Now?
---
Chameleon armor stacks, and so does harder to detect. Apart from that, your 3 points in Sneak and Escape Artist.
---
Hmmm, idk about scorched earth but I’m also curious. On a similar note for the encrypted I had a fixer, one piece of harder to detect gear, one chameleon gear, two bolstering and two unyielding gear. Rads to about half health. It was a junkies fixer. I sat on the satellite dish on top of the cabin and was stealthed the whole fight from the sheepsquatch itself at least. There were two other people taking the pylons and I blasted it very quickly
---
Takes me about a hr to do the weeklies sometimes and like 30 mins depending on the dailys. They made it easier besides the vault raid daliys
---
What the fuck! I did not enjoy grinding that shit game mode for three days to get that shit. Now everyone gets an extension BULLSHIT 😠
---
Do you have any tips on how to get yellow and forest I have fallout 1st
---
Played until level 250 since beta and stopped right after the scout faction thing came out. Personally it was hell. I liked the game at first and stuck with it thinking it had so much potential. 76 actually is the most buggy game I have ever played (for me it was as bad as youtubers said it was) but I set that aside for a short while. Mess-up after mess-up though, I reached a point where I completely lost faith in Beth. My main complaint was that the content they were putting out was just mediocre and they were way too slow. My friend and I reached a point around December where we could "solo" the queen in like 2 minutes. The game was very easy and we had nothing to experience but bugs that hindered our gameplay (empath bug, damage bug on flying enemies, not getting legendaries from 3\* enemies etc.). 
---
At level 50 I was pretty content as well. I was excited for all the min-maxing I can do and all the badass weapons I could get. I wanted to discover mysterious locations that rewarded me for my curiosity and hoped that the game's story would go to the next level. But then you get to the end-game and you realize how shallow, empty and pointless this whole game is. If this game had a satisfying ending (or end-game) that made me feel like I didn't waste my time (by providing a proper conclusion to the main quest or providing a compelling end-game loop), then I would say it's a good game. But given how utterly pointless all my efforts were (and given that I payed 60$ for a game that soon dropped to 40), I absolutely hate it. 
---
I'm genuinely surprised you find 76 to be a better game than 4. Replaying 4 after 76 felt like I was playing Fallout 5. The smoothness of the gameplay and physics alone made it feel as such.
---
But hey, to each his own.
---
Fuck their support team. Those asshole employees need to be fired.
---
I will give you something actually fun to play and not just the standard "bloodied/junkies onry".
---
**Stealth Flamer!**
---
Flamers are marked as *normal* in the games' sound index. This means you can chain multiple sneak attacks in a row. I sneak around with Covert Operative and Concentrated Fire for headshots. I'm doing around 5x my damage at that point. I currently use a stalkers faster fire rate flamer. It's putting out around 11.4 sneak attack head shots per second at 100% Vats accuracy when undetected. It is pretty fun and very satisfying melting enemy faces. 
---
Ammo can be a huge problem, but if you manage to maintain stealth, the multiplied damage makes you use less ammo and lasts longer. You will need something loud and powerful to switch to when stealth fails. You really don't want to be using a Flamer on full blast.
---
They were gonna be a thing but got cut for whatever reason.
---
Or people like me that have a 7X7 work schedule who only got 1 day to *almost* grind it out?
---
They better fuckin not redeem themselves, its taken me a whole year to get this angry, raww
---
Over a longer period of time 😠. That last day was a nightmare i had to grind that shIt ALL DAMN DAY. yea they still have to grind but it's at their leisure. Not all at once
---
It was only a matter of time before they'd want to stop giving you something that you could be paying for.
---
Pharma farms first.
---
Then my run.
---
1. Morgantown airport
---
2. AMS Medical
---
3. Westtek.
---
Pretty much gets you a ton.
---
But honestly, its easier to use super duper, chemist and make your own stimpaks.
---
That a lot of those bugs are still there over a year later is not acceptable.
---
Point is, if we forget what Bethesda has done, they will do it again. Either in a future game, or within the future of this game. Common sense dude.
---
I went from 124 to 126. Did not play as much as I wanted to, most of the XP came from doing a SBQ event, I'm guessing most folks were doing their own things on private servers cause not much happened on the public ones, at least from what I seen. A couple of my friends leveled up good. One went from 98 to 109. The other 45 to 52
---
Here's an old video showing how to extract and replace sounds from Fallout 4. The steps are pretty much the same for Fallout 76, but the steps at 1:42 to 3:38 are unnecessary: [https://youtu.be/ovZD5xRZC5A](https://youtu.be/ovZD5xRZC5A)
---
Since you simply want to extract sound files from the game (and convert them to a playable format), you can stop watching the video at 6:27.
---
Also, since Fallout 76 is currently not a Steam game, it has a slightly different path to get to the files: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Bethesda.net Launcher\\games\\Fallout76\\Data
---
Hope this helps!
---
You can lie to yourself if you wish, but don't try to scam others.
---
Yea he did have ticket numbers, and that's part of the reason I'm not calling him a liar and saying it's all BS. But that doesn't mean I'm just going to go OK and eat up everything he wrote. For all I know the problem was user error on his end... god knows I've blamed others for errors I've made before. 
---
There's a position between biased contempt for a company and cynical disdain for internet posters. That's where you'll find me. I didn't just buy into 900 hours guy's story either, and I've seen enough information about the recent ban situation to think that there could be error on both sides.
---
Not for me , lately been racking them up faster then ever.
---
800 in the last two weeks and I am a casual.
---
Re-entering the area sometimes fixes that, works for me on Burrows.
---
i love how i can still semi-auto with my full auto. takes some practice but totally worth it.
---
People have already forgotten now. If you've spent more than a few bucks on the Atomic Shop, you've already forgotten.
---
If you bought more than a month of 1st, you've already forgotten.
---
If you honestly think that this is a completed game. That this is the best Bethesda could do. That they didn't charge us full price for a beta, you've already forgotten.
---
Some people of course will forget. They'll think that all is forgiven if Wastelanders is a huge hit (big if). I for one will never forget what Bethesda has done. Credit where credit is due, if Wastelanders is a hit, kudos Bethesda. But that doesn't automatically absolve you of what you've done.
---
Went from 124 to 126. Nothing fancy, didn't play as much as I wanted (married with kids type of life), most of the XP came from a SBQ event
---
I’ve seen pictures of him before. Honestly, I’ve only seen out once outside of Meat Week.
---
Game detrimental bugs still being in-game a year later is not acceptable. Unbelievably lazy and incompetent developers.
---
the ban situation started up as probably an error on both sides but when they decided to double down and ban all the accounts of the map76 guy at the same exact time it became a targeted effort. these accounts all used the same prefix for the email address and some of them hadnt even been logged into in months. an account that he used for testing stuff that was on a seperate email address entirely was left untouched. customer service when from general inaction to blatantly targeting someone who has been helping with finding, testing, and reporting bugs and exploits as well as creating a great tool that the community was able to use.
---
Always on my day when when I have time to game.
---
No
---
I've seen him a few times with the Legendary title.
---
Go to Slocums Joe. Gather Firecaps. Go to overseer camp. Run south along the river gathering blood leaf and snaptail. Use chemist and super duper to make forest disease cures then turn those disease cures into antibiotics. Antibiotics give you 50% disease resist for like 2 hours and cure a disease.
---
I will do my best to be on before the maintenance starts after I take my daughter to school.
---
&gt;virtually nothing has been fixed.
---
You shouldn't say things you don't understand the meaning of
---
That wasn't the question. Read next time.
---
As I understand it from the map guy's own words, he was researching an exploit, found it and used it, then went to sleep and didn't report it the next day because he thought it was taken care of. I believe he said he even went back to searching for more exploits. It seems like he was just trying to help and I don't think ill of him but I'm also not surprised that he was flagged; all things considered that's what most CS would do. That's why it seems like fault on both sides to me.
---
At this point I'm at a 'wait and see' with his case. If the dude has evidence to support his case then I hope Bethesda apologizes to him and everyone who was unfairly banned. I certainly don't think Bethesda can do no wrong and accountability is a good thing.
---
How much of a build build is junkies?
---
Don't you just avoid perks no one uses and get a weapon?
---
I've run vaccinated and along with being well fed pretty much never get diseased by creatures.
---
People don't seem to be aware chems like RadAway lower your disease resistance for awhile.

They are exactly the same speed tho
---
Top 10 worst pickup lines :)
---
A mic is convenient and all but a world/whisper chat would do this game wonders.
---
If you pay 100 bucks to Todd then yes.
---
Medium is a range. Deathclaw gauntlet is somewhere around 1.2 a second and I'm pretty sure powerfist is almost 1 a second even.
---
Someone had a great bloodied combat knife w/40% faster swing speed which sounded OP.
---
Hige swaths of bugs, like what?
---
They are both 0.88 hits per second
---
Someone said they could help me tonight, thank you for offering to help me as well.
---
No problem ! :D
---
You got it when you bought the bundle that has the metal camper in it!
---
You forgot the 90 weight reduction, that is what people want.
---
Cool, thanks.  I'm just not used to it then.
---
There were a *tonne* of people playing during the Halloween week unlock period. I played matches with 52 players for the first time in months.
---
It really is an insanely friendly fan base.
---
Except for the people who aren't, of course.
---
I never bought that, it was a black square in my build menu and I built it to see what it was, weird
---
Holy crap...
---
I sure am buddy boy
---
Lol k got you then
---
Si senor
---
Don’t forget you can also eat a deathclaw steak for +str and it stacks with Yao and glowing
---
No no, that's the legendary variant of it. The Rescue InComing Flare gun.
---
Could take a farm workshop and take it to the next level. Just stay sneaking build as fast as you can and either fail to defend it, or if got a friend in same server log off and back in, will no longer own it but can still harvest things and repair stuff
---
Raider PA starts at L15, T-45 and excavator start at L25.  I believe those others are much higher level for now.  Ask a nice person for help with Calibrated legs and Targeting helmet mods.  Enjoy!
---
THOSE EXIST????!!!
---
Yea like 2 farms I think maybe 3 not sure
---
What do they give me? Faster grow times? Automation? Bigger harvest numbers?
---
The raid yes, and the queen needs a few people to kill her. She still cant kill you though lol. You can stand there alone and stay alive. Try doing the queen 1 thousand times though. It gets old
---
Thanks and happy cake day!
---
One is in the forest along the ohio river down under the food plant, other is kinda near the savage divide - mire border
---
It’s simply fun, once my friends and I made the switch to bloodied sneak melee we simply just love destroying her as quickly as we can. We went from having to evaluate a server to see if there were enough other high level players to help us down her, to now not even caring if people show up.  When you launch nukes it’s for us, not the rest of the players. Not sorry if you get there late and don’t get loot, launch a nuke for yourself...
---
Gotten a little better...i think this game has the most fanboys i have ever seen though.
---
Huh, I have a spreadsheet back home with a bunch of this stuff on it, but I guess the info must be off. I think I got a lot of it from fallout 4 so that may be why
---
Bigger budget and like literal fields to plant in, with some pre existing crops, and resource extractors
---
I have a farming character as well, not as my main. I've placed myself as the caretaker to nearby farms. I would only farm for caps and nothing else matters.
---
O nice free stuff again
---
Yeah and watch that mad sneak damage on the queen from inside V9?
---
Found a legendary lvl 80
---
One in the groove after finishing the SBQ. It was in an epic battle with a bunch of super
---
Mutants. Just swept in and finished that challenge real quick. Totally lucky. Usually I find them south of the Crevasse Dam
---
I started it for the caps but fell in love with developing my farm.A generator here,a fully equipped platform to survey my crops there. 
---
I'll admit it got addictive pretty quick and now I'm just trying to figure out how Tesla arcs work so I can bring my defenses to the next level. I've always loved the idea of a homestead. Something that's yours and that you protect/maintain to the best if your ability no matter what bug mother hubbard comes knockin at your door
---
 I even found myself getting mad the second i heard my turrets fire off cause I knew that the insolent mutants we're back for round 18
---
Yes, I will play fallout 76 when NPCs are added ?
---
1. Fix the artillery
---
2. Fix the pet acquisition
---
3. Fix the event clock that only has 1 One Violent Night for every 10 Project Paradises, Tea Times, and jail breaks
---
4. Fix the enemy regeneration when using some weapons
---
5. PUT DECENT REWARDS ON THE EVENTS!
---
That's just the result of Todd wanting more lighting. They shoved lights that come out of the ground to please him.
---
My farms just below the rusty pick and just above the ash heap overlooking a medical center I believe,not sure how close it would be to my camp but sounds werf.
---
All I can hope for now is tamable brahmin and some sort of cattle herding system. Hell I'd love to even be able to ride a brahmin even if it's slower than walking while out of AP
---
The fertilizer producer camp thing is a Brahman.
---
Nope. Wendigo camp counselor Mia is still possible.
---
I’m on XB1 and I have a full set of strangler that I use alongside my AAE gat plasma. Anytime I use that gun while in the strangler and I fire more than 30rounds off it get tremendous lag for not only me but my two other buddies while we are on a private server. It’s awful they yell al me to stop, especially during the queen fights. I lagged a few people out of the game the other day during project paradise when the 3star arrives. Only know because I got messages from two guys that I caused their game to crash.
---
Is that a workshop thing or have I been able to get a brahmin this entire time?
---
The more you play the less you'll see coming in. Like a standard paywall game.
---
Except this is attributed to lifetime atoms. In the beginning you'll earn those and they are extras. Now, in the later levels, all you can rely on for atom income are the dailies and weeklies
---
Can you even get sneak crits if the Queen(or any other mob really) is engaged with another non-sneaking player? 
---
I was under the impression that you would see sneak crits notifications on your screen but they would behave like normal attacks server side since the enemy was already aware of the presence of another player.
---
Bethesda: *closes ticket*
---
Hacked player: "what if I purchase Fallout 1st?"
---
Bethesda: *working to resolve this problem*
---
I’m huntin bugs, I’m huntin bugs, out here in Appalachia, there are spiders, ants, and slugs.
---
Do you have the vaccinated perk? Are you using radx and diluted radx? Both of those decrease your diseases resistance. To combat that, try that perk mentioned earlier or instead of using disease cures, try anti-biotics. It'll cure and boost your disease resistance.
---
If you're also near white springs, just drink from their water fountain instead
---
50% of the daily/weekly activities were moved to Nuclear Wasteland
---
RNG is weird.  Last 2 times I did it we killed Mia.
---
Bethesda support is in Kablukablukastan
---
The tasks required to earn free atoms are designed to make buying atoms for $$ a preferred option.
---
They literally PUNISH us for not buying atoms, and having the audacity to attempt earning them.
---
It wouldn't be the first promise broken.
---
Sometimes people use /l for local chat. There are clan capabilities, but I don't know if anyone uses them or not. It is surprising that despite the connection with all PC players across all servers the number of regular users is low.
---
Not sure how I feel about centaurs coming back but I guess it could make sense if done right.  I’m not strict on the lore of monsters except the master pretty much, as he was so unique and was the story.
---
The Shielded BoS plan sometimes drops from turning in technical data (Forbidden Knowledge quest).  You'll need to play through the BoS questline until you're able to get that repeatable quest if you haven't already.
---
Just Fallout things.
---
The mods wont allow it. They'll call it self promotion and block his post
---
The strange brew tea counts towards alcohol. Have you drank that?
---
Just got another subscription. Can't wait to see your videos
---
Are you thinking of the russian tank helmets?
---
Must’ve dropped my weight in technical data into that slot. Sigh. Guess I’ll keep slogging away. Lol. Thanks! :)
---
Does this graph help? [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
Its under resources in camp build IIRC looks like a wheelbarrow and it will spawn a Brahman, can be killed requires razorgrain to repair it
---
I hope you have your farm close to an in game farm like the responders airport farm or the moonshiners farm in the northwest.  There is also a good grain farm in the forest but I've only ever stumbled across it once.
---
It's right below the rusty pick on a little hill above the ash heap
---
Hey I figured I'd let you know servers are going down for maintenance tomorrow morning.
---
Is there a plan and if so where the hell can I get it? Cause I need me a brahmin
---
Full sneak rifleman 20 per 15 agi
---
Guns I've been using last 200+ hours
---
AAE Lever
---
Instigating Sniper rifle
---
TSE lever
---
QE lever
---
I+33vats fixer
---
Before I got the fixer my go to was the TSE. Nothing dropped stuff like the TSE even after the nerf. Then I got the fixer from Murmrgh last week. Now I generally go for the fixer, it absolutely one shots everything.
---
The only response to this criticism
---
The numbers are probably lower than they would be even for a PC mod, partly because the interface is kinda clunky but mostly because it's not actually used for the thing people kept wanting text chat for - as an alternative to voice chat between characters in game.
---
I've used chat for several months during the early days and it was mostly inane chatter or trading. Trading was about the only useful thing on there. Even the local chat was spammy af inane chat.
---
I had to quit. It just wasn't worth shit. Nothing against the modder. Just it wasn't fit for chat between characters.
---
Check out sunshine Meadows industrial farm. It's my favorite for this, being a relatively low level area with. Nice view, and offering plenty of fertilizer too. If you are patient, you can even get a medium water purifier into the puddle by the front.
---
Sweet.
---
Let’s all play the game exactly how you do.
---
Which is apparently hating every second.
---
Yup. I know what you mean. Some higher level then even my main came by and helped me build my camp to a wonderful one. Real farmer feel. I even attack things with my pitchfork lol. I'm stationed at the junk harvesting pile near Aaron homestead. My character takes care of that farm and the Cobbleton farm. I use the junk extractor so I don't ever have to leave for anything except run down west a bit if I really wanted a lot of dirty water fast. 
---
Sitting there, taking care of the homestead and selling excess cooked or crafted food on top of excess harvest. Maintaining the cobbleton farm is becoming a problem from all the excess ghouls and my pitchfork can only do so much.
---
berserkers hazmat suit
---
If you mean do damage during the SE event and never be attacked, I don't think it's possible.
---
Lol piss off. You edited your comment because you got caught saying stupid things.
---
Just said screw it and cancelled my subscription
---
1. My Scrapbox is insanely full and should last for months
---
2. I get to keep the tent
---
3. The private worlds are shit, they don't spawn properly (way too many empty spawn locations) and you can go a whole day without One Violent Night happening. So much for solo events worth doing!
---
4. There is nothing worth buying in the Atom shop with the extra atoms. I'm up 3K and tired of the same old crap.
---
Yes.  I can read. Nw is in beta right now.
---
Do you think the game is in beta and a game mode is beta too?  Is that the mental gymnastics we i have to perform to get on your level?
---
As someone who has worked with GDPR, OP’s case is not how GDPR works. In fact, if their position is that OP can’t prove their identity, what they’re doing is very much in line with GDPR. It is not some magic four-letter combination that opens all doors when invoked.
---
I just realised I got a legendary pitchfork I was gonna transfer as I read this,thank you.Now my farm shall be feared by all lvl 5 super mutants that dare oppose it.
---
Yes. The first time i met legendary grahm was during the BETA days.
---
well I love 76 because it is fun, it has non- stop things to do like kill the queen, get no loot, get mad, join the bos clan have fun roleplaying with them for months. the point is that the game can be bad with its glitches but they are totable. I have over 400+ hours on 76 and I plan to get it to 1000. so the game is fun, glitches are bad, community is strong, the lore is amazing and the enemies and graphics are very beautiful. I love fallout 76.
---
Tbh strangler is easy to deff
---
I must be doing something wrong to get punished like this.
---
Ever since Campfire tales shipped, Ive only gotten the wendigo ending 4 times and all 4 where when there was tons of players there.
---
This is my que to leave the event from this point going forward.
---
You have gotten lucky.
---
well the outer worlds is a confusing game ( mainly with the slow time thing) and its just so boring, like the dialogue and the enemies and looting aspect.
---
It wasn't their fault, just bugged me a little, and the weekend thing was just a funny sprinkle of salt on the wound.
---
Whatever the issue was, it was fixed in an update a day or two later so it wasn't a big deal, just annoying that the advice given was something I'd already said I wouldn't be able to do.
---
When I looked up the error code it had said it was a payment error, so the account wasn't validated.
---
can agree 76 is a great game and grinding out the game and be addictive and fun to do. although 76 has problems with lag and crashing but that is something I can not really get mad at. also Jet
---
Grudges come and go, but lessons always stay in place. I think you're worried we will be fooled again. Don't think too low about us.
---
It's good that you are angry. Now grind again.
---
Once a looong time ago lolol
---
Want me to spoon feed you 15 updates worth of bugs?
---
I did it earlier today and it ended fine.
---
I would say the opposite. It doesn't feel like it aside from a few things..
---
After I uninstalled the game, my sneak skill was so complete that I haven't been detected in ages...
---
Only way anyone knows I'm there is when I whisper in their ear.
---
Yup. So are people who stopped playing.
---
No. You don't need to. Because I've read every patch note. Each time something was claimed to be fixed, it was not ir got reintroduced later (remember the infamous patch 10?) Each patch introduced more and more bugs, and a fraction of them gets fixed in a later patch. For every bug they have apparently fixed, they have introduced a dozen more. How times have they claimed to have "fixed" the sentry bit looping noise? You don't need to spoon feed me anything, you've been spoonfed a lot of Bethesda's cool aid already.
---
Uh, I prefer the Big rounds to the single enemy spawn. Most times I don't get a hit on either so I'd at least like to be able to look the bug meat and parts. I got the single wendigo at least 4 times yesterday.
---
Yes , its their email. 
---
I didnt click on any link in the email . I instead went to thire site and went to “help site” under the support section and there was a “Account recovery “ button so i clicked it and filled my info.
---
So yes i am 100% sure.
---
Why on earth are you people still supporting this horrid company,  they clearly do not care about their customers
---
Learn to use 2FA. This is nobodies fault but your own. Any other company would do the same given your lack of real security. Your claim to ownership is nebulous at best but just like the rest of this entitled sub you expect to be treated like you're a king when in fact you're just a moron. GG
---
Just sit by the trees and get ant kills for the meat / red ant lager and oodles of tick blood. So much blood.
---
Well that was hardly gonna be a surprise to any of us 😂
---
?
---
The game is already dead. After the Map 76 controversy, the Fallout 1st controversy, and all the shit, I’m surprised people are STILL playing it and not going full on protest mode.
---
Thats a food processing plant, and OP wants a farm
---
Normally on either late after work, 11pm+ CMT, or mid afternoon, 11am-2pm CMT.  Just respecced perks to be a viable damage dealer.  
---
GT: Lupine Disco
---
Sure. Way to avoid my questions.
---
They kinda have those already.
---
Communism camp stuff pls?
---
So like outer worlds does..
---
lacks quality and competence? is this because of the glitches because I used to lag because I play console with "great internet". I like 76
---
I've gotten three straight wendigo endings
---
It’s not dependent on the internet. I’ve found fallout 76 to be foundationally and systematically “busted” 
---
I’ve never played such a broken piece of software
---
3-5k prolly.
---
Only just seen this post. So sorry to hear your news and hope you are doing ok. And thankyou for informing the community,  our support is unconditional and united we stand beside you. Perhaps as a thought you could honor your fave wep with his name. Both of you travelling through Appalachia,  and still kicking ass.
---
I think it's called literally a Brahmin Pen.  I usually get one after a workshop defend event but I think it's considered an uncommon drop since it counts as a resource extractor.
---
r/FuckBlizzard
---
The options there but the facial hair is not
---
**The FBI would like to know your location.**
---
It's supposed to unlock once you complete race for the precidency but that's not in the game
---
Better beards are needed
---
Not really, still plenty of people here. Also not really much controversy there unless you're spreading it. More than half the people you meet have first. The map 76 thing was a joke. The guy should've read the rules. No cheat engines.
---
&gt; **Does anyone know if fallout is still in Beta?** 
---
Hold on, let me DM 2018 for you to find out.
---
Depends on you. Could be less than a week if you rush it. Maybe a month if you play out everything before then.
---
You lose SPECIAL stats based upon the addictions you choose. Different addictions effect different stats. It doesn’t meant you can’t use all your perks, your end result stats are lower though. For example, I enjoy all the benefits of my 15 strength perk point cards, but in the game, I only have 14 strength as an end result. 
---
Here’s my junkies heavy/explosive build.

---
I don’t lose ordnance express 3, or any other perks because of the -1 Str from an addiction... it just shows I have 14 as an end result... does effect carry weight and melee damage though...
---
October 2019 called. Said you missed your window to post this.
---
I got hit my a liberator and got bone worms...
---
Controversy? Dude admitted to using a dupe glitch *" So I tried a lot of things, and finally figured out a way to trick the purveyor to take caps instead of scrip "* and DID NOT REPORT IT *" It was late, so I went to bed, the next morning...   Someone from my group stated that they already reported it to one of the community managers in our group, so I just left it"*, he assumed because his friends did he would be okay because he had reported glitches before. That was a stupid assumption and according to TOS he shouldn't have been trying to replicate a glitch at all. Does it suck? You bet it does, but hopefully, in whatever next game he plays, and tries to find bugs in, he learned his lesson to ALWAYS REPORT.
---
Think the free states robot in harpers fairy sells it
---
Well, I have a fo76 DISCORD community with 162 members, and though we are not on concurrently we average 8-14 at any given time. Not a huge group mind you, but we run events, hold contests, drop nukes, and help new players. Not sure what you quantify as "only a handful of players" unless you are saying you predict the game to be dead in 2 years? That could be fair depending on how wastelanders does.
---
Yes better facial hair options would be nice.
---
You could have tried more, and come up with something else than a copy pasted reply from another idiot.
---
Tha is 👍
---
It’s not that it is not a good deal because you are already getting your value from the atoms alone. It’s that utility items are locked behind a paywall.
---
You know very well this is Bethesda's PR attempt.
---
NP! Stay classy and hope to see you in the wasteland!
---
Halloween is over, so stop using that tinfoil hat.
---
Bruh imagine if Bethesda created some Face ID software that made your character for you
---
What a grand and intoxicating innocence.
---
You as well! If on PS4 you probably will. If not maybe it will be like a Halogram from a galaxy far far away.
---
Decided to go with a heavy gunner build since I’ve found a Junkie’s .50 cal, AAE .50, and AAFFR .50 last week.
---
RNGesus blessed me with that and more. I don’t plan on getting an decent drops til after wastelanders....
---
Haha sadly a PC user but I appreciate the sentiment!
---
It’s like making a joke to a person that can’t take a hint
---
sadly not
---
we got a big fat big fallout 4 art book but not with Fallout 76 i think the CE game guide has some artwork included with it tho ...
---
Trollllollolol
---
Don’t worry you don’t need to DM 2018, you just need to DM the bugs that haven’t been removed since 2018
---
Gotta applaud your benevolent (or entrepreneurial) approach, but I don't think one person is capable of providing a whole heck of a bunch more space than the one person who is running out of it, holding the same thing in the same space. The most you can hope for is a client for every character, or one for your whole account. That being the case, I'd say the best person's junk to hold would be your own. I hold my own junk all the time. When other people hold it, (don't get me wrong, it's nice) it's just not the same. You lose track of things and might get caught in a pinch.
---
Praise the sun. \\\[T\]/
---
Do you keep the emotes if you buy and then cancel? Also what are the emotes?
---
It absolutely is not. I tried to get a refund back before the sub even existed, and now that I’m eligible for a refund I’d like to get as much as I can back.
---
You mean with 90% reducted weight.
---
You should.
---
Mothman themed dance and robot dance.
---
Nope.
---
They need a hard cap on the particle effect, i dunno, 1 visual stack?!?!.  How fuckin hard is that to change?
---
I bought mine last week for 3k.
---
Understandable lol wish you still had it to trade 😋
---
How?
---
Can we place a camp beyond the border? That would be pretty awesome
---
It’s not bad at all - welcome to Outrage Culture, where outrage about literally anything gets you Internet views.
---
You have to have bandolier with it as well, the ammo is super heavy. Also you can only craft 7 spikes at a time....
---
The more the merrier! © Sweetwater
---
It's worth asking - you are pressing the specific "search" button while looking in the inventory, right? And not just looking at the inventory and taking stuff?
---
You would be surprised how many people don't realise that all those perks require you to press an extra button or nothing happens.
---
It has for me. But I've only been on one a couple times
---
YouTube is your best bet.
---
If you will be truly successful you have a chance of receiving email from Bethesda with exact amount of rare junk you was able to accumulate in just 30 days.
---
I will give up on this idea.
---
Yeah it makes the raid kinda tolerable
---
Seen it, but rare
---
Not to be “that guy” but I am betting this will an atom shop thing.
---
Yeah right. "Ect" too, I nearly have up on the internet.
---
It's a shame Bethesda have become complete money-grubbing scumlords because it's a game that deserves better.
---
I get some lag when there’s a couple players with strangler armor and an explosive heavy gun at SBQ, but nothing too outrageous that lasts for more than a couple seconds.
---
I think the much larger issue is the imbalance of legacy energy weapons.  They’re breaking end game content and PvP entirely.  Sometimes the Queen is dead in under a minute.  Yes, a prime b/e LMG will do insane damage, but a b/e plasma gatling will outperform even that, and you don’t even really need to aim. The explosions seem to still do the full 100% damage and punch through armor like it doesn’t exist.  Maintaining thousands of ultracite 308 is also much more difficult than making a pile of plasma cores.
---
That can’t possibly be working as intended.  It’s rare on PC to attend a public event where someone doesn’t have an explosive plasma gatling or laser rifle now.  They’re obviously being duped and sold wholesale.
---
This is a joke right?
---
If its something you want to role play, have fun. Could be done, but you might run the risk of people claiming you stole their junk. You could keep a ledger of each player and their deposit, but with out a receipt anyone could claim you stole their junk. Linking up would be a pain, and as for bugs, all it takes is one botched update and the junk will be wiped.
---
you can use modes if you are on pc
---
What should I do if I love fo3, love fo4, love Skyrim, and hate fo76? What should I do if I would love to play the next Elder Scrolls, I would love to play Starfield, but I am scared to death of those games being as terrible as Fallout 76 which would essentially mean those games are lost for me since I will not be able to enjoy them just as I am not able to enjoy Fo76?   
---
Should I and everyone like me be allowed to criticize Fallout 76 or do I have to be silent in my opinion about the game and must just sit and wait for the next games to come out without an option to tell my say on how I would prefer them to be?
---
dmg resistance + chameleon 
---
chameleon is good with escape artist perk 
---
but you can do whatever you like
---
That’s okay dude you keep it and sell it on! I’m sure I’ll find one eventually!
---
I would recommend eagle eyes for sure.
---
Speed demon &amp; carnivore - depends on how you play. The food drain can be annoying &amp; might require you to carry more food &amp; then use weight reduction perks. I prefer to spec for damage.
---
In some reason it reminds me of aspects of Vanilla WoW. I can no longer enjoy vanilla/Classic (because the game evolved and I can't downgrade in many features), but this game is my replacement of it...
---
I'd also recommend Adrenal Reaction to stack with the bloodied effect of your weapon
---
Honestly, the only thing that makes FO4's story halfway decent is the alternative starts mod.
---
I like FO76's story significantly more.
---
Thats why I’m a cannibal
---
For sure. Adrenal reaction is a must for bloodieds
---
Yea, can't believe it wasn't mentioned!
---
Siloes are wonderfully free of lag on private server, no waiting around for 30-60 seconds, when repairing pipes or putting in mainframe cores, for the server to "catch up"... There does seem to be more turrets in there as well ...
---
Loading-screens seems shorter too
---
So yes, it does seem like they run smoother
---
It loads up quicker when you arrive but the usual spots are still laggy ie whitespring etc.
---
The game now, decent-good. At release, bad.  
---
Developer/support was terrible, still is horrible.
---
Speed demon &amp; carnivore are fantastic. I personally dropped healing factor as I tend to use psychotats for queens &amp; couldn’t squeeze the points for class freak.
---
If they haven’t already claimed i would be willing 😂😂
---
I've done this, AGL 33, Sneak 3, Escape Artist, Fixer - Still getting occasionally spotted.
---
Hell, I've done, AGL 15, Garb of Mysteries, Eye of Ra, Fixer, Chamleon Mutation, been spotted.
---
&gt; EDIT :  
---
Thank you everyone. One of the support reached out and is now working to resolve this problem.
---
Having to go this far to get confirmation by support(after also waiting for 8 weeks, on a ticket THEY deleted without any notice to you) just shows how bad things really are though..
---
I don't think so. Yesterday I did drink ten alcoholic drinks, kill a Gulper at Gulper lake, claim a workshop -- all in about five minutes for 30 atoms. Didn't bother with the level up or Vault 94 - but they were all pretty easy. Generally they seem to have gotten easier.
---
Just today I came back to my camp after a hard day of killing varmit, killed the varmit that seem drawn to my camp, and lay down my head in the pillow... on the dirty mattress. And then a horse event spawned in my camp so I had to get up again and shoot more damn varmit. One of them dropped a three star assasins cavalier leather leg. It’s level 5. Dammdest thing I ever saw, need to find me a whippersnapper fresh out of the vault with a hankering for starting fights and then running.
---
I always heard bug ending is when somebody picks up wet kindling. Don't know if true and can't control what other people do anyway so...
---
Thank you very much.
---
It took a while to get the right structure, along with the decor and lights but I'm happy with it.
---
It's going to be a series, so gotta find somewhere for the next Museum.
---
Lovely lovely you gotta show some pictures when you can. I love seeing camps.
---
If they fail because of their bad business, that is on them....not the consumer. 
---
I like 76 conceptually but it seems at every opportunity they choose to rush or gouge instead of just supplying fun and getting paid for it on an already made brand.  
---
I've seen a lot of games do some innovative and kind business practice that became very profitable and helped them build a proper nest egg. I compare it to Bethesda and see they are not doing that.  It's like a busker vs an aggressive panhandler that's a little unhinged.   
---
You are basically saying that if I don't give money to this aggressive stupid rushed company they don't go back to  entertaining for Fo5  but to me it feels like they dropped the instrument and you want me to pay them to not play in hopes they will pick up the instrument again or else they may get so poor they will sell their flute. The trend shows me that is not the route they are taking and they intent to aggressively panhandle more and more, at what point does it become robbery, extortion or mongering? Pretty far but is what micro,macro, paywall and adwalls do.  Like no I don't want to pay 5€ for white hair, but I also don't want 5£ a month to play a preciously free style going forward..."just because"
---
It's objective but a lot of the choices they make to earn money comes off as morally grey, annoying, or in bad faith.  Not something I intent to support.  
---
Just make a good game and be honest.
---
Tl:DR 
---
I personally don't have it out for Beth and would love if they got their act together. The only reason  I discuss it is because maybe it helps.
---
If you say so.... alright.
---
Now you need to gather mamy others like you to disprove what I said and avoid being an exception on statistics.
---
Tbh. The perfect build is an instigating +power attack +1 str gauntlet or power fist. With all the right parts you can one-shot the queen.
---
ya i had a similar issue to op with my steam acount and since i put the old cc # (card was expierd) that responce was auto deleted
---
you lack common sense and healthy relationships. What kind of sick twisted Dynamics you consider the norm is anyone's guess but you got baggage kid.  Bethesda is a game company not the answer to anything but fun. This forum isn't for you
---
If you can get out 3 examples and use an etc to fill in the obvious others I'm fine with that.  I dislike seeing someone fake a list with 1 example and then etc because they couldn't think of anything to support their idea and are copping out.
---
nope, because it was probably made from duped steel. Sorry kid
---
Are you on PC? Can you show me how it's done?
---
Because I killed the queen many times with teams recently and not a single time she died very fast.
---
I've noticed it when you use the wet suit underarmor, the other underarmors are ok for me
---
I noticed that, if i wear BOS underarmor, my character will become more skinnier, and if wear Marine underarmor, my character becomes bulkier, also my Marine armor pieces looks larger if i got the Marine underarmor equipped.
---
Yeah the drain is pretty big and annoying and not reduced by class freak. I'm thinking to remove it.
---
I agree with and appreciate pretty much everything our OP says but am okay for Electro Convulsive Therapy so early in the morning.
---
Wow, you really are a farmer. Nice roleplay.
---
On paper it is the highest dps weapon, but after testing it, its a bit of dissapointment damage wise.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/dsdwfb/discussion\_heavy\_gun\_indepth\_comparison/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/dsdwfb/discussion_heavy_gun_indepth_comparison/)
---
What's your build?
---
If you do the story "in order" you'll be doing the Responders quest line, Raiders, Free States, Bos, Enclave.  Only at the end is there an option to nuke. Now it is possible to skip, straight to the Enclave, but you should do the story at least once first.
---
I run no vats non automatic pistols. Pure damage and defense
---
Someone’s been playing Outer Worlds lol
---
I just drink from the cure all fountain
---
If you hate having lots of stimpacks I’d recommend an unarmed/melee build.
---
No need to thank anyone here, buddy. These guys didnt do much but provide extra bitch and wine. I'm glad it worked out for you and they got in contact.
---
Are you using stealth? I have a bloodied and an unbloodied commando, and while the full health character doesn’t do as much damage, if I use sneak to get in close and go for headshots it works fine.  Especially if you max out commando, covert operative and bloody mess. 
---
You’re never going to be that effective on the Queen, just get your hits in and then use your talents keeping the heavies and unarmed bloody melee types safe from the mobs. But you’re also much tankier than the bloodied builds in that fight, and that has its own advantages.
---
Sounds like the emails you've received is part of phishing. Make sure the URL used in recovery are legit. It is normal for people to easily get deceived by this, so to avoid such issues in the future, always use 2FA. It save you from a lot of troubles.
---
Marsupial, Healing Factor, Speed Demon, Eagle Eye, Adrenal Reaction, Bird Bones - that's all I use on my stealth bloodied shooter build. I don't use Grounded since I sometimes use energy weapons and I don't need to bother about energy damage, since most of the time I'm invisible due to high Agility and unyielding/sneak armor. I also use Class freak so I don't have to worry about mutation negatives.
---
Isn't it funny that Bethesda Support always reaches out to you *after* you make a public post calling them out for being less than useless? Just a thought.
---
Packs are thoroughly RNG, you could get lucky and get a "first card" drop, or unlucky and just get cards you don't need want, or cards that are way above your level
---
Speed demon is fantastic for reloads and also moving while stealthed. I always go carnivore as you can always eat on the move- the game dumps tons of food so you never need to carry much.
---
Non automatic Pistols isn't in a great spot atm but I don't think a furious faster fire rate Gatling laser would be worth to change your whole build. I would suggest make a new character and use it on him
---
Thanks :)
---
Indeed, I mostly play alone and never got a group to do the vault; it's very common to get your request to group rejected (on PC at least)
---
I want this too. 🙂
---
I'm on PC and sometimes fast travel os indeed a pain.
---
This is not a common occurrence, but it is pain... the map just ignores you.
---
I pre ordered the game, and Christmas last year I bought the platinum edition guide because I wanted the map and art work to hang on my wall. I've paid well over the initial asking price for the game because I'm a fan of the franchise and honestly I really love walking around Appalachia. It has been absolutely worth the price for me and I never joined the bandwagon on bashing the game. 
---
76 has never deserved the reputation it has regarding bugs because it was never, ever, as bad as the hate machine always made it out to be.
---
I stopped reading half way so just will respond to that part. Paragraphs dude. If you can't be bothered to make it easy to read, we can't be bothered responding.
---
It's not about bad mouthing Bethesda. It's about pushing them to be better, or at the very least meet their own level that they set with their commitment to no non-cosmetics in the Atom Store, better and more frequent communication and fulfilling their 2019 roadmap. 
---
They failed on all three counts and many more.
---
There are people just here to pile on the shit show but a lot of it is fair and reasonable criticism for a company that deserves it.
---
I believe they fixed that awhile back. You could hop up on the ledge then sit in chair but I don't think it has worked in a bit.
---
Are we talking personally or aboutr my char? :D
---
There are plenty of guides about soloing the queen. I can solo the queen easily with my bloody melee character.
---
Here's a YouTube Playlist of captainoob soloing the queen with various weapons.
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmVp0DSeGGnAf0WUG9a7bSGoGAcbTljYK
---
They said they fixed it. I haven't seen anyone complaining about it recently either. It's probably safe.
---
I got a Bloodied FFR Ultracite gatling laser and run with a build like this:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f334f2c&amp;d=sq2s22sx2s32sr2pe2c72ip2a00l71ls2lt2lu2a70l20eh2ic4ir2id2s10&amp;w=&amp;m=c2fe&amp;nw=&amp;n=Heavy%20Freak%20Gunner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f334f2c&amp;d=sq2s22sx2s32sr2pe2c72ip2a00l71ls2lt2lu2a70l20eh2ic4ir2id2s10&amp;w=&amp;m=c2fe&amp;nw=&amp;n=Heavy%20Freak%20Gunner)
---
ok.
---
I just hope to find any of you when I run to kill the queen, because she takes time to kill in almost all tries, and in a very few she dies instantly (like once I saw people that didnt even shot her a single time and she died), making me wonder wtf happened.
---
My camp has crops, even though it's not a farm. [But I like staying in there, taking care of it](https://i.redd.it/b8fh4e0y77m31.png). I'm preparing for a big expedition, but while I gather the necessary materials I stay around the camp. And when I get to it, I like [walking to the location](https://i.redd.it/ii1ix3f14nn31.png), usually on the way back. That said I'm sure that with the amount of hours I dedicated to the game I could easily be a level 200 and beat the main story, but only recently I achieved level 50 by helping out a friend level up.
---
For solo I think easiest is stealth approach, easiest for Dead in the Water and Washdown (done this solo on easy and normal). For Meltdown, because of high radiation, you must use PA and bloodied is not the best option, at least for solo try. Hard is very difficult to do solo, so good group (that know what to do) is a must.
---
The fastest way to kill the queen is melee, you can use over 10 different buffs at the same time to make your melee power go wild. There are 8 food buffs for melee, bobblehead and magazine, chems, whiskey, and nukashine. The damage output is near 10k per hit with full melee buffs and sneak attacks
---
I did think bloddied was not the best, it’s all well and good doing 1k damage but a few hits back and I’m down, 
---
I’m not bothered about solo as I can always get someone to tag along with me 
---
Best power armor to use ? I usually run with excavator and Cali shocks,but I have all of them, 
---
I’m not clued up on stealth so will have to do some research on perks etc 👍
---
Oh, that thing haunts me throughout the last 5-6 patches, so freakin' annoying... Happens at least once every two log-ons or so. By that time I don't think they are capable of resolving that kind of issues, God knows what are the dev team really focused on if such annoying bugs keep pestering us for months if not since b.e.t.a. (or even since FO4 release)
---
We... have? My character has a glorious beard. Not sure what you are asking for here...
---
I run bloodied stealth shooter and I one-shot in the face everything except kings and queens, so with 2/3 missions I'm good. I'm never visible for enemies, so I don't have to worry too much about being hit. For Meltdown I use my heavy gunner with Strangler Heart PA set with slight changes to Perk cards that utilize IntigatingSS Grognak, very useful for one-swing kills of most enemies.
---
U have an exp flamer ?
---
Yeah queens are a weakness as up close they spank me, but I was wondering if the be laser would melt her quickly, ive not got many heavy other then a vamp Gatling and Ve minigun, but for Queen they might provide useful, I’ve got 5/6 points in slugger as I use the instigating sledge and try to one tap them, is it mainly mirelurk you face down there ?
---
Awesome! Thank you for the info :)
---
NAR Repair Yard spawns 1/3 Sheepsquatch vs Supermutants or Scorched for me. Mirelurkkings or Deathclaws on other occasions.
---
My advice is not to waste time soloing novice. It's a complete waste of everything. Use those 40 minutes to recruit someone and do standard and expert.  Doing the raid in a team is super efficient,both in time,effort,reward and resources used.
---
Sorry to hear :( maybe try switching to borderless windowed mode? might let you do ctrl alt delete in that case? I run borderless windowed so maybe that's why I can do it and you can't?
---
RemindMe! Two Years
---
Look man if you are challenged by pve then more power to you, have fun. You're getting a little cheesy throwing out cheating implications now lol. If pve is what you enjoy then do so. No need to get nasty.
---
How are they overcharged
---
I was being silly. they still drop on my head, but now the supply crates are doing the same thing.
---
Yes because steel is the most difficult material to get in the game.. pleb.
---
Sneak bonus definitely works fine with other players around
---
What I would like to see :
---
\- half-width walls
---
\- quarter roofs
---
\- open angle roof (we only have the close angle roof, both were in Fallout 4)
---
\- half-height stairs that clip on quarter floors so that we could make L-shaped stairs
---
\- the full concrete set from Fallout 4
---
Obviously a CAMP budget increase would be great but it's another point.
---
I'd really like to see this because although lots of player are creatives, majority of CAMPs look like boxes because of these so-wide walls and floors we use as frame.
---
Could've sworn I bought plans up to shielded in enclave bunker. Been a long time though🤔
---
I’ve posted videos all the time. They haven’t been deleted. Self promotion is if you have some YouTube channel you are spamming, not sharing something unique in the game.
---
so if you want less enemies to distract you from sbq you actually should NOT clean any corpses then?
---
I’d be up for joining too, L134 and never done a raid
---
imagine trying to talk to bethesda
---
Why not just fix PvP instead? :v
---
It's an honourable idea for sure, but I'd hate to see you responsible to a bunch of folks when Bethesda inevitably drop the ball somehow and delete a bunch of scrap.  
---
Not trying to bad mouth them but there have been so many fuck ups from them that I wouldn't risk holding things for other people :(
---
And they delete your support tickets
---
You can always gang up on them with your friends, I have a group of eight friends(2 teams) that play together and we usually all fight the same fights, even if the fight is with one griever. We've killed a few level 200+ players that tried to grieve us.
---
Although for some players crashes seem to have increased, I can say the last month or so,  the game only crashes about every 8 hours for me. Used to be every 2 hours. So definitely improvement and playable.
---
  
---
What bugs me more is the free DLC like Misschief Night. The devs have at least a year experience now (probably more from before launch but I have heard that not all devs were involved in the creation of the game) and still think it is perfectly fine to put it out in the state it was. I do not think that part will be improving much. In BGS' eyes, free content is allowed to be crappy...
---
Imagine yourself in two years, feeling the slip of time robbing you of your years, and you realize that you have spent your time posting about a game you don't even like while you could have had fun, like they people who enjoy and play that game.
---
Hey, I am building a new camp while I am posting this, good times. Soon time for a new raid into 94 with my buddies too!
---
I'm an Xbox player since the BETA, and I've never really had to many issues. Just an observation, but it seems PC users suffer the most. For the first few months I just assumed the PC port was an afterthought and not included in the original concept of the game.
---
"You hooligans get the hell off of my crops yah hear"
---
*Loads shells*
---
Make your own end game mentality. I set myself a target and grind till I reach It. And then another target etc. I made a berserker's build, gunslinger, commando, heavy PA, currently grinding in NW. So it's whatever I feel doing.
---
I keep playing cause it doesn't stress me out like other games, and there are a few people that still play, that I like to talk too.
---
There's going to be an update in a few hours, will it fix anything? No one knows yet 🤔
---
If you follow the advice most are giving and do not report it please don’t ever whine again about anyone cheating. Same goes for everyone else who gave that advice.
---
Less lag!
---
Since patch 14, when I go home or anywhere for cooking (i.e. after project paradise when you have 50+ meat parts) it takes me 2 or 3 more time than before
---
I did a video on the dresses 😊 https://youtu.be/_4AXZI2eevY
---
Thank you 😊
---
Did I sound like I was whining?? No, I didn't. Not that it's any of your business, but I submitted video proof almost 20 minutes after making this old ass post....
---
Cross play.. for free.. lol
---
Between 12-15 is normal on PS4
---
This happened to me last week. Go to the atomic shop and re-select the emotes you own and they will get a check mark showing it’s equipped or whatever. Worked for me anyway.
---
I really don't see this on PC, but I did have a disconnect the other day and could not remember the last time. It was that long ago. Crashes I don't see and my game is fast and smooth.
---
 Are you on a console?
---
They were supposed to release it along with Wastelanders but Wastelanders was pushed back and so the steam release was pushed back with it
---
Also, it was REALLY hard to replicate, so it was never really a risk during normal playthrough.
---
Yeah, I'm on PS4 pro. Glad to hear the PC version is doing better, I guess
---
Knowing the plan also opens up the possibility to get them from Purveyor so there is that ...
---
Those zealots wouldn't get past my defenses for shit
---
Reloads shotgun with malicious intent
---
 I wonder if the PS4 network, which I think is there when one is online, is screwing things up? 
---
 Otherwise a spotty connection can cause disconnects. I think the one I had the other day was my little local wifi network getting funky.
---
It really isn't that wonderful, I think we keep playing despite the games glaring faults and bugs not because there are none we just love Fallout.
---
I just tried a run through Whitespring and the ghouls were the **all** fast moving hard to kill sliding ones *after a year* and they are unable to fix this, some were frozen in walls or ceilings, I'd laugh if it wasn't so sad.
---
Disconnects and crashes still happen for no apparent reason on my PC version. I like to refresh my Windows 10 occasionally and re install FO76, helps I think but may be a placebo.
---
*licks lips and sweats hoping he finds something to kill*
---
Oh I always do
---
I personally find challenge, sure... I cant kill the queen alone myself.
---
I'm not trying to provoke you (I re-read what I wrote, and I agree it sould like, but, I'm really not) I'm just stating what I'm currently seeing... by far, most of the tries the queen takes some time to die.
---
Maybe people with good builds are not killing her anymore... maybe I'm playing on a bad timezone (I'm not on US where I imagine most of players are from...)... the point is I am experiencing this, I see many players not being able to damage her fast.
---
Also in a clinic in Harper's ferry, in a basement for various drugs and stims, locked lvl 3 safe i think with other loot...
---
As a solo player I've almost always been able to do the "quests in a group" ones just by spamming *everybody* with group requests.  It's a bit tedious but almost always *someone* accepts in the end.
---
It's completely possible, but I don't have issues with any other online games.
---
Hah, so silly.  
---
Works, thanks.
---
&gt; Yes they reduced the flow of Atoms by replacing some challenge rewards with items under the guise of helping low level people survive. 
---
About 500 atoms that you get at the start.  No effect on the dailies or weeklies.
---
Thank you!
---
Last 4 times I have done has been the ending with Mia, the (not so) friendly Councillor Wendigo.
---
Damage per hit is capped at 110 but the armor being capped at 300 is false, as is some other stuff on that pvp damage post, I wouldn't read it tbh.
---
Do you have any tips for leveling early on to avoid damage of range mobs without sneak?
---
I would love a new fallout that borrowed the origin idea from Dragon Age, where you pick your characters back story and it starts you in a different location, with different NPCs to talk to. You could start as a raider in a raider camp or BOS on an airship or a vault dweller in a . . . uh . .  vault. Just something to help make your characters yours.
---
I did not go bloodied until I reached about 40, then made the change, early on I think it would be pretty hard, way to squishy.
---
&gt;  they removed most atom rewards for early level rewards 
---
"most"?
---
so putting one perk in a tree to "unlock" it makes no sense since its totally random? well then its just weird :)
---
You can enter it by jumping up onto the circular overseers office-type window in power armour and then dismounting while facing away from the window.
---
I currently have over 11,000 atoms.  I've never bought any, I've spent a few (fridge, collectron, bungalow, Mr fuzzy ride).
---
They're not hard to get.
---
I’d say no but if you get someone desperate for it. I’d say maybe 10k at most. I sell them in my vendor for 8.5k.
---
I play solely as a cowboy style character,I've got all the carry weight cards (strong back,thru hiker,pack rat) and 15 strength.Enough agility to be able to be basically invisible when sneaking and a quad single action revolver to boot. That with my gas mask,duster and cowboy hat makes me able to sprint across the map,stealth my way through any enemy camp looting my way through and have enough space left in my inventory to sprint home (I have never once fast travelled,that's some freaky ass witch craft) but now I consider myself retired.
---
 I've dropped all my carry and gunslinger perks for home defense, contractor and happy camper style perks.y farm is my lively hood and o intended on being very lively. After launching my first nuke this is the only thing I could think of to do seeing as everything else just makes me bored as hell. Farming is simple and rewarding,no matter what that zealot Wallace has to say.
---
I will check that next time I'm on,thank you friend
---
Damn, sounds like one hell of a life you got there friend
---
Did they actually say that? I always took it that people assumed that that would be the case.
---
Personally never came across anything saying that Steam version will be released along side Wastelanders.
---
When it gets 2.5k upvotes and is presented as indicative of a larger problem, that's part of their fucking job. Community is upset about something, guess who is supposed to let the company know?
---
I've played every fallout game and so far 1 2 and 76 were the only ones that made sense
---
can we extended it to all rad weapons? someone yesterday was giving me rads from a rad rifle even though i was in passive and did not engage.   (i took no hp damage, just rads)
---
not enough to be a threat, but i did have to hit the shower a few times
---
That one leaker dude confirmed that was the case and that they want the steam launch to go as well as possible
---
Zenimax your talking about Zenimax the parent company of Bethesda that ordered all the atom shop things and overruled bethesda and what they were aiming for
---
Zenimax is the one that is raking in the cash not Bethesda as they are the ones taking most of the profits
---
Someone did a video recently on this topic and they found that a lot of the people that keep playing just like the familiarity of it. Like it's a mostly enjoyable hamster wheel to grind and wind down with than anything overarchingly great about the game itself.
---
I had an Amish character for a while. No electricity, always fighting at the farm, defending it (workshop) from molerats, protectrons.... Of course my weapon was a pitchfork. It was fun for a while.
---
Sounds dangerously awesome
---
 &gt; Blocked.
---
Hey, just like Bethesda!
---
they do know because it was team B making the game which means a less talented team made the game but they could have tested it better than that. also I know that Bethesda had plans for fallout 76 because of the loyal community and the cool events that happen every now and than. but I can agree that fallout 76 is a very laggy and buggy game but I don't care. I love 76. also ark survival is a trash game that shouldn't have came out on console. all in all I can ignore the lag and glitches and I love 76.
---
Primed Bloodied FFR Ultracite Gatling laser and/or Primed TS FFR LMG … Melts her!

The higher levels of that perk should highlight unlooted enemies from a longer range.
---
What, you mean the mmofails dude? So right now it's at best a rumour.
---
No problem, great fun to play!
---
Switch things around to match your playstyle, have fun :)
---
Here here
---
In how many hours? That's important for the OP's question.
---
Wear it and stand in your base, beside that: no way
---
Whatever you say man.
---
My cue would be when I find the bug pins.
---
No cosmetics are. I'm sorry, I don't care what the in-game economy is, it's a cosmetic with no stats. It's worth 50 caps at most.
---
That's been a thing since FO4.
---
didn't say to support fo76. there are plenty of different games that can be used to support them. this post was made as wondering why people would want to boycott a, for the most part, good game developer.
---
Yes the private servers run way smoother then the peasant ones
---
Step one: have fallout first and play on a private server 
---
That’s it, that’s the only step you need to not have pvp at a workshop.
---
I play it (infrequently) because I got it used off of eBay for $12 about a month after launch. For that price, I was willing to give it a shot. And it turned out, all the bad things I had heard were true. That being said, I enjoy the core gameplay loop. I also have a couple friends that own the game so we play together and goof around and whatnot. I don't take the game seriously at all. And I don't spend a penny in the Atomic Shop or for a 1st subscription.
---
People say it's better with friends. Yea, but almost anything is better with friends. It's not the game I'm.enjoying with friends, it's my friends company, which I can enjoy on any game. People say make your own fun. No, Bethesda made the game, they have to make a reason for the game to be fun. Not me having to do mental gymnastics to convince myself the game is fun.
---
I'd never say this is a good game, not in its current state. But there is SOME enjoyment to be found.
---
What platform you guys on
---
It’s not forgetting- it’s called moving on. And it’s the healthy adult way to approach things after time has gone by.
---
A little bit, yes. Less people on a server means the game runs better. But this game never runs well no matter what kind of server you're on.
---
Fallout 76 has no story. It has lore.
---
Problem is, this post ignores the technical and performance issues of 76. Yes there's potentially a good game underneath all the issues, but I can't enjoy the game because of said issues. Therefore, it's a bad game.
---
I wasn't going to anyway...
---
Why not scrapbox &gt; inventory &gt; stash?
---
8-9k
---
I only find a handful of players now...
---
Yeah him. It's a rumor with some realistic credibility behind it at least.
---
Thanks for the tips, Todd.
---
Please Bethesda: Fix your game.
---
Adrenal reaction and in run marsupial just to avoid those neatly enemies that one shot me at low health
---
Bethesda - Please fix your game.
---
Um you have one?
---
Not anymore, they patched that long ago. I managed to snap a rather foreboding screenshot in there, but the lighting wasn't set up of course.
---
It's an awful, incomplete, buggy, broken, glitchy, laggy game. Not saying it can't be enjoyed, I enjoy it on occasion. But no way I would ever say this is a good game.
---
Fair point but it still reduces the overall pool of free atoms which produces artificial demand, marketing 101.
---
Cool story, bro.
---
The last thing I need is some Hipster Bearded wacko smacking me with another protest sign because I have the Ranger Gear on.
---
That would be hilarious tbh
---
That's a player doing a nice thing. Has nothing to do with the game. Players can do nice things on any game. That player rules, doesn't mean the game rules. Two different things.
---
No, because you always get to pick a perk card of your choice from any SPECIAL every time you level up. So just pick the Shotgun cards of you want then. 
---
You do know that you don’t have to pick a perk from the same SPECIAL you upgraded, right?  You can increase Intelligence but select a Strength perk card.
---
Low energy troll has low energy.
---
You don't get to post in a public forum on the internet then pick and choose who replies based upon who and what supports your narrative.  Sorry, not sorry.
---
Yed, please. Show me more.
---
Like the constant freezes, the bugs and the lack of content?
---
No, guess you dont like the idea. No need to be mean.
---
The quest that used to trigger getting into there USED to be in the game, but after people exploited the trigger(which afaik was super hard to do and very buggy) they stripped the entire thing from the game including the skins and such you could unlock from inside that room.
---
But it's nothing interesting really, used to PA glitch everywhere to explore and that was one of the areas we did it in.
---
&gt; or listening to heresy for information.
---
I'm assuming that's a typo for hearsay, or are you secretly in the cult of the Mothman despite your flair?
---
Not for me. Couldn't even enter Vault 94 the other day without the game freezing.
---
This has been an issue since Skyrim's dragons, chances of Bethesda being capable of fixing it are very minimal
---
I remember when I first bought game time and the look on my face when I discovered that it's not 30 days of played time.
---
Send me a psn invite and we can try it sometime!
---
I've never seen this actually kill anyone besides the person doing it.
---
I say 250 just because it’s rare
---
Can confirm it exists. Not sure which locations have dropped for me.
---
xbox
---
Probably, but good luck getting one. They're an ultra rare legacy weapon.
---
You could imagine the couriers parents being what ever you want, so the only thing missing is co-op. (But not actually if you count mods)   
---
You can mod in what ever story you want. I feel like looking at the other side of the coin fallout 76 is more restrictive (in it's currant form) then the other titles.
---
I know this won't be a popular statement, but it will improve your personal experience with the game.  Get a friend with Fallout 1st and never play on public servers again.  The private servers are less buggy, far more stable, the overworld loot hasn't been gone for hours and hours by the time you get on, the only people irradiating you are people you know and chose to play with, and you won't get disconnected right after killing the scorch beast queen losing all your fucking loot.
---
As far as I see it, there's three downsides.
---
1. Indirectly supporting Bethesda's poor business practices by playing on a private server.
---
2. No longer having encounters with randoms/random PVP (If you're in to that)
---
3. Not being able to make caps from your personal vending machine.
---
jup thank you for the additional info.
---
if it would raise the odds i'd pick a card to unlock the tree but if i can get them random regardless if it was "activated" i just wait and see.
---
 im at 140 and usually only get doubles of what i have so i was just wondering if i was doing it wrong :)
---
Yes. There's between one and four (?) growing on a log by the bus and another growing on a pile of junk to the side of the building. A good spot.
---
Or u could just not post about it on reddit, that would work
---
This would be easy. You end up with 20 beer bottles and baseballs because of this, why not add a couple of things people use undoubtedly more often like the bug parts.
---
Done
---
+karma
---
That's a touch high but still what I would consider fair for that one.
---
the 4 downvotes made me laugh, how can you be that hurt over facts? lmao
---
Pretty sure most of the people in this reddit never experienced any different game other than f76, its the only thing that explains why they think its a good game. They are just blind and doesnt care about getting lied constantly and getting ripped off by shit like fallout 1st
---
1) the gun
---
Look for a lever with faster fire rate, FFR, as the major modifier (second star). When you get some big bucks look for less vats cost or faster reload as the minor modifier (third star). 
---
Don't underestimate a L35 lever with those perks... if you find one it will be way cheaper than a L45 and in game you will not notice the difference.
---
2) the perks
---
Bloody mess in luck. Covert operative for sneak bonus attacks, gun fu and adrenaline in agility. All 3 rifleman cards plus the tank killer in perception. 
---
3) build
---
Bloody is the most popular but junkies and berserker are also viable. Team the primary perk of your weapon to the overall build you are aiming for... team instigating and executioner guns is also a technique that some people use.
---
Not they're not hard to get, I get Atoms every month as part of my 1st membership.
---
Yes, I would saw on average I probably get one pa plan for every hundred I do. Raider, T-45, T-51, T-60 will all drop from treasure maps. I belive the forest is the only one that doesn't drop plans.
---
I may be a peasant but I can spell.
---
I've be rewarded with random power armor plans every treasure location but the Forest. Still may be able to get them there but not in my personal experience.  Level 225, since beta
---
Bit worried I won't be able to use my existing account on Steam though. I've multiple characters, the highest being level 350 something. I'm not spending a year getting back to where I am now!
---
Although I suppose they'd have to work this out with Steam because people will have paid for fallout 1st too and that's gotta be carried over.
---
I think the main issue is the lag mixed with the timers. Trying to access a computer or open a door that at times literally takes 30 seconds to activate kills half of the precious timer. Either the timer needs to be adjusted or certain objects need to be activated automatically via a proximity to them, maybe both?
---
I wont dis-credit the freezing and disconnects though as they have seem to be ramped up lately, especially on public servers. However, I'm not entirely sure "fixing" the servers to 100% stability and smoothness is obtainable, seems it would have been done by now. Not trying to make excuses just trying to give an alternative to use as they work on the main issue.
---
I've played since the Beta (PS4). Never had any real problems with bugs. I perhaps average one disconnect per 15 hours of playtime and that doesn't seem to have changed.
---
This. Although I was still so paranoid I didn't touch it for weeks!
---
They're affected by ammosmith - I actually just got some 120/100 cores trying to remember what the hell perk affected their crafting.
---
Except he did report it.. Which is why it was patched..
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Yeah having a timer at all with how bad this game is with lag was a retarded idea in the first place. All the doors should open automatically instead of waiting for the stupid button to be able to be activated for a start.
---
I can support this idea. I have been playing with a friend recently on a private server and the experience has been great. We explore all over the place and find far more loot. We have also realized that some events actually had bosses that dropped legendary loot that we had never seen before since the bosses are usually vaporized so quickly.
---
It has also been nice being able to use the workshops. Taking the workshops, defending them, etc has been good for resources and xp.
---
At L45 farm uranium fever for legendary weapons... they will be L40 and if your luck is in can take you through another 50 levels... a l25 exploding executioner lever was a god send at L45!!
---
Last part of the main quest. Don't rush though. I rushed part of the main quest to get access to a certain other thing and regretted not really paying attention to that part ever since.
---
I haven’t experienced any stability issues like you described
---
Massive melee damage comes from perk, food and chem stacking rather than just the weapon.
---
Don't worry, if OP finally returns, he will see it for himself. That's what matters.
---
sums it up right
---
Use broken armour with berserker to get the passive perks... life saving &amp; auto stim work well.
---
Lol yea okay I'll make sure all my psych teachers and professors know how you feel. I'll make sure to tear up all my work in the field and burn all my books on human behavior.
---
Run along, kiddo, adults are talking.
---
It's a shame because without crafting amongst other things the game is hard to enjoy for me and I can't find simple screws and springs LOL
---
I can get you in there. It's super easy to reach. Pretty boring though :/
---
24 real world hours or in game hours?
---
I'm not saying it would work on all of them. But it would work on most.
---
Imho they have become easier, after they had become much harder during Wild Appalachia.
---
Deleted Support tickets sure sounds like the guy who compromised your account is still trying to cover his tracks and still has access to whatever account/device you’re using to submit those tickets...
---
Well, it's worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. Personally i wouldn't even buy it for 10 caps.
---
Probably just a couple of items returning to the Atom Shop and the background change.
---
I *never* cheat, so I have nothing to worry about. AND I grew up in a slightly different time I guess. I can take just about anything anyone can dish out. I've been doxxed and had my personal shit put out there. But as I said if you live in an honorable way, you have nothing to worry about. Which I do, so I dont.
---
We. I hope I run into you some day!  Carry on Wastelander!
---
The story being so bad really got to me, mainly because it had the bones of the greatest one yet. Possibly the last green land in America, under attack from a disease that could destroy the rest of life on Earth. Having to nuke it should have been a huge emotional deal, but instead everyones just kinda chill about it.
---
This would also help those of us who build our CAMP on hills and have trouble planting. Growing Mutfruit and Razorgrain on hills is a pain!
---
Private servers were never promised to be free.
---
Out of all of the random changes in this game they've fucked up they somehow managed to implement this one without any fault. A fix that makes it harder to farm. Figures.
---
Real time
---
Things can change last second preventing them from pushing something in an update
---
&gt;difficulty isn't in the raids themselves
---
so you self admit the problem isnt the raids.  as you said its the servers, an alternate method isnt needed if they fix the servers.
---
imo they shouldn't throw an alternate method in.  its the one team based thing we have with any moderate difficulty, we should keep good/great/possible best armor in game (build dependant) behind the current hardest content.
---
Now re-write this mumbling to something understandable.
---
I have to use the Santa beard to get the size I want... It would be nice to have more in game  so i csn use a scarf over it. More colors too.
---
I hope they'll finally fix 250DR affix on weapons - it's irritating you can't use really nice weapons because it's broken (I know about workaround, but it's not very useful for frequently reloaded weapons).
---
Dont let the christians hear you say that. They will brandish a buybull at you.
---
The health regen bug is especially prevalent with shotguns of all three types, both regular and legendary varieties.  It is absolutely horrible and pretty much makes shotguns unplayable at the moment.
---
Also wondered why on earth were we getting PVP updates. Played since launch and only had people try and engage in pvp with me 3 times.
---
Economy? The game didn't have an economy before player vendors, all the prices were fixed?
---
When Bethesda mention what is coming in the update, and then it consequently doesn't work (or isn't permanently fixed) it disrupts the community. I think the 'no talk, just deliver' mentality is better suited at this point.
---
Article with Sean Murray (of NMS), and how he would approach updates after a rocky launch: [https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/no-mans-skys-sean-murray-explains-why-its-best-for-anthem-and-fallout-76s-developers-to-stay-silent-after-launch/](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/no-mans-skys-sean-murray-explains-why-its-best-for-anthem-and-fallout-76s-developers-to-stay-silent-after-launch/)
---
Yeah, I've been crashing a bunch of times in SBQ fights since coming back to the game (been away from fo76 since january/february).  
---
If nothing else, this really highlights how much we need to be able to rejoin the server we were on if we crash or get dc.  
---
Fingers crossed they can pull it off along with text chat (on pc at least)
---
I disagree, theyve actually been far easier for a while. Definitely tedious though, but considering how stupidly impossible they used to be I’ll gladly take tedium.
---
He has proven his identity. He literally included the cc he used to purchase the game in beta. The fact they refuse to respond to him absolutely falls foul of the GDPR.
---
Do remember that with metal you lose that energy resist. So things like Robots, some super mutants, and some creature attacks will do major damage.
---
Also take into affect that high level enemies, like a Glowing Deathclaw, were the single strongest enemies in FO4. Glowing Deathclaws, Anglers, Yaoi Gu- not even gonna try to spell that, do insane damage regardless of your gear.
---
That's awesome! I'm a nerd that relies on power armor for survivability in combat, so I go with close to no armor outside the power armor (unless I'm gathering resources), and a light weapon for outside the power armor, while with the power armor depending on the day and available ammo I roll with either a gauss rifle or a .50 cal MG. Because I don't play often it's still my mission to explore and study the new Appalachia. My camp is basically a place to rest and resupply in the Forest region. I adapt perks as I need though, I still don't have all that I want in that respect.
---
Got any more?
---
I guess everyone else who is reporting freezes when they open menus such as the map, vendors or the Pip-Boy ar lying then *shrug*
---
The point is it's Bethesda and we already know they won't fix the servers.
---
I mean sure, but the fact you are a bad/bored troll it's all good XD you can read it yourself or just do you XD
---
Thanks for a clarification, I was purely guessing so the OP is out of luck then, online security hygiene, changing passwords regularly, using a password manager is still important and not trusting anyone to get near you devices 😒
---
Honestly hunting down cryptids. I get high and put some headphones on and turn off the radio enjoy the ambiance and hunt some cryptids. It's scary ass shit and amazing at the same time. My favorite was being chased by 2 Wendigos and bumping into the Mothman. One of the most amazing fights I've been in. I mean the Mothman wiped the floor with the Wendigos but fighting the beast was grand.
---
17500 is lowest you can get form serum recipes. It's a cap sink...
---
Nobody who actually plays this game thinks that only 1st members are getting griefed.  We all know everyone gets shit on.  Its so easy to avoid being griefed in this game now that it almost isn't an issue anymore.  I've been nuke mined a couple times and the most I had to do was hit my hotkey for diluted radaway and go about my business.  But my point still stands, the private servers improve almost every aspect of the game.  
---
Also Im still pissed that we got "private servers" for a monthly fee rather than WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE, dedicated servers we could stand up for ourselves and our friends.  I want to control everything about my server.  I don't give a fuck about game balance and I don't give a fuck about character compatibility with public servers.  I want to put all kinds of weird mods on it and play with my friends.  But no.  Instead of awesome dedicated servers, we got shitty private servers.  
---
I digress.  Find a friend with 1st and never go public again.  Public servers are a crashy, buggy mess that fuck you over at every opportunity.
---
Nope, it's normal. Prices for them were around 3-5k back when they were part of the queens drop table AND vendors only had a small cap limit.
---
I'm lvl 75 in adventure on my main. I've rarely seen loot in bosses after they're killed. Private servers are definitely better for progressing at a healthy rate. Especially defending public workshops. I've netted plans I didn't know how or where to get. Its nice not being griefed. But the random player camps are nice to see in a pub scrub.
---
Thank you for pointing to the great and actually reliable source of information !
---
How do you search for other weapons ?  For example, pipe gun and combat knife ?
---
I've tried to search the Nukacrypt for info about their mods but had no success.
---
The ounce of optimist within me thinks we might get some surprise content
---
The overwhelming pessimist in me however says otherwise.
---
So you don't have more?
---
We had a fight with them at the Whitesprings train station the other day. Once I figured out what they were doing I went back and crafted a couple dozen and joined in. Since everyone there figured out what was going on and stayed I figured it was in good fun until people started putting on hazmats. Then our game of mine tag just kinda fizzles out.
---
&gt;Buy game, play game, finish game enjoy game. WIN  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Or  
---
&gt;Buy game, play game, game sucks, don’t finish game.
---
Could not agree more.
---
And i guess this is also how the larger part of those that play games do it.
---
Exactly. And as long as they continue to offer at least a tiny trickle of atoms as a reward for completing in-game challenges then they can legitimately defend themselves against this accusation. Even though it is crystal clear that's what they're doing. "See? The players don't HAVE to buy atoms. They can still earn them in game!"
---
Found Todd Howard
---
If you're on Xbox theres always a few LFG posts inviting people to do just this, so long as they're friendly.
---
That's what I thought too until last night when a firster lvl 158 took my workshop. me being a lvl14 at the tyler county dirt track lol. I guess private gets boring when you can't destroy lower lvls lol
---
MODUS is one of the few cap sinks in the game - not a particularly good one, but still. So given that there is little else you can spend those caps on, and serums seem to sell reasonably well, I'd say the prices are steep but not unreasonable.
---
Introducing the new Dead Legendary Spotlight Kit!  Coming to an Atoms Store near you for 200 Atoms!  
---
^(One kit per legendary mob.  Doesn't matter if you can clearly see the mob without the spotlight.  Almost bug-free, 60% of the time it works every time!!!)
---
Only 197 if you have FO1st!!!
---
yawn
---
I like the AA LMG.  has worked well for most anything.
---
A Troubleshooters gatling (or resolute veteran, if you have it) is slower, it does more damage per hit than the AA... I found the Troublshooters gatling quite effective in a silo run.
---
These perks will help:
---
Str: bear arms (cuts heavy weapon weight).  Bandolier (reduced ammo weight).  
---
Intel (I think) : Stabilized
---
Acid extractor produces 10.  So while it helps, I usually get more acid from wendigo teeth, waste acid jars, antifreeze, coolant caps, etc. than the extractor makes.
---
Thank you for reply.
---
I have no proof of this sorry.
---
Because I was really confused at that time, so I mistake to take a video of this.
---
I know your feeling but the reason I wrote listed weapons is just for warn that you could lost such a your favorite weapon, like I losted it. 
---
I hope you will not meet this bug
---
Ever since survival mode was taken out i cannot play solo on my low level characters, I’ll have level 200+ players coming to destroy my single lead extractor at lakeside cabins trying to farm ammo for my level 15 toon.
---
We were askin for this shit year one they ain’t about it
---
Refined the trip, a little, made 35-40 last night
---
Got Mia just this week actually.
---
I totally support this! I was saying exactly the same to my teammates really often.
---
I know BE laser rifle was duped one but Quad crit railway is not duped.
---
I just wrote this for warn. Not for take advantage of a generous player.
---
My bet is they will implement the fixes they promised but failed to deliver the last time.
---
Other than that, yeah some Atom Shop stuff.
---
For me it's the people. I've met amazing friends through this game, we all do this grind, or achieve any number of goals/quests/challenges along side each other. We might bluster and get frustrated with it, we still eagerly await the new stuff and haunt the atomic shop together every Tuesday.
---
I've been nearly 3k hours in this game and I'm still learning new things about it every day. There's been so many I've had the privilege to guide into how this game works, how to make it work best for them, they thank me but it's for selfish reasons 😂 I get to know people and play with friends. Real people with a like-minded view of this game.
---
I've said it before, it's an existence. There's no real endgame, so there's only the goals you make for yourself, and if you're lucky, with friends.
---
To be fair, I don't play other games. I have for years, plenty. It's people, a real community, that is the reason why this remains in my preferences enough that I'm willing to deal with all the bs that comes with it. It's not just a game, in that sense, for me.
---
The shotguns damage is spread over all pellets which means armor decreases damage per pellet and since shotguns dont have any armor penetration besides the magazines and the anti armor legendary effect the damage coming through will be lower over all than one big hit with the gatling gun.
---
or...
---
take the workshop for the plans, but get out of dodge as soon as the claim is complete.
---
If you want to do the defend, stay outside of the zone and snipe the CG enemies.
---
I'll be on after the update and get with u then!
---
If you're going to be a little girl about people responding who dont support your narrative don't post in a public forum.
---
Explosive flamer? It's legacy now oO. I don't think it can work with friendly fire since it explosive change the fire to a projectile. You'd better find someone with one to test it. Good luck.
---
I can recommend a stealth shotgunner thats pretty powerfull.
---
Something we can try is plasma flamer tho.
---
All right ty
---
eh, it's only a survival game in the very loosest of terms.  It's really just an mmo rpg with guns.
---
All I care about with wastelanders is they better let me kill some fuckin humans lol
---
I’d like dirt rows that snap together in a straight line so I can grow my crops in proper rows
---
Are you playing the same game???
---
I read from some people that if you're in a party and one of your buddy is detected, you'll be detected as well. But I can't confirm or deny since I mostly play alone.
---
That's not the case though, it depends on the depth of the server pool for your region.  I'm not sure how the server you land on is chosen, but there isn't a limit like you're describing.
---
I spend almost every session server hopping these days, and while it is absolutely possible to get onto the same server more than once, I have never been limited to just a few servers.  I'll easily hit 10-12 in a session before getting bored and logging off.
---
Send an FR, and I'll accept so you can see when I get on, not home for 3 hours yet
---
Often legendary tho.
---
Bears for the springs...
---
Do bears eat springs in the woods... apparently 🤷‍♂️
---
I personally think they are much easier.  Claim a workshop.  Drink 10 alcoholic beverages.  Craft 5 healing items.  Are their particular ones you're having trouble with?  Maybe the community can give you shortcuts and tips.
---
True,
---
But because all the kinds of people that like to jump on hate band wagons aren't here it's one of the nicest communities in any game I've played.
---
Um, yes?
---
Unless the UI is totally wrong, I get sneak crits notifications and see damage numbers in the thousands versus in the hundreds.
---
I find it depends - if i am on my own then its slow going. If a bunch of other people show up to the party as well, then the enemies spawn in at a pretty good rate.
---
There's a counter of the last 180 or so items and 60 containers you looted, these things will not be loot able by you until you have pushed them off the list by looting other things. I have mules I rarely log onto and nothing at Berkeley station is ever loot able again because there are no respawn timers, it is a character specific counter. Other people can enter the area and trigger items to respawn but you still will not be able to loot it.
---
Won't serve minor's Or intoxicated patrons...
---
But Go for your life in the Chem Lab boz 
---
🙊🙉🙈
---
Farming easily would be to the detriment of maintaining a player base, resources need to be controlled to keep us logging in and not getting bored 😊
---
I know the ship has long since sailed, but I think it would be pretty neat if we could have got a popup with the goodies shown along with completed scorched earth to show us our personal damage percentage dealt to the queen.
---
Read his statement again, they patched the password exploit that his group found.
---
"Someone from my group stated that they already reported it to one of the community managers in our group, so I just left it. My account got a ban the next day."
---
"I dropped the items I got from the purveyor rolls. It is possible a few were still in the inventory when I logged out from the last test, but I am almost certain I dropped them as well."
---
And then on the MMOfails blog the author says:
---
"My sources tell me that he did not report any of his exploits, nor did he drop all of the items he received. He was quite literally caught with "multiple exploited items in his inventory".
---
And the Ecksera, the leader of the group says: "How would he be able to drop the exploited items if he had been banned after doing the exploit?"
---
So, the dilemma is, from now on as a community, are we giving a free pass to any one that says that he was exploiting and cheating but only for research? Or do we take a zero tolerance stance?
---
Of course many developers have a group for bug testing, that they have on the payroll and they know who they are. This guys say that they have contact with a community manager, a community manager has nothing to do with development on the game or addressing bans and most he can do is pass information.
---
The guy that makes the map made a big mistake, he made public all of this, his group is know now, he exposed the rest of them, they don't want this, that's why they only post on obscure forums and use they own discord. He knew the risk of using exploits and cheats, it's on the Bethesda ToS, also, why did he used multiple accounts to do this? Why did he use his main account to do this?
---
The update starts in an hour, and I can't get on for a bit either. On average they have it back up at 2pm et, so I'll get with you then for sure!
---
I'm a bloodied build, but I also have a ton of Vampire Explosive and VSS weapons. I found using Vampire really beneficial during my first run yesterday, especially if you get back into a corner by a swarm. I didn't use a single stimpack.
---
What system are you on by the way? If you're on PS4, I'd love to team up for raids whenever we're both available.
---
What are you trying to accomplish?  To crouch in a single spot and never, ever be seen?  Because that's not going to happen.  You need to actively move away from enemies.  Mongrels/Hounds, Mole Rats, and Stingwings, in particular, have a habit of attacking you even in \[Caution\].  If they get a hit in, you will stagger and your cover will be blown to everyone else because that counts as exiting stealth.
---
It seems steep but as a long term investment you can sell 2 per day for 1000 to vendors and like 300 each in your vending machine, you’re making your money back in 2 weeks!
---
If a game is on steam you can track the playerbase, and i don't think it would be great for Bethesda right now
---
Thanks for the build...I can probably take some perks on my main that would let me swap this out.
---
Question: Is an Ultracite weapon also considered Prime, or are they two different things? I have an ultracite gatling laser.
---
Less than a thousand hours.  So I get at least 11 atoms an hour for playing, and I don't spend *all* my time grinding for atoms.
---
(Actually at the start I didn't really try for atoms, I only started doing the dailies/weeklies when they (partly) fiixed the "find location" challenges and dumped a pile of atoms on me all at once).
---
Bethesda now have no motivation to increase server stability in Adventure as they will want to push people towards buying FO1st subscriptions. If anything it would be logical to scupper the Adventure servers to make more money.
---
I see, there was an external economy for in game items. I've only read about it. Now I understand how the dupers ruined it. Thanks.
---
maintenance and update 15 must mean more than bug fixes.
---
I ignore all locks and safes, haven't missed much.
---
You're gonna have to wait until Bethesda fixes it. Issue is server side, not client side.
---
Exactly!
---
My first character was a shotgun build. I used a TSE for a while but in the end it just wasn't doing enough damage. Other than recommending perk cards, I'd say go bloodied and use sneak to your advantage.
---
I would think so but on the website for Fallout 1st it says they are exclusive to members so maybe not.
---
So is your problem that Pompy won't launch the Operation Tidy daily at Kiddie Corner Cabins for you?
---
&gt;  New level of subscrpition.
---
That comes with a spell checker?
---
That's not pessimistic, given Bethesda's track record it's just realistic
---
The clean up and stings and things can only be done once a day. Check your personal terminal and it tells you when you can meet them. 
---
If thats not what you are asking I can't help I guess.
---
I didn’t even want to at first (which is why this was so late) but the $15 of Atoms and NCR armor compelled me to buy it
---
A lot of the Atoms you receive early in the game are related to Challenges and Achievements that get progressively harder like collect 76 wood, then 760, and 7600, so the income rate is diminishing by design, but it's pretty easy to get most of the daily &amp; weekly challenges with little effort.
---
My problem is the raid itself! It needs checkpoints! And ability to rejoin!
---
I have GTAV and... many oh so many other games for PVP. Almost no one wants PVP in F76. Why do you think survival mode is gone?
---
Nah, thats an Atom Shop item.
---
Nope.  The last three times I've run the event I've gotten Mia.  Sounds like you're just having bad luck with RNG.
---
Why don't you like the bug ending?
---
I can run builds in 76 that I never could in FO4. Bloodied is an outright pain in 4 as there are few perks to help you attain it, and those that do are special 10 level 50 required. The Far Harbor drugs are essential.
---
Heavy Guns are soooooooo much better because without CC you had Minigun,Flamer, Gatling Laser.
---
The three star legendary system really fleshes out a rather bland system in 4.
---
The map is actually big! 4 was so tiny. Yes it was littered with places to enter. Crossing the street can take me an hour at times but in 76 I can just explore and always find something knew.
---
Essentially it further builds on FO4 and I enjoy that.
---
I keep hearing this explanation and I simply don't buy it.
---
I rarely get this effect on non-explosive shotguns, and Bloodied non-explosives have no problem obliterating an enemy in a single hit.  But give me my Instigating Explosive Shotgun with the exact same setup, and it will do 99% damage, which corrects to 50%.  Then 99%, which corrects to 25%, etc.  Then 99%, which corrects to 15%, etc.  It's this whole diminishing returns bit that makes me skeptical of this "real damage" explanation.
---
Suffice it to say, if my Bloodied can kill an enemy in one shot, I would expect the Instigating to either do the same or come very, very close against an enemy with full HP.  Not do 50%.
---
That would be nice too, considering the last time it crashed I had almost killed the Strangler Heart and couldn't stimpak my friend before that because the lag was so bad the prompt never appeared. Would have helped if he could have rejoined me and we might have been able to finish before the server disconnected.
---
Hahaha imagine if Bethesda even gave a shit about the game in general.
---
I'm guessing it's something very few of us will notice along with atom shop updates. I won't be mad if they sneak in some new stuff though.
---
So you can get it for free then.
---
I managed to jump 51 levels. Double XP is crazy good. Hoping we get another one this year possibly.
---
True.
---
I'll try that. I do run it as such at release but had another issue that forced me to play full screen. I'm not sure what it was and its been a year now, no harming trying.
---
Agree - don't rush the game.  Explore, learn the lore, enjoy the graphics.  Do the main quests.  Your character will be stronger for it, making the rest of the play a bit easier.
---
For more or less level appropriate stuff:
---
 21 &amp; 26: the toxic valley is the place to be, along with working the mysteries quest, firebreathers, and recruitment blues (and its follow-ons).  
---
The 33... should be working all of those, plus the excavator quest and roaming the ash heap.  You can all start Roses quest, but it'll quickly take you into the divide, where you will feel (and are) under prepared and underleveled.  Do what you can and go back later.  For the best rewards from mysteries, start them, but dot return for the reward until you make L50
---
To that end, with a couple of exceptions, all of you will quickly be overwhelmed if you try to spend any time in the  center and East side of the map.   IMHO, L40-45 is going to be the threshold for survival.
---
Although I completed the pre-requisites and had I am become death/launch mission around L75, I had plenty of other stuff to do, so didn't launch until L151.  
---
YMMV and all those disclaimers :)
---
Here have this comment, because I cant upvote again.
---
Yeah.  To be fair, until she became able to run silos, I ignored Picklock and Hacker entirely on my alt and wasn't left wanting it.  The only reason I took them is because they make getting through the silo faster, and will probably have some importance down the line.
---
It produces a large volume of fertilizer which you need for other farms, and plenty of space and some pre-existing plants. Especially with the long exterior buildings that have stalls for animals and Brahmin corpses, I would consider it a farm, though I agree it is certainly a bit more industrial than some of the other farm locations.
---
Not to mention if you get a very popular one like adrenal reaction or marsupial you’ll easily get your caps back in some times
---
Carnivore can be a godsend. Farm nuked enemies for their ionized meat, and the floral for fluids. It's the only thing I use to keep my character well fed and hydrated. If I'm running out, I can always find a pack of wolves or whatever and eat on the fly!
---
Speed demon only creates increased thirst if ur sprinting, sometimes that's necessary. The real thing I love is faster reload, I didn't realize how much until I was leveling a mule yesterday! 
---
Keep inert flux handy in your stash, weight is much less than purified and only gives 5 rads. With a hit of diluted radaway you can manage it all just fine!
---
If you're cosplaying, you should search Etsy for "pioneer scout patch".   There's a really awesome one on there that I've been thinking about ordering for my hiking backpack.
---
It's probably related to their server maintenance right now. I can't log in to play right now because it's only letting me log into the launcher and website and not the game. It says "check your network connection". It seems to only do this around when they're doing maintenance so I assume they've got something shut down right now.
---
So shotguns need a buff then?
---
another thing i didn't put in the main post is it is the one (3) grindable items that are not locked behind rng drops, once you earn all the plans its just hit the daily steel.
---
Attaboy 👊
---
Wait... you now admit to asking for a refund BEFORE subscription yet you still bought the subscription even though you were returning the game????? 
---
That makes less sense and further supports my initial comment...
---
Ready for the jet pack fix. I’m sure it’s today.
---
I have definitely been getting a lot more plans now playing on a private server. 
---
I also like that things like terminals, hacking etc are MUCH faster. I don't think I would want to take the queen with just one other person but everyone else seems to be fine.
---
Everything also seems just a little bit less glitchy. I have not had a tesla rifle make enemies immortal in a private server but I have had that happen on a public server that is lagging.
---
Welcome to this forum: Where you get downvoted to hell if you still point out how bad Bethesda has come....
---
That's shitty
---
The time delay of the lockpicking activity is intentional.  In a silo, for example, it's meant to put you in a situation where you need to calm things down, or stealth, to pick the lock without getting backstabbed.  It also safeguards against the possibility of someone inadvertently picking a "wanted" lock.
---
Add motion assist servos and optimized bracers to your PA.  
---
Both add Str points, which will increase your melee damage.
---
Marsupial mutation will also boost Str (and add carry weight)
---
Yeah it’s not fair that they’re only playable in private worlds.
---
Yeah i hope so - i'd be ok with that, so long as they don't open up additional bugs/issues. This game needs a month or two of quality, QA'd patches to haul it back into line.
---
But I’d have to give up my jet pack, huh?
---
I'm hunting bugs, bugs of all kinds. Some come out at night, but they're cool at all times!
---
Right.  It's only common sense.  Wastelanders is essentially a do-over for Fallout 76, and it makes sense to launch it on Steam only after that's in.
---
great question.  I honestly cant describe it well, but  its not that i haven't tried other games...played about 8 this year, and they all end (they were fun, but not re-playable). I think its a paradox.  we all want an end-game, and keep searching for it, but the credits never roll.  I dont really want it to end, and I keep logging in and finding chores/stuff to do...it is peaceful, in that i know the game, and can really try anything i want. its a huge map, and a detailed crafting/loot system.  I found a great meat hook, and am considering a respec. for melee.  Got a great idea for a new CAMP...(oh, and always hoping for "god-rolls").... it just keeps pulling me in.
---
An independent thought, none the less. Have a thumb.
---
Yeah that seems like the only one. 
---
It comes with postcards and coasters. 
---
The VDSG (reg. hardcover) doesn’t have anything other then a map
---
Or less colliding issues when trying to place the crops. 
---
Floating grain kills immersion at the same rate as headless ghoul models.
---
Just give us also the ability to merge our camp with already existing world structures by tweeking the whole colliding issue and make snapping pieces optional.
---
&lt;serious sam suicider yell increases in proximity&gt;

I'am shure it will still use the Bethesda launcher. Same as you need an Ubisoft account and still the Ubisoft launcher if you buy an Anno Game from steam. Therefore it should be possible to use the same account. But then, why the fuck would you shove up even more money into Bethesda ass if you already have the game? You can't get rid of the Bethesda launcher...
---
pls fix the performance on ps4 
---
is all im asking now
---
What's so good about being lvl 350??
---
I'm only lvl 91 and would be just as strong ingame as you.
---
Is it tho
---
FEV spiders.
---
Agreed but then folks are just going to bitch about what wasn't in it that they were told would be, like last weeks half patch.
---
Really it shouldn't matter, they need to build up some goodwill again and roll out updates without issues or introducing new issues \[or at least nothing crazy\] and get their dev and QA process down to a solid level of quality.  
---
I think everyone would prefer a 10 fix patch that worked than a 15 fix patch that borked a bunch of stuff as it was rushed etc
---
Less people means more attention to you but the usual intensive places are still intensive as usual. It’s no silver bullet but it slightly helps
---
&gt; It's mostly the little things that cause problems, like Mole Rats, Stingwings, Mirelurk Spawn, etc. They have a tendency to bite your ankles randomly and cause a stagger that blows your cover.

The EU has multiple laws like that and they don't care about eula saying you can't sue us. Doesn't work that way in the EU.
---
Or even who classes of weapons like Laser :) It'll be intriguing to see what wastelanders does and doesn't do. But i'm hoping with bringing in new Plasma and Gauss weapons they'll be taking a good swipe at alot of those issues
---
Doing a silo with good gear is a infinitely better experience the grinding through with just-hit-50-gear. As others said - take your time - don’t rush it
---
Official content hasn't increased much, but I keep getting ideas for new camp builds from other people and there's still a lot of stuff I haven't fully explored (power armor modding and nuking every place possible). Private worlds have changed a lot since I can now experience everything without other people changing the experience, and I can build in workshops as much as I want without having to waste time fighting over them.
---
That's probably not enough for someone who would have more fun playing another game... but I like this IP and I get bored really easily with other games just because their lore doesn't appeal to me. For me even a terrible fallout game is better than a good game about swords and castles or space stuff.
---
if it was possible, i'd give you 100 perk changes...I only swap maybe once every 10 lvls.
---
You mean to tell us your game of kick-the-can fissiled out?
---
I got the game for free and as someone whose been playing since FO3 i enjoy it sometimes. I was playing it everyday for a while but got burned out with nothing to do.. I'm just a filthy casual tho.
---
inb4 OP gets banned
---
I got lucky I got mine either the first time I did encrypted or I got it from the quest before you can do encrypted. Didn't realize it was a rare drop.
---
I keep playing cause it's how I unwind after work, meeting/helping people, and it's fun for my husband and me to be on a team!  We see the things that are bad and will gripe to each other.  But as long time fallout fans, all of the games had issues.....it's the Bethesda way.  Gotta love it, lumps and all.
---
Not when they add the planned legendary status you won't be. Also I've had more time to assemble obscenely strong armour and weapons to suit my play style and perks. So you may be just as strong but maybe not.
---
The same as releasing Blades on PC/consoles, no chance
---
What's low carry weight? I'm about 330 with a full stealth commando build, about 450 in power armor. Could improve it a bit swapping around some armor pieces outside power armor, I was at 375 before and changed some armor pieces which gave up some carry capacity.
---
Imagine shotguns killing enemies. A man can dream...
---
What do you see them listed for? I'd say 10 caps max.
---
I used to farm Disease Cures a lot, after 30ish minutes I could leave the forest with like 100+
---
Green Thumb + Chemist + Super Duper
---
Oh, and what antivirus are you using, what measures do you use to protect your PC
---
Whenever these things get requested, I find myself asking “Please, Bethesda, at least just give us a shittier-looking version of this before you start selling Atom Shop skins.”
---
Like the non-decaying Armor condition.
---
Booooo. 😂
---
RW only applies to the base model, once you change the parts, they add in their full weight.
---
Been this way since the start of the game.
---
That's the only difference "Armour"
---
At lvl 75 I would have all the same perk cards and collected good weapons.
---
The only difference would be who had the better armour.
---
The 90% RW is bugged, it only applies to the base weapon. Not to the additional weight of receivers/stock/etc.
---
I've never done a silo run so I'd have to put the cards on, I do have them all inc hacker but just can't be bothered because I'm lazy and just hate that dark lock picking mini game screen and solving the terminals 😑
---
Same, I hope to find it some day
---
Interesting idea. ... I still wouldn't do it... but an interesting idea, my husband used to hold extra junk componet for me.....but I would forget and go junking for more, lol.
---
Reality is often disappointing (Thanos voice) :)
---
Let's leave my ex out of this.
---
I'm actually hitting myself now for not knowing that by this stage, so what the F\*\*K is the point in that legendary effect if it destrots the abilty to enjoy modifying the weapon, dumb dumb dumb
---
That perk can be a blessing or trash.
---
90% reduced weight affects the initial weight of the weapon, not the mods. So adding multiple mods like most range weapons need, basically the weapon ends up only slightly lighter.
---
However it works well on heavy weapons which only require maybe 1 mod. A heavy weapon will normally weigh like 25 when modded, and with 90% weight, it's like 5. But a shotgun could be 18 normal and hen 14 with the 90%. Kind of stupid.
---
Did you pass the damage threshold on SBQ?
---
The refunds that will explode is what happen
---
Yeah I am pressing it. So on my Xbox when I press Y to search it will either pop the item up or shortly after I look away, while on PS4 when I look it will just go away after I press search like the Xbox but it never finds an item. I tried doing the open inventory, then backing out and holding and or pressing triangle on PS4 which made it work once in a while but it was still to inconsistent to be worth the trouble.
---
I think he's wrong.
---
That might work if you're a tiny developer with limited resources.  But if you're a multi-billion dollar company with an actual PR department, you can afford to talk.  It is better to offer an earnest, honest appraisal of what's happening rather than go silent.  Silence makes you look arrogant and aloof.
---
I haven't had an issue with the ending myself. Did it about 6 times the past week and the Wendigo appeared. I'm on PS4.
---
I'm really cross and will go and make a scary face at the first kitten I come across, hope Bethesda are suitably embarrassed.
---
Bloody annoying but then I still have a shotgun weighing about 6 lbs less I suppose. Thanks for the info.
---
I sell all my maps for like 15-25 caps tops. Usually not much to be had which is why you cant sell them for much.
---
You should be used to dealing with children with nothing better to do than grief. After all you deal with Bethesda all the time.
---
Not sure it’ll help but I think prime receivers DO benefit from the 90%RW. Worth checking out next time you’re at a workbench 👍
---
sadly your optimism is probably verging on insanity at this point :D
---
Or laser beams glittering across the landscape as an entire weapon class is made viable again.... :O
---
Thanks for that, i'll go check that out, I do know it's a one way street and the Prime receiver cannot be removed unless I've got that one wrong too.
---
Raidy McRaidface
---
Spend first a good amount of Atoms and then they will see...
---
Bethesda sucks, thats common sence
---
Why would you ask here on Reddit? Is this an official channel to Bethesda support?
---
You can remove prime receivers too 👍
---
Good to know, very helpful, cheers!
---
No worries!
---
You missed the part where I said "what has already been completed." Competent developers know how to properly release patches.
---
I understand that sometimes a last-minute change or test causes things to have to be reshuffled, but you can be open and transparent about that (as they already were about the PA glitch). People will complain but more information is always better than less. 
---
"Hey guys, this week our patch will include XXX and XXX, and we're looking at XXX improvements for the next few patches." That's all you need to say as a preview, and anything else is gravy.
---
maybe they removed all of them, I haven't made a new character to check
---
Get it TODAY for only 5000 Atoms!
---
there are long bugreports after every patch. 
---
I played the game also from oct 18 until about august 19. Yes it got better. Unfortunately for every tiny step it gets better, if gets worse in monetization. For me the only good content post launch was delivered in Wild appalachia. So for me this game stalls and gets worse since this spring. And now more and more new features get behind a paywall.
---
So, if you enjoy the game, i sincerely hope you continue to have fun. Just watch, that Bethesda does not empty your wallet. Otherwise if you are just a company shill i hope you earn enough money.
---
I've seen this a few times and I'm not sure why any company would ever keep something awesome secret. "Let's not tell anyone about this thing we've put tons of work into."
---
I agree entirely but would go one step further and I would say it should be a passive ability once you get all three lockpick/hacking cards, as that would also kill the need to keep equipping and un-equipping the damn things.
---
Its like your character has amnesia and then suddenly remembers how to use a skill...
---
AFAIK, yes.
---
The optimist in me believes Bethesda will turn fo76 in the best possible version it can be, the pessimist fears this is true.
---
If you buy for 17.5k, and you sell 2 a day to robot vendors for 500c each (with hard bargain 3 and grape mentats), you'll have your money back in 18 days. Less if you have multiple characters selling them to the vendors.
---
And you can keep your personal vendor stocked too to make bonus caps.
---
my man EA has been getting its act together while beth is becoming worse and worse. at this point I'd say beth is worse than EA
---
lets see patch 15 tho, 10 mins left now
---
I thought I had, was hitting it the whole time the event was going but wasn't looking at the numbers as much. But if I didn't, then that part is alright and at least understandable, but there should be some sort of indication at least for if it's pointless or not to even keep hitting it!
---
66% downvote. Its true, this forum has only wales and shills left...
---
This isn't possible for some players
---
I just don't see the appeal of private servers. The best part(s) of this game involve playing with other people. Events, player vending, etc.
---
The only real complaints are the pvp at workshops and people 1 shotting legendaries.  The workshops don't have to be taken and there are plenty of legendaries out there.
---
Again I don't think there is enough bang for your buck buying FO1ST.

It would really be handy in the raid.

I'm at work, I likely won't get to it to this night. But really, it's not pay to win, it's pay to play. It's crazy how some people will drop $100~ plus for a set of armor, and much more for guns. Might as well put it in the atom shop.

It is bad, and it's frustrating to deal with. The atom shop is cosmetic (mostly) and not necessary at all.

Been playing since beta on Xbox, never had any issues anywhere close to this bad.

I kept a private server going for 3 days without crashing... claimed a bunch of workshops and didn't have to rebuild everything. Public servers have never lasted close to even 24 hours for me.
---
Doesn't speak to performance per se, but I can say that server stability is much, much more reliable.
---
it could be due to the patch in a few minutes. Also, have you applied all patches since you last played?
---
It's gonna be maintenance in about 7min, maybe that has something to do with it?
---
I read today that there are some issues running the game on windows 95. Can’t confirm personally though as I play on console.
---
...which would be an advantage? Anyway not really sure why you're put out that I wouldn't wanna start the entire game all over again but I CBA arguing over it. Like it or not a level 350 usually has access to a lot more higher end items. Just getting all the shielded underarmours and all the serums can take hundreds of hours and levels.
---
&gt; I don't necessarily care if people want to *throw their money away*, not my problem 
---
You agenda is clear though.
---
Drink a beer of some type and eat a sweetroll too.
---
Whats your personal experiences with freezing or crashing?
---
The maintenance starts 10am et. And sometimes they close the server a little sooner.
---
Ah ffs. Thanks for the info!
---
I stopped playing after the f\*\*kyou1st announcement, and they still haven't fixed this? lmao.

I ain't no yokel friend

---
yep, lets see the patch! im cautiously optimistic.
---
Do you wander over yonder?
---
It was uninstalled back then half a year ago (Cannot really spare 75 gigs on my SSD since I do play or try out A LOT of games really), so I have installed it once, started installing after the maintenance was over and people have logged back in to play, to make sure I get the right patch.
---
Yea or a perk that allows armor penetration like there is for every other weapon type
---
Just to check, I went and made a character in less than 5 min. Not a single issue, freeze, or blue screen. 
---
I’m calling b.s.
---
Also on PS4.
---
differentiate the camp would be nice; some camp being farm, market, restaurant, or anything.  And camp display on the map needs to support it for other players to recognize it.
---
If they don’t fix it, I’ll just go die or something. How’s that for optimism? 😂
---
Fallout 1st is pretty on par with a $8/month subscription bro. U get private server and some atoms with some emotes or whateves. $8 to use their servers for you by yourself is just like hosting a small 10-15 player Minecraft world. It’s not pay to win, because even if you’re in your own world you still have to do all the work of getting stuff done. You just don’t have the occasional griefer that causes u 5 mins of spite.
---
Is there a meme about windows 95? Haven't heard that, but using windows 7 myself, same as it was when I played half a year ago. Should be supported by the game I think.
---
"Funny" when the player is +300, and he/she is obviously enjoying the game :/ Why not support it?
---
How about griefing the players that stole from the f\*cking dev room, and keep dublicating stuff. They're the once ruining the game imo!
---
Well, I envy you :)
---
I think the only prime you cant remove is the crossbow. That's only because there isn't a plan for the standard receiver. That's my understanding, at least. 🤷‍♂️
---
I didn't - i think what we've seen is their developers have done fixes that have legitimately resolved issues, they've done some that have but then also introduced other issues, we've seen that however their dev cycle merges in these code fixes nuke others implemented previously.
---
So while i agree they should be able to release a patches notes ahead of time, and that competent developers should be able to properly release them. I don't think we've seen that in spades in the last year as a result of other systemic problems with their system, they might think they've fixed something but invariably they haven't. Hence my comment about building up goodwill - they're at rock bottom right now and they need to get to where you're saying they should be - but there's a journey there and they're not going to get there right away.  
---
Perhaps because they were working on too much XXX content instead of the real issues :P
---
But in all seriousness, i'd say the easiest way of doing that is saying - "we're going to fix X chunk of issues", and when that patch rolls out they're fixed, they're solid and you've not borked anything else. Then after introducing that level of quality, stability and engendered trust in your customer base over several cycles, then you can absolutely be more laissez faire attitude to it as you then can bank on people knowing your going to do right by them, and you do, and that gives you more freedom to focus on what you need to get done rather than being horrifically reactive.
---
Thats why this last month or so, since ive started to be really vocal, ive tried to make sure i add things like "in my personal experience" or "from what ive noticed". 
---
That way, when i eventually get bashed for it, i can say that its just my experience on my xbox. 
---
Im weary of fallout 1st. Im weary of wastelanders. Ill still play it. And truth be told, ill probably wind up getting falllout first. 
---
Ive personally decided that after 20 years playing fallout, if wastelanders drops for free like they promised, ill but the 1st subscription. If they hide ANYTHING of wastelanders behind a pay wall, im deleting the game and walking away.
---
I like to use nuke mines to kill players, some dude dropped 300 pounds of loot once!
---
So I’ve never seen this before. People put nuke mines near you and shoot them, which then kills you from the radiation? Do Nuka grenades and the gamma gun do that as well?
---
Others have said it before but to break it down: Every time you loot something in the open world (that means not from a dead enemy) that item gets put on a blacklist. That list holds 180 entries. Every time a new item gets added, the "oldest" item on that list gets removed. If an item is blacklisted it cannot be looted by you (even if you change servers) but it can be looted by others.
---
So if you farm something, lead for example, you cannot loot a specific place over and over again. Instead you have to create a farming route and loot multiple places. You can of course also loot stuff you don't need on the way, just to clear the list faster.
---
It runs way better than public, i have yet to crash on private and seems like everytime i go on public it ends up crashing. Worth the money to be able to start something and finish it.
---
I’ve been in 3 times with exactly the same clothing and perks and had 17500, 18200 and 18800. Very random
---
Correction of myself: Not "after" the maintenance apparently, I just thought it was over. I made sure to only install the game once to get the right patch and all the patches, and since a lot of people have been playing on servers, I thought it was AFTER the patch already. The whole testing was done by me 4 hours ago. It was \~14:00 here so I thought maintenance was over already. Apparently I was wrong.
---
Price depends of your charisma that is capped at 25 (datamined info) which gives the price 17500. When you had higher price means you have lower charisma in that moment.
---
That'd be mighty fine
---
Exactly and it was the same on each visit
---
i disagree with checkpoints, DITW on a bad expert run takes 20 minutes. why would something that short need a checkpoint? especially for what is supposed to be hard team based content.
---
rejoin il give to you, sucks when 1 person crashes out. the halfway room would make a good spot  to open rejoining since the timer pauses and you can wait for tbem to load in there.
---
On occasion but that's besides the point
---
If you do end up getting one, yes, probably my favourite gimmick as you can heal people at any range assuming you're accurate enough, you can still find them usually for trade for bloodied explosives or sometimes large amounts of caps if you're both lucky and patient.
---
I'm not put out, I was just pointing out.
---
That it wouldn't take you a year to get back to where you are now, because at lvl 91 I am just as strong and with the same armour I could kick your lvl 350 arse.
---
That is all.
---
Most challenges can be completed in an hour or less. Killing glowing enemy during radstorm, take a nude picture of yourself and others are the exceptions.
---
Well at least we can figure out creating a character works just fine for you on your PS4. That's good, but I'll have to wait until it gets better I suppose.  
---
I have two characters over lvl 100, so the game did work for me, sometimes better, sometimes worse, but in the end glitches and bugs were mostly the things that made me quit. And, I guess, won't let me in again.
---
there is no winning in this game...only better gear which you cant buy in game...some people buy stuff on eBay, but thats not BGS forcing them.  As far as 1st goes, at least you get like 1600 atoms/month for cosmetic stuff/unlimited scrap/mobile tent and your own private instance of the game which i use to troll for legendaries and search for rare stuff like the red asylum uniform...totally worth it for me.
---
I really dont understand the anger either... it must be that they cant afford the private servers (and they want them), but really...its a lot cheaper than buying a new game which is what i used to do once a month or so...
---
why trash people who like the option...just quit, or do the math...you may save money from buying other games.
---
Lots of people are just immature.  I like this discussion well stated.
---
Damn, this is a great idea!
---
Just a PSA if you're on xbox the community has started making LFG posts to let people use their private servers for stuff like this. 
---
It's a band-aid, not a fix, but if you're on xbox (and I assume PS has something similar) there is an easy enough way to do it.
---
I feel like I could get into that. Out of curiosity, do you level separate characters for different builds or keep leveling and shuffle points around?
---
Well hopefully that means extra time to stress test Wastelanders as well so its not a bug ridden mess on release that also brings back many previously fixed bugs
---
They'll probably label it as a "utility or convenience item" to justify it as well. Fucking Bethesda has gone the crapper. What happened to the days where people would riot if a dev even thought about adding in non cosmetic mtx...
---
Do you know what is a Hard Raid? Play Destiny... Has checkpoints... This raid is a race against the clock it is super stupid... My Team just stops playing once they die in the last segment... Ammo and aid waste because there are no checkpoints... Its not fun nor Hard
---
The number of times I have to take back the ammunition factory in a day from high levels made me wanna shoot myself in the foot. But luckily I have a group I am with to back me up so we can re take the factory
---
Yeah I've got Fallout 1st myself, but the servers seem to be worse than public ones most of the time for me. Tried the other day and the game just froze every time I entered the vault.
---
did you have the blight?  that's usually the thing that messes me over on price.  every time its over 17,500 i look at my status and yep ive got the blight.  plaguewalker problems
---
Btw if you can do it on expert on Hard in 15 mins please add me... My Team cant complete the standard and dont want to play ráids as ir is ammo waste
---
After adding mods, is it the same shotgun or a new version? 
---
The gun has weight reduction, the mods aren't legendary and retained their weight. 
---
In the metaphysics of identity, the ship of Theseus is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object.
---
Alternatively - My grandfather had a wonderful axe that he handed down to my father. At some point, my father had to replace the handle, which he did with an exact replica (same type of wood and everything). I inherited the axe, and recently I had to replace the axe blade (which I did with an exact replica).
---
Now nothing of the original axe remains. Is is really my grandfather’s axe? What I now hold in my hand has been “the family axe” since my grandfather bought it.
---
No diseases at the time, except my confusion if that qualifies
---
Camps are the thinks that keep me here
---
Beth isnt selling this stuff...people are, and its already been acquired by somebody playing, so no influx of high end gear.  If they did put high end gear in the ATOM shop, then i would totally agree it pay to win, and i would quit.
---
lol you couldn't even try. You completely avoided my point about legendary players coming too. Really not sure why you're so hung up on being a lower level and proving something. Everybody has to be a level 91 before they are 100 or 200. You'll get there in the end and have all the high end items too.
---
Yeah I mash the hell out of wet kindling to get bug spawns. I may as well farm up some glowing meat from the glowing insect varieties while doing the event.
---
I keep playing because I am hopeful for wastelands. In the meantime I’m just trying to collect every different type of the asylum outfit and collecting all the plans I can find. I also do the challenges everyday (because why not) so hopefully I’ll have enough to buy the Christmas bundle when it comes out. I too had a 3 month break because I couldn’t find things to do - just think about things you would like to collect and go from there. x
---
Imagine if it was wastelanders XD
---
Enough is enough. Stop shilling and hold companies responsible for their constant lying and cash grab strategies.
---
That’s a big ass vagina behind you.
---
Commando builds usually are focused on perception and agility with a little bit on luck for mutation so some are only taking 2 points for strength for bandolier.
---
Do you have the high-capacity standard backpack? I'm having a hard time farming for possum badge, I only have 3 after farming the camp quest for more than 20 times already.
---
For power armor, I'm still lacking for plans or mods for my excavators and X-01 power armors.
---
Try telling fanboys that...they will eat you alive lol
---
Like I said before, it seems to happen pretty much every time I open menus - the map, my stash, vendors...
---
Because they might not want to mention anything until they are 100% sure it will work, especially with the backlash after the Wastelanders delay.
---
I haven't seen any patch notes yet.
---
I just want my 3* raider chest piece to go under outfits again.
---
Every region except forest can drop PA plans
---
Toxic Valley: Raider PA, T-45
---
Ash Heap: Raider PA, T-45, T-51
---
Savage Divide: Raider PA, T-45, T-51 
---
Mire: T-45, T-51, T-60
---
Bog: T-45, T-51, T-60
---
The distant thunder event also has a small chance to drop T-51 and T-60 pieces
---
As you can tell, T-51 is the easiest one.
---
Good luck!
---
Surprise new feature: Now it can take up to 20 tries before you can fast travel. Enjoy the wait wastelanders.
---
What the hell are you talking about? That's been a heavily request thing! Get out of here Todd!
---
Patch notes will be posted on here soon. Nobody knows anything yet.
---
Imagine if it was wastelanders
---
Im neither a whale nor a shill, and im assuming you aren't either.  good people on here, and some bad...just like life.
---
Man, I hate that there's two good builds (commando and heavy gunner) and the rest is subpar compared to those.
---
At first I used a Guerrilla build and I loved it, even managed to win in PvP. But it was so trash in PvE.
---
This would be great for Nuclear Winter too.
---
Disconnected - 100% damage increase for 60 minutes after being disconnected from server
---
Shotguns have been crippled. Bethesda doesn’t want people to buy shotgun skins, plain and simple.
---
Platform?
---
Change appearance&gt;Face&gt;highlight iaw&gt;Press X/Square.
---
seems a bit op, everyone getting a huge bonus
---
On PS4 it has been much smoother.
---
Another patch, another bug list!

***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
A few more yet-unfixed bugs/oversights that I am revisiting just in case they were forgotten:
---
* All Protest Signs still incorrectly benefit from 1-handed weapon perks/bonuses instead of 2-handed weapon perks/bonuses because they have the WeaponTypeMelee1H keyword instead of the WeaponTypeMelee2H keyword
---
* Anglers incorrectly count as Cryptids for the purposes of challenges, this is because they have the ActorTypeCryptid keyword
---
* Nuclear Winter - The Scoped Lever Action Rifle has a suppressor but does not have silenced shots
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Vault 94 - Strangler Power Armor can be given to other players by dropping the chassis from your inventory (not deploying)
---
* Challenge - When daily challenges reset, playing Nuclear Winter before playing Adventure mode will cause some/all daily challenges to be completed without awarding atoms
---
* Challenge - 'Scrap the bones of a Skeleton' sub-challenge, 'Scrap a Skull' completes when you pick up a skull, not when you scrap it, because it has a condition set to check 'Items Acquired' rather than 'Items Scrapped'
---
* Atomic Shop - 3D Glasses, Eye Boggle Glasses, and Mothman Glasses cannot be worn with hats because they all occupy Slot 46 (Headband)
---
* Atomic Shop - Pint-Sized Slasher Mask is missing the ClothingTypeMask keyword, and thus does not count for any mask related challenges
---
* Atomic Shop - [The Halloween Plushie Cat is missing the hair seen in its preview images,](https://imgur.com/a/2TL2s9s) these can even be seen outlined (but invisible) in the CAMP building menu
---
* Nuclear Winter - Playing Nuclear Winter untracks all non-Nuclear Winter challenges
---
* Nuclear Winter - The "Nukes Launched" XP bonus is awarded when the nuke lands, not when it is launched, meaning if you die before it lands you do not get credit for it
---
* Private Worlds - Nuking an area on a Private World causes all mutated creatures in the nuke zone to spawn dead, and you must wait for an entire respawn cycle before you can farm them
---
* Quest - Mayor for a Day - Scott Turner's corpse contains over [100 copies of the Robco Research Facility Keycard,](https://imgur.com/a/yT8zH3E) and the safe has over 100 copies of the Saboteur's Work Password (both persist even after completing the quest)
---
* Many locations in the southern Cranberry Bog [do not correctly appear on the compass,](https://imgur.com/a/0S9zcWC) including, but not limited to: Survey Camp Alpha, Sunrise Field and the nearby Fissure Site
---
* The Meat Hook weapon incorrectly has the WeaponTypeMelee1H keyword, meaning it incorrectly benefits from both Unarmed perks/bonuses, as well as 1-Handed perks/bonuses
---
* Mischief Night - Learning any Jack O'Lantern plan will say that you unlocked 'Classic Jack O'Lantern' regardless of what name is on the plan. You still learn the correct plan, but the 'Item Unlocked' message is wrong because the [HUDName is wrong for each Constructible Object](https://imgur.com/a/HxEAScE)
---
* Several load screen tips are outdated, such as the one that says murdering other players can get you a wanted status (there is no mechanism to murder anymore), or the one describing how serums boost your mutation strength (they only block negatives, they don't boost positives)
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Atomic Shop - Icons should not be automatically set as your chosen icon when they are purchased, especially since free icons are frequently given out
---
* Nuclear Winter - Disable the pop-up social menu when activating player map pips in Nuclear Winter, as this pop-up makes firing nukes and placing markers difficult while you have enemies revealed
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Nuclear Winter - Add a perk that reduces the bonus damage taken from headshots, as the correct perks with just a Scoped Hunting Rifle (which is a very common drop) can oneshot you even while wearing the highest tiers of armor
---
* Reduce the weight of 'Bubblegum' from .25 to .1 to match the weight of Perk Bubblegum, or (better yet) lower all Bubblegum weights across the board
---
* Nuclear Winter - Make magazine **effects** visible in the Favorites menu, currently it only displays the magazine name which makes it hard to know which effect you have
---
Cheers!
---
That is harsh! 😄 invite me next year!
---
Love this! Especially glowing and glutton!
---
I saw a while ago someone talking about adding a counterpart to nocturnal stuffs. So damage would increase during the day and decrease during the night or whatever
---
Why do anyone want to do a shotgun build. It’s about as powerful as a rolling pin and you need plastic to make the ammo. It’s been nerfed to garbage status.
---
I would walk you through the silo but I'm on PC. My advice is to just try it. It's actually not that hard (esp. not the enemies) and if you run a decent stealth sniper build you should be able to kill most of them with one or two shots. Just watch a walktrhoug video or sth. so you know what to expect and what equipment to bring (steel and circutry for example)
---
Shadewalker, Dripping, Burrower would be cool NW perk cards too.
---
Welcome confirmation that hipsters don’t make it through the apocalypse is my take away XD lol
---
&gt;I like the AA LMG. has worked well for most anything. 
---
I rarely get find legendary LMG and handmade guns, most of what I found on drops, mole vendor, and player vendors have little use effect for me. I found a few with good effects but are not maxed levels. Some from player vending machines but the price are too high for what I have those time.
---
 
---
&gt;These perks will help:  
---
&gt;Str: bear arms (cuts heavy weapon weight). Bandolier (reduced ammo weight).
---
I'll definitely get those with the other 3 heavy gun perks
---
&gt; Acid extractor produces 10. So while it helps, I usually get more acid from wendigo teeth, waste acid jars, antifreeze, coolant caps, etc. than the extractor makes. 
---
That low? Well, I keep on picking junks with acid so I think this would greatly help me in sustaining my ammo needs.
---
I know right. 
---
They could avoid so much drama and still make money.
---
Melee and/or unarmed is good too. Guerilla ist just a weaker commando build basically. As a stealth commando I use a supressed 10mm auto pistol as a sidearm works ok for PvE never tried pvp with that.
---
I am presenting a fact. At the time that people were claiming that private servers were not private the fact that loot piles preexisted on the server was a key point supporting the argument.
---
Address the fact and not me please. I really don't give a shit what you personally think of me.
---
lol you actually bought it? you must be a flute, cause they played you good
---
What damage numbers show? If there are a bunch of melee players doing 5 to 10k per whack,  small bullet damage won't register enough
---
nope jetpacks shotguns 250dr etc many prominent bugs are still there
---
Must be the patch notes.
---
I'll touch it :D Kind of ironic to call someone who purchased fallout 76 ungrateful, in light of recent Bethesda's recent monetization strategies, don't you think?
---
No probs. You'll be legendary too when it comes out because I think it's every 50 levels or something.
---
I've been told your equipped carry weight has a large influence on your ability to be detected while sneak walking. Do you know if that's true? 
---
Also, do you have a source for the info about chameleon increasing your sneak? I've seen a lot of people mention it before but I've never seen proof.
---
Ah yes but at least we got fucked 1st.
---
PS4- at the top as post flair .
---
&gt;Exploit: Addressed an exploit that could allow non-scrap items to be transferred into the Scrapbox.
---
RIP Vegatable stashing
---
Hey, more lighting fixes!
---
I’d be happy to bring you along if I can get something together
---
Well, as far as I see nothing crucial is getting fixed with this patch... Again.
---
What is this supposed to say?
---
No visual fix for the Mr.Fuzzy plushie that you can place in your camp? The icon and hitbox show a purple hair but when placed no hair is present.
---
you ok?
---
Sounds like something run through a Chinese to English text translator... makes no sense.
---
Don't blame yourself. I seriously doubt the way it functions was the perk functioning as intended. It probably only functions the way it does because the entire game is a mess.
---
ah, ok...im not stealth...thought it was mostly sneaking which is kinda hard in the silo...
---
I like Alpha simply b/c its just a small structure with the elevator...dont need to fight off ghouls to get in like the others...internally they are all identical.
---
Or fast travel, or event death unable to respawn, and on and on
---
Either 95% bad luck on the 40% prox or a bug, either way it really sucks as it's one of my favorite perks and it should be working as intended with just the single button prompt after the initial search. It's one of my favorite perks as hearing the little ding sound and finding extra meds is amazing, I like to randomly give them to people when I see them.
---
Ha, I laughed
---
Do you smell burning feathers? Should we call for help?
---
Great intention, poor execution.
---
*Morgan Freeman Voice*  
---
And on that day punctuation died just a little more.  
---

---
I once started a claim on the food plant that makes radioactive free food, can't remember the name, and some lvl 230 came in from no where, one shot'd me, then left the area. Didn't claim it, just killed me and left so I didn't claim it.
---
Yeah, replies from other like minded Reddit users. I guess if it is just about the feels and nurturing the mindset...
---
What's the next outcome .. dissatisfaction that Bethesda didn't do what you asked via a post on Reddit? 
---
Oh wait...Reddit culture.
---
So still no:
---
\- Strangler Heart / DoT effect crash fix
---
\- Fix for the "Damage Bug" where ranged weapons are useless until you relog
---
\- Fix for PvP invincibility bug after being hit by energy weapons repeatedly
---
\- 250DR when reloading fix
---
\- Crash when using an Aid item
---
\- Meat Hook double dipping into melee/unarmed perks
---
\- Plasma Flamer barrel using Rifleman instead of Commando perks
---
So nada new..in my head I knew there wouldn't be anything new, but in my heart I was foolish enough to believe.
---
Just put your junk away. I lost so many bags that I learned to just store your junk. Then it’s funny they went through all that trouble to get a bone shard.. I once spawned in to white springs station and it was nuked and my mule died holding 1k flux that someone promptly picked up. It’s a murder game not koombayaa
---
My executioner faster fire Gatling plasma with reduced weight weighs less than two pounds. Don't mod it, that's all. 
---
It is useful in some cases, not so much when it is a combat knife.
---
I said with all the right parts, that includes food, chem, and perk buffs. 
---
I just found the last armor pieces I needed for the one-swing sb queen kill. Next is some patience and practice.
---
*What the hell happened here?*
---
So its somehow bull because it works for you? What an interesting position to take.
---
I think the title would be written something like this if the OP was not under the influence of powerful hallucinogens.
---
"We all know that Bethesda breaks at least as many things as it fixes every single patch. Let's place a friendly bet around the phenomenon."
---
My favourite thing:  
---
* **Nuke Silos:** Door buttons for storage room exits no longer appear to float in front of the wall in Nuke Silos.
---
Hallelujah!
---
Thanks! That's exactly right, I've spent my money. I even topped up atoms in the early months.
---
Bethesda are the ungrateful ones. We should be getting loads free in that stupid atom shop, scrapvoxes for all, and tons more.
---
But nope, we get radio silence and garbage bug fixes.
---
How ungrateful if me not say ThAnKs BeThEsDa!!
---
I wish I had a BE lever, lol.
---
I can see buying a month, just to see what it's all about, for the Atoms and for the Outfit. But anything beyond that, I don't understand.
---
2020.
---
thanks for this, I bought the year on console, so I'm assuming the little 1st Icon will change colour when my year runs out.
---
yes with bells on, locks are so tedious
---
They said it would be a thing next year
---
Thank you for changing the launch theme music, as well as all these fixes.
---
Sucks your PS4. Id happily have ran through a few with you. If anyone is Xbox and having the same problem GT is BigBaconBites add me.
---
Out of curiousity on PS4 (maybe someone else can chime in here) have you guys not got teams/groups who run nukes? I know we do on Xbox they're quite friendly. Just if you do have 1 of these groups try and hunt one of the players down. They would probably happily help you as they usually do queen's back to back all day.
---
Id just message the next high level you see drop a nuke on a server, say you have your cards and clearance etc. Your ready to go and just need help running the silo.
---
Like perk card loadouts? I wish we had it.
---
&gt; Eyewear: Glasses purchased from the Atomic Shop, such as Gag Glasses, can now correctly be worn with hats.
---
finally i can use my 3d glasses with a hat
---
&gt; Armor: Fixed an issue that prevented Armor from taking condition damage
---
Drats. I was enjoying my vacation from armor damage.
---
Yes
---
Come on, guys! Give him a break, there's just one guy working on the game.
---
Hey kids! Got a fun game to play with this hack of a developer! 
---
1. CTRL + F
---
2. type "atom", "Fallout 1st " and "scrapbox"
---
3. then type "250 DR", "shotgun", "item drop rate", "jetpack", "challenge", "crash", "freeze", "lag" and "hacker", you can also select other words from that hefty bug list a friend of ours posts every single fucking time when they patch this game! 
---
4. item with the most results wins!
---
Have fun kids! and again, welcome to the circus! 🤡
---
I am disturbed at how I was able to read this, question it’s coherency, read it again, and somehow make sense of what you were trying to say:
---
We all know that Bethesda messes up at least as much as it fixes every single patch. Let’s place a friendly bet around the phenomenon.
---
There was one reward gun that was that way already.
---
alright i get that. just watch out for that yao guai ;)
---
I've never heard carry weight having any effect on sneak. About chameleon armor, a youtuber called CaptainNoob has done a couple of videos sneaking with full chameleon armor, and he explains that he is almost never detected.
---
I probably experienced less than 3% of this list.....soo good patch.
---
At the minimum, give us some new miniquest for the remaining wall mounts, why even show us their previews for months now and not have them ingame?
---
"neutral negative ludicrously negative" has me really excited! Beth knows we've been asking for this and is finally delivering!
---
Less than a thousand hours is pretty vague, and also makes it seems like it's still close to a thousand. That many Atoms in a thousand hours, seems like Atoms ARE hard to get.
---
Agree im stealth commando and can stealth it. I know up until the last update your stealth was effected by your team so if they weren't sneaking, there was no point in you sneaking. However it seems to be patched and I just permanently sit at a 'caution' in the silo now, or my team has gotten better at hiding! 😂
---
Damn I was hoping you had datamined info. Thanks for the response though.
---
Yeah, that's what I think. I mean, the Ranger Armor, Atoms every month, Private Servers and the Survival Tent should be enough. The scrapbox is just too good of a feature to keep behind a paywall - and that's probably why they did it.
---
🤣
---
No kidding. How about the insane rarity of plasma grenade plans?
---
PS4 going by original tags on post.
---
I don’t have those numbers but I’ve been meaning to see if it’s possible to turn on PS4.  It’s an explosive mini gun(best weapon I have lol). So pretty much wasting my time trying ,because I gave it every I had Lol
---
I ran afoul of the reddit forum rules but I basically had a for-profit version of this sort of concept a few days ago. Basically instead of just storing their materials I would pay them for all of their stuff and sell a bunch of materials at cheap prices in my vending machine and whatever does not sell bulk and offload to vendor bots.
---
My post was deleted which is fair, it goes against the trading post rules on this forum.
---
With scrapbox I think the need to offload junk has diminished for most players. It seems a large percentage are subscribers now. 
---
That said my shop when I was running would sometimes sell bundles of materials at my prices, depends of someone comes along and they are missing a certain component. I sold a bundle of springs and screws at 2 caps, my meager supply of ballistic fiber at 5, a bunch of bulk acid at what I thought was a pricy 15 caps.
---
I personally think there is a niche for junk vending and cheap supplies, few vendors even bother selling supplies and when they do the prices are high (like 30 per chem being the lowend). 
---
I will probably try again on the flea market forum once I clean up my pitch. I was so dejected I started a new character and am playing solo on private worlds, but will probably open a hardware store soon.
---
I do think some characters could use a place to generate caps, I have tagged along with a couple players over the weekend who are trying to save up to buy certain plans or legendaries from player vending machines, but are at the point in the game (like me) where caps do not come easily.
---
When I told one player that I was adventuring with that I actually will buy anything he does not want because My vendor bot cap just cycled he was shocked that I bought 1500 caps worth of junks/stims/radaway/radx from him (dropped his stash weight a ton too). He was happy to buy the item from another player before he left the server (aboit ten minutes after our deal, he waited for me to help this guy out). 
---
I combined his junk with my other junk into bulk and capped the vendor for 1400 caps in about 15 minutes of effort. I sold the stims/radaway and rarer junk for another 1000 caps over the next day. I personally used his ammo and radx (i like to pop radx frequently as I only use food and drink).
---
Everyone comes away happy when there is trade, one persons junk is anothers treasure.
---
Oh, sorry, I don't. But yeah, I'm sure that both chameleon an harder to detect while sneaking stacks.
---
Haha well ok - that was rather nice. I've built up a nice stock of Ballistic Fibre ready for when i need repairs again
---
Yep that about sums it up
---
👍
---
*Yawn* 
---
It's contagious.
---
ok I get that.  I prefer buffs instead of nerfs.  I guess this isn't one of those cases though.
---
Yeah, once it was 3*...got a 1* bat lol.
---
Coming with wastelanders
---
To me, this is the best fix lol
---
Am I the only one worried that this will be a Fallout 1st exclusive?
---
I got dumber just reading this
---
Thought the same thing for Cod. Apparently you need twice the size of the original game file in order to install updates. After deleting a game to download the update, just redownload the game.
---
Yea, they forgot a lot of things
---
Forgive me if you've mentioned this somewhere, but I've noticed that the Well Rested perk disappears sometimes while server hopping.  It's inconsistent.  Have you noticed that?  If so, have you added it to the mountain of bugs for them?
---
Thank god the floating bushes were addressed and not any thing else game breaking
---
What game balance do you speak of? Guys can take out a queen just as fast with a dcg
---
So now I have to delete 3 games off my PS4 just to do an update that’s some bullshit right there..
---
It might be nice to seperate the two, as I run bloodied but really it should be called ghoulish or glowing as I use rads to tamp my health down instead of just taking damage. Think like "dripping blood" at low, normal-non-radiated health vs "dripping glowing blood" or turning all ghouly-pruny when super irratiated. This way we could further branch bloodied builds into sub builds with additional perks/consequences
---
Sony completely backs up a game before they do an update in case something goes wrong with said update. So it completely backs up the game, does the update and installs, then deletes the backup if everything is fine.
---
I've noticed this too!
---
I have figured out what OP is really saying. Please see the translated text [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/5tsersY)
---
I had to transfer my other games to my external hd. All I have on my ps4 hd now is modern warfare and 76.
---
This looks more like beta patch notes for fixing design issues in the world.
---
Try repairing your game files using the Bethesda.net launcher.
---
Yeah.  It might sound like I'm joking, but that's a little visual detail that really stood out to me every time I ran a silo.
---
Now, if only they would fix the odd seams in between world cells...
---
lulz.
---
guys, im PS4, but play randomly..feel free to add me: dj5150119, and we can do some runs. (mention silo in friend request). Also, im Pacific time zone.
---
It does suck up ammo and stims...so have plenty of both.
---
This is hilariously dogshit
---
Hoarder needs strength. Switch to bloodied heavy gunner with full unyielding, you can carry Todd Howard on your back while fighting SBQ.
---
This is good. Real good.
---
I tell you it's shocking they're fixing things that make them the most money. What sort of business does that. Don't they know that business priorities in the current year are supposed to be:
---
1. Fix things for the customers that left and angrily insist they won't be back.
---
2. Fix things for the customers that pay the least and expect the most.
---
3. Free stuff for everyone.
---
4. Fix the free stuff you gave everyone last time.
---
5. Fix stuff for the people who got their money back.
---
6. Then after all of that quietly fix stuff for the people who pay monthly for a service that should be maintained using it's own revenue stream but don't boast the improvements too loudly.
---
Agreed - last weeks Set the World on Fire challenge and a few others were good. And some of them have me going to area's i rarely go to or in that challenges case actually use a flamer which i'd never bothered with before. I think those that get you to try something outside of the normal box are good.  
---
I've been generally able to get all or almost all of the weeklies \[minus any NW/Vault ones\] of late and i've generally been enjoying them having gone from not bothering, to accidentally doing some, to actively nabbing them.
---
The naked ones, kill something in your camp and those dependent on random timed events are all irritating and i'm glad they're gone \[or soon to be\]
---
I dont follow your posts, bud. 
---
If your unhappy with the game play another game though.
---
Hahaha sometimes it be like that I just got a bloodied ffr 45sub and a aa ffr lmg both lvl 30 on my new toon. Guess this ones got better rng. Good thing I have extra fixer plans hahaha.
---
Some bugs (have to reconfirm but likely not fixed):
---
* There is a missing collision-upon-death at one of the stairs in the Whitespring outhouses causing mobs to fall below the stairs.
---
* Mobs with plasma/energy deaths come back as invulnerable zombies just standing there.
---
* Crafting a Healing Salve counts as crafting a Stimpak too for the "Craft healing items challenge".
---
* Crafting Bufftats and Psychobuffs couns towards crafting their components themselves too for the "Craft drugs" challenge.
---
* Picking up Nuke codes don't count towards challenges.
---
* Craft-scrap loop that results in 1 free steel (no resource loss).
---
* Dead Scorchbeasts and certain air drops follow the player around.
---
* On the Watoga EMS second floor, there is a massive framerate drop when looking towards the rest of the floor from the top of the stairs on my low-end machine. Looking at the ground or looking away gives reasonable framerate.
---
* Player CAMPS with lot of light sources cause significant framerate drops.
---
* Consuming food or drink from the Pip-boy causes client hang.
---
os there a way to view all plans learned? might of gotteb ftom quest too but not sure?
---
I don't think the game will attract new people. A couple here and there, maybe. In the meantime, the people who *are* left are slowly giving up.
---
I like the idea of adding more modifiers, good and bad, change up the mix a bit. Elevated might be a bit tricky to figure out for the devs, because I'm not sure if there is a set "ground level" recorded buts its a good idea.
---
nice! looking for that ir cheaper as well
---
"I like to complain"
---
As expected.   
---
They don't care.
---
I’d honestly just rather redownload the game if something goes wrong tbh than have to redownload all my games every update.. glad I don’t play Morden watergate now aswell, seeing everyone’s comments about that being the same!
---
Long list of fixes for premium services, yeah right.
---
&gt;adding back the true snapable square glass greenhouse walls and roof from F04 would be a help too.
---
I can't agree more.
---
There are a lot of things I miss from FO4. Like the small ladders that could be attached to the smallest floor piece. To long of a list to name it all.
---
God these posts are pathetic.
---
Now when you say plenty of stims, are we talking about 50 or 20? Ballpark?  Ideally I would want to do the run on a weekend when I have more time.
---
Yeah any NW or Vault ones i outright pass on, but i agree with others that getting the rest whilst a bit of effort hasn't been terrible \[or just impossible\] and it has invariably had me play longer than i would have ordinarily so i'm sure that meets their objective.
---
So you have to delete newer, better games quite simply lol
---
Dude if paying for atoms made them listen I would shovel money over hand and fist to try to fix this game. It doesn't
---
You are the one who keeps asking. If *you're* unhappy with my comments, don't reply to them.
---
*big shrug*
---
Jackasses can no longer continually spam the dance emote music. So, there's that.
---
I don't think it's a relative thing.  You have to deal ~1,500 damage.  The only thing the melee players influence is how much time you have to do that.
---
That said, I think there is a bug where people aren't receiving rewards they are supposed to get from the Queen.
---
They don't need to go to blizzard, they are owned by Zenimax, the ESO company.
---
How is this possible? So if someone shoot me with a rad rifle (or gamma gun?) I get rads even when I’m in pacifist mode?
---
Screw this !Light wood laminate !!! Light wood laminate !!!
---
This xD
---
For now, you can rely on workarounds to avoid the 250DR and completed challenges bug.
---
For the 250DR bug, simply reload while sneaking.
---
For the completed challenges bug, you must join an adventure mode server before playing Nuclear Winter. You only have to join an adventure mode server once every time you launch the game.
---
Either that, or it goes to show how hastily added the 1st features were when they launched.
---
i love this patch. i really hated all those floating items.
---
I honestly feel like this is the case😭 I made a point to only delete BGS games I had downlaoded🤣
---
Test it for yourself really easy
---
It’s the little things in life.
---
Premium patch, hooray!! /s
---
Weapons that do well against bots and laser ceiling turrets are going to be your best bet. I’ve only run it once and had a friend who has done it many many times run me through it. He made it look easy. When I tried it the next time with someone else it was not nearly as easy. Bring your hacking skill if you have it, it will help. Good luck!
---
Can you explain how?
---
-Hillary entered chat. 
---
“I’m so sorry to hear about u/guccishort’s impending suicide.”
---
I'd be up for testing.  This only makes sense, good goal for Bethesda in 2020, use some common sense...
---
Yep i see them trying to take my outer worlds &amp; death stranding..no way!
---
Fast travel?
---
Blue!
---
Blame Sony for that one
---
Yes. It would be to their benefit to put it in the hands of a few players for a couple months before dropping on all the YouTubers for public shaming.
---
Are you playing on a potato? I just had this game running with fewer bugs than you are describing on a laptop with an intel integrated gpu.
---
They do still proc, but it happens so rarely they're not worth the investment in my eyes. Getting the scrap together to patch up weapons especially is relatively easy so I'd use those points for another card.
---
yeah, i dont have thousands of scrap right now cuz i dont troll for scrap much, but with the scrap robot im bulding up...probably would add 1k lbs to my stash.  Another cool thing (that you need to pay for! is the scrap boxes that let you instantly scrap and store all your junk and send it to your scrap box wherever you are.
---
So yeah P2W is kinda there..if there is such a thing as winning.
---
Test servers, why don't they exist yet?
---
This is it. We've reached Todd Howard's dream.
---
Coming  with Wastelanders.
---
My opinion on the translation of this is: the next time they delay wastelanders they'll release the loadouts to try and pacify the community.
---
Smart Bethesda would have released the load outs last month and 1st with Wastelanders 🤷 but money talks.
---
Bring the beards Bethesda!
---
Yes it can take many tries.
---
\*NAM and NAM\* records are generic named subrecords and do not associate themselves with a specific name due to the fact that they are used on a lot of records. HNAM in the case of COBJ.
---
the Private Worlds issue with nuked enemies happened before private worlds were a thing if you happened to end up alone on a new world. This is intended functionality
---
Tons of tiny fixes, nothing greedy added... I guess I'd call that a win. A small one, a disappointing one, but still a win...
---
Nah. Got Nia yesterday. The previous 3 were all bugs though.
---
Oh haven't had that one yet
---
^^^This^^^
---
I did not want to trash the game for not working, merely wanted to describe my frustration with it. I think I wanted my experience to be somewhat in the middle so that those who love the game won't be offended by my post but those who can't play it could relate because that is exactly how I feel about the game. I would love to play it if only I could enjoy it :)
---
true, i meant diluted, good call man.
---
All my toons are past level 50 except this new one which will be my 4th. Main is 250+ pvp is 201 mule/ high charisma/endurance is lvl 80+. I’m taking a different approach with this commando build. I want it to just be pve focused since I have my pvp character and my cards are set up for defense since the damage cap is at 110. No explosives no endurance cards except for life giver and iron clad. I’ll mod my armor to with dense and what ever the one on limbs go take less limb damage and then run 2 pieces of bolstering with sneak and 2 pieces of vanguard with sneak, and either a lifesaving sent/sneak chest or unyielding. Gonna try for full USA or FSA armor, ffr handmade either furious or bloodied depending if I can find one. I’m also going to use ground pounder this time and only one point of concentrated fire. Luck, agility and perception will hopefully be at 13-15 each depending on what perks I need in strength, endurance, and charisma. Most likely I’ll try not to have any points in strength and just rock a back pack. Carry weight in this game is a daily 9-5
---
The beard options are severely limited. We need longer and fuller options.
---
Could it be just console ?(PS4)
---
Probably because the servers are still down for maintenance
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
I've seen this guy outside alpha silo twice in the last few days.
---
The Meat Hook is objectively better, but it requires you to invest the time doing all the food and consumable buffs to get there.  If you do, it skyrockets above the rest.
---
Yea i feel this and the pipe bolts/revolver double perking is just end game min maxing as you learn about the game and what works best.
---
Might be im on Xbox
---
Test servers already.  Even if only on PC. Let what's left of your fanbase help!
---
I'm not unhappy with your comments and I've hardly kept asking for anything. I only asked for clarification on one thing.
---
Meh.  So what's the Atomic Shop content?  The Nuka Cola fridge there yet?
---
You're not wrong (at all), but that's a PS issue with how they do updates.  It makes a backup copy of the file being updated in case the patch fails, so it can easily revert to the old file.  Not much use for 76, but that's the way it was designed.
---
I dount there's a setting for changing that, but you can search around a bit and see if you can find anything.
---
1- "Mayday! Mayday! Coming in hot!"
---
2- "Seriously? You only jumped 2 feet."
---
1- "To me it felt like 200."
---
Bethesda is the thing most like a diseased feral Ghoul in my life
---
region based weapons like a cranberry weapon would do more damage at the cranberry bog. that seems neat'o
---
This thought process is so damn odd and I've seen it time and time again. If I could get more stealth boys by server hopping all that would happen is I'd use more stealth boys. Now instead all I do is just not use them... Back in the day I had to server hop for plastic to make shot gun shells and guess what? Having more shells meant I played more. Not less. It got to a point where I'd have to just log in, find plastic, and log back out for a few days to build my supply back up. Now I have 100k 5.56 and I don't play less, I enjoy knowing I'm not gonna run out...
---
i usually have 2-300 diluted stims on me since im bloodied.  If you run at full health probably 20 for your first few runs...I can revive you too.
---
And it was provided. Looks like our conversation is over!
---
Dismissed.
---
So I still can use my 250dr weapons, my strangler heart armor or my jet pack but I can enjoy sitting in the main menu.
---
People are paying potentially $100 for Fallout first so of course they’re going to want to fix that. It doesn’t set a good precedent if the subscription is super buggy
---
They usually 'open the flodgates' shortly after taking the servers offline.
---
Moreover I see from other recent posts that consoles - at least PS4 - can Indeed download the patch.
---
Doing a solo silo run as a sneaky character is not as hard as you might think, but it might be time consuming.
---
Remember to check the silo state holotape to see which silos are not in cooldown, and Nukacrypt to see if codes are available before attempting the run. It sucks to go through a silo only to realize you don't have the code to actually launch a nuke.
---
Do you ever have a hard time killing anything with most weapons? Thats my point about game balance
---
You wouldn't need a ground level.  You'd just have to compare the height coordinates of the player versus the thing they damage.
---
Oh also Scattershot is bugged, you need to unequip it then re-equip it in order to reload faster.
---
No, as I said, it works good for me on ultra settings. The video glitch I had inside the vault happened at the third-ish doorway I've walked past, two before that were just fine and FPS were stable. And when I've logged my lvl 100+ characters out there in the wild, one in Winterspring and one I don't remember where it had all been good and working smoothly, had no complaints.
---
I think that's one of their big concerns is anything that could take away from the potential hype before Wastelanders drops could find it dead in the water. They should keep the test group small enough to not leak or gossip about Wastelanders, but large enough to find the stuff you won't find by just sterile QA testing.
---
Hi,
---
I know my reply is very late but I found this link (AP cost data mined from game files) in another reply in this very thread and thought that it might be of interest to you:
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/DLC04\_HandMadeGun](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/DLC04_HandMadeGun) 
---
Here is the same data about Combat Rifle:
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/CombatRifle](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/CombatRifle) 
---
If you choose the configurations of the guns it shows you corresponding AP costs. If that data is true then combat rifle can go as low as 5 AP per shot, and handmade can do 6.39 AP per shot. This is without legendary 25 VATS cost modifier.
---
Yeah I saw, think it's a pc launcher issue. I'm having the same problem. Happened to me a couple patches ago too and I couldn't download until after they were completely done
---
Patch downloads don't start when the servers are up - my PC and PS4 downloaded the patch a couple of minutes after the server went down.
---
Yeah idk why we have to wait...this needed to be implemented months ago
---
People are paying for fallout first every month so if they want players to keep subscribing of course they’re going to make sure any large bugs are fixed. It sounds like there was a lot of issues since it launched so that’s why this patch had a lot of fixes for the mode
---
Locking scrapboxes behind a subscription is ridiculous, especially considering they originally claimed that stash weight limits were due to performance issues. I can understand shifting strategies to monetize some conveniences (like repair kits and xp boosters) even though they also originally claimed they would only charge for cosmetics after purchase, but this is several steps too far imo.
---
is it up on ps4?
---
Exactly, theres never a time I cant kill something with any weapon in my arsenal..thats not very balanced to start with lol
---
I honestly dont mind a challenging one every once in a while provided it's FUN.  That's what developers seem to forget these days when it comes to challenges in games: Its a game they're supposed to be fun.
---
Would love to see some like kill 3 creatures with a single grenade daily or kill 10 enemies at each range melee/short/mid/long weekly. Or like take a picture of a mushroom cloud weekly or complete the obstical courses weekly where we have to go back and do the ever upwards possum scout courses again.
---
Theres a ton of possibilities to make them super fun if they're going to keep the rewards small.  Least make me smile when they hand me a dime worth of atoms for 30 minutes work lol
---
How about making 3 star legendarys drop 3 star items, it’s pretty much a middle finger when I take the time to kill a 3 star death claw or mirelurk queen when all I get is a one star leather arm or some other bs
---
You can still take the scrap out whenever you want you just can’t add anymore.
---
Do you perhaps have the Quest turned off on the data tab in your Pip Boy?  If it's turned off, you won't get the quest markers and you won't be able to launch a new one since the first technically hasn't been completed yet.
---
What dance emote?
---
The only dance emote is the fallout first one.
---
Lay off the Jet homie
---
Bethesda just provides so much material to complain about
---
Just imagine how many noobs like him exist out there, no wonder why Bethesda treats Fallout played like shit lol
---
My first time doing the sheepsquatch main quest, I had no idea it was a public event. Like 20 people showed up, and I died right before it was killed. I ended up in the infinite load screen, and could hear players discussing what they got. I waited 20 minutes before quitting in frustration. A whole quest line just to get Bethesda'd and not gain any actual rewards. I didn't get a single drop from it being defeated. I had to server hop and redo the battle to complete the quest.
---
To be fair, the two Gauntlets *are* ridiculously heavy, especially when compared to the Power Fist or Bear Arm.
---
Why would you renew the subscription?
---
Sadly, that’s the highlight of the patch for me
---
Wow so informative.
---
2020
---
I've always run with a chameleon armour piece, I have no sneak perks and no harder to detect armour.
---
I can stand 2 meters in front of a group of 6 supermutants, kill them all with a silenced weapon and never go above "caution", so I've always assumed it effects NPCs as well
---
r/foundthevegan
---
The plasma grenade plan. I will get that fucker, one day.
---
The need to constantly swap perk cards (crafting, lock picking, hacking, solo play, squad play) is one of the things that drove me away from the game.
---
I found the game was basically an exercise in tedium between stash limitations, scrap collecting loops and card swaps, and limited cap inventory.
---
I get one every 30 maps or so. Savage divide is the best
---
Yes I've gotten 3 so far. A T-51 leg, Raider Leg, and a T-45 arm. But they are quite rare. I wait until i have about 100 maps then i start digging. Only reason i dig is for the PA parts and to replenish my regular Armor Mod Plans in my cheap vendor.
---
The difference is negligible.  Because I'm wearing Unyielding armor, the Intelligence boost makes hacking fairly quick.  If that wasn't the case, you could easily spend as much time fixing the pipes.
---
Not fast enough honestly.  Should have been Q1 2019.
---
I'll give it a look!
---
If it’s already in the game and people have paid money for it then then those people should at least be able to expect bugs fixed for it. Do you think Bethesda is going to prioritize regular bugs over something people are paying $100 a year for? I’m not even subscribed to first but I’d still expect them to do the latter if I’m paying a lot of money. 
---
This update still includes plenty of bug fixes for all players, even if there are some missing that have been brought to attention a while ago.
---
What's glictched about it?
---
New version is 1.2.5.8  If you have that one you should be good to go
---
Im on ps4 and ive never had a fast travel bug. I have encouuntered the junping jet pack bug. I also know that you can put an ultracite jetpack on any ultricite armor piece. My left leg supplys me my jetpack.lol
---
I really don't think the longevity of the game is dependant on Wastelanders' launch.  
---
The only thing that is going to change will be the amount of money Bethesda is going to get from the project, it can be more and it could be less, but:  
---
1. They will continue supporting the game no matter what, but at the exact same pace as now.  
---
2. People who enjoy it will continue enjoying it and having fun in it if they already do.   
---
Sure, it is an important point at F76 development, but it won't make any difference to the game itself, but for playerbase number.
---
I’d go with the latter
---
No one owes you shit
---
You're the one who was talking about the Queen.  It's not about having a hard time, if it's a matter of damage, the Meat Hook kills her faster.
---
If you consider the cost of the stash box, that's what people are paying for. It's not free for Bethesda to have unlimited storage on the servers, speaking from a non-bias view. Yes, it does suck, but they can't give handouts. It's a business, not a charity.
---
Imagine my minigun actually firing every time it spins up, instead of glitching out while i get mauled
---
Also the gatling plasma / minigun wind up bug still present from the first NW patch.
---
Now I've heard from Bethesda. Keeping in mind that I have been playing since B.E.T.A. and purchased the Tricentennial edition, their less-than-helpful response is, quote: " If you are receiving the error message "Login failed. This account lacks the required entitlements" when attempting to log into the game, you have not yet applied a valid Fallout 76 game code to your account."  
---
Really? How then, have both myself and my son been playing for the last year? Did we dream all of that? 
---
That's been my experience, as well.  I've had PvP players take swipes at me, but the only time I've taken damage in an attack is when I accidentally became wanted (by not paying attention when looting an air drop container).
---
Why would I even waste hard drive space
---
It's nice to see people that can respect others.
---
I heard Microsoft stopped support for Windows 7. You can always upgrade to Windows 10 for free at the cost of limited personalization settings that can still be accessed through the registry (if you feel confortable enough to mess around with it) and a barely visible watermark at the bottom-right your screen that is not visible while playing in full-screen mode.
---
That's not how they works on wired connections.
---
Um... yes, there is a client side patch.  A few gigs of it, in fact.
---
Please consider fixing the front door crash issue at West Tek.  Also, how about increasing the chances of learning mods for radium rifles?  I've broken thousands of those damned things and don't even have half of the mods learned.
---
Playing from Japan with no problems
---
Completely and utterly beside the point man. 
---
Ypu are just agreeing that they are prioritizing Fallout 1st over all the long time issues and player concerns. They didnt add even a single quest of new co tent and should be criticized for it. 
---
Not applauded for doing the absolute  bare mi imum
---
It was in Oblivion too, If you click A and X at the same time when you did it it would almost never break your lockpick, loved that trick as a youngin
---
That is the exact fact I am referring to and it's wrong that they fix this and not +250 damage resist bug
---
Yeah like the color of the scrapbox..
---
Cool thanks for the info. Couple questions-
---
One piece of chameleon? 
---
Agility level+ bonuses?
---
Do all NPCs have the same dectection ability? If not, do Super Mutants have high or low detection?
---
Id like to see an armor effect the coincides with a Berserker weapon. Removes all resistance of the armor and gives a small damage buff like 5% or something per piece. This would make a Berserker build more viable then it is now. The build is in a decent place at the moment, but i feel like it could use a little love.
---
Nothing anymore. The first few days some people reported loosing junk but it was patched.
---
 Now I've heard from Bethesda. Keeping in mind that I have been playing since B.E.T.A. and purchased the Tricentennial edition, their less-than-helpful response is, quote: " If you are receiving the error message "Login failed. This account lacks the required entitlements" when attempting to log into the game, you have not yet applied a valid Fallout 76 game code to your account."
---
Really? How then, have both myself and my son been playing for the last year? Did we dream all of that?
---
Radaway is common this really shouldn't be an issue for you.
---
They usually kill themselfs on the mines and you can just keep moving on. Or grab there scrap they drop on death and move on if there extra annoying.
---
I've had this a few times now and its honistly just a minor annoyance.
---
There's hella bugs that break weapons and PVP from the beginning lol what makes you think this will get fixed anytime soon
---
Which *indirectly* makes you invulnerable, right?  Outside of those certain special circumstances, anyway.
---
It literally just ignores my FT after it asked me ‘pay this many caps to travel to this location?’. Takes me many tries to be able to FT. The jetpack bug is like a random AP drain. Occasionally at zero it would allow me to fly high. Just very random and unpredictable.
---
It’s amazing to me most if not all of these “fixes” are cosmetic and are totally geared toward F1 players or NW.  
---
The DR bug is still out there not to mention jet pack glitches or floating or invisible ghouls that take no damage but hey lets fix a goddamn shrub at Whitesprings
---
I saw numerous posts about that pumpkin bag thing, but besides them I generally agree. It’s a lot of tightening up of minor things.
---
I've never heard it spun that way, I'm glad I went all this time without. That is so out of touch its not funny, but whatever mental gymnastics are needed to keep yourself from accepting your own bad decisions in the face of convenience right?
---
Your question is specific to PS4. Why waste others peoples time reading about your problem only to mention ls4 at the very last line?
---
Not to defend Bethesda, but it's way easier to track a junk item with a multiplier than it is tracking weapons and armor with condition, stats, legendary effects, etc.
---
How about eat a sack full of dicks does that help snowflake?
---
I would love to check, but even Bethesda Launcher does not open here. Have to restart sometime...
---
It says the patch is less than 2GB for PC and 5GB for consoles.
---
if you do test id be interested in the results.  im wondering if it has to do with the explosion on the rad weapon causing it since mines have the same problem.
---
So I did try this, my friend said they must have been using Duped mines because they had way to many and we’re being killed from their own mine rads. But shredding me with no problem
---
\&gt;This game has close to nothing for 3 attempts of a main story, a shitty overseer quest that can’t be completed, the brotherhood of steel quest line, and the enclave quests.
---
\&gt; I don’t feel like reading all the terminals and listening to all the holotapes, so I barely know the story of the game.
---
***Are we not playing fallout - reading the terminals and listening to holotapes has always been a core part . . .***
---
It's hard to feel anything remotely like empathy or sympathy with almost back-to-back acknowledgements like this. 
---
It's hard to see anyone at BGS seeing this as constructive criticism - they will def disregard the OP.
---
I don’t but like I said raise awareness
---
Blink twice if your having a stroke
---
That's a good reason to launch the game on Steam already
---
Very true, I’ll test and let you know.
---
Don't talk about your hand like that.
---
Awesome.
---
I wonder if they've tied it to server time rather than the actual elapsed duration.  So if you hop on a server and the time is different from the one you've hopped from, suddenly your bonus has expired.
---
Oddly enough it doesn't seem to affect Well Tuned as strongly.
---
I agree that this is probably the buggiest PC game I've played in awhile. But, it makes it all the more remarkable that I've played it over 1300 hours so far and would rather wait for the patch to finish this morning than play a different game. So maybe try it again after today's patch?
---
I dont want a carry, I can handle myself inside and know what to do... Just cant do it alone
---
Gotcha, you should try it it's pretty funny, I got em lead and 83 bulk steel from a guy doing that
---
1&gt;  We need to be able to tag items as no-scrap.
---
2&gt; Components for quests and daily quests should never autoscrap.
---
This is just game design 101.
---
My sister lives a thousand miles away.  We started playing together in BETA.  It's more of a social outing for me.  We get on together for an hour or so every night and chat about our kids and jobs while we hunt legendaries.  And now, our kids are jumping on and playing also.  Works out well.
---
I know that pretty well, thanks. I do not like Windows 10 as much as I do 7 for various reasons, so prefer to stay on 7 for now. I've checked and F76 supports 7, 8.1 and 10, so I should be good. Besides, F76 did play well without many of said issues half a year ago (I had plenty of different ones though), and I don't think it is the root of the problem. Also, I've only seen one or two games that were unfit for windows 7 so I do not really think there is dire need to change my OS right now.
---
Nope.  "A few" is the right answer.
---
Hell, you get 10 atoms just for collecting 10 caps.
---
Share rad sponge and enjoy the ride. I gave up on them fixing anything.
---
The game has bad default settings. You have to start with the lowest possible settings and mess around with the ini files.
---
You can always change the appearance of your character, except for the name, so you can skip the customization, quickly choose a name, and quickly leave the vault to save your character.
---
There is nothing interesting in the vault, aside from the overseer's terminal with some story on the vault itself, so don't even bother exploring it.
---
I like that you can now display character names . . .
---
The 250 DMG reduction bug sucks as I have a bloodied auto handmade and Vampire auto handmade that are useless until this issue is resolved.  Thankfully I still have an AAE auto handmade and BE primed auto handmade but would like to use those other weapons once in a while.
---
I view those perks as early game stuff. They are handy to have when your weapons and armor aren't great and you don't have resources to repair constantly. With the right build you just kind of grow out of them. The weapons perk may still be useful for someone running an auto gun build of some type.
---
Ok. Well we can’t change the past.
---
Yup the mods add a lot of weight
---
They make beard gas masks IRL.
---
i have noticed that if you need to do a bunch of base work or extensive organization on your stash or vending machines it's MUCH quicker and smoother on a private server.
---
I understand where you're coming from - but have suffered from a DC before so I feel for those who get F'd.
---
I think having a very low low  limit (1-2max) on them and a timer could help - Similar to 'lives' in other games.
---
You fell once, and there are holes everywhere?
---
The people fighting from under the map are hacking.  Those 2 issues aren't related.  Yes, hacking remains a big problem in NW.
---
If you've found a static hole in the terrain, you can report that to see if they get around to fixing it.  The hackers are here to stay (at least in the short to medium term, at least).
---
Good tea.  Nice house.
---
&gt;We need a small group of actual players to actually break it early and have a clear line of communication with the developers. 
---
RIP paid, professional QA testers.
---
I'm all for large scale beta testing but Bethesda should hire QA testers, not just exploit players.
---
They added a bunch of thanks giving stuff, an lion costume and raider stuff.  
---
Also some human NPC stuff, i think for testing shit out.
---
Stupid oversight from the beginning, dont hope for a fix. Its a stupid system
---
You should be looking for armor with the 20% reduced weapon weight modifier. You can stack them all the way up to 90% and it will affect the entire weapon, mods and all, not just the base version.
---
Spoiler: It's 7 pre-war money and a pipe pistol.
---
Do you have a link to these new raider stuff?
---
As I said in my original comment I have no sneak perks, I listed my agi perks in another comment, and I don't remember 100% but I think it's about 15 with my bonuses, base is 9
---
Well, you wasted time being here.
---
I agree! I had to remove the jet pack and put on another torso because of this reason. I was tired of no AP every time I went to jump over something it would trigger the jet pack and burn all AP up and I would burn through fusion cores crazy fast..rip.
---
Humans.  Humans never change.
---
My endgame revolves around Queen, Encryptid, and PvP. If anyone wears Strangler Heart in these situations I have to leave the event. Often I just quit the game entirely and go do something else.
---
The game is still off-line.
---
Patch size at 5.14GB so I figured I'd get it down within an hour, but turns out it refuses to pick up any speed so currently looking at 6 hours, which probably will be worse as we approach peak time.
---
This sucks. :(
---
Are you on PS4? It's still showing as no available updates on my Xbox.
---
What's a meaningful note from Patch 15?
---
I have no problem with my jet pack.
---
It all depends how they market it. There are still people who are interested in playing who haven’t picked it up yet or people who would be once they add NPCs. Marketing campaigns drive sales.
---
Pay up for your subscription.
---
Lots of fixes, such a misplaced bush?
---
Yeah I’ve been running emergency protocols chests. Very useful. I miss flying though... 😞
---
Well yeah. He's posting a floating camp in a thread hating floating camps. What else would you expect?
---
another boring (but certainly usefull) patch. 99% of fixes...no content or real gameplay changes...
---
YES!, Me too... I hate wasting time searching for bodies especially when they go flying in weird directions.  I've literally wasted thirty minutes searching for the body of a Legendary. Bethesda PLEASE give us a tool of some kind!
---
There are people in my friend group that I can't play with and I think it is unreasonable to ask them to remove their hard earned Strangler PA just because mY cOmPuTeR iS bAd even though I spent over $1000 on it
---
I’m on Xbox. As soon as I turned it on it started downloading. Maybe try restarting your console or logging out and back in??
---
To what end?
---
Actually, for a lot of bugs, it's best to keep them as much under wraps as possible.  Obviously for PR purposes, but also to prevent the spread of information that people could use to exploit the game.
---
Granted, the +250 DR bug has been well known for a while, and isn't something easily exploitable, but as a policy I'm sure they're just not in the habit of taking about these things.
---
I'm not saying that they changed how you accept combat.
---
I'm saying that if you're not in Pacifist mode, you run the risk of accidentally accepting combat by returning damage when someone tries to damage you.  In Pacifist mode, you can't accidentally damage someone.  (Or at least it's harder/more circumstantial to.)  Therefore someone can't grief you into PvP if you're in Pacifist.
---
Hi there, we are aware of this issue and working on this for a future patch. Thanks for your patience!
---
Nice! I run the assembled torso with action boy on 3 for all that fast AP regain and I miss flying as well 😢
---
No problem!!
---
Looks like 1st are more 1st than day 1 bugs.
---
If you see these people laying them, shoot them as soon as they lay them. They get the full force of the mine, but you get a small dose of rads. My mate showed me this when we had the same issues at whitesprings. It was hilarious and he got a few bits of junk as anti-griefer payment.

---
*next patch
---
For sure.  It just seems to be more of a punchline at this point though.  It's just hard for me to see Wastelanders overcoming that.  Here's hoping though.
---
You're probably better off using the 200% repair perks for armor and weapons, then use those luck point for starched genes, class freak, and/or bloody mess, in that order.
---
Right but hasn’t pacifist mode always done that? That’s not what OP is talking about. OP is talking about people being confused why they are able to be killed in workshops even though they have pacifist mode enabled.
---
wow , thanks !! never thought of this
---
Non-intuitively it’s the better PCs having issues with this compared to older machines. I ask clanmates and politically ask event attendees to remove a single arm piece or their helmet and 8/10 of the time they oblige. But in PvP this doesn’t fly.
---
Asking to beta test a game already full of bugs to fix bugs just sounds like delaying Wastelanders again with extra steps.
---
You miss the part where unlimited *scrap*doesn't have an effect on server stability. It's just numbers, not actual physical items in the game. It wouldn't make absolutely no difference if everyone had it.
---
Otherwise, what are you saying? That subscribers are paying for the *privilege* of messing up the dervers for everyone?
---
Yeah I've experienced a nominal boost with regards to those - for me though -  the big thing with Vending on Public Adv. is that you have to turn the machines off. 
---
I didn't know that for so long and it's so much less frustrating when they aren't tied into that map marker *(I think thats why it gets kinda screwy because it's also updating the FT marker other players see)*
---
wanna share pics man?
---
Hey /u/blueclitcommando you interested?
---
The +250 damage resistance while reloading bug isn't an exploit. It negates the primary legendary effect of the weapon when you reload. Crouching while reloading with it sometimes bypasses the bug but sometimes it doesn't.
---
Thanks for your patience. XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
theres no link, ive looked into the files.  
---
if i find the promotion pictures ill show them
---
Pacifist mode has always done that, but what changed is that Pacifist (at launch) did not protect you from slap damage.  So you weren't invulnerable in any sense of the word in Pacifist.  If you ran a low health build at launch, a player could in theory slap damage you to death.  
---
Now you're (sorta) invulnerable.  Depending on circumstances/situations, of course.
---
Might be time for an upgraded/larger hard drive.  I put a 2 TB in mine for that reason
---
Imagine your minigun working but you manage to crash everyone in a 100m radius because of strangler pa armor glitch
---
Being able to watch the player base count. Either big **oof** for everyone watching, or a big **oof** to the people saying its dying.
---
Way better performance on a private server
---
It would be nice if you deleted the posts and comments asking for giveaways.
---
Which part of this patch is meaningful?
---
I understand that, yes, but still Windows 7 is supported by the game officially and I haven't yet seen upgrading to W10 as a step to improve F76 performance done by anyone. Will give it a try sooner ifI will I decide to upgrade to Windows 10.
---
They legitimately need a better QA team.
---
Exploits work both ways.  If I'm involved in PvP, and I know a person is likely to get nerfed when they reload, I can use that to my advantage.
---
As I said, not *easily* exploitable, but if you're creative enough...
---
I’ve been considering getting an external hard drive recently.. might have to now this was an issue last update and now this update.. I don’t wanna keep redownlaodin random games I play with my friends over an over again!
---
"Music: The music that plays on the Main Menu has returned to the original launch theme.  
---
Main Menu: The background video that plays on the Main Menu has returned to the original launch video."
---
Fuck yeah. Nostalgia.
---
It has just started downloading, thanks again :)
---
Sad that you have to warn us. Some of this community can be so scummy even though most of it is so kind. Tbh I hope those people get shit on irl just as much as they shit on others online
---
Plague walker. +10% damage per illness/disease
---
This:
---
 **Lighting:** Fixed an issue that could cause lighting to load incorrectly when playing in non-English versions of the game. 
---
This was a bug that was literally in the game from day one, and yea, it was as funny as it is written, the fix to it was literally to turn your language to English...
---
&gt; form of a new perk card?
---
Just make it a part of the minigame. At most, have picklock perks carry a +% chance to succeed forcing the lock.
---
I know, I'm just saying that the changes may be a factor.  Or you may have had bad luck.  I dunno.  But I hope you'll try again after the patch.
---
It also depends on what the primary legendary effect it is. Some of them make no difference in PvP since damage is capped.
---
They said we gonna get a december event, probably Xmas/thanksgiving, after the NW halloween event.
---
Yes PLEASE, I bought the greenhouse for this reason.
---
I have played on ultras half a year ago and it runs pretty well now still, if not for some glitches that happen at some specific locations. It was the door this time, I remember walls and houses looking weird sometimes, and that kind of stuff.
---
Added you and dj. Just finishing the download now and will start farming some ammo(although every time I try fighting a queen she never drops anything for me but i will still help if I can)
---
Any reply yet?
---
Two things on here, the first one, do you recall where you fell through the map?  
---
Second, if you encounter a player attacking from under the map, we encourage you to file a report against them so we can investigate their account. Any videos or photos you can provide are extremely helpful in these reports.  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
You must have failed math.  Out of about 73 fixes only around 18 were for Fallout 1st.  Fallout 1st fixes were oly 25% of all the fixes.
---
really good idea but it would kill the fusion core market.
---
Do you have any photos of what it looks like on the ground?
---
Men they dont even fix core functions and you are asking for this? They dont care about you... change monitor.
---
Uhhhhh - well IMHO - Personally I think this is one that doesn't need to be made easier and will bring with it unnecessary Player-to-Player problems.
---
**To start -** There's an element of fun / intensity when trying to pick that silo door or whatever in a hurry for your team.
---
**Is it that hard to find the sweet spot?** I personally think that while it's a pain to equip the cards *(which is to be fixed with 'Perk Card Loadouts' and are to come / you can get with mods anyways as it stands)* the actual lock picking is a easy enough.
---
Terminals it's the same thing - 3 cards into master hacker and you can essentially 'guess' your way through a terminal in like two trees max.
---
**Finally (and arguably the big one) -** Allowing players to cheese locks on CAMP doors, Extractors, Collectors, etc is not a good idea. Sorry but not sorry - it's incredibly easy to see the Nuclear blowback from that one.
---
Or just farm them like everyone else
---
Most underwhelming patch notes ever. Loads of really important stuff not addressed at all and yet there's so many fixes for unimportant stuff like scrap box colour. Who the fuck cares?
---
Fix the broken legendary effects, fix the acid damage for strangely PA, fix the scout badge challenges, fix the broken meathook.
---
Well..maybe next patch..lol..more and more people are finding out..its kinda fun..having a firefight inside building against others who "caught you"...and watching other randos scramble hearing shots and not knowing where its coming from haha
---
This would be a great utility thing. It can be even tied to a BoS quest. Awesome idea indeed.
---
Im talking about adventure, not NW
---
I really hope that public test servers are available before Wastelanders to actually test the DLC. Hell, make them private test servers with full NDA, but it's fairly critical to have the Wastelanders tested with a feedback from the playerbase.
---
At the same time, I'm afraid that some higher-ups are issuing orders to actively pursue the new content that will bring back players instead of major stability/quality improvements...As a software developer myself, I know these kinds of managers really well. "Features first, then priority 1 and 2 bugs. We'll move the 3-5s to the next iteration. If we don't have time for bugs, we'll demote the bugs to priority 3...".
---
Well now you brought awareness to the fact they can be used that way, so others will most likely use it
---
Think he's talking about the rules in place for a reason, for a number of reasons, not necessarily upset at the other players. For players who struggled and did the grind on time, yes, it's frustrating to now realize you didnt have to stress and cram it all in, but that's not the main concern. Reintroduction of missed rewards is a tough selling point, the point of timed rare rewards **is** just that, they are supposed to be difficult, and supposed to be rare. I've missed event rewards, sales, and timed quests. Never got legacy weapons, never got survival reward weapons or Fasnacht rewards, but that's what makes these events/periods exciting is the chase to play. 
---
I feel proud of the items that I do get that are rare versus items that are common I could care less about. How many people show off their bloody chef clothes versus glowing skeleton? How many people show off responder paramedic jumpsuits versus red Assylum outfits or tattered field jackets? 
---
This said, I think its fine they are opening it back up because they pulled the plug early (12 hours) but its not cool for another week. I'm not upset at other players for this, just sad about the game system because I stayed up late on work nights, got up early, gave up normal game time I enjoy and crammed in play in a mode I don't enjoy to get rewards that I now know I didnt have to stress over.
---
Mine works too, what is/was wrong with them?
---
No, the ground looked like as if the outer circle just was some kind of visual bug on the map screen. Inexplicable.
---
Is it just me or does it feel like only a single intern is responsible for fixing non Fallout 1st/Atom Store bugs?
---
The game is littered with a ton of bugs that affect day to day game play but it's such bottom-level priority basic shit like model placement &amp; object collision that gets fixed.
---
Of that's the case then they could just make 3 star enemies rare. The enemy star should directly relate to the legendary drop.
---
Cheers, the restart worked.
---
That is coming next year!
---
&gt;it would kill the fusion core market.
---
I agree. But then again real life market is always recycling, so do we have to recycle as well.
---
I can finally start repairing my armor again. It was keeping me up at night knowing that my armor wasn't breaking like it should be. :P
---
Seriously though, it's nice to see some of the little bugs get fixed. Not every bug fix has to be huge. It would be nice to see them fix the 250 damage bug and some others, but that doesn't mean they should stop fixing little things. Personally, I just want to be able to wear my yellow hooded rags over my armor. That's been a bug since day 1.
---
"That's mom for mad."
---
:P
---
"...follow me down the hallway to the Besthesda dev department"
---
The lockpick swet spot highlighter mod works on fo76.
---
Longer with the pipes - esp. for the uninitiated. I've taken a few Fresh-to-Silo players through over the last few weeks. 
---
They get caught up with the robots and turrets. 
---
It's **IMHO** far easier to guess away at the terminal and break 1-2 picks on the lock *(if you suck at picking - can't remember the last time I broke one. . .. not that it matters with how many you can carry lol)*
---
Cos they're cunts, lazy cunts.
---
They could always reduce the ability to obtain them.
---
3 instances in one week seemed unusual especially when I had never seen it before. I’m on PS4, I don’t know if that affects likelihood of hacking. I believe these hole do exist and are exploitable. I am trying to narrow down the locations and circumstances.
---
Ok, that brings it down to 62 fixed and only 18 of those were for Fallout 1st.  Your math is still way off.
---
Can you guys fix the vampire handmades been trying to test out a high health build but the handmade I have does not regen health per hit and I mean zero .  (I believe it’s just HM’s )
---
Don’t want to go thru a work around to test it .
---
And help would be appreciated from posters or Bethesda it self ty.
---
Trust me it's worth getting fairly quick with those because it makes the Silo a lot easier.
---
Do you think they didn't hire any QA testers? I guarantee there was a team that ran through FO76 before original release. Bethesda isn't some little indie studio, they would've hired a team to run through everything. They're not going to think of the same stuff as someone who has thousands of hours in the game and has experience with the bugs BGS titles are prone to. Plus they don't have to pay beta testers. 
---
I mean, there's a reason companies have internal QA testing and alpha/beta testing, right?
---
just use player vendors. i got all three of the mutations i got for like 1500
---
Hmm, didn't think about it like that, good point. Suppose it is fairly doable than
---
Know what there should be? Refunds for fallout 76.
---
Hi there, we are aware that you are aware and clearly not working on this for a future patch. Thanks for your hard work!
---
switch to a melee build.
---
It's actually once every day, or until the daily atom challenges expire. I can log in at noon in adventure mode and in the evening play nuclear winter without worrying about losing atoms.
---
Your welcome :)
---
Yay!! Just remember that the game is still undergoing maintenance and the servers are offline so if you can’t launch the game or sign in that’s probably why!!
---
I get a stupid stuttering that makes it hard to move and turn a lot in game. I’ll go one direction, lag out and be facing another way. I don’t know if this is a problem for other people but I was hoping that would be fixed by now too :/
---
Well yeah, if it does I don't see much more support in the future outside of the kind of content we see on FO4 and Skyrim with the creation club.
---
Not just that but the majority of the fixes seem trivial. It almost reads like a satirical take on patch notes.
---
It’s a visual big. Carryover from nuclear winter.
---
So you can ban the people who report it?
---
*Truth is, the giveaway was rigged from the start.*
---
i think one spawns in arktos pharma. in the basement during the event.
---
IM VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE!!!!
---
There is one photo of a white headless model. Is it the correct link?
---
“QA testing? What is that?” Bethesda
---
you mean like that default perk in RDO? :)
---
 You missed the train.  That was fixed a couple days after the release of Fallout 1st.
---
Since a year I beg for an alternate Fusion Generator version which refills Fusion cores but offers half the power for a camp.
---
&gt;Oh noooo he's criticising Bethesda, he's surely a troll xD
---
I can admit this hot potato of a game is funny at times, especially two days ago when I finished "I am become death" quest, went to alpha site and glitched through some of the doors with the camera glitch to save time and then I nuked the scorchbeast Queen only to get kicked out of the server for god knows what reason LOL I still don't understand why I didn't uninstall smh
---
Did you actually read what you posted?
---
you think that's bad, my ultracite armor I can put jetpacks on EVERY piece of the armor lol. It will let me put them on the legs, arms, helmet, AND torso.
---
The hotfix already happened. Have you not had any scrap added to your account? Did you submit a ticket?
---
Hell I'm surprised we got this much support considering Bethesda could never be bothered with any of their previous games.
---
#Foodbuild
---
Could someone give me 1000€?
---
I mean.. I really, really *WANT* it. Otherwise I can't do things that don't really matter. ('matter', like for example clean water, food, a warm and safe place to sleep/live, ..)
---
/s
---
I mean scamming sucks and is disgusting. But really, who's giving away money so random strangers can play online games? (*OnLiNeGaMeS!*) If you don't need/want the money, give it to someone who truly needs it.
---
Hey there, are you still experiencing this issue?
---
Sounds like a frame rate issue from your hardware. The PS4 pro does this a lot.
---
Agreed, however while the Jet Pack is fun, with Marsupial it isn't necessary.  In fact, your build will benefit more from other torso mods.  Try Kinetic Dynamo, Emergency Protocols or Medic Pump PA builds.
---
Well thanks for all the replies everyone, I just didn't know if I should be getting kissed first or what because I've seen other players sell them for like 5-9 k recently. I should have jumped on it then...
---
Agreed. Maybe a larger team too.
---
I’ll try to get back with some better details. I don’t have any footage but I will record it if I see anything in the future.
---
Exactly what i wrote 4 months ago is what I'd expect. And the game still has a shitty build mechanic. So for Low level easy moving, it's still the best option. However I do notice less and less floating camps.
---
So how did this buggy mess launch?
---
I agree with the trivial nature. It doesn’t seem like this patch really needed to roll out at all. Hopefully there are bigger things they are working on.
---
Every person I know in person who left the game except for one plans on trying it again when Wastelanders drops. That amount of money is going to be used in decision making at the highest levels for the resources to commit to 76 because it represents a future revenue stream. There is a reason to give a game more support if it is bringing in more money, and to let it die if it no longer makes sense given their projections for returns on the project. 
---
FO76 could be a live game 3 years from now, or at the end of its life cycle by the end of next year and that will be a business decision made by Zenimax.
---
None of these fixes were worth shit to anyone. It's the equivalent of banging a hammer on the floor to make it sound like your doing work.
---
possibly. But I don’t get the issue in my other online games. Which is why I thought it might be 76 specific. I’m PC.
---
I'd like to see the source where unlimited scrap doesn't effect server stability. 
---
And honestly, I feel it was a mistake for them to add unlimited scraping all together, but it's not a big deal. 
---
And as far as messing up servers, that's a false accusation. They're recycled servers with little lift span, that's all they are. And the ones that are new, are generated on their contribution towards profit. That's all it is. Don't get emotional over this.
---
Thanks! This happened to me on pc.
---
I reported this as an exploit months ago and got a meaningless piss weak response.  People were throwing Nuka grenades at afk campers then stealing their junk.
---
yes. thats a thanks giving outfit. as i said could not fint much
---
This has been said several times. Those of us who actually care about this issue are NOT the ones who are bullying and targeting 1st members. You are simply seeing the loudest demographic, not the largest.
---
We hate this because it's about broken promises, lies, shady business tactics, and multiple severe bugs that are found within minutes of playing, yet were never addressed.
---
Want a list? here's a previous post of mine
---
"Its not about the private servers, its about them charging money for services that A. should've been included at the start, and B. Make the game easier for those who pay money. This goes directly against their promise when the game launched.
---
People wouldn't be getting this upset if this was the first time this happened, but in the past year we have SEVERAL issues like this happening, for example:
---
Releasing a game for full price, when it was so buggy that some quests couldn't even finish, broken textures, copied code from fallout 4 that included KNOWN bugs in it, etc.
---
Switching the canvas bag for a nylon, and then attempting to give a ($5) refund that's only in the atom shop, meaning it would go right back to them. It took a lot of pestering for them to give the actual product.
---
Doxxing those who sent in reports about said canvas bag bait n switch.
---
Nuka-dark rum was sold for $80 and it turned out to be in a cheap plastic bottle, not glass, and not worth the price.
---
Charging an absurd amount ($276) for a "leather" jacket that looked like it was made of tarp.
---
Moldy T-51b helmets ($150), I don't think I need to explain why that's bad.
---
Adding micro-transactions that allowed players to gain advantages.
---
**18 DOLLARS FOR BLUE. FUCKING. PAINT.** I shouldn't need to point out how that's an issue.
---
It IS actually bad, find a reason for why any of the above is not bad, i'll wait."
---
Just go to project paradise, encryptid, nuke prime, etc. People will be in need.
---
That’s a matter of opinion. I do love emergency protocols though. Good stuff.
---
IIRC, Bethesda announced they would try to roll out test servers. Unfortunately, I doubt they will have them up before Wasterlanders comes out, which is too bad.
---
76 has a decent story if you bother paying attention to it
---
There is a lot of speculation it was rushed as a stopgap measure due to cash flow issues at the corporate level between FO4 and Starfield/TESVI. Odds are we will never know for sure.
---
I wanted to giveaway Fallout merch and you literally told me they were not allowed...
---
How much will it cost?
---
Do you even software bruh?
---
Cool thanks
---
Haha, you'd almost think that was the case.
---
My point is to do what all reviews do, and influence people’s decision to do something.
---
since you're here, how about more info for some player morale? :)
---
The thing is, this was intended to be a survival style game, which most of them are lacking any main story (I mean, look at Minecraft - how deep is the story in that game?).  
---
Most of the story and interactions were intended to be with other people, that is where the conflict was supposed to come from.
---
wth?! i read about the hotfix that the bug was solved. but didnt read any information about restored scrap. and i didnt get any scrap restored.
---
yes i wrote a ticket at that time. even had a direct conversation with valseek.
---
will write another ticket... ty for the info
---
There is a Beta test, it will just be on the live servers and any feedback will be thrown out.
---
It's specific to the creation engine that the game runs on. 
---
If you're on PC adjust your draw distances and see if it improves.
---
I scream I to the void
---
And the voids reply’s back with a subscription service
---
"We don't need no stinkin' badges!"
---
No, I don't. Hense why I asked, don't be rude please.
---
did they fix the bug or did they also restore the missing scrap?
---
Your flair was a good story. But it’s simply about a betrayal. 
---
But choosing to murder my own son who is years older than me was a damn good story.
---
Ok, thank you
---
Sometimes we must sacifrixe for a bigger cause
---
no it was more eventually...
---
thanks my dude. I’ll give that a shot.
---
Thank you jester...
---
It's on PC too.  
---
It sometimes helps to click 'E' while hovering my mouse over the destination instead of clicking the destination with my mouse.  Other times, I have close and reopen the map a few times.
---
Come on, a full bag of dicks is way to much salt for any one person to consume, do you want them to have a hypertensive crisis?
---
No problem man.
---
It's almost super simple to find and fix bugs like that. I have been programming as a hobby over 10 years. Mainly top down and isometric games for fun but if there is a runtime problem like the 250 dr bug happening when you reload clearly a variable is being removed from the gun when the reload happens. The solution is to stick a line after each line of the reload code that outputs the weapons variables to a log and see where the variable controlling the each of the two effect is dropped. You'd find super easy where the effect breaks and then you can figure out why from that. The mere fact they don't do just that speaks to their abilities.
---
There is a lot of speculation that while 76 underperformed on sales, it exceeded expectations as far as ATX revenue is conserned. We'll probably never know for sure, but BGS may be happy with how *parts* of FO76 turned out.
---
You missed some holotapes and terminal entries from the sounds of it.  Her story takes you on the journey but they dont spoon feed you the story like you're 8 years old.  It's up to you how in depth you get into it.  Look around more when it takes you places even if it's a side quest.  You'll be surprised what you find in co.puters on scraps of paper and hidden on holotapes.
---
I thought the story was pretty good. Are you reading the terminals?  
---
We have multiple factions who had been attempting to survive and overcome this scorched plague that has destroyed the land since the nukes dropped. While piecing together their work we are able to carry on with that goal while also uncovering the true source of the scorched. Meanwhile there are like 25 or more side missions.
---
Look, until you go to college, get a degree in coding, work for Bethesda, find the bugs, and get told not to fix them, STOP FUCKING COMPLAINING. Just submit a damn ticket about the bug and leave it. If it's not fixed after the next patch, send another ticket. And so on. It'll get fixed eventually.
---
I got my overseer rank from 43 to 69. Not a big fan of NW i just want to get to rank 100 for the rewards and never go back lol
---
i came here to write this, it happens all the time. if anyone there was playing the game they would see this
---
You suppose correctly.
---
It's worth noting that *some* of the players behind 'Walls' or in buildings aren't actually using any cheating tools but rather *exploiting* lesser-known bugs or otherwise gaps in collision meshes / models. 
---
I won't spread the bad ideas but I've seen empirical proof that players can do this in specific spots without hacking.
---
As for Holes in the earth - never seen that before aside from going outside the map and past the collision maps.
---
If you are losing collision with the ground meshes in areas it seems to me that something is Borked in your files.  
---
Have you repaired your game files? You should try that and see if it helps.
---
If it does not - I highly encourage you to file a ticket *specifically about that* as /u/Ladydevann mentioned.
---
FWIW it helps from a CSR POV to keep your issues specific and focused.
---
Jesus Christ they added In a tab for fallout 1st get over yourself , they are trying to fix things
---
And not only find the issues but fix them.  Why do we still have so many known bugs?  Let’s not roll out another bug infested update.  Test then fix and test again to make sure not only did you fix the issues but didn’t create new ones.  Repeat until fixed and rhen release.
---
I did not know the loot history had a limit. This means that with the right farming route, you can loot indefinitely on the same day if you loot enough different things.
---
Fantabulous, thanks guys!
---
Maybe idk fight back and stop being a pansy.
---
 Unfortunately that is the most concerning part. They are a private company and that allows them to be as secretive as they want when it comes to things like whether the game is a failure or not. They can use the "underperforming" excuse to pump in more microtransactions while having the game be pumping out a hefty profit.
---
Anyone with a bit of knowledge/common sense knows that it doesn't make a difference on server stability to have 1 steel scrap or 10000 steel scrap. Even when you drop it it's just a number. It occupies no space, because it's not a physical item in the world. It's the same difference as if you named your gun Big Iron or Floccinaucinihilipilification. It just has more letters, nothing more.
---
I'm happy to see we're getting wallpaper with just plain colors. A lot of wallpaper actually. I guess it's easy and in high demand.
---
Yeah, I know a coder who helped me with mods I made for fo4. If you are good at coding you can make the creation engine do anything he said. 
---
He was able to make adjustments to the game and repack them into a .esp so there were no external assets so I would be able to upload them for ps4. 
---
That's how I made snow happen in one of my mods for ps4 which everyone said couldn't be done.
---
Yeah like everyone slamming it before it even comes out!
---
Honestly I really like the story in 76 I think it’s just how it’s told that people aren’t liking. Imagine if each of the major factions had npcs. They’ve been killed off by the scorched plague until only a few remain and its up to you to help. Each faction’s questline has a piece of the puzzle to prevent the scorched plague from overrunning the entire US continent. You can tackle each questline in any order you want but you’ve got to finish them all to finally rid the world of the scorchbeasts. 
---
With people to talk to, actual progress you can observe, and a final boss battle that accomplishes something I think it would have been great. As a single player. As a multiplayer with no living people to work towards saving and progress that’s reset every day it doesn’t have the impact, but it’s a good story nonetheless.
---
Looks like not much was added since the last update. Only the Thanksgiving Outfits and another variant of the Liberty Prime PA
---
they cant just hunt everyone a buff man
---
You're a charming fellow. I hope you have a wonderful day :)
---
New display?: [https://i.imgur.com/UWns64Y.png](https://i.imgur.com/UWns64Y.png)
---
Oh the fix is coming alright, remember the mod support for private worlds?
---
why? so you could ignore all but 3 star enemies?. 3 stars means probability. It's a shooter RPG online. There's RNG. If you don't understand then go play fortnite.
---
Most times - absolutely.
---
Yes, the list of settlement items from F04 I want in 76 is way too long to list, but hopefully some can make there way in. Some have been in the game build just not for us to use, like the scrap looking walls and roofs, they are all over top of the world, wish I could use them. Junk gates? Hell, yeah. The "raider" triangular canvas tents you see **everywhere** in F076, but we cant build, yet could in F04. A small one that is a personal beef, the xray image wall decor from F04, also in Morgantown airport: I want more medical items to decorate a responder camp, and they simply aren't here. No first aid boxes, the drugs sign with the pill, pharmacy signs, first aid signs, labratory equipment, gurneys, all in the game and would be awesome to decorate with. Seems like a big oversight to me.
---
Yeah 3 times isn't too expected, I'd be concerned about that too.
---
And PS4 isn't immune from hackers (in spite of what some people will tell you), though it's significantly rarer there than on PC. It might be that there's a hole that's exploitable without hacks that people are learning about, fortunately that's a fairly easy fix (once BGS knows about it).
---
I play on PS4 and have never experienced an issue with fast travelling... What is it?
---
i had about 5 people buy f1 from my 60 person friendlist. they played a week and either dont play or just play public now.
---
Por que no los dos. 
---
Fallout established itself as having really good story lines and choices with consequences to the character. 
---
Most of the stories in 76 are just investigations. 
---
What would be cool if you have the character try to solve to scorched problem ( one major quest was to just investigate the scorched) Here’s this solution that facilitates a quest. Then the solution is to glass the entire area or the scorched spread. The character is faced with, at least, a dilemma. 
---
Sure you help robots and creatures along the way. But this builds the stakes of the dilemma. You build and recover the area to progress the story, but in the end you have to choose whether to undo your work or possibly let the scorched spread. 
---
Throw in a side quest where you attempt to cure the scorched.
---
Loving the blue/white or silver handemade skin dam
---
cant argue....i read all the patch notes trying to see value...nothing applies to me :(
---
To be honest I'm too busy to look into programming being quite busy with life. 
---
Good to know though, I'll have to research into it. Some people just have more practical and technical skills.
---
Of course these little bug fixes are necessary but I just want to see their list of priorities in their meetings.      
---
"People still cant use their god roll 3\* weapon with 250 DR and the Jet pack blasts them into orbit!"    
---
"Yes.... but did you notice we used a slightly wrong shade of blue on the scrap box?"     
---
"....oh... my... god. SHUT THE GAME DOWN."
---
then don't play it? don't ruin the fun for others.
---
Little too much Communism in this update!
---
I made a long and boring [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dy0s6i/my_thoughts_on_fallout_76_live_service_and_its/) about my thoughts on how it is going to go from now on, but in short, I think resources are committed already, and adding some more was not happening, is not happening, and will not be happening because it is too complicated. Moreover, if revenue streams were supposed to be connected to the resources committed to the game, we could have seen a much bigger team and a lot more effort put in Fallout 76 long before the launch because that is the time when revenue expectations should be by far the highest.  
---
While I do acknowledge your position on that, mine is unchanged: no matter what happens, not matter how good or how bad feedback, reviews and playerbase are, the game will be supported as live service and there will be people playing it. I think they are sticking to the plan, at least as much as they can at this point, and will continue doing so.
---
Oh God I hope so. Display case skins are such an untapped money maker.
---
Worth a scroll but some new handmade skins in there!
---
/u/YungClancy
---
This is probably why they set it back to make sure they fix the bugs. Wastelanders wont make or break fo76 but if they pull it off it might get them some good publicity!
---
Few things (lol):
---
* AFAIK 'The Balance Pass' is a coming-in- 2020 thing
---
* Takes days to rebalance the weapon set / metas fairly across a 100% online-game.
---
* Player / Level Dependent  but I hear it's possible to speed-run and start the baby brewing process in a few seconds  ;)
---
This doesn't even include 
---
their "support", which has been seen to delete tickets rather often
---
"Private worlds aren't recycled" Its been documented that they are, even when people join it for the first time.
---
Banning someone who was reporting bugs. Did they use mods? maybe. Was it used for the sole purpose of finding bugs and reporting it to Bethesda? Yes. 
---
No official response to the Fallout 1st backlash, showing that they don't give a shit.
---
Adrenal Reaction, Marsupial, Speed Demon. Scaly SKin, Grounded, Healing Factor, Herbivore, Bird Bones, Eagle Eye are what I run on my Bloodied Commando.
---
so... nothing? things are bad when even the atom shop is lacking.
---
Final-fuckin-ly
---
Bethesda please make your art team play the earlier games and get them back on track to making items that look like they belong in the fallout franchise.
---
You guys are seriously turning this game into the worst aesthetically in the entire franchise with some of the choices being made.
---
Also it is an absolute shame that you are putting all these communist in without even having addressed the missing major factions yet. 
---
Where are the Enclave and BoS items? Communists get to fly their flags before the Enclave on US soil? Wtf is wrong with you?
---
Although I would love some buffs on weaker weapons this isn't a competitive game you don't have to follow the meta.
---
Abandon ship. Shotguns are hot garbage.
---
Thanksgiving in November.
---
What a wild concept
---
Non American here.
---
Lol
---
&gt; Bethesda should hire QA testers, not just exploit players.
---
Yeah but they are only good at one of these things, I mean you still need an unofficial patch for Skyrim since the devs never cared about the bugs and issues. Even though they keep rereleasing that game on new consoles and crap with the same old known bugs...
---
I don't think Bethesda ever used paid QA testers.
---
Probably why they didn't hype the patch up
---
This and the ammo weight perks on armor are worth their weight in caps. They are better than wasting perk cards on them and they effect all weapons and ammo you have in your inventory.
---
Says the douchebag raider
---
I like the solid wallpaper options, although it's too bad there aren't some photos showing how they look in the game itself.
---
Yeah, like you I took a bunch of months off.  And I come back to crashes I've never had before, and none of the things I'd hoped might be implemented.
---
What made me come back was curiosity about upcoming features.
---
The asshole that keeps spamming his garbage site to make people pay 15$ is going to get a seizure.
---
I love when there is pictures of stuff that's not available in game like the possum and frog mounts and the wood helmet.
---
News flash:  minor bug fixes and web page updates are quick and easy to fix, so they can come out faster and more frequently.
---
Most of the things (though not all) that were patched today are simple, easy to fix, 'give those to the new guy to take care of' kinds of things.  You can push out a ton of those in the time it takes to figure out one complicated issue.
---
Thank you! I already saw the post but its nice you thought of me!
---
Why they dont let us fix the bugs for them like fo4 or skyrim where we made our own patches to fix things they blatantly ignored it would improve quality 10 fold. I know on PC first thing I do in skyrim is download the comprehensive bug fix by the modding community so the game will start correctly.
---
Lol you're awesome.
---
Perhaps I missed a couple. It was engaging and sad that all you find are corpses. It isn’t out of pocket to find scorched who are turning. You have a lucid super mutant, non homicidal robots, and a lucid mole miner.
---
born survivor, field surgeon, Serendipity, scaly skin and Evasive or barbarian is all you need. if you die then you don't know how to avoid being hit.
---
If there’s gameplay bugs since day one they aren’t getting fixed because they can’t be fixed. Especially bugs that were in fallout4. They may have had people working on this since the beginning and found they can’t fix xyz bug without creating ten more.
---
Dear Willis, what are you talking about?
---
There is nothing great or fun left to do in game. When you get to a certain level and have done everything a hundred times, the only things left in game are base building and legendary gambling. We need lots of new content, hard endgame content to keep people interested. If Wastelanders isn't that, I don't know if I'll be playing for much longer after it drops. I'm level 270 on my main, have two 150 alts and all I do is wander around killing enemies I've killed a thousand of, do quests I've done 50 times before and collect junk I'm never going to use.
---
"I glitched the game, and then the game broke. Screw you game" -LukasKlouvis
---
Same issue, but if i go to the transfer menu, they are still inside, but as long as the camp budget and maybe stash are maxed i cannot get them out, i dropped some stuff from inventory and stash, and made some place in the camp budget and so i could take em out again, but because i need all the camp budget/stash, the artillery grenades will stay in the artillery box. even your workaround wont work because when the stash is full the grenades will remain in the box and wont be transferred to the stash.
---
Yes I think so-  [https://imgur.com/a/gjGCYxS](https://imgur.com/a/gjGCYxS)

"Fancy Thanksgiving Display Case"
---
When you call Bethesda's Technical support line, they will sometimes tell you to post your ideas on reddit, especially if it's about in game issues on public servers. It's stupid, and, trust me, I've complained on their after-call feedback survey. 
---
Now, do I know if this is policy or just individuals try to do their best to help? No, I don't know.
---
I'm a PS4 player. Will be online tonight (as I am most nights). My PSN is DragonRaider95. I'm level 163 and will help you for a run. Message me!
---
I don't know shit about programming. Like I said, it's common knowledge.
---
FWIW I enjoyed the Wild Appalachia quests a lot tbh. 
---
I would say the biggest quest disappointment for me was the burrows. Mostly because the level design allows you to essentially totally bypass the living spaces where everyone is.
---
I think they should do to the burrows what they did to the capital building - rework it - add a bit more narrative to BOS investigating the tunnels and buff the rewards - 3\* GUTTER PLZ
---
Put a comment on this post. Level 163, done nukes many times, PS4 player. You can join me and OP if you like.
---
It's not just mods, the code is fucked up. My unmodded dragon weighs 7.8 lbs, my weightless unmodded dragon weighs 2.4 lbs...
---
There are job ads for QA testers so they did at some stage.
---
Even if it's to hire the people who track bug notes here &amp; modders. So long as they're paid either way.
---
I posted a comment you can view as someone who's programmed for over 10 years. Read it? It's not hard to find and diagnose the cause of the dr bug. Almost as easy to fix it.
---
I wouldn’t care at all if we didn’t need the plan for a badge. But to not piss people off, maybe just change the badge so it requires this or something else that’s far more common?
---
Is your weapon explosive or not? Mine are and I wonder if it helps enemies detect me even though I'm using chameleon.
---
Delete the game are re-download it that fixed it for me
---
&gt;a bug free launch
---
&gt;on a bethesda game
---
Hell would freeze over sooner than that
---
Do you ignore 1 or 2 star enemies?
---
Will I lose my character?
---
Noo, that happened after I went to the fissure site and after the Queen had like 10% health 😭🤣
---
&gt; There are job ads for QA testers so they did at some stage.
---
Actually surprises me...they don't seem to fix many issues...I know they fixed some in this game but plenty still exist, many seemed to be server strain issues anyways which kinda needed to be fixed I guess.
---
Fortnite has a poplar type of videos called scammer get scammed so maybe Bethesda secretly copying them too like Battle Royale mode?
---
Its in the Display section of the CAMP so ill go with a strong yes! I just dont have the atoms to test it :(
---
Fusion cores are considered ammo, no other ammo works that way.
---
If you have a max INT build its like having 2x xp all the time
---
No but you'll loose you pictures
---
Making a public spectacle is making him some good ad revenue. Well played.
---
yeah the are is free pvp zone but during an event (retake or defend the workshop) the pvp is disable iirc, but still nothing stop them to put a bullet in your head the second the event ends lol
---
Idc about my pics. Just the character lol.
---
If you have it on disk it might be different
---
You're pointing out previously answered questions and using logic...get the pitchforks!
---
The Grim Reaper Sprint perk is still bugged and just does not work at all for myself and it seems a lot of others online
---
Attempted raid last night on lowest difficulty with a friend just for fun since never been inside. It was terrible all had was lag and terrible fps,so much so died and got kicked out so couldn't complete it.
---
Your characters ore on the 76 servers not your download
---
Being addressed? A lot of the fixes are like the lowest priority shit that you give to an intern to see to because it's so menial but not a lot if any serious issues have been addressed. Certainly not in Adventure mode.
---
Glad NW isn't being completely ignored.
---
Dying at the end of an event, when the respawn timer is still going off leads to the countdown finishing and the camera circling your dead body with "press a to respawn" only when you press a nothing happens
---
Taking a page out of the AAA developer handbook.
---
Lol he had a phone call with Beth and then they banned all the rest of his accounts but one - am i reading that right!?!
---
Whilst i'm sure there's plenty to this story that we don't know i do have to say they're handling this terribly.
---
I don't use explosive weapons because I don't have room to spare for demolition expert, I never really thought about it but it may well have an effect on detection, definitely worth testing out
---
Did any of the bugs found in the beta actually get fixed or was it all a promotional thing, including the part where pre-orders got 3 codes to invite friends for that one session?
---
Oh god so many wallpapers!
---
the golden one (non-scabber) has been in the files forever but hasn't been released for whatever reason.
---
Can you post a screenie of all the new things?
---
"Yeah, you heard me right, this car I bought brand new and drove for this past year: I want a full refund. It's not as good as I thought"
---
I still play since beta and i play it because i still enjoy the game and the community,  despite all the crashes, bugs, disconnects and the negativity from some people.
---
\*insert liberty prime quote here\*
---
A week's worth of grinding is well worth some fucking handmade paint... Thank Christ
---
There was a whole american themed week in July, just saying.
---
Coming from someone that has never played this game but has lurked in this sub since day one I’d be willing to participate in helping make this game better for the communities like this one that put their heart into this game and BGS. You all deserve to have the best experience possible with something with as much potential as 76. I avidly participate in Blizzard’s Public Test Realms every patch for WoW because I think it’s necessary to help point out flaws that can be improved upon to overall better the experience for everyone.
---
Or Bethesda could just hire me. I can code.
---
I just hate seeing what you all have to go through.
---
People do it at vening machines too. They drop the mine to bully you off the machine, or they try to use it to kill you and take your junk.
---
Looking at all the radios still playing and candles burning and food still set out I always got the impression I was like 2 days too late to save everyone and they had become scorched or been drug off to be converted into a Supermutant etc. I see the "empty" people always reference but it serves a purpose and helps tell the story.
---
And maybe I'm a dreamer or an optimist but I really like the empty feeling of the game because come wastlanders it will REALLY feel like people are returning to Appalachia. Very dynamic.
---
And yeah, I'm one of those people that really like the story so far and I'm excited to see where it goes whether Beth had this planned the whole time or not. I 🤷‍♂️
---
Do you think adding health to the stash box took many resources?
---
Love how you consistently write beta as an acronym... but why?
---
Just to clarify, this is all coming to the store? Missed out on Liberty Prime when it first came out, would love to get my hands on it. And that America hazmat skin!!! 
---
Either way, thanks for this! &lt;3
---
My god, charging for premium services, what they hell is wrong with him?  ^^/s
---
He does a nice thing, and you're here shitting all over him (him?  Her?  not sure actually).  Pinch your pennies all you want, but stop with the name calling.
---
I'm waiting for someone to 'Well Actually' my comment about speed running a baby.
---
For truth, justice , and the American way
---
Totally ignores the priority issues brought up in the post.
---
that’s about it. it must be that he preferably uses a higher level character so that he can get around faster which would result in faster spawn rates, then he reads that info from memory. it appears that spawns are influenced by player level, so leaving him with a low level account is probably bait to monitor what he does so that Bethesda can try to inhibit the practice.
---
Nope, not touching that one.  Saw that, veered *WAY* out of the way.
---
Um.... Don't step on the mines?
---
**They are giving us a free wallpaper** ***that isn't pink unicorns*****. Thats a big plus in my books?**
---
It's not competitive for you, it is for other people who enjoy pvp. Its been broken for almost 3 months now, and people are sick of it because Bethesda is doing nothing. They nerfed both tesla and stealthboy in NW. Why is it taking them so long to do this to adventure.
---
At this point you'll need the "B.E.T.A. Subscription" to participate.
---
https://imgur.com/a/oi3Kksx
---
Yeah that isn't Enclave or BoS.
---
i started to use big guns and i have a Gatling plasma, there is a bug in 1st person were sometimes the weapon start rotating like when you shoot but you fire no bullets, then another problem is that you can't aim first and then shoot, because it don't work (there are perks or effects that make you tanky while aiming), you need to fire normaly and then change to aim with the scope. i don't know if this is a scope problem or what...
---
When I left the game, I thought there was nothing great or fun left to do in the game, too. I was sure everybody is going to quit it shortly after me, but here you are, playing it 6+ months longer than I did, gained 200+ more levels than I did, done 30 times more quests than I did and collected about as much junk as I did. Now it is you standing on my spot saying things I had been saying half a year ago. If Wastelanders come as a disaster, nothing is going to change much for Bethesda and there will be another new guy standing on your spot.
---
98% of these were in patch 14 so i guess this patch is kinda dry on the atom shop stuff however the few things that they added with this one looks really fucking cool like that black handmade skin and the dark liberty prime PA skin
---
&gt; We need a small group of actual players to actually break it early
---
... except the thing is there's so many bugs in the base game; they don't need to draw up NDA contracts or get beta testers for a content patch; actual players are already actually breaking the game as it exists right now.
---
And you can very easily bet that they're going to get a ton of bad reviews just based on how buggy the game continues to be after more than a year of literally everyone telling them how buggy it is.
---
Bethesda sure is going hard with that communist shit...
---
That's the datamine, not what is actually available right now.
---
We need a Jesus of video games to die for our digital sins.
---
Lol, itz a big maybe

glad there are laws to prevent this type of logic to be applied to anything that actually matters.

“oh, your car is catching fire? sorry we cant fix that without also solving some other problems, good luck, carry an extinguisher!”
---
Yep. Totally agree
---
I did feel like wastelanders would bring alot of people back myself included but once the subscription got put out there I lost hope. I would not be surprised in any way if some part of wastelanders is locked behind the paywall. Im sure most of it will be free but wouldn't be surprised if they kept a few of the better things to the subscriptions.no way im putting more of my money into this game. hopefully im wrong but I have my doubts
---
This game absolutely has a story, it is just delivered in a different manner.
---
This is a good idea in a vacuum, but it's entirely wishful thinking. BGS couldn't possibly make it more clear that they are not interested in bug testing for this game. It's been well over a year since release and I honestly don't think there's been a single major update or feature release that didn't include prominent bugs (I believe this to be literally true, please correct me if I'm wrong. Other than very small hot fixes and tweaks, I don't recall a single major update that didn't come with awful bugs).
---
Your idea would be good for BGS and for the future of this game, but proper bug testing at ANY POINT since the original beta release would also have been a great idea, and they actively chose not to do it. I wouldn't hold your breath on this suggestion.
---
agreed, its pathetic, none of these changes will keep anyone in the game longer.
---
Many of the current bugs wouldn't take many resources either.
---
You will get it when those factions return to the wasteland in after wastelanders DLCs
---
Yes, I found it buried at the bottom of the CAMP section.  It's not in any of the Featured tabs.  About time they released a free basic option.
---
The Commie Prime armour skin has a very comic book look about it. 
---
Noticed a nee combat rifle paint in there too, it's a shame we can't apply those to Fixers.
---
the good thing is that i hoarded 200 ballistic fiber in the meantime lmao let's fix!
---
I'll only say alot of these features (survival tent) should have been in game already barred behind quests and not cash.
---

---
Don't forget to have a little sleep and play a little music before leaving the vault.  Apart from that you're right, there is nothing to do.
---
Both of those factions live on in Appalachia right now. In fact that vast majority of the player base is actively working for the enclave if they completed the main quest.
---
Wdym, the overseer scolds you if you don't nuke fissure site prime and brotherhood wanted to use the nukes but maxson made a big deal about it being the exact opposite of what the brotherhood stands for, the overseer makes it clear that she doesn't want to use the nukes but after seeing the state of Appalachia wants to use them , the story is pretty good in my opinion, better than 4 and 3 in my opinion
---
LOL - sage advice
---
probably more than you would think
---
why would a game, that requires you to craft aid and ammo, add in a checkpoint that resets your aid/ammo count?  where Destiny gives you the ammo you use, so topping you back off is easy and has no impact.
---
even if they did add one, do you think a reset to the same time you had will improve your clearspeed? the only thing that would change is if you learned the route better and a large loss of mats
---
It's a lot harder than you think, especially if you didn't help make the game. Try searching through thousands upon thousands of lines of code (which to most people looks like gibberish), and not knowing what section the bug is in. It wouldn't be fun.
---
lol,  nice typo :(
---
I'm not sure this is a great idea, this would end up being a PR nightmare for them as the bugs associated with alphas/betas would just play into the stereotypes of F076. The "look how broken this game is" posts/sentiment would overwhelm the positive parts of a wastelanders beta.
---
I think its awesome they delayed the dlc until its in better shape, lets us know they are learning from their mistakes. *Cough* **LAUNCH, NOV '18** *Cough*
---
That would be awesome. Reminds me of a mod for 4 that brings waves of ghouls in during rad storms.
---
Lil' late but appreciated none the less. 
---
It is on a featured page but you have to cycle through the tabs to find that one (there's an extra this week I think and it's hidden unless you press C)
---
Yeah they are, wtf is up with this. Is 76 playable in china?
---
There is not one living soul in that Enclave bunker...Modus Killed them all... BOS are all Dead too...
---
I took a look at it, I think it's pretty nice.  It doesn't have the bubbling that some of the other wallpapers have.  It looks like it would go well if you used it on a top half of a half wall with panelling on the bottom half.
---
100% damage or 50% damage?
---
It's in the featured tab, it was the very first item under the sales.
---
Except that's not the way that programming works. Changing the color on the scrap box is a 30 second fix in photoshop editing the texture (and those things were an eyesore, they didn't match anything). The 250 damage reduction problem more than likely is part of a bigger problem with how legendary effects stack and interact with each other and may need to be part of a bigger overhaul of legendary effects that needs to be done. Should they have fixed it by now? Absolutely, it's been months. Does that mean they should wait to fix all little things until the big stuff is fixed? Of course not. A company like Bethesda does not just have one team working on the same thing all the time. They have lots of different teams working on different things (as is evidenced by their crappy versioning reintroducing bugs from older versions). This update was probably just a bunch of minor fixes from their world design team who were cleaning up some stuff as well as a patch for their recently released Fallout 1st stuff.
---
When everyone gets a bonus, no one has a bonus.
---
glad to see the original menu video and music back, missed it.
---
excited for the tab marked free in the atom shop, tired of searching for giveaways
---
thx...like the matte black..might get that.
---
Liking the new paint for Liberty Prime and as I said in another post, the commie prime armour has a comic amusement feel to it.
---
Grow up
---
Of course a Check point Will make me run better next time... By the motivs you just said... Also do not need to run to all the raid again over one mistake...
---
or use 3rd person, works fine for me there. i find it harder to aim while firing but ey, aiming that thing gives me a lot of resistances xd
---
Updated fine for me on PS4
---
Thanks. Did they add anything else?
---
Ah sorry!
---
9000 posts about fixing the main menu screens.  
---
*Gets fixed*  
---
"When you gonna fix this other stuff?!?!?"
---
Wrong.. Like usual
---
If this fix can easily be taken care of while someone is waiting for their coffee to brew while another fix might take some actual manhours to figure out and fix, and your surprised they knock out some low hanging fruit before taking care of higher priority items, you've never worked a meaningful project/program in your life.
---
EH,  we never know.  This is basically the pool of stuff that they can pull on for the Atom Shop.  These are the photos you would see but for example, with the kegs, they've been in almost every major patch update since the summer and we've still never seen them
---
that would be cool!
---
That's the sting of truth, right there.
---
I wish there are monsters outside of locations.
---
Its too quiet
---
The weapon paints are nice, but I bet it doesn't work on the Fixer alas.
---
Modus absolutely is still functional and doing very enclave things.
---
The BoS is an idea that lives on in the players picking up their banner.
---
The fact that the free states are both a minor faction and 100% dead with almost no ideological relevance to the story going forward didn't stop them from making faction gear up the wazoo. 
---
There is no reason for them to not offer faction gear in the atomic shop.
---
Maps definitely drop raider and T series plans.  I’ve gotten them from Savage Divide and Bog maps.
---
I’ve also gotten very rare weapon plans, like the spear.
---
Are we ever going to get a fix for ghouls attacking while laying down on the ground? It's been months.
---
This is part of the Thanksgiving stuff, but was the only thing that interested me :)
---
The Shadow Prime PA skin looks good but still has the super annoying voice and sound affects from Liberty Prime.
---
https://i.imgur.com/dvcoUmP.jpg
---
You're right man we're being too hard on them I'll just scrip my TSE +250 Damage black powder weapons cause they can't get to it... Take care of more lights and eyesores please.
---
I have this issue in third person on PC all the time. Flipping to first person doesn’t fix it either. I have to do the shoot, wait for bullets, then aim trick in both modes.
---
So.... what do you think of these builds?

Same S.P.E.C.I.A.L points, just different perks.
---
Good luck on that. As some one that until they started doing things like repair kits and Fallout first and selling fridges was mostly supportive of Bethesda and Fallout 76, even I could see they made a lot of stupid mistakes that would just piss people off. I don't have any faith they will have learned from any of it since they haven't really displayed they had (they were going in a good direction for a little bit honestly... but seemed to have decided they got enough good will they can stop that).
---
Get me mod support and an experienced modder, he will take care of it in no time.

Lets trade systems lol.

that handmade skin tho

I do have the disk, all games i play if there is a disk i get it if possible.

Good idea. Would make day/night time more meaningful/impactful
---
If you stumble across his CAMP, avoid his vending machines inside at all cost!!!
---
He has a trap set up, were he closes doors behind you while you're in the vendor, then after you get out of the vending machine, he turns on a bunch of flamer traps that almost instantly kill you.
---
He then takes all the junk you just purchased, as well as anything else you might have had.
---
Don't believe me? Here's the proof...

Well I'm attempting to log on now, lets see if a bug pops up in the next .5 seconds like usual. Maybe i will be able to reliably trade with someone when i approach them, maybe I wont have a hoard of ghouls chasing me that are just gliding around still laying down, maybe I'll be able to kill a couple legendaries and not have their bodies disappear as i go to loot them and all the ammo I used for that legendary scorchbeast wont be for nothing, maybe things wont disappear from my c.a.m.p. randomly. 
---
Maybe.
---
Or maybe I'll spend another day trying to make this game worth playing and trying to convince my wife that she should load up 76 and not disappear into the (not reliable but sat least theres load points) fallout 4, or quite often hulu, because most times after dealing with these glitches for hours, a break is needed from anything bethesda for the safety of the PS4.
---
I have been programming as a hobby over 10 years. I understand and can work on multiple different languages mind you I have never worked in the creation engine at all.
---
Each piece of code is segmented in a way that makes sense.
---
Reload is gonna be a procedure or proc that is universal on all guns when you click x "reload" proc is called and then the reload happens line by line from the call. Variables written to I'd imagine the object (weapon) are checked for the reload and then it happens. The proc called for the reload is gonna be multiple lines but line by line in that procedure you output the weapons variable to a log and then before and after the reload happens you compare the line by line log of the variables to find which line of the reload code breaks the other two stars variables.
---
When i press triangle i go extremely high into the air
---
You're gonna have to help me on this one. Are you trying to be funny or be an asshole? Right now I'm thinking you're an asshole.
---
On a side note I've never once complained about the menus.
---
I think it's like 2 steel and 2 wood or something...
---
1800 atoms for a re-color??!? wtf bethesda.
---
Display case? Is it functional?
---
That's why I think this should be an actual beta instead of just a pre-order bonus with tens of thousands of players. I'm thinking a few hundred players that have to sign NDAs to access this B.E.T.A.
---
That... is both disappointing, yet helpful. I guess all we can do is hope. 
---
Either way, thanks! &lt;3
---
This was even supposedly fixed or supposed to be fixed at some point.
---
I distinctly recall there being mention of a default on for radios at some point in an official capacity.
---
Right now alls that means is its still down for matinence. Itll go back to normal when its up
---
The monthly subscription auto renews if you don't cancel.  I'd check if the yearly does or not so you don't get a surprise.
---
Outer worlds is where it's at.
---
First we need to make it so you can even tell the difference between night and day in game.
---
Yeah, but 2+ hours of no server crashes while they updated, thats almost record length.
---
And they can just drop their tent that has a stash box and scrap box
---
God roll and +250 damage resistance while reloading are two different things anyway. A 3* "god roll" wouldn't have that prefix anywhere near it (unless it was a harpoon gun)
---
It’s the principle of the the thing.
---
Possibly, but in the absence of information to the contrary, our best course of action is to plan to make the game better in the ways we are able. It may be wishful thinking, but I'm not losing anything by making a conscious choice for optimism.
---
Thanks Mr obvious
---
Its going to be another flop. What the fuck happened, Methesda?
---
Yes but only on the first shelf. The other shelves going up don’t seem to be.
---
The scrapbox should be for everyone. It's quite a huge fucking feature, Bethesda.
---
Didn’t realize some of them had water damage lol. 
---
Can you use wallpapers on the half wall? I’ve never tried tbh. 
---
That’s def a good idea.
---
There is a fusion core market?
---
I know. I've submitted my fair share of tickets and potential fixes, both through the community managers here and of course bethesda.net . If I was planning for this game to be dead in the water I probably wouldn't be playing anymore. Hopefully the next few patches before Wastelanders tidy up some of the outstanding bugs and in the meantime it absolutely couldn't hurt to have people testing to try to help the next launch go smoother than the last one
---
same
---
And how exactly do you plan on breaking it anyways?
---
During the beta it was called B.E.T.A for Break it Early Test Application, hence why they're saying B.E.T.A instead of just beta.
---
Really? Is that what you want for this game? They will add those fraction to the game in DLC... Players picking up banners is lazy and not fun at all... This game story Will progress beyond Wastelanders and Will probably be the Dead factions... Or New ones
---
It's funny they keep adding new backpack meshes but still hold back those that were datamined and never released from May.
---
That is a great idea, and an idea a number of developers use/have used that's worked in the past. Takes a little bit more work though, finding and sorting applicants, paperwork, etc and not sure they are willing to.
---
Because they already have a cutesy name for it and a listing on the Microsoft store for Fallout 76 B.E.T.A.
---
Considering how i only see aks in the pic i would assume your correct
---
I'm not saying we're not being too hard on them lol. It's been a year after release and there are still major bugs from day one that haven't been fixed. I'm just saying that fixing small bugs is still important.
---
And you can put those +250 DR weapons in a box with all of my limb damage melee weapons and my junkies explosive shotgun that miraculously heals enemies when it hits them. Maybe after patch 19 they'll be useful again lol.
---
By any means necessary.
---
Never ceases to amaze me that people gladly applaud how Beth has handled FO76 by giving them more money in their bullshit MTX store.
---
Yes, the ability to toggle of names is a huge thing for me. I have been asking for that functionality since launch
---
Great idea but this will NEVER happen :(
---
now there is a reason to lock camps. say bye bye to all the nice ppl that let you use their work benches when you are miles out from anything.
---
&gt;Also do not need to run to all the raid again over one mistake
---
you can make many mistakes and still recover even in expert, especially in dead in the water.
---
&gt;Of course a Check point Will make me run better next time
---
thats fine assuming you have enough time to begin with at each checkpoint. if you have 1 minute to beat a full room, your not gonna pass no mater how many times you reset at a checkpoint.  then you will have to quit out and re-run the entire thing again anyway. 
---
 but considering they are quite easy once you learn the pattern, and its a sub 20 minute thing, checkpoints are extremely redundant 
---
also for the love of god can we stop comparing raids to Destiny 's they share a name of the event, thats it.  thats like saying destiny raids suck because they are nothing like WoW's.
---
Don’t know how you’re going to destroy scrap boxes, but good luck.
---
That's a good idea.
---
I agree, it seems to lack texture compared to the other options.  I could see it working well in a shop or office-type setup though.
---
And gray isnt that bad of a color either so its a win win!
---
Thank you, comrade!
---
At least we can toggle them off, now we can ask for their name instead.
---
I think a blood moon event that occurs on the IRL full moon would be nice.
---
I haven't been to this Toxic sub full of whiney brats in three weeks....thought I would pop over and mine some salt.
---
Wasn't disappointed.
---
Sooo.... you don't actually have a plan to destroy the boxes, since you can't damage players camps.
---
No gag orders, Bethesda needs to release a near flawless Beta or "Alpha" if both turn out to be buggy messes then we know where their commitment is or lack of.
---
I agree a Beta is in order, breaking it, exploiting it isn't a guarantee that anything will be done about it, that's just wishful thinking, hiding that bullshit to a few 'committed' players or putting gag orders on streamers will show Bethseda's lack of QC and support of their product.
---
Yep!
---
Black handmade? Sweet
---
i think the golden paint that was datamined actually was the scrapper . I know it didnt look like that in the datamine but - some design changes between datamine and release has been seen in other cases . I remember  the stalkers outfit having the hood up in datamine pics while down on release.
---
Also fog machines should be left on.
---
Oh, yes, the Atomic Sale tab is shoved off on the far right, off-screen.
---
F to your lost ammo then, been there plenty of times
---
Even then I’d rather have faster reload
---
I like the map he did, but I think he should have kept it down until they treat him properly.
---
Congratulations. No one gives a fuck what you think.
---
I have some black powder weapons with the prefix, I'd consider the absolute best 3rd star for those weapons. Ever had a Quad weapon you have to reload individual bullets upwards of 30+ times? IMO the best 3rd star for those too.
---
Dont really care what you think of me personally.  There is a lot of noise and requests in here to fix stuff... and also bring new content in the game.  
---
No matter what they knock off the fix list there will be a thread like your complaining about what didnt get fixed... 
---
Shoot we had a whole patch of bug fixes and the 1st post under it was "only bug fixes and no new content... rabble rabble"  I understand to you that the 250 dr bug is your number 1 priority... but I know it doesnt effect me at all.  This seems just as minor or major as any of the fixes that get addressed on a given patch.
---
Pointing out that your wishlist wasnt addressed is not helping at all... and seems petty.
---
Nocturnal weapons would stop getting scripped...
---
It isn't just me, many people have been asking for BoS and Enclave faction items since the start.
---
And picking up banners is the whole idea behind vault 76. We are supposed to be rebuilding remember?
---
Well I wont complain. Of course the patch could have been better, but this one only improved the game; slightly, yes, but it did improve it. So far what they have patched do not seem to have broke anything else and the bug patches seem to work. Yes, things like that should be normal, but hey, I think Bethesda are starting to get it right. Perhaps we will soon get those bug patches everyone is waiting for, we'll see.
---
Is that middle one a handmade then? My mistake, I thought it was a combat rifle.
---
Still nothing on the spin up bug for heavies too.
---
I completely agree.  Wastelanders is either going to make or break the game for a lot of people.  That is the sad reality.  If it ends up being shit, there will be zero excuses.  They gave it a pretty big delay.  
---
They should let selected people test it out and provide feedback and suggestions based on what the community wants.  I swear Bethesda just does not listen anymore.  And for us less fortunate people, they should provide weekly information and teases in their Vault articles to keep us interested.
---
Ghouls have been attacking while laying on the ground since patch 10 or 11. The game initially didnt do this and its STILL not fixed. Not all of the issues are from the base game. 
---
Favorites still unequip as well. 
---
Why are these so hard to include.
---
Yes you can.  I actually like making my trashy camp look like I gathered all sorts of stuff from all over the place and built it. So I have a mis-matched of water damaged wallpaper, brick walls, and the factory/metal walls.
---
You can even pull off some studio style houses by using foundations, using the foundation ramp up, setting up foundations, and then putting half walls on the lower level.  Taken to the extremes you can even get some double walls in that look like interior walls that way.
---
Np. You can come try and destroy mine. I’ll sell you back all the ammo you’re going to waste.
---
Hello!
---
Totally agree... Wastelanders will make or 75% Break Fallout/Bethesda. I'll still play if it fails as I've got a mountain of Camp Ideas.
---
But something like this should be incorporated for a December update. Allow a couple of dozen players (all over the world) to try different combinations of actions to determine what does and doesn't work.
---
They've delayed Watelanders... and if it ain't worth it... well ain't they budgeted.
---
Yay
---
Yes I bought it and it holds six items. 2 on each shelf. I think it's pretty cool
---
I'll leave a second one out just for you.
---
Does 76 hold the record for bughiest game of all time?
---
I've been loathing the disappearing leggos for days now. That should have been foxed.
---
Think off it like destiny 2, you can delete the game and get it again later with all your data on it cause it's saved to your account
---
Now we see the real reason survival was taken out.
---
Yeah, since we have an overlap between the "Get off my lawn" and the "Thanksgiving stuff" right now
---
Yeah I’ve seen that option. It’s a silly misstep. I hope they make the jet packs function at least before fixing that part.
---
I feel we need more ghouls. Or a new ghouls type that infests Charleston called drowned ghoul
---
Democracy doesn't give money, capitalism does.
---
Even without damage perks can I deal considerable damage? shotgun/rifle?
---
it should be, they had stuff placed in it in the ATX Datamine
---
So they can drum up a few more sales? No. This shit needs to be public, Beta or otherwise, people need to know what is going on past, present and future for something they are putting their money towards.
---
What's wrong with leaking shit or gossip about broken mechanics, exploits, bugs, etc.? Obviously, Bethesda no longer stands by their product and you...still defending Bethesda.
---
Wastelanders is going to be shitshow like the rest of FO76, you want to protect it until the last minute...for some reason.
---
I'm on Xbox One, and sometimes when I use my jet pack equipped armor (X-01) I either infinitely ascend, so that a single use of the jet pack lets me rise hundreds of feet into the air, or I sort of half-hop a foot or two off the ground while my AP drains and then I crash into the ground as if I fell from a much higher height.   
---
The first bug is sorta fun, and more rare in my experience. I've maybe had it happen 5 times in the last few months.    
---
The hop bug happens more often and is extremely annoying, especially if you are trying to navigate difficult terrain by accurately jumping, or if you are being hounded by enemies and trying to evade them by jumping.   
---
Another irritating aspect of the bug is that it seems to trigger when you are just trying to jump regularly i.e. not using the jet pack at all. I've become stuck on rocks and downed trees when jumping, because the hop bug kicks in and then I slam into the ground and have to wait through the whole power armor landing animation before I can continue on.  
---
If you have a pack of Glowing Ones beating on you while you fake super hero land it can ruin your day.  ;)
---
Fixing the color of the stash box is, and I could almost argue this as fact and not opinion, unimportant. Regardless of how long it takes.     I would let them keep every single bug fix they did today for the jet pack to work properly.
---
It's a simple yay or nay, brother.
---
Maybe we can finally get a *free* wallpaper. Nah, who am I kidding.
---
Yes, and I’ll hit you with a logical reason:
---
Quest items and keys can accumulate, specifically battle bot keys.  If item bloat is a concern, then you can have more keycard “items” than junk items, negatively impacting server performance.
---
I’d prefer 1st junk stash to be account-shared, so I don’t have to move it all and take risks when I switch characters (usually play one for 10 lvls at a time).
---
It would be too much for them to create something new screenshots :-/
---
Ohhh that's looks nice but we can't get it yet?
---
I have, and i make a list of these things, ive been programming since the 90s, and I would never release such an unfinished piece such as this game, my programming teacher would have lashed me and kicked me out.
---
Yes, awesome to deal with the little issues, but what big list item did they fix? Last big patch they couldnt even roll out right and we got 2 crappy things and the rest was "postponed". Would love to see the roll out and flow charts for the issues that they are so quickly working on getting to us. 
---
I mean I can live with so many of these bugs, but those antennae on the alien vault girl head randomly displaying black almost ruined the whole game for me.
---
So, ok, kudos. To Beth. for barely fiixing stuff that should have worked before ever being released. Kudos to them on dealing with things that barely even affect most functionality of this game.
---
Im glad they are dealing with the little things, but what big priority thing was dealt with in this patch, what thing to keep peiple around did they do? PVP/NW still going to be broken, camp items will disappear for no reason or cant be placed for some reason. Legendaries will still disappear, invincible sleeping enemies will still glide across the map and try and kill you, and when you see a third or 4th nuke in less than an hour, just lobby hop because you know the server is going down.
---
I'm a 1st subscriber and it's amazing how much less inventory management I have to do with the scrapbox around.  It's a great quality of life change that I definitely feel should be available to everyone, not just 1st subscribers.
---
EZ pass never physically looked or checked their servers when i hooked them up, lmao
---
Nay
---
Honestly, some completely fresh pairs of eyes would probably be a great idea if BGS did decide to do something like this. Who those of us with more playtime than we probably should have know how to break the game in its current state, a completely new player would probably play it differently than its established playerbase.
---
Still no mg42 skin  ? Laaaaaaaaaame
---
I like the more immersive kind compared to the bright and clean.
---
You haven't addressed the biggest bug: Your criminal false advertisement when you lied to me in order to make me buy your "game".   
---
Thumbs down.
---
PS: Hahah, you can't ban me here.
---
Duly noted!
---
has someone datamined patch 15 already?
---
Few bugs were fixed in the first B.E.T.A. because it was mostly to troubleshoot server side stability issues and promote the game.
---
How many times do you need to revive?
---
fixed in 2020 then ?
---
wtf
---
thats what mentels are for
---
I think you may like they grey - while it's not dirty - ***it is*** the opposite of the bright and clean ones you are talking about.

Do you even play or even own F76?
---
I’m pretty sure captainoob did a test with an AA plasma rifle and it was working
---
if i had to guess its probably gonna be the ranger outfit with the armored shoulder pads
---
yay from day one.  
---
nay right now, would be unfair to fallout 1st subscribers.
---
Oh you can earn atoms in-game, and never spend a dime on the store.  You may not learn this fact from YouTube.
---
The first set of 3 is still the best imo. So many ways to make it fit and not look out of place.
---
Oh look, it's the wood armor mask that isn't actually in the game! (Along with the Marine armor helmet console players still can't get)
---
Less buggy would've probably been a better way to put it. In another time I would've said that's part of the char, but with their first foray into online gaming maybe they can start to mix up the formula a bit.
---
^ +1
---
Yeah its either that or desert Im thinking as well 
---
Wonder if we’ll get cooler stuff down the line
---
It's definitely working
---
Fair fair
---
I believe that everyone should have gotten a 200 or 300 lb limit scrap box. First members get unlimited. 
---
I think everyone should have gotten a fridge, and skins should have been sold in the shop. 
---
Bethesda could have probably made many more people happy if they took care of both ends of their player base at once.
---
it could be both to be honest they did that last month with the normal ranger outfit and then the riot skin for it
---
I really don't care. I enjoy the game without 1st and don't think I would enjoy more with 1st.
---
I understand. I think that 1st has other things that still justify the purchase for those who want it, and if the scrapbox was made available to everyone and that's the only reason they paid... well, they can save money!
---
I'd rather take 15fr for BP weapons anyway. Honestly Bethesda just needs to remove 250drr from the game entirely IMO.
---
Why do you have to play meta? Why can’t you change it up?
---
Understandable ✌
---
Ah good point, if both I might actually consider it just to have it for wastelanders
---
Anyone know why this patch is 5GB for me and 79GB for my friend?
---
You are probably right. They are taking a rather extreme approach when it comes to MTX.
---
Not dependant on Wastelanders for me. For me, it's dependant on how much the game improves on a technical level. Bugs, glitches, lag, latency, server issues, performance issues, latency, etc. If all of that is improved, Wastelanders only has to be semi-decent and the game would be a success for me.
---
Yeah, it was totally because of the potential of 1st subscribers, and not because it was a waste of resources for a mode insufficient players were using because most people don't want to PVP
---
The only reason that this change was made is so that people stopped making scrapbox forts at workshops making them immune to any damage when other players came to claim the workshop from them.
---
Because the entire purpose of the alpha/beta would be to fix those issues before launch? If transparency is the concern maybe have the NDA expire a week before launch. A public beta will have the same issue where the devs are inundated with tickets that never get seen or get seen by a third party support servicer and may or may not get to where they need to go.
---
This game has uniquely earned large amounts of criticism and been the subject of multiple, highly visible, and completely fabricated controversies.
---
I got scammed for 30$ I agree to not allow "requesting real money posts for (enter sob story here)"
---
I have not had this problem yet.
---
I have had people coming to the SQB battle, leaving the event and then jumping in the way of your shots to initiate PvP.
---
Worked for all my various gatling lasers and plasmas. I wrote down hit numbers for multiple legendary prefixes at full health before and after the patch 13 (both legacy and current variants) vs lvl 48 &amp; lvl 68 super mutants and all things received a noticeable damage boost from the stabilized perk. AA prefix boosted that vs a vanilla weapon even more (so both stabilized perk and AA work after patch 13).
---
The would probably do a "BETA" 3 days prior to launch.  Such an amateur move.
---
yea im probably gonna reup either way
---
As a sub i can say definitely yay.
---
Nothing and nothing
---
Is the Matte Black Paint applicable to already existing Handmade Rifles? I ask this because they've screwed up in the past and made some skins be different weapons that you have to craft and can't apply to already existing weapons.
---
The free wallpaper is nice, though.
---
And do what with the weapons that have the prefix already? Broke forever?
---
I would probably buy fallout first every now and then if it wasn't for me not wanting to support the scrapbox (and tent to a lesser extent.)
---
I say Yay.  I only care about the private server.  I don't even care about the tent (though I've started to use it more).  
---
Of course I still want a box to move stuff between characters, but I can effectively do that now without risk with private servers, so just give us a box for it already too.  I think that can replace the stashbox.  It's a nice to have item but nothing anyone else couldn't still accomplish with friends or a little work.
---
As a fallout 1st member: YAY
---
I believe he's being sarcastic
---
But that'd defeat the entire purpose of a beta, no? People are playing it to fix bugs and balance issues, not review the game. A near flawless beta isn't a beta at all. An alpha is playable, but incomplete and a beta is complete, but not properly tested and ready for release.
---
Disregarding how Bethesda handled their first "beta" an actual beta is needed so the actual release can be "near flawless" expansion.
---
I saw this, asked nicely for you and your wish is their command.
---
Be careful what you wish for... They'll do this, and then make it only for current subscribers of fallout 1st...
---
Bethesda: "Oh you want access to the test servers? more money please!"
---
This a million times over. I'm a first subscriber as well and it's amazing how much more fun the game is with it. It's a total game changer.  The rest of the stuff can stay behind the subscription as far as I'm concerned. The tent is convenient, but not a big deal, the outfit is ok if you want to pretend you're in a different game and the dances, well I did them once, got annoyed by the looping music and turned them off. Private servers were always going to cost money, anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. At the least, they should add the scrapbox to the atom shop where people can get it with free atoms they earn.
---
Yes.
---
What we really need are more perk points. There are so many cards that would be fun to play with but since the vast majority are used to manage carry weight and efficiency they literally never get used. 
---
I'd love if we got one more special point every ten levels after 50, up to level 76.
---
No one I know even bothers picking locks or hacking terminals. Half the cards are completely useless. 
---
A few more slots would negate the need to have to go in and swap load outs every time you repair or harvest of magazine hunt.
---
Yes, I'm a 1st subscriber and I think the Stashbox should be available to everyone because it makes the game's core loop that much better.  But I would say, if they ever did this, I expect something in return.  Like Private Servers that hold more than 8 players. 😋
---
My rank 2 lunch of the draw procs consistently
---
it'd be a fallout 1st only tho.
---
Sure! How about another two day "beta"? Will that do?
---
That'll give them all the time they need to find all the bugs and ignore them.
---
Yay free wallpaper
---
Grats dude!
---
Thank you for the info, so you would say that it's pretty worthwhile to use AA energy weapons? I dont know how many enemies have ER, but I guess it's enough to make the effect useful?
---
I'm curious, because I was totally unaware of this change and have commented to others with what I now know is bad information. Im trying to educate myself so I'm not continuing to give bad info.
---
Armchair Devs are my favorite devs /s
---
More resources than it would take to add the missing ma keyword(s) to robot armor, bug which has been in the game since B.E.T.A.
---
More resources that it would take to fix that and certain linings on the upper limbs being broken and having no effect whatsoever.
---
And yes, I know this because I know exactly how this is done.
---
We have private servers, now please lets have proper mod support so I can start fixing this and other 100 things that I know exactly how to fix, at least for my private server.
---
It would be nice if they focused on fixing the stuff that is not easy to fix, like the CTD when using consumables for instance.
---
I'd be happy to fix the rest for them for free. Like it has been done since FO3. Because we are that fucking nice.
---
What energy weapon glitch, if I may ask?
---
The broken stuff SHOULD overwhelm the positive parts. The game needs to be completed and functional on a technical level FIRST, then we can get into the new content.
---
Probably the first
---
I’m positively affected. I’ve been trying to break my armor for 2 weeks so I can go berserker. Took me until today to find out why my armor isn’t degrading.
---
We can, I have it now
---
I can't believe how people are so hyped for a black skin on the handmade.
---
It’s crazy that people still think the tse nerf wasn’t needed
---
And they drop tridents?
---
Okay, but I guess I'm more looking for info about damage calculations and how it works. 
---
Does it only affect energy resistance? Does this mean it only provides usefulness against enemies with ER? Are there enough enemy types with ER to make it useful?
---
I'm trying to educate myself because I've spread bad information recently, and wish to correct that.
---
I always love the idea of giant lumbering enemies. Imagine seeing a rad storm brew and in the distance a giant monster approaching your way.
---
"They legitimately need a QA team."
---
FTFY
---
Keeping up with the Datamines at least lets you know to save your Atoms if you see something you really like.
---
We actually got a grey one for this week. it looks pretty cool.
---
No they wouldn't. They're in line with the damage of a two shot weapon at night. Almost any other weapon would still be better.
---
Ooo.  I might actually want that.
---
Based on usernames I see playing in New Zealand you’ll be in the pool with Japanese, Chinese, Korean, SE Asian and Aussie players. As well as Kiwis obviously. Assuming you don’t have to use a VPN to connect and then you’ll be playing with wherever the VPN is pretending you are- Botswana or Bolivia or Bosnia or whatever.
---
why? the last b.e.t.a. surreeeeeeeeeeeeee helped the game to launch as bug free and as stable as possible ;-)
---
Isn't it just like steel and wood and only like a couple of each?  With infinite junk capacity can't they  just build like 3 dozen more and not even care?  Not seeing the point here other than some people think being a bully is good sport.
---
Yep, paid for the Tricentennial edition only for it to be on sale weeks later. Stopped playing awhile ago because the updates have made it progressively worse, as if that were possible. And yet Bethesda feels that I should not only give them money to buy things in their incomplete game, but that I should also pay them monthly for features which should've been there at launch? Fat chance.
---
Ah ok this makes sense
---
It'd be nice if they fixed the "missing required ammo" bug on loading into a new server.  Every time I load into a new server I have to un-equip my equipped weapon and re-equip it for it to recognize that I actually have ammo.
---
I love running nukes I've only done 4 but solo and was very easy for me.  Im out of key cards add me GenomeNinja. Getting on after update completes.
---
Well i guess Bob and Ed (i don't think there is a third person working on bug fixes) now fixing all the small and easy-to-fix stuff (plus atoms shop and Fallour Worst) instead of real, serious stuff. But hey, they can present a long patch note at least serveral weeks after the last patch....
---
Ohhh, that sounds fun. Gives a good reason to enjoy/fear storms, I like it
---
Had to read it two times as well. At first I thought they were reaching out to him to admit their mistake and reinstate his accounts but nope, apparently that's not how Bethesda handles things.
---
Liberty prime PA skin is now live, yes.
---
I like how it is very fitting with most camp stiles.
---
lol this is actually pretty funny. The one guy who wants his armor to break couldn't do it.
---
Go fucking play fallout 3 then christ...
---
Go away
---
Default on when you place them now
---
only -5 points? I'am dissapointed...
---
I bow before your awesome persuasion powers. And it's not even ugly either. Any chance we can get a free mini-fridge in the next update? ;)
---
We can hope though, and something tells me a good portion of the remaining FO76 playerbase is comprised of optimists.
---
I'm well aware of that. How much game time would it take to bug everything currently in the store though? Basically every pay to win game let's you earn in game currency in game, doesn't change the fact that just shelling out real life money is the fastest, easiest, and most practical way to unlock everything... especially as all that "free" content additions we were promised seem to be in the form of Atom Shop crap.
---
The content you ask Will come, just not Now, will come when those dlcs are closer just like the tons of Raider stuff before Wastelanders
---
There are plenty of communities on ps4 that are dedicated to lfg
---
Wow! so many information, helped me a lot, do you run any perks for LMG damage?
---
Well... It means AA is as useful on energy weapons as it is on ballistic. Whether it's nettet better than other prefixes, that's up to you to decide.
---
I prefer flat damage boost from bloodied or junkie's. Then I'd prioritise "extra fans vs x". Then furious... Then double... You get the idea 😛 I'm not really a fan of AA, but that has nothing to do with the weapon type itself.
---
I’ve got 5 god roll berserkers weapons and I’m tired of just running through everything in bloodied. I’m trying to make the game more of a challenge, but I still need those perks from the armor just not the DR.
---
500lbs for everyone.. infinite for fo1st subs...
---
Unfortunately true.  I carry a shotgun to cripple ghouls in vault 94, but that’s it.  My shotgun build is now my mule.
---
Don't need to be a dev to see his ridiculous a bug as small as this existing for a year has been.
---
I do think they really need to check their priorities when it comes to bug fixes.
---
Yeah, as long as it’s not a server-based or time-based lockout, you can go on a loop of gathering like 200+ items and should be able to indefinitely cycle. 
---
To be honest, by the time I’ve done my normal farming route I’m ready to actually earn some XP, so I haven’t tested to confirm specifics, but the person/group that put that guide together did solid testing, so I trust it.
---
the raids themselves need checkpoints and the timer removed
---
and nerf the god damn spawns jesus
---
you are assuming they care about putting the time and resources into fixing it, there is nothing in their history to suggest that. they are just going to put out what they put out, with 0 testing, and try to continue to ride the hopes of fallout fans
---
If you cant remember, its time to give NV another play.
---
It's been over a year. Yikes. Bethesda Austin sucks at development. Not allowed to speak the truth?
---
Its a 20 mins walk in the Park for someone who does ráids all days...
---
Broken legacies. Yep.
---
The "community" can't have it both ways .. Either Bethesda does it doesn't listen to your requests.  
---
According to the typical "community" post, Bethesda doesn't listen.
---
Anyway. Is it was just an idea for discussion... Whatever. Just seemed like the original post target audience was specifically Bethesda.
---
It's telling that you don't know what a breakpoint is.
---
How about some Quality of Life changes? Like being able to set your NW build anytime.  The 2 mins before a match thing is pretty bunk, esp when youre swapping stats and your perks get reset.
---
🤷‍♂️Legacy weapons 🤷‍♂️ which can be fixed in the future, similar to AA on energy weapons
---
I feel like I addressed that in the OP, though. An optimist would say the original stress test/ B.E.T.A. was to test the servers and improve stability, while a pessimist might attribute Bethesda's actions as a marketing ploy. Either way what I'm proposing is fundamentally different in that it is a traditional alpha/beta test.
---
&gt;It means AA is as useful on energy weapons as it is on ballistic...has nothing to do with the weapon type itself.
---
Thanks, that's basically the answer I was looking for (whether or not that was the case)
---
I got my friends in fo76 through teaming up with them and friending their PSN
---
I’m down to help out but I can only play on the weekends atm.
---
Adding health to the scrapbox was incredibly important.  
---
Previously you could take a workshop, and then build indestructible walls making it impossible for anyone to challenge you inside.  Imagine this at a location like the Ammo factory were every entry could be blocked out by the walls.  
---
This is an important fix that affected both 1st and non-subscribers.
---
The way that NW is set up is that all of your SPECIAL stats are set to 0, except for one stat that is set to 1 - I can't remember which stat. As a result, each player has 60 AP, which is almost nothing. That's why you can't run very far in NW. If you start making jumping cost AP, then people will essentially be forced to walk and become sitting ducks. This is why Bethesda wisely chose NOT to make jumping cost AP in NW.
---
I also did explain why I am defending Frog Legs. The map is not flat. There are buildings, mountains, vehicles, walls, rocks, trees, and other obstacles to overcome. In the real world, we might be able to climb a mountain, climb a wall, etc. In Fallout, no such mechanics exist. Implementing a dozen different mechanics to handle different obstacles is impractical. Instead, Bethesda gave us a catch-all solution: Frog Legs.
---
They changed it a few months after the game came out. It used to hit constantly. Now it’s rare and a waste imo.
---
true i suppose but kinda dont see that happening.  I kinda think the B.E.T.A "test" was nothing more then a pre-order gimmic.   apparently one of the main reasons fallout 76 isnt so hot was that it was made by the B Team not their A- Team.  when you have a problem when no one else is around and the A Team is busy with Elder Scrolls VI...then you call the B Team.
---
They should have just changed regular scra boxes so they worked the same way. Instead of lying about the limitations of inventory management
---
Free wallpaper!?
---
Yes - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dyn5qc/atx_datamine_november_19th/
---
Cool new stuff. Very unfortunate it will all cost money (and spare me the "you can earn atoms for free" Bullshit, i don't have time to grind weeks for this).
---
(any addicted gained cannot be attributed to the kawa inn)
---
YES &lt;3
---
The wallpaper bundle is that on sale? Been waiting
---
Do you play Nuclear Winter, because if the first thing you do right after the reset is join a Nuclear Winter Server this problem will occur. The only work around that I have found is to go into adventure mode servers first. If you don’t play Nuclear winter, I am sorry but I don’t have any workarounds to try and help you.
---
I thought they handled the repair kit thing well, making it accessible to all just in a slightly different way. 
---
It's kind of ashame because I understand any game like this does need a flow of cash to continue to make updates and pay a staff, but they just keep missing the mark on what the actual community wants. 
---
I've seen the same repeated requests for things over and over and yet they come out with atom shop items no one wants or needs. They paywall and exclude part of their base when they could easily make both free and pay players happy. It's kinda boggling. 
---
The survival tent is an amazing First perk to have. They could have also given free players a second travel point with just a sleeping bag and cooking pot. Both bases happy.
---
Most likely elite riot or something
---
Happens to me as well and I do not EVER play nuclear winter. So it's absolutely not 100% tied to that.
---
they did not have QA testers for original release, it was very clear by many obvious bugs and the face that they werent aware of most of them until the players told them
---
That is kinda how programming works though, as a lot of logic is dependent on other values to function properly, and if you make/fix a small deviation in one, say add 1 additional character than it needs, it could drastically alter others.
---
Some were absolutely right, but there have unfortunately been several instances of small rumors becoming generally accepted "fact" that has no basis in reality. There should not be content released admonishing an expansion 3 months before release. I highly doubt there will be an influx of new FO76 purchases unless extremely good reviews of Wastelansers come out. It's not about avoiding transparency, it's about letting the beta be an actual beta where finding bugs isn't admonished but celebrated as that's one more that can (hopefully) be fixed before release.
---
I've noticed something similar, that I think is related to the grenadier perk. Doesn't just effect grenades!
---
Thanks!
---
free wallpaper!
---
And the original version came with two color variations for the same price lol
---
You can also fast travel to your camp and sometimes it takes you to the tent.
---
The only perks i use in luck are Bloody Mess, Serendipity, Class Freak and Starched Genes. Good with Salt is nice to use when collecting fluxes
---
Hey u/Ladydevann can this get addressed as this is still happening, had friends that couldn't join my private server as well, also couldn't join a fellow subscribers server on my friends list last night
---
I gotta say I wouldn’t mind a big grizzly beard.  It would fit the chewed up, dirty aesthetic I like.
---
It would also be nice if the graying hair option looked better. It just looks like an overall 85% gray instead of being salt and pepper or gray at the temples.
---
Overall, hair and face options seem to have been reduced in quality in 76. My guess is it’s performance related.
---
Launch veteran and even I didn’t know this
---
Seems they cant win with you all "Bethesda fix your buggy game" *Fixes Bugs* "No! You fixed the wrong bugs"
---
Yeah... opinion. I don't use marsupial because it feels like a cheapo console command and looks ridiculous. Gives practicality to the jetpack as well. If only they would actually fix it lol.
---
I would much rather fix this game if is all the same to you.
---
You will still have the choice to play the broken version if you so desire, no one is going to put a gun to your head and make you install bug fixes.
---
I’d stay with the commando build as all you have to do is swap your current rifleman cards for commando cards
---
The kawa inn will be waiting
---
also maybe worth noting that legacy explosive energy weapons seem to bypass fireproof and dense. i would say that makes aa a bit less desirable for those since you can use a more damaging version, but my understanding is that the aa effect on explosive energy weapons *is* particularly desired because of the damage cap in pvp.
---
i think the other poster answered your basic question, but worth noting that the legacy energy weapons have their own thing going on in some ways for pvp if you are into that sort of thing.
---
I’ll do my best. ;)
---
I sure hope so too
---
Early on in the game, yes.
---
Shotgun is crazy in early game, and if you use non-automatic rifle, you should pair it with stealth.
---
But well Melee is all good so you can just go PA 2H melee for easy mode.
---
"I could have impregnated my wife and had another baby at this point."
---
Fallout 76, it just works\*
---
\*But slower than making babies
---
Bingo. That's what I missing . Not everyone has 9 agility. Not everyone can ise frog legs. And for 10th time I'm fine with it for travel. They use it in combat. And no, costing ap would fix it. It should have a cost for super jumps. You have zero cost . Dude just stop. It doesn't belong.
---
I play nuclear winter, but it is not the first place I go after reset. I always go to adventure mode first.
---
more than 20 minutes is mission failed...
---
If you were hungry and your mommy laid a plate of shit in front of you, would you eat it with a smile on your face?
---
Ya that is definitely a problem, wish I could help
---
Yeah I kind of assumed I would need to use a VPN but I was just wondering if maybe there is any people out there that had an opinion on it no. Thanks for the reply!
---
I doubt they'll fix legacies before they remove them.
---
fo1st deluxe green house coming soon
---
Or, you know, how many people are hyped that Bethesda gave them the privilege of spending more money on an incomplete game.
---
Amen to that.  There were multiple variants of the styles we’ve seen already, and it’s like they forgot they put them in the game.
---
Yay, fo1st players already get plenty of bonuses for subscribing (the atoms are worth it alone), and its in no way going to effect performance
---
Yup.
---
&gt;Glowing +Damage based on irradiation
---
how to make bloodied even more broken
---
The weird reason why i dont see this happening is that bethesda prefers suprising us with content and its contents rather than delivering quality tested content.
---
At first i really enjoyed the game (due to the aqesome community) but shit like this just makes me want to play other games that possess a better experience
---
That's really good to know as well, I really appreciate the input.
---
I have an AAE laser rifle as my main pvp weapon, and I know anecdotally that it absolutely shreds, but I always thought it was the armor penetration on the explosive aspect, combined with demo expert.
---
This company is hopeless, they never focus on shit that matters. Fixing random garbage that has no impact on anything that anyone pays attention to while ignoring the real bugs that hundreds of ppl complain about every week....BGS having their head up their ass is an understatement....they are the entire ass and never had a head to begin with. Pretty sure they just want the paying fanboys to continue playing, they never complain and always praise everything.
---
Exactly, I can only assume it's children. Rich Parents will pay for whatever the kid wants.
---
Give the scrap box to everyone or remove scrap weight in the stash to a minute number you greedy fucks.
---
Watch it not happen. If I had money to bet, I'd bet on it not happening.
---
Almost feels like false advertising don't it, lol
---
They will never revert TSE deal with it
---
because you can't nerf adventure pvp without nerfing the pve portion as well. and nobody likes pve nerfs.
---
I thought it was gonna be a They Live watch that teleports me without taking my caps.
---
It works - unless yours has the 250DR reloading effect.  That’s bugged and breaks multiple primary effects.
---
Distant Thunder has been my go-to for getting Power Armor plans. You can get the T-45, T-51, and T-60 base armor plans and some mod plans from it. I can build almost the full set of these 3 armors now.
---
This was a pretty well known and talked about issue when it came out originally. Its unfortunate and definitely a mishap on their part. It only makes sense. But yes I have found it's always best to do a little research or wait a day or two before purchasing any atom shop items to make sure they function properly. I haven't purchased it myself but I have heard there are way to plant the crops first then drop the greenhouse ontop to get them to pop up inside. Might have been patched out by now though.
---
On the refund side of things, I wish you a sincere good luck. I was able to get a refund the time I asked for one. My 6 year old managed to purchase the Rhododendron suit somehow when letting him "swipe the zombies" as he likes to call killing the scorched in low level areas. So if you have a legit reason (or make one up) your chances are probably good for a first time refund.
---
Almost everything here is fallout 1st focused. They really like treating gamers like second class citizens. Eat a bag of dicks bethesda. Boycotting till wastelanders.
---
Same: add me. I'm leveling up an alt too. Change the 0 to an o for my name.
---
I do kill myself less with fireproof (I manage to stop shooting before I get pulverised most of the time 😂), so I think it does work. Since demolition expert boosts both a legacy explosion and the current one by the same %, when looking at the numbers, then I'm sure it is the same effect. It's just that a legacy explosion does a lot more than the current 20% boost on ballistic legendary weapons...
---
Not the point I'm trying to make. Well, not the *main* point I'm trying to make; what I'm saying is it sucks that they seem to be polishing the silverware while there's termites eating the roof. I get why they're focusing on improving all the microtransactions bullshit because that's what makes them money, but I'm disappointed that they don't really seem to care on making the actual ***GAME*** part of the game better. You know, the thing that actually makes people log in.
---
I don't give a damn if the doors in my pretty pony pretend playhouse maybe clip a little bit, but I do care a great deal that my perks work, my guns deal the correct amount of damage, the enemies I fight don't clip through the ground and attack from outside the geometry, events don't crash me out of the game, etc.
---
We need freefolk memes here
---
do you have any tips on Early PA and core sustain?
---
So on xbox, I put a frame into a display stand (the tall square one, clear glass), and the frame appeared in the first open spot. Same as if it were the cat plushie or something of that nature. I didn't try to put armor on it, but its something. Kinda ugly, but something none the less. And in case anyone asks, it appeared full size, sticking through the display case.
---
No. It’s been bugged for months
---
I agree that the original B.E.T.A. wasn't a true beta. What I'm hoping they do is open an actual alpha/beta months before release this time to hopefully get a smoother launch with Wastelanders than the base game.
---
I personally liked the NW one though I have only been back playing for about a week. Just my humble opinion though
---
Or you know how they can display junk items on tables and shelves
---
Based on a trip I took to Beijing and Xian two years ago I’d say a VPN is essential, even in western hotels everyday websites are blocked without one. 
---
And speaking as someone that’s moved to work in some odd places homesickness is a real thing but it does pass. Every time I go I feel like “Christ why do I never learn” every time for the first few days or weeks. Even though I know I do this. And every time I’m glad I did it, even if it was hard. Good luck!
---
It wasn’t as op as bloodied back then
---
Haven't hopped on yet but the NW music was horrific. I couldnt press x fast enough to log in and get into a world
---
shouldnt be giving away stuff for free
---
Well, then, thank you for replying this, had no idea this was a thing, gave up on workshops in public worlds, a long time ago.
---
Nay, personally Fo1st doesn’t really have a lot going for it rn and that kinda makes it worth while (for me anyway) 
---
Also that “Arthur” quote made my day! Lmao
---
I mean, you're right. If I was assuming the alternative I probably would've already moved on and I'd no longer be active on the sub. As long as I'm still here I'm going to try to give as much constructive feedback as I am able.
---
I’ll add you, I’m not on much during the week but just in case.  I’m JefferyLewbowski on PSN
---
Thanks, anyway
---
Attacking people is a great way to make friends and meet people. I try to hit the people who seem oblivious to the fact that lingering in a workshop is dangerous. If they're willing to listen, I give their stuff back, give them some pointers on avoiding real griefers, etc.
---
nope but that floating bush is now grounded
---
Thanks a lot. That's good to hear. That's definitely a big worry on my mind at this point is getting homesick. Trying to figure out ways of taking pieces of home with me like Fallout help the time pass so I'm not worrying and thinking about things. But sometimes you got to do what you got to do to make money and further your career
---
Bloodied isn’t op. It requires sacrificing your high health for high Dmg. Tse was effectively 250% more Dmg with no trade offs. My meld character was doing 300 Dmg with a tse handmade back in January
---
Well, if that is the case the old adage "better late than never" comes to mind. If they didn't have enough testing at launch, it would be best to not make the same mistake with Wastelanders, right?
---
been around since launch
---
Plant the food first then put the greenhouse over it.
---
Why would you do that in the first place?
---
I’m not on much during the week but will add you. I’m JefferyLewbowski.
---
Yea, because after the first attack people who don’t want to engage in PvP but also need the 20 screws that exist inside that workshop don’t understand to either immediately leave the server or get outside the bounds. So we clearly need to be attacked again. Because we all love being killed and having to negotiate our stuff back, dick
---
It there is it will probably be for only Fallout 1st members.
---
Do you seriously even want everything in the store? 
---
How much do you think you are realistically entitled to?
---
Democracy is non-negotiable
---
I can only partly agree.  I’ve know a lot of people that didn’t initially buy because they disagreed with the lack of NPC’s and player agency on the overall world, but those people are not coming back for Wadtelanders.  Agree with the criticism or disagree with it, 76’s name is in the toilet as far as the public is concerned, and it would take an enormous amount of effort to change that.  Short of going F2P, I don’t see the public at large giving 76 a chance at this point.  It’s been a bad, bad year with problem after scandal after money grab hitting twitter on a weekly basis, and I think most people have written it off.
---
Not really.  In order to have all those cards equiped you dont have dfensive strength cards equiped. It's balanced to me .
---
There is one without a floor.
---
it just shouldn’t exist, almost no scrap in shops now some the few fu1st members hoard it all up
---
Well right now I have no expectation of it either. BGS hasn't made any promises or hints to that end. That's why I'm hoping to put the idea out there and maybe if it becomes a common topic of the community Bethesda will give it some thought
---
What’s your PSN name? I’ll add you, right now we have a Saturday run at 11am CST scheduled.
---
this recently occurred to me...
---
a player locked himself inside and blocked all entrances with a fridge 
---
decided to walk away
---
Thanks. I only started playing again a few weeks ago, so I haven't seen lots of posts that I probably need to see!
---
How many issues are still in the game currently since launch a year later? How can that give you confidence to think they would address issues from a beta test in less than a few months?
---
Yeah, and before the TSE nerf, if you had a Bloodied the dragon, it would be doing easily over 3k
---
I hadn't thought about the "Surprise!" element they've had with the other FO76 content. Maybe that's a design element they'd prefer to adhere to, but it doesn't hurt to put the idea out there for the community to discuss.
---
thanks :-)
---
Mmmmmmaybe
---
Or reduce the subscription to 75 and give me 25 dollars back....
---
I'll be sure to save up for that!
---
Aww man
---
Everytime I load this game up I will be greeted to a more palatable menu screen and music that will play to my nostalgia,  thinking back to the BETA and early days of 76 hype.  This was a major request and has a lot more of a positive impact to me than fixing the 3rd skill on a legendary weapon that I don't own.
---
We'll take a look into this!
---
Familiar things are good for when you’re down, but the real trick is to learn to enjoy what’s new. Learning to seize the opportunities of a new place and make that a home too will make the time pass quickly and develop you. Only problem is you eventually become addicted to travelling! Anyway, my point is have fun! And good luck with the career too. :)
---
I've heard the flamer is pretty brutal, especially an explosive variant.
---
Does this mean I should use demo expert with legacy explosive?
---
I think a tinker's bench should be added to the tent.
---
UGL causes the game to lag and crash so it’s pretty destructive.
---
That makes it an instabuy for me. Handmade skin is okay too, might pick that up. If the Thanksgiving table had the cake that the picture on Bethesda.net showed, then I'd get it. Right now, it's a pass.
---
Nay. The lag it creates would make gameplay terrible in a 24 person server.
---
I'm thinking make it more selective than that. I'm imagining a true alpha/beta with a few hundred beta testers at most. People who have played enough to know how to push the games buttons and give some constructive feedback of what might be broken or abused.

Difference is, the entire 76 beta WAS a bug. There weren't just a few problems that people were focusing on. The whole thing was one huge bug. If the game is mostly functional, but there are some bugs, then that's fine. The 76 beta was not this.
---
I’m sure the hate brigade will be by any minute to say how it’s the worst decision Bethesda has ever made ever.
---
waiting on that nuka cherry combat armor...
---
It’s in the challenges section
---
Ultracite ammo ain’t cheap bro
---
K cool
---
The EXACT process I'm describing? Literally.
---
I'm proposing a method that might give them another source of input to do a better job now than they did at launch. I don't really have any confidence they'll do this because they've made no commitment to do so. I'm just putting the idea out for the community to discuss so that maybe BGS considers it.
---
The whole idea is improving the process from here on out over how it was handled at launch. I'm hopeful BGS Austin will find their feet and get clipping along in 2020.
---
Explosive gatling plasma
---
World challenge section
---
Took them a year to fix those shrubs, right? Well, only 9 months to go on the jetpack then.
---
this would be really cool
---
Bloodied explosive Gatling Plasma will do the trick if you wish to crash a server lol which i do not recommend as ive done this several times by accident with the gat and the Strangler PA.
---
Oh yea, definitely! Card damage numbers don't change, but the explosion gets the full 60% boost. It's definitely noticeable.
---
It's not like Bethesda is unaware of the bugs, and this isn't the QA team's fault. It's the higher-ups not investing more money in development to solve bugs and fix the game -- instead of resourcing it correctly, they've just turned their buggy games into a marketing slogan and are willing to launch their games with an ungodly amount of bugs.
---
Basically, you can lay the blame on Bethesda management. The game needs more time and investment to fix it before launching; but they've never done that.
---
Bethesda plz swap main menu back to NW
---
&gt; Yep, paid for the Tricentennial edition only for it to be on sale weeks later.
---
This is the most annoying complaint ever on this sub. It went on sale for Black Friday/Christmas, which was a week and a half after release. Like literally every other game released before it, and at the same time. People who use this as a valid complaint are just looking to complain about something. Bugs, Fallout 1st, etc... yeah, you have a gripe there. But that price drop for the holidays on a game that was released right before said holiday? Nope.
---
I understand that, but if issues are still present a year later, it brings up the question of if beta testing is even worth the resource
---
In big tech companies QA will find bugs, log them/create a ticket for them. Then based on time and budget of available resources (Developers not working on new content) some of those bugs get fixed based on priority and some get put into a backlog to get worked later. The developer then grabs the ticket/log of the bug and creates a fix for it and unit tests the change. The QA then has to retest the bug using positive (Just the situation where the bug happens)/negative (Regression) testing and sign off on the fix from the developer. I think the bigger issue is probably resources available and regression testing from the QA side. That being said every tech company out there has a backlog of bugs and problems to fix that will not get fixed right away. They will get put into sprints to get addressed and in the case that the fix is simple (not most of the time) it will get fixed during the sprint (Typically 2 weeks) and then tested and approved or rejected by QA in another sprint.
---
Yes. Pre patch at least.
---
I can only see what badges i need not pioneer values
---
It was also only a few days/weeks before launch. There wasn't an actual beta like I'm proposing, just server stress test that doubled as a marketing opportunity.
---
lol wishful thinking.
---
World challenge section right at the bottom just keep scrolling
---
Was prime when i bought it
---
I could not possibly care less either way..
---
Can do a run whenever! I’m online now
---
Yes, it's very convincing that you're describing a manual process of inserting print statements to output program state instead of... using a debugger.
---
If you didnt get the atoms send in a ticket and they will give them to you
---
aw, so now you reply 
---
are the developers focused on NW rather than adventure fallout? pls explain, some people say NW is developed by other studio etc etc but adventure mode needs a good performance fix 
---
i know dem devs be working on wastelanders, but that dont mean shit when the game dont run
---
Oh look another ideal Bethedsa can steal, and then sell back to you through the atom shops in form of an expert lockpick set.
---
You are welcome valued customer.
---
*That Liberty Prime skin tho*
---
True. But I doubt Bethesda would want to hold an actual beta for Wastelanders, if 76 was in such a sorry state and they didn't have an actual beta for the base game either. Not saying you're wrong, an actual beta would be great. But I don't think Bethesda cares. So long as people keep buying microtransactions and 1st subscriptions (for a broken game mind you), nothing will improve.
---
Oh damn fuck yes!!! That drum.... Oh my god, is it raining or something?💦
---
After backlash when it first released, Bethesda added a floorless one. I'm assuming they brought it back and didn't update the description/images?
---
It was a brand new AAA title. It shouldn't have been performing so poorly (due to being so unbelievably broken) that it needed to be on sale weeks later. Most AAA titles released for the holiday season aren't discounted in the same holiday season in which they are released.
---
So glad somebody finally noticed the Arthur reference...
---
Yeah for sure, everyone should get this or a version of it.  
---
Unfortunately charging for stash space seems to be a popular thing to do with these type of games.
---
yellow-orange scout/marine/combat armor camo, when!?! me want.
---
How about fixing when you put items into your stash box then it starts to studder it takes for ever to look for items
---
you really wanna grow that fallout weed
---
That doesn't even make sense, we already had a ton of raider stuff.
---
It was a full price AAA title which we were told would have continuously added content which would not be a season's pass or DLCs. Maybe you don't consider MTX to be DLC, but that's what it is. And Fallout 1st is a season pass by another name. 
---
But yeah, fuck me for thinking I'm entitled to the developers not flat out lying about what their full priced AAA title would be, long term.
---
We're working on this issue. In the meantime, a workaround is to enter adventure mode first before going into Nuclear Winter.
---
Just placement, not login?
---
Probably won't even use it. Just bought because i thought it was cool  https://imgur.com/gallery/uo3Bbj6
---
As it turns out the COBJ record that would enable you to craft the 'standard' version of the receiver at the relevant workbench, as many other 'recipes' that would allow you to craft the 'null mod' for the relevant item just does not exist.
---
They probably thought it unimportant at the time and they still do.
---
However bringing back armour degradation was of paramount importance. We don't want you to stop the busywork now do we?
---
I havent worked in a language that used a debugger in that matter. I also dont know if their creation engine would support doing it that way. Manual debugging is what I've learned and it would work to solve their issue as far as I'm aware. Maybe there are better ways for people who have been formally educated but for the matter I am talking about the method I am describing works.
---
Naw, I like the inventory management. It's a Surivival game. That's what you're supposed to do.
---
Thank you for bringing this up! It should be updated now.
---
I was afk, cooking in the kitchen, I can see my tv from there. Had my character playing the drum , I kept hearing boom, a few seconds would pass then again. Someone was tossing nuke mines at me , I just let him keep going until he realized it wasn't gonna work lol. This character wears heavy robot , all with rad resist also, and with leaded mod. One point in sunkissed. By the time he had my heath bar half covered in rads the sun came up.
---
Yes you can. In example: the 110 damage limit against players.
---
problem is that the main devs are focused on NW and the interns working on adventure mode
---
But it wasn’t if your prices didn’t match
---
I think one Broken "Break-It First" Beta being passed off as a Fully Functional and Finished  game that was sold at Full Price($60) is enough. Time to just sit back and watch this (Bugthesda) Fire Burn! #classicbugthesda
---
While I am right there with you in spirit I know they have some QA peeps at least. There was a livestream where they were using a QA employees toon.
---
It had a terrible build...
---
So yes, 100% with you. The QA game over there is weak.
---
I say add it to the atomic shop.
---
Its likely 1st exclusive - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpc0n5/future_fallout_1st_content_spoilers_abound/

Haven't checked update 15 but interestingly in the last update the textures were in the base game files section and not ATX or Babylon (NW).

@foleythesniper is right; except tse minigun is great for pvp,too, and on PC doesn't crash the server (but explo GPs will).

You cant launch 4 nukes in an  hour sir.  There are only 3 silos and you cant launch more than 1 nuke out of them before they reset, which takes longer than an hour. 
---
Nice try though.
---
Ah i thought it was a literal fountain, like, a big copper one
---
Agree to disagree. I know it’s not scientific, but I’ve spoken with many about this game who aren’t even aware of the controversy. Believe it or not there are a lot of gamers out there who aren’t on Reddit and don’t follow YouTube “outrage”. Hard to believe I know.
---
We do not allow people to do giveaways of physical items as that would require personal information such as name, address for shipping, etc. That is why we disallowed it. Someone sending a gift card to an email address or username does not require a physical address or that persons personal information.
---
Actually this is quite a long list of fixes and enhancements it's proof that the infusion of sub dollars = developers.
---
Jesus man, there is a dome without a floor. I have 3 of them full of plants on one of my characters.

At least get the facts before you fly off on unnecessary rage fits. This game gets enough shit.

It's called black matte in store I guess.

Also, screencap and politely speak to a rep through a trouble ticket. You'll be refunded the points. I've done it a number of times.

I have a feeling one burst from a super mutant mini gun in berserker will drop me. Serendipity saves me a lot in bloodied. Don’t know how much it will save me in berserker because the damage will be in chunks now.
---
It's true human npc are deal breakers, if I can't turn off idiotic barks I'll finally have to uninstall the game. I want to play a game not listen to bad mad max fanfic

I believe it's meltdown at the moment
---
Yeah, it was added a couple patches down the road from the original release.
---
Oh if you’re into travel and history you’re gonna have a blast. Be sure to visit Xian- nothing prepares you for seeing it in the flesh (or Terracotta). And other tips- the bullet trains are amazing and comfortable and often faster than flying, as well as cheaper. And do homework on guides, a good one can be incredible and a bad one.... well let’s say I once paid one to go away!
---
Minigun, Gatling Laser, Gatling Plasma, Ultracite Gatling Laser, Gatling Gun, Light Machine Gun, .50 Machine Gun
---
These are heavy weapons.
---
&gt;I'd imagine the reload code is a global procedure.
---
This is generally bad programming practice and almost certainly wrong.
---
There could be a lot of things wrong with this. It could very well be some weird race condition and simply setting breakpoints or print statements is not really going to help. It could be that they know where the problem is but are not sure how to fix it without a lot of effort and subsequent uncertainty about bugs it might introduce because other systems rely too much on the current implementation. It could be this is all not the case and it's just not a priority.
---
It could be a bunch of things that do not occur to me or you because we just don't know the codebase. I dunno, maybe you have a lot more experience debugging multiplayer games than you're letting on.

It is both fun and a buggy mess.   You can enjoy something AND find faults with it and/or have a number of things that detract from the fun you are having.
---
I've been playing since November of last year, during the Beta.  The truth is somewhere between the people that want to convince others that the game is terrible and others that don't see what the problem is.
---
There are bugs in this game that I regularly run into that have not been fixed in months.   There are bugs that cause the game to immediately lock up that are as easily triggered as eating or drinking 3 or 4 things quickly in a row because your thirst or hunger bar is low.   The thirst and hunger bar has a bug where if you have speed demon mutation AND the perk that is supposed to reduce the negative effects of mutations by 75%, your thirst and hunger still fall at ridiculous rates even when you aren't over-encumbered.      So you have to constantly eat and drink stuff but you can't press that enter key too fast otherwise your client will lock up.   I first remember having a major problem with this in February.  It was a bug before then, but that was when I first got my speed demon mutation and it became a problem far too often.
---
There is room for people to be frustrated with Bethesda.  There is room for people to have fun with the game anyway.  I certainly have had fun with it...and I get really ticked off at some of the piss poor lack of quality control.    This is far more complicated of a topic than either extreme.  Heck, Friends Lists couldn't be added to in-game for how many months before they finally fixed that?    How many bugs did they bring back, back in roughly March when they proved that they don't now how to manage the versions of the program?   Their commitment to producing a quality game is certainly questionable at this point.   It is fair to point out the good things, and very fair to call them to task for all the bullshit over the last year, of which there has been plenty.

Sorry BGS... I don't wear fanboy beer goggles and you are not doing enough shit to keep to keep your sad ass job...Id fire all you lazy shits asap.
---
I know. But specifics as in which one out of these weapons. What legendary traits and such”
---
Yes, Bethesda, famous for keeping things under wraps until they work properly. 
---
Putting aside their reputation and past history and current activities, that still doesn't make sense from a business perspective. You don't release products in secret.
---
That would be nice, would also make mr sandman more useful.
---
I think the biggest scam was fortnite “save the world”
---
Nope, just a very small and otherwise missable drinking fountain with sulfur springs water in it. If it weren't for mentions of the healing properties in text elsewhere in Whitesprings I doubt most people would have even tried drinking from it.
---
&gt;**Stability:** Addressed multiple issues that could result in a server crash. 
---
I would like to see a more detailed explanation of the issues fixed. Trying to line up some blue screens and what not I have been experiencing.
---
Either that or they realized that they could give each separately to space them out over a longer period
---
Oh I totally agree, I'm just looking at it from a realistic standpoint (since I've been on that side of the fence).
---
You've got a bunch of handymen with bug spray running around that can't do full on extermination, spraying the bugs as they find them.  The big boy licensed exterminators are busy setting up the tent and covering the plants and evacuating the pets before turning on the gas, and that takes a lot more work.
---
You've seen how they make big changes that break 15 other things (that's happened plenty), I don't want them rushing those kinds of updates.  If they have a few junior programmers available to set the Z axis on plants and change the scrap box variable from 'indestructible' to 'destructible' while the old timers try to figure out what all would break if they change the code behind some legendary effects (that could affect 15 other things), that's not a bad thing.

Mules, perks, and Excavator armor.  You can actually carry even more with the correct weight reduction armor pieces, but it takes a long time to gather all the right armor sets.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey was $30, released October 2018
---
Call of Duty Black Ops 4 was $38, released October 12th, 2018
---
Battlefield V was $30, released November 9, 2018
---
Hitman 2 was $30, released November 13th, 2018
---
All released near Black Friday, all on sale. The only major game release that wasn't was RDR2. Even go back further. In 2016, Battlefield 1 was reduced to $40 for the holidays, released October 12th of that year. CoD WW2 was reduced to $40 as well for 2017. And was Assassin Creed Origins, released late October 2017 - was $35. I would argue that all of those were intended to be AAA games, yes? So, why are all marked down for Black Friday? Hmm...
---
And before anyone argues that Fallout 76 was closer to a Black Friday release than any of the others, you are forgetting that it quickly went back up to full price the day after Cyber Monday. Everyone forgets that part when complaining about the quick price drop... as if it were intended to be a temporary sale for a weekend or something.
---
I either jump around to events or go to bed lol
---
How do subs like /r/GameSale exist?
---
Physical copies of games don't magically appear... Any personal information is exchanged somehow, right?
---
Would it make it better to send a $0 invoice via PayPal?
---
I'm all for additional QA. That being said, if players don't like the game now, Wastelanders is unlikely to turn anything around for them. Player expectations are all over the map; I've read players assuming this update will be a new game, bug free, with no ATOM shop, no Fallout 1st, no NW hackers, 2FA, internal text chat and a boatload of new content. It's not going to be that, and if so, it won't be all at once. If players can't manage their own expectations, it is impossible for Wastelanders to measure up.
---
I hear you, I'm right among them. I've been in the game since the beginning and seen how far its come, its made great progress since release
---
That or no matter how good they are, they're not empowered to make the right call on testing and get overruled or changes get forced through circumnavigating their process which hamstrings their department.  
---
i've worked with bad QA's but a empowered dept for testing that's an integrated part of the cycle are amazing. That and they keep the Dev's honest and help ensure upfront quality rather than slipshod efforts.
---
Is it really though? Even some of the most toxic people on this sub are above level 200 like it was nothing. Unless you cheated, you spent a ton of time on this game. A TON.
---
It is in our rules. All subreddits have to follow site wide rules. We also mention following Reddiquette as rule 4, which also states not to share personal information. 
---
"Please follow the rules" as an additional rule seems fairly redundant. You can keep making this out to be something it isn't though.
---
When I switched Quake Champions to Steam I just had to log in to my Bethesda.net account and it transfered my progress and Champion Pack, I see no reason Fallout 76 will be different.
---
It is new!
---
You make a good point.
---
You can work around the bug by reloading while sneaking or switching weapons and back...  it’s honestly too much of a pain so I avoid those 250DR weapons myself.
---
No it's on PC too, i've had the issue for ages
---
Sometimes I craft items for low level players to lighten stash junk weight. Buy plans to lower caps.
---
yes
---
I was so tired of my weekly free icon. Even my son, who doesn't care for Atomic Shop stuff except for free items (and the scrapbot he saved up for) thought the amount of icons we got was too much. And dumb looking too. That one last week was just... not good. It's not a good looking mascot for something IIRC doesn't exist outside this game and only a small section of it at that.
---
They have a wastelanders pre launch event planned, I think it will be similar to the original launch event where they invited media and content creators to play early at an event. 
---
They had a small group of people test out NW as well so I wouldn't be surprised
---
Thanks to you and to r/Gearsthecool! Big ups.
---
Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, I entered adventure mode first, so the workaround wouldn't do the trick. Glad you're working on it. Thanks
---
Do you have all the serum recipes yet?
---
The one weight perk I have added is traveling pharmacy. As a junkies build, it's worth it. Now if only they had armor that would make your booze lighter. I like weapons weight better than junk because it helps you carry your legendaries without hobbling to a train station. With junk you can always throw away a couple of fans and a metal bucket to reclaim a few pounds.
---
It stopped for me. It came up once on the day they announced the last fix, and went away after that, never to be seen again.
---
I had sliding scorched in the beta. There’s YouTube videos that showed it pre patch 10 and it still happens in Fallout4. As to why it’s hard to fix you’d have to talk to a programmer. Collision has always been weird in these games
---
It seems like they probably aren't pulling their experienced programmers away from wastelanders development for anything other than serious exploit fixes (like duping) and they have some other people who maybe don't know how to fix the other stuff doing basic graphical and terrain fixes.
---
Yeah we're having a terminology mixup here. From a high level perspective you would certainly just want to call Actor.ReloadWeapon() or whatever but this doesn't mean that your codepath is going to be the same for every actor and weapon combination because there will be edge cases and differences for which you will be writing code specifically for, depending on functionality.
---
Abstraction is always weird like that. Hides implementation details to ease cognitive load, but then you can get confused about what's actually going on.
---
Believe it or not, it’s not dependent. People are paying for Fallout 1st.
---
Someone flagged it on imgur for minor erotic imagery. Was it the pilgrim outfit?
---
You can display 2 items on a shelf. There are 3 shelves
---
What? We're not still in the original B.E.T.A.?
---
Most are definitely on sale for black Friday. Fallen Order is on sale right now and i haven't seen anyone that doesn't like that game.
---
There are testing phases. Before any game gets released, particularly at BGS, they've always passed it around the office to let everyone play it and see if they can find any immediate issues. Some things don't present as an issue until the game has been out and put under stress, especially an always online game. Some things are hard to simulate, like server stress, individual platform stability, network latency issues.
---
I think the instancing is going to go a long way towards helping the game become more stable. That's one of ESOs saving Grace's, is that if another player in your area is struggling to communicate with your server, they just put you in a separate instance.
---
Thanks for doing these. Without it I wouldn’t know to save all my atoms for that communist bundle. Can’t wait for that.
---
sweeeeeeeeet
---
You really can’t compare a computer program to a car but this isn’t the car catching fire, this is that annoying electrical problem that never goes away. You replace wiring and now the a/c fan won’t turn on. Fix that and now the speakers cut out, but only on cold but humid days. You get the picture. And no, there’s little recourse, even under lemon laws. I’m just saying if the bug has been there since the beginning it probably won’t get fixed. Ever.
---
I saw a couple of comments like that recently, I didn't think anything of it at the time but now I read this, it makes them seem a lot less "out of the blue". The sad thing is that they were so inconspicuous, I can imagine why people were falling victim to it.
---
Because the game is PvE, as in, we compete against the environment, and paying makes this competition easier. P2W is literally defined as a paywalled convenience, but people on this sub have their own twisted sense on P2W and all sorts of nonsense logic, so I won't bother explaining anything further to you. There have been countless discussions on this sub about p2w and I'm sure you people come to ask this question out of spite.
---
If you don't have 9 Agility, get 9 Agility. This isn't some casual game mode, it's a no-holds-barred Battle Royale. If you're not in NW to be serious, by all means, bring in some carry-over build from Adventure. But be aware that there are players who take NW seriously and fine-tune our builds for NW. A NW build isn't an afterthought to players like Mack, myself, or anyone else who comes to win.
---
Understand that this is a competitive arena to the death, not a whiner nerf fest. If you can't handle the competition, stay in Adventure. The adults are busy with all of our lack of complaining.
---
I really hate that this prefix (250 DR) is on my Vampire Explosive Pipe Revolver. I was so damn excited when I got this and for the life of me couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting heals... Holding onto it in hopes they fix this. I've submitted a bug report for this as well.
---
Understand frog legs is anti fun. I already said I'm an avid NW player myself.
---
All three shotgunner perk cards maxed , grenadier and skeet shooter, fireproof, demolition expert, enforcer. Those perks and some good shotguns. My favorite version is team medic shotgun build, so my stimpacks are already being shared with nearby teammates, I also have a medics explosive vats crit meter fill faster pump shotty . I carry a quad explosive double barrel for when I gotta kill fast. When you are being a generous teammate , only shoot the ground by enemy's feet to cripple, when in real combat use vats as often as possible to spam crits and keep free healthcare .
---
Plus your health will go down so fast you'll be dead before it procs I think. It's a curious build that I think has potential with tweaking
---
Yeah that sounds painful I guess I’ll put it away I have other options was just looking forward to it .
---
Appreciate the help for sure glad ppl like you are still tugging out the game. 👍
---
The red scare is like peak cold war era.
---
I don’t get it? Like mermaids?
---
The explosive AoE effect from an explosive rad rifle will proc radiation on mobs and players, regardless of Pacifist mode. It will also irradiate the owner of the weapon, if they're close enough. Just like a Nuke Mine, or Pumpkin Grenade.
---
You seem to be replying to the wrong post. You mentioned negotiating. I didn't. You mentioned people not understanding how to handle griefers. I mentioned teaching people how to deal with griefers.
---
No not yet--at least not that I can see. There are definitely 3 more recolors of the Ranger armor coming though - 2 Elite skins (tan, green) and a normal Tan. 
---
Then all the orange / yellow / brown paints for Marine, Combat, Leather, Metal armors which were identified as Zeus (or F1) I think from earlier datamines.
---
Me too
---
Like that Electric Dreams episode where the machines keep delivering what they think the survivors need
---
To me I'd call reload every single time the reload key is pressed.  Then check a bunch of if statements ie, if melee or if already at max ammo or no gun out.... then call the objects reload animation and wait for it to complete then set the ammo to the max ammo variable. If you know cod you know the reload cancel glitch from them setting the variable before the end of the animation.... there wouldn't be "fringe" cases in the way I see it in my head. No matter the situation you'd call src.reload() and then move forward if it makes it passed all the if statement s.
---
By killing them
---
North Korea established the communist party in 1945.
---
We went to war with Korea in 1950.
---
The communist star is much closer to the Korean flag than it is China.   So this is most likely the influence for the game.
---
So yeah, communism was a big deal in the 50s.
---
Events, or jump to another game I'm currently juggling
---
What I'm talking about is a little different than a pre-launch sneak peak. I'm thinking of a handful of players putting the time they'd normally investing into the base game into a true beta test. I know they pass it around the office and have an internal QA, but at the end of the day they are way to busy working on the game to come anywhere close to finding the majority of bugs that a normal player would given enough time.
---
Good to know I am not the only one :D
---
Hi, does anyone want to do a V94 Raid with me tonight 9pm-10pm UK Time? username: dieanother_d_a_y
---
Does it ever get tiring to lob hate on a game every time they do anything? 
---
Does absolutely everything have to be the worst?
---
The raider stuff, and the Free States stuff started rolling out way before wastelanders was slated to be in.
---
I completed it and it's fixed... This was when they initially said they fixed it
---
Just try completing it once
---
You stupid turd. It's your money, but imbeciles like you are the reason why gaming is becaming so sit nowadays. Keep being stupid slaves to AAA companies scams instead of demanding quality for you money. Geez...
---
Think their main reason for rejecting the outside help is because it is an online game, like it or hate it for it i feel like that makes them solely responsible for having to fix it.
---
I think they are definitely being mismanaged to a point where I fully expect the project leads for that department of Bethesda to be fired, or step down and let some competent people run the show.
---
This could also be because Bethesda has “let the modders fix their game for them” that they now do not know how to troubleshoot and promptly correct issues.
---
It would be a phenomenal idea to have that
---
Here's hoping the instancing helps. Still, at the end of the day the folks at BGS are going to be more busy creating the game than playing it and a handful of players putting hundreds of hours into the game will find bugs that would never come up during development.
---
True, the department needs to be backed up to be effective.
---
I make serums or popular ammo to lighten stash. One time it got to the point where I took mods off all the weapons and armor and put ultralight mod on armors. Then just hop around vendors, you'll find something cool to buy
---
I read that in my mind as if it was "Jared Scorch Foot" and wondered why and how you had a poor Native American man stuffed in a display case.
---
My findings are contradicted from the data in the link i shared. It likely is a 1st exclusive item. I'm guessing the files being in the base game are an over-site or a mistake.
---
It's set to release with wastelanders, whenever it comes
---
Go to goldshire and throw them at the table dancing  draenei
---
Find a low level players camp. You can usually tell if they’re new or it’s a alt. Then drop them some bulk scrap, make them a weapon and armour that’s their level. Go buy some plans or anything from a bot vendor and then you can start selling some junk back to them.
---
It was not a mistake. They ban people for using exploits. He used exploits. Thus, he got banned. What is so hard to understand about this?
---
I have several bloodied rifles that I want to use that have it as well.
---
You don't seem to be an avid NW player. The first clue is you're complaining about the perk that almost 100% of players use and don't complain about. The second clue is you seem to think that using Frog Legs somehow gives you an advantage. Any half-decent NW player knows that hitting a target moving UP and DOWN is no more difficult than hitting a target moving LEFT and RIGHT. In fact, Frog Legs makes it easier to hit a moving target, as I demonstrated with my screenshots already.
---
If your complaint is with Demo builds, that's understandable. If your complaint is with Frog Legs, you're better off in Adventure where you can use the VATS aimbot to hit moving targets for you.
---
Did I miss the gore piles 😖?
---
Bless you for these type of post. Shared it with the FB communities. &lt;3
---
You can't say what they focus on, you can only talk about the outcomes because that's the only thing you have knowledge about. It's possible they focused on other things and just weren't successful, or that these changes were easier and are out faster than bigger problems.
---
I love the fact that it is new geometry that makes the gun look new, and not just a black skin.
---
https://discord.gg/bDge823
---
Yas! a skin for the Handmade and a Free Wallpaper.
---
I feel ya. Don't sell them off cheap, like I've seen other players do. I'm sure they'll fix it, some year in near future...
---
‘It just works’
---
With bloodied build and mist of perks mentioned, my combat shotgun does up 440 damage
---
Still riding that ad hominem train eh?
---
I am not even remotely confused here man but go ahead and be sad if you want. Your emotional state doesn't concern me.
---
I offered one example man. There are others, like when lunchboxes were datamined and the youtube regulars started stoking the hate train.
---
they do exist, but really low drop rate.
---
Some, yes. There's also plenty of bugs that won't show up until the game goes live.
---
I love the idea and hope the other colors datamined follow the same free pattern,but this grey one looks like crap in my camp eheh
---
cool!
---
okay, guesd we will have to wait and see. just wish it got released already, saw them in the patch 14 datamine and has been wanting them ever since.
---
Idea Time.
---
Bethesda should move the Scrapbox as a free item for all.
---
For Fallout 1st members, to add more value to the subscription, give them the option to make private servers persistent. It would make it much more fun if the workbenches didn't reset because you disconnected for 15 minutes to go poop or something. But, also allow a reset of the world from the console they gave everyone for free from the Atomic Shop. Oh, and actually have some discounts as promised. It's been almost a month, 27 days, and not one discount yet. Time to get on it.
---
So again I'd like to stress that neither of us really knows the implementation details, but it's likely that this is not one long list of if statements and is internally a state machine.
---
Long story short, I can think of a lot of ways this can go wrong, especially when you throw in animation states you need to wait for - like you mentioned with reload (animation) canceling.
---
&gt; So yeah, communism was a big deal in the 50s.
---
Not saying it wasn't, but there's no reason that communism should be so prevalent consider all the V76 residents were Americans and most likely were educated in the vault. Which considering the vaults were sponsored by the American Government, I highly doubt it would have anything pro-communism.
---
It’s not that lol they follow me and lay them out and they just trigger no matter if I run away or anything.
---
Yes. What better way to get their attention? Half the time, simply messaging a warning to someone gets ignored. The fact that they get killed doesn't cost them a thing. I can give all of their caps and loot back, and they're certainly going to talk to me after that. In fact, killing another player almost always results in the other player immediately... contacting me.
---
No, probably not.  But there would be a ton of anti communism stuff.
---
Well, patch notes state:  
---
 **Outfits:** The cloth at the bottom of the Ranger Armor now moves more smoothly when walking or running. 
---
So, is it smooth and buttery now..?
---
It just doesn't belong man. People abuse it combat. Sad they ever put it in. I already said they're not invincible, but it's immensely annoying and not fun. It simply doesn't belong in this gamemode as Permanent perk. Say got gud all you want. It's not meant for this gamemode. All those 4 squad froggers ruin it. Sorry man.
---
Which would make sense for anti-red propaganda instead of the embracing of communism that the cosmetics portray...
---
Yeah I recall that. I wish they were just default on period. Man it is annoying to have to run around camp, turn radio/smoke machine or whatever else on every login.
---
Yes, non-exclusive and discoverable via in game quest or at worst a small amount of atoms. It makes the game much simpler, also it opens the door to mich more wealth depending on Th e scrapbox limit (anyone know yet?). 
---
I am trying to make gold and silver scrap as an alternate currency.
---
ok sweet, its good to get confirmation.  i had a gut feeling but the other user didnt finish testing it yet afaik
---
If your game was crashing that much you wouldn't be playing. And crashing in general is not a common issue, hasn't been for some time. So maybe stop exaggerating/lying and just stick to reality to make arguments? xD
---
It's sad you have to explain to them how to do their job
---
&gt; If they’re willing to listen
---
So basically if they play by your rules you’ll be nice but if they seem to think you’re a dick for randomly killing them for no reason you’ll think twice about doing anything? You seem to think it’s your job to teach players not to be in areas like this. In other words, you’re still a dick
---
VE 50 cal is the best option in my opinion. 
---
Virtual immunity and just the perfect rate of fire. Too much and some will not count.
---
It's all about rate of fire anyway ,the damage is always the same.
---
WHY is it annoying?
---
I say pay for it if you want it
---
This conversation started from the idea manual debugging wouldn't work here and I think it would but this has been informative dude. I see ways my idea can go wrong too but it definitely isnt something that checking where the variables drop off wouldn't help diagnose the issue.
---
The Chinese stuff looks pretty cool, surprised there isn't more Fallout 1st stuff though. There really isn't enough additional content right now to justify the price tag, I wonder what % of people will be renewing next week?
---
Downvoted for being a boring person. Please cry more about trivial things so I can downvote again.
---
A lot of people have already decided to hate anything Bethesda does. They want this game to fail, because they’re miserable people that hate others finding joy in anything. It doesn’t matter if BGS rolls out a flawless launch of wastelanders, there will be people on this sub the second it drops claiming it’s the worst.
---
Look into the lore of Fallout. The big boogie man was china and there was this whole big war in Alaska between the US and China. The games have a history of Chinese/communist cells hidden everywhere.
---
Anti-communism would be fine as it fits the setting. But they add cosmetics that involve what appears to be a Chinese set of PA, as well as other things of that nature.
---
Don't care at all.
---
Yeah it wasn't very good. It reminded ,me of Steve Irwin though, so I didn't get too annoyed by it. The free lights were awesome and the Grafton monster bed... So naturally a run of dumb icons would be unwelcome
---
I guess it does? But it just looks so weird when I'm standing still, the ends are hugging my legs too much in my opinion.
---
I either craft &amp; then scrap items that i haven't learned all the mods for or switch to my alt character. At least I used to. TBH I haven't had that problem since I got the sub
---
Yea if you pre order the free dlc you can beta test
---
Are all of the things shown in the atom shop now?
---
Thank you for pointing all this out. You can see me and OP are running in circles in a thread on this post. Make sure to not do the same. This comment is sufficient.
---
The base game needs to be made free to play. It's the absolute least Bethesda could do in wake of the god awful decisions they've made with this game and its community.
---
Yeah which political ideology wasn't showing it's face openly in the US in the 50s?
---
That is the whole issue with the commie gear.
---
Do you think that we would tolerate that as survivors of vault 76? They were not exactly teaching Communism in the vault and any communists old enough to predate the vault were probably spies, sooooo....
---
Yes. For gods sake, let's not repeat the launch of this game.
---
And **NOW** I know what who my next character is: *Jared Scorch Foot*, Native American from Appalachia. Brilliant
---
This x1000
---
But didn't a guy get banned for reporting an exploit or something?
---
Are you anywhere near Grafton when you log in?
---
And the lore of Fallout also says that America was the only country with PA. Yet there is a cosmetic for a Chinese set of PA.
---
Thanks for correcting the typo I was getting the sweats.
---
They did fix it, but the Grafton mayor reprogrammed himself back. Everyone thought it would be skynet, but our true end is the Grafton mayor achieving sentience.
---
How do you know it isn't low on the priority list? Do you think only high priority things are looked at in a given patch period? Sometimes fixing numerous minor problems is easier and better than spending a lot of time on one bigger problem that may not even get a fix.
---
And on that note, this could have been a fix that took all of 5 minutes to create and implement. Yet look how many boring people are on the forums bitching about it.
---
I am entitled to complain because reasons and no one can stop me 😁
---
they had a release date and obviously its getting pushed back to next year up to another quarter.
---
I bet it was always ready at least until the November release, maybe even earlier, but they fucked that away with the initial release of the game as the state of Wastelanders was probably identical. Push Fallout First to inject money back into the project and get Wastelanders in a playable state that isn't FO76 level incompetence. At least its free, for now. Maybe you Fallout First people get invited to this hush-hush "beta"
---
That's a nay, right?
---
This is the situation where I would suggest a Fallout 1st Membership. I don't think everyone needs it and I dont think anyone should have it before level 50, but if you are playing enough to get to this point it really helps make your time enjoyable.   
---
If you get to the point you are at now you will at least be able to continue grinding and stashing scrap and not feel like your efforts are wasted.  
---
Probably wont be a popular answer but worth considering if you are spending a lot of time playing. If you don't want to go that route make sure your stash weight is managed as well as you can. I'm not sure what you do to get to max caps daily but my previous routine would be to bulk all junk in stacks of 5 except for Ballistic fiber or lead, things like that. Sell your bulk scrap to the vendor for caps.
---
Are they canonically dead?
---
The bed and lights were from a community event. I don't remember there being a pattern with releasing free atomic shop items until after then.
---
Not really no.  Nothing positive. I mean no event for tier year anniversary  and no new content. Just only so many times I can kill a queen.  Just gonna take a break till wastelanders. 18 bucks for a pa skin is nuts
---
Yea I’ve been meaning to do more testing, someone told me it’s possible to get zero AP cost on these rifles if you do things just right. You on PC? I can fill you in on new findings if so.
---
I play everyday, still chasing select pieces of gear , looting the world , going on long walks checking out scenery. Five different character builds. Finding good gear to sell in my vendors.
---
No problems for me in PC.
---
I think all the patches today are very superficial.
---
I think that's what the dataminers predicted would happen.
---
Im not here to argue with you. For one it was a joke, but for two yes i have had major crashing issues since day one. Im a big fan of the series, which is why i play. I dont know why you took that as a personal affront but i can only assume its cause youre just another brown noser who cant see the problems with the game
---
Feel free to reread the comments man. I've said multiple times they dodge shots as soon and you shoot the first shot. It's abused in combat. Which simply isn't fair as a permanent perk, severely limiting your options. It's anti fun because you know they'll come jumping over cover shooting you in the air. Where , like or not dude, it's not a fair fight. Say git gud all you want. It drives a people away from the mode and doesn't belong. 
---
And if you're suggesting either everyone uses it or no one is complaining. That proves my point even more. It's an awful, pathetic meta and Crux. 
---
Either make it cost a lot of AP to jump, make it mutation only, or remove it.
---
That is insane. I have never heard of 1 person having that much of a problem.
---
It’s deeply impressive if you have mass transit too, cause it works so well! Of course, if you have cheap labor and are planning on the scale the Chinese are ( and can crush any complainers with a pen stroke)
---
No. It is absolutely one of the best features to encourage a subscription and should stay that way so the game can grow.
---
I got an idea, give Fallout First access to this DLC "beta", obviously they buy everything Bethesda sells, so no leaks.
---
And why would we disregard FO76's first 'B.E.T.A' as they call it, not like shit will change or improve, so maybe OP's idea for a gag order will be in order because they'll release it anyways and no one to say "I told you so"
---
I can't stay safe. I pick fights with Scorch Beast often xD
---
I liked the NW screen and music, but apparently it was a huge deal to people who spend more than 10 seconds selecting a character and hitting play
---
The SBQ is, and I'm assuming she will be removed by the time Wastelanders drops. The whole "clean up Appalachia" thing was supposed to lead into Wastelanders but they had to delay it.
---
I dunno, I kinda liked the bug that allowed Collectrons to remain in worlds for a while after their owners left the server. They seemed so lonely and without purpose, a realistic depiction of many of these one-task robots in a post-apocalyptic world. Sometimes I'd relocate my camp near them so they'd have a buddy in my own Collectron. Maybe somebody saw mine sitting alone in the wastes after I quit playing for the day and gave him some companionship as well.
---
But people with Fallout 1st subs (I’m not one of them) still have broken jet packs too.
---
Key words are "legal right". The statements were made during an interview, and as far as I know, were not part of any legally binding contract (TOS, sales agreement, etc.). Given that they weren't, I don't see how it would be legally enforceable. Shitty business practice? Absolutely. But not likely illegal.
---
I think it's better that a nice person shows them the ropes than a nasty person, yeah.
---
The most recent time I attacked someone, she introduced me to her son (also a F76 player), added me as a friend, thought it was really cool that I helped people understand the dangers of workshops, and got my help fighting off real griefers. Her son then helped me find some rare plans I was looking for and asked for help with his build.
---
I'm clearly a dick.
---
Such as?
---
I tested and confirmed that orbital strike grenades slightly damage neutral C.A.M.P.s too... There are also the groups of people who will keep hitting someone with electrically charged/unstable isotope mutations and causing them to die. Unless they were carrying 50 stable flux or something, is it even worth the time it takes?
---
I don't really understand what you'd gain from wasting your time doing this stuff to people, but it definitely happens too frequently.
---
He and his team got banned for finding the bugs and helping out. Showing Everything
---
knowing the reviews would be overwhelmingly negitive and they would be forced to issue refunds
---
thats why
---
Only way I think is duping. How else can they do this a lot ya know
---
And in GTA I used to blow up 1.5 million dollars worth of cargo then give them 3 million. It was still a dick move either way. If you want to do it right, try talking to them instead of attacking them. Being nice after being a dick doesn’t change the fact it’s still a dick move. So get off your fairy tale unicorn and accept reality
---
The point of that is to be a sneak build, and do not tell me 3k damage in any case is fair. A normal player has about 300 health. That essentially means you’re doing 10x the amount you need to kill a player in PvP. Ofc this was before the several nerfs if that wasn’t clear.
---
Are you somehow allergic? I bet it will sell.
---
I don't play the meta because I think the Tesla/SB circle jerks are, well... A circle jerk. And I lose often because of it.
---
Although they are considering implementing public test servers, I can see the necessity of private testing sessions.
---
None of the new stuff is in the Atomic shop for me, is that just me or? :/
---
I think a win win would be to let anyone use an existing scrap box, but only subscribers can place them. Same for the survival tents. I think that reliance on other players would bring the community together while still providing that reason to subscribe (without taking anything away from subscribers).
---
Are you sure your money is being used to make the game grow, or to justify further and more invasive MTX?
---
*salutes*
---
Would you like to speak to the manager, Karen?
---
Looks like theyre gonna have the chinese death robot equivelent skin too
---
Number 1. My comment is 21 days old. Way to be another hating sheep. 
---
Number 2. Nice opening line including name calling. Shows your intelligence. I’ll use smaller words for you. 
---
Number 3. As of this patch I’ve gotten everything I’ve wanted. You don’t get to tell me what my money is worth. I’ve gotten quality and quantity with all my spending.  If you feel that I haven’t then PayPal me my initial cost, atoms, 1st membership and come tell me what to use it on. 
---
Until then sit down, shut up, and grow up.
---
Thank you, Todd Howard's personal knob licker.
---
Wat? 
---
Do you even play the game?
---
Still waiting for a sale on the Vault-Tec CAMP bundle. Saved up Atoms, now still waiting...
---
I'm kind of glad the "original theme" will be playing in the menu now; I started playing around the time of the nuclear winter update in June and haven't heard it before.
---
Otherwise, no... we can only hope they're so busy at work on Wastelanders they forgot to fix anything in the game for the past month. We can probably all agree that's not the case though.
---
Logging on just for the free wallpaper which should have been given out as soon as the feature was introduced.
---
I'm getting a lot of infinite loading screens of death too.
---
Ranger Hot Yoga Outfit

"Pretty pony pretend playhouse"- the best way I've yet heard to describe camp's. I mean, I do *kinda* care a bit though if the doors on my pretty pony pretend playhouse clip, because F076 wasn't just criticized for it's big bugs, it was criticized for its abundance of bugs, which they are trying to address one at a time. It's easier to swap out an air freshener in your car than it is to swap out a transmission, even though both make the car seem better, one just more than the other.
---
It has the same detection chance reduction as 5 pieces of chameleon armor pieces, and yes, it does stack.
---
Also I speculated awhile back they would release more Liberty Prime skins, however I pictured something Black.. as in Black Bird Black with a Red Headlamp. This just looks slightly dark grey and not much of an interesting change either. Are there any videos of it in action?
---
They are currently working on wastelanders, those people need to be paid. I am certain that without a continuous influx of cash this game will up and die.
---
If they let the game stagnate for too long the cashflow stops or shrinks dramatically. So logically they will keep working on it as long as they want to continue to make money.
---
Sometimes they'll keep their color for a bit. I had some on display for a while, all with different colors. It is finicky at best.
---
It's widely speculated that the whole reason they launched it as a Bethesda Launcher exclusive was to control the refund policy. So far I've seen little to prove that isn't the case.
---
The cut that Valve takes is surely worth paying for the increased exposure and audience the game would have, I struggle to think of any other justification.
---
Easter eggs, cat topiary, punch bowl, there's been tons of free stuff since at least April.. the lights and bed were free during the cleanse Appalachia event, but the haircut, honeybeast and scotchbeasts icons and flamer paint etc were unlocked. I dunno how consistent it's been, but there's been free atomic shop stuff rolling out for a long time
---
We haven't heard anything either way though.
---
Yes, it displays a total of up to 6 items, 2 per shelf.  It's similar in functionality to the display cases - same type of items can be placed on them.
---
He sure spends a lot of time crying about the game.
---
Does the Shadow Prime PA talk or anything?
---
It does- up to 6 items. I think it's pretty decent for a bar setup, myself.
---
It's all about the Benjamins. There weren't a lot of Ceasar's Legions members running around Appalachia either, but they have that as well in the datamined images. They're just trying to capitalize on nostalgia and such. Lore be damned.
---
I'm pretty sure it was a "fix" that you guys did. That ended up completely changing the way jet packs work. You just need to revert them to the way they were in Fallout 4
---
I wanted them to release a free one from the beginning. Wallpapers are an overhaul for camp building and it's too big system to not let everyone be able to at least try it.
---
I haven't heard the grafton mayor since the last patch
---
Yes, I'm on PC, would be interested if to know you find any new info. You know, I was surprised to see from that datamining that scopes do not add any VATS cost compared to standard sights except short recon and short night vision scopes, which add +20% add +30% of the base VATS cost value which is a lot if you mod rifles to minimize VATS cost.
---
Two things:
---
1. Atomic Shop content was never really beholden to canon.
---
2.  It gives players an option to role play as the other side of the conflict.
---
It took me weeks of hunting to find a pink one that kept its color.
---
Did they really treat him badly though? 
---
He exploited those bugs he claims to have "tested" for some time, conveniently only changing his narrative to "I was just testing them" once he'd been banned. It's a blanket policy that using exploits will result in a ban, in ANY game. There rightfully should be no special treatment just because he makes his living from publicising such things.
---
&gt; They're just trying to capitalize on nostalgia and such.
---
I don't think people are nostalgic for Chinese Communism...
---
I use a Vampire faster fire.
---
Of course a fallout 1st issue will be looked into
---
Because what I'm proposing is an actual beta months before release instead of a stress test and marketing gimmick right before the actual content is rolled out. I'm saying do another B.E.T.A. and this time do it right. I'm not disregarding the first one, I'm acknowledging it and giving a way to possibly improve it.
---
people can no longer spam emotes in nw lobbies
---
Except you can actually see them, lol.
---
What's broken on the jetpack?
---
To mention one the clipping of the cape while running
---
I'm shocked.....not really lol
---
It's called the Rug Glitch.
---
But their exclusives have gotten priorities, look at the amount of changes that are limited to them.
---
They started working on Wastelanders way before they received any money from 1st.
---
That's not how things work. You make a good game, with good content, and many kore people will play it and will be willing to spend their money. 
---
But if you prioritize microtranssctions over content, no new players will come, and the playerbase will slowly die down, bored - that's exactly what's happening here.
---
And don't worry about the devs, Berhesda is a billionaire company, they don't get paid with your MTX money, you can be sure of that.
---
Didn't say extinct, just dead.
---
It boosts you up as soon as you jump.  It was broken over 4 months ago and they claim they will look into it.  It drains so much fusion core.
---
So lets put this into terms you might be able to understand.
---
You took your car in, they handled the small easy fixes. 
---
The Craked head needs to be replaced.  They usually dont have parts on hand for this.  So one of 2 things can happen.   They can give your car back to you with new plugs, an oil change, coolant flushed and interior vacuumed so you can get to work, or they can keep it another 2 weeks while they wait for the part, completely disassemble the top of your engine, and install the new part.
---
I vote option 1, and then bring it back in later for the cracked head replacement, because I can still somewhat drive it to get to work.
---
Melee is my focus, but to aid the LMG, I run stabilized3 and the Strength perk with a picture of a tank.  
---
I alos have a couple of the "automatic weapons" perks (endurance, I think) , but IDK if they boost the LMG or if they only apply to small automatics like the SMG. (I use one of those for tagging in events like uranium fever)
---
Bubblegum. Really?
---
You are looking at it the wrong way.  
---
fo76 is a like a murder mystery or a detective novel.  You are not the hero deciding the fate of the wasteland, you are a detective.  
---
Your character emerges from the vault to discover that to a man, woman, and child every last human is dead.  All that remains are horrifying caricatures of what  once were humans.  The Scorched.  
---
How did this happen?  What is the source of the Scorched plague?  How can it be stopped or at least contained?  What happened to all the people who survived the bombs and the plague but failed to find a cure or at the least find some way to survive?  
---
The beats are not as dramatic in fo76's story because they all occur via holotapes, terminal entries, etc.  But if you really immerse yourself into it there's just as much story in fo76 as any other Bethesda game.
---
Yeah I ended up getting a god roll one in a trade. Used it once and haven’t used it since. It’s pretty much cheating in my eyes. Just run around and hold the trigger down.
---
I like the Elite redesign but cannot understand why the're not changing the shape of the helmets as well to look like they did in FNV.
---
🔥🔥🔥Hi, does anyone want to do a V94 Raid with me tonight 9pm-10pm UK Time? username: dieanother_d_a_y
---
I need to run through again.
---
They're gonna release it on Steam alongside or shortly after Wastelanders, I think. If they put it up now its gonna get review bombed. If they do it when or after Wastelanders drops their review score won't be destroyed (if Wastelanders is actually good that is.)
---
take one from stash, drop, pick back up and examine which one it is. then place in display. repeat. if u get one u don’t want then place back in stash and try again.
---
upon reboot/relog- if the colors change to default green then there is nothing you can do.
---
OK, Boomer.
---
Maybe increase the max caps capacity too, just a suggestion
---
 I agree, but since its last rollout date was this month, now extended to next year, everyone who has endure throughout should have the opportunity to play and discuss it here, on forums, YouTube and other social media, warts and all.
---
I don't agree with giving it certain people with certain conditions, Bethesda owes us that much, I'm still invested into the game so are millions of other people that play this hot trash day one.
---
Add me, koldfeet83. I'll be on tonight around 8p EST. I'll happily walk you both through a silo run, twice if you both want to launch nukes. Hell maybe even 3 times so I can launch one as well. I've got a private server and beefy guns/gear so we can 3 man it, along with anyone else who wants to join.
---
Honestly, it's why I avoid explosive weapons with procs unless I'm going for the cripple on something I know won't close to melee with me. Shotguns being the primary culprit, rad rifles the second.
---
That would certainly add some interesting variety.
---
Couldn't agree more. My wife has a handful in her stash that she bought just to keep them off the market 😂.
---
This was fixed in our last patch. If you're still experiencing this issue can you file a support ticket for me, please?  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Sweet
---
They don’t have the time, people, or talent to fix anything serious. So they fiddle with what they can.
---
“The roof is completely rotten and causing the house to flood every time it rains, leading to extensive water damage. But we don’t have / can’t afford roofers and mold removal. Guess we’ll replace this porch light that’s burned out.”
---
This is what’s happening. Mark my words.
---
Thanks guys
---
THIS IS GRAFTON’S MAYOR
---
Like people have said, exploding plasmas with a splitter. Shoots 5 beams, has 5 explosions, so makes 10 procs. Alaser with a splitter, or an explosive shotgun also work.
---
I do not see a ton of dmg increase with my set though. I end up killing stuff way to quickly for it to matter. It only gives a real advantage in pvp
---
Adding communist cosmetics, etc plays into the 1950s Mcarthy era paranoia, which held there was a commie behind every tree and under every rock.
---
THat adn I do seem to remember a few threads in here asking for chinese steath outfits, et al.
---
I'd actually be down, but I'm primarily a sneak melee build so we may need more help
---
Your game is dying.
---
Yep, I've literally had them follow me as I fast traveled across the map.  I'll take free loot!
---
He said meaningful, I mute the lobby before nuclear Winter
---
So what you're saying is despite the fact the commies were responsible for the other half of the nuclear holocaust that made the world a wasteland (the setting for the game) and being literally in apalachia (under mama dulces for example) they should have no representation in this game as far as cosmetics.  Right.
---
I use it for the queen. I agree that there are some things they could change, like make damage caps different for each weapon type. But there are some items that can be used interchangeably. Specifically, for the daily challenge "level up while engaged in pvp" I pvp with a friend, then do ghoul hunting while in pvp. I don't think blanket nerfs will work right.
---
I think they need to really get into the nuances of everything to make it work right.
---
Some more dungeons akin to the burrows would be a nice additions. There's a lot of sewers, storm drains, etc. Heck, Watoga has skyscrapers that are locked off.
---
When I am at max caps - I go shopping for scrip
---
Correct and I wonder why there are downvotes?  People don't like to be reminded of how the game actually works?
---
I think I'm uninstalling.
---
How about take ten seconds and search crash on this forum, and sort by recent. The game is absolutely still crashing for a lot of people.
---
Wait 24 hrs, then sell it to the bots.
---
Otherwise, give it away or leave it in a container where you hope someone will find it..
---
For mats, rebuild your camp, or craft stuff, then scrap it to see if you can get more mods....
---
As a subscriber this is extremely underwhelming patch, and I hope all that new found profit is going to employing better skilled developers to dedicate to \*BETTER\* bug fixing and new content; so I do expect the next patch to get better with more funding now backing whoever is doing these patches now that I pay PER MONTH.  They can just start by focusing on a public list of top issues that we gamers can vote on or something, fixing a stray bush in some area floating is not something they should be prioritizing \*IMO.  This list sounds like something you'd give college students or something to just 'ship something'.  
---
The things that do bug me or ideas to fix/add near term:
---
\[General\]
---
\*Make it so if a player goes to buy something in your inventory and you will go over max caps the trade should NOT be allowed giving the buyer a message that the seller is now too rich or something.  You can literally code in a 'tax' on imaginary goods, you can code in a check that the vendor (it's a computer terminal for goodness sake) in a lore friendly way would say sorry we are not doing any more sales as maxed out.  
---
\-I should not have to do some convoluted build a room around the vendors or some jazz to just take my vendor offline without storing it due to the next item.
---
\*If you store a vendor you SHOULD NOT lose all your carefully placed items for sale in it and their costs, like WTF!!! (or do the above to fix this to not be an issue, come on this is just plain lazy, do you Bethesda play your own game???)
---
\*Trying to fast travel on map does not work consistently.  Half the time you have to get out of map and go back in, other times you have to keep fast traveling, accepting the cost, nothing happening and trying again a few times. 
---
\*The mini gun doesn't fire during aiming before firing
---
\*Get stuck in aiming mode sometimes when aiming to shoot and you release the aim you stayed locked in that aimed view until you re-aim or change weapons
---
\*Cannot see xbox friends online, the entire social list says there was a problem and doesnt show anything on xbox
---
\*Issues joining private world saying I'm not friends with them despite being friends (this may be fixed hopefully with this patch as it's hella annoying)
---
\*Make the tesla rifle NOT hit a aggro'd player that is in chameleon mode invisible or stealthboy like wtf! (this seems lore breaking to me, makes stealthboys and perks/mutations useless)
---
\*Fix the meta imbalance of melee  vs. pvp - (consider say assassin's/sentinels applying back to the original stats including cannot stagger when using melee weapons &amp; guaranteed 8%/15% protection, not a \*chance\* to reduce...allowing melee to somewhat tank to help give melee players a chance to eat some bullets when ranged to help melee live longer to make fights more interesting and less 1 sided for ranged)
---
\-Could also consider removing legendary effects when PVP'ing only, something of the 2 would probably be a good balance
---
\*If you wire connect a xbox controller while its on battery with a FFR weapon you start tearing thru ammo as you have to unplug or turn off the controller and turn it back on and reconnect all the while your character is firing the weapon the whole time, reloading, and firing continuously.
---
\*Can Tesla be considered to not hit players in PVE when not doing active PVP and only hit the player(s) that are aggro'd like if they are part of a team?  (this would probably be lore breaking though so I get it)
---
\*Can you fix where when you hit a player and the ribbon goes away saying your attacking someone that they later attack you and engage PVP?  Had this happen a few times shooting with my shotgun staggering enemies for players to take advantage of that.  I've also started abusing this hitting players that attack me whether trolling or accidental to wait till they look at something else and then prison shank them dead in the back and split.  It's funny but it's cheap.   
---
\*Fix the meat hook, had some players using it killing the queen in seconds not allowing me to tag it is super aggrivating.  The more players spawn more harder monsters as a balance or something if you want, but that probably would increases crashing chances.
---
\*Increase caps limit or add a safe to double cap stash or something
---
\*FFS: Fix 250% damage protection legendary effect!  I've got weapons I want this legendary effect to work on and not break the primary!
---
\*Can you add forest scout armor plans to make for learning mods? 
---
\*Can you allow crashed out leader in vault raids be able to rejoin and continue with team? (Surely you can tell what is a server logoff vs. crash out client stops responding...)
---
\*Can you put in a safer way to transfer items between characters?  Say something not in world, but from main menu? Using private world is 'okay' but I do worry that what if the private world server crashes and I lose tons of ammo, super rare weapons, etc that I'm transferring using that route.  
---
\-Now that your getting my money every month you need to treat my own progress and collection of items with a more stable and protected system that won't just 'lose' stuff and too bad kind of thing.  That was acceptable when I wasn't paying for a subscription, but not anymore.    
---
\[Private Worlds\]
---
\*Can you ensure first spawn in to new private server all enemies spawn leveled to us like they would in public server, this seems like a bug where they are dead or level 9's etc.
---
\*Don't limit legendary spawns, I've seen this where events don't spawn legendary enemies like Uranium Fever &amp; SBQ, and legendary farming yields nothing after a trail run or 2
---
\*Can you allow first connection to new private servers for the player to have all the spawns reset for area items as if this was a prestine server I'm coming into first time ever.
---
\[Events\]
---
\*Can you add survival disaster events like what there is on robolox for example in some way in fallout lore?  (admittedly playing those with my daughter they can be very fun) 
---
\-There is so much more you can do here to make really fun events in general
---
\*Can you add events for letting players become legendary monsters kinda like left for dead and play in teams one against the other like that in a fun lore friendly way? 
---
\-You'd need to severely gimp the legendary effects during events against player bosses though othewise they would be melted in .000001 microseconds
---
\*Make a hide &amp; seek type event with the one hiding from the seekers maybe getting super buffed super powers for having them hide and rewards be good for both parties.  Like say limit weapons of seekers to certain things and allow hider to spawn monsters while using event unique only weapons against seekers that apply active hampering effects like slow fire rates, teleporting away like nuakshine, half damage, overencumbered, floating without control, and other funny effects that could be used to create havoc to make it a true challenge for the seekers. 
---
\*Can you allow players that join events able to loot event bosses if they don't tag them with enough damage due to other players one-shotting?
---
Yay.
---
im with ya.. except.. if you try to drive the car for 2 weeks with a cracked head you'll blow the engine...
---
Foreal? Why dont you guys hire one of the modders who already has it developed
---
How about literally becoming immortal with energy weapons?
---
Still in game, still annoying as shit.
---
It was a matter of speed.
---
As much as i would love to get wastelanders out now i have to agree based off my loyalty to bethesda. I hate to say but if they cant fix fallout 76 to be an all around amazing game without all the issues (which i can cope with) i feel like most people will give up on bethesda and anything from bethesda online. In my experience E.S.O. was not anything that i was looking for in on online elder scrolls series. Fallout 76 on paper is exactly what i want. But the bugs do get in the way of the greater part of the support of the community. Please bethesda take some advice from your fans and act on this.
---
Don't worry.
---
Put In a bug report to support &amp; the scrub-adjusting intern will get to it for patch 16.
---
Dead in the water is by far the bets out of the 3
---
Sell legendaries at 100c per star
---
Not seeing anything new in the first section, maybe next week?
---
I've got a clip on my Xbox named "To infinity...and beyond!" of a player in power armor during mischief night finishing the quest and then rocketing off into space.
---
Where do I find legendaries? I've only been able to find a few so far.
---
Yeah, my gameplay got completed changed by that, I may or may not go on third person mode from time to time while I'm running witouth my favorite custome to feel the power of pay to win.
---
One might assume this shows that we'll probably have Patch 16 before year's end, due to the lack of Christmas stuff.
---
Their random spawns and sometime guaranteed from events (AWOL, Scorched Earth, encrypted, ECT)
---
The dragon is not a viable pvp in the slightest just due to the reload speed if you miss the shot (which you probably will)
---
Oh, ok. Thank you for the assistance.
---
Source?
---
What a logical and measured response to a discussion about a video game patch, having a normal one over here
---
Honestly just roll for weapons at the legendary vendor and sell if you get a good roll
---
Turn on pacifist
---
I wonder if he got banned? Now every time someone replies on something I posted, think it’s him and another account.
---
What an autistic response. Cry moar.
---
Things with explosive bloodied furious or two shot usually sell for a couple more bte
---
Be smart, turn on pacifist and don't engage  them.
---
It's not even superficially not fucked though. It's more like they took it in, fixed random shit you didn't notice and then keyed the outside of it.
---
I called mine Boxie and is my BFF
---
" If you're out adventuring on your own in Pacifist, another player can slam a super sledge into your face from six inches away and not hurt you."  
---
Same thing without pacifist mode.  You still don't take damage from an initial attack with pacifist disabled, and can only deal or take damage if you retaliate.  It's the act of retaliating after being attacked that enables pvp, and only once pvp is enabled can either party hurt the other.
---
So chameleon has absolutely no effect on NPCs?
---
Shit is not food though. He is saying you were given food, just not the food you were hoping for: we were hoping for steak and lobster, but got ramen.
---
It's a sandbox my friend.  Play in the sand.
---
Last night I spent 2 hours waiting on an auction running around the whitespring in a cop outfit smacking ghouls with a baton yelling "stop resisting" or "hes got a gun!".  Got a nice SMG for the gf for my trouble.  I also entertained quite a few people who tracked me down to figure out why I was yelling.  Got a lot of hearts.  Much mirth was had by all.
---
Until we get a real end game the end games what you make of it my friend.
---
Seeing that gives me hope, but, realizing bethesda doesn't care grounds me back to reality.
---
Kill super mutants
---
Ah, buddy - that's just goofy! how does this taint his image? it taints Bethesda's, as they didn't have the foresight to grab the domain of their product before delivering their product. The kid story is working against you as well - that kid is capitalizing on the the candy companies neglect and and seized the opportunity, much the same as the guy who grabbed the domain.
---
Capitalism is not blackmail or extortion - as he isn't threatening anything. as yo why would he keep it - Either he wants them to pay for it, or he wants to give them the middle finger for fucking over what was a great universe.
---
Put in a ticket but I doubt it'll be fixed, thanks for the advice anywho.
---
Those that were crafted as new objects had all new meshes (changed the shape) and textures, these are just retextures so they will apply as a "paint" to existing weapons.
---
Can I display my jumbo mr fuzzys yet
---
Not so much embracing. There are also raiders who are the “bad guys”.
---
you wouldn't take damage even without pacifist mode.  Disable it if you don't believe me.  
---
All disabling pacifist mode does is allow you to retaliate and then engage in pvp.  It also prevents an accidental stray bullet or explosion from damaging a player who is out of pacifist mode, which would allow that person to then engage you in pvp.  
---
But some random walking up to you and attacking you, in an open field, you take 0 damage and pvp never can happen if you ignore them.
---
Sell purified water to robot vendors. If you know the plan and have the mats, craft marine armor helmets and sell those to robot vendors. You can sell 5.56 to players pretty easily for 1c each, so craft as much of that as you can.
---
Wonder if the cake will be a future atom shop item, maybe a free one.
---
I feel like there are a lot of people who could fall in love with a game using FO76's formula, but the bugs are just too big of a hurdle for most people to get over. Wastelanders is an excellent opportunity to give 76 a fresh take and let people experience without the difficulty of the original launch in relation to bugs.
---
Is any of the slime around. Check to the west there's a few ponds with it. My game did the same but I could still pick it up and drop in the blue barrel
---
The market
---
Do you wait to have 100 maps from various regions or 100 from each specific location to start digging?
---
they fixed that recently.  no longer initiates from electrically charged or similar.
---
Dammit, I said this before to someone else (heck it might have even been you), but quit making me LOL at work.. I'm supposed to be working, not reading /r/f076
---
I haven’t seen any of the goo but I’ll be sure to check
---
Think so
---
Bethesda tried to suggest he "exploited" the bug several hundreds of times, which is of course nonsense.  In reality he was informed of an exploit that people were able to use a memory reader/injector (sometimes called a "cheat engine" but that's not really what it does) in order to get the purveyor to sell legendary weapons for caps.  According to him, he wasn't really even able to make it work, but somebody on his team did the next day and reported it to Bethesda, so he never bothered also reporting the exact same thing.  
---
Instead of giving them a fucking medal they banned him for "exploiting it" along with his group.
---
Why did they spend this much time trying to figure out the exploit?  2 reasons.
---
1: Bethesda is hot garbage at fixing bugs and they've been that way for ages.  I work in a software company, it's a running joke that the known issues list is the "Bethesda" list.  Leave it to community members to make sure they have a thorough review so Bethesda can fix the low hanging fruit, because no way they'd have immediately dropped everything and spent days finding the memory error that was causing this.  
---
2: This was basically ratfucking the in-game economy because it was flooding the market with cheap legendaries people were using exploits to get.  These guys have invested thousands of hours into the game and the markets were going to complete shit over this bug.  It was a huge deal that it get fixed ASAP, and honestly what more people should be talking about, because it was a major black eye that Bethesda even let this hit live servers.  This is the kind of stuff other games would have done rollbacks over, and Bethesda instead banned the guys reporting it and tried to bury it was even happening.
---
Also agreed. It gives me access to literally grind steel supplies for hours for ammo without worrying about inventory.
---
Exactly the reason I made this :D
---
It is pretty reasonable where it is,  it could use a tweak to how fast it breaks.  It is in line damage wise with other ranged weapons that have no down side like Bloodied/Junkies.
---
Did you see today's patch notes? Menial change + it's a Fallout 1st issue, I wouldn't be surprised if they did a hotfix for it :)
---
Like Dying Light.  When the sun goes down in that game you best get your butt in a camp.  
---
I would love to experience us vault dwellers holed up in some abandoned building fighting together to keep the freaks out until dawn finally breaks.
---
Neat! Thank you,
---
Right but I mean canonically, we haven't even heard that she is officially dead either. Logically it makes sense, but we just don't know yet.
---
The private servers don’t appeal to me either, I just bought one month and I don’t think I’ll continue my subscription.
---
Agreed
---
WTF did I just read?
---
Nice.
---
Ha!  Looking at past posts, it seems it was.
---
If you always reload crouched it is fine.
---
It's funny because this is the first wallpaper that I would have instantly spent the atoms on. Figures. I guess this makes up for the yellow wall paper that I bought just to try out the wallpaper system.
---
This stuff is going up in my wilsons garage shop asap.
---
That may be true in some genres, but coming from the mmorpg genre primarily it doesn't really hold true.
---
I'm not very exact with it i just wait til i have a ton of maps from Various regions (almost dont bother with Forest Maps not worth it IMO). Most places i end up with 4-5 maps per dig spot. I throw on my High Capacity Backpack Lvl3 Thru-hiker.
---
That's why they postponed it to work out the bugs it doesnt make sense to do a beta otherwise it might as well just be out and patched along the way which we seen how that went when the game first came out no ty fix it before it its out this time please
---
Game still freezes when consuming aid
---
250 Dr still breaks legendaries
---
enemies either not taking damage or fully healing when you hit them
---
Melee hits not registering

Ghouls sliding toward you on the ground

Enemies killed by energy goo was supposed to be fixed now it's even worse than before lmao
---
Server crashes

Game crashes
---
Rampant dupes
---
Is alcohol weight not reduced by the food/drink weight reduction armor legendary?
---
Thank you all. I'm probably the unluckiest man in the world, but I'll keep trying. I will accumulate a lot of maps before digging.
---
A vampire’s shotgun especially explosive is a quick way to heal, I tend to use 10mm SMGs on my commandos and VE 50 cal on my heavy (pretty light carrying it with Bear Arms 3).  Generally faster firing or pellet based helps.
---
Are beer kegs the next P2W item then?
---
"Purist" or "Purifier" could have a nice ring to it.
---
There's no way Wastelanders is gonna be as big as people are suggesting it is.  I mean, they literally didn't have NPC's in the game at all and that had to be a direction they took early on in development.  Adding all that in later on an already finished game is a mountain of work and they're absolutely not up to the task.
---
If they get rid of the timers that would suffice, IMO. If someone wants to pour resources into a one hour slog through a vault to complete it at their own pace then they should let them.
---
Yeah and maybe haul ass to a couple of safezones like Watoga or White Springs so that the robots could help....that would be amazing
---
"It's Grafton Day...again!"

 and then they was something like:

(there are enough from they u can choose)

\*iam not 100% sure cuz its a long time ago i finisht that\*

My build is this one. I can get a legacy one and have some as well. I have good trades. I’d like highest damage.

---
I have no idea what you're rambling about
---
This was during a dupe wave, so if you did that and knew people, you’d have 4 or so fully loaded before entering PvP
---
If Wastelanders flops, I will have given up all hope for this game.
---
LOL, you are calling other people "sheep" and tell them to grow up when you are a victim of one of the biggest scams in gaming history?! And learn to spend your money wisely and in a way that don't affect the community, you braindead SHEEP.
---
This isn't an MMORPG. Even Todd Howard said players should stop with that.
---
But if you want to go there, *every* single MMORPG I've played have had much, much more content than F76.
---
They should have made the table a display item but for food and food-related junk like cups and plates. You would change up your 6 place settings and a centerpiece slot. A table full of Perfectly Preserved Pies would be neat to see, instead of a 4 slot box that looks like everything else.
---
That's fair, I am still playing albeit infrequently. But I only bought it in April. So we might have played for the same timeframe. Point is, I'm about at my limit. I don't know what to do anymore. Wastelanders needs a lot of content to keep the people like me, hanging on, interested. It can't be all new players, you need the veterans there to do the damage and know what to do with quests
---
Pay to win
---
Bwahaha. Peace my dude stay angry. ✌️
---
If you have any atom shop neon billboards, they ballooned the budget cost on the mothman(?) billboards several patches ago and it caused an over budget issue for some people similar to what you're describing (mostly the last thing you said about scrapping not seeming to do anything... try scrapping a billboard if you have one.)
---
On the atomic shop, they never say either way, but the mote we drift from canon there the less this game looks like a fallout game.
---
On the second point I disagree, anyone roleplaying as a commie coming out of vault 76 is  still going to keep the disguise up. Anyone blatantly embracing the aesthetics of the motherland is going to wind up dead fast.
---
They even had standing orders to blend with the local populace from their superiors at the end.
---
I've experienced similar.  I scrapped furniture to replace it with something new, only to find I couldn't build the new item nor rebuild the old one.  I have now scrapped three items and still cannot replace the furniture.  I suspect there was an unmentioned budget nerf in the update.
---
Idk about you, but I've killed her 1,000 times...story wise that's how the game (as it stands now) ends. Nuking White Springs isn't cannon, nuking FSP is.
---
Lay off the glowing meat steaks.
---
It probably is. I'll have to check. That 1 lb. per drink adds up fast.
---
The sheepsquatch never shows up at the injured super mutant encounter. It's one of a few "teasers" like the corpse of a brahmin killed by a mysterious quill attack, and the "distant sheepsquatch howl" you may also sometimes hear. They're just little  clues that you can possibly encounter before you see your first sheepsquatch.
---
Where did Todd say that?
---
And some do, others do not. This game is a hybrid but it comes from RPG roots, has an RPG story, and we are massively hanging out with all the other players, so we are just going to disagree on what this game is
---
What it did for me was cut down time spent transferring junk from one character or another, which itself was a huge benefit since I get to actually play F076 instead of Inventory Management Simulator '19 ©. I would highly recommend it for everyone.
---
The story as presented ends when you launch a nuke on anything 
---
We can't even say that is canon because literally every one of us does it.
---
We have no idea what is canon or not till they advance the story and clarify.
---
I've reported bugs with video evidence of me doing it. I'm inclined to believe the official line from Bethesda that the guy exploited it egregiously before getting banned.
---
No way. Good for Bethesda for finally correcting one of their many mistakes. This should have been released before any other wallpapers but at least they know they fucked up. Thanks for the heads up!
---
No. The guy use a exploit for 4 hours. And them he doesn't report the exploit.
---
Didn't people just get banned for data mining?
---
Buy peoples serums for about 300 caps and sell them to the vendors and profit.
---
Yeah, it would bring more players in I think. Better for everyone. 
---
At the very least they should make it free for anyone who logged time in the game during 2018 and anyone who bought at least one month of Fallout 1st, even if they cancelled it after the month was up.
---
Yeah, account wide would be perfect, I'm always so nervous to transfer anything
---
I've reported exploits (including dupes) with video evidence of me doing it. I'm inclined to believe the official line from Bethesda that the guy exploited it egregiously before getting banned
---
But, Fallout 1st!
---
In my experience you can't keep the mobs from noticing you if they get close. They seem hyper aware in this event. Don't let any of the adds get right next to you and you will stay hidden from the queen. I you get spotted, kill the adds and use escape artist to get back into stealth.
---
🤦‍♂️I'm done with this conversation, have a nice day or evening.
---
Bloodied FFR +50dr while aiming Gatling Plasma.
---
or Bloodied Explosive +50DR whlie aiming Gatling Plasma.
---
Or Gauss
---
Hardly.
---
You all keep saying cannon like this game actually has a story
---
Alright thanks
---
Might be crazy enough  to work lol
---
First off, turn on pacifist mode. Second, sell everything you don't use. Build purifiers and sell water. I will walk around and pick up everything until I am almost overencumbered and sell EVERYTHING I don't use. This includes meat, vegetables, weapons and armor. If I don't use it or want it, it gets sold until I use all the caps at the vendor and then everything gets scrapped. I sell the better legendaries I get in my vending machine, scrip the rest for new legendaries and repeat. Look up on this sub for things that sell. 5.56 ammo sells fast, you can make a ton if you have the resources.
---
Make purifiers.
---
Sell water.
---
Profit.
---
I'm surprised people still give this company a chance. You really think they can pull something like this off? Are you really willing to test a product for a company that only cares about your money and nothing else? Have some standards.
---
There is an alpha....... you paid $70 for it
---
This happens to me too after only a few hops. It's been an ongoing problem since I began playing in June.
---
What RPG story has it? Have you made any decisions *at all* in this game? You can't even choose between different dialogues. This is a looter shooter, nothing more.
---
I Run a junkies heavy build with JE harpoon ,gat and 50 cal with 2dary non ex 50 cal and gat for those close quarter encounters . I like running lock and loaded with bear arms and heavy perks so much fun.
---
Was building a high health character for my 3rd build I have a VE assault rifle and a non ex combat shotty but I like the HM more will see how that turns out but I need to finish a vanguard set to help it along.
---
"All your monies are belong to us!"

Inventory Management Simulator '19© by Bethesda Softworks, in stores soon, pre-order now and get the exclusive Bic© pen DLC to better track inventory
---
Visual detection still works and chameleon helps that but not by much. The only stealth build you need is 3 sneak and escape artist or one piece of harder to detect. Harder to detect is equivalent to 3 sneak. Use escape artist often. Meaning stand and crouch quickly to try to loose danger status.
---
My two favorites are:
---
1. Point Pleasant: grab the mothman eggs at the statue and shrine by the river, cook (using super duper if you have it) and sell. usually around 300 caps for 10 minutes work.
---
2. Blackwater Mine: Clear it out, especially with Uranium Fever, sell the weapons, black titanium (you can always get more) and glowing steaks (usually around 10c per) to robot vendor. Take varies but I would say 800-1200 c depending on your charisma. Time usually about 15 minutes
---
Wait, really? That's an actual work around? Mind blown...
---
Thank you for that tip.
---
The shill is strong in this post, idiots forking over dough for nothing does effect everyone as a whole, it creates a paywall atmosphere and more green lights for BGS to keep on keeping on with this type of behavior. Not broke, but also not interested in BGS's overpriced all you can eat garbage buffet of "content" and monthly dose of discounted but paid atoms(they are not free, you sub for atoms, that's it, the other shit is the freebies or perks of the sub). People will never "get along" or "bury the hatchet" on this subject....stop trying to be the voice of reason, it's just silly.
---
Nope but ultracite bolts are not hard to make and come in very large stacks.  You could probably make two stacks and be good for a week easy.  Dont know what prefix you got but a bloodied prime crossbow should one shot most anything short of a Sierra bravo etc.  I'm sure someone in the redit market can either make you some, sell you some, or outright sell you the primed plans.
---
Hmm, no native american outfit to go with Pilgrim? 😮
---
[Here's a pic of it.](https://i.imgur.com/NFzofEW.png)
---
I am. For all of the bad in this game, there is still something there that I see and want to play. It's a game with good bones and bad guts. Honestly, I play it right now because I am busy with work and when I'm off it is kinda nice to just zone out and sink a few hours into. 
---
I may as well be putting those hours to some use and maybe improving the experience for some of the rest of us who are still here, for one reason or another.
---
Absolutely. I would rather have the scrapbox than a perfect set of armor and weapons. It's the most game changing feature they've added to the game. The amount of time it saves you massively outweighs having more damage and killing things slightly faster.
---
I assume its all the people who thougjt otherwise and are just convinced they are right
---
Thanks
---
He didn't report it because his mates already did. He was still in contact with them about the exploit to check on the status of it getting fixed. Then he got perma banned for using the program. Which is how he found it to begin with. 
---
Meanwhile, all of the actual cheaters in the game aren't touched. And even video evidence isn't enough for a perma ban. Only three days. 
---
If we're talking about the same person that is.
---
I like the different things, but I wish there were Responders things added before Chinese.
---
You can absolutely make choices along the way. There are people who haven't even completely finished all of the quests because of decisions they have made because of the information presented in the story.
---
This game is more of an RPG than most electronic RPGs because it is an open stage. You can roleplay almost anything.
---
I was affected positively by this week's patch notes... just not by much. The patch notes seem to be doing only a few things as they are focusing most of their resources on Wastelanders, I hope it will be worth the wait.
---
I think it's optimistic to think the game is still at that point of depending on anything. 
---
IMHO the ship sank 3 or 4 flops ago. At least if we are talking about public opinion. There's no coming back from release, the first update, the update that reintroduced the release bugs, paid repair kits, adding battle royale, and adding paid subscriptions in the current state.
---
I've heard conflicting things. I've read that he used cheat software to gain access to an exploit and then posted about it. (But didn't submit a support ticket because a friend did.)  
---
They banned him for violating the T.o.S.  
---
It's debatable if they made the right call, but certainly no one should be publicly sharing exploits.
---
For 500 is nice! Some skins go for 800+
---
It does, a very in depth story.
---
agreed - at least we finally got it though
---
Hey! They also fixed the color of the scrapbox. Yep. The color.
---
K bye, enjoy your headcanon.
---
It's a minor convienience, at best, with the only difference being the 10 min at a time I save by not having to transfer junk to another character. 
---
Since I still have to transfer guns, ammo, food, armor, misc, notes, bobbleheads, magazines, plans, recipes, holos and whatever else is clogging up my inventory to my mule anyways, I don't know how much time it does actually save me if any.
---
Bummer. Usually when I hear a howl though I can find a sheepsquatch nearby. Regardless the injured super mutant has some pretty funny lines.
---
I know I couple people who will like a few of the fixes. Really nothing major though. We need jet packs fixed.
---
Not to mention the immortality glitch in PvP they have yet to fix.
---
Nah, the issue at hand is that someone else in his group reported it.  So he didn't report it.  Bethesda then just blank banned people attempting it who didn't report it, nabbing people in his group in the process.  Instead of being like "oh cool, that was a mistake" they doubled down on it.  Standard corporate level dumbfuckery.  
---
The idea that you've submitted videos and things got done is bullshit.  I mean, *gestures broadly at any game of NW.*
---
Glad to see it back up... that info about legendary drops being manipulated is interesting to say the least.
---
Seriously, does anyone actually pay attention or care about icons? I'm never like, "Oh wow, your icon is so cool! You are one cool dude for having that icon!"
---
Love the wallpaper though. More more more!
---
What the hell is cuthoart?
---
I have a feeling that this is a team resources issue where they cannot balance handling bugfixes *and* working on getting Wastelanders finished at the same time.
---
So it seems the new "unclaimed free item notification" is working as intended.
---
There are no decisions that impact the game or other players. None at all. It's a dead wasteland.
---
Not a terrible assumption to make to be honest.
---
It needs it, but I think they will make that apart of fallout 1st. I'm pretty much done with the game until wastelanders. I just get so bored.
---
Bug free and Bethesda don't go together. They just don't. 
---
But agreed. We should be testing the hell out of Wastelanders. Use your community Bethesda. We work for free.
---
Scrapbox should be for everyone. 100%
---
No, they got banned for exploiting. They datamined too, but it wasn't part of their ban.
---
Any chance you have a datamined source with the exact numbers or some other kind of evidence? 
---
The only reason I ask is because I tend to get completely different answers from everybody and they never have a reliable source.
---
***" Until we get a real end game the end games what you make of it my friend. "***
---
!!! Nothing more to say !!!     i am totaly with you !!!
---
Might wanna be careful sending in tickets and reporting bugs. Bethesda might ban your account like they did that other guy
---
I mostly just stop playing for the day till the limits reset.
---
depends on your level.
---
If you have PA, excavator preferably, put it on, then:
---
If lower level, go to morgantown - run the airport, do the even there, then loot everything you can pick up.  Go to morgantown station.
---
equip hard bargain and pop a grape mentats, and sell everything you just picked up.  repeat at the high school, the go back to the airport adn do it again.
---
If you are a higher level, run the WS cottacge loop, then the outside of backwater.  Again, pick up everything.  Sell it to the bot vendor at WS station.  Repeat.
---
I know 2 runs like that through WS will be max caps.
---
You have raider power armor crafting plans? I wasn’t aware they existed.
---
I have multiple issues reported that haven't been fixed, I didn't mean to make it sound like I didn't. It's entirely possible that is the issue and not him personally doing the exploit hundreds of times.
---
Following that logic no decision made in any game ever impacts anything.
---
You can absolutely make decisions that affect other players in this game. I get the feeling you are trying to lead this into a permadeath argument though
---
And people buy them?
---
nothing \^\^  at least it cost u not even more than 10 caps... u can craft it easy by yourself ;)
---
They did treat him properly. He used cheat engine in a game that bans you for using cheat engine. And he got banned. Can't get more proper than that.
---
does it still let you display power armor frames?
---
I too would like to know the answer to this question as a person who produces nuka shine as often as I find nuka cola quantum
---
What never lived cannot die
---
I was thinking more of a true beta instead of just early access for everyone with FO1st.
---
At least we can sleep better knowing the gameplay bugs affect both normal and private servers. /s
---
All the other Fallouts changed with your decisions. *That's* what makes an RPG. Here? We are told to "rebuild" in a world where nothing you do makes any difference.
---
Permadeath? Why? Didn't even think about it - but no. Not interested in that.
---
It’s basically whatever you would pay for quantum.
---
I just bought it, it lets you display 6 items.
---
I wish they could have an option in the menus to choose which one we want, I personally preferred the Wild Appalachia one.
---
So long as youtubers are excluded - I'd be fine.
---
The last thing the game needs is another wave of profit-motivated hate from certain youtubers.
---
This.
---
MMOG Fails mentioned in a comment that the map76 guy never reported any of the exploits he used and his account had good amount of exploited items. Whether or not it’s true, I really don’t care. I have no sympathy for cheaters. The map76 guy even admitted to using cheat engine.
---
The entire game is built up on collecting scrap. By being able to store infinite scrap, the advantages are huge, and anyone who says it isn't is just being intentionally blind towards it. Literally everything in this game requires scrap. Many of us cannot store a lot of flux due to their immense weight, while a pay to win member can store thoudands of pounds without having to throw anything away. Plus, not having scrap take up space on your stash means way more space to store gear. Many times we have to throw away good gear just because out stash is full. Calling it a minor convenience is like saying that having a huge inheritance is a minor convenience as opposed to not having one.
---
This. I have a AAFFR Radium and Furious FFR LMG sitting in my stash with this bugged suffix. It's currently a deal breaker on most weapons.
---
This is what Fallout 1st is for! Why do you think they called it Fallout 1st??
---
How do you fuck up picking a colour in the first place. And then how do you justify spending the time to fix something that is so arbitrary when all else is shit.
---
Yup, they do. After an unspeakable amount of maps all I am missing now is two pieces of the T-60 and I can craft them all.
---
if i remember right u have to solve the first pioneer padges ,  
---
and then theoppo. values shown to you ?!?...  
---
but iam not rly shure, to long time ago
---
There's a lot of balancing that needs to be done. I really wish we'd get at least a few weapon/perk/legendary effect balances in each patch.
---
&gt; “BuT jUsT uSe A bLOoDiEd BuiLd” 
---
LOL I see that so much. Especially when I mention how much weaker pistols are than other gun types.
---
If nothing else let nuking the other fissure sites spawn queens if only for some terrain variability in the fight.
---
My lvl 10 alt had the misfortune to find a 3* one while fending off robots and Scorched just above the Whitesprings Station. First time I saw one, and I was on the wrong character!!
---
I'd say he definitely got banned since he hasn't posted in a while but he could also just be using yet another alt account. Have to keep a lookout for his psn unless he changed that too. Dude is a pro scammer and scammed me out of weapons in the market reddit. My fault for going first on the trade but he's still a fucking glorified raider 😂
---
Plus there are some really good MOD quests. Can't remember the names now but there was one that had a disco, strip club and a gang of pimps in it. Quite good and very large.
---
Did they? Your personal decisions had zero impact on the canonical ending unless you happened to chose the one choice that ended up the canonical ending.
---
Your choice may have meant something to you, but in the end it means nothing to how the story actually turned out.
---
It is absolutely no different with 76. The difference is you don't get to see ending cinematics about how your choices turned out, because there is no ending. But it still won't change the canonical ending and never has.
---
No, directly fueling it would be buying it yourself.  Making friends with someone who already has it and playing on their private world is indirect, like I said.
---
Literately no one: ""
---
Bethseda: "We finally fixed the floating shrubs in Flatwoods "
---
Don't want you to break a nail while you're in the forest region. Try the mire or cranberry bog.
---
Sounds hellish
---
The whole game is bugged what else is new?
---
It defeats the purpose of the game
---
I thought I read somewhere that there would be more raid releases. I just hope they implement matchmaking before they release another...
---
Also agree with you 100% on alternative final bosses. I feel like each region should have its own final boss... It would give me more excuses to visit the Ash Heap or Toxic Valley.
---
We'll take a look into this. What platform are you on?
---
No issues here on xbox.
---
Probably reverse engineered american technology. After all, you can find a suit och regular PA down in the Communist bunker under Mama Dolces. That bunker and the dead communist also clearly shows that there were communist infiltrators living among the Americans during the time of the war.
---
Better workaround, always use adventure before leaving the game for the day. And don't ever be in NW when the challenges reset or the server is about to go for a maintenance.
---
I have not seen anyone requesting fixes to the main menu. Nor a single complaint about floating shrubs.
---
He's the game's only dev all day... then he goes home and he's the game's only player
---
Yes it is, at least in America it is. I cycle my ip nearly weekly. Could also go with ip release and then renew command if you don't want to power down your router.
---
Does this also work with the gamma gun? Like if you shoot an enemy doesn't the radiation aura from the gamma projectile impact irradiate nearby players?
---
I swear I got killed by that a few times.
---
Actually you'll be pretty upset when they release legendary status to find out all your 300 levels wont stack into 3 legendaries but count as one so there will be no difference between his legendary or yours.
---
Tbh even if Wastelanders isn't as good as Bethesda and this community make it out to be I would keep playing for a long while but they better nail those fucking character interactions
---
Something not mentioned here that I can see is that the Mainframe Cores in Nuke Silos can no longer be destroyed for that section by shooting them with an explosive weapon anymore. Have to manually do them all.
---
the vault tec clock is in Fort Defiance, I know of for sure. Some VTU stuff is in the frat houses you go to for Bivs initial quest.
---
True statement, for a modern engine. 
---
But if your still driving old tech, you can get a little more than 2 weeks out of it. 
---
My old 80s F-150 went 4 months with a cracked head ... Bethesda uses old tech.
---
They had around a year since release of the base game and there are still critical bugs since then...How would that help them fix things if they aren't even able to fix bugs one year after their report?
---
Don't get me wrong I'm all for public Alphas/Betas and test servers but I highly doubt Bethesda would have the necessary skills and competence to fix something in a few months if there still are any critical bugs in Wastelanders in addition to base game bugs
---
Bye.
---
The shelf the typewriter and bear are on is actually a new display case.
---
No judgement here; just thought to try the meme, but apparently it didn't go over well. Owell, better luck next time.
---
Excellent, I'll start there. Thanks.
---
I too am waiting for this - i'm hoping that with the expansion of the class in Wastelanders we'll see some then
---
Or maybe randomize it. 🤷‍♂️
---
It's not just about the ending, it's the decisions you make along the way. 
---
Following your logic, why do you do anything in life? You're gonna die anyway.
---
I think that’s how I clicked on he was a scammer. I saw his psn name and I’d just read a trading post with the list of scammers, he was on there. After looking at both profiles I realised it was the same person.  If he was that clever he wouldn’t of posted his psn name on 2 different accounts. He’s probably got loads more and if you don’t check that list, you wouldn’t know.
---
You're right I think they really should and agree with I just don't think will end up doing it very sadly.
---
&gt; A bug free (or close enough) launch 
---
Man... I don't wanna be the guy that bursts your bubble, but I think it's unavoidable here. This development team has been making games as one iteration of Bethesda Softworks or another since 1986. Look at their catalogue of games. *THEY HAVE NEVER RELEASED A REMOTELY STABLE OR BUG FREE GAME*. Their games are almost universally fantastic, but Wastelanders is going to release broken as hell. This is what Bethesda does. If the success of FO76 is riding on Wastelanders being functional and stable at release, you should look into getting at least a partial refund.
---
I’d think that would be a great idea but I just have a funny feeling that Wastelanders was pushed back to release Fallout 1st so they can lock some of the Wastelanders content behind that membership, I really really hope that isn’t the case though.
---
No mention of fixing the game crashing bug that happens when you use an aid item in the pip boy huh? :/
---
Still no text chat.
---
And still nothing about expanding CAMP budget/stashs. I keep running into the same issue that my camp budget is too maxed out that I can't even use my fermentor to make booze. Magazines/bobbleheads/display items should NOT take up camp budget damn it.
---
Not going to read comments maybe should but to fix it just go collect the bones and never complete the quest, keep the bones on u and u will never hear from the mayor again
---
There won't be - they'll just release it untested by the community then there will come about a plethora of bugs, glitches, crashes, and most importantly exploits. It's happened literally every single content patch Bethesda has done so far...
---
I think they did way back in November last year.
---
or, we make the alpha/beta cost 1 signed blank cheque from every user and watch people jump for the chance to pay more money
---
The flag is for showing people you want your base nuked.
---
Welcome to the world of F*** you give me more money. The subs will become and stay a priority at Bethesda.
---
yes, but i could also craft ammo. but it is easier to buy.
---
Hey! Have you tested this out since? Cheers!
---
I make about $4 a month on my little ad. $30 or more a month for hosting, depending on bandwidth. So that is $4-$30=-$26 dollars. Damn, I didn't do the math before, but you are right. That will be some good revenue. In a year I will make -$312 dollars.
---
That was the number of cap stashes and how the cap collector perk worked. This is different. I took about 2 months off and since I came back it's very obvious that they changed it.
---
It's just frustrating.  I want to like the game, and I love the Fallout IP, but Bethesda is totally blowing this one.  Right now the Map76 fiasco was totally not worth the ban.  They drove away people helping to build the community over something dumb.  At some point somebody human needs to admit they screwed up.  The reality is this hard-nosed stance on all these controversies and failures makes Bethesda's leadership look like weakness.  If they can't admit where they're wrong, they don't show anyone they're learning from it.
---
..or at least if it was really dark and you could accidentally walk up on stuff because you can't see it well.
---
They really need to put a gamma slider in the game. 
---
On PC we can use overlays to do this but everyone should be able to experience this game with truly dark nights and dramatic sunsets like the game had back in 2018 before they screwed up the gamma for the sake of people with crap TV's.
---
So you haven't played in a year and you are coming here to share that? Why wait a year to tell us this? Secondly, you could send this directly to Bethesda as a letter or email, it might be more impactful then throwing it into the saltmarsh this sub can be.
---
Before the scrap box i played a few times a week, I would like the scrap box but don't play the game enough to justify paying $100 a year(I also don't think I could bring myself to give Zenimax that kind of money unless it was for some amazing amount of content as I have no interest in private servers personally), I don't really care if Zenimax is going to paywall cosmetics/assets from F4 but seeing features I would like but would not pay for in the game just makes me play less/not at all.
---
Use ur alt characters as mules
---
I've seen a few still have 100 but it is really rare if you get the perk card you can reroll them after looting to double dip and also use the bobblehead to get better returns.
---
You can try out Junkies, its +50% damage with 5 addictions and you can even do a drug like psycho and an alcohol to add to damage (too bad they never implemented the firecracker whisky so everything could deal burning damage). But I do agree the shishkebab needs a buff, I really like it and now that we have Samurai Outfit with Mempo.... come oooooonnnnnn amirite?

---
First of all - plan on being close - not melee close, but kind of close. This is NOT a crit build.  You will not be killing things super quickly unless you are using an instigating shotgun.  Instigating shotguns with full perks and bloody mess will one shot max level scorched, ghouls, and mole miners.  AA and a QE will do well for regular murder type activites.
---
This is a speed run build for silos - but works really well with any FFR shotgun in a control situation.  I also use it on SBQ so heavy gunners and bloody buddies don't get bothered by trash mobs.
---
Shotguns are not super high damage weapons, even with full perks, they max out at 200-ish damage with all pellets on target.  They are a *control* weapon.  Think of shotgun builds more like tanks in traditional MMOs.  Cripple, move, dispatch at your leisure.
---
The MOST important thing about shotguns is that they have pellets, and those pellets trigger as they are each a single shot, dividing damage by 8 (so if you are doing 80 damage, each "pellet" shows 10 damage).  The multi trigger works GREAT if you do a crit build and Four Leaf Clover.  It also triggers MASSIVE health regen with Vampire prefixes, and is wonderful for a Vanguard build, or for sitting in front of cranky enemies while your bloody build buddies DPS.
---
Sorry for the novel! Any questions, lemme know.
---
Also - YES there is a health bug, but I have ONLY seen it with Instigating Explosive in the last three weeks, and the calculation that is resolved after the "bug" is the actual damage that should have been, due to a miscalculation of all damage with modifiers.  This no longer *seems* to be the same bug that happens with autos, though it used to affect ALL my shotguns, that no longer happens.
---
imigur is blocked at my school rip
---
How would this work?
---
No more than 100 caps.
---
1st are 1st.
---
When duping was rampant, everyone was shouting, "We can't you be more proactive with exploits BGS???". Now that they are doing just that it's "Why the hell are you prioritizing exploits BGS???"
---
Yep, they do howl when you see them, but there is also a specific random encounter called "distant sheepsquatch howl" that just plays the sound when you enter a trigger area. Anyone interested in the raw data can see the record [here](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/00402AA4).
---
I'm pretty sure they first started appearing with the Van Lowe/Encryptid/Impostor Sheepsquatch update, which was 2 weeks before the real sheepsquatch started appearing in the game. I think it's actually pretty cool that they added these little clues before anyone had even seen the real thing.
---
Yeah assassins weapons should be double damage on players not 10%. It would sort of force a new more balanced meta for PVP.
---
But you can make decisions along the way. You can choose to become a mutant or not, you can choose to launch a nuke or not, you can choose to help the raider robot or not. You can choose to become a mistress of mystery or not. 
---
You can even go beyond programed quest and pick up where the firebreathers left off if you so desire and literally play that role in your interactions with others in the game.
---
Thays why he was killed off and will be used as a weapon agaisnt trump instead of shedding on the left's disgusting sick shot they do
---
I so badly want to make a nocturnal build, but I find it hard to try to even finish it...
---
Some speculate the Atomshop departement might be using a FO4 "copy" running the 76 map for their showoff
---
would also explain how somebody once got the save selector from FO4 in his main menu
---
Did you just write a Dear John letter to a gaming company?  You know you guys dont have to break up.  You can just take a break and see other gaming companies.  This doesnt have to be the end bro.  You two make an adorable couple, just sayin.
---
Inventory Management Simulator '19 ... lol I have felt this way about this game for awhile now.  And I have a 1st sub too- honestly at first it made a big difference, but I've been feeling like I'm playing the inventory simulator again lately... I think I'm just a hoarder.
---
They could let the fallout 1st people try it and see what works and what doesn't. Many of the bugs I've reported have been fixxed so at least I can see someone is listening and trying to get something right.
---
Yep, I paid, I won. I beat you in the game. You can stop playing now.
---
Depends on the area, ive found 100+ cap stashes around the bog but @20ish caps in the forest
---
Why the fuck is this getting downvotes lmao
---
Hello Fellow Canadian!
---
Sign me up
---
I say it's minor because of two points: 1) how little scrap I actually use versus what I need, 2) and that there is no difference in the amount of scrap I hold today versus 2 months ago, only difference is its on one character not the other. About the first point, do I need 300 crystal shards, 400 glass shards or 1k leather? No, not really, I dont ever use them, and that goes for 90% of my scrap. I repair weapons and armor with improved repair kits, my camp has been fully built, and the scrap trade to vendors is useless when you can craft serums. With the second point, my mules have always held my excess stuff and not clogged up my main so that's never affected me, and that's the only thing that's changed. I don't have to transfer stuff back and forth, which it very rarely ever went back to my main anyway cause I never ended up using it, just hoarded it "just in case", which is what I think a lot of people do if they are being honest.
---
I like to buy atomic shop stuff when it's on sale because it's usually fixed by then
---
I don't think locking it to FO1st would be good optica leading up to Wastelanders, and I don't think having a beta testing group as large as all FO1st subscribers is really productive.
---
They've already said it will stack. Level 150 would get 3 'level ups' (they didn't call it that but I'm doing it for ease of explaining). We just don't know what that will actually do.
---
You quit playing Fallout 76 a year ago over a canvas bag?
---
That cornucopia. So...thick. So......inviting.
---
🦃👋😏
---
I'm just going to unfollow this sub. Sucks to say but, it's almost been a year and I still dont hear many good things about 76. What a waste of $100... or whatever the Tricentenial was.
---
I've noticed this also, to be honest I've not been checking them much recently. The one upstairs in the Antiques place near the Asylum has given me 10/20c. Use to grab 100c+ even without the card. Will check again and report back.
---
Just an FYI concerning Battlebot: once you've initially gotten the security protocols from the sentry bot and the Alpha and Beta keys from the Gutseys, you don't have to pick them up from the corpses on subsequent events.
---
I just don't understand how scummy you have to be to make a post full well knowing that people in this reddit are typically really kind and take advantage of that kindness for your own gain. Which honestly kinda upsets me because there's actual players who are young and on hard times that wouldn't dare ask for help because of how prideful they are and don't want to be seen as a charity case. Those people are the ones that deserve the help instead.
---
I think laser and plasma weaponry is the same damage whether you make it pistol or rifle. I have a TS FRR plasma pistol and it obliterates enemies with vats criticals. One critical hit burst is 6 rounds thanks to the fire rate and extra projectile. All projectiles hit at 100% accuracy and they refill critical meter to full instantly.
---
Don't let the dogs bite your ass on the way out. They don't like bull shitters.
---
"Sweet canvas bag"
---
Really? I mean I ordered it because I wanted the helmet, and the helmet was fuckin' awesome. It never occurred to me that the bag was even in that package.
---
It deflates the porpoise of this game
---
He might like downvotes.
---
Not everyone uses mules.
---
There's loads in Morgantown right? As far as I know it's the biggest concentration of them in one area? I've been saving bobble heads for a wee trip one day and check them all out over the whole map. Learn the routes etc.
---
Bye
---
It the feets the fur purse of his grain
---
There were around 73 fixes/updates in patch 15 and Fallout 1st only got 18 of them.
---
As a subscriber, I think everyone should get it. 
---
It could be argued that the ability to hoard thousands of steel, lead, acid and cloth does provide a competitive advantage, at least in a roundabout way.  All I have to do is find a tinkers bench when I run low on ammo, rather than having to spend an hour going to Lucky Hole and West Tek to gather supplies ahead of time.
---
With unlimited junk space, I can just pick up steel and lead as I go, and not worry what 5000 units will do to my stash space.
---
&gt;But instead of it being an ungodly number of players cramming in only a few weeks before launch to test the servers have it be an actual Alpha or B.E.T.A. and let a handful of players get in and find the bugs months before release.
---
Hot take. How about they hire a QA team to do it.
---
It defeats the purrpiss of the game
---
When did we leave beta?? Lol
---
I'm not sure why this reply made me laugh, but thanks I needed that!
---
Because some people are not at the lvl they need to be or want to do the quest. Let me also state that I only charge for items that I have to buy and not items I can farm. If the person wants it a.s.a.p. then they can donate the required junk to make it, wait for me or them to farm the items or pay for me to either buy the items or buy them themselves. I never charge for the labor or mods.
---
Seems like it's every stash. I used to see amounts all over the place. Now 90% of them have 10-20 caps and the amount you get from cap collector seems nerfed as well.
---
Yeah, I have two BFSS Shishkebabs and can't even manage to sell them.
---
They’ve said Scorched Earth will still be around post-Wastelanders, as will fissures and normal scorchbeasts.
---
Agree about the shrubs, but I have seen several posts asking to change the main menu back. I mean why care?, but some definitely did.
---
Only those of us who were doing far more advanced stuff. The Atomic Shop stuff is basically inside the Patch 15 game file that we all downloaded which can be read by approved bethesda programs that the community made for previous games. And the lead data-miner, Eckeserah was unbanned and white listed for future work.
---
I just hope you wern't drinking milk when the laugh came.  That could be messy.
---
they've been in since the summer. I hope we'll see them but gave up on hope for them.  Probably the ammo convertor or there is a freezer coming now too
---
You realize cheat engine is just the name on it right? I have use it for scanning memory in my professional work as it is the best memory scanning tool I have found. I have clarified dozens of times that I did not use it on the account that was banned. You brand ambassadors are just broken records. The debugger was never attached to the game.
---
Doesnt look like it
---
Works too, but then I would love an option to drop some of them out of rotation.
---
This is a great idea! It would certainly make it extremely fun and quite scary out at night lmao. Furthermore, it’ll add some much needed viability to those day/night cycle perk cards, which someone pointed out already. All this along with the community driven aspect (also previously mentioned) that this idea would bring and perhaps with better loot drops thrown in, it’d be something very interesting and engaging for all players; also adding more emphasis to elements of survival and stealth (for if you’re not built for open combat and feel like picking some off or being as quiet as possible and sneaking around going about your business with that added tension of feeling screwed if you’re found!😂😂😂)
---
&gt; don't worry about the devs, Bethesda is a billionaire company,
---
That may be true... but if they have an asset which is losing money instead of making money, you bet your sweet ass they'll drop that asset and turn their time, energy, and investment toward something which *is* bringing in the cash.  That's the way business works.
---
No, think of it as an available pool of items to put in the shop.  The kegs for example have been in every game update\ATX Datamine since Summer. A lot of this update was already in Patch 14 but never released like the communist stuff.
---
Not really
---
What about the board game?
---
&gt;You realize cheat engine is just the name on it right? I use it for scanning memory in my professional work as it is the best memory scanning tool I have found.

---
By what? Reporting that lunchboxes had be datamined? Is telling the truth or reporting on something the same as "stoking the hate train" to you or something? I guess all the gaming websites that reported that as well were just stoking the hate hey? Anything other than soft sweet words and flowers said about FO76 is terrible huh? 
---
What a fool 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
You aren’t redownloading the game. You’re just downloading the patch. But the system needs that extra space to make a backup of the game first
---
Michael row the boat ashore

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
That's a shitter like! Why nerf them, it wasn't a big money maker anyways! HaHa.
---
Gotta wonder if anyone at Bethesda played Outer Worlds and decided this content better be amazing or they're up shits creek. The bar is set.
---
Flappy182 on ps4. Add me later and if you're still on I'll get a group to run the queen to help you out
---
Ah, okay, thanks for letting me know!
---
I'm pretty sure their entire bug-fix team consists of one tired, broken man and like, 4 raccoons banging on keyboards while screaming. They code on old Windows 95 laptops in a shack run by a rusty generator in the muffler of the woods. Their work is printed and flown by pigeon to Bethesda HQ for implementation. No testing is ever done. The man and his raccoons may never hear about it again, only the new list of bugs, longer than ever, weighing down the depressed carrier pigeon. He really should've gone into magic acts, he thinks with a sad coo.
---
Rug Glitch?
---
If you nuke it, they will come :P
---
Usually anyway lol, just look around the map and see what player levels are like, if there are a bunch of high levels launch a nuke to start the event
---
thanks for the info. i had alot of dead answers. this is my first useful one.
---
No!  I just had a piece of armor disappear when I unequipped it. I did not drop it. Searched all over just in case
---
They contacted him to set up a phone call. Before he could reply with his number, they banned all his accounts except one low level one. The kicker is that the accounts they banned in this second wave he never used to test or search for exploits. They were clean. But they shared an email address with the previously banned ones. So draw your own conclusions.
---
GOD I cant STAND this GAME bREakiNG MAIN MENU mUSIc. I think I need to make a long winded YOuTUbe video thats approximately 13 minutes LoNG TO express MY GRief at this AWFUL DECISION BETHESDA made. Yooo who cares. Really at the end of the day, the main menu does not really matter. Maybe they should fix things in their game that are actually broken.
---
Same reason anyone in this game pays for anything that is sold in player vendors....they would rather buy it than spend the time getting it for themselves. The difference is some of us actually are trying to help others in the game and not charge outlandish prices doing it. That is the idea behind our "library" idea also. If your not sure what I'm talking about see my other post.
---
I think by leaving the tent and private servers to 1st subs it would still give them that worth it money. Dropping a tent anywhere i pick up 500lbs of scrap seems alright. Doing it on a private server where no one can loot it before me. Seems worth it. Also i think people wouldn't quit nearly as fast and would rebuild our community a bit. Seems like a missed opportunity and that they are banking on wastelanders a bit too much.  But since it had 100 dollars upront sign on bonus id say were locked into it for a year.  Unless they don't mind another backlash.
---
affiliate money is dead money tho
---
Poseidon Energy is nice too. Has 3 of them right by each other out front, and a Grafton monster right next to that. Always worth a stop after they have reset.
---
18 more than the jet pack got
---
I miss the Mayor like I miss Sanjay
---
Id love to log on to just Appalachia Radio tbh. Switch up the songs just like the radio station. Y not. But at the end of the day idc much about the main menu stuff. It's surprising how many people actually cared so much.
---
Wavy Willard's exists I'm p sure
---
Masks don’t register as masks for challenges, knives count as swords for challenges, anglers count as cryotids for challenges, acquiring silo code pieces NEVER works towards challenges, some possum badges won’t update, sometimes bags just don’t want to place, sometimes enemies killed with Plasma too quickly refuse to hold any loot, including legendary enemies, etc etc
---
ya that might be a point.. for u :D  
---
ok at least i would say dont pay more caps as by an robot-vendor.   
---
poorly im on PC -.-  
---
..its time for crossplaying has to come regular on start!  
---
i would give u all my for free, 20 -25 atm, at last they all ends in my Bowl for the guest's and customers\^\^  
---
i craft them obly for fun
---
Hahaha
---
Respect for caps or something maybe. 
---
Character duplication, just no.
---
Why vote THIS down? And to add to your post, or a broken lightbulb in a bathroom in Morgantown high school.
---
"Brand ambassador"
---
Nice ad hominem, it does not hollow out your argument at all when you need to attack the opponent instead of his arguments. Not. At. All.
---
Bye!
---
Nothing if they give me all the junk items I'd need to make it. I'm not playing to amass caps.
---
I'm guessing there are no fucking plans to fix 250.
---
Wastelanders won't be on different servers so a stress test is pointless. I think they recognize this and is why they've pushed back wastelanders launch to 2020
---
But I bet you clicked extra fast to see what's up. 😂
---
Every major bug should be worked on.  The dr one is ridiculous.  The jet pack worked previously then broke after a patch.  Shouldn’t be that hard to do, especially with people on this forum explaining in detail what line of code to change that should fix the issue.
---
Yep at work. Thanks for the info.
---
This game still gets updates? Thought it would be abandoned like anthem was
---
That, and freezing on loading screens.
---
I got 1st and yea it helps but I don’t think it’s a huge advantage. With that said, everyone should have it. The main reason everyone should get it in my opinion is we were told months ago the stash limit can’t be increased too much. Clearly a lie
---
What if I told you of a vast and insidious conspiracy which involved the Responders and their basis in Communism?
---
I clicked real fast cause i was curious what bethesda could add that is erotic. So i guess😂
---
Hello, doppelgänger me!
---
Umm, can we see the other side of the witch and her broom? I'm curious about where that broom enters and exits.
---
I want you to consider they have more representation than The Enclave.
---
I've seen a couple of people also reporting disappearing guy.
---
I got the shielded casual Under Armour plan drop from Queen of the hunt and picked up two dense plans from vendors today.  Ying and yang.
---
Oh the raider gang
---
It does, though until Wastelanders the updates are supposed to be seasonal events and bug fixes only. The main expansion got pushed back to Q1 2020.
---
They may be happy but for how long? Even great games player base slowly drifts away simply due to time. If the initial player base was small as in the case of F76, the disappearing away will be faster, especially since new negative stories about the game keep popping up in the media which does not attract new players. 
---
And no amount of new items/cosmetics/p2w will be enough no matter how much they suck the whales dry if there is no one else playing with the whales.
---
What I'm advocating for is an actual beta instead of the stress test that the B.E.T.A. turned out to be.
---
Yeah. Sounds like they nerfed you? I’ve been seeing the opposite. Larger cap stashes in the bog and Watoga especially.
---
&gt;Brand ambassador
---
I didn't realize that was such a sensitive term for you. I am very secure in my facts. It happened to me. I am really the only person who could possible know if I did or did not do something. I have never seen someone react so violently to being corrected. No wonder you walk around with wrong information floating around in your head if you lash out at anyone who corrects you. Good luck with that.
---
I read somewhere one time something about a mining light being added helps keep the color?!  Really vague memory of that from like month 1 or  2. Don't hold me to it because I'm not even sure that's a thing.  Worth a try of it's  possible.
---
I agree. That would 100% have to be one of the criteria for selecting the new batch of beta testers.
---
Maxed out Thru-Hiker (3\*) reduces all food and drink by 90%
---
You haven't seen the previous debacles of Bethesda's merchandise, have you?
---
Hopefully they give those of us still playing a chance to help them make Wastelanders something worth coming back to.
---
Because active players spend money on atoms and FO1st and players who moved on don't. They do have a vested interest in keeping as large a playerbase as possible.
---
" I didn't realize that was such a sensitive term for you. "
---
Par for the course there buddy. 
---
Also, I am sorry if you felt this was a violent reaction. I sincerely apologize for that.
---
Lol theres no longevity for this pile of garbage. Get out while you can. And for the good of all gamers everywhere DONT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY
---
I would have to dig through months of following this sub to find that. It’s also been play tested. I have friends who have plays tested it along with the other armor effects. We’re not statisticians yo. Either take our word for it or Just get better at using escape artist and use a suppressor.
---
Yeah, I have
---
Still doesn't dismiss the fact these guys are just being assholes to a 3rd-party company with no relations to Bethesda beyond the license.
---
I hope so too
---
That is pretty great! Of the two bugs the blast off is the most fun.
---
Yeah!  Like a scrap box, collectron, private server etc.  You know, pretty much everything you've read bitching about in the past month. 
---
Love, 
---
Beth
---
It's never to late to start getting better. I feel like those of us who are left are more predisposed to optimism than the average person.
---
"Like usual"? Who the hell do you think you are?
---
I don't believe we've gotten a meaningful fix for like a patch or two. 
---
So you're saying that they didn't have the man hours within the past month or two to deal with even a couple of the mid-level bugs on the unofficial bug list, let alone all the ones with the bug fix spelled out in detail, you're to one that hasn't worked on any project/program/portfolio. Certainly not one that's run competently.
---
Given that you clearly have no experience in software development like either myself or the OP has, probably best to leave this discussion to people who do.
---
I hope they'll fix it, but looks like it's not high on their priority list - more important is a window you could've shoot through, similarly important like that flickering bulb in Watoga they've fixed few patches ago. There must be thousands of players asking for that change, hundred of thousand even...
---
That’s always a good day. Which dense Plans?
---
I follow a few of them on XBOX live and even Pete has a few achievements on the outer worlds.
---
Pretty sure that normal players don't really spend money. I guess the hardcore fans might do but not avarage players
---
I'm too low-ranking in the organization to have any knowledge of such an arrangement
---
Yay, also the tent should be free. Game changing features behind a paywall? Your game is still broken, Bethesda!
---
Is your cap collector perk still giving you double the stash amount?
---
What is wastelanders, I've been spending more time on NV than 76
---
&gt;" I didn't realize that was such a sensitive term for you. "  
---
&gt;Par for the course there buddy.
---
So you are saying in general, terms are sensitive for you? I am so confused. I think you are using that phrase wrong.
---
Raider which I needed. I think all I have left to get now is combat but I have a extra metal and robot in trade so I'm sure I'll pick it up soon.
---
The shielded casual was a nice surprise.
---
&gt; THat and I do seem to remember a few threads in here asking for chinese steath outfits, et al.
---
And people have been asking for The Enclave to get more love. But nah, instead of getting more support for a faction IN GAME, they decided to add communist cosmetics. None of which are the chinese stealth suit...
---
It’s very odd. I searched all over just to make sure I didn’t drop but I can’t find it
---
Sell it in your vending machine so that the next person that buys it can post a question on reddit about it.
---
Thanks! I have a BE+Faster Reload currently. Should i trade it for one you mentioned?
---
I smell an IP lawsuit...superfan or not, you can't use something that you don't own the rights to use and profit from.
---
Just to clarify, the Enforcer perk still uses a multiplier, so it's not always an instant 100% cripple.  It's just that the multiplier [**9,999x per pellet**](https://i.imgur.com/3qgLydf.png), which is why it can still take a several hits to cripple the the SBQ's limbs, for example.  
---
The legendary effect only multiplies your limb damage by **1.5**, but it can presumably be just as good if you're doing 6k+ damage per second.
---
Yay. Unlimited for all.
---
Good point. Your right about the damage. The rifles versions do benefit from tank killer though. I know it makes a small difference but the rifle versions also have better stock options. 
---
I have to mention that even though those specific pistols match their rifle counterparts in damage, other rifles out DPS them. The rifles that out DPS them also have cheaper ammo.
---
I think it has to do with how many harvest them.  The two near whitespring station and the one at the tatoo parlor?  Almost always 20.  Off the beaten path ones I’ve hit the 3 digit jackpot a few times in the last few weeks.
---
Nope had mine disappear about a week ago....poof. still pissed as it was my chest piece with WWR and powered.....argh
---
I would imagine they got rights from Bethesda to make these.
---
Mug I think from overseers house.
---
As a 1st sub I say nay.
---
It's one of the perks of subbing, and the stash management prior to it wasn't a game breaker for me - it's just how the game was designed. I'd be behind everyone getting a reduced version of it, but not the unlimited version 1st subs get.
---
That being said, if they made it for everyone and just gave me  a permanent private server instead of a private session I'd be 100% behind that. Heck, they could remove it and give me the server and I'd be happy.
---
j'y suis arrivé!
---
Bored of nuking fissure site prime over and over? Then try this: find a nice clump of camps, then drop a nuke on those bastards. Destroy camps without ever incurring a bounty. I love the smell of burned player camps in the morning.
---
I will concede that the enclave doesnt have an atomic shop presence.  They do however have a very large in game presence.  Xo1 and extra skins, underarmor, officers uniform, scout armor, etc. And all available in game for caps or a few quests.
---
Gotta avoid that cultural appropriation lawsuit
---
Thanks for sharing OP, should be an interesting development.
---
Having native Americans in my family, I would love some nice, if overly generic, Indian stuff in the game. An outfit, headdress, maybe a teepee and a totem pole with optional faces.
---
Don't worry about it.
---
If it is any help for you I did find all the information you posted to be helpful, and enlightening. I will no longer refer to the situation as I did in my first post here. All of it was good info. The only thing that I have been commenting on here, and that has now given me a changed and new picture of you, is how you comment on the very people you talk to.
---
&gt; Where we had evidence of users doing these scams, we have dealt with those accounts. 
---
Mods, how can you gather evidence if we can't name names or post about it here?
---
Is there an official process we can go through to point out these issues? Not just with giveaway scams but with any scams. Also, can you please add that process to the post?
---
My character has a full beard. Unless you're talking ZZ Top.

I know of this problem and follow a no NW policy at the pertinent times. To day I logged in to see the achievs,  all atoms still available,but kill various robots challenge had one or two marked off already, no cost of atoms, but wierd.
---
you didnt know? if you say anything about Bethesda that isnt “fuck bethesda” the bethesda bashers gang will downvote you lol
---
Fallout porn ftw! 😂
---
See that's the thing though, the two by WS station (in front of the mine) never used to be guaranteed 10-20 like they seem to be now. Same with the one on top of the bunker service entrance and the one in the guard shack by the WS bunker main entrance. Those are all guaranteed 10-20 for me now when they used to vary all over the place.
---
Totally. That was a really cool roll out this summer
---
There's several bits of info in game which suggests they were infiltrated by the spies found under Mama Dolce's and it influenced their very social structure
---
Coming to an Atom Shop near you.
---
Except here's the thing, Enclave doesn't get base items like communism does.
---
I mention the same suggestion in every thread I see about this topic. In addition to being able to re-join a raid/not getting kicked out of a raid if we crash, the timers MUST be \*at the very least\* changed to be more forgiving. The timers are such a lazy attempt to make the raid difficult, with the added bonus of highlighting everything that is so unstable with fallout 76 - looking at you LAG. 
---
I've suggested removing the timers all-together before. I assume they don't even consider it since they have run out of ideas on how to make raids more difficult without resorting to time. I wish they would, as I like you want to start collecting those vault raid plans :( Until then I'm extremely interested if they have been compiling stats of who has actually completed the raid. I bet it's much less than 10% of the community - and that's not even including the people who have since moved on to other games because, let's face it, given the amount of content and games coming out these days, the only ones playing should be considered either new players or the 'core player base.'
---
Happens to me on xbox a looooooot I've seen different reports and have had varying success with them. Some say wait a full 20 seconds then try some say a couple minutes. It's really hit or miss. Sometimes I'll wait up to 10 min to try and respawn depending on the event and still no dice
---
All propaganda, lies, lies, lol. I like 76 all broken. Gives me something to laugh at. Down in front. Gimme those peanuts!
---
Lvl3 packrat also!
---
I would normally agree with you I get harpoon guns all the time.  Last night I got a Quad Explosive Harpoon gun.  Curious I added Flechette mod and went west tek. OMG. FUN FUN. Muties Explode with one shot. The one time I actually liked a harpoon gun.
---
they fixed something i had asked about so, yeah i will be genuinely affected after log in.
---
and much happier than i was before the patch.
---
Dang, that hurts.
---
Maybe they fixed it in the update today? Lol prob not tho. Sucks one my characters only had a good FE handmade but it’s has that role so it technically sucks too
---
😂
---
Yup and about impossible to replace....argh
---
*I've heard of another giveaway that's in trouble. I'll mark it on your map.*
---
That explains why the condition drops so goddamned fast, im reloading shells with ball bearings.
---
I saw this last night. There were two nuked spots with both having the double wide rings. I stayed away simply because it was either a big or exploit; who knows anymore. Went ahead and tried NW first time ever since I hate BRs. But I actually enjoy it. Up to rank 11 with zero player kills although I’m slowly starting to at least damage someone before they kill me. So just a matter of time until I get that first player kill.
---
the same for bottle cap glasses, u can find somtes a red bottle cap one.  
---
But if u pick it up, looses the color too ;/
---
Release notes say it’s the same voice as Liberty Prime.
---
Junkies goes up to 50% increase. People use it as an alternative to bloody, because the vault raids are rlly punishing to bloodied builds. A junkies build is used as a substitute to what would be two shot, since it has been nerfed to the ground, and u need to have high hp to survive.
---
&gt; There weren't a lot of Ceasar's Legions members running around Appalachia either, but they have that as well in the datamined images.
---
Oh right, I need to correct this now that I looked closer at the outfit. It's not Caesar's Legion, it's an actual Roman Legion outfit with a fanciful hat. You can tell it's not Caesar's Legion cause of the lack of sports gear to construct the outfit.
---
This guy gets it.
---
The queen can be killed by three relatively low leveled (60's) characters in power armor if one of them concentrates on the other scorchbeasts that spawn so that the other two can magdump in to her.  Even more convenient is having a fourth person to kill the random mobs that spawn rather than everyone dealing with the deathclaws, gulpers, and radscorpions as they come.
---
Awesome I’m buying it then !
---
Of course I do. But you aren’t a freelancer, nor are you a Bethesda employee. You’re just another user like the rest of us. Just because you develop community tools doesn’t give you special privileges to do as you wish without consequence. Regardless of intent, it’s against the tos to use tools like Cheat Engine. 
---
By the way, I’m not a brand ambassador. If anything I criticise Bethesda more than I praise them.
---
This, so much this.
---
The events suck... The good ones like Awol Armament, One Violent Night, Uranium  and Campfire rarely show up. Double xp weekend and we all get stuck grinding Tea Time and Swarm of Suiters.
---
Oh ok, Thanks :) 👍🏼
---
Want a fss for this reason, in may suck but would look sooo cool with the samurai outfit.
---
No, you wont get any damage increase from changing it out. 
---
If you are already  using a BE, then you are fine.
---
The sought after minor effects are Faster Reload, and 50DR for heavies, because Vats is useless for fast firing heavies.
---
Thanks for trying to help I guess 👍
---
Riot gear too?
---
My similar experience (explained below) was on PC.    
---
Sadly, this was final frustration for me, and I've uninstalled the game, so I won't be able to give you any more information or report if the issue has been fixed.  But best of luck finding and fixing it for others.
---
Which platform
---
Been trying to, can't even load up the main menu. Got through about 10 tries before I gave up.
---
I read this is the same as the 7month old merchoid watch
---
Its a very viable alternative, though you wont do near the damage as a bloodied build will do. 
---
Since you will be running full health with the  junkies build, you wont get the bonuses from Adrenal Reaction, Emergency Protocols or Nerd Rage.
---
Bloodied is still top man for raw damage, but Junkies builds live longer.
---
Xbox
---
Hooray! They acknowledge the issue! Now we just have to wait another 90 days for a fix.
---
I had an Assassins one but I’m on PC
---
You can fit the commie stuff in, perhaps not as brazenly as the atom shop shows.
---
There are terminal entries and some scout exam questions that push the notion of organized labor as a commie angle, and you see in the ash heap that there were plenty of angry workers.  I can see people having their hidden bunker as a commie meeting spot simply as an opposition to automation.  Heck one of the signs is along the lines of “I ain’t a commie but I see where they’re coming from”
---
That said I think post war that mindset is largely dead, unless we’re going to set up the commie as an opposition to the Enclave.
---
You mean camp items?  Yeah, soon hopefully.  We are due for an enclave and brotherhood release.  Still doesnt mean the commie stuff isnt appropriate to 76 or to fallout in general.
---
Good luck finding your proof. You could probably figure out how to properly utilize stealth by the time you find any.
---
Bloodied is awesome but overkill for most enemies. You can still one-shot lv68 Super Mutants to the head with a JE Railway or Lever without sneaking or crit. You pretty much instantly kill a Behemoth with a JE or JFFR Junkies Railway.
---
I don't and probably never will play a stealth build.
---
Yeah that’s what i was thinking, Thanks :)
---
I think it's a great idea for a beta test..... I don't really think it decides the fate of the game. I also don't think it should be content creators who are more like content creator haters these days. There should be an interview process with specific criteria including things like PC specs and broadband speeds.
---
you can exit the event from your pip-boy and pvp normally, thats what they are doing
---
Wouldn't be surprised.
---
FYI Green thumb doesn't work for Fern or Soot Flowers, at least as far as the challenge is concerned.
---
Just change your appearance or something, this idea really doesn’t make sense
---
apparently the charging brick &amp; cord they send with it dies in a couple days so use a different charger &amp; cable.
---
What was the slogan of FO76? Rebuild America? Well, have some communist flags for your camp!
---
Interesting, I think i will stay with Bloodied. But being able to one shot a Behemoth is crazy, in fact, how? My Bloodied Handmade rifle is at a maximum of 314 Damage, and can’t get it higher. Thanks man :)
---
Oh boo hoo... smh
---
I personally really liked the Cuttthroat crag Icon mostly for the fact I just like everything about the raider faction in this game and mixing that with a ski theme is amazing, but I completely agree that free icons shouldn't be the only thing being offered for free, like it's about time people get a free wallpaper to try out the new mechanic.
---
That’s my personal theory.  Someone hits it and it resets to normal, and will disappear if the cell resets.  A bobble head and the mappalachia caps spawn and you can make some serious caps, even now, so wouldnt surprise me if new players are going this route to make caps beyond the vendor limit.  I’ve been meaning to test this theory on a private server after I’ve been on it a few hours in a small area, to give cells time to reset.
---
I'm still waiting for the Helmeted Cage armor that was datamined months ago. Beth pls
---
You forgot the part where they deny all of the improvements that Bethesda has made over the game, and Im not talking about not talking about it, but saying "WeLL i know they PATCHED THIS but i DONT CARE because BETHESDA BAD".
---
I just recently started the junkie as I've aquired some top tier weapons. I've addicted myself to 3 chems and I am doing some better damage. What sucks is my special is all negative and my vats misses shots more often.
---
I'm calling it. Yhe majority of people who still play will not stop if it's a buggy mess.
---
Bethesda wants there to be garbage rolls and levels of gear and not have everything on par why? This game is a giant slot machine for legendaries people wouldn’t spend hours grinding or trading if all legendaries were good. Explain why you think buffing assassins weapons would change the meta? Even if you buff it to do the same damage as another good type all the perks are either terrible or good with a downside : bloodied glass cannon, junkie more tanky  raw damage with withdrawls, aa good middle ground but less effective the than raw damage depending on armour levels
---
That would have been a cool feature for survival mode. Survival mode could have been great if it was a true endgame experience
---
I like tortoises.
---
&gt; You can fit the commie stuff in
---
Equipment? Sure you can fit that in. A communist flag for the player's camp, or a communist themed pip-boy? FUCK NO!
---
Excellent idea, and could be expanded upon greatly!
---
That’s awesome, what weapons did you find/have? I’m just curious to know about the damage that people are doing, but that sucks about your special stats :( Thanks dude.
---
It would be nice if those returning to the game could **get** the original. 
---
But hey, it's something.
---
Is the trade glitch or the broken ass horde events or the fact I can't hear any sound through my tv with my min unplugged fixes ha?
---
Someone doing a giveaway should be ok.  Someone asking for a handout or begging should be removed.  It should only go one way.  Anyone that gives something away to someone else:  do it with the understanding that they can and will do whatever they want with it, not what you want them to do with it.  If you aren't prepared to accept this, then stop giving things away.  If you give it away, it's gone and don't think about it again.
---
Haven't gotten Nia in a week or so, maybe 5 or 6 runs. Do this event religiously with multiple toons, and I am on a strange rng trip also. Never had this many of either ending in a row. I can't say I miss the screaming, but it is the perfect time to do the man down emote, lol.
---
“Tedious” geez is everyone so impatient now they can’t spend 15 sec or less picking a lock? You’re practically better off not picking them at all anyway
---
the high price keeps them from becoming "too common".
---
Reading isn't a strong suit of yours, I see. There's no way to have a conversation with you if you keep arguing as if things I've already addressed haven't been addressed.
---
Nuking the space station should spawn an alien ship that teleports alien foot soldiers to the ground.
---
Then, when the ship is defeated and crashed, a giant robotic spider tank should emerge from the wreckage as the final boss.
---
Bring on the Zetans!
---
I've got a FFR +1 handmade and a FFR FR sub. They do good but it's not much more than my other handmades. I still wanna play with it a bit more and maybe get two more addictions before I totally rule it out. I have alot of weapons I like to play with so I dunno about changing my entire build for two junkies weapons.
---
Just happened to me within 30 min of playing lol
---
Rofl
---
Just to clarify, this bug can occur without having played Nuclear Winter. I've spoken to others about this, and have personally experienced it twice -- in both cases, I had been offline during the reset, and had not touched NW for weeks.
---
You are not understanding here.  It's not just the rules of /r/fo76
---
It's sitewide rules for all of reddit.  ALL of reddit.  So you can petition the admins to change it but the mods here can't do anything about it.
---
You’re really just a self entitled prick. You go around and engage in PvP not because you’re a good person but because you like it. You just don’t want to be a troll like everyone else. You still force unwilling participants into it. Say whatever you want. I’m quite content knowing you’re a dick
---
can you look into fixing our social menu on pc?  a bunch of us can't add friends and haven't been able to since December. thank you
---
Yeah, honestly I was just jesting. I mean I like my bottle and cappy icons just because I enjoy everything Nuka Cola, but yeah icons don't really tickle my fancy in general.
---
Oh ok, they’re good weapons, but it seems Junkies is good for additional damage and there is no important sacrifice made such as being on 15% health. It’s up too you if you want to change build of course, but you can always swap back if it doesn’t work, :)
---
the wallpaper is free
---
This is your contribution to the discussion?
---
Lol yeah I know what you're getting at but honestly if I had to chose between the tenants of socialism and MODUS and I would pick socialism every time.  Some of the guys that came before you sided with MODUS and look where that got them.
---
Is anyone still playing this broken game?
---
My bloody guy is my level 350 mule. I have a full vanguard guy I enjoy playing with more. He's accumulated some good stuff. I just tried the junkies on him to see what the hype was about, just not entirely impressed. I have a prime handmade that almost equates to my junkies and I wouldn't have to sacrifice special or stockpile chems.
---
I really hope that they release that ranger helmet with a black army hat, as shown on the 3-rangers preview image.
---
You still post here? Feel brave enough to comment about the lack of comms in the regular ITV issues?
---
I can't, they are a part of me now.
---
As much as i hate the constant Bethesda bashing, that's nothing short of brilliant!
---
thanks gears! and sage :)
---
Its basically abandoned cuz the patches usually don't adress major issues
---
Underrated comment \^
---
That’s awesome, a level 350 mule? I bet that’s a good combination too; Junkies and Vanguards as you are at full health. It seems like a solid build especially as you are always at full health and buffed on multiple Chems.
---
Anyone notice that typewriter and mascot in that one pic?! The rest of the items are all items you can actually build in your camp (or can buy in the atom shop (in the future)).
---
He can carry more stuff being bloody lol. So he's just a pack mule now. I do like the vanguard armor though. It's so much fun, yeah I do use more bullets but it's so much more fun.
---
McCarthyism, bruh.
---
ohhh that makes sense. i was wondering about the typewriter and mascot for the longest. makes sense if its a display case tho
---
Dear Mods: This is the type of user that needs to be banned.
---
Those users are removed and we have some ways at our disposal of auto removing repeat offenders. If you have an issue, simply message the moderators. 
---
You cannot name names. That is witch hunting, and can get a community banned by the Admins. It is a site wide rule. 
---
We don't deal with any type of in game "scamming" like people doing bad trades, that you have to take up with Bethesda.
---
I actually hate that a lot of events were made 'public events' they seem like they've been dumbed down and made ridiculously easy, like I said in the post, Tea Time practically spawns nothing and I TOOOTALLY love sitting around doing nothing for 5 minutes. Plus before it, all the good events would be almost hourly, loved going from Meat Week to UF then Camp Tales, there was actually things to do, now you're lucky to see certain events once a day.
---
Like I've said before, I love the game but it gets extremely boring and checking peoples camps/vendors gets old quick
---
Remember this when Starfield comes out. I for one am done with Beth and any future games they put out. Nope, no thank you.
---
I mean in a perfect world, of course. Still, all the QA in the world won't pull that game apart the way someone with thousands of hours in it would.
---
Why ?
---
Me too.  It took me a while to get this game, I recently got it about two months ago and I really enjoy a lot about it.  I was surprised how toxic some players are as I wouldve thought better of the community.
---
I am not really big into online games but it is nice meeting other players and making friends when possible.  Though this entire dramatic fo 1st bulling issue is just sad to me that others have to behave so irrationally towards anyone else that may support or have a 1st subscription.
---
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully Wastelanders comes with enough reason to give 76 a second look for people in your position.
---
sure, but I wont use it just yet, gotta give it a few patches
---
i found a nice easy work around..it involved uninstalling the game and going to play something else.  Yes I know there are some die hard fans, but when is enough going to be enough? the Dev's have just about done everything, lied, cheated and stole.  Me I am die hard fan, ive played every Fallout game there is, and still flogging the dead horse that fallout 4 is because i love the game, and its mods.  I've stuck with fallout 76 for all the pain and suffering, but for me what set me off is when they demanded 13/mo for a "private" server that was as private as a public restroom, and probably just as filthy.  As much it pains me to say it, I think as a community, we should effectively just take it off life support and let it die in Bethesdas arms..
---
Yep I couldn't agree more. For the first time in a year I haven't played in a few days. Not even to collect my caps or scrip. Prior to that I would just log in and get my scrip. Maybe tool around for an hour and log out.
---
Also #burneraccount 
---
Love how reddit doesnt require email verification
---
Other studios manage.
---
They fixed floating bushes stop complaining how much more could you need
---
Another comment section where... again people try to make it about themselves, he said they need to fix the servers and timers, you retards ☠☠☠
---
I know this isn’t on topic, but I’ve been away for a while and just recently downloaded the game again and saw the update. I was wondering if Bethesda ever gave a reason as to why they removed allowing us to have weapons on our backs? Was kinda hoping I’d see it in the patch notes... wishful thinking I know.
---
And how do ANY of the sales subs operate then?
---
People don't ESP mailing addresses
---
I dont care about these fixes either, but the forum has been flooded with requests to change the main menu theme.  There was a week or 2 where you could see 3 of these requests in the top 10 posts in here.
---
I wish they would only focus on the request that impacts gameplay too, but that doesnt seem to be the only thing that people want fixed.
---
A soft reboot/expansion. It will add a new "main story" and NPCs/Factions.
---
Sorry to hear that, hope you have a better time in your next game, bye🤗 
---
P.s. If you find any "real MMO" please let the rest of us know👍

I don't take it as dishonest, so much as an inside joke about how rare they were in FO4.
---
are you at 9 ranks of commando/rifleman (auto/singleshot), with Tank Killer?
---
Make sure you have bloody mess up.
---
Make sure you equip Mr Sandman before Covert Ops (it makes your sneak damage 3.75x) for the full bonus.   If you slot Covert first, then your bonus is only 3.5x.
---
Have a healthy stash of psychotats and ballistic bock.
---
Are you using Adrenal Reaction?
---
Tbh the project leads are probably not to blame either.
---
Higher ups are probably pushing them with unreasonable deadlines and limited to no dedicated resources, leading to little to no testing and the result is what we see.
---
So the project leads are desperately trying to meet these completely idiotic expectations and the poor programmers and developers underneath are probably on multiple projects with no direction on what is a priority from management.
---
Stress all the way down from people at the executive level with no clue or care about reality.
---
...at least that’s my experience in the industry.
---
The game getting better could potentially bring in more hardcore players. Best case scenario Wastelanders almost acts as a soft reboot and the game can start growing from a better place leaving the first year in the rearview mirror.
---
I wasnt impressed with Junkies either.  Tried it for a day with a Junkies FFR FR minigun. 
---
Went back to bloodied.
---
Should be a basic feature, i tried 1st for this first month its extremly pay to win
---
The way that Xbox is set up, you can't just open up a dialogue with any stranger. Microsoft changed it so that it's hard to see messages from someone who isn't on your friends list. If I can get the newbie to message me, THEN we can communicate. I've tried simply messaging people. Because of the aforementioned changes to messaging, that almost never works. Being friendly almost never works. Even if I drop a bag full of goodies, it's almost impossible to get the other guy to pay attention. What almost always works is attacking. That gets a person's attention. 
---
If I'm in a server where I see known griefers who WILL rob a newbie blind, wreck their camp, and do whatever else they can to ruin someone's day, I have two options. I can either attack to get the newbie's attention and open up a conversation, or I can allow the newbie to get griefed on a truly ungodly level.
---
Your absolutely right and I’m a die hard fan, I even fell for the Fallout 1st debacle. But I honestly haven’t been heart broken by the online game issues that plague others, or see a problem with the money hunger that Bethesda’s stock holders and board of directors abuse. Idk maybe that’s the capitalist in me that is ok with it. But I haven’t seen a game that caught my eyes to make me ditch 76 or fallout at all. Outer worlds isn’t as cool as people freak out about, like yea cool it’s RPG but but as good at Star Wars KOTOR was, of New Vegas was in my opinion. And the new Star Wars game just doesn’t seem like much to me. Maybe I’m 100% blind and am a dumb fanboy but in the end I’m ok with it, I have plenty of friends that still play I just hate the people who do play that want to ABUSE and break the game because they have nothing else better to do that harass a guy who comes home from a 8-12 hour shift and just wants to unwind with his buddies in a wasteland. But I agree it has been an uphill battle with what has happened lately and I don’t disagree with people who have left or moved on. I’m not that stupid about what’s going on, I’m just neutral about it all
---
I’m on pc so there’s your first mistake
---
I don't want an mmo. Which is why I bought fallout 76 instead of eso. Next game? I haven't played this game in months, I was just hopeful they would improve it not make it worse. I was looking for a reason to come back lol!
---
he cant have his stuff cause OP dont play lmao
---
Other studios have had beta test also. Some have both.
---
So what game are you planning on playing instead?
---
so which youtuber did you copypaste this of off?
---
rules 4, 5, and 9 (3 also, really)
---
Hi yes i’m rank 9 with Rifleman and 3 on tank killer, i also use sneak too so i have the perk which increases sneak and the damage multiplier. I do need to get the bloody mess perk and rank that to the max, and yes i have adrenal reaction too. I haven’t got Covert/Mr. Sandman, so perhaps i should get those. Maybe using Chems more often would be wise too. 
---
Thanks man :)
---
Awesome man :)
---
Buy (their subscription and micro transactions). lol.
---
They make SoMuch money this is an amazing idea. Just select about 2 to 3 thousand players (not even sure if that many people play this buggy fuck show) and let them try wastelanders early and help link out the major bugs,exploits, dupes and what not. 
---
Please for the love of God don't  fuck this up bethesda...
---
It’s so fucked but the builders and campers and grinders are probably in hig heaven. 
---
I just want some of my legendary weapons to work as advertised.
---
It makes a lot of sense
---
Lol, where would I put it? All five toons so close to Max most of time, not a junk hoarder but I love my arsenal!
---
For real?
---
I sell all plans for 20-50 caps.
---
Of course it should be, otherwise it's P2Win, which Bethesda said would never happen.  But they fucking lied.
---
"I've said multiple times they dodge shots as soon as you shoot the first shot."
---
Aren't they supposed to do that?
---
Not a meme
---
Is civil
---
Isnt spam
---
I'm not gonna explain what those rules mean to a simply.
---
Mines been OK...
---
I did rebuild database yesterday though so who knows...
---
Yeah, real civil.
---
I sell mine for 6969 caps because I am still twelve years old. But yes, they're not rare at all in this game, and I would be very concerned if anyone ever actually bought one.
---
First of all I don't raid your vending machine to get plans. We get them by doing quests or buying them ourselves from computer vendors. If I see that you have plansr/receipes for sale , I send you a message and see if you want to donate to the library. If you say no then they are left there for someone else to get. I make sure to note on our lists who has donated what. If I could find someone who would be responsible enough to follow our way of doing things then I'd be glad to give them the responsibility. But first time we done that, the person took them and then later we found them for sale in his camp.

Ya man YouTube it there should be a video somewhere with the exact location

Don't let the unsubscribe button hit you on the way out of the sub!

Yeah I agree with this, a while back I made some lvl 25 excavator armor for a lv 25 new player with calibrated shocks the whole shebang. I was sadly disconnected from the server and couldn't find him so all I did was jumped on here and asked a question about final fantasy 7 that not many people know the real answer (with some googling though would have been easy to find out. And whoever the first to get it right would get the PA free
---
You being on PC isn't my mistake. If you were unaware that different platforms might not work the same way as yours, that's an assumption on your part. If you assumed that every player pays attention to every message they receive on a game like Fallout 76, that's also a bad assumption on your part.
---
My mic may not automatically be muted, but that doesn't mean everyone can hear me. Unlike what Todd Howard said, Fallout 76 doesn't always "just work."
---
I don't think it's oversight but more to not stress their already super stressed servers or wanting to speed up the development a bit to fast. I would love to see the logic gates from the fo4 dlc but I'm afraid that would actually kill the servers. But yeah a lot of stuff is missing.
---
I play all different types of games, but mostly whatever the rest of my friends play.

 I just pre ordered halo mcc for pc.

"This game I don't own or play makes me **so** angry that I'm going to go to the subreddit for people who play it and bash it."

My attempt at a synopsis.
---
Look I don’t care. I’m not going to keep reading this because at this point I’m over it. Move on. Stop replying. Stop trying to convince me or the two other redditors that will see this that you’re a good guy. Just accept we’ll never meet in a game so this whole thing has literally no impact on either of our lives and move on
---
I didn't haha

They're not separate entities.

5 GIGS for these measly notes? I assume there’s a bunch of stuff added in for future content.. 
---
The data miners will have a field day.
---
What was that? There aren’t any data miners left you say? They all got banned you say? Oh
---
You asked why it's annoying. Duh, you dodge. It's way harder to shoot someone jumping with frogger than regular jumping. You can't deny that. And it's unfair, annoying, and not fun.
---
It'll be back, they can always use more $
---
For now enjoy your version someone rolled in charcoal/exploded a can of primer paint on
---

---
Why is this still not fixed?   The Devs fixed the lighting color issue on the Martian Vault Girl antenna, but not this?
---
Whoever is prioritizing the backlog needs a kick in the rear.
---
Lol. Bethesda was my favorite game developers for many years. I won't unsubscribe in hope they will do the right thing eventually lol.
---
Amen to that. Yeah i robbed a bank, but only to test the police response.
---
Yeah i did the glitch, but simply to tell it to bethesda, saying while havin 10 BE handmade
---
I guess my thought on it was that if one prefix was better than all the others, but only for pvp use, that it would sort of level all the weapons out so they were dependent on their basic balance... but on second thought that's not really going to work either.
---
TBH I would rather that legendary effects are scrubbed on any pvp use. As in, no matter what kind of effects your weapon has it acts as a base weapon (and everything acts as it's a level 1 or 5) when it's damaging another player. That way for pvp it's more fun because you can see what the other person is using and expect how it will effect you, and you're not just buckled over by the first burst from some guy with a got roll weapon that's practically unobtainable for 95% of players. Then there's also no need for damage caps so slow ROF weapons aren't totally screwed.
---
Armor should also use it's base stats for pvp and not use any legendary modifiers. That way you don't end up with people shooting at each other like they're using water pistols because of ridiculous attributes like sentinel and cavalier.
---
Then again I come from a time when when pvp games let you choose between 4 weapons that were all nearly the same and the winner was decided by skill.
---
I know they want people to grind for gear in the game, but most people aren't grinding for pvp gear they're grinding for pve so it probably wouldn't make much difference in how many people stick around to grind for stuff.
---
Hell if they fixed pvp so it was actually balanced I would actually play the pvp content a lot more and I bet so would a lot of other people that swore it off after they saw how badly balanced survival mode was.
---
i haven’t tried it on this one, but i know what you mean lol
---
Crane caught pie is life!! Down with you spawn pie eaters
---
No its 30k
---
Bye good riddance
---
Iv played enough to know I'm not paying more money for more scrap space after they said it was a server stability issue.
---
The end of the world already happened, getting people to invest in gold and silver is too little, little too late
---
And to let you know what happened, I personally bought our plans back costing me 3k in caps. Two days later, traded them to two players for free to learn and eventually give back to the library so they could be given to other players.
---
I talk depends on how they do it in the code.
---
For what we know, which is nothing in terms of the source code, it could be ridiculously complex and take a tonne of digging through the code backwards through objects and instances and methods to find out how it’s meant to work, let alone why it’s not.
---
Based on how these bugs don’t get addressed I have the feeling that commenting and documentation has not been a strong point and that the original programmers are long gone.
---
It’s much harder to look at someone else’s code and figure out how it works and what is wrong, then it is to do the same for your own.
---
You’re basing your assumption it’s an easy fix on how you’d implement it in a simple object oriented language.
---
Rust charges money for private servers
---
I mean I stopped playing for a few months and still voiced my opinion. Hell I’ve never played some games and occasionally voice my opinion on their dedicated subs. I get it doesn’t make sense to you, but people can have opinions about things they don’t or haven’t experienced, let alone have a negative report of said experience to the community dedicated to said subject
---
Thx for the info
---
I agree with Dr. Skittlefarts.
---
So what do you want people to do when you shoot at them? Stand still? Your enemy isn't supposed to make it easy for you!
---
And yes, I CAN and HAVE denied that Frog Legs makes it harder to shoot someone. I didn't share those screenshots earlier for nothing. When someone uses Frog Legs, they've trapped themselves in a predictable arc. They have 0 option to dodge once they've jumped. You saw in my screenshots that I had my shot lined up before my target landed.
---
So you think it's okay to make your $60 game worse and then sell the fix?
---
&gt;Loot Bags: Players that own the Jack-O’-Lantern Loot Bag can now correctly equip it as their Drop or Death Loot Bag in the Atomic Shop.
---
Just in time for Halloween... The one in Appalachia though, where the date is still 23/10.
---
And that is your choice. We give them away free.
---
Does that mean you’re a fanboy?
---
Aww shit, I’ve been spotted
---
By this logic, there's nothing too egregious for them to monetise as long as it keeps the game alive. Even if it breaks the game for people who may have already paid full price at launch
---
Believe I have mine as 1776 or 2076 I dont expect to sell them it's a joke.
---
Check the VTU simulation vault in Morgantown, I found some cool stuff there.
---
I know for a fact what kills me isn't energy damage. The strongest PvE attacks aren't energy based and in PvP while energy damage is strong, it's also not what kills me. I know the risks I'm taking using straight metal and ballistic resistance but I still feel like I die way too fast for having an absurdly high resistance.
---
He didn’t report the exploit and went to bed.
---
He was banned come the morning and claims a mate had reported it that morning.
---
He abused the exploit, didn’t report it, and then threw a hissy fit when he got banned for breaking the rules.
---
There is no proof he had any intention of reporting it, at least not until he’d had his fun and moved stuff to other characters.
---
Sure he has apparently found and reported exploits before, but, in this case, it just flat out looks like he was abusing it for his gain before he’d report it.
---
All that said, a permanent ban is overly harsh.
---
An official warning and a set process for how to report exploits in the future would have been better.
---
Not use frogs legs. it's objectively harder to fight against. Face it, this isn't some shooter. It Fo76 and it's aiming is janky. If you're up close and they jump away, it's harder to shoot. While they can shoot you. As someone else mentioned on the post there are many frog legs spammers/abuser. It doesn't belong for what must be the 12th time. All you've down is support it's a crux. The game would be better without it. 
---
You are simply wrong about it being easier. It is objectively harder and annoying to fight against them. It ruins the mode. Don't know why you you're so defensive when it's true. 
---
Hilarious you mentioned it being competitive. Because that's all the more reason to remove it.
---
Only a couple.
---
Double? It doesn’t say anything about double on any of the levels. 
---
It’s have a chance to find more
---
Have a better chance to find more
---
Always find more. 
---
But it never says anything about double.
---
They're not going to reverse course because of some rando pouting on reddit lmao
---
Test servers is what they should have released instead of 1st, and then released the premium membership together with Wastelanders as it was obviously the plan.
---
But no, gotta make those sweet sweet money quickly somehow. Why pursuing long term goals when you can make less money but right now?
---
I hope not.
---
Just add it to fallout 1st ;)
---
Haha found the westek
---
Wow... So much easier than those RNG machines
---
Thank you!!!
---
It used to always give right around double the stash amount. I used to loot stashes constantly. I've looted thousands of them. I know what I'm talking about. It doesn't specifically say it but that's how it always worked.
---
Maybe this should be another new Vault? But then again, I feel Vaults would be overdone.
---
Just cause I don't frequent this reddit doesn't mean I don't own it lol.
---
I really enjoyed this game when I didn't have to pay 100$ a year for scrap space.
---
Awesome, will do! thank you.
---
It really doesnt matter.
---
You will still get those hate videos because hating on the game is popular and makes money.  Bethesda also wont fix three quarters of the bugs because they have never really given a shit about fixing bug in any of their games.
---
Glowing is basically bloodied tho.
---
I know a guy who makes tons and tons of nukashine on Xbox I might be able to plug u in
---
In all fairness, I can now wear my hat with my sunglasses.
---
It Will be a good idea to make this, maybe just Let the ones who pre ordered f76(the ones who played the original beta of the game) to do this one too.
---
I mean, you wouldn't get drivers lining up volunteering to be crash test dummies.
---
I don't think you know what "objectively" means. Let's look at this objectively. Let's say you're fighting me, and I don't have Frog Legs. You chase me to a cliff. I could go left, right, stop, or turn around. You can't predict what I'm going to do. Now let's take that same fight, but instead I have Frog Legs and I jump to the left. Now I'm stuck. Because gravity exists, you know that I will reach a peak in my trajectory, and then I will fall in a predictable fashion. Through the entire jump, I will continue to move left at a constant, predictable speed. Objectively, unless you have horrible aim, you should be able to kill me. I've doomed myself. I've given you the perfect bullseye. You don't have to guess. You win.
---
Thanks, think ill give it a go
---
You sure about the claim a ballistic rifle has more DPS than a plasma pistol? The automatic handmade is less than 45 damage at 7.5 rounds per second. The plasma is like 48 combined ballistic/energy at around 9 rounds per second, right? More damage and more rounds per second should mean better DPS for the plasma.
---
Wastelanders is def the make or break point for this game.
---
At least you recognize the apples:oranges thing here, good on you for that.
---
Shadows killed me, turning them down helped a lot.  I'd assume you checked those as well though.
---
There's a thread here from a while back that I used to try to optimize things a bit when I started, I'd check over that and see if there's anything in there that can help:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wrx8g/how_to_turn_off_depth_of_field_distant_textures/
---
The title.
---
It had meaning.
---
The “fixes” not so much.
---
Also boo at making my armour take damage again.
---
Now I have to get perks on my new character to repair to 200%.
---
Oh cmon people don't down vote this. That's just the pinnacle of bug work around and fixes right there, fucking gold Bethesda
---
not one rando.I'm forsure not the only person that has a problem with it and hopefully not the only one walking away.
---
Ah nice, thank you! I saw some similar threads but not one as comprehensive as that one. I'll give it a try. :)
---
Just launch fallout 76 using steam and there isn't really any difference. Unless you really want steam achievements for whatever reason.
---
In nVidia control panel, make sure the game is using your dedicated GPU.
---
Well this is just an asinine response.   
---
They didn't 'stir the pot' until Bethesda stabbed him in the back.  
---
The logic, if you actually cared to use any, is this person was exclusively a boon to the community. He was literally doing Bethesda's job for them, at his own personal expense.   
---
Did he technically break the rules?  
---
Sure.   
---
But it was literally for the best reason you could do so, and literal, actual representatives of Bethesda supported (and I assume still support)  his endeavors.   
---
It boggles my mind that there are still people out there trying to paint Bethesda in a positive light. They are an awful, greedy company so out of touch with their own consumers, that they will fight the community trying to help them.  
---
And that's all this is; Helpful.  
---
Let's say for a moment that this dude actually benefited from the exploits in some tangible way;  
---
So the fuck what?  
---
He is actively making the game better for a massive portion of the fanbase. He is exposing flaws that hurt everyone's experience.   
---
So here I am, confused by your logic. Which seems to be 'You technically broke the rules, so even though you didn't hurt anyone and made a lot of people happy, at no expense and pure gain to anyone else, you deserve to be severely\*  punished'. Which is exclusively stupid.   
---
\*Severely, in a proportional sense. Being permanently banned is about one of the 'worst' things Bethesda could have done to him.   
---
Stop shilling for a shitty company. Maybe then you'll find you want to play their games more and spend less time arguing with people who want to play their games more but can't, cuz it's such a shitty product.
---
There ya go. I have one of mine at 9999. 😃
---
Your not, the other 6 people just went to youtube.
---
The last 2 updates I get an error and says my ps4 doesnt have enough space. I have like 80 gigs of free space. What is going on???
---
Modders did it week 1
---
Agreed, the ranger change is awful!
---
Made with real plastic
---
With such a big name as bethesda I would say it is a definitely a toss up if going on steam would have been worth it. They would have lost 30% of all sales, that is far from insignificant. Add on the refund policy as you have mentioned and it seems a no brainer to avoid steam at all costs at release, a lot of people bought the game at full price that surely would have refunded immediately.
---
Lol yep. Such a stupid thing to "fix".
---
So many game breaking bugs, but hey. Color is important. I guess.
---
From the last dataminer AMA: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/f3n9vy8?
---
Yes there is 😂
---
In game says new voices. I guess we need to wait a youtube volounteer.
---
The hybrid chems are your best bet here. I always just craft Grape Mentats and Psychobuff and that counts as 5 chems.
---
No you are thinking of bufftats or a different game. Lol.
---
I posted about the same thing a couple of days ago. Go in your pip boy and look under the DAILY section. You should see Repeatable: Operation Tidy
---
Select it if it isnt selected, or de-select it and re-select it. It may take 24 hours for it to reset so you can do it. It did for me.
---
We weren't all jackasses :(
---
For any Fallout 1st Subscribers, what convinced you to spend your money OTHER than the Scrapbox?
---
There are some exceptions though, such as the golden combat knife. It has a completely different mesh and texture, but it can still be applied to already existing combat knives.
---
Try to unlock all of the radium mods.  That keep you busy for a few months. LOL
---
The only scammers one should be aware of is bethesda employees like you.
---
Would you have subscribed if not for the scrap box? If so, which other Fallout 1st aspect was worth the $13/month or $100 for you?
---
Ps4 does that crap, I always leave 150+ gbs open.  It happens with multiple games.
---
1: Unplug your PS4.
---
2: Remove it from your entertainment center.
---
3: Open window.
---
4: Toss PS4 out the window.
---
5: Go buy an Xbox.
---
&gt; I'm a 1st subscriber 
---
just how do you live without a spine ?
---
I'm pretty sure they just fixed this in the patch today, no?
---
Trippy
---
Thanks. Yea. Had Bolstering,  power and WWR. My prime piece....
---
i obtained the strangler heart PA and vault 94 was still miserable
---
ill rather do mythic kiljaeden again
---
I was really upset about the main menu until they finally added a separate volume control. Trying to talk to my team between NW matches while that music fought to overpower their voices was just ridiculous.
---
Yeah.
---
I’m running a pistol right now and being bloodied is a neccessity I find.  
---
I have a bloodied six shooter and every bullet needs to kill when it comes to mobs (particularly ghouls and super mutants), otherwise I’m pretty much certified dead.  (Though with ghouls I can jump using marsupial and reload...super mutants warlords, overlords and the type...not so much).
---
I love the build and the gameplay tbh (VATS is a must in close quarters) but the pistols need to be stronger to make up for the lower fire rate...and also the stronger pistols need the option of suppressors like the lever action rifle.
---
The "Break it Early Test Application" before launch obviously didn't really help much with bugs, etc.  A Beta for Wastelanders likely wouldn't do much either, except for revealing spoilers.
---
Unless you can post a link to this I looked up and down the patch notes and didn’t see anything related
---
Highlights for me:
---
- Chinese set looks decent, still wanted BoS but Chinese is neat
---
- shoulder pads for 1st ranger armour to resemble the Elite/Advanced of New Vegas. Better be free to 1sters
---
- Nuka Cherry armour skin looks okay, at least it's new
---
- Matt style liberty Prime PA skin better be free to those of us that bought the originals. I'm not paying 1800 atoms for a slightly different shade of a skin I already splashed 1800 on and I shouldn't have to
---
All these bright, shiny, pristine wallpapers look like shit. Like walking into some gaudy showhome all the time going to players camps. There should be a weathered version of each.
---
That bizarre coloured armour skin looks atrocious. Hard no.
---
Dude stop with the hypotheticals. Frog legs is annoying and unfair to go against, it's that simple. Everytime I run it to one. The mood instantly changes because they jump around. 
---
It's my biggest gripe with this amazing gamemode. 
---
Amazing how much someone who supposedly doesn't even use frog legs defends it.
---
The gamemode would be so much better without out. 
---
Like I mentioned, it definitely deters people form playing. It shouldn't be a perk man.
---
I think the scrapbox should be applied for every players.
---
I think tents should be reworked so that they don't persist upon switching servers, and also should be made something available for everybody, and also they should be upgradable for atoms, allowing different looks (another point of spending atoms) and maybe improved convenience (now comes with B.E.N.C.H™ - Basic Equipment Needed for Character Happiness)
---
I think that the subscription should offer some atoms and maybe some cool outfit/camp thingy here and there, and there should be no in-game advantages out of having it. I'm not certain if I plan to renew my subscription, but making these convenience items part of regular gameplay of all players would make me certainly renew it. I want to support the game and I don't want to support questionable business practices.
---
Then everyone would just equip Unyielding to maximize luck and just go on a safe-hitting spree.
---
Even the reddit community is super divided on it, and reddit makes up such a tiny amount of the actual player base, if the hatred isnt even unanimous here then its a lot less of an issue then you think it is.  
---
Especially since rumor has it that sales of Fallout 1st are actually higher than bethesda expected them to be
---
rip for u/teightro
