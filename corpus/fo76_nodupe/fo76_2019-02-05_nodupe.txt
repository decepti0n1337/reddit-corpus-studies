Used to be able to 5 shot a Scorch Beast with my Gauss Rifle before the nerf-pocalypse, it took 3 shots the other night to take Colonel Gutsy down with that same rifle, I wanted to rage quit. 
---
---
---
Thanks
---
I see. I never where power armor outside a blast zone and I usually have my chameleon arm on until I start fighting.
---
STopped playing and uninstalled because of the bugs, and because every patch made the game more and more of a grind. This games not even fun now its literally a chore playing it. 
---
They mentioned upping the limit again in their apology letter after the last update
---
I‚Äôve wondered about the green glow, is it supposed to wear off, does it mean something? 
---
its real
---

---
the ash heap horde event was close to the vault and as they are mole rats they are able to dig underground so i think the horde was underground when you travelled to the event which in turn spawned them into vault 63 and because you joined the event thats where it put him/her.
---
I‚Äôm still hoping they get some stuff fixed ...I like building super immersive camps....but am really sad at the lack of building stuff in 76.  I‚Äôm still pushing to live this game but it‚Äôs hard right now.  Tedious grinding and fixing and lack of fun building ability‚Äôs like fo4 is killin me.....I love this game......i love this game....come on Bethesda help me out here.
---
It seems to me that compounded damage and limb staggering is broke as hell. 
---
If I put a round into a super mutants face rarely do they wince or stop charging. 
---
Loser
---
Awwwww someone seems upset. 
---
Only problem I run into is the buggy camp system not letting me place the blueprints for lame resons so I have to replace everything my self. Still saves mats tho.
---
I get stealth awarded middles, mines and armor all the time without realizing I‚Äôm carrying it...you‚Äôve probably been carrying 10 missiles and didn‚Äôt realize it lol
---
Last week's still work for today. Tomorrow you'll need new ones üòä
---
Ok, thanks. The video isn't mine, I just stumbled upon it @ youtube, but I can't find any other references to an unintentional or intentional access to that vault so I wanted to double check that with reddit.
---
I feel like you're a reverse karma farmer, after reading your post history
---
Figuring out what you need to keep and what you can get rid of and quickly replace if needed is tricky, but it can be done.  
---
Personally, I bulk everything I can.  I sell the excess.  By default I keep 2 or 3 bulk of everything.   The rest of the junk I make sure it is fully scrapped.  Unscrapped junk weighs more and takes up more room in the stash.
---
600lb stash limit is eaten up quickly by any weapons or armor as much of those have absolutely ridiculous weights associated with them.  Minimizing the stuff you save "just in case" is key, too.
---
I live somewhere between 300 and 600lbs and can usually make a variety of weapons and armor unless I've just spent everything on learning some new mods for a new plan I picked up.  
---
Getting rid of the excess is hard.  The 200 cap per unique vendor faction limit is terrible at a \~20 hour reset period.  That should reset every 2 hours or they should raise the limit.   The Barter perk would have a LOT more value if it raised the caps that vendors had by 50, 75, or 100 per level.   In fact, I think that would make it a good perk:  Level 1, 50 more caps at the vendor.  Level 2, another 75 more caps at the vendor (so 125 for those not really following along yet) and Level 3 would be another 100 caps for 225 more caps at the vendor for a total of 425 caps per vendor per day.  That would let me afford some of their ridiculously priced crap.
---
If your going for raw damage also make sure to get adrenal reaction 
---
Duplicates are the worst element of an awesome system here and the fix for them is mind numbingly uncomplicated. Give us the next level up card instead of a second one of the lowest level. Let us store the unneeded cards of our choosing, SO WE SELECT THE CARDS THAT ARE DEPLOYED FOR AVAILABILITY TO EQUIP JUST LIKE WE SELECT WHAT ITEMS TO CARRY AND WHICH TO LEAVE IN THE STASH
---
Wth is karma get lost small fry
---
Luxury. When I was killing a mole man, I had to use 38 mini nukes, degraded 4 super sledges AND had to pay for permission to kill the mole man... and when we were done, our dad would slice us in two with a bread-knife.
---
I remember stating the needless grind to extend play time being added after patch 2 I think? And being met with... HavE yOu NEveR PlAYed a SUrVivaL GaME?
---
I designed my camp around that bug. I should be able to place most of it pretty quickly.  Last time I had to move my camp I had it placed to my liking in about 5 minutes.  Next time I hope to have it down to about 2 or 3 minutes.  I really should have done that.  I'm glad you reminded me of it.  Thank you.
---
I support enemies doing more damage, and a tougher game overall. But I don't really see the bullet sponge argument. I do run into mobs like this but it's pretty much always because there's a large level difference between us, I'm outside of ideal range for my weapon, or the weapon itself is outdated. 
---
Also, if you take ammo perks and perks that affect breaking weapons, those aren't problems for long. If you don't spec your character into improving the things that bother you then ehhh, you're kind of out of luck.
---
They don‚Äôt this time around (yet), so it‚Äôs not even ulterior motives. Just plain old incompetence 
---
I just found that, umm I think I found it in Rob Co.
---
Yeah I couldn't agree more. I'm so fatigued by these games they just roll out like clockwork,there just isn't any love in them anymore.
---
Probably why I was killed in one hit from an All-Rise the other day at a workshop, was ridiculous. 
---
Bloodied builds do wonders. 
---
A 270 Damage SMG with a 91 fire rate will evaporate anything in front of you. Very, very quickly. 
---
I build mine off one foundation with stairs so it could be movied easily but it still bugged out kept saying something was floating 
---
This is why I stopped claiming. Once they said claiming opens you up to pvp, makes it pointless. They need to word the blurb to explain it. I have no problems with anyone taking my workshops away from me since I only claim for the xp and plans. But for pvp to follow me is crazy. This game, one step forward to steps back.
---
I used to be terrified of Assaultrons....now, Colonel Gutsy calls me a ‚ÄúDirty Commie‚Äù in my nightmares. They wanna nerf our weapons and make a damn Gutsy the Terminator 
---
I‚Äôm a fan of the concept of one point basic, one point expert, one point master, the variations between some being 5, some being 3 x 3, some being 1 x 3, and some being a different configuration just makes the perks design feel like it was done at different times
---
By different people and there needs to be a calibrating streamline to the basic, expert, master convention. 
---
Shhhh before they Nerf my FC farm.
---
There's probably a few legendary versions that are great. Explosive probably isn't as great as it was in FO4, and there's no plasma or cryo...
---
Anti-armour? Furious? Vampire? Not much to choose from. I miss the Plasma legendary :'(
---
And I thought new Vegas deathclaws were spooky 
---
I've heard about the griefers. I know people that have had various run-ins with a variety of idiots.  This was my first one, and boy was it a lesson learned.  I generally try to help people.  I'll drop materials, drop plans, drop anything I don't actively need or need to keep a reasonable reserve of.  If I have something extra and it can help someone else then it's just weight off my character and I'm glad someone is getting some use out of it.
---
Not having a choice in how badly someone else can screw with me takes away some of my interest in this game.  Maybe with some changes to how I play, it won't be as big of a deal in the future.  This time it really pissed me off.
---
Top of the World seems to be the new White Spring Golf Course, high level Mole Miners, Super Mutants and bugs. I got attacked by an army of lvl 50 glowing Ants the other night up there that we‚Äôre eating 3 shots each of my TSE lever Rifle before they‚Äôd kick the bucket....buck, buck, buckettttt
---
Is your issue that the bodies disappear without turning into meat piles? Patch 4 seemed to have changed the timer for how fast dead enemies turn into meat piles. And sometimes the meat piles will spawn some ludicrous distance away from the dead body.
---
I just ran a little way off.  It was fine.
---
also gunpowder and plans
---
Okay awesome ty so much
---
The Mutation Adrenal Reaction is also crucial. It‚Äôs basically the bloodied effect, expect for every weapon you own. And it stacks with Bloodied. With just Bloodied, Adrenal Reaction, and Nerd Rage, your Damage starts to get really damn good. 
---
With a ranged bloodied build you don‚Äôt really need Unyielding, as it doesn‚Äôt scale your damage or health. It‚Äôs better to have Assassin or Sentinel, and a single piece of Chameleon gear for sneakiness since weightless is Poo. 
---
Here's a thought. Maybe and I mean just maybe. Aim.
---
Which 'people' are hyping it up like that? I have never seen a comment suggesting vaults would be anything that large. It's pretty obvious a vault can't house an expansion.... xD
---
I would put money on vaults being the same size as they were in Fallout 4. So basically, they will likely be equivalent to an endgame dungeon, and take about an hour to clear, maybe less with a strong group or more with a solo player.
---
My personal main hopes are that vaults scale to group size/level, so they're not brainless easy or stupidly hard, and that they ideally have locked wings or something else to make them more dynamic. Like if I clear it once and it's exactly the same every time, ehh... would just feel like another Fort Defiance grind. 
---
I had that problem early on.  I seem to have it fixed now, I think.  (That is until I find out that they've reintroduced the bug and/or created new ones.)  At least the last time I went to move my camp, the only stuff I had to manually place was all outside on the ground.
---
Bolstering only gives you bonus‚Äôs at high HP. 
---
Aim? I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about 
---
Twisted muscles actually boosts the damage. I have talons and twisted muscles. Before I took each serum I made sure to look at the damage my gauntlet did before hand.
---
Saturday all the MODUS Terminals said they were in use for me. Then Sunday, they were fine.
---
It‚Äôs just soooo hilariously expensive....and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve bought a few things in there out of my own pocket, but my lord, it‚Äôs so....damn...expensive 
---
I'am not doubting you, but if thats the case- why are they flying in the circle and not have them just stay in place?  That seems to be a needless command- and makes it harder to hide.  So it makes me wonder if there's a lore reason of some type for it.  As they are so visible from the Mothman museum I thought it was purposefully leading me there.
---
I've had one BoS plan from a treasure map in the Toxic Wastes, but good luck with that. Some armor plans can be found by grinding world spawns, but I don't think I've ever seen BoS or Dense plans like that. Dense is at least still available via random mods rather than plans.
---
No idea whether the lack of armor &amp; weapon mod plans is intentional. I suspect it's unfinished, as the worst server hop in the game (X-01 mods) is still present.
---
Scrap, lots of steel boom. 
---
I bought the card, but do not have it equipped (the one for cap stashes).
---
I got this confused with another post lolol
---
I have both the Xbox version and the PC version.  If I had to do it all over again, I would only get the PC version.  The mods alone are far more worth it on PC.   
---
Reactive plates take up a torso mod, and i am sure they can exist on all power armors.
---
WS Train station has always been tethered to WS Vendors...stupid, I know 
---
Fuck I sneak when I'm just adventuring for new map destinations because I want to know if there is an enemy that's spotted me that I didn't see.  Works liike a charm, also you do double damage when sneaking.  People want to run and gun this game like its COD or something.  Sneak and aim for the head people.
---
One single solitary streamer who plays in the graveyard shift kinda hours I need human companionship. 
---
I find all mine in one of the cooling towers at Thunder mountain
---
It could be. Maybe it's just gunfire "catching up" as I load in. Happens when I fast travel to my hideout as well. It like a 2 minute gunfight all in the span of 1-2 seconds so it sounds like a lot of really fast pops.
---
I'm pretty sure you can level up existing cards with the level one card you get from the packs, I've done it before for sure. But two of the ones I got were the science and science master. I already have them maxed. I don't need the others at all. To hell with storing them, just give me like 100xp or something for them. 
---
I cant wait till all the camp bugs are fixed I want to build a nice base but I have to be able to move at a moment's notice thanks to those union merchants people.  Got put on a blacklist for some reason and now there ghosts milita may come after me.
---
Probably because the code pieces just expired and the NPC loaded before it did.
---
I think the blackbird paint by far has been the best thing in the store
---
I got the silver shroud outfit as well, I liked it in fo4, but it‚Äôs not quite as special with everyone wearing it 
---
*read in old man voice*. Geet off ma‚Äô yard you menacing whipper snappers! Damn kids an their damn phones.
---
Wow, that's amazing.
---
Anyone found any other uses for campfires "groundness"?  I think you can place crops in them but there's probably something else handy that I haven't thought of yet.
---
It‚Äôs not guaranteed, I‚Äôve went looking according to these googled locations and came up empty more times than not 
---
I tried using an orbital strike on a camp one time and it landed right in the middle but didn‚Äôt do very much in terms of damage 
---
This happened to me the other day.  I was fighting a death claw with a level 87 (I was 20). I melee fight and clicked VATS. It targeted the 87 by accident and he was like FU here's my mega lightning gun or some shit.  My bad dude. 
---
I had 4 witches‚Äô dresses pop up with the exact same vendor. I thought maybe a duper had dropped them off, but your observation implies that rare apparel is popping up at the Modus (Armory as in Production?) vendor four at a time...
---
If you do the quest mayor for a day in watoga you'll unlock a safe that has 8 stimpaks in it which respawns everyday. Just a helpful tip! Also, if you go to a medical center and get a bunch of blood packs then throw on the perk chemist then you can craft 2 stims for every blood pack to got. (Plan required)
---
Saw him once. Spawned at my camp, a short hike west of Watoga. Didn't drop anything of note.
---
There should nothing, NOTHING, prewar that requires flux to build. 
---
I‚Äôve heard it too, i think I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs gunfire audio coming through on the server before the screen fully loads 
---
I'm no developer man. Just saying what is. And yeah i agree. 
---
The vendors are what we are talking about. 
---
And you let other people kill her dident you
---
Not gonna lie, I clicked on this to learn where to find them. But. I too have the science scribe outfit and must say that the sentry bot helmet looks great on it.
---
I dont know why this keeps getting downvoted. This is absolutely true. The Atom Shop is like pre K work for a developer. It's probably somebody's coming in on Saturday for an extra 4 hours job. It is literally just retextures of things already in the game which if people understood how easy it actually is to do in developing software then they just may quit complaining about how they need to stop with atom shop and fix bugs. Sure they have other outfits that aren't found in the game but again they just take a model, slap a different texture on it, and maybe add some extra flair to it and bam new outfit. 
---
Bugs in a massive world like this are not so easily squashed. Yes, they probably should be faster at it since this engine isn't exactly new but you are trying to make the fix work in every segment of the game world, for every person who signs in, every time. Games have always been broken by the people who play them and no matter what they do this game has people out they trying to find the cracks to break the wall down the moment they say something is fixed, especially now due to the way so many people view this game. 
---
Oh well, I still enjoy it and I dont mind the atom shop. I've got some items I wanted and have over 3000 points saved waiting for the next thing in actually care about. Until it comes out I'll just keep playing with what is available for free in the game, which is quite a lot. 
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm aware. I googled the list of which vendors carry specific plans and mods and such and went looking....it‚Äôs not guaranteed, unless they have a limited spawn amount of them per server and someone has beat me to it 
---
I don't keep low HP most of the time, trying to steer clear of the glass cannon moniker
---
Might be. I thought somebody sold them too, but if you saw another type and exactly 4 I'm thinking your theory has merit.
---
Not really (except for the weight thing), it's that there is a *huge* disparity in performance between a stock weapon and a properly modded weapon used by a player with the right perk cards (with every anti-armor option available).  My semi-auto ballistic rifles last a ridiculously long time between repairs.  I have no idea how you can claim they break fast.
---
They just reset. You'll have to wait for them to get deciphered. 
---
I have only seen it on starred legendary enemies but not consistently. No idea why some do, some don‚Äôt...
---
Could be, wonder if itll not expire and just stay forever then
---
Does the jetpack allow you to fly or just jump high? How does that work? 
---
Those mods sound perfect. Looks like I'll be needing that perk card that lets you mod power armor. 
---
I definitely harvest a lot. I think I have kind of a problem actually. My stash weight is constantly a problem even with me scrapping and bulking everything. I should probably seek counseling.. but just when you think you have enough of everything, you repair your armor and weapons, your camp, and your workshops, and boom, your down to 560 pounds. 
---
A pole hook? Wow üòÇ I'm just gathered every mutation the hard way a kept them 
---
Ironically, the Welcome Mat exists, but it's just cosmetic.
---
I agree. It‚Äôs becoming way to hard to do things. I‚Äôm pretty much stuck in the Cranberry bog now because I cNt even dent a scorched beast or get over runner by everything else. 
---
It does actually. There is one place that fits that description perfectly.
---
Yeah not to mention that giant old god, tentacle monster inside.
---
Start to bring up the map.  Menu on the left (LB on Xbox):  settings.  Bottom option let‚Äôs you toggle pacifist mode on or off.  On and no damage to others.
---
Yup, you need to prioritize high-damage weapons with every armor-piercing option you can get your hands on.  If you aren't punching through armor at high levels (preferably shots to the weak points), you're spinning your wheels.
---
I killed a Scorchbeast with him and it was easily my best experience of the game.
---
My "God roll" minigun would be anti-armor with 10% increased damage and faster movement while ADSing. That would work really well with my build and play style.
---
I normally would have, but they've mostly jumped ship too. 
---
That's one of the many instances where other weapons are simply better.
---
Assault rifle and handmade are the same way.
---
I totally understand if the game is to hard and causing you stress move on. 
---
Ps4. Thanks anyway. 
---
I've only seen it on a few clocks inside Whitespring.
---
Aiming was for Tse. Back to Vats with you!
---
Seems like even with the proper perk, certain guns break faster than others. My Lever Rifle breaks twice as fast as my Gauss Rifle and they‚Äôre the same level and value. I dunno?
---
You usually end up selling exactly 4 outfits to each vendor because with all the charisma/vendor price buffs they sell for 50 caps each. Having plans for witches costume is a goddamn cap machine.
---
I have the same problem when my build is at 90%+ of budget. Stay away from stairs at that point, and never, NEVER, use the god awful stairs with pillars.
---
But if the spear kept its usual animation with medium swing speed in power armor, I believe it would be better than my super sledge. 
---
If you can one shot somebody with a rifle wanna try the pvp subs cause they really love rifle people its there favorite
---
Ok.  Thank you!
---
Happy cake day,  fellow wastelander!
---
All good melee builders will run rifleman perks so when you run away and try to vats us, even if you have enough ap (because melee requires an op ap build) we will just 1 shot you with a two shot dragon. üòò
---
It seems like if you aren't focusing on anti-armor, you're going to hate life.  And don't bother with energy weapons since there is apparently no way to reduce energy resistance anywhere near the way you can penetrate armor.
---
I did a ninja edit there.
---
Why would a spear be comparable to a rocket powered sledgehammer?
---
Tire irons are obsolete because of machetes and ski swords are simply better than both. 
---
Lol, nice 
---
Upvoted for being silly.
---
Witches outfit can be crafted if said player has the plan. It doesn't cost much to make them at all. I personally do this myself as a way to take in 1400caps per day. Each vendor buys the outfit for 48-50 caps each hence why there is maybe 4. As for hunters long coat, high chance duper selling off to vendors 
---
Yeah, the TSE shit was no fun at all. Being one shot by melee isn‚Äôt that fun either but that‚Äôs still happening.
---
Real gun battles with people running through the air and staggering each other with grenades and using cover can be really fun though.
---
More of the broken and boring aspects that made me wanna leave
---
You won‚Äôt like this but... unyielding is so big because you can fire a ton of vats shots and critical‚Äôs fill way way faster.
---
Imagine vats and critical‚Äòs with 30 agility and luck
---
Excavator armor was designed to be a mineing rig..... Don't need a jet pack on it.
---
Ffs. 
---
Why would I lie about it and doctor an image or use an old one? 
---
Ridiculous. 
---
It would be enough if the perk cards effected stash weight. 
---
Top of the cooling tower at Thunder Mountain, in a little room, in front of some controls. Just saw one last night! 
---
It does follow you through servers thoüòê
---
All heavy guns are laughably under powered...I have a TSE Gatling that dropped a month ago in WS nuke zone and used it once before going back to my Lever Rifle/Super Sledge combo. Dumped all my 5mm for weight management. That thing should melt a Scorchbeast....but alas, it does not
---
Thank you all so much
---
Hopefully still there 
---
 Yeah. I have a beastly sword which is what I use for a few of em', but as the Pistol is usually up for the speed bonus I use it all the time for just random targets.
---
 The Western Revolver with a Long Barrel and a True Receiver is very strong. Mine's at 98 now and that Receiver enhances hip shots. ;)
---
Will there even be that many here to play the game, by the time they open the vaults? 
---
Plus the animation is just wrong. You stab with a spear, you don't bludgeon with it.
---
It does seem like they could adjust damage scaling a ton, but I suspect they just \*want\* you to have to shoot the SBQ for ten straight minutes. If you can take it down with a couple of well-placed .50 cal shots it's just not ~~hard~~ fun enough

---
That might explain it. Course I'd think you could sell to a player for a lot more than that.
---
jesus FUCK
---
Better than, after it dies, it's just empty. At least you can still dream...
---
This. If a player vending/social hub was added it wouldn't be difficult to get players for raids. 
---
Lol
---
To say they've been running around like chickens with their heads cut off is likely inaccurate. If they were active in solving known problems more would have been accomplished by now. The fact that they are getting changes made so slowly tells me 2 things. 1 they already got what they were looking for out of this game and the end product game wasn't it, and 2 customer satisfaction was never the priority. 
---
This is what I see from beta to now. This is considering, flaws, complaints, the reaction to those complaints, patches and lack of communication. 
---
I'm sorry if this is offensive to you or you don't like my opinion and disagree. You're entitled to your opinion. With the lack of information from Bethesda, the gross imbalance of the game from day 1, and utter lack of correction no matter how obvious. It a sh@! Show.
---
Did they appoint Billy McFarland to run the production, release and maintenance of 76? Cause it's that kind of S show.
---
TBO I want to love the game, I really tried. I've played all the previous games and always wanted a multi player fallout. But this is a joke and I'm done being part of the punchline. I hope I'm wrong and things change and you get what you want out of 76, but I doubt I will.
---
As far as food is concerned it ain't bethesda's fault you're running around with  Speed Demon
---
Big bend tunnel also has lots of scorched. 
---
I'm not at the station currently but someone else is. Might still be. Two players already passed them up.
---
Exactly! 
---
Except they just talk at you. There is no actual dialouge whatsoever. Hell from what one of Cascadia's members told me, 76 *removed the dialouge menu from 4 entirely* from sniffing around in the ESM.
---
As a user of light metal, I am confounded by how people ignore it in favor of shitty armor.
---
I was solo.  I saw her coming and ran until I was able to gide again.  Scorchbeasts are annoying, but they really aren't that big a deal.
---
so i recently decided to get the game and I've actually been enjoying it very much however there's a couple things here that i agree with and do have some ideas that could make sense for implementation and that would give users a somewhat better time.  
---
1. For the issue with stash requirements - when junk is stored in the stash the weights assigned could be made lower, with a retrospective change to bulk values too.   
---
For example : each time away from my camp i can end up bringing back nearly 60/70 lbs of junk, which probably goes down to around 30ish when scrapped and then to 15 when bulked potentially having perk cards apply to the stash so the weight would be up to 75% lower for junk within it too as the weight shoots up by... 75% when transferred from inventory to stash, which can make it fill up faster than expected too.  
---
2. Potentially giving bulk/junk a value which can then be sold to vendors would be good as well as giving vendors more than 200 caps to barter with . it doesn't have to be a high value but enough to make it worth the time spent getting it in the world. this would enable people to earn caps a bit quicker by selling excess junk, thus keeping stashes cleaner and giving them the ability to get more plans or better items.  
---
3. show total weight for item stacks. this would make it easier and i wouldn't need to pull out a calculator :P  
---
4. wall mounts for guns and armour mounts. this can take away from the camp budget and would give people the chance to "save" higher level guns/ armour for later on without impacting on the stash budget because 25lbs for a rocket launcher or mini-gun is not great.  
---
5. maybe a way to "sell" or exchange perks in order for ones you might actually want.  
---
6. scrapping a weapon gives you the blueprint for the weapon - only a maybe for this one but i'm annoyed cause i been trying to get a high level energy weapon for ages haha  
---
7. the ability to remove weapon modifications like sights and things in order to save components when changing up to a new weapon/ higher level, that or make them scrapable in order to make the upgrade cost of the new ones on a new weapon less of a hit to our "junk banks"  
---
8. a slightly slower rate of decay for drink and food because it feels like a lot of my inventory has to be taken up by food/drink.
---
theres probably more but thats what i can think of as ideas for now :)
---
If you suspect the Bethesdorks is going to patch why increase the visibility of the exploit by posting the video on a subreddit you know they visit?
---
lol or not dang....
---
No posts for 7 hrs ? No wonder as the mods are using the blanket banning tactic. Go figure 
---
Yeah, it's just lazy. And they had different ammo types in previous games.  
---
On the other hand, you can look at the RDR2 subreddit and see how many people finished that game without figuring out there even \*were\* different ammo types.
---
Issue now though is if a good weapon drops I don't bother picking it up because I can't hold onto it. It has to be a god roll for me to bother.
---
Yeah it flys at the cost of ap and fusion cores. I can fly to about the height of 3 - 4 walls high. I can jump across the roofs in harpers ferry. 
---
I've found out recently that bulking only wastes plastic. So stop that. I'm always full too because I look in every corner of every room. 
---
I only use them to poke through walls and floors/ceilings. The rest is wires. 
---
To be fair in my opinion, the scorched queen only could use a little debuff, otherwise, one shotting a pack of super mutant is not fun at all, it become boring really fast, I like how hard it is now, repairs could be lowered in prices but they said they gonna do it, I like the game better now
---
Can't shoot what you cant see üòè 
---
And let's be honest.. alot of  players have no idea how perks even work in this game  . They just build a high damage melee build and negate the rest. 
---
Now that sounds interesting... 
---
I think that gun has some ridiculous armor penetration stat. Only damage reduction works against it: Lone Wanderer, Dodgy, Troubleshooters, Sentinel etc. However, if you shoot them in the weapon arm, they'll switch to using rubbish weapons instead.
---
flavors of mayhem, for black diamond?
---
Load up xEdit and check for yourself.
---
Then they would love me ‚ù§
---
 I have quite a bit of Strength and very little Luck. ;) The Sword shines because you can get it to ignore pretty well all Armor. That's a big deal with things like Muties and Scorchbeasts.
---
 I find you can hip fire the Lever Action so well that I can probably hit close to 50% as I run and gun. I've never used VATS in any of the Fallout games and I find it works best for the Damage/Hits statistic. ;) 
---
I just switched to a melee cannibal build. Only have to worry about repairing my swords, and don't need to carry access meds or food. Only downside is you can't really attack airborne targets. 
---
Now I can play the game for a few hours and actually play some good quests, instead of spending hours finding ammo for my guns, only to have to go out and find materials to repair them, so that I can go find more ammo again
---
Good distinction, and an excellent suggestion.
---
Lol a m4 with an acog, grenade launcher, and full ammo weighs like 13 pounds. Guns weight waaaaaay to much in this game
---
Im making the joke youd be ripped to shreds pvp with hardcore players i sential or calvier armors no real winning in those battles ever 
---
I agree but same to you I run full mutations on my build, I actually set it up for fully engaged pvp. I'm just waiting on the new server opening. 
---
i server hopped for days and never found it there
---
Fine by me, I barely reach 400 half the time and when I do it's because I decided to store some random ammo in there. Right now I'm teetering on the edge, but that's mainly because I started hoarding aid and ammo I've heard rumors of a shared stash and personal vendors. 
---
also, falsely accused for civil unrest?
---
There are so many things in this game that don't seem to actually be there for a reason. Like they just wanted filler and/or parity with previous games but there's nothing unique enough about the items that you actually would want to use them.
---
Totally agree, maybe add a drill to the end of an arm, but a jet pack is just silly.
---
Nerf the only good thing left, wooo
---
20-30 is harder than the rest honestly, because you can access some good perks but others are still level gated at that point. 
---
I'm level 123 and have only seen it once. It was on the very northeast corner of the map near some house. It took a while to kill it and it dropped nothing noteworthy.
---
Interesting  I'll give that a try next time - cheers!
---
Ya thanks that's a really creative and original insult
---
These details always seem to be ignored when people say melee is OP. 
---
Also there's the weirdness of having it say 3/3 or 2/2 at the bottom but having 5 in it. What are these numbers? Either they're broken, or i don't understad what is being counted. 
---
It should really be relative to your level.
---
Scorchbeasts have an explosive attack, so what you need is not resistances but a Padded or Dense torso mod. Fireproof perk should work too, but the difference even from Padded is huge. 
---
where did u get the plans? i have all the plans but the helmet and chest piece
---
My rifle has a special perk where it ignores 100% or all sentinal or cavalier armor bought off Ebay üòâ or maybe it's just my vats crit that ignores it..
---
The nerf on explosives is too much, that‚Äôs when i gave up on them.  Better move would be to nerf explosive round base damage, NOT THE FUDGING PERK. 
---
no thats not exactly a joke he actually has a in game lore reason he does (attempting to not do spoilers) but the basics of it are it was a raider group who specialized in booby traps 
---
No. You just need to get gooder 
---
All gone. GT suck your feet got them all
---
Because only a handful of locations spawn the stuff and it is always tapped out when I go serching. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHA.
---
I can only hope it isn‚Äôt the last time!
---
I like that idea! 
---
Random spawn in the mire I think
---
The wound is still fresh, it hurts 
---
Max is 50% on the rifle perk and then another 36 if you invest into tank killer but that doesnt negate sential or cavalier effects at all 
---
Exactly! It's not if you have any idea how this game works.  Which.. sadly most do not  . 
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. Hopped, skipped and jumped multiple times with multiple vendors looking for BOS Torso and shadowed leather limbs. Got nothing.
---
Out of power armor, every other swing is a stab but then there is that weird bludgeon swing. But in power armor, every swing is a slow bludgeon
---
yeah high power weapons do very well against enemies compared to rapid fire ones
---
really they should have the damage resistance go down the more bullets hit a target this would let miniguns quickly ramp up the dmg as they chew through the armor in a realistic damage concept 
---
Real world scenario.
---
You get 2 shots in with your rifle before you have a suicider mutant charging you followed by 6 super mutants with machine guns and 2 hounds.
---
I just tested an hour ago. Outside of VATS and sneak shots my lever action takes 13 chest shots to drop a level 68 Super Mutant warlord. My instigating Super Sledge takes 2 shots.....unless I hit him with a +40% power swing.....in that case he takes one hit.
---
huh? why do i need energy resistance to use an energy weapon?
---
Dude, White Springs is a griefer's playground.  #1 way to avoid trouble with griefers is... don't build there. Serious.  It's actually my most hated location on the map.  Griefer's are just one reason.  Enemies spawn there like crazy and robots will often run straight into your line of fire while you are shooting at ghouls and trying to survive.  If you hit just one of them  once (barely doing any damage) every robot there will aggro on you and before you know it you are battling a massive horde of ghouls and robots too.  White Springs sucks. 
---
thx
---
Or does it ...? 
---
Also vats crit totally ignores this fancy armor 
---
With much more modes of difficulty &amp; a team work based combat system aka combos?
---
Plus a free roam w/ giant titans walking around?
---
Don‚Äôt straw man my point, sir
---
I got a spare plan on xb1 if u wanna buy
---
People keep saying this game is hard and it is amusing. 
---
honestly I'd rather enemies do 2-3x as much damage and have 70% less hp make hiding and tactics mean something rather then just walking into the enemies knowing its bullet sponge versus bullet sponge 
---
Or some way for us to build our camps on those huge tracts of land.
---
I've slowed down from the queen runs, since the update only had \~9 runs, after someone told me you can now buy   
---
 all the serums I stopped altogether. Before it was like 6-9 queens a day, even doing non tse runs to prep for the nerf, since I refuse to buy duped stuff from our sister subreddit, my plan was to get them through the queen.
---
Our groups characters change but queen runs usually involves lvls353-lvl9(nine) depending on who's on.  Most can solo the queen, some can carry the queen, issue is **using the games mechanics to your advantage**. Our lvl50 can/has solo carry a full group \~8m,  but most players are just not doing enough damage regardless of their level/weapons. I even lost my junk as a bet that a group involving 5+lvl100 with tse's would be able to kill her at 10% with 20m on the clock.  [I lost](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ACdBgNRc24_lajA&amp;cid=E15641FA403D5F02&amp;id=E15641FA403D5F02%211417&amp;parId=E15641FA403D5F02%21994&amp;o=OneUp) This was pre tse nerf too, having a bunch of mooches sucks, but look at them as groupies, are you going to disappoint them or are you going to get good and carry them? or better yet get the queen to low health and watch them struggle at the realization of how little damage they contribute.
---
My honest answer that gets alot of hate from the ~~carebear~~ community is I would like to kill all of them, literal parasites but that's not an option yet, come survival I will have my way and their free rides with me are gone. You can almost guarantee empty servers since...you know... it's fallout.
---
I got it doing dailies, i know the Enclave sells some recipes like stimpacks radaways fury and bufftats not sure about buffout however. 
---
But your forgetting 15% per armor and having 5 makes that crit dink off its been proven the armor is strong you cant negate armor special effects just cause you say you can 
---
With the vendors plans patch I see it in the enclave medic wing pretty often. 
---
I've played there since Beta and yesterday was the first problem I've had.  (I don't count accidentally shooting bots.  That's the nature of the area and one I've only had to deal with twice in that same time frame.)
---
My camp is far to the south.  The only reason someone would be hating on it there is if they wanted that junk extractor location for themself.  All they'd have to do is load to a different server.
---
Gtfo tik tok slut
---
Pvp in power armor is a bad idea, ive had my power armor completly destroyed twice. And one hit both times by melee
---
Flavor of Mayhem is still broke....this was one of the first broke quests reported...I skipped over it for that very reason. Went back last night to tidy up some of the few remaining quests I still have left, finished it, went back to Rose and she wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge me. I server hopped, quest marker was gone, Roses Syringer was gone out of my inventory, no rewards awarded for completion...Hell, the ENTIRE quest was deleted from the PipBoy!!! Seriously, Bethesda....I‚Äôm one of the few that has bit my tongue and enjoyed myself through all the bullshit, but this is pretty ridiculous
---
Ok awesome, I will start grinding daily quests I guess. Thx
---
MODUS: "Greetings, members. I have found a... *little experiment* from our previous guests that... did not pan out. Any able-bodied members in the area are requested to... help clean up."
---
Fo76 is already dead.  Friend of mine just quit to play WoW.
---
No. I've made sure this will never happen again.  They can flatten my camp after this and I can rebuilt it without any problem again.  Eat a bag of fertilizer.
---
Completely agree. Have been messed with so much more since the updates. I literally mind my own business and am constantly harrassed by other players. It's ridiculous. Passive should protect players both from being killed and killing others. Not everyone wants to participate in the pvp aspect. I understand people get bored with the lack of content but they should play another game instead of using others for their entertainment.
---
Hear you, and thanks, believe it or not '76 counted as physical therapy, so even if I walked away tomorrow I have no regrets and enough good will for the distraction it provided to only be a little bitter when things go sideways 
---
Ok. I guess I just need to server hop some more but I haven‚Äôt seen it there yet
---
Good point. 
---
I made it to level 90 and quit playing after they completely ruined using the rifles and shotguns. I used so damn many perk cards to make my rifles and shotguns damage worth using only now to have the dumbasses at Bethesda to totally make all these points worthless.  Legendary 2 shot guns are barely better than a level 50 gun. I tried to stick it out after really liking Fallout 4 but they totally ruined and haven't fixed so damn many easy gameplay issues and freezes that I will Never buy another game from these clowns again!  What a joke! R.i.P. Bethesda 
---
I just recently spent an afternoon at the Gorge Junk Yard, put together enough black titanium to make 2 excavator suits.

And I thought I was just a crappy player since I had those issues. I spend more than half of my time playing trying to manage my constant full inventory, traveling to various traders (which each only have 200 caps max) losing money on fast traveling back and forth, selling shit I carried through the whole map for almost nothing and still not having enough caps to even get a decent weapon. I now have six different power frames and I can‚Äôt use a single one since I‚Äôm level 23.  It‚Äôs exhausting. I just tried going through the big bend tunnel and some low level scorched that apparently just wouldn‚Äôt die, cost me all of my ammo for two different weapons - and there was nothing of value in that stupid tunnel. It‚Äôs infuriating. 
---
I can‚Äôt collect enough materials to craft ammo so I can move on and do more missions, because I have to carry so much junk - since there‚Äôs no space in my ridiculous stash box in my home. Why does that even has a limit?! Why can‚Äôt we collect the things we need so we won‚Äôt have to spend so much time selling things we could have used later on, getting paid shit for it, sometimes even less than what it costed me to fast travel there! 
---
If you're on ps4 I'll gladly show you how it's done ‚ò∫If I'm outside west tek. I can take down ALL the super mutants from the spawn point , to the entrance and not get hit once. All enemies going down in 1-2 shots.  My hunting rifle does 400+ damage . It's all about the builds. 
---
honestly the stealing thing sounds more like it would go with survival more then adventure mode 
---
as it is right now turrets are just about useless so we would just see lvl 140s with super sledges walk through rocket turrets in power armor to look through stashes for things they need 
---
personally I don't really have a stash issue but I constantly sell off bulk goods to get rid of them 
---
LOL, way better than F076 right now
---
camp fires best item in 76, soon to be nerfed
---
Welcome to the club. I haven‚Äôt got on since last Monday and don‚Äôt plan on it anytime soon. By far one of the worst games I‚Äôve ever played from a AAA publisher.
---
weapon balancing in 76 and FO4 is horrible, HORRIBLE.
---
Taint got no gas innit mmhrmm
---
I call it bugthesda but yours is cool too
---
[removed]
---
Congrats on making the stupidest title in the history of this subreddit
---
?
---
So you have to waste 30 minutes sneaking around and hitting crits and I can plow in with my melee build and 1 shot every one of them before you reload your gun once.
---
I promise you really can ‚ò∫ tried and true . Even with the 15% per armor and 8% per armor . That armor isn't as OP as people think. 
---
Not an insult my friend!
---
they should make a level system with each faction so we can slowly raise the amounts on vendors by doing side quests kind of like how enclave had those quests to be general 
---
figure 4 tiers of missions each raising it by 50 caps for double the reward - also a 5th level that lets you build a shopping terminal in your base to sell to for each faction (just sell still have to go there to buy)
---
also I'd like to see something for special vendors like maybe you help Grahm out with some medicine for his Brahmin and he gives you a device that shows him on the map 
---
Hire this man
---
Yeah I guess it shouldn‚Äôt be comparable. I have tested the swing speed and the spear definitely switches to the same swing speed as my super sledge. Both have the 40% swing speed perk. 
---
I just don‚Äôt understand y it switches swing speed. If it was medium swing speed I think that it we make it more usable
---
We only have 1 lol 
---
This is simply a discussion. Fallout 76 honestly feels like, in my opinion, a building game and a game to see how broken you can make your character. 90% of the time people are just building camps in different ways. 10% people are out getting materials and mutations and maybe some quest. 
---
We can get together and I'll show ya ! Takes MAYBE (I've never timed it) 3  minutes to clear the outside of west tek ? 
---
Youre not explaining how you can negate a special effect all your saying is a vats critical is magical what happens when you miss and have to actually use a normal shot you could still hit them but with out that crit you make it sound like your builds worthless
---
It‚Äôs hard in the grind aspect 
---
Mentally challenged would be a sports scholarship (u.s.thing right?).
---
Martial Artist. I've some how ignored that card across 115+ levels, not melee build luckily.
---
for those who get their kicks from seeing whose identical build of all rise + netlisted perk card layout can land their single hit first, im convinced there should just be a stadium added to the map. Enter the arena, two netlisters enter, one leaves a second later. Maybe they can bet on who will land their monoblow first using a robot, that they‚Äôll kill for laughs thus disabling the whole system. 
---
Amen....anyone mad at ONLY getting 500+ hrs of entertainment for $60? No words.
---
Making it tedious, and there are still weapons that aren't fixed, how insane is that
---
&gt;It's also possible that many dev resources are stuck working on some other new feature, which slows the pace of improvement on the  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;current  
---
&gt; game to a crawl, even though everyone knows its busted as shit.
---
Spoiled and entitled a bit, aren't we.   
---
They've been releasing large updates every 2 weeks, which tackle the most broad-userbase affecting issues.   
---
Compare to the patch release cadence of any past title, theirs or other people's their release schedule is aggressive as all hell and they're rocking it. Arguably going too fast (judging by the regression bug issues they just had).   
---
What's shut here is not the game. It's your spoiled &amp; over-entitled unrealistic expectation attitude.   
---
Ore will no doubt get nerfed as it is too productive to contribute to the *grind end game*.
---
It takes me less than that and I don't have to waste my time with following a routine. I just plow in and smash them all and eat a few steaks after I'm done.
---
Now if someone can figure out how to invert walls manually so I can build a barn exterior inside 
---
How much?
---
You are probably right but, if they didn't want to make heavy guns a viable build, then why are they even in the game? What's the point of role-playing if there's really only one or two types that are useful?
---
Go ahead and make assumptions but obviously lots of people didn't know that heavy guns sucked so much. It sure is easy to figure out if you try using them though. I probably will change my build, but now I have to grind a bunch of point changes and new perks in the meantime. 
---
60% after White Knight patch nerf for people of the future reading this.
---
As a programmer with some small database familiarity, there might be something to this.  Making queries to tables for specific types of items might save some load.  I sure hope Bethesda provides a useful comment on the plausibility.  (I'm not holding my breath, but hoping)
---
Have a great day. 
---
I prefer excavator for the 200 carry weight bonus.  It's too good for all but the hardest end game content (nuke zones / Queen)
---
I don't know.. It's been pretty fun for me ever since they fixed the carry weight bug. What I do is log in for a few minutes to sell some stuff and then I log out and play Skyrim for the rest of the night. Good times! üòÇ
---
You eat it
---
Seems weird you remove sneak and vats from the equation.
---
Sneak i can understand but what exactly is a rifle build then. 15 on per of course but what about the other 35 pts.
---
Str is pointless unless you're a hoarder. 
---
End is 3 max for fireproof.
---
Int at 5 because there is little reason for more.
---
Cha 3-6 max because...well its cha and its uses out of combat are better.
---
Agi has its uses, especially adrenaline and sneak perks.
---
You're still left with 10 or so points and that's if you go heavy on cha/agi.
---
Vats is where they should go and its a massive damage boost, probably bigger than 9pts for 60% more damage.
---
I vats crit the exterior of west tek with a suppressed none legendary combat rifle. Vats crits to the head are one shots, i crit every 3rd shot. Nothing takes more than 3 shots to die.
---
I clicked this thinking it was a power armor frame made using death claw parts as the plating, but this is pretty hardcore too. Draw that next?
---
&gt; There was no logic to it.
---
I'm pretty sure their logic was "push this game out and get our money as fast as possible. Fix the game after release and call it 'improvements'. Love, Management."
---
U get from SBQ 
---
It should be 3k shared across all toons with the camp budget the same as it currently is. (So I guess that's 2700 and a budget of 300).
---
There's some interesting talk in another thread specifically about damage resistance, and after seeing how it actually works, I totally agree.
---
Server hopping won't do anything
---
Get off my game
---
True but also no sight of legendaries spawning there as well. 
---
 it was quite specific. BOS stuff mostly and some Marine Armor sometimes. I farmed it for a long time. ;)
---
Have a mid 90s toon on ps4 and just hit 55 on the box. Ive done a few SBQ on ps4 and we usually get her down. I have yet to have an Xbox kill, usually for this reason. Ive been going to them since the toons could wear PA, and I always do my part: reviving, adds, and when i can, shot on the Queen with my heaviest wepons. i usually build a gatling(at least until i find a legendary one on the xbox), i find it to be the best damage to ammo-use ratio. Also dropped my first nuke last night, and my game crashed so i wasnt able to try to kill her. Would have been nice to kill the queen i summoned(or, by the theme of this thread, try to)
---
I agree with you. I limit my PvP to bounty hunting or hunter/hunted, but with my rifle build and no legendary damage effects on my lever or handmade guns I rarely lose. 
---
If a melee player can get the drop on me, then sure, they‚Äôll likely take me out in one hit‚Äîbut when I can line them up from a distance, it‚Äôs over. Even if it takes 5 shots (it‚Äôs usually 1-3) there‚Äôs plenty of time before they can get close enough. 
---
This is why the melee meta builds don‚Äôt bother me. I don‚Äôt think rifles are OP, but strategy matters as much as a damage stat which leads to a pretty balanced situation. 
---
Some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in this game has been stalking a bounty for extended periods, finding the perfect opportunity to strike. 
---
I‚Äôm with Wyatt.
---
They already give you HP for each level. I dont think more armor is necessary because any meaningful change will just make higher levels more dangerous to lower ones or it will be so meaningless that its not worth having. IMO I think they should track nuke zone times for each character and give you a slowly increasing rad resistance (to represent a growing immunity) for x amount of time spent in nuke zones
---
And all the shiny Metallic faces 
---
(...psss hey guy... Before they patch it out of the game... If you store a destroyed item and place it again it repairs itself)
---
You mean *760*
---
I do not have any melee two handed weapons. Sorry
---
Well you can become my friend, I‚Äôm level 23 and I have 433 caps and some shitty weapons + 6 power armor frames I can‚Äôt use since I‚Äôm to low of a level! I could use a power friend so I can move on and do some missions without being killed all the time 
---
If you picked it up, log out and log back on.
---
Dense is fantastic.  Literally eliminates being blown up by explosive weapons when targeting at close range.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
---
Yeah. I think the "increase the game's length" op just figured MMOs out.   
---
Mind blown.
---
Meh. I actually kind of like the progression cap. 
---
And I‚Äôll tell you why.
---
I play primarily with a friend. 
---
We‚Äôre both adults with full time jobs and he has kids. 
---
Our free time is spurious at best and rarely aligns, but because of the level cap, past 50 regardless of if he‚Äôs had more time or I have in game, our effective level is equal. 
---
I could be 66 and him 52 and he can still out Dps me dependant on perk card selection, not just because I had more time this week to farm white springs. 
---
It means neither one of us is babysitting the other through content, or having to apologise for having had a free weekend to lounge on the PS4.
---
Tbh there's no point tackling just this unless they tackle all of the hilariously easy ways to "exploit" caps. The issue is the same as with most other aspects of the game, a lack of balance. You can sell a legendary metal chest piece for the same price as a mask. you can sell bulk wood and leather for a couple caps each at 15 leather/bulk and 30 wood/bulk, or you can craft a bunch of boards and sell them for a couple times more for that same amount. There are plenty of situations where you craft things that are heavier than the sum of their parts or cost less than their individual parts. Marine tactical masks are just one of many problems, and solving this will be a drop in the rain
---
But yes, I enjoy making hundreds of these a week whenever all the spare legendaries and drugs and junk I find isn't enough to run a vendor dry. Oh, and to prove that people don't get banned for mass crafting
---
GOD I LOVE POWER ARMOR
---
Give a reason to keep on leveling for lvl 200+?
---
time to exploit it before its patched!
---
Because I don't need to sneak with melee. I can one shot them without sneaking.
---
This thread was about comparison right?
---
Op is talking about some scenario where everything goes as planned. I'm saying melee doesn't require any plan or any perks at that. I have one level of incisor and 3 slugger cards. I use faster swing but it's pointless because I one shot everything.
---
There was nothing to pick up, unfortunately. 
---
I datamined some info on the next update that‚Äôll be coming, here‚Äôs what I found;
---
- Reduced fun multiplier from 1.8 to 0.5
---
*DevNote: Players were enjoying the game more than intended. The previous updates did not eliminate all remaining fun aspects of the game*
---
I'm at level 56 at the moment and play 2-3 hours a day, maybe one or two more on weekends. And I read *everything*. I hack every terminal, read every note, every log. And I explore a lot. It's definitely doable. 
---
how do you not take damage without armour?
---
I‚Äôd like to be able to display those low level legendary weapons I‚Äôm still holding onto in some sort of wall mounted weapon rack or display case. Maybe when you look at them it displays the name. 
---
Unless they screwed something up in the last ptch and we're missing something...but otherwise, yeah. Only 1400 caps/20hrs.
---
Don‚Äôt know why flatwoods wasn‚Äôt at launch makes nonsense 
---
It‚Äôs so entirely disheartening!!! I wanted to have high hopes for this game but after the last update the hot fix to patch the problems THEY reintroduced it has bummed me out so badly... I haven‚Äôt logged back in since the day after the hot fix I just feel any bit of fun draining out of it and I regret my decision in buying it digitally simply because now I can‚Äôt hide it from sight on a shelf somewhere I could only delete... but I just don‚Äôt have the heart to delete what I HAD HOPED would be great...
---
well you are kinda playing the game wrong, for you to use demolition expert you have to actually use explosives and explosive weapons not weapons with the explosive affix .
---
Now dense with the nerf as long as you have fireproof rank 3 it doesnt make a huge difference, however, if you dont have the perk I recommend dense
---
That's assuming you did not already have the right perk cards, and that you acquire the right perk cards by leveling up. There are also different ways for acquiring the right perk cards, since they are tradeable.
---
Besides, you are suddenly including perk cards into the equation. Not that that's necessarily wrong, but the OP was just referring to the points only:
---
&gt; *no one in their right mind is just going to level another 50 levels to change all those points* 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thats really pretty!
---
I just play a different game
---
I dunno. I prefer to go around murdering super mutants, collecting caps/gunpowder and selling assault rifles for 45 caps to the closest vendors.
---
If i sat around crafting vendor trash i think I'd be well on my way to quitting this game. 
---
If you're taking about the concrete ramps, I had to put flat concrete foundations in the corners. Once the ramps were in place on each side, I could remove them.
---
Like you said.  The rifle perks , tank killer, tormentor. My vats crit fills up very quickly.  When a melee build runs at me, it is very easy to target a leg, stagger, then target head and use a vats crit. I also have a weapon that has +33% vats accuracy so it is hard to miss . 
---
10/10 Thank you u/misterXCV. Very cool. 
---
Being the economy is garbage anyway, i'm really unsure what the net effect would be from any of the things that "would ruin it". I mean a shit sandwich is still a shit sandwich. I'd just be happy if they actually made some changes to the game that might actually be a bonus to players instead of 10 more things to make it more tedious.
---
Not having quite the similar experience with guns.  But the first part sounds like my cycle.  Hit the vendors, sell, maybe some events on the way (if any spawn), and when the circuit is done if no events are up I'm kind of left hanging.  Maybe mine, craft some ammo, then wrap it up.
---
It doesn't help that I have events that are 2+ months now without appearing (chief among them Queen of the Hunt, Heart of the Enemy) so it's the same 6 events if they are up.
---
Happened to me too...  and was a pita to repair. I put it in storage permanently. 
---
I don't even have water purifiers anymore... Now my toon drinks dirty water like the bloodied mutated goulish freak that he is!
---
üòÇ
---
unpopular opinion: try raiding
---
Yeah it's annoying and lazy.
---
A destroyed anti air turret shouldn't be a vats target. 
---
That's good! And by all means I'm not saying that melee is garbage . It's good, just not as good. üòâ

I'll time it when I get off work.

And here I came hoping it's a Power Armor model which allows you to equip Deathclaw Gauntlet... :(
---
Raiding what? Lol
---
I misread that as Darth Claw and was looking forward to a mix of Darth Vader and a lobster...in power armor.
---
But that aside, this is pretty cool.
---
Devs: You all have ~~phones~~  "hundreds of hours to waste on new characters"  dont you!

  A Scorchbeast takes my Lever Action's .45 and it slowly drains her health, then she lands and my sword kills here quickly.
---
Replaces left hand with level 20 drill. Punching now instead is level 20 drill. -_- just like all the wonderful arm mods for all the other pa
---
100000% agree!
---
Honestly they could do a lot more with diseases, have some that make you really feel like a survivor. 76 bloodworms are way different to Nuka worlds, but imagine if when you contracted them you had a time limit to cure yourself or small worms would start bursting out of you and attacking, each time they burst out they do moderate damage.

But a proper rifle build can take her out before she lands in 4-5 shots.

I did Uranium Fever and got the BOS Jumpsuit, Whitespring Jumpsuit, and Whitepowder Jumpsuit as a reward but I did it atleast 4 times on the same server.

just attacking bases, stash first, the defender will attack you with all his junk on him, kill then and sell it to another player, then buy sentinel assasin armor
---
Just do what they did in that WOW South Park episode and run around killing cattle for XP :)
---
Awesome dude thank you for that 
---
Really stand up thing to do 
---
Really? The game is easy grinding compared to ark.
---
I am not saying you are 100% wrong, but ammo other than for the prime weapons is very easy to obtain. Maybe not until you hit level 40 or 50, but leveling isn't supposed to be easy. I personally have not had a true ammo issue since about level 15 or 20, and even then it was a tertiary weapon I carried to use when my primary and secondary broke, I coukd have a decent weapon to get me back to my camp or a depot to fix them. I am now sitting on mutltiple thousands of all ballistic ammo except .38. I just don't need that mess as I haven't used that caliber since level 5 or 10. 
---
Non-human NPCs and dead NPCs that you interact with through what they left behind are still NPCs. 
---
Thank you.
---
Even with the proper perks, 600 lbs is not enough to hold the proper amount of junk they require, the proper aid they require AND have more than 2-3 weapons with Ammo 
---
Just four times...try around 9 on the same server.
---
I don‚Äôt play grinding games so I‚Äôm not used to it and therefore also don‚Äôt care for it 
---
Thank you
---
That's helpful. I even have the extra search perk on medical containers but I haven't hit up any hospitals lately.  
---
I would craft the hell out of stimpaks if I could find the plan. I'm sure some vendor has it now but I've yet to see a list of where. Seems like it's mostly a random drop than any guaranteed event reward or world spawn. 
---
Just want to let you know, theres a damage scaling bug once you pass 100, i have friends who have crap armor who are lvl 50, while i myself have BOS armor, im lvl 124. Mr Gutsys melt me and barely dent their health. 
---
No...the really rare jumpsuit from events..I linked in earlier comment
---
Well then you should avoid any survival games in the future. 
---
I'm totally into increasing the margin between chumps and champs, but factor in the community, this is fo76, sprinkled with one the most entitled individuals you can interact with, they don't just want a participation trophy, they want the good loot.
---
My suggestion is play along,  drop her health to \~10%  farm the mobs, and watch them struggle to put a dent in what is left of her health. Her loot is no longer worth your time homie, just let them fail\*...They are the ones who want to be able to clear endgame content without working for it, like the chumps that bought tse's and assumed they would be god-tier against the queen.
---
\*If they catch on and leave the area/world, burst her, take the loot and move onto the next one.
---
So....do you still stand by that?
---
I can pinpoint the exact day this happened for me. It was the day they patched the carry weight glitch. Of all yhe things to prioritize. Smh.
---
Wow. That actually makes me upset.
---
I mean I linked it in my earlier comments with a photo, I really can't be more descriptive than imagery. 
---
Thanks for the help
---
Yes my apologies what is your price
---
Hmmmmm
---
I wonder if eliminating weapon/armor durability would help this? ;)
---
Nice. Thanks
---
I'm pretty sure I can't explain it any better. Looks like a mechanic jumpsuit, bos logo on back, and I even linked you a post which had a photo of in top 5 comments. Did you even look at the link...? Really can't describe it better than a photo.
---
I kinda made this system for myself in fo4, made grabbing stuff from storage way easier, only certain things, like building materials, went into the main settlement storage. I would love if they would do something like this here, too. Or even something along the lines of: you can build a chem cooler seperate from your stash, but it only holds Chan's, and only so much(say 100lbs, just for ease, this is just brainstorming) same for other item types. Maybe something that looks like a boombox for your holotapes. 
---
Campfire to extend foundations??? That‚Äôs handy considering how uneven some of the terrain is even on the first floor
---
Saved this because it is interesting, thanks for sharing what you've learned :)
---
Multiple sets of high level armor or like me I have one I am stacking for my next big level so I don‚Äôt have to hunt all the pieces
---
I think it's kind of hilarious that it's one of the few heavily-marketed bundles for xbox one x right now. Bet those are selling like hotcakes.
---
Aaaaaaand you have been banned for exploiting.
---
Yes please!!!
---
Remove weight from aid and deconstructed junk items.
---
Make them stackable! 
---
It's bewildering that a game with a heavy focus on crafting has such a punitive mechanic (Carry Weight / Stash Size)
---
Its an online game. If you don't want online go play Fallout 4. Lol
---
This is close to what i run.  Not really seeing many reasons to refine it as most things die in one shot to the dome.
---
It looks nothing like yours though. I only run marsupial,speed demon, eagle eyes and herbivore.

Same with legendary robots. If i don't loot them asap they fly off and i spend forever looking for them.

This post was everything. 
---
TAKE NOTES BETHESDA. 
---
but theres a wrecking ball perk that let's people do more damage to people's buildings, they wanted some griefers in the game.
---
Lol, killing boars
---
I've got a character for both, dont you worry.
---
Solid info
---
An overwhelming majority of people do not want any form of PvP in this game.  Workshops were designed around PvP.  People don't like it or want it, but there it is.   
---
Frankly, No workshop puts out enough resources to make it worth my time to defend.  You want it, fucking take it.  Just leave my junk for me to pickup and I'll go do something else more productive.  Fighting over a piece of shit workshop is the last thing I have time for on this game.
---
TL;DR: The game design around PvP sucks.  People who want nothing to do with PvP are forced into it, and not just at workshops.  Having your entire camp flattened because someone called in an artillery strike and then got a 20 cap bounty because of it is stupid.   The damage they cause is ridiculous. The cost to repair is ridiculous.  The whole thing sucks from a, "I didn't start this shit" stand point.  I sure as hell ended it by killing that guy and calling in a strike at his camp.   Of course he managed to disconnect a second before it would have blown apart.   Anyway, it didn't matter.  The damage was done.  He lost 20 caps when I killed him. I lost my entire camp.  I realize now that I can move my camp and have it rebuild itself, but that's only good until Bethesda kills that.  Anything that benefits the player too gets nerfed, so I expect they'll remove that feature sooner rather than later.    Meanwhile that dipshit caused so much damage and got away with it for 20 caps.   Fucking stupid.  The whole PvP thing is fucking stupid.
---
Seeing an awesome base like that makes me wish we had a multiplayer STALKER game with a really dangerous game world so we could go back to our coop base and relax, play the guitar, and prep for the next excursion into the zone.
---
You sound exactly like my casual friends that typically play Sims and whatnot. Farming is part of every MMO ever, it just too hard for some people.
---
Hey so idk if your playing on console or pc, but if you on pc feel free to send me a PM or something and i can help ya out. By help you out though i dont mean just give u some items(which i will do btw lol), but i can also help you out with some strats that i personally do in order to grind for specific items. 
---
I honestly believe that if i helped explain how to play the games at lower lvls to make life easier, that it would more than likely help restore a little faith in the game, and may possibly even make it fun again for you to play lol. Its not anything you can instantly learn and put into motion right away btw, as its mainly just small things i think might help ya out. However if your just 100% finished and over the game, I can understand that, and I wish you nothing but the best in your next gaming adventure! :) 
---
If your on PC I can help with stimpaks, I have an abundance of the damn things thanks to the Forbidden Knowledge quest and super duper perk, right now I'm carrying nearly 1000 diluted and regular versions and half that in rad-away. Trillian69 on PC. I'm usually on early mornings and evenings till late. I live on the Twin Lakes near the Investigator's Cabin.
---
Don‚Äôt be a twat, he was wondering if it will make it to the Atom Shop...which I‚Äôm assuming it will, for $25
---
Yep.  Had a corpse disappear last night.   I knew where this particular mob spawned from.  It's corpse showed up back at its spawn point and I was able to loot it.   The scorch beasts that have all disappeared after killing them, well those just flat flippin' disappeared because I'm sure that if the bug is that they return to the spawn point, those things spawn under ground and fly through the ground.   There's probably a crap ton of corpses under the map.  I wish I could turn on no-clipping and go hidden corpse hunting.  
---
Also, this has been happening off and on since Beta.  Not just since the last patch made it worse.
---
Hey i keep getting disconnected when i head into flatwoods. Like over and over and over.
---
^ This 
---
I have made mods since oblivion and the engine is terrible - you can make a thousand work arounds for a handful of problem that are straight up stupidly programmed and could have been easily avoided, just to hit a invisible limit that will make it cave in itself and crash 
---
 Yeah I have never really cared for the Legendary thing. I just sell em'. I make my own stuff largely. 
---
 Did the same thing in ESO. Now fighting is what I like and so I soloed World Bosses. Scorchbeasts are kinda the same so I'm happy to eventually bring her down. Did 3 level 80s at Whitespring yesterday and help did not show up quickly. Radiation is my problem then as my BOS Heavy Combat does not do that well.
---
im at 300 hrs..getting a little bored so turning towards pvp a little
---
If you don't like anyone else's thoughts or opinions on how something else was implemented go play with yourself offline.
---
Yeah I never understood the logic of that perk. We don‚Äôt want griefing in the game.
---
We know it will happen so put in place systems to mitigate it.
---
But wait here‚Äôs a perk that gives you added damage to other players camps if you want to grief ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the mobile app playing up. But I don‚Äôt see a single post under your initial subject or in the original subject that contains a link to any image. 
---
That said given the number of other replies to this post all saying the same as me, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs the app playing up. I think you may have posted your image in an entirely separate thread or on another post. But yes now father it‚Äôs a mechanic style boiler suit with a bos logo on the back. Never seen it, so best of luck with locating it.
---
No lol
---
Much of this is intentional on Bethesda's part and I really hate that they think this is somehow fair, fun, or reasonable because it is really f-ing ridiculous.
---
Bethesda should make this lore for several reasons. The enclave did many experiments with deathclaws making them intelligent on the west coast and controlling them on the east coast. And it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time making a non human variant of power armor since they did that with frank horrigan.
---
Hmmm, I gave up on it after it stopped spawning any plans for me (this was after a few attempts, and I never picked up the plans I did see). 
---
Maybe I'll give it another try.
---
Huh, I've noticed that periodically resource generators will get "bugged" and stop creating any new resources. Re-logging definitely seems to fix it. I had never tried though to actually look at the inventory when this happens.  
---
I've also seen it with water purifiers that should have something but don't. Seems like eventually they all come around though so I never thought much of it.
---
I‚Äôm all for a little bit more of a challenge, it brings back a bit of that bittersweet fear that you‚Äôre about to get neck deep in something you don‚Äôt wanna be in....that being said, the nerf was a bit extreme, I lost almost 1000 damage on my most powerful weapon over night (which I only broke out for the Queen)
---
some people like it, theres even a story quest about becoming a raider, they get the bad end of the deal usually since the attacker gets the first hit on them fir being wanted
---
Heh. Someone obviously have not played DayZ Epoch, Rust etc etc.
---
Thought that perk only effected workshops.
---
You can attach a wire through the internal hookup and it magically goes through to the exterior hookup. At least that‚Äôs what happened in my base. 
---
CAMPS should be off limits and safe zones. I think the only PVP action should fall under taking/defending Workshops
---
Haven't they nerfed enough shit already? GAWD
---
I understand that. But not so much the build as in a legendary rifle. But build as in the perks.  Even with a non legendary rifle I would say it's just as easy to take a SB down. 
---
How did yours survive? I have a proper rifle build myself and my god Gauss went from 1500 damage to 455 overnight with the nerf....
---
The only quest that i have done was the ultracite power armor suit, what events did you get them from
---
Why did you destroy his base though? Just to be a prick?
---
I keep reading posts about this very subject and I've seen them downvoted or basically ignored. It's really strange that an entire part of the games design work, so much armor that is unique looking is basically useless. It's almost sad.
---
Honestly, all they need to do is make some enemies armored, and some not.
---
Give scorched 3 times more health and no armor, suddenly the minigun shreds through them, while big hitters take longer to kill.
---
There is no reason for every single enemy in the game to have heavy armor.
---
This system has many simillarities to New Vegas' armor system, low damage per shot struggles against anything with even a little bit of armor, but you had low health enemies with lots of armor, and high health enemies with no armor. Cazadors, the scourge of the desert had no armor, not even the legendary or the fearsom specimen 73, no armor whatsoever, 0, yet were still terrifying threats in the end game, and you really wanted a dps bullet hose firing hollow points to put them down fast. It's like if New Vagas put 15 extra armor on every enemy, suddenly most of the guns and ammo diversity of the game goes away, hollow points become worthless, every gun needs armor piercing ammo or bust, and the anti matteriel rifle becomes completely mandatory for dealing with most threats whose armor now crawls up into the 25-50 range requiring that full 110 base damage.
---
What about the infiltrators, did they think about that, no. Lol
---
Storing is just for I don‚Äôt want that dumb power armor card right nw because I don‚Äôt use any power armor, or I don‚Äôt want the level 4 of adrenaline, as I decided to just have the 3 equipped at all times or swap with marathoner when I‚Äôm slow traveling. 
---
Not having duplicating ever is just common sense for a ui talent system, since there is literally NO functionality for two of the same card. You can‚Äôt equip them both, so why is it even in the UI?
---
Combining is redundant. Just choosing it again should award level 2. Third pick, level 3. Pack or deliberate. 
---
Agreed, It's so easy to lose my carrots and other small crops in the tall weeds.
---
What quests give you power armor?
---
You are solid. ;)
---
For ranged weapons I'd like to know which combination of various perks is going to give us the highest damage.  Like Commando or Rifleman, take all 3 points in each level or 3 in some, but only 2 in one?  Concentrated Fire 3 or 2?  Etc. Etc.
---
No idea at this point. 
---
So basically, your argument is because you could theoretically beat a brain-damaged melee user in pvp, this applies to combat with any other melee user as well? 
---
I have never invested a single perk into melee, but this post is beyond delusional. The raw damage figures don't lie
---
all in one drop ? 
---
 I was just experimenting. BOS Heavy Combat Armor with a Dense Chest and Strengthened Limbs and I was putting 40mm into the wall in front of me and the floor below me and suffered no damage. None. 
---
 My new melee weapon I think, my M79. ;)
---
chassis weigh 10 not 0 weight
---
This isn't like previous fallouts though. You can always farm what you need pretty easy. No need to hoard. Just have to learn the best places on the map to find everything. If you don't immediately need those mats for an upgrade or repair then let it go.
---
Water farming is still pretty lucrative in this game, though not like it was in fo4. I could see them wanting to limit it. Anything they can do to make the player suffer :)
---
I'm totally baffled though that it actually works that way.
---
But is it proper  ? It isn't just the rifleman perks , or the now useless demolition perk that make up a rifle build.   Sneak attacks can add 2.5x damage , vats crit can add 40% damage. Bloody mess, tormentor..there's so many ways to increase damage, but so many people overlook it because of the anger over the TSE nerfs. 
---
I run that event a lot and have never gotten accessories as a reward. Might have to keep trying.
---
If you win one from a quest or event and never deploy it, it weighs zero. 
---
They are weak on the antennas. Shotguns, pulse weapons and melee are the counter.
---
You're not wrong. I'd love to play a fully operational version, with everything being smooth and more difficulty in combat. 
---
I made a melee class because I have never done one in fallout before. Unarmed to be specific, and I used my fists until I found a mole gaultlet. I can't even begin to describe how easy it is now that I have the best of the best gauntlets. I survive queen fights pretty damned easily,even with a broken hazmst suit
---
Unyielding is helpful for the stat bonus to carry weight, but there are other benefits like perception and luck rolls I presume.  Assassin is cool for PvP and is a main effect, but sentinel is a minor effect so not mutually exclusive to Bolstering or Unyielding.
---
Yeah I've gotten it on 2 of my characters
---
Could be, depends on timing. The limited capacity but relatively high production rate means there's a good chance anything stolen is going to regen before you come back to miss it.
---
And this isn't any of those games, either.
---
I would be interested in a hard mode server
---
Good to know other people know how to really play a game! (Just kidding you play however you want. don't murder me)
---
Top shelf in the vet room, ranger hq in the bog
---
Wish that worked. Two support tickets, two posts in the official forums, post in this sub on the issue thread and about 10 tweets, and not one peep.
---
I thought it was Vanguard's that triggered at high HP and Bolstering at low. But I don't use either, so I could be wrong.
---
Why padded? Can you tell me more??
---
I never could get into RDR2, it felt like 15 actual minutes of ride time for a cutscene, with random bullshit on the side and fights not happening very often.
---
It‚Äôs FO76 silly goose, you should have known it‚Äôs broken
---
That's actually a good idea thanks lol
---
What quest or event awards a chassis, I've finished every quest and done nearly all the events multiple times in my 600 hours of play and have never received one.
---
‚ÄúBought off eBay‚Äù. Hah, that‚Äôs pathetic. Even more pathetic than this pointless brag post
---
Too bad there isn't a Glass Bones mutation and then you can simulate breaking a hip after walking three feet.
---
Not quite.  
---
There are so many factors to this  . The main one being the sheer range of a rifle. Melee cannot bridge the distance that a rifle can shoot.
---
 Melee cannot hide and wait undetected while picking off enemies. 
---
The raw damage of melee doesnt matter if they can be shot 5 times before reaching their target. 
---
I'm on xbox, but thanks for the offer
---
no problem!
---
How about instead of a jet pack there‚Äôs climbing gear. AP drains as you hang from or scale buildings and mountains?
---
darn nice. and those are drops of the item or the plans ?
---
You can either hope for it to glitch or use the through wall conduit and attach a small 1 sided conduit on the insideem then connect the wires from the outside to the conduit coming out of wall if ur on xb1 i can show u
---
Those two spawns will be glorious hellholes.
---
That's a very good point. It works for single player, but with Fo76's netcode and servers, it really would result in dying /a lot/ from absolute bullshit.
---
Both of my TSE were nerfed to laughable levels as well .... my Gauss went from 1500 damage to 450 (with a proper rifleman/explosive build)
---
It doesn't show up as a reward but I was just checking to see what Legendaries I've gotten and it was just in my inventory 
---
Hey man I have run into the same issue since the patch. I bought a vats lever and rely on crits now and it‚Äôs definitely doable. I had to move a few points but I run 14 perception 15 agility and 15 luck and just crit everything. I have a bloodied lever on back up just in case I need the extra damage I just hate the bloodied build so I only use that when shit hits the fan. Try that and see if it‚Äôs effective. 
---
Padded's just what you use if you can't find Dense. I'm not sure on the exact mechanics, but they both have a large damage reduction on explosive attacks.
---
I just dont understand why hamstringing one side and compare it to another makes much sense.
---
I one shot my way thru west tek with vats. And that's without a legendary effect that doubles my damage.
---
Actually i should get an instigating rifle so i can make comparisons from a biased position.
---
That sounds decent. Instead of being mostly stationary while firing you could keeping leading the many, many melee enemies back while lining them up. Nice
---
For me it'd probably be anti-armour, explosive and weightless. I'd Marsupial jump on the nearest building and fire down to let the splash damage take full effect on the ground with inevitable misses
---
I think there‚Äôs a difference between RP as a raider and griefing.
---
The former is all about flair and crazy costume choices. I get that.
---
Grinding weaker players and griefing them is way different. 
---
They may not be. I will try putting all junk in my stash when I get on later and see if that sorts it. Thanks.
---
 I can lever in a couple more Rifle perks but not many. You still gonna have to shoot her a lot at anything under 3 or 4 hundred which you ain't getting from any stock piece. The Sword I have ignores Armor and she don't like that as she has a lot.
---
They are the items 
---
They should have just stuck to single player games. That‚Äôs what they know &amp; what they‚Äôre good at and the whole reason ppl even like FO or TES in the first place.
---
You can either use a through wall power conduit to wire it to the other side otherwise something the wire just goes through it automatically anyway but that really depends where the switch you are wiring it to is located.
---
It does work a  it weird with two switches though as they both need to be off to close the door (use first switch to open door from the outside and you walk in the you turn the switch on from the inside then the door will still stays open). The floor switches works better for this as sends power to the door temporarily and shuts it behind you.
---
The keypad switch is stupid as the switch on it totally denotes the point of the keypad. The only keypad I have see work like they are supposed to is the ones on the Powered door with keypad (powered gates plan).
---
Yes, yes, yes and no (only on the sneak, which isn‚Äôt perked more than 1*, but I always try to get that first sneak shot in every fight)
---
I‚Äôve never been able to find the Flatwoods Monster. 
---
theres people out there who just dress up as raiders and that's it?
---
So you're pro at clearing the outside of West Tek? Cool build man.
---
There‚Äôs a hundred ways to play this game. My way is fun for me, someone else will be totally different. As long as everybody‚Äôs having a good time with it it‚Äôs all good with me. 
---
You can 2 shot off their arms and even knock off their eyeballs.
---
well if that's the case, that's cool... I've never won one, I'm not that cool
---
I think it depends on which .50 cal rifle. If you are talking about the big ass Barrett M82 .50 caliber sniper rifle, depending on the scope, barrel length and other load out possibilities, you are talking 29.7 to 30.9 pounds. That doesn't include the exta ammo. My .308 Winchester 770 with composite stock and magazine to only hold 5 rounds with my bipod and 16x9 scope weighs in at about 13 pounds. When having to stalk hunt in the mountains, or even hills, I can tell you that the only other weapon I carry is my .357 magnum for point protection against a snakes or any other potentially deadly wildlife and I do not have my rifle at the ready. Forget about carrying a minigun system, even if using the micro-minigun that shoots 5.56 ammo, you are looking at a two man team each carrying 42 pounds of gear to set upand make it work. The gun itself without the battery or ammo is like 27 pounds. The battery pack is another 8 pounds. Then factor in the ammo belts or drums and trying to stand and fire that kind of system you are looking at about another 20 pounds for the 1000 round drums. So trying to stand, somewhat aim from the hip, and be able to sustain even a 3 second burst is basically impossible. These types of guns have to be on a mount of some sort. 
---
Because sneak and VATS criticals Don't matter on my melee build. I can one shot without any sneak or vats perks which means I can put those card slots elsewhere.
---
Melee is King OP.
---
Sucks you can't sell or scrap PA. I have like 6 sets of PA frames and they take a ton of space in the Stash. 
---
I put a switch box on the outside and a terminal inside, you can control all your switches from the terminal at once turning them on or off. Alternatively you could use a terminal outside and lock it and then a switch inside and the wire will jump through the wall to the garage's connector, just don't connect the terminal to the door, connect it to a pass through conduit.
---
Could get behind this idea as well. With a potential of com ere bitch momentsüòâ
---
Rose gave me a full set of raider armor and the bos quest gave me a set of ultracite
---
Full Raider Armor you get from doing Rose's Raider missions. The Ultracite Armor you get from doing the BOS missions.
---
That would imply that I stood by it in the first place. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand why pvp includes camp destruction. Pvp means player character fights player character. Destroying a building isn‚Äôt pvp. It should be taken out of the game, period.
---
Dont use it during a nuke please.
---
If you're using an anti armor sword , why not use an anti armor rifle  ? Still with sneak, vats crits, bloody mess, tormentor. .the damage output is there and available. 
---
If you build your camp on the cliff below the lighthouse, the toads will come swarm you every time the event is up (which for me was pretty often). You can kill them easily that way, especially if you have turrets, then run the stuff up to finish the events. Easy xp for kills and easy xp buff for the next hour.
---
Also has the added bonus of giving you a crapload of meat for toad nuggies. :3 
---
Don't worry, there won't be many people playing anymore anyway. 
---
Just an example.  It applies to all locations , even whitesprings.

I usually hit up flat woods. Wind chimes at the house across from the hotel. Aluminum cans are in the gas station with a couple cans on the roof
---
Bloodied stealth build. Lvl 68 super muties dead in 1 shot
---
Who run barter town?
---
You can't barter because the vendor does not acquire all the caps you spend, only 1/4 I think
---
I lovvveee a challenge, when it's fair. I want to be able to die in 3 shots, but the same should be set for any human NPCs, make it realistic. Not this bullet sponge bullshit
---
Np thank you
---
I pretty much feel the same way. I've been grinding to find more 90% weight reduced weapons to replace my current inventory. Also, I'm struggling to find the remaining Ultra-light armor plans to be able to reduce the weight of the armor I have in my inventory. The latest idea I had to extract more from the game was to come up with a hero to role-play as but given the limitations it's rather challenging. I've had quite a bit of fun with my Jason Vorhees role-playing though.
---
Apex Legends just came out today and it's free. Pretty damn fun too. Gonna fuck around with that for a while.
---
The antique store can spawn them when you walk in the door counter side door, then  look on the shelves that are right inside the door.
---
Try maxing out the sneak perk to 75% harder to detect.    And the one that let's you sneak to lose enemies. And maybe get a piece of chameleon armor. I have those and I'm hidden like 80% of the time. 
---
Agree completely, if you‚Äôre like me and do 80-90% of your gameplay wandering around blowing up monsters, the nerf really screwed up my fun....
---
I have had no issue with the stash size or being short of materials, had to learn to let go of stuff like unique but useless weapons and armour unlike FO4 where I hoarded every unique item in the game to put on display in my museum. My stash is just materials, 0.10 weight outfits, some meds and bobbleheads and a few event specific weapons
---
Griefers don't want fair PvP, they want to show how tuff they are by fucking up someone else's day, only way to stop it is remove PvP all together out of adventure mode, that will mean the only place they can try their bullshit is in survival with all the ppl that pvp, they will get their ass handed to them and quit.
---
I‚Äôll see what that‚Äôs like, thanks!
---
Not everyone wants to use that perk for their build. Isn't this supposed to be a game that allows options and choices? 
---
Today was finally the day I purchased Red Dead Redemption 2.
---
I find that to be part of the problem as well, thanks, i somehow forgot to mention that
---
I would need about 2000lbs of storage plus at least 600lb on my person to be able to play the game the way I want and enjoy it. 
---
I would start playing again if we had 1000lbs storage though. 
---
Can't play at all with the current state of things and it sucks. 
---
I'm on psn: extremelylost 
---
This. I have about 100 people added on discord. Just about everyone played prepatch. Now none play.  
---
I admit I do this sometimes. I have a raider outfit and go around trying to extort other players.
---
Jump on the mic and tell them to hand over all their springs.
---
Most people laugh and we have a good chat. Some respond with that don‚Äôt have any, then I give them some.
---
I don‚Äôt pick fights. But have enjoyed the occasional person who plays along and attacks first cause they get it. I‚Äôm role playing. 
---
If he‚Äôs killing enemies with 5 shots with a minigun then that‚Äôs pretty good. Problem is he doesn‚Äôt even mention what weapon. And in most cases what‚Äôs wrong with it taking 5 hits to kill an enemy? 
---
I was playing on my level 14 alt earlier today at Camp McClintock when some level 10 with a double barreled shotgun and a machete kept attacking me. I finally turned around and hit him with my 10mm smg, but because I am in pacifist mode, I don't hurt him. Yet he can keep slapping me around making me use stimpacks or food to heal, something is definitely wrong with this arrangement. If a person is in pacifist mode, they shouldn't be able to be hurt by other people. The pvp in this game needs to be shut down until they can figure out a way to balance it and make it so that people playing pve are not menaced by pvp griefers. 
---
No you are :)
---
Huh. I thought this was the GTA online subreddit. See, [I had just posted a comment on someone's thing saying to just spend 100k on their nightclub to keep getting their popularity up with the nightclub.](https://old.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/an8ax8/dear_rockstar/efrh1tp/). Kind of thought you were responding to that.
---
As for FO76, Yes, yes I do still stand by it and I do want to support bethesda. Rockstar can eat my ass though.
---
ya i backed out just in case it was a death glitch
---
kinda dont trust Beth anymore
---
reboot cleared it
---
There's a video somewhere on here of a guy soloing  the SBQ with a simple auto combat rifle. He does it easily. And after that,  he takes a normal SB out of the sky in like 2 seconds. I'd have to search for it. 
---
They are not a gas.
---
I have been there and he's had one plan sometimes he's got several. 
---
I also got mine at the bunker
---
Lol..  c'mon, there's no glitches or bugs in this game! It can't possibly have something broken!
---
In case no-one has replied with the answer yet. The logo on the Knee is the Garrahan mining logo.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one thought the nerf was too nerfing. Bethesda keeps making these huge swings instead of little corrections.
---
I generally think the people posting things along this line (not you but the deliberately misleading) are trolling for the fun of it, it's kind of insane..  
---
  
---
5 minutes in Xedit shows it doesn't work
---
I heard a guy named Johann Hari on Sam Harris's podcast recently that made a lot of sense about depression and alternate treatments. His book is called *Lost Connections*. I haven't read it yet, but i mean to. Anyway, it might be worth checking out if you're into podcasts at all.

---
So running through a cramped interior full of super mutants is better using your build with a hunting rifle that takes 2+ seconds between shots than it is one shotting everything as you sprint through with melee? 
---
Don‚Äôt forget radicool and nerd rage perks üëç
---
That's where I got mine.
---
So I could listen instead of read?
---
Everyone play differently. It's a fundamental game flaw. Those people have probably successfully leveled up a few times doing that. It passes off the people actually trying to beat her but the fight is so pointless and broken anyways who cares. It'll be months before more bosses are added so grind away. It's all the endgame you have so get used to it. 
---
You require an instigating melee weapon to one shot anything.
---
Btw my vats rifle build doesn't need melee or instigating to 1 shot things.
---
Hate the fact that in order to switch specs I either need to ...
---
1. Create a new character because it's faster to get to the end-game build or
---
2.  Farm for hours to get to get higher levels in order to obtain the cards required for a particular build
---
Ehhhh, can't be bothered anymore. Not when the newer games are coming out like Anthem, Division 2 etc etc
---
Why would you bother getting your hopes up?
---
So far from server hoping, they have been the same every time
---
Yes. However  I dont run, I crouch. Generally always undetected. Also note, I sometimes switch from my hunting rifle, to my handmade for close quarters.  
---
ITS GRA'AHM
---
The game is fine. Many people enjoy playing it. Not everyone is wrapped up in bugs or issues. We enjoy playing the game even as a work in progress. 
---
Alright thx, I‚Äôll keep looking
---
What‚Äôs going to suck more is if they finally open vaults and nobody‚Äôs around anymore to play. 
---
I'm glad you're having fun. but that ruins the whole purpose for me, I did something similar though, give me all your gears and I wont have to kill you, he shoots me and I 1 shot him.
---
so how would you compare its effectiveness compared to fireproof? I wanted to use dense instead of rank 3 of fireproof.
---
People keep claiming the slap damage is insignificant and "can't kill", but as a level 317 in PA went through 58 Stimpacks lastnight from the slap damage they were inflicting, Not only can it kill, it adds up really fast
---
Vendor bots don't barter and there is no demand for the trash we supply them.
---
Feel your pain. PvP generally sucks and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near peaceful players.
---
No, no everyone else is tired of the game being made capital letters harder.  
---
It's not being made capital letters harder.  
---
   
---
It's being made capital letters different.   
---
A game following a major, active post-launch development model will \*\*change over time\*\*.   
---
And what that means is that as things change, some things will become easier, while other things will become harder.  
---
Tracking known plans became \*\*easier\*\*. Carrying bobby pins became \*\*easier\*\*. Getting a decent run out of your guns and armor became \*\*easier\*\* with the fixes applied to the over-conditioning perks (fix it good and weapon artisan).   
---
Some things became harder and there's a good chance they're either a glitch, or community feedback will swing them the other way, like the increased need of food and water, or the damage nerf on things like the auto grenade launcher and missile launcher.   
---
Some things will stay harder, like playing the game in god-mode using a TSE god-mode magic wand. That used to be easy, and will now no longer be easy.   
---
And what all this is telling you is that the game will continue to evolve. And you if you're hell-bent on not evolving with it and its balance ebbs and flows, insisting on playing it in a way that used to be easy at some arbitrary point of time in the past, then yes, it'll be capital letters harder.   
---
I want to add here that this is a reaction many players new to Creation engine titles are exhibiting. These titles don't tell you all the rules of the game in the tutorial. They just give you enough to get going. A lot of the game mechanics you learn deeper into the game. A lot only unlock with perks or via in-world interaction. A lot you have to discover. This was the case with Fallout 4 and Skyrim. In Fallout 76, not only do you have to discover them, but they also evolve and change over time. It's an inherent part of the MMO deal. 
---
Lmao Lawd, I hope not....
---
Found the first team from my country farming nuked Whitesprings today, had this issue for like an hour. Some bodies randomly spawned the items. Then the server crashed
---
I think it's pretty obvious he isn't talking about a mini gun...
---
I agree 5 hits isn't bad, but when it's a lvl 5 mob and you are lvl 30 you should be able to make quick work of them. I have a basic lvl 5 fire axe and I have to chop down 3 or 4 super mutants every time I log jn cause they like to dick around with my camp. I kill them in one strong swig and 2 normal swings. I have 2 perks in he 2 handed perk but I have zero perks in rifles and can kill a lvl 5 in 2 headshots. I am lvl 7 on this toon.
---
This guy's sucks.
---
Dude I turned on Hunter Hunted Radio on fucking accident and it found a match almost right away.  I stopped following the quest but I guess once your in your in, then some level 17 was trying to snipe me..  psh cute.  Luckily he was the only person that tried to come after me because it could have been someone 2-3 times my level.  That being said, people that are farming workbench are there to farm resources, not for PVP, they should understand that there are a limited amount of workbenches, and on top of that there are certain workbenches that farm much better resources.  I was farming posidon for powercores and lead when a level 106 came up and contested my ass (I'm level 43), luckily I had been there for a couple hours and farmed plenty, so I ran and fast traveled away, I just let him have it.  If you're not too into it and get contested, just jump to a different server, it can be a pain in the ass but its what you have to do if you don't want to PVP.
---
It's not enough. I have this "must have" weapon or 2, my stored junk, my work-in-progress power armors, my unwanteds to sell, extra food/water, chems to sell off, and it's almost always at 600, or super-close. 
---
Idk but this is the second time I've gotten it on 2 different characters so maybe I got lucky? And they were both after Uranium Fever 
---
Looking for one on xbox. Have had no luck with events :(
---
Hell yeah it will kill, and honestly it doesn't take very long so if you ignore it, you can be in trouble, especially if you are carrying a lot of junk mats. 
---
Happens to me I think it‚Äôs the game showing how much damage if modded with perks idk it‚Äôs a glitch tho 
---
What do you consider griefing? I'm a higher level so I have never experienced it. I'm curious because I see people complain about griefing a lot but I never experienced it.
---
I saw that paint mod, I keep hoping at some point Fall turns into Winter in a DLC 
---
This is a big reason I don't play the game, sadly. 
---
Got into a respectful argument with a guy making this complaint about enemies being sponges when the game first released - while he was being downvoted to hell for it.
---
I was playing a crit headshot build with pistols and used to pistols being somewhat low damage so I disagreed.
---
He was totally right though and I came to realize it in the weeks that passed. Enemies in this game are absurd bullet sponges and many weapons are trivial damage dealers.
---
On the other end, players tankiness vatrries wildly - enemies, both damage out and in are very unbalanced.
---
I just hop on my mic, tell them to quit bein a Twat. Usually does the trick, years of smoking and an already deep voice, i can make it work for me when I need.
---
it's not just you.
---
in their latest update, Bethesda reaffirmed that they are still crunching numbers to determine what an appropriate limit would be that would not cause issues in the game.
---
Colorful Forest almost certainly has to be those neon pink groves in the Bog, right? (Not that I believe any of that bullshit thread) 
---
A perked out, modded out pistol is still a squirt gun.
---
Or future DLC....my guess is there‚Äôs more to that space station than a couple space suits 
---
Master blaster runs barter town 
---
It‚Äôs almost like they shoehorned pvp into a single player series for no reason and long time players have no interest in it. 
---
My 76 loop is basically build a camp, level (explore or farm workshops for more plans), rebuild and optimize the camp,  create a new character when I have a new build idea, and occasionally do quest content or events. Once I finally find a full set of 60 PA I'll probably dabble in blast zones too.
---
So basically, building is a huge motivator for me.
---
I'll probably slow down a bit before long, but once mods are released this might be a core game for me for a few years. FO4 mods added in some amazing decor and unlocked great features. 
---
I‚Äôm level 60 with crafted weapons. No legendary items. I do not see the problem these people are having aside from the few clearly powerful enemies like scorchbeasts and queens. 
---
People crying that this game needs to get easier pains me. 
---
There is no plan for Buffout or Med-X. 
---
lol listen to yourself man. Yes, you creep through West Tek doing sneak shots faster than a dude sprinting through one hitting with melee. Just stop man. 
---
Tesla rifle is best for tagging mobs in a nuke zone without erasing them, that way everyone can get them tagged. Then once everyone has had a while to get it all tagged you switch over to your real weapons and finish the job. Unless there are many people in your group in which case you dont even need to switch, the mobs will die from massive amounts of meager damage in a group.
---
Are u serious? How do u know this?
---
No idea I'm not from the states
---
Where do I apply to be one of those professional playtesters?
---
Datamined the ESM for all recipes and plans.
---
Wait whatever happened to player vending? I thought Bethesda announced it two or three inside the vaults ago?
---
Mayor for a Day, All Rise...spend the next 3-4 level ups on Melee cards (if you don‚Äôt have them already), go to Dire Chemical, harvest the strangler blooms to make Rad Shield (use Chemist perk for double), pop a Psycho and wait for that sum bitch to land....
---
&gt; you generally are suppose to avoid enemy encounters in most survival games
---
*glances at scorchbeast attacks penetrating buildings*
---
...oh
---
Tedious is the right word. EVE and WoW have grinding right because it's challenging due to game mechanics, not just because the enemies have armor and hitpoints to whittle through.
---
I worry that's what the vaults are going to be - just more of the same.
---
If people quit because the patch reintroduced old bugs, that's one thing. If they quit over the TSE nerf, that's another entirely. 
---
underrated comment
---
Solutions:
---
1. move away from popular nuke area.
---
2. hide ur decontamination arch and use a switch to turn it off when not in use.
---
3. server hop if u anticipate a griefer and u r low on repair mats. Cuz once a griefer griefs... ur base is always the first thing to take the hit.
---
4. crouch when u r flying to ur base for a quick visit, esp. if u stirred up shit with another player. 
---
5. DON'T BUILD NEAR WHITESPRING OR CHARLESTON STAION. Both r popular locations for being griefed. Whitespring cuz players get irritated by the turrets stealing kills and charleston station has a secret vendor that doesn't spawn if there is a camp.
---
Wow that is weird and annoying. Also y do all these people keep telling me they have it and someone is offering to sell one to me? Hopefully they are not confused with bufftats 
---
The thing you have to understand about ballistic fiber is I believe it may very well be the most uncommon scrap component in the game.  If not the rarest, it's certainly up there.
---
Generally, other more coveted materials like springs, at the very least have around 6 or more different junk items that contain a spring of two. Ballistic fiber is unique in that there are only 3 junk  items that are the source of this component.  
---
Military ammo bags, military grade duct tape, and torn mothman wing. 2, 2, and 1 yields respectively.
---
Basically, the only way you're getting ballistic fiber is if you're lucky and searching random tool containers and duct tape is inside.  Or you find military ammo bags in various spots around the world that anybody can grab before you.  Mothman is uncommon, and the only other source of ballistic fiber would be buying it from vendors for I think like 400ish caps without many perks?
---
No, I'm not sure if there is an audiobook. They are just discussing the book on that episode. You could listen to the author talk about it and judge for yourself if the book sounds like something that might be helpful or not.
---
yep, i think they broke it. i get the same fluxuations 
---
Bingo... this comment didn't really warrant a bingo, but the two other top comments had it so I didn't want you to feel left out.
---
Are you kidding? someone in their balance team has a raging hard on for melee why else would it be so overpowered now?
---
The creatures won't kill you, the diet will.
---
Still waiting 3 minutes for SBQ (really any legendary in a NZ) to load their loot....all the while, wasting chems to stand there like a derpin 
---
Preciate it homie lol
---
I think it was a combo of both.  Most didn't really want to play melee and the patch made guns a little less viable. The reintroduced bugs was just icing. I see a lot of them playing fallout 4
---
It's not you. It's still not enough.
---
Move your camp over 10 feet and it all gets repaired. Really cheap that way.
---
Unfortunately I have redone the training like 5 times now with the same results. 
---
It is kind of annoying having to carry three different weapons to avoid dealing with them breaking though. Especially when weapons weigh way more than they should realistically. 
---
Do you only have the one 150 toon? Because what I did when I started getting bored was to make characters from "weak" builds (heavy weapons and pistols) into viable late game monsters. Both are totally possible and you don't need to have special guns either.
---
At least on Xbox, everyone just uses Xbox Group Chat to talk to their teammates....I agree with you though, I‚Äôd like more proximity chat, nobody does it. I‚Äôve only came across it one time in nearly 300 hrs of screen time and it was a team, expert level role playing a military unit in Watoga, it was freakin cool
---
In the other fallout games, it was a 1:1 ratio, and you could lump sum barter. I wish this current system were never in place, why did they try to fix something that wasnt broken?
---
 Robots, if you try to come back with "because the robots can't do something like that," I'm calling bullshit, look at all the other complicated tasks performed by them in game, a running balance is not gonna break their processors.
---
 Itll break the economy? Already been done. By the system in place. Oh, and the cheaters who actually did something about it for themselves.(good for you, finding a solution, but i still hate that you did it, i just prefer not to do that shit)
---
I have not only met him, he gave me some shooting pointers and a demonstration (ran into him at the company range on my birthday).  Was a Long time ago (10ish years), but one of the best birthday surprises.  His sense of humor is awesome.
---
I haven‚Äôt personally experienced it either as a high level player. Haven‚Äôt had my camp attacked or damaged. 
---
Have had people attack me repeatedly to goad me into PvP but you can ignore and or avoid them pretty easily. 
---
The way I understand it from what I have read, it‚Äôs the low level players that are killed whilst in pacifist mode and don‚Äôt have the gear or skills to be able to fight back and defend themselves. 
---
They get killed repeatedly and have their camp leveled whilst they watch. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any, but if the wounding prefix still exists then that‚Äôd probably wreck face. 
---
You're about to hit that point. The point where it is no longer fun. Maybe it will be fixed up in a few months time. Better off spending your time on a well polished game that doesn't give you a headache. 
---
But players do lol 
---
No I have a lvl 87 that is pistol build but there is still a repeated process with nothing new to be offered
---
I was waiting for someone to complain about this lmao. Can't please everyone.
---
Are you saying that 400 rounds of 5mm bullets from a mini gun should kill stuff....that's just crazy take mate.
---
We all know people never die unless they get him by 15 to 30 bullets from a 10 mm pistol.
---
Absolutely stupid just how many bullets are needed to take stuff down. Even when struck with a full powered gauss rifle to the head with all rifleman and DPS perks.
---
A terminal you say ...now that plan would be on enclave bunker ?
---
Yes this 
---
is this satire? 
---
Bigger stash yes, maybe separate weight for stored armor and weapon and separate for junk. I do tend to have more junk though than anything alse. Time to time im just bulking it and sell to vendors.
---
Why don't you record some gameplay video to show everyone how your build works in PvE/PvP? It's really easy to do on PS4.
---
It's a sign of inexperienced leadership.  More so a lack of experience with online games.
---
im pretty sure you can shoot through foundations.
---
He was saying armor penetration on energy weapons is broken (doesn't work), I think you misunderstood.
---
It is a glorious time, enjoy the scenery, enjoy the soundtrack....DO NOT RUSH. Upgrade a hunting rifle as soon as you can, a .308 Rifle for me through my first 35 levels fairly well. Don‚Äôt overstep your level and go adventuring the higher level areas of the map. 
---
Yes. I would like to believe it's a bug, but it may be a balance change. It should at least warn it does not stack if it's for balance.
---
I think every rare mob experience i had, has given me an amazing story or experience i could recite to you. Loot however hasn't been good since the unique items  fallout3/vegas  provided. So i was prepared for the letdown. It cheapens the explore value, every buildings bones i pick clean and everything i kill. Randomly generated stat loot is like a  dirty gas station with a slot machine.
---
Faster ? Maybe , maybe not. Safer, easier, and more op?  yes. Faster isn't always better. 
---
I did. sorry and thanks. i did not know this. I have been using a laser rifle. damage seems lacking but i assumed it was because of the high fire rate.
---
Is it known by the devs?
---
I just want to be able to rename my power armors finally, that overlook is mind blowing 
---
dude yes. all of my stuff breaks at least twice if i'm playing normally for half an hour. i dont have the space to pick up junk so if my shit breaks i'm weaponless and weak until i get the insane amount of random items it takes to repair 5 different weapons just for it to happen all again in minutes. so sick of it
---
Yah it‚Äôs almost like those Gutsy were made of military grade hardware designed for heavy frontline combat.
---
7 Reasons why now is the time to get back into Fallout 76! ‚Äî The Verge, probably.
---
Is it a legendary perk or something? 
---
Terminal only changes colour of my lightboxes :/
---
I'm going to try invisible pressure plates tomorrow. Found a way üëç
---
for 2050 caps
---
Never really thought about it. This was an off the fly post while bored at the factory job, triggered by all these people bitching about tse nerfs and the game being too hard. But I can and will do that for science. 
---
If you have adrenaline perk...it could be that too...switching on and off
---
And every online game is bound to have griefers, even on a kids game, a racing game whatever you want. If it's online there's a high probability of people griefing, if you can't deal with it then you should just not play? There aren't set rules on griefing, player chooses to do it and he gets less penalty than you? Of course.
---
You could run around in rust or epoch and level someones base and all you lose could be a few C4s, or rockets but they have to build their base from ground up. And you don't even get blueprints for that or choose to repair. It's how MMO survival games are like. You've really just got to learn how to deal with it instead of whining. I got my whole camp(Huge camp btw no budget left) leveled by a nuke, you don't see me posting about it on reddit "wahh wahh someone nuked and my base got destroyed"
---
Just deal with it man.
---
Thanks I'll be on again in 14 hrs after sleep and work and playing for 8 hrs 
---
Im taking that out of my power armor build then; thanks for posting this.
---
Nah you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm fucking high man. 
---
mothman is the same. just few shot and paralell with  crap loot.
---
High fire rates (low per damage hit) are another issue that needs to be looked at due to the way damage mitigation works but yeah, armor penetration on energy weapons just doesn't work at all.
---
"Freedom Munitions" lol.
---
Are they ironic on purpose? ;)
---
No, but your life is
---
I'm just glad they got the game in a good state with lots of content before they started work on a pvp mode that I bet will be a ghost town. Wait a minute!

Same. 
---
Twice as much would be a good start. I‚Äôm spending way too much of my limited playing time managing inventory. If it isn‚Äôt dealt with soon, I‚Äôll be out. Some inventory managing is ok. Spending half my playtime dicking around with it in one way or another is bullshit.
---
i found this place once... i have been looking for it forever since. would love to have my camp there
---
But sneak and vats crits are part of a rifle build ? I carry whatever I want, have multiple quality of life perks and still one shot most everything . 
---
Fallout 76 is a mmo, mmos are designed to waste your time with repetitive tasks
---
My Gatlin gun with faster reload and bloodied I think. Can't remember. It's a lot of fun though. 
---
There are bulk fibers at vendors for relatively cheap is my counter argument. Bulk other junk like glass or rubber for trade. 
---
Maybe its just me compulsively grabbing all the junk but I find myself swimming in bulk for trade...
---
Or make the difficult decision and part with that gun you love but never use...no, you really don‚Äôt need 2000 shotgun rounds, nor does anyone need 56 Psychotats (üòÇ I‚Äôm speaking from experience, I‚Äôm a reforming horder)
---
not just gun damage but ur carryweigth too.
---
They're all definitely 10 after you use/deploy them from inventory the first time. 
---
This is why I stopped playing. The enemies were too bullet-spongey and by the time you hit the swamp most of those bullet spongey enemies don‚Äôt drop more ammo. I even raided the ammo factory as many times as I could. I ended up just saying fuck it and completed most of my quests by equipping power armor and running objective to objective. The game has a fundamental problem with this gameplay loop I got stuck in of finding ammo and stimpacks-&gt;using ammo and stimpacks to kill a random horde of anglers I come across-&gt;go grind to get more ammo and stimpacks.

I'm not super sure but I would try deleting those lines first. (Press ctrl-f to search in notepad). If that doesn't work feel free to post a screenshot link and I or someone else might be able to figure it out.
---
This is why I built my camp in literal bumfuck nowhere. I‚Äôll usually keep an eye on it through the game and I‚Äôve yet to see anyone get anywhere near the area it‚Äôs in. I‚Äôll fast travel to the vault for free and move around the map from there.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, I‚Äôve started a goal of owning every set of power armor, it‚Äôs a lot harder than you would think....it gives me something on the side to do while I‚Äôm out wrecking shit in Appalachia 
---
A welcome mat you can fast travel too
---
Well it's not like it's a big boost. I doubt they are going to do anything like selling the peacekeeper like cod did and just give a flat out advantage. 
---
On my main, I recall having a power armor chassis either on my character or in my stash, I kept it because it is 0 weight. Gonna go see what it is now
---
Does anyone else notice that venders cap pools timer got messed with? I swear it seems like I got two refreshes a day before the patch and now it's just one. 
---
They said they fixed the thing where the enemies will drop the item they are using and I noticed that is also not right. Still hitting me with a pitchfork but dropping a combat knife. 
---
Legendaries either dropping no loot, disappearing as soon as they hit the ground, or getting the syringer or drills still. They said that was fixed too. 
---
and scorchbeasts are a goddamn trainwreck dropping nothing of value, destroying armor with it's screech attack getting stuck like it's a gatling gun, and breaking guns because some refuse to land. 
---
its pretty common. if u kill 18-25 ghouls at once in whitespring u canloot only half ot them.
---
They're so tanky! I don't run from much, but every time I see a Gutsy, I ask myself if I want to deal with it. Under lvl 30? I can one shot. Lvl 50 and up? Harder than the biggest enemies. I do like that they go down quick if you manage to shoot them in the thruster. That is IF you can hit their thruster. Usually one of their arms blocks the shot. I'm guessing all their shots ignore armor (PA included).
---
600 is just enough for all my crafting materials... no room for anything else. But since all the weight perks don't apply to the stash, I have to keep all my weapons &amp; armor on me anyway.
---
Ohh yea, that's a common one, forgot about it. Added!
---
I enjoyed 4, but after like 600 hours, exploring the whole map and doing every quest multiple times, I just kinda faded off of it. Then 76 came out. A lot of the core mechanics are similar, lots more to explore, and the multi-player really keeps it feeling more alive for me.
---
When there are too many NPCs, you start to learn their routes and dialog, it gets boring and predictable. Now I can pretty much play the same, but outside of friends I never know who that random person is wandering up the road towards me. Similarly, randomly stumbling on people's Camps, even in areas I've been a dozen times, keeps the exploration entertaining.
---
I enjoy the game, and I understand it has issues, I just enjoy it more than I care about or am affected by them. 
---
He'll travel to owned workshops but I think he teleports between so no true route. If you follow him though he may either walk forever going nowhere or disappear eventually
---
My thinking is they will be clones of 76 with some radroaches thrown in and some more survivors stories. Nothing special but Bethesda will hope it will shut up the community and make them look slightly better 
---
meh, I find if you treat the game like an MMO and make multiple characters its more enjoyable. grindy for a bit but then you have instant builds ready to swap out
---
I agree with you. I would rather a commando build but I can also switch to sniper. I'm probably not as efficient as you're as a sniper but melee is easy mode. Just run in hit VATS to lock on enemies and smash. VATS even jumps me up on to a bar if they are behind it......I could do it with my eyes closed.
---
Melee should have been nerfed with TSE.
---
Junkies exploding lever action.  Love it. Its only lvl 35 but i still like it a lot!
---
I do, but if you look at the video I linked you'll see its only when this one rifles is in my inv it does it o-o?
---
üò©
---
Added a video to see some weird shit with it
---
I don‚Äôt know about other enemies BUT I can say that my Gauss Rifle that pre-nerf used to 5 shot a Scorch Beast took 3 shots to take down a Colonel Gutsy the other night ..... sigh 
---
I believe they are testing the waters.
---
Technically, they haven't reneged on their promise, because all of the microtransactions are cosmetic only; you simply receive an advantage for *wearing* them. However, I think that is a very scummy distinction, and makes for a dangerous line being crossed in the future. It's like paying a hitman so you can claim you didn't murder someone.
---
I really hoped players would be less forgiving about this, because it all but gives Bethesda a green light to keep doing it and slowly increasing the "marginal" bonuses until there's 50% damage buffs while using weapon skins, etc. I don't necessarily expect insanity over it like we got with patch 5, but less acceptance would have been nice.
---
You may be right, but this would mean a massive re-architect of balance, enemies, perks, weapons, legendary effects, and honestly I think expecting this to go away is a pipe dream.   
---
I totally agree with you about higher level enemies sharing textures with their lower level brethren, having higher DR with no visual cues telling you they're better armored isn't right. That needs to change (and doesn't require gutting the system and everything it touches).   
---
I **do not** agree with you that automatic rifles at higher levels are useless. In fact, I know you're dead wrong. Automatic rifles and machine guns are the single most powerful category of weapons in the game.   
---
Where we arrive at our different answers is that you bring Call of Duty realistic shooter mentality - that a gun is a gun, no matter who wields it, and that some gun you stumbled over + sound FPS skills should get you through the Itougherst fight in the game. **Fallout 76 is not a realistic shooter. It's Role Playing Game shooter**. That means that you have a character. And that character has attributes. And those attributes dictate how much damage your gun will do.  
---
A vanilla automatic handmade rifle on a character with no perks, or perhaps a token damage perk here or there, will, as you say, be a weak to useless endgame weapon. I agree.   
---
An automatic handmade whose damage is boosted by game mechanics available (play style, a legendary effect, damage boosting mutations, all the damage boosting perks you can bring to bear, damage boosting mods, recoil-control mods that maximise your hit rate, adding a perk to reduce the effect of enemy armor, a magazine mod to reduce the effect of enemy armor and so forth) will make that handmade output about 250 damage per hit (before additional modifiers like glow sights, adrenaline, gun-fu, etc.) and ignore most of your enemy armor. Being able to apply a combined hit, hitting 20 times in a row in a very short period of time will also give this weapon a huge edge over slow single-fire weapons like revolvers, lever handles and gauss rifles.   
---
I run this build, and will happily share my numbers.   
---
I can make a similar case for energy weapons (for example a plasma + flamer conversion). 300+DPH.   
---
Not all weapons in a weapon class can do this. Only some. You gotta figure out which.   
---
This is a part of the game.   
---
Wow, lucky
---
I can do with 400 for just all the junk and food and meds and clothes, no problem..
---
But occasionally I want to keep a weapon, or an armor piece, or a PA piece. For sentimental reasons. Or having the option to run a different build occasionally. Or for collecting sets. Would be nice if that didn't take up between 5 and 50 pound per piece, on top of all that other stuff. Could have another separate container for them, that isn't limited by weight but by amount instead. The load on the server there would be no different if I stored 1 ultra-light armor piece or 1 lead-lined armor piece (I would think), so having each of them take up wastly different amount of storage budget seems odd.
---
I have not. What system are you on? It's your internet connection great or just okay?
---
Oh but that would require tuning rather than just copy pasting everything they can from Fallout 4 :)
---
Can I just point out that maintaining a low health to be able to kill things is stupid, counter-intuitive, and has no place in any survival game? How does one‚Äôs health level effect damage? If this were a baseball game, would having low fatigue let me throw a fastball faster? NO. 
---
I have to confess, I started it. Saw the purple eyed one in the forest and couldn't help myself. Killed the green eyed one. The yellow eyed one was almost dead but managed to get away. Too bad we can't take his head as a trophy and display it in our camp.
---
Ps4 and internet connection is great. I've tried several times on multiple occasions. 
---
I had it earlier today but I swear to God since you posted this I won't be able to find it. You damned us both. Maybe someone else can hook us up
---
raiders aren't griefers. Big difference. Same category, but raiders kill for caps and junk. Griefers just like to break shit for fun.
---
Just sound like you do?
---
Shame they didn't want to put that effort into the actual game either
---
Okay. I was a little worried even though I'm a normal non-duping, non-muling player. Thanks for that reassuring info.  I'm still a bit concerned that Bethesda allegedly removed all access to a players' other purchased Bethesda games. That seems a bit unfair to me, if the player paid for the other games legitimately and didn't do anything wrong while using them.   
---
Ammo is not rare, if ur on Xbox and you need some ammo HMU

Don't do this to yourself it's embarrassing

Here is the spreadsheet for explanation. 
---
I believe there is a maximum run speed increase of whatever speed demon nets, so with that mutation, everything else is pointless.
---
Or one could use the other speed increases and not have to use the mutation.
---
Lol, I know the feeling.

---
It's not just you, my limit is incredibly small for an exploration/looting game. It's depressing really.
---
Then I dunno I know something similar can happen if you scrap a gun of the same type like scrapping a hunting rifle it would change the damage to the one of the one that you scrapped but only the number not it‚Äôs actual damage
---
60hp (I am assuming that's how it stacks) on each of 4 people is an additional 240hp in a hypothetical PvP scenario. The HP is buffable by a % with a perk card and incoming damage can be reducing with gear and perk cards as well.  
---
 This kind of thing will not fly in the PvP focused mode they are adding. I really want to see that succeed.
---
Melee is easy yes , and very powerful. But I still dont think It should be nerfed . People forget that rifles have range, and melee does not.  If melee was nerfed so it would take 5 hits to kill me, guns would be back on top imo 
---
My man!
---
I got killed so many times by fucking rad rats that I turned the game off. Is there any reason why they are so insanely powerful? They are the Fallout 76 crickets of Fallout 76.
---
Any other demands?
---
This art makes Deathclaws seem cuter somehow.
---
I did not get the raider armor from Rose‚Äôs quest, lol i used the ultracite armor and when the legs broke i scrapped them by mistake, had to farm the sbq to get the plans i was so pissed with myself, also scrapped my voice of set but then found it last month at wotoga station, weird you cant craft a new one.
---
Sounds what this post is really wanting is... Daily rewards
---
If you go through a decon arch you don't become more vulnerable to disease like you do with radaway. That, and you can basically farm all those radaways for extra caps if you have one. 
---
I had super duper trigger 4x while making bloodpacks earlier OP 
---
Sentinel and cavalier is minor, rad resist is major, assassins is primary
---
You can have a sentinel/cavalier assassins with rad resist
---
Yes, except 76 was designed specifically to be BOTH a RPG and a Survival Game (albeit Survival Lite, it was still meant to be one, per the design team)
---
You'll get people arguing that it's still "cosmetic only" because well, the buff isn't that big.. so you know, cosmetic only or a little boost here and there, look the other way, it's only one time, limited time...

3. Everytime you swap to the Galting Plasma it starts with the same ammo qty as the number of plasma cores i have
---
That's what I'm hoping for at some point and thanks man you're a life saver
---
Well... wish I knew that before I invested my perks in it.
---
It has been 3 for as long as I have had Super Duper (over a month and a half) so I am not sure where the nerf is.
---
This is getting ridiculous. Lvl 60 used a 140 Gauss, a 50 Cal Gat., plus others and barely scratched a lvl 24 Assaultron or other Robots/Scorchers.
---
Used to one shot with my /2sh-exp pump shotgun on a lvl 68 enemies yet now even against the 24 lvl assaultron it now takes about 8 shots.
---
A 4 barrel Instigating Dragon Legendary used to 1shot now it barely scratches enemies.
---
I get Bethesda wanted to change some things up yet this is insane! Plus 5-10 shots of any weapon nearly brakes it and I‚Äôm maxed perks to ensure that doesn‚Äôt happen.
---
The nerfing of weapons, making enemies sponges that take 10 times the damage then before. 
---
I‚Äôm just done, tired of wasting time with trying to do anything in this bugged up garbage heap of a game. I‚Äôll try again in a couple weeks to see if they fix anything. 
---
The TSE damage nerf was catastrophic....as in, over 1000 damage gone overnight, catastrophic 
---
It took me 3 minutes and 4 stimpacks to kill a lvl 62 bloated scorched with a stock level 45 chainsaw lmao 
---
Open world PVP? Not quite sure how using a system in a way it‚Äôs intended is being a dick.
---
huh?
---
It's weird that you claim there is a difference between raiding and greifing but have not said what the difference is. Let's hear what a raider considers to be greifing
---
this is making me sad. I always liked high intelligence and energy weapons on old games
---
No, I understand.  I think for people just starting out without looking it up, they'll find themselves short on ballistic fiber.
---
But players like me that try to find places to go, without looking it up online, I'll find a spot I regularly crawl for it, but if I really need the stuff I can always buy it.  It's common enough for me, but I can understand is new players don't find it so common.
---
I don't but the same thing happened to me in watoga. I didn't see anyone nearby on the map but something kept hitting me. I hope it's not an exploit people are using 
---
I didn‚Äôt leave the Forest till nearly level 30, then I moved to Savage Divide, Ash Heap, Toxic Valley, Mire and then finally Bog around level 45-50
---
How often do you play with 3 friends in a non-nuke zone? Besides half of the costumes are bugged and replace your armor
---
If I tell you, they'll nerf it.
---
Not to argue with OP, but this *was* billed as a survival game. So omnipresent, unwanted PvP was kind of always in the cards. I think getting angry about that at this point is rather silly.
---
That being said, I totally agree that 20 caps is **nothing** compared to what that asshole did to you. I think the Caps awarded for killing him should obviously have been greater, in proportion to the amount of destruction he meted out to your camp. 
---
I also think that, as a (recently) Wanted player, his camp should have remained for a period of time after he logged, so that vigilantes such as yourself could have delivered proper Wasteland justice.
---
76 would have been brilliant if it was 2-4 co op only. 
---
No. you and 90% of the player base
---
2-shot Gatling.  The Governess.  Puts all the unruly children to bed.
---
Ok thanks for reaching out.
---
Nah, still an annoyance for me as well especially since I play Minecraft: FO76 edition half the time (farming, building, scrapping, modding, selling)
---
lol, don't know where that assumption came from but ok
---
If my TS handmade or my explosive radium rifle needed to be nerfed?????
---
No doubt this thing is insanely OP and needs to be nerfed.
---
Who the fuck buys physical copies? I have a 4tb external on my Xbox one, I haven't bought a physical game on pc since star wars galaxies
---
Yep looks bugged...
---
happened
---
I am so glad this little fun event is over tonight so all of you conspiracy theory folks can find a new one to rant over 40 times a day.
---
Well, you need two to make the Mcdonald's arches.
---
If you want real story get Fallout New Vegas and all the DLCs the story is so immersive nothing better
---
The issue comes with the online aspect, that's where it becomes artificially grind heavy.
---
&gt; In every game I've ever played armor reduces a flat % of damage incoming.
---
I know games where it doesn't and it can make sense. Think about a knight in heavy armor, how safe is he going to be when hit by a wrecking ball?
---
**BUT** in games following this logic you usually have a second way to mitigation damage to reduce it % based.
---
One way works great for big hits and the other for many small hits in quick succession.
---
Each has a hole in its defensive mechanic.
---
Are you placing blueprinted builds in them? I've had blueprints in the past that were bugged and would kick me off the server within minutes of placing them in my CAMP, and they wouldn't be saved upon reconnecting (but other progress was saved, like items I'd used or picked up).
---
Ammo pack mod for PA torsos that adds ammo capacity that doesn't share space with your junk would be great for heavy gunners. I'm seriously thinking about buying perks for heavy guns so I can switch between that and my current setup.
---
So true
---
No blueprints. Just some turrets and extractors
---
After I finish Fo4 DLCs I‚Äôll def do that next
---
That free mod you love now costs 19.99. - With love, Bethesda
---
P.S. Can we interest you in another copy of Skyrim?
---
Just wait for the lunch box boosts.  They will be added.
---
Jurry Rigging was a good perk RIP
---
Harsh truth: none of the above would really improve the game. Nothing worth buying in the atom store; nothing worth spending bullets on in the endgame.
---
Is stacking bobble heads still an exploit? I came across a guy while overtaking the Charleston junkyard workshop about a month ago, I was able to one shot him twice with my TSE Lever Rifle...then I went up on the hill for higher ground, I watched him walk in and rummage around his stash box for a minute or two until he engaged me for a third time, all of the sudden he couldn‚Äôt be killed...even when I broke out my god Gauss 
---
Making someone rebuild and use resources to do so for reason than grief is absolutely a dick move. The system is there, and grief is to be expected.  
---
It's like real life, there are decent people who help others and that is fun to them, and people like you, to whom fun means being a dick and destroying things and griefing people. 
---
I had almost warmed up to the atom store. The fact that there is already the caveman suit and they put Grognaks up there is BS. The fact the for two weeks straight the biggest weekly challenge "pick flowers" worth 40 points is bugged for everyone on all platforms fills me with rage. The pink bed and lack of any new emotes makes me sad. Who they got running this shitshow?
---
Ammo really isn‚Äôt rare
---
Maybe fusion cores but they can be farmed 
---
If you actually stop being lazy and find the hotspots for lead and steel it‚Äôs really easy just to craft ammo, 
---
Add in ammosmith and you get double
---
Enemies are billet sponges but none if you said anything about it playing fallout 4
---
What do you actually expect Bethesda to do if you didn‚Äôt complain about it during the last game 
---
This is something that pissed me off so fucking much. If my camp or my workshop is under attack, the enemies should focus on finding me if I'm there, not breaking my shit. Because then, instead of actually defending my camp, I have to check every small object that the molerats might be attacking
---
I AM TIRED OF THIS JUST STOP
---
Let us know what you find!
---
The problem is no matter how much they gave me I would use it all and it not be enough. Right now I maintain my scraps at like 20 bulks of each, if I had more I would have 25,30,40 whatever.. practically I store way more than I would ever need anyhow.
---
Wut? Lol 
---
Bee swarms sometimes become invisible to me, and it's about 50/50 they are targettable in VATS or completely invisible. Usually if I just sprint away for a bit and run off a cliff they disappear.
---
Omg if you build it can I see it I‚Äôm on ps4
---
The alt works ok. I bought a second copy for $10 from cdkeys to have a mule to store my junk i don't want to get rid of.
---
I like to hoard weapons, so my problem is the ridiculous weight of weapons,so I resort to legendaries with reduced weight usually.
---
General feedback. 
---
I am level 55.  I have had a few fights with the Scorchbeast, with the assistance of my turrets. I can't even put a dent in it, on my own, with the best weapons I can find or make and wearing T-60 Power Armour.  I just have to get off the server or be killed repeatedly.  I feel that I should be able to have a chance to fight this thing on my own.  It fires at me continually and rarely stays still.  It was the same with the Mothman - no damage to is was possible despite repeated attempts. It's getting a bit disappointing and pointless.  
---
i guess you havent met someone who knows how to use "stealth boys". if your not chewing grape mentats 24/7 that melee guy will just run straight to you (if he can find you. long scopes op) and kill you. 
---
the meta right now is stealth boys, grape mentats and long scopes. stealth boys make it so you cannot be targeted with "vats". 
---
then there is only 2 outcomes:
---
the rifle man unable to Vats has to hit his shots, stagger the melee guy and kill him through his Cavalier build 
---
or the Melee guy closes the gap, staggers you with the guaranteed sprint melee stagger (to counter sentinel) then one shots you with the 2nd attack ( melee builds use bloodied/att speed unarmed weapons). 
---
pvp in this game is dull and boring. ive practically already quit this game and moved on to warframe/eso that i put on hold for awhile. 
---
These are my feelings of the game exactly and the same reasons why I decided to stop playing a month and a half ago. I was really enjoying the game until around level 30. At that point I felt like it was more of grind than was worth it, even when playing with two other friends.
---
I just bulk my junk and sell it, on average I can make 500-800 caps in an hour or so of playtime 
---
Gunpowder adds up to a significant weight quickly.
---
Same here.  Can't remember where it happened, but it acted like an aggressive mob.  I was able to outrun it and then fast travel, thank god I was not over-encumbered at the time. The fight music was on the entire time.
---
LOL
---
My theory is that they were already to be added, and they decided not to over nerds complaining. They had added Merry Christmas and New Year's messages that implied we were getting something 'on them'. Yeah first one's free sure lol. But it's a bummer people think they didn't put something in for the holidays
---
I thought it was psychobuff along with yogi bear and deathclaw steaks.  This may be for fist weapons though.  May have also changed in the past few months.
---
You so crazy, rifles last for days. Use your perks, yo!
---
Do to the bunker either the science or medical terminal, will find it there, i dumped all my plans at wotoga the other day, 
---
But it‚Äôs not a baseball game. 
---
You‚Äôre free to point it out, but it‚Äôs still just your opinion. I think it‚Äôs a great playstyle and a lot of fun. 
---
As far as low health and dealing more damage? Hurt things don‚Äôt want to be hurt more, so they go balls out and don‚Äôt hold back. That‚Äôs the idea with Bloodied. And I think that‚Äôs great, intuitive, and has a place in survival games. 
---
There is a crafting recipe for the 76 
---
R u sure u r not thinking of bufftats?
---
Sold all I can. Sorry to everyone I couldn't get to. 
---
I completely bypassed the Raider Armor and went and got the Excavator armor without any PA until then...just grind and level up, Excavator is the best armor for anyone under lvl 50
---
I don't ever carry 2 rifles. What are you doing to make them weigh 30 pounds?  
---
I carry 0-1 heavy guns, 0-1 rifles, 0-1 automatics, 0-1 shotguns, 0-1 pistols, and usually a melee weapon. 
---
Also almost always some grenades.
---
&gt; if you move and replace your base it repairs everything for the cap cost of moving. 
---
100% true. Anyone want to bet they patch this out ASAP?
---
Yes, if you can put a weapon over the critical threshold of damage you can negate the armor system entirely. That isn't the debate.
---
The problem is that it takes a lot to get over this threshold, and there is no reason for this threshold to even be a thing in the first place, it's just bad use of design.
---
Enemies can be challenging without any armor whatsoever, this type of enemy would require completely different tactics, mechanics, and weapons to deal with, but no such enemy exists because Bethesda decided to just give every enemy large amounts of armor without understanding the consequences of doing so. The minigun is a weapon that has a minimum level of 35, but is only good for killing level 10 and below enemies, yet Bethesda seams to think it would be useful and have so many in game references to it as something praise worthy when it is completely worthless.
---
If there was one enemy in the game who had no armor and a ton of health then the minigun would have a use, as it has the highest theoretical dps there is, it's just complete wank because the least armored enemy has 100 armor and it only takes 14 to cut it's damage in half.
---

That's not why it was 20 caps. Some of these greifers use characters with no caps to destroy camps. I got 2 caps after I killed one that destroyed half my camp. If they don't have any caps the bounty is whatever they have. They are simply assholes. There is no role play or any benefit from what they do other than some sick thrill
---
I mean shit happens. Sometimes people are mean sometimes people are nice. 
---
It really sounds like griefing is being killed by someone of a higher level that just decides to destroy everything because, well they can. 
---
I understand there is a small percent of people who purchased weapons and stuff that is not griefing. That is bethesda not fixing the game quick enough and allowing it to get out of hand. Nothing they can do now other than ban people. 
---
The game is open world so griefing is apart of it. Just like any other game. Those people who bought weapons will soon have to buy ammo and junk to fix it so who is really losing? You who is just having to spend extra time replacing some stuff in game or the person who has to go to a real job and earn money so they can be better than you. 
---
Just hop servers for now I guess. Being mad a Bethesda isnt doing anything obviously. And let that person who decided to spend actual money on a weapon in fallout 76 lol like why the fuck doesn't make sense. So many other things to spend money on.
---
The nursery room in VTU almost always has a complete Buttercup, if it hasn‚Äôt been looted on that server 
---
If we are limiting the developer's ability to add fun events like this to the game based on how much of a hissy fit the community gets into, we'll never have another event again.
---
Example of similar levels of whining even though no one did it: "he had max toys/candy/sweets whatever the fuck the rad reduction max bonus from event was, that means my gamma gun/radium rifle/radiation emitter didn't work as well against him"
---
That was a poor example, but I don't remember any other events we've had
---
Neat!
---
got the plans,  read the plans, not getting option to build power station
---
well the escalated quickly.
---
I can make you one. I have the plan
---
Who‚Äôs the guy
---
Before they focus on the difference it's causing because that's nigh nothing to those wearing sentinel armor. They could just fire thousands of rounds while standing still and eventually kill all four. That's a huge problem. I thought it was only 15hp not 15%.

Keeping things server side is the best way to prevent injection of fake items. I know duping is a thing but im talking diablo 1/2 player created items with insane stats. With duping, you at the very least needed to find that 2shotexplosivewhatever before you duped it. 
---
How about singleplayer mode? Then people can fuckup their games and mod how they please. Oh hi fallout 4.
---
Fury+ yao guai steak or stew+ mutant hound chops. Cant remember which yao guai gives you a better buff, they both buff, ones just better
---
Big enemies need things thrown at them. I feel like that's what they are going for. When encountering big enemies I've gotten good with throwing knives. for really big ones, you should have some plasma grenades. 
---
300 hrs and this one still eludes me...shit, I‚Äôve only seen the Mothman once and it ran away when I started killing it 
---
Wounding *is* still a thing, but it's marked as a [tier 4 legendary](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713408867500032/535475523867115520/unknown.png).

---
My 1* vampire automatic Tesla rifle
---
Post like these that make me want to take my sweet ass time getting back to the game.  Only reason I even want to get back to it is to finish it for the money i spent. 
---
What do you play on we can be friends :)
---
Unless it's nerfed, the limit doesn't exist on public workshops. If you build 3 industrial purifiers on multiple public workshops you can fast travel between them and they will all refill together
---
At a rather surreal Scortched Earthe event where no players showed up I saw one of those gutsys soloing the queen. If it hadn't decided to turn on me instead it'd be sporting some ultracite explosive vents now.
---
My counter opinion is that Fallout 76 isn't trying to be a pure survival game; but a RPG-Action-Survival hybrid. It isn't going to be one thing purely.
---
That can mesh well in some areas, others not. 
---
But some of your examples really boil down to balance issues, and those are separate IMO from what a game is trying to be. 
---
Bethesda is too cheap to give us something that nice
---
I had a medics/vats crit/less ap Tesla rifle that I sold before ever even trying that I wish I held on to. How do you use them? I tried one once with no mods and I felt like it was really bad.
---
Fast travel and they change.
---
Would the steak and stew stack? I think the steak gives 10% and the stew 15% not sure tho
---
It's a hunters rolling pin isnt it. I'm on to you.
---
This sort of thing just makes the game more tedious and less fun. I am willing to stake quite a bit on the assertion that NOBODY gets joy from managing their inventory in order to just be able to play the actual game. Conversely, i *know* that it makes me sad when I can't collect the items I'd like to.
---
Games are meant to be fun, not work.
---
No no, this is completely wrong.  Some of the assets do not belong in the atom store behind a pay wall.  
---
A lot of the items are copy pasted from fallout 4 and we're available from doing quests.  It is not acceptable to then charge for it in fallout 76.  
---
Then there is those saying the game gives free atoms.  It does to a certain extent.  But it soon dries up and with one weapon skin costing 400 atoms, to acquire all of the stuff it would cost hundreds of dollars.
---
Also tell just cosmetic is bullshit.  There are costumes that provide boosters.  The silver shroud costume let's you equip armor with the boost.  The one you can get in game doesn't grant this luxury.
---
I am not a teen but old enough to remember games being complete with add-ons down the line.  Not a game pieced up and sold to us bit by bit.  How people defend these anti consumer practices is beyond me.   
---
As far as I know, you are correct in assuming Fury is the best drug for melee.  Psychobuff and tats do less damage (they just also work on ranged weapons).
---
Honestly, if you're doing all those substances, perks, and mutations,  and have full Unyielding gear, you should be doing an insanely unrealistic amount of damage to the queen.
---
I‚Äôm a born and raised West Virginian and honestly, Bethesda did a very good job on the Flatwoods Monster, it‚Äôs pretty accurate to the authentic local lore (minus the Zetan tie in, obviously). I can‚Äôt say the same for the cuddly Mothman, that was a big nope. 
---
my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/an96g0/this_freemium_atom_shop_promotion_leaves_a_foul/efrnyps/) below:  
---
&gt; 60hp (I am assuming that's how it stacks) on each of 4 people is an additional 240hp in a hypothetical PvP scenario. The HP is buffable by a % with a perk card and incoming damage can be reducing with gear and perk cards as well.  
---
&gt; This kind of thing will not fly in the PvP focused mode they are adding. I really want to see that succeed.  
---
Ok thx man
---
The English is broken but your point is spot on mate. I mean, the enemies were bullet sponges before they nerfed my perks and guns, no idea how had it is now i moved on to something else after the last patch. 
---
I'm glad I'm done with 76, for the foreseeable future, had my fun with it despite everything Bethesda's done.
---
But I don't see myself returning to it again. Maybe in three years or so if they manage to release some update that looks interesting enough but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I'll probably stick to their future single player games where the community can come together and fix everything Bethesda doesn't..
---
Hm. I have to do mine in multiple separate parts cuz the garden and water purifiers are typically in dirt... but other than that, it lets me blueprint the whole thing. Only level 50 though but my CAMP is quite large
---
So either we have a disagreement about whether getting our weapons over the critical threshold is part of the game (FPS'er thinking says no, RPG thinking says yes). And Fallout, ever since Fallout 1, is an RPG. 
---
Or, we have a more tactical point about minimal assured damage, whereby firing a minigun at something, for argument's sake something that isn't entirely made out of undestructium like an SBQ or the backside of a mirelurk queen, something like a high level scorched or a high level super mutant perhaps, should still take some minimal assured amount of damage from anything that makes lead go fast. That I'm inclined to agree with.
---
Fallout used to be a beacon away from from that shit and now it's covered in it. Sad.
---
I‚Äôm a local as well, I think the Flatwoods Monster design in the game is the most authentic design they made out of all the cryptids in the game 
---
Just but a cheap headset.  It makes a huge difference in the fun factor and being able to communicate during missions.
---
It is an aoe weapon, attack groups and it arcs to other nearby targets. From my use of it it doesn't seem to have a maximum number of targets, just a maximum arcing distance, not that I paid so much attention. I take it into nuke zones, round up 10-15 mobs and let everyone else take potshots. Hahaha tanking in 76
---
 Bloodied Dragon. Does tremendous stealth damage if I hover just above my impending death.
---
They said they were going to up it after the first increase, but that was about 2 months ago now. I really don't get what benefit they get from people quitting their game because inventory management is so tedious and time consuming.
---
It's not remotely enough. I like to collect weapons with a certain prefix, and I like to collect armor of a certain type of all prefixes, and 600 is nowhere near enough. If that's not how Bethesda thinks I should play, they're wrong. I paid for the game, that's how I want to play it. 
---
I dont think they stack, but Im not certain. That combination is what one guy I played with used to 4 hit kill the queen. Not sure if he was stacking bobbleheads too. I asked him if he wanted any bufftats or anything else, but he only wanted fury (or psycho to make fury)
---
Just getting 10,000 over total playtime
---
I think they could help that by at least making it so bulk junk doesn't weigh anything in your stash. That would make Bulking worth the extra expense and cut down on the item count in your stash. Having ammo not take up weight in your stash would be nice too for storing all that ammo you don't want to carry but might want to save for when you want to change out your weapon build.
---
Ok thx
---
There is bird bones though. Its close enough.
---
I‚Äôm starting to think the same thing...I think it‚Äôs a cruel joke 
---
Ok why.
---
Have you fought the cloaked gutys yet?
---
The Gatling gun weighs the same as my IRL UK59 belt fed fully loaded at around 20lbs. The handmade rifle suprisingly weighs about the same as an AK47, but the light machine gun weighs 16lbs versus the roughly 25lbs the MG42 weighs.
---
I mean, we could start with having better info on how much everything in our stash weighs.  Like, show me how much that stack weighs, then i can make better decisions on what to get rid of.
---
A weapons locker with 200 and an armor locker with 200 might help, too.  As others mention, perks effecting the stash would be beneficial, too.
---
I thought you could trigger Queen of the Hunt at O'Rourke's terminal out in the woods.  I've triggered it a few times but never finished it.  Does it no longer trigger once you beat it?
---
I like to collect power armor for different events and jobs like xo1 for its rad/energy,ultracite if lots of normal ballistic guns, and t51 when I'm just exploring (it's a good all around, and I don't like wearing out my fancy power armor)
---
Bye Felicia. 
---
I think it's glitched I've had 12K caps and still do not have that trophy on PS4 maybe the next time I cross 10K I'll get it
---
Your range means absolutely nothing in pvp because both players need to hit each other to trigger pvp. You will be in melee range no matter what. You won't get to shoot five times before you're one shot by a super sledge or deathclaw gauntlet. The AI in this game is even more braindead than the theoretical opponent you described in the OP, so even a casual player can easily manipulate or abuse them. And melee users can absolutely wait undetected lol, they even get a better sneak attack multiplier than guns and a decent VATS lunge range. 
---
Its just a note telling you what plants give what flux
---
Its more of an Easter Egg, I feel like it and the Mothman weren‚Äôt ever supposed to be boss level enemies....just a ‚ÄúHoly Shit, here it is‚Äù moment
---
That sounds like fun. Wish I kept mine. I just thought "man I bet someone would pay a lot of caps for this" and didn't even stop to try it out lol.
---
Have you been playing from beta ? A lot of trophy‚Äôs are bugged from characters made during the beta. 
---
Medics only works on vats crits, I just fire and heal myself all day
---
New vegas kept the enemy armor enemy dependant, all deathclaws have the same 15 armor, with three notable exceptions, all cazadores have NO ARMOR, the only enemy with variable amounts of armor were humans, who mostly hovered in the 5-8 range, with rare heavies who's armor could climb into the 20's.
---
The thing was there were lots of enemies that even in the end game had no armor, meaning you could use hollowpoint low damage weapons with high rates of fire to put out huge dps. The only major exception was the minigun, who's base damage was so low that even 2 armor handicapped you dps, so they gave it 10 ap, making it a solid threat to any ligh armor enemies.
---
The AM rifle was great, but against many enemies you didn't need it and if it it couldn't one shot the thing you were shooting sometimes wasn't ideal for it's slow fire rate. If  every enemy in the game had an extra 20 armor, which is equivalent to this game, then it would be absolutely mandatory.
---
Bethesda, why not put stash limit into the control of the player?
---
Keep the pre-set limit low like its current 600, But make the perk cards
---
used for reducing carry weight on player work for stash as well.
---
There is no use in trying to make certain perks less mandatory, they will be no matter 
---
what depending on player type. So give our character builds the control.
---
This would also help support player vendors maximize the specific items they intend to trade.
---
Because you can literally pick up any amount of trash and sell it for a cap or two, hyper inflation doesn‚Äôt work, even in a video game

Cheaper and work way better then turtle beach 
---
If I were you, I would get a nice set of T-60 power armor, and a 2 handed weapon. I‚Äôm closing in on level 200 and when I run low on resources I use the Ol‚Äô super sledge until I find enough bullets for one of my guns to be useable again. I have about 3 guns with different ammo types I switch between. 10 mm and .45 is pretty common. T-60 is also cheap to repair, and will save durability on your regular armor pieces.
---
Also there is 4 or 5 ballistic fibers at every BOS post in the cranberry bog. Using White Knight makes armor much more manageable.
---
I agree, we should be one/few shot's depending on hit box/luck and dead.  We need something that isn't a shit arcade repeat.  
---
Yeah that'd probably be my problem I played 1 whole session of Beta because none of the live times worked with my work schedule and that might be what's happening.
---
But isn't it more fun when your weapon breaks mid battle and you die while trying to find a replacement in your inventory??
---
It's a stupid dynamic that has never improved a game. Things like limited inventory space, item durability, the inability to jump/climb, etc just make for less fun games and completely reflect the lack of creativity by the designers.
---
Then dont read it duh 
---
Then you have to grind for those legendary drops.  I want to be in peril from the start.
---
This is exactly what I'm asking. How can you say with any seriousness they're spending more time on the atom shop than the game. They add in old skins from fo4 like every 2 weeks. It's actually more like they put barely any effort into it at all. 
---
damn, me too. That's sad man back in the day when you pre-order  a game it came with a toy, or poster and toy, or collectible map and guide book, tons of stuff and it also didn't cost you extra at all just pre-order and pay for the game.  
---
I have no idea who they are but there are way too many people willing to waste money in the last ten years and then some. All of which are the ones who make us all suffer and in the end will make it all come down to three games, each with one function.
---
Most players just had to make a new character to they the missing achievements 
---
Been this way since release. There was no stealth nerf.
---
Uh, yes, they do. HOWEVER, the higher level the enemy, the more "spongy" they should be. I've been playing since the BETA. I play a couple of hours almost every day. I have 2 characters and when I started my second one it was so much easier. I had a solid plan and it worked. You CANNOT be a 'jack of all trades, master of none' type of character. You focus on one build type, and many builds can accommodate a secondary type, and roll with it.
---
I'm so tired of people whining about the gaming being so hard. It's not. It doesn't even take much player skill. I'm old and don't nearly have the reflexes of a young man/woman and I can play just fine. I don't want to come off as bashing the OP, but the OP needs a better plan of action.
---
My main character is primarily unarmed melee, with non-automatic rifles (ranged) as a secondary. I can one shot 80% of enemies with my non-legendary hunting rifle or gauss rifle. I have one of each of the rifleman perks and the Adrenal Reaction mutation. That's it for rifles. I've invested much more into unarmed. At the end of the day, I still carry only 4 weapons (2 gauntlets, 2 rifles). I don't use power armor.
---
SO, I'm not saying the way things are are great. They aren't. Heavy weapons suck. Explosive weapons are underwhelming. Ranged weapons--not simply the hunting rifle--need some love; I want to see more automatic weapon builds. Pistols are meh late game. Too much love was given to PA. The Hazmat suit may as well be branded "Kleenex." I could go on and on. Melee, unarmed, two handed, and one handed, are on point. Why? because it takes a while to make the most of them, as it should be, but once fully developed they are effective. But to pick up any weapon without the proper plan and investment is simply whining.
---
What the OP suggested doesn't solve the 'problem.' If specced properly, the guns don't break that fast, ammo is plentiful if you're diligent about picking up the plentiful scrap to craft it, and carry capacity is fine--with the exception of rifles. What the issue is that there is little ***easily obtained*** information for the casual player about how mechanics work a player can make the most of his/her perks or even formulate a plan/build. The brief perk descriptions are sub-par at best. Obviously, I've put a lot more time into the research, but having to do this is not fair to the casual player who just put the kids to bed and wants to play for an hour or two.
---
I could write a thesis on this entire topic, but this is all for now. The game is not broken. It simply needs the appropriate tweaks and a little more effort on the players' part to make it great.
---
It‚Äôs not about the events being fun. Which they aren‚Äôt, because buying things from the atom store is hardly what anyone would call ‚Äúfun,‚Äù but about them following through on their word when they said all microtransactions would be *purely* cosmetic. That‚Äôs a very key thing and any deviation from that is tantamount to a renege on their original promise.
---
Yeah that would be true, dlc are slowly destroying gaming
---
It was mindlessly shredding scorched tweakers with my TSE Lever Rifle....now, Post Nerf-Pocalypse, I‚Äôm not really sure 
---
Ngl I saw a shot on either the RDR sub or r/gaming of two dogs playing (in the game not irl) and that sold me on it. Now I just need the like $50 to get it üòÇ it's on sale on PS+ right now. 
---
I hate when cool shit gets posted on this sub because there are too many report happy bitches that will want stuff like this gone.
---
Make sure to yell at your children whilst navigating.
---
Use a gatling gun or shotgun for when they're flying, or you'll go crazy waiting for it to land. If you get the Prime receiver for either of those it'll increase the damage against scorchbeasts and scorched, at the tradeoff of requiring ultracite ammo. Totally worth it. Otherwise just hope it lands.
---
Is it more or less "end game" content than any other fallout game?  Is there an "end game"?  Fallout and end-game don't really mix.  There's a story, you finish it, you explore the game and build out your character and, as of fallout 4 -- build stuff.  This is how fallout works, this one just has multiplayer now.
---
I find a lot of games are like that- once you‚Äôve done basically everything in the game, there isn‚Äôt much left to do ;)
---
Maybe one of your buddies on your team placed it without you knowing? This just doesn't make sense lol but hell its fallout 76 sooo you never know 
---
I‚Äôm with you on that, I‚Äôm nearly 300 hrs in and I‚Äôm STILL discovering sites on the map, that‚Äôs pretty awesome honestly 
---
imagine if they had done this, then the dupers and the TSE would have been as simple as an expected routine date wipe.
---
I mean, that's lighter than IRL.
---
I saw it this evening. Repeatedly. 
---
This is all I ever wanted...and still want
---
Cosmetic/decorative items should have no impact on build budget 
---
There are 2 connection points. Have the keypad of the door/wall facing out. Place power on the inside. Hook main power to the blue breaker box on the inside wall/door. Keypad should now work. Hook power to a switch (wall or post) or keypad, then run the wire from the switch/inside keypad to the top of the inside door/wall, above the door and in the middle. It should snap into place.
---
I got it on video a couple times, I just need to figure out how to get it off of my PS4 
---
beats me, still scratching my chin on why you bothered to post a reply.
---
Qualifying costumes are available in the overworld. I get your point, though. This walks riiiight up to the line.
---
its a bug, equip and unequip. This isn't a visual error. The damage output is as the digits display.
---
I have a bloodied explosive lever action rifle, which can go upto 500 with adrenaline and the bloody perk at low health, but for some reason it drops to 300. I have to unequip and equip it to get the dps back up. I constantly have to check if it bugged out. Which is annoying.
---
Sounds like your way of playing has made you a happier person.
---
Funny that i never saw one person EVER suggest that they should limit the amount of items we can stash in previous games.
---
One way is just better than the other. Admit it.
---
So people are mad simply because microtransactions exist, whether it means it helps you in game or not? When people are complaining about the games bugs and making great points it really dampens the point when they end it with "and take down the atom shop things are too expensive!" 
---
I am curious if that's true though, I haven't worked with their engine but I thought the issue was that each entity is tracked individually. So that a entity of 1 steel has an ID and that ID stays persistent across the world so that it can be individually marked with meta properties (such as stolen, damaged etc). Perhaps it's different for ammunition and junk. One can hope.
---
I have spent literal hours going through my inventory, it is awful. If you want to limit us make it easier to manage the inventory at least. 
---
I'm not trying to be an asshole or anything but why the fuck do you need a machine gun for?
---
Ok NP I'll just wait for my next play through thanks for the info
---
The extra 15 hit points ends today. After that wearing the costume doesn‚Äôt give you extra hitpoints
---
In pvp now yes. In the future pvp? And in my example I was hit first,  thus being able to slip away and shoot to iniate. And while they can wait undetected... they can not wait undetected and be able to shoot every enemy in the room. 
---
**I think this is the single best suggestion made** on this subreddit since its inception.   
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer can you please take this suggestion up internally?
---
Having some kind of public general design decision list, not for all decisions ever but by the common issues raised on forums, and visibility into whether Bethesda design team thinks it's as it should be (per design) or warrants major attention, or minor tweaking/balancing attention, would not only improve BGS/community communication, it would also absorb a lot of resentment by giving people a sense of "the thing you care about is being worked on".   
---
This would be a genuinely valuable thing for everyone.
---
Sorry mate, no offence intended I just couldn't resist :).
---
I run the same build. I don't get why people cry about bullet sponges when they **don't build for damage** ??? 
---
Me too. Also a 2-4 companion Skyrim. 
---
A scorchbeast lure like the one from the "It's a trap event" and alternatively, something that can protect CAMP by warding off enemies. 
---
New variants for the terminal and more things in the resources category. If I'm not building on a node all I get is a Brahmin pen? Excuse me but that ain't shit. (Okay it's actually only shit but that's not the point" Distillery would be viable is there is a time requirement for fermentation. A craft station to use more of the items you already have like bottles. I want to catch fireflies and put them in bottles for the same look the Birdwatchers Camp has. Or make a wind chime out of them or a trap like broken glass. 
---
Oh yeah. 
---
I accidentally got out of my power armor fighting the SBQ trying to revive someone and was stuck in an infinite loop of dying from radiation spawning in the nuke zone and not being able to move and dying again. 
---
So we finally kill the queen like 10 minutes later and I can now choose my spawn. I spawn on the edge of the nuke zone but how I can only jump and rotate. It was as if my thumbstick stopped working. 
---
So I had to quit the game and lose all my junk from the queen and didnt get to loot her. But I got an assassins lead pipe from the event drop. :(
---
Or they are lying. Just like they swear up and down they got that much stuff from honest crafting. 
---
They just need to release private servers already. Let us make the game we would like to play!
---
Good to know as I've spec'd for one handed weapons, still swinging my ski sword variants.
---
BOY! GIRL!!!
---
Yeah dude I have a surplus of ammo and I only make it once every few days. They obviously don‚Äôt know about server hopping for mats either 
---
Woah, fascinating and original views!  Thanks for sharing!
---
Nuka Crypt
---
well if its like another ones as long as you have a blueprint then no fix will matter or stop you
---
Lol...
---
The road to irradiated hell is paved with good intentions and legendary lead pipes
---
Eh? Did you reply to the wrong person?
---
You would be surprised. Inventory management has always been a big selling point for RPGs. Traditionally it t makes you think strategically about what you keep and discard in the context of the game that eventually finishes. But in something like Fallout76 it's going to be a persistent problem as the game doesn't end. You will inevitably reach the limit even just by collecting legendary equipment. I doubt you could even hold one set of every power armor as pieces and weapons to go with them let alone amongst junk. 
---
I wish their were different boxes for different things not least because it's a pain to sift through it all in one box but because at least they could have different limits for diffetent item types.
---
some people aren't to smart
---
Judging by how the text chat mod works, no.
---
If there were an in-game chat, it'd have to work totally different to the mod, like a speech bubble over your character's head or something.
---
The way the chat mod is used right now is just like another discord but in-game. I've yet to see it used for character to character interactions.
---
Isn't an actual machine gun. It's a semi-auto (as in one trigger pull = one round) and simply belt fed. 
---
Nope, i remember making it last week i have a spreadsheet on my computer of all learned plans i don‚Äôt trust the system they have in place now im already hearing other bugs.  
---
Occasionally I will get this and am able to spam melee swings until I connect.
---
Also have experienced stagger, ‚Äúoof‚Äù, and bloody vision up to 3 minutes after a battle. I guess it is some kind of super lagged hit from previous encounter...
---
 Oh I do know you can stack stuff up. I prefer a balanced build and that's what I mostly do.  
---
 Still I have noticed I'm immune to 40mm and the possibilities might be really stupid. So I'm not averse to using the game mechanics. ;)
---
That happens to me all the time
---
Not asking for it to be a boss, just asking for loot on a rare spawn
---
You were hit first, you're in melee range. Every good melee character has high agility, ap refresh gear, and speed demon. You are within melee range until either you die or the person decides to go away. Your theoretical opportunity will never come
---
Not so good at taking the same kind of criticism you like to dish out on others and their work, are you?
---
they nerf'd cap stashes, so you would only be able to get caps from them every 24-48 hrs.  On top of that the reduced the % of what you would receive (even with Cap Collector Perk); sometimes I would get 1 cap with an opportunity to get more, but usually only 14- 15 caps on top of that.  All that being said, probably the best place to farm is Poseidon Energy Plant (outside area).  I have switched to gathering Golf outfits (skirts, pants, suits, etc...) at the Whitespring Golf Course - you can get 25-29 caps per golf outfit and there are quite a few in and around there.  Good Luck!
---
That's been my tactic as well. Also good for making caps.
---
I‚Äôve encounter people with vampire deathclaws to be deviating.
---
Personal fav , my ultracite lazer explosive pistol 
---
No, I get it...I just think they were meant to be a cool encounter, they should have better loot but I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the point on those two creatures. 
---
It's just a note. You can find them lying around the whitesprings bunker armory
---
I will be cosmetic after feb 4 for all matters the extra buff is crap and worthless if you ask me 
---
And with Scorched Earth, the quest is failed quite often due to bugs and shitty game mechanics making the massive resource use a total loss. 
---
Maybe it's a you think or a platform specific thing. I've seen workshops claimed by people and those people still be on the server.
---
Sucks that you're having that experience though.
---
no not really
---
nah, it NEVER worked the way you described
---
PREACH!!!!
---
Workshops are good if you have like 5 of them. But then you DC before you loot 
---
&gt; Does anyone else notice that venders cap pools timer got messed with? I swear it seems like I got two refreshes a day before the patch and now it's just one.
---
&gt; 
---
It was only supposed to be one day. Honestly, if it was two the 200 cap limit would be less annoying.
---
This might just help one of my classmates finally get ingame voice...
---
You know what‚Äôs so funny is that I expected him to be good and friendly. I saw him from a distance without hearing him (had the game muted) but I still waltzed up to him. You could imagine my joy when he started talking about his best friend Chally the Moo Moo. 
---
what quests? the same fetch n grab or eradication quests that are recycled for every damn quest in the game? wow. so entertaining. 
---
But it literally has! Also not all melee characters are good. Just like not all rifle builds are good.  I have been hit before , ran a short distance,  turn , jump, vats target head,  2 shots, 3rd vats crit and they go down.  This isn't every time, but a lot of the time. And if I do get killed and seek revenge it's very,  very easy to take them out from afar . 
---
Heavy combat armor plans I've never seen them.
---
Got one in Glassed Caverns. 
---
I'll give you 6 explosive vents and some t-60 plans if you need em. Haha
---
The guns are way too weak in this game. 
---
I really hope someone from Bethesda sees this exact comment....
---
needs to be at least 800-1000
---
I don't think it's worked the way you described, and it never worked that way when crafting ammo for example. It would give you double the base, not double the Ammosmith number. Super Duper procs first. 
---
Basing your argument on the fact that you can kill the weak, incompetent melee users is pretty baseless
---
Stalkers lever action with (+50% crit damage, 25% less vats cost). Awesome vats sniper weapon. 
---
Agreed. 
---
However you'll have fun doing it
---
you can, but id rather not post it on here
---
I somehow lost my BOS jumpsuit 30 something levels ago. Don't know if I dropped/scrapped/sold/glitched it, but it WAS at the top of my "apparel" list. Been farming relevant events ever since, to no avail. Sad...  
---
I guess mileage varies. I get legendary items of varying flavor when completing an event almost 50% of the time.
---
The plan can sometimes be found in Flatwoods at the armor crafting station at the building next to the church on the left as your facing the church, 
---
Why not? Lol. Are you going to get banned?
---
The PubG/Fortnite players aren‚Äôt even trying a Fallout PvP mode, it‚Äôs just not even close if that‚Äôs really what you‚Äôre looking for....
---
What a goofy post
---
\#meToo me, too.
---
platform? im interested
---
That's not a great idea. However, I think carry weight should be bumped up via Strength and a bit more in the stash. There's just so much stuff you can collect...especially if you want to keep a few items to trade/sell for later. I find myself having to sell items that another player could easily take advantage of (not to mention I could use their caps). Sorry bro...but yes, we need more stash/carry weight.
---
It sucks that you're having disconnects, but I don't think that's the case for everyone. I always claim a bunch of workshops every time I'm on, and I usually keep them all session with no issues. 
---
Technically, the armor system caps at 91% reduced damage, which is miserable. Past games capped at 80%, and that alone would do wonders for making the game not fell terrible.
---
I more feel enemy stats are too homogenous, almost all enemies have medium health, and medium high armor
---
There is no enemy that walks around with 100k armor and 100 hitpoints challenging you to find a way around his defenses, there are no enemies with no armor and a ton of hitpoints, which would make a minigun super useful.
---
They all fall into a narrow range of enough armor to negate most automatic weapons while being overcome by the hard hitter weapons relatively easily. Things like the super sledge practically trivialize armor, while on the other end the heavy weapons are all uphill. 
---
On the bright side, they still follow the same rules that we players do. The gutsies with laser weapons are harmless
---
Commenting for attention to OP. At the very least an in-game purchase to respec
---
Gotta be honest, my mark ass (along with everyone else that hasn‚Äôt given up yet) will be grinding every one of those boring dungeon crawls for that all black X-01 Paint ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Just kill low level muties in the Forest and Toxic Valley, they all have caps. 
---
I just want whatever gun they have. Or for "game balance" they need to be doing doodoo damage just like everyone else. It is obviously the most powerful in-game gun. gibs
---
is this your first fallout game?
---
Hmmm. I wonder if it will allow you to re learn it.
---
did they nerf stealth? 
---
I can kill a level 80 Scorchbeast in three hits... The tankiest and healthiest enemy in the game.
---
Im not basing it on the weak, I'm basing it in my experiences. Even with good melee users , it's all the same. I mean I guess I never met the BEST melee player, but there are numerous who get very angry when I take them down. I've also  talked to many after friendly pvp and they dont believe how they cant get to me. 
---
Dang for a second I thought that was a different language
---
I feel like every time I play, no matter what mission I‚Äôm working on or what location I‚Äôm in, a Scorchbeast shows up every time! I‚Äôm level 27 and I can‚Äôt beat that thing! So I just die, get frustrated and quit. 
---
I disagree. Some things should make you run away, no matter what you do to them, thats survival
---
I like that idea, according to the lore, the SB‚Äôs have been living in the cave systems below Appalachia forever 
---
But you can ... take the pieces off and sell or scrap them, then ditch the frame.
---
The game is still super fucking easy...
---
Wow pc I presume Xbox is totally different leveled a guys base ended with a 990 bounty so wow something needs to be changed there yes I own up to my bounty but 20 caps wtf really...
---
Wait for him to connect again to try follow him. It sucks, always store your arch until they fix this BS. If you see people at your camp, just leave, don't even wait to ask to see if they friendly .. it's sad but that's how we have to play for now .. people are dicks ..
---
+1. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. Or replay an old favorite. Bloodborne is great for this.
---
It's not the level difference, they are still that hard when you reach that level. It is the armor that becomes insane late game. At level 25 I was one shotting level 60 low armor targets. But even now at 50 I still barely scratch the heavy armor ones.
---
on Ps4 ID Dm-storm  
---
Jusy had a bunch of caps disappear. I had close to 1000 caps and sold a bunch of stuff at Morgantoen statin the FT to a team member who was near Charlseton then I noticed I only had 130 caps. I hadn't been doing any fast travelling for a while (I couldn't, I was overencumbered) and I didn't buy anything from the vendor. I had tasken a mental note of around how many caps I had while I was in Mogantown High school because I was going to give some to my friend but when I got there they were gone :( It took ages to save that many caps!!  I'm pretty annoyed right now.
---
Rose gives you a full raider set, and Belly of the Beast gives you a full Ultracite set. 
---
Any especially good spots? New Gad seems good but it is Scorched as much as it is mutants. Any guaranteed spawn points with high density?
---
I thought i was bad at hoarding in these games, but you guys literally never let go of anything. I was playing and i traded with someone and they had over 50 Rad X on him, tons of similar stacks. What do you all need with this much stuff? It‚Äôs so easy to get more stuff, let some of it go ffs! 
---
FTFY 100% Bethesda.
---
That sucks that its hella over hyped, we all know how lazy bethesda is. theres going to be a 30 minute quest with go fetch checkpoints.
---
melee is way to broken, i made a level 10 account with baseball bat modded and i can already kill level 40 dangerous ghouls at white spring in less than 10 hits without power armor
---
\*quite
---
I like all the "special" versions of junks, like the house teapot, the carlisle typewriter, the coffee tins (they were incredibly rare in fallout 4). It's too bad you have to fight the game to avoid scrapping them and you can't display your collection anywhere : (
---
God this needs to stop. I will have to make a video and link it here as a response later tonight/tomorrow morning of me killing things, quickly, with nothing but a non legendary combat rifle or handmade. Either all you people are exaggerating greatly or just really fucking bad at the game if you think stuff is that hard to kill.
---
If you look at a previous comment I made before this one I talk about the two already. Weird you didn‚Äôt see it considering. 
---
Whitesprings is probably the best place to level. Just run around the whole place several times catching the enemy respawns. There are usually high level people there so if you tag an enemy with one round while the higher level dudes do all the work, you can get loads of exp. Especially if the place gets nuked.
---
Well most recently, I had a workshop powered by a fusion generator. I had missile 
---
turrets all around the place, but the generator specifically was protected by a defense wall and I surrounded it with traps. 
---
Some mole rats appeared seemingly from nowhere around my generator and completely wrecked it in a matter of minutes. 
---
I don't have the materials to repair it because like, you know, I spent my budget building defenses for the place... which were supposed to prevent it from getting wrecked and it didn't. 
---
In a perfect world, I envisioned Vault 96 suddenly opening and unleashing hordes of GECK fueled Strangler Zombies flooding into West Virginia....
---
That happens to me but I don‚Äôt take damage I just get stunned 
---
i have dense and fireproof maxed out. I can stand in front of 8 explosive pump action shotgun shots with 0 dmg, but i do get broken body parts, and I can strall under scorth beasts ranged attacks. I honestly just walk by them now zero fucks given.
---
It's a temporary bonus that will be taken away, and I actually do kinda think that running around in superhero costumes would be fun. I don't even think people took advantage of it, since you can't benefit in a nuke zone and large scale PvP isn't much of a thing
---
Your either lying or exaggerating. Frankly I‚Äôm getting sick of seeing these kind of claims. 
---
I‚Äôve claimed plenty of workshops and never once had this happen. If it was such a problem I would have experienced it at least a couple times.
---
Guilty until proven innocent
---
spoiler: none of that 
---
Hm didn't realize peeps went that far bankruptcy is when I'm done....
---
I agree..its tedious and more time consuming. Everytime they issue a patch, they sneak in a few nerfs designed to slow down player progression. I typically see "monster x now gives y less experience than before" or "weapon x now does y percentage less damage", etc. 
---
I spend half my time doing inventory management and making sure I have several gallons of soup and an entire refrigerator worth of food before heading out. Not to mention crafting ammo. 
---
I have a full time job and  frequently work overtime. At most I have an hour or two each night to play and it's starting to feel repetitive and not fun. Especially with the re-curring server disconnects. 
---
Time to play other new games I guess..
---
I know that when the Targeting HUD glitch was affecting me I got a lot of crashes near workshops I had taken. By any chance are you in PA with the Targeting HUD mod installed?
---
My favorite part of the latest patch is that it re-introduced previous bugs that were supposed to be fixed.
---
I would agree for the most part although I have no trouble with ammo. You can easily craft thousands of rounds of ammunition without much effort. 
---
Wait, so it's not just me thinking fusion cores aren't lasting nearly as long anymore?  I'm burning through them to the point where I'm almost out, and not finding them anywhere.  I can do workshops to get them I suppose, but I'd prefer that to be a weekly event, not every day or two.
---
Yeah, I'm not doing either.  I have no reason to lie about some gripe. And no, I'm not exaggerating at all. But that's cool man you go on believing what you want to. 
---
And as for your input. Great. I'm glad you are enjoying this game. That's cool. And as for what you're sick of, I don't give a shit.
---
Hope that it‚Äôll improve.
---
The story in previous games was much longer and engaging though. At least it felt that way. This game feels like it‚Äôs missing the key aspects that make a multiplayer game great while simultaneously missing the key aspects of a single player game.
---
I was okay with it being a fallout 4 clone with multiplayer, but seeing the lack of content really makes me question the $79.99 price tag, especially given the bugs and the price drop two weeks after release.
---
It‚Äôs about the principle of the matter. I personally never got shot at by a team of superheroes, I doubt almost anyone did, but it‚Äôs more about Bethesda‚Äôs failure to keep their word than the shit tier bonus to health those costumes gave.
---
I was about to say yes. But the only one I found was the chess piece 5% accuracy so I don't know
---
I ran into that thing while looking for the bunkers. It popped up out o nowhere. Literally I was about to go into the bunker, I turned around for no particular reason and it was standing there. It wasn't a bad fight. Not terribly easy. Not hard. No loot worth taking. 
---
They're cool. 
---
I can‚Äôt get my weight even remotely near the limit, so I‚Äôm always slow-walking the map. Haven‚Äôt fast travelled since day 1, in L60.
---
That's not true. I used to get 4.
---
I sometimes get this it may be starvation or dehydration. At least that's what happened to me.... and it put a directional damage indicator like an enemy was hitting me.
---
I lost 18 points on All Rise. Not as pronounced a loss as you saw, but it did drop. 
---
Or should I just server hop and that will fix it? Let me know if it‚Äôs happened to you.. üòê
---
If I build it I will post it up on reddit. Otherwise you can see it on pc.
---
Counterpoint in loot driven games like this bulletsponge enemies are kind of a necessity. I mean the basic loot is to get better loot to kill sponge enemies faster which drop better loot to kill other sponge enemies faster and so on so forth. 
---
Ultimately this game is kinda sort in the looter shooter genre and unfortunately bulletsponge enemies are kind of a necessity.    
---
Right?!
---
Harper's Ferry and/or Watoga train station since the latest.

"Buy this controller and get a free copy of Fallout 76!"
---
"Oh, uh, can I just get the control?"
---
Let me upgrade it or something, because I can't just get rid of weapons I've only come across once because they weight a little too much in my stash.
---
That cane does more damage than half the two shot explosives these days anyhow üòÇ
---
WV Lumber at the top left of the map. 
---
Kill em, take their caps, then take their guns and sell those for even more caps.
---
I see your 6 explosive vents and t-60 plans and raise you 27 ivory grip revolver plans and 97 chemistry benches.
---
First, take some Ambien. It‚Äôs hard to feel pain on that. Remember to hide your car keys first otherwise you might buy 56 goldfish and a 100 gallon tank for them and not remember doing it later.
---
If you're in the event, it simply respawns you at least some of the time.  Whenever you could have been stimmed, maybe?
---
Yes.. Frequently since the latest patch. 
---
It's so sad that this statement is factual.
---
lol
---
Soldier 76 reporting for... wait a minute 
---
My best legendary drop in 83 levels is a bloodied nocturnal boxing glove.
---
That's what happens when you leave off a / in a sentence. :)
---
There are many similar posts. Most I've seen are ranged weapons, but it appears something is broken with damage and it fluctuates (even lower than minimum, unperked damage I've seen).
---
@Bethesda we want answers!!  üò°
---
Damn, I remember that place! Good call!
---
WV lumber mill in the far northwest, and the penitentiary would be high density. I don't think they get above level 20-ish. 
---
There's several items that aren't bulkable. Make it so we can and improve the weight reduction for bulked items. That would solve a lot of it.
---
I gotta ask, why are you spending five days server-hopping for shocks?  How is that a good use of your time?  Why'd you keep going?
---
You are spending your time unwisely and blaming the game.  I have zero trouble maintaining my armor, weapons, and ammo with junk I pick up as I play.  Stop trying to ice-skate uphill.
---
Because firing them is fun. Not everybody buys guns for self defense. A lot of people simply enjoy target shooting. 
---
Wholeheartedly agree on both accounts.
---
We have a few deviations in the game - the various shelled mirelurks are a step in the hard-armor-low-health direction if still average. They could have makde mirelurk spawn extra-hard but also extra-low-health. 
---
Heart of the Swamp flower thing, whatever it's called, could have been the other end of the spectrum. 
---
thats a beautiful camp. Mines the usual box with turrets and crafting benches.
---
Shitty internet here, it's faster and more convenient for me to go buy a physical copy an hour away than to even attempt to go digital.
---
I have a ton of scrap, that kinda takes up most of my storage.

The good old "world hunger doesn't exist because I've never missed a meal" attitude.
---
Ironically i often dont have stuff like aluminum and circuitry
---
Hmm....I thought my 181 hatchet was a figment of my imagination 
---
think its a random spawn in the train yard near watoga.
---
Thats the last thing i wanna fight...
---
This is a fantastic idea
---
Its an MMO.
---
MMO's require tedious work and grinding
---
It's like people have never played an MMO before.
---
Word to the wise never cuss in direct or voice messages it is a good way to get yourself into some crap.
---
Then your testing as you claim is probable once or twice having it happen. 
---
It‚Äôs like the guy that claimed he got disconnected 43 times in one session. He insisted he counted and wasn‚Äôt lying. But wouldn‚Äôt tell how long that session was. 
---
Even if it was something like 8 hours that would still mean he was getting disconnected every 11 minutes. 
---
So he wants us to think he literally spent 8 hours getting on and then disconnected? No sorry don‚Äôt believe it.
---
It‚Äôs amazing how people only seem to get disconnected after taking over a workshop, launching a nuke or finally killing the SBQ bit just before they can loot her.
---
Never, I was just running fine one place or another and I got disconnected.
---
And yet, when other people say, I‚Äôm not having this problem, no one wants to believe them. Oh no the only ones that could possible be telling the truth and not exaggerating even a little bit are people who have problems with the game.
---
You all have such similar stories and always the same ‚ÄúI tested‚Äù it with no proof. I mean if you set out yo test it, why not also get proof st the same time?
---
Nah, just keep building it.  You'll massage the character over time anyway.  You can eventually get every single card possible so just do that.  Right now I'm working on getting every range weapon card for increased damage so I can just swap around what gun I want to use whenever I want.
---
Do mole  rats or burrowing creatures spawn INSIDE your base with your layout? I've seen molerats spawn on roofs to get at turrets...
---
This x 100.  VATS the thrusters, 1-2 hits will drop even the highest Col. Gutsies.
---
It‚Äôs awesome and gorgeous but suffers from that shiny flawless aesthetic.  I find myself really drawn to the worn and weathered shit in Fallout for some reason. 
---
It leads to a dangerous road:
---
E.g., https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3xjcra/is_there_any_addon_to_filter_chat_messages_and/?st=JRR75H3O&amp;sh=d807b519
---
I honestly spend most of my time in that game hunting, fishing, and staring at the scenery 
---
as in it did way more than 181 yesterday??  lol 
---
You're making an argument that value in a trade is relative to the individuals involved and their circumstances. Individual circumstances are relevant to trade value, yes, but you're talking about how trade value varies based on these relevant factors--in other words, you're explaining the idea that value is relative.
---
yep
---
TS Harpoon.  It‚Äôs the flechettes that make it a winner.  So low tech and slow, but a litteral blast.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind faster reload....
---
That‚Äôs nice. But I don‚Äôt believe you. Every post I‚Äôve seen testing it said 3 was max and I the first post I saw like that was fairly early after release. Plus I personally confirmed it for myself months ago.
---
Every patch there‚Äôs a host of wild claims of sneaky nerfs that later get proven wrong. So sorry, I‚Äôm not gonna blindly believe reports like this without more.
---
It is not just you.  My axe fell from 284 to 202
---
Yep, I've jumped to all vendors dozens of times since the patch and the BOS Combat Armor plans no longer seem to spawn.  
---
(They used to spawn at Grafton RR).
---
I don't think so yet, farm out bos heavy combat armor with either vanguard or sentinels perks to beat out power armor
---
Depends a lot. Saturday I disconnected 3 times in the first 20 mins of play. After that no disconnects. I had Poseidon, Monaghan, and Jorge junkyard for about 6 hours of collecting, defending for plans and goodies. In between I went off and ran a few areas for scrapping goodness and got a few quests done. It was very productive and I am only lvl 34.
---
Fought some super mutants.   Feels like it‚Äôs doing the same amount of damage honestly.   Maybe a visual glitch?
---
Exactly its infuriating that they didnt think about this. They 100 percent did not even think about  things in the game meant for grinding. Like I would 100 percent repeat a dungeon or a mission (like silos) that I could do every day and get results even if they're isolated. Like I get 2k caps for running through a 2 hour long area, but instead apparently it's much more fun to just run through areas and farm cap stashes. Hell I'd even put up with pvp if there was a workshop in the nuka plant that made caps. But again no bethesda will probably just want to nerf the existing workshops a few more eventually  making them cost 1k caps to claim to "balance the ingame economy" 
---
Yeah was over 2 hundo 
---
I can only play Fallout 4 on Survival for this exact reason. 2-shotting alpha deathclaws with my legendary anti-materiel rifle feels so good. It's even better knowing that if I miss a single shot and let them close the distance, I'm dead and I deserved it.
---
Yea it sucks. I blew through 42 stimpacks(non pa build light weight sneak) while they only used 7 or 8 to combat the assaultrons and gustys
---
No, more like, gee, your story sounds a lot like all these other stories. That lack any evidence. Like how this guy set out to test it and up, every time, disconnected. 
---
Why if you set  out to test it, why didnt you also get some proof to back up your claim.
---
Like all the, I was robbed while trading post, that all turned out to be lies. Or any of the countless bullshit people have made up.
---
Sorry, it's just way to convient of a story. I set out to test this, and up every single time! Oh I don't have any proof, just take my word for it.
---
In addition to zapping mobs, it also rebounds off walls, which makes it a great weapon for killing what you can't see, especially in confined spaces like West-Tek.
---
If you know where they are or stumble across them. Absent that and it very much is pay to win.
---
I like the random üíé in the rough look like a well preserved relic from before the war on occasion think its kinda dumb it doesn't work for all 44's I really don't wanna buy the same skin 4 times over for pretty much the same üî´.

Dude if you get melee nerfed we gonna fight. I‚Äôve played every fallout as an OP drugged up barbarian. I‚Äôm not about to stop now.
---
That sucks man! Id be done too lol, I'm on PS4 also, fingers crossed I never have a night like yours 
---
Since nothing in the game is officially documented, I doubt even Beth knows what they actually intended.  So who knows?  Agree it is frustrating.
---
I actually LIKE the fact the Gutsies are terrifying and brutally effective.  I like kiting SB's into packs of Gutsies and watching them rip into the SB like a school of pinrahas on a bleeding ox.  It's the simple things in life that amuse me.
---
Fo76 has rekindled my love and appreciation for Monster Hunter World and for that I am grateful. 
---
damn that is cool to know I have like 4,000 5.56 rounds and nothing to really fire them out of lmao
---
Hate this. Been looking for BOS Combat Armor Legs forever and now it seems impossible.
---
I‚Äôve scrapped close to 400 pieces of combat armor at this point, and I swear I saw BOS legs pop up like I‚Äôd learned it, but I still can‚Äôt apply it. It‚Äôs like an itch that won‚Äôt go away.
---
Zero information in patch notes about this particular change too. It seems that any mod that *could* be learned via scrapping is no longer sold at any vendor.
---
You should try harder. Next time you have a thought, let it go. 
---
I've killed about 70 glowing creatures, at least and not one has produced High-Radiation Fluids. Apparently irradiated blood isn't counted. I have been trying to create stabilised flux since the beginning of the game and I'm level 55. Is this designed to ensure no one gets to have a jet-pack?  If that's the case, it's a con. 
---
You‚Äôre assuming there‚Äôs not a db entry for each steel.
---
Idk why you‚Äôre downvoted. This is fallout. Melee builds have always been a strong option and just as good as ranged options. Bethesda really shouldn‚Äôt be favoring any specific builds and should balance them so that they‚Äôre all viable. 
---
I don't think the griefer looses any caps....
---
But you are 100% right. The PvP doesn't make any sense in this game at all.
---
Pretty much. BoS combat armor plans are a great example of this. Supposedly all plans in the vendors? Hah! I knew they‚Äôd screw this one up too. Who knows what all else used to be in vendor lists but now isn‚Äôt?
---
Yes. Me and my friends had Grahm once, and some guy was freaking out, because he wanted Grahm. I've even had people come in when I'm waiting for the vendor because someone else is using it, and position themselves in front of me to line jump in a way. 
---
Lighten up assholes, you'll get your turn. 
---
Oh you can. I didn't get a pic but we got up to the very top lol
---
Def thought for a second that people were approaching you like "hey baybeh, come 'ere often? ;)"
---
I was mistaken.

This game will never work as a pvp.  Should have been 2-4 or 4-8 co op.  The ability to share resources and combine camps and build multiple camps around the world.  No NPCs is an epic fail.  What is the point of leaving the vault to rebuild the world that no one lives in.  I would make more sense to return to the clean vault with fancy beds and radiation free food.  
---
Is it broken, or is it another of Bethesda's famous Stealth Nerfs‚Ñ¢?
---
It's one of the reasons I always had a mod that doubled or tripled damage output from myself and enemies, especially in survival mode, its kill fast or die fast and headshots really mattered, I can't do that in 76, at least not yet and it's really made combat a drag.
---
Scratch that, I did get a pic lol.

Just marsupial and jetpack and strange in numbers.
---
I have not been able to find the chainsaw flamer mod since the patch to vendors.  
---
Relevant factors = relative value? Weird flex, but okay. In your terms I would say that the guy that sells a core for 500 caps to the desperate player would then say that because he has sold it for 500 before he would expect to get something similar next time, ie a relative number. But that's not, imo, the best way to look at it. Instead it should be based on what I have vs what I need. I am willing to pay 500 caps for 1000 rounds of 5.56 ammo because I need it, but will sell 5000 rounds of 5mm for 100 caps because I dont need the ammo or the caps. It's based on here and now, not there and before.
---
I spent the last part of my night today crafting/scrapping leather (so much easier than combat arms, fully perked you only lose 1 steel per craft, sometimes you actually gain if Super Duper procs) and ended up finally getting studded mod for all my leather pieces.
---
So now I'm Deep Pocketed Studded Heavy Leather Arms/Legs.  And Deep Pocketed BOS Heavy Combat Armor Torso.  Guess that's as good as I get from just crafting.  Time to move on.
---
Just leave them be. Obviously he's better because he has more time played? He shouldn't be able to kill you without you or your group attacking him. So either he's doing something he shouldn't or y'all accidentally hit back. 
---
So do you really think a cheater would report you? Yeah they probably will but I wouldnt worry about it. You did nothing too wrong. Just don't follow next time that's what they like. 
---
imo..they are testing the waters for more things like this and if it got them desired effect... more p2w will come. wait and see.
---
Yep I block and report anyone who does this, doesn't happen often, but they going to get two blocks and reports, and if they have friends, they will get it as well
---
I did Queen of the Hunt several times.  Now it no longer appears.  Same for Heart of the Enemy, did it a couple times and now nothing.  Terminal/Notes don't do anything.  So you add in Dailies that don't appear any more, bugged dailies like Cop a Squatter, the meh rewards from some, the what I can only assume are bugged rewards on some and there's just very little to do.  Roam around hoping to find a legendary then hoping it doesn't drop a 1* nocturnal wood leg.
---
And I say all that still logging on every night and wanting to play.
---
It is a documented bug: v small chance for a cosmetic, but then they all drop together (from that group.). There is a big datamined spreadsheet on this sub you can search for with all the cosmetics and how they drop.
---
Yeah, fast traveling into areas like Poseidon Energy Plant, Camp Venture, Morgan Town Trainyard I'm being spotted now, which had never happened before the patch and I'm AGI 15, fully perked into stealth  with Shrouded wood. Also you shoot one enemy fully hidden and suddenly everyone comes running. It feels like the stealth perk is being completely disregarded. I am crouched 90% of my game play and this patch sucks for my build.
---
Haven‚Äôt had that myself they might be hassling you as a joke man idk 
---
Do this and move your camp to a more secluded or hard to reach place. Should minimize the chances of people finding your place 
---
Lol stalking, they don‚Äôt lift their finger for anything so I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôd do it for ‚Äústalking.‚Äù 
---
Besides, true stalking is finding out where they live, hovering over them while they sleep and breathing heavily over them. Then take a pic and mail to them later with a note announcing your friendly intentions, like ‚ÄúI know what you ate for dessert last summer‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can run but you can‚Äôt hide bitch!‚Äù
---
Vendor cap limit should be raised, or vendor system reworked. and equipped weight perks should apply to stash.
---
This. Take them away and there will be no challenge left
---
ok so it‚Äôs obvi not just me.  
---
Yeah the handmade two shot is pretty dope, save those rounds.
---
Are you sure it's not just theirs?  Every Stash is just a link to their personal player stash, even if it's in your camp.
---
I'm curious if you decide to find out for yourself how it works and if it stacks like in FO4. Let us know, wouldja?
---
Look, if I'm using a vendor, I know you're there.  You're either clomping up in Power Armor or shuffling around.  I'll be done in a second.  There's no need to hop around like a hyena.
---
No. They aren‚Äôt I‚Äôm sure of
---
Well have you checked around the trash can for The Snipe? It‚Äôs a magical critter that will protect your stash box..have you looked for it?
---
This is the wrong place. Please open a support ticket for this. 
---
If I figure it out, you betcha!
---
Melee has always been a core part of fallout games and should continue being a strong build choice, definitely nothing wrong with it continuing to be such. They need to bring guns up to par with melee, especially energy weapons and big guns, but once there there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it being just as good as guns.
---
Im on ps4 too.  Few friends took some workshops yesterday and today.  All 4 of us were kicked a few minutes after building all the equipment. And powering everything up.  Only one of the 6 or 7 dc's did one of us not get kicked and the workshop defaulted over to a party member.
---
but have you seen them since the patch to vendors
---
So you lost about the same amount of damage as I did.   Just over 80.  Have you fought some mutants or anything?   Just to see if it feels the same?   My sledge still seems to do the same damage........  I think......
---
That sounds like a no then. 
---
I have an anti armor lever action and run max tank killer so power armor is like shooting paper for me
---
Sadly, I wish that more often
---
This a million times this. If they could fix this crap I'd probably be tempted to get back to playing the game with my friend even with lack of content. The thing that pissed me off the most was reaching level 50 only to find my favorite weapons, both energy and heavy, were garbage and that I HAD to use melee or waste 50 hours a week farming mats for ammo and the ability to repair my rifles all for 3 scorch beasts to spawn and me to blow through all of it with nothing to show. I love plasma weapons I'd love to have a plasma rifle build as well as a heavy weapons build. But because of the things you've stated I now know why it's not possible. Thank you so much for your work. Let's hope they see this of nothing else. 
---
Stimpaks count, yes. Any chem. And it heals when you exit ‚Äúcombat.‚Äù You are considered in combat if an enemy is active fighting you or looking for you. In short, if you crouch and it says Caution or Danger at the top of the screen.
---
I am about to have every level of rifleman unlocked so a semi auto two shot Handmade should be pretty nice.
---
Yeah I asked them 
---
Did the same around the golf club two weeks ago.
---
There was a turret camp so I killed all the turrets.
---
Two teamed players then hunted me and we spent an hour two playing hide and seek with me killing them over and over with my anti armour lever rifle...but I never took their stuff because...reasons.
---
Eventually I have to go so I undress and start attacking them with my ripper so they can kill me.
---
They kill me, leave my stuff for me and we all try to give each other materials and meds before I end the Canadian stand off by taking all the bags and logging off
---
That would be great, although I would suggest the damage scaling should be based on the weapon's main stat, heavy guns strength, shotguns strength, rifles perception pistols agility, so builds aren't stuck needing a higher special stat they aren't going to be able to use many perks in. Also you're describing how luck worked before Fallout 3 :)
---
I just hope it doesn‚Äôt keep happening 
---
I kinda fear the patch killed them off the vendor list.  Might have to get them off rewards or government supply drops if they have not been ousted from there as well.  
---
I‚Äôd like to know as well! I was sad to find out the levels capped at 15...
---
I've been seriously considering going back to fallout 4. It was way more fun. 
---
Some say they are still server hopping to this day. 
---
This, I have no issue working and grinding for things I want but I hate to constantly get butt fucked by RNGesus. So many dupe plans after hours of grinding, never getting my prize.
---
It's a badly designed sink. Fo76 is a master class in how to design sinks badly. 
---
Games gones to ish. Id settle for the release we had in december.
---
This is why people are still playing. I could play this game without quests. 
---
It's a fun world just everything else sucks.
---
Pretty sure they are just fucking with you.
---
I‚Äôll look into it üôÑ
---
If it was outside the back door to the golf club or next to the Charleston train station I may have leveled your shit.  
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, I‚Äôll throw you a handful
---
It‚Äôs annoying. Makes me wish I didn‚Äôt have so many points in Charisma. It‚Äôs not my fault I‚Äôm so beautiful. I do it to share perks.
---
Doing AWOL armaments is a bitch. Taking on a Mr Gutsy 1v1, fair enough, but 3+ is stupid. Getting ripped to pieces while in PA (I'm lvl 135) and having to melee them while they zip around because your ranged weapons don't do shit to them. 
---
Well I really hope that is the case.
---
Idiot kids with no patience.
---
Unyielding and nerd rage plus stat bonus gear
---
'merica 
---
I don‚Äôt have nerd rage but I should
---
MOST of it is my unyielding gear, as it fluctuates WILDLY with my health
---
Have been hoping to see something as well. Created my main char as a Chinese spy/infiltrator and I have been hoping to get some stuff from the atom store like a clean Chinese Flag, a cheongsam skin for the red dress or a Chinese/PLA themed skin for Power Armor.. I had read that Chinese New Year is on the 5th so I hope we see something tomorrow.
---
Craft it at the armor workbench
---
Hate line jumpers.
---
Nah you can kill people if they don't initiate a fight, altho you might break a weapon a weopon or two trying to.
---
Max out class freak and the stims will still heal you well enough. The mutation works like the legendary armor effect that regains health but it works much faster. When your out of combat you heal to max health very fast.
---
Im on ps4 and this has happened to me and the guys I group up with 4 times today and at least 3 or 4 yesterday.  We also tried to launch twice and the game crashed after finally getting to the terminal to launch the nuke.  It would kick us 1 at a time and everyone would have to repeat the insanely stupid process of getting back in even while everyone else was still at the terminal.  Gets pointless after scanning yourself for the 5th fucking time.
---
I sit in the seats usually and talk to the back of their heads. 
---
Hmm, then it is probably your drivers. If you don't know what they are you probably havent updated them for a long time. How long ago did you get your latest graphics card/computer?  
---
First you have to check what graphics card you have. When you have the graphics card name, google the name and "driver" and you should find an official site with the driver. Some graphics cards come with built-in software that install drivers for you, for example Nvidia, in which case you won't need to install it manually. So check what graphics card you have first.
---
Need rage is a must 
---
Bro you're like 3 months late 
---
Can I buy it
---
How long did it take him lolz
---
Bye
---
I have lost count of the amount of times I've been killed in Pacifist mode. And before you say workshops are PVP areas blah blah blah, if thats the case, Pacifist should be disabled while in a Workshop area. Getting killed while not being able to fight because Pacifist is turned on is not PVP.
---
this worked for me too
---
The difference between melee and ranged fighting is melee has to tank incoming damage while they close the distance, and then are limited by slow swings even on fast melee weapons. You could dump an entire mag from a handmade into them before they close the gap. The high damage output is necessary for survivability because of the damage taken. They NEED to end the fight fast.
---
Or so I am guessing since I don't use melee at all unless I'm running around the forest. 
---
I've always felt that instead of a direct damage increase to ranged weapons with higher perception, that it should instead increase the range at which you do maximum damage. Then you can engage further targets at safer distance.
---
This is what I mean by not optimized, lol I‚Äôm about level 53
---
happens 4/5 times for me, the other 1/5 times i get a bugged out screenshot of the world i definitely did not take or one of the stock ones
---
Can you add pvp server perks where if you equip it we can sense nearby players (assuming we won't be able to see them on the map) so this guy can hunt people.
---
Mega sloth...lol.  
---
tbh i stopped playing due to lack of end game content like im at the point where i run around and kill people
---
Could had a rollback.
---
So at the end of the glassed mine before ya go up the elevator theres a bacpack off to the side near some glowing ultracite.
---
I might do that.   The ‚Äò@‚Äò was kinda a joke.  
---
Have you even played other fallout games? Melee has always ranged from viable to OP. There‚Äôs no logical reason you could have that‚Äôd call for nerfing melee. Ranged should be buffed but leave melee alone. They need to work towards build diversity not continue gutting it.
---
Dunno what you're talking about. My supersledge is quite ammo efficient, and I've never met sledgesponge enemies so far.
---
I understand blocking then but what are you reporting for? What have they actually done report worthy?
---
On the way
---
wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äòsettling‚Äô.   
---
Playing with people is alot of fun. Fallout 76 has alot of good things going on, just overshadowed by bugs and people complaining about tse nerf (we all knew that was coming let's be real)
---
What level are you, once your fully perked into the stealth and rifle build your armor def shouldn't matter in most cases? 
---
Most of the time I'm in wood because I'm killing enemies long before they get to me, so my armor def doesn't matter. I do keep a backup set of Combat armor in case things get hairy, but if your methodical in picking a good spot to clear a room/area from you rarely get hit.
---
I think lower level 20s were some of the roughest for the build, but once you have sneak 3, some riflemans perks, and a lever action rifle it gets pretty easy.
---
Why on earth would you need that many? I have 3 of the biggest water purifiers and I am constantly hitting 300 water and dumping it.
---
I dont think you shouldnt be able to remove them. If youve invested the point, it should effect STASH. If you want it to effect carry weight, equip it.
---
If someone is taking too long I usually fast travel to another vendor. Unless it's watoga station, then I wait. One time I was waiting a good 2-3 minutes. Really ticked me off. Thought really hard about smacking them. Then some watoga bots came in and started attacking them. I laughed and did nothing. Let them deal with the bots. Even waited to let them go back to whatever was taking forever. Then the vendor bot glitched out trying to get out of its prison to hit something. Went outside and couldn't find anything nearby. -_- had to server hop. Bah
---
Theres just to many people that want to complain to reddit about bugs and this isnt really the place. You just see people repeating the same bugs are happening. 
---
So just open a support ticket. This game has bugs we all know. We just want them fixed. 
---
I haven't played since that most recent broken update.  
---
Strangely, I haven't missed playing it either...
---
I srsly think they lied about Windows 7 being supported for this game. I legit had so many problems. Right out of the box it stuttered and I frustratingly keep trying to fix it, until I gave up. Stated to become a problem when I hit lvl 25 as I couldn't hit anything from the stuttering and the mobs were finally starting to get dangerous for me. A friend suggested trying Windows 10. Its running almost perfectly now. Have it on ultra settings and barely any problems with the frame rates.
---
Course now I have to pay $200 to Microsoft (and whatever other info theyre stealing with the OS) to play just this one game. @.@ its the only game thats having any problems too.
---
&gt; The game designers at Beth have been running around like chickens with their heads cut off 
---
Yep, this is how this game's done
---
can you accept my team invite ? for the free fast travel ;) 
---
i've picked up ap regen chest 
---
I already had this happen to me in November. 
---
You obviously don't have a dragon. I have a instigating dragon, a tse, and a stalkers. The stalkers exploding is the crazy one of the three. With the dragons 400 range in vats, you can get headshots while hidden for the 2.5x. They did mess with sneak though so it's not perfect. Some reason in vats they notice you sometimes since last patch, which negates stalkers.
---
Instigating does exactly what it's supposed to if they full (and no missing like the tse). Anything with 2 shot has bad accuracy in vats I noticed. It was like that before the patch too.
---
I use the insta on the nuclear card cargobot too.. It's still a one hit manually aimed. There's things called perk cards.
---
Schweet, congrats!! I just launched my first today as well! Solo. Was gonna fast travel to see it land, now I‚Äôve been stuck with a losing screen for 10 minutes. 
---
Well, at least I‚Äôve figured out How to launch :). 
---
This game is essentiallu FTP now, how the fuck cares anymore?
---
Not sure if I grabbed it. Do you remember the name of the holotape so I can check my stash? 
---
Buildings? That's nothing. I was in a mine and a scorchbeast was *below* me occasionally i could see it's wings pop out the floor and it was still blanketing me with that green shit they crap out. 
---
Most likely
---
\^ what this guy said
---
Send it
---
That math doesn‚Äôt make sense.  15 base.  15 unyielding.  5 radicool.  How are you getting the other 13?
---
Berry mentats make them give off a reddish smoke, flatwooda monster makes them turn purplish.
---
I agree, with fallout 4 I played through the game at least 10 times to get the full potential out of the main quest line, with 76 I haven‚Äôt completed the main quest line, from what it feels like, once.
---
By lakeside cabins now 
---
Great post.
---
you‚Äôre very right.   I see the same complaints over and over.  And Bethesda responds to very few.   You got a link?   I‚Äôm sure I could find it if I needed too myself actually. 
---
Mega sloth.  I have some advice.  Look in the nearest mirror, then slap the shit out of the moron looking at you.  He is a complete moron an in all likelihood will make your like very difficult.  He thinks he is the savant in the room, but in reality he is just way too fucking dumb to realize he is the idiot at the table.  He will appreciate you repeating this process daily until he either realizes something is drastically wrong or becomes braon dead.
---
How do you get mutations? 
---
We have a category on XB called Unsupported Behavior 
---
I had a vendor issue yesterday where Harpers Ferry bot and Grahm shared inventory - I was so excited when he turned up at Harpers really close to the vendor so when I had finished with the main vendor I sprinted over only to find his pool was identical, caps all gone same as the other guy, despite being ‚Äúunique‚Äù. Friend who was with me at the time didn‚Äôt have the issue.
---
It has survival aspects. It‚Äôs not strictly survival, think outside the box please. It‚Äôs a multiplayer rpg looter shooter with survival aspects. If you want strictly survival go play something else, if not then stay in the forest area and do your survival there. They never claimed it‚Äôs solely survival, they said they‚Äôre including it. 
---
For anyone who comes across my camp since I‚Äôm near whitesprings station. Sometimes sell them to vendors too. If I could find a nice spot of flattish land near water and close to whitesprings I‚Äôd do the big purifiers but don‚Äôt those only get 5 at a time?
---
About like 3 minutes I wasn't gonna waste food, water, or stimpacks so I just didn't heal at all
---
I cannot wait to go try these fantastic techniques. Thanks for sharing!!
---
Like 3 or 4 times.
---
That‚Äôs such a low number you should be able to remember which it was. More so since it was only yesterday. And your so positive about it always happening.
---
See this is what‚Äôs so amazing about all these tests and I‚Äôm so positive and I counted.
---
Your so absolutely convinced these things happen. And yet you clearly keeping doing the same thing over and over.
---
Sometimes for hours on end. 
---
If you are so sure this will happen every single time, why spend hours doing the same thing only to get the same results?
---
See why I think it‚Äôs a bunch of lies and exaggerations, you want people to believe you. Yet that would mean we also have to believe that your willing to sit there for hours playing a game that is literally not working. But not working just got you.
---
It was definitely one of the best I've even been to, not that I'm biased or anything. \^\_\^ 
---
C'mon guys........ "it just works"
---
I was doing something similar. I was making ridiculous amounts of diluted stimpaks radx and radaway. Had 1k stims and 650 radaway the other day 
---
Just google bethesda support ticket. I'm on mobile.
---
Have you already hit it in the last 24 hours? I know Morgantown high and Charleston Fire House always take a day to regen for me regardless of how many times I server hop. 
---
Any way I can help Chally the Moo Moo have her best life is something I can get behind.
---
Maybe like 3 minutes, I didn't wanna waste stimpacks, food, or water so I just didn't heal at all
---
I always thought it was a stupid idea for them not to utilized the vault as a player hub... We need PvE servers.
---
I'm around a level 77 and still enjoying the shit out of the game. To hell with all the crybaby tryhards.
---
I got the same day like that and pretty much the same gear as well
---
Take a break. Hug your family. Create a new character with a different play style.
---
What level was he. Y'all shoulda ganged up on him lol
---
LOL. Omg someone insulted me on the internet! 
---
Why don't you go ask mom for a pudding snack and take a time out. 
---
Then have her change your diapers. 
---
Yes to fridge. My restaurant will finally open. 
---
says you‚Äôre not accepting team invites 
---
I have not no, in the past if it was empty hopping would refill it but not today, I haven't played in a week or so and I know there was 2 patches in between there
---
Yeah they get 5 at a time I just think there may be a cap on how much you can create at a single base most I've seen work is about 6 purifiers at a time though.
---
Congrats. Are you planning on a hardened or automatic receiver build?
---
I'm not banned and when I tried to submit another ticket for feedback about another bug last month, the website was just and endless loading spinny icon thing and it never submitted my ticket. I'm sure I am not banned because I logged on to the game after that and I've never gotten an email about a ban since I uninstalled. So yea, I believe people when they say they have problems with customer support tickets and the website itself. Same customer support website that had the information leak, which we only heard about because multiple other players posted on social media about it.
---
People are angry that they're making things to make money off of, when they should be spending the effort to fix the stuff people already paid for.
---
It's kinds like buying a Corvette, but finding out that they put a Prius under the hood. They keep telling ya theyre gonna fix the internals, but if ya want you can totally buy this new color coat for 1/4 the price you paid for the car.
---
Oh and then on top of that, you can't get a refund, and everyone around you is buying the same car for 50-75% what you paid.
---
I would like an inside corner roof panel.  How is this still not an option.  You want an L shaped room or building its gonna cost you an extra 5 build pieces to close the hole in the ceiling instead of one inside corner.
---
Sorry not sure then. I don‚Äôt have any inside info, I only know how it normally works for me. Good luck. 
---
I've decided to buy the most recent God of War and play it in the meantime. I'm sure Bethesda will eventually add more too the game.
---
I was thinking the same thing, way more fun to be had in fo4. Plus there's no Nick Valentine in fo76
---
He was level 30 with a Deathclaw Gauntlet, so I knew if we shot back we'd all die
---
Well damn. There go my dreams of drowning in purified water lol I‚Äôll try just 15 and see then just 10
---
I‚Äôd settle for the game that was supposed to be finished and polished by the time release date came around.
---
You just made thought of singing the whisper song by ying-yang twins into the mic. Total troll moment.
---
  REpair kits would be great, but they should not be instant and only repair a percentage of damage.
---
Would be nice dount it would be something they would introduce though would especially be nice for vault raids but there will probably be benches and stuff in certain areas through out.
---
They said in a road map type thing they were experimenting with increased sizes so it will be increased in the future
---
See you all in a year when it‚Äôs either finally fixed or dead 
---
Your TL;DR needs a TL;DR.
---
Mirelurk kings are this for me.  And there are always more than 1.  They ignore all armor, and fireproof doesn‚Äôt help.  And I don‚Äôt think they can miss.
---
Sorry should be.  PM your GT 
---
Ciao!
---
That's not the same thing as what people are saying here.
---
They are saying they can't submit a ticket because they were banned and when they try and login they get a message saying they can't because they are banned. 
---
You are just experiencing a bad webpage that won't load. 
---
I get its annoying but I still dont get why you would report them. They arent really hurting anything.  
---
Yeah best bet go in twos and just check once an hour on all of um till ya see um all getting water.
---
Yeah. The amount of times I‚Äôve had a weapon break during a SBQ fight, it would be so easy to just open the inventory and pop a cleaning kit to repair
---
i completed it all fo4 the story i hated the first part tbh so after 2 play thrus i modded it to the brink of explosion 
---
I get it. Getting 100 hours out of my 60 purchase was well worth it, even with all the bugs, ive had my fun. Ive done everything there is to do myself and own just about every plan there is.
---
But in an online game like this there needs to be more. There needs to be more then just killing a queen. If your player base hits 100 and does everything then its just going to drop off and die. 
---
And unfortunetly with no npcs and alternate paths to the story line there is little to no reason for an alt. Sure a new build is fun for a while but at this point collecting fans and toy cars has grown stale. I cant nuke megaton with one character and with the other  save its inhabitants.
---
Omg some millennial cupcake thinks the world revolves around it.  Because it still cant figure out if it has a set of balls or not.
---
Well you died without shooting also lol you meet good and bad people in this game. Dont let one experience skew your view on the game. 
---
Right now I'm at level 84 and I join peoples teams and help them with their camps and show off my camp. It's a lot more fun being friendly than playing trying to kill everyone. Its already a lonely game no need to make it worse lol
---
Yeah. Like 25% only. Or even less.
---
It will go to game pass at some point like every fallout game did Bethesda seems to have a very good and long running relationship with Xbox I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it on game pass one day 
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll give that a try too
---
I have a on and off ghost weight as well.  I can carry 270 according to pip boy but containers say 266, and I am overencombered if for example I am 2667/270.  I didn't have the problem today, but yesterday it switched on and off.  My fire axe and gronk axe had similar drops.
---
 Sounds cool, but I doubt it would be possible to move a player and have them load the area fast enough for this to be realistic.
---
That was my mindset as well. 
---
Melee builds have always been in fallout, and there's no reason to cut them out here. 
---
I assume the downvotes are from people who think melee is too strong now and want to go full nuclear, making them useless
---
Building camps is all im doing nowadays
---
Dodgy, Serendipity, marathoner, or maybe something that makes your AP regen faster for those sweet power attacks especially if you're using one of those instigating 40% stronger power attack legendaries. Don't know if it's what people are using on their build, but I like using them.
---
 The grind is real.
---
Yeah, the first hour or so of fallout 4 does kinda feel like a grind (not nearly as big of a grind as 76) but once you get through that, or by modding, the game gets MUCH better.
---
Too much effort for a subpar game 
---
na. ur friends r joking. 
---
You can get a legendary handmade, but not EVERY weapon can be legendary. Right now the drill, chainsaw, syringer, flare gun, pipe revolver, ultracite gatling laser, enclave plasma gun, and scout armor can't drop in legendary form. I might be missing something
---
Yeah, I definitely didn't buy 76 physical, and I wouldn't have if I played on console. 
---
None of my mutations add strength, and my unyielding doesn‚Äôt have any extra add strength, except herd mentality 
---
auf wiedersehen
---
Stand in radiation or buy mutation serums 
---
did you want the stone bench plan ? 
---
This would be the best way to move forward in this game. I'd play it more. I hope this suggestion takes off, it would fix this game. 
---
This is what caused me to abandon the game over a month ago. I loved my little C.A.M.P. I came on here on a whim to see what‚Äôs changed and reading your post made me sad and frustrated all over again. Ugh. I feel your pain. 
---
I wanna enjoy the game but I mean still, me and my friends were messing around and killing the Mr. Farmhands
---
What kind of plans you lookin for partner?
---
Thats not how it works in my experience, npc's tend to do better damage with ranged weapons than they do with melee, so ranged builds suffer from being shot more while Melee do better because they kill faster and also force the NPC's to switch to a lower dps attack. Its like the npc's damage is backwards from how players are.
---
Yes!!!
---
I‚Äôm playing Odyssey on nightmare right out the gate and I love the challenge it‚Äôs posing. If I am against more than 3 enemies at a time I stand no chance unless they are all the weakest guys. Also FUCK THE BOAR!!!
---
Congratulations!
---
 Why?  That is ridiculous.
---
Np good luck!
---
Building different camps. Getting all the PA plans. 
---
Found the salt!
---
Bethesda that makes the RPG‚Äôs is not responsible for ESO
---
&gt;  I've been grinding to find more 90% weight reduced weapons to replace my current inventory. 
---
I'm not that insane. A decent 3* or even 2* is already rare enough but getting even one amazing roll with 90% WR specifically on the 3rd slot to replace a 2* would feel like winning the lottery. It'd be a lot faster just to buy that shit.
---
What do you mean?
---
i even gave you a little discount ;) could you hold him for a bit more ? i‚Äôm looking for a different plan 
---
I think it's pretty straightforward.
---
uranium fever can rarely give you raider's shielded underarmor plan. This is the most expensive reward possible I'd say.
---
lmao
---
Yeah eould be a really easy consumable to make from junk or if they wanted to get detailed make it to where it would cost you two of the gun in particular or caliber to make a single kit.
---
No it‚Äôs not. Explain
---
 25% seems reasonable.
---
I actually switched back to Fallout 4
---
its worked that way for me since i first got it over a month ago. I thought that was how it was supposed to work, like how mutations have downsides that not being able to loot some mobs was the negative.
---
Yeah. But they would have to weigh something like 2 to 5 pounds each so people won‚Äôt spam
---
I still play, and I've been lucky enough to have a decent amount of time every other day. You don't/didn't have to grind though. I'm part of a discord group for fallout, and one of the most active members is legitimately level 12 because he only has time on weekends. He still likes the shit out of the game.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Yeah didn't think I had to release a youtube tutorial for this basic stuff.
---
I know you'll get there. 
---
Well since i got home from work at 6 pm.  Logged on at 6:30 got dcd 4 tomes before 8 pm.  Its not that difficult to figure out little boy.  Yesterday was the same way.  I only have a few hours to play at night so getting kicked more than 3 times is pretty annoying for the amount of caps you spend to claim the shops.  But who cares.  You're an entitled cunt anyway.  No one gives a shit either way.  We know what is going on with our game.  Some little gender confused twat chiming in calling us liars is just amusing.  Try not to forget to breath tonight.  But if you do.  Rest assured the world will not care.
---
It wont happen everytime. I just server hop in situations like that. But I haven't had to deal with griefing in this game. 
---
The game is so much fun after level 50. Nobody fucks with me. Have a jet pack and a ton of mutations a big ass camp and it's all from being friendly. I joined a random guys team last night and he sold me a bunch of serums for 150 caps last night. 
---
Another guy I came across I noticed him next to my camp on day. I went over to his and we traded and now he drops me materials whenever I need some spare. I was out of steel and he gave me what was on him then went to his stash and gave me almost all of his bulk too. 
---
Theres so cool people that play this game. 
---
I basically stopped playing because of that
---
Be cool if they had a cleaning kit that gave you a buff that kept your weapon from degrading for a small amount of time. There could be different tiers that last longer but are rarer or cost more to craft.
---
I‚Äôve had similar things happen. It‚Äôs confusing. 
---
Wowie zowie my homie has obtained an owie 
---
Travelling pharmacy they weigh almost nothing and are worth a lot to vendors if I don't feel like farming 1400 caps worth of junk to vendor and would rather play a different character. :)
---
Which ones, out of curiosity?
---
Yeah. Or maybe some could take Flux to craft. It‚Äôs all about balance 
---
yeah like i found a mod that let me skip to atleast min men then it was fine from there tbh as long as they dont do terrible fo5 or atleast put more content into 76 ill be happy till then eh theres other bethesda games and other games to play
---
Well, most players that use exploits don't have a very developed brain to begin with.
---
You activate it when you're out of combat. Really good for jumping down mountains.
---
Never worked for me in PA.  Numerous posts on this sub for weeks say the same thing.
---
Agreed 
---
When I was writing it up, I was thinking about having heavy weapons and shotguns be modified by strength, but I feel that certain weapons are already slightly better performing and that these weapons would work better as sort of hybrid weapons.
---
Example, heavy weapons of course requires strength for most their perks, but you can get away with a decent build that doesn't require a full 15 strength. It would make shotguns and heavy weapons weapons that work better for people whose builds are slightly more well-rounded.
---
So basically you could have rifles, both single action and automatic, be best for a perception build. Intelligence would open up energy weapons as an option. Strength focus would be best suited for slower, high damage melee weapons like sledges. Agility builds would work best with faster weapons like knives because you're getting a balance of DPS with less damage dinner more quickly.
---
But the it makes hybrids more valid. Perception/agility would prefer handguns and SMGs because of the fire rate and slight damage bonus. Agility/strength would be good for 1 handed melee. Perception and strength would work well with shotguns, heavy weapons, and explosives.
---
I'm basically thinking of a triangle with Agility, Strength, and Perception being the points, then tune the bonuses so you can kind of pick a point that makes any two combinations of starts at least moderately viable in high level combat.
---
And yeah, I definitely took some inspiration from the past games and how they handled SPECIAL ;)
---
Honestly, they really need to cut the shared caps thing with vendors. It makes no sense and what little economy there is poorer for it.
---
keep up the good work let us know when you get banned. lol
---
&gt; It's not that it's not that realistic, it's that most of these choices don't even make any sense. It's like they took a lot of things that are actually fun in the game and just made them lame.
---
Yeah, the balance is about as good as an L-shaped seesaw,
---
Indeed.  I have a TS Gatling and it's broken only once, during a SBQ fight.  I can clear entire dungeons and follow long quests and it makes it home or to a weapon bench,
---
Yeah that would be reasonable.  Could maybe help make some of the weapons that brake after 2 reloads usable lol
---
I personally feel that the way they are going there won‚Äôt be a next fallout title, from Bethesda at least.
---
they'll remove it because they remove anything thats fun along with actual bugs
---
*cough*cough* laser weapons
---
Sounds like you're looking for a hardware ban (yes it's a thing). How about this, don't break the ToS and get banned in the first place.
---
Healing items and repair junk
---
Power armor. ;)
---
Ok, can you pm me the YouTube link please?
---
I have not found a two-shot, but love my anti-armor Handmade.  My instigating Black powder is nice for a first sneak shot, then swap to the Handmade.
---
Game needs war mode, apparently. Toggle PVP on or off, all the whiners turn it off and all the griefers turn it on, problem solved.
---
I managed to take out my first at lvl 38 by myself. @.@ took like 200 rounds of .45 w/armor piercing (50 dmg b4 AP) with my lvl 30 Combat Rifle. I had full Excavator Power Armor too, and had to use maybe 5 stimpacks for the fight.
---
Tried using a lvl30 Combat Shotgun with AP mag when it landed and it didnt dent it at all.
---
Totally not getting into that fight again cause I'm worried about running out of ammo.
---
Well fo76 reddit lacks inductive reasoning.
---
Playing this game for some time now, I am really forced to wonder: did the guys who designed this game and its weapons actually ***play their own game?*** If so, I honestly don't see how they could release energy weapons and heavy weapons in their current state.  Damage is a joke and they break extremely fast.  I'm left to think that the people who designed it just preferred melee builds and so that's how they played the game and they included everything else as an afterthought. 
---
I think there's actually a mod for that now.
---
im asking how they are comparatively , i wouldn't use both just because im sneak/stealth and i barely even want to use any of them as my goal is to never get hit.
---
That's a very fair point. At the same time though, most of the high damage dealing npcs in the game are partially if not entirely melee. And high level robots and scorchbeasts aside, I can't think of a time where I ever felt I was in over my head against ranged enemies. Most of them can't shoot for shit, and if you just strafe and fire you can down a crowd of ranged enemies fairly quickly. And if perception increases max damage range, staying out of large scale engagements entirely would be a lot more feasible.
---
Reddit lacks inductive reasoning, period. 
---
nah there will be like sure bethesda fumbled hard but i give them 1 more game to see if they can pull it back hell if bethesda dont do it nobody will cuz the ip is worth so much very limited amount of companies can get a hold of it
---
Spawn at antique shop also
---
The flame especially.....had the large tank on it. 400 fuel and it broke without killing one ghoul at whitesprings 
---
Thanks again!
---
Sure thing.  What are you looking for?
---
Thanks!
---
A relative advised me of that two weeks ago. I‚Äôm having a stubborn streak with a second character (just level 27), and slowly exploring everywhere:
---
... with self-imposed conditions [FO4-style]:
---
1. ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù status enabled
---
2. Crouch/[Hidden]/block all other players
---
3. Only using *suppressed .45 Pipe Revolvers*/Molotovs 
---
...
---
[My caveat reminder|s to /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ :
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al1dek/add_legendary_pipe_revolvers_to_loot_table/?st=JRR8J42J&amp;sh=93ffd505 ]
---
Anyway, best wishes with GoW.
---
the pole hook plan, idk if he even has it on him 
---
&gt; They don't PLAY the game. And they don't rent pro playtesters to play for them.
---
They don't need to, there's a community that has plenty of opinions.  Now, as a dev, you're not going to take every person's opinion to heart, but communities tend to come up with a concensus - the overall feeling of the majority of the users in the community who care enough to make themselves heard.  This is all they need to listen to, not pros.  
---
Distand thunder always drops 1 PA plan. Could hit one of the expensive ones
---
He doesn‚Äôt for me now but I‚Äôm pretty sure he did when I had him yesterday.  
---
I buy crafting service when I need mod for PA. Sometimes it‚Äôs free, only mats is required. So I don‚Äôt need plan for mods.
---
I spent all day mining black titanium and looking for screws to build the excavator armor.
---
   what a waste of time, I run out of storage space constantly, have nowhere else to store things, end up scrapping things i want to hang on to or just dropping them on the ground because you cant even scrap a special piece of armor or a special weapon. Servers crashing. I built one piece, a helmet. but i need more screws so i had to scour the whole map. I thought i found a bunch of screws so I went back to my camp to build some more armor (+12 hours later) ALL MY BLACK TITANIUM AND THE HELMET I CRAFTED WAS GONE. I'm done playing, thats bullshit. Fallout 4 had some cool codes, what about this game. 
---
I can't just take this kind of coveted loot without giving you something in return. I can give ya a level 15 ghoul slayer's baton and a level 30 life-saving wooden chest piece in return. Comes damn close to equaling them vents and power armor plans of yours. What do ya say?
---
Just do the same thing as they did that's all
---
Yeah.  My gatling has Stabilized which ignores something like 45% of armour.  And One Gun Army which staggers and cripples.
---
Happening to me as I type this. 
---
I run a non pa one handed melee build. You will also want to look at mutations such as twisted muscles and others to increase damage. Here are my stats/ perks: http://imgur.com/a/CDFAGFn
---
I only wear the order of mystery outfit which works with the chameleon mutation. And primarily use a bloodied switchblade that can reach 350+ damage with a fast swing speed. 
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm looking for some CAMP plans. I spent like 600 caps on 3 plans at a vendor today and I‚Äôm hungry for more.
---
If legit, you are carry almost 25 weight in chem bench plans alone, lol
---
To be fair some people don't like to game the mechanics, and want the one server they play on to provide.  I feel them.
---
"Tambo Scrambled"
---
Still the only platinum I have on PS4. What a great game!
---
Shotguns would do fine on a hybrid, but heavy weapons are currently garbage for the most part, thinking particularly about the minigun. Ugh the damn minigun. Such potential wasted -_- I really want to play heavy weapons but everything else tends to be so much better. Give me the 50 Cal from tactics with depleted uranium rounds oh my. Or the Gauss minigun completely impractical in ammo usage but wow was it good at turning mobs into chunks
---
The guns being Overweight is so bad. One of the few things i hate. 
---
That and the tse nerf of death
---
You're a wanker lol
---
Have you seen the ghoul slayer's gamma gun?
---
And what remote proof do you have that it's different in anyway? The exact same complaints and the exact relationship regarding the sharp change in damage as you approach the armor threshold and move away from it in either direction are everywhere. Energy weapons as shown in the top comment still suffer from the exact same odd exclusion from armor reduction.
---
So far there's absolutely nothing in 76 that states the core armor system was changed in anyway whatsoever. I'd like to be proven wrong.
---
still holding him ? i want to try a couple more times 
---
Well, I have found a decent amount of plans for my camp defending other people‚Äôs camps.
---
Yep.  Added you as a friend so you should be able to fast travel now 
---
I believe so, I've seen a few posts about it. Someone had to report it by now.
---
 Instigating Blackpowder.  With rifleman, bloody mess and covert ops maxed a sneak attack shot takes does massive damage, then I swap to my A Handmade to finish anything still moving.
---
I have put 10k rounds down range with my ak.  I clean it after every use.  It has never broken.  My shotgun has been fired more times than i can count.  It has never broke.  The both have nicks and scratches on the furniture but never broken.  My Ruger .45 has at least 15k rounds fired through it.  Replaced the grip and sights after several years.  
---
Firing guns should take 50k rounds for them to break unless you bash with them.  Gauss weapons around 1k, they tend to eat themselves by design.  Laser guns should go 10k before breaking too.
---
Mele should not break.  They should slowly lose damage over time.  
---
I repair my weapon often.  Well before it breaks and it makes no sense that maintaining a weapon with a little wear takes the same amount of mats as a completely broken weapon.
---
Yes me too! I preferred to make it "white" so it just looked like a regular light/bulb. The green glow is awful and the miners headlamps are way too bright when "reflecting" off surfaces. I often have to turn off the light because it makes it hard to see indoors. But then it's hard to see in the dark. Boo. 
---
Absolute novelty.
---
Lol I'd rather have that than the 2 shot harpoon gun I found a while ago. 
---
Even shooting 2 rounds I couldn't hit a barn door - and even I am not *that* bad a shot... 
---
I thought that too.. repair kits
---
Yeah! I'm not down to be hunted from across the map, certainly not for the very modest benefit of a workshop. If I'm in the area to try to defend the actual physical workshop, sure! But having someone come across the map to one shot me is lame as hell. Especially if you didn't notice any defense messages, and/or were unaware of even having a workshop via a series of teammate disconnects.
---
This is generally the issue in these kind of mmo games. Simply because it is easier to make an enemy have more health, than make it a tougher boss fight in more creative ways. Just look at Destiny, that's pretty much how their boss system worked. Big guy with ridiculous health doing the same thing smaller enemies did. Though that isn't a survival game, so...
---
Also unlike Fallout 76 shooting the weapons felt good and was enjoyable while they also didn't break as you used them. It just had other issues with legendary weapons and armor.
---
Though I'm not sure how increased range would help weapons like automatic machine guns and hand guns. These are weapons that are meant to be mid range, fire from hip, and with high fire rates.
---
What I'm proposing isn't so much to make every build comparable to melee, but to kind of raise the bottom end of damage and give a weapon type with decent damage to all SPECIAL combinations.
---
I still think that a 15 strength melee build with corresponding perks should be the highest dps simply because of the point you raise about having to close range on enemies 
---
Lol.  I drop them all the time at the vault.  But i have probably found at least 200 of them so far.
---
No, I once snuck around following a level 12 listening to his conversation because I was really bored, and he never noticed me. I think that counts as stalking.
---
Same. And i don‚Äôt really want to screw with people but it‚Äôs one of the only things i have left. Still, I don‚Äôt really screw them over. 
---
Broken mechanic currently. They added some back-end items to the atom shop and broke headlamps. It will be fixed next patch.
---
Just found one today at Forward Station Delta on the catwalk where the minigun spawns
---
Yeah. This game with weapon repairing is nothing like real life. In real life as long as you clean a gun and store it properly, it will treat you well. 
---
In the game, you have to repair a gun every 500 shots about. I get the balancing aspect of it but there needs to be another way
---
It is a bug. The fucking predator bug. It is an enemy that's not showing up on your side. Numerous times I'll be playing with my friend and he'll be like, "why are you just letting that ghoul attack you?" And if course I just see my health go down but not see or hear the ghoul. Then he'll kill it for me and eat the corpse, which of course, on my side, looks like he's eating nothing. Happens to me often. I have nerd rage so when I hear the noise that I'm raging out but not in combat, I know I'm being attacked by an invisible enemy. Fucking predator bug.
---
meh
---
i play for hours and engage into pvp in most of my time. I'm a stealth chameleon bloody build sniper. Super glass cannon. Some fights end up as 1v4, as they scatter to find me while I snipe and move. Sometimes, they push together and they could get a shot or two. Luckily for me, explosives don't hurt and most explosive users rely on its aoe dmg. Which means if they r not directly hitting me, i am not taking any damage. This makes exosive shotguns worthless, as the pellets have fall out damage at range, but the explosives allow it to be deadly at further ranges, and if u negate the explosive damage, then you are not taking any damage until they get closer. 
---
Factory raiding forces you into really tight and up close situations, this combination works so well and I say this with a 99% success on my pvp engagements. I literally racked up 10k caps worth of kills and that is how i ended up improving my arsenal with a bloody explosive lever action rifle. The one shots are just so sweet.
---
The worst part is that the century old Gatling Gun does tons more damage than the MG42, kinda dumb seeing as the MG42 uses a WAY bigger bullet and has a WAY more advanced receiver. I want to have fun pretending that I'm a German soldier mowing down everything I see with my MG42 at the cost of heavy recoil/overheating barrrel/ and ammo consumption. Dont get me wrong, in F76 it chews through ammo realistically, but mowing down enemies or breaking easily? Nah.
---
&gt; I don't count accidentally shooting bots. That's the nature of the area 
---
It was complete bullshit before they fixed the spawns‚Äìused to be that if you dared to use an AoE weapon and even nicked them on the outer edge they'd spawn progressively more and more even if you mowed them down eventually even crashing the entire server if it kept up.
---
Not disable that'd be lame to lore. I think slap damage should be default against buildings just like players
---
The only way I'm ever okay with 'raider' characters is when they actually interact with me and not just attack me.  I'll totally give you caps and some junk to not kill me but the instant you try without any interaction with me, is the instant I despawn.
---
Screw griefers, play the game your way?  Okay let's play the game my way, I'll just destroy your base, armor, weapons, then repeat until you get literally no enjoyment out of the game anymore that way you stop playing any everyone you would've 'raided' will be able to enjoy themselves...
---
I guess I‚Äôm burnt out on scrounging the same buildings over and over again for buckets and cans when I can go to one spot and get most of what I need in less than an hour to make a few thousand rounds. To each his own.
---
Be prepared to invest over a dozen perk points and be highly disappointed. 
---
How in the hell are you getting 300 off 3 industrial purifiers? 
---
Gonna mod it same as my normal 2 shot, tweaked reciever.
---
Under shotguns you mention Combat Shotgun, Double-Barrel Shotgun, Pump Action Shotgun - do you happen to have the combat or pump action with explosive? If so would be happy to purchase either or both - 700 caps each?
---
Bring Nick to Far Harbor with you :)
---
You mean like headlamps for power armor?
---
People who do this want a high bounty. Your proposal incentives the exact behavior you want to end.
---
There is no way to fix PVP to be fair to non-combatants other than to exempt them (and their CAMPs) from it.
---
Overtime of like a 6 to 8 hours of play sometimes ita goofy and when I go to a new server to do some trades or are hoping to get something they refill. Really dont need more then 3 purifiers anything past that and your starting to get overkill.
---
You cant forget about the total disregard for deductive reasoning 
---
They CAN still see you, but they can't track you via the map. So if someone does that to you, block all those involved and change your location! Come back to the one you were at a little bit later and should be safe.
---
I've had a similar issue when fixing weapons  
---
On PS4 Dm\_storm
---
Doing this is what made fo4 fun again for me
---
2 points for starched genes. How to save more points?
---
I agree that heavy weapons are incredibly unbalanced, but if you were to drop a few points in perception, it would increase the damage a little. And with that rate of fire, those little bonuses can add up really fast.
---
I think that damage bonus, along with some tuning of all heavy weapons could really make them great. Bumping up the durability being one thing I can think of right off the bat to make them better, especially the energy based ones (which would be great for strength/intelligence hybrids).
---
Character is already completed, and my normal 2 shot handmade already wrecks flying scorchbeasts in about 3-4 seconds once they get in vats range. So there will be no disappointment.
---
Looking forward to it. Word of advice, you can adjust the clip capture duration in the PS4's settings menu up to 30 minutes (IIRC, could be more now) meaning when you press the "share" button you can save your last 30 minutes of gameplay and edit them later.
---
We also need the Gauss minigun! Lol...
---
3 from class freak
---
Never said I broke tos. Maybe I'm sick of reading ban posts that take up more upvotes then the actual problems. Again lacking deductive thinking here and jumping to a false conclusion.
---
I agree they do need to figure out some kind of balance to make other builds less niche. Right now most people are either PA Melee or some kind of V.A.T.S. sniper. 
---
That's awesome! I never found one lol only useless legendaries like 1* off of 3* enemies. But too bad tse has been nerfed hella
---
But if you add a compensator, reflex sight, armor piercing rounds, or a different receiver to your ak it doesn't gain 15 pounds
---
Play another game. Lots of better games ar cheap or even free. 
---
It's a graphical glitch. Whenever you interact with an item that adds something to your inventory, it shows a message showing that your ammo you last loaded was falsely removed.
---
I just farmed there and it was fine
---
He just disappeared
---
&gt; It will be fixed next patch.
---
Will it?
---
are you on xbox? i have extra forrest hats and would give ya one
---
Hell, old Doom and Quake with mods still deliver. Quake even had some great stuff release recently!
---
Agree. When I modded survival of 4... each enemy could 1 shot me. I also could 1 shot enemies.  I had to approach each fight with a plan. And it was awsome !!!!
---
Some enemy's cannot be one shotted so you have to use strategy and explosives. 
---
I was going to post that maybe we should try using the same trash cans at the whitespring for ammo/recipe/plan/whatever dumps. I primarily use my Blade of Bastet and cbt shotgun (I have the flaming 10mm and a sniper rifle too), so I find that I am drowning in .38, .44, .45, .50 cal, crossbow bolts, syringe rounds, cryo, missiles, baby nukes, whatever. Oh and special/legendary items get I can‚Äôt sell (because they ran out of caps). So I put these in the trash can across and to the left of the crafting room at the whitespring. If that fills up, I go down the hall, filling them up. 
---
As to how to help out melee players? Idk if there are any special modifiable blades that are both high level and do significant damage. 
---
&gt;game *has always been* boring
---
FTFY
---
I‚Äôm lvl 90 and Gutsy‚Äôs (specifically the ones with ballistic weapons, the ones with lasers are trash) are by far the most dangerous enemy in the game. I don‚Äôt necessarily think their hp pool is too large, but for how much dmg they deal their slightly larger hp bar can seem endless.
---
I actually built my character around dealing with Gutsy‚Äôs. I have 4 Pieces of Troubleshooter Armor and one Unyielding. It has helped a ton, but I‚Äôll still get wrecked by a Gutsy if I get caught in the middle of a fight.
---
Seriously, if I‚Äôm in a room with an Assaultron, Sentrybot, Protectron Guardian, and a ballistic Gutsy, you better believe I target that Gutsy first or get torn to shreds. Idk about anyone else but that doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me.
---
Now here is where I lose people. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt nerf the Gutsy too much. A 20% dmg reduction sounds great to me. Btw that‚Äôs still strong enough to massacre the unprepared, but dethrones him as the king of the wastes. Honestly I‚Äôd buff laser and heavy enemy weapons to level the playing field. Nothing wrong with a challenge. I accidentally ran into a Sentrybot with mortars on its back and laughed the dmg off, only to turn the corner and get blasted down to 10hp by a Gutsy ticked off that I just blew up the hottest hunk of robot in the factory.
---
Should be about maintaining it.  If you fire 10k rounds without ever maintaining it, it should break.  And then only be able to be repaired to 85% of what it used to be.  
---
I polish every thing on my real guns.  Especially the feed ramp.  Most just clean it.  But polishing it greatly increased the cycling speed.  I took my stepfathers AK and stripped and polished the internals.  Gave it back and he swore i returned a different gun.  I really only enjoy shooting them as often as I do just so I can break them down and get my clean on.
---
Just as others have mentioned with their comments,  most people do not know about SBQ difficulty scaling. Me and my friends used to jump on it to help with the fight every time scorched earth quest comes up, we spend the caps to join and we get there with all we've got us being level 30s at that time didn't get us no where inspite of us using up all our ammo, all weapons breaking with no stims left. We may have died a lot but at least we put up a good fight is what we tell our selves. So long as they do something to help im fine with that instead of just tagging and hiding. But now being over level 100+ im usually the one with a gauss rifle on top of the bunker and the one with a super sledge whacking the queens face. Lately though everytime i see scorched earth pop up  8 times out of 10 a message saying the event has ended 5 seconds after scorched earth event popped up. 
---
Unless you have an internal copy of their Deficiency Reports from whichever Agile thing they're using (Jira or something similar), you can't *really* be certain about the QC aspect, can you?
---
I'd hesitate blaming an entire team of people when I've seen a QC team test the shit out of some software, find hundreds of bugs, only for the software to be released anyway with no fixes. Then while customers are unboxing/installing and encountering the bugs, the ones that get most reported on that are ALSO the quickest fixes get thrown in first. 
---
Usually the director of whatever department has a wet dream if they can knock out multiple DR's with one fix, regardless how small the issue. The more DR resolutions they can resolve, the better their department stats. 
---
Once again, you could be totally right. However, it is in my professional experience that it usually happens something like:
---
* Software company with name that sounds like an real word, however, it is not. (Vimeo, Reddit, Twitter, Hooli, Initech, Aviato)
---
* A bunch of stupid decisions were made to throw money at a dev team to build some software
---
* Dev team builds the software to spec
---
* Spec was wrong, respec 
---
* New respec requires changes to core functionality
---
* Not enough money to pay for labor required for rebuilding entire core code
---
* Essentially programmatic duct-tape is applied to meet deadline within budget
---
* Devs have serious concerns regarding some major flaws in software, since it is now some sort of abomination that wants to die. Customers expectations will not be met.
---
* Dev teams move to work on patches for major flaws - leadership halts patching, says QA/QC feedback will be considered before anymore dev project hours are spent
---
* QA/QC discover same serious flaws as well as 300 other undetected errors. 
---
* 310 DR's are created by QA/QC
---
* Dev teams move to work on patches for major flaws - leadership halts patching, says QA/QC DR Reports are being triaged to determine patch schedule.
---
* Leadership delivers to dev teams a list of top priority DR's while simultaneously giving the thumbs up to marketing to RTM the product.
---
* Marketing says the software can do "x", it does not do "x". 
---
* Dev teams discover top priority DR's triaged by Leadership are for font size and color themes. No mention of major flaws. 
---
* Customers report major flaws in software
---
* Support Center has not been trained in new software, requires escalation to dev team for support
---
* Dev team now working support tickets linked to the major flaws while also getting told by leadership these are not top priority, change the font size again.
---
* Subreddit for the software implodes, userbase drops significantly.
---
* Software company declares bankruptcy, lays off dev team
---
* Reforms under new name (this time it's a made up Italian sounding name, "Codice Schifoso Software, LLC)
---
* A bunch of stupid decisions were made to throw money at a dev team to build some software 
---
This is part of the reason I stopped playing. So much of my time playing went into inventory management. At the very least, junk (and maybe ammo as well) shouldn't contribute to the stash limit.
---
I think Vendor Bots Phoenix sells them.
---
I see them spawn occasionally at watoga station 
---
Holy shit I just commented. And then read your comment ... our sentences matched 100%. You are my best friend. 
---
Switch to melee, it does much more damage than ranged...
---
I think I saw one at watoga station or the brotherhood vendor at watoga shopping center. I might even have one? Maybe. Not on right now.
---
There is really only one NPC in the game at all (Rose) and she is not much of one.  All the ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù is on rails with no choices or rp opportunities.  The vendors are not npcs in any meaningful way.  Graham is great, but there is no interaction.  I enjoy the various robovendors such as Phoenix, but he isn‚Äôt a character by the standards of games in general.
---
I gave this post the 666th Like! 
---
I agree with you. Part of the potential surprise that is this game. If I can get attacked while trying to terminal hack (by an NPC) then I better be prepared to deal with another player. #stayalert
---
Ghoul slayer gama gun right here :/ 
---
Also, robot arm mods unlocked by scrapping are unable to be applied to the arms. Probably due to missing keyword on the arms that would allow robot arm mods to be applied to them.
---
Exactly. People shouldn't be punished because they want to have a character with a wider skill range. Just because I want to be able to pick locks and hack computers doesn't mean I have to be completely worthless in a fight.
---
As it stands right now, the game rewards you the most when you focus on damage and the primary way to get that damage up to invest in strength to use melee.
---
I have a sniper that's not terrible in a fight, but I don't use VATS at all. I play the game more like a traditional FPS. I shouldn't be punished for that. Make perception offer a damage increase outside of VATS for the people that don't use it.
---
The problem is that despite some changes being made for multiplayer, the core of the game design still operates like a single player game in many ways. I feel like the spread between optimal DPS and a non-DPS spec as far as damage output is just too wide.
---
Nope, OP talking about something else.
---
Nice clean ghouls
---
I havent seen them before the patch. I bought like 5 sets the night before and then kept 2 for my friend and I and sold 3 sets.
---
&gt; You have to kill a flatwoods monster 1st
---
Then there is a hatch in a pond, and it opens.
---
It wont open until you have killed a flatwoods monster
---
Middle of map, he says a forrest but its hardly a forrest, like 5 trees, next to a factory not on the map which also has a small body of water almost directly next to it also not on the map
---
&gt; Dead center of body of water hatch, will NOT open until you kill a flatwoods monster.
---
I did before the patch.  Its shit now.  Damage is 127 with 9 points in rifleman and 5 in demolition.   I used to kill myself accidentally if something got to close all the time from one misplaced shot.  I can dump 85 rounds in my own foot now and not even lose a quarter of my health.  
---
Me, all this weirdness with energy weapons is making me sad.
---
they've been balancing, but its been by nerfing ranged in any form that is fun and useful. Worst part is they are balancing around pvp, when most people don't care to pvp.
---
Same thing happened to me near Top of the World. I was full health, water, food. Got hit hard over and over by something invisible that made no sound. I ran till my ap gave out (I have Speed Demon and Marsupial, so I lose most things easily).  Pause while using VATS to see what it was. Nothing showed, but my CAUTION was up.  Then I‚Äôm hit again, hard, over and over - silently. Run and hit again. WTF? Then it finally showed itself - a glowing mole rat ‚Äòflying‚Äô at me. Not burrowing, not making a sound, but flying through the air at me. I was able to kill it at that point. At this point I‚Äôd run waaay north. Bug, big time. 
---
Yeah when I first got on today the first 4 legendary enemies were 2* and 3* and they all dropped 1* armor, so business as usual. 
---
Then the handmade dropped and then the next one finally dropped me a good medic gun to play around with lol.
---
Thank you everyone for your input and help.  I finished the quest tonight.  
---
&gt; Why is your RNG so off for some players?
---
This one is one of my major complaints. I usually blame my general bad luck with things like this. But a 95% chance to hit should almost never miss. By definition it should only miss 1 out of every 20 times. So why does VATS nearly always miss on either the first or second shot for me.
---
Bloody mess would be good idea to have
---
And sadly they all autoscrap.  I don‚Äôt think the dev team even communicates internally.
---
It actually kills ghouls
---
 Makes sense I guess.  
---
No. You can get the plans for the costumes. Skeleton costs 5 plastic and 2 cloth (or the other way around, I can't remember). Easy to make a ton to sell.
---
I run the same way pretty much. I rely on ADS cripples to stay alive when I get swarmed. Having a way to do crits ouside of V.A.T.S. would be nice. As it is now, I cripple a something strong, then V.A.T.S it with a weak weapon to build up a crit to save for later. But other than that I don't really use it. It makes me queasy.
---
Yes, but I don‚Äôt have bloody mess. It happens very regularly since the last patch.  
---
 That and they should take a bit of time to work, not an instant repair.
---
The mistress of mystery dress was the only one im aware of, and two people wearing the same wont give the buff from what I've heard.
---
The minute a game becomes more work than fun is exactly when I quit playing it. Heroes of the storm, counter-strike, Starcraft 2, etc. fuck games that aren‚Äôt fun. I‚Äôll be in west Elizabeth, dragging people around with a lasso until they die. 
---
That's cool and all, but the advice you're giving out is essentially a crash course on getting a $250+ device permanently banned from online play. Thanks for the snotty response though, it was adorable. Unbelievably stupid and pointless, but adorable. You can delete this post now.
---
They use reference ID which is unique for every instance of object so it may be more complicated. Every part of steel has their own Ref ID
---
Sorry, I have just what is shown. 
---
I‚Äôm just tired of level 51 3 star gutsy bots spawning when I‚Äôm level 12. Not to mention all the friendly boys are randomly dying in the streets for no reason.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs tiring.
---
Frankly they should never have put serum plans on a vender. Something so important should come from a world boss. Everyones complaining about queen loot. Immagine how much more worthwhile she'd be if she regularly dropped random serums and rarely dropped a plan.
---
Lowest I've seen was 8k... 
---
That's only assuming they continue the illegal activity as most people learn from their mistakes. I see however you are very salty and probably should just stop responding. I'm not here to argue I'm here to help others put. They are their own person and if they want a hardware ba. Then so be it. Salty mf.
---
I just checked again and nothing! Currently this is my biggest gripe about the game. 
---
I just checked and nope :(
---
I boosted levels from nukes on my 2nd character after lvl 45 but it's the 'same ol' song and dance' beyond that
---
You shouldn't have to server hop for mats to sustain your ammo, tbh
---
Yeah I surprised myself (second character) yesterday when I died twice doing that quest. I also used up all my stimpaks and had to came back the next day after crafting more stimpaks and some power armor to finish the job.
---
I get you bro I‚Äôll be following soon
---
I like this game even with all its flaws.  We all want to blame Bethesda for our problems with this game now when in fact we are the problem.  They are only changing this game because of our feedback.  Bitching and moaning about every little aspect of this game, because it's not what we expected is the reason we are at this point.  As for me I'm just going to play the game until it's not fun for me.
---
Ok, so don't make them too easy. They could still be made *somewhat* easier to deal with, without going too far.
---
I‚Äôll be following soon
---
Having an high agility w/ perks and matching it with explosives..  
---
Perhaps marsupial, and/or bloody mess!!  
---
I run full auto rifles and I burn through ammo so damn fast, even with crafting perks.
---
Glow sight in per is great in nukes. Might be worth taking 3 from end and putting per to 15 for it.
---
Hmmm.. What are the odds of getting dropped into that server
---
That and Purified Water
---
I got trapped in a CAMP once. I logged out and back in. Problem solved.
---
Read the headline. "Audit __*server*__" and Bethesda able to collect diagnostics.
---
Meanwhile I finally scrounged up enough caps for the handmade plans. Woop woop!
---
&gt; bloodied nocturnal boxing glove.
---
That's literally impossible. You can't have two 1st slot effects.
---
yeah like the patch that fixed the "Feed the People" event or the patch that nerfed production on workshops. Be real here BGS isn't even patching or working on patching things people have been asking for since BETA I.E. Heavy weapon buff, QOL, Less disconnects, Event timer. You seriously need help if you think that we are being entitled after playing a half made game i paid full price for, for over 3 months .
---
&gt;	No, more like, gee, your story sounds a lot like all these other stories.
---
You know, that could be because it's happening often to some people. There are some people who say they've never experienced a bug, so by your logic if you've ever experienced a bug that means you're lying.
---
&gt;	That lack any evidence. Like how this guy set out to test it and up, every time, disconnected.
---
Not mamy are going to take the effort to make a video to document their frustrations for a game.
---
What is more plausible? A buggy game Affects some players negatively more than others, or there is a grand conspiracy to create false evidence that the game bugger than it is.
---
Wrong, if you bypass a ban it considered an offence. Stop giving out bad advice.
---
Me too. I normally don‚Äôt seek platinum but I decided I wanted to see everything I could in the game. Best choice ever. Even now I still have plans for when I go back.
---
Thanks :)
---
The other day I ran into a Sentrybot with mortar launchers attached to her back and I literally laughed off the damage and took her to hammer town, only to walk around a corner and get blasted by a Gutsy who was jealous I blew up the hottest piece of metal in the factory before he got the chance to interface with her combat inhibitor.
---
Obviously I‚Äôm joking. There‚Äôs no way that Gutsy hadn‚Äôt already done some gear grinding with Sentrymama a few dozen times before I came along. Gutsy‚Äôs are the kings of the apocalypse.
---
But seriously, I‚Äôm level 90 and Gutsy‚Äôs with ballistic ammo (not the laser ones, those guys are a joke) are by far the strongest and most dangerous enemies in the game.
---
I did get a legendary pipe weapon from a legendary eyebot during the beta, don't remember if it was a random eyebot or robot swarm event since it was near Vault Tech University.
---
I found the same thing trying to server hop to collect razorgrain at billings homestead, it used to work now it seems like they've made more than just the cap stashes instanced. Which is how it is supposed to be, I guess, server hopping should be discouraged. Though, it doesn't take 20 hours to respawn, more like an hour.
---
Just finished ME3 for the 5th time today, a souls game might be fun to do next. I'm either gonna do DKS1 or DKS3.
---
It Just Works
---
Charleston Station
---
I can do 5k if your on Xbox. 
---
"Quiet rar"
---
Why would griefers leave adventure?  Many of us assume the won‚Äôt go to the pvp servers.
---
This is why my camp is hidden. I run sneaky sniper. Always crouched and hidden. Screw people.
---
What platform are you on? I can take a look for them tomorrow when I play for you
---
May have been junkie nocturnal.   It was shit either way.
---
Nothing sucks more the the surprise assaltron in a silo as I try to hack a terminal lol
---
Thought its from the vendor bot not events?
---
Lift embargo
---
I don‚Äôt have to. But after grinding to lvl 182 since the games been released I‚Äôd prefer to just spend an hr every few days getting what I need instead of picking up every piece of garbage I come across. 
---
There are legendary pipe weapons,  i have a legendary pipe pistol.  It dropped as a pipe rifle but that's easy to modify.  It wasn't a revolver though,  it was a pipe bolt action.
---
What I like most about this post is its simplicity.
---
Me IRL. But for real I hit cap and then frantically craft random things or bulk items for sale. Then hit the cap again. I only play a few hours a week with a friend. So I don‚Äôt know how people who ‚Äúmain‚Äù this game manage it. 
---
although to clarify I've never seen anyone attempt to take any of my workshops. Multiple times I've owned every workshop except that southern one in the slaggy area FOR HOURS and no one bothers to attempt. So while I've yet to run into the issue of pvp, just the thought of it is enough to drive me off of it. 
---
The modern weapons mod is what made that game fun again. It was like survival/rpg Battlefield.
---
It can be found.  I got it from a random event.  I wish I could help more but it is out there.
---
Well tell that to the dozen youtubers that are still playing after 7 plus bans get the f off.
---
Awesome write up, looks like meat is back on the table boys!  I mean, my newbie will be rocking this weapon.
---
*the enclave wants to know your location*
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox 
---
Studio 58 in whitesprings
---
Sad. *Not a Pipe revolver*, exactly.
---
That‚Äôs a result of trying to go too fast, not of going too slow. Your blind sensationalist criticism can‚Äôt have it both ways. 
---
How should we know if you're kissing something important?
---
Also, you get more steel/lead/etc if you take the workshop, **then** go kill super mutants or whatever.
---
Good legendary armor or max sneak.
---
Tough choice if you‚Äôve done both already.
---
I've never seen them surrender to me before, but they yell "retreat" all the time and hightail it in the opposite direction from me. Sometimes, if they're not 3*, I let them live.
---
Exactly. Nerf xp,nerf damage output,make enemies tougher,and reduce legedary drops,all things Bethesda has done recently
---
Damage is already subject to level difference penalties in PVP. Bethesda confirmed that when they talked about the PVP servers. There are new mechanics like slap damage that reduce damage. Perks have different values as well. Rifleman in FO4 was 100% more damage. In FO76 it only goes to 60% with all three cards. 
---
People act like everything was just copied and pasted from FO4 but they clearly tweaked damage values. Is it so hard crazy to think they tweaked DR as well? Nobody knows if DR is exactly the same. You say there is proof DR is the same as in FO4 yet you will not present it. Simplest way to win your argument is show it.
---
I don't play this yet, but I say, they should stay wanted, even if they disconnect, they lose at least half their caps, their best weapon, and their best armor. I say this because I'm guessing you spent months building your camp
---
Makes me sad to know these are duped. 
---
I honestly would never have looked there. I was not aware that was something that existed in this game. Thank you!
---
So am I. Awesome. I'll take a look around tomorrow and if I find them I'll PM you my gamer tag to meet up. 
---
I'm a completionist with the building plans so I know how crazy it makes me to not have one I want lol. 
---
I immediately read your post's title in Simon Cowell's voice. Bravo üëè
---
Pffft. Watoga Highschool Cafeteria is the plastic mecca you noobs.
---
If you're on pc then there's no issues
---
LoL happy cake day.
---
You just made me cackle so hard on the toilet that my fianc√© asked who I was talking to üò¨ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Why not let them kill you so they get a bounty? Then seek revenge while they're using the vendor.
---
Why do people want so much for them?
---
Where exactly in Whitesprings is it? It took me weeks to find the sulphur fountain and I was looking right at it the whole time.
---
You're welcome!. If I'm remembering wrong, let me know, but I was there yesterday looking to see if they had anything new post patch and remembered seeing it on the bottom of his list
---
Yup, got that T-shirt.
---
The black Brotherhood Officer Suit underarmor switches to the orange colored variant during 1st person reload animations. I've only seen this on the females. Havnt tested yet for males.
---
So then what's your solution? Honestly not trying to be condescending its just since you're obviously the one more "in the know" about game design how should bethesda fix this game before the next time you log on it's literally just you on there defending bethesda until they close the servers
---
Studio 58 is the one next to the one with all the crafting stations
---
Hahahaha! ü§£ü§£
---
I've got 200hrs in both 1 &amp; 2 and in 3 I've got 300, but it has been around a year since I've played any of them. DKS2 was the last on I've played so it's either 1 or 3...
---
Might do DKS1... my personal favorite sheerly due to nostalgia.
---
It's all in the name.
---
Introduced two patches ago
---
**Unresolved**
---
Empty promises of fixing the game is as tedious as the grind fest this game is. I really really tried my damnest to like 76 but no, I will be replaying all other single player FO and ES instead of this nonsense.
---
I hit the stash zen about three weeks ago. I hover on any given day around 450 to 475. 
---
I may get downvotes for this, but I‚Äôm not sacrificing my enjoyment of the game. I just focus on what I need and ignore the rest. 
---
Fruit, like the you tuber? Regardless, 51 plans are sold by the Phoenix Vendor at the Watoga Mall.  Caps, 1400 daily or every 20 hours(I think) by doing vendor runs.  I like to hit harpers ferry, Lewisburg, The Whitesprings because they have multiple enemies that drop weapons to sell.  Get Hard Bargain maxed, it makes life easier.
---
The more people who leave, the less they're going to support your dead game. 
---
Did you read the plan?
---
I'm sure your dad owns Microsoft and he told you this too. I speak from experience, XBL isn't 2 years old son. It's nearly 20 years old now. Microsoft doesn't take kindly to ban bypass. THEY WILL HARDWARE BAN. This is a known fact, IDGAF what your YT cheaters do or say. 
---
No because it's not in my inventory
---
I don't even know why I want the stupid thing. I was just scanning the imagur megathread of C.A.M.P. items and immediately knew I wanted it for my Western themed character. This dumb game. 
---
Free handmade plans on the patrol duty event, it‚Äôs random but it‚Äôs always a weapon plan, got the hand made on my second run
---
i cant hear you over all that slobbering your doing on todd howards dick
---
It also disappears when you read it.
---
I'm responding in a condescending way to the consescending way you're treating the people on the BGS team. 
---
These people just spent years making something nice for us, and warrant more respect and less contempt. 
---
The decision makers and those responsible for the business side also did somewthing for us they never did before. They invited us into the design conversation before the core and balance design got closed off for good. EPIC games never did this for us, nor did Bethesda offer this to us with Fallout 4 or Skyrim. 
---
Your question about what my solution is is valid, and I'll give you a real answer. The answer is education.
---
The business, design, tech and testing people in Bethesda are neither incompetent nor ill-meaning. That is not the reason for what you are seeing. 
---
Rather,  there's a different reason you may not have considered, for the low maturity level of the title as of when it chose to ship, and the evidence (of their rapid iteration, of the way they talk about structuring the business behind me) doesn't support the incompetence or ill-meaning theories. 
---
Here is the real reason: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6txdh/welcome_to_the_design_team/
---
And once you understand what's actually going on, and take the time to process what it means for you, for them and for the project, you might come to realize it's actually better this way. 
---
Didn't read it the two I just bought. I think the server is being laggy because after about 10min the terminal plan showed up.
---
Lol, I know the feeling. I spent way too much time looking for the "elusive" bathroom toilet plans to go with my bathtub plans
---
I go to the golf course way up north. Tons of golf balls, plates and silverware.
---
Thanks but I‚Äôm ps4 sigh...
---
Is it amongst that row of shops that look like an apartment complex or rental cabins? I'll have to comb through those. I've somehow managed to spend next to no time in Whitesprings in spite of having ran upwards of 7 different characters in this game.
---
Yep, my display room was a whole floor
---
Idk I just want to wear it with the assault gas mask!
---
I wont even claim a workshop without it being a world with someone on my friend list.  Ps4 disconnects is real.
---
Problem solved then?
---
I crouch, open map first. Seems to *load in assets*, and I‚Äôve been fine. [PS4]
---
Inside the main building, bottom floor in the row of shops
---
Half of it depends if the next plan shows up.
---
That is too real. At least everything has a set vendor, but having to relearn what goes where is a chore.
---
My testing has been over 3 weeks long. I've had 6 or 7 hour sessions without owning a single workshop. Several of those, actually.  However,  within the last month and a half, I haven't spent more than 10 minutes on after I take a workshop. And as far as the "proof" you are saying I need to provide. No. I don't owe you anything. And all your "suggestions" about what I should use that proof for are bullshit. It's a bait strategy that I'm not dumb enough to fall for. If I decide to do that, then I will. And if Bethesda was smart, they'd be looking at reddit and checking their game to test things themselves. That's what they get paid to do. 
---
The Bright Light...
---
You're a lifesaver. Seriously. I'd have been wandering for hours. Not hyperbole.
---
You can never shut off the light, hero...
---
I‚Äôve searched ‚ÄúPipe Revolver‚Äù here and online, back to BETA: no proof (yet) of Legendary Pipe *revolvers.*
---
No joke, I used to know where to go for all the rarer plans I wanted to find and sell
---
 Someone once told me not to be a hoarder when I voiced a similar complaint, and I felt personally attacked.
---
In fo4 it healed them. But they added ballistic damage to it in this game
---
You're absolutely right, you shouldn't have to move your camp to reduce the cost of repairing either. 
---
Of over a hundred hours in this game to date, i've barely had any experience of people co-operating outside of playing with people they actually know in real life. All that opportunity to go play with others and they wave and carry on every time. 
---
I'd say that about 80% of the time the people i run into don't even know how to use the trade function at all. It's a sorry state for a multiplayer game. 
---
Yea and being used to buy as much sentinel armor as they can...
---
I understand this is a first iteration online ame from an engine that is as old as the 90's designed by a studio that only has one other online game. The fact of the matter is your blind fandom towards BGS literally binds you to the fact they released this game too early and too high a price. Plain and simple. The fact we are let in on the design of this game shows the lack of thought or testing the product had before the BETA and release. The simple fact is the game although looks beautiful and detailed, was shipped with game breaking bugs the developer knew about. Now flashforward 3 months later what do we have? Same bugs re appearing because the incompetent dev team you linked me too didnt realize they were patching an old build? Seriously there's no point in arguing with someone as stuck up BGS ass as you.
---
With the sim conquest mod expansion for sim settlements out i was like yeah see ya later 76
---
Honestly, I grew to like the limited stash weight. Forces me to be more strategic &amp; think about what I save. BUT, I still have to agree that 600 is too small. Make it 1,000 and call it a day. 
---
In general if pacifist mode is on VATS should never target PCs or PC items. This was the worst part of my SQB fight today.
---
America exists because the colony refused to give up their guns to the British.
---
Do you happen to remember which region. Someone earlier had said it was a random encounter in the mire.
---
I‚Äôm ok with some work but I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting anywhere with just 1200(minus the fast travel fee) caps a day. 
---
I'll dump my uneeded legendaries in the blue suitcase in Watoga Station. I've found a few items there as well. Dropping off or picking up, it is always a pleasant feeling.
---
Same, just going *Gunslinger.* (No rifleman perks.)

Work in progress:

(Perk deviation, like Gunsmith 1, not shown)
---
Agreed!
---
I agree, the game isn‚Äôt hard and enemies aren‚Äôt that hard to kill. I could agree to increasing both player and mob damage, however.
---
Just tonight I heard super mutants yelling "retreat!!!!" near Top of the World. No idea who was shooting em(probably scorched) as I just got there so my guns weren't blazing yet.
---
yup, contacted support about it. Got this message;

does not fix it for me but that√®s the only thing I got from them :S
---
That would all be fun to experience, could even bring people back if done correctly 
---
Is that every 2hrd when you log in or it‚Äôs a server wide timer?  I think most people don‚Äôt have that many hours to play each day.  
---
Lvl 90. Still only ever seen 1 and i killed him
---
I think people are taking your comment wrong, I get where you're coming from but for that type of weaponry you need special licensing and for many, it's simply the enjoyment of shooting them and the novelty of owning them. Think of it like the people that have a Lamborghini, do you need a Lamborghini? Nah, but it's a lot cooler than a Civic and more fun to drive. Another example would be those that build their cars up for much higher performance to ridiculous standards and still daily them, it's because they love driving or love the styling and working on their vehicles. Is it practical? Nope, but it's their hobby and it's what keeps them happy and entertained and they are a hell of a lot of fun to talk to and listen to how much they enjoy said hobbies.
---
The whole game sucks.
---
Metro games
---
I found them, they‚Äôre hiding in harpers ferry from Wallace the vendor bot!
---
1. Your facts are wrong. ESO is a different studio, different engine. 
---
2. You understand wrong. I'm not a blind fan of Bethesda or of anything. That's just your little circle-jerk defending story you sing to yourself while sticking your fingers in your ears and going la-la-la to the facts. This behavior makes *you* the fanboy here. 
---
3. I'm a fan of being given an opportunity to provide feedback that steers the game design. That's completely selfish behavior. It's not fanhood-driven. 
---
4. I'm a fan of treating people right. I seem to be making an exception for you, but, you know, Bethesda team has built a game, and you're just an 
---
 armchair critic that came to a subreddit I read and vomited your ignorance all over it. 
---
5. Please read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6txdh/welcome_to_the_design_team/
---
I haven‚Äôt seen  them either. Supposedly the vendor at Pleasant Valley Ski resort sells them. Also heard Phoenix, and Wallace. I‚Äôve been trying to find them everywhere but can‚Äôt. 
---
Also realizing that, while I can make BoS arms in at least the Standard and Heavy version (maybe sturdy), apparently can only make the legs in the Sturdy. Extra lame and just want the damn leg plans
---
I wanted to downvote but as an Ark player who's lost many bases to PVP... I get it. It can take weeks or MONTHS to get your base and dinos back.
---
&gt;  no one in their right mind is just going to level another 50 levels to change all those points.  
---
Don't forget, it isn't just 50 levels needed, but also you have to buy all the perks for a new class as well as respec your SPECIAL points. I'd say a level 50 would easily take 80+ **MORE** levels to respec completely. We need a way to respec in game that doesn't involve leveling further and isn't sold in the store.
---
Increase to how much tho?  Without the limit I can easily get enough loot/junk to buy everything they got to offer very quickly.  
---
I had a person try to sell me stuff today and I said no, I don‚Äôt want items gotten by cheating. He started harassing me so I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll report you for cheating.‚Äù He started shooting at me and following me from server to server. 
---
His gamer tag is ‚ÄúButcher Smurf‚Äù. He was such a jerk. 
---
..when he's not beating the snot out of other robots.
---
Thanks for your two sense that nobody asked for. Have fun living a miserable and angry lifestyle.
---
I once violated a Mothman in broad day light and it's corpse just faded into thin air...
---
Craft and scrap
---
I hate having to spend 15-30 minutes trying to relog after a blue screen just to accidentally hit the pipboy and have to relog again. Then when i relog the 3rd time i get an infinite loading screen qnd i just throw my hands in the air like "really....is this gokng to happen all day?" The cycle is never ending.
---
Have a good time now!
---
Born Survivor + First Aid lets you swing without stopping to heal. Essential. Plus you don't have to manually heal. Resupply with Watoga Mayor's Safe.
---
Sooo they haven't even finished following through with the promised restitution for the FIRST major thing they lied about regarding this game, and the game's still in a bug-infested state that even outside of the bugs has massive QoL issues - and some suit decides, you know what, this is the \*perfect\* time to start selling non-cosmetic stat boost items for cash.
---
You've become a parody of yourself, Beth.
---
Yea, but what about all the players who picked a path that was never viable and had to put the time in to respec their characters when they found that out, or who stuck with it hoping it would get fixed? Why do they get fucked over, but people who were riding the gravy train all along just get to board the next one for free.
---
Same problem here
---
That's awesome thank you!
---
i know how to get the mods but i don‚Äôt have the plans to begin with 
---
Yeah im the same. Its Warframe or ESO. At least hoping on my DC Nightblade in cryodill is 1000% times more interesting then Fallout 76 pvp. 
---
Oh yay!
---
No idea why anyone would want a steel extractor. Charleston landfill and 3 junk piles üòç
---
But why stay? There will be easier prey and better reward for doing so in survival if what BGS says is accurate. I really think(and hope) this will make a decent impact on everyone's QOL. Adventure mode is weak sauce and fuckin lame really, what is so fun about shootin scorched and super mutants all day??
---
mommy didnt teach you to read patch notes punk?
---
They need to add in an easy mode for players like yourself. Don‚Äôt ruin the difficulty for those of us that enjoy a challenge!
---
That's because gamebryo was never designed for that. Yes I know it's called creative engine but it's a RIP off of gamebryo which happens to be 23 yrs old. 
---
Zenimax made ESO,a subsidie of Zenimax, Battlecry made 76 and redesigned creation engine to work for 76. Never mentioned ESO bud. Stop trying to spin the fact they released an unbalanced broken game as a good thing because you can provide feedback. If you look on the forum and I have had my eye on it the past week or so, A LOT of peoples voices have changed to agree with me that BGS fucked up and they keep fucking up. Honestly the fact you keep linking me to the design team makes me feel like your a paid shill at this point no-one who thinks this game is THAT good is gonna be on here defending it they would be PLAYING it. 
---
using SPECIAL PERKS for crafting wouldn't be such a pain in the ass if you had a second special you could change to. like 2 loadouts. fuck would that have been nice. 
---
I notice you didn't give a reason. Prick it is then.
---
Great ideas.  But I don‚Äôt like how the game a mod is locked to a specific weapon/armor type.   For example once I unlock a scope I should be able to put it on any gun that can be attached with a scope. 
---
I started off thinking I'd put my power armor on for combat. Now I take it off bc my sneak game is so strong. Other than scorchbeasts I can 1-2 headshot most enemies non vats.  My armor piercing shottie and instigating pipe rifle help.
---
Many people who are angry with B.G.S. over resent changes to the game have begun a concerted effort to dissuade players from playing F76. Build simple bases that can be repaired with least amount of materials
---
I knew some one in gta who did the same thing. He didn‚Äôt have money on him so when he blew up peoples stuff they had to pay the insurance instead of him. 
---
U need different plans for regular, sturdy and heavy?
---
I didn't even realize there was a patch today.  No need to be a dick lol
---
Yes
---
This idea sounded fantastic and got progressively worse as I read through these.
---
I haven't looted handmade extensively so I cannot comment on those. What are the caliber, and is it a single shot rifle? If you have stealth damage perk that can stack on rifleman or commando, I think a handmade can be made to be a highly viable mid range weapon. I have a backup .38 combat rifle that makes short works of lv40 to lv68 mods, most are dead within 4 quick pulls of trigger.
---
Sometimes the simplest solution is the one that never comes to mind until we've exhausted every other possibility.   
---
The most intelligent people are often stumped by the most elementary of solutions, as our arrogance makes us think we'd have already checked that. 
---
I found it at the random event spot above the billboard above Blackwater mine.  My camp is up there and it was in one of the events that spawned there.
---
Yeah wish we would see character name by default, and Gamertag as an optional setting
---
T . T
---
If you visit him once every 24 hours or so there's a good a chance a legendary shows up to fight with him. Makes for a good location to add to your daily legendary farming grind. And if the drop turns out to be shit you can sell it to Phoenix right away.
---
Ok so the easiest way is to find a vendor with the plans. Just jump around to find it. Easier way is to use xbox marketplace and spend s ok me caps.
---
I totally feel you ... Can I have your stuff?
---
Well with bloody mess, adrenaline and adrenal reaction around 1/4 health the damage is 341. Its a sneak build so health doesn‚Äôt matter, and sneak attacks do 2.5x, not much will survive that. I also run stinging mag for more penetration, 35 rounds is more than enough imo.
---
For scorchbeast I can add a vats crits every 3rd shot on top of the sneak attacks. I think a normal crit is 2x damage? Better crits adds another 40%, eagle eyes adds 25%, and I think I read tweaked receiver adds 33%. So scorchbeast are not an issue either.
---
Tho I am guessing sneak/vats crits will be next in line for a nerf once more people start using it after the inevitable melee nerf.
---
Yes :) I like my tag chaoscythe but I would like people to see what my character is named 
---
Thank you - and apologies to the OP for not clarifying.  I was NOT meaning the Op was dumb for picking it up, and I apologize to those that thought I did.
---
As to the other guy... we‚Äôre citizens of various countries playing a game made and legally owned by a private company.  You may think you‚Äôre some bold rebel bucking the shackles of social norms, but you just come off as an edgy tween.
---
I think it was like that back on FO4.  
---
&gt; impossible to farm up the atoms when they're only up for a day or two. I get that makes some people more likely to buy atoms 
---
See what you just did, right there, is "prove" in the mind of the lunatic in charge of the Atom Shop that they're right and everything's perfect the way it is.
---
Only solution available to you: don't buy anything in the Atom shop. Maybe, possibly, eventually, after they've run out of "market conditions" to blame, and underlings to throw under the bus... MAYBE the Head Genius will be replaced.
---
I'm not holding my breath.
---
I totally feel you bro ... Can I have your stuff?
---
This is what Fallout is supposed to be about.
---
It's a shame the dupers and the pay 2 win crowd destroyed this.
---
Congrats on your find.
---
Cool story bro
---
what do you mean the usual bloody buffs don't work? I have a 2 shot and bloodied shot gun (separate guns) with explosive and the bloodied still hits in the 1000s while the 2 shot is 500.  
---
If done correctly yes. I think alot of people have an issue with no human NPCs or bustling settlements. I think it would be thw most practical way to bring in NPCs that would make sense... I would just love to see them in this story line.
---
Dear Evan Hanson 
---
Is there a reason you're being a dick or is that your normal day to day attitude.
---
All mods? or specific ones?
---
I'm similar. Played most days until the last set of patches and since then i've logged in only once. Even that session was clogged with bugs and i just got tired of being permenently invisible with my quest markers leading seemingly nowhere.. 
---
I made a deal with myself that i'd finish getting the platinum trophy (at 85%ish on completed trophies) then i'd move on. 
---
Thanks, will Add
---
Herd mentality doesn‚Äôt make you right. 
---
Read the last link I posted. 
---
Or even display some guns or power armor or those stupid multicolored teddy bears people like to collect... I mean seriously why let us construct magazine racks and display cases but then not let us display anything on them...its really pointless.
---
Lol thanks I just fixed it
---
Hahahahaha....no
---
Don‚Äôt forget the fact that everyone needs to boost strength over the top to begin with just to manage carry weight, and that stregnth increase means melee damage increase, an equivalent which does not happen with a perception/agility/luck build for ranged.  So there is an inherent imbalance to begin with.  Then add the literally dozen ways to further increase strength via under-armor, power armor, upgrades etc and even non-melee builds have to depend on melee.
---
If they are going to let strength increase melee damage without even adding a single perk, they should have equivalent increases for damage for perception for rifles, agility for auto guns, luck for pistol etc.  I know that these add other features like more AP or crit damage but STILL this is nowhere near enough compared to the massive boost melee gets from basically every build since they are all so dependent on increasing strength simply for the carry weight and weight perks
---
Feedback:
---
CAMPs stand for Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform.  Except it's not a mobile platform and there's no real construction assembly freedom.  The snapping of pieces are very rigid, add in the lack of a clipping ability and you end up with basically a small square building for a camp in an inconvenient spot of a convenient location, and that's assuming you have the budget to even turn your camp into a personal space and not a generic base.
---
Solutions: Enabling Clipping, Disable Snapping, QoL Changes, and Secondary Camps
---
**Clipping**
---
Include the ability to enable clipping for certain camp pieces, foundation pieces already can clip partially but could use full ability to clip into the sides of cliffs.  Other camp pieces that need clipping support include stairs, walls, and especially defense pieces like fences and barriers.  It's okay to keep pieces from being placed in inaccessible spots (underneath the ground), but that I can't even build a foundation piece into a cliff face or in a tree is annoying.
---
**Snapping**
---
Ability to disable construction snapping, that way we can place fences and walls certain ways without their other parts getting in the way, along with this completely and absolutely disable the inability to move items snapped to and 'supporting' other items, I don't care if I have a floating piece of floor, I do care if I'm forced to rebuild my entire camp because two pieces fell in love and became inseparable.
---
**QoL Changes**
---
We were told to *Rebuild Appalachia*, instead I'm camping on a junk pile like a hobo, my stash is a joke, my inventory management is a joke, junk item weights are completely a joke (teddy bears weigh 1lb, empty military ammo bag weighs 3lb's?  There are better ways to balance your junk.), overall a big portion of playing this game is *frustrating*, I was told I'd be playing this game like a fallout game.  If that's true then fix the sneaking and building, remove the Contractor perk's budget saving ability and make it automatic for everyone, keep the skill but only make ot reduce material costs.  Remove the Covert Operative skill and make it automatic for everyone, keep the skill but make it act like the Skyrim level 100 Sneak skill where crouching forces enemies to disengage and search for you.  Remove the damage perk cards for all guns and explosives and *make them automatically active for everyone*, balance that with much better damage resistance buff skills instead of damage output buff skills so everyone can fight to survive decently, but those who invest in damage resistance can at least stand a chance if they get surprised by being as much of a bullet sponge as some enemies.  Hell make a perk that keeps you from being one-hit, I've seen legendary enemy's whose health sticks at 1hp if you damage them fast enough with a legendary weapon, make it the same for players with a perk instead of nerfing everything, that way one-hitters can't kill with their one-hit weapons, at all, ever, a damage cap can enforce this, if they're ever hit for more than their targets full max health, they always are left with 1hp that rapidly heals up to a third of their full health, this causes the need to switch to something weaker for any kind of killing blow on the attackers part.  This should not work outside of pvp.
---
**Secondary Camps**
---
But if you won't do any of that then do this one thing, give me **at least** a secondary camp (I'd prefer three to five seperate camps but I understand the issue of performance), make this secondary camp have a budget that supports **at max** One Tent, All Workbenches, and a Stash, with a bit extra for one Missile Turret or two mk1 turrets, do not allow any foundations or other construction structures to be built beyond decor (portapotties, tents, not walls, floors, or such) and don't allow food or water to be placed, only power, connectors, defenses and such.  The idea is I can spend 50+ caps to place a secondary camp down so that I do not need to fast travel to my primary camp, and can instead stay out in the world map so that I can simply put down a tent, bed, workbench, stash, turret, and stow my scrapped junk, refill my health and get well rested, and craft whatever I can to manage my weight without having to go through a loading screen, fight enemies at my camp, scrap/craft/store, then fast travel back to my previous location.  I just want to have my base, and the ability to setup temporary smaller camps so I'm not forced to return to my base after every other point of interest that I find.
---
At the very least please consider giving us these smaller camps so we can be like the overseer and legitimately explore the map without constantly needing to return to wherever we have a really great setup.  Please...
---
ya . you buy it for 200$ on Bethesda website
---
So we don‚Äôt have constant head-on collisions and, ya know, murder.
---
The community managers have been pretty active lately; maybe they can relay some of this post and comment to the devs. This reply sums up my thoughts and feelings almost exactly.
---
What say you, u/ladydevann?
---
It‚Äôs cumulative. I had 3k when it popped for me
---
No offense, but this is as useful as saying "Here's all you need to success: know when to do the right thing, and don't fail"
---
that would require Bethesda to put NPCs in the game
---
They did but they only store up to three so you'll need to check back often
---
Not true. Level 161 and I have complete Assassins armor kitted out.
---
I had a level 67 griefing me yesterday and I went through 15 stims.
---
His deathclaw was chipping away at my health big time.
---
Whole time he was screaming over the mic to get me to engage in PvP.
---
PC?
---
Doing fine on [PS4] ü§ûüèº
---
skyrim togeother . made by devs that dont work for Bethesda . so its not going to be hot garbage 
---
&gt;  perk for their build. Isn't this supposed to be a game that allows options and choices?
---
If there's a perk for 90% reduced weight for a major item category you can either choose to take it or choose to screw yourself over.
---
You take no damage and you have the advantage over them. Finish vending and when they go to vend, just head shot them since you will do full damage after the initial slap. It is near impossible to kill somebody with slap damage. My instigating dragon (which 1-shot kills anybody in pvp with a headshot) barely tickles anybody when they are not engaged.
---
Good advice in theory... However, I've stopped playing mid-December, and it sounds like the recent patch only made the game worse, not better. x\_x
---
(I still visit this subreddit because some of the fan art/pics can be pretty amusing.)
---
This.
---
Move your base somewhere you KNOW has a high chance of being occupied the next time you log in.
---
You pay the move price once,  everything is fixed and then when you log in again you get to move your camp for free.
---
Mmm that‚Äôs next level stalking! Like super creepy üòÇ
---
Mine might not been a revolver since there are many variants of pipe weapon.
---
Sorry for this late reply for your well thought out input. Yes, it's a big wide world and gaming is only a small part of everything, but for me as a long time gamer the shaddy and sometimes outright malicious practices within the gaming industry rub my fur the wrong ways for more times than I can count.
---
Sorry man, I was on my way to work already when you replied. I won't be back on until Thursday night. If you still have them by then I'll still buy them both. 1000 caps, but if you gotta get rid of them before then it's cool.
---
just like they said everyone that got BANNED was deserving of it . 
---
RTFM
---
‚ÄòRead The Fine Manual‚Äô is more tactful? ;-)
---
Totally agree with your post. I have a max level Instigating black powder rifle (mind you 1 star only!) and with maxed-out riflemen perks + tank killer I can take out a level 91 deathclaw from stealth with a body-shot. And this without actually min-maxing (I don't even run Bloody Mess on my build nor any criticals).
---
Level 61 super mutants die in 1 shot even from non-stealth.
---
I imagine running a vats critical on this gun will easily down a high level scorhbeast in 1 shot also (albeit might need to be a headshot).
---
Also my 1 star quad handmade with the anti-armor bullets easily kills supermutants. I can take out all super mutants in Harpers Ferry without even reloading the gun.
---
I really don't understand people complaining about bullet sponge enemies with the kind of builds you can pull out in this game.
---
You seriously do not find an issue with shipping a broken game several weeks before christmas? "Oh no there's the benefit that i get to put my 2 cents in IDC." I really could care less you use the word "toxic" it makes you sound like a lady man which you most likely are since your on reddit. But really your an idiot if you think what BGS did benefitted you the consumer and wasn't just a cash grab before chrismtas.
---
You can just scrap the frame and the pieces will unequip from it right then.
---
If you bothered reading the link I sent you before forming opinion and spraying vitriol, you‚Äôd know the answer. 
---
Hope Survival mode makes enemies attacks lethal and yours as well so you'd have to carefully plan each attack/defense. 
---
Can confirm. Level 53 and still sneak a lot. The Wasteland is a dangerous place.
---
i felt this way going into the mire. pitch black, no music, trees and their vines, felt like something could jump out at me at any given time. it gave me a genuine sense of fear, but only in the mire 
---
Congrats, I'm still waiting for one (or *any* explosive handmade, for that matter). Buut, just an hour ago, I found an instigating explosive combat rifle, and I already modded it into a badass (looking), armour penetrating sniper rifle. Let's see how well it does out there.
---
It's a bit unfair though that explosive guns started dropping for me only after the nerf. Over the last few days, I collected an explosive shotty, an explosive harpoon gun, and now this.
---
Not at all, until the ever looming threat of other players killing me at any moment and takin all of my inventory will I ever worry lol!! Damn is this game pretty tho
---
Fast is a gimmick? Lel. My instigating knuckles disagree.
---
I just want the atomic shop to have cooler stuff. Most of it is just so stupid in a fallout game.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen any Enclave armor that‚Äôs legendary other than the one you have mentioned.
---
Pity actually as it has better stats that combat armor. 5 extra ballistic on the limbs.
---
I think the chest isn‚Äôt as good though. 60/40 v 61/61 for combat armor. 
---
But the limbs possibly aren‚Äôt as good as BOS Combat Armor which when fixed to 200% I can get almost 60 ballistic resistance. 
---
Getting wood at night in the western part of the map was definately the most ive been spooked in this game so it's understandable haha.
---
That is the purpose of those specific laws.
---
I mean try server changing if not then I don‚Äôt know, ask if they can actually take the items, get them to test it on 1 wood or something. If they can then I would wait untill the next patch comes out to play again if they can‚Äôt then I mean it‚Äôs a minor inconvenience 
---
There needs to be a sorry emote.  Maybe something with a maple leaf.
---
There are 90% weight reduction perks for fusion cores/energy ammo, ballistic ammo, and chems and those are all things you don't lose upon death. Weapons are exactly what you should be storing (since you can't realistically equip all their reduction perks at once and rifles don't even have one anyway.
---
I guess I wasn‚Äôt going for a super detailed break down of everything in the game. Everyone else on here is doing a fine job of that. I was more so going for a birds eye view of where the progress bar currently sits. And when looking at it from this point of view, it really doesn‚Äôt look nearly as bad as most people say it is.
---
I did AWOL armaments for the first time the other day.
---
3 Waves of Colonel Gutsies. My 3* Troubleshooters boxing glove can take them out in 3 hits (2 if i use a critical)
---
but when theyre swarming you like that, still died like 5-6 times
---
But they're harder to kill than Sentry Bots and Assaultrons!
---
I found one in the ski resort Rise sends you to when collecting holotapes. Sunny top I believe?
---
what are you playing on? because on console you have a huge time delay between action and response.
---
God damn mole men
---
I have this issue when attacking using vats with an instigating knife
---
The 5 or so mods that are arm only mods (not the limb mods that apply to both arms and legs). I'll look at my spreadsheet and post the mod names and the missing keyword shortly.
---
I mean, it's not like this is unknown to the developers. It's not like people here are unaware of how to fix the game. The problem lies solely in the execution
---
Had this happen to me the other day with the Fusion Reactor plan. Bought it, and it's no longer in my inventory and my C.A.M.P. says I don't have the plan. No clue where it went. Husband bought his at the same time and he had his. Boo. :(
---
Agreed. Is there a reason why you want the coat?
---
I have a furious + swing weapons, two-hand and one hand.  It doesn't matter which one I use.
---
Mothman variant and others will be atom available, but in game mods can be found.
---
I play on PC.
---
It's definitely a lag issue. I get it occasionally, the easiest fix is to exit from VATS (if you're using it) and give it a few seconds. I also find equipping a different weapon and switching back helps. 
---
Really would love to see all the weapons being balanced. And the flame ammo needs some attention; the materials required are way too high.
---
trying to see if fo76 is better so i can finally use plasama weapons seriously, but looks like it's not
---
Just don't touch any buttons for 20 or 30 seconds when you first load in. Annoying I know, but once you can pull out weapons you are good to go.
---
Finally did that quest the other day. Was expecting protectrons
---
saw 3 waves of Gutsies an died a bunch of times. Definitely one of the few enemies in the game i dread taking on
---
my DR is 400+ and they can still melt me in 3-4 shots. Waves of them? Bonkers
---
Hmm.   PS4 as well.  
---
technically it's in all video games but people normally feel that time distortion in fps games, you might get around it by just 3rd person viewing
---
I can second this, give corpses a small glow so they don't blend so much with the environmental brush, give containers we're looking at this glow and make that glow enable/disableable in the settings options.
---
Literally only want it cause it matches the assault gas mask and green hood. I don‚Äôt even collect clothes. I just like that outfit. Wrong one to like I guess haha.
---
I can teach how to get around, it's a skill not glitch fix though, but you basically just preamp all acitons, you do it in every video game. I use a metronome with my controller. most pro players have programs that warm them up.
---
Yeah, the worst example of my point is steel, but I went with it bc it's what OP was looking for.
---
The best is probably Charleston Landfill. I got 50 screws in one session by holding the workshop for 5 hours (w/o getting disconnected once!) while hitting up my favorite places to go for typewriters and desk fans.
---
I agree to an extent
---
Yes the ammo can weigh alot but depends on what ammo type it is, it weighs more depending on how effective the gun using them is. For example i have absolutely no perks reducing weight on my ammo and 5mm ammo is the lightest there is and its because for the weapon to be effective it needs to dish out a crap ton of bullets furthur more ammo like the .50 cal ball weighs more cause the weapon is a one shot weapon that is more effective with one bullet
---
Also the game has really light ammunition cause in another survival game i play (ark survival evolved) every 10 rounds weighs 1 pound
---
I agree that there shouldnt be bullet sponges but all depends on your weapons and perks. 
---
And i strongly agree about the weapons weight because im tired of getting a bunch of rifles to scrap for mods only to be over encumbered every time
---
But hope bethesda listens
---
Huge problem for me is ammo storage. You can‚Äôt sell ammo and over time it eats a lot of space.
---
it basically means you have to use a little bit of prediction with you eye tacking
---
Thanks.
---
That is a nice find, especially if your a sneaky sniper :) I carry a instigating/explosive with me for ammo variety and it does good even though its just a pipe rifle lol. So I imagine a combat rifle will be great.
---
I played an ungodly amount over the weekend and I'm happy to report it was mostly smooth sailing. I only got dropped once, and I'm pretty sure it was because I hit the AFK limit (not sure how long I was actually gone, but it was awhile).
---
My husband and I have been so forgiving and made so many excuses for Bethesda, but we've both recently gotten to our breaking point. Which I hate because I wanted to buy Elder Scrolls 6 as soon as it comes out but now we wont. I've been an TES fan for forever but I dont trust bethesda anymore.
---
What I've gathered from this nonsense lately has been "we didnt make enough content, so we're just going to make it harder so it takes you longer to do the little bit we DID make." And if that isnt the biggest middle finger after EVERYTHING ELSE then I don't know what is.
---
I'm level 99 and I just finished the Brotherhood quest today. That was my last quest. The only reason it even took me so long is because Early Warnings had been glitched since BETA for me up until this past week. Now we have nothing to do other than things we've already done, grinding, or just hunting resources.
---
I'm sure they'll say they're planning on adding content, but just nerfing all our guns, servers kicking us off, making bullet sponges etc isnt helping in the meantime. Its just making the game piss us off when we do play, which is becoming less frequent. But they've already got our money, so who cares?
---
And dont get me started on enemies killing me before I even fully load into a place. My husband and I stagger out our arrival times so whoever gets there first might can protect the 2nd while they're trying to load in. Its stupid.
---
I'm the miserable one lol? Who's making posts because they are "sick of people whining about bans."? Is it me? Nope, I'm here to stop people from doing something they will regret. A quick search for "Xbox hardware ban wave" will tell you why your friends aren't HW banned yet. This shit isn't new, it's been going on for over a decade. Again, stop giving out bad advice. Getting defensive about being wrong doesn't make you any more right. Good intentions, but bad advice.
---
I have a bloodied rocket spiked baseball bat that outperforms most two handed weapons.  Definitely agree with you that there are viable single handed weapons.
---
As a melee player that frequently dumps ammo in this regard, it's nice to hear that someone finds it and actually uses it! :)
---
\^This.
---
Damn good luck, hope your guys caps were not wasted.
---
Yup, all it needs is everything that makes a game good and it's there. Simple.
---
I don't use VATS while I'm chasing someone with a machete, it takes away the fun.  SM usually runs for about 3\~4 seconds before they find cover or just turns around and shots at you again.  If it my hits didn't register at all while they're running for that long, I would assume my latency is between 2\~4k ping?
---
I have a 25Mb synchronous connection but there's no way of knowing what my ping while in game (it would be a good feature though).  I do live in Asia and I don't think the ping would be that bad.

---
Maybe nerf damage resistance, increase enemy spawns? Increased power, increased danger, about same rate of bullet use. Would make explosives more usable as well.
---
But I mean, guns kinda do weigh thirty pounds.... the CND deterioration is bs, but they got all the weight stuff just fine 
---
Yes lmao and I would hide in the restroom whenever he visited the stations to trade.
---
Yes, I have always suggested the idea of a 'public' and 'private' stash!
---
Except that in this game until you get to stupid high levels and can re-spec on a whim... there's no point to storing weapons you aren't using. Its wasted space. Same with the ammo for them. 
---
Also.. unless you're playing a mule.. you can't have all the damage perks and all the weight reduction perks at the same time.
---
I blasted https://youtu.be/iPUmE-tne5U as I went through the lucky hole mine, not spooky at all.
---
Vault tech has the mechanic for you! Just try using v.a.t.s
---
I grabbed 5 workshops, had an almost constant string of defending and held for 5 hours. I ended up pulling every cosmetic item and all my power armor chassis out of my stash to keep up with the junk as well crafting boatloads of ammunition. 
---
See that‚Äôs the confusing part. I think the BoS plans give you the mod for all three versions. I can‚Äôt remember if I got the arm plans, but I know I can at least make those. I can‚Äôt do chest. And while scrapping combat armor, I know I saw BoS unlock for legs. But I can‚Äôt make it for the two legs I have, which are a heavy and a normal. (Didn‚Äôt think about it till I noticed my shoulders looked so different). I just scrapped a random piece
---
So I don‚Äôt know
---
As a flux seller I can‚Äôt agree with you. I consider flux as rare isotope. Isotopes can be obtained in atomic reactors and can be part of pre-war technology

No need, I'll check them in Xedit, just was curious if it was all / most or a specific one.  
---
Fantastic info, thanks
---
Its like in Fallout 4. The very first raiders you meet have 40 hp and later about 1500 hp. Problem is, there is no damage scaling when you level up.
---
Bethesda, if you need help with that message me or look at my Better Locational Damage mod for FO4. Thats how it should be. 
---
Heh, if you would earn atoms for that, I'd be a millionaire. My first "wtf" or "c'mon what now" moment usually comes within 5 minutes after logging on.
---
Haha this game is confusing
---
Yah but Sentry Bots are kinda really dumb.  If you‚Äôve ever built a sentry for the FO4 Robot dlc you know just how poor their design is.
---
As for Assaulttrons they are more like commandos with stealth, deadly close quarters and a Hellava party trick tucked under their hats.
---
General Atomics got it right with a durable versatile all purpose robot.
---
Free gins are always cool
---
i'll slap some calibrated shocks in your legs for the right price ;)
---
Have heard atleast 3 languages from those "griefing".   
---
Makes me believe it's non-organized and likely just what they appear to be, and generally speaking a buggy game is a griefers dream
---
Agreed. I made the post after seeing a lot of people commenting that there are a million things still wrong with 76 and that it‚Äôs a completely broken game. It‚Äôs really not in my opinion. It‚Äôs just in need of some more tweaks and polish, but overall it‚Äôs still a really enjoyable fallout experience. I think that gets lost in a lot of the technical posts I see on here. That‚Äôs all. That‚Äôs why I posted. Didn‚Äôt mean to come across as useless. 
---
Last patch it was crashing at whitesprings nuke event like clockwork. I went a whole session solo the other day, no crashing. Someone did some work on fo4 and said the hud mod on your pa helmet causes this. Something about it sharing the hud with npc and teamed/unteamed players around causing the crash.
---
hi I think it may be being worked on. Most games are not balanced for the average consumer so most discourse over actual weapons is mute. however, any sort of competitive standings or endeavors of people right now are being wasted; survival is only the beginning on the never ending journey games go through with balance.
---
Content will be the hard part as hardcore fallout fans want crazy in-depth stories and lore(something traditional fallout games are known for). The story/quests only provide a single game loop in fo76 where in past titles you had to play multiple times thru to see all the story/quests as progress on one side would stop or end many other quests and parts of the story. This isnt that style of fallout tho and I cant preach enough that there are simple gameplay loops missing that keep replay value alive. 
---
Might be worth revisiting later, if it's still around 
---
The highest DPS weapon I have is a Mr Handy Buzzsaw Blade. Keep it over 150% weapon condition and it's pretty formidable. My walk around weapon is a combat knife for the exact reasons you described
---
I‚Äôll just spec a melee build and hit super mutants with my missile launcher. 
---
Is it just me or has this been established by devs a gazillion times already?
---
Not talking about them doing it or not and how idle they are about increasing stash weight, but damn theyve replied the most to this topic than any other. Something to do with server stress...yada yada.
---
Give in to the dark side
---
Yes. They don't even let you sell the ammo so why not let us hoard it. 
---
I‚Äôm keeping my mutants explosive cryolator forever now
---
It probably will be a dungeon boss. Maybe nuke boss like the queen? It's definitely alive if you look
---
it's unfortunate that these means may not seem to justify the end as many consumers are displeased with how their own experience is affected by this but I think both can be looked at worked on at the same time. I think postitive communication and community participation are the most important things for this. I don't see enough guilds in game you know what i mean
---
Yeah pretty sure I tried that too. It was fairly early on post release and I seem to remember that the hit boxes were bugged on the harpoon gun... 
---
"[...]and where **are** team is at in addressing them."
---
This is just another recordable moment in history where quantity over quality screwed over more people than was necessary.
---
Seriously, Bethesda higher-ups, the hell is wrong with you all?  Flush your greed, move away from this 7 Days to Die practice of -releases an unfinished broken game for a disproportionate price, updates add more stuff breaking a bunch of other things, bug fixes are inconsequential as each update that adds content spawns dozens of new bugs-
---
You're supposed to *build the whole thing solidly* before you start messing with it.
---
Where you this from ?
---
I'm pretty new to the game; What do you mean by "the damage thresh hold?" Is there a combat mechanic that I don't understand?
---
You had me at steal from others stash xD
---
Decontamination showers should not require flux. Rare radioactive isotopes are not required to make a decontamination system.
---
Something fishy going on there!
---
By 2 patches do you mean the patch + Hotfix or the earlier Jan patch!
---
Not really, all the different kids of stuffed bears make it seem like there‚Äôs an incentive to collect them, or at least a nod that we *could* collect them for fun. 
---
Then there‚Äôs the rare unique junk that noobs don‚Äôt know if it will be necessary for a quest later on, like jangles the moon monkey. 
---
I was scrapping baseballs and beer bottles before I realized I could make grenades out of them, so the game itself teaches you that junk may be used for something way more valuable than 3 glass or 2 cloth. 
---
Yeah, those 3 points are everything that makes a game good. Period. 
---
It is being made artificially harder. I have no problem with hard games, but when your RNG system isnt working, your enemy are just bullet sponges, you dont balance weapons, you have weapons break fast, etc etc then I have a problem. 
---
I finally had my final straw to break the camel's break. I lost half my collection of magazines, all bobblehead heads I was collecting (not a ridiculous amount, I don't dupe) and a bunch of weapons including some choice 1s like TSE gauss, 3* grognak, 3* aa dragon, when I was trying to change items over to different characters (because they changed the weight restriction which makes it impossible to be a vendor, let alone keep some stuff for yourself, and they don't have a mailing system which has is a STAPLE of soooo many online games.). Low and behold, half way through putting my items into a box to jump. The server goes down. I've lost it all. It wasn't my game disconnecting, I had friends on the server to make sure I get back and everyone was knocked.
---
 I sat through alot with this game, but that really hurt me last night. I'll still jump on to do daily challenges every now and then, but I was building up to be a merchant, I had a flourishing home building business. And it's too difficult to keep moving items around between characters now. I already started looking at what I'll start playing now instead
---
Hahaha okay loser.
---
Im such a noob i dont even know what flux is yet, anyways i really hope bethesda reads this cause i cant imagine getting my base bombed to hell and back
---
You sound experienced in real stalking lol
---
I'm ps4 and for some reason I can always figure out something, like vats or weapon swapping in combination. But sometimes it just aint your server, you know what I mean.
---
This was known a month ago.
---
It might not be your internet specifically. Sometimes the servers that have been active for a long period of time just take a poop. A good litmus test is at log in... If you have a fully budgeted camp and it takes more then two minutes to load in it's a sign the server, or your connection to it, isn't all that stable. If it loads in under two minutes your session will go better as far as my experimenting tells me. There's a whole host of factors that effect your connectivity to servers, and many of them are out of your control. But as I said originally, switching weapons and giving it a few seconds to catch up to you will help. If after two hits nothing is happening you need to give it a few seconds so you're system and the server can properly talk to each other.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people on here act like this towards people.
---
I agree. Unfortunately, fallout is full of absurd. Sometimes, it‚Äôs funny, like kids toys full of lead, sometimes it‚Äôs just lazy game design, like damage of .50 ammo
---
Upvote, great work!

I had BOS Combat Armor unlock after scrapping 200+ combat armor items. It was the only one I needed so I could be BOS complete, and I go to upgrade my heavy combat legs and it‚Äôs not there.
---
I think the mods may be specific for each type OR it‚Äôs bugged as all hell. Anyone able to apply BOS to one type of leg and not another? I don‚Äôt have a light or medium one to test it on.
---
I'll have to try this.
---
Oh did someone delete their latest post? Oh so sad. Like I said no one cares about you or your thoughts your dismissed!
---
I meant it in a kinda vague way. there isn't any breaking points or anything, it's more you need to be hitting high enough damage to make you're bullets worth something.
---
I‚Äôve heard reports suggesting that the vendor bot spontaneously dies after a certain length of time. Have never observed it myself, of course.

Today I logged in just to be harassed by a SB as soon as I could move. Not even a chance so sneak and hide.

It's true, plus you can run around making Godzilla noises.
---
Kind of related- its been a while since I looked at this but I think it was robot I noticed this on. I unlocked the muffled mod on the *arms* from scrapping, where every other armor type ive unlocked muffled on the legs (which would make more sense). I was kind of confused by the EDID that listed muffled as a "limb" mod (in my experience if it only says "limb" it unlocks both arms and legs simultaneously.

I think it‚Äôs enough.

Enough if you constantly go through your stash and throw stuff out. Go through your junk and drop everything you probably won‚Äôt use. 
---
But the problem with that is. It‚Äôs a chore. It takes time and it‚Äôs boring. 
---
And that‚Äôs something no game should ever be. Tedious.

I can make do just fine but I wish it was 800-1000.

I bumped against one of the bots and my mutations activated and they started wailing down on me, now i suppress once i see they spawned in

I've started to draw towards that as a viable option. My only concern is how long it would take to get the tick blood necessary to make stimpak farming viable. How much tick blood can you get in a twenty minute farm? And how far will that go?

I've played it. Thank god I never bought the bloody thing myself, but I've played it. It. Is. Garbage. I don't know why you think that people who say that this game is terrible have never played it, but you're barking up the wrong tree with that claim.
---
I really like how you spout bullshit like that and then you try and pre-empt people taking a problem with you, by claiming that some will lie about playing it. It's not as if that's a really dishonest way to go about it, is it? /s

Odd, I've not heard this one before. On the other hand, I don't know that many people actually build the bear-proof trashcan. Can you get us some video or screenshots of this?

Theres a quick fix for that.

Uninstall.
---
Speaking of; this goes in my little prep-for-March stash. 
---
And they‚Äôre not missing it. They‚Äôre working on it as we speak. 
---
I bought it because it looks awesome, but I use a western revolver because it greatly outclasses the standard .44, so I don't know when I'll actually get around to using a .44 with the skin.
---
false.
---
Sucks to be youüòÇ

Sounds like you‚Äôve got some personal shit to work though man.

People might have more fun playing the game differently than you do and it‚Äôs totally okay for everyone to play they way they like.

Good luck out there!

Are you on pacifist mode?
---
It‚Äôs a waste land not a playground 
---
The combat armor mod in fo4 evened it a bit.  You could do a lot of realistic damage but super mutants and raiders also had m4s and 50 cals that would kill you in about 3 hits.  I liked that.   It was like hardcore mode in the battlefield games when they were still good.   
---
how so? it attacks me every time i'm not in outfit and seen it commit suicide 3 times.
---
Happened to me exactly. Got the pop up. Can‚Äôt make the legs. I know I‚Äôm wearing one heavy and one normal leg. So unless when scrapping I unlocked the sturdy leg and it doesn‚Äôt count for all three like the plans...idk
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification, makes sense. 
---
All the mobs ported over from FarHarbour DLC are insane bullet sponges (Mirelirk Kings, Gulpers (hate them!), RadRats (I think), etc). It's nearly always better to be power armoured and use a melee weapon to deal with them.  
---
Hell it's always better to use PA in an encounter of 2+ mobs, the damage to your normal armour is not worth it, and PA lasts a loooooong time before needing a repair.
---
They're trying to make a pop mode
---
Auto-scrapping bulk for crafting would be good. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly how survival mode in F4 was. Would be interesting to see that implemented (and would definitely appreciate it against friggin SB‚Äôs).

Same I have a AAE with faster reload Western and it with the right reciever is over 200 dmg meanwhile the others like the .44 and single action severely underperformed currently trying to work out a way to make my quad explosive .44 viable in a vats crit build. Maybe the will make it to were the skin works on all revolvers but thats wishful thinking.
---
Could you please put more items on the list of resources we can sell to Traders. There is hardly anything on that list and I have to dump a lot of useful stuff due to the weight problems. 
---
PS4 is having the same issue
---
was working good until the last hotfix
---
I honestly don't know. Depends on if you believe the horror stories on this forum or not.
---
Grafton Station, follow the tracks north, look for the Nuka Cola sign. Greg is a responder vendor bot in the building behind the sign.
---
There's no reason to split your damage/perks up like that. Stick with just 1 weapon, and preferably Rifle they are a lot better than Heavy atm. You will save yourself a ton of perks to use in other things to maximize Rifle damage even more.
---
Bethesda said that they will address the issue.  
---
Nope
---
I talked to a dude for like an hour the other day outside of Flatwoods. No quests or building or anything, just chatting about this game and others. 
---
Oh yup, but he still selling the plans after patch?
---
Best i can do is 13 caps
---
We have been dumping in the suitcase at watoga train station most times i look now there is stuff in there, i dont dump into bags at all
---
Making an adhesive farm might be useful to you - just have corn, tato mutfruit and purified water and you're set to make vegetable starch which can be broken down into adhesive. Having the perks Green Thumb and Super Duper will help too (Green Thumb letting you get 2 fruit/veggies from each plant and Super Duper, rank 3, gives you a 30% chance when crafting anything to get double results) so you get more bang for buck and might have a little extra to sell later on or just keep it for yourself. Bulk Adhesive sells for 20 caps with Hard Bargain rank 3 on.
---
&gt;  you can't have all the damage perks and all the weight reduction perks at the same time.
---
That's the point...you store them since you can't have all their weight perks.
---
&gt;there's no point to storing weapons you aren't using. Its wasted space. Same with the ammo for them.
---
Obviously you can have more weapons than you need to carry on you at once and a character with a Str build can swap between using shotguns, heavy weapons, and melee by just swapping perks out given enough levels to get all their perks and be able to use them all relatively well. Not that it matters since you could just be holding onto weapons for trade. And obviously you wouldn't be stashing ammo when there's no reason to with 90% weight reduction at 2 points for ballistic ammo with Bandolier. You'd just need to max Str which you'd probably want to anyway for melee use &amp; carry weight.
---
The lack of the pipe revolver on the Legendary tables is regrettably a known and beta old issue, still waiting for a fix
---
Sadly no. The Enclave equipment (scout armor, enclave plasma gun, and x-01 power armor) doesn't seem to be on any of the standard loot lists, which means legendary variants don't drop. I've yet to discover any schematics for them either, for that matter.
---
This. I have a almost full set of heavy combat vanguard. Minus left leg. Dmg resistance is over 400 I believe 
---
Awesome. Hang in there!
---
Imagine thinking this game is doing well.
---
That's stupid, should have installed a mod that lowered HP. 
---
Have hopped Grafton for BOS Legs so many times it‚Äôs threatening my mental health. I do not think the plans still show up here.
---
Because they annoying me by hitting me with a sledge hammer while I am shopping, it makes me feel better. Anyone who interferes with me gets reported. There are a 1000 things to do in the game, hitting or interfering with me should be the last thing on your list. Why can't they wait like everything else, because they dick heads and they know you will leave the vendor in fear of getting killed.
---
I've been having this issue since the hotfix, and I don't even have the card, non the less have it equipped. 
---
It bleeds if you shoot it as well. I was thinking it could be a nuke creature as well.
---
Lucky Hole was fun
---
Scenario 1:
---
Even with running handicap I'll clear the whole place before you reload twice between shots.
---
Scenario 2:
---
Shoot me with your fancy rifle to initiate pvp and I'll end you with one hit. One. 
---
Scenario 3:
---
Because melee players don't use ranged weapons, amirite?
---
I was pretty sure he did but I just ran to them and don't see them. All excavator mods, sturdy and heavy leather, SMG for me right now.
---
I found "friend" in the dictionary but the definition doesn't make any sense.
---
It doesn't add any, it just does very minor fire damage
---
I have held him for other people and he blows up himself quite a bit. Doesn't always happens but it depends where he is and how long he is standing around for.
---
The other issue is because you are still in the spot that spawns random events it can spawn a group of super mutants or ghouls. If somebody triggers the event he dies pretty quick after that.
---
Do the first few main quest missions for some easy levels, then start making the rounds at the Whitespring. Do "Minor Miracles" as soon as you hit level 25, you'll be thankful for the extra armor and carry weight while grinding. 
---
Nice shootin, Tex.
---
There should be in game server chat. I think more people would group up for events and some fun connections to be made. This game just continues to let me down on pc tho
---
It comes and goes, so it's definitely broken.
---
I've never understood this. A game is programmed to behave a certain way. It's not like a survival horror where things pop out at you and dissappear like slender man. 
---
You may have a creepy run in with a moth man.
---
Or I've never understood the people that are too disgusted by roaches or bugs to play the game. 
---
Like how do you people deal with real fucking life?
---
Camden park vendor has plans
---
No such thing since internet connections became a thing. But yeah, 76 is a low point.
---
Yeah and double the foods special ability
---
Play a better game, options are endless.  Players these days have that option than before.  I thought this would be like eso, but the hate &amp; better choices will run this game to the ground
---
An interesting point is that the survival mode in Fallout 4 increased the damage done across the board. Enemies did a lot more damage to you, sure, but you also did a lot more damage to them. I thought that was a really interesting way to handle the combat difficulty. 
---
Unfortunately they didn't carry any of that forward to Fallout 76. 
---
It hasn't come yet. They just said they are working on it.
---
Are there any good locations to farm plasma guns?
---
Interesting. Would that net me more than the 4 caps per bush of blackberry (green thumb hard bargain)? Like would breaking down the right proportions of corn tato and mutfruit into adhesive make more money than their bare parts? 
---
And responder bot in grafton (not the station bot, one inside town)
---
Found the plans as a random drop
---
Well, that's one way to save on customer support personnel, I suppose. 
---
Grafton responder bot has them too.
---
500+ levels. Sheesh. I know I'm casual but I feel like it's been a grind to get to lvl 73. 
---
They respawn when someone has joined the world &amp; traveled nearby your area
---
This one is grindy, and I've given up on it in favour of a CAMP that gives me the ability to make ammo instead of caps.. But here it is..
---
If you've discovered Solomon's Pond go to that area. There's a small townish thing near there. The 'town' spawns either Ghouls or Wolves and has a power armor spawn and all the benches. If you go towards the east side of the town and look to the cliffs towards the north there's a copper deposit and lots of copper veins around it. You can place your camp there and build your CAMP on it. If you're into base building it's an interesting spot to work with, and can do lots of creative things with it, so that's a plus. But if it not you can still throw down your basic stuff. Building a copper extractor is a must though. Between the extractor and the copper veins (which will refresh at log in, every time) you can become a copper producing machine. If you regularly server hop you can collect 100s of copper ore per day if you want. You also have the PA spawn that you can farm, plus meat from the wolves that spawn 50% of the time, and whatever you can pull from the Ghouls... The Ghouls are often charred as well, so good XP upon log in. 
---
Now here's the grindy part... Your new life will be farming acid, and if you're a shotgun build probably plastic too (I am never hurting for plastic with my build). You need the acid to smelt the copper. At times when you're running low you'll need find a method of getting easy acid... What I did was take Hemlock, which has three acid deposits. You get the added bonus of the workshop rewards from the take/defend quests. If you have an easier method to get acid all the better, but this is how I did it to build my reserves. If you have the time and patience you can clean out all the vendors on a daily basis selling bulk copper. 
---
Again, this is grindy, and maybe not the best method... But as far turning your CAMP into something designed to only produce caps it is viable, and worked for me.
---
With some practise. With so little time you probably don't have the best perks for hauling around stuff.
---
Not sure what that guy is talking about, the only level scaling damage bug I have heard of is with pvp and I thought that was fixed awhile ago. But hey he could be right, to many bugs in this game to keep up with lol.
---
I have a level 333 currently and I fight gutsys just fine with 3 pieces of troubleshooters gear. They have insane armor penetration but it only works on armor values not the % reduced damage effects/perks. So 3 of those and lone wanderer and the damage they do is very manageable. 
---
I know not everyone is going to want to run around with that kind of armor but I was just making a suggestion in case you want to go hunt some gutsy for revenge :).
---
Time for troubleshooting maneuver 002: uninstall the game and reinstall. 
---
People whining about melee being OP don't understand that ranged weapons on a game with a BUILT-IN AIM-BOT have a natural advantage over melee. This guy gets it.  
---
I do a melee/knives build. I actually need to think in order to PVP you. No hop, hop, pew, pew for melee'ers. Suck it up, riflers. When you get one-shotted by someone with a power fist, it's because you were stupid; not because melee is OP.
---
The whitespring golf clubhouse to be demolished next update.
---
The excuse was server stability. But im guessing more people are quitting than joining. Its probably at a point where they can just un cap it.
---
[This](https://nukacrypt.com/solved), if you're lazy.
---
Just a thing, I have never broke a camp with one exception : whitespring  f***ing ones with turrets in front of the club! I agree that the camp shouldnt  been damaged but remove the hability to base camp here!
---
 It's an Online survival shooter rpg which had an unacceptable amount of server crashing, grindy unbalanced survival mechanics, broken pvp and too weak weaponry, and incredibly shallow (though well written) story content.
---
They missed the mark on every single essential component of a game of this type. It can get better, but don't fool yourself. It's as bad as it seems. 
---
Playable and fun? For sure.
---
Broken as fuck and never should have been sold at a AAA price? For sure.
---
Yes. I had three when I started a few hours ago. Been in my armor the entire time using cores and I have 30+ now from the Mongah plant.I also defended it about four or five times and finally got some new plans.
---
Just make it like the Fallout 4 survival difficulty. That felt near perfect.
---
Yeah, I know griefing is generally used for those who do it on a larger scale, but as far as I'm concerned inviting someone to a team and then trying to kill them when the Player says "No" is still a form of griefing..
---
I suspect they were originally hoping I'd join so they could try and then kill &amp; rob me..
---
Which is why I tend not to do teams 
---
I‚Äôve been playing since ‚ÄúB.E.T.A.‚Äù and am only level 39. Guess I‚Äôm a slow grower...
---
It's all good. Just difficult to see intent here with so many repetitive posts. I try my best to just stay out of it, but that doesn't always succeed
---
Fallout 4 had much more replayability than 76 imo. You could play the game nich differently imo and get way more hours of enjoyment than 76. If you make a new character in 76 all you can change is your build. Not your faction, goals ect.
---
u/xxMeanWeanxx This is your answer.
---
I am level 60 and at that point. I dont know how u made it that high to be honest
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Pacifist doesn‚Äôt stop them from dealing damage, only prevents you from accidentally initiating PvP.  If you take over someone else‚Äôs shop, they try to claim yours, or you become wanted you are forced into PvP, pacifist or no. 
---
It's rather difficult with the current state of the game tbh. I'd love to make a clan or guild, but party up mechanics are piss-poor, large-scale group mechanics don't exist, and even simple things like pvp and trading are clunky and not intuitive. They can be fixed, sure, but it will take significant work
---
I'm not sure, I've always skipped the blood but with chemist...
---
2 tick blood makes 2 blood packs, 2 blood packs make 4 stims, 4 stims make 16 diluted stims, with charisma of 3 and rank 3 hard bargain 16 diluted stims are 48 caps
---
My Vampire's Combat Knife. Nothing short of a Yao Gui can cause damage fast enough to outpace the regenerative effect. 
---
Thank you for explaining. 
---
Unfortunately, this is another hit against build diversity. 
---
"You want to succeed? Use one of these three highly specialised character builds or you're cooked!" 
---
Min-maxing should be an option for hardcore folks who enjoy tweaking their builds. It shouldn't be a requirement to even play. 
---
I got one. Logged in/out and managed to nab two skeleton outfits and a spacesuit (sans helmet)
---
ESO shows both. One large and the other smaller underneath. Player can choose which is which. 
---
Haven‚Äôt been there. Is it a joke about the Mystery Hole?  
---
I'm lvl 58. I just did my first SBQ fight... She dropped a 3* TSE minigun for me... I don't know what is so hard :D
---
I'd like to agree, but unfortunately bethesda didnt figure out how to make end game loot, and the shower should probably be behind a big barrier, so this is the only way
---
We should have this too
---
I havent had that happen, only creatures breaking down the wall behind the generator to get inside, twice.
---
Uh your talking to mostly kids or adults that dont understand the mechanics of a video game. Most people understand if I press button a I will jump. They dont understand anything more than that. Talking about pre action is better suited for a semi pro gamer that already understands  the mechanics of gameplay.  That's like explaining what aiming a minute high (1/60 of a degree) means to a non sniper. And fyi most gamers still dont know how far a click is. So tel li ing someone to use a metronome to keep count in a game is pointless because most wont know what the hell to do with the extra noise.
---
Whitespring hotel, full of ghouls
---
Ouch, you got hit by ‚Äûno mans sky‚Äú AND ‚ÄûFallout76‚Äú?
---
You must be the unlucky dowsing rod for bad unfinished games 
---
What title do you want to play next, just asking so I can avoid it?
---
Perk cards and armor and mods for the power armor. there are perk cards and armor you can wear that give you extra carry weight for junk/meds/food. then there's also special mods you can put on your power armor that give you more carryweight and there's even a special set of Power Armor that can carry more than the others. Plus we have learned what we need to carry and leave the rest around for others to find
---
I know right. Although roaches are disgusting. That one Ortho pest commercial where the roaches are running around on the tv screen during the commercial makes me change the channel every time. 
---
‚ÄúWhere your attire‚Äù
---
Where my attire WHAT?
---
It‚Äôs already over. You blinked you missed it. I bought the Silver Shroud one so my character can look all femme fatale. 
---
Single adhesive alone? Probably not since you're not able to sell single adhesive (exessive adhesive in game) alone so bulking it would be your only option if you like to sell it, which like I mentioned, is more profitable as it sells for 20 caps.  Corn and tatos both sell for a single cap for each piece whereas mutfruit sell at 2 caps with Hard bargain rank 3 if I recall correctly. 
---
Oki for removing camp destruction but so no camp in front of the golf club allowed! These b**tards make me crazy! It shouldnt be possible to camp there!
---
Low level ghouls?
---
It Just Works!
---
All the most efficient methods of leveling were removed and replaced by bugs. I‚Äôm kidding, sort of. Melee is definitely endgame viable, in fact it‚Äôs now the only real contender seeing as how you just missed the most op ranged weaponry being neutered.
---
To bad I just got into bed. Iv got an extra space helmet. 
---
Event responder vendor bot does not turn hostile if you aren't wearing a specific outfit. Suicidal part is true tho. But I've only seen that happen once after hours and hours of holding him for people to come buy shit.
---
Where's a good place to farm it? 
---
Enjoy your nerfed gun

The Brotherhood will destroy your precious cult and make breakfast from your precious Mothman‚Äôs eggs.

Stacking intelligence to 20+, cranberry relish for 10% more xp, and of course well rested for 5%. Leader bobblehead is another 5% when available. If teaming up is your thing you can get another 15% with the charisma.
---
Also, it helps if your friends/siblings are married and/or have kids. This frees up your schedule a lot....lol.
---
Nope but if u have a higher level friend who can help u that could be a cool place
---
You seem to have misread their post. They are asking which vendor sells them, since vendor inventories are supposed to be static. They have already done what you told them to do.
---
You can always log off as a last resort.
---
These are the people who gave us $5 horse armor, remember. 
---
Fastest most efficient way to level is get a hazmat suit and a bunch of Molotov and follow around people in nuke zones lol eh also would be boring tedious and a waste of experiencing any of the game
---
We need to get a definitive drop point in the popular locations to share loot.  I've heard suitcases, cash registers, ice machines, sacks, bodies, etc.  I usually just drop stuff in front of the vendor as a paper bag.  I know it's found sometimes, not sure if it disappears if I log out.  A server-wide community stash at the train stations would be ideal, but I'm sure someone would exploit the hell out of it.  
---
As for stuff melee players might need; plans/recipes you have doubles of are great.  I don't use PA much but some people might appreciate fusion cores.  Magazines that don't apply to your build, low level melee weapons to scrap for mods maybe?
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much, people leave stuff mostly because they can't use it and would rather someone get it than it get dropped into oblivion.  Drop whatever you don't need or is taking up space, hopefully the game doesn't eat it before someone else gets it.
---
Good on you for wanting to give back.  If nothing else go drop everything in the Overseer's Camp and let a level 2 noob get it.
---
So you'd need ten blood per vendor at 200 caps per vendor. Times five and fifty tick blood maxes out the vendors every day. Do you think there is a way to farm fifty ticks a day? If it's doeable, this could work. 
---
just as with intelligence for repairing and making PA, bethesda may have introduced a cap at 20 for all abilities and just never bothered to tell anyone 
---
I hate it too, I made my entire build about running fast and discovered a hidden limit. So basically all I did after level 24 didn‚Äôt matter 
---
Just killed a flying 65 scorchbeast with 11 shots, no adrenaline built. I enjoyed it quite a bit. 
---
Hell, the ships going down so fast, they have squeeze the cash out of it while they can.
---
You mean like how sometimes those Watoga protectrons instantly suicide after spawn?
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad. I spent about an hour trying to find Clarksburg. I was pretty peeved to find it‚Äôs northwest of Morgantown. I was looking between Morgantown and Flatwoods.
---
Transfer caps to another character, go kill people‚Äôs bases &amp; kill them.  Very fun
---
Lol that's nuts. You realize even without duping some of us has closer to 100k ammo. Some few probably have more. No, that's totally not tracked as individual bullets. It's hilarious.
---
It may not fit your build, but there is a perk that has a chance to repair your weapons upon each hit. Can't remember what the % chance is but I haven't had to repair my weapons in a week or so. There's also a similar one for Armour. 
---
Rose Dress isn't the only one.  Asylum Outfits on females do this too, it's pretty bad when my friend asks me randonly why I'm panty flashing him.  I just tell him I'm a nurse having a wardrobe malfunction, not a prostitute.
---
There was another today?  
---
I still would rather Workshops worked on a buyout system. 
---
Increase the base price by at least 10x, and further increase the price based on how long the workshop has been owned. The caps paid would then be added to the owner's inventory, that way they aren't completely losing out. 
---
I'm glad someone else is upset about this. I can't help but think most players have missed it in the great shitstorm of Patch 5.
---
Fuck, I actually feel ripped off right now. I paid full cuck price for this shit game
---
Lol. Either you‚Äôre trolling or haven‚Äôt tried Two-Shot anything in VATS. Complete shitshow. 95% chance to hit, both shots miss. 
---
Yep. Great point.
---
And what seemed like a good idea (getting the perk for better deals at the vendor) only comes back to bite you when the vendor runs out of money more quickly.
---
It would be a big improvement if the amount I spent reflected 1 for 1 in the vendors balance. Example: vendor starts with 200 caps. I buy 200 worth of chems. Vendor now has 400 caps. 
---
I can confirm that Butcher‚Äôs Bounty works with tick blood, I got a bunch today. 
---
Honestly I don't know too much about extractors! Would you be able to sell the copper ore? And why would I need acid and plastic? The other methods I'm pretty familiar with, but honestly I've only seen one or two extractors and I haven't looked into that option as much! Is a junk extractor a thing too? I've seen them I think. 
---
Its not enough, but this game is so shitty that making it any bigger can cause this game to crash even more often than it already does
---
Wow is that some click bait spam
---
To deal with the high lvl gouhls at the golf course, use grenades. Run in throw some grenades then run out and jump on the wall by the pool. Any that follow you out hit with more grenades. This causes most of them to get limb damage so they can't chase you, then while they're lying there groaning unable to move, beat them to death with whatever melee weapons you have
---

---
Just do the quest if you're new. It won't be until 50+ until the need to farm levels is important. If you want to just get OP before engaging with quest just wander the forest area until about 15.. And than move into the Toxic Valley until 30. After that the Savage Divide, which you can farm your way to 50.
---
People are quitting for many reasons. Chief among them the fact that lag is insane (at least on PC lately). We can't do anything really fun. Try to kill ghouls in WS, lag. Nothing will load, or it takes 5 to 10 minutes for loot to load. And god help you if you have the whole server there. Try to launch 3 nukes at one time? Hahahaha yeah good luck. Hell launch ONE nuke and go kill the Queen and try to get any loot. You wait around for the loot to load and by the time it does the body is dissapeared. Or you can't find it. lag, lag lag. My mutations all quit working for an hour, loot not loading, players are invisible, players can't team up without first reloading the game, getting disconnected from servers, SERVER CONTROLS DISABLED when you're just about to do something important, hell my friend and I were both building bases at the same time and talking in team chat when the servers started lagging like nuts. And we were just building a basic structure. Not spamming the build buttons. 
---
Servers are always disconnecting. Or kicking us. All the time. We're so used to it we use discord and half the time we play we're trying to reload the game and get back in. 
---
Whitesprings robots inside do that too. They‚Äôll be walking and then just fall to their knees and die. Guess they‚Äôve had enough of Bethesda‚Äôs shit as well.
---
i asked how. i've done it. people say it isn't true so i never had suit on when looking for him. have to go put suit on. use stealth boy and let him calm down. so he stops attacking. all im getting from you is it's false because you say so.
---
Yeah I don't recall my other favorite games being any less enjoyable because my guns don't break every five minutes
---
This game, as I'm sure you've noticed, is insanely buggy and unoptimized. Top of the line gaming rigs are having problems running it.
---
There are 7 unique vendors, super duper would help reduce the number of blood necessary with a 30% chance of doubling anywhere in that scenario. Pharma farma could speed it up as well, a trip to flatwoods and Morgantown has a lot of containers to grab stims, radx and radaway all of which can be diluted and gain a lot of value with chemist 
---
The game fuckin sucks right now. They need some sort of end game
---
Yeah I have around 50 or so bushes, at 4 caps per bush I usually only clear around 200 bucks for my flora. Do you think, in your experience with adhesive farming, that it would be more profitable? I haven't tried it, so I don't know the exchange rates of resources/yield, etc...
---
Usually the suitcases nearest the vendors. 
---
You know you can get all perks at max level right? 
---
I mainly farm whitesprings and very rare will I come across someone selling it
---
&gt; issues people were claiming. It was a great time with no issues honestly.
---
I'm so happy for you. So many of my friends and I have had so many problems from BETA on. We're not making it up. Constant disconnects. Constant lag, serious game breaking lag. Glitches are one thing. Bugs are one thing. But constantly being kicked from servers and having to reload the game, that's bullshit.
---
See if they‚Äôre messing with you. Find a tab with nothing in it (or just take it all out). Add one random item into that tab and have them tell you what it is. If they succeed, then yeah, there‚Äôs a problem. 
---
I love the tattered and responder fireman outfit more than anything lol. 
---
I think I have most of her tapes but haven't listened to them because I haven't found #1. I'll have to see. 
---
All great advice. Thanks people.  
---
Toss that dross
---
Yeah, I do get that delay when I log in, it takes about 30sec upto a minute for my camp to load. Even Fast travelling to Winterspring for my daily ghoul clean up would take up to 30 sec for NPC's to load, sometimes they're hitting me and I can't see them.
---
Just have them babble nonsense like all the CHildren of Atom in 4 and then maybe every couple of ones you come by you can actually talk too and get info out of.
---
Random mailboxes
---
So I wasn‚Äôt slowly going crazy 
---
Thanks OP 
---
Following someone in a game isn't stalking unless you're able to do it every time the player logs in to play which I highly doubt is even possible without adding the person as a friend. You won't get banned even if he reports you as he has no proof of any actual stalking other than following him around for a short amount of time. It sounds like he doesn't even know the definition of stalking as following someone repeatedly is stalking, following someone once is not.
---
If you get a hit on them and bring them to the sentry bot on the side heel mow everything down for you and you still get xp
---
It bleeds!? Oh hell no. I‚Äôm going back in.
---
Stop breathing, ‚Äòcuz pollution. &gt;.&gt;
---
Yeah, what I do is go to Blackwater Mine. Kill all the Mole Miners, and grab every single thing that ain't nailed down all the way through the mine and back. Scrap everything... come out of the mine and there's a weapons and armor and ammo and PA workstation. Fix everything and bulk some and sell them to Whitesprings Station adn leave what I don't need for the next person (I leave extra mats in the burlap sack next to the ammo bench by the door at the WS train station)
---
I just want $30 back of the $60 I spent...  That or give me 30k caps in game as compensation for lying to me.
---
You're right. You have no idea how helpful your post was. Or maybe nobody cares.
---
I offer nothing because im level 30 and I barely explored the right side of the map. 
---
Yeah I just figured 1000 caps a day is a good number to shoot for, and my selling route only contains around 4-5 vendors at the moment since I usually can't max them out. I'm just trying to decipher where a bottleneck could occur with this strategy, and tick blood seems like the only possibility at the moment. Unfortunately, I'm really weird and looking for an economist solution to caps rather than looting locations on a regular basis. I don't mind laying some groundwork, getting plans or hoarding a particular resource, but it would be neat to have a reliable source of caps that was independent of the uncertainties of spawned items and doing "runs" every day. Just my opinion though, and I have seen a ton of good looting routes and not so many industries. 
---
Headshots should be headshots, for the enemies or the player.
---
I loose doing that at train stations. I‚Äôll just be chilling and unloading shit and someone will walk up and I‚Äôll watch some things disappear. I love it.
---
The got over 500 in the game.. I can complain and bitch and make fun of the game all I want...And will continue to do so even though I do not play it anymore!
---
Only reason I can see is to prevent duping. Evidently there was a method possible with Modus because he had multiple vendor stations at each branch. 
---
The big thing is, only part of their inventory is instanced. The other part is made up of things other players sell to them. I‚Äôm guessing they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to have them live update with more than one player. Hell, they can‚Äôt even do it with just one. I have to back out then re-enter to see the stuff I sold. 
---
Ah, so we've found our Lovecraft love-letter for this installment? 
---
Xbox
---
Already Quit playing..just like to stop him and spread the freedom of walk away from the oppression of Bugthesda... I also had over 500 hours in the game!
---
When you claim a workshop, it tells you that players have the ability to engage in pvp with you. 
---
Didn't ask. 
---
It's been happening a lot since the last patch. 
---
I love when people post their builds on here. Let‚Äôs me look through and get a better idea of how to use my cards.
---
I either put in 
---
A) Overseers Camp cache
---
B) Vault 76 entrance
---
C) Any container nearest a vendor
---
Oh so I a douchebag and I just to block you cool story..
---
I only pick up essentian junk. Yet I never run out of materiars for repairing my weapons or armor. 
---
I don't have junk weight reduction perks but might have an armor piece or two for them. I do have the ammo and food and drug weight perks though.
---
I have just adequte amount of junk in stash, as well as currently high amount of screws and springs. Constantly I drop several resources off as picking up essential junk like lead, ends up also stacking other things that come along with the lead containing junk.
---
Several patches have just increased my carry weight because they've made the weight perks to apply to things like radaway ect which previously was broken.
---
Overall YMMV but I'm finding the limits quite manageable.
---
You can find it on the boxes inside the enclave hideout, same room as the terminal you can learn the x01 PA
---
The thing that's holding me back the most is finding a decent ranged weapon for fighting SBs. I finally said F it and slapped together a regular old combat rifle, cranked out about 500 .45 rounds and went to join a queen fight to maybe get a legendary. I knew my gun wouldn't do anything, but I do decent melee with an armor piercing fireaxe. I've done this about 5 times now and have yet to receive a single weapon or armor upgrade. I honestly feel like I'm just getting in the way in these fights. I finally got a medic's handmade from Whitespring. It's not much better, but it's better than nothing I guess.
---
I don't see people complaining about that free health regen when playing nighttime in game tho?
---
Get over it, it technically doesn't break their promise and since reddit has destroyed the game before Bethesda could, they're running out of options to get funding to make content for the game sooner.
---
You did this reddit. This is on you because of posts like this that complain over every damn little thing. 
---
Don‚Äôt rush it, take your time. The part you‚Äôre in is one of the best points in the game. You‚Äôre trying new things, working out your build, exploring. Later on it becomes more tedious so keep that in mind when moving up.
---
Just drop it
---
You‚Äôll need a flash drive. Go to gallery, select copy to USB.  It‚Äôll be under a series of folders that will readily recognizable as from your PS4. 
---
Word of warning, Bethesda‚Äôs email system can‚Äôt handle large attachments for some reason. I sent in a 20mb video and it was kicked back as being too large.  Even a free email like Yahoo allows up to 25. 
---
They respond when new people enter the area and if you don‚Äôt kill the boss
---
Ah, but once the datamined ~~lootboxes~~ lunchboxes drop, you can get damage boosts and condition boosts for just a few ~~hundred~~ ATOMs! Problem solved, right?
---
Man, I just gave up on 76. I was logging on to do the same shit. Look at my camp, launch a nuke, help randoms and log out. I just started 4 and oh my god am I having a blast.
---
I‚Äôve made a couple serums at whitesprings and hidden them in registers and containers in the shopping area. It‚Äôs fun.
---
That's not even to win. Go play mobile games on your phone if you want pay to win. This is nothing compared to the 19.99 29.99 49.99 99.99 "micro" transactions they flaunt around in there all the time
---
Only lead and aluminium weight less as bulk, in stash where perks don't matter. And large amounts of lead should not be stored as it's much smaller as ammo. With junk weight reduction perks it can be different, but requires you to carry it.
---
Going with chemist and tick blood you could also supplement with healing salves. From the overseer's camp in the river until it ends by vault tec farm you can get 25+ blood leaf, green thumb gets you to 50, chemist you craft 100, they sell for 4 caps each. Oh you have to roam the woods a bit for soot flowers, but between flat woods and the relay tower there are way more than 25 soot flower 
---
Marine wetsuit and tactical helmet plans spawn in the drop sites c3 and get, as well as the single train car west of watoga station, and a bunch of other places in cranberry bog. Witch costume is at random event spawn on the highway 65 maker in the mire. Dead trick or treaters in the street.
---
Yes, and that I have real no issue with. I feel you should be able to own a workshop for at least an hour without any ability to lose it. Just at least one but that can be up for debate. But when you don't want to engage in pvp and are just trying to gather resources to keep the grind going and people keep killing you with out any problem, the system is a bit broken. Especially when they are lvl 111 and i'm only lvl 33
---
Ya come fight the SBQ and have her despawn before giving any loot and poof you‚Äôll be back in West Virginia.
---
Not a lie because you can find this in game. Maybe if reddit didn't destroy the game this wouldn't be happening
---
I got the Flatwoods Monster to spawn while doing the Daily Queen of the Beast quest.
---
I have a lvl5 player 30c for his before I knew the plan. Just put on my mic and asked around Flatwoods. 
---
Whitesprings clubhouse icebox. (Left to the door). We usually pack it with legendaries and ammo.
---
The limits make sense with the online and other aspects of the game.
---
Go look at games on mobile phones charging 30 50 100 dollars for everything. This is nothing and it's a tiny buff
---
Also these things can be found in game
---
I understand what you mean, but this doesn't feel like it was implemented in order to add to the strategy.
---
For instance, I remember playing the first *Resident Evil* and initially thinking "i should just be able to carry everything all the time." After playing it though, i began to appreciate that I had to be strategic about what I brought with me and how it added to the puzzle aspect. Same with *Monster Hunter*. The inventory limits never really bothered me as I feel that the limits were intentional and not just arbitrary.
---
The other thing that made those games more bearable was that the stash limit was either unlimited it so big that it wasn't an issue. Same with Fallout 3&amp;4.
---
I refuse to believe that the meager stash limit in this game was strategic and it's ridiculous that they ever thought it would go over well with its players. I believe it was implemented as a cheap way to reduce server load, but never should have been seriously considered. I don't think they will ever really know how many players have quit the game already just because of this one aspect.

4. Another database error undoubtedly, I'm unable to buy or sell to in-game vendors for while being underweight by over 50+ points.  The game error tells me expressly that overweight and therefore unable to trade.  I tried all of the different faction vendors with the same result.  
---
CS told me to reinstall my video driver and DirectX, try running the game in the Admistrator role, and to run the Scan/Repair Utility.  The game ran fine before Patch 5, and I could buy/sell without issue.  A) My PC is fine, it is not a video driver issue or a DirectX issue. B) It is not a permission or file/folder ownership issue.  C) Running the Scan/Repair utility was the first thing I did and it did not reload any files, i.e.- checksums matched what was on the server.

5.  \[Incident: 190204-003054\] My character is unable to sell or purchase items from any robot vendor. 
---
Yeah but they can't just find those armors easily and not everyone wants to buy something off someone on reddit. Those armors are hard as hell to find. I'm level 230 or something and have found exactly two pieces that reduce weapon weight in all that time
---
Yup, reddit destroyed the game and it's continuing to do it
---
When the loot part start ? Or does that include my 10th ultracite vent plan?
---
What do you mean a real person? If you‚Äôve got cards then he pops up to heal you and aid you in a fight. What else do you want him to do? Be a companion? 
---
Extractors are easy, you can build them so long as your CAMP is on a deposit, they're under "resources" in the CAMP menu. You'll need the acid you smelt the ore into scrap, which you can bulk (requires plastic) at a tinkers bench. You can sell the bulk to robot vendors. If you farm enough you can make around 1400 caps per day, but that's if you hit all vendors, and you need to have the acid and plastic to bulk the raw ore. On a side note there's also three Aluminum veins near this site (directly south of the copper deposit) which you can hit as well. 
---
What specific location is that?
---
I just killed the Flatwoods Monster today so if it's scripted as they claim it is, I should be able to see the hatch now.
---
I would very much like to use a regular chainsaw. JUST to say I‚Äôve used one. 
---
That, essentially does the exact same thing, minus making the player character weaker, it doesn't actually change damage numbers either, just ups everyones damage.
---
I guess it's their way of saying: "you should go out more".
---
The highest level version is actually rather hard. You probably fought a low level version.
---
Alien blaster is from a crashed alien event in game
---
Loot indeed isn't great even from highest level version
---
Yeah, but they said the factory isnt marked, so neither Arktos nor Mama Dolce's would qualify since those are marked locations.
---
What console?
---
Watoga train station suitcase and sometimes lunchbox is loaded with Ultracite plans, weps, and armor after SBQ goes down.
---
Can verify, two ghouls in fort defiance did this last night.
---
pc ?!
---
When you started getting weapons, if you‚Äôre not the type to grind for rare weapons knowing that you‚Äôll get the same crap gear before you do, then you shouldn‚Äôt play looter games. 
---
I don't get it. You can't walk away from the game. Your character is always in it. Also, that's not new. Walking has always been in the game from day one.
---
yarp
---
Train station suitcases or containers there. Sometimes I‚Äôll put stuff in the whitesprings clubhouse, I‚Äôve put some stuff by Phoenix in Watoga before...
---
No one cares.
---
I have every two shot in the game, have modded all my power armour and the amount of wood armour and drills I‚Äôve seen lol. So no the loot and rng in this game sucks
---
Interesting. I do see soot flower everywhere. And green thumb seems good with that. Definitely could net around 200 caps,  but I feel like I'd run into the same bottleneck problem. one method; 1000 caps a day. Is it doable?
---
What‚Äôs on the left side worth checking out? I‚Äôve only really been on the right side of the map haha
---
Great Since of Humor!
---
I got a cool CAMP on PC NewtGingrinch
---
Ya happening to me a lot too prob 75% unsearchable
---
xbox :(
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what you have it‚Äôs still a looter game, read your own questions ffs 
---
Drugs weight 0.03 with perks. I have maybe 400 of different drugs in total. It's not that much, it's handy, it's fairly lightweight for it's value. Im slowly getting rid of heavier clocthes pieces by selling them into vendors. Once I get rid of them, I can start dumping drugs to vendors.
---
Order of Mysteries
---
Everything in the workshop could be shared,, everyone could build too, but the owner of the workshop could be the only one beneffited with the free fast travel,  and maybe it would be interesting that if a structure is destroyed any player could repair it with their own resources. That way it would be More interesting, at least for me sounds cool and More people would invest in workshops... And each player at any given time may be able to claim one workshop or two max to promote serverwide coop, i dont know , the workshop part of the game could be a very good one depending how it's handled.
---
I'd give anything to be able to visit this bot. It's the only place left for the park bench and metal picnic table to be. 
---
The game gives you the choice between melee and ranged.  If I chose the melee, I can whack enemies all day long dealing really good damage without using any ammo and few resources to repair.  If I chose a gun then I gotta go through way more effort to maintain it.  I have to stockpile ammo, stockpile resources to make ammo,  and stockpile resources to repair, resources that are much rarer than the resources used for melee.  Guns require way more effort to use yet melee is dominating the meta right now.  Melee weapons are not only just as good if not better than ranged, they are also way easier to use.  Using guns is way more tedious and grindy.  The idea of this being a survival game where ammo and resource conservation matters falls apart since a baseball bat is more effective than a rifle and way easier to use.
---
Yes I named my bathesda the same as my social media expecting the game to show my character name 
---
Obtain a decent cosmetic plan. I have one that's 3 cloth 1 gold sells for 15 caps, and there are definitely better plans
---
I like this idea alot! It seems to be the first one so far that might be renewable enough to work. Did you advertise copper specifically because it has an advantage over other extractions? Got any tips so that I don't muck it up haha? 
---
If you need a Nocturnal Rolling Pin that much - I can give you one.
---
I support this idea... It was so disappointing being a Stern Show listener and creating a character named ‚ÄúRonnie Zasstreeks‚Äù to later find out that no one will ever get to enjoy it but me.
---
Agi Int build with the frost scythes from the snow DLC is a really fun build to try.
---
You mean like clothes plans? Sorry cosmetics is a new term for me for this game, just wanna make sure I'm not missing anything haha
---
Overseer camp for plans, watoga station for the rest, i also dump in the little lunchbox at whitespring, you know the one on the platform next to the truck and the wall next to pool
---
Overseers Camp.
---
Bethesda reply to every ticket so that‚Äôs weird.
---
Do you know of any colorful forests in the game? Do you know of any colorful forests with a big tree in the middle?
---
Damn. I might get it for Xbox and the end of the month so if I do I‚Äôll have to friend you and I can help you find shit while I play. 
---
Yes. And when you see my guy running around as grognak my dweller is so obsessed with the comics he changed his name to grognak lol
---
I don‚Äôt consider a drill loot you fool. That‚Äôs the point. Take ya noise out of BGS ass and try and justify the crap loot? It‚Äôs not worth the effort of doing the missions.
---
I launched a nuke and one of the rewards was 3 5.56 bullets. Is that what you consider a reward?
---
I almost always getting  legendary mutants that always run away from me.
---
Seriously the fastest way to caps is farm chems from ghouls at White springs, in one round you will get a heap of radaway, stimpaks, radx and heaps of buff drugs. Each run takes about 5 Mon swinging a hammer, 10 minutes with a sneak crit build. Server hop and repeat. As a bonus you will end up with a ton of stared legendary crap that sells for 5-100 caps a piece to the vendors.
---
Lots of little houses, spawn areas, farms, scenic spaces, junk, tourist places, my camp lol. 
---
i always thought you could shoot through foundations
---
Yes. The clothes that go over your armor and weigh .10 they're all worth much more than their materials. Under armor and armor don't work as well
---
I would have expected the forests with water in the middle near Watoga but the posts have specified that it's near the exact center of the map would would be in a radius around Top of the World.
---
Been searching all around there and haven't quite found a location that matches all the attributes exactly.
---
Has anyone figured this out? I've got a deathclaw, I named her Steve. I love her. But she attacks everyone near my camp and it's annoying AF. I've even had "neighbors" kill her, but she keeps coming back. 
---
Sounds good! :)
---
whhaaaaaaaaa
---
That sucks I'm sorry. Are you on Xbox? 
---
I got trapped inside lol
---
That pipboy glitch is bollocks.  I get disconnected from my server right before hacking a terminal.  Log back in, pipboy glitch.  Exit game, log back in, pipboy glitch.  Exit game, log back in, pipboy glitch.
---
Tried once more, got hit by the glitch again, jumped on reddit to bitch when it suddenly unglitched and my pipboy actually came up.
---
Not acceptable.
---
Yup. Found a fee stashes with one cap
---
Weapon balancing is a complete joke, and I am surprised that it hasn't been better addressed after a few months. You can't make ammo quite rare, and weapons have condition, only to have them do little against some enemies. Not to even get started on the reward not even coming close to matching the effort spent. This is why I enjoyed SP Fallouts, I could balance the game to how I wanted it.   
---
No I don't think so
---
If there was a TRUE survival game, everyone would hate it. Healing takes months, infections are a thing, two bullets and you‚Äôre dead. you get knocked out, you‚Äôre dead. most bullets wouldn‚Äôt penetrate power armor.  You would need food a couple times a day, water almost every other hour. Radiation couldn‚Äôt be healed, and cancer would come easily. Mutations wouldn‚Äôt exist, at least on the scale we have right now. Basically it‚Äôs one shot everything. 
---
If it takes you a full mag to kill an average mob - it's a "you" problem. With just 3 rifleman points and 3 tank killer I kill most things in 3-5 shots with same AAE handmade, so quit your bullshit.
---
You lucky dawg. We fought the queen (no loot loading, friends had to reload the game because lag was so bad they couldn't even scrap a weapon or drop anything). Then we tried building at our bases and more lag, gave up, played another game
---
The worst part is the free hits they always get in.
---
Mole rats are the worst for that You ever notice if you are walking place to place they spawn every 5-10 minutes and always get free hits in on your legs? Same with camps they spawn in the camp and just rapidly attack anything they can ignoring you.  
---
 Bethesda knows what they are doing here its all to pad gametime into an endless loop of farm and repair.
---
I feel like the game has already been made and came out months ago
---
It's so refreshing to see A NON TOXIC comment on this reddig
---
i think they bug and have 0 cooldown for reloading 
---
When there's NOT a nuke zone at Whitesprings, I go inside to Artisans' Corner (the place with the workbenches) and leave stuff in the cash register. It has infiinte storage space. I leave mats, legendaries, and ammo in there. Oh and outfits I find along the way. If I'm selling to the train station vendors I leave stuff i dont want in the suitcases or the lunch boxes
---
well you're not suppose to be able to get in there.. did you fast travel in ?
---
Wait a minute... In ESO if you kill a boss you get their helmet with a power they have? (Updates ESO...)
---
I once had a similar thing happen on the Enclave event at Seneca. Scorched were spawning literally endlessly. Free XP though, so I won't complain.
---
Lol ya, relogged
---
I really don‚Äôt think he cares
---
Scortchbeast Queen Event farming. Then you let the event drag on to 10 minutes and kill the add's. 
---
Yeah I'm thinking that might he a good way too. Pastors vestments and golfing stuff seem to sell for alot, like in the 20s. But do they have plans for those? Like I said, I have the marine torso piece that sells for alot, but the materials to craft it take a heavy toll on my deposits and there are three separate materials to make it. I wonder if there's something we could craft that uses two materials max, cheap materials that are easy to invest in, with a high return rate? I wonder if there's a list for all of the FO76 clothes and their recipes/how much each vendor will pay?
---
Seems fair. 
---
Why are you trying to have a quasi-philosophical debate about social treaties in a post about a damn hat?
---
I need that brown hat .. I can give you the blue hat and blue uniform ?
---
Not sure what the tormentor perk is, unless that‚Äôs the limb damage perk, but armor pen automatic Tesla does garageo damage to them, lol
---
Only 97? 
---
Im fairly certain they removed insurance for players destroying your vehicles on PC GTAV due to some hackery Bullshit that took advantage of that.
---
Another problem is people building on his spawn spot. I usually lob an orbital strike or two in that camps general direction.
---
I need to figure out a good way to build stairs without building actual stairs .. any tips ?
---
Except that second half about melee weapons being ‚Äújust as good‚Äù. 
---
That‚Äôs just CoD‚Äôers who picked melee exactly for the reason you elegantly described (they want a shooter not an RPG) tell themselves to post-rationalize their choice of sledge. 
---
Let me propose this: it‚Äôs a cute story, but it‚Äôs false. Melee isn‚Äôt better. It dose the kill at range, it takes heaps of time to move to your second and third targets and it eats time each time you miss. 
---
‚ÄúI have time‚Äù you can argue. 
---
When I farm whitespring, I gun ghouls down. So do people with melee. It takes 15 seconds from when they appear. By then, the melee lob are
---
Cleaning up 5-10 corpses and I‚Äôm cleaning up 30. 
---
SBQ? I can kill her while she‚Äôs in the air. 
---
PVP? I have first strike advantage to anyone wanted. I don‚Äôt need to come close. 
---
As in real life, so in this game; being able to hurt from a safe distance is an advantage. 
---
&gt; A game that protects the player from making bad decisions is called a not survival game.
---
But the bad decision that is being made is deciding to use a weapon that the devs were too incompetent to balance correctly.  It's not like I'm making the deliberate decision to use an inferior weapon, it's the devs fault for being too incompetent to balance it correctly.  Don't put the blame on me.
---
I know there are alot of good ways to farm objects from the world, but I'm really trying to stick to my theme of economy - driven money. Basically, in a vacuum of minimal setups, COULD you produce 1000 caps of a renewable resource every single day. Does such a method exist without doing tons and tons of little errands for each setup?
---
I take it you never played Fallout before 4?
---
I definitely think so it's worth it though location is really important, well mainly in the sense of supporting yourself for weapon/armor needs.Only thing I recommend is setting up your camp near a body of water to get purified water using industrial purifiers cause that's the limiting factor in my experience. In the case of just soley making caps, I'd say your farm method is actually a lot more better in that regards considering how many bushes you have cause you'd need about 50 of each plant to match the amount you're making. My adhesive farm was near Silva Homestead where there's an abundance of corn so I only focused on tato and mutfruit production. For me, I made more profit selling to players than selling to actual vendor bots (adhesive is valuable to player, and it's cheaper to sell it bulk compared to what vendor bots normally sell it at). 
---
But those days are behind me now, it was very tedious lol. Now I just make Halloween witch costumes and sell those to the vendors at 45 caps a piece ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The irony of you listing Anthem.
---
Confederate uniform costs 3 cloth and 1 gold, sells for 13 with 3 Cha and 3 hard bargain, gold scrap vendors for 2 and cloth is worth less than a cap each. If you buy a bulk cloth from the vendor and have 10 gold you can make 130 caps, bulk cloth is 74, gain 56 caps rather than 20 from vendoring gold. I'm sure there are better plans than this one too 
---
Level 60+ i started chasing after them, though the loot and xp isnt all that great they do also spawn a bunch of scorched that always yield gear that could be scrapped for mats. And plus the satisfaction of whooping a scorched beast that used to torment me when i was level 12 over encumbered from farming and just minding my own business. 
---
Tips for owning a workshop: Only use the resources that already exist in the workshops budget (green text). Each workshops normally has enough to build a couple of extractors, generators and turrets. You don‚Äôt need to build anything more than that. You don‚Äôt need to barricade your workshop or make elaborate walls or place crafting tables. All of these just waste your time and resources if someone comes along to claim it or you disconnect. It‚Äôs free to fast travel back and forth to your camp so just do all your crafting and collecting there, rather then waste resources or building extra crafting tables.
---
Your response was best; it gave an appropriate response and understanding of the person you replied to, while also explaining in the best way possible the answer to their question.
---
Thankyou in advance for any help really cant find the green hood price ! thankyou
---
Ordinance Express does not affect cannonballs.
---
The Broadsider is an explosive launcher.
---
Why are cannonballs ballistic?
---
Wooow so cool! 
---
Uhh have you tried the other stairs or metal stairs? 
---
Your idea is good, I my stash is also always full.
---
I don't play a lot, but I need  a lot of time to manage the stash (inventory) and I take a lot of time at the vendors.
---
In my opinion the stash weight is not enough for all the things we store and the vendors really have not enough caps or beginners haven't enough different vendors.
---
I really like the game but I loose a lot of time for stash managing. :(
---
It's heaps. The problem if anything is that you can only sell so much per day and people would rather hold onto literal junk instead of drop it.
---
The current mechanics/stash limits are perfectly fine, lots of people just keep playing this like the old Fallout games when it's not though.
---
One day somebody's gonna lose an arm or leg
---
THAT IS the kind of thing I'd love to hear about lol. What's the recipe for the witch costume? I'd only need 25 or so of those a day to get 1000c a day. 
---
Just need a vendor bot. And face the chairs toward the base?
---
Thanks. Yeah, I already roll with that, but honestly, they need to just do away with durability in general. I don't think it adds anything positive to the game.
---
Get good
---
wow dude youre so advanced
---
Pacifist mode needs to be changed to make you unable to hurt or be hurt, and this needs to include things you own with the exception of workshops. 
---
Nothing pre-war should require Flux, it doesn't make sense.
---
The bot has a note on his body. He is supposed to time out and die. I don't know how long the process takes but you will always end up at this solution. 
---
Dont rush this game. The first 50 levels are the most fun. Once you‚Äôve done all the quests is just events, general exploration and grinding left. 
---
Pretty much how I was looking at, and lots of gears, it till i had to log off.
---
I did kill him though. Oh well.

We‚Äôll see what ‚Äúaddress the issue‚Äù means. Straight up saying, ‚ÄòSorry, we broke red/bright PA lights but they will be put back the way they were (plus cool new atom shop versions!)‚Äù seems easy. Too bad they didn‚Äôt just do that. 
---
cool ill jump on for a few mins, IGN fakeshemp
---
I completely agree, people complain a ton about it.
---
But think of it this way, TSE‚Äôs were supposed to be extremely rare extremely powerful weapons that you hardly ever came across. The duplicators spread them so much that they became the most common weapon.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt have been nerfed if it wasn‚Äôt for duplicators. 
---
This looks very helpful, thanks!
---
That's actually not too bad. If I found a gold deposit, maybe I could setup shop and make enough gold to avoid a bottleneck in production. Your comments aren't coming up for me btw, but I really like that idea and I'm gonna do some research on clothes in the next few days and give it a whirl! Thanks :)
---
Expect glitches. Expect players to exploit glitches in order to make you suffer.
---
◊©◊ú◊ï◊ù!
---
No, the body of water is unmarked. They never said the factory was unmarked.
---
They can craft it or buy it again, but if it was in a bag then they‚Äôve dropped it, so you can only assume it was on purpose.
---
This is good advice. But MAKE SURE you do NOT hit a robot at Whitesprings with a bullet, a grenade, or a swing of your melee weapon. Don't hurt the robots with splash damage either (don't blow up cars near robots. Don't throw a molotov near robots where a robot might walk through the flames). If you aggro the robots at lower levels you are going to have a very hard time.
---
If you don't have a friend to help you, look at Whitesprings on the map now and then. Look at the clubhouse. If you see higher level people there, at the clubhouse, travel over. Tag any ghouls you see, let the others finish them off for you, then go loot the bodies when it's safe. 
---
If the bus out front is blown up already you can jump up by hopping on the front right fender then onto the hood then onto the top of the bus. From there you can safely tag a lot of the ghouls that come outside as well as any radstag that happen by or the wendigo too if she comes outside
---
"next to a factory not on the map"
---
Noted.
---
All civil war era clothes plans are from a random encounter. I found one of the plans by running along the road from the wv lumber (top left corner of the map) to the Tyler county fair.
---
it is a quest reward, maybe he didnt know that it is a Full PA and only saw a Frame \^\^ (happend to me too) dont mind it ;)
---
added ya !
---
Maybe. 
---
And maybe you‚Äôre not seeing the bigger picture. 
---
Let‚Äôs not confuse fact with opinion. That there is opinion. 
---
Here‚Äôs an example. 
---
The gamma gun. ‚ÄúLazy horrible devs didn‚Äôt balance it‚Äù, right? 
---
Wrong. When I‚Äôm in PA, radiation does nothing to me, but someone rocking the same build as me with a 1* handmade will pulverIze me the second PvP starts if they get the first burst in.

So what do I do? I‚Äôm out of PA, rocking armor pieces combining sentinel, cavalier and anti-player-damage. What does that make me (with dodgy and blocker and lone wanderer and serendipity and fireproof and dense?) Farn near bulletproof and explosionproof. 
---
Except. 
---
Except if you rock up with a rapid, gamma. 
---
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for. 
---
That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs balanced. 
---
You need to piece together the whole picture to understand why that weird thing with no use exists. 
---
And we‚Äôll be using them come March, when survival drops. 
---
Yes, some weapons need tweaking. Lasers etc, 
---
But I think you‚Äôre overdramatizing because you want to tell an ‚Äúincompetent developer‚Äù story, and you‚Äôre failing to indemnify where the boundary of your own understanding of the game runs. 
---
There is no fast way anymore. After multiple stealth nerfs it‚Äôll now take some considerable grinding to even hit level 100. I smashed the game for nearly 300 hours before the turn of the year but I doubt I‚Äôll be back. It‚Äôs basically dead at this point!
---
well that was weird 
---
That was my thought but hey who knows! Thanks
---
You are not kidding though. They nerfed the shit out of it when there really was no need to. 
---
They need to consider this.
---
**Q U A L I T Y**
---
over
---
*Q U A N T I T Y*
---
Like cosmetic? So as to mark a target?
---
How boaring! 
---
I can‚Äôt imagine someone dropping valuable stuff so you‚Äôre probably right
---
Low level (1-20) - Camden Park, Morgantown, Charleston, Forest events.
---
Mid Level (20-40) - Big Bend, West Tek, Savage Divide events
---
High Level (40-50+) Same as mid, Whitesprings, Watoga, Cranberry Bog events, Mire events.
---
Imo these are pretty good, usually what I do.
---
No it does the opposite. By buffing damage all you did was make damage perks and stats even more powerful than defensive ones than they already were. By lowering Hotpoint instead you drastically shrink that gap instead and make even more builds viable.
---
Well no it actually does cause damage after the fact, but it's extremely low at higher levels. 
---
Right? After adhesive farming, I used to collect raw flux in nuke zones since then sold at 11 caps each but I had to get to each vendor fast cause there was a time limit on it before it became inert flux which is worthless to sell.
---
But yeah, regarding the Witches Outfit plan, you'll need to fast travel to Crevasse Dam in the Mire. Once there, and if you notice in the map, there is a 65 highway sign on the road that is a little bit south of the crevasse dam. Exactly where that 65 sign is, is a chance for a dead trick or treated body to spawn which may have the plans (there are videos on YouTube and posts on here that make it more simpler than how I'm explaining it lol). The outfit only requires 3 cloth and 5 plastic to make so making it a profitable venture.
---
enlighten me
---
Flux seller you say? What system are you on and what are your prices? 
---
But it's not as fun and not worth it.  It's not as fun to have to grind for ammo and resources and the advantage you do get isn't worth it.  Sure, I can be more effective with a ranged weapon than a melee weapon but the advantage isn't worth the investment.  I can either tediously grind a bunch of ammo and resources to maintain a gun or I can turn my brain off and be marginally as effective with a fucking baseball bat.  What you get just isn't worth the hassle.
---
Get the witche's costume plans. Over by Dyer Chemcial (far right side of the map) there's a route 65 sign. At the intersection just a bit north of it sometimes there's a trick or' treater laying in the road and she has the witches' costume plans. to make the costume you just need a bit of cloth and bit  of plastic. they sell for up to 45 caps with the right perks. They are very light. So you can load up with those and go selling. cloth is so easy to come by (pre war money, dirty rags) and so is plastic. I even leave some costumes laying around for others to use or sell. 
---
Also build your camp somewhere hidden, people will blow it up and you will have to pay to repair it, it‚Äôs pretty expensive to repair your camp at a low level. 
---
Does that happen often?
---
I'm sure you must have been to the Mothman Museum right? did you go in the basement? Did you collect some mothman eggs? 
---
No one said that. [This is the original post.](https://i.imgur.com/Sy1cSq4_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium)
---
Agreed. I‚Äôve defended Bethesda a ton but I‚Äôm starting to get tired of it myself, it is disgusting how much of a pile of shit this company has become. 
---
I‚Äôm definitely not pre-ordering another game from them after this. 
---
Yes. Very often.
---
I would ask... how much stash limit is enough?
---
People here seem to want "infinity plus one" but that isnt a survival game at all.
---
In answer to your question, no, the stash hasn't been too small for me since they upped it.
---
I've learned to let it go.  I collect and scrap a lot, and feed it to my buddy who likes crafting.  Surpluses go to vendors, which dont take that long to cap out.  If I still need space, I drop supplies off at stations or players houses.
---
I dont try to be a one man army, I'm focused on heavy weapons and machine pistols.  If something big is going down, I have a handful of friends I can ask for help.  I've never had to fight a scorchbeast queen alone.
---
I actually carry 6 weapons, but because they cluster around heavy weapons, a handful of perks make those guns featherweight.  Because I'm not munchkining my character to be the top of the leaderboards I have perk slots for this task.
---
Extra ammo not being scrappable is my only complaint, but this forced me to try out many weapons to find what I liked... all other ammo goes to friends or charity.
---
All that food?  Dont need 'em.  Food isnt rare.
---
Most crafting materials are easy to scrounge, so I only bulk keep the rare stuff like ultracite and lead and acid.
---
I have about 150lb of available stash that flexes depending on my hauls and vendor availability.  I'm rarely overencumbered, and my 10lb mining power armor handles shopping trips.
---
So, I go back to the opening question... how much stash would be "enough?"  Because I'm going to bet everyone complaining, will have trash filling their container like a liquid.  Give 10,000 lb, and we'll have complaints that it's not 11,000, because by God we need all those tin cans!
---
If Bethesda bumped it to 1000... how soon before you are stashed out again?
---
I dont like telling people they're playing the game wrong. Everyone should find a way to enjoy it.  But if you can't find enough space to stash your old world currency... you aren't playing according to the world building intent.  Junk respawns quickly, there are many locations rich in individual junks, you just have to find them.. Once you see West Virginia as one big regenerating stash, with your personal pocket universe existing to store a bit of surplus for emergencies, you'll discover a completely new, and relaxing, gamestyle.
---
It's like poetry.  Creativity tuned by limitations.
---
Oh, you will. You will.
---
So basically, broken down, I need around 125 ish plastic a day, and 60 ish cloth. Cloth I can probably just buy wholesale from one of the bots on my route; the plastic I may struggle to get at such quantities, but also it's plastic so I should be able to find a renewable source without making "runs." I know alot of the vendors have plastic stuff lying around, and it's abundant anyways. So far this is my winning formula haha. I'll look it up! 
---
It was probably a furious build. 
---
I have to disagree for two reasons. 1. The TSE Nerf and subsequent perk Nerf was far to massive, TSE use to level the playing field for pvp, especially since now it's dominated by people wearing full sentinel gear and using the bobble head glitch to one hit for nearly 10k. While I agree TSE needed adjustments they did not however adjust the other guns to an equal damage scale and furthermore they were considered super rare endgame items and should be the best of the best. As for number 2. The Two shot perk was never really the problem the explosive add on was, they should have left two shot alone and instead focused on perhaps a 50% explosive Nerf instead of an 80%nerf making endgame weapons completely unviable in combat. Case and point, prior to the Nerf my build plus the single TSE I got via grinding was doing roughly 400-500 per shot so in about 3-5 shots I could take down a Super Mutant level 65, post Nerf it now hits for 110 damage and takes almost ,20-30 shots.
---
My views may be controversial so hear me out. I actually see the current DR system as workable. This assumes the rest of the game is designed to work with it rather than against it.
---
The fundamental problem with the DR system is not the system itself, its how combat encounters have been designed using it.
---
Most encounters in the game are a number of mobs with relatively average DR, scaled up by level. On the whole, DR and ER are not at vastly different levels and everything is same-same multiplied by level with a compounding multiplier. This encounter design approach fails because of all the features of the DR system mentioned, Penetration does not work on ER, DR Scaling at high levels has significant impacts on low damage / high frequency attacks, etc.
---
The way encounters SHOULD have been designed to support this DR system is variety in both scaling and mob types.
---
Varied mob types, with visible clues on their type, high range differences in DR/ER across mobs and on single mobs.
---
To explain what I mean by this I'll give some scenarios.
---
Encounter A &amp; B - current state
---
***Encounter A***
---
5x Supermutants Level 25-27
---
SM 1, 2 &amp; 3 are 75DR/65ER and SM 4 &amp; 5 are 75DR/80ER
---
***Encounter B***
---
6x Supermutants Level 58-68
---
SM 1&amp;2 are 353DR/335ER, SM 3,4 &amp; 5 are 324DR/340ER and SM6 is 303DR/286ER 
---
All the numbers are ballpark and there is no variety. Hard hitting weapons preferably with Penetration are going to excel always, fast but low damage will spray but be ineffectual.
---
Encounter C, D, E - effectively designed for this DR system
---
***Encounter C***
---
5xSupermutants level 58-68
---
SM 1&amp;2 melee brawlers 200DR/55ER, SM 3&amp;4 are range assault 80DR/70ER and SM 5 is a high HP/DMG laser sniper 70DR/220ER
---
Different targets are going to have materially differing difficulty depending on the weapon you use. You are rewarded for spotting visible differences in the enemies and using a weapon that fits. Ballistic Auto will take care of the range assault real quick just spraying in their direction, be ok with the sniper and have a hard time with melee, NRG Auto will really struggle with the sniper, but do good for the rest, high damage non-autos will have to pick their targets carefully, if they don't take out the melee first they will have them in face, but without pen they will struggle if ballistic, inversely if NRG they will struggle with the sniper because there is no pen for NRG. Either way their high damage is countered by consequence of low ROF with soft targets (the assaults) taking not much less time than some of the 'hard' targets.  
---
This rewards effective weapon swap mid combat if solo or smart targeting if in groups.
---
***Encounter D***
---
5xSupermutants level 28-34
---
SM 1&amp;2 melee brawlers 100DR/30ER, SM 3&amp;4 are range assault 40DR/35ER and SM 5 is a high HP/DMG laser sniper 35DR/110ER
---
Effectively linear scale rather than compounding with levels same variety, rewarding variety, just at a different level.
---
***Encounter E***
---
Mirelurk Horde (5xnorm, 2xkingm 1xqueen)
---
All mobs have high resits across most of their body, except some segments have really low resist.
---
5xnorm 240DR/250ER (shell) 30DR/15ER (several soft spots, legs, face, belly) All very low HP - This is your swarm, targeted or auto spray (or both) will quickly dispatch, but faster firing is rewarded by quickly culling the opposition. Bolt action style can quickly kill one, but with 5 the slower ROF means you are only able to take out 2-3 before they close even if your a crack shot.
---
2x Kings 180 DR/100ER (most of body) 100DR/60ER (head) - more resistant to auto, weaker to harder hitting semi auto and bolt action, particularly NRG focused on head.
---
Queen 380DR/320ER (shell) 50DR/30ER (several soft spots, legs, face, belly) HIGH HP - bullet sponge but vulnerable to rapid well aimed shots, Penetration builds can be less focused on targeting and still achieve decent output, but gain very little damage over well targeted full autos which can sustain higher damage, as long as they can tame their recoil and aim effectively.  
---
I hope that illustrates my point effectively.
---
TLDR; DR is fine if encounters are designed with variety that encourages using a variety of weapons in groups or solo.
---
Yes!
---
When bethesda wants your opinion on how to run its business, it will be beaten out of you.
---
Your opinion about their marketing means less than shit to anyone.
---
Legendary Gatling laser, with martial artist makes it really fast,. Friend had same armor &amp; got rekt by this gun, didn‚Äôt even initiate the fight.
---
Very strong, but it was TES so idk what happened to you.
---
It was not a Gatling laser it was like a submachine gun on crack. 
---
Dayuuum, idk then.  That‚Äôs wild
---
Furious does more damage as your health is lower, would not explain the rapid firing. He was also at full health. 
---
20 to 30 shots is a straight up lie. Your build must suck serious ass. Stop lying bro
---
&gt;opens blinds from the 2nd story of my fort
---
"Get off my C.A.M.P.!!! DAMN KIDS!"
---
That‚Äôs
---
1. Subjective 
---
2. Something someone who doesn‚Äôt like RPG games would say. 
---
3. Fallout is an RPG franchise. Has always been. Holding that preference/opinion here, while is perfectly legitimate, is like rocking up to the screening of a new Star Wars movie and announcing you don‚Äôt like sci-fi. 
---
Great. But.. like... we, the not new blood that just flooded in from Fortnite and CoDland.. whose consumer dollars made the Bethesda Fallput and ES projects the empire they are today... kinda do. 
---
The explosive guns are still really good
---
I mean, I'm pretty sure a .50cal sniper would do more physical damage than a .308 hunting rifle.....
---
You mean bloodied or beserker.  But your armor is really good. However, if someone staggers you, do you get full damaged? 
---
Yeah it sucks man pvp is really the only fun thing after level 100, and you can‚Äôt even enjoy that because the glitches ruin it. 
---
[EVE Online :-O](https://youtu.be/gylzL77R9jw) 
---
Furious does more damage with each consecutive shot. Unyielding is more damage he lower your health. Also sentinel is 90% reduction from standing still know what you‚Äôre taking about before downvoting people that are trying to sell form you. 
---
There's no real advantage for copper, I only played around with the site/camp build because of the sheer amount of a single bulkable resource it can produce. If they buff energy weapons this site will go to a premium. Again however this is a particular grindy way of making caps atm. If you're done with the main quests and just want to farm caps this is an alright method, but I'd recommend having a good ammo farming run you can do as well.. You will run low after awhile doing this.
---
Yes but it did not stagger me. It has to be a new glitch because I‚Äôve seen someone to the same thing and completely destroy the queen. 
---
Ahh don‚Äôt let one player ruin your evil intentions.
---
Ig next time stream/record it, but that may be too much work. 
---
I‚Äôm at that end game too where I destroy bases for fun &amp; to engage in pvp via bounty.
---
   Note: i only destroy bases if I don‚Äôt like it, i spare the nice looking ones LOL
---
I did not downvote anyone, also sentinel does 75% reduction its basic math.
---
Five pieces of armor, each 15%.
---
What‚Äôs 5x15?
---
Not 90.
---
I want to believe this is some sort of troll video put out by someone trying to make Bethesda look like they are completely removed from their fan base.
---
20 to 30 shots is misinformation dude. My explosive shotgun is lvl 15 and is still op
---
I'd say 100% of this games's issues is Balancing, Damage Resisitance is balanced in a bad way, like most of the other game mechanics
---
If 2 folks with nothing but underwear came out of nowhere and invited me to a party i'd get naked too and join the ride
---
Stacking drugs now instead of bobbleheads maybe? Hmmm 
---
I don‚Äôt know man, no point in recording it not like anything will happen. 
---
And oh yeah you gotta leave the nice ones. 
---
Well I was assuming you built your character correctly around a sentinel armor set. With the right perks and weapons it‚Äôs 90%
---
Yup, which is why I wear it ‚Äî +1 perception with no downside except the fashion failure of wearing the same outfit all the time. As outfits go, on my female toon, it actually looks pretty good, and my Nukagirl suit was a waste of Atoms since it's positively anti-functional.
---
Could be it, not sure. Wish I recorded it so you guys could see it was ridiculous. Somebody said it could have been a Furious fun but I would still see my health dropping it wouldn‚Äôt go from 3 slivers of damage to instantly dead within a second. 
---
There are no weapons or perks that reduce damage while standing still. Nice try though. 
---
I feel like they should of either reduce the base damage of explosives rounds, or just only light the target on fire giving them a fire debuff.  Reducing explosive perk pissed off a lot of explosive builds not using TES, but missle launchers or fat-mans.
---
still dont see anything
---
The Super Duper Perk helps too. Cloth is easily obtained from Pre-War money. Plastic can be found easily at Morgantown High school gym and Watoga Highschool Cafeteria. Best of luck!
---
Fundamentally the daily cap limit, the item buyback price, and the cap refresh amount are all knobs they can turn to adjust the cap economy of the game. If caps are too freely available then there's no reason to have them, and you lose a motivation to play events and also destroy the trade economy (you need a stable currency to simplify things, or you end up trading for ballistic fiber or some other rare entity that's only useful to a subset of players).
---
Basically, every system in this game is linked and I don't envy the devs the task of balancing them in a way that makes everyone happy.
---
Good to know, thanks. 
---
Lone wonderer, serendipity, etc.
---
This... Just make it like survival mode in FO4 where weapons actually do damage on both sides.
---
I say don‚Äôt ask, saw him in my game, and literally saw him destroy 3 homes before 2 shotting me
---
I've yet to see any of these costumes in game, but then, I'm not one of the cool kids.
---
What about the boy Chokahndeh?
---
Rare case, a junkie build.  Then they‚Äôre definitely stacking drugs.  Apparently junkie builds are really strong, no proof though 
---
It's really lovely playing on a low level character trying to get it black titanium at level 20 and someone comes by and now I'm fighting level 40 mole miner respawns XD can't remember the last time I fought anything that wasn't max level outside of the forest on any of my alts -_-
---
My camp‚Äôs always open for more visitors =p my ign‚Äôs same as here, but I‚Äôll only be online in a few hours. 
---
Sounds like Destiny. 
---
What in the fuck. What did you just do to english? 
---
Oh hell yeah
---
Lone wanderer and serendipity have nothing to do with sentinel armor. You messed up on your math while trying to talk shit and you trying to play it off like you were talking about perks makes you look like an even bigger idiot. 
---
K adding you, my photo gallery needs more variety lol. This is my endgame qq
---
&gt; I don't see people complaining about that free health regen when playing nighttime in game tho ....
---
That's not remotely the same thing: It was something every player got, without effort and, especially, without a credit card transaction! Perhaps you need to google "micro-transaction games."
---
Fuck I forgot to do some shit, let me fix that
---
I've still never been able to finish swarm of suitors. Get to the island just stays as my prompt forever.
---
At least in previous games you are able to pawn off things you want to keep but don‚Äôt currently use to a follower. Or *gasp* sell things you don‚Äôt need.
---
No it takes away all your fusion cells you have in your inventory
---
After about two weeks (I only got an hour or two a few times a week) I had almost gotten to a point where I had managed all my junk and gotten to a good weight limit. 
---
It took hours of grinding for plastic, bulking, then doing the vendor route. I had a bunch of caps and my stash weight was down to ~500. 
---
Then the plans update came out... I spent weeks worth of caps in one sitting buying plans. I was excited to finally build the CAMP I wanted only to realize that I had sold off most of my bulk wood and concrete. 
---
I equipped my wood perk and the construction materials decrease perk and still didn‚Äôt have enough to build most of what I wanted. Queue the grind! The last couple days I‚Äôve been grinding for wood and concrete. I swear when you want it you can‚Äôt find it and when you don‚Äôt need it it‚Äôs everywhere. 
---
Talkin about overall reduced damage, stop with the hard on for your sentinel armor LOL
---
Okay it's a 20 min video the dude can suck his mum 
---
BOS is a mod for combat armor. Grades of armor all use the same mods 
---
There ya go
---
Holy shit balls
---
Stealth Boy sometimes bug out and youll see nothing...but you can Vats them and youll see them. 
---
I completely agree, explosive weapons are still very good guns and a ton of people still use them.
---
It is a shame everyone is going to melee now though because of how overpowered it sis. Especially bloodied melee builds. 
---
I got a level 1 one-star legendary (hunter) rolling pin off a legendary radroach in the Whitespring Golf Clubhouse one night. Talk about your limited usefulness ....
---
But if they cry loud enough Bethesda might think that they're not full of shit 
---
I didn't pay too much attention to this promotion because of the Garb of Misteries, but when I heard the your team has to be wearing a different outfit I started to worry. Does anyone know if a team of two, 1 wearing the Garb of Misteries and the other wearing a tattered dress, would get the health bonus?
---
I always played fallout four in survival mode with a mod so I could edit all the survival settings. I would always put the damage multiplier pretty high for outgoing and incoming. Definitely the best way to play fallout
---
Load up xEdit and see for yourself.
---
If i know well, its +10%/addiction.
---
Yes. EVERY FUCKING TIME. Even if bloody mess isn't equipped it still FUCKING happens.
---
This guy messaged me asking what perks we were taking about. Nice of you to help him. I‚Äôm not going to babysit an ass. 
---
I guess our endgames work well together then lol my endgame is to build more camps at other interesting places (i‚Äôll just have to get my lazy arse to take screenshots/videos of my current camps so i can move on to new projects lol)
---
Cash registers at major vendors that players visit when making daily 200-caps-per faction runs (e.g., Harper's Ferry, Watogo): Super-easy to check, and gives the finder the option to sell or use, whichever makes sense.
---
Your C) is always going to be a cash register (except in the Enclave Bunker), and those are indeed the containers I habitually use for exactly that reason.

Is it me or are they all glowing versions? I haven‚Äôt seen the normal ones since the last big patch.

Much easier to read now.

Sorry ‚Äòbout that

I opened with Dragon then pumped 64 shotgun rounds in to a lv 54 super mutant overlord and went in to finish with a super sledge. Then I realised the health was going down, up down, up down up. What the actual fuck.

Or just move the camp once and pay the price once? 
---
Targeting HUD power armor mod and Tesla rifle charging mods both did this to me.

If you didn't already, you should post there. Might get some more responses.

Urgh tell me about it! I did a stimpack farming run and got about 30. Did one daily event solo and was left with one stimpack. I end up farming/crafting stimpacks and .308 ammo for several days before attempting any quests üò´üòÇ
---
"3 caps, 4 .308 rounds and an almost broken hunting rifle."
---
But he was carrying a minigun?
---
It was intentional as a way of placing camps from occupied locations.  
---
Before this, the camps would automatically get stored and cost caps to put down again.  Not getting patched out; they changed it to the current model.
---
If everything hi as hard as those fucking Major Gutsys with the armour peircing machine guns but also everything died as easily as a level25 Ghoul That would be quite a good balance.  
---
Take 2 or 3 shots to kill almost anything except bosses that would take considerably more but not like they are at the moment, but also allow enemies to kill you in only a couple of shots.
---
It would be cool to have more caps from vendors, and like you I usually sit around 300 in my stash. Any legendaries I don't use I give away or maybe sell to other players. I generally keep aid empty in my stash, and bulk my junk and just keep up with what's in my stash and I've never really had problems. The stash limit doesn't have to be a problem if you just keep careful with it
---
Take your time, don't rush through the game. What you see is what you get, for a while anyway. Make the most of it.
---
I promise you know kothing about how bad micro transactions can get. Mobile games charge upwards of 20 50 and 100 dollars all the time
---
Survival games don't need to be ultra-realistic, they just need a fun challenge about them.
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I want a daily post on this sub talking and reminding this issue until we‚Äôll either get banned or they fix this bulletsponge bullshit. 
---
More health =/= more difficult 
---
More health = longer boring battles 
---
Ok yeah, that's a bigger problem. Honestly, i thought my crappy internet was making things worse for me in terms of not being able to loot things, but I guess things are tough all over. They need to stop slapping band aids on shit and get to the root of these problems.
---
Also, increase stash limits.
---
Ammo rare? Since when?
---
I've only encountered crickets once and it was traumatizing.
---
You're not wrong. Unless it's a level 25 weapon that was only viable because of being 300% strength, there's a problem there.
---
We need AT LEAST 1000 pounds of weight.  400 is just lazy balancing, 600 is a joke, 800 still isn't enough when player vending becomes a thing.  1000 is the low limit.  2000 is the max limit.  Stop bottleneck us and *Let us play the damn game*.
---
It really doesn't, idk what he's on about. 
---
Ha! Joke's on me I only seem to enjoy games with tiny, incompetent, or resource starved dev teams.....pls help...
---
:(
---
This effing game has people questioning their computers, their internet, their sanity for playing it still.
---
I built a new PC for this game and I'm always wondering if there's something wrong with it when I play this game. I can go play any other game in my library, no problems, no lag, nothing bad. UGH I hate questioning my own build
---
Why not?
---
No. Turrets just consume 10% of it each.
---
I highly recommend sim settlements https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872, changed the way I play the game i love that mod so much.
---
i might reinstall for a full respec
---
If you are using a two-shot weapon, that modifier makes VATS miss most of the time regardless of %.
---
I have a max level Anti armor one I will have to mod and check out.  Thanks. 
---
Is this for real? Looks fake. Completely detached from their fan base. Are they trying to appeal to a different type of audience? If so, apparently they're more interested in making fast money out of advertising than fixing the base game. Worrying news.
---
Level 110 here, all shotgun perks, all explosive perks - I can't 1 hit a level 16 super mutant with my shotgun anymore. It's so broken I'm tempted to just drop it 
---
I love challenges as well but when it‚Äôs easier to kill an alpha Deathclaw than a cricket you then realize this game has some serious balance issues. 
---
And what makes you think your opinion on reddit means shit to anyone?
---
I never said it did. What now moron?
---
I tried fallout 76, I have also done level 2 survival nuka world runs or 0% XP gain 3/NV runs... fallout 76 is bullshit difficulty, not "challenging". Don't be condescending to this guy if the game is the problem.
---
No u
---
This is such bad info..stop trying to ruin this game
---
That's still two primary effects.
---
You are full of shit
---
Yep this is what I do i just never move my camp. If a bunch of turrets or my purifiers get taken out. Just reload until somebody has that place taken. Had a guy come in and TSE shotgun my whole camp to pieces. Kept server hopping until I found one that somebody already had my camp place taken. Then reloaded and everything was fixed.
---
You can buy them from players. Of course it takes time to find perfect set but if you currenly got about nothing, it's a lot easier.
---
Im on Ps4, cant connect at all.
---
Yep.  If anyone is being annoyingly PVP and does not stop... block and change servers.  Poof.
---
Platform : PC

Issue(s)/Bug(s);
---
\* Hooded Rags works like a Hazmat Suit (Armors will be Unequipped when used)
---
\* Marine Armor mod plan named as a Combat Armor mod plan - will edit later for which part it was.
---
\* Life Saving Armor; once revived and got killed the same time, no re-spawn area available even vault 76 only solution is closing the game.
---
Do you want to add me and I'll fucking show you? 
---
You think I enjoyed logging in and finding out I've spent all my caps on a garbage gun? 
---
Ps4 playing ok
---
I killed a level 65 3star in 5 shots with a lvl 15 explosive shotgun.....you liars make me blind with rage
---
Nah man no worries ima keep them for you. I offered you a deal and thats my word. I dont mind waiting. I would have sold them to vendors anyways. 
---
The guy also tried to destroy my camp but i jumped out of the server, cost allot to fix.... i dont like players like that but seeing it is a realistic survival game it probable fits in 
---
Ok thanks for that. Spending caps to fast travel away seems a shitty way to avoid trouble. Should just be able to report assholes and they get blocked from servers.
---
The prison is a great place for low levels to get xp. Each mutant give like 76xp and alot of weapons to scrap. 
---
I agree with the above post. Nothing about this game is hard esp after lvl 25 to 30. But it's just tedious and time consuming for so little return. And now it's just 3x as tedious. I don't mind grinding, but I don't want to spend hours or a day grinding ammo that is gone in 10 mins.
---
As if anybody was using guns instead of swinging a superhammer in this game :D
---
Dude I feel your pain, I get that like 50% of the time.
---
You can't buy a legendary explosive shotgun with caps legitimately you stupid fuck
---
Let us know where your camp is
---
Same here. Sneak is completly bugges out rn. 
---
I see you use wooden armor do you have use for a weightless  wooden leg? I dont want it but i know, some people like it. 
---
Yeah,thanks guys for the reply sorry couldn't respond to them but I've bought it on PS4 and it was 51GB it's big but it's not that bad
---
I could give you a solid chunk of armor and weapons, sadly, they all are for lvl 50+, so they are of no use to you. ;P
---
I have no empathy or sympathy cause your buying duped and glitched guns
---
How much damage is displayed on the weapon page with all your perks?
---
Im soo confused didnt they wanted to up the stast to 1500 total? Whats up with that? Im i stupid? 
---
Based on that i read i envy your organization skills 
---
"Only the Rich are heavy weapon users and that's the way it should stay"
---
Except that Gatling Gun - the best heavy weapon available - is one of the cheapest guns in game to maintain and craft ammo for.
---
You tried tough.
---
it does seem bugged doesn‚Äôt it?? 
---
You and your team mates can fast travel for free to claimed work shops.
---
I agree. But it matters if you're level 50 or 100. 
---
Also, if I'm not completely wrong, you do get a flat HP bonus for each level up, or am I mistaken?
---
Sure.
---
Fallout 76 needs to be harder, it also needs a death penalty that isn't laughable.  Level 54 and have not died once, not even close.  That is silly.  I'm not an elite player, I'm cautious just like I played Fallout 4.  Fallout 4 Survival was almost spot on in terms of challenge, although it also gets too easy past level 70 or so.  If Fallout 76 was easier I'd fall asleep.
---
&gt; you do get a flat HP bonus for each level up
---
Nope.
---
Why?
---
Sad to admit but he is right, if someone is at your camp, there is chance they will grief.  Had this happen to me.
---
Guy wanders into my camp moving around, then I noticed another guy on cliff a ways out.   The camp investigator started blowing stuff up, while cliff guy waited for me to attack the wanted.
---
I blocked them both and changed servers.  Equipped contractor and repaired.  I built my base around terrain so do not really want to waste 30-40 minutes putting it all back again.
---
Watoga suitcase is where I leave surplus plans and ammo. 
---
Yup, same on Xbox right now....tried to respawn after having bounty removed and took 5+ mins and never loaded. Had to force quit and relaunch, and then it‚Äôs still really slow to load
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
Kinda hoping that people are going round and making use of what you‚Äôve dropped in the goody bags, but also kinda thinking that it‚Äôs just despawning and getting lost in the nether.
---
Try leaving it in containers or cash registers at popular train stations, they last longer before being despawned.
---
Those bobblehead dupes must be treating you real well then if you're doing that.
---
Can I double wield to go along with the one I have??
---
I'm not even bullshitting you though. I've tested it over and over to see if this thing is pulling it's 22 pounds of weight 
---
###here's a hint
---
##its fucking not. 
---
The technology isn't there yet. **‚Ñ¢**
---
They should start selling TSE shotguns since you can find those in game. Any stat buff from the atom store is unacceptable and p2w. How did Reddit destroy this game? I love this game, the only thing destroying it is Bethesda not fixing bugs and needlessly nerfing things. 
---
I did that today.  I‚Äôve learned that people watch the map and figure out where homes are if you‚Äôre in a place without a quest for too long.  
---
Yup it's unfortunate a few ruin it for so many others. I had 2 level 20s at my camp, I thought great, they using the workstations, next thing they go wanted .. now I couldn't care less, if I see them at my camp, I am going to log out ..
---
i still one shot the high level ghouls at white springs with my lvl 45 tse combat shotgun..
---
I have no explanation for the stuff my dogs destroy. 
---
That you cant one shot a lvl16 mob with a (presumably) max level something-explosive shotgun, from a (presumably) reasonable range? 
---
You're full of shit.
---
I have not tried it out, but this is what another reddit user posted before. 
---
He did verify it drops the Orbital strike (if you dont have other grenades).
---
I am assuming the bounty gets removed if you die via someones turrets though.
---
‚ÄúRP‚Äù raiders response; Guys there‚Äôs challenges in the game, he‚Äôs raiding not griefing duh, it part of the game hurr hurr...
---
Literally everyone else: wow what an asshole...
---
You seem to need it broken down for you, it's not about the build, it's about the convenience.  I have to stop after every other location I've explored to manage my stash because of specifically aim and junk.  I play as a nurse, if a player is nice to me and low level they'll get a trade offer with 20 free healing salves and anything I can spare.
---
I stockpile chems including alcohol.  Now I manage about 50 pounds of free space out of 600, but that's because I have no spare armor, no spare weapons, no spare ammo.  All of my stash space is taken up by junk and aid items.  I clear out excess junk and typically wind up with 50 pounds of free space.  I use that junk up mostly too because I keep what I have on me, all my armor, my two single shot rifles, sniper with scope, and two shotguns (one with -5 range giving me infinite range) and my perks keep them light.  I want to hold onto a fat man, missile launcher, and grenade launcher and their ammos, not possible, mini nukes alone are 6 pounds.  Missiles are 3.  As a nurse I rock syringers, except no I can't because each one is 8 pounds and I'd like to use more than 2 for various debuffs.
---
So my stash would be full so I can play one of three styles, sneak offense (default style), debuff support (syringer style), explosive suppressor (fat man and missile launcher style for groups of enemies or to intimidate players).  Instead I can only use my endangerol syringer cause the others aren't worth 8 pounds, and between the weapon and ammo explosive weapons are unusable in a consistent sense and not feasible to be stored.
---
Include player vending and how everyone is usually overencumbered and you might realize some of us need extra space to play this game like it's a Fallout game as advertised.  I shouldn't need to empty my stash to store a weapon and ammo (fat man).  I shouldn't need to get rid of aid items to store different kinds of syringers.
---
I don't want infinity and one, pretentiousness and all aside, I want a storage container to keep my fucking shit so I can play different play styles on my *one* character.  Exploring as vault dweller turned responders nurse, but can't also play as that responders nurse with her debuff syringers, and can't play as that same bad ass responders nurse holding a nuke catapult ready to bring the peace in the phrase rest in peace.
---
1000 minimum for player vending (so I can sell stimpacks, radaways, radx, medx, all chems, all alcohol, healing salve, and any legendary items that heal) and 2000 maximum for people who actually want to play this game like it was advertised, *like a Fallout game*, I don't recall needing to constantly stop, drop, and roll out my container to empty out space after EVERY, OTHER, location I've explored.  The stash should've been at 1000 easily to start out, that it was at 400 was an incredibly lazy balancing choice that took no consideration for the fact some of us want to play various ways, not streamline ourselves into one playstyle to rinse and repeat every situation in the game.
---
It'll be a glorious day when I can use my medic's fat man in a big event and not:  have it break on me, run out of ammo immediately, be overencumbered and unable to run a safe distance to fire, or shot it once and every enemy it hits takes 1/8th of their total health.  It's a bloody nuke.
---
Do you want me to get up out of bed, stick on my ps4, log in, load into a world, hit up Grafton damn and shotty a super mutant in the face? Fuck I'll even invite you to a party and you can WATCH ME DO IT. 
---
I'm not trying to rag on BGS and I've got over 260 played hours. I'll prove to you they don't work. 
---
Whiners as in people who actually try to play the game and don‚Äôt get their jollies ruining someone‚Äôs hard work?
---
Intelligence doesn't grant extra xp on 76
---
You must have a really bad luck. I have three characters, one level 172, one 52 and one 40, and I have probably met 5 or less agressive players.
---
Agreed! My character is called Badger and no one knows! üò¢
---
Nah forget it bethesda... 600 is fine, this one guy thinks it‚Äôs more than enough, go back to working on obscure atom shop items
---
Yah, put it on Youtube or something - I'm on PC. Then I'll show you how 0 shotgun perks build one-shots whitespring ghouls with a TSE pump.
---
Yes it does, it just isn‚Äôt in the description.
---
I'm having a hard enough time with being swarmed by 50 laggy scorched I end up wasting bullets because I shoot at them from like 10 ft and then poof they're in my face making it impossible to shoot because they keep whacking me. 
---
I was in a lucky position for 2 months where my friend and I were playing together and maining seperate weapons so we would swap ammo with each other. Now he's stopped I am at the point where I am needing to grind for shotgun shells which I was lucky to avoid for 53 levels. 
---
The grind for ammo is crazy. I think the crafting requirements for ammo need to be drastically reduced or give more rounds for the cost.
---
Okay, watch your dm's I'll show you FR 
---
rofl..... growing into its own? You mean growing into one of the biggest disasters in gaming? LOL
---
dashboard
---
Don't DM me - put it here.
---
i was always at around 250/600 until i hit 100, after that i‚Äôve been at ~550/600 and dont bother going through my stuff to get rid of extra junk and armor anymore. feel bad for my friend who spends hours just to get to 580, though i kind of get it since i‚Äôm running around with 6 power armor frames myself
---
A game like this, yes. And they are missing them all.... That should tell you that this game was not even close to being finished and launched in an unacceptable state.
---
What's it matter we'll disconnect no matter what, I'll take a few extra disconnects if it means I can at least store something other than junk and aid items to play with.
---
Okay I'll put it here. Will be a video 
---
I'm pretty sure grass is tough to mess with in this engine, unfortunately. From what I've seen from my time using the GECK and CK is that most grass isn't a normal object in the world like trees, rocks, buildings, etc. IIRC its tied to the terrain texture, so to remove grass you'd have to modify terrain on the fly, which I'm not sure this engine can handle.
---
But then again I'm no game developer, so take what I say with a grain of salt.
---
At the risk of entering into an ARGUMENT ON THE INTERNET (tm) 
---
It‚Äôs called immersion, something a great many games strive for and few succeed at.  
---
The genuine moment of fear when you miss a jump in mirrors edge and you plummet towards the ground like a lawn dart.
---
The fear of entering the dark zone the first time in the division, knowing everything here from the high level npc‚Äôs to the open area pvp is engineered to slaughter you and take your gear.
---
Hell the whole of resident evil.
---
If you‚Äôve never felt that in any game, then I genuinely feel a little sad for you, you‚Äôre missing out.
---
Why didn't you kill him before he could do anything?  When you neighbour pretends to come for a cup of tea he is really coming for murder.  Be wary next time sport.
---
Besides the places you already mentioned, I often put unused ammo in the cash register in the Artisan's Corner in the Whitespring.
---
The Artisan's Corner also seems to be the most common paper bag spot, and a few times I've found things in the nearest trash bin across the hall.
---
Sometimes I find things in the Whitespring Station luggage.
---
I still haven't found any stashes inside the bunker.
---
Got the legs from Census Violence. Yea, same circuit as you. Yup, I've done Distant thunder Both ways, but with no luck in either case. Do you happen to remember which quest netted you the Arms? I know it's supposed to be "random" But curiosity has the better of me.
---
You can't max out special points. We can see obviously that you haven't put many, if any at all, points into intelligence, or you'd understand something so basic
---
That sucks and this is bad. I'm with you here, buddy.
---
Sadly never saw one in the game :/
---
Isn't pvp on only if you claim workshops or if you hit back the aggressor? I had plenty of people randomly attacking but i just ignore them and never hit back.
---
It is absolutely stupid that I can't sell a mini nuke to a vendor.  What's the reason?  Economy balancing?  So 9 caps for a .308 round but I can't sell a mini nuke for even 1 cap?
---
What about certain notes like known plans, just drop them?
---
Guess it doesn't matter since they only have 200 caps, are usually sitting at 1 or 0 caps, and are the only way to get anything out of legendary items you don't want beyond selling them to a player.  Who cares about caps anyway they only stack up to 25k, but a signs and letters plan costs 9k.
---
Just wtf.
---
This fallout is like other fallouts: microgoals.
---
I only played Fallout 4 to collect all the power armor and hang out with Hancock. I thought the story was stupid.
---
I like the story of 76 more and I expected a little more in the way of progression. I thought we would find Raider PA and then slowly earn (grind?) to t60, etc, but you can just stumble into it all. After the last patch I have my protocoled t51b with calibrated shocks and probably won't finish anything else. :(
---
I wish they had fixed the event RNG. I'm just doing loops of cranberry bog events trying to get the Ultracite Gatling Laser plan and all I'm getting are the same things over and over. The events used to be more frequent but now they're almost rare. I used to do back-to-back "It's a trap!" in the mire and the bog but now good luck seeing that event....
---
Oh I agree. Even the fittest would only carry one rifle/gun, a pistol, one knife and the rest food/water/clothing. Power armour would make a all difference. I think the games problem is that it neither one thing or another. Alien Isolation was cool as it excelled at being survival horror with no gunplay. Doom is a first class shoot-em up, Fallout NV is a great RPG. Sadly this game is frustrating to say the least.
---
RemindMe! 8 hours "123"
---
I know right. Apparently, people think that artists/modelers should be working on QA, code writing and dlc creation. It's completely asinine. 
---
I will be messaging you on [**2019-02-05 17:07:04 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2019-02-05 17:07:04 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this link.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anc23t/second_postexplosive_weapons_are_still_really_good/)

---
Explosive bobbleheads don't stack anymore. You tried.
---
That is....Some very terrifying information....
---
I played the game with just leather armor and random guns until around level 45. Almost every day was spent scrounging for ballistic fiber until I discovered that it was less painful to simply build new armor instead of repairing broken gear. Then I made an Excavator set, picked up a  legendary Supersledge and haven't really looked back. 76 is far more tedious than many games on the market. I won't defend what this game has become, but I can rationalize it. 76 is a survival game FIRST. and a Fallout game SECOND. Survival games are tedious and hot garbage.
---
Is it shotguns? 
---
I feel like its soemthing to do with shotgun + shotgun perk + super mutant armor 
---
Yeah I agree...this was always an issue in fallout 4 too....there was no benefit to walling your workshops because spawns come all over
---
That‚Äôs extremely disappointing. They are my favorite weapons to use but I can‚Äôt figure out a way to make them viable outside of opening attacks or sneaking
---
Even if they tied stash limit to intelligence, each point gives another 100 weight, so 1 Int is 100 stash weight, 10 Int is 1000.  I mean I imagine the smarter you are the better at storage management you'd be.
---
4. FIRE the whole Bethesda Garbage Studios mismanagement team, as a starting point........
---
But... but... I *like* crippling muties...
---
random pieces go back into inventory when i enter.It's not cosmetic either it adds to carry weight.
---
If your using that many stems are you using Pharma Pharma and Natures bounty because I have like 200 stems and 60 antibotics I usually when Reset happens go to Morgan Town and Watoga at max Pharma Pharma will give you so many stems 
---
If it adds a flat damage like 5, it will be a boost for gatlin laser. If it adds a low percentage damage, then shit.
---
Grenade launchers are heavy. The gun itself is 8 pounds with a full mag
---
Maths is hard huh.
---
I‚Äôve had my camp at whitesprings since I discovered it and I‚Äôve never run into griefers. This is anecdotal though so I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt happen. I just always spawn in with enemies going after me, but griefers are lowest on the totem pole. 
---
 What a shitty figure of Bethesda!
---
Poor bell√π
---
I have no idea why so many people are willingly trying to prove they're terrible at this game.
---
I can solo a deathclaw with an explosive shotgun..... At level 30. The mirelurk queen literally folds in half. Literally folds in half.
---
One more time for the people in the back.
---
**She literally folds in half.**
---
And now thanks to fireproof you can just point blank shoot melee super mutants with no risk and just back pedal while pulling the trigger.
---
What are these other people doing? Shooting their feet? Trying to use TSE shotgun with the rifle bash only? I want to see someone upload a video of how they can't kill a level 16 super mutant so we all understand that they're facing a wall in the Enclave bunker face tanking their own explosive shots. That's the only explanation.
---
I beat almost every quest during Beta im in the same boat I just finished the Brotherhood quest because it was bugged so now im just going to stop playing 
---
I completely forgot about that...
---
I loved building in FO4 with mods, built a cool walled in Institute Sanctuary with laser and missile defenses only to realize enemies could spawn inside. 
---
So depressing 
---
On PC, right now i have the whole entire server for myself! Haha! I even took the liberty to run around whitesprings naked armed with a walking cane. Got whooped by a deathclaw, respawned and took my sweet ass time walking towards my dropped loot. Im lovin this. 
---
At the begin of my game I played with 4 Blackpowder rifles 1 dragon and 4 Blackpowder pistols in my quick slot. So you can switch fast between your BP weapons without reload your single BP Rifle :) 
---
&gt; I mean you generally are suppose to avoid enemy encounters in most survival games .
---
This game has a food and water bar that is basically just a minor inconvenience. That's about the most "survival game-y" thing in the game and doesn't really make it an actual survival game over the looter western RPG it's always been and still is. 
---
I'm in the New World hunting Arch Tempered Elder Dragons and making armor from their skin.
---
Exactly. Combined with Hardcore mode, high damage output/received makes the funniest and most intriguing FO4 playthroughs. 
---
Always on your toes. 
---
I first looked at this and thought "Dungeon Siege 1 or 3".  Then I noticed the acronym better.
---
600 is abysmally low. You need at least 10k. At least, with my super hoarding on FO4 goes. (I don't own 76 yet.) 
---
My experience with Fo76 has made sure I won't be buying the next Elder Scrolls till after sufficient reviews are published.
---
Tbf you shouldn't compare a RL minigun with Fallout's minigun, the ones in this game shoot what ilooks like an even less powerful round than 5.56.
---
I got an armor piercing laser pistol üòÇ
---
With rad worms glitch I have up to 919 dmg on my .50 machine gun. Before nerf I had ~1500 without any worms. Anyway, enough to kill sbq alone. 
---
If you‚Äôre on PC add me and we can have some fun with sbq. 
---
I‚Äôd love to see Grognak and Jim Pickens rolling around the wasteland together. 
---
Have you heard about our lord and savior, critical hit?
---
No.
---
The tactics are the same since BETA and she's only gotten squishier.
---
1) Find a shotgun. Level 10. It doesn't matter. Explosive? Doesn't matter. Medics with increased bash damage. Doesn't matter. Two-Shot might save you 5 shotgun cartridges.
---
2) Equip Enforcer
---
3) Blind fire 360 no-scope anywhere near her
---
4) When she lands, which she will because she's now completely crippled in pure intimidation of your no-scope shotgunning, beat on her
---
If one or two people do the above it doesn't matter how many scrubs are nearby. It just works. It took me many salty losses to understand that there isn't any reason to try anything else.
---
I‚Äôll hop on DS1 with you if you have the remastered on ps4
---
Wow. Never though to use 2-3 dragons. Thanks mate. 
---
All bloodied weapons are OP. The difference is, you can shoot the bloodied melee user before they get to you, and the bloodied, explosive gauss rifle user kills you from like 100 yards away.
---
I found out their real weak point is the thruster. only problem is the damn thing is covered by the arms most of the time.
---
Always build foundations first to raise it above ground then wall in the generator on the foundations.
---
It's not the size that matters. It's whether they can create interesting and challenging fights there.
---
Eh, it, honestly was the same in Fallout 4 as well, they just copied most of the stats you had there. 
---
Discipline is enforced. Its not popular but really there's lots of room.
---
 Scrap everything. Make sure its scrap before it goes in your box. Unscrapped junk will be put in if you have any, like bottles for instance. It should only be glass scrap never bottles. I'm sure a lot of people could reduce quite a bit just by doing this.
---
 Horders are punished and I'm OK with that. ;) A friend plays F4 and he is panting all the time 'cause he MUST pick up everything. Don't do this.
---
 You have to learn what the junk is to know whether its worth taking. Study your junk till you know, a Typewriter has one screw, a Carlyle Typewriter has 2 screws. A tin can has 1 lead, I could go on. The search thing is good, but you should know. 
---
 Sell everything Legendary. ;)
---
This and FO3 with all the DLCs is amazing too. Mothership Zeta and The Pitt were so extremely fun for me. 
---
Any advice for someone doing it solo?
---
I have over 300 of each of those.   Yet, I got only 300 steel and 30 lead.   So....  Excavator + Ore Mining.
---
My guns irl dont even weigh near half of what they weigh in the game. Shit all 3 of my rifles alone dont even top 20 lbs lol
---
Save Up for Calibrated Shocks on Excavator Armor There is a glitch that you get an extra hundred pounds when you spawn in but if you die you lose it so instead of the 100 pound bonus you have 200 pounds than you put the shocks on that adds 50 to each leg giving you an additional 100 pounds so if you have level three strong back and 15 strength you can have 570 carry weight  
---
Thanks god we have mods on pc. Without perk loader this game literally unplayable. I use all 8 configs. 
---
I agree with you, and I‚Äôm glad that this post is getting some visibility. However, you really should proof read what you write before you decide to post it. 
---
Greg (fast travel to Grafton, follow the tracks north until you see a Nuka Cola sign, go in the building behind it) has all excavator mods.
---
Hey, now I know why I can't find the witch hat in my crafting menu! I spent sooooooo long server hopping to get that set and I was miffed when I could only make the dress.

Rember when comic movies didn't need no universe? 
---
"Reddit" isn't implementing the changes that Bethesda is.  Bethesda is doing that.  People have a right to complain about shitty ideas and their implementations.  I defended the game a lot when it first came out because most of what I was seeing was ill informed opinions or in many cases, flat out fabrications and lies.  But lately, Bethesda has been screwing up harder.
---
"Reddit" hasn't destroyed anything.  
---
Grats!  I am still looking for that exact weapon.   Refuse to buy it.
---
Although I would pretty much take any legendary handmade and be able to scrap my crafted one.  250+ hours.
---
Kill ir i≈° the same. Maybe 4min added to each kill, usually around 15min now. 
---
I get Cheers messages sometimes am name is on the Goody Bag platform. So all good
---
Hm... You missed the elite loot: Ultracite vents.
---
As someone playing on Xbox, I can tell you it‚Äôs rough sometimes. Especially when you forget to switch your crafting cards out for combat and adventuring cards. All the sudden I‚Äôm a lot heavier because I left Ammosmith on instead of Thru-Hiker. 
---
The robot on that dies in like 3 hits from ghouls
---
I‚Äôve had her glitch out and not land when horribly crippled. Just stays flying in one spot, just out of reach of the melee guys. That was pre-nerf though. 
---
Your suggestion to beat on her works fine if you‚Äôre spec‚Äôed for melee. Many of us aren‚Äôt.  My TSE Prime 50 still does ~150 damage, with a bonus against her. That‚Äôs less than any melee (with my build) and has a much higher DPS. The only big benefit to melee is Incisor.

My AAE powerful, automatic handmade does fine, with just tank killer and demolitions expert. I'm melee, so I really just carry it for when I can't be fucked to close range. I can still full clear Harper's Ferry whether it's mutants, scorched, or ghouls, using just the gun, without breaking a sweat. A little bit more ammo if it's mutants, but hey, that's to be expected.
---
Just pretend your CAMP is a mole rat enclosure when they suddenly spawn inside.
---
I think the harpoon gun and broadsider can though. 
---
Holy shirt balls*
---
I have got maxed pharma pharma and I think level 2 nature‚Äôs bounty, and my day always starts off in Morgan Town...though Watoga is an impossibility for me. I‚Äôm level 47 rifle/stealth build and always seem to be under levelled to the mobs (though some of that is poor perk choices outside of luck and perception.)
---
Qq
---
You can mod any Combat Armor into BoS including weightess.
---
are you using max PA 
---
PC, sorry :\
---
While this sort of playstyle might work for you, for others it's painful.
---
No ability to collect unique items like outfits or legendaries. No ability to future-proof junk needs. I get some junk is more useful than others but it's the difference between being able to craft what you want, when you want and having to do a junk run BEFORE doing all of this.
---
As it stands I can live with 600 but considerable sacrifices I'd rather not make a made to work within in.
---
That and I'm almost always over-encumbered. Not by a lot so I can still fast travel but sprinting mid-to-late quest or junk run is just a pipe dream.
---
Yes similar to what they had in 3
---
Yup.
---
Griefing uh...finds a way.
---
Slap damage varies. To a level 50+ in high end armour you‚Äôll mitigate most of the slap.  To a low level in a leather thong not so much, and exhausting a low levels supply of stimpacks by pecking them to death is relatively easy. 
---
Also you can force them into pvp. Slap them, then just continually follow them jumping infront of any shot they take at an enemy. Instantly the game registers they‚Äôve returned fire, then finish them off.
---
Follow them to their base and fuck it up because you can and they‚Äôve no recourse but to server hop.
---
All of these are things I‚Äôve genuinely had happen to me. 
---
For a while if I saw someone wearing excavator armour with a super sledge of any description I just presumed they were a dick because it seems to be the default uniform of the wasteland asshat. (You‚Äôd assume raider armour wouldn‚Äôt you, but nope, not with all that extra carry capacity)
---
The ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù pvp mechanics of 76 have a startling number of workarounds 
---
For example, if a white uniform spawned on the bed should I leave it and server hop? Or does picking it up not make a difference to spawning in a different world? 
---
I rather would turn the argument the other way round. Since this is ought to be a multiplayer game, it should have spongy enemies with lots of HP for groups to take on. However, the survival aspect itself with munition scrapping and other stuff seems to contradict these multiplayer aspects, cause all those constant needs keep people occupied and hinder groupplay.
---
I would really like the addition of repair kits but the only thing that concerns me is that they would be hidden behind some other perk card. Which sorta defeats the purpose of me flipping around my perk cards consistently when I repair my armor or weapons. 
---
But I would really like the addition of repair kits. 
---
I'm not specced for melee. If she's not landing and not screaming then everyone needs to scatter. She'll land. If she's still screaming you should still be shooting.
---
If she's doing a jig in the air you have a heavy gunner with One Gun Army on. Good luck.
---
You don't need to be specced for melee. The assumption is no one else brought a @#$! gun and _they are_ specced for melee. You also benefit from the reduced DR (she has higher DR in the air) as a ranged build. Or throw orbital strikes. Whatever you're into.
---
Crystal and Gold can both se sold to vendors. 
---
If we‚Äôre looking at weight, let‚Äôs take a look at the handmade. Looks a lot like an ak-47. The handmade weighs about 16-20lbs depending on perks. A real ak with a 30 round mag of 5.56 is about 10.5lbs. If they based the weapons in game vs. weapons irl, things would work better I feel. 
---
Side note, while mini nukes weigh 6lbs in game, I feel they‚Äôd weigh more irl. Not that I‚Äôm advocating for that, I‚Äôm just saying I still drop them because of that reason. 
---
&gt; This effing game has people questioning their computers, their internet, their sanity
---
Welcome to Asia.
---
It was straight up unplayable for weeks after the 1 month point. So many issues and zero visibility 
---
It's as if we're lot living through a post apocalyptia...
---
Having said that though, my experience is nothing like this. I might get the occasional griefer but it's very rare.
---
Not against a PvE only mode. It's my preferred playstyle but it's not for everyone. Hopefully Survival mode sorts out most of everyone's needs.
---
Not what I meant. I‚Äôve use the shotgun/enforcer bit to cripple her. She would just float in mid air, flapping her wings but not doing anything. Could still be killed, but was out of range of the melee guys. 
---
Gutsies are the peasants of the robot world. The assaultron dominator and the sentry bot are supposed to be the scary ones. At higher levels they are laughable. Not the gutsies though. This is another example of poor balancing. It's like giving a scorchbeast scream attack to a radrat.
---
Stealthy as possible power armor is a must along with a high damage build and a lot of ammo I found the tesla rifle shotgun mod really killed most of the bots in groups.
---
Yea, dont lol .. 
---
Troubleshooter weapon effect Will help since they are All robots. Have an extra weapon in case it breaks. But they are All kind of nasty now even at level 100
---
Currently im not having an Issue I just use Excavator Armor with Calibrated Shocks and Max Strength/ Carry Weight perks gives me 575 carry weight plus the 600 in stash thats 1,175 storage the only problem is when I die I have to hop servers 
---
Just logged in today and did a trial with one item that i bulked so had 3 bulked and it disappeared  as well
---
Reload cycle must be a pain in the arse if you miss enough to not finish the job through the first volley.
---
For Mr she's dead in about ten minutes. OP tse has spoiled a lot of people is what I've noticed, yes she's not dead in less than a minute anymore but she doesn't take an hour like some would have you believe..
---
On PC. I've only disconnected once since the Jan 29th patch. It's more stable than it's ever been for me.
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt mean an x percentage chance of auto picking, I mean it just picks or hacks the terminal straight out of ur skill is above the skill level of the lock or terminal
---
But relogging at public workshops will make you pay more caps..
---
https://vimeo.com/315406031 Here's your fucking link. 
---
u/richardgrey76 might as well get a look too.
---
ok thnx..how do i get the mod for permanent use on any peice of armor? by scrapping bos peices?
---
I farmed the fuck out of this event, while occasionally announcing I have him avail. on market sub, all while NEVER wearing anything responder related(as well as people who would come to visit). 
---
What you wear has absolutely no effect of whether or not the event triggers or its hostile. He is passive unless attacked first, direct(gunfire, melee, etc) or indirectly(mutation splash dmg, power armor mod splash dmg, power armor charge, etc). 
---
Please stop misleading people &gt;.&lt;
---
See the first paragraph of what you're replying to.
---
Scatter. If you have a way to do a lot of damage to her in the air _train her on you_ and run. She'll land.
---
I have the raider/T-40 PA closet level to me I can find as I go, plus the BoS PA stashed for when I get to 50. I haven‚Äôt really bothered with perks in PA as yet, but I am starting to think sniper/stealth is a waste of time due to all the nerfing - will probably go for a tank build re-do all perks when I hit 50.
---
if thats satan what am i with a 1000 cap bounty???
---
Thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis.
---
When I'll get home I'll show you the evidence to contrary. Up to you to figure out what you're doing wrong.
---
194 it says with all perks 
---
You know what's challenging? Playing a new style.  You know what you're forced to do? Streamline one playstyle and work around that.
---
Isn't very Fallout when you can't even play the game like other Fallout games.
---
yes, and they limit per shop only 200 caps, this is ridiculous.
---
I just showed you that it doesn't work, with video proof...
---
Can't win on reddit 
---
Same, I literally can't bulk and sell my stuff quick enough.
---
The fact you need to create a 'bank alt' character should be telling enough. :/
---
And I'll show you with video proof that it does.
---
Can confirm. Broadsider for sure can. Traded one awhile back to someone. I wonder how the crossbow would work being quad?
---
In the past I could just kill her in place.  That 50 did enough damage for me to slowly inch her health down pretty much alone. The problem is I don‚Äôt have control of the other players. I can shout on voice chat til I‚Äôm hoarse to get off or out of the fucking building but they‚Äôll never listen.  If they‚Äôre still standing around, me running off won‚Äôt do anything. 
---
The biggest problems other than the bugs I encounter down there is the idiots who have no idea what they‚Äôre doing or who are there to freeload XP and loot unaware (or not caring) that they‚Äôre buffing her. 
---
Dont Focus much on the + Damage perks until level 50. Get a wellrounded build with bonus to carryweight, action point refresh, dromedar and metabolisme, so you can Play longer without going to camp. Use a 2hander and powerarmor.
---
I have completed main story 4 times and that 1 point in Chemist helped me more than 6 points in slugger...
---
Oh, and check out www.nukesdragons.com
---
Upvote for the legit nature of the post. I‚Äôm realizing that my non-legendary hunting rifle only does 113 at level 97 is because of how I‚Äôm specked out. Next several level will be dedicated to adding and removing unnecessary special points and perk cards. 
---
have you invested in full life giver perk run that and max power armor you can even run 45 excavator you don't run through that much ammo I started as a melee. Switched to TSE but switched back to Melee after nerf was not hurt because all my redistributed points came from my maxed Charisma that I had maxed at the begging of the game when it was suppose too be good but now I just have enough points for max Vendor perk and Traveler   
---
I have 4 charecters... 1 main, 1 for weapons, 1 for armour and 1 for aid/chems/junk. Weapons girl is currently at critical mass, with 1660lbs on her person and 600 in stash. Armour girl is around 1200lbs on her person and 600 stash. Aid girl is around 80lbs on her person and 400 stash. I would love to be able to keep it all on one charecter, but that is not happening anytime soon. Yes, i know, i am hoarding too much etc. But it is saved for when we get vending.
---
Don‚Äôt know about the harpoon gun, but the broadsider has an option for a multi shot canister, so it being able to be quad/double makes sense.
---
Thanks! Great info, but the link just shows an page not found error.
---
[Moonlight] (https://moonlight-stream.org)?  Why yes, I'd like to know more 
---
From PvP oriented perspective I feel your saddnes and I wish you that all PvPers migrate to PvP servers and that your PvP suggestions are mostly ignored.
---
If they made the bounty rewards greater, more people would join that up. Actual result contesting the desired result.
---
Also, if you move your camp as a whole everything inside is fixed and stored. Not relevant for all the camps, relevant for most of them.
---
Abusing the game doesn't count bro 
---
Yea, I just passed 500 hours played and never happened to me once. But build small and blue print it and place it near where you explore..
---
Was this your first nuke? Cause this is like seriously old news. Whitesprings is probably the most popular target, with FSP being second. 
---
I wonder if you can quad a quad? I actually have a quad attachment for a broadsider (been trying to sell it) but it would have been interesting to equip it to a quad broadsider. A quad - quad broadsider?
---
That's the long way. Sometimes you can find the plans available for sale by players, or as random loot in game, as well. I might actually have some for sale if you're xbox.
---
Moat of the time a group of people jump into each of the nuke sute with a surplus of keycards and start guessing the code(atleast that‚Äôs what I remember happening little under a while back) and then they post the correct code here: https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
You can find the plan for sale (try Phoenix, I think?) or learn it by scrapping any combat armor pieces, including the helmet.
---
Dude, No... Dont tell anybody anything lol... Like real life, some are griefers..
---
How exactly am I abusing it? By using rclick to aim and lclick to shoot?
---
The fact people use alts as personal banks should be extremely telling.
---
I‚Äôd be interested in how effective an anti-armor one is compared to Bloodied. 
---
Generally AA is extremely effective on high level anything, even high level scorched running around in flannel shirts have high DR. The net impact is on the order of the the x1.9 damage buff a rad build gets out of a bloodied weapon. 
---
In favor of AA, this will be even more apparent on a weapon without an anti-armor mod (like a perforating mag on a handmade). 
---
On the other hand. Its 150 damage is borderline when it comes to getting through DR. And 150 is it just bloodied, it‚Äôs after bloodied, adrenal reaction and nerd rage combined. If you‚Äôre not a rad build, all three of these go away (replaces by something like AA), and you might end up needing to spend time roasting each enemy. 
---
And once it‚Äôs not an insta-gib cooker... it will be less explosive minigun and more flamer. 
---
Would love to hear your impressions :)
---
It's a very elitist attitude. You sound like the kind of person that invests their ego into how power their characters are. That's pretty sad.
---
This game is meant to be fun for all, regardless of their situation and time commitment. 
---
Anyhow, relax kid. Bethesda is looking at balancing heavy weapons in future updates so heavies may have their day in the sun.
---
I know that is why I did it I seen that there were like 12 level 100+ there and nuked the damn place for them. I don't know considering it was my first nuke and I did it solo forgive me for being kinda proud of myself lol.
---
ok..cheers
---
I‚Äôve had quite a few with loads of caps inside. The most I got in one container 102 caps
---
You can also nuke Morgantown to get a pretty decent farming location . It‚Äôs spawns a lot of glowing ones too. 
---
It‚Äôll make it a 7 shot. Why 7 instead of 16?  Because Bethesda no do good math apparently. 
---
Seriously, the reason is because legendary mods are apparently based on base stats. Quad, Double, and weightless are based on the base stats and any mod just ads to it.  I‚Äôve got a ‚Äúweightless‚Äù minigun that weighs 8lb. 90% reduced weight my ass. My understanding is double/quad work the same. 
---
im ps4..ok time to hunt down some plans  üòÄ
---
I knew someone was going to comment on me not looking down the sight. - I'm using one hand to move and one hand to record the screen. 
---
Thanks for the advice üòÅ I put too much in charisma too, so will start on full life giver and maxing power armour ASAP. I'm currently working on getting the excavator power armour... but damn, can I find junk to scrap for screws when I need it?! üòÇ Thankfully only 3 away now.
---
Just saying it‚Äôs a very popular spot because of all those ghouls. Fissure Prime is probably the second most popular.  Every now and then it‚Äôll land in odd places, like south of the water park (I do this when I need violet), Morgantown, and now occasionally Monongah. 
---
No worries, it was the sarcastic kind of "sure",no way to tell in text though.
---
Lol. "It just works."
---
They kinda messed up legendary weapons imo. Ugh. Bethesda. 
---
Goris will wear it willingly if you just ask.
---
Sugar grove desk fans and springs
---
I don't care what you do or not. I told you what I do - now do point out which part of it is abusing the game?
---
Also, my group just had several Legendaries do the same in WS on the golf course. 91 Glowing Deathclaw, and Scroched Beast,  along with several ghouls.
---
SB and several ghouls all glitched out for the entire group of 6.
---
im not misleading anyone what i described happened. maybe people can have different experiences than you.  it dont make mine false and a lie.
---
https://nukesdragons.com sorry
---
Were you behind the golf course clubhouse? 
---
Perhaps I‚Äôm wrong on this but I thought he was using an algorithm to guess possible outcomes knowing the 8 letters and numbers by the algorithm randomly guessing keywords, using it to decrypt, then looking for a word in the decrypted result.
---
Obviously this still would result in a lot of possible key codes, but a lot less than a brute force attack.  It would appear random to an outside observer though. 
---
I'll look at the situation and ask if it's worth using the ammo or not, most of the time it's not so I'll just walk away. 
---
It's called Dragonplate Armor. 
---
Oops, wrong franchise... XD
---
Explosive buff mods like magazines or bobbleheads is my guess? 
---
All 4 levels of explosive and 12 charisma to share level 3 from the rest of your team having it? 
---
I don't know what you're doing to change your damage but you're on pc so it could be anything 
---
Not sure but I'll buy it for 1.5k
---
I‚Äôm not selling it, I‚Äôm just asking if it‚Äôs rare.
---
did you kill hime? I've never seen this before, I'd have let him live for trying something new
---
That website can show you at what level any perk become available. Great tool for nerds üòé
---
Will also add - picklock and hacker was great in Fallout 4, but here you dont need them at all.
---
It's ok. They'll fix this but undo half of the last patch inadvertently
---
Oh look, someone drowning in his own ignorance and being amazed that people can learn shit
---
Could be anything, while client is server side, OK. Just stop.
---
4 CHA - I only play solo.
---
No bobbleheads. No magazines.
---
Some points in Demo perk.
---
0 other shotgun perks.
---
Oh. Screw that, I don't use Facebook.
---
PC :) AsHawkins
---
Fallout 76,  Where you better bring a sledgehammer to a gunfight
---
I meant for local radius at least, in character interface. Not global chat.
---
You are correct except not a replica, it's a conversion from a full auto gun. The barrel and receiver are new parts, the receiver has been modified to not allow a full auto bolt  and bolt carrier and the original bolt and bolt carrier we're modified as well but majority was modifed from original parts.
---
At least you aren‚Äôt playing it on console.
---
Additional solution: don't play online multi-player games if you can't stand getting grief. People suck. 
---
Congrats. I'd be very happy with a shotgun, handmade or LAR with TSE for SBQ purposes.
---
whitespring is the only actually decent drop spot because it‚Äôll be guaranteed ghouls and they dont stop respawning because people keep coming in and out. i‚Äôve seen more and more desperate people nuke monongah and it‚Äôs always trash because the spawns get mixed up with mole miners after a while. 
---
tried harpers ferry with my friends once, same thing there. it spawned mutants after the ghouls were gone, got a couple decent legendaries from the three star mutants and ghouls but after everything‚Äôs dead it started spawning scorched and those dont spawn legendaries :(
---
u/StaffinFraktion answered it best, but it's not a machine gun it has been converted to only allow semi auto so it's treated like any other rifle just belt fed.
---
Yh i think you are right on that one, it has been a while since i read into it, but what you said sounds more around the lines of what happened
---
That is exactly my point. It's a freaking hat in a video game.
---
There is a loading screen in the game that mentions alien blaster so I think it can be found somewhere
---
What annoys me is how only certain things can be bulked. Recently cleared out a bunch of antiseptic, asbestos and circuits as my scavving habits from FO4 still has me picking up stuff I don't really need. 
---
Luck of the draw should really help with that, and some enemys are really OP indeed 
---
Your dumb af
---
Pretty much the best way to put it
---
I believe with fpsmmo type games this is always an issue. And I also think the issue is over looked quite a bit or over corrected and ruins the feel of the game.
---
My suggestion? Make special ammo types for each type of monster or creature. Give us the ability to craft grenades that weaken enemies. Give the syringer more viable options for buff or debuff Gameplay. 
---
For instance, we can have super mutants for example be weakened by freezing effects. Their thick skin and muscle mass make it hard for ballistic damage to phase them and their mutated bone structure make melee damage almost useless. Add to that if you use radiation on them they should heal and even sometimes grow more massive and mutate if enough radiation damage is done. But if you freeze them it makes their skin brittle and slows their movements. Allowing the player to deal more damage and stand a fighting chance.
---
 If Bethesda put a little bit more thought into their enemies instead of going to the go to "Bullet sponge" that is being over used like crazy these days then we could be left with not only an incredible game but one that sets the standard for future FPSMMO type games.
---
Not everyone is dropping to farm legendaries. If I drop on Morgantown it‚Äôs to farm Cobalt and items needed to craft flux. I‚Äôll drop south of the water park to farm violet and cobalt, but few enemies spawn there. 
---
I‚Äôve pretty much never gotten a great gun at Whitesprings. Best I‚Äôve ever gotten was a troubleshooter‚Äôs exploding gatling. Everything else was total garbage.  I used to farm it daily, sometimes multiple drops in a day. 
---
It's because all of the duping going on
---
It's good for Cobalt Flux. I got about 70 I think if I remember correctly.
---
Yup totally drunk reading this thread
---
PvPis a failure and should be removed from the game entirely.
---
LITERALLY NOONE ASKED FOR DEMO CARD NERF, TSE OVER NERFED.
---
This happened to me at the nuclear dump north of Whitesprings the other day. He was legendary but had a turrible drop, of course.
---
Well not necessarily, some have been chambered in      .45-70 which isn't necessarily a round to laugh at especially with modern powders and projectiles
---
There is a hot tip here for you. Get a friend to place their camp on a different server, in the same place as yours. Try to log on their server and you get the message to say your camp cannot be placed. Move your camp and hey presto... all your stuff is back undamaged. My decon shower was destroyed and i did this by accident onw time when moving camp. The decon shower was fixed! I am sure thos cannot get downvoted as it helps everyone right?
---
For me, lever action is the best. I use a regular one, though i won't say no to a quadro ammo variation. WIth all rifleman, agility  and critical perks (P15 L15 A15) it's awsome. It excels at destroying large packs - super mutants, Whitesprings ghouls, mole miners. Mostly it oneshots if you are using headshots. I tried the gauss but it's too clunky. Charged shots +VATS  mechanics is bugged and  reload takes too long.
---
I‚Äôm a major pacifist and don‚Äôt PvP, but the mechanic is there in the game and for the most part it‚Äôs unregulated. It‚Äôs sad reality that those of us who don‚Äôt want to do it get dragged into it in the form of unsolicited attacks on our character and our camps. I can see the PvPers side too, they are legit able to do it. Let‚Äôs hope the Survival servers will give us all what we all want/need. Peace for the pacifist and mayhem for the PvPers.
---
I forget the exact number, but you can count it in nukacrypt using \_ as the keyword. It's around 140 keywords.
---
I tried it with industrial water purifiers but even after hours they weren't filled up (5 or 6). Some weeks before I had no difficulties with them.
---
Adding on to this. Do you know how horrifying it would be if someone nuked an area filled with super mutants. And now due to the excess radiation we have Nightkins, super mutant behemoths and other variants all over. Man that would be horrifying.
---
Get a full set of Troubeshooter armor.  Then it's so easy.
---
A lot less than the 100 million possible permutations of the 8 numbers. 
---
That is just dope ass hell.
---
That's true haha but most groups have 5/6 enemys. So with the insane vats precision of black powder weapons you one shot most of them before all of your 9 BP rifles are empty. But yes. After a fight you have a long reload time 
---
Same here ... doing Events and Daily in Forest Region everyday and still no outfit....
---
Bruh, if I have to fight deathclaws in PA after the next update I‚Äôm hunting you down. Lol. 
---
My experience is that the ideal number of people is around 6 or 7. I'm a heavy gunner and use Gatling and she lands on me pretty reliably. I had failed queen runs with 12+ people because her DR got so high that barely anyone could damage here in air or on the ground, pre and post TSE nerf.
---
WHAT?
---
Ah man... my crafting materials!
---
Oh well, at least I have a spare suit for who knows what reason.
---
true, it‚Äôs just that when someone‚Äôs dropping a nuke to monongah i‚Äôve only ever heard people talk about legendaries, never flux in that place. 
---
i can agree that whitespring legendaries are trash almost everytime, i‚Äôve gotten one good gun i still hold on to, everythng else‚Äôs been the usual. that‚Äôs why i havent bothered to go there for weeks
---
Bullet sponge enemies everywhere
---
Constant bullshit enemy mechanics
---
Guns doing BB damage
---
*seems fine to me*
---
Top idea, would also give some kind of value to the whole raider thing
---
Im only level 20 lol so not a raider, however the thought of hiding secret stash's about to get +100 each time is awesome. 
---
I would omit the ticks completely. There is a perk that gives a certain chance to get an additional item (stimpak?) when searching the according containers. I have more than I can produce also due to the limiting factor of my stash with holds only necessary items. This requires of course that you wander around at least a bit.
---
Who did they get to consult as a creative designer on this game. Anita Sarkeesian and a North Korean defector who worked as a re-education camp director?
---
Have lvl 3 hacking and lock picking. Ez mode.üòÄ
---
someone help, after this update i could no longer play the game and always get stuck signing in, anyone else got this problem?
---
:o
---
The alleged underground bunker is different from the alien blaster looted near Clarksburg in the Northern part of the map.
---
Me too. I want people besides me to recognize Bette Jurass in the Wasteland. 
---
Assume it is done like this, so that when you move your camp you only have to set down the one foundation? :)
---
Can't you just store the broken arc, then place it again? Works with corn! 
---
1. What platform are you playing on? PS4
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account - Joenss
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.) - keeps disconnecting from server every 2 minutes, then doesn't save my progress.
---
IS THERE SOMEONE THAT NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?! 
---
Complete mayor for a day and the robots in watoga will leave you alone. Also the mayors office gives you 8 stimpacks a day and it's right next to EMS which is full of med kits
---
Also Robotics Expert.
---
Awesome... i never want to encounter him in the wasteland though. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming you use automatic weapons? Because I only use non-automatic rifles and I never have a problem with my weapon‚Äôs condition going down too fast..
---
PS4 btw
---
I have. It's disappointing. Just a regular scorch beast and a few scorched and a bit of ore.
---
It's no challenge and the rewards are miserable. 
---
Whitesprings and fissure prime are to the two locations worthy of nuke. The rest is either off limits or the rewards are poor.
---
At the moment pretty much the only way to *not* have enemies spawning on your plants is to plant them indoors on campfires. I wish they'd just add the planters back in because it's lame as is.
---
Yeah but still doable if theres at least 4-5 levels +100 there
---
I dropped once in Monongah. Bunch of ghouls, then.... nothing. Place went dead. Plenty of Yellowcake there, but I‚Äôm already overflowing with it and don‚Äôt even bother anymore except for orbitals. 
---
Even SBQ has been hit and miss. Sometimes can‚Äôt kill her. Sometimes she drops garbage. Legendary wood leg and my 100th explosive bent plan!  Woohoo!  
---
My RNG luck sucks. 
---
And the UC ore was already there.
---
I have never had bloody mess but it happens *constantly* since the patch. At this point, I have just gotten into the habit of looting things *as I punch them to death* because if I let them fall to the ground they disappear half the time.
---
no opinion on this one but are you sure this sub is the right place for a message to a youtuber?
---
Then just unsubscribe and dont give him your click. 
---
I agree it's a problem but tossing their names around and giving them more recognition (however small it may be) isn't the right answer either. Like a child throwing a tantrum for no reason, ignore it and it will stop eventually.
---
Killed her in under 5 mins the other day with say 10 of us. Maybe someone had an op wep but she's as easy 2 kill as always
---
To add some balance, how about a % chance to auto-pick it. Fail and you break your bobby pin. Each failed auto-pick reduces the chances of subsequent auto-picks (to prevent someone from just spamming the auto-pick button). 
---
I see the health bar, but it looks like is head is gone. 
---
Was ready for another increase about 2 hours after the increase fron 400 to 600
---
Yeah he‚Äôll read it. Most youtubers beating a dead horse on this game come to this sub to create more drama. I don‚Äôt care what comes of it, it needs to be said and I said it. So I‚Äôm happy.
---
If they were glowing red for both of you Im not sure... odd
---
Problem with Hardened Mass is that it's considered as a junk item so you have the risk of losing it when you die. Perhaps you meant the Glowing Mass? I suppose that could be reduced to, although it's much more marginal since you don't carry the risk of losing it like you do with junk items, so you could just keep carrying it on you. 
---
Over the weekend on one of the servers I was on it only took a group maybe 10 minutes.  I'm not sure what they did, but most of them were 80+.  I'm thinking one of 3 things.  They glitched it some how, they have good gear and have her on farm status, or they built camps that were just turrets. 
---
So she can still be killed in the time frame with a good group of players.  The problem is the servers.  You never know if it's going to disconnect.  
---
dont worry, at this point the wood armor and explosive vent are a guaranteed drop for all of us so you‚Äôre definitely not alone on that one
---
The thing about database recall stuff... I don't believe it.
---
Why? Because minecraft exists and you can play on a modded server with apllied energistics and pretty much have infinite storage space.
---
The more reasonable explanation is that they intend to sell storage space in the atom shop in a few months.
---
You have any outfits?
---
Kinda pissed Bethesda said they won‚Äôt be removing the UC armor plans (not the mods, the pieces) even though they‚Äôre putting in a way to learn them all for free like with the X-01 set. 
---
Anyone that gets to that point will already have the plans from doing Belly of the Beast (or will go back and get them post-patch)  and won‚Äôt need them.  What good does it do to leave them in?  Why not be possible for another prime or UC mod drop?
---
I got my first TSE after 220ish levels. Mama Dolches ate it and my first ever weight reduction chest a few weeks after getting them. Have not seen a single other TSE drop and got my 2nd ever weight reduction chest only last week. My main is level 437.
---
The TSE focus was purely from duping. These weapons are extremely rare. Same with armor. Ive got a full set of sentinel gear, all of it is janky. I only have 1 cavalier/assassin piece. Actual great BiS items are ludicrously hard to get.
---
Ha! Love it....what's the minimum range on the artillery strike? I have my camp set up across the street from a pretty dense super mutant spawn and would love to be able to just blow them away.
---
There‚Äôs a way to get an extra 200 instead of 100, making the max weight 670. Then you can have all the weight cards on as well.
---
No bro sorry, just Bober jacket
---
That‚Äôs odd about the ammo, I just hit level 50 and have way too much ammo and gunpowder do I end up just dropped tons of it, weight is noticeable I agree but the best way to manage your ammo is to stick to 1-3 weapons and only stock ammo for those, I always drop missiles and plasma cartridges (basically anything that has more than normal carry weight)
---
Very rare. Don't let that guy trick you.
---
Issue re: the Scorchbeast. 
---
I am level 56 and was wearing Power Armour.  I just attempted to fight a level 50 Scorchbeast with a level 75 and level 125 weapons. As soon as you fire at it, it continually fires at you. Your weapons don't function while it's firing it's continuous volley, which is ridiculous. Of course, I was quickly nearly killed without an opportunity to meaningfully return fire.  When I did return fire, there was no impact at all by my direct hits.  
---
 My only choice, as usual, was to get off the server and go back to fighting repetitive, tedious enemies.  This is a completely rubbish part of the game. There were no other players in the vicinity so I should have been given a chance to have some fun. The game is supposed to be for lone players as well as teams. The thing hardly ever gets still and close enough to hit and when it does, your weapons won't function because it's continually firing. This sucks and needs to be looked at.  Surely it can't be that difficult to fix the game-play a bit.  
---
People pay up to max caps for it
---
I‚Äôm back in Skyrim and have been for a few days. I only get on 76 for the daily quests now for my atom points. The feels are real. 
---
You said AN air strike, as in one, and that he destroyed your ENTIRE base. Even with the wrecking ball perk, can one air strike wipe an entire base?
---
Appreciate it.
---
I honestly didn‚Äôt know it was this rare.
---
So how are characters under 100 free game? And also you deal WAY less than half damage through the slap mechanic.
---
Geez I wonder why you go so many downvotes.
---
Then I suggest maybe you click on the comments section of the you tubers in question and voice your thoughts there 
---
And you seem like a cunt. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Missiles and Mini Nukes. Get rid of them all. Saved me 100lbs in storage. I never used them anyway. 
---
Oh, I'm very well aware that real weapons work differently than video game weapons. 
---
My point concerns the "combat niche" of the weapons, not an exact comparison to real life. 
---
If I can perform better with a small arm (say, a rifle) than with a heavy weapon in a situation for which the heavy weapon is supposedly designed, something seems wrong, regardless of which gun has the bigger bullet etc. 
---
They should add a weapon stand.  Maybe holds one melee, one pistol, one long gun and one big gun (like mini gun or nuke.  Just getting four guns out the stash would help tremendously.  Also if we could store extra power Armor on the power armor station and it would stay there.  
---
"So ive never had a tse of any kind" opinion invalidated. Good day sir.
---
Sorry for this question but can anyone who comes by my base just level it if he wants to? Like I got pacifist mode on, i dont like pvp and usually i only go home to my camp before logging out.
---
So is it possible someone comes over and destroys it in my absense and I come home to nothing? Or do you need to be on a special server or engaged in pvp beforehand for this to happen?
---
Killed it in 43 seconds on saturday night. was about 12 people, many from the text chat mod on PC. People sometimes announce if a queen is coming up and others then join in.
---
Communication let us murder it. Even if it was just to call for reinforcements.
---
Watch yourself boy. People who don‚Äôt like griefing aren‚Äôt whiners. They‚Äôre just talking about how they don‚Äôt like the griefing and suggesting ways to make it better.
---
Wanted players lose twice what they‚Äôre wanted for.
---
Your experience is not the same as everyone elses. 
---
Nah. I like it the way it is. If you‚Äôre cheating and someone videos it; you can‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt you. 
---
The green hood isn't very rare. It has a set spawn you can hop/farm. Now the leather coat or traveling leather coat that pairs with it... That outfit is damn near priceless.
---
\*Join and complete events the yellow icon map markers. \*After completing Watoga mayor for a day quest the robots will not attack you, so then you can farm Watoga's robots. \*Farm West tek super mutants.
---
When robobrains had sentry bot drop table it was possible, but now its mainly power plants. 
---
yeah sorry about that. Hardened mass goes in stash, glowing mass stays with me. 
---
Those videos only prove that building system in this game needs better and more options, why you have to glitch things to build not 90 or 180 degree walls and stack basic things like foundations?
---
"totally unfair in PVP since foundations can't be destroyed, this is getting nerfed"- BGS community manager 
---
They‚Äôve actually blatantly lied about fixing bugs in the past. I‚Äôm not surprised they‚Äôre still doing it.
---
I have one it works the same as rest you load 4 into it ot shoots one then you can shoot another its very meh! 
---
It's never going to be enough, I made a post about the psychology behind why it will never be enough, and I remember saying that all these posts would arrive. 
---
And thats why we have melee weapons ;D
---
I‚Äôve literally had to move my camp 3 times today.  I‚Äôve been killed 6 times today.  I never fight back.
---
That changes when you sink hundreds or thousands of rounds into a single queen.
---
I would just imagine the animation for crossbows would be odd. Just another bolt just appears after shooting one lol. 
---
If it was the PVP or people abusing them, discontinuing stacking of bobble heads, magazines, and chems then making where if you are in passive mode you get no damage delt to you and your base can't be destroyed. To counter any attempt at abuse you can only switch from passive mode like every 5 mins? I think that would have been fair vs taking out gun play all together.
---
I spent 3 minutes straight waiting for 3 scorchbeasts to stop spamming me with their glitched attacks. I used just over 400 stimpaks, a lot o healing salve and over a thousand 5.56. I couldn‚Äôt see the entire time because there was never more than half a second when my screen wasn‚Äôt filled with their bright sonic attacks and I couldn‚Äôt aim anyway because of the insane screen shaking. Couldn‚Äôt sprint cause I was overweight since they broke half my excavator gear.
---
Just Like a pirate lol
---
If you power up Poseidon enough you'll be fusion plant plans. Think it was another time there that I got plans to craft fusion cores. But with power user perk I have yet to ever run out of them.
---
Not anymore, this is something actually WAS fixed.
---
Yh that‚Äôs what I do, or I give the plans to newer players
---
Plus Idk where it was from (I think defending a workshop?) but I got the signs and letters plans for free
---
honestly the only times i see the competent youtubers I watch report on FO 76 it's usually cause BGS fucks up wich it seems has been every patch, which is weekly, so thus you see a lot of weekly videos on why this game is not building on its low expectation but sometimes regressing back to worse states. but yeah keep shouting into the air bud 
---
In Fallout 4 you could use Overdrive to get crits outside of vats. In 76 it increases crit damage. Im pretty sure before it was changed it let you crit outside of vats in 76, I mostly used a 1\* 2shot prime 10mm smg and overdrive for early queen kills. Would love to see this as a feature again.
---
Agility is already good enough imo. More AP is good enough.
---
You guys and gals are the authority on morality. Do what ya wanna.
---
Yh it does after you shoot theres just another one already loaded its handy but not all that helpful the fire rate is still slow
---
If you're relogging, you aren't waiting long enough. The game eventually loads in. If you do open your pip boy in that time, yes, you will be unable to do anything, but only until it loads, which is usually about 30 seconds. 
---
Best way to ensure you have no issues on login is to go into third person, crouch, and pull out your weapon and wait. Being in sneak will alert you to enemies who can see you that you can't see. The Caution indicator is useful. Once the enemy models load in, you may open your pip boy problem free. 
---
Loot the dozens of power armor spawns that exist in the world.  Each one spawns with a fusion core.  
---
feels like bethesda have already taken all the fun out of the queen with all this, i get it that they have priorities with all the stability and balance updates and they‚Äôre working on dlcs and such but if they only fixed the queen‚Äôs loot selection (which shouldnt be that hard or time consuming) a lot of high level player would be happier
---
"Entitled." Fucking lol. The game is shit. Shit games get shat on. It's been that way since forever.
---
Sounds like a deal. I could use a grenade or two. Yknow, the ones that vanish and take up invisible inventory space. 
---
When i read the title i was expecting a Deathclaw inspired power armor set for us. I guess that works too /shrug
---
In fallout 4 you would miss sometimes with 95% accuracy if there was something close to in your way, like if you were peeking over a wall or from behind a tree. It‚Äôs like there was a few cm of invisible solidness on most objects. Skyrim too.
---
I dont like my account name being out there and hearing all the rumors of zero account recovery tools.
---
My last encounter with the mothman, I was like level 35 or something, and he was listed as a ‚Äúvengeful mothman.‚Äù It was one hell of a fight. I‚Äôm 97 now and haven‚Äôt seen him once outside the event quest. Maybe I‚Äôll shoot him next time and see what happens. 
---
How can u hide ur arch? I have a concrete patio with stairs to my main building.  It won't let me put it anywhere except on the ground.  I can't figure out how to cover it and maintain a mobile base design. Unless I store it until I use it.
---
Oh shit yeah that‚Äôs a point, I never bother with queens because you never get anything 
---
&gt; I'm not switching to Heavy Combat until I find Deep Pocketed mods for it all.
---
Good luck with that.  :(
---
Take a look at the trading Discord, I'm sure people would sell you concrete and wood in less than 3 minutes!
---
I think it‚Äôs worse in 76 not bashing the game but my shotty that was putting in work to the enemies at my level rn it just like.. stopped  once I got to their level. I should be getting stronger as I level up right? Even if that isn‚Äôt the case it doesn‚Äôt make sense why @ level 19 I was beastin on level 23 guys but now that I‚Äôm level 25 this same shotgun has trouble on level 20 guys. What? 
---
Also the thirst &amp; hunger aspects are still a little wacko definitely not as bad/hard as it was in New Vegas( jeeeeeeez) and every other game it‚Äôs been implemented in afterwards but it still needs to be rebalanced no reason why this dude should be hungry AGAIN after I just fed this clown like where the heck does this stuff go for you are you even eating?!
---
There's a video series on different nuke zones in a lot of the map of 76, Results were basically White Springs for XP legendary farming and SQB for plans. Honestly the developers fucked up and should have realized that ghoul hordes every place you nuke on top of special bosses in certain area would prolong the life of the game for the simple fact in change in location.
---
Too bad they mess up the DR when you're in PA. Same with Marine underarmor, right?
---
Have they said anything at all about that bug?
---
Speaking of clothing and bugs, have they said anything ever about fixing all the clipping errors?
---
&gt; Deep Pocketed BOS Heavy Combat Armor Torso.
---
Where did you get the plan or mod for that?
---
I thought it was half.  Anyway I‚Äôm still murdered at least once a day by some random psycho.  Seriously minding my own business.  Murdered twice today at two different camp locations and once at a third.  Not sure why I‚Äôm the target of these weirdos.  
---
Sometimes people familiar with the actual towns on the map will nuke a city just because they hate there. But that's also not very productive. I could see some other spot as worthwhile to maybe farm radiated plants and materials. Not sure what might be a good spot though.
---
Equip perks, stash your food and junk and ammo, unequip, profit. 
---
The game doesn‚Äôt fully load all the time.  So you sometimes need to give it a while to.
---
But sometimes it‚Äôs 30-60 seconds before everything around you appears properly. 
---
Except those vendors don't actually sell those plans, which was confirmed with the last patch where \*all\* plans that a vendor could possibly sell are now always available. Those vendors still do not have those plans. You likely just were very lucky and got them from that daily but didn't notice.
---
overseer's camp stash box or Sutton station cigarette machine are my go to drop sites for low level stuff and plans. Ice cooler at the golf club for junk legendary drops, or brown paper bag on the floor in the bench area of the hotel.
---
You don‚Äôt want to craft them. Requires a bunch of flux. 
---
A level 50 rifle shouldn't require 10 point blank hits to kill a level 32 Scorched, especially when you're a level 55 player.  Don't these levels mean anything or is the whole thing just random and badly done?
---
It is a shit game by triple A standards. An Indy developer could‚Äôve done a better job. 
---
My issue is not specifically with shit games; it‚Äôs with youtubers exploiting shit games by making literally the same video every day with different wording and branding it as a ‚Äònew‚Äô video while grabbing cash through views. 
---
Its possible to spawn-in a few seconds before the enemies are visibly spawned to you -- they're there you just can't see them. And they can kill you.
---
&gt; increase strength via under-armor
---
Can you elaborate? If I am in Powerarmor my armor is taken off no?
---
I disagree with the ammo, because they are not that heavy so it's alright to store them (without their weapon). I didn't use shotgun and fusion cells since beta so I stashed respectively 4000 and 5000, which allowed me recently to sell the shotgun shells and start playing with a Tesla rifle. 
---
Noob. Then stay the hell out of PvP zones if you don't want to fight other players. Workshops belong to whoever is strong enough to hold them. They are PvP zones. People like you just want PvP removed from the game, or to punish people who participate so bad that they never want to again. Well bad news for you, that isn't Bethesda's vision for this game. And I LOVE PvP, I can't wait till PvP servers come along, except people like you are trying to dictate how that will be done as well... Smh.
---
Imho it's quite simple the weapon/enemy balance is totally broken
---
Harpers Ferry is fun nuked 
---
&gt;Just stop
---
Or you can make your own videos showing all the fun to be had in '76.
---
They really should have separate servers for PvE and PvP. I'm sick of dealing with these idiots.  Put them all on the same server and let them grief each other until they get sick of it and go back to playing Fortnite. 
---
I agree but enemies are doing to much dmg already they should increase it they should increase the out coming dmg all rifles should do more dmg 
---
Learn to fucking read.
---
Bro I used to come UP from cigarette packs and cartons YES! Get to this game and I‚Äôm hording packs and cartons to sell later I get to the vendor and this dude isn‚Äôt giving me shit. What happened?! Now I don‚Äôt sell anything everything just gets scrapped and used ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
hey there, about the search-not-working bug, I have a temporary solution. I don't know why it works, but it just does :P When a cap-stash container is un-searchable, move 10-20 feet away from it and move back. Then you can search it :P Again: no idea why this works, but thankfully it does. Enjoy your extra caps as intended! (Y)
---
Yeah it sucks, but its the only semblance of "endgame" we have.
---
i will try that. 
---
Thanks for the tip
---
I gotta empty at least a magazine into this guy with my, you know, fucking energy weapon that shoots projectiles at literally the speed of sound times 5
---
absurd.
---
It boggles my mind that the fissure sites are that bad. It's like core to the central story of the game.
---
I guess it plays into that whole narrative of this game shipping WAY too early. Maybe they never got around to sorting out the other fissure sites.
---
Also, I can't for the life of me farm cobolt flux at the two popular nuke sites. I think I found it once at Whitesprings and that was it.
---
Jus u

The Rifle Gaming one? I've been keeping an eye on it. 
---
Like the science that he's doing but looks like he keeps pretty much running dry for the most part.
---
Do not need a recon scope, there is optional objective just to kill the targets yourself.   I do this all the time with handmade.
---
Oi!
---
then u insta die when they spawn right in ur face
---
I gave away a Clean Space Helmet to a random person I saw wearing the dirty Spacesuit. I was like I don't need this in the back of my mind "Find Clean Spacesuit".
---
Yeah i'm not sure of the handle of the guy i watched a couple vids he kinda makes em longer then needed to basically say no Bethesda did not hide a secret boss here, I've written off any other video since NOWHERE will be good as white springs since the way the spawn system works and the size of the blast radius.
---
The accuracy of this is almost cringeworthy smh
---
I don't know what happened but someone called my character name once in the mic. I was shocked! But all I see are people's PSN name.
---
It's rare as hell from mire events
---
Do you have any proof other than "i said so"?
---
had a drifters outfit.  sold it for "clean"  my ass, steel worker outfit.  want drifter back, have yet to see it again.
---
No, it's just a shit game all around. By AAA standards, by indie standards, by AA standards, 76 is a dumpster-fire. It was one of the worst games released in 2018.
---
yeah, how about no. Bethesda have screwed themselves. They dug this grave themselves, they can lay in it far as I'm concerned. 
---
And if you've been following the YT scene of 76, you'd realise that it's not the same video. Bethesda always manages to find new and ingenuous ways to fuck the game or fuck the customer. Or both at the same time. Hell, a Youtuber I watch by the name of Rags released a 76 review 2 weeks ago. It is 2 and a half hours long. 2 and a half hours of him going over every nook and cranny of how fundamentally flawed the game is. So no. it's not just the same video over and over again.
---
Just go look at their website. The FO76 bundle is $399, same price as a new XBox. 
---
You can find five to seven cores in Watoga alone, if you're lucky.
---
was going to, but i walked away and the asshat attacked me......no mercy.
---
&gt; I had a vendor issue yesterday where Harpers Ferry bot and Grahm shared inventory

Harper's and Grahm have *always* shared their caps.

That doesn't mean anything.

What  the hell did you done !? Some damn Axe do more damage then legendary  gauss rifle !!! WTF? Return damage states to legendary weapon !

Somehow +3 endurance doesn't affect your hp. Better use Enclave's under-armor which gives you +3 strength.

If you're on PS4 i can sell you one

Did you honestly think people weren't going to bash this post you're wrong go bitch somewhere else
---
That‚Äôs just if you‚Äôre doing distant thunder.

There‚Äôs other quest, like the miss nanny in the black mountain ordnance area that need it.

He never dies.  You're confusing patrol duty (in the prison) with back on the beat (in Morganstown).

Oh shit I‚Äôve been doing the wrong one lmao
---
PvP should be COMPLETELY disabled in "adventure" mode.
---
And I should be able to fold my camp back into its case for free each time I go away, then open it up in the same location for free when I return.
---
Triple damage cazadores from NV....
---
That's fucked. Where was your camp? 
---
Isn't server hopping easier than moving your camp? I think it's OK to server hop because of these assholes.

Heavy Combat Torso plan from Watoga (after patch).
---
Deep Pocketed Combat Armor Torso mod plan from Welch (pre patch)
---
BOS Combat Armor Torso mod plan was also pre patch.  I think from Welch but I don‚Äôt remember too much as it was a while ago.  
---
My first time in the mire I was low 40‚Äôs and got sneaked up on by a wendigo. Easily the creepiest moment I‚Äôve dealt with in the game. That and surprise attacks by the mothman at night. 
---
I get immersed in videogames  plenty. I don't get scared of them though. You're points are all valid but I'm a grown ass man and playing a game like Fallout which is practically a cartoon, is not scary. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Far Harbor shower that could be rigged to provide extra rads or cure them.
---
You got 150 hours out of it calm down and take a break Jesus 
---
Never sold or trashed any outfit/headwear. I mean it was clear at the start this would be a multiplayer game. And what ist the main endgame for any multiplayer (esp. those who only sell "cosmetic" stuff in their store)? Yeah... It's the looks. So it am hoarding every single piece ot apparel that i can find in Appalachia. From beta on.
---
Yeah this is one thing that REALLY bothers me, like why on earth is everything and anything out to see my camp leveled to the ground? Why are a pack of wolves intent on destroying my fence, or ghouls relentlessly attacking my workshop walls? What the hell is the reason for it. Ruins any sense of immersion entirely.
---
It's especially annoying when you don't get notified of attacks. Then you have turrets at level 15 that don't scale level trying to take down an angry level 50 deathclaw. 
---
Even worse is the turret targeting, could have a few super mutants just standing on the edge of your camp taking pot shots at your extractor and generator while your turrets scan the surroundings like nothing is going on. 
---
Honestly you're playing the game wrong if you're having a hard time killing super mutants. 
---
Lvl 41 here farming lvl 68's when I'm in power armor. 
---
What would happen to a pre launch behemoth?. You know it be interesting if we could lead certain enemies to certain a areas. Just imagine a group leading a behemoth to fissure site prime then nuking it and having to fight both(SBQ and behemoth) of them as they are fighting each other.
---
How did you include link in OP?  I got a notice it was blacklisted when I tried to link. 
---
So wanted players can just retreat inside someone else's houses?
---
What about workshops? If you can't destroy my stuff, instead of locking doors I'd just place a bunch of furniture in front of the entrances / workstation. 
---
For the overseer issue it will finish, you must have her logs from all three launch sites and then launch a nuke at anyplace that isn‚Äôt a fissure site. Go back down the elevator and you will see her tape in the box saying how she is disappointed.
---
Just download some mods and add them to fallout76 4HEAD
---
Pretty sure player vending was shown as a CAMP buildable item in one of the videos pre-release. It's been months, not weeks
---
I like the way scorched heads ‚Äúpop‚Äù off and roll around when I snipe them...
---
No clue. I just did it.
---
So you RP an asshole.  Got it
---
You don't pvp now? why?
---
Yes, your experience with the responder bot was due to your own ignorance. By you saying that a responder uniform is required is misleading people, whether you think it is or not doesn't change that fact.
---
It just works
---
It is only that way because you aren't going over to see them.
---
I believe cobalt flux is that blue stuff on trees. If you nuke the fissure site at the bottom of the map in the middle left of prime that is a good area t ok farm cobalt. Heavily wooded areas.
---
Level 77 with 300 hours?  Something is not adding up there.   
---
I am level 129 and have 246 hours.  I do not farm Whitesprings either, not fun for me.
---
I have stealth Rank 3, Escape Artist, Ammo armor, camo mutation (not really used).   
---
Anyway, SB cannot even flag me "Cautious" if I am not moving and its just flying right overhead.  I can usually shoot it once, go into cautious, and it still cannot find me.  It usually lands right in front of me and I can knock half its life away before going into "Danger".  This was yesterday (post patch) in front of the Hopewell Cave.   Yes there are problems with Stealth, but it does work (most of the time).
---
If you are hiding without the "Stealth" perk, don't expect to hide from end game mobs.
---
10-15 rounds into an enemy?  I just got a crafted handmade and can down most glowies 1-3 shots in the head (non stealth).  With Stealth, its pretty much 1 shot all.  So your saying the TSE does less damage than a crafted gun?  I doubt that seriously.
---
Flux weights 1lbs,  scorchbeast queen hunters are throwing it away.

People on this board on both sides are fucking stupid and narrow minded.
---
It comes back to youtuber greed, and isn‚Äôt limited to fallout 76 but gaming news related as a whole. The click baiters are a cancer in themselves.
---
Same.
---
I don't PVP because I don't feel like harassing people doing quests if someone attacks me its on I just dislike looking for a fight cause next thing you know my GT is on R/fo76filthycasual for being a griefer. I like the idea of PVP only servers and trying to level and loot since i am a console Pleb and cannot play rust
---
Hot take : 
---
Getting bored 150 hours into any game means it's a pretty decent game. 
---
I'd be pretty happy to be you and have the time to play that much while also being compelled to play that much. 
---
I hit vault tec academy for xp grind since whitesprings got nerfed.
---
Blah blah blah heard it all before go to other fallout board 
---
Probably because old paints had lead in them, but something like .50 cal doing low damage compared to others? Now THAT doesn't make sense.
---
The only thing I find hard to believe in all of that, is that you have a girlfriend. 
---
Just move your base 3 inches, costs what 40 caps but repairs everything without the need for specific resources. You are welcome.
---
150 hours? Lol that's my level not time played 
---
Well shit. I didn't know that I was posting a rumor or a leak when I pointed out an advertised sale.
---
WRONG way f ing WRONG. It's called farming for key codes.
---
My bad then - I guess unique doesn‚Äôt mean unique in this case.  Thanks for clarification!
---
[Here is edited run.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw58NzHaI0g) Also there is older video that is only speed up on my channel. I am not here for likes. haha kidding :(
---
 Understandable* 
---
450 is not laughable levels.  1500 dmg is laughable levels.
---
I have Two Shot The Dragon 3 star and it does 398 dmg.  Reload time on that beast is like watching commercial.  Gauss with 450 dmg? Overpowered still.
---
That's actually how it was in Fallout 4. You would see it in console commands by typing player.additem 000731a4 100 for 100 steel. Here are the base ID's for the others (which are akin to bulk):
---
001ec132 (shipment of 50)
---
001ec131 (shipment of 100)
---
0024a067 (shipment of 250)
---
there is already a fire based legendary effect on the (Named) legendary "Perfect Storm"
---
unsure if it can be found on other weapons currently
---
I gotta start spending more time at workshops. Do bring some junk with you though. 
---
LMAO it just does it JUST BARELY does.....
---
&lt;3
---
Their is 3 sets of power armor in watoga (school roof and centre near the vertibird and behind the lvl 3 locked door in the transport services building) they are still farmable and their is also a chance of one in the generator behind the lvl 3 door.
---
Blah blahbbakh Bethesda bad etc etc we heard it all before quit and go play something else 
---
Feelsbad I‚Äôm Xbox :/ 
---
If you've used console commands, you know that each item is not tracked individually. 
---
At Watoga or at Welch I just run out and kite in a bunch of robots or mole miners and just run a ways away and listen to the mayhem.  Doesn‚Äôt always work, but for when it does I keep some popcorn close by...
---
Or find the Mothman handing on to the top of a pole.
---
Girls like assholes, now the question is, do you have girlfriend?
---
I think one of those actually gave me a recon rifle though.
---
Was at Welch yesterday and he didn't have the torso mod plans.  Didn't Bethesda make those lists fixed?  If so then it may no longer be available from vendors.
---
Thanks for the info, though.  My quest continues...
---
Go home u/Jetstar4, you're drunk
---
Dont rush your levels bc the game will get stale real quick.
---
Hunter/hunted radio, i am waiting on it for you. Also you can PvP on workshops, or go bounty hunting.
---
OK thanks I'll check that out
---
Another thread where a hardcore 300 hour+ player got bored. 
---
Wow what a surprise. 
---
rofl..... Pls don't do videos that make a shitty game look bad. Pls stahp making money. It's not a good look. It's not a good look to release a shitty game like this and Bethesda needs to be reminded of that daily. If you don't like it, don't watch it. You call them entitled yet you DEMAND they stop making videos. Are you high? Again, if you already know the information, just don't watch the videos?????? Really easy solution.
---
Wish I could be so lucky to have them throw away stable flux.  Sure they‚Äôre not tossing raw flux?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snPDc-Oiolc
---
I'll have a look there thanks.
---
Invest in the proper perks that allow you to loot more caps and '' search '' containers for them, as well as knowing the spawn locations of the caps stashes (exit your current world when collected to join a new server where they haven't been picked up yet) 
---
I whole heartedly doubt that a pipe pistol weighs 15 pounds.
---
You can decide them yourself, or nukabreaker website
---
Oh. Wait I see. You didn‚Äôt link to Gamestop. 
---
Ok, but you better have some caps for me too, cause i need to pay for fast travel and then claiming workshop to trigger pvp. 
---
no the question is, what sort of pay rate does your work on.
---
And if you have done the mayor for a day quest the robots won't be hostile and will actually keep you safe whilst you do you rounds.
---
Is that it?
---
Maybe the bans are a timed punishment and will be unbanned in time. It doesn't seem like they will look into an account and take things on a case by case basis. 
---
And hoard meds / weapons / armor that you can resell at vendors as well as better bartering price perks
---
Yeah I suppose some girls do like assholes to be honest..... But no... I don't have a girlfriend..... I'm unlucky enough to have a wife.
---
No one uses hunted, again the workshop pvp is kinda killbox for one end so its not like stalking someone in the woods, Honeslty stopped playing a week before RE2 remake came out. Figured I'll sink my time in that and Metro, PVP Beta drops they work out the kinks, I get my route for the eventual character wipe to be able to play that server and go from there. 
---
Lol. That was the joke. Even when working properly, the head will be unlimited ammo, so what‚Äôs the point of quad?
---
It‚Äôs not limited to Bethesda or fallout. 
---
I'm going through the motions with tech support.  Fingers crossed.
---
Events mostly.
---
No i am selling stable flux to vendors if i dont want to waste time getting it on my mule. Also i hate when i have 400 ultracite. That weight is insane.
---
Yup I'm home and yeah just woke up and yes I'm still drunk!
---
My existence that ammo isnt rare at all... Theres just so many types that you would need to have lots of guns to take advantage of it, and that's once again where the weight issues become a problem. This could be fixed by making ammo more generic, so that all ammo works in multiple gun types.
---
I'm actually looking forward to it and I'm not one to pvp (unless people start on me, but even then I need to be in the mood to retaliate).
---
What I'm interested in seeing is how the normal servers will be. Will all those seeking pvp vanish to the pvp servers and leave us peaceful types be? Or will it remain status quo in them?
---
I had a mod on NV that made headshots on humanoids an instant kill without some sort of helmet. Worked on my character too, and was super immersive.
---
I can potentially make 2800 caps every day just by vendoring on my 2 characters. Then killing Super Mutants at "The Top of the World" or "Harpers Ferry" can net like 10 caps a super mutant. You could also farm cap stashes and get a potenail 300 per with all the right perks. 
---
So what? If a developer or publisher fucks up, youtubers SHOULD report on it. If you don't agree then don't watch them. How much more entitled can you be to DEMAND them not to make videos which are their livelihood just because you don't want to watch them? I mean, would you stop working to provide for your family because some random person demands that you stop doing it because he/she is bothered by it? I mean think for fuck's sake. 
---
Yeah. I linked to Gamestop's article advertising the sale. Sad to see the half the article from Gamestop explains how horrible the launch has been with all the bugs and how low a score the game received. Almost as if they are trying to justify giving the game away.
---
After patch, when first player join hunter/hunted it anounce for all players on server, so sometimes it actualy starts.
---
Workshop pvp is about tactic.
---
[What ever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN0hbQALkag)
---
I grab workshops knowing they are PVP zones.  I do them for the caps, XP, plans, and fast travel spawn points.   I don‚Äôt care for the PVP and someone can have it if they really want it, lol.  
---
I don‚Äôt usually setup extractors, blah blah, once it realized that anything I put down will stay after you lose it. I DO put down at least a stash box and usually a crafting station if there isn‚Äôt one already there, for the wayward traveler.
---
I think I‚Äôve been attacked maybe once?  Hmmm. Just realized it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt grab the desirable ones.  Red Rocket is hot, so... nope.
---
Even though I don‚Äôt PVP, I think it‚Äôs an interesting mechanic (no pun intended, lol) and fine as is.  Fight on, gang!
---
You ready to die for your country you coMMIE SON OF A BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH?!
---
Clothes you pick up from places are worth money...golf clothes are like 25 caps each to vendors. Heavy guns usually sell for 50 caps. Drugs are easy to come by and usually worth 8-10 caps each. Adhesive farms at your camp. Bulk adhesive is 20 caps each. 
---
Thats gonna be the fun part i think PVP servers could potentially become more popular if they make new characters mandatory since dupers and what not, then since getting killed cost caps plans will still be hard to come by. We will see how this pans out but judging from the past we can only guess the future sadly
---
Not that I've noticed, turrets seem stopped cold by them for example.  To my knowledge foundations, floors, and stairs are invulnerable objects, thus could be used to make inaccessible locations if you used floor for roof.
---
This is 100000% my point. 
---
[I fucking hate camel crickets](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtY1z6rDD2L/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=116vgxz98ylks)
---
Shit!  Next time you want to offload some let me know. I‚Äôve been buying the flux I need and farming the UC. Always running out of violet. 
---
Haha. Good for you. Give my best regards to her :D
---
It's nice to find someone who can disagree without being disagreeable. One of the biggest issues (for me) is having to play in 3rd person mode on RDR2. I've never been very good at that view. But the game is stellar and if they every come out with PVE servers then I'll be all over it.
---
Not tryna argue but i think open PVP on the map is gonna add some kinda depth especially for newbies or new Characters
---
If pvp servers only house 24 people it'll be doomed from the start. 
---
How long do you think it takes to reload ?
---
Then one of us has dyslexia because I see a link to GameSpot not GameStop. 
---
Just sell everything, what the queen scorchbeast drops, you‚Äôll get to 25k in no time.
---
You can make 1400/day off vendors. And I used to make about 500/day using "Fortune Finder" and "Cap Collector." Not sure if that's still possible -- the patch changed cap stashes because of some "exploit" I've never heard of.
---
üëç
---
It could be summarized pretty short: rewards in the game suck like Dyson. 
---
Whitesprings is pretty much the only locations worth farming. 
---
They deteriorate too fast, thats true, but it is in no way a new mechanic in an online game, so make it slower and its all good.  
---
And FO3 had it too.
---
People screamed when FO4 didn't include this feature. 
---
Not disagreeing with your point, Bethesda is a scum brand, Todd Howard is a fucking thief. 
---
Making videos is a side project at best, not a real job, sorry mate. 
---
Yeah big map but there are hot spots where "raiders" "Griefers" will congregate at shops and all so it will be different and i already see the strategies of just waiting at a store in chameleon 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Unless this changed in one of the recent updates, your friends can‚Äôt fast travel to your workshop unless you go there and they fast travel to you.
---
"I demand PROOF!!!!"
---
What? Where do you live? On Mars? There are literally thousands living off youtube lol..... sorry mate. 
---
Vendors are a nice steady stream of 1400/day but selling to other players has been more profitable if I‚Äôm on for a while. I‚Äôd pick up harder to find plans (before the price change) and resell them. For example, brick set was 398c iirc and I could flip it for 700.  I got an X01 jet pack from Modus once and flipped it for 4k. 
---
There are about half-a-dozen accounts on here who respond to every negative post with demands for proof. As if there's some giant conspiracy to ruin their fun.
---
Pretty sure that's a bug. Had it happen to me, but if I walked close he would try to melee me
---
4 is the only modern Fallout where you don't have repair stuff and it was silly, because there has to be a feeling of survival and this is one of the things that make it. 
---
I hated it that 4 did not have it. It made non survival mode just a shooter with vats. The atmosphere were really off in that game.
---
I'll have to look again. I've tried on 3 runs in that area and come up with literally nothing.
---
Little wooded areas around prime were only good for violet flux. Primarily crimon/violet for prime and yellowcake/fluorescent for Whitesprings has been my experience to date. 
---
That exploit fix was basically making cap stashes into containers. That way a player couldn't loot the cap stash in let's say the wendigo cave, but his buddy couldn't. Now it's an instanced container.
---
Solid career. That‚Äôs one to tell the grandchildren about 
---
Get scorchbeast queen hunting group. If you know how, you can do silo in 7minutes and then kill queen in 8mins. Thats 200caps every 15mins. Also for every silo you complete you get 100caps.
---
Wanting to store different load outs has caused me to be close to max weight. At high levels you can try different builds due to having so many perk cards. 
---
Which is why I mentioned pre patch.   I have not seen. BOS or Deep Pocketed mod plans at any vendor since patch.  
---
Git gut
---
I respect that.  Being a filthy casual myself, I don‚Äôt pvp, but I also understand some folks do...which is why I don‚Äôt claim workshops.
---
And yet someone managed to kill me with a few shots depending on how they've built their character and what they use. 
---
3k caps!
---
I like how you have to repair your equipment 
---
Adds another layer of excitement of the game 
---
I‚Äôm not selling it.
---
It varies, at low level sure but later in the game with perks and a decent gun.. nothing is more than one shot except the level 68 glowing ones that take 2 or 3 shots or SB. I'm a fan of survival though too, current game is in either normal or easy. It would be nice to choose your server difficulty. Also mob scaling like people say happens, haha. I go up against level 10s all the time as 70+.
---
you are just being a prick at this point
---
Which events are good for caps?
---
I don‚Äôt blame you workshops are easy since they have to stay in a killbox so just get the Grenade angle down when you spawn and shouldn‚Äôt be an issue I think when they fully implement PVP servers with complete character wipe to play the game is gonna get twitch views which drives people wanting to try the game 
---
Indeed. They make more than you ever will.
---
They said it's to prevent players from trapping other players inside their camp. But it doesn't work out since **a)** if someone wants to trap other players, they usually see about killing them fast with flamethrowers/turrents/what have you before you have a chance to get out and **b)** you can always server hop to get out, duh. That's why I wholeheartedly support the idea to make camps indestructible by other players on adventure and/or if they play on pacifist.
---
Get rid of the damn shotgun. 
---
Youtubers that have valid videos get the stamp of approval and there are a few. The rest should get jobs and stop polluting the internet with trash content.
---
But sir I was forced to watch it. Sounds like a no job lives at mommy's basement at 35 yrs old am I right?
---
That would be cool. And then you have to do vendor quests for the spoiled whitesprings robots. Like fetching them teddy bears, and other "rare" items. 
---
I am doing any i see in the bog, but most profitable would be monster mash cause of sheer amount of ghouls you have to fight which all have a chance to drop some caps. 
---
Good work. 
---
Doesn't work if you build your camp to fit the landscape. The stored blueprint pretty much never goes back in the same spot.
---
I am gonna say no change at all.  You can't grief players that are willing to accept danger, and assholes will be assholes.
---
Indeed they do. And I will continue putting shit on them whenever I please.
---
Definitely saw that yesterday. No me gusta. 
---
It brings realism for sure, i hated it at first. But u kind of get used to it. Just wish we could repair whenever to 200% 
---
Gratz dude! Hope it is still somewhat useful.
---
I think I've never had a legendary handmade drop ever, not any kind. Bought my best weapon, lvl 35 two shot handmade from some vendor and I think it's the best weapon for me SINCE BETA, so my luck is really grim.
---
Got one 3-star lever action furious, explosive and some vats thingy as only real award, and I've played a lot
---
Thank you good sir. You don't need to give me any food, i wouldn't be able to harm such a pure soul.
---
I'm sure they care about your approval
---
THOUSANDS every day is not easy. You can get a maximum of 1400 caps per day from selling to vendors, by draining all seven factions of each their 200 caps.
---
I admit I have to pick up an alt just to store my outfits.... not armor, plain outfits. I like to roleplay in my head. Like rn I wear my responders jumpsuit and throw stimpacks, radaway, and food on bags for people. Or just run support.
---
Lol....it's not you.
---
Bro get a fucking life. Awww poor baby let me tell juicehead and r5dimpact to stop making money for their families so they can be just like you on public assistance and welfare. 
---
"YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH!"
---
Wut? you fast travel for 40caps to get 20-40caps. Where is the profit? And i get downvoted :D :D ah yeah! i was missing this website, please mods, don't ban me again!
---
Sell the legendary stuff you want to players. Even some bad one star things can get you 500 caps. Or you could just pick up all the high radiation fluids, hardened mass, glowing mass, glowing blood, glowing meat, ionized meat, and flux from nuc zones and sell that.
---
I'm still afraid of the Mire. So creepy. Hate those bullet sponge gulpers as well.
---
Whatever floats your boat.
---
Cause i fast travel for 5? I spam bog events. Money adds up very quickly. 
---
I'd like this confirmed as well
---
Not near prime. It's under Charlie silo I believe. 
---
I saw Grafton (and north) nuked. It worked out okay since there's violet flux there (unlike Whitespring). 
---
Finally got down there to check. NOT ONLY did your man have the Spinning Wheel, but also ANTIQUE LIGHTS. That was my other white whale!
---
The players: We want quality of life improvements and more pve boss fights!
---
Bethesda: Quality of life nerfs and PVP are coming, we hear you loud and clear!
---
Oh sure, with the wonderful "balance" we've got now PVP will be highly enjoyable.
---
Problem there is I cant seem to get my character up to par with a nuke zone. I enter, and get swamped by ghouls. I NOW have a weapon that'll help, but for the passed couple weeks my character cant even go into the white springs REGULARLY without getting glomped on by 10-15 LVL 65 Charred Bloated Ferals, backed up by a Charred Bloated GLOWING Feral.
---
build it on a ground foundation. Let the height be 1 wall and a half. Done.
---
Everyone's retarded but you. We got that by now.
---
Preach. BGS should introduce a purely pacifist server along with the survival one. Let the griefers throw temper tantrums for all I care. They deserve to be on the receiving end if they think that bulldozing someone else's camp is "fun".
---
I like it but in NV not this game. They just did it here to make everything tedious it seems, like everything else.
---
I think that player vending could fix this up a bit also- I‚Äôve acquired a lot of ammo that I don‚Äôt use, but I‚Äôm sure someone does. I‚Äôd gladly exchange .50 for .44
---
Maybe he has a turret camp outside whitespring.  Or a camp outside Charleston vendor.
---
Or he‚Äôs claiming sought after workshops.  
---
Reading reddit you would think griefing and unprovoked PVP were much more rampant than they actually are.
---
It‚Äôs rare for me to see a wanted on the same server as me.  And when I do it‚Äôs usually a low level who did something they didn‚Äôt know was wrong like try to pick a supply drop.  
---
My gun breaks way too fast now. Even though the Gunsmith perk is still 5 stars, I've noticed all my guns breaking really quick. I also have them all repaired to 2 times condition, it still doesn't help. In the heat of battle I suddenly find myself unarmed and helpless, unless I carry extra guns, and they weigh too much to carry. There needs to be a different balance. I have 12 strength and use them all for weight reduction....I'm a rifle shotgun build, which means my shotgun is next to useless! I've also got Stealth Boy T60, which takes AP when you crouch, so if I'm overweight, my AP constantly drains and I'm no longer stealthy! So my whole build is now useless. After reaching level 145 and respecing to be this way, I now find I have to rethink it all over again. Not fun in my opinion.
---
The majority of it is shopping, even with the 200 cap limit.
---
Events if I happen to be nearby but usually there's diminishing returns if you fast travel to one.
---
Third. Started with New Vegas a couple years before Fallout 4
---
They've removed some of them also. And I've read a lot of reports of attempts to loot using the same perks I mentioned and getting 1 cap.
---
Hey asshole people make more fucking money then you with a single video. Dont be upset you're broke af and hating on peo p.k le with jobs. Fyi most youtubers are with a company that pay them as well as sponsors so how about you put your big boy pants on and sfu.
---
Where is the mini nuke?
---
PVP earns heaps caps. Store all of your junk before pvp
---
No the main thing I dislike about the quest is that THERE ARE NO FUCKING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD! Bro do you know how repetitive, uninteresting and lame it is to keep having to ‚Äúinitiate‚Äù alllll the time at a terminal. I‚Äôm so sick of talking to robots it‚Äôs insane and I love the idea of an android apocalypse lol but this, this is too much. I just completed the fire breathers questline yesterday with friends only because one of my friends knew all the answers and gave me them off rip. When I first came across the fire station and got on the terminal and seen the same ‚Äúoh become an initiate‚Äù bull I got mad and so I left. It made me think like who tf thought this stuff was gonna be a BLAST when they made this? I want this to feel like an actual fallout game, like it‚Äôs an actual apocalyptic wasteland with ppl out here just trying to survive and with me roleplaying as whoever I feel.
---
I can still roleplay in this game to some extent but ultimately I don‚Äôt think the fallout name deserves to be attached to this product. This doesnt *feel* like a fallout game it feels like a different entity entirely. 
---
Yea i used to play 2-4 hours a day grinding for legendaries with tse because i dont play games for a challenge, and pretty much stopped playing after the fusion cor fix
---
There are three variates to heavy armor, all have different stats. 
---
I'd love to, but almost nobody on PS4 uses a headset (at least where I'm playing) 
---
With that name, you're asking to get ganged up and repeatedly killed by other players.
---
Why you so obsessed with money bro?
---

Gunpowder needs to be reduced or put to 0 weight I've got like 100 pounds of gunpowder in my stash

My purple-mohawked raider, named ‚ÄúChem Fiend,‚Äù will never have the opportunity to fill the role of a random encounter NPC.

Ok any way to tell them apart ? The ones I‚Äôm using look identical 
---
Why would I do PVP? So I can try to shoot that guy with my shitty 1* Pistol, and he ganks me in one hit with his TSE 3* Shotgun? Nah. The dense armor mod spawns in too rarely in my play. PVP just ain't worth it.
---
The only Fallout that didn't had weapon deterioration was 4, as far as I remember. 
---
What are you specced in? I used to regularly run through white springs when my character was 20-30. I was all melee so the lv 60+ ghouls were no problem. Except for when they rad slap me for 30 rads a hit lol. Had to use the hazmat suit.
---
In inventory or equipped? 
---
Like COD hardcore. Makes it more realistic then dumping a mag and getting nowhere. 
---
If the animations where smooth and they didn‚Äôt just appear in front of you and Also follow you till the ends of the earth,. Also reload times.
---
No. 
---
Yea happened to me twice, and destroyed power armor
---
Turns out studded heavy leather limbs are better overall than BOS heavy Combat limbs.  So I am keeping the deep pocketed leather.  
---
Well yeah you were able to do it at lvl 20-30. Your a melss build. Melee is fucking BROKEN in the game. üòÇ I'm going for a cowboy build in this play through. My last one was a rifle man.
---
The weight is how you tell what version it is.
---
That's because your a piece of shit. You're the fucking problem. Just because your unhappy serving grilled kangaroos doesnt give you the right to shit on others. And those guys are still making more money then you will ever see in your life bc your an angry person and angry people dont get very far and often die prematurely, which also happens to not be soon enough for you.
---
Issue probably on all platforms:
---
Why you  alow us to spawn in a new world INSIDE a nuked zone? when the game still loading the radiation keeps killing you and you cant do nothing as the controls are locked for 30-40 seconds... very anoying especially as if you are on a nuked zone and die the game wont alow you to respawn inside the nuked zone...
---
I bet I could kill you in 1 hit with a bunch of weapons, ranged or melee.
---
Same here.
---
I'm sorry but if you cant kill a lvl 5 super mutant when you are level 30. Clearly the fault lies with you. They should be MAX two shots with a .45 pie revolver rifle.
---
**FOUR** shots to kil it?! what are u doing?? throwing rocks at it?
---
Sorry but u negatively influence the game and I just needed to say this.
---
Why are you obsessed with being a dick and shitting on people.
---
"Line in the Sand" event at the Asylum.. be prepared for waves of scorched and a few Scorchbeasts. The event gave about 2 or 3 each time
---
I really don't understand the trail of downvotes on this chain. People are really made that y'all play the game in a way that optimizes actual play time and limits tedium. This subreddit is ridiculous.
---
But between a min-max tanky-melee build and a bloodied stealth commando build, I'm having loads of fun. I also have a build that suffers from spongey gun shots, but that one was built specifically as a team support build with most their points in charisma.
---
You can net 1400 from vendors a day. If you use the travel agent perk you can cut down on fast travel costs so figure a drop of about 50-75 caps with that perk to make the run depending on where you go. seek and find rare outerwear that you can sell to other players.
---
Before the change to cap stashes you could server hop them. I think at one time there were 17 cap stashes at whitesprings and the roof of Poseidon energy plant had ten or so. With the cap perk you could net a nice haul in an hour of server hopping.
---
Before the last patch mutation plans were much cheaper in the enclave bunker so I snagged some of the popular ones and I've been selling them for 200 caps a pop. The only downside to this route is having to farm flux, particular cobalt and violet.   Crafting with super duper does help with this a good deal.
---
If you have power armor plans you could craft those for lower level players. if you can snag plans for jetpacks and calibrated shocks there is a market for those as well. This may be the next path I go down, haven't decided. 
---
If you are lucky enough to come across the marine wetsuit helmet plan you can make bank crafting those to vendors.  Making them takes 1 glass, 1 rubber, 1 plastic and they go roughly 25 caps a  piece and weight nothing so you can cut down the time it takes to gather stuff to sell.  That's a lot easier than selling of one star armor pieces that weight 3-12 pounds a piece without weight reduction perks.
---
A couple hp is pay to win now. 
---
Another note , survival games if they are for reals shouldn‚Äôt be all in your face about your level and you haven‚Äôt earned that yet,. Also the nerfing of scrap mods. Now I have to invest caps to make a decent rifle. Not very fallout IMHO.
---
No, no you couldn't. 
---
I stand corrected. Sorry folks! But yeah, it does deteriorate too fast. But I have a feeling it's hard for them to control it... I feel like it's more work for them to have to balance it as well as the bugs in regards to the luck perks. Why even have it though? 
---
Bet I could too ;)
---
No armor should blast thru a full set of combat sentinel assassins armor. 
---
I haven't cared for armor and weapon repairs since they came into the gaming world. I have said it before but eventually you reach a poibt of realism in games that the game is no longer fun. I believe the diseases in this game are a prime example of this. I don't care if I have to feed and water my character but when I have to worry about what type of drinks I drink and if they are pyrified or not and if I get a disease what type of cure I have to craft in order to get rid of it. It is a tedious process for me in gaming one that I dont really care for. I plan on having a hunger system in my game but that will be the extent of it. I dont see the need to add weather variations like burning up or freezing to death. I wont be adding breakable weapons and armor in my game and I certainly wont be adding diseases. Granted diseases are easily ignorance in F76 they are more penalty in other games such as DayZ. 
---
I do have the marine wetsuit helmet plan, but I didnt know it was such a lucrative item. I will definitely do that.
---
What about it is messed up? From my back nderstanding underarmor cannot be worn when in PA.
---
Part of me feels like they just do it to prolong players game time so it feels like you're doing more than you really are. 
---
Regardless yeah it's poor design and makes the combat really stale.
---
My psn is mgamble0804 I'd like to put this to the test. 
---
I'll be on in 8 hrs
---
Clean space suit NOT RARE. You can find 2 at the crashed space station.
---
&gt; Then there's the event called "Scorched Earth," the end game boss battle where you kill the scorch beast queen. Considering the amount of resources the quest consumes, the loot from successful completion of the quest is arguably some of the worst in the game. 
---
I think you'd have trouble finding someone who will argue with you. I don't think I've seen anyone say that the loot was awesome or appropriate.
---
Same too with even with the normal SB. I'd rather avoid the fight altogether.
---
And give away our secrets before the pop servers drop?
---
End game DPS&gt;DAM. You won't see 12 people fighting the queen with something high damage, low DPS like the Dragon, but you'll see plenty of high fire rate stuff like heavy weapons. I'm level 320-something and my go to is a bloodied mr handy buzz saw blade. I can get other weapons up to 1500-2200 sheet damage, but they actually pale in comparison to something higher DPS like a combat knife, switch blade, or mr handy buzz saw blade.
---
BOS and Marine underarmor lowers your powerarmors armor values for some reason. Try it out yourself.
---
Take off your underarmor, get in your PA, remember your armor rating.
---
Get out, put on underarmor, and get in your PA again.
---
You'll see how the armor in PA is lower when you have underarmor on.
---
Well it‚Äôs my second character. On the first character I started off using rifles because I figured they would be the same as fallout 4. Then I realized using guns does barely any damage compared to melee unless you had tse. Might as well use it if it works
---
People like you are the reason shit gets nerfed everyday.
---
Hunter/hunted - If you have weapon with 100 damage and you land sneak attack thats 250damage.  Most of players have under 5 endruance = max 300hp. If you know you can oneshot most ppl. 
---
Workshop - if you come to workshop that is someone owning and you press claim, you can immidiatly land shot on them. Find level 200+ that claimed workshop and is still around. Profit 150caps.
---
[Don't be nub like i am.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN0hbQALkag) and PvP will actualy bring you som money.
---
Just because you *can* do something, does not mean that you *should* do something.
---
If I have a hammer in my hand and beat my neighbor to death with it, is it the hammer manufacturer's fault?
---
You don't have to repair weapons in real life. so no, it doesn't bring realism at all. You have to clean weapons, not repair them. Never had a single weapon break before
---
Upvoted. Griefers only call themselves "raiders" so they'll sleep better at night, knowing that they can justify their douchebaggery with roleplay. The way you put it sounds awesome - it promotes consent and interesting roleplay. No one would be at a disadvantage - especially if they don't want to engage in PvP content. PvP was forced on us players who just want to casually play with their friends in the very first Fallout that actually allows it. 
---
Exactly, against an enemy with 10k health and no armor a base minigun with no perks or buffs can chew through it's health in about 26 seconds , while to match that a super sledge needs to hit 16 times at 0.6 attacks per second needs to be dealing 625 damage per swing, which is possible, but much harder to do. The minigun isn't terrible, just terrible against armor in a game where everything has a huge amount of armor.
---
It's all about the perks. 
---
And yes I know they nerfed them but I think the only one I have that they did was white knight. Sure I need 2 or 3 of steel, leather, screws, etc to repair my armor now but so far I have only needed 1 ballistic fiber. 
---
Additionally I have fix it good and weapons artisan maxed so I can repair armor and weapons respectively to 200%. The great thing about those is you only need those active when you're repairing or crafting. 
---
Difficulty wise I've paired an armor piercing hardened combat shotgun with enforcer, it's starting to feel cheap. Even at a distance, long as you get a hit, you can cripple a scorch beast allowing you to dispatch it however you care to. I'm sure you can just run away too if you don't have anything powerful enough. (Caution. Any crippled enemy has a chance to heal their injury) Even enforcer 2 cripples any enemy fairly consistently. 
---
So to answer your question, I haven't found the game any more difficult. Yes I'm level 88 but honestly that isn't that high when there are level 200-300's out there. 
---
The Pvp in this game is one of the shitiest i ever saw in a fps
---
Have you considered turning around and killing them?
---
My reaction when I realize it's a laser shooting variant "awww it's just one of the cute ones". It's like they're the old senile gutsies who forgot how to use their weapons.
---
Good to know. Never realized this before
---
Figured I'd do the challenge to kill 5 cryptids with a laser weapon as I found a two shot variant recently. Killed my last Snally with the last 10% of durability. On the other hand, my two Handmade rifles can cycle at least 2000 rounds each before needing repairs...
---
Alright alright. Look, the only youtuber(S) I currently support making money are Laymen Gaming. You should check them out. 
---
Seeing as each character will max out at 1200 caps I think your math is off.
---
Maybe max crit with sneak attack could get Me from a rifle but that's it, I get how the melee does it, has that perk that avoids armor then an anti armor weapon so essentially armor is useless
---
 FO4 was very successful without that mechanic, and I don't remember any popular interest in adding it back in.
---
And someone will see this...and implement an over-reaching patch which will have unintended ripples thru the game &amp; nobody will end up happy even though you technically got what you wanted.
---
Dont people ever learn what happens when they complain about game mechanics?  This ALWAYS happens.
---
Unyielding has great returns on melee builds, but it's a huge boost to VATs centered builds, like a crit build. The AP pool is so huge you don't need to worry about AP regen/restore items carrying you through fights as much. It also lets you spec better since you don't need to have as much investment into strength to buff carry weight because rifles can only be reduced in weight with legendary armor effects
---
Good.
---
Yea I would never have noticed it if I hadn't read about it on here a while back.
---
I was glad when they did away with weapon and armor deterioration in Skyrim and Fallout 4. I find it annoying because in Fallout 3 and Oblivion, my weapons and armor would break too fast. They tweaked it in New Vegas to where it doesn't happen as fast, which felt more real to me.
---
for me the weapons do need a small damage boost... but have you play tom clansis the division? thats where Bullet sponge phrase came from ......... small generic enemies taking loads of rounds acting like level one enemies.... cheap very cheap gameplay
---
Yes, I know. Rifles are junk now so let's keep it balanced and make everything junk
---
If the piece is repaired beyond 100% , his defenses stats will increase , but that bonus will gradually decreased when the durability goes down . 
---
You may find that your results are better than mine. I only have one charisma so only one star hard bargain and grape mentats gets me 25. If you have more charisma your net may be more than 25.
---
Omg can you imagine? Hit the rat. "I cant goddamn see"
---
Wow really? All at once? 
---
Yeah sry thats what i meant, i dont like it either
---
Answer is not to nerf everything though.
---
Realise that yes melee is powerful, but you have to get close. Guns have range so the advantage for 90% of a conflict. If your perception is high enough a melee should never get close enough to wave a stick at you.
---
While I respect your opinion, I'm curious to see the response this thread gets. IMO more pvp was among the last things the FO community was hoping for, but I may be wrong.
---
Good hunting!  
---
I don't use energy weapons for much else than killing robots in this game.
---
He means the under suits. There are several jumpsuits like the Vault and BOS underarmors that can be upgraded with Shielded or Treated linings with stable flux endgame materials to add points to Str etc. those stay on while regular armor comes off w PA 
---
Idk about that. I joined the scorched earth event last night and by the time I got to the nuke area the queen was dead. This was within one minute of the nuke hitting. Idk how though.
---
Yeah there's a safe in the mayor's room that you get the key for upon completion and it holds 8 stim packs that refresh daily. On occasion I have randomly found 11 stimpacks in there for some reason lol
---
Why are cool elements of games taken out for their sequel? I was talking to a friend about it yesterday and we settled on maybe it keeps that first individual game unique and give players something to always love and adore and ultimately come back to. 
---
But MY view on gaming is keep what works and build on top of it making it even more cool! Lol but I thought I‚Äôd ask since naming weapons and armor used to be a thing and now it‚Äôs gone good example of a cool element being taken out on purpose.
---
This. I hate that if I don't pick one of the like 2 builds that actually work, I am stuck struggling through everything. I want to build/play my character my way, not the same damn way everyone else does. That's the beauty of games like Fallout. It's not Final Fantasy, for crying out loud.
---
Let me know when you do that. Learn something. 
---
Cause I‚Äôm not seeing it in your stupid reply.
---
Sell out all vendors.  $1400 a day from vendors.  Minus travel cost.   
---
I really don't thinkk they do too little damage... Just energy and heavy
---
For sentinel it is "stagger" not armor pene.
---
No you don't, those are normal spacesuits.
---
I don't think that's the clean one. But I also just learned you can also find a Clean Spacesuit Helmet at Berkley Springs. So I guess it's not very rare either.
---
LOL. Yes, people like you are the problem. You're entitled and spoiled and need everything handed to you. 
---
You can‚Äôt fool me Deacon! I know that‚Äôs you! Get off Reddit and practice throwing a grenade for once.
---
On that note i just want to point out its perfectly fine to enjoy a game and get frustrated with parts of it, and its perfectly fine to play other games in the meantime.  
---
I recently started playing rise of nations, its pretty good
---
gutsys are the real encounter enemys. they 3-5 shot anybody. in PWA i got about 512 physical res. in regular armor with perks i got 480-500 depending on which armor i wear (BOS mixed with robot). there is no difference between 300 up to 500 physical res. they always deal huge dmg. this game is so bad balaced on all resistance and dmg stats you cant even try to get a solid build. everything looks like random scaled.
---
Immersion is real! I really miss the feeling when I was fresh out of the vault 76, wandering around the forest looking for purified water and stimpak. Breathing sound of mole miners still scares me good:)
---
I can wait. Not that I'd play the game mode but I'd be very curious to see how large the group of PvPers are and how active they are. Like are there a decent fan base for PvP or are they real niche.
---
[Someone did a survey recently on PvP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16IU3XNNmrygmpkZ_Tp649dcJywnYZTacubAEQVWUOQI/edit#gid=1803744697) and close to 70% said they won't play Survival with only 20% saying they would. Will be interesting to see if a player base of 20-25% would be enough to sustain PvP long term.
---
Which makes it more obvious who the cheaters are in game, or the P2W ers are
---
An m16 with a full magazine and a loaded m203 is 11.79 lbs. If it was polymer, 3 lbs less. M4 is going to be almost the same weight, depending in the length of the barrel
---
to quote our lord and savior, Todd Howard: "It just works! It just f'in works!"
---
Besides the 1400 caps from vendors there's also the cap stashes. They've been nerfed so hard I actually got 1 cap from one. Make a map of locations throughout the Wasteland, you can hit about 20 average. 
---
This is amazing. It inspires me to write a small story up and try it out haha. 
---
Even if they just added a feature where you could nuke any fissure site and the queen arrived it would make things a bit more interesting. Then just vary the loot depending on where you kill her. This would be such a quick fix while they sort out more content
---
Ur story just shows noone wants PVP in this game, yet thats the extra content we are getting. 
---
Guess I'll be checking that again. Thanks! 
---
I would've gave you food.....alongside a nuke mine I just laid 
---

Every time I log in, my hot wheel is missing half the items I put there. Not game breaking by any means but rather annoying.

Who farms his own xo1 calibrated shocks? Just farm whitespring for a couple hours, sell the loot on reddit and buy two xo1 calibrated shocks and a jetpack also through reddit. Your stubborness is holding you back.

Bjhill absolutely could.

Might as well! Equip pharma farmer and run through EMS and you'll find around 6 medkits and potentially be rewarded with a 3* legendary on the top floor
---
I‚Äôve been thinking to go that way a few times but then end up getting side tracked, or collect to much along the way and have nowhere to put it so go back to camp on the east side  ü§™
---
Yep. And putting one in your base creates a warp-hole for molerats to get directly inside...
---
I'm not certain why anyone would even want the shower. Am I the only one permanently running around 50% irradiated for the 25 carrying capacity?
---
Vault suit &amp; undershirt-jeans dont reduce ur PA stats.  
---
But yea, this shit needs to get fixed too.  
---
Apply to Bethesda as a balance designer, you clearly have a talent.
---
For real! Everyone needs to see my characters, One and Two. Such a disappointment.
---
Yes, kept happening with scorchbeasts.
---
The joke behind my bald, grumpy, buzzsaw- and flamer-wielding British expat. being named Codsworthless (he actually was replaced by a robot!) is kinda lost without said name being visible to others
---
Its not just those.  Alot of under-armor reduce stats.  
---
The Only 2 i tested and worked with PA is vault suit and undershirt-jeans
---
He was role playing a hungry cannibal exploring his options.  
---
If they added human npcs it would be the same, the dialogue menu being missing is the true design choice. Human npcs would be the same as robot npcs just human. Wooby is an example of one.
---
The enclave ones work fine too, even when upgraded.
---
So much awesome!  
---
:-D 
---
Oh... I was wondering why my patio table had repaired itself. It had been lingering on like 5% HP for weeks.
---
I didn't mind since it was a very limited-time bonus buff. Also, maybe it's just me but I have such a hard time finding people to play with that the idea of a party of 4 that all have a unique unstoppables costume just seems too rare to be a huge issue.
---
&gt;When i was running to workshop station to claim it and kill 15level, that was not reacting to me, some other higher level took this workshop and killed this 15level guy. Then he tried to sell me his TSE 10mm pistol, but i was here only for food which he refused to give me, so he died too.
---
Some players do want pvp. I posted this 6hours ago on bethesda forum. People there are way more kind. There are 3 different groups of people. 
---
1. Those who call it funny and like idea 
---
2. sensitive ppl who think it is stupid 
---
3. agressive guys who would engage me
---
Here are mostly sensitive agresors haha.
---
I feel like the idea of fist fighting but it should be a fist only pvp event like a gladiator ring. Making it a norm would be like Rs‚Äôs pvp mechanics pre-Eoc 
---
I was very excited until I discovered that I was going to be multiplayer.  When I found out that I would not have npcs, I felt a frustration 
---
the game has hurt us all 
---
Exactly. :)
---
In 400 hours i was never hit by mini nuke. Bring it on!
---
üôÑ
---
There probably should be some sort of resource sink in the game so you're not just steadily increasing reserves of junk you don't end up using, however as people have said it's WAY too fast. Bethesda nerfed White Knight because it was a cornerstone of builds but they didn't realize WHY it was the cornerstone of builds. It wasn't because it was so awesome, it was because the durability problem is so bad. People would've been happy to ignore durability perks in favor of other more interesting perks if the durability wasn't such an issue.
---
Nope i havent seen anything besides glowing since i hit like 35 and im at 53
---
I threw away two bomber jackets....,
---
Lmao deleted. Only way to even see the actual post is through A Fallout Discord that grabs subreddits as they are posted! Hahahah. Stop whining. Player levels matter and so do perk cards. Whether it‚Äôs stupid mechanics or not it‚Äôs a fact. Grow up and either leave it, take a break or play it. I got killed multiple times as a low level against high levels. I wasn‚Äôt actively seeking pvp either. But do have you seen me whining about Bethesda making a messed up pvp survival? No I‚Äôm dewing with it. I grinded and played and I‚Äôm now a lvl 150. All you can really do is either leave, or continue playing and ignore the dumb stuff. Also only attack when necessary or if you have a pretty good feeling you‚Äôll win. Sorry to be rude about it, but lol I‚Äôm seeing more and more people whining about this game, and it‚Äôs super annoying. Each release has had its problems. We got over them. Time to do it again.
---
So can a lot of the things you pay microtransactions for in phone games...it just takes a lot longer to earn them than to buy them.  That's literally what pay to win came from.  I could either spend hours upon hours trying to find these outfits, or I spend 8 bucks and buy it and have it and am immediately able to do better/have better stats than someone who didn't.
---
Some Camps that take hours to build, simply won't move without completely rebuilding. I had someone leveling my camp a few days ago, and I killed them 4 times before they gave up, I did get around 600 caps off the guy, but no junk, and the damage done to my camp far exceeded the collected bounty.
---
Mutation Plans were not much cheaper. They've always been 17600 with 15 charisma and hard bargain 3. Jet Pack, calibrated shocks, and other plans have increased in price but not mutation plans.
---
See now you're gonna make me check....damn you guys are wrong. https://youtu.be/BWo5EkKiGaw
---
Make a decent build and kill ghouls/sbq. Easy 2-3k in drops an hour, if you sell through reddit.
---
And by decent build I mean 1shotting whitespring ghouls with any knife.
---
Try and unlock every crafting recipe, then move to every mod.
---
It's a long road I'm on, but my camp looks fantastic!
---
Can we please level gate the scorched earth event. It's end game content, a level 23 has no business being there. It's not really fair people can't complete the ONLY end game content because 6 lvl 25's are hidding and not contributing to the fight.
---
There are just so many things at odds against the players and management seems to have been pretty bad, but I do have hope... if Star Wars battlefront 2 can turn around like it did Bethesda can too, I just took long to register my disappointment in the game.
---
I think the notion is that pve players will stay in adventure, and griefers prefer people they can upset.
---
Actual pvp players will certainly try survival, but griefers are not about that.
---
The condition beyond 100% effects the damage as one guy already stated, melee weapons damage is also affected by condition over 100%
---
Yeah, hard thing is to wait an enemy to get near you and press a button, no need to aim or anything, to one shot it. Get fking real man.
---
I had 2 ppl on me in watoga after a SBQ event hitting back to back for like 2 minutes. I took slap dmg but I still took alot. 
---
Even so, is it really pay to win if anybody can buy it without spending a dime? Atoms are in game currency which are easy enough to earn without having to spend real money.
---
 so many bad decisions for a well-known company 
---
They've found *the most* subtle way to get pay to win in the game. It's a test, or a way to allow players to become more accustomed to this content.
---
Isnt sarcasm, after so many topics in this reddit I assume dupers are behind some of the worst stuff that ever happened in human history.
---
Later in the year? It is just FEBRUARY! You won't have any players by then!

Lol, now i imagine some cannibals behave same as vegans.

I have a raider themed base underneath the bridge by the Top of the World station. I've tried my best to mirror the aesthetic uphill. I have never had any issues with griefers beyond someone disarming my bone chimes. I get a lot of thumbs up from passers by. I like to think they have to do a double take to check whether it is a C.A.M.P or part of the standard map.
---
Course, I'd have a way easier job of it if there were raider themed options for building...
---
They do stay wanted after they disconnect or server hop.
---
Wanted doesn't go away until the bounty is collected.
---
Depends on the gun, some do weight a little too much.  But a LOT are under weight.(anything heavy, or 50 cal) The ammo is totally underweight.  So really it evens out.  
---
The damage is also good \*mostly\*
---
The problem in the game is ARMOR.  This is the thing that is breaking the game at the moment.  High armor makes low damage wep worthless.
---
Yeah this game isn't like Destiny or other looter shooters where you're constantly gaining power so the enemies need tons of health so you can see how you're getting more powerful. In FO76 a weapon might end up doing twice as much damage at lvl 50 that it did at lvl 1 but that's not such an increase in power to make it so enemies need so much HP.
---
Duped nuka colas probably.
---
With the shitshow that is pvp, i don't want any of it even myself being a big player of competitive shooter.
---
Your ranged weapons will do no damage against someone with a sentinel/cavalier assasin armor, even tse.
---
So u will have to play with melee 1HKO or you will lose,no matter what
---

This does not work. Cap stashes are instanced per player and hopping won't change anything
---
I don‚Äôt doubt the beta will suck but allowing toons from adventure I figure is a way to work out balance for when reals pvp only servers drop 
---
Definitely very annoying. Still the gun can be quite good. Got a Vampire one. Gunsmith 5 + Weapon Artisan 3 for a significantly longer lifespan and i'm all set for tough situations. The only real problem for me is this reload issue.
---
Well, those people are dumb.

Tbh, i like PVP.  But not in this game.  PVP in this game is so ass backwards i refuse to engage.

I go in with X-01 PA, 20 stimpaks minimum, super sledge with damage increasing perks/fully modded shotgun with damage increasing perks, and level 3 hacker to disable targeting parameters on the turrets to target all the robots.

[There are different ways to interact PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN0hbQALkag) like hunter/hunted, monster mash, bounty hunting, worshops,.. .      Players just don't use it much, becouse main part of comunity are pve players

This approach to food solicitation would have made Oliver Twist a much better book.

Thanks I‚Äôm just trying to gauge how the player base feels I‚Äôm not on the f76 hate train since i enjoyed playing it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm upset how the devs have been handling shit as of late
---
People like you....fucking crybaby....is the reason the game now sucks balls and is probably up there with trumps government shutdown. Boo hoo i cant get a wall. Also you" boo hoo I got one shotted nerf the melee." Hey while we are at it why not nerf shotguns. And super stimpacks, those things are op as fuck. You know why dont we just nerf the entire game so we can all run around with our d hanging out and beat someone with the stick I picked up. Oh wait a cargo bot fell l.j on my head and killed me nerf the cargobots. And while your nerfing those why not just delete the game off your servers because that's the only thing that's left to nerf.
---
Bro what? Now you guys are just reaching to find things to be outraged about...
---
I think if the real pvp servers launch after the balance changes in the beta it will make watching it on twitch interesting thus more people willing to buy the game at a 30$ value 
---
The other trick is to never buy anything.
---
Way too easy to buy a plan for 200 caps, which brings your net to zero at a vendor.
---
The only way to accumulate any cash is to resist that.  It is hard.  Even harder with the extra plans available at vendors now.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt you think Gutsy‚Äôs are a little too... I don‚Äôt know... gutsy?
---
Hey! Do not appreciate the insinuation. Just because they were created with a round torso, doesn't mean they have a big belly.
---
Gutsy, pfft! If you think they're too gutsy, can't imagine what you think of sentry bots. You'd probably tease them and call them sedentary bots...
---
Ok. At least there's that. I'm probably gonna buy this game soon.
---
I have issues with this on Xbox. If I haven't played that day and join a lobby I have to run around for a minute with whatever gun or weapon I had out when I last logged out (usually won't fire if it's a gun) and if I pull my pip boy out before the game catches up it just goes to a black screen and doesn't do anything. Can't put it away, can switch guns and use stimpacks even if I'm at full health, and can pull up the map but can't fast travel. It will say enemies are nearby even if I'm at my camp. Super irritating, I have to go back to the main menu and relog to a different server and that doesn't even fix it sometimes.

Ty man this is why I love this subreddit

I think a sneak crit rifle bats build will decimate with the crit spamming and that‚Äôs my plan since with chameleon it will be impossible to find me and vats
---
Would say git gut, but i already met some Assasin/sentinel armor wearing immortal guys.

---
Most of my cores i have are still from early stages of the game when they dropped like candy from robo brains and the core glitch that would refill ur cores.
---
 Nuka Girl agrees wholeheartedly
---
Ty I feel stupid for not putting this together. 
---
Yes, weapons do need repair in real life. I've rarely had to repair a personally owned weapon (barrel replacements and a spring once in a while). All parts of a firearm degrades with use, and will eventually fall below a serviceable threshold, and need replacement.   
---
The game makes manufacturing weapons way too easily, so you forget that what would really be happening is that you are scavenging decades old and worn weapons and repairing them with jury rigged junk scrap - it's more likely your repairs that then continually need to be re-repaired repeatedly (like that bobby in you are using as to hold the bolt in the carrier, or that bolt handle you made out of wood, scrap aluminum and some vegetable starch).  
---
But yes, it's a grindy / resource dumpy mechanic that I don't like, but it's also not that much of a problem, either (at least after maxing levels out).
---
I see posts like this and I'm always skeptical about the frequency with which they seem to get griefed. I have about 300+ hours and several characters and I've probably met less than 5 of these people. There must be something missing here? Are you covering your C.A.M.P. in swaztikas or something? 
---
I need to see a screen shot of "all the mats" it cost to repair your camp, because "your story is so toucbing, it sounds just like a lie" :)
---
PC   - 1.) Yes  2.) Yes  3.) Didn't watch it  4.) No  5.) Yes  6.) Yes  7.) No, but its pretty funny  8.) Not anymore :(  9.) No  10.) Yes
---
That‚Äôs true, I was referring to PVE more than PVP however. When a bloodied melee build tries to fight me I just vats and shoot them out of the sky when they hop around like a rabbit. 
---
In PVP I would say the stealth lever action builds are the most powerful though. They don‚Äôt really have a weakness half the time you can‚Äôt find them and while you‚Äôre running around looking for them they one-shot you.
---
If you appeared by my workshop, I would not know what you wanted, because we do not have text chat.
---
But, if I did, then I'd let you have my workshop for free, because I never keep them.
---
Actually, I never even bother to acquire any.
---
You know, attracting stupid PvP'ers with dupped/bought-for-real-money TSE guns...
---
That's funny shit,  LMFAO,  you made my night.
---
Could just use a gamma gun on your sentinel armor. Too bad I'm xb1 or I would put it to the test that melee isn't the only thing that can kill you. 
---
Haven't failed a single Scorched Earth event - just freeze her if she won't land and you have an easy enough target in the air to just pelt to death.  One fight around 16 minutes, the rest under 10.  Waiting for the loot to spawn when more people join the fight is the biggest problem - causes massive server lags!  Done somewhere between 5-10 since the patch, 2 on night of and at least 5 over the weekend.
---
I know someone was trying to make it work, I always wanted it to come back. I wouldn't mind it if I didn't have to dedicate a dozen perks to repairing things less often.
---

I think sweet rolls may stack with grape mentats, too. I may be remembering it wrong, 
---
Codes reset on Monday while updates drop on Tuesday.
---
Did nobody use luck of the draw? It doesn't eliminate repairing your weapons, but it sure helps.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox one and need to know if the ‚Äúnerf‚Äù to the TSE will be fixed or if they will remain useless? I don‚Äôt mind a nerf but they are completely useless now. I don‚Äôt like melee so my choice is either go thru mass amounts of ammo or new game. I love fallout and don‚Äôt want to leave. PLEASE fix the nerf!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah, that's why I asked. New(casual) players don't necessary know that there are places where you should not build. I am the first one to shoot when I see a Whitspring camper.
---
I have like 2000 rounds for all of my ammo, but you really only get that much from farming places and just picking it up off dead enemies. 
---
Haha you made me laugh, thanks for that
---
There are several ways the dickheads are using now to force PVP, and something needs to be done about it.
---
* 2 or more players working together, 1 attacks your CAMP (usually the lower level in the group), they have no caps, or junk, but when you kill them, their buddies are waiting nearby to kill you, and then you lose caps &amp; junk besides the damage to your camp.
---
* 2 or more players attacking you with unarmed weapons (Gauntlets, Death Tambo, or Power fists), they tend to pick targets in Power Armor, hoping you have Reactive Plates, or Tesla Coils, since that will cause injury to them and automatically take you out of Pacifist mode, and since they are such pussies, they usually have another dickhead with them standing by with a high damage ranged weapon.
---
You'll be sorely disapointed it was way too easy I'd sugest keeping level 15 10mm pistol on your character if you want a challenge
---
[I think hunting rifles was added to game after duping was fixed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw58NzHaI0g)
---
My problem is I went up slapped him to start PvP, he hit me back I died... But he needs to hit me to start PvP or I can't hurt him. So how do I start PvP if his hit that starts the PvP kills me?
---
I've been doing quick laps around the outside of Whitespring resort to kill the sentry bots. Each one drops a fusion core, so usually get 3-4 a run. Their CND isn't always the greatest though.
---
I‚Äôve had my Sig P226 break it‚Äôs rails before.
---
I‚Äôve also had my HK416 need to replace a barrel, BCG, and other small parts, this was after probably 20-30k rounds. 
---
So, they do/will break after heavy use. Key word being HEAVY.
---
I think shit breaks way too fast in this game. 
---
Source: 13 deployments
---
A guy did that to one of my lvl 30 alts. I exited and lit him up with an armor piercing 10mm. He came back and I killed him again. 
---
Sadly, he blocked me before I could find his base on my main and call in an orbital strike.
---
There's an increasing demand for both new content and human/ghoul npcs. I think (if they want this game to survive) they'll give people what they really want.
---
Yeah, that could not kill me in one hit so...
---
You are all the problem. You are very bad at the game and you come on the threads to complain and plead with GGG to make the game easier.
---
I did it six times. Two missile launchers, two crossbows, a 10mm sub, and a classic double barrel boom stick.
---

---
Get off my lawn!
---
I was doing Monster Mash once a day, before they completely shit on that event, and selling lots of chems/rad/stims/water to vendors and both of my chars have more than 15k caps each.
---
Why try and level fast? Just play the game and enjoy it as you play. It doesn't get better or offer more because you got to a certain level. 
---
And don't do what everyone else does. That seems like a sure way to end up missing out. 
---
Overall I just avoid using the core draining stuff like VATS and jetpacks, no power sprinting, and I naturally find enough cores during gameplay that I typically have more than I started with over time.  I'll swap out a used core for a better charged one if I find it on some chassis in the wild...  just to keep the number of cores I'm carrying down.
---
Don't know. My crystal ball is in the shop right now.
---
I'm here all day....well after 5 when I'm off of work
---
Its stable flux - weights too much and you get random ones each time you do Scorched Earth.  I only need more violet, the rest is just dead weight.
---
Occasionally data can be corrupted if the system is shutdown improperly or the game crashes.  Not very often.  But it happens.  
---
More nerfs? Seriously?
---
Is that where my mystery set of ultracite came from? I have 2. Mybudfy had a mystery set of raider too.
---
&gt; If im in pacifist mode, i dont want to hurt players and they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to hurt me plain and simple.
---
That was never how the game was designed. It was always described and pitched to include PvP. If you didn't want that then either:
---
* You bought a game without knowing what it was
---
* You bought a game knowing it was something you wouldn't enjoy
---
Because the Broadsider isn't an explosive weapon. Explosive weapons are rocket launchers, the Fat Man, and the M79 and auto grenade launchers. Also, even if they have the explosive modifier on them, they are still considered the type that the base weapon (eg a shotgun with the explosive modifier is still considered a shotgun).
---
I just played Apex Legends. Trust me, it's worse-Bethesda can fix 76. EA can't fix Apex...
---
More nerfs... fuck yeah....
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs more than that....I am having to do full reinstall....totally missing from my hard drive.
---
i cannot wait either, NO one is gonna use them. it is basically gonna be single player mode
---
No I mean the atom challenge that requires you to kill certain monsters like the grafton monster, mothman, flatwoods monster, etc.  Still missing the flatwoods monster from that list.
---
Lucky Hole Mine for lead.
---
Cause Bowie died :(
---
Yes. Dude is being killed and instead of getting good, wants everyone to be leveled to his mediocrity....
---
Farming and selling. Easy.
---
What level are you?

You can see people you're teamed up with and I think people on your friends list.

If you have this set you will always carry multiple stealthboy mark 3
---
Once I found out the nuke codes are the same across the board and someone always solves them in a matter of hours, I don't bother anymore
---
(Just FYI, one if the latest patches fixed the nuke-girl, sort of. Under armor now stays equipped and you can even use face masks and glasses under it.... but chest armor shows on top of the outfit. Kind of cool with certain BoS combat armor torsos, though
---
Gotcha
---
That's a nice dream.
---
Too bad the reality will be you being grief killed repeatedly, and living in perpetual squalor as they loot your low level corpse. :D
---
thanks for correcting me... i stand corrected.  debuffs would still be a good option though.
---
i had some guy who was level 48 with an explosive pipe rifle want to PVP me (a level 190 character). he shot me in the back while i was scrapping stuff, turned around a slapped him to the moon with my Miner gauntlet. he died in 2 swings (1 for slap damage, 1 for full damage)
---
Everything i dont need or use.   Make a low budget camp and put couple water purifiers down and just sell water.  Thsts works decent enough also.  
---
Seriously, did you not catch the sarcasm oozing from this post? Lol
---
I have found the BoS combat armor plans at the 2 vendors in Grafton from time to time.
---
So one sting and you were dead?  Because that poison was darn near fatal on regular difficulty.  
---
a head .... hehe
---
Sorry OP, seems no one else got the sarcasm
---
If your base is turreted up at white springs selfishly hogging the kills especially from a nuke i launched hell im blowing your base up numerous times till you leave üòé
---
Somebody drop me 20,000 flamer fuel and I sold them for 8000 caps.
---
When you build at a workshop you  use the workshops mats (green) if its white you are going to use your mats so you shouldn‚Äôt get the workshop mats back imo I never use my mats
---
Which happens with corrupted games installs. 
---
I've had this happen at Blackwater mine I'm taking a ton of damage from Mole miners and I can't do anything needless to say I don't end my game session there anymore
---
I knew it had PVP.  I guessim the dummy that assumed pacifist mode would be, u know pacifist.  Silly me i guess.  
---
Yeah duck that. Maybe triple initial damage and not DoT
---
Those are worth something?
---
Vault-tec university
---
Ya was on last night, went to fast travel to an even it just sits there and the little wheel spins forever. Close the game, load it again and fast travel again, puts me in a different spot than where I wanted to go. The disconnects me or server not responding. 
---
It sucks!
---
Also the greifing is because there ain't shit else to do now
---
Grind, grind, grind, then sell the shit you just grinded for.
---
nope mate it is a weird one....it is an Energy weapon and its Ammo is energy ammo but its damage is Ballistic. It does in fact fall under the rifleman perk as it is considered a Rifle.  
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Gauss_rifle_(Fallout_76)
---
I like you.  You‚Äôre an unapologetic asshole.  I too engage in raiding.  
---
I usually just don‚Äôt ask though.  I just shoot you in the head until you go red.  I hope they add dropping Aid items in the new survival mode.
---
I rarely, if ever, bother with the workshops now unless there's a challenge available for them. The output of the extractors is so low that they're a waste of resources to construct and defend, when doing a run of Bug Bend Tunnel will net you quite a lot of loot that cn be easily scrapped down for a couple hundred steel, plus there's several locations that lead can be hoovered up with little fuss.
---
It's why I moved my camp away from the lead deposit in toxic valley and back to near Top of the World, I get more resources just running around the place and anything I don't need I just vendor it for caps.
---
buff alcohols effects in fist fight pvp and I'm on-board

Let's see what else I can post for a laugh today. I hope I get more of these comments
---
When I made my Beth account a few years ago I just used my real name as I never thought I'd use it for much else other then fallout shelter and then 76 uses your account username which is unchangeable and your character name is pointless
---
This took no effort... No insults?
---
I got a FatMan with an increased fire rate ü§î
---
Pick up everything, scrap it and sell it on. I make a few thousand a day just from selling steel, adhesive, springs screws and whatever else people want to buy.
---
"You have an opinion so you suck" blah blah blah
---
Yeah but I wanna collect the pieces buy my self and solve them by my self, as it is supposed to be. I just needed to know when the codes reset and if it‚Äôs even worth collecting them today because I‚Äôve heard that they reset on Tuesday or something so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do 
---
Yeah
---
Have you tried taking the door off and putting it on the opposite way? I had that issue when I used those walls as well and putting the door on the opposite way fixed it for me.
---
According to BethesdaLogic‚Ñ¢ (as expressed in DevNotes and Inside the Vault articles) this change would make e.g. picking Strength to boost melee damage feel too "mandatory". Instead, they want to "encourage more balanced picks"...
---
Thank you that‚Äôs what I wanted to know so now the codes will last until next Monday then they‚Äôll be reset and on Tuesday there we‚Äôll be new codes available yes ? So if you want to collect them to launch a nuke you gotta do it Between Tuesday and the following Monday right ? 
---
i like to let them hit me. i take my time, finish what im doing, then walk away like im leaving. as soon as they get settled into trading, i light them up. fuck those ppl
---
I didn't know how much I wanted this... Versa please let me convert my decontamination arches into contamination arches.
---
The funniest part is that it's only the ballistic ones too. The energy weapon version of them is a joke. I really have no clue what's going on with that enemy. Must be a case of the Mirelurk Queen post 'fixing' where she'd melt people with her acid attack in, like, 1 second.
---
Doesn't work like that on pc. Files are still the corrupted or not
---
lol yeah the mire is really spooky my first time around that area was also the first time meeting that huge hermit crab and that was pretty intense
---
Nice congrats. I got my first tse submachine gun from a random 3* col gutsy in a silo. The game didn't care about what I wanted though lol
---
Ideal solution - do not build expensive camp. I solved this problem even better - I unistalled this fucking mess of a game and have zero complaints now.
---
Hey do you like the new vats memory?
---
Just a heads up, baseball bats are two-handed weapons. All two-handers appear to be held with one while in PA, in case that's what threw you off.
---
I feel Ike this problem ties into how bad selling items is too. For example, let‚Äôs say you get a decent rifle from an enemy, while you have no need to scrap it because you have no benefit to doing that any more. Why not sell it. Until you get to a shop and he only buys it for 12 caps (15 if your lucky and have the perk on for it)
---
Had my camp leveled once playing every day since beta basically on the most toxic platform: Xbox 
---
It's a sighn from the heavens, that you should not play this game.
---
Been playing with same install since last year so ....it‚Äôs odd to suddenly corrupt if that‚Äôs what happened. Never happened to me with any other game ever.
---
Same with my rifle. I have no idea how much it's supposed to do anymore. Between bloody mess, adrenaline and rad worms breaking everything I can't even work out the cause...
---
I tend to agree, I think it is a combination of not enough stash limit and the vendor cap limit of 200 is just not enough. For someone like me that plays a lot, it is easy to buy them out and then you spend a ton of time running around to others trying to sell the items you pick up. Why do the vendors at Whitesprings have 0 caps to purchase from you? This makes no sense to me?
---
Lmao perhaps....I only been playing the last few weeks to help me friend level up....nothing else to do. 
---
They need fo76 bathrobe and slippers outfit.
---
But if you‚Äôre gonna wave a cane
---
I counter with 
---
Legendary walker!
---
+10 damage or +10 to all perks except strength, ability and perception 
---
Same thing happens to me (xbox) if that matters, it seems it's just a visual bug, when I take all the perk cards off I don't have a lockpick skill of 1 of anything.
---
Would you like a tissue? 
---
I wanted more challenging end game content. That didn't mean spawn more random mobs and make it harder by nefing all the weapons.
---
Just make an alt account with the name you want. 
---
I did this so that my name would show Manta__Man
---
It's a lot for a joke I guess, but I find it funny. 
---
I have gotten a lot more griefing than I do on my main, but I also get a lot of people giving me comic books 
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad. I misread the first time too, hence my original comment. 
---
happens to me once i capture 2 workshops and fast travel between them a couple times. XB1
---
Just me or MIRV frags do nothing? Like they don't split into more?
---
&gt; Technically, they haven't reneged on their promise, because all of the microtransactions are cosmetic only; you simply receive an advantage for *wearing* them. 
---
Correct me if I misunderstood you, but... by that reasoning Bethesda could sell high damage weapons in the Atom shop because you only receive an advantage for using those weapons.

That's crazy, my TSE double barrel does 415 with all perks
---
Huh? You can see quite clearly on his list of items. The Spacesuit doesn't have the word "Clean" before it, just Spacesuit. While the helmet does Clean Spacesuit Helmet.
---
Only problem with this, I accidentally typed three letters of my name and then hit done, I needed a couple more so it looks weird and as far as I'm aware, you cant change it
---
It can.  Just not often.
---
I‚Äôve seen it happen to users who play FFXIV.
---
Yep in fallout 4 it was 5 for max charge so I guess the way to get it to work would be to max it at 20
---
I started after Christmas too On PS4 if not for Black Diamond and All Rise I would have never made it far in the game. Why? Because scoped weapons and rifles freeze and can‚Äôt be changed when mobbed by baddies. Scope stays up to your eye and up,down a dozen times from button input lag. 
---
Basically you best fight with whatever is in hand before the mob runs up on you. The lag won‚Äôt let you change when they are hitting you.

Take over more than one power plant. And know how to build a fusion core.

Just scale up damage dramatically for pve across the board.
---
Can confirm. The cap stash in the Whitespring baggage storage, for example.
---
Why should anyone have to server hop because of assholes? We should have a simple button you can click or not that you want to participate in PVP or not. You should not have to be part of it if you dont want too....I am here for PVE not PVP, been there done that and it gets old very quickly to me. Like someone already posted, while trying to craft when some shit stabs you in the back 22 times in a row, that is just stupid.
---
Man, these emo posts about a game
---
Did you hit the Whitesprings train station first? They have connected caps for whatever reason
---
But F76 aint survival game, its MMORPG but without MMO
---
What happens if you have 3 Perk cards and a teammate shares another?
---
That's horribly wrong as any look even for 15 seconds will tell you nuke plants existed pre war as hell even the cars were nuclear, car wreck and boom glowing plants. Hell the enclave even has full on research on the nuke plants that was done prewar
---
Junk. Bulked crap, asbestos, gold, etc. 
---
Yeah, I hope they do something with the LH Mine. One of my favorite locations in the game. Creepy and mysterious.
---
To be exact, the codes usually reset in the night of Monday to Tuesday at 00:00 GMT, so yes, if you want co collect the keys, you have to do it from Tuesday to Monday. The folks over at Nukacrypt are usually done within the first hour of reset.(if you dont want to decrypt them yourself)
---
It's pretty clear he's joking.
---
Buying them converted certainly makes things easier. Awesome collection you have my friend!
---
Meh I‚Äôm ranged and I keep them at arms length 
---
I think they‚Äôre up there w/muties for xp 
---
Did you put all your junk into stash? There's a glitch where the game doesn't think you have the materials if they are separated between inventory and stash.
---
You can actually purchase the stimpak plan at the whitespring bunker aka the enclave area. If you haven't done the enclave quest yet I'd recommend it. It unlocks another vender with good gadgets. It's also a required quest to launch nukes.
---
Game didn‚Äôt crash not was there any recent shutdown.
---
Dadgum whippersnappers!
---
Thank you so much for the help 
---
Grognak? Whose that, I have amnosia
---
So many glass cannons running around the wastelands.
---
Honestly the best thing to do is just to spec into as much melee as possible, the AI are that brain dead they can't shoot and fully hit something up close with missing or just standing still. Ditch guns until a new patch buffs them once again. 
---
Ah, another Call Me Kevin fan.
---
700 will be not enough and 1000 will be not enough. Why? Because Fallout 4 had unlimited stash and game at its gameplay core never was supposed to have any stash limit at all. This game is a copy of Fallout 4 but with broken game design because of engine limitations. All other shit is just a consequence of that. In Fallout 4 this looting and inventory system worked, because there were unlimited stash. In F76 *IT IS JUST DONT WORK*. 
---
You hear that, Todd? It does not work! And you said it is! Why, why...
---
Thor Ragnorak? 
---
You clearly weren't paying attention when they said they liked the idea that if someone started slapping you about even if you didn't want to fight they could eventually kill you.
---
Yeah 
---
After completing raider rose quest I somehow got a full raider PA set.
---
Same lvl as my other one so I sold it for pieces to vendors 
---
I can confirm quad broadsider.  Still useless.  :(
---
This guy screws and springs!
---
My biggest peeve is that there isn't any foregrip option for the SMG.
---
SBQ is bs. Don't need another bs.
---
I‚Äôm so mad about the explosive ‚Äúrebalance‚Äù
---
I only use one shot explosive and the update cut my damage down more than half what it was
---
I haven‚Äôt played since, honestly 
---
LOL just play melee /s
---
I have seen flora not becoming irradiated numerous times.  
---
Well, enjoy your ban anyways buddy. I'm sure it was from "bulking too many itemz!!11one!".
---
Maybe they could make a gunpowder keg that could go in the house , only able to put GP in it.
---
fireproof + dense torso mod if you're not using PA, lone wanderer (and maybe suppressor/tenderizer), nerd rage, dodgy (and action boy/girl by extension), starched genes and maybe class freak if you're using something like scaly skin. serendipity outside PA. barbarian and evasive if you plan on getting hit.
---
unyielding armor isn't as important unless you're using melee. sentinel/cavalier (mainly sentinel) is always good. just get adrenal reaction once you hit 30 (for starched genes), a bloodied weapon if you can find one and go to town.
---
the other perks go towards whatever is that you're doing. there's basically 3 variants: sniper, melee and heavy PA. you shouldn't be getting hit as a sniper with sneak, escape artist and 30 agi. look into str bonuses for melee, there are dozens: +str armor, chems, booze, radicool, party boy/girl, etc. and invest into sneak and ninja as well. heavy PA gets emergency protocols and is the best at taking down SBs.
---
Don't waste your caps. Just get a pair of T60 Legs with Calibrated shocks for them and use them on your X01. Save time and aggravation.
---
Much easier to find!
---
RC 
---
This happens when the PS4 is turned off improperly or in a rare case the application crashes 
---
That's not what *I'm* looking for, but I'm willing to bet that's the playerbase bethesda thinks they're going to lure to fallout 76.
---
Lol, the trailer looked beautiful though.
---
....my completion I am never thought of this...good idea man!
---
My main is lvl60
---
STOP! DONT PUT IT DOWN!
---
I had this too. The moment I deployed it to look at it, it fixed the weight and weighed 10lbs. From then on. It's the raider one from Rose, right?
---
If you have Pharma Farm, you can rack up chems quickly, which have some of the best price per weight around since you can't sell ammo....
---
Selling cooked meat also works pretty well, glowing meat is everywhere. 
---
Yeah...neither of those happened in this case. I hard closed the app that‚Äôs all. And then it was gone.
---
This happened to me a few days ago. I changed my DNS and MTP settings and that fixed the problem.
---
launchers should do atleast double the damage...my freaking shotgun does more than a rocket launcher
---
The weapon itself doesn‚Äôt show on the list in the weapon workbench to repair it.
---
Must be a freak accident then, shitty luck 
---
Let‚Äôs hope.
---
Today: Only the Tip.
---
Tomorrow: ...
---
At sertain point this game gave me a reason not to play it at all. Seriously, I can forgive a lot of things, but this game is just so damn broken in all aspects.
---
This is true but with the right build someone could slap damage u to death in seconds. 
---
I ran into a lvl 250 something.   He chased me down slap damaging me.  Pretty sure he was some bloodied build cause he always had low health.  
---
If i just stood still for him, he would take my health to near death in seconds.  
---
I don't even know what my char name is. Made it in beta, can't remember
---
I don't I wouldn't ever play again if they did that it's worse then bullet sponges
---
No they couldn't because that would require, at the very least, additional coders scripting their actions and writers writing their dialogue. That will still take weeks to plan, build, and implement.
---
And that's assuming they re-use existing models like rose or the vendor bots and they have zero voice lines. Otherwise now you also need animators to build and animate new models, and voice actors to voice new lines.
---
Maybe they wanted to have us to invest in the specific perks to get the most of our items , at the cost of sacrificing something in the build . Think about it : we have perks to decrease armor creation costs ( at Lv 2 you won‚Äôt have to spend ballistic fiber at all to create ) ,  to decrease repair costs and to repair items beyond 100% condition , and also a perk to decrease the rate that your item loses the durability. I agree that they need to tweet some items ( like energy and heavy weapons for example ) , but with the right perks you can have almost 3x times the durability of a normal 100% repaired item without any bonus from perks  ( 200% condition item with the perk to reduce durab. Loss by 50%) . 
---
Very similar build.

Paid 1k caps for mine, still doing Technical Data for a change for another one. 
---
Kill the sentry bots at Whitespring. There are usually 2-3 patrolling, 100% drop rate. 
---
Oh the gutsy.  The only NPC in this game where i have to decide if i wanna run or worth it to fight.  Lol. 
---
Any other NPC its charge and kill.  
---
Real robots have curves.
---
It is a common issue. Players do the BoS quest line and receive the full ultracite PA as a reward and since the chassis doesn't show the pieces, they assume they picked up an empty one, thus throwing it away/deconstructing it. That's why a recent patch gives you the blueprint - you have to find it on a terminal in Fort Defiance. So don't feel bad about it. If they figure out that they threw away valuable PA, they still have a chance to build a new one.
---
Darn.  I pray mostly pacifist and I‚Äôm 90% in excavator and super sledge (all rise cause it‚Äôs fast and weighs little) and gauss I‚Äôd love another armor but CARRY WEIGHT!! 
---
I wonder if people avoid me cause of of my looks now. 
---
Have you ever even fired or owned a gun? I have an assault rifle that I've had it for several years, and I've never had it break in my hands and had to repair it. It's not even realistic. That's the hilarious part about it. What is realistic or survival like about having to repair your weapons? cleaning them, maybe. But repairing them is just stupid. It is nonsense. 
---
The handmade is based on an an AK-47 or AK-74. which are some of the most durable guns in all the world. There are YouTube videos of people taking their AK-47 and tying it to the back of their car and driving around in the woods with it and they can still pick it back up and fire it. So please. Elucidate for me how this mechanic even makes sense??? 
---
I leave them where they are. I'd rather have a new player who likes to explore find them. Finding new plans is the ONE thing that we can actually display at our camps and finding a new one in the wild is one of very few useable discoveries in this game. but I know upper level players who collect them from the wild just to hand them out like candy.
---
To me this is even worse than regular p2w. Cosmetic items with time limited p2w buffs screw over all parties. Its a clear indicator where Bethesda is heading.
---
A pony? Fuck yeah. 
---
Seriously? I honestly seen total 2 people since I have had the game. And mabye 6-7 people on the ingame map. It honesty myswell be Fallout 5 with online required to play single player imo. 
---
There is and has been no interactions I have had either, good or bad from the people I did see either. I thought they were both npcs.. the way they was sitting. I thought they were bugged and then bam, started moving. Odd but whatever. 
---
Is there a site anywhere that tells which outfits are rare?  I thought the Greaser Jacket was rare when I first started playing and now I find them all over the place.  I just sold a drifter outfit the other day because I had three of them.
---
Thanks! If you ever are in northern Indiana PM me, I like to collect military firearms and oddities or out of the ordinary and part of the fun is letting other people enjoy them! I'd have love to done the work on it myself but unfortunately I don't have the time, resources, or equipment to do a conversion myself especially on a gun like the UK since it's a bit harder to do than normal but I'm glad to have it as part of my collection non the less
---
Probably rename my melee character to WannaSmash2077
---
Fallout 76 isn't at present a survival game, and I'm not sure it **wants** to be one. What it wants to be is an online game with lucrative microtransactions banking on the Fallout brand, and Bethesda simply doesn't have the pedigree to pull it off. They should have stuck to their strengths.
---
They've stated it's not a hardcore survival game so it makes sense.
---
&gt;Basically just saying that with the right legendary  fast melee weapon you can outperform the larger, slower melee weapons.
---
And a 40% faster swing 2H (with 30% faster swing speed from perk) outperform a faster melee weapon.
---
This is the main reason why i dont want to buy fallout 76. I hate balance system like these. Division have same problems on start for example and i bough it after 2 years when they nerfed  **bulletsponge** enemies a little.
---
I just found this a few days ago on a house just south of the vault. I don't think it's been removed yet.
---
Okay, so with that being said, why don't they just break after a certain number of shots fired from them but not actually have a health bar? I just think that's so stupid and silly. If I'm walking around with my assault rifle, how do I know how healthy it is? It's so silly to have a health bar for your gun and to degrade over time. All I'm really saying
---
This is awesome and creative. I love it. 
---
I was repairing my weapons in CAMP and I heard a Super Mutant voice - I thought that it was weird because I usually just hear them shooting at my generators. I finish up and go to check it out and see the back end of Chally! I was so excited I ran down the road like a kid after the ice cream truck! Grahm is awesome! 
---
Awesome, thank you! There is so much information in your post, it'll take a while to research the details. ;)
---
That would be great. Use a terminal in your camp to switch  between. 
---
Super frequently since the last patch. 
---
Thanks! Unarmed as in no weapon whatsoever?
---
Coat hangers and shopping baskets in Whitesprings will get you about 100.
---
Whitesprings, most of the shops have tons of coat hangers
---
Well, crap. I got tired of carrying two of them, and scrapped them for nothing...
---
I believe 800 - 1000 would be reasonable. But the main problem is the overall inventory management.
---
I may just have to do that, I travel to Ohio once a year to see family so I may just have to take the "scenic route" next time!
---
HELL. YES. I love that idea. 
---
Fallout teasers always get me so excited, I remember staying up until 1am to watch the Fallout 4 reveal, same for the Fallout 76 one. Atleast, Fallout 4 didn't let me down too bad.
---
Luck Of The Draw. I've only got one level in it but my Luck is at 6. I never repair guns. 
---
I went back to Horizon while I wait out the fixes. Gosh I forgot what it's like to play a game that just works. And it's so so pretty.
---
Slowly? Bethesda had perhaps the best early example of cash-grab DLC in the form of $2.50 horse armor in Oblivion. The outlash from the gaming community was significant. They later released the $30 Shivering Isles DLC which was fantastic [and as large as many full retail games today]. That helped to redeem them at the time.
---
12 years later the same developer is charging $10 to add pretty colors to power armor and $4 for a cowboy hat... on a game I purchased at full retail price. 
---
me and my group of mates have nuked pretty much every single spot in the game, nothing changes. Monsters in the area gets capped out on their levels, thats it. Monogah showed potential but it needs ghouls and someone to cheese the respawn rate by logging in/out with people outside of the spawnrange to work, even then whitesprings is better due to the work involved with monogah.
---
the only viable targets are Whitesprings and the prime site, nothing else is worth it.
---
there are no hidden bosses or anything like it in the game.
---
If you could go look again, I would appreciate it. I looked for an hour. It was pretty close to the downed plane and east of the tower. It was simple to find in the past. 
---
Grafton Steel ? 
---
Grafton steel workshop, capture it, set up extractors, kill supermutents and scrap their guns for steel. 
---
I farm supplies to make and sell healing items. 1400/day from vendors plus however much I can sell to other players.
---
Did you happen to have rad worms at anytime? Its causing wackiness to happen to stats.
---
PA armor has been weird for me last two days.  
---
Out if PA i was 203/255.  Go into my PA Ex and I‚Äôm 350/450.  
---
Worse part at one point i was farming had about 360 something pounds on me out of my 255 carry limit.  So i put on excavator to FT.  Now im 490/450.  WTF?
---
Lol right? What's the point of having a name when all you use is the gamertag, anyways.
---
Went for 10 minutes total lol. I'll be going back!
---
Must be a terrible shotgun.
---
And spent all your caps? LOL there is a 99% chance that gun was duplicated, you probably spent like 2000 caps on it. Also, if you don‚Äôt want to wake up and see your gun is nerfed don‚Äôt buy duplicated guns. Common sense.
---
Oo didnt visit there and if I did it was quick, thanks!
---
Well done! I'm holding that quest from Enclave, managed to start it but got stuck into a terminal after fixing the pipes, can't say if I was anywhere close to the end, I suppose not, gotta find some time to try that again.
---
Ahhhhhh a classic. I stop there whenever I can. Thanks!
---
It blows my mind a little that people are still putting up with this game. Stop trying to get blood from a stone and move on from this disaster.
---
It might be a couple days before I am on again, but I'll go look for it again. I remember seeing it right before I got stuck under the house.
---
Decide what type of build he likes based on your input. If he likes to be a sniper/sneak or melee or unarmed. Then go to [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com) and get familiar with the perks and what they do. It will also tell you when you can get the cards you want and at what level.
---
Certain perks work really well if you're in a team. 
---
Get a hazmat suit so if you're in a team and a nuke gets dropped on Whitespring you can survive.
---
Get him to fast travel on the higher player to discover the main places like Watoga, Whitespring, all the train stations.
---
RC
---
No one cares man.
---
Weapons weigh too much because the devs expected players to spec perk cards to reduce weight in the weapons they prefer.
---
I don't understand why a chassis doesn't change it's name after having PO pieces attached to it. I have a couple sets of different power armor and deciphering between them without placing down one set is impossible. It would be great to have a mechanic that allows you to put your suits of armor on show in your CAMP and equip them on demand - This would be an incentive to collect multiple sets and would generally make life so much easier.   
---
My camp has 40% invisible build budget spent,, I can place half a camp... I have atom shop camp items I cannot use because of this... Haven't played 76 since just after the patch when my camp broke... I was trying to change camp pets at the time &amp; the scorched sloth was terribly buggy, he would go invisible at the camp.
---
Exactly - can we stop this BS of pretending software developers are really struggling? They're making tens of millions of $$$ - enough to pay for the servers they're hosting for longer than the lifespan of the game so what Frowdo is going on about is cluelessly disingenuous. 
---
"Company's exist to make money" is another BS term used to try and justify BS corporations from worming their way in and subverting gaming to the shittest standards as possible and selling skins for $18 that look like they came from Wolfenstein 3D. I suppose Novelists exist "to make money", right? Film makers too? None of them do it because they happen to love writing or making movies, right?
---
"All this thread is asking for is QoL improvments" - which we've already paid for and the bug fixes that Bethesda keep screwing up - how is it that a "AAA Publisher" is this shit at producing a working product? Sick of these people screwing over gaming for the sake of money.
---
I've seen like 12 Silver Shrouds and maybe 2 Manta Mans but that's it. Other then the usual occasional Mistresses 
---
Ammo is NOT rare.
---
Their is currently a bug that if you are in pa when you log ofd you are almost guarantied an extra 100-200 inventory slots at least in excavator PA but yall need to shhh if bethesda sees this my favorite bug will be taken away 
---
‚ÄúOverherebythefood‚Äù does not like this post.  They apparently do not want to share their food.  
---
I had 3 cards equipped and only had lvl 2 game is so broken from last patch 
---
I saw a pairing of 2 once the whole week 
---
I have the shower because my base is on the Harper Ferry Bridge
---
I spawn on the very bottom of the River and have died to the server freezing, there's actually barrels of radiation up there too, may be useful for you it's a *huge* amount of rads
---
yet....
---
300 round mag?  I had no idea.
---
That is awesome! *Upvoted for Creativity*
---
I think 600 is fine but what I want is a vender cap limit increase
---
It seems to happen to some people more often than to others and I guess the location is really important. I got my camp in the mire on a resource node and it hasn't been leveled even once (FYI: If you build your camp with such a resource node within its perimeter, you can build a resource collector that keeps generating the resource it's on even when you're not in your camp). 
---
It's best you don't build your camp anywhere near the Charleston train station. There's a spot where random events can spawn - one of these is a rare, wandering protectron vendor that sells rare outfits and blueprints. Some players tend to farm it, which can be a lengthy process of repeated server hopping because the vendor, like I said, is a very rare spawn. Now, if there's a camp nearby, it will prevent the event from spawning entirely. So players who farm this vendor might be pretty upset about finding one there. Cue rage bulldozing.
---
I gotta heartily disagree on nerfing them and want more tough enemies.  As others have said gutsies are one of the few enemies that are challenging and their armor piercing rifles make me clench up by butthole even encased in T60.
---
Against most other things I feel overpowered which can be fun to.  But definitely this game needs more strong enemies.  
---
I can usually drop gutsies in 2-3 shots doing 400+ with a bloody explosive gatling gun.  Your 100 dmg handmade is why they feel like bullet sponges.
---
Yeah sounds good. Would like some reason to nuke other areas!
---
My cannibal got the herbivore mutation.
---
I began claiming to be vegan, but I cured the mutation and ate people anyway. When caught, I'd say something like, "Oh, like you've never cheated on a diet..."
---
Do you play with explosive weapons? 
---
I could agree with that, OP. Maybe also remove crafting resource requirements. It would allow you to build without hassle. Maybe even take out all the enemies so you don't have to worry about anything at all. They could call it Creative Mode
---
Hahahhaah
---
Maybe take a break. Watch the sub for new content.
---
Although you'll miss out on free atoms though...
---
If Farming Simulator was a FPS it would FO76
---
I never got why RPG FPS == bullet sponges... thats not how RPGs work...
---
You can have numbers progression and no bullet sponges or atleast only bosses/elites as kinda spongy.
---
Why not just make more diffitult enemies instead of fewer that just take a lot of time to kill...
---
Can we also tale a moment to acknowledge how short sighted and lazy it is to have vendors be exclusive in an online multiplayer game?  
---
I farmed the dead civil war reenactor until I had the plans to make the Civil War Tuxedo. 3 cloth 1 gold. Sells for roughly same price as Marine helmet.
---
Since gold is used very little in crafting you can usually find people willing to sell it or dump it to you.
---
Did you have rad worms? It‚Äôs making stats go crazy lol. When I had it my lockpick skill was 3 with only two lockpick perks.
---
Id sell you 2 calibrated x01 legs... if you decide not use the T60(which is a good idea) lol
---
How much...
---
I‚Äôm not sure make me an offer
---
After reading my comments I guess I came off as a bit smug. That wasn‚Äôt my intention though. However I will say that I‚Äôm really looking forward to pvp now knowing there‚Äôs so many pushovers in the game lol. 
---
I didn‚Äôt expect as much from fallout 4(I know many were dissatisfied with its story and I get why) because I had lightly invested into the fallout series, after like 1000 hours + of Fo 4 I got back into 3 and new Vegas, then buckled up to play the originals, so I was  really excited for 76,  liked each game for different reasons, new Vegas had a good story that resonates with old fallout fans. Fallout 3 was the first BethesdaGameStudios fallout and had my favorite version of the Bos, and 4 had a huge way for me to get creative and strategic with my settlements, it‚Äôs a shame 76 doesn‚Äôt have anything besides multiplayer and cryptids going for it...   time will tell though.
---
I actually did that quest yesterday and was dreading it after the last time, but for some reason I wasn't having any trouble taking them down. Of course I was melee attacking them with an Anti-Armor Deathclaw Gauntlet so that was most likely the reason. Tears through them like a hot knife through butter. My cousin and I still hate Gutsy's though.
---
This would be nice because it might mean there would be more value in different builds. There is no point right now in sneaking and sniping really cause uh... hidden headshot and you barely do any damage.
---
I saw that yesterday on ps4.  Thought i was just imagining it because i opened the lock on the first attempt so it disappeared pretty quickly.
---
Anyone know how to get plans for Vault-Tec Bed 2? I know it's after the apocalypse, but I've got so much cloth that it seems like I ought to be able to have sheets on my bed. 
---
Out there. Not in here!
---
The fix for unsolicited PVP is dedicated PVE servers.  FO76 now has dedicated PVP servers, "survival," with no damage restrictions.  Next they need to provide dedicated PVE servers, with PVP disabled completely, which is what "adventure" should be.  There doesn't need to be a middle ground that tries to balance both with the slapping and handshaking, just play on survival if you want or are okay with PVP.
---
I dunno if you've been particularly unlucky or if I've been particularly lucky, PVP-wise.  If my sessions were interrupted by PVP that regularly, especially as many as 6 times in one, I probably wouldn't have put as many hours into the game as I have.
---
Where did you find it? Ive been trying to do every hoard event to get one, no luck yet. It's really the only reason I'm playing still until I find one. Then I will just wait for new content. 
---
I guess, I'm the lucky one in this game when it comes to legendary weapons, I'm currently around level 120 (Haven't made any effort to level quickly), and I have looted 4 TSEs (2 Handmades, 1 Gauss, &amp; 1 Dragon) and 5 other with either TS or Explosive, I even got an explosive Hunting rifle the day after the Patch that added them.
---
I attribute my success to a specific method, My main character is a Stealth/Sniper build, and whenever possible I will go through areas with legendary enemies, and Cherry Pick them, leaving the rest undisturbed, which allows me to move on to the next location without the need to make time &amp; resource consuming repairs.
---
At this point I would estimate that I have killed around 1200 legendary enemies, and my experience has been that around 0.25% will drop an Epic level weapon, I got that type of drop yesterday at Pleasant Valley from a Legendary Super mutant that I had to chase for 10 minutes, cause he kept yelling "Run Away!" and doing so. I looted an Anti-Armor Auto Grenade Launcher, with +50% limb Damage, &amp; 90% reduced weight, which has me thinking about Perk adjustments.
---
It‚Äôs you. I managed it at 400 and go out if I need something, I have like 350 caps but I don‚Äôt go past that. 
---
Do it with a melee build. Easy AF.
---
I had to restart the game as a fresh character and see how much does it take to kill a single thing. At level 10 with level 10 hunting rifle with few mods it can kill most things in 1 or 2 shots with no perks involved, which sound absolutely right. 
---
Slowly they go from taking 1-2 shots to 3-4 and suddenly 50, where they magically become bullet sponges. taking about 12+ direct body hits before dropping.
---
I imagine the "difficult" change is made because the game wants the player to invest on perks but also not surprisingly, the game believes the player has access to weapons that can kill basic stuff in 1-3 shots which is possible by certain weapons (melee) or legendaries. (tse)
---
I can understand why a post was made when a player was frustrated about the scaling and that person is right. Bethesda is taking records from people on the top end, not on the bottom.
---
You forgot /s at the end, people are thinking your serious lol
---
For some reason I have not seen any Super Mutants in Harper's ferry since the last patch.
---
yeah, they've always been like 22k base price.
---
Probably not
---
You actually fight them I just reque not worth the time or resources post TSE nerf 
---
You could say my user name checks out üòè
---
Your title sounds more like BoS...
---
Gahhh i don‚Äôt ‚Äúneeeeed‚Äù the legs just the mods. I‚Äôd give you 1500 only because i think that‚Äôs a fair price for the mods solo and the legs are kinda worthless. I‚Äôve seen 750 for each shock mod being sold at a fair price. 
---
cheeseburger cake uses a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. although a power fist would be better. and his build isn't very good, mind you.
---
meat hooks are classified as both unarmed and 1 handed, by the way. so if you can get a bloodied one, you could use iron fist *and* gladiator.
---
I would agree but it's a nuke hot-spot so it'd be kind of shitty as a real hub.
---
Considering Bethesda have said they want the stash size unlimited, wtf is taking so long to add more too it? Considering all the crap you need to collect, 600 is as stupid as 400 was to begin with. If I want to store each set of PA, have some guns and have junk to repair and build stuff as well as store stimpacks and any other things, 600 is ridiculously low given the weight of everything. It's clear that Bethesda really don't know what they're doing which is surprising given all the games they've made. Did Todd let his kids just design a game from scratch?
---
I do actually when I‚Äôm not locked into limbs lol. I just gotta learn to stop hitting the right stick when going into vats. (Xbox player)
---
That's a shame, I would say I see on map 10 or so any time I connect. If I want some interaction I will go make the connection. Yeah sometimes they are non-responsive or afk but it generally doesn't take long to find someone to clown around with for a while. For example, this gal I met on voice at queen and I decided to go pvping/smacktalking for a while and had a hell of a fun time rping raiders and chasing people around with chainsaws.
---
Oh, nice, these are some nice observation skills!
---
I guess some people are happy with the current state of this game.
---
do u sprint allot that depletes them faster I just use 76 and my camp at Harpers Ferry for free fast travels then either walk or cheaply fast travel to the location im going   
---
My friends handmade he just got does the same thing.  He has to give it to one of the team so we can repair it and give it back.  Its not legendary either. Its just bethesda'd.
---
I agree with this, I thought it would of been a good idea if you could use a fusion generator at your base to charge them. But like, only your own one, not the in world ones.
---
I guess I will have to do that. 
---
At first I thought I would hate the survival mode in FO4, but it made the game more interesting.
---
I think FO76 achieves a good balance for a MMO where you can have players of different level and abilities playing at the same time.
---
It's the player freedom.
---
If ubisoft ever gets off their high horse, allows mods, and stops their stupid, one right method "story mission" bullshit they could knock Bethesda off the Throne for good.
---
But until.they finally understand that it's the freedom Bethesda offers, and not just world size...I'm stuck with this low effort jank.
---
Anyone recall how much/what flux is required to repair a decon shower with Contractor 2? Just wanna make sure I at least have that on hand.
---
Problem with any armor piercing modifier either legendary or weapon mod is that it doesn't affect energy resistance only ballistic resistance. I hope they fix that down the line...
---
That sounds like the experience I was expecting to see more of. I think after work today I'll prolly hop on and take your advice. Thanks for the good idea! Cheers
---
Well it‚Äôs an online game and kids will Horde 10,000lds worth of year and crap out the servers. 
---
More like Bore Ragnarok.
---
Rad worms is causing weird issues with everything. When I have it my carry weight gets maxed at 546 even though I have 720 in power armor.
---
Wanna try to kill him?
---
I've seen Morgantown nuked, plenty of glowing ones for exp 
---
the damage bug kinda made playing the game on my LMG character impossible. not only it takes twice as many bullets to kill literally every single mob, crafting them on 12 a pop is just not feasible.
---
not to mention just yesterday the game deleted my Harness for no reason. just gone, vanished. afraid my legendary gear is next.
---
Level 45 excavator with Calibrated shock mods and running all power armor mods carry weight of 675 pounds when loading in why are people still complaining 
---
*Names the Plasma Flamer "The Green Monster"*
---
Bethesda where is my weapon naming option!?
---
This may be intentional and is one change I support. Drain the fusion core reserve. Then normalize use rates.
---
Otherwise we end up with tons of "too easy" complaints from end gamers with hundreds of cores who are permanent walking tanks. I'd prefer to avoid power armor centric balance. 
---
after a while, you get used to grabbing stuff you need...kill robots and the ideas from others here.
---
youll get to the point that you're bulking it to sell.  I would really like it if they would just give us more storage.
---
Its a real bummer selling cool weapons/Armour/junk that i later could have used.
---
Same problem here my junk weights over 500
---
And it's just a pain if you get wanted and get killed and you lose all that precious scrap
---
Yeah I took the auto reciever off my handmade because it seems to proc the dmg bug a lot more an I was just slamming through ammo.
---
Thanks!  Now I can get these songs stuck in my head at work.  
---
When you get to the main menu and click characters it shows the name you game them.
---
I've had MP experiences where we just wave at each other and move on probably 50% of the time, the other half is other players ruining the game play and to be fair, not all the time their fault but if you show up where my mates are and we're doing a story quest, you ruin the game completely, esp if you're a really high level.
---
Bethesda ruined FO76 by making it an open environment where for some reason, other players can ruin ur base and easily too. Also remember that accorind to the in game lore, we know all these people and have done for decades as we all lived in Vault 76 together so WTF, over?
---
I would love to know how to stack foundations XD
---
I'm not saying I disbelieve you, but I am saying I'm thankful that that hasn't happened to me.
---
 Though now I avoid most activity (like workshops) that trigger it. Even though I really liked taking and building up workshops. The rewards are not enough to justify allowing another player (who doesn't even *want* the workshop) the ability to come to me entirely across the map and (likely) one-shot me.
---
Excellent write up! I really want to try this our now plus it looks like a lot of fun!  I'll want to try and get a Bloodied, Junkie's, or Anti-Armor. Quad would be awesome too...
---
Knowledge is king. Thank you!
---
His head is tilted down. You can see he cross shape on top of his helmet. 
---
yeah that is my main hangout...
---
I do think that‚Äôs a fair price but I‚Äôll probably just hold on to em at that price. Not in a hurry to sell I may be able to get more down the road. 
---
I feel like Ferrari bought the blue prints for a Pinto from Ford.  Then built it and called it a Pinta Farrini.  Out hopes were through the roof.  Then we all died in a fireball when someone backed into a mailbox.  Because the delivered a pinto.
---
Oh I see your point! Crap! That was the problem, yeah I always use the train station first, duh.....
---
Oooooooh.  Love the tile flooring.
---
You are a fucking idiot.
---
Upvoted for your amazing ability to stealth obvious sarcasm.

it's kinda disheartening seeing your weapon go through 10 *drums* carrying 75 rounds each to kill a crippled scorchbeast. but double that and it's just counterproductive.
---
my biggest gripe is the disappearing gear, though. I'm sure they're not fixing that anytime soon.
---
u can find two method on yt..

If I wanted to hide and strategize, I‚Äôd just go play Far Cry.
---
i would have executed him anyway.  once evil mutant, always evil mutant.
---
You'll end up almost spending more steel via ammo clearing it than you'll get back. 
---
This is why i keep a two handed weapon in my inventory. I currently use the sledge called "All Rise". Kills these suckers(Molemen) in three hits. It also changed the way i play the game
---
bumped cause I had to wait 24hrs before posting
---
Don't mind me, I'm just an asshole over here. haha
---
They'll be elbow deep in our...
---
Wallets.
---
Unless they patch the x01 enclave vendor server hop. Every other armor type was patched to not require server hopping to get mods. I‚Äôll give you 1700 but I might need some time to collect that
---
If you got acid, Iron Ore, put on excavator PA and look for iron nodes, each smelt to 5 steel. I make a run and find at least 10 nodes pretty close together which with excavator PA gets you 12 ore when you mine them. Put on super duper and smelt them, I get around 1k steel easy.
---
The trick is to carry so much random gear an pray something you don't use vanishes instead of what you use.
---
This is my big beef with the game. Primarily when combined with scaling enemy levels. If a high level player enters the area I'm in and triggers a respawn, I might as well just switch servers instead of blowing through all my ammo just to kill 2-3 enemies
---
happens all the time to me...If i need mats, then i setup shop, and keep going back to get as much as possible...then disconnected..blah.
---
im at a point where i can buy anything i need, so maybe go that route?
---
I'll scope that out. Just snagged that recipe from the forbidden knowledge quest the other day.
---
Once the last story part was done, the launching of the nukes that some level 200 player decided to ruin for us, we quit playing it. We enjoyed some aspects of the game which is why we kept at it but after it's all done, I really don't know why people want to punch themselves in the face by continuing with it. Just move on to something more enjoyable - why waste time playing a broken POS when you can play something you can enjoy and isn't frustrating.
---
If Bethesda can fix the game it's going to take months so check back with it then and it might be worth playing again.
---
You must be like me and used difficulty mods or overhauls in the previous fallout games. I miss the days of dying in one bullet and kill enemies with a careful headshot. I used to sneak in all previous titles and now in 76 I just mob around with no care in the world. Only issue now is lack of end game content and materials to repair. 
---
I‚Äôll be on around 6p eastern time...  If your still in need I‚Äôll hook you up for 1700
---
Back in October I would have disagreed. "It's simply part of the game," I'd have said.
---
However, now I agree with you so much it hurts. This game seems, to me, like it is just slightly off the mark on many small details, but they compile to cause a shitty experience for me. I haven't played more than an hour or so today over the past couple weeks because of it.
---
While I understand they have perk cards for the survival aspects, I can't imagine it would be too hard to balance them a bit by adding non-survival aspects to then.
---
OR, why not give the survival perk cards more umph, so that one could ultimately reduce hunger, thirst, or other survival things to zero? That would make those perks actually useful instead of 20% less gain at night which still causes me to drink every 5 minutes instead of 4 for half the time.
---
Suitcases at train stations and the till in front of vendors.
---
Work week. So I might message you back in a couple days 
---
Readed just "nerf" and "pvp" :D 
---
This will be so awesome... 
---
Np let me know 
---
I think I paid 12500 ea??
---
No. The semantic difference is that the item does nothing itself. The event does something.  
---
Because the item does nothing, The didn‚Äôt sell you a bonus.
---
This is all semantics.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work with an actual weapon because a weapon has stats. But it could be ‚Äúbonus damage when using a Christmas weapon skin‚Äù.
---
The game does now feel like doing chores around the house, sorry I get enough of that doing laundry and dusting. Bethesda doesn't want to listen to it's players.
---
I like the survival aspects, but I think they're cranked up too high in 76. Drinking every 5 or so minutes is a real pain in the ass.
---
I think it makes sense that Gutsy's deal that type of damage.  It is exactly what Gutsy's were designed to do.  They are front line soldiers that are supposed to take a beating while dishing out brutal punishment. 
---
That being said, I'd claimed the Charleston Landfill once and was in the middle of an event when it needed defending. I finished the event and thought, no big deal I'll just retake the workshop. Fast-traveled and because I had a mat down I ended up in the middle of 10 or so Level 50 Gutsy's. They shredded me within seconds. Ended up saying screw it. The landfill wasn't worth that level of pain.
---
180 and something
---
you see one you switch servers it the new meta post TSE nerf
---
Rarely, it‚Äôs mostly hammers. I‚Äôll slam a ghoul or something and before it hits the ground the body disappears. 
---
Yeah, there is a bug tied to this, I have found that if you walk away from the stash container (about 20 steps or so) and then return to it, the "Search" option should be there.  This works for me, but it is a pain in the ass.  Hope this helps!  
---
They are not a good developer and they do not have a good long term future.
---
For reference, I am talking about BGS, not Bethesda the parent company and publisher. I would happily work for a Bethesda sub-company like id or Arkane
---
Last night we were trying to do uranium fever.  Standing at the robot and could not get it to start.  Go to the map and is says pay 27 caps to join.  I bit the bullet so we could get it to launch.  It takes my caps then gives me 4 minutes of black screen and.....  Nothing.  We did not catch it at the last second either.  One of the group was farming mats there when it showed up.  We fast traveled to him and drew a blank.
---
Mole miners !!   They drop missile  launchers assault rifles shotguns.  Then sell to vendors. 
---
Otherwise as people said, cap runs ( not great anymore) cooked meats/ water and selling of ionized meat and flux.  
---
I have green thumb on 24/7 in the wasteland.  Last night I picked up 104 raw yellowcake flux alone  more than I could sell at all the vendors.  
---
Pro tip: flowers stay irradiated for a while after the nuke cloud disappears.  Easy picking. 
---
Not everyone duped TSEs and sorry not everyone wants to melee. A nerf of the TSEs sure ok but to the extent they have gone is a move to far.
---
FO76 sub-reddit is a lesson to other developers how NOT to make a game.... I' don't think I've ever in my life seen a game so badly produced by a supposed AAA publisher and then broken even more after they launch it.  We're talking Big Rigs quality here...
---
Beginning to come round to the same idea.
---
Very weird. Did you have any pocketed armor pieces? Maybe they cancelled out their own weight while worn but weighed you down unequipped when in PA.
---
r/SkyrimTogether
---
I am currently having issues when wearing my Forest Operative Underarmor with the BoS Bomber jacket where it clips right through the jacket.
---
Also if I'm wearing the BoS Fatigues with any BoS Field Scribe or Scribe uniform it makes the outfit look noticeably bulkier.
---
2-3k depends on recipe 
---
Tell me some yo mama joke plz. 
---
That's why the ones inside are at 0. The Whitesprings is like it's own faction so all the bots share the same cap pool.
---
I've encountered a few aggressive PvPers and maybe 2 or 3 just assholes and agree with the skepticism.
---
I've also got 500+hours and I almost always have at least one public workshop owned, thought not a highly sought after one.  I also regularly go to the bathroom, make some food, take a shower, feed my cat/litter box/random 15min of pets, and can count on 2 hands the number of times I've been messed with.  Last week I went to subway and back and emptied my unlocked resource extractors when I got back.
---
I use the Ammo factory for 556 and scavenge grind for SG shells its so hard post nerf to run SBQ and keep my TSE Handmade and TSE SG feed  
---
It just works.
---
If you have a couple decent melee weapons set up camp outside of one of the silos and just farm the robots and the items you find there. You only need to get to about the second step before you can walk away with a few hundred. If that's not an option yet you can just go to the mothman museum and kill all the low level scorched and stuff and scrap everything and every gun you come across. 
---
Yea nad thats what Nuclear Material is for.
---
Uranium fever - collect all weapons that drop and equip scrapper perk card
---
I don't think so, but that should show in Pipboy effects. Unless the real bug/glitch was that effects like this weren't being listed.
---
It isn't just you.  Those of us who have stored every tiny thing we ever found in Boston find 600 lbs aggravating af.
---
Totally agree. Instead of 1 shotting everything I'm 4 shotting them. Most things need shooting in the head, that's all.
---
4 charred ghouls can't be killed in 2 shots at the ground? Yeah they aren't supposed to be. 2 grenades before you're spotted, machine gun and finish with a hammer. A TSE shotgun isn't a one-size-fits-all any more.
---
Especially talking about the better ones: Adrenal Reaction , Marsupial, Healing Factor, Speedster 
---
It may be attributed to that random bug that occurs with robots where they gradually lose HP and die. I had kept the the Vendor a couple days ago for 3 hours straight and had no issues with him spontaneously dying on me. Of course we all got disconnected with the large influx of players coming by to roll for a rare outfit or Hunter's Longcoat. Ooof!
---
Yes. It doesn't work
---
Are you actually saying he destroyed your entire base with one artillery strike? If so I call bs.
---
What is that floor inside? 
---
How? 
---
Awnser: I am deep into the  purified water industry
---
I am into lore, but i do not like reading so much ingame. Is there any evidence that BoS killed responders for supplies?
---
Uh, what guns? A typical real world AK/M16/AR-15 (I dunno what the AK looking handmade shooting AR/M16's 5.56 rounds is really trying to be) comes in at 6-8 pounds loaded w/o a ton of crap mounted. If you're trying, you can get that down to under 5lb for an AR-15 rifle. The 10mm in my drawer comes in at 40 ounces loaded.
---
Gun weights are way too high and ammo weights are way too low. But ammo isn't widely available enough on corpses to fix that imho.
---
Their calibers are all out of whack too, and .308 vs .50 isn't the only one.
---
Taking gun weight and ammo weight into consideration together makes it somewhat acceptable, but no, typical guns do not weigh thirty pounds unless you're talking about a MANPADS (Man-portable air-defense system) or a minigun. Then some of the weights are well below realistic. And it's incredibly silly that the right perk cards get a minigun under the weight of a decent hunting rifle.
---
well, they need something to keep people playing the game. They should decrease walking and running speed too, so the gameplay time will be even longer
---
Didn't show in the effects page if I had it, but maybe not being listed there was the actual bug
---
He was probably a nice guy before the 'experiment '
---
I don't think so but they always roll into town and... heavily rely... on the local population for supplies.
---
Dude half the guns and shit have been nerfed due to the fuckwads like you constantly complaining ab it like really yeah its hard to get started and it‚Äôs frustrating but if you actually put time into the game you wont be getting pushed around and a Fist only pvp would fuck up alot of things. 
---
...and the fucking diseases like parasites and others that make you have to DRINK EVEN MORE! My God. It's ludicrous. I farmed 76 purified water. Went through it in a single day. 
---
I support this as a light armored stealth player.  I don't engage the sponge enemies unless I have to and I try to go for a one or two shot kill with my black powder rifle.   I often have to abuse the wonky ai by standing on a rock or car when I get spotted by a melee enemy, which seems kinda dumb.
---
Soon to be banned for expl0itz?
---
I think i am only one, who actualy like how bethesda done their game. 
---
I don't want separate pvp server that other players cried out.
---
I love pve progress and when i get super good character from doing this i want to use him in pvp too. Not to make new char.
---
I noticed my power armor helmet began to unequip when entered, after I played the "monster mash" event. The event placed the monster mask automatically. Since then my helmet never equips when entered and when fast traveling. Alternatively, this switched to the left leg on 2 occasions. XB1
---
Both burn though, so far I don't see any difference.
---
Are you trying to say uranium is a nuclear blackberry? 
---
scrapping looted guns is my method, get 7-9 steel per gun
---
Super mutant behemoths already exist so i dont see why scorched should be different
---
First off I have a Junk and vendor perk build that I use for this that gives me reduced junk weight, reduced chems weight, hard bargain, travel agent, and if you are building a route a bobblehead finder and capstash perk cards help too. Combine that with the Excavator Power armor with 2x calibrated shocks and I'm all set. 
---
Things I sell: Golf Outfits, Spacesuit, civil war outfits, ranger outfits, junk, chems, extra cooked and uncooked food (super duper perk is great for this) and weapons from enemies during the run. If you hit up Camden Park in your run, the scorch drop enough high value weapons to where I rarely need to sell anything else to Chad to hit the 200. 
---
Also all vendors typically have -something- near by that you can sell for at least 20 caps. Some have 20 beer bottles, some have burnt magazines and chems, some have burnt books and chems, food, or in the case of Enclave: Asbestos, since apparently every desk worker in the military ate cigarettes for breakfast... etc. 
---
Also planning your route so you hit easy cap stashes can net you an extra 200+ caps. for example there are two on my Enclave run that add almost no time to my run. Also if you hit areas that have super mutes, you can also get around 20 - 50 caps from them.  Collect Technical plans too, and add that in your hop between the free State's vendor and Watoga. Saves you a little caps on the hop and generates either stuff to sell or caps. 
---
Yesterday in about two hours of play I had generated 1900 caps, plus countless amounts of junk that's needed for today's run. Also, knowing what to scrap and what to keep for selling is another big thing. Hide Bundles sell for more than Bulk Leather, and weigh less. Scraping would only generate 3 Leather, so I leave those whole. If it wasn't for the current bulk scrap patch I'd never know about that trick. 
---
I play a heavy weapons build, so my day starts with a vendor, steel, and lead run. I've gotten it down to a pretty decent circuit that doesn't cost too much based on the route taken and the use of free fast travel areas (IE my camp, Vault 76, and my buddies camps if they are on.)
---
You also get caps for clearing out workshops. You don't even have to take them, so if you are near one a quick run through killing 4 - 5 enemies gets you 20 caps or so. There are also some events that are super easy for quick caps such as Gafton Day. So if you include Gafton as your responder run instead of Chad, you can hit two cap stashes, slay the monster, kill Muties, and clear out a vendor for around 300 - 400 caps for one stop. If you started at Vault 76 your trip only cost around 9 caps or so.
---
You'll start to develop a route, you'll start to figure out who to hit first that has a stash nearby so you can refill your junk between vendors, or which ones you just pick up all the weapons between TP spot and the vendor. 
---
One last tip: Tag oil. It's all over the place, and worth a ton when bulked. 
---

---
Why did you rush through so fast then? I am just level 50 now and still really enjoying this game. I am in no hurry and taking my time. I see so many around me that have multiple characters, many that are over level 100 and it just makes me wonder if you all are even taking the time to enjoy? I guess when I get to 150+ I might feel the same, guess we will have to wait to see what they have in store..
---
My Vampire's Fire Axe - can play lots of whack-a-ghoul till it breaks and never need to use a stimpak.
---
My mates and I came to this realisation pretty early on and kept playing because we found enough to enjoy about it but now we finished the main quest line we're done with it and only talk about it because we keep hearing how Bethesda, once again, have bolloxed it up. The workshops are entire wastes of time - go find cans of paint if you need lead or some toys and the baby rattle - for the weight, the actual lead weights aren't worth taking - iirc, a can of paint gives 5 or 7 lead for .5lbs (I made spreadsheets with every FO76 item and what component parts they had lol).
---
Having played hundreds of games across all genres this game is just weird. The balance is so skewed they must have all been heavily drinking whilst designing it because none of it makes much sense. It's like they hired people who have never played games before to design a game... How do you mess up the balance and values of everything this bad?
---
Thanks for that, I would have never put that together. Makes perfect sense now....
---
When I get on later I'll look. I'll save this post so I can get back to you
---
I have several Characters, and didn't realize until I started running 2 Xboxes, that you don't see the Character names, only the GT, since I accepted the Default name for my 1st character which is your GT.
---
It does help me keep track of them though, I have: Scrappy McJunkster (Junk Vendor), The Chemist (Chem Vendor), Blacksmith (Armor Vendor), More Medieval, (Holds everything I want to keep, cause I'm a FO hoarder), and I just created a new one last night named "Stan with a Plan" (Plan Vendor).
---
Bethesda stated recently that they would be introducing some type of support for Player Vendors, but so far all they have done is lock them down with the weight limit, making it no longer viable as you can't take anything in trade.   
---
I feel like if this is the case for you, you're just tackling content above your current level/equipment. This is still essentially a fallout game, therefore an RPG, and if you aren't high enough level to tackle whatever area you stumbled into, undoubtedly there is another area you should be in instead. 
---
I cried a bit too it looked so beautiful 
---
Nice!
---
That just might work! Be an asshole all you want but if people are paying 60$ for something, maybe they should have a say in how they get to play? Hmmm no, that would be too fair and make too much sense. 
---
Cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurse youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** KnowledgeHound99! ^(hug)
---
I don‚Äôt want a separate server either.  I just don‚Äôt understand what people miss when multiplayer and survival are main aspects of a game.  It is so much easier to let other people do the work harvesting resources then killing them for it, and since there‚Äôs no government left....  
---
I like the idea, but expecting griefers to answer honestly seems a bit naive. I'm a bit cynical right now due to a recent group-request-to-camp-attack issue. 
---
which is a survival game which is what fallout 76 is supposed to be
---
So... A military grade robot that was made to kill the best the commies could make is a danger to you.... Yea, this is total bs and should be removed 
---
Have you found the lvl 65 Annihilator Sentry bot.  He one-shots my tank char with 12 end with life giver and 400+ def.  Every time my melee starts to feel op broken fun, that bot pops out kills me and when i respawn its gone.   
---
I would be fine with keeping the 600 limit as is but then either allow us to sell our ammo to vendors OR increase the daily cap limits from 1400 to something else.  If you are going to force us to grind to keep up they need to make those adjustments. 
---
You can use the same char in the pvp server, if you want
---
Steel is usually the highest bulk item I get rid of at vendors, without farming anything. Must be the way I play, I didn't think steel would be a problem for anyone.
---
With scrapper perk, you can get 100+ steel from scrapping weapons from one instance of scorched or mutants.  Doesn't matter where, just preferably close to any form of workbench.
---
What is with players wanting god mode? Is this an age related thing? I am over 40 and I cannot fathom why someone would want to play a game that has little to know challenge. That seems more like watching a movie. Maybe one of those new choose your own adventure movies. 
---
This game is super easy. Crafting is super easy. Repairing weapons is super easy. I have more materials for crafting than I know what to do with. I have more purified water than I can drink. Food that just spoils. 
---
I actually like when my character gets thirsty because it gives me a reason to drink a few of the purified waters that are weighing me down or hungry because that canned dog food is just taking up space.
---
It seems like if I just walk around for an hour a gain a level, which only fifty levels in this game actually matter. Shoot, it seems like I get XP by just logging into the game. 
---
I take my leather armor and non-legendary .308 and go anywhere clearing anything without dying. I had a DeathClaw Matriarch come up from behind me yesterday as I was walking down a road. I thought ‚Äúoh maybe I will die‚Äù, I was excited about the prospect. Instead it did after several shots and a stimpack.
---
I hear the flapping of scorchbeasts and the thought of dying doesn‚Äôt occur to me. Instead the thought of dealing with the most annoying creature in the game does. 
---
This game is super easy on ‚Äúsurvival mode‚Äù.
---
Their armor pen probably actually works.  I remain convinced armor pen clips in player guns don't work, since they don't lower enemy DR according to the Awareness perk.  (which shows modified DR for every other armor pen effect/perk in the game)
---
Speaking as Hitler, "Ich unterst√ºtze Ihre Idee."

That's why i refuse to listen to Uranium Fever....
---
Bitch what? You're the one who came in being negative. Sure I posted something about how woeful it is, doesn't mean I want a circle jerk you fuckwit. My reaction to you, pushing your goddamn opinions on me about gaming and trying to make me seem an asshole because you are "obviously" the fucking starlight gamer that we all must listen to. Spread your toxic behavior with other toxics not randoms on the internet.
---
in over 200 hours of gaming my mates and I met one twat who just kept shooting at us which we ignored and 5 minutes later he got bored and ran off to start shooting at someone else. The very first player I met was as I spawned at level 1 and he was right outside the Vault 76 and was trying to help me - I've met 20 times the amount of friendly players than I have idiots but then the law of RNG means some people WILL get more than their fair share of griefers and some people won't.
---
well I feel the end game content is just the middle of the game and we just don't have it unlocked yet its still pretty early in mmo terms (though I will redo that generous evaluation in march when the first pve content is to be released) - that said I hit 100 and just made a new character who I'm actually very much enjoying trying out new ideas and loving the fact I just don't walk through walls of bullets spamming stimpacks 
---
and yes I used several immersion / increased combat mods that reduced hp but increased damage - nothing 1 shot 1 kill but around 4-5 heavy rifle shots which had a similar feel to fallout 76 why I'm using it as my basis 
---
Thanks for your information 
---
&gt;of survival and this is one of the things that make it.
---
The only thing that has trouble surviving is my patience especially when my screen looks like a half-psychedelic half-epilepsy inducing sequence of images because of multiple scorchbeast spam. At the worst of times the game has the tedium of a 9 to 5 with the challenge of kindergarten.
---
The variety of experience is so strange, and some people are monumentally unlucky.  
---
I've been killed maybe twice in PvP since the game came out.  I remember one, right after I hit level 5, trying it out.  And the other was when a guy was trashing my C.A.M.P. and I defended it, but he killed me.  
---
That said, no one who doesn't want to engage in PvP should have to by any measure, be it their character or their C.A.M.P.
---
Beth.  Listen to your peeps.  
---
This looks interesting.  I might try this one, thanks.
---
Was in the nuke silo last night and I had on all 3 lock pick cards and my skill was 1... Couldn't skip fixing the generator leak.
---
Also just fyi you can get to skill 4 in-game 3 perk cards and Tumblers Today 3 ( I think 3 anyway) which increases current lock pick skill by 1 tier.
---
Yes, I am *over* 300 hours, and I have 6 other characters as well (trying different builds).  I have been playing since Beta, and I spent a \*lot\* of time just exploring the map, helping friends (who are mostly gone now) and just fiddling with my camp.  There are some people with over 500 hours that are just hitting level 50.  I only run around White Springs if I happen to already be there when it's nuked.
---
Your experience is certainly different than mine, I have a stealth-based build, so running without sneak 3 would be kind of stupid wouldn't it?  I don't have a handmade rifle, I've had maybe 3 or 4 total drop in game and I scrapped them because they sucked for my build.  Wasn't about to buy plans to build them, but maybe I need to.  At 200% condition, my TSE lever-action rifle currently shows 196 damage, my hunting rifle shows 209.
---
I have everything that, as I understand it, should make for an excellent stealth/sniper build.  I swap perks in and out as needed for different purposes (lock pick, hacking, crafting, selling/travelling), but I have the following equipped most of the time when I'm just running around solo:
---
S: Bandolier 2
---
P: Concentrated Fire 3, Rifleman 3 (x3), Tank Killer 3
---
E: Aquaboy/girl
---
C: Lone Wanderer 4
---
I: Gunsmith 5
---
A: Action Boy/Girl 3, Sneak 3, Covert Operative 3, Escape Artist, Light Footed
---
L: Better Criticals 3, Class Freak 3, Starched Genes 2, Grim Reaper's Sprint 3
---
I have the following mutations:  Bird Bones, Chameleon, Electrically Charged, Grounded, Healing Factor, Marsupial, Speed Demon
---
**Seriously**: Tell me what I'm doing wrong with my build. I'm sure as heck not seeing it.
---
I agree.  Have fired 10s of thousands of rounds through my guns.  Replaced the choke on my shotgun a few times.  But its because i want a small pellet group.  Nothing actually broke.  Replaced the grip on my .45.  Because I didnt like the stock one.  
---
There should be a maintenance for weapons that fire lead rounds.  Gauss are a little different.  EM guns do eat themselves by design.  Lazer should be maintenance only also.  If they made ballistic guns break after 10k rounds with no maintenance, you should only be able to repair it to 85 % of its previous condition.  Meaning you should never let a gun break.  The only variable would be bashing with it.  Mele should just lose damage over time.  If you go too long and never maintain it you suffer the same consequences.   
---
yeah I'd like to see a quest like find technical data from the bos for vendors that lets us turn in random ingredients or ore to them for caps this would give us a additional cap source we could be on look out for 
---
Just ran this for the first time today (as a level 111 lol), because I was just putzing around the server looking for events to do.
---
It is still glitched. I only stumbled on this thread after 10 minutes of being stuck at defending Rover and deciding to Google if I was missing something.
---
What a garbage event.
---
Please fix the laser weapon durability issue? This has been known about since day one and has yet to be addressed in any updates or hotfixes. I know they've mentioned that it's a known issue but a lot of us have been holding these weapons with a strong desire to use them. Currently I get about 15-30 seconds of firing out of a 200% repaired Gatling Plasma before it breaks. Basically making it useless.
---
which usually ends up like so: people who are both arrogant and ignorant attack other people based on false premises taken out of own ignorance

Far cry is more action than survival game 
---
He destroyed all your stuff and only had a 20 cap bounty? How?
---
Why do you need to recharge them when you acknowledge in your post that they are so common in the world that if you are running low just pick up another one to replace it
---
I use workshops for experience farming.
---
If unowned I claim it, set up two turret towers with a welcome mat, stash box, and workbench.
---
I hang around for the defense quest then once complete I move on.  Usually after I almost forget I get a notice for the defend the workshop quest.  I fast travel back, complete the quest, then move on again.
---
Setting up extractors and gathering from them feels like a waste of time and resources.  I have also been disconnected too many times to ever set up extractors at a workshop.
---
I understand. I'm fairly decent level and always forget to swap to the perk. I've been crafting mountains of ammo and always need some to repair something especially doing nuke silos. (not for whitesprings or scorched eart but just random drops) I just thought I would offer that tid bit because it applies even for high level players that just can't seem to keep any. Idk what I have that weighs so much but I feel like steel is one thing I can never keep in my stash and my stash is always full. I recently scrapped a mountain of PA parts as well as dropped 90% of the guns I keep in my stash to finally start making room and I barely dropped under 500. No real armor pieces to speak of either. 
---
It was pointed out to me yesterday that the DR increase was only like... 2.  But you lost something like 40+ ER.  Cause Leather is just crazy high ER.  You'd think it'd be balanced a little more.  Robot and Metal being the massive ER and DR ones with minimal other.  And Leather, Combat Armor, and Marine Armor being progressively better balanced items.
---
But Leather has decent DR, and really high ER.  Plus the ease of scrapping level 1 leather crafted pieces at near zero cost (or sometimes gain) with Super Duper, Armorsmith, and Scrapper.  With very basic supplies (No plastic like Combat Armor requires).
---
Not sure what your point is, that it was the same then?  Because I played it probably 200 hours and never once used melee (or felt I had to).
---
There were a dozen other options than having to max out strength and use melee, which is currently the only functional build in 76, and one reason of many I finally stopped playing.
---
Why?  If he wants a specific spot pay the repair move cost then move back.
---
I agree on the cloth but for some reason I can never keep any steel. I do use alot of ammo and constantly need to repair my guns. They need to work on the heavy guns breaking so quickly. 
---
I don‚Äôt have a single energy weapon in my inventory for this reason.  Damage is low and they break too easily.  It‚Äôs a shame because I‚Äôve picked up legendary drops but I junk or sell them as soon as I get them 
---
Yes the enclave under armor adds plus 3 strength, and the 3 strength points stay on even while wearing power armor
---
I don‚Äôt use a headset, I just sent short messages
---
As I'm sure you've gathered there's 1,400 a day.
---
Alot of people chew it out through aid and junk.
---
Personally I do that and most of the 1*star legendaries I get.
---
I run a four charisma build with Traveling merchant maxed. 
---
I paid 800 caps for mine and don't regret a thing. They nerfed it to death anyway.
---
Yeah, plus Scrapper perk gives like 11 steel on larger rifles and heavy stuff, 4-6 on most other ballistic weps.
---
So that makes you 489 times upset now that you can add another bug to the list? You must be the most pacifist person on thye planet!
---
FO76 guns would never make it off the range.  By the time you sight in one it would break.  Rinse and repeat.
---
which is why I asked for a login / fast travel shield a while back 
---
basically we should not interact with the environment and be a ghost till we move meaning we can't take damage and we can't get rads this would let us go - ohh geeze I've logged into a nuke zone let me fast travel out or put on a hazmat suit and run or the map isn't loading and I see 27 mole miners let me give the game a few more to load 
---
this would simply fix the current in game issue and then allow for more complex concepts to be added 
---
I bought the game the day it released and I didnt really rush it, I just found it a bit easy especially at first. Things went slow up until lvl 40 ish then I started finishing up the main quest. I realized after I finished those I'd better go back and start on side quest as I'm a huge quester in games once I finished all the "one time only" side quest I ran out of stuff to do so I started continuously launching nukes because it was the only fun thing left to do. Once I began launching nukes (glowing ones were outputting 1k xp each) my levels skyrocketed I didnt intend on boosting levels so fast it just kind of happened. I wish that i could have started after the xp nerfs but it's just how my experience played out for 76 maybe it's more interesting trying to actually grind levels instead of easily gaining them. The sad thing is I didnt kill enemies in the nuke zones for the xp I did it all for drops...
---
That's how I do it, if you need to conserve ammo, farm lower level areas for guns off enemy corpses.
---
Have you never paid for a game before? I can understand, maybe, if you've only ever played FTP games before now, but how the heck do you think your entitled to make decisions for BGS for $60?
---
I can't get myself to fully re-roll for the 4th time. Right now I have two different mains 150 shotgunner, and a melee/PA 120. My first character I created was terrible at 54.... 
---
Before the patch all I was doing was farming queens daily and killing wanted people... Patch killed all desire to play till content is released. 
---
Congrats.  Now you can invest about 8 per points and damage will make it up to 120 or so, while a fire axe worth 2 coins will do 200+.
---
My wife and I are disconnected regularly, the game is virtually unplayable for us (we have two copies of the game and individual xboxs). I've debug our equipment and our network...  it wasn't always like this, we are both B.E.T.A users and server stability has become progressively worse. 
---
It's nice to hear your success with the game, but don't sh!t on others not as lucky.
---
Lots of people doing that, some with just a foundation and the needed parts.  Go checkout r/fo76settlements and there tons of examples of that, and the people getting crazy with the full builds.  I ran into one just outside Pleasant Valley train station a few days ago.  There‚Äôs a resource node to the east, and the owner was kiting scorched from the camps north and south into his turrets.  He did okay except for the lvl 46 that came in.  (I popped it from the train station, it‚Äôs that close)
---
I have never been killed by slap damage. Maybe save reporting for things that are actually report worthy like supers or people hacking or what not. The oh this guy annoys me so I must report him is just as childish as the guy snacking you while shopping. 
---
&gt; I am over 40 and I cannot fathom why someone would want to play a game that has little to no challenge.
---
I'm sorry but what does age have to do with this? You sound like one of those dumb old people that say "Well back in my day..." No one cares dude.
---
&gt;I take my leather armor and non-legendary .308 and go anywhere clearing anything without dying. I had a DeathClaw Matriarch come up from behind me yesterday as I was walking down a road. I thought ‚Äúoh maybe I will die‚Äù, I was excited about the prospect. Instead it did after several shots and a stimpack. I hear the flapping of scorchbeasts and the thought of dying doesn‚Äôt occur to me. Instead the thought of dealing with the most annoying creature in the game does.

---
But a FC generator literally runs off an FC how.do you expect that to work? If anything you will be lucky to combine lower ones into a full one. FCs are so easy to get. There are also 3 FC processors, the other day after a 2 hour or so play session I had about 50 full FC. You have to check back every 15 minutes though because they can only hold 3.
---
One of the things I have a problem with is junk. I want / need to keep a certain amount in my stash, just so I'll be able to make repairs, mod my gear and change my CAMP around, but even if I squeeze that amount down to a minimum and also bulk a lot of it, I still reach the stash limit quickly. 
---
It doesn't help that I have a small number of weapons that I will want to use in certain situations, but are not useful to carry around all the time. If I them pick up a few things that I want to sell... all of a sudden I can't fit anything in my stash, so I have to carry the stuff to sell to a vendor, but I'm overencumbered so I can't fast-travel... 
---
...and it becomes "Inventory Management 76". 
---
I'm not sure what would be a constructive suggestion in this situation. Maybe make it so that bulk items don't have a weight in your stash, but you can only hold, say, twenty of each? Something like that? 
---
I mean, they keep saying that the reason for the stash limit is that the game can't handle too many items on the server, but maybe a way to handle this is to change the way certain items are handled in the database? It seems to me that bulked items are a good candidate for this, since the indicvidual pieces of steel or springs or whatever that are contained in a bulk stack don't really need to be treated like individual items, just a number. Mind you, I'm not a programmer. I just have the most basic hint of understanding of programming logic, so I may very well be talking nonsense here :-/ 
---
Generally, PA is worse off than regular armor for PvP protection.  Vanguard Sentinel legendary pieces is probably the option if you're not into PvP but just want more protection unless you have a bloodied build.  Even with the TSE nerfs, you still want explosive protection as well, get a dense mod for the chest piece, and Fireproof.  Fireproof helps you in PA too.
---
I bulk and sell, too, but legendaries aren't scrappable and as you note, the cap limits on vendors means I log in every day regardless of my schedule so I don't miss an opportunity to sell off stuff. 
---
Yes.
---
Atoms arent really my thing I bought every emote and could care less about the costumes since I primarily play in power armor, but yes a break is needed. I recently bought GoW and plan on playing it until they release some new things like new mob bosses or raid bosses.
---
Its not. The majority of players agree with you. 
---
I guess so. At least I am not complaining about silly game mechanics. 
---
It depends on how you look at it.  I tend to think 76 has more "same character" replayability because you aren't necessarily locked into a specific build (although specialization is good) and having other players around means there's always some X factor that makes things a bit interesting.  4, unless you get into the settlement system, doesn't have too much beyond the main quest.  If you want to try a different faction, you have to replay the game with a new character.
---
I never got into settlements because the endless settler clones and defend quests got very obnoxious, but I like the CAMP concept because it's *my* house, or whatever I want it to be, really.  I think they could greatly expand on it.  I also think, PvP awkwardness aside, that Workshops are a better expression of the settlement idea.  I get something out of the deal, and the defend quests are more predictable and far between.
---
Another thing is that the Plans system in 76 kills alt characters because they don't carry over.  I'd never want to find or buy all that crap again.  If the Plans did, I think it would make replays of 76 more interesting, because now your low-level character could have access to hardware you wouldn't have had before.
---
I‚Äôve only had it happen twice, but I‚Äôve always just blocked for session and that‚Äôs it.
---
well this is supposed to be survival lite (not really seeing the "lite part")
---
to me this means that if it takes a lvl 5 enemy 5 shots from a lvl 5 rifle it should take a lvl 50 5 shots from a lvl 50 rifle this keeps the game balanced on a rising scale so that players get the same level of danger from day 1 as end game without the bullet sponge effect 
---
also it makes lower lvls able to shoot up higher lvl npc enemies with a higher xp boost since they now stand a chance and can scale the game a bit to their liking 
---
At whitesprings, it's the blue tree sap and the silt beans (and possibly something else - maybe glowing fungus?).   
---
If you start at Whitesprings station, you can sometimes get two sap locations depending on where the nuke landed (one across the street north of the station, and one across the street west of the station). You can also find silt beans along the street south of the station, and at some other spots around the periphery of the zone (I don't recall exactly where). There's some glowing fungus (it turns red, forgot the name when nuked) at the corner of the garage building just east of the back entrance to the bunker).  
---
When using Green Thumb perk I can  usually get enough to make two stable cobalt fluxes.
---
It was always minda boring honestly. With all the backstory and places nothing really happens and you just walk around wondering why I should even keep playing once you seen it all.
---
I save my *tough* enemies for Night - Mr Sandman is a nice swap-in and I craft Blight Soup (+20% Crit Dmg).
---
I just got a few for free from a duper a while ago.
---
A buddy and I got the vender to spawn. And while shopping with him a few 200+ guys showed up. We let them have a turn shopping once one of them was done he pulled out a pump and killed the guy then proceeded to shoot as us. An hour is server hopping for the vender was wasted lol
---
I end up crafting throwing knifes to get rid of my steel.  4 steel = 1 knife.  It scraps for 1 steel.
---
When I see my steel get over 800 I do this to get it down to around 200.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Well from what I've read you are supposed to be able to nuke certain areas for specials bosses (eventually) I wish they would work on that before pvp or dlcs but I'm just one opinion so it's a small voice to be heard. 
---
my high lvl char (100ish) sees pretty much just all glowing versions but my lower lvl (28) still see's the normal versions so I'm guessing its more lvl scaled 
---
unless I was told wrong (haven't specifically checked personally)....or they changed it....weight reduction perks dont work on stashed items.  Or rather stated as "Stashed items are always full weight".  
---
That's what I was getting at.  Now: you're right about weapons that share special focus, but I see no reason not to carry the weapon with me in that case.  Yes, I have to change perks to use it effectively, but that can be done on the fly easier than visiting stash to completely change my loadout.  
---
The point about not stashing weapons was more about not saving legendaries or weapons you aren't specced for (unless its specifically for trade, and even then you have limited space for it).  
---
Final point...not all of us play melee.  I actually have been reducing my STR, I think i'm going to stop at 11?   Anyway Im focusing on PER and AGL for sneak and snipe.  Its....less efficient end-game against boss level enemies, and I know it.  But I find it more fun for general running around.  That and I tend to avoid PvP, so I dont need to bother with optimizing for that either.
---
Yep
---
The world isn‚Äôt fair. 
---
I have not, I despise guns in real life.
---
But things break in real world, even guns, so it fits fine. You walk thru rad storms and dive thru radiated water, and then shoot hundred bullets in the face of a super mutant. It can't do any good to your guns. Also, these weapons are selfmade or really old(pre war).
---
And this game is far from realism in many ways. Realism is not why we play these games.
---
Thank you for the map - I'll go looking some more. I get lost on this map sometimes. I thought I had found a new place in a tougher part of the map and found I was at the twin houses.
---
Thanks again.
---
&gt; Using the jetpack or marsupial in PA you feel like a literal walking tank.
---
I think you meant *flying* tank. 
---
A little while longer and you'll stop booting up this disaster altogether. It's a damn fucking shame, but in the end it's just a computer game and there's many more of them that are of a much higher quality in every aspect.
---
Looks really good OP nice job 
---
Yep multiple times now, I have killed legendary and bosses and went up to loot and no bodies were there...
---
I keep about 200 of each crafting material and sell the overage.  That's generally enough for whatever I may need to make on a given day, and it keeps me under the limit.  
---
Now if we could out home fast travel points down you could seal it off and be worry free from some random ass coming and destroying your stuff.
---
It used to be really common for the plants not to change especially the ones on the west side of whitesprings. 
---
Ask for friends only mode. There will always be another asshole with a new way to be an asshole. Controlling who you play with is the only real solution.
---
Funny how the raiders are against this idea....
---
I'm psychic and can 100% accurately predict the future of this based on what has already occured.
---
Write this down:
---
" *^(It will piss people off. ")*
---
Lol I was also hit with the crew 2
---
16 times the detail!
---
I beat all three DS games in 2019. It's even gotten so bad that I've beat DS1 5 times already.
---
Standard ballistic ammo is pretty light, even without the perk.  Missiles, Mini Nukes, 40mm nades, and fusion cores...those can add up to a lot of weight fast.   In 3 and 4 I tended to hang on to every bit of ammo I'd find, even missiles and nukes, because why not.   In 76...can't do that.  Missiles and nukes are HEAVY.  
---
Fusion cores....those I have a harder time not picking up every one I see....And my stash and inventory both suffer for it.
---
You can have both, reactive plating is a torso mod and calibrated shocks go on legs. 
---
A really cool CAMP! Enjoy it berore fireplaces gets berfed :'( 
---
I feel like after someone kills you a number of times there should be a cooldown period befor they can engage I'm pvp with you to prevent people from going after the same person multiple times. I also think there should be a limit to how many time someone can go for revenge. If I killed you 10 times give it a rest. It isn't fun for me anymore it's just sad lol.
---
How does being able to find a stat-boost item in game with the same texture change, in any way, the fact that they are selling a stat-boost item in the ATOM shop, after specifically stating that they would not sell stat-boost items?
---
Maybe if fanbois weren't so easy to delude they wouldn't keep pushing the envelope
---
I feel u 
---
Ahh understood, they say they are in it for the long haul. Would be nice for them to add some high level content to keep players around and interested in the higher levels as well!
---
The game is actually really great. It has some issues, and a bad launch with a lot of instability and bugs but really it's great. They have messed up some things with patches also, like cap stashes and stealth to name a few, but they are only human. If you get a really good build, mutations and really good items you are like superhuman. It's awesome. I love that feeling.
---
DS1 is definitely the better one, but DS3 is just so damn pretty!
---
&gt;  My level 70-something character gets murdered 
---
I really don't get this.  EVERYONE is even after 50.  You might need a few more cards so 60 for full build.  I have killed level 200s with my level 40.    Its not like they get ANY benefit from being higher then your 70'.  You really want then to stop turn around and crit them in the face.  You will get the first true damage shot and if your build is at all decent, they will be dead.  I have done this 6-7 times and always just laugh at how dumb you need to be to try to slap someone to death.
---
yeah, I know, only got the caps for 1 though
---
I would love this even if its a slow charge as proposed here - doesn't replace workshops or other means but allows one to top up partial cores to full over time.  Just make a CAMP fusion core charger - 1 core at a time, will make me a happy happy camper!
---
No
---
I usually keep cloth &lt;100, but I crafted a bunch of lvl 1 armor and BOS undergarments for vault newbs last night, and actually ran out. It was the first time I've ever had to farm cloth.
---
its really not as bad as it seems think of it like this 
---
at low lvl it took 5 shots from a lvl 5 hunting rifle to kill a lvl 5 super mutant - that super mutant needed 10-15 shots to kill you - it would simply keep the same level of play across the entire game 
---
so a lvl 50 hunting rifle kills a lvl 50 super mutant in 5 shots (or 1 head shot from stealth) and he still needs 10-15 shots to kill you - you just would have the same level of danger through out the entire game rather then just at the beginning and walking around in power armor by end game fearing nothing 
---
&gt; yeah, I know, only got the caps for 1 though
---
I know weapon weights stack but I dont know if it ever makes it to 100% I think 1 takes 20% then the next takes 20% of the new number, so on. Make sense?
---
That sounds pretty pathetic. 
---
People keep forgetting a game needs to give you a reason to be hooked into it. For me its the lack of really a good story and characters and the lack of really any interesting quests is crazy. Coupled with the worst endgame in anygame what is there to keep you ingame really thematically than making up something.
---
Guess what
---
This is what you signed up for
---
I forget what level you need to be but once you can get a tesla rifle get a strong friend to walk you around whitesprings and use it to tag all the ghouls 
---
I wasn't saying use the generator, I meant a new piece of equipment that would be a charger.
---
What do you mean by they don't have a good long term future? Have you studied their engine/work?
---
Hahaha yes!!! Same here. Still do it sometimes end up shooting their leg and that just makes them fussy. 
---
But yeah, it's a give and take. Usually the issue for me comes when I have variety of enemies. Because if I hit right stick it goes to the head shot of humanoids, but then it stays on the head of robots, but their heads aren't usually the weak point. So unless you can get behind then and left twice instead of once for the combat inhibitor, gotta switch back and forth to make sure I'm not wasting rounds. Probably analyzing this too far lol
---
This game will NEVER function correctly as a pvp.  It will be like having Serena Williams and Tom Brady swap jobs.  Shit just aint gonna work no matter how hard you try to make it.
---
This got me thinking...How close to Fissure Prime can a CAMP be? Might be helpful if someone could drop some crafting benches and a stash box nearby during a SBQ fight.
---
Honestly fo76 is kind of an mmo and if you've ever played an mmo (even runescape) it takes forever to get to the end. I didnt necessarily rush through the game at all like I stated I took plenty of breaks and I havent logged no where near 150 hours I'm level 157(hence why I said "lvl150+) if it would have been that long I may actually be satisfied. I was just stating the game doesnt have enough to offer for a full fledged online game... have you ever played ESO I've spent months on there and still havent came close to finishing the game lol
---
Nah, they have been aggressive with the ATOM shop since launch; this was the plan all along. (Remember the bullshit brand new never before seen items that were somehow "on sale?").
---
I strongly doubt there is any management belief that the game is "going down," and that's exactly the problem. They see nothing wrong with their game plan.
---
If carebears put pacifist mode on, with the intention of not doing PvP, and their playtime reaches 10 hours, they should not be allowed to fast travel PLUS their stash size is reduced by 50%.
---
Seems fair, right?
---
C.A.M.P.ing "its a legitimate strategy"
---
But yeah take it from borderlands public play and farming don't mix well so ask for a friends only mode.
---
The thing is, everyone enjoys games in different ways. What's important to me (a beautiful camp and daily challenges) and not important to me (doing storyline quests) is different for others. 
---
The approach to items and stash upkeep is the same. I'm glad your stash approach works for you and you're having fun, but some people enjoy having more stuff to play the game in ways they enjoy. 
---
How about just being able to combine partially spent fusion cores? They could give the C.A.M.P. fusion generator a fixed energy storage that you could charge and discharge using fusion cores.
---
I like how the kumbayah I threads about all the positive interactions are wilting away as the grim reality of online multiplayer sets in
---
I too, wish for a server full of Garys
---
I've only got the first rank of Dromedary and Slow Metabolizer and I haven't exactly been starving or parched.  I've never died of hunger or thirst in my entire playthrough, in part because the game gives copious warnings and because solutions to the problem are easy to come by.
---
I actually think Bethesda balanced that aspect quite well.  It's not so slow that you stop thinking about it, but it's not so fast that you feel pressured to get through everything as quickly as possible.
---
&gt; Selling players a time-limited buff for wearing a 'cosmetic item' is considered pay-to-win in some circles. 
---
You mean the circles who use dictionaries and have an understanding of language? I dont see how anyone could argue that it *isnt* pay to win.
---
Until a naked idiot runs up and one shots you with a legendary rolling pin.....
---
Newsflash:
---
Your requests, pissing and moaning, complaining, and all out ridiculous ideas have fallen on deaf ears. Go play another game.
---
No its a chump move people who do it suck in the game and in r.l 
---
Bullet sponges have been an issue for a while. FO4 was severely plagued by this, and it crippled many weapons when they rolled out survival mode. Then they ported the entire combat system  over to FO76 and added the absurdly short breakage. It's just bad design.
---
 " I didn't think steel would be a problem for anyone. "
---
Lol- machine gunners are junkies with the needle still stuck in their arm, m8. 
---
People will refuse to accept it because of EA even when it looka like it actually had a ton of work put into it so it isnt a cookie cutter br game.
---
It's only activated once for me. It always does the supermutant gang one instead. 
---
How dare you question my belief! I should have you killed for that!
---
I actually want it to take more of a new Vegas stance. They could have made explosive a crafted round so you would burn resources to get the effect. Would have helped the whole way out of balance thing. 
---
Yeah it does. Though if you have two of those armor you could unequip them and see if each reduces the same amount of weight when you reequip them or if it is less with each on added.
---
What are you talking about? This game is a clone of FO4 with multiplayer and cooperative capabilities. If they made FO4 cooperative it would have the same functionality as FO76. 
---
I think what you want is your own private game where you a developer doesn‚Äôt have to worry about server load, game mechanics, and playability for a large amount of players. 
---
As I said I'm a hoarder (fallout 3 and 4 left their marks on my inventory) just thought it was an interesting idea.
---
But it is the same game. 
---
I collect iron ore around the Abandoned Mansion and Hornwright Testing Site 3 in the Ash Heap. Smelt it while using the Super Duper perk.
---
Which is what I've been screaming all along but only now, at the end, do you understand
---
No, but i do marvel at the seemingly endless parade of human beings whose lives must be so devoid of worth, value or consequence that they incomprehensibly find purpose from spending even a millisecond hating on something that has zero impact on their lives.
---
Not related to the perk, bodies are just disappearing way too quickly post patch.
---
I had 2 pieces with wwr and each one reduced 20% of base weapon weight before mod weight weight.  So for example with one handmade weighed 16 instead of 20 with 2 it weighed 12, then the weight of the mods was added on to it
---
Player freedom serves no purpose when there's no choices to make.
---
I do have 2. I haven't done the math on it but if I remember next time I'm on I will check for you. 
---
Yeah I would be pretty happy to see raid bosses or something that actually takes a full team to kill that scales to the surrounding player levels. Making a good challenge. I also feel like their rarity on specific item drops are way to low and placed on the wrong mobs. You can literally get any gun from any legendary enemy on 76..
---
I dragged mine around for the first 40+ levels. Now I have a static base with an acid node. Makes mining so much more convenient.
---
yeah I would love a pack brahmin to indicate I'm a traveling merchant to players at a distance and show me on the map 
---
The one time I got it to activate it gave me. 44 Mag.
---
Loading screen was "loading" yesterday for 17 minutes.
---
I find it almost impossible to NOT check my pipboy when I start off as I almost never have the weapon drawn that I need to use.
---
I do like the game, but these two things make it hard.....
---
Almost as fascinating as yet another shoddy camp, screenshot with a Scorchbeast or showcase of your outfit!
---
All my armor is deep pocketed.  That doesnt explain how it worked completely fine for weeks then last two days its not.  
---
I do have mutations, i had no diseases.  
---
The low caps available at vendors and inability to scrap legendaries means my stash is hovering near full at 600 and that includes me vendor hopping daily, six vendors (I never find Grahm). An increase of vendor caps or increase stash to 1,000 would probably fix things.
---
How anyone is giving more money to Bethesda is really beyond me. You people are like those fat people enablers, the people so fat they can't feed themselves - feeders! That's what they call them I think. Pay $60 for a $15 early access game then reward the corporation that made the game even more money so they can carry on making awful games like this rather than completely boycott the store so they get the message that this kind of behaviour is unacceptable..
---
It's like paying to have someone punch you in the face.
---
They also crapped all over Christmas - who the actual fuck does that.
---
Maximum reduction is 90% for any category. Some aid items do not have their weight reduced (like bobbleheads and magazines). So, if you run max travelling pharmacy and max thru hiker then -20% chem, food and drink weight reduction on armor has no further benefit. One piece of junk weight reduction stacks nicely with max pack rat since pack rat only goes to -75% junk weight.
---
Sounds like someone needs a life.
---
You seem like someone who outta play farmville or something else.

---
Really appreciate the help mate, will report back if anything changed :D
---
yeah I agree but its "supposed to be" kind of deal more then action they just didn't balance it right
---
honestly I think with some weapon and enemy balancing we could see a lot more fun game play in the future for fallout 
---
Right, for example, in subnatica you could literally grow the materials for a replacement or build the chargers. I built the rechargers as soon as I could. Literal cut my farming in half
---
Yay, I thought I was the only one politely seated and waiting. I don‚Äôt say anything though. It is worth it sometimes just to see them turn around and see me sitting there...
---
That could work to.
---
# become what you hate in others.
---
Yeah, but if you push the pause button in the middle of the trailer and just stare at it for a while, it gives you a remarkably accurate depiction of the game crashing,  so...
---
Shorthand term for that is "multiplicative" stacking instead of additive stacking btw. 
---
Seeing as in pacifist I still got one shot not that fair :/
---
Oooh - I forgot about Horizon... i may pick that up instead of KH3 this weekend...
---
yeah, he's totally ruining the game economy with his pyramid scheme
---
If damage number and armor number are equal, the weapon deals half of its damage. This scales up and down until at 6:1 you are maxed at about 10%. (But it is weighted towards damage more than armor.)
---
Also it would cut down the need to farm for them, or server hop when low.
---
I don't consider myself a huge hoarder, but I do keep 100-200 of most scrap, and maybe a few small pieces of apparel or light guns (like Blade of Bastet and Voice of Set, though honestly, I might ditch those). Up until the endgame, this was mostly fine. But as I've done more and more nuke zones, I've found my stash getting fuller and fuller of stabilized flux, which is kind of hefty. I just haven't gotten around to using it yet, and after the work it takes to get it, I'm damn sure not selling it yet.
---
They definitely need to increase the stash limit, or decrease the weight of flux (among other things *cough*rifles*cough*
---
Ah, wasn't thinking about that. I have a hard enough time keeping steady 5.56 for my semi handmade. Couldn't imagine for heavy guns.
---
Why are you still playing it then? Are you that deranged you can't let go and find another great game to go play? There's plenty out there! :)
---
Buy the shocks first. The increased carry weight will make it easier to collect junk to sell to vendors while you save up for reactive plates.
---
honestly if you have a 150 and a 120 I'd recommend a break I don't say that as some kind of snarky comment but serious I just don't think it was made for people that play that much I'd probably come back after next patch I do that in a ton of mmo's and it works really well for me as I cycle different mmo's as content is released 
---
I mostly say this cause if you burn out its really hard to get back into a game even if new content is released and it fixes old problems and I'd rather you enjoy the game in the long run 
---
Alternatively, just a way to transfer charge from one FC to another. That would let you top off FC's by depleting other ones, which still provides value to grabbing all those 50% FCs, if for no other reason than to charge the ones you already have (or to make 2 50% FCs into one 100% FC)
---
I'm ok with farming even, just would like to reduce my list of fusion cores at 9x% to a single stack of fully charged 100% cores.
---
And also cut down the need to farm for them when they are gone.
---
Allow me to illustrate: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngtALzDAIcU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngtALzDAIcU)
---
Still bummed tumbling tumbleweeds got cut
---
Very Nice
---
I have had been griefed almost twice a day when i log on, my camp is at a very secluded area and is nothing but a plank of wood with crafting work benches and it still gets wrecked, im just walking through the road minding my own business and i still get shot at and killed, maybe my outfit you ask? Well im wearing a vault suit with leather armor on and nothing else that stands out. I always see at least a few wanted players on the map, hence me avoiding those areas preventing me from progressing through the quest line. As the OP i am an adult with a real job and real responsibilities. And yes i do understand IRL there are assholes, but this isn't real life it's a video game in which its main purpose is to entertain, and thos type of BS isn't entertaining. If people really want to be a tough guy then do what i did go into real battle fields and you will quickly realize the value of human life and the grief that war and destruction brings. 
---
Ahh, I use the shocks because I hate becoming over encumbered in a nuke zone, for the torso I went with emerg protocols because I run a bloodied build. Ive heard that reactive can inadvertently trigger pvp so stayed away from them. I'm curious to hear what others say. 
---
I see where that would be useful but I have a large set camp only because I love my location.
---
Buy the fusion generator plans from a vendor. I just got them 2 days ago, I think it was Watoga or Phoenix. I also got the large 10 generator too. Take one of the power plant workshops and put down a fusion generator if the power plant isn't operational. Put a level 3 lock on it and try to hold it for a few hours, I think it's 3 per hour.  Put the generator off the ground in case mobs destroy it during a defense event and you can't get to it. Contractor level 2 perk is great to have for this.
---
I agree with you. Also this is just the latest one, progressively it will get worse and worse because devs wont stop selling half made games. Think about when they made Starwars Modern Warfare ... lol remember the issue with those loot boxes? 
---
this will keep going on until people find a way to stop this spending ... whoever has the "free money" to burn on uncompleted games.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I also found one a few days ago.  Fought and killed it, (it's got a weird attack style - I'd take almost no damage for a while, then suddenly my HP would drop significantly - couldn't tell if intended or bug).  Like you, no notable loot.  Not only that, but the fucking thing died in a position that allowed it to be obscured by foliage, so I couldn't even get a good pic.  At least I got a good pic of the hermit crab with the lobster bus on its back.
---
Just saying, you can get console banned for this. If you go against the terms of service, which trying to circumnavigate a ban is against the TOS, that can result in a console ban. 
---
yeah I was personally am thinking this would be best solution 
---
Fortunately for my Stealth/Sniper Character, I also have an Instigating Death Tambo (196 Base Dam x2 1st hit, x2.5 sneak bonus = 980 Damage 1st hit, which is the highest Damage weapon I have since the Patch that destroyed all my Explosive weapons.
---
The hot chick spinning with the two 10mm submachine guns.....
---
No hot chicks.
---
10mm subgun sucks.
---
HAAAA!  Thats awesome man!
---
Its very easy, turn around crit to the face, pick up trash, leave 1 item, drop trash in stash.  Use invis on top of the bag, kill asshole again when they come for the bag. 
---
&gt;What is with players wanting god mode? Is this an age related thing? I am over 40 and I cannot fathom why someone would want to play a game that has little to no challenge.
---
I don't think it's age, as much as gamers today are more impatient than ever.  They are so used to having everything handed to them on a silver platter that they don't want to deal with learning curves or setbacks.  Throwing a temper tantrum is more cathartic.
---
That's not to say you can't make a game too grindy or tedious, because you certainly can and for some players, Bethesda has really tipped the scale in that direction.  But there is a lot about 76 that isn't obvious, that the game never explains, and gamers don't have the patience to figure it out.  Whereas, I think for more experienced gamers, the "figuring it out" is part of the fun.
---
There's been nothing to do once you get the story over. The repeatable quests aren't much fun and don't drop any decent loot anyway. The game hasn't changed in any significant way so the same "nothing to do" has been there all the time I suppose some people don't notice it for a while and keep playing.
---
I know it's hard but gradually slim it down.  I've learned what I can do without and it's good for me.
---
This isn't the only aspect that takes adjusting to in 76 but it's a big one.
---
I understand it might be harder to have it auto-name a PA set with mixed pieces, but if it is all one kind, (Ultracite, Excavator, Raider, T-whatever, etc.) then it should mention it.
---
It sucks enough after the last patch this went from my daily game to a game I only play if my one buddy halfway around the world invites me. Having everything nerfed into the ground was plain dumb and made the game far to grindy to be enjoyable to me
---
/u/tzube25, If you're sad you missed out on the totally awesome Ultracite Vents, I'll trade you the plans for your TSE minigun, though you might have to throw in some caps to make it even...
---
That'd be nice to (would drop my 78ish to probably about 28
---
@bethesda
---
Friends only mode. It's the only effective solution to multiplayer assholes
---
You must be claiming a workshop. There's workshop hunters out there who will start to claim one that's owned by someone after marking their position (mentally) on the map, then when they try to claim, you both get flagged for pvp vs each other. 
---
Have you tried Kingdom Come Deliverance?
---
I thought we were seeing the character names (that explains a lot...)
---
get ready to be disappointing the next time you loot her. and the next. and the next. and the next.
---
Funny thing is I mob with people that are 270+. The team I have actually had a dedicated healer.... We all just waiting for new content... It's definitely disheartening since every patch we get a tiny nerf or alteration to things we feel never needed changing. 
---
Might just build new houses LOL. Just saw a video of foundation stacking and pyramid houses XD 
---
I swear i'm the only person on the fallout 76 sub that actually enjoys the fucking game
---
The place is becoming a second r/fallout
---
See heres the thing about "raiders" you dont get anything out of it so you arent actually raiding when yoy destroy someones camp.  Its just griefing.
---
It's a dog eat dog world man. Sometimes you can defend yourself, sometimes you get raided. It's hard in the waste land 
---
I keep the batteries included perk to make them light weight and just snag them all.
---
That said I'd like to see the lowest fusion core to be used first rather then the most full 
---
But I want to kill you. Then use the chump change of my 5 billion caps from legendary duping to fast travel across to the other side of the map. You don't really want to pay 50 caps to come after me, do you? /s
---
This kind of base is like a wet dream to me because the entrance is at the top(presumably). Bro, you gotta show us the insides as well!
---
Yeah, working on that. Slimming down my inventory and all. 
---
It‚Äôs just a learning curve is all. Once I get it mastered I‚Äôll probably wonder how I made it so far with the old system lol
---
Won't work there will always be assholes with new ways to be assholes. The only real fix is a friends only mode.
---
I'm not sure thats entirely true. The scorch beast queen is a total bullet sponge, taking several people to take down effectively. And that's end game content meant for players who are at the high lvls. I agree with what the original poster is saying, add some sort of condition where certain enemies fair better against different kinds of damage. Hell, have a boss that only responds to certain damages when other criteria has been met, such as shutting down the power on Colter from the Nuka world DLC. 
---
Also, I'm sorry that was such a long comment man. I'm usually pushed for time but I'm early and waiting for the school run to begin haha. 
---
Buttons?
---
Switch over to the the other view for the pip boy until it gets fixed 
---
It‚Äôs a terrible patch 
---
It is FO4 without 'human' NPCs.
---
And personally, I love it.  The environmental storytelling is great. I turn off ALL chat audio and play solo.  Probably not the 'indented' way to do it but I'd wager there are far more people that play this way than many realize.
---
Yep that be so much better get rid of the lowest ones first.
---
needs Boss man [https://www.youtube.com/attribution\_link?a=hJLDXmXPKJU&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAk8xeI6KpU0%26feature%3Dshare](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=hJLDXmXPKJU&amp;u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAk8xeI6KpU0%26feature%3Dshare)
---
There's a West Virginia/Crystal Meth joke in there somewhere...
---
Anti armor legendary mod plus AA perks is 95% damage resist reduction is too broken if they reduced DR. But yes CND needs a buff
---
Take a look at the amount of comments on Reddit here (or lack of comments)  - everyone's moved on pretty much. The only people playing now are the ones who are more OCD than I am ;)
---
Im pretty sure buttons arent made of crystals
---
wow yes
---
I'm not sure but stealth is a little wonky right now. Got messed with after patch 5. I run a sneak build and now I cant seem to stay out of danger even with escape artist and 3 chameleon pieces. Even from pretty far away. 
---
So where do you find these explosive weapons? 
---
Just the name of that mod entices me to go back. Sim settlements was the shit. 
---
I have played all of them except Tactics.  I agree that melee's effectiveness has ranged from viable to OP.  I think my reasons are logical though you are free to disagree.  I believe than in FO76 melee is overbalanced towards the OP side (as are certain specific non-melee builds) and some 'nerfing' (a rebalancing which decreases its effectiveness -- along with some buffing of some ranged weapons) would make for a better game, in that the number of default 'goto' builds would be reduced.  Melee is just too often a goto build as it is, mainly because of the damage as compared to ranged, and a lot of that has to do with stacking buffs to get OP strength levels which raises melee damage to demi-god proportions.  Of course ranged weapons do not have anything comparable to that that increases their damage (and they shouldn't).  The problem is that it is too easy to stack strength buffs to get high strength levels and super damage.  Put a cap on how high the strength bonuses can go, or reduce the number of strength buffs you can have in play at a given time or reduce the base damage of melee weapons and it would help even things out a bit. There have been a couple of posts recently regarding how things could be made better by adjusting damage resistances and from what I read that might the best overall solution.  I know folks like being a melee demi-god but that gets old and makes what is an easy game even easier with no thought to tactics which you don't have to think about if you can just power your way through everything.  This is fine to do once in a while, but not all the time.  
---
Excellent Service, Quick, Friendly and very Helpful! Awesome Trading Shop and location as well! A+
---
Happens to me too. I just take it over again on the next world. If it's taken on that world then I got to the next one. One day I server hopped 5 times until I found one that was free but that was a month ago before everyone 'quit'.
---
Agree...I'm really hoping for some sort of 'adventure' map instances that would be PvE only without some of the 'survival' mechanics.  
---
I was being sarcastic, but if it bothers you then you really need a friends only mode. Griefers gonna grief they will always have a way to interfere with your farming if you can't control who you play with.
---
I stopped playing and will not resume until stash is infinite (at least for junk).
---
The whole point and drive of these kind of games is to do a run, collect ressources until your bags are full then stash the ressources in an ever increasing reserve of growing prosperity and possibility.
---
Think minecraft or terraria : imagine those games if, when passing by a juicy shiny ore depoait youd pass, because you know you cant stash it. It defeats the whole purpose!
---
I dont care that I have already enough iron : the feeling of collecting and growing the supplies is what makes those games engaging.
---
Unless I can engage with the game in this way, I dont see the point in playing. 
---
Fan Fiction for a game that gives you perk cards specifically for wrecking other peoples' shit.
---
i have a plan for marine torso i'd barter with you for, if you're interested.
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to build but still early.
---
Drop all fusion cores except five. You're welcome.
---
Totally the same game.  Like our shirts are the same.  Except mine is green with a collar, long sleeves, pearl buttons and silver cuff links, and yours is a dirty wife beater.  But yeah, they are like, so totally the same.
---
Yeah I was really confused by that since I only started using butchers bounty because the patch mentioned it and 3 ticks spawn at my camp like every time I log on. It‚Äôs worked for me ever since the patch.
---
Also funny that I killed my first SBQ this weekend (from full health) when OP mentions they are still bugged, but I suppose SBQ fights have lots that could go wrong. 
---
Nice! Is concrete stronger then metal? 
---
Somebody has never played XCOM
---
Cool, what platform and what's your GT?
---
I stopped playing but still follow the sub hoping for actual improvements to the game, i really liked it but all the nerfs and bugs killed it for me im hopong like hell the fix it and it becomes fun again
---
Honestly 600 is perfectly fine. If you dontbhirde and keep what you need, you will barely break 400. I have on  hand 200ish weight allocated just for random stuff to hold into for others. It's not hard to manage your weight. Hoarding is a hard habit to break. I don't understand how people can play this game constantly overencumbered. Long story short, weight, like greed, is easily managable.
---
It's not rare, but once you get to liking one specific weapon it can get to the point where your going back to your camp to make more every other time you venture out into the wilderness.  
---
Im not crying about Griefing lol üòÇ i PvP mostly what you on about ? üòÇ 
---
And we'll call this button "friends only mode"
---
Psst. Nobody's listening. Go do something else. Have you ever lifted weights? Lifting weights will make you strong, can keep you busy, makes you tired, all of which will solve your current dilemma.
---
Oh you're the person that guts every fusion core generator in the wild. 
---
Sees outsides "Wow this looks like the chichen itza, hey thats neat"
---
sees inside "Oh my god! thats sweet!"
---
This is something I always found bizarre about Fallout 4 and it carried into 76 as well.
---
The thing is, you don't really need 78 Fusion Cores.  Of course, I don't trounce around in Power Armor very often, but I only have about 3 on me for emergencies and I've never had a lack of them overall, even without Batteries Included.
---
Doesn't hat only really work for pistols though? I might be missing some perks since I'm not at the game right now. 
---
Sometimes in this game you just eat dogs. Has a nice bonus if you have the Carnivore mutation.
---
oh, i never knew! Thanks - gotta go get that :-D
---
Not a bad point there. 
---
The mods that cannot be applied to arms once learned from scrapping are:
---
1. Aerodynamic
---
2. Braced
---
3. Brawling
---
4. Stabilized
---
5. Weighted
---
I think this is because Armor\_DLC01\_Robot\_ArmLeft "Robot Left Arm" \[ARMO:0010F375\] and Armor\_DLC01\_Robot\_ArmRight "Robot Right Arm" \[ARMO:0010F373\] are missing the keyword ma\_armor\_Lining\_Robot\_LimbArm \[KYWD:00508D83\].
---
The Division 2 Beta starts on Thursday and the first game is cheap right now. I highly recommend it. 
---
They can be.  :)   If you want to be shiny.
---
Agree...the drinking and disease mechanics can be really annoying!
---
It locks up completely, doesnt even give you the option to toggle which view you want
---
Only work around is to not open it until you're sure everything is loaded , but I thought I post it here anyway so bethesda might see it
---
Yea it's a little weird right now. Works about half the time or less. Before it was great I could get spotted go run and crouch and almost immediately get out of danger. Now I can be in a different room out of sight completely and still not lose danger. 
---
Yeh that's pretty crazy . It's just not worth weight to carry a launcher. -_-
---
OMG I hope they don't fix this! The reason being not for walls but for building on a hill that is like 1 pixel higher than foundation height. I have a building currently and the front is max height but the back runs into the uphill and I can't make it any higher. That might not help as much, but my other one the hill goes *downwards* more steeply than the front at ground level plus one foundation height. This could really help make things look better. 
---
I like the CUT of your jib
---
There is?
---
Same thing happened to me. Spawned in and had about 15 scorched hitting me and I could not do anything for like 10 seconds.
---
Not really just the general discontent people seem to have about other people getting in their way. Be it pvp, leggi resellers, trolls, inconsiderate high level players that don't clean up their spawns etc. There is really only one fix for it all
---
I'm annoyed my two shot explosive was merged. But at least now it's not the only way to do damage. It doesn't solve the bullet sponge problem, but I think how strong they were was a problem in itself. 
---
Which would be powered inevitably by the fusion gen :)
---
Where did I say I think Bethesda is bad?  I like Bethesda, they have made some fantastic games and I have thousands of hour playing them.
---
In spite of the increasingly toxic community, I would still prefer to play the game.
---
Are ***you*** still playing the game?  If so, why?  What keeps ***you*** playing?
---
I really hope that gladiator is a miss click and you meant to have martial artist.  If not that is a really shitty pick.
---
The plan *Plan: Pocketed Marine Armor Chest* is mis-named. It does not grant you the ability to make Pocketed mod on Marine Armor (that's learned from scrapping). It actually grants you the ability to apply the Deep Pocketed mod, so the plan is mis-named. It should be named *Plan: Deep Pocketed Marine Armor Chest*.
---
It is mosaic tile. It was a limited offer in the atom shop. So glad that I scooped it up too
---
Ha ha yea, this is exactly why I wanted to try it before I couldn't anymore :(
---
Well I earned my gear and that takes awhile. When I was still at 66 I literally had nothing good. Revealing all the map points, doing the dailies, world events, taking all the workshops at least once, farming for camp plans, farming nuke zones for gear and weapons.  All that takes awhile and levels add up pretty quick. 
---
Sounds too me that if you‚Äôre only at 66 and bored then maybe you bought all your gear and weapons, or you‚Äôre extremely lucky and got them without much farming. Or you just don‚Äôt like the game...
---
What differences are you seeing? 
---
The Excavator PA for me on PS4 will have an extra 100 carry weight for a period of time when I first log into a server, this has been happening since I got it way back at level 25, I'm currently 123.  Last night I did manage to contract rad worms and my carry weight shot up to 615!  I also have the speed demon mutation which also got juiced up with rad worms so I was zooming around the map like the Flash it was great!  I actually really like this new rad worms bug
---
And yet its survival elements are more successful than Fallout 76 
---
Yes Sneak/Stealth is current bugged.  It's not horrible, but it has an issue.
---
This happens with workshops too. I had a workshop that was totally barricaded and high level super mutants spawned inside. It was fun killing them, though.
---
I could use some .50 cal; lost 3.5K last night fighting SBQ which ended in massive failure.
---
This is sweet, I might try building something similar over the top of the cave next to vault 76 for an entrance you can only access through the cave 
---
Maybe.   I'm certainly playing less now.
---
Guess my expectations were to high and now I've been playing in denial that one day they will add more :p 
---
Dig it! Nice
---
It's a bizarre juxtaposition, to be sure. Not as weird as the Division though, which fancied itself a tactical shooter but also had bullet sponge enemies. 
---
Scroll down ;) I thought about entrance at the top but then you can't get out... not really practical. There's a "secret" tunnel at the base that goes under the foundation to a door
---
I run with a lot. Maybe 8?
---
As a .50 cal user, steel is my #1 drug. I literally have to do a steel run about twice a day just to be able to do any sort of playing üôÉ
---
Fornite may be more exciting for you.
---
It does help, but sadly sometimes it just doesn't provide for me man and its soo annoying. :O
---
At least it would be a paying job then.
---
I usually get scorched at Harpers Ferry, but last night there were super mutants again.
---
Ya probably I‚Äôm working on sneak build right now but want to have a complete unarmed build 
---
I run 8 aswell
---
Even better! How long did it take for you to finish it?
---
Given the easy access and cheap plans - I can't see why anyone will ever power up a nuclear plant again now.  Even before, it was such a chore to power up the plant, that people did it for the plans and never did it again.  Plus they never seemed to give more power to all those power boxes either.
---
Its indestructible? But I wouldn't really recommend it. It has weird pathing and enemies can clip through it or something at the seams. 
---
All of them.  It is great.
---
I'm not seeing how this is a bad thing on the defender's part. Are they just supposed to let you have the workshop?
---
Awareness and Long Shot are not necessary for a vats-crit build. Take all the riflemen perks, tank killer and concentrated fire. I scope most things I know I can kill quickly and vats-crit the tankier stuff.
---
I've found that the Bowie Knife is kind of like the Gas Mask with Goggles.  It only shows up in the Modify/Repair list when it needs repairs.  It probably has something to do with the lack of mods for it.
---
Must have, neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed.
---
There are certain enemies that it might be acceptable for, maybe some demi-bosses and the like once in a while, but I agree it is overdone as it is.  Maybe folks that recently posted about adjusting damage resistance have the right idea to help tone it down.
---
Why make it so easy? 
---
I have definitely been eyeing my other Fallout games in recent days.
---
Without business you would have nothing but the clothes, that you made yourself, on your back.
---
Unlike the Robot Armos and Legs (and the other armors like metal), the Robot Torso is completely missing Material 2 (Enameled). So it cannot be learned from scrapping, and thus a player cannot change the material of the Torso to Enameled. The other materials exist and are fine (Material 0 / Standard, Material 1 / Painted, Material 3 / Alloyed, Material 4 / Polished, and Shadowed).
---
oh yeah, my bad
---
Run uranium fever and scrap all the weapons they drop.  
---
What‚Äôs ur gt
---
Lol yeah. 
---
All in all I like it. Gunfu is so much fun, taking down the 7 or 8 scorched running around looking for me. I have a sneak build so sometimes in just there in the middle of them with the head shots. 
---
I have an AAE lever action and even with the nerf to explosive damage I can one or two shot 90% of the people who try and pvp against me. I dont even use demo expert so ranged builds can still be viable melee is far from the only way to go
---
I agree. Power armor should be a "only for real dangers", not a 24/7
---
I don‚Äôt see the point of the atom store. I made all my atoms by playing the game, and only bought a couple things. I never will pay real money for these things cause in the end it‚Äôs all low effort stuff. Oh look, a hat that was in FO4 for 800. A suit reskinned to have vault tech logos on it, 800. Meh!

I did buy the hot rod PA stuff cause it was new and I wanted PA paints of some sort. I also got the chromed minigun cause it looked cool, I use miniguns and it was cheap.
---
Selling old FO4 junk = lame. 
---
Selling reskinned boring clothes = lame.
---
Making new items = ok lets talk
---
i‚Äòll just sneak into the Eastern Regional Penitentiary. I think it‚Äôs Cell Block A. Disarm the 6 tincan traps. Each trap has 9 tin cans. 6x9x2 = 118 Steel and 54 Lead per run. A run takes about 2 minutes. 
---
Absolutely! I'm working on a summary of these thoughts from the community. Thank you for the tag!
---
You call it *your* game... what keeps you playing?
---
Shocks First. IMO the reactive plates are underwhelming. Have been testing our other options. Kinetic Dynamo for a Melee build is useful for target rich environments (queen fight for example) as the hits will recharge your AP meaning near endless power attacks are possible. Stealth Boy is good is you are running a sniper type build and need PA for a rad zone (or because its awesome). Of course Jetpack is good too...

Bead work?
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote but we have the shooting part but the looting leaves a lot to be desired. Fought SBQ last night, failed, was unable to loot anything onsite, continuous wait circle.
---
I don't fault them this model.  They're not going to charge us an ongoing fee to play (although the assholes at PSN will do) so they are paying with purely cosmetic item sales.  
---
I don't have any issue with this since I'm patient and can save my 10 Atoms a day from picking flowers. :)
---
Hopefully we at least get some decent content.  However, it is odd that they haven't really announced anything.  Bethesda usually has a pipeline of DLC ready to go.  Maybe we will be pleasantly surprised at some point?  Not getting my hopes up though!
---
Turrets on all corners please!
---
Looks amazing! 
---
Sadly can't use yt at work (though reddit works XD)
---
thanks!
---
Super sledge bass damage..... so metal
---
Yep. Used to be a sniper, then I got three ranks in Bear Arms. Now I am a heavy gunner with 6 Plasma Gatling guns, 2 Fatman, 50 Cal, LMG, missile launcher, Gatling gun, 3 cryolators, and a harpoon gun. Sure it is expensive to maintain all this stuff and stay stocked with ammo, but I never want to go back, it is too much fun.
---
This isn't a serious gripe, right?  Turrets defending a workshop...crazy, I know, but that's kind of the point of turrets.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs the reason i can‚Äôt repair my Groknaks Axe to 200%?
---
I‚Äôve really been enjoying Vampire: Bloodlines, it‚Äôs as if Oblivion and FNV had a baby set in the Vampire universe. I just started it though so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs as long as either one. 
---
The tick blood definitely works though, I‚Äôve been raking them in all week. 
---
Speaking of Grafton, along that same line - always kill the Grafton Monster when you see it.  He's usually worth upward of 20 Caps, and the two spawns in Charleston are only Lv. 10.
---
Broken weapons, fucked up perk chart, assed up camp budget, no storage, no story, no npc's, paying out the ass to travel around the map, inability to recoup money spent at vendors.  And the list goes on for days.  But like you said.  Totally the same game.

u/BethesdaGameStudios_ u/Ladyanndev can we expect a fix to the random missing cap stash search option and the random cap stash missing spawn issue? (Post Patch 5)
---
I'm on pc. Sorry.
---
Is this a PC thing? I'm on XBox with over 500+ hours and haven't had any issues with other players?
---
Next month, probably.
---
I bought The Inspector costume because I thought it was kind of cute and then discovered I can't wear it AND my Treated Marine Under Armor at the same time so I wasted 800 Atoms. Submitted a ticket to Bethesda, asking them to either fix it or refund the Atoms, but of course neither thing has happened.
---
Won't buy another thing from the Atoms Shop now.
---
I so want to steal your idea and make this!! I wish you could have two camps because I already love my little home with it‚Äôs tatty garage doors and metal walls. Did this take up your whole budget?
---
I hope Bethesda don't "Fix" this foundation stacking.
---
Reported wrong sub
---
Ugh..jackasses like you are absolutely why we need an 'adventure' or PvE only mode. 
---
Even though you are 'roleplaying as a raider'...you are ruining the game for others and your 'roleplaying' is a lame excuse. 
---
There is no reason not to collect 200 caps from vendors. If you pick up junk laying around outside the station and sell it you will get to 200 caps. There's no need to have items to sell. Walking away from a vender that still has caps is just pure laziness. 
---
How are your purifiers set up?  Went I considered it, I plopped a bunch of industrial purifiers in a lake and I was hard-pressed to get more than 1 out of each of them in an hour of play.  It seemed like there was a hidden cap.
---
I've since moved back to my original location and plopped more small purifiers (the ground ones) and they seem a lot more reliable for some reason.
---
When crafting a full set of studded heavy leather armor, the studded heavy leather right arm is using the wrong texture (or material swap). It is using the texture for treated? instead of studded, so it looks different than all the other studded heavy leather pieces.
---
Yeah, that, teddy bears, bobble heads and comics.  They didn‚Äôt really thing some of those things out.  
---
I read that in his voice, thanks!
---
Legendary items I'll never use, perishable food, chems I'll never use, non-perishable food, excess junk. 
---
In that order. Most days I usually only get to selling some chems.
---
XDDDDD ecksdee
---
So kill the turrets and then claim the workshop? Unless you think you're entitled to someone else's turrets like some gawd durn socialist?!
---
nice
---
I know exactly what you mean because I had the same issue. I just left the pip boy on the digital view and ever since then I‚Äôve had no issues. 
---
bethesda has a roadmap of the objects of the atomic store the only thing important to them 
---
Four hits to kill a  level 5 supermutant lmao
---
My problem is that I have been running with groups alot lately and tend to not pick up as much scrap when I'm in one. Especially when doing silos or nuke zones. I need to set time aside to just go and scavenge by myself to get my steel reserves back up lol
---
Balancing issues make up 10% the other 90% is the random people you meet. We need friends only mode.
---
But grabbing a power plant and making them yourself is fun. 
---
Corpse down the stairs from the vault.
---
Something special about stuffing a dead guy full of cranberry stuff.
---
There are some quirks to the PvP system and how flagging works which some can abuse.
---
Source-
---
But, slap damage is capped at 5 dmg/hit iirc and it does take significant time to kill a person if they havent agreed to PvP. There is no such thing as one shotting someone without them conesenting to PvP. There are some ways though, that you can unknowingly flag yourself for pvp. Its tough to kill someone in pacifist, unless they are actually afk, but it is possible.
---
A. Workshops- if you have claimed a workshop and someone attempts to take that workshop, both you and the attacker and anyone on each of your teams are now flagged for pvp with each other. No first shot consent is needed, even with pacifist enabled.
---
B. Teammates- if any teammate is not using pacifist and flags on a player, it flags everyone on both teams for PvP with each other, even if you have pacifist enabled, you will still flag for PvP.
---
C. Explosives- if your not in pacifist, the aoe from explosive affix rounds and explosives can tag another player, especially melee users and flag you for PvP, this can happen easily in heavily congested area's like nuke zones and whitesprings.
---
Im mid 300 hrs and have only been griefed 3 times and in each occasion it was because of a workshop, and usually they go after my alt vs my main. That said some people are bored at the moment and griefing others for fun and because some want to see the game fail.
---
My advice to you is if someone is griefing you or or ruining your base, block them and swap servers, if you use the block option you should never end up in the same server as them again. And keep expensive to fix items like your decon shower stored except when your using it, and get the Contractor perk under intelligence, it drops the amount of materials needed to repair/build camp items. If your camp is moveable, you can also move where it is for a cap cost and it will repair your build w/o materials.
---
I have 15
---
Hmm okay, I'll give this a try, thanks
---
Yes.  White Springs is extremely laggy for me.  I play on PC.  4790k at 4.5GHz and a 1080ti.  It's an optimization/driver issue.  My GPU usage goes between 40-60% around that area when it should be more like 95-100%.
---
I'm skeptical of your skepticism.  
---
Pacifist mode doesn't affect the damage other players do to you and your camp.  It doesn't dissuade with TSE Cheatguns from killing you and razing your camp.  It just makes it so you don't accidentally do damage to other players.  
---
If anything, pacifist mode makes it EASIER for griefers, because before you can fight back you have to slog through the menus to find pacifist mode and turn it off.
---
Kill them all...
---
You can already craft cores in the game lol
---
watoga and harpers
---
‚ÄòIntended‚Äô? Why do you think we‚Äôve got all those build items not to mention items in the Atom shop. 
---
I see people claiming to be victimized on a daily or near daily basis, and I just marvel at it. I've got over 200 hours in, I was legitimately griefed one time, 2 months ago. Guys destroyed my camp, that's it. I've been killed in PvP but also have killed people, I've never been followed around or anything like that. I wonder what makes some people such marks?
---
PS4, but i just shit my pants. I went to workshop and there was 52lvl with tse mg and other guy with 100+ that has probably sentinel/assasin. No more pvp. I need new pants. :D
---
&gt;Course, I'd have a way easier job of it if there were raider themed options for building...
---
This will 100% be DLC sometime this year 
---
PC
---
My own turret is attacking me even after several relogs. Don't know why.
---
I do not especially think they should be rechargable.  Doing that reduces the decisions players have to make for allocating space fpr critical supplies, which is a choice you should be making for a survival type game.  Not all energy sources are rechargable, or can only be recharged a finite number of time.  Infinite recharges on fusion cores with no risk of them burning out or exploding as part of the recharging process would be another step towards making an easy game a faceroll game.
---
Vending,  maybe,  but I haven't successfully run a shop,  you have me there.   I haven't found a way to get customers, so I just chase people down and throw stuff at them.  How many chems do you ruin through?   I have Pharma Farma and I've got so many Chems I'm giving them away.  Especially super stimpacks.
---
This game was "advertised" as a multiplayer survival game in the Fallout universe, which was made clear over and over again.  It's not a game where you can have a bathtub of laser pistols, which has been clear since the beta.  People here have whined about having to have mules loaded with a quadrillion pounds of wood scrap, which is insane, and against this game's intent.
---
At least you have an estimate of how much stash would make you happy, the majority of posts follow the "Fallout 4 let me have 35 thousand stimpacks, why is the stash not a trillion?"
---
The thing is, the game is perfectly playable by hundreds of thousands of players who have learned to love the stash.  I'll agree that vendors are a special case... But for the regular wastelander, they needed to live with less.  West Virginia isn't New Vegas or Boston.  It's got way more scrap and a ton of perks to let you find more of what you need.
---
With all of that said, if you have a good tutorial on how to run a shop without spending the whole session alone and bored to tears, let me know.  My original intent was to run a shop, but I can rarely get people to not teleport away when I approach, let alone get people to come shop.  I think the whole concept of a shop needs better tooling.
---
If they were gonna have repairs at all they should have made them all like PA: bigger cost but actually last a while instead of 2s.
---
The problem is also the stash limit. You cant go from having infinite storage to fucking 10 weapons and 3 armor sets.
---
I don't think you comprehend just how profitable the hate train really is for them.  People love hearing things that confirm their preexisting beliefs, rather than challenge them.
---
Seen people do this, very bothersome almost everyone accidentally shot something in the camp and became wanted
---
where do you find recipes?
---
I should've added /s lol 
---
Bloodied effect, Nerd Rage, All Melee Damage Cards, maybe a Bobblehead
---
Behold the Glass Cannon build. Do tremendous damage with Melee but have the durability of a paper boat. 
---
I tend to spend lots of time farming materials to make drugs, the recipes can be found in the medical wing inside the Enclave bunker.  Mix the green thumb perk to pick up double the flora and fauna then a fully ranked up super duper perk card and I'm drowning in drugs!  Also, with the green thumb perk I basically just sprint around in nuke zones grabbing up all the nuked flora  / other junk items as they weigh next to nothing and sell for a decent amount with the hard bargain perk card.  All nuked flora sells for 11 caps a piece, weighs almost nothing and its shelf life can be extended with the good with salt perk.  Also, I make sure to kill any super mutants I come across as they almost always have caps on them, not many but every little bit helps.  Especially when I found out that mutation recipes are for sale in the Enclave bunker for 19,600 caps... 
---
I got a good one, Kinda how gta5 is with the cars. When someone destroy your camp, they pay you damage assessment.
---
rofl
---
One of my chars base is a tent, a bed, stash and a cook fire, i then hide all the work benches in the woods.  So you walk up to a CAMP that is actually a camp.
---
Thanks, will check into it and report the findings 
---
I'm actually fine with them fixing it... there are potential real exploits you can do with it plus theres a bunch of weird wonkiness with the walkmeshes on the foundations anyway. Just wanted to play with it a little before it happened.
---
Could be a hidden chem addiction. I posted a similar issue where my all rise fell from 170 ish to 90. Addiction wasn't showing in pip boy. Popped an addictol and it sorted it
---
thanks :') 
---
Thanks, I'll check into it and report back the details 
---
Sequins
---
Sorry if I missed it, has something happened to pacafist mode? I turned it on after a griefer in PA started following me around while I was ~lvl 9 and have had no issues since. Does it not protect your CAMP? 
---
I have all apart from empath. It's pretty nice
---
Hmmm...exploding you say. That could be a thing like you run the risk of it exploding and damaging your stuff
---
I encountered several assaultron dominators. I hate these bitches with passion. If i wouldnt have had a handmade with freshly made 1000 rounds, i would have died many times. 
---
This bug has been there since Fallout 4, but muffled is listed as a limb mod in xEdit, but can actually only be applied to legs at a crafting bench. Arms with the muffled mod can drop in the world, but reports from Fallout 4 say they don't actually do anything.

---
Lol, well happy mistake but a mistake none the lessn
---
Agree. I have reactive plates and they are a disappointment. I'm thinking about swapping mine out for Core Assembly since I am always over weight and the AP regen will help.
---
i always thought the fusion core in the fusion generator was just a catalyst to get a larger reaction started, otherwise your set of power armor could power an entire settlement indefinitely.
---
Because you're actually a weapon doctor.
---
Ya, you can craft 100 charge cores at a Tinker Bench. Don't know how it unlocked, but you need all sorts of Fluxs to craft it.
---
Thanks for saving me the work :)
---
"What I‚Äôm trying to say is Bethesda stick with either single player or 2-4 coop games. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre ready yet for a massive world quite yet"
---
Its not we that are not ready. Its Bethesda. Otherwise I agree.
---
I heard if someone makes you Excavator armor and you get into it you discover the plans for it. Is that true and if it is that the same for others?
---
Interesting, will add the notes
---
I usually find 1 for every two fire watch bases in the bog I search
---
I am set up onto of a lake and so i have a decent amount of space for purifiers. I use the large ones ( not the industrial ones) as they are easier to place. Usually I go do one or two quests and come back. there is usually 2 or 3 purified waters in each purifier and I have 5  of them. There is a cap of three for the large and industrial and a cap of 2 for the small and medium ones.  What was your location for the industrial purifiers because someone may be stealing from your purifiers depending on the popularity of the location.
---
Jewlery?
---
Stuff was fancier back then
---
I'm doing this tonight.  All my useless cement laying around will finally be put to use. 
---
I wondered what was going on! I logged on last weekend for the first time in a while to get a good look at the TSE nerfs. My gatling went from mid 600s per shot to 190 but I felt like it was in a good place for PvE, had a good fight against some level 80 scorchbeasts. 
---
My TSE combat shotgun though went from around 900 to 260 damage per shot. That's still a lot of power and I can fire quickly but when I was shooting Whitespring ghouls, it seemed like zero damage was registering. So frustrating that they can't get this shit right this long after launch. 
---
The real reason there‚Äôs no tp in other fallouts....
---
The early responders wiped their asses with it first and depleted natural tp reserves lol 
---
You are trying to make it sound as though the way you play is the only "right" way and that any complainers are A. A minority, B. Playing it incorrectly, or C. Not even playing it. Dismissing other people's concerns out of hand doesn't help anyone unless you want Bethesda to cater just to you and those people who play just like you. That's not how open world RPGs work.
---
Bethesda has a history of making games that you can play in any number of ways and FO76 has stepped back from that and said "you must play it this way". Lots of people don't appreciate that. Others are tired of the bugs. Or the stealth nerfs. Or the ridiculous loot tables. Or the lack of endgame content. Or the lack of any new content. And the list of issues goes on. Every person who is frustrated with the above has a valid opinion, the same as you.
---
Just like when I suggest to people that don't like it that they should play something else and let go of their stress, I am telling you that if the game is fun for you, then keep at it and stop paying attention to the rants on reddit. Because your post isn't going to make someone lean back, slap their head, and say "oh shit, you're right. I never thought about that."
---
A couple spawn behind the lock 3 door at the Watoga transit hub. There is also a power armor and fusion generator there.
---
XD
---
I have a level 50 death claw gauntlet (extra claw mod) no legendary effects. I also have iron fist 3, twisted muscles, and talons. Without factoring in radicool or bloody mess or adrenaline. I am already doing 400 damage. With all of these factored in I do upwards of 700 damage a hit. If I had a bloodied death claw gauntlet I could do 1000+ damage.
---
I've had my camp completely destroyed three times. Vast majority of the people I meet in this game are great. But those griefers. 
---
I mean the perk system and getting rid of the weapon and armor condition. Also being able to rename weapons would be cool too. Did I get a messed up version of FO4 or something? Other people saw these things in that game right?
---
Those bots are so sneaky with their little poofy shooting sounds so you think they are not so much of a threat until you look at your healthbar and seeing it quickly deplete chunks at a time.  Very deceptive.  I hate them, but I would not want to see them changed.  Its almost like facing another player in terms of damage being done to you and I appreciate that as they one of the few enemies I actually worry about when I encounter them.
---
I think he forgot the "/s".
---
I wouldn't be surprised if people got banned over stupid shit like this though.
---
You can also make money by just walking around through the wasteland. Super mutants usually drop between 1-3 caps a piece, there are cap stashes that refill n obviously the vendors can sell 200 caps a day. I usually leave my compound in the savage divide walk past westek shoot muties until you reach harpers ferry. Clear all enemies from Harper Ferry n visit the vendor bot. 
---
Then I head south to Watoga make the two stop at Phoenix bot n the railroad station. I then head directly west towards the ash heap until I come to the raider railroad station at the southern end of the railroad. After that station which is a raider vendor bot I keep heading west until I reach Lewisburg railroad station which is responders vendor. From there head pretty much directly north n you‚Äôll be walking into whitesprings golf course. Stop in the mall at the resort or in you don‚Äôt want to go inside continue to follow the railroad n stop at the enclave bunker, then whitesprings rail station. That loop on foot will take from about 1-4 hours to complete. Try to use melee n have some weight reducing perks for aid n junk to acquire while roaming this will allow you to save money on ammo n more expensive materials to fix you weapons. 
---
Oh here come the downvoting cry babies
---
And the legendaries you get are not worth a dime. Not anymore. So even that has been removed so yeah. Nothing to do anymore. My tip: Uninstall the game. Wait 6 moths and try again. It will probably be free2play by then. 
---
Best spot, ant Tinkers bench, under explosive ammunition. ;)
---
I'll check the slot usage on the Underarmor, but the "bulkier" issue is legacy and from fallout 4.  
---
There is an option to prevent scaling, and sometimes disabling the Underarmor scaling results in clipping or odd appearances, will check into it however.
---
Since when is Beth a "he"? üòÇüòÇ
---
There's other power methods the windmill the 3 various sized generators and it's not like the camps fusion generator is realistic it doesn't cost any cores to run and just produces 100 energy.
---
They won't do this because it makes solo nuke launching risk free
---
!!! This is awesome!!
---
You should be able to make them at a Tinkers Workbench. I don't know if you need the plan for it. I don't think so.
---
its ok buddy
---
Yeah what this guy said. Spot on description my dude.
---
I've been playing on xbox since the first day of the "beta"  My schedule didn't really fit, and downloading enormous patches wasnt super fun so I think I only made it to like lvl 15 before the official release date.  I was put off by the rollout, and the hate so I set the game aside and focused on RDR2.  Fast forward to the end of Dec/Beginning of January I picked it up again, had some friends pick it up and have been playing it a good amount.  As an adult with an 8-5 job and two houses to look after I can really only squeeze in a couple of hours  during the week and bit more than that on weekends.  I have about 120 hours in on a lvl 62.  I don't main pvp but I don't really shy away from it either.  All that said, I've been legitimately greifed once and was not killed, because of the slap damage mechanic.  Had my camp wrecked once.   And my camp is in a pretty high density area.  
---
Reading on this sub, I expected it to be nothing but a wasteland of lvl 200+ dupers with every mutation, stacked bobbleheads, and tse weapons raining armageddon in every direction.  
---
It's not even remotely close to true.  Greifers are a small minority, and in my personal experience a shrinking one at that.  
---
tl;dr  It's really not that bad out there.  
---
Grognaks only shows up at less than 100% condition. Same with Meteoritic Sword. 
---
Habit I'm trying to break.
---
Had a friend in the same boat so we looked into it... :( 
---
I have nothing to add to this but i completely agree i was set up for tse for months but oh well time for a new build game is still alot of fun and im glad i bought it 
---
Not everyone uses an OP shotgun which does extra unlisted damage.
---
Do you get "stuck" walking inside between those two foundations?
---
No problem, hope this gets fixed! 
---
Pacifist only protects others FROM you.
---
Thank you coming forward and admitting the nerf was deserved and perhaps is incomplete.
---
New Vegas I balanced a bit differently, don't really remember how but it wasn't as simple as upping everyone's damage output. Some combination of mods and fiddling with them just made everyone's health values comfortable, that and honestly NV had better base game balance than 4.
---
You're still missing the point. This is amazing. The point was never to make a factual statement  but to make an exaggerated statement about the poor state of Bethesdas writing and presentation.
---
Think about it this way. If you order a burger with fries from a restaurant and you receive your burger with maybe 3-5 fries. It wouldn't be unacceptable for you to say "There aren't even any fries".
---
Ofcourse you actually did receive some fries, but it was drastically lower than the expectation you had based on advertising, previous experiences, etc etc. 
---
The Brotherhood of Steel locations often have one or two - the camp that you turn in the technical data, Fort Defiance, etc. You can also craft them somewhat "easily," although it requires around 10 screws and nuclear material. 
---
Nerd rage perk , radicool perk, adrenal reaction mutation, twisted muscles mutation.
---
Get to low HP by filling your HP bar with reds, destroy everything in your path.
---
Around Watoga. Note: These spawn locations share a pool with Brotherhood Under Armors as well.
---
_West_: 
---
There are 3 box cars. Inside on top of the wooden crates there is a chance for Marine pieces. Note: that the plans clip through the box so you can only barely see them. 
---
Even further West is the NAR Train Repair yard. Inside the Round hangar building there are plans on the table next to a screwdriver. 
---
_East_: The Flooded train yard. There are a set of plans in one of the box cars. THat's about as specific as I can be... there are a lot of train cars there. Good luck.
---
_Southeast_: 
---
Forward Station Delta (I think), near Fissure site prime. Walk up the stairs to the top of the barrier. There is a table with binoculars. Plans are normally on there.
---
_Northeast_:
---
Drop site C2 ( I think) There are plans inside on a set of shelves to the left. The place is flooded with toxic water and a Scorchbeast tends to spawn around the area.
---
So far those are the only places I've consistently found them.
---
My minigun says otherwise.
---
I have seen it happen
---
What's the prefix on that Grognak's tho?
---
First spot off the top of my head? I was picking them up pretty consistently in the back room at Venture, or whatever the fort is where you drop off the technical data.
---
Ugh... Never noticed that but makes sense, I'll look into the usage and report it.
---
I was so hoping supermutants in nuke zones would mutate into behemoths.  Very disappointed that does not seem to happen.  Would like to see some scorched behemoths at in game for sure.
---
Yeah i alrdy repaired the axe when she was at like 50% Makeshift Warrior 5 and Weapon Artisan 3 were equipped while repairing, but it didn‚Äòt repair to 200% 
---
And now they are producing the canvas bag and having to send it to everyone who submitted a request and that is a very expensive lesson. 
---
yeah the loot grind in this game needs to be looked at. But I think everyone is looking for the same thing. A reason to grind, the grind to be fun and not tedious, and a reasonable drop rate (and a proportional one at that)
---
&gt; The Nerf is unwarranted and unnecessary. 
---
OK what? when did heavy get a nerf?  It has always been kinda shitty.
---
Sentry bots 
---
Were you not the one defending the TSE nerf you are now complaining about?
---
Just curious.
---
For me he shares with Watoga....

you should broaden your criteria for "decent value." while guns might net you more caps per item, i think caps per lb is a more important metric. the most valuable items are those that weigh less than 1 lb and sell for 2+caps, and there are a ton of things that fall into that category. find out what scrap vedors accept instead of wasting plastic bulking other items. there is plenty of common scrap that is accepted as is. chems are also a great source of caps for their weight. never throw chems away, always sell. once you start doing nuke zones, pick up all the radioactive aid items - glowing blood, high radiation fluids, glowing mass etc.  these items weigh less than a lb, and sell for 7-15 caps a piece (hard bargain 3). clothes are also extremely lucrative for their weight. at .1 lbs, all outfits are at minimum worth 10 caps/lb.

I have 2 pieces that reduce 20 % weapon weight so I‚Äôm currently carrying all my weapons with me and still have an extra 100 lbs to go

Craft them. Super easy to craft. Tinker table/ ammo

Wah wah wah üë∂ nerf monster daddy bethesda. I'm no good at your game so pwease make enemies die when my carwachter looks at a enemy. Thank you daddy bethhesda. I'm sorry I'm a millennial piece of shit and want everything now.

"We forwarded this feedback on to the developers." 
---
I've started leaving loot in the blue suitcase at Charleston station on PS4
---
I would agree with this. I‚Äôm primarily a rifleman and switch to my Gatling gun for SBQ, Mirelurks queens, or when I‚Äôm just in the mood. Because of its slower rate of fire and that I take care of the adds with my handmade, Ive never needed to reload the Gatling because I whip it out when she hovers or lands.  I haven‚Äôt gotten martial artist 3 yet, so that might change. Fortunately, 5mm is cheap to craft.  If you‚Äôre not tied to your 50 cal, you may want to consolidate calibers and stick with a backup Gatling if you are worried that your primary will break. 
---
I would suggest scaling back on the heavy gunner points and picking up martial artist 3 and bloody mess 3.  That‚Äôll increase your ROF/DPS with the Gatling and increase damage across the board (as mentioned by someone else). If you‚Äôre not running an energy weapon, consider replacing Batteries included, unless you hoard cores and 2mm.  
---
No bobbleheads, chems, or food and I'm at 1450+. Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction, all melee cards, Twisted Muscles, all unyielding armor and probably a couple of things I'm missing offhand. I MEAN I'M A PAPER BAG BUT YOU'RE DEAD IF I HIT YOU
---
Totally agree. I'm really hoping for that to change in the second one. Fingers crossed are
---
No idea why this isn't the case. 
---
Haha
---
Yes, if you allow recharging them add a risk of them overcharging and exploding doing some sort of damage to anyone nearby and whatever equipment is used to recharge them. And make the equipment require some kind of flux(es)  as 'fuel'.  That might work.  Science perk might reduce the chances of failure.  Its a thought.
---
Yeah, I hear you. Even with a 200% repaired TSE Gatling Gun, and Luck of the Draw equipped, sometimes it'll still break during a particularly long SBQ battle (which happens more frequently since the TSE nerf).
---
Had a new issue yesterday as well. I was in a Nuke zone gathering materials for flux. My health suddenly began to drain. No enemies. I was in a storage room in whitesprings. Panicked and went thru a couple stimpaks. But it drained faster than I could heal. Die. Respawn at the train station. Run back and gather my dropped loot. As soon as I picked up the hardened mass it happened again. Die. Respawn. Run back with just my hazmat suit. Pick up loot again no issues. XB1
---
even if that is true which I seriously doubt since it took me like 6-7 Shots with a gauss before the TSE nerf having like 1500 dmg, it is still too much hassle for the drop it gets you.

Wooshing makes you a douche. Don't be a douche.

Which apology letter, the one talking about the hot fix? Just making sure I didn't miss something 
---
Only thing that bothers me is that base at w,s and tbh it always ends up a fun pvp fight so i kinda like it to i guess lol 
---
I feel like the grafton monster just eats ammo.
---
Well if you can charge them you only need to carry 2. Saves effort in picking them up and carry weight.
---
West-Tek research lab
---
Give up an uninstall! I did and it was a great choice. 
---
Sorry, forgot to reply yesterday. For one, the loot tables for the game are bonkers. To start with, Scorchbeasts aren't worth the ammo you use on them. Drills can drop in place of legendary items? Scorched that use shotguns don't always drop shotguns?
---
Never mind the fact that the entire endgame is "grind for legendary gear" and there's no way to balance out time invested against any possible reward. Maybe you kill a dozen legendaries at Whitespring, but there's no reason to assume you'll get anything other than a furious rolling pin or nocturnal wood armor. Hell, I've killed the SBQ a few dozen times, but the odds of getting a serum recipe are about "1 in never" and the odds of getting an Ultracite Explosive Vent are about 1 in 1.
---
Maybe I didn't use the correct term for "looting mechanism", because there are things that work right - monsters decay to bloody messes or whatever, you can loot anyone you damage, etc. But the loot system as a whole needs a ton of work.
---
If only they'd had four years to fix that
---
Ugh...  
---
I've had that Happen to me twice, no disease or other warning, but it didn't clear until I Went to the main menu.  
---
Did you report it as a bug?
---
This is why no one goes after them unless they want to pvp.
---
I knew I was missing one or two things.
---
You know, people say Melee is OP, but considering how much you need to invest in order to one-shot most things, I'd say the build is pretty balanced 
---
No, Grognak's Axe is just weird.  They don't allow it to be repaired to 200%.
---
You can do it on a Bowie Knife, because mine is certainly above 100%.
---
I don't have that equipped, but I killed my first Legendary+++ and the body immediately disappeared.
---
I raged and then logged out and *did laundry*.  That's how pissed I was.
---
I had this problem last night.  I ended up restarting my whole PC.  I could go in and out of map mode, but couldn't move and couldn't make my pip boy display go away.  When I quit back to the main menu, the screen area where the pip boy displayed wouldn't show the splash screen art, but it played normally on the rest of the screen.  Weird.
---
A. Drink the flux. It's a good hydration source.  
---
B. DROP IT. It's not like you can't get another few hundred if someone drops a nuke anywhere.
---
Use it as water.
---
Really good one :O I love it.
---
I‚Äôm skeptical of people claiming they got killed in unsolicited pvp 6 times in a day.  On PS4 it‚Äôs happened to me less than 10 times since launch. Am I just lucky?
---
Also, if you claim a workshop and get attacked that‚Äôs not unsolicited. Workshops are specifically designed to encourage pvp.
---
Unless you hit the Serendipity bug. Won a PvP fight the other day in power armor and had the animation trigger like 7 times. Of course I don‚Äôt run with that perk. 
---
Ive been saying this for years about shooters. It's the #1 reason I drop this shit quick. My first time watching a SQ fight and seeing rockets / tons of ammo fly off I was like... this is dumb... this is all kinds of dumb. The first games that awoke me to this hate was The Division and Borderlands. You're telling me that my .50 Cal bullets only do slightly more damage than a .22? Ok game devs... Ok. This shit seriously bothers me! Thank you for raising the flag OP.
---
Sell it to vendors 
---
I think it‚Äôs a fundamental gameplay issue.  If players want to collect and hold things, the game shouldn‚Äôt punish you for that.  If they don‚Äôt want us to collect things, even though the gameplay reenforces that, they shouldn‚Äôt add punishing systems to prevent us from doing that, it creates a negative experience for the player.  
---
If the developers don‚Äôt want us to have large inventories filled with items we‚Äôve collected, they should design the system so that players don‚Äôt want to horde items.  The best solution to a problem is one that rewards the player.
---
This whole damn sub is full of massively upvoted and viewed posts that end up being complete and utter bullshit.  So to back up a claim that xbox LFG is brimming with all these offers of dupe services, a dated pic should be something that you would have in the original message if you wanted to be taken seriously.
---
Sure there are likely a few tardfish posting dupe services, and are likely trolling to steal peoples shit.  You didn't say you found a couple of entries, you claimed it was full of them.  So you either are full of shit, your somehow seeing entries the rest of us do not, or you grossly exaggerated just how many there were.
---
with how much junk we hoard just to be able repair shit? no, we need like, 1000-1500 limit

In b4: **"Fixed an issue allowing players to build cool C.A.M.P.s".**
---
Why is building worse than Fallout 4? They took all the feedback from 4 and did exactly the opposite. üò¢
---
march 
---
now you have to try the survival pvp mode that nobody asked 
---
everything is easy af with a melee build 
---
Difficulty is not the same as tedium. No Fallout game has as much a tilt into the Survival aspect as FO76 does. By far. 
---
One of the reasons it flopped so badly.
---
Is there a stealth Galaxy Quest reference in there? :)
---
They need to Nerf melee.
---
I said Fallout *before* 4.
---
All the features you mentioned were things before. SPECIAL stats used to affect other weapon damages, Strength has always affected both melee and carry weight. That's why I'm saying that these aren't new things. You should play the older Fallouts and see what I mean, it's a disservice not to.
---
Had to sell so many legendaries because of this. As a casual player, I would like to explore and build new things, and collect unique items. Now I am at a point where my stash is full, my inventory is full, my CAMP budget maxed out. I am not even level 45 yet, and the game is giving me big "FU, you cannot play anymore".
---
I have been debating this as well.  Fallout 4 looked so much better, ran smoother and i play alone most of the time anyways.  These companies need to stop doing the MMO thing and realize that we want CO-OP not MMO.  If this was a CO-OP Fallout 4 it would have done massively better.  IMO.  Cheers!
---
Cores are too common, and Power Armor too prevalent, as it is.
---
Using PA should be a strategic or tactical choice reserved for emergencies or dangerous areas. Otherwise it skews game balance toward making it a requirement. 
---
Ah, damn, duh.
---
Hm. I did not realise they took that drop away. Did they provide a reason? I'm on XB1 and considering 
---
When you realize they nerfed TSE only because they let the Dupe bug exist so long that TSE weapons proliferated the game in orders of magnitude greater number than intended, you start to get a little twitch in one eye.
---
Because apparently trying to craft when being backstabbed twenty two times is a fine wasteland survival tactic. I hope that survival mode will ease this tension and players who want to play a game where every moment is tense will cease harming the experience those who just wish to chill out. There's nothing wrong with expecting that from a game.
---
But this one thing I just cannot understand. As a player who finds it most fun to defend the wasteland from raiders, I am grateful for every raider I meet. I see no point in complaining about the existence of bloody psychos in a Fallout game, lack of such would be what would trouble me. Its not like you can't block them so they don't  see you on map and you are free to roam the part of wasteland they do not occupy. Same with workshops and bases being raided, well, its wasteland, I'd be surprised not to see it happening.
---
I don't think anyone stole from them because I was there the whole time.  I think there is something to be said about having to leave and come back, but for 60/hr, you'd think you'd be able to loot them constantly.  Some posts have noted that it seemed like the result was being distributed between purifiers.  I activated them around the same time and some never produced water while others had 2.
---
This was near the Monorail Elevator.
---
I have an instigating Grog axe with +40% power swing which is still not hitting 1K damage just shows I need to rework my perks
---
Read it again. 
---
Can confirm, I do well over 1k but died 8 times yesterday. 
---
I had a 6 hour session yesterday and i just finished a two hour session. Didn't disconnect a single time.
---
Possibly the wireless card installed in my rig is in the area, but the antenna x3 are at the back from the pci-e card and the mouse dongle is plugged into a USB hub on the monitor.
---
I'm going to remove the Wi-Fi card as I'm using an Ethernet cable at the moment. Thanks for the suggestion, worth a try ;)
---
i think Tuesday has been patch day for the most part, and we usually get some kind of heads up. since we haven't, i don't see it happening. we likely wont hear anything until they do another "inside the vault," likely Thursday.
---
LOL :)
---
Happened to me 2 nights ago near the white springs train station. I thought it might have been a chameleon player shooting at me but it was making me laugh because I was just standing there on the road and they were not hitting me. Whatever it was, was a terrible shot! Eventually it stopped but it was very strange...
---
I do the same thing until I'm out of stash but since the patch it's been harder to find them. 
---
Looks great,
---
I'm looking into this to see if we're planning on addressing it. If it's not currently on the list I'm going to bring this up to the Dev's!
---
I will today. I got too busy with easy dailys to bulk up my stims 
---
Very nice. Personally always like this one as well:
---
https://youtu.be/9vST6hVRj2A
---
Love the way he sing it.
---
Very true it does come and go, sometimes it is taking more than 6 left mouse clicks before it works while keyboard is fine? Makes fighting... interesting.
---
We're noticing that it seems to happen with two of the same weapons with different mods on the wheel. Are those the weapons you see unequipping off that?
---
Are you saying that prewar military and government personnel went around irradiated blackberries to build random shit?
---
The grim reality is that the game is so unfriendly to anyone who tries to PvP, that there are no griefers or PvP players in this game. Im lvl 115 and was only visited by one griefer so far. My camp is in Flatwoods, so its not hidden or anything. Another guy once killed me for taking to long at a vendor. Thats two PvP experiences in I dont know how many hours. 
---
Really looking forward to PvP servers. Those will be fun!
---
It's because of certain playstyles. About 50% of the people on the game go melee.
---
Sounds like viable endgame content.
---
Happened to me once so far on XB, lvl 181 with a power fist kept trying to start pvp in the frickin' woods of all places. I started spamming the thumbs down, as he couldn't kill me, but anyone who says slap damage is negligible, doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
As I walked out of the woods, there was a lvl 40 guy's base, and the griefer continued to demolish it repeatedly.
---
I spent 30 minutes following them, standing in from of their explosive shots, and spamming thumbs down.
---
Maybe you should read it again..?
---
It was a joke..
---
"..he is ruining the game.."
---
"..Beth is ruining the game.."
---
Something something, cash grabbing pyramid scheme..
---
Had one SBQ fight where a guy built a massive platform like three or four stories tall with ladders that go into the sky. You were able to walk up the ladders and practically melee her in the air. Was legit.
---
Most definitely. I fought my first for a while last night and it took like 10 of us, and from the animations of the bullets hitting them a fair few.of us were using two shot explosive rounds. It was nuts really. Because the fight wasn't difficult, it just took forever ya know?
---
Are you on Xbox, I need ammo if you want to give it away to someone who lost everything due to a Bethesda bug during a nuke launch
---
New weapons, characters, and loot? Well for a BR game I guess that‚Äôs totally fine.
---
You‚Äôre allowed to like things that you think sound cool. Even when other people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cool.
---
I wonder if it's related to region or platform.
---
I've been playing daily since the beta and only had one person mess with me. They crouched and scurried over to my base with a mole miner gauntlet, hit me once, so I ran away from my base figuring they were RPing a raider and just wanted to loot my resources, then they followed me so I just fast traveled to the vault.
---
Otherwise the "worst" experience I've had is just people ignoring each other.  Most people will give an emote, or watch what I'm doing, or fight alongside me.
---
On PC, in North Central US. 
---
Since last Tuesday's patch, the few times I have logged on has been nearly nothing but griefers..   
---
I have a shameful number of hours into '76, and I've meet more griefers since Tuesday then in the entire rest of my time in world
---
I agree with you, survival mechanisms always were, to me, a repetitive boring thing that brings nothing to the game. Everyone can 'survive', it's not difficult, the repetitiveness of having to survive is a chore, though. That's why I never played survival in FO4, and that's an aspect of FO76 I clearly dislike too.
---
I‚Äôd settle for putting some cracked or partially broken glass in the sight.
---
what plans do you have ? How much
---
Collecting plans to display them is kinda pointless. Theres a vendor that sells the most fancy plans for ~1k each in whitesprings resort hallway, all the items I have found in the wild after 200 levels were less fancy than those I bought there
---
I know why should I be punished for it?
---
For those left wondering

Just tested, Can confirm both legs combined add 100 to your carry weight. Obviously only whilst in your power armor.
---
Sadly, I'm on PC. Maybe you can find another generous soul to make a deal with you.
---
I farmed up 60+ tick blood and none of them gave me any extra. I have maxed out my butchers bounty
---
Maybe if reddit didn't destroy the game than this wouldn't be happening :P posts like this is why it's in such a terrible state
---
Or maybe if Bethesda just completely ignored reddit then it would be a different game than trying to give  this cesspool of reddit what it wants
---
Literally less than 10% of posts on reddit about this game aren't cancer

**RE: Issue: Unable to craft the "Lighter" Torso Option** 
---
I have unlocked Lighter Metal Torso mod from scrapping sometime ago (listed as a very low chance of learning from scrapping) and can craft the Lighter Build option. I just verified now by crafting a level 10 light metal chest and under the mod slot I see and applied the "Lighter Build" mod. The result was a *Lightweight Metal Chest Piece*.
---
They said in a reddit comment there was more pve content yet to be revealed in March. Personally I don't think they should tease it since the community is already disgruntled. People imagine things, if it doesn't live up to their pipe dreams they'll be even more upset. Should have went ahead and told us

Inert flux is flux that has "gone bad", it's not used for anything. 
---
You need to take your flux home when it is still raw, (i.e. Raw Cobalt Flux) and convert it into stable flux. 
---
Saving inert flux is like saving spoiled meat.. dont.

Chem bench. You can craft Fusion Cores at a Chem Bench. Not Tinkers Bench afaik.

Thanks for all the feedback on this guys, I appreciate it and of course as always passing along to the team.

No other FO game had nearly these condition damage rates

There's also a deposit just north of Flatwoods if you want your camp to double as a newbie help point. 
---
Whitespring's Bunker always have Plasma guns for sale.
---
Wow! Some lv 230 jerk demolished my sad little lv 20 shack last night. I have new base building aspirations now!
---
Bathesda isn't as interested in fixing bugs as they are artificially inflating play time.
---
Hey, what platform you on? I'm on PS4 I'll buy the inert flux from you.
---
Use it all the time.
---
Yes look at the glasses caverns that's litterally the entire lore therr
---
Data mining says,

Weapon Mods random drops (Savage Divide, The Mire, Ash Heap, Cranberry Bog), Random Quest Reward (Ash Heap)
---
Most of what I've seen is bored shit head kids that duped the whole damn game and are pissy and taking it out on the player base now that they had to toss their 3 million pounds of duped TSE blah's and another million pounds of materials.  
---
I was really hoping they would just get bored and go back to fortnight but it is taking longer than I would like.
---
I hate the mire in the daylight! At night I jump to a roof and wait it out. Yes I know I'm lvl 76...
---
Did you try and complete it anyway? I've never had that. It's possible that for some reason the event quest went off your active log but was still active. Just guessing.
---
Also did you by chance get a completion message with rewards? If you did that means someone completed it (and possibly had you ignored), that's just a thought but I'm betting that's not the case.
---
Then it's a post launch issue introduced in a later patch.  
---
If you look at the COBJ in XEdit now, you'll see it's missing the ability to learn it via scrapping.
---
thx for for telling me! Alrdy thought i would do something wrong!
---
Any time there is a nuke dropped it's laggy.

I've found a plan or two for Gamma Gun mods but never actual guns.
---
Hi, your information was very helpful.  I now have my T51b full set!!   Thank you!
---
Not really, the trade off puts your hp so low it isn't worth the damage bonus imo.
---
Is it the damage reduction that's underwhelming or that it doesn't work all the time?
---
You‚Äôre the one calling people names and whining like a child.
---
Good luck with your life,
---
Shotguns do extra explosive damage per pellet. A gun like tse minigun does very low DPS now.
---
I knew before I clicked this thread you were going to say shotgun.
---
I've seen a few posts saying that camps on or near Whitesprings will be destroyed but that was after I had a camp up on the rocky area overseeing the golf course 2 months ago and it was totally obliterated. I don't know if it was a scorchbeast or a player. It wasn't in the nuke zone. Now I usually try to find a secluded spot that isn't in range of a fissure. It would be cool if they had pre-made underground bunkers like the player housing in Star Wars Galaxies. 
---
Thanks!!
---
This just recently started for me. It wasn't an issue a few weeks back.
---
Make their camp wanted; highlight for the server to locate, first to destroy the offender‚Äôs camp splits bounty with the victim. Bounty should be commensurate with repair costs and enough to make it worth the bounty hunter‚Äôs troubles. If aforementioned victim collects bounty receives double bounty.
---
They are dizzy dead?
---
Just joking.
---
Not sure, but I encounter the exact same thing (sometimes) on water purifiers, lootable containers like suitcases, etc. Might be server lag possibly.
---
Not a happy mistake if you are searching vendors for months looking for the Deep Pocketed Plan, and skip over this plan because you already learned it from scrapping (at least until patch 5 when it strangely shows up as an plan not known). That's what happened to me anyway, but I found and read the Pocketed plan in the wild and posted about it earlier on Reddit.
---
I had done a few runs a while back on a previous char and it wasn't an issue. I wonder if this is a patch-related issue.
---
It has been just a couple of months. Impatient much?
---
Melee4uraz
---
I've seen it elsewhere too, but not as frequently or as persistently as in WS during a nuke zone. Craziness.

I name all my characters ridiculous things for laughs. I usually base names off what the Mr. Handy's will call me by in game- my last two Fallout 4 characters were Toast Titties (HILARIOUS and *so* inappropriate when codsworth and other Handy's go "Why hello there Miss Titties!") and Captain Nipples (A wonderful Strength/Luck build wearing a chef hat and rocking a Power Fist). My two current characters are Gary 666 and Luke Thighwalker. 
---
ON THAT NOTE, we've shared this player want with Dev's in the past but I'll bring it back up again. :)
---
We are talking about **fusion** cores, right? These aren't batteries that can be recharged by reversing the chemical reaction. It is a nuclear reaction that produces useable energy to power our equipment. The only way to recharge them once the nuclear fuel is spent is to replace the fuel with new nuclear material, essentially building a whole new core. 
---
max out all 3 rifleman perks, use armor piercing mags, sneak is a good idea, you‚Äôll be one or two-shotting lvl 68 super mutants in no time
---
I enjoy it for what it is, I have always enjoy the world of fallout and exploring and crafting and looting no npcs were never a deal breaker for me and this honestly has the most varied fallout world ever from the swamps to the ash lands to the dense forest it‚Äôs all very well done imo I didn‚Äôt play the game to rush to the end nor do I think that is the sole purpose of fallout 76 this is defiantly one of those it‚Äôs about the journey type of games 
---
iv had and continue to have great encounters and experiences in fallout 76 no I‚Äôm not 100+ levels no I haven‚Äôt spent over 100 hours in game but I‚Äôm getting there and enjoying every min 
---
I googled it, you‚Äôre right. I guess it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve held a gun 
---
Hide some just inside doors, with trip wires or pressure plates, and dump rads on uninvited guests. Make a mutation farm, with side by side contamination and decontamination arches. Pop a decontamination arches down as a public service next to Whitesprings, and when someone calls up, overburdened and 10 rads from dead, switch it right before they run through, and collect their junk. So many possibilities.
---
Given the state of launch, not really.
---
Be a nice add on for Camps. Solar Powered Recharge station. Place 5 fusion cores inside and it will charge them all at the same time to 110%. Maybe at a rate of 1% per minute.
---
It would need to be lockable or people would steal you cores.
---
It really depends on your build. You can wear Raider power armor as early as level 15 I think. Then you can get Excavator Armor at Level 25. Power armor does not have to be a necessity. There are perks that will give you good defense based on your play style. 
---
doesn‚Äôt it share inventory with one of the factions?
---
Kinda, yes. It keeps wanting to sort of push you up if you get too close to the walls. But if you walk right in the middle you're ok. 
---
This is exactly why i rarely try to fight Scorchbeasts or even take part in the event to kill the Queen. Takes me AGES to amass the absurd amount of ammo I‚Äôll need to take them down, and in the Queen‚Äôs case she almost always drains me of like all my ammo.
---
Yep happens often on XB1 have to relaunch the game to fix.
---
What the You Tubes have shown me this is true. In a perfect world you could pull a One Punch Man on all things with a 3K hit total. 
---
TL;DR 
---
Also on a side note, if anyone wants to know what names the Mr. Handy's will call you by [here is a list](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Codsworth/recognized_names). I want to say the Handy's in the Vault will say your name? I can't remember for sure- it's been a couple months since I started a new character up. But I think I remember hearing one at least say Gary.
---
Happened to once aswell. Stored a shitload of weapons, armors, ammo, junk and medics in a container at watoga station (metalbox in a train) - wrote down a couple of name just in case some1 is leaving the server. Logged out, changed character and tried to join the server - world not found - i tried all the names i wrote down but got the same message all the time. Man i was pissed. 
---
&gt; You are trying to make it sound as though the way you play is the only "right" way and that any complainers are A. A minority, B. Playing it incorrectly, or C. Not even playing it.

To me it sounds like your seeing yourself in the type of player I'm describing. And so you feel attacked. That's a you thing. I can't help you there. 
---
&gt; Bethesda has a history of making games that you can play in any number of ways and FO76 has stepped back from that and said "you must play it this way". Lots of people don't appreciate that. 
---
See, again, it's a case of perception. You seem to think that Bethesda should only make games one way. Why should they? They were so clear about this version of Fallout way before it was launched. They were going to do something new, it was part experiment. It wasn't going to be like past Fallout games. 
---
All games are limited in how you can play them, because you can only do the options they offer in this game. This isn't any different. The thing is, they decided to try something new and different. And that's good. 
---
And you just made my case. Players are used to playing just one way. And they don't want to change that. Why? Because it means they don't have to think. That's why you see so many posts about "Past fallouts didn't have this or that!" 
---
The simple fact is this. Games have to change and grow, or the industry becomes stagnant. Especially for the big companies. It's dangerous to just keep putting out the exact same game. Game play has to evolve. That's literally what they are trying to do with Fallout 76. 
---
&gt; Because your post isn't going to make someone lean back, slap their head, and say "oh shit, you're right. I never thought about that." 
---
And yet, you made a reply trying to do just that. So why did you post? Oh, because you had something you wanted to say. Just like me. What an ego to think you just delivered me some wisdom I was missing, while at the same time telling me to shut up.
---
Survival... which now means having an alt acct or friend hold your caps while you drop some douche on rando's with a zero loss pvp grief method that BGS seems in no hurry whatsoever to correct.  Apparently they believe that their pvp game mode is actually going to resolve something lol...
---
Never defended the nerf.
---
In my opinion the problem was never the TSE weapons, it's that they are even needed.
---
Still, TSE weapons were also intended to be rare.  Duping hurt the game bad, and put a ton of cheap TSE weapons on the market.
---
there‚Äôs a power armor set in the warehouse by mama dolces food processing plant for starters. power armor comes on a frame which holds the power armor parts, these parts will be a certain level, you can‚Äôt use them unless you‚Äôre that certain level or higher. the frame itself doesn‚Äôt have a level, you can use it whenever but to get in it, you need to take off the parts that are beyond your level. the frames aren‚Äôt the best defense wise but they give you a buff to strength. they run on fusion cores, which you can find in fusion generators or on the power armor frames themselves. 
---
So you wouldn't feel that NEEDS to save everyone.  
---
So lemme get this straight 
---
You believe Bethesda and zenimax management come and read reddit, and when they see critical posts, it forces them to release buggy code with minimal testing.
---
You need help. 
---
The queen is awful for it she turned into a meat pile before I could see what she had.
---
Lots of great feedback in this thread, thank you all! We mentioned in last week's Inside the Vault that we'll be taking a pass on energy and heavy weapon durability, ammo weights, and repair costs to help them feel more viable. In terms of enemies and enemy health, there are lots of great thoughts in here that we will discuss as well.
---
I was expecting power armor with like a Deathclaw skull helmet and dual deathclaw gauntlets. This is VASTLY more terrifying.
---
(Also awesome work, it looks really good!)
---
I would be frustrated with that. Ragey, even.
---
Sure if they actually pvp... most just dump their caps on alts or friends and then they lose nothing while they get their jollies.  This is the real reason wanted levels should be static, cap at level 50, and take your caps into the negative if you can't pay.
---
Maybe add a 4th perk that auto hacks or picks if you have all 4. I hate hacking because it doesnt pauses anything like in previous titles so if I'm hacking and get jumped by an assaltron I have to back out and that isn't fast enough sometimes lol
---
To be fair, I could have been way more tactful.
---
I'm just annoyed at the hourly "Does anyone agree with the prevailing opinion?" Posts.  That's SOP for Reddit, I guess.
---
Next time, lock your doors and don't let random wasteland strangers into your home. This is on you
---
Might have to trade my own soul
---
I'm not sure if you are trolling us or you really  are this pathetic.  I'm going to guess the latter.  
---
You should adapt your behavior instead of insisting games adapt to you.
---
Honestly I find the atom store really non offensive. Im only a month into the game, but everything is cosmetic and ive managed to keep a steady flow of atoms without even realising so i dont feel pressured to buy shit to keep things interesting (looking at you GR Wildlands). Whats the hate for?
---
Yeah downloading as we speak.  Heard some good reviews so far.  Games this last year have been pretty disappointing. 
---
It doesn't force them
---
But they do read reddit and makes changes depending on it. That's why two shot and explosive got nerfed. Because people were complaining for like 2 months. And Bethesda has been making changes depending on what the community wants
---
Also ZeniMax has nothing to do with fallout 76 lol so shows what you know
---
(ZeniMax does elder scrolls online while Bethesda ALONE is doing 76. No support from anyone but this toxic community) 
---
Yeah I was, I mean I understand the servers have to deal with a lot more during the scorched earth but there was about 6 of us just stood there waiting.
---
Thanks I‚Äôm gunna need it lol
---
Hey how did you get the pylon and keypad combo to work? 
---
This sounds fun. I loved using plasma rifles back in NV. I may have to give this build a shot. 
---
You realize that this is just a gimmick, right? All this stuff is planned out before launch, and then just not included? It's all ready to go. They are just playing on that they know there's a group of players who eat through content as quick as they can. So to avoid having those people posting complaints about having done everything in the game?
---
It's such an obvious ploy. 
---
If you enter watoga from the west and climb on top of the buildings to your left there should be a vertibird that usually spawns PA and a mini nuke in front of it.  
---
I'm on xbox and have a boat load I'll sell what platform are you on
---
I see what you  mean, but I meant that a low level character can shred a higher level character with enough turrets.
---
Did you learn any of them 
---
I'm sure being insulting will light a fire under their asses. Good job. 
---
But you knew all of these since beta for example, why even buy the game of you hate it? Cause perks are mostly the same, differences are you have to actually build a character instead of maxing it all.
---
Story is here, FO4 npcs were boring aside your companions.
---
And gameplay is the same, assets are the same, only thing is that they brought durability back, but fo4 is an outlier here. 
---
I just found the gamma gun plans. Rng only now, as I haven't seen any vendors carrying them post patch.
---
Full unyielding armor, bloodied weapon. + mutation 
---
= extremly low health. those guys will die anytime there are more than two mobs with guns shoot at them. i.e. gutsys will eat them for breakfast. 
---
I want to say... I think about 3/4 of the budget? no turrets though. 
---
I give away serums from time to time...but, I'm on Xbox. If you are let me know. 
---
Exactly they are backtracking trying to bug fix things that shouldn't have made it in on launch.  Any new content is on the back burner now.
---
They even said a simple qol fix like renaming power armor chassis won't be coming until later this year.  
---
This is, unfortunately, the correct answer.  
---
Unyielding +1 strength armor gives you +20 strength at low health, with +5% melee damage per point of strength that's 100% more damage just from armor alone. (175% if you count the base 15 strength you should have already)
---
Radicool gives you another +5 S, so 25% damage, eat a deathclaw steak and get +2 S for another 10%.
---
I think you can see how this gets ridiculous fast, and this is Just the strength bonuses. There's also the +10% melee damage foods, bloodied, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, etc. 
---
Toast titties
---
Captain nipples
---
There‚Äôs a trend here 
---
Yeah. Instead of one shotting everything you have to actually play the game and shoot them 2 or 3 times. The game is just broken and I am immediately going to uninstall it
---
Quit and go play something else problem solved personally I enjoy the game for what it is That‚Äôs it but if the game is Causeing you so much pain and frustration just quit 
---
The formula for armor penetration is stupid. It's heavily weighted in favor of weapons that do the highest damage.
---
Bethesda needs to add armor degradation into the formula to benefit high rate of fire weapons that do less damage per shot.
---
Paying for extra HP is playing for extra HP. The total cost of it doesn't matter. That little boost could be the difference between winning or losing in PvP.
---
yes but it is "multiplicative"   
---
found this elsewhere but it explains well:
---
I think it's like this:
---
Anti armor is 100%-50%=50% armor left
---
Tank killer is 100%-36%=64% armor left
---
Perforating mag is 100%-40%=60% armor left.
---
So combining the three would be 50%\*64%\*60%=19.2% armor left. But that doesn't mean your weapon does 80% more damage since damage done is calculated by damage of your weapon (plus limb modification) vs target armor.
---
Just use it to bash eyebots.  (Does that modifier increase bash damage as well?)
---
Something strange is going on with heavy combat plans, both me and my friend were at Harper's ferry at the same time. we were both level 77, heavy leg plans were showing for him at the vendor but when I looked they were sturdy legs for me.
---
We both have different s.p.e.c.i.a.l so the only conclusion I can think of is that has something now to do with what the vendors show plan wise to players
---
The reason pacifist is relevant is because OP is claiming they're only taking "half damage" but that is way more than slap damage would be, which lead me to inquire whether they were unintentionally initiating or reciprocating pvp. I have had someone empty the entire of their 5mm heavy ammo into me while I was in pacifist and I only used 2 stimpaks. Slap damage does damage but it's a waste of ammo. I have doubts about OP's experience.
---
You may be right -- I'm not sure, but it's one of them.
---
I fully agree with you on all points. The Enclave is highly overlooked in this game and the lack of items shows this. I'd really like to have the Enclave flag for my camp like in fo4 along with more (and clearly marked) mods for the scout armor.
---
Agreed. The duping is quite bad. And the TSE weapons were never the end solution to a much bigger problem: Terribly bad balancing. Just look at all the posts about bullet sponges. Now the TSEs have been taken out of the equasion but the bad design still stays.  
---
As well as the obvioulsy missing end game content. But instead of providing that or at least a road map we get a new pvp mode! 
---
Somehow it feels like Bethesda is slowly but surely killing the game on purpose. Maybe in preparation for free to play. Who knows.
---
It's hilarious because the "roadmap" just shows the same thing over and over again.  I mean, look at the symbols shown for the "seasons."  Battlepass, character, Weapons, Loot.  Battlepass, Character, Weapons, Loot.  Battlepass Character Weapons Loot.  Battlepasscharacterweaponsloot.
---
You don't need a map for a fucking straight line.
---
Yes I learned them. The .50 machine gun was one of the first plans I learned. I haven't moved on to my chems/food recipes yet to see which of those I can no longer craft.
---
I've had this issue. 
---
Also I thought now that cap stashes were containers, they should always be there? I've had issues were the cap stash isn't where it should be , server swap and now it's there.
---
It's random, you will probably never find one legitimately.
---
This is not true. Slap damage does not scale with damage and is capped. Multiple people focusing on one person can bring someone‚Äôs health low but it still takes time, not a few seconds.
---
More damage does not equal more slap damage. This myth needs to die.
---
do you have the speed demon mutation? that makes them run out a lot quicker, especially without class freak perk
---
I like the glowing reflex sight. Wish I could get it on my hunting rifle.
---
Make soup..serious
---
It's instigating 2X damage when the target is at full health. I've yet to find a bloodied melee though I agree the low health isn't worth the damage trade off
---
Vats targeting players, friendly npc, friendly anything has been a major issue since launch.
---
Vats should only target hostile mobs otherwise Vats is just not as efficient as it should be.
---
Yeah wish this wasn't true, but I also wish I could win the lottery.  About same odds.
---
No nuke 
---
I have class freak all the way up and I do not have speed demon. Just marsupial 
---
Last update finaly mafe me quit. I hope they fix the game in a couple months but the way they have been handling the game makes me doubt it 
---
With the sad state of RNG, we'd have better chances mining a Bitcoin than rolling anything decent.   
---
You can also Google up easily where to get the things. The event is over but nobody had to pay. It could all be easily acquired in game
---
Some people are just suckers for fashion wars tho
---
Who the fuck cares... It's just Christmas.. not like it's "gods" birthday or something.
---
I've been stashing glowing/hardened mass and HRF, but only about a dozen of each.  I want to save it for violet flux, so I've been dropping/selling flux.
---
Similarly, I've been wondering what exactly the Nuke Keycards are made of such that they weigh a pound each.  (Maybe the same stuff that bobby pins were made of until recently?)  I'd started grabbing a "get a keycard" quest every once in a while when idling around, and suddenly realized the cards are kind of heavy.  
---
I mean, the solution is to go launch a bunch of nukes, but still.
---
At level 14, either craft them or check vendors. Off the top of my head, most ranged weapons are level variants of 10, I.E. Level 1, Level 10, level 20. Melee are on the 5's meaning level 1, 5, 15, etc.
---
As far as making your weapons better damagewise, make sure you're taking the correct damage increasing perks as you level, for example if you're using a rifle, then you want the Rifleman perks. Gunslinger if you're using pistols, Gladiator if you're melee.
---
Power armor becomes useable at level 15. You'll find PA suits in certain locations, they may or may not be there because they are lootable by anyone. They also randomly have a few PA parts, so you might see a Chassis with a Leg or arm or a helmet, or a few pieces.
---
Power Armor runs on Fusion cores. Every time you find an unlooted Chassis, it should have a core with it. It won't be at 100% but it should have one. You can pull cores out of Power armor chassis or find them (at random) from Fusion generators out in the world)
---
You can also use the Workshop ad Poseidon Power Plant for 100% charge cores...just be prepared for possible pvp if someone else wants them.
---
I mean you also have to consider the fact that Bethesda‚Äôs plans and projected timeframe have likely been thrown completely out the window thanks to the absolute clusterfuck this game‚Äôs launch and ensuing issues have been. I‚Äôm fairly certain it was implied at one point (though take this with a grain of salt since I‚Äôm just speaking from half-recalled memory) that we were meant to get new content MUCH earlier, but thanks go the severity of the issues surrounding the game they‚Äôve switched mostly onto damage control. So like I don‚Äôt doubt that we‚Äôll get a roadmap eventually, but they likely won‚Äôt publish one until they feel confident that the game is stable enough that they can devote more time to working on future content/give us concrete dates that won‚Äôt have to be changed due to a rush to fix the latest batch of bugs.
---
That's ridiculous.
---
I do as much as I can. But I fly through it
---
Could be a visual bug. When I repair my weapons, I only see the bar go to 100%. But if I go to another weapon and then back, it will show 200%. 
---
Just offered up one of the reason I know that wasn't mentioned
---
Yeah but are you seeing someone destroy your camp 3 times a day? Are you being griefed every day? That is OP's experience apparently.
---
I followed this advise... i tried the server hopping option. 275 hops later i have a jetpack and 2 calibrated shocks. Took 3 days but atleast i dont have to do it again (i hope, i really, really hope).
---
\- 139 hops for the first x-01 calibrated shocks.  
---
\- +59 more hops to get a x-01 jetpack.  
---
\- +75 more hops to see another jetpack.  
---
\- +2 hops to get the final x-01 calibrated shock.
---
Now i can get back to playing the game!
---
Its a thing
---
No, they were fixing the fact that the bulk couldn't be used for crafting even if it was in your stash.  The auto-scrapping of bulk during "Scrap All Junk" is a new thing that their fix introduced.
---
Like some people have mentioned, golf outfits sell for 25 caps a piece, and are all over in Whitesprings. A single WS circuit usually gets me 5-10 golf outfits/skirts, plus a number of legendaries I can sell.
---
At least most without a mic will give the thumbs down emote.  A headshake yes or no would be most useful
---
How much for these two
---
Deep Pocketed Combat Armor Limbs  - need this 
---
BoS Combat Armor Chest Piece -  not sure if I have this need to check
---
https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-power-armor-location-guide/
---
Yup, I agree with you.  I think if the enclave events started dropping X01 mods or plans they would be a lot more interesting for folks.  The enclave events are interesting however if you think about what the Enclave is about some don't really fit into the story line to me.  Baiting in animals to kill doesn't really fit the model to me especially low level animals.  Now, change that one to baiting in a horde of glowing Deathclaws and calling it a security event, well that would make it more interesting and challenging especially if the reward included some kind of Serum that fit the fight.  SO based on what you can buy at the MODUS terminals the loot dropped by Enclave events should include, X01 mods/components, Serums, Med supplies, and energy weapons and mods (specifically gauss and plasma)
---
We're still exploring STASH increases for the future. The biggest thing is making sure our server's stay stable with whatever we increase it too. Keep an eye out on our [Known Issues and Feedback list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/?sort=new) for updates!
---
Give me a few hours and I can show you it absolutely gives you xp.
---
I am level 936.
---
On december 4th, there was an update that fixed a bug that allowed certain item effects to be stacked. If you had 2 of an item, but kept items separate in the pip-boy (showing above/below each other) you could equip one, and everything would work as usual. If you equipped the other aswell however, it would provide you the effects of the item, but not equip it. This means every time you equipped it, it added that effect.
---
Let‚Äôs say that effect was int +1.
---
Then if you spam-equipped the item, your intelligence would keep rising. I rose my intelligence to a few thousand high, I can‚Äôt remember exactly. 
---
A level one radroach gave me about 8000 xp.
---
A level 68 scorched gave me somewhere between 50,000 - 60,000 xp. I can‚Äôt tell you exactly, because every single kill leveled me up and the xp bar can‚Äôt show more than the amount needed for the next level.
---
I have a few clips and screenshots from back then if you need further proof.
---
I run a stealth sniper build and manual shoot at long range and use vats to head shot groups with gunfu at mid to close range. 
---
I have purifiers where ever I can. Never have less than 40. Plus perks help alot
---
I use all of them except Empath, which is horrible because it says you get +33% more damage, but (probably because how DR works) it is more like you get +300% more damage. I got them all and then kept removing and adding back mutations until Empath was removed.
---
I also don't have Carnivore because I got Herbivore first. I live with it. I still get the bonuses from meats, they just don't satisfy hunger.
---
I love doing silo runs solo.  Point in fact, there are a LOT less mobs when you do it solo.  Sneak and a good melee weapon make it easy mode. :)  Pro tip, if you kill a legendary, get the heck away from it before it blows.
---
Because the main design of a MMO'ish game is to keep players playing, and that is done with making grindy mechanics.
---
Nope. Clean living for me! No need to Meta.
---
It's because the game doesn't work properly.  No answer can be as simple as that.  
---
The more complex question is how a AAA studio can put out such a broken game, and charge full price for it. 
---
this would be the worst possible way to program this.
---
You only really need one rank of concentrated fire and rank 2 of sniper in my experience is more then enough to snipe outside of vats 
---
This is really not a a big deal at all you ppl get outraged for the sake ot outrage at this point go play red dead and look at its shop you may have a heart attack lol 
---
I'm obviously a very creative and mature adult.
---
Like some others are saying, I‚Äôve seen them give up and flee, yelling ‚ÄòRETREAT‚Äô before, but not this. This is really interesting- and completely out of character for the Super Mutants we‚Äôve seen in past games. Makes me wonder if it implies we‚Äôll see more friendly Super Mutants in the future, or perhaps Super Mutant based story? Certainly seems like they don‚Äôt ALL want to fight to the death...
---
you're trying to justify their ineptitude on the fact I will stop playing once I roll the stuff I want.
---
fist, that's not true. once I get the stuff I want, I'll finally be able to just explore and play the damn game. and second, it's their fault the game was released in such a barebones condition with no real content.
---
No, this is not about TSE weapons.
---
XP got nerfed, workshops got nerfed, other Perks got nerfed, Ressource collectors got nerfed 
---
And Loot of the SBQ ist still crap 
---
Auto scrapping bulk was a problem after the most recent update, wasn‚Äôt introduced with their new fix. I recall seeing tons of posts reporting this problem and it still wasn‚Äôt fixed. Unless this is a genuine ‚Äúfeature‚Äù.
---
I think people are getting bored, so they become asshats...
---
You mean you dont love that the enclave sends a care package down from orbit that has some preewar cash and a med-x?
---
I don't think it is really that grindy at all. It is very tame as far as online games go.
---
lol Power Armor.  I do this in a rad suit, with no armor. 
---
Hi all, we're hearing your feedback on the stash limit and we're currently exploring a variety of potential ways to help you hang onto more items, including an increase to stash size. We'll keep you posted as soon as we have more info to share. 
---
Hancock right here
---
It's in ur build. What perks have u invested in. 
---
Just power up Poseidon then claim the workshop and the fusion core generator will kick out a bunch of fully charged ones for you. I generally carry 13 fully charged in my inventory, which is more than enough to fuel my PA and laser Gatling. 
---
I see a lot of feedback on fusion cores, from charging them to the order that they're used in, to wanting to be able to combine them. I've shared all these thoughts with the team.
---
My main source of food I make 50-75 at a time . D u have green thumb equipped
---
I was on my low lvl alt.  This dude was just stabbing away at me quick as shit.  Prob a faster swing speed and martial artist ( or watever its called).  Dude hacked away at me so fast my health was going in seconds. 
---
Yes it only damaged me a little, but he was swinging so fast it didn‚Äôt take long at all to bring me down to near death.   I wasted about 30 stimpacks after just standing still hoping he get bored and leave.   NOPE. 
---
Id say it took about 15-20 seconds to bring me down to near death.  
---
&gt;Killing every super mutant there,  taking their weapons and scrapping them will give you more steel in 20 minutes than the plant itself will give you in an hour.
---
So you're saying active farming gives more resources than passive farming? That's a crazy concept. Just imagine if you did both at the same time?
---
I'm not saying I don't consume steel.  Just that every day I play, I end up with 500-700 Steel to burn thru after my usual explorations and questing.
---
I turn it all into either armor (for mod scrapping) or into ammo.
---
Steel is one of the top resources I end up with, even when I don't target it.  It's ubiquitous in the world.  Almost everything you pick up contains steel.
---
Well right from the start you should be able to craft some leather armor. You will find a ton of pipe guns and snipers and 10mm. If you scrap as many as you will get mods for them. As you level, keep the ones at your level and put mods on them from the ones you scrapped earlier. 
---
I would say don't just keep a gun of one type, you find random ammo. Keep one shotgun, one 10mm, one sniper (.308) scrap the rest. Make sure to store your scrap in your portable base station.
---
If you want a melee or gun build you'll need makeshift warrior, or gunsmith based on your level. Both in Intelligence tree.
---
Again I just fucking told you it's not rare and spawns at the crash site with a link to a youtube video on how to get it so what's your fucking problem.
---
Yup, super frustrating
---
If you read my OP, you would see that I spend a lot of time doing that same stuff.  How else do you think I made it past 300 hours and my main is still just level 77?
---
I have **most** of the plans that I am interested in, but getting those last few means I basically need to work a second job.  Jacking up the vendor prices on rare plans didn't help.
---
In the 'early days' I had a lot of great encounters with other players, I joined random groups all the time and I added a lot of people to my friends list.  But nobody on my friends list seems to play anymore and we have jack-wagons calling themselves raiders, going around griefing the lowbies we used to **welcome** as they left the vault.  If you join a random group out in the world, you might return to your camp to find it destroyed.
---
imo you should play support, &amp; with the way the system is set up you should be focusing on getting at least one tap per enemy.
---
so, if that high level player pops in &amp; 10 total high lvl enemies spawn, you only need to get one shot per. that way you will get xp for all 10 kills. all you gotta do is get at least one tap on each.
---
the benefits for lower level players outweigh the costs. higher level enemies means more xp &amp; better/higher level loot. the costs are weapon/armor condition &amp; ammo. all of which should be replenished by scavaging your current location &amp; said loot.
---
steel, lead, gears, springs, adhesive, aluminum, ballistic fiber, screws, plastic, rubber are the biggies as far as wpn/armr/ammo repair &amp; replenishment goes imo. if you focus on those by scrapping anything &amp; everything that contains those, including wpns/armr, you should be well equipped for whatever you need.
---
if not... well theres the day's quest. ;)
---
just remember... as the "updates/patches"(aka breaks) continue, ammo is more &amp; more important. the wpn dmg nerfs are brutal &amp; so very poorly done.
---
for ex.; my (gameplay earned) 3* AOE dragon used to do 799dps with a couple of rifleman perks, lvl4 demolition expert &amp; grenadier. it now does 369 with all the same perks.
---
my 2* instigating black powder pistol does 184 with no pistol perks &amp; not even factoring in the instigating affect!
---
lets crunch some numbers.
---
instigating blck pwdr pistol
---
184x2(for the instigating affect)=368
---
184x2(for sneak attack)=368
---
368+368=736
---
AOE dragon
---
369x2(for sneak attack)=738
---
good grief, FFS
---
I can show you a bit on an extreme example in a few hours if you still want confirmation it does rise xp. (Intelligence somewhere between 2000 - 3000)
---
Okay maybe I'm lucky, (knock on wood) but I've played this game hundreds of hours and never had my base messed with or been killed.  EVER.
---
The only ones I have in Luck are the +crit damage and the 55% crit bar use ones. My other luck points are in bloody mess and mutations
---
if you're focusing on pve then assassin's is pretty much useless wouldn't you say?
---
If it was that plus a handful of energy rifles and a fusion core, I'd be fine with it. But yea, those event rewards stick out to me the most, because US Supply crates can be better than the orbital drops. 
---
Dunno about you, but $400 isn't really giving it away. 
---
Thank you nazi police.

The sad fact is the quicker they drive away all the players the quicker they have lived up to the obligation to ‚ÄúProvide DLC for free as long as players are still playing‚Äù.  
---
This game is a huge flop and represents most scummy practices in the industry today. From early release disguised as a beta, to the company adding paid for cosmetics on a regular basis yet somehow avoiding adding any in game content, overpriced cosmetics that rarely display as shown in atom shop, rolling the game back to a prior state rather than actually coding in fixes, the ‚Äúcanvas‚Äù bags, the Tricentennial Edition, etc..
---
Most true fans of Fallout are being driven away by the companies scummy money grubbing practices.  No one asked for a PvP centric game yet that is the main focus at this point. Give it another quarter of flopping and Bethesda will probably add a free battle royal mode, and focus solely on selling skins. 
---
As much as all of us want to love this game, it‚Äôs unlovable. At this point the whole net frame and most of the base code would have to be altered drastically just to bring the game back to a stable condition. That‚Äôs a lot, lot, lot, lot of lines of code that would need to be completely re written to stabilize this game. 
---
A simple cost benefit analysis will show that at this point this game will serve Bethesda best by dying out quickly.  The rate of players quitting has surpassed the influx of new players and the negative but truthful press about the state of the game all but assured it will continue to loose more players than it attracts. 
---
Hopefully you were one of the folks that bought the game at a drastically reduced price. Unfortunately for me I purchased the Tricentennial Edition on a pre order the day it was made available.  
---
I noticed I need food way more often after the hot fix too. I would not say 5-10 minutes after I max it out but noticeable. Don‚Äôt have any diseases or mutations but marsupial 
---
It's something that didn't really start with the latest "hotfix" but got much much worse with it.  It seems to be based on the number of people that tagged the enemy.  If I'm going solo, I never run into it... kill get loot instantly.  But as more people show up, it gets worse and worse.  4 people is somewhat manageable, but 8+ people and I'll be waiting 20mins to collect loot.
---
I believe it may be part of their "optimizations", it seems to take it's sweet time loading loot for each person that tagged the enemy, one at a time.  We had 12 people rolling in a party and basically just us on the server.  We did uranium fever... and the loot load not only affected enemy corpses, but also event ending rewards.  Basically, everyone started getting their event complete notice one after another, about 1 min apart.  And shortly after that notice, they were getting loot from the corpses.
---
I dropped my first explosive weapon after over 700 hours of gameplay. and it was mutant's.
---
care to say that again?
---
I guess in all fairness all the Vault dwellers being dead makes a lot more sense than everyone in Appalachia being dead, since it‚Äôs rare to find more than one Vault in ANY Fallout where everybody‚Äôs NOT dead, lmao.
---
Right. Like that one, too.
---
About this:  **Issue: Fusion Core Drain is exceptionally high, even with Perk Cards.** 
---
I just did some testing with a friend.
---
The test was simple. We checked the percentage on the fusion core, outside the power armor, then get into the power armor, aim at something and press Alt to hold the breath until all the action points are over.
---
On my test, with 180 action points, the fusion core reduced 9%. On my friends test, with 190 action opints, the fusion core reduced 10%.
---
When using vats, I hit Q until all my AP was over, once again the reduction was also 9%.
---
All tests were made without perks.
---
PS: I tested sprinting until my AP was over, but not a single percentage dropped from the fusion core.
---
Even this.
---
But the two nails are terrible.
---
Considering raw flux spoils in like, 10 minutes....it wouldn't be that far fetched to think the nuke plants that did exist have all wasted away by now, and any that were used in production were produced at a refinery much like oil today. 
---
A little nuclear greenhouse. Grow some plants, then blast it with radiation, then quickly refine to stable flux.
---
It's definitely an exaggeration.  Guys play two weeks and have no issues, get killed once at a workshop then make up some kinda B's posts for Reddit lol
---
Totally agree, though those mechanics can take different forms. Grindy mechanics that give people some sense of progress (e.g. if I collect 20 of these annoying-to-find but reasonable drop rate items, I can get this cool thing I want) is a lot more satisfying due to the visible progress than the all-or-nothing RNG grinding we currently have. If you're no closer to your goal after several hours of grinding the act becomes a lot harder to justify.
---
Well, think about the time line for this game.  not a lot of time has gone by since the bombs dropped so all that old cash would still be around possibly.  Now for FO4, that wouldn't necessarily be the case since its well into the future in the time line....
---
Can you guys boost the build budget?  It would be even more awesome.  I hate how turrets take up like 25% of your budget everytime you place it too.
---
The entire mechanic for consumption/durability etc is fucked.  I‚Äôd expect a patch Soon(tm).
---
Yeah I heard there's a new dupe that involves crashing servers.  Bad enough the inbreds ruin the economy, now they ruin the actual ability to play.  For what exactly?
---
Someone explained how bethesda screwed up the bulk "fix". Too lazy to find the post but pretty much shoddy/lazy/inept programming.
---
See, it‚Äôs such a shame that if we see you in game we won‚Äôt know to say ‚ÄúHa HAAA, GaAaRrRyYy!‚Äù
---
hmmm, build defensive turrets but don't allow them to defend..  Doesn't sound right to me
---
I'd like to add that fists should require gloves,  and Armour needs to be removed completely...way too OP.
---
I think fighting nude is the only fair way to go. (except the gloves)
---
Or they should have done a beta period. The beta as we know it was just early access for the most part to he same exact game.
---
Maybe something to do with the hot fix? Some perk or effect that wouldn't have mattered before which now impacts you?
---
Ya i have had enemies spawn in the top floor of my camp lol
---
Weight reduction perks shouldnt be passive. Things should just weigh less. The point was made before, but fallout rifles often have more weight than crew serve weapons.
---
I'm not defending their (overflowing) ineptitude at all. This is more of an argument that there needs to be more content, particularly content that gives people something to work on that gives at least some small reward for time invested. But as it stands, if they made the grind easier, I think they'd lose a lot of players.
---
And not to be contrary, but what stuff do you want that you feel you can't explore and play the game with now? I found it pretty easy to get to endgame content with no better equipment than I could craft except for a few 1* legendary armor pieces I found on vendors.
---
Yeah I just can't believe you get griefed twice a day, those are insane numbers. I have my camp right smack dab in the middle of Flatwoods, one of the busiest areas in the game, and people still don't bother it. Nobody is out there attacking "a plank of wood".  
---
"I always see at least a few wanted players on the map, hence me avoiding those areas preventing me from progressing through the quest line"  
---
Bull poop. And you could always just leave and rejoin.
---
Basically, and because I think Bethesdas "physics" are hilarious to screw with. It's so stupid and it makes me chuckle every time I come home. 
---
So something bad happened in a post-apocalyptic wasteland and you are upset. Not everything needs to be an eye for an eye and people have the choice on how they behave. Thats how it goes.
---
.. I had the opposite problem. Moved my camp and it saved it about 20 times. Each time I'd try to delete a camp it would freeze. I spent hours deleting thousands of objects. Seriously, I had 1000 walls. 800 succulents. EVERY SINGLE ITEM was to the nth power. 
---
So you expect a team of artists and modelers to pack their things and head over to QA/Code writing/Bug fixing? 
---
it must be because it is the only new content that is seen, above for money xd the store does not bother, annoying that they try to take us money when the game seems early access 
---
Might have to agree to disagree then. Frankly, it feels like the grind is all this game has going for it once you nuke nuke Fissure Prime.
---
Ok, and? I never said nothing took a while to do, but compared to a lot of other games, this game isn't grindy.
---
Wait....you can stack foundations?????
---
"I get one-shot killed at least 5 times a day and my camp is destroyed every single time I log in"
---
Most likely it would be a faux green house like the ones in ark Tek where they had seeled boxes where they were working on plants, pump in enough rads and Wala instant rad plants simple farm
---
Worked fine after the hotfix though.  
---
Grafton day is a crazy easy event to farm with server hop too, with caps + stims for each kill and about a 20 second kill time assuming high level.
---
Could be that then. Maybe I got the effect without the notification or pipboy entry. Is disease farming a thing yet?
---
Reported and added.
---
Could have been clearer. This is an XBox one x. $400 is as cheap as one has ever been. All non FO76 bundles are $500.
---
I have so much Flux I don't even know what to do with it. Put on the perk that doubles your plant harvest. Ridiculous mats for dayz.
---
Isolated and reported, the "gloves" ArmorAddon is missing the correct material swap.
---
That's a different issue tho. It's the lack of end game content past Fissure Prime sealing.
---
Right now grinding and gearing up for the next PVE content is all there is.
---
**seven hundred hours**
---
I've played lots of online games and yes, that's pretty fucking ridiculous.
---
watoga has a few mininuke spawns. people have already posted the other locations the other is the roof of EMS.

Maybe if they had not invested time in that, the game would be different right now  but no, they needed to get money from the fools who buy skins 
---
So? Not seeing why this is a bad thing
---
Ive learned not to horde in this game. Either sell it drop it or switch it to a mule. 
---
That's not how I remember it.  Human memory being a faulty thing, I could of course be wrong.  Me being lazy, I'm also not going to check.  Basically I'm no help at all.  Hi!
---
How is this relevant
---
Can someone provide me with a link to the atom shop road map?
---
U I surely will be gone too if they do so and focus on something like Battle Royale. I hope the upcoming PvP content will lure away those fucking PvP griefers from adventure servers, so I'm fine with it. 
---
Agree completely.
---
I did play, but made sure to give everyone a wide berth, didn't even help the defending workshops missions, which is one mission that I see pop up and jump to help.  Most of the time, the owner is not there, and all there stuff is damaged.  
---
The private servers may not get rid of the issue completely, but at least if I own the server, I can boot you.  
---
PVE mode is what is needed as you stated.  Something that removes the PVP function, unless you are taking over a workshop, then you should be in PVP until takeover is complete, then the only time would be if someone was to try to take over the workshop from you, but then it is only you and that other player, not the 30 people sitting behind him.
---
That's kinda my point. Absent PvP (which it seems the majority don't really care for) or any further content, the grind is all people have left.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
You're. Irony.
---
Why not play New Vegas instead?
---
I have a 3 rank and a 1 rank card. The 3 is for when I run commando perks, the 1 I use with rifle.
---
Alright, my bad. Was 100% positive it was there. Still a shitty bug as always.
---
We're aware of this one and investigation into it is ongoing. Other reports we've received haven't mentioned the Bloody Mess perk, so that may be unrelated, but we can discuss it. Thank you!
---
I'm not sure what you mean. The keypad is part of the pylon. It's set up to run from the generator to the interior switch, to the exterior pylon switch with keypad to the door, then to spotlight with turns on only when the door is open.
---
Then again, their game is mostly functional and they've done this rodeo before so their main priority is content creation.
---
Bethesda has a different priority of troubleshooting/repair. If you ever turned wrenches/been a mechanic, you'd know why you can't put a timeframe on fixes/troubleshooting.
---
Bloodied works for range too.  Can kill sbq in seconds with the right bloodied weapon. 
---
&gt;But as it stands, if they made the grind easier, I think they'd lose a lot of players.
---
that's a piss poor justification nonetheless. skinner boxes being the reward themselves is poor game design, plain and simple.
---
&gt;And not to be contrary, but what stuff do you want that you feel you can't explore and play the game with now?
---
it's not that I can't, but rather that I want. I minmax in every game I play, even singleplayers. although this is wholly subjective.
---
I'm sorry you've spent an average of almost 8 hours a day since release, but that is just unlucky on your end. Many other people obviously have had better luck. You are more an exception, not a rule.
---
That's pretty awesome
---
I would think you‚Äôd be better off just having some perk cards that reduce the drain rate of fusion cores. (Also 78 seems to be a bit much). If you‚Äôre exploring quite a bit, which I assume you must be since you have so many. You should be able to them as your exploring. I don‚Äôt think I ever had more than 15-20 at a time.
---
You make no sense

Sentry bots are one of the few mobs I actually fear. How do you do enough damage to take 'em out? What build?

If they crossed escape from tarkov and 76 it would be the most bad ass game.. tarkov is probably a little bit too harsh but the survival aspect is real and intense not to mention better graphics and animations. That said I think 76 is actually more fun since you can actually chill and play and one is always progressing as a character. 
---
Tldr: take a bit of tarkovs hard core survival, weapon modding and animations crossed with fallout story, lore, rpg elements and character progression = ideal post apocalyptic open world rpg.
---
Isolated and reported.
---
I hope not, I can only see F2P ultimately ending poorly for this game.  Sure, it helped some other games I used to play, *at least in the short term*.
---
But, I'm not playing those games anymore either.
---
Personally, I would have preferred a split PvP/PvE to begin with, most other MMOs already do that.  The tap system was an interesting experiment, but people sure learned to game the system in a hurry.
---
A headshot with a .50 rifle should kill nearly anything. This game is not about realism...
---
I have a full set of legendary 2-3* heavy Weightless Combat Armor. None of the pieces dropped as BoS but I modded them all to it. If you need someone to mod Combat Armor to the BoS material and are on PC, come and find me. That's one of the most requested modding services I provide.
---
You didn't go in the basement? 
---
All three power plants have fusion core processors, it's not just Poseidon.
---
I stopped playing two weeks ago.  Didn't feel the need to make a post about it.  And I'm sure I'll stop playing the game I'm playing now too.   That's why we all have 200+ games in our steam library.   :). Move along, come back later. You will.  :p
---
on release, me and some other people did a rough estimate on the chances of rolling a godly shotgun. it was close to 0.000001.
---
so yeah, no. the vast majority of good rolls on the market as it stands are the result of duping, not actual drops.
---
I heard about the old X02 enclave armor...  Not sure which game it was in but that would be a cool new addition to the Enclave loot.  Maybe and upgraded X01 set  with the carry weight bonus of Excavation.  Here's an image I found for it

Let your compassion fall to the wayside. As once the raider mode comes out you will be right there alongside him, whacking other little ITSNOFAIRs. All as it should be.
---
I'm probably going to explain this poorly. I think it was FO3 that allowed you to just keep selling and buying you could essentially barter with the npc traders X item had X value so you could essentially just trade straight across until either you or the vendor was either out of caps or stuff you wanted. I wish there was a way to implement that. 
---
I am working on adapting I was also just kicking out the idea.
---
&gt; Auto scrapping bulk was a problem after the most recent update, wasn‚Äôt introduced with their new fix
---
No, the patch was so that mods would not be auto consumed when crafting/repairing.  But the mod patch made it so bulk items would not be consumed with crafting/repairing either, meaning you had to scrap them manually when ever crafting/repairing.
---
The hotfix for the Bulk items not being consumed properly when repairing and crafting introduced the "bug" that Bulk items are now automatically scrapped when hitting Scrap All Junk.

Unfortunately X-02/Enclave APA is developed pretty much a century or so after the war, but some new models of PA would be nice, maybe in the vein of Ultracite PA.

there should never, ever be bonuses to stats from cosmetics in this game, what the fuck bethseda. it's bad enough this is a full priced game with freemium cosmetic prices but now you want to make it pay to win?
---
Agreed.
---
Actually i just bought it about a month ago.  Figured it was a fallout game.  So when I saw it at Game stop, i picked it up.  Its ok.  It will never work as a pvp game though.  Not sure why all the big game companies take a good game and break the fuck out of it to try to please a tiny niche group of people.  
---
The perk system would be cool if you could actually build it correctly from the start instead of being spoon fed useless cards and wasting points in perks you dont need.  And now after this round of nerfs i will need to level 18 more times to fix what they fucked up and i have to play with broken shit with no way to correct it in a remotely reasonable amount of time.  And im sure all that will go to shit after the next debacle of a patch.

Maybe health and armor should be nerfed, but more spawn.
---
That's really the same before or after TSE nerf, though. :)
---
Before TSE was pervasive we used to use rifles to cripple her. The whole fight leverages almost equally on how fast you can get her out of the air and how many players are around. If you have a whole team of people humping the weapons bench you're going to have a bad time, but usually they'll run out and hit her with Assaultron Blades when she lands....

Reported and added, thanks.
---
&gt;Setting up extractors and gathering from them feels like a waste of time and resources. 
---
I'll usually set up at least things like steel, lead, and junk. It doesn't take but a second, and you generally get enough free resources with taking the workshop to set up 3 or 4 extractors and generators. I leave them unlocked. If someone comes along and empties them, glad to help out. If not, I'll shoot them when I pop back in for a defense event. 100% free resources. The only real drawback to workshops is that they can open you up to unwanted pvp, even if you are nowhere near the workshop.
---
I hear that. I didn‚Äôt mean to invalidate your experience but it‚Äôs nuts how much misinformation is parroted on this sub which may then be influencing Beth because the community is very persistent and vocal.
---
I still think slap damage was really odd design choice. If you want a consensual PvP system why have a mechanic that does any amount of non-consensual damage?
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to the survival servers and think it will do a lot to allow people more choice of what experience they want.

I‚Äôll say!

Just got the All Rise at level 50, the problem was that the legendary that was dropped with All Rise boss, was a Fire Ax that does just as much damage, but swings 40% faster, and has the 100% Vats to hit, and 40% drop in Vats AP cost if sneaking(Technically , not in combat.

But yes it does change the overall way that I play as well.  I will shoot them a couple times with the lever action, maybe the handmade, and then finish them with the Fire Ax.

I have the perk card , I just dont use it anymore. But not  a bad idea to just equip that and go farm corn or somthing
---
A couple artists and modelers showing up a week or two earlier ain't going to change the fact that the issue is the game's code, servers and balancing. Artists and modelers work on art, they do not work on codes and the like. 
---
As far as I can see, the artists did their job since hardly any of the complaints were about the art or models. In fact, they already have models for the next dlc lined up. Now it is up to the coders and the server techs to fix the game.
---
What were the stats of marine shielded? Plz
---
My strategy is to pull cores at &lt;10% charge and put in a new one. When I've for half a dozen low charge ones, I super duper up some ultracute fusion cores. They come out at 110%, weigh the same, and cost one violet flux to craft. Crafting standard ones take one of every flux. The counter on the power gauge can't see them, but they work exactly like regular ones otherwise.

 Nice, Don‚Äôt have as many ammo problems as I did at lower levels. Once you get to know the junk you need it is easy to cherry pick. If I do get low I hit the gyms up early in the morning before work. Two gyms gets me about 1000 rounds with the Ammosmith perk.

Quick camps are definitely an advantage. I have mine integrated with an existing structure so I have stuck around far longer than I should have. It is quiet, the fishing is good, and I have a good view. It does cost me more caps than it should to Fast Travel.

VATS really shines when you are killing waves of enemies that you can put down with one shot (especially if you are running Adrenaline and Gun-Fu).

You can't run all of the rifle and VATS perks at the same time, but by level 70 or so you can unlock and max them all and change them out according to the situation.

I just mean that someone with more skill can die to a less experienced player with a ton of turrets.
---
Isolated, reported... Getting report fatigue
---
well that sucks :/ Condolences for your time...
---
By double do you mean two shot? Cuz I believe my friend has a two shot dragon
---
Le gasp, a non toxic post lol, grats
---
Level is not an indication of skill. 
---
Lots of good feedback in here that I'll be sorting through today. Definitely a topic we can bring up for discussion. Thank you!
---
Could be on to something there...
---
tips 4 and 5 make it sound less of a raider like and more of a douche.
---
no it's for his high level friend or friends, but that tends to be a 5% chance
---
Thank you for all of this. Bethesda should hire you!
---
Agree with this 100%. It is probably good to have Concentrated Fire and Long Shot available and switch them out situationally. The extra range of Long Shot is great if you are sniping manually but it is virtually useless for VATS.
---
I always dump into the suitcases at stations. I always check them for things I need. 
---
Pay it forward. üòÅ
---
Fair, mainly meant if you found it in the wild, regardless added and reported

All of the Cobalt Flux you can find around the Whitesprings is in the areas on the immediate outskirts of the Whitesprings - nuked Silt Beans and Glowing Resin becomes cobalt flux. The resin is easy to spot since it glows bright blue on trees, the nuked silt beans are green and kind of a pain to spot - look around the waste disposal site just north of the Whitesprings and you'll find some. It can get kind of annoying because if someone doesn't nuke Whitesprings in the right spot then the outskirts won't get nuked.
---
How much Cobalt do you still need? I can sell you some, preferably for 25 caps a piece. 
---
Ok always looking for a better weapon so that fire ax sounds great.  I have a high powered shot gun I use but for certain foes like the moleman and higher level super mutants, feral ghouls (those bloated ones)  and some bugs. A couple of good swings does it. Took down. Diseased level 92 death claw with it too.
---
are raiders not douches? they kill and destroy in an apocalypse 
---
My tse handmade is junk now.  The amount of ammo i craft is not worth it for what i get back.  A basic pump shotty is more useful and efficient and does more damage.
---
Negative. What are you doing where you dc? 
---
Traveling a road at night, then suddenly see two red glowing eyes. You freeze. You move left, they move left...
---
Ok, and? Like i said, i never said nothing took a while to do. But as online games go, this game isnt that grindy. Pretty much everything is achievable within a month.
---
Ballistic Fiber - Camp whatever it's name is where you join the Army, (sorry old lady memory) Fort Defiance and most BOS hangouts have the Military Bags. I'm swimming in it!
---
It's not that they do a lot of damage, it's that they have really high armor penetration, do your 400 DR is meaningless.
---
Toxic dried lakebed (lake above grafton) has loooooads of bloodleaf.
---
Fair, and you could be correct, just don't think it's just that...
---
...back from Anthem. They limit servers to 4 players because they can't fix this either. At least 76 is ambitious even if most of the unimaginative player base only wants it dumbed down and easier.
---
Welcome to the bleeding cutting edge of MMO's.
---
I deal in chems.
---
I'm on Xbox and I'm disconnected every 15-30mins.... Bethesda support pretty much brushed off my ticket on the issue.
---
If I've learned one lesson from FO76 its to not buy another Bethesda release till its on the discount rack!
---
Logging in 
---
not relevant
---
You aren't actually finding or purchasing a pre-built mod. You either buy the plan, then learn it, or learn it by scrapping. Either way, you still have to craft it.
---
Those "walls" are THICC.
---
Bring back TSE NOW. The fun was nerfed completely with that patch. Played once or twice since Nerf. Everything is bullet sponges now. Not fun. I love the wasteland. The feel of the environment music and tone ect. But that Nerf killed the game. 
---
    PVP ruins games especially when they balance PVE for PVP. That's the quickest way to kill a game destiny did it you didn't learn from their mistakes devs!!! 
---
    If you were trying to balance the game for PVP then make perk cards for that PVP two shots explosive damage reduction. Don't be lazy and just Nerf guns to ruin. 
---
     If you want to breathe new life into this game start getting innovative and fix the servers. Bring back the two shot explosive damage. start buffing things everything just feels like bullet sponges and it's not fun you didn't learn from the division bullet sponges ????? 
---
     Want to talk about balance I'm level 130 level 68 super mutants wreck me unless I'm using melee and then I have to Respec everything that cost points every Respec of special should be free!!!!!;
---
   Fallout 3 and 4 we're 10 times better than this game. You didn't Nerf the crud out of them for PVP!!!! 
---
   You nerfed fusion cores you nerfed materials gain per hour you did a Guinness book of world records Nerf to two shot explosives. It's like the negative 1.25 shot now it's absolutely atrocious. You nerfed the spawn rate of 3 * enemies. You're out of control bastelda!!! 
---
    You can't play for more than an hour without the servers crashing. it's your servers. The one thing that kept me going was the environment and the two shot explosive guns. Now that's gone thanks a lot for ruining the fun in the game. 
---
      I really do want to play this game and enjoy it but I'm not going to until you bring back the two shot explosive. It's not worth my time the only thing the scorched beast Queen gives me is armor and more armor and more armor and stuff I don't need or nothing at all because there's problems with the servers or they crash and then I don't get anything at all!!! When I was playing on get excited I'd say 3 * and then guess what I get nothing good!!!! Never get weapons!!!! 
---
    Certain perk card should be Learned for Good like lockpick and hacker. It really sucks because there's only so many cards I got to go in my cards and change them out so I can unlock the safe or hack this computer great job that's a failure the perk system is a failure. Fallout 4 with a hundred times better once you leveled up and learned it the new it for good that was great. This perc card system is absolutely atrocious!!!! It was a huge mistake huge failure!!!!! 
---
     I love fallout but I HATE This!!! Start buffing. Fix servers!! Give us 10 more points to put in special at the minimum!!!!! Fix the game bring back players. I don't know if you can pull off what the division did but try. Thank God anthem and metro Exodus come out soon!!! 
---
I do love the marsupial mutation
---
I avoided mutations during opening weak because they were all buggy. They're still all buggy, but in different ways now. :)
---
Are you just standing on a barrel "farming" them, by chance? That's not the best way to play... try to get serums from players or buy the recipes and make them yourself. That way you can wipe and replace if you decide you want to roulette wiping Herd Mentality but don't want to lose Adrenal Reaction.
---
I'm not sure I could play without Speed Demon. I could probably live without Marsupial but I would be sad. Adrenal Reaction, Talons, Twisted Muscles, Herd Mentality, etc is kind of usage specific. Egghead doesn't deserve to exist in the game because no one can sort out what it's for.
---
They changed the way reconnecting works because of people server hopping, you need to close out of the game entirely and relaunch it to get a new world 
---
Omfg they didn't even understand this lolol
---
I try to dump my 38 at the Overseer's camp, along with some leather armour, pipe weaps and food/water for good karma just incase the RNG Gods are watching
---
Other than it being a bug, the only thing I can think of is that the timer ran out.
---
Great info, thanks!   
---
**Follow up Questions:**.  
---
-Was it 9% roughly, lost after a single shot?  
---
-When sprinting did you have perks equipped?
---
All this means is eventually they will nerf melee to be useless as well not buff guns, that's how they work sadly.
---
Btw without unyielding how do u get 35 strength? 
---
I hate there is no mechanism to upgrade lower level weapons.
---
Look for an event in the forest near a lighthouse. It's a guaranteed encounter with a peaceful Mothman.
---
Min range. Well I think next to the artillery. Max range still trying to figure it out. It seems to be different if someones near your camp. But they dont do a lot of damage and once you throw it they scatter. It is amusing though
---
S9, P9. E8, C4, I6, A9, L11
---
Provides the perk card flexibility to swap out of different builds.  The L11 assumes mutations. 
---
You don't find the mothman. It finds you.
---
This here is a nice guide! If you are on PC and ever need gunsmithing, armor smithing, tailoring, or a spot of tea come on down to Bear's Gun and Paw (We buy gold!). Old Bear will getcha sorted!
---
Sure I will message you the exact load out as soon as I am on my home PC. Thank you for taking the time to help us.
---
You are wrong.
---
It is explosive. It is affected by ONLY demolition expert.
---
The cannonballs explode.
---
The weapon is labelled as a launcher, same as all the other explosive weapons.
---
The explosive modifier has nothing to do with this at all, I never once mentioned it.
---
Sick as fuck
---
&gt;Having played hundreds of games across all genres this game is just weird. The balance is so skewed they must have all been heavily drinking whilst designing it because none of it makes much sense. It's like they hired people who have never played games before to design a game... How do you mess up the balance and values of everything this bad?
---
So much this. If you just compare the game to indie survival sandbox games currently in early access, with a tiny fraction of their budget and price, it's laughable how bad it is in almost every aspect.
---
are you no reading my replies? **0.000001%**. that's a whole lot more than just a month. took me over **700 hours** to roll a fraction of that.
---
regardless of whether I'm unlucky, those odds are simply absurd.
---
That us different than the game being too Grundy. That is indeed an issue, but that doesn't mean the game is inherently Grundy. As he said, the grind is a result if lack of end game content, but getting to the end game as it is is not really a grind at all.
---
Sounds like you walked through an event. He's said the same to me before when I ignored some event. 
---
Fill your camp with lamps?
---
You don't need the crafting perks to install a mod you buy from a vendor. It shows the crafting requirements, but as long as you have the loose mod you can still attach it. 
---
Rip fusion core plan idea
---
honestly I think the 200 caps wouldn't be a terrible concept IF IF IF IF we got more then 20% returns on purchases 
---
if we got say 50% back and purchases over 200 still counted where we could buy and sell do a lot more trading at least 
---
example 200 caps in vendor I buy a 2000 caps item I now have 1200 caps to buy back 
---
*shrug*   
---
Thanks, but won't lie, would rather be a "consultant", not sure I want a full time job in the industry, I've read it's brutal and kills some of the move for gaming.   
---
I'd rather just have the ability to fix all of this, takes me about 3 times longer to submit a bug through Bethesda's website than it would for me to just FIX it, and keep a change log.
---
Probably near one of the Enclave Events.
---
Its bugged.  I had 13 minutes on the timer.  It just bugged out again but gave me a completion and reward.  Killed 1 of 3 farmhands and it completed the event.  Literally no one remotely close to me.  Nuke went off at the fissure and everyone is there.  At least i got a reward this time.
---
A hunting rifle, properly modded, is a great early game weapon. You should be able to take out level 5 super mutants at Wade Airport and other places for them. Scrap them all until you learn the mods that make it more powerful (look for mods that have "superior" in their descriptions when crafting). Before too long, you'll know every single mod, and you can build a really powerful rifle.
---
well its the obvious answer since 90% of weight isn't full charged fusion cores its the 12% cores at the bottom 
---
If you are using a lot of chems it will make you need food/water faster. I just plant corn, use the green thumb perk to get 2x, then make sure I have super duper perk on and make corn soup. I do that every time I am at my camp unless I have 40+ of it.
---
So this is still happening? Shortly after release, I was partnered with another player and we did the early story mission where you have to restore something at a water park. We get there and are surprised to find no enemies anywhere. Suddenly we both start hearing nearby Scorched attacking us, and we start taking damage. Get killed by invisible trash mobs.
---
Closed the game, haven't played since. What a travesty of a game.
---
Someone's obviously never experienced late game FO4 or 76.
---
Almost every pen and paper rpg on the planet absolutely has bullet sponge enemies. It is a terrible mechanic, but it is there. Honestly I am not sure people can handle a more realistic simulation system where weapons worked as they should.
---
I think the foundation blocks are indestructible but I'm not sure they hold much back...as I've had building components attacked through them and light gets into the room through them. 
---
Seems most traders are Xbox or PlayStation I'm a PC user, thanks anyway!
---
9% just holding the breath on test 1.
---
9% just pressing Q until the AP were over.
---
No shots fired on both tests.
---
Of topic but how do you add the faction tag next to your username?
---
Hey thanks for the advice! I did spot a few glowing resin since they‚Äôre super obvious but the silt beans really blend in with the environment, so I probably missed a bunch around the area you mentioned. I guess it‚Äôs mostly just Fissure Site Prime that seems to be completely devoid of any Cobalt Flux. 
---
I only need two stable fluxes for the lining if you‚Äôre willing to trade/sell. :)
---
True, but the stash should be big enough to keep Interesring armor sets and weapons......its not.
---
Even with 0 junk there and lightweight on everything I still cant store full sets of all the armor,  that's just shitty, what if I want to collect 3star legendary sets of armor And some good weapons to try alternate builds.
---
As it stands now you cant store enough weapons to try a different build so u simply have to drop them......weapons that are 1 in 1k drop get tossed because we literally have no dam room to store anything that's not our current build.
---
lmao.. i only carry 3 on me and 3 in my storage.. i never run out of cores. Maybe when they balance the laser gatling gun i'll regret it, but i can spend time/space searching for them at that point.
---
I build houses and started a few concept characters I have a team medic I play only when friends on we both avoid power armor (heavy combat armor) I'm a sniper hes a automatic rifles he runs around pulling enemies 
---
I've got team medic 3 hes got rad sponge 3 giving us a solid heal / rad shield 
---
What recipe? I‚Äôm tired of having to craft 10 boiled water every  play session. 
---
My characters all have stupid descriptive names because I knew they wouldn't be used.
---
Also Microsoft requires that the gamer tag be visible for some reason.
---
This is clearly an altar to summon the mighty Mothman.
---
Again, I never said nothing took a while to do, but as the game is, overall it is not grindy.
---
I've played guild wars 2 for over 2000 hours and never found a precursor item for a legendary, and subsequently never had a legendary item. 
---
Fo76 is far from grindy. If you limit it to just that one weapon, sure, but that isn't the whole game.
---
The fact that you're trying to defend this shit hole reddit is proof I'm right lol
---
Bethesda was trying to give people what they wanted, people complained, Bethesda changed stuff, people complain more
---
It seems most fallout fans are self centered brats who are never happy.
---
People complained Tse was op. It got nerfed. They still complain because they're not happy with the changes.
---
Get rekt
---
Thanks! If anyone else needs Cobalt Flux, I‚Äôll be sure to nuke that area when I‚Äôm ready to tackle a silo. :)
---
It doesn't ‚òπÔ∏è 
---
If you do through this guy's post history you'll see he doesn't get this game at all. Graham has the Arrow plans, the Grenade perks do affect grenades, suprising I know. Now he blows up noobs camps to RP being a raider. One of his posts is just asking where everyone puts their camps. Hey Mods, do me a favor and ban one of us from the sub. I don't want to accidentally help this guy. 
---
You don't happen to have a decent lvl 25-30 melee legendary? 
---
Need one badly for my ult. Everyone just drops their low level weapons. :(
---
Maybe Bethesda should post the files on GitHub and allow pull requests for fixes. :) Thanks again for your contributions. I hope Bethesda takes your reports seriously and fixes them. You have amazing attention to detail and patience to work through their time consuming process.
---
Yeah I know this and avoid using chems.  Do stimpacks affect your water as well? Was never sure if they do
---
600 is fine to me.
---
At first I was like this in not enough, what are we supposed to do with this, but now I find it more than enough.  I just had to change the way I stored anything.
---
No weapons stored other than Blade of Baset, and Voice of Set, and the All Rise.  Nothing but PA in apparel, and bobbleheads and mags in Aid.  Everything else is stored as bulk junk, until I get 10 of the bulk then everything after is sold.  The loose stuff that can not be bulked, has a cap limit of 50, everything else gets sold.
---
This is the new way to play, and it works for me.  Ammo is stored but only 1000 rounds, no missles, or anything that has high weight.
---
Normally around 400 pounds/units in there, and can store just about anything that I pick up and scrap.
---
But increase in stash would increase server resources so I am okay if they don't update the stash limit.
---
So, what do you enjoy most?  I enjoyed exploring the world and following all of the various stories.  It's a lot deeper than many people gave it credit for.   Sure, it could be better, but it's not devoid of story.
---
Unfortunately, I have completed almost all of the quest lines I've come across and have mostly dailies, events and repeatable side quests.  I haven't finished the main quest yet, just because I no longer have a group to do the final nuke run.
---
However, my personal guess is that you are just a **troll** with nothing else better to do, never really adding meaningful discussion to any of the threads you touch.
---
If you search properly, you can get around 30 raw  cobalt flux at whitespring, this is considering that you have green thumb perk to give you double, whitespring is probobly the best place to make your stable flux because you will be guarenteed lots of ghouls that have glowing mass, high radiation fluids, and hardened mass, btw, in the whitesprings bunker, there are notes that show you what type of flora will turn into a specific flux, also, i havent tested this but there are two farms in the toxic valley area that you can probobly hit with one nuke, and that will yield a decent amount of flux
---
Ya you can, 15 tops for any single stat.
---
My source is my 20+ int character compared to my 4 int character. Feel free to grab a box of mentats or some other source of int gain and kill 2 identical enemies with and without the bonus int.
---
!!!
---
This requires a sort of glitchy method to reproduce. Any word on if it will be patched?
---
Love this change. Move your camp
---
somewhere else or don‚Äôt establish it somewhere scorchbeasts spawn if you can‚Äôt handle them.
---
If your on PS4 I'll make you a handmade rifle, even non legendary it kills most everything in a few shots.  Other alternatives are the lever action and possibly combat, tho lever action AMD handmade are the best for killing while conserving some ammo.
---
"The katun is established at Chichen Itza. The settlement of the Itza shall take place there. The Quetzal shall come, the green bird shall come. Ah Kantenal shall come. It is the word of God. The Itza shall come."
---
Exactly, one for one dude. Do what you must and I will what makes me feel better. You screw with me I am going to screw with you. Yes it is childish and petty but so be it until things change in the game and we get a proper passive mode.
---
I couldn't figure out why my stash was too full. Then I looked at by steel. I had 5000 steel. I'll never need that much but had it anyways. Then I bulked everything else and save 100 pounds.
---
Sounds about right. I averaged 1 disconnect per hour on my best days. Since then it‚Äôs more like every 10 seconds, so I eventually gave up. 
---
there are so many **little** things they could do to please  this angry crowd....
---
\-better stuff in the atom shop....seriously...look at that stuff and the price.
---
\-higher legendary enemy spawns...dont need to drop great stuff (just like now), but makes it more fun hoping for something awesome.
---
\-More enemies! I shouldn't be able to walk up and down the bog and only see a few creatures..bring em on!
---
other ideas??
---
I really wish we could use purified water for cooking.   Strange decision no to make it so.
---
Well, I have never encountered the issue except for once, and that time she came back.
---
Crashes and server instability has ruined countless more SBQ fights than this bug. Low urgency, I'd say so.
---
Hmm trying to add serrated blade to a knife, a mod I've found, the option is not greyed out but it will not work.
---
I recently put my pc on a crash diet and she can fast travel in the Excavator pa at the moment.  I can't tell you how lovely it was, the first time since I started the game...
---
I have only seen 2 and killed none
---
I see a lot of people reply to these types of posts with the same responses, ( I've played hundreds of hours and have only been attacked once or twice)congratulations, good for you, you are lucky. That does not mean that all other players have the same experience. With so many people playing it comes down to wrong place at wrong time. No one should immediately disregard the statements of one based on own experience. 
---
I am level 170 , and have been playing since launch, every day from the time I get off work until I go to bed( 5-10pm) . I cannot clearly count how many time I've been harassed and forced into pvp against my will. I tried posting about it before but just like this player , was immediately told I was full of shit. This guy has a real issue that bgs will never look into because of the volume of replies claiming it's not an issue. 
---
You can drive through the same part of town a hundred times and never get carjacked , but someone else might come through for the first time and it will be there last day alive. You can't know the experience of all others.
---
Great! I'll add ya in a minute. My name is the same as it is here. :)
---
Still, that's a heavily legendarized weapon...
---
The enclaves officer hat and outfit work.
---
I have a bloodied pump that does 600 damage still, not noticing any damage bug with it or any of my other high dmg bloodied weapons, such as my powerfist that reads up to 2k dmg.
---
Maybe you‚Äôre just not hitting them as much as you think, or, more than likely, it‚Äôs just server/client lag.
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs a little awkward- someone posted the YouTube video on here yesterday. 
---
umm i know this is asking a lot but could you break down the perks for me i know that str could swap in both one hand and two hand weapons and perception is probably commando and rifleman but I6 and L11 i am not sure what to put in those.
---
but wow, lurking that bad, how does it feel to get that mad over a post?
---
It worked w/o password like 5-10 times before, and I'm not sure the password will be on Annie - there's no hint mark and it could simple not be spawned.
---
Ha, I knew it was campfires.  When I used this trick to place a water purifier, it didn't drop on top of the campfire, it ended up being placed on the roof.  I figured there would be ways to manipulate this.
---
&gt;I want this to feel like an actual fallout game, like it‚Äôs an actual apocalyptic wasteland
---
Close your eyes and listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cLRP-QQxn4&amp;t=986s).
---
For me that has always been the essence of how a fallout game has to feel. 100% Solitude and hopelessness.
---
Fallout 76 comes closer to this than any other recent fallout game IMHO. (besides the weird contrast you need a mod to fix)
---
I have around 10
---
Thanks, I have those. I leveled up in a three piece suit, that didn't work. I'll try it.
---
I smell a feature request. Come on bethesda we need working beer hats!
---
I think vats builds by a long shot. 
---
I‚Äôm a manual scope sniper but when I sold off my vats heavy 3* legendary lever rifle to someone they were able to crit shot kill a level 80 scorchbeast in one hit. 
---
There‚Äôs no way I could do that currently with any of my weapons. Not even pre patch The Dragon I have which did 1700 dmg. 
---
Hmm...will try this on my new alt and report back.
---
IIRC they do.
---
There are 5 that regularly spawn in Watoga, one at big bend tunnel east, one at the monorail elevator, one outside lucky hole mine, etc.
---
That should get you started.
---
Can I change this post to reflect that where the bosses can see it haha
---
This was in the early days of GTA. HE also claimed (though never found out if it was true but at the time I took his word for it and it pissed me off) that if the person who destroyed your vehicle didn't have insurance you got to pay for it.
---
Last I checked though you still pay for insurance for destroying some one's vehicles (last year though). But I pay on PS4 so don't know if PCs got special rules.
---
You can buy and find mods you attach that require no scrap to attach.
---
Straight Jackets. 
---
They are worth over 40 apiece with hard bargain and grape mentats.
---
This! Introduced in patch 5 and definitely one of the wackiest when you consider it can effect almost anything.
---
I've been "Bill Boobies" in FO4 and FO76 for years exclusively because being referred to as "MISTAAAH BOOOBIES" delights me so.
---
Thanks so much! And no problem at all. Anyone else in this thread who has enemies healing immediately after being hit please also slip into my DMs with that info for us!
---
&gt; My level 70-something character gets murdered at least once a day.
---
In order for you to be killed you've "solicited" PvP in some way. You shot someone, hit someone's camp or claimed an owned workshop. Educate yourself how PvP works before you complain.
---
Stop doing any of that and no one can kill you. Slap damage can be out-healed with a bottle of water.
---
I really like this answer. It doesn‚Äôt change my want of money filled fountains though.
---
Yup ik all about that dupe glich it fucks the servers all up
---
Can we expect a part 2 on "How to kill and grief"?
---
PVP is broken in this game as a lvl 134 I've encountered lower lvl players that have been able to kill me and I can barely touch them, even before they nerfed the tse weapons. I've only ran into the asshole players a handful of times, most other peeps I run into are the pve style player. All I can say is hang in there and if you need to server hop to her away for these kind of players or report them if they need to be reported. March is when the survival mode comes into beta so maybe some of these grievers will leave then
---
I stocked up on them when the fusion core generators were producing 8 an hour about a month ago. But they took it away with the recent patch. 
---
I would set up a fusion generator at each power plant if the main power was not already turned on and just play as normal. I would periodically go back to each and collect.
---
Did I say I attack them or did you just jump to a conclusion based on a false premise?
---
Selling to other players is the best and most unreliable way.
---
Sorry to say I don‚Äôt know of any other method besides daily vendor runs... wish there were more
---
If anyone comes across the master list please let me know! 
---
The conflict is you have the ability to make new ones with nuked flora. So building a device that could regenerate them would seem to undermine that. Maybe a compromise, that you can recharge them to 50-75% instead of getting a 100% one? 
---
I dunno. But it would seem on the surface that a camp plan for a recharging unit shouldn't be insurmountable and it would be a nice value add to the game. 
---
Ok that‚Äôs weird. I have a combat shotgun that does more than that and it‚Äôs not even explosive, and my perks aren‚Äôt even good. 
---
You might be experiencing a damage bug that seems to be going around where your damage either gets really high or really low for no apparent reason. 
---
I wish I had something that did 450 damage.  I had a black powder rifle once that did almost 300, but I just couldn't handle the reload times, even with speed demon.
---
It's all in the anti armor effect.  It only has a few points more damage then the regular lever action.  The nerf was definitely needed. Befor the nerf people could snipe with a tse pump shotgun.  How does that make any since? Lol I just have alot of stealth and crit damage and armor penetration so that's why I can one shot most people unless they are running really high DR
---
Whitesprings will always be laggy. Too big of a place with too many entities at any given time.
---
Not if gained from scrapping. That‚Äôs exactly the problem we are discussing. Unless it‚Äôs a glitch which wouldn‚Äôt surprise me
---
Has anyone else had the problem recently where Marsupial will just stop working from time to time and you have to server hop to get it back?
---
I feel like it should be sad how much it makes me- at almost 28 years old- giggle at that. But.... it's just so damn funny to hear his voice say it ahaha
---
Did.... you read the post at all?
---
have it equipped all of the time
---
Lmao love that last bit.
---
This reminds me of... well, one of my own [Fallout 4 builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKyrWNO2TKA)
---
I have only been killed by another player once. I got a 5 cap bounty for lock picking and looting someone‚Äôs supply drop. I have never had a camp destroyed. I had a player try to one shot me back before the TSE nerf. I was level 20 at the time. Fortunately I have the legendary running perk and he was a crappy shot. Playing a Sneak Sniper keeps me off the radar. 
---
I will play on the PVP server when they have it. I expect it to be very low pop and it sounds more entertaining.
---
The beta? Dude launching nukes is the end game, most players didnt even know where to find a hazmat suit or have power armor
---
Yup. I dump stuff in them all the time.
---
Especially Flatwoods for lower levels (as opposed to Overseer's Camp because of the container's limit) as well as suitcases in train stations.
---
So i should use non-legendary after 400hours? Lol
---
Fantastic !! 
---
What‚Äôs your dmg output like? 
---
Also, would tenderizer help or is that gun specific? 
---
Wait.....The block thing. Can anyone else verify this? 
---
You shouldn't have to find these specific weapons/playstyles to be effective. It's an RPG different playstyles should work, to varying degrees sure, but not the ridiculous range with which they are in this game. 
---
No, It will not be.  Because if every update is not 100% exactly what some players have dreamed up in their head, then it is Bethesda failing to listen to the player base 
---
I bought it electronically so I could play the beta... and now I can‚Äôt even trade it in for the $10 GameStop would give me. Solid business strategy.
---
Did you read my post? 
---
And what about the players who DON'T want those things?  You know, they players who actually enjoy the game without having to post to these boards. 
---
Xbox?
---
This game has no idea what it wants to be and is best skipped entirely imo 
---
FYCC
---
That's actually a useful tip - i've had mutants, mirelurks, and mole rats spawn inside my locked generator hut with the trick to make the cables go through the wall.
---
Maybe if i leave the door open and put a basic concrete block in the way it will offer total protection.
---
It was about Patch 3 or 4 when I noticed it myself. It is there, but no quest marker. In my experience anyway.
---
Picked up some marine helmet plan there today. Don‚Äôt forget to wait a good 24 hours between visits, for the big server reset.
---
When did that happen?  I don't remember seeing anything in patch notes about it
---
I can verify on the Xbox platform.
---
I don't know what to say. that's just wrong. everything in this game revolves around grinding. experience, equipment, junk. and Bethesda keeps nerfing popular spots, essentially admitting that "yeah, that's all there is to do here"
---
and god forbid you want a godly roll to speed up the process, because legendaries are pretty much a necessity in this game. you might as well spend well over 2000 hours farming for a decent one.
---
Cant drop it? Like literally cant drop or it doesnt feel right? Inert flux is useless just so you know
---
They only work when you have a prime receiver 
---
Yes it happens to me since the last patch, very annoying.
---
"everyone"?
---
My Strength is at 3. I have no problem managing my carry weight with armor mods and some common sense looting. 
---
90% or more legendaries suck and there is no point in keeping them. If they don't have one/two of the better affixes definitely don't keep them either. 
---
id rather be wasteful. the world has already died, what is a few random depleted fusion cores gonna do if i throw them in the ground, in the water. or into a fissure site?
---
Corn soup recipe I'm guessing your talking about? Still need boiled water for it. 
---
I was under the impression you couldn't  learn BOS from scrapping? The mod learn sheet I have only shows 3 materials available from scrapping.
---
Hold up, this hit me different. Are you being sincere or are you trying to make some joke?
---
yes
---
You can build a firey stairway by stacking them and it looks pretty cool when you put a bunch of power connectors on top.
---
Yeah but the type of lag has never happened to me. I get if the monsters are laggy but this time it affected my controls, audio, and movement. 
---
Nothing comparatively, but you will only need to find 40% as many fusion cores. The earth loves you anyway. Oh wait, that's strangler vines. Good luck!
---
Fuck yes my boy. STALKER style.
---
Well at least I won‚Äôt have to worry about food 
---
Well, my Cultists blade also has 40% swing speed plus all related perks. Tested this last night with a friend, me the cultists dagger, him a 3 star super sledge with 40% swing speed. I was getting 3 swings for every one of his. No matter what "raw damage" you have, it's not 3 times greater than what i have.
---
Can you one hit a lvl 91 glowing deathclaw without the aid of sneak perks, let him see you, aggro you, attack you and THEN hit him, will he die in one hit? I'm thinking no. Last night I tried it with my cultists blade, he aggroed, he hit, i started swinging. Three hits and he was dead. Plus I regained the health he had taken with his hit, double bonus.
---
My blade kills everything in front of it and heals me in the process and it does it FAST. I have so far only come across one enemy who can hurt me faster than i can heal from the vampire effect. Lvl 52 Colonel Gutsy and it takes at least 3. When three or more are firing on me at once, i can't keep up with the heal and I'll get low on health, but as they drop i catch up again. 
---
Each to their own, but the point I was making is that there are end-game 1 handed weapons. You couldn't pay me to go to a 2 handed weapon because there is no way it will kill as fast and efficiently as my cultists blade.
---
Marathoner 3.
---
Just tested without it, and it dropped less than 1%.
---
To be sure if the other bug were still happening, I ran both again without perks and the result was the same. 
---
you can do what ever you want in this video game you can place your camp where every you want to depending on in game rules. also dont lock every thing thats a stupid idea. all of these suggestions are highliy limiting
---
If you move your C.A.M.P everything will be repaired for free. If you have any online friends ask one of them if they have a alt who hasn't got a camp placed (or if you can pay them ‚í∏s to move it) and get them to place it where your C.A.M.P would be, then you join their server, get the "C.A.M.P cannot be placed" message and move it for free somewhere. 
---
I understand you may be like me and have it fitted in a set way, so this may not be an option. Just trying to give you help any way I can :) 
---
Obviously you‚Äôve never tried it. The level of amusement when I call artillery in the middle of your living room is without compare, and it‚Äôs own reward. Some people just want to watch the world burn. üî•üñ§
---
Fuck.....
---
Lol, I see a bunch of posts like this all the time. I wanna know the opposite. I would like to know people's master killing and griefing methods. 
---
I haven't been playing since the last update for this reason. No idea since the hotfix, however, a friend had been playing whever he can and disconnects/bluescreens/pipboy bug at least 3 times an hour. I'm hoping the next update comes soon.
---
Also check out the train yards and robco for sentry bots that always drop a fusion core
---
Off topic how do you add the faction tags people have by there reddit names?
---
sure i'll record myself rebuilding the inside and send it to you
---
Yep. Said that first. They work good if of you do üëç I do it for my friends too üòâ
---
Yes, I can't log in. "server connecting error" or something like that.
---
That actually sound rather brilliant. I'll have to try doing that.
---
Well this could be my main problem then. I have terrible weapons with shitty legendary perks on them. So I constantly have to use stimpacks.
---
What mechanism do you use to find buyers for the things that you want to sell? And, if you don't mind my asking, which platform are you on?
---
Sneak/vats crit. Its worth it to me as its the quick and easy way to get prime plans solo.
---
Sometimes locking everything in your camp will piss people off.
---
Especially if they can't use crafting benches or the stash box because you've put them inside with a locked door.
---
 Sometimes when I've found a persons camp when I desperately need to unload some items or fix something but can't because it's bloody locked behind a door it annoys the hell out a me lol
---
At my camp I have no locked doors so others who stumble upon it can use the facilities or have a rest. I have 4 large purifiers with 3 that are locked but one so anyone who needs water can get some, I also have an outside cooking and unlocked tap 
---
Yea thats what I keep getting took about 7 trys to get in
---
But current engine works just so. I‚Äôm not a data engineer and I don‚Äôt see how to do it in other way. What is alternative?
---
Thanks a lot, but is it really true, that all purifiers take the same amount of build budget away? Its so hard to measure it.
---
The defensive walls... 1,5. Incredible, I removed my perimeter walls, its really true, they waste an incredible amount. I think its because of those useless metal rings.
---
Then your not really recycling them...
---
I swear the chances that Bethesda has employees replying to some of these posts is getting more and more suspect. 
---
Yep. The mini-game within Fallout 76 is all about inventory/weight management.
---
I have never understood the anger at the White Knight nerf.  I have WK at lvl 3.  And it sits unused until I need to repair.  At lvl 3, it costs me 2 Balistic Fiber instead of one now.  Big whoop.
---
I also only ever have to repair my armor every 5 days or so (roughly 15 hours of game play). I think WK is now balanced just fine.
---
Farm legendaries and weapons from mobs, travel to the different vendors and spam sales. I'm a pretty terrible player and even I get 600+ a day, even when I was playing recently. Grab the sales perk card and the cheap travel card and the grape mentats. 
---
It's definitely a situational thing. I've experienced it from the very beginning in some but not all WS runs and SBQ fights. And sometimes it's only a 10 second wait, while other times the loot is still loading even after everything has turned into piles of meat. It hasn't seemed better or worse for me since the last patches though.
---
It was in December I believe, and definitely in the patch notes.
---
All mutations besides empath with strange in numbers + class freak
---
And now the game crashes totally after one try.
---
I use 3 water purifiers at camp + perks. I can usually collect 15 water twice per gaming session. I end up selling 20 or so every other day.
---
I snipe manually because it‚Äôs more fun for me, I don‚Äôt care how much harder a VATS build may hit, cause it won‚Äôt feel as good as when you hammer a sprinting Ghoul from 60 yards the old fashioned way. 
---
The game was made to be a survival game. In all honesty, it would be stupid of them to change anything about that aspect. Yeah, it sucks to have to carry around a bunch of food to guzzle down, but that‚Äôs what you do when you‚Äôre surviving.
---
Not if Vendors have Zero caps. Everyone I go to a vendor, I'm lucky if they have more than 50
---
Oh man so spot on. They all have that very Fallout feel.
---
Wish that added all these songs as holotape collectionables.  Then make a radio channel that will play all the songs in your collection.
---
I would spend hrs hunting these all down.
---
What level are you ? 
---
Username checks out
---
It's a bug. Not sure what causes it seeing as I've had it happen while crafting at my camp. For some reason the game thinks you went through an enclave event and left. This happens with other events as well.
---
125
---
Everyone, stop what you're doing. Fun's over! Stop up cycling your fusion cores! I used the wrong word in an attempt to be clever. I'll issue a formal appology and tender my resignation in the morning.
---
if you are going for ALL weapons you will be a bit short handed when it comes to melee options, and heavy guns, since each of those use up STR. Agility is useful for pistols and Perception is useful for rifles. Bloody mess is always good, a flat +15% for all damage options
---
do iron fist 3 and switch with 3 level 1 cards of the other type
---
All of my known plans/recipes and unneeded ammo gets put into the blue suitcase at the Charleston Train Station.  A lot of low-level traffic through there, so hopefully it will help them out
---
Did he ever show you?
---
I'm dying to see how bad a shot this person is. 
---
Imo they should work like stimpacks. Ie repair slowly over a given time. 
---
Please do.  Maybe if multiple people confirm it then I will stop being downvoted for stating facts lol.
---
I was fine for a week until yesterday and today 
---
Is that why I can't login? Even on both of my accounts? Lol.
---
Mildly amusing but players who don't role play, group up, even attempt 25p selfies, and are in general opposed to organizing creep me out. Of course randoms aren't fun - that's why reddit is our MMO hub.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt have anything outside, but I am in the middle of nowhere, so I don‚Äôt get much traffic other than my friends there. I‚Äôve had a fair share of griefers, but if they can get inside the house, they just toss nades and shoot fat mans for the most damage they can get.
---
Ok thanks I didn‚Äôt know this
---
extremely laggy.. especially last night. Thank god they have strategically placed cars, jumped on top before getting swamped by 20 ghouls and lag
---
Thanks!  Wasn't doubting you...just wanted to go back, check notes, and see what else I might have missed.  LOL
---
Would I like 1000 of course. 
---
I make do. Have I crossed from far west to far east overcumbered ? Lots of times. Is it annoying. Definitely. All I did was post a post. Hate me 
---
I play on ps4 as well and it was with one of the updates. It takes forever for my camp to load and I usually die waiting cuz I can't see what is killing me and can't attack, I can run but that's it. The mobs usually destroy something in my camp as well. I've gotten to the point I just run until it loads. As far as the disconnects it could be your internet connection. Is your ps4 hardwired or on wifi? I have mine hardwired in and I have very few disconnects. I was playing for about 6 hrs last night and didn't have a single disconnect, I know there are times that the servers are the problem 
---
I believe you get the most for nuking the pumpkin house and getting it from corn
---
Sorry Xbox 
---
I make 12-18 corn/carrot soups on log in, and that lasts me through several hours of play.
---
Are you using a lot of chems? They all affect your hunger/thirst.
---
have green thumb per equipped..go outside of watoga train stations towards the fields..its nothing but diseased cranberries (dont worry not harmful) and brain fungus..theres glowing fungus there too..spend about 15 minutes picking all of them...watch out cuz theres scorbeasts around..head back to vault 76 for free and gather all the wood..go to overseer camp..get the water..make a bunch of boiled waters..then craft the cranberry juice and the brain fungus and glowing soup..i make so many it lasts maybe 3 days..soup is good because it quenches hunger and thirst..i also have the perk which food takes a long time to spoil like 90%
---
That gave me an idea for a QoL change: make the piles of meat from scorchbeasts larger. I'd be happy if they just retextured the pile of scorchbeast crap and used that (though maybe shrink it down a little).
---
I literally sold an AA-E shotgun for caps few days ago.
---
Oh really? Lol sure, I‚Äôve done shit like that a lot. A lot of this post is counters to my own play style.
---
i do similar (slightly less) damage, with a power fist. how did you get your deathclaw gauntlet? ive been looking everywhere but i just cant find one or its plans.
---
Yes I‚Äôve also been saving shaped charges and a few other things that are pointless as far as I can tell. 
---
Still no response to my last request... I mean, it's just the main quest line. I've given up on my older ticket to help sort out the Order of Mysteries questline that broke on my original character, that I started this character to finish...
---
I still love the game and the story, but I've stopped playing out of frustration. My wife, brother, and I have been doing these quests together and I can't continue.
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
No, grinding is hard so you're supposed to team up and share.
---
We're supposed to make our own end game because it's the most complex MMO out there. You can play it like Dead By Daylight or Dark Souls or have a 25p role playing troupe. Stop being so literal to your basic programming.
---
How would I do this on an Xbox. I only have one console. 
---
Wow...   
---
That is excessive.
---
Yep, I have a gun slinger and continue to await their addition to the game as well.  In the mean time, ..  10mm and .44 it is, sadly.  I would love to use a pipe revolver...
---
Sure... and when can we all expect our checks in the mail for the play testing we‚Äôre doing for you?
---
It just doesn‚Äôt feel right but I did it. Only the inert flux tho. 
---
Sell stuff, farm up Chems or high value bulk, ignore the game for a day, repeat the process.
---
Its all good. I understand the miss information around here.   I hate it to.   My own fault for not recording it, i have the tools to do it.  
---
He spawns as an event at charleston station, travel there walk out of the area and back in to start the event and he occasionally spawns, and you can server hop to try again if he doesnt. Bonus is that sometimes you can get the vendor responder bot to spawn so you can get some goodies.
---
Thanks for the tag and your reports, I'll get this one documented on our side.
---
I‚Äôll just remove this and work on that post then.
---
Yeah I think it's my stimpack usage then. I have terrible legendary weapons that do barely any damage even at lvl 98, so I'm healing constantly to
---
Deacon!!!
---
\*swoons and fans herself\*
---
This. You can easily pick up 50+ steel in coat hangers in WS.
---
I agree.
---
At the very least, two shot should be more than 25%, I would say that 75-80% is a more appropriate level.
---
Reddit works perfectly for me as a hub. I'd prefer they give us actual content. This is why the toxic "PC master race" meme exists - console "plebs" are too filthy to even get on a forum trapped with whatever randoms they come across.
---
I have the healing one..
---
the just need to buff 2 shot back to where it was before it was nerfed becauce it no longer feels like a 2 shot it feels like 25 percent increase in damage not an actual 2 shot
---
What
---
 I was thinking it was a bug, but I was also afraid I missed something cool. haha
---
I'm sorry let me explain a bit better lol
---
I'm trying to use the keypad pylon object to control my door to keep out unwanted visitors, but the pylon also has a switch that defeats the purpose of the keypad. 
---
I'm just trying to figure out if there is a way to avoid that or properly run wires to prevent the switch's functionality? 
---
I‚Äôm going to have to call shenanigans on that one
---
I should really focus on my main and start doing those.
---
Idk if it has anything to do with it but PSN is undergoing maintenance right now
---
I'm just saying, I like killing people in this game. I'm curious as to how others go about it ha.
---
Because its nerfed into pointlessness.
---
Yes, it's my prime and hardened lever action rifle and handmade.
---
All of them.
---
Modus is already creepy, so to have him randomly talk to you cranks it up. Haha. Hopefully they patch it but there are certainly more important things to fix.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Such a cheap tactic, to call someone a shill just because you disagree with them/suck at the game.
---
Look at the pathetic state of this subreddit, its litterally 90% posts of people saying: "BGS do this or do that because the game is too hard boohoo".  Brainless sacks of dirt lmao.
---
Take a look
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions\_underarmor\_and\_linings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/)
---
Yes you already can it‚Äôs called shielded lining
---
But then you graze someone's pinky toe and they keel over.
---
Check out my post history on reddit for an idea of the sort of stuff people buy. I‚Äôm on PS4 by the way :)
---
There‚Äôs no shortage of crap to find and scrap in game. And there‚Äôs even less shortage of rich players who are too lazy to find their own junk.
---
I haven't really been killed by any grievers yet, fortunately. Any times that people have tried they barely have done any damage to me with the slap penalty. Maybe I've been lucky enough that those few people weren't stacking abused / exploited features like pre-nerf TSE and multiple bobbleheads.  
---
What annoys me is when people randomly decide to mow down my camp. Some dude once mowed down my camp for no reason when I was gone. A second time someone tried to but I disconnected because I didn't want to have to spend the resources to repair it, especially more expensive equipment like mu decom shower. Unlike normal PvP there doesn't seem to be any damage penalty for attacking someone's camp unprovoked.
---
I would be okay if after the new game mode is made if adventure mode was made either pure PvE or PvP is disabled unless an official opt-in between players is made, and that included camps. If I am with pacifist mode on, which is almost all the time, and someone attacking my camp all I can do is watch it be destoryed or disconnect, unless if I go through the trouble to disable  pacifist  mode and fight back, but by then the damage is done.
---
Fortunately people attacking me or my camp unprovoked isn't that common, and I am at level \~130. I would probably be more upset if it happened as much to me as it you say it does to you. 
---
Was there anything built in the shop that the low level would care?
---
Yea the junk decorating would be nice. The budget does goes up ever so slightly with levels but I mean SLIGHTLY. I actually kind of appreciate the budget part. It stops huge cities which would bog down the servers plus it helps keep the idea of a mobile camp alive. I know camps are somewhat static but the server still has to render them and keep track of if anyone is destroying it etc. The not being able to move thing... I normally load and wait until the base pops in before I try to move, fast travel, look at pipboy, anything. Found if I dont wait I have more issues. 
---
That's because more and more people are hitting the burnout threshold
---
The bumper actually has messed me up a couple times (the other day even) when I select a card for a different special and then cant use it because I put the point into a different attribute. Thats definitely something to be aware of as a new player. 
---
Keep in mind that Unarmed (at least in the Deathclaw Gauntlet sense) isn't available on Power Armor.
---
When I started, I was convinced I was going to do 2-handed.  But I found a 3\* Combat Knife that I really enjoyed, and everything started going in that direction, as well as Unarmed.  The way I see it, especially since higher-level enemies are prone to blocking, being able to hit them with a flurry of little jabs can sometimes be more useful than putting all your eggs into one big hit that may-or-may-not be blocked.
---
You can craft them. No need to charge them.
---
Wow. That is absolutely unnecessary. 
---
I just got lucky. I‚Äôm not really sure where I got it but I have looted zealot and troubleshooter ones off gouls. There is a video on YouTube that shows a location that has an unarmed spawn chance. 
---
It‚Äôs called a full set of unyielding gets your around 30 strength plus some if your maxed out in strength as is so i man that with drugs as wel adds more and have a bloodied axe with nerd rage as well and there 2-3k damg eazy
---
I always thought the TSE needed a PvP nerf but not a PvE nerf. I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs possible? 
---
But PvP with un-nerfed TSE‚Äôs were ridiculous. All it was, was a waiting game to see who shot first, if you shot first you were dead. Then after that, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see who can spam the trigger button the most until one of us gets mad and puts pacifist mods on‚Äù 
---
Hell, Doom and Heretic don't even need mods to be enjoyable (also, you can check out the new Dusk, it captures this feel of old school fps)
---
I doubt OP literally *won‚Äôt* go into the woods at night, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some hyperbole at play. 
---
Try taking OP, and maybe yourself, a little less seriously. 
---
Well when I finished the brotherhood of steel questline and got the ultracite power armor set it ended up duping it, the dupes seemed to share whatever mods I put on either one, like if I changed it on the 2nd the first would be different etc. I was able to destroy the dupe set for weight space and it didn't make the other disappear. I don't know how to replicate it though, maybe your duping is what happen with my ultracite set.
---
Na probably not 
---
If they were rare, sure. I mean, they're rare to me, any time I get into PA I'm out of my 8-ish cores before I find 2 more. It sucks that they weigh 3 regardless if it's a 25% or 100%, so it'd make storing them much more efficient, anyway.
---
Huh, I wasn't aware of that - that does seem fair, although I wish it took into account the fact that there's plenty of valid reasons to switch worlds
---
I know it‚Äôs supposed to be a small camp but I just can‚Äôt help making a nice big house ü§ó
---
What actually requires flux to build?
---
You can, but it's not as effective as Ballistic Weave was. üòâ
---
It happens.
---
Happened to me w both the Ultracite and X01. 
---
DO NOT ADD ANY MODS. All 3x it happened to me, once w Ultracite twice w X01 and I picked up another Chassis the new chassis overwrote my duped PA. Of course the PA w the mods is the one that got overwrote.
---
Just flat out drop the duped one. It's not worth keeping it and then losing all your mods. 
---
Not on PC for sure.
---
I can relate.
---
Also Lady Friede is my second favorite Soul boss (right behind Gehrman)
---
Nobody is forcing you to grind the game for a weapon, there is plenty of other side quests/exploring to do. Also it is called a god roll for a reason, if they werent super rare everyone would have them. You dont need some ultimate weapon to just play the game and enjoy it.
---
Yeah. I hate power armor and I find myself using it a lot. Not only because of the bump in carry weight but overall it‚Äôs just safer in basically all scenarios. Only negative is the stealth hit but even then it works half the time if you‚Äôre aware. 
---
I‚Äôd much rather run a nuke zone in a hazmat suit but, like, what‚Äôs the point when it takes off all of your armor? 
---
Sometimes the hardest solution is also the easiest. I recommend just dropping any below 100 or maybe 90. Because of diminishing returns,  a fusion core of 50 or lower will have the same weight as a fusion core of 90 or 100. There's no value in holding onto that weight unless you actively use fusion cores with a weapon and power armor. Or if you only have a few as it is.
---
You're the one with the problem apparently. You don't listen.
---
The fact that your account name replaces character names in the world absolutely destroys the players ability to play different roles in the game.
---
It completely limits a players ability to play a different character interact with other characters in differing manners. From an RP perspective this is one of the worsst design decisions made in the game.
---
How about enemies that eat a few hits before taking damage? A buddy and I have had quite a few of these since the hotfix. 
---
if you plan on using power armor, many people swear by slow swinging melee options (2 handed), if not using power armor get the mutations twisted muscles, talons, and rock a gauntlet/unarmed melee weapon. i personally like the Mole Miner's gauntlet when it comes to unarmed melee.. sadly it weighs 15 pounds.
---
Does the gamma wave emitter add a noticeable boost to the damage? I had one of these but it didn‚Äôt change the stats at all I don‚Äôt think. Seemed like a natural combo but wasn‚Äôt sure how it would play out in game. Can you tell the difference when using it with or without it?
---

EDIT: Also the Perk "Comes with Batteries" is pretty legit. I only have a level 1 and i carry 20ish.
---
Oh yeah, custom radio channels/playlists would be great. Itd be nice to be able to exclude the songs we dont like
---
I only have 1 or 2 lights and zero turrets and I‚Äôm still maxed out. 
---
I hear you there. I dont have a mobile camp on my main. I actually built into an existing structure and made a real "base". I need to post pics sometime. Then again I dont want tons of people taking my spot Haha. 
---
Whenever I get around to actually seriously playing my backup I will have a mobile base though and just move it with me. 
---
Love this!
---
I currently don't.
---
**but**
---
I just hit the mid 50's and have a trip to the mine near Whitesprings planned.
---
Since I'm solo most of my perk cards especially all in strength are weight reductions, if I didn't have to do use weight reductions I could have focused more on damage builds. So, I really depend on the weapons and few damage perk cards like bloody, nerd rage, etc.
---
Nazi? Do you even know what a Nazi is or what the Nazi part was/is? 
---
What I‚Äôm saying is that you are violating Microsoft‚Äôs TOS, which can‚Äôt result in a console ban and legal troubles. 
---
Dismissed
---
the problem was explosive shot and never 2 shot 
---
Dying has consequences.
---
Again nobody cares.
---
I didn‚Äôt, I got along fine with 4 charisma. Get at least 3 so you can share cards, 6 so you can share level 2 cards is recommended. 9 is for sharing level 3 cards but I don‚Äôt recommend 
---
if you wait for the somerset special you can attach the gold paint to it
---
Haven‚Äôt played the game but this worked in fallout 4 dropping items and picking them up Which would reduce the budget for some reason
---
Take good with salt perk, I often log of in the evening and refine it the next day with that perk. 
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm creating another character.
---
Not even close and I‚Äôm only level 10
---
I had my base near the Monorail elevator, directly west of it. There‚Äôs a monorail structure that had a junk pile and you could actually build inside the structure, it was probably my favorite camp location and probably my coolest as well.
---
I‚Äôve played every fallout ever made, including the originals. Can‚Äôt say I recall whether special affected damage in the top-down games, but I don‚Äôt believe the special stats ever affected ranged damage without adding specific perks.
---
There were skills in 3/new vegas that increased specific weapon damage, but they weren‚Äôt tied to special stats ie increasing perception did not increase rifle damage, at least as far as I can recall
---
Xbox or PS4 player?
---
Thanks for the info guys! Much appreciated :)
---
My two cents - I don‚Äôt use Power Armor so I go unarmed for the reduced required perks, faster swing speed, and cause I think the unarmed weapons are awesome looking. 
---
If I used Power Armor I‚Äôd probably go one handed for the faster swing speed...I hate slow swinging weapons...
---
&gt; What are you doing where you dc?
---
I'm trying to play the game... that's what I'm doing... Sorry if you feel my post is negative but it's 100% factual. 
---
This game is not stable, I can't even launch a nuke because the game always disconnects b4 I can clear the silo.
---
Bethesda offers zero help for users in my position (ie. followed all their BS steps to uninstall/reinstall, etc, etc).
---
I've ruled out network issues, which just leaves their servers or faulty game code at work.
---
I have mine at 4... just for bargain hunter and for travel agent 
---
I usually just grab the one at the Harper‚Äôs Ferry vendor and sell it. It‚Äôs nice to have all of the predictable junk that spawns there. 
---
Hahahaha I'm there now!
---
Ohh man i misses that one
---
because I think its ugly and I want a jet pack.
---
they are asking us to report data on a bug that is affecting a huge majority of players, meaning they more than likely have no one internally play testing the updates before release, which is the reason why every up is a broken mess, we ARE the play testers, and more than likely the next update that may fix these issues will probably introduce even more because they have no one internally testing.
---
Your bounty goes up the more stuff you destroy. And if you throw on contractor the base is really cheap to repair.
---
You most likely have been hoarding your items and were full on stash space anyways, so he did you a favor. 
---
Also, having your stuff destroyed every handful of levels is beneficial, you'll get more budget as the items will update to your new level. 
---
That's debatable, I have this one friend with a rifleman build who has gains ammo just by playing. Pretty sure he just uses a base lever action. 
---
Yes we need more Lovecraftian quests again. Dunwich building in fallout 3 was fantastic. The location in 4 was cool but they only took it half way if you ask me. 
---
The cult stuff here is the same. The potential for something really cool and creepy is there. They just need to expand on it.
---
What platform are you on?  I would be willing to take a look and see if got anything worth while.  And buy.
---
played the first one, I might have to check out the beta
---
I have done that event 40+ times trying to get that plan. Does anyone want 35 40mm grenade launcher plans or 5 ivory grip plans?! But seriously I still don't have that plan. Been focused on camp items lately.
---
You're also comparing the grind of 76 to the grind of an actual MMO, which 76 is not. I shouldn't have to grind for hours to make bullets, then blow all those bullets in a half hour farming for better weapons, and end the day with no better weapons and no ammo. This isn't an MMO. It's a fo4 multiplayer mod. The grind for weapons that will be nerfed into the dirt shouldn't be this torturous.
---
I did, but got tired of empath and herd mentality since I run solo. Also lost speed demon but I'll get that back with a serum.
---
Irony...do you speak it?
---
Inaccurate. Not all linings require flux. *generally* only shielded on most under armour requires it. There are some exceptions like the BOS under armour and the vault suit where lower "tier" linings require flux.
---
Also keep in mind not all under armors have the same stats when lined. 
---
I do farm whitespring , and I seem to have horrible drop rates in everything I do on the game.
---
I LOVED that place! I had my bedroom and a bar up there. I‚Äôve been wanting to find something similar, I know there‚Äôs a cave to the west of the map but it‚Äôs pretty small. 
---
Good luck getting traction on this. Looks like you are.
---
I've tried explaining that crafting a fusion core + super duper + ultracite = "recharge" your cores (and duplicate them legitimately in the process). A normal, non-prime Gatling laser will also use the ultracite core. All around getting 210% out of a core (not counting the other 210% from Super Duper) is pretty nice and they work in any version of the laser gatling.
---
The game used to lock up if you manually put an Ultracite core in PA, but PA will happily consume it from inventory. I haven't tried it in a while. Can you put one in PA manually now?
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain that doesn‚Äôt work in 76.
---
Nah, just 76 begging you to experience it's "content" lol.
---
Odd, bulked scrap isn't auto scrapping for me on Xbox one s. Was there another update? 
---
Well I'm like 6 lvls away from 200 and to grind to get all those materials, plans learned, and decent legendaries don't think is worth a new character. I mean you can technically just keeping leveling and getting all the damage perks, like I got all 3 two-handed melee perk cards maxed problem is that is 9 points and out of 15 strength that is a lot of weight reduction cards gone. Be cool if in the future Bethesda adds more max limit to special like 20 points max and 60 points total for special instead of 50. If we could have like a banking system for new characters with old it would be so easy to get rid of weight reduction cards, never will come cause of dupers; Bethesda doesn't want to make their lives easier.
---
I wound up putting 3 points in it after having 1 for a long time.
---
I use it either for Rank 3 Hard Bargain, or pair it with Lone Wanderer + Travel Agent (or, if I'm on a team, Rank 2 Inspirational + Travel Agent).
---
I have 3, just to max Lone Wanderer. As a solo player, the charisma perks just aren't interesting to me. I'd consider bargain hunter if vendors had more caps, but as it is, meh. 
---
I didn't have any trouble a few weeks ago when the idea hit me.
---
Not gonna lie.. whoever dropped all the 10mm in a suitcase along with buncha plans..
---
I love you.. i was outta ammo and stimpacks. Ty &lt;3
---
And also since I‚Äôm new to Reddit and I‚Äôm not sure how to edit posts.
---
‚Ä¢Please. Let. Me. Scrap. Trees. 
---
I've picked stuff up, and left items behind in containers at, specifically train stations. I've probably picked up more than I've dropped off, but I'm only level 22. 
---
Enforcers need a solid Plastic mine.
---
a bit of the luck perk so you can get mutations like talons and twisted muscles without the threat of losing themb
---
I don't feel attacked. I think you're being stupid. That's not the same thing.
---
because without complaints and feedback how will they improve?
---
decontamiation arch
---
If you're a team player and actually get into teams a high charisma is nice I run 15 on my medic to share things like gunsmith if people don't have it. Wish I could share multiple low level cards though like radsponge and goulish at the same time.
---
I made a character the looks like Lemmy Kilmister and named him Lemmy, and no one can see that.
---
Also, my original character I played during beta is goofy looking and is called Rangus Preebus.
---
My understanding is that it works like locks do, where you, as the owner, have unfettered access while anyone else would be forced to enter the code. That said, I haven't really tested it thoroughly.
---
On PS4 2 days ago it scrapped about 200 lots of bulked crap. Haven‚Äôt bothered bulking stuff since, but knowing Bethesda it‚Äôs still broken.
---
I went into whitesprings and it just stopped working 
---
I really enjoy the game, I'm finding the issues that should not be issues are starting to take away from the game. 
---
Don't use x01, it's that easy. T51b and Ultracite have better damage resist. Energy resist is a joke with grounded. And rad resist is irrelevant, either drop the nuke and pull the queen outside the blast radius or get in a team with rad sponge. You're welcome. 
---
Pretty sure there was; at least on PC.
---
Yes my main character is 122 but I have a lot of extra stuff to give them. Where to go, farm, level up etc. 
---
**1st:**  
---
Check the top "bug", it has the details about the FC Drain when "Sniping"  
---
2nd:  
---
So maybe it is a bug...  
---
Because the Fusion core drain should be significantly impacted when "Sprinting" (not running).  
---
Do you use the Pain Train by any chance?
---
For Whitesprings, you also have the ice box outside of the golf club for unwanted legendaries. Some folks also use the trash cans near the resort entrances. Watoga station is a great place to check after an SBQ run. Just give us some time to come back to vendor and to dump. 
---
I prefer using suitcases, registers, and the overseer‚Äôs camp. Some also use the mailboxes around Flatwoods. 
---
I've got my base built above the arch with my garden walled in the arch. All workshop items in the flat in the arch and a fire pit in the circle area. Pretty sweet. You can actually build on top of that arch. Wanna check that out with my other character. 
---
Huh.  Gonna have to start saving my low cores now for the late game.  Thanks!
---
I only use V.A.T.S. to get my critical up in case I need extra power for a 1st sneak attack. And occasionally thinning the heard of a swarm of closing in ghouls. Other than that I manually aim at everything and have no V.A.T.S. based perks. Not even CF.
---
But if you are looking for pure damage output, then probably a V.A.T.S. sniper build. You can't critical outside of V.A.T.S, and things like concentrated fire and gun fu make racking up the damage incredibly easy. 
---
I think this is an issue with Rad Worms, server hopping does fix it.
---
It seems to me it depends on your level and the time you play. If I am on my high-lvl toon I am rarely bothered, but when I am on my low level toon the frequency of unwanted pvp, grieving and general douchebaggery increases.
---
I had my base attacked twice on my alt, was attacked several times and also had a high level attach my house, getting a bounty, I attacked him with my sledgehammer and I hit his friend who was chameleon hiding inside  him, got myself a bounty and was murdered and had my base destroyed. All for a measly cap gain as I had no junk on me and little caps (lvl 15). 
---
Agree to disagree. 
---
This friggin post yes. I didn't think my account name would be the name sitting over head the whole game. Prolly should though about that before making my account ip00ppedmydicoff hahaha.
---
Sounds like you need to find another game to play, or better yet, Go outside. 
---
Either way, there was a civil productive conversation playing out here and you had to inject your toxic two cents where it wasn't needed or asked for. Period. 
---
Maybe you are the exception, I run (ran) a vats/crit agility/luck/perception build and I still needed to put strength to 12 to run the weight reduction perks, the game seemed unplayable to me without them.
---
I suppose it is possible not to use most weight reduction perks but it certainly would make the game a whole lot harder, particularly when you have to loot hundreds of screws and springs just to keep your weapons usable. Not to mention the dozens of other junk items you need to constantly loot to have what you need to build anything
---
Just downhill from the giant teapot is a electrical pylon with a concrete spot you can drop an extractor on. Set up your base on there for a few hours and you rake in the concrete. Then, hit the Gilman lumber mill for tons of wood scrap. 
---
Thanks.  
---
Lol I didnt know that. I was wondering what the patch notes meant when they said something about putting a cap on xp to prevent exploits.
---
Sickle man‚Äôs shack! 
---
Didnt fo4 foundations stack? Or was that a mod?
---
I've seen griefers try to bait players into attacking back, by doing things like meleeing you or pestering you hoping you'll fire back then switch to a more powerful weapon, like an explosive one, and lay on the damage. Some will jump in front of you in the fire fight against NPC enemies so they get the initial slap then they can return the fire at full damage. Pasifist mode if anything can help prevent you from accidentally allowing full PvP damage to be allowed, otherwise most players shooting at you is just a nuisance.   
---
If people abused bobbleheads (they used to stack) and had TSE weapons I can see them still killing others in pasifist relatively quickly, so I don't think it's impossible, but I have never personally encountered people griefing as much as OP says he has. Nerfs to these legendary mods and bobbleheads should help dealing with people who abuse these things though.
---
Most trouble run into are people deciding to bulldoze my camp. If they had TSE and the right perk cards they could do it fairly quickly. Only happened to me twice so far total, so not as often as OP, but still annoying.  
---
I can see the things OP said happening to them, but the rate they mention seems awful high to me. At level 130 or so I've only had a few people try and mess with me. Most players either ignore me or try and be friendly/helpful. Maybe different platforms (I am PC) or regions (NA, wid-west US) play into it, like another user suggested.
---
No thanks. I'll be who I am, you can mind your beeswax sonny Jim. 
---
&gt; everything in this game revolves around grinding.
---
Everything in EVERY game revolves around grinding to some degree.
---
&gt; because legendaries are pretty much a necessity in this game.
---
I've done pretty darn well without many. Sure, it would be nice to have wetter equipment, but they haven't been necessary by any stretch.
---
Can people discussing bugs at least indicate what platform they're on?  
---
I haven't had a single piece of gear disappear on me since a PA bug in B.E.T.A.  
---
\[PS4\] here.
---
If it turns out to be fact, then it's a separate thread, and you'll have my upvote on it.
---
Deep Pocketing is a separate plan for each grade on some Armors, like Combat &amp; Metal, one for light, one for Sturdy, &amp; one for Heavy, Arms, Legs &amp; Chest is also separate for most, but not all.
---
I haven't lost any that I have noticed, and based on vendor inventories, there are very few I don't know, mainly Raider, and a few of the Robot ones, that no body wants anyway.
---
I have a ton of extra plans if you're looking to buy, I sell much lower than the vendors.
---
The only Armor Plan I'm still looking for is BOS Arms Plan, I would offer a very lucrative trade for that one, as it has eluded me for quite some time.
---
That is ludicrous

---
Thanks, it still feels a bit like Screaming into the wind, but I got a phonecall from Bethesda Yesterday (I kind of overwhelmed them with bug reports the other day) so maybe there is hope?  
---
*Clarification*  
---
It was just a discussion on how to optimize the bug report submissions, not a short cut or direct line to get faster resolution.
---
I hope people start taking it up. I've been doing it for a while. I think the first time I mentioned crafting a fusion core here someone raged about it being a waste of flux and a crime against Harold. :P

I miss SWG, once a Wanderhomie, always a Wanderhomie!
---
&gt;Riomaki's statement was accurate. Not sure what you are trying to point out as being inaccurate information.
---
I was mistaken.  Someone said it can be crafted at the chem bench.  Will try it tonight.  Usually I have no for the the chem bench at all. 
---
Wow. It's the best use I've found for any flux so far.
---
Best feeling ever. Got mine abot 320hrs in
---
How much budget do the floor tiles take as opposed to wall tiles? 
---
I love the idea of being able to stack foundations.   Finally I can make mah bunker! 
---
Love the pyramid! 
---
They are greatly nerfed, but still pretty good relative to most mod combinations.
---
I was avoiding them, but I decided that they‚Äôre worth it. I‚Äôm sitting on six serums. I just got Class Freak 2, so I‚Äôll start using mutations and I‚Äôll max out CF soon. 
---
I had that happen, then the drop rate of legendary items was bugged or something cause everything I killed dropped a legendary item
---
1 Whitesprings is one of thee best places to build and the penalty for building too close is having to log off when its nuked or lose the CAMP. No turrets there is a fair request. 
---
2 Building in high traffic areas is the only way some people get to run into other to trade with right now. People destroying CAMPs is a non issue. It rarely happens. 
---
3 Never lock your doors. There's no point. No one is taking anything from you by using your stove. 
---
4 Again. No reason to stop people from getting in your base. You lose nothing and help people out. 
---
5 Make a panic room with no windows and change the door to a wall. Most people wont make themselves wanted over your 5 caps. Beware Wanted players with high cap rewards. Avoid them. 
---
6 Totally the opposite. Group up. The assholes don't like to be observed by a crowd. That being said, if you're low level and doing the queen or have turrets behind the golfclub, you earned it. 
---
7 Melee can also make you a sitting duck for ranged attackers. Carry a gun too. 
---
8  If you take a workshop, 9 times outta 10 you are gonna get disconnected after you defend it once. Avoid battling for them. You get more resources running through an old low level area. 
---
9  If you don't want to fight, log and block em because .. 
---
10 ..this is totally BS. Tested my ass. I block people that build CAMPs that prevent mine from spawning and after blocking I don't see them again or at least very rarely will I see that blocked player.
---
11 So lock CAMP doors letting no one use workstations and wait for attackers to walk away so you can shoot em in the back but don't use emotes cause it may trigger someone?  Sounds like you play like an asshole and get triggered by emotes. 
---
12 If you find yourself in a fight you don't want to be in, log off and block 'em. It's a game and not worth the aggravation. 
---
You are playing it like an MMO but say it isn't an MMO. Maybe this game isn't for you?
---
Besides, tip tier stuff shouldn't be easily achievable as it is. That in itself would be poor design.
---
i have had conversations on here where people freely admit they have never played it. go through my comment history, you'll find some. 
---
And there are plenty of posts made by people that have CLEARLY never played it by the claims they made. 
---
I never suggested that all negative posts are made by people who have never played it. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you're looking for opinions that are actually educated opinions, you might want to look somewhere other than here. 
---
And FYI, i don't give a shit if you have a problem with me, internet stranger. 
---
Patch 5 introduced the can't craft with bulked bug. Then they released a hotfix (on PC at least) and the hotfix introduced the bug where bulked items are scrapped when you select scrap all junk.
---
No problem. Seems to be a bit of misinformation, or maybe misunderstanding around here regarding crafting these, lol. 
---
Yall need to relax? It's barely any hp. You won't notice if you have it or not. 
---
You're the kind of person that would tell a person to Google an Answer. Which is the kind of person that DOES not actually know what they are talking about. Why don't you just provide the answer for us? Since you so kindly know how to "load up xEdit". 
---
Everything was liberators. Fuckin commies!
---
Maybe a lever action is different, and the same difference might go to other slow firing guns. But a handmade or a combat rifle means making your rounds regularly. Especially if you're doing a lot of monster killing or ghouls rather than scorched or super mutants. I guess it's situational, maybe sometimes it's the case, other times not. 
---
I doubt many here know what a pyramid scheme is.
---
So you remember the three legendary effects? I'd like to know how he could output more than 1700 dmg
---
I am. I would be very grateful for that! What‚Äôs your username?
---
After you build your Power Armor mods (completely optional) the only useful thing to do with flux is fusion cores or serums..... and an ultracite fusion core is hands-down the cheapest ammo to craft plus the utility.
---
I have a running balance of 50 (yes 50) of screws and springs and any other mats to "keep my weapons usable". I carry 3 rifles at all times. I use Gunsmith x3, and I repair every other day. 
---
This game is not even close to being difficult. We just have to use the tools that are given us, and be creative.
---
I'm not trying to be an ass about this, but seriously... I am definitely NOT the exception. 
---
Yeah I'm thinking that's along the lines of whats happening with me but so far I havn't been able to replicate it using  any power armor mods or armor upgrades just the cores.  Good to know I'm not totally crazy.
---
Really? that explains why you have to respond with childish insults in both cases. Which just shows who's stupid. You. The best you could come up with is insults. Which is always the way stupid people respond. 
---
Is this a pc thing?  I only had issue in the sub 20 range on ps4.
---
I wouldn't worry about level as much as I would about their effects. Before the TSE patch my furious explosive .50 cal melted mobs and it was level 35. I personally collect two-shot legendaries as long as they don't weigh over 15lbs (made an exception for my handmade) even though now it's near useless, but keep 2 or 3\* weapons with good effects and sell or donate the rest.
---
Thank you for the tag! I am sorry I missed this originally. I've contacted our Customer service team with this and they are investigating.
---
I don't blame ya I thought it was absurd as well until it happened a few more times.
---
Not really in my opinion. Unless there are a lot of people to share the load it's not worth the loot. 
---
Yep this happened to me once as well. Non nuked.
---
Mutations + class freak  = awesome and for a bonus be in a group with others who have mutations and use strange in numbers for even more fun
---
Please tell them to leave it as it is, any change they make will just cause mass outrage for no obvious reasons.
---
1. fix bugs.
---
2. very slow, tiny, excruciatingly though out balance changes
---
3. more content.
---
Not sure about order of 2 &amp; 3.
---
Sure, i never said there are none, but you can make games a lot better if you have more low hp high dmg enemies than few high health low dmg enemies, fights are over quicker and more serious that way.
---
Get naked and position your crotch in their face when its their turn.
---
Or stand next to them with the drill or chainsaw running.
---
Awesome collection of tips! Thanks for sharing :)
---
This has happened to me a few times. I just hop to another server.
---
Thanks so much! I wanted to provide an additional update since I can‚Äôt update my post title. 
---
I tried it additional times without the Bloody perk and noticed that it frequently occurred when killing multiple creatures consecutively within a 30 second time period. This includes utilizing melee weapons, shotguns and explosive weapons. This proved that my theory of the perk is false, but I did find additional info from testing: 
---
From each trial of 8-10 consecutive kills, I noticed that whenever the meat bag would trigger and the bodies would disappear in favor of the meat bag, that some of the bodies would just disappear. 
---
I tested this further and found that the disappearing body would occur ONLY whenever the creature‚Äôs container is still loading (spinning circle). Body containers w/ fully loaded loot would transfer successfully into a meat pile, but bodies still loading loot would disappear. It also seemed as if the transfer of bodies into meat piles happened within batches, almost at the same time. I was able to recreate this 10 times within the same server at Whitesprings golf course. 
---
I once had ghouls there that blew up after dying like robots. 
---
I think there have been several threads already but I assume they get lost in all the posts about bugs and such. Heres a link to one, guy did videos for proof.

---
Yeah, if someone griefs my base I assume they're a duper since they clearly don't appreciate how grindy this game can be when played legit ... and then report them to bethesda as instructed.
---
Yeah, I've just never need to craft very many mods. Until last patch the only good mod I could craft was t51 jetpack in spite of looking for them religiously.
---
Thank you. And no worries on having missed it. Ideally the Customer Service team would have dealt with it and investigated properly from the start. 
---
Working for a very large service providing organization myself, I know how hard it can be to engage and communicate between divisions. So I appreciate what you Community Managers do here, even when it doesn't directly affect me.
---
Ditto....  
---
And one of them used and then bragged about an PvP Exploit that I was unaware of, making my day as it rarely gets better than that for a report!
---
Huh. I will have to test that for myself tonight 
---
&gt; But I like to save my canned dog food for emergencies. 
---
Do "emergencies" mean selling them to vendors because you've been using all the other consumables you have instead and you're approaching 200 of them?
---
I'm not really in favor of instant full respecs. While you are pushing to 50 and trying to finish your build, or working towards respeccing, leveling up matters. Once you get your build perfect, you've got nothing to work towards. No point in leveling. No point in experience.
---
NICE job dude!   I too spent a good chunk of my night working on a solid foundation build.
---
So far have literally just made something like a 6 wide x 5 length x 4 high BOX around a junk contractor and water purifiers out by Fissure Prime.  The roof is entirely foundations.  Cant wait for someone to nuke the queen, my camp will likely be in the nuke radius.

Also, moved my 'Camp' piece around until I found the sweet spot of my fast travel point being inside the box.  No way in, no way out aside from fast traveling.
---
Was nothing but Diseased and Legendary LVL 1 Eyebots on Xbox last night for me. Was nice being able to one shot things there for a change, instead of them one shotting me, lol
---
That happens when a team member leaves the group.  I think it's related to sharing strange in numbers.  The fast solution is to kick the person or to leave the group.
---
That‚Äôs just mean! 
---
I will have to test that for myself tonight 
---
This is great until Q*bert comes in and wrecks the place.
---
inert flux is used for free caps at vendors. give them the useless inert flux. they give you caps. it's a sweet deal.
---
Stop lying for attention ' man'....
---
Care to elaborate on exploit possibilities?
---
Egg head gives intelligence right? Would that be useful for people crafting gear. Higher int means better conditions for the stuff you make and I also believe it effects hacking.
---
With some legendary mods it may depend. Before the nerf explosive weapons as low as 35 were still great to keep even in the later game.  
---
For a lot of legendary weapons and armor I would say no however. I usually sell, give away, or drop them where they can be found by other players. If they are super-low level (like 5) I often will give them to new players. It's easier to find legendaries as you get to higher levels and the end game, but much more rare as you just start off - so something like a level 5 legendary weapon is mostly useless to a high-level character, but can be really valuable to someone just starting off.
---
I'm not playing it like an MMO. 76 never felt like an MMO to me, or anyone I played with, because it's not an MMO. I never said it should be easy to get the top tier equipment, but being one of the people who spent hundreds of hours just grinding and have nothing to show for it, I'd say the loot drops need a rework. 200 hours of grinding and the best thing I've got is a tier 2 wooden right leg is not how the game should be.
---
I'm not sure there is a limit of 5 for the head in FO76, but I haven't tried it.
---
Are those still rare, I thought vendors sell all items now. Is that particular vendor still hard to find?
---
Welcome to fallout 76.

‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù

if people nuked whitesprings to include the train station and power plant  - there is at least 20-30 cobalt you can get with green thumb along that area spanning to the Bunker
---
I think it's a bug related to rad worms
---
Unyielding if you're running a low-health build, Cavalier and Sentinel are community monikers for -15% damage while sprinting and standing respectively. 
---
Fair, I mean I know running a commando build I run through ammo like hell. 
---
EVERYTHING was duped. Every weapon, aid, armor, plan, etc.....EVERYTHING. It will not be long until you start seeing the truth, Anti-Armor, Bloodied, Instigating, etc...they all were duped. 
---
Do you want them nerfed too, because they all suck already.
---
And you think people have a full set of 3\* Sentinel/Cavelier armor from world drops. HA! I wish!
---
All the new dupes are just showing up for sale...stay tuned.
---
Just drop some ammo in a paper bag, then loot your own bag, it's more rewarding....and no ammo used....
---
No, you need the perks.  You do not need any materials, but you need the perks.
---
Bethesda did this to mix things up a bit. The protections give better legendaries in my experience. 
---
Sometimes nothing but Lv.1 eyebots spawn and that sucks.
---
I log in lately and have no idea what to do... I do quests because i waited until post 50 for the best drops but they are all terrible.  
---
the quests are often bugged, prohibitively, stupidly far away checkpoints.  Some of the quests i easily spend a hundred caps in just travel.  How are you supposed to do this at lower levels?  Just run dozens of miles for each quest point?  
---
I keep NOT seeing uranium fever or monster mash even after server hopping.. And when you look at the map as a higher level (i'm only even 88!) and there are no events up and you're on your sixth server hop... What do you do?  What's the point?    
---
Whats the point of taking workshops when you end up having to server hop to find any good spawns or events?  I loved this game against all odds but after a forced week off due to a work trip, i have a hard time knowing wtf the point is.
---
The war against anonymity rages on. 
---
If you have tried marsupial and bird bones, and don't absolutely love it, then I would be shocked. Absolute game changer! So much fun!
---
I need 4 cents.
---
If you thought I was being childish in the first comment, you're way too thin-skinned to be posting on Reddit. You were condescending and insulting in your reply to me. "You feel attacked." What? No, not in the least. I think you are wrong and you're deluding yourself into thinking that you and your friends are playing in the only "right way".
---
And "I think you're being stupid" is not a childish insult. Would you have been open to my saying "I don't think you're looking at this intelligently?" No. You'd just get your dander in a huff and throw a differently-phrased temper tantrum. So I was blunt. Blunt is not the same thing as childish.
---
As people noted below, foundations are indestructible, that's pretty much the only issue I can see... so you could (with a lot of work which may not be worth it for a temporary base but never underestimate the time that trolls have on their hands) for example completely make a workshop inaccessible to anyone but you. 
---
That's awesome until the rats spawn UNDER THE FOUNDATIONS and you have to scrap them just to attack the enemies, assuming they aren't literally under the ground.  
---
Talking to you grafton steel workshop last night...
---
Nah they stacked, there were a lot more options available in FO4
---
Thanks for the awesome game Todd, it's "perfect"
---
Once I was just outside Haper's Ferry and got attacked by an invisible Assaultron
---
I could not kill him he moved very fast and was invisible the whole time.
---
No. You're just being an idiot. 
---
Any game developer from single random making stuff on the play store to big devs will have a much easier and quicker time fixing bugs by getting exact details than having a team randomly test hundreds of loadouts to make sure they all work. 
---
It's like when a game won't launch and they ask for system specs. Are they just too lazy to build 1000's of PCs to test configurations?
---
Don't be a twat 
---
I'm on XBox or I'd head on over with some of my Tea (somehow the recipe got out) and some Lure Weed!!! 
---
Honestly, I don't understand these foundations. There is an transparent staircase you/enemies can just walk up without placing a staircase. Don't understand this mechanic.
---
I think its similar, they're all pretty detailed if you look on the back sides with each individual joist modeled. 
---
Rad!
---
Imagine if, after joining the Enclave with all the syncing and uplinking, Modus randomly enters your pipboy and does his creepy smile when you are trying to drop some junk or something.
---
I wouldn't mind some more "experimental" type armors like some nut job in the mountains has been cobbling together armor from the intact pieces of Chiten off of Mirelurk or the bones of Deathclaws. I mean really the sky is the limit for this game because as far as i know in FO lore the events of what happens in WV are all contained in WV and from what I can tell it's considered a dead zone/ never enter for fear of certain death or worse type of area for the rest of the post apocalypse USA
---
I'm on the "gather 99 Ultracite Explosive Vents" challenge.  
---
The benefit it provides is protection from people who decide they just have to shoot at you I was lucky and got a full set of sent/ass gear. I dont enjoy pvp but it helps on the rare times people decide I look like a nice target 
---
‚ÄúNegative‚Äù like in ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not having issues‚Äù, he‚Äôs not attacking your opinion I think.
---
I've had that happen too. A server hop usually fixes it.
---
Same 
---
It's a suppressor Ax with +40% speed and +1 agility. It's my baby
---
increase server player limit, shrink the number of shards so more players compete for the workshops.
---
FIX THE GD SPAWNS!!   - I assume the point is to take your base and hold it against waves of enemies. AWESOME idea.  Reality is they spawn anywhere in a 100 m radius and i spend MOST of my time hunting them down at the spots i know people get stuck.  Dod's, Berkley Springs, Gorge are all particularly bad.  Hey I know let me spend 5 minutes tracking down the level 5 liberator stuck next to a refrigerator behind the house with the power armor rack because your stupid quest system didn't actually give his location, just the fuzzy compass glow... christ so much is so bad with this game..  
---
This was the reason I made my own game, but it bombed so i guess i'm no better.
---
My two more cents - 
---
Orange juice is better **with** pulp. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe in ghosts but they still scare me. 
---
And yet, while the ‚Äúholding content back prior to release‚Äù model isn‚Äôt great, it‚Äôs almost certain that they‚Äôve done the same thing with FO76. Those vaults have had planned releases since before launch. Survival mode didn‚Äôt come out of people whining on reddit. The Christmas atom shop items were talked about far before the holiday season. 
---
Unless BGS is truly falling apart, they‚Äôre not so incompetent as to not have plans for things. OP is showing an example of how one game communicated those plans prior to launch. It‚Äôs not specific but it is a commitment to new content and sets expectations regarding when to expect what.
---
There was none of that from BGS prior to release and we still don‚Äôt have an estimated date for new content outside of survival mode. 
---
To me, that‚Äôs a big difference and the point the OP was trying to make. 
---
Of course I do! With class freak rank 3 the negative effects are laughable. I have 11 mutations at the moment.
---
Yes these are rare, they come from a spot near railroad station, a robot responder spawns and sells them, he doesnt carry all the rare clothing at once. So acquiring them all is tedious
---
Yes orange is way better with pulp!!!! And I have a ghost problem yet I dont believe in ghost. I guess the idea of not being able to kill something that's already dead.
---
Yeah gives us a 20,000 cap recipe to grind for too lol
---
Also how is this reverse psychology?  I didn't remotely say anything about the nerf not being needed.
---
I had that happen hundreds of protectrons on the lower floor. 
---
rofl how did I know you would respond
---
Finished that one ages ago, always a bunch in watoga station.
---
Dang, I was hoping the update would fix that.
---
I'm guessing it checks to see if I have the password note with me.  Completing the quest removes Amy's Note from my inventory, now, though.
---
Nobody knows who you are, or cares.
---
Kind of figured...thanks for the confirmations.
---
Ya but I want the loot from the legendary in these events. 
---
25k and all my belongings...
---
Unless you plan on modding other people's stuff it may be more beneficial to you to use less then half those caps to buy the mats from players. Then just get your set modded up from a PA modder. 
---
nope
---
That's a good question. I may have to find a way to test this out. Also how do you add the raider tag to your name? 
---
I wasn't aware they were making a PvE server...just a PvP server where warning shots don't count.  Did they say they were spinning up servers with absolutely 0 PvP?
---
check all the trash cans in WS while your'e at it. There's often a stimpack or a buffout or a mat or two. 
---
nope . i skip it every time 
---
Besides the fact that you loose caps for that... they loose twice as much?! And the one that collects the bounty only gets half of that?! This game get more and more rediculous. @.@ why did I waste $60 on this crap?
---
Have had 0 disconnects or crashes in the past week on ps4 pro.
---
Yup this is the main problem the only way to hit the thruster solo is to sneak attack it and that does not guarantee you will incapacite/one shot it. I would say Gutsy are designed to taken out by a pair or more of people but this was a problem in FO4 as well. I believe in 3 and NV if you atleast took outt their eyes they couldn't hit worth a damn.
---
i hate nothing more than level 50 SBs.  I can 2 shot or almost 1 shot lvl 68 scorchers but a level 50SB - that's gonna cost you a hundred rounds of 556 or so.  My favorite is when someone trains one back to the watoga vendor.  that's always a blast. literally..
---
Wahhh, your gun isn't over 3x as effective as the next combination of legendary affixes any more.
---
Yeah, it was a great game before they messed it up. I was on Naritus.
---
well that makes holding workshops even dumber
---
Eh i dont mind
---
if they are in group they can
---
&gt; congratulations, good for you, you are lucky.
---
No, the others are just unlucky.  Unsolicited PVP and Griefing are not the norm, regardless of the stories that people post on reddit.  Interactions between players on servers tend to be few and far in between.  Most people just go about their business, maybe do an emote, but just pretend people don't exist.
---
Two shot is still 25% bonus damage... That's more than a three perk card investment and explosive is 20% which is a three perk investment that adds splash damage.
---
They are still God tier, just not ridiculously OP.
---
I have been griefed a couple of times only myself. I cant see it happening daily. Id actually be a lil happy with player interactions like this. Nobody keeps an open mic and play like shut ins. interact people...its a MP game
---
I am still trying to figure out how robots can be diseased lol
---
Also if inventories are static, if someone else goes there first and buys some plans, will those plans not show up for others until it resets 20 hrs later?  Is that how it works?  Or do we all see our own "instance"?  
---
Uranium, Uranium... 
---
&gt; my LMG character
---
fucking masochist
---
hard to believe an LMG character was even possible before the bug
---
You are assuming....
---
A: she actually does
---
B: you can actually loot her
---
The game is barely three months old. You shouldn't be saying "finally". It should be more, "already?!"
---
&gt;Why would a pack of mongrels bite and scratch  an artillery cannon until it is reduced to  a pile of rubble?
---
This is the easiest to explain, that little shield icon with number on all turrets and that barrier is the amount of threat it generates, the higher the number the more threat. E.g. if you have heavy laser turret, a mortar and a generator. Them mongrels will first reduce the laser to rubble before targeting the mortar and generator even if it isn‚Äôt powered up. 
---
&gt; What possible reason is there for a super mutant to stand on the other side of the river, shooting at my generator with a hunting rifle,  steadily chipping away at its heath until it is destroyed?
---
This is more complicated but the short answer is all thing generate threat, in the following order, defensive structures &gt; large generators &gt; small generators &gt; resource collectors (e.g. water purifiers) &gt; other buildings. 
---
I will try that tonight, thanks
---
then you move on to the 99 rusty knuckles plans
---
I've been chased by this one guy. First time he saw me at WS in the workshop area, and I was a level 17 character. He asked me how I was. I said fine. Then he said he was going to kill me. OK, I thought, weeee here we go. 
---
I ran around and just tried to get away from him because he's just punching me, no big deal. I finally get upstairs and crouch in a closet and he agrroes the robots and logs out. I think it's over. NOPE.
---
Next time I play he pops up on the same server apparently and sees me and runs over to my new base and destroys it. And starts hitting me. I have pacifist on, he's going to kill me if I don't stimpack but I use one and now he's mocking me and being a bully and basically just boring as hell. I get a couple of screenshots. He leaves. I think it is over. It's not.
---
I'm on my high level character one day and with my friends. Just hanging. Talking. Here comes this guy and now he's got two friends and they're harassing us. Telling us Bethesda won't do shit, and there's nothing I can do but block them (I do.. BUT I missed blocking one of them. I didn't get his name in time, and now I'm afraid that one guy I didn't block will be on the lookout for me for his buddies ...) so I sort of play now half afraid my friends' camps will get attacked if that dildo and his buddies see me on map. I know he can't see me cuz he's blocked but his one buddy isn't blocked and that group seems hell bent on following me around. It sucks. 
---
Ingenious how you jumped to a conlusion its a directed attack and not a general observation 
---
There are also areas to set up your CAMP where you can get two extractors going, say like one junk and one lead. This way, the junk extractor will be making plastic and cloth for you to make clothes...and plastic to bulk up on the other stuff coming out of both extractors. 
---
No argument here. I prefer games where the enemies are actually fear inspiring. 
---
The other issue however is that death has zero implications in a PVE environment. It actually acts as a heal in this game. If you have more deadly enemies the death penalty is going to need some rework otherwise 
---
Spinning arrows for 10 or more minutes after killing the SBQ has got to be one of the most frustrating aspects of playing this game right now. Once it starts, it doesn't stop either. Every enemy from that point on has spinning arrows. Even crafting stations can take dozens of seconds before the options become available.  
---
Also frustrating: excessive server lag in combat, especially with multiple players in the area.  
---
Also frustrating: X01 mod plans weren't added to MODUS even though we have plans for all of the other power armors available in vendors now. So we're still needlessly server hopping.  
---
Also frustrating: being attacked while still loading into an area.  
---
Also frustrating: Pain Train aggros the robots at White Springs even though it doesn't damage them or make the Pain Train sound.  
---
Also frustrating: my teammate disappearing when we load into an area at the same time.  
---
Also frustrating: crashing to desktop caused by the Targeting HUD mod.  
---
Also frustrating: applying a mod to a weapon/armor but the game actually selects a different mod and applies it instead.  
---
Also frustrating: the quantity slider wraps around from 0 to 25000 in the trading menu.  
---
Also frustrating: when trading, the item that is actually offered is the one your cursor is currently over when hitting "OK" from the quantity menu, not necessarily the item you originally selected.  
---
Also frustrating: the user interface is wonky again in 21:9 resolutions. Also there is a little grey box in the bottom right corner of the screen.  
---
Also frustrating: waiting weeks for patches, which often times introduce several new bugs :/  
---
/u/Ladydevann /u/LoneVaultWanderer /u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
So then what is the answer, if it shouldn't be easy, but its too hard, how do you make it easier without being too easy?
---
As it stands though, I don't feel the game is very grind heavy at all. Sure if you want top tier shit, yeah, its grind heavy, as any game SHOULD be, but everything else is far from being grindy.
---
Psst, can you look into setting it to auto target heads instead of torsos as well? I have gotten pretty good at left arrowing after every vats gun-fu shift, but it does slow down the potential... 
---
Not true, at least not on PS4. Stop spreading false information, please.
---
Clearly it's not what  OP signed up for, or he wouldn't be complaining about it.
---
FAST money maker:  Get a Hazmat suit server hop to a nuked whitesprings, pick up flux.   With Green Thumb you can get 1400 caps worth in about 5 mins.  Vendor run.  WIN
---
I think the main problem with melee is how pvp can be initiated. Someone can be hitting you with a sledgehammer and if you shoot back they are already in melee range to wreck your day. That's the only time I ever have a problem with melee people otherwise they have a hard time getting to me befor I gun them down.
---
A: not a problem I've ever had. Ever. B: Haven't had this problem since patch 3 C: I have a team and we've failed to kill her once, because she stopped taking damage.
---
If you wanna talk about it, go make a thread man. This is just a thread pointing out an advantageous mechanic. Not a debate about the meta of queen battles and potential associated bugs. Maybe, people should stop fighting a boss that can travel halfway across the region up against the worlds end point?
---
Worth doing a few times for novelty and legendaries to see if you get lucky, i wouldnt grind it.
---
You can also get the witches's costume plans. It spawns on a trick or treater that is laying in the road near Dyer Chemical. On the map, near Dyer, you can see a road marker that says 65 I think it is. Near that intersection you can sometimes come across a dead npc in the road dressed in a witches' costume and she may have the plans on her. Those costumes cost only a bit of cloth and plastic to make AND with the right perks you can get 45 caps for each one. They are so light to carry, you can carry a whole lot of them and go to all the vendors.  ARE you able to go in the Enclave bunker yet? If not that's another 200 caps you could be getting per day
---
apology accepted along with 50% of your shit.. we decide what 50% is. ;)
---
Well they fit very well as long as they inventivize you to microtransactions which is favourable earning modell for bugthesda
---
I totally agree, sure some people may have bought atoms to buy the item but how many people had the atoms from playing, I did and how much fun I can have running through Appalachia dressed as grognak swinging an axe I play solo so the boost was entirely lost for me
---
Are you guys aware of/fixing/have a fix planned for the 2-shot VATS glitch? 2-shot weapons currently miss *vastly* more than the non-legendary versions and seem to share VATS probability numbers displayed.
---
The flux notes are lying about in the military wing of the Enclave bunker in the room with the vendors
---
For a bit then w few mins later he ran into him again and killed him...then a few mins later got into a battle royale type cat and mouse game with 2 other players...
---
Where were the people complaining about White Knight and missile launchers being too strong? Bethesda nerfs for it's own reasons. 
---
My friend and I couldn't join the same server last night because the server I was on was full.
---
This is completely subjective and speculative. 
---
Until they publish active player numbers, we won't know.
---
You are remembering incorrectly. I started buying them around late December and they've been that price. 
---
It's anecdotal but I was curious since it wasn't just one server by almost 10 in two days. 
---
r/unexpectedfuturama
---
Its a pain to manage mostly just having to eat and drink constantly - but I don't have a problem with enough water and food to keep myself hydrated/fed.  Just a chore checking both constantly to remain rejuvenated.

---
I did find somewhat of a fix for this.
---
I had several walls in my CAMP with tree limbs sticking through, so I went outside and placed random bookshelves to make the trees disappear. After placing one of them, I accidentally stored it and found that the tree did not reappear.
---
So maybe try placing objects to make the intruding flora disappear and then just store or scrap the objects and you should be good to go.
---
Are u on now?
---
&gt; if they made the grind easier, I think they'd lose a lot of players.
---
You and Bethesda management are on the same page there. I wonder how that's working out for them.
---
its all the bans
---
Not really in my opinion. Might be for others but what its dropping and the repair for weapons after running a nuke and SBQ isn't worth it at all anymore. 
---
Someone started shooting me in the back of the head while I was trading with a vendor once. I just server hopped.
---
Thank for adding :)
---
Unfortunately, this post didn't get hundreds or thousands of upvotes... is it poor form to tag someone like /u/Ladydevann?  If it is, then, of course, I won't tag her...
---
Update: last laugh doesn‚Äôt make you drop an artillery grenade either :( 
---
I've tried that. But after I relog they come back. That's why I generally just try to put the plain brown floor mat down since it generally blends in with the ground. But even some trees won't go away when you try placing things down üòì
---
That is understandable and I can see the problem. It may go back to the classic it's not possible to balance PvE and PvP at the same time :S 
---
I'd like those who prefer melee (and everyone else too) to have a viable build and I can see in PvE that it would be fair that trade off is hitting harder, but in asymmetric PvP that is a problem. 
---
On the full PvP server it might actually work because they'd have to close the range before the other can shoot instead of relying on the broken PvP mechanics.
---
It's not useful at all. You're better off with unyielding, mentats, etc :)
---
No they are not unless you're running a unarmed build with 120,000 crit dmg
---
Quick update.  I was just able to dup 2 more suits.  So this is defiantly a thing, CMD of the suit ends up being the same as the nuke core.
---
Ahh. I am still rocking my first generation xbox one I got for $80
---
Hmm... and being able to tag a container as private or public would be nice, too, wouldn't it?  For those benevolent folks who just want to leave a stash of water out in the desert.
---
&gt;  I‚Äôm still struggling at level 100+  
---
This is a warning sign about the person giving advice.
---
I noticed this last night, my fusion core count wasn't going down but my Ultracite FC count in my inventory was going down. 
---
What's the max overcharge you can get out of a Crafted UFC?
---
Because there needs to be something after lvl90 to kill
---
What time are you playing? I‚Äôve only noticed that small of numbers if it‚Äôs been midnight or later 
---
I found him for the first time last night stuck on a cliff and bought the communist propaganda poster plans from him. 
---
Glory to the all mighty red star.
---
No one cares boy.
---
This still seems like a lot more effort than just taking a powerplant, plopping down a fusion generator, and going back after half an hour to grab 3. 
---
Depends, do I get exp when they die? If so gimme that mutation now. Free exp! 
---
I got Speed Demon randomly the other day from having too much rads (I always have high rads because of my Radicool perk which raises my strength the higher my rads).  It went away after I took some radaway but then I got it again about an hour later and ranked up my starched genes perk and now I honestly don't think I can go back to moving at normal speeds.  Add the rad worm bug on top of it and I'm basically the Flash.
---
I find it discourages it actually.  I've not had someone pick a fight they wouldn't win yet.  
---
You sick person. You do get XP when they die and it makes it that much worse üò≠
---
Everyone could just wear the free one from the in game questline...
---
So you think the weapon is complete garbage bc it uses a different perk for ammo weight reduction? But then you go on about how you really want to use it. Personally I think Bandolier makes sense, since cannonballs generally didn't explode irl. The "explosion" was usually a result of things it hit, causing shrapnel explosions and the like. I don't really see the issue of having unique perk requirements for unique weapons. The Gauss rifle is another example. It's a Ballistic weapon, requires Science perks to upgrade, ammo is under energy. I wouldn't say it's garbage bc of that.
---
Unarmed is generally better and you could hit 120k with stealth crits if you use all the buffs revenent, ect
---
Have got to try this - I'm running out of things for daily runs and not enough time to play during the week.  Will PA it though.
---
Yea I know, I never like it when companies start nerfing guns instead of buffing enemies. Without unyielding you can't. It is a theoretical if you could get a set of unyielding +1strength which aren't that rare if you farm west tek. Plus the 15 you have base. That gives you your 35. 
---
10-12 on PS4, that seems quite reasonable, on PC I rarely see more than that and usually less, thought this was the normal number of players on a server.
---
Were the dupers mostly on console?
---
LOL.....first time my plague killed a rabbit I was in power armor and thought I stepped on him.
---
It's a great mutation for me because I always seem to catch diseases but never have any disease cure.
---
Seems like the rewards process has been outsourced as well now: rewards have to be calculated by hand, then typed onto paper using old typewriters, scanned into pentium 2 PCs running Windows 95, then uploaded to the servers via modem. Taking all that into account, it's happening remarkably fast!
---
Those lovely fluffy defenceless bags of exp.... nom nom nom, so very delicious.

This is not Fallout 4, trash, sell, give to your lower char or give them away to other people.  You don't need to keep everything

There is also word going around that you can take almost depleted fusion cores and turn them into ultracite fusion cores and ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù them. I have not tried it myself because I rarely use PA. 
---
Usually 8-10pm EST which is why it seemed strange. I totally can see lower numbers later in the evening but usually servers are quite full then. I'm curious what the peak player times are.
---
Grindy, really? Laughing in EverQuest.
---
Legit game changer
---
I use unarmed when not in PA, then switch to 2 handed perks when i do. 
---
Holy shit how do they keep fucking up such simple things like this and not fix it for weeks?
---
Take out the pieces put it away and take it out put pieces back should fix it?
---
Do they taste of chicken?
---
I wonder why it's not working for me then
---
Also there are invisible ninja ghouls (no joke) found one in whitespring 
---
I‚Äôd assume outside of standard 9-5 works hours are the peak and where the west coast and east coast overlap within the after work period. Do you live in North America? 
---
ü§£ that's hilarious, and yes I do agree. It makes it much easier to stroll through and area with level 5 rad roaches that I don't have to worry about wasting weapon condition/ammo/time on. So if it's not a disease that's bugging me at the moment I generally just let it be
---
The nerf was needed. Tse shotguns use to be able to snipe 
---
I dont think he needed it. Whats needed is a sense of humor, which no one below this line seems to have. 
---
The first two comments were obviously jokes, i attempted to follow suit, but it seemed everyones panties were already bunched up their rectums.
---
Lighten up, people.
---
Does this mutation prevent diseases then? I have it but still get them.
---
yes.

Yeah it can be done. Just open the social tab &amp; at the bottom you'll see a search box. Type in the username &amp; hit enter.

Yes i am
---
S15 P3 E7 C4 I5 A14 L8 gives you shotguns and unarmed or pistols and melee weapons, Heavy Guns and pistols ect, Rifles are a waste unless you love handmades or Dragons.
---
Try a new char.  Just about every grief or workshop attack happened when I was sub level 35 on my second char.  The reality is that griefers don't want a fair fight, and a high level stands a far better chance of giving them one.
---
There are chickens that drop chicken thighs. But looking at the way the mutated chickens look, I'm not ruining any of my crock pots by putting them in there...

Also one in the civic center

Eyebots for me once all hanging out making those weird noises.
---
Yes, EST. I'd be interested in the distribution of hours per player as well. I doubt they will ever publish these statistics but I'd be interested to see how it compares.
---
you can PA, but you take less rads in Haz suit 
---
Finally.
---
I keep 10 cores, but that is only because most are at 75% or less. 
---
The bonus is already over, it wasn't permanent lol
---
I think youre speaking for yourself and imposing your ignorance on others.

But hey, what do i know? Certainly not what a pyramid scheme is, thats for sure.

Unless it's stolen *again*.
---
It's not that water is hard to get.  It just annoying to constantly keep a case of water on you anytime you want to go exploring.  I can't imagine trying to manage my weight without Thru Hiker.   This isn't fun, this is tedious.  And of course I have to swap over to my one random Dromedary card because every drop counts.... Whitespring water fountain FTW!
---
Is this where Rastakhan died?
---
Why? I keep passive mode on when playing in teams and its not OP except against ghouls.
---
Like many others have mentioned, it's not difficult to find and collect food and water, but it's tedious to drink and eat so often. I'd kill for the ability to put a function on my favorites wheel which would consume a random [food or water] based on my needs, prioritising prepared/cooked lower condition items.
---
No you still get diseases. Just for every disease you have you put off more and more poison.
---
its prob just cosmetic like tatter dress slot replacement
---
Westek has a suicide bomber outside 
---
Nope, it creates an aura of poison around your character that increases with intensity as you aquire more diseases
---
you on PC what weapons are you using?
---
I know some of then spawn under the ground.  Had an assaltron killing me then saw its lazer shoot straight up from under me.
---
I'm here trying to spawn the vendor. Is that the least u will take on the long coat? Any way u would take trade and some caps?
---
I agree with this. When I changed my perspective and understood that this is a very different Fallout... my game became much easier to deal with. 
---
This guy
---
First, I agree. I should be playing always in the higher level areas but often have to spend a session in lower level area not wearing PA where I can look for cores without using them up in the process. I'd be happy with something that made 1 per hour or so.
---
Question for all... is it only the power station workshops that make fusion cores, all workshops, or some yes and some no?
---
They have to be different but have heard there's another in game item. I dunno though
---
Sure, but I'm not sure anyone is taking into consideration the biggest form of endgame that currently exists: farming Bloated Glowing Ones in a Nuke Zone.  This is important, because people already complain about being killed by them and having their Junk stolen.  Those BGO's constantly and quickly heal as long as they are directly exposed to the nuclear fallout, which means even if it takes 6 or 7 shots from a Lv.50 Rifle to kill one outside a nuke zone, it would take far more inside one.  And that's assuming you can live long enough with them dealing 2-3 times the damage, swarming you and having one of the fastest melee attacks of NPC's in the game.
---
On the other hand, it would also give Legendary Armor effects such as Ghoul Slayer and Zealot some use when farming large numbers of those enemies,  However, a lot of players would be against the idea of being essentially forced to farm/wear specific armor just so they can play the way they have been, against a specific enemy type.
---
Before they make any change along the lines of this, they'd need to do an in game survey to get the opinions of everyone and not just 1% of this reddits total followers(at time of posting).
---
Do you not know coop exists?  Seriously, it should be obvious.  Charisma is meant for coop play and for that it's really good.  It may be useless solo but I seriously don't understand how you can blindly say it's under powered.
---
Duping def happens. I've caught 2 people doing it and stole portions of their stuff while it was in the box they were using to dupe. I then got shot at and cursed at on the mic. They got reported and believe were banned.
---
I believe the Gauss Rifle should also be looked at in this regard.
---
I consider the rest of your comment contrarianism just for the sake of contrarianism. People really love telling others they are "wrong".
---
I merely want to have this acknowledged by Bethesda in either direction, intended or an accident. I will change my playstyle to suit.
---
I garuntee you its an API call being made to see what loot dropped.  
---
If you notice when you kill things fast, often like a glowing rat, they will die and if you still have them highlighted you'll see "rat meat" but like a half second later, "glowing meat" will pop in.  Thats almost 100% because there's pre-defined loot that drops to save API calls, and a separate call is made for "special" loot.  all the RNG etc is occurring in that API call.  
---
Because bethesda is running their cloud infrastructure on commodore 64s with 2600 baud modems, those api calls take a while to return.  Just be patient.  Have you heard how long those dial up modem handshakes can take?
---
Yes this is actually a really good price for the coat,ive seen it be sold for 5k caps
---
And that may be part of the problem too. I know for fact I scrapped a combat leg a few nights ago, saw it pop, and jumped for joy that I wouldn‚Äôt have to keep server hopping to no avail. Then couldn‚Äôt make it...and I got sad, then mad lol
---
Anecdotal, yes, but it did happen
---
There‚Äôs a comprehensive mod list with scrapping rates that was data mined, but I don‚Äôt think they have armor yet. I‚Äôll post it if I find it
---
I find it is best to not try and figure out the engineering aspects used in the fallout series. The only way to understand them is to have a degree from Vault Tech University. 
---
I thought it capped out at 90%, too, but I have Bear Arms 3 to reduce my Gatling Laser from 19.8 to 1.98 and then equipped a 20% weapon weight reduction armor and the weight went down to 1.58. 
---
Then how do I catch it.  I'm not a cyborg that I'm aware of
---
bloodied Unarmed, and 2 Handed are the strongest in the game followed by bloodied Shotguns.
---
I just haven‚Äôt picked it up cuz energy weapons are shit in general
---
Posted about this last week and got a reply, they are aware of it and a fix should be out in the next patch.
---
Ok I posted it
---
Ok. I had to ask. Sorry to waste your time. 
---
Same here, those two and my solo Lone Wanderer 5\* are all I use Charisma for, if I want it raised I take a Grape Mentat or Day Tripper. 
---
I'm merely pointing out that from a logic standpoint, either perk makes sense. But just bc you have to change a card doesn't make the weapon "complete garbage". 
---
is furious any good? i've had terrible luck with bloodied. I just die asap lol
---
You used the wrong form of "you're." Spelling errors are all trivial in most cases. Don't worry about it, man
---
What about the sight for the gatling gun. That one is worse
---
I rarely find canned dog food. I prolly stay ate a steady 15 or 20 at a time and do not sell it 
---
Sure, unless you crash and lose the workshop. Or you don't want the PVP exposure of holding a workshop while you're doing other things. Or caps are more valuable than your excess flux from queen kills. *Shrug* with the number of people complaining about fusion cores I figured I'd share.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** Doctormaymays! ^(hug)
---
**Tested while in Camp**
---
Without Perks, disease, or mutation:  
---
I've tracked a need to drink as frequently as every 5 minutes, after consuming enough water to "top off" the meter.  
---
The "thirst" is happening faster than (3) standard water purifiers can keep up with, again while standing in camp.  
---
What however I find really odd, is the results are erratic, doing the same test again, again no perks,'mutations or diseases, standing in camp, the "thirst" meter remained unchanged for 20 minutes.  
---
I always get 110. No idea beyond that.
---

Staying safe is a contradiction, kill kill and more kill blood on my D\*ck forever.
---
It is for me. She gives my Gatling a nice target and I like the flux reward.  If I get a nice legendary or plan, even better.  And, I like taking her down with a bunch of other folks. I‚Äôve only been a part of one failed attempt because she froze. 
---
Tried that the suits are permanent.  I can remove the cores and do what I would normally do with any suit.  I guess I will just save them up until either Bethesda fixes this bug and removes my dups or I can use them for multiple setups.  
---
Awww, this post reads like "Baby's First Naughty Song" or "Baby's First PG13 Language".
---
It's so cute.
---
We all make mistakes. Mine was not paying attention to what I was picking. Don‚Äôt be so harsh  everyone can benefit. If you don‚Äôt agree that‚Äôs fine just trying to be helpful. 
---
True but I'm sure that they intended it to be useful just didn't do it right.
---
Had that with mole miners a couple if times, they shot rockets at me

Its ok ty
---
I've been noticing that sometimes when an enemy gets close to me the barrel of my weapon clips through the enemy and when I shoot them it "misses" because the end of the gun is sticking out the back of them...

Yeah, but if there are 15 at once...
---
This guy gets it.

Haven't used it.

~400 hours and have never been griefed.

Because this is Todds cash cow.

I would love to find someone who uses the Broadsider with a differing opinion.
---
i have dropped so many legendaries because i was over my carry limit.  
---
Ghoul slayer legendary fat man? goin in the dirt.
---
I ran rifles and shotguns until lvl 30. Hated continuously running out of ammo all the time. Got the blade of Bastet from quest reward and haven‚Äôt looked back. Plenty of perks for 1 armed and you can rebuild the blade up to lvl 45 which is nice. 
---
I'm on xbox. An I have to check what exactly everything is but I think it's a mutated gatling gun, mutated machete, mutated armor piercing knife, a double ammo capacity tesla, and double ammo capacity shotgun.  All lvl 50 stuff, I sell anything lvl 40 n below. I carry so many weapons cause I fly through ammo btw
---
Agreed. This is not difficult at all.
---
Its worse if you have speed demon.
---
There are some weird things going on with weight lately. I signed in yesterday and was about 20 below overencumbered, got a couple things that pushed me over, sold them, and then fast traveled home and signed off. When I signed back in later I was 200 over. I wasn‚Äôt carrying any of the normal culprits that you forget about except one missile. I still don‚Äôt know where it all came from. Relogging didn‚Äôt fix it. 
---
The two times I've killed a mirelurk queen she has disappeared before I can loot her. 
---
Thanks for that. I currently find myself just ignoring all night heavy weapons because they break so fast and don't seem to kill much. 
---
We should just have an item that produces fusion cores in our camp.
---
Only to end up making it worse.

I built this last night after watching yesterday‚Äôs video.

Actually sentinel and cavalier armor is not duped many people have mix and match sets. It is EXTREMELY hard to get good sentinel and cavalier armor because people won‚Äôt take caps for them they only accept trades. I have been searching the market for an assist sentinel marine left arm for weeks and still have found nobody with one. 
---
I often use the blue lunchbox in watoga station or the brown bag just outside the door of whitesprings station.  I dump loads of ammo, legendaries, plans, junk... basically anything I can't sell in one of those two places, as that's usually where I stop my vendor route.
---
If you think this awesome, please allow us to stack foundations and stuff much easier by default.  At the moment you have to use some very arbitrary tricks to do stuff like this if I'm not mistaken.  For the sake of creativity, it would be awesome if we were able to do so without needing to jump through some clever hoops.

On PC. I have better luck by exiting to the main menu, then going into the Atom Shop for 30 secs or a min, then going back to main screen and joining the game. Always works with getting to a new world for me that way.

So no interest of sleeping until it's repaired 
---
My favourite one is acting like you want someone to clear your bounty and then hitting them with a TSE shotty when they initiate the pvp
---
Its going to be a trash mode, really lame you wont be able to attack bases an such in adventure mode.
---
This was a bug fixed in the patch before the current one. Doing too much damage with a short window of time would make the server ignore it and revert the health loss on the target.
---
The current patch doesn't seem to have implemented most, if not all, of the fixes from the patch before it, which is why it seems like so many things broke again.
---
yes. for my build (melee) the marine wetsuit gives the best bonuses (STR and END). i have it upgraded to the third level and haven't been able to find the plans for the final fourth level for the life of me :-( 
---
You might get clapped with a dupe ban, have you tried putting your pieces in a new frame?
---
I honestly never notice it. I heard great things about it but I've been whacked from everything from deathclaws, ghouls, to mole rats.... and I never see their health drop.
---
I'd like to upvote this comment alot. Thank you for testing it
---
I prefer deathclaw gauntlets or power fists
---
And don't forget Military Duct Tape yields Ballistic Fiber as well. I regularly vendor away some of it as I hardly ever have to repair regular armor. I'm glued to my PA.

They were hit everywhere.

I feel like 40-60% the player base was hit.

I think you mean "taking a pass at" not "taking a pass on"; the later of which implies you won't bother doing anything.

Wow! You did an awesome job!! c: 
---
if you need an ultracite explosive vent plan, ya.  otherwise, definitely not.
---
They've started releasing inside the vault more frequently on Thursday's so we might get some news then. They should probably start releasing more hotfixes though, I agree.
---
What system are you on? I'll buy one from you if PS4 to start the ball rolling.
---
Otherwise, to gain caps faster, I'd suggest:
---
- Get 3* bargain perk ASAP and only use it while selling to vendors.
---
- Mark all junk which has an individual item value higher than 0 (nuclear material, silver, gold, fiberglass, Ultracite, titanium, etc. all of them) and junk with high bulk value like copper
---
- Generally playing regularly while collecting those things I've marked along with other nonsense I've picked up along the way (drugs, flowers, light legendaries, etc.) and bargain selling to vendors nets me my 200 x 7 caps daily.
---
Most people don't realize that not all junk needs to be bulked to sell. Anything with item value higher than 0 can be sold individually to vendors (a few listed above), that's the best tip I can give.
---
What kind of degenerates are downvoting this (like that even matters yikes), maybe you should do some research yourself. Stop spreading around fake shit, this poor guy put a post on the market subs because you lied to him saying these guns exists. Would love someone to give some proof :)))) 
---
I have not seen any of these plans available for sale since the hotfix last week.
---
I have also not seen the BOS combat armor plans in grafton in Over 50 tries
---
I use a .50 cal, so I am always in constant need of materials for more bullets. For me the entire time I played it was a nonstop grind, which is fine before you've completed all the quests and have no reason to go to many places except to farm materials. After you've done the small amount of content there is, all that is left is grinding for top tier stuff. I have 416+ hours (Can't get an exact number because the in-game clock stopped counting) and at least 300 has been spent farming. Not a single good drop. That's an awful grind. 
---
People, and Bethesda, want this to be an MMO so badly, so they should make it more like an MMO. Give us an in-game market place to buys and sells things. No more shifty online sales through Reddit, no more people buying guns for real money. Add a hidden loot timer. If you haven't gotten at least a tier 2 drop in X amount of hours, force a random drop. Doesn't completely solve the problem but it helps. Better yet, rework the rng on loot drops so the odds that a rare weapon will drop, even if it's only a 2% increase. No wait, fix the bug that causes enemies not to have loot altogether.
---
Give us more side quests. This "MMO" has the least amount of sidequests I've seen. Make events worth doing. As it stands, they aren't worth spending caps to go to for some diluted stimpaks, 10 cement, and a radaway. Give people a PvE server so that our camps don't get blown to pieces and we have to spend the materials we have to grind for fixing our camps. Stop nerfing perks to make people farm more thinking it will keep people around. It doesn't. 
---
There are dozens of things that can be done to help the grind in this game, yet it only gets worse. I want this game to succeed so badly because I really enjoy it (not in its current state since it crashes on me all the time lol) and would love for this to be a Cinderella story, come back and be better. 
---
(Didn't intend for this to become a rant lmao)
---
How do you out a fraction tag by your reddit name?

*angry react
---
No, that would defeat the point of workshops.

I kind of noticed that when I'm fighting higher level enemies my weapons break faster than if I'm fighting lower level enemies...not sure if that is a thing, I never tested it, but that's what it feels like

I've been server hopping all morning though o_O I spawn in, farm, log out, log back in, all within 5-10 minutes, puts me in a new server literally every time.
---
I dont pvp enough for it to bug me and I love my sniper stealth build so if mr. Sledgehammer likes is melee build more power to him. Only real think I want them to fix is heavy guns and energy guns. 
---
I'm confused about how you people construct these ginormous monuments. I can barely construct a two-story box before my building budget is used up.
---
Agree, a wanted player still does slap damage to players not engaged in combat with them which makes them no bigger a threat than any other rando. Perhaps less of a threat since wanted players do not see any other players, besides teammates, on the map. 
---
It causes a latent carry over after you are free of the disease. It won‚Äôt show, but you still get the weird buffs.

Thanks. From the search Ive done it seems like SG, Class Freak, and Bloody Mess are chosen often.

Is that related to those 100-free-minute AOL discs I have that my grandson Billy keeps laughing about?

I have no idea, I watch YouTube videos and people have like 8-10k caps and I'm like "Wtf how?!" I saw one video with a level 22 who had 10k caps, maybe exploits?

Wow, thanks.

I'm a PS4 player and stopped playing last week after being optimistic about the game and playing daily since beta.
---
I love Fallout and keep reading this sub but have no reason to log in. I *want* to play but there's nothing to do. And PvP being the focus of the first content release was disappointing. No new quests, no new content. Makes me sad. I bought the Tricentennial edition expecting to love the game and play a long time. It only lasted 2 months.  üôÅ 
---
It says in its description that it's worn under armor, and it's in an "under-armor" category for apparel that wasn't there before. It's meant to take the same slot as the vault suit or road leathers - I'm just wondering what lining mods it gets, if it gets any at all. 
---
I love my knife collection, I carry several with me, they weigh practically nothing and have different buffs for different enemy types.
---
My only other weapon is my Combat Shotgun (no TSE rubbish) used for SpamBeasts, trios of Yao Gui and MireLurk Kings or Anglers if they come up, singles can be knifed. For the trios I have to wear Power Armor as damage is too high for normal armor, most everything seems to be OK in standard armor.
---
Ghoul mobs at Whitespring give high radiation if glowing so I either use Power Armor or keep RadAway on a hot key (PC).
---
This keeps my weight down and less fuss, then I can hold more meds and junk without QOL perks.
---
With a melee build I can kill level 90+ death claws and once SpamBats have been forced to land with Enforcer 3\* they can be knifed to oblivion also. Melee 1H is fast and furious, two handed and unarmed though slower can give some serious damage. Good luck.

I was wondering this myself. I have been working with the Ultracite PA from the Brotherhood quest line and tried my perks and repairing the helmet with 16 int and fix it good perk. The helmet dropped from 88 ballistic protection with normal durability to 78 with 200% durability. That said when I built the legs with Power Smith maxed out (or whatever the PA building perk is called) and 16 int they went from 68 ballistic protection to 88. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand it but then again a lot of things are a bit wonky in the wasteland.
---
Yeah that's why I'm reporting it now so there is a better chance that I don't.  
---
 I'm able to put pieces onto the duped frame just like all the others.  Only way for me to get rid of them is to release them and in some cases they show back up in my inventory.  I'm back up to five suits after releasing two yesterday and giving one (this one was a legit one) to my GF.  In total I think I've been able to dup 8 suits.  I started to take notice after the third one popped into existence.  
---
A brief history about me.  I do do beta testing so it's pretty normal for me to find these odd things.  Lately I've been trying to find areas along the invisible boarder around the map seeing if I can clip outside of it.  I've only touched maybe 1/16th of the boarder and I did find an area where you can clip into the Nuka Cola bottle silo thing at the factory.  Not much use for that besides hiding from people though.  
---
Yeah, the emotes work fine in general. I just meant that the worst experience I've had other than 1 dude that attacked me was that people ignore each other - I.e. Not even remotely a problem.
---
Most people I run into will generally communicate in some way, emote or otherwise.
---
Since people seem to be having wildly different experiences with it, I'm just curious if it's related to region and/or platform (I.e. A given demographic happens to have an increased number of assholes, and that demographic also gets assigned to the same set of servers independent of their "asshole quota").
---
Like if you live in an area more conducive to exploiters, like say a college town with kids looking to make quick money via selling duped stuff on Ebay, then you might be more likely to be on the same servers as them than I am in a tiny rural town. 
---
Take them to the vault an drop them on the dead guy or inside boxes at train stations.
---
Why save them? They just take up space in your stash and are so plentiful in-world that when the time comes you can easily pick up a few
---
Brahmin for leather there‚Äôs a lake where 3 spawn just keep getting their hide 
---
 The game is fine. Sure things don't all do what you would hope they would but I have very little trouble with the game in general. 
---
 Its the players that have no idea how to play a game like this. Its complicated keeping all the stacks of things and attributes for every damn thing and networking that at the same time, but they do a pretty good job.
---
 Its not a single player game you can finish. Its an MMO you live in. Understanding that may help a lot of people to deal with the world better. Perhaps not. ;)

It's so frustrating... I knew it was going to be buggy and terrible but I hoped I could actually play it.  I might honestly just use my free windows 10 upgrade though if you think it helped. I'm a diehard Windows 7 user but I just wanna play my dang Fallout!!
---
I don't think a linear increase in STASH would be a solution. It's only a band-aid to a much bigger problem in terms of inventory. As the game lifespan progresses so does the content. We can't just have an increase every once in awhile and pretend it's going to solve all of our problems.
---
At the minimum, we should have a separate stash that solely caters to the raw resources in the game. For example; a repository with X boxes (one resource per box) where each box holds Y (weight). These could be upgraded to carry more weight or in general add another box to the repository.
---
If we could get something like that, it would definitely free up a ton of space in our STASH inventories. It might be a good amount of work to implement, but if done right it should go a long way towards making a more permanent and accessible form of inventory management.

Is that at flatwoods? also how much leather is in a hide?

i don't think i've ever been griefed as a level 88. i take a lot of workshops and i end up wanted somehow... (I don't take owned shops)  
---
People often come by and kill me when i'm doing stuff because i'm wanted.  I have my own gear i can kill them with but usually i just wave hello after i respawned. They are just doing their game their way and its within legal limits so i got no prob with it.  
---
Most fun i had in the game i probably was considered a griefer but that's because there's no way to communicate intent through just emotes...  45 minute battle over the gorge workshop with two guys about half my level. lots of fun but they probably hated me :/
---
Unfortunately that then requires me to reinstall the game, since I actually do want to try playing it and I have no intention of giving up like a weenie
---
So far this year, patches come every two weeks. Two came last week because the community rallied around Bethesda's rollback programs not detecting several previous fixes had been rolled back. I expect an ItV later this week, most likely Thursday, and a patch most likely next Tuesday.
---
What if they make changes, and suddenly, your build sucks? Do you not deserve a chance to change based on their choices?
---
I shouldn't have to change servers. 
---
Watch for cobra chickens 
---
AOL??? LOL
---
You wish.
---
Bethesda is currently undergoing UAT testing on their compuserve APIs.  Expected BW increase of 400% with new latency in the 300-400ms range.
---
I support your Radom acts of violence 
---
Hey so she drops two different prime plans for Gatling laser: ultracite and vanilla, I guess. Which is needed for the ultracite cores? Luckily I have both.
---
Could have been yeah. Usually the density there is pretty low but occasionally you find a cluster of them. 
---
Hmm that sucks, where did you find the plans btw?
---
I expected it to have issues, but I was expecting gameplay bugs, not unable-to-play-the-game bugs. Guess I should have lowered my expectations!
---
^
---
I look every single time and I have once found a few known, common, plans.
---
I'll keep looking, and keep expecting nothing.
---
I just want to loot bloated corpses before some rando grabs my Hardened Mass.
---
Wait.
---
Around a week after release I was attacked by three Scorchbeasts near Watoga, it took me around 2300 .50 cal rounds to just deal with their Scorched summons despite having all ranks of Heavy Gunner and Stabilized. I didn't waste bullets on Scorchbeasts unless they landed at which point they were easy target, one of them glitched and stopped moving and from point blank range, it took a little over a full magazine of the .50 cal machine gun to the head to kill a single one.
---
You're an asshole but I play the same way....well I guess we both are assholes
---
Yeah I've only found 2 normal ones in-game one dropped by a yao guai the other a scorch-beast drop of all things...
---
The brainless are what are keeping the game afloat in your eyes. In my eyes the other 99% of players who never use Reddit and just play the game are doing well. 
---
 You may well laugh, that's your right. Although your reply is a bit OTT and comes across as a Bethesda Employee trying to be street wise in the reply üòÇ
---
I would be more than happy to kill all of the Cobra Chickens. Those things are evil homie 
---
playing a bloodied build is somewhat similar if you play at 60hp all the time.
---
Thanks I will try that. 
---
i have had them scream 'OH NO" sometimes when i nearly one shot them in melee. it makes me LEL
---
where are legendary mutants and are they any better at drops than anyone else?
---
45 levels above. I rest my case 
---
a few caps maybe
---
Well I haven't checked personally because I have not seen grahm since the last patch, I just saw a video
---
I just called ASPCA on your ass.
---
Actually, since you are a programmer, then I'll throw you the object-oriented part of this.  Nerd out with me? :)
---
Obviously the Stash system is a huge, global (laggy) database.
---
The C.A.M.P. system also has to exist in a huge, global (laggy) database to track the locations and conditions etc etc.
---
World loot containers seem, to me, to run on a different measure.  Everyone sees different things in the a container, likely generated at the moment you first mouseover (thus the lag you get on that first mouseover), but there's also tracking for whether or not you've looted that item in the last 24(?) hours.
---
My best guess is that any given container object (including corpse) carries a list Character IDs along with a timestamp, and the list is continually purged as timers expire.  It seems like container lag only comes into play when a container is generating new loot, and not if I go back to a container before the loot timer is up - it shows as empty instantly, which points to the data being stored in that individual object rather than some other bloated database.
---
Meanwhile, you can manually deposit something into a container and anyone can come loot it.  My best guess on that is that this data is stored \*inside\* the container's object code.  If so, then - once again - the system is there, you just need to push it out so players can use the system inside their CAMPs.  A secondary toggle to determine public vs. private looting is no big - you can either hide the contents completely or disable the Take button.
---
Fuck this game
---
Although OP said that, i think a lot of solo players are just accustomed to picking up/looting them in the wild.  
---
So it‚Äôs nice that we have 4 whole cores. I‚Äôd rather have 30 fully charged. It‚Äôs easier to manage my play style that way. 
---
If you get the hang of one of the power plants, you can always take the workshop and then get a dozen or so in one session and stock up that way!
---
Ya this happens.  I just stopped using rad-x entirely, and carry a lot of radaway.
---
The game is such a bugfest :(  embarrassing.
---
It was an accident I swear! üò≠üò≠üò≠

Check my profile

...what, NO ONE gets the CPAP joke?  I can't be the only person here dealing with sleep apnea...
---
I've had many recent encounters where I've had to help low level baboos  escape PvP war zones in the middle of Grafton or Morgantown. It's getting to be like Act 1 Kingdom Come out there. 
---
That's what they all say. You are damaged and need to be repaired.
---
Maybe don't use full auto, except for harder fights. If they gave full auto perks the ability to do 3 round bursts instead of spray and pray, I would play full auto builds. I know the minigun and the laser version is a different mechanic, but the only times I use them is if I picked one up with some ammo and decide to have fun for the few seconds that the ammo or gun lasts. 
---
I think the place was called Toxic Larrys, near Berkeley Springs. There are always 3 level scaled Snallygasters there and also a bunch of dead Radstag hung up, I think there are 2 randomized recipe locations too.
---
Each Snally hide is 2(4?) Leather and you can serverhop to get as many as possible
---
I‚Äôd name all my characters with famous Fallout dishes, like the Mississippi Quantum Pie and make the player I meet hungry!üòÅ
---
Yea I noticed there is no one on servers anymore. Last time I played was Sunday and someone dropped a nuke on queen. Literally two of us there an we were just swarmed to death.
---
Left and haven‚Äôt logged back on since.
---
No. They're fairly common and even craftable.
---
Seems to be literally 50/50 on assholes vs whiteknights
---
All I want is for the game to fit the screen correctly.
---
Kudos to you for being polite as you bring up your concerns and suggestions. I agree with what you have written as well!
---
Don't die as much. 
---
You forgot 3 and 4.
---
Like 1..2..?..?...5...6...PROFIT!
---
Sorry, used them already. Was hopping vendors looking for them post patch, and never saw them. 
---
Found them a day later in a container around Charleston.
---
The ammo is the key. Any prime receiver gives you the ability to craft matching ammo. Both gattling lasers use fusion cores, both plans craft ultracite fusion cores.
---
Here‚Äôs a [link](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) 
---
I don't even have one on me or in stash anymore - just PA nuke zones.  Have too many Radaways and can shower later once I'm done.  If I find a nuked Whitesprings I'll do a loop around for ghouls and then go grab the flux.  Great idea though!
---
Carry weight is fucked since Patch 5.
---
I only gave the upvote for the joke lol
---
Behemoths in general should be 100x harder to kill. They shouldn't be an easy task. Same with deathclaws to an extent.
---
They can't just copy paste FO4 balance. They need to fine tune things for multiplayer. Add world bosses etc. Not just lazily add the same enemies and not change *anything*
---
I love it, never thought about purposely overencumbering somebody with treats. ü§£
---
I have Hard Bargain maxed, take every weapon an enemy drops and sell it. I also keep my stash relatively light by selling bulk junk I really don't need.
---
I second this post the grief era has begun in fallout my youngest son plays and he gets attacked non stop every time he logs in.I get attacked at least once a day and even my wife gets attacked. Even worse with the two shot explosive nerf you can‚Äôt even fight back I literally lost around 4 k caps trying to stop one griefer.
---
Hit him around 200 times couldn‚Äôt even make his health drop I‚Äôm 108 he was 110. 
---
Is this a writing issue? My writing is god awful, I know.
---
because the environment is damaged enough you savage
---
Unless I want to get a stat boost from a specific food/beverage, I use the cannibal perk and eat my kills. This keeps me from having to forage, cook, and store food that will eventually go bad anyway. As for water, I stockpile and sell it to vendors so I've almost always got a bunch on me, which could be why I haven't really noticed this yet. It's easy for something to not be a problem when you have an abundance of the resource in question, but a lot more noticeable if said resource is scarce. 
---
Do you have any Charisma cards up? You need 3 FREE points to share a card. At least that's how I remember it being
---
Hmm. Have you visited Tanagra Town?  Inside the tree at the bottom...
---
Only had my camp griefed once because they thought it was someone else‚Äôs. I am level 270.  But in the last 4 days I have had it destroyed multiple times.  People just running up for no reason and taking it out while I was cooking or while I‚Äôm out in the world only to see my camp is under attack. Also I have seen a massive, massive influx of people being d bags trying to get you into pvp or high level flat out attacking low level and destroying their camps as well then killing them.  It has gotten really bad lately and those that haven‚Äôt experienced it are lucky. 
---
I haven't in quite a while, still I find it rather amusing. 
---
I didn't know PETA survived the bombs lol /s
---
I sell chems, extra flora that I don't have the Boiled Water to prepare as food, food that is close to spoiling, Rad-X, any Radaway in excess of 15, Legendaries and some bulk items(but usually only on characters that have decent Charisma).
---
For characters with lower Charisma, I'll equip the Green Thumb perk and gather up hit up the forest for Flora, especially the farms.  For Rad-X and Radaway, having Pharma Farma 3 and making sure to search every container you come across can help you quickly stockpile enough to sell.
---
You assume people are in an area with choices. I don‚Äôt have Comcast thankfully but if my ISP sucked I‚Äôd have no recourse. 
---
This problem is worst on PC, it shows your account name bleck
---
Nah, the bottom section was explanation for my less straightforward points. 
---
‚ÄúTo explain the most important ones‚Äù
---
Well, I usually carry my handmade tse as my primary. My secondary is a furious laser pistol atm, but that was to do a challenge. Usually it is a combat shotgun, and my fallback weapon is either a 10mm smg or a revolver. Plus I carry about 10 frags and 10 plasma grenades. I have the demo perk, not that it is worth it anymore. 
---
You are a lifesaver!! Ty ty - the other site I use hasn't updated yet &amp; I forgot to check before I did the silo. üòòüòòüòòüòò
---
It'd be nice to be able to scrap them but really, if you're not using them just ditch them somewhere public.  They're not hard to find and they kill your stash. 
---
hah!!  Great answer!  Take my upvote :)
---
It works, especially with wood and cloth.
---
The radstag herds all over Toxic Valley is a good source of leather.
---
Ya, I think that's the meta, I'm trying to think of some things that may improve the viability of alternatives (even if something isn't the absolute best, not everyone wants to min max to the extreme, but with a proper build I believe every weapon type should be competitive somewhat)
---
I think the best way would be to balance the base weapons first sans legendary, as legendary effects change everything and each is unique so balancing them is very difficult. I think if you get the weapons on a good level at the base weapon level it will allow for better comparisons of the effect that the legendaries add across weapon types, so they can be more fairly balanced based on actual in game performance instead of like 300 percent nerfs because something is too strong but no way to quantify it.
---
If base weapons were strong enough against trash mobs but difficult against legendaries etc. That would be a good starting point in my opinion as the legendary effevts would push it beyond a bit to make them strong enough for endgame play. It would also let lower levels enjoy the game more so that they keep playing.
---
I'll just give you the pros/cons - they hopefully are taking longer for fixes and making sure what they patch actually works.  That could be a good thing even if it means we have to wait longer for a fix.  Or they could release rushed, half baked patches and just hope/pray they got it right.  Not sure which is better really.
---
BOS mod plans seem to be elusive since the patch.
---
Not sure about armor/under armor plans on the Enclave vendor.
---
But seems there are some holes in their "all plans available" update.
---
But you are forced to travel to them, and the enclave arguable has exclusive offers. That vendor has a rare inventory, exclusively offering X01 mods. Turn that to three vendors offering X01 mods, and the chance of seeing X01 jet packs increases more than the developers initially wanted
---
I feel a minor adjustment to the first one "compensated" by the last two that no one is asking for.
---
yup, over 900 hours and i've given up for now. wonky mutations, fluctuating weapon damages, food, drink and fusion cores not lasting very long. Queen fights taking way more ammo for standard 3\* loot, it's terrible.   
---
I don't know why they aren't reaching out to players at high level or with many in game hours to ask whet their experiences have been like. Leaves a bitter taste in the mouth!
---
I feel like getting the right keywords on your weapons should be pretty easy.
---
Yep, funneling is the key. I use a garage door with two foundations as a gate. Since I leave it open enemies usually attack stuff like the outside switch or even different parts of the wall since they don‚Äôt spawn inside.
---
Concrete defensive walls actually break in horizontal segments so turrets can hit enemies becore they get in.
---
It‚Äôs still often a good idea, if at all possible, to keep generators enclosed because the noise increases the rate of attacks.

Bloodied , vats crits, And some other not crazy perk

Dude had every perk and armor piece to make it work though. Was kind of magical.

The writing itself is just fine. It just reads like the author is a child that just learned their first dirty word and they are now a bad, bad boy. Baby's first leather jacket. Baby's first removal of a sticker that says "Do not remove".

So rebellious. So edgy.
---
Wait what!? Anthem is clearly balanced for 4 man teams, and free play does allow for more than 4 people in one instance?
---
Oh yeah, they became the New California Republic
---
I don't have any free. They're all being used by perks but I can share level 1 perks since 3 charisma with no problem at all. I'd hate to waste a 7th point only for it to still not work. I'll try removing 3 perks and see if that works when I get home. Thanks for the reply.
---
You probably have dysentery, it's a disease that causes your thirst meter to deplete very quickly.
---
Other than that disease, food and water needs are trivial. Do you not collect food? Have you tried planting crops at your camp? 
---
I will be soon now!
---
I sell down to 150 on non-rare junk.  The. Pad it out with purified water and crops (mostly tato's for cash crop).
---
The boxcar east of Watoga station tends to spawn the atone armor helmet that sells for 30ish caps if you can keep in rubber.
---
A life saver or a work doer? Good lord do your own work kid.
---
Vats targeting and headshots have seemed to be a good equalizer for me. 
---
Not knowing if you‚Äôve staggered or crippled an enemy because their animation doesn‚Äôt change is a big problem for me but if I‚Äôm aiming for the head they (organics like scorched or ghouls) usually only take 3-5 shots to the head at level 35-50. 
---
Gotta say this is a work of the art, I'm gonna try to make it myself but I'll probably end up with a terribad leaning tower 
---
Well isn't that, like, kinda logical? Who is well rested and well tuned when they come back from the dead? :-D
---
if you have a mutation or disease that lowers charisma you will be unable to share a level 2 card because it is lowing your charisma below 6.
---
How late do you play and what is your opinion of pvp?
---
I haven't done anything to you. Play your game how you want, don't judge me for how I play mine deal? 
---
Turn on your light after you mine the ore and look around.
---
Put it in the first overseers camp cache.
---
thank you, do you know anywhere with a lot of cash registers by any chance?
---
&gt; use the trash cans near the resort entrances
---
(At Least on PC) I do a lot of trash searching with *Can Do* perk &amp; people seem to leave things in the trash by the Vendor with crafting tables and stash boxes. So don't forget to check there. 
---
Keep in mind though that every minute in real time is one hour in Fallout. So for your character it‚Äôs about every 5-10 hours. It might be a hassle for us but I think it‚Äôs understandable given the way time works.
---
I actually did that for CAPS. Every time I see a nuke, I just equip green thumb and salt and go harvest tons of raw flux. They sell for more than refined for some reason which makes no sense. 
---
Annoying, however I'll take that over auto scrapping mods...
---
I was doing my first SBQ ever yesterday. We got her down to maybe 1/3 health... aaannnnndddd I get disconnected from the server üôÉ By the time I was able to get back in, my team had already finished her off. Awesome

Lol.  As if a republic would be PETA's choice of governing style.

Lol yeah u right
---
Has anyone studied what makes consumption bars go faster?
---
As a survival game with a goal of making us take care of ourselves, there are things that would make a whole lot of sense... and keep in mind that real-life humans need a lot more water a lot more urgently than we do food.
---
We SHOULD see our meters decrease more-rapidly if we:
---
* Sprint
---
* Are overburdened (on a sliding scale that gets worse the more you're carrying)
---
* Go into very hot environments
---
* Swing melee weapons (much harder work than pulling a trigger!)
---
* Teabag a fallen PVP opponent (squats are hard work)
---
I'm a level 84 I would love to help but sadly no real time now a days
---
I know the bowler hat counts.
---
I'll check that as well. But I believe marsupial only lowers intelligence. Thanks.
---
I'm surprised someone who didn't bother to read the body of your post hasn't gilded you yet.
---
I‚Äôd settle for a way to combine cores. Getting 3-4 cores that are 12% full is a bummer. 
---
Things don't weigh too much, the game demands too many materials.
---
If you go find some action, if go out to kill something that can kill you like scorchbeasts or glowing ones,, you will burn through 100-200 pounds of ammo, repair materials, and drugs in one session. Then you end up spending your next session or two just material hunting and rebuilding your supplies. You end up getting way to much of things you don't need. So you go to sell it to vendors, and either you don't have enough plastic or the vendors don't have enough caps for you to sell all your bulk.
---
God help it if you want to keep a mini gun, missle launcher, and Gatling Laser gun in your stash to be able to switch between them.
---
And then you remember that not everything turns to bulk, so you end up dropping 150 fiberglass spools.
---
But even when you stash is full you don't have enough materials to build a full set of power armor.
---
Wait, the trick to stack foundations from Fallout 4 still works or is this a new trick? I couldn't stack foundations with the old trick I used in Fallout 4.
---
Carnivore mutation and 2 small water purifiers on the ground is all you need.
---
Thanks! I've tried that forever ago and was sure it didn't count toward it
---
I get this without bloody mess lol
---
Like everyone says, enemy's can hit you before you can see them. The reason you run and snap back is the rubber band effect that happens when you run before game is 100% loaded.
---
It's the targeting HUD virus/glitch.
---
If one person has a Targeting HUD mod installed it spreads like a disease from one person to another until it crashes certain systems. I have a Ryzen/Vega 64 system and it has been unplayable for several weeks. It could happen anywhere but it is worse with the number of people and enemies in the SBQ encounter. And yes, we think it spreads to enemy NPCs as well.
---
Who hurt you so bad to the point you have to throw your weight at random people on Reddit :-(
---
Me and my squad mates will light Whitesprings aflame in prayer for you

Except the item is cosmetic only.  It was the week long event that gave the 15hp per.  Now that's that's over they are like any other cosmetic.
---
You don't even need to go through the friend on a different server business. Just move your camp ten feet to the left and replace everything.
---
Coming soon, to a golf course near you!
---
Bah I hate these threads I have 0 perks for food and have no issue with eating and drinking I do hotkey water.
---
Like it says in the description I'm fine with food and water that's not the problem. It's how often you need to use them. I shouldnt have to use water every 5-10 minutes while I'm wondering around my camp. Because it wasnt like that before
---
I recently aquired marsupial from being attacked by ghouls and I love it. The -4 intelligence is basically nothing, since the intelligence stat itself does almost nothing in this game and you can still use all your perk cards even with the -4 from the mutation.
---
I wasn‚Äôt communicating that at all. I was answering a question somebody asked me, how and why do I grief people.
---
Calling me Edgy or some shit is clear that you read the title and immediately discarded the content, wether or not you read it. You didn‚Äôt *process* the content. You just assumed something about my character. Equivalent of checking post history to argue with people.
---
I work Wednesday- Saturday so at the latest 10pm those days and sunday- tuesday as late as I can tolerate. Haven't done much pvp but I'm open to it. 
---
I have also seen this.
---
While I have you. Do you know if I have Starched Genes on and get something like roadworms if I could use a disease cure to cure it without risking losing marsupial?
---
9/9/9 2S 2E 1p iirc. I don't really play anymore and i can't remember for sure so don't quote me on that xD
---
You can also get a good chunk of Gold Ore in The Buring Mine, especially if you have PA with the Ecavator arms; however, it can be difficult to find the first time, due to the shit visability in there.  There's 7 nodes that can be gathered from and 3 or 4 more that you can't interact with(kind of like half the gold veins in Skyrim).
---
Looks like I need to do that dead "civil war" soldier quest some more, it's far easier than trying to find the plans for the Marine Wetsuit helm.
---
I think you meant "voila". :)
---
Soup is even more annoying. You have to find a lake and gather a bunch of dirty water then use double the wood scraps to boil the water and then make the soup.
---
I became an Herbivore and just eat raw corn.
---
&gt;Anyone with a character under level 100 has become fair game
---
What does being level 100 have anything to do with pvp? You realize that you stop gaining special points at 50 right?
---
You've got to understand that this is a multiplayer game. Multiplayer interactions are what this game was built for. That includes pvp. If you wanted a singleplayer game I'm sorry to say, but Fallout 76 is not it. It is very much multiplayer, that's kinda the entire point of the game.
---
Okay thank you :p
---
Haha nw, what container?
---
Feel free to add me still, trying to find people even if it's only a couple hours a week.
---
I agree there a major problem with that. It's a monopoly that shouldn't exist. Call your local politicians office and demand your voice be heard. We need to not allow lobbyist in Washington DC to payoff politicians.
---
I was thinking like 200 ,it looks cool so I don't really want to sell it unless someone on here really wants it
---
I would do it if I didn‚Äôt have such shit luck with violet flux. I never get it when I kill the SBQ (only once of the dozens of times), rarely see it in the blast zone down there, and 90% of the pitcher plants don‚Äôt open for me. Whenever I come out of it, I only ever end up with about 1 pure violet flux. Lmao every other kind is just spilling out of my cache, though.
---
Soups are my fav if you can purchase. Not sure. Carrot soup is +2 perception. Gives water and food at once. 
---
Doesnt negate the arguement, cosmetics should never ever offer stat bonuses 
---
Eh, too early for us. My team is active from midnight to 5am. Oh well, good luck dude.
---
My game play has been extremely jittery on Xbox. 
---
Plus the bug where I log in and can‚Äôt open the pip boy and then I‚Äôm frozen in place. 
---
Plus boosts like Super Duper notifications coming minutes well after the crafting takes place. 
---
Crafting Not happening, I abandon the task and then get the menu much later. 
---
There‚Äôs definitely a timing issue causing these interruptions. 
---
Yeah if it's true that someone's camp is being leveled repeatedly then there's a reason for it and that reason is not griefing. They are doing something that invites destruction, such as building a turret camp behind the white springs golf club.
---
It is really the FO4 carryover that is the issue. The weapon had certain tags in Fallout 4 that just weren't updated for 76's differing mechanics.
---
Even the Fallout 76 wikis just copied their Fallout 4 entries for The Broadsider. They are all inaccurate except Fandom's, which chose to give no information instead.
---
The reason no one really knows about this issue is because no one has even given earnest effort into using The Broadsider.
---
A heavy gunner picks it up, notices it does no damage (because it doesn't benefit from HG perks) and drops it.
---
An explosive character picks it up, sees it does decent damage, crafts 300 cannonballs, then notices they can't move. Drops it and the cannonballs.
---
I have yet to meet anyone who has given this weapon a good college try, because it's perk interactions are completely counter-intuitive.
---
Last night when I logged off I was the only one on my server. I'm on xb1. 
---
Nope. 
---
The legendary drops are rare and usually trash. Plus you only get one (if you're lucky) per Queen fight. 
---
She still drops basic ultracite plans, which are now useless. 
---
The xp gain is less than grinding a nuked whitesprings. 
---
She is huge bullet sponge and there is always the distinct possibility of failure. 
---
The limit is based on having many item ids rather than a "weight" limit. It's entirely artificial. A change in developer mentality towards the topic is the only thing that's going to fix this problem.
---
Be careful calling yourself a raider, you're likely to get swarmed by children calling you a griefer
---
I've had the same experiences, probably less than 5 times ever has someone tried to attack me. They all gave up though because slap damage doesn't get them anywhere.
---
They did increase damage. SPECIAL increased skills.
---
yea, i think you are right, it's just such a weird way for it to work, but once you add in multiplayer and duping, I suppose the changes make sense.
---
I agree with OP.
---
The watoga station suitcase has given me more loot than anything else in this game so far :) 
---
*slaps gut* "this baby can fit so many rads in it!"
---
This all day. I hate having to just drop so many legendaries because the vendors are out of caps and I dont have the space to store them.
---
I wish I was creative :(... I see so many cool camps in this game mine's literally just the workbenches and stash chest.
---
Most skilled/experienced people use mutations, and lots of them. I've got about 8 and I love every single one of them
---
Get lead belly,  don't eat rads ever again 
---
Another thought, this may be the only reason it's good that PA doesn't auto swap for the lowest charge core in your inventory.
---
False. The Bowler Hat does not count, there is another version simply called Bowler which does however.
---
but seriously don't get this mutation if you use an instigating melee cause it takes away health from the creature before you can hit it 
---
yep yep :)
---
I want this, but afraid it will get nerfed!
---
Make an offer
---
Get a ton for nuking mama dulces as well 
---
Well they didnt start on Thursdays, that just happened because people would ask on Tuesday and they kept saying "on itll be out in a day or so" too many times it stuck. Not like those have any information other than "We're fixing bugs &amp; working on new content we wont talk about in the next few months" as if thats sufficient communication
---
I've been seeing the requests, but I don't think that's a winning fight.
---
Bowler does, bowler hat does not, correct?
---
That's weird, thanks!
---
Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm.  Claim it, start up the food machine, make Salisbury Steaks.  
---
I‚Äôm running a PA+ Gatling Laser build, with Power User and Full Charge maxed. When I get down to 5 fusion cores I start looking or take a power plant, and when I get to 15 I stop picking them up. 
---
You absolutely do not need 70+ power cores. 
---
they seem to be on thursdays now just an fyi. They dont really have a set day or time.
---
Reddit has been caustic to anything post fo:nv.  Before 76 came out it was common to go negative karma on the fallout sub just taking a neutral stance on fo4.
---
As for community/social media impact, ME:A is kinda the poster child.  There was such a hate storm the game was dropped and devs shifted to other projects before fixes even started rolling out.  I only time will tell if this title recovers like fo:nv and fo3 did.  It honestly doesn't seem like they have many devs/qa working on it anymore.
---
I liked the atom store for what it was up until this.
---
So they are getting caught up in the GOSUB command. 
---
no one is asking the game math reason, they are asking why dogs would eat a cannon. 
---
Wouldn't surprise me. A lot of people seem to have this mentality that: "well I'm lying, but I'm lying for a good cause. I'm lying, but it's *plausible*, given all the people who play the game it's *probably* happened to *someone*, *somewhere*, at *some point* so it's not a *complete lie*.
---
Like their lies and exaggerations are fighting some greater fight for the common good.
---
What harder to find materials? You want flux then launch a nuke. Ballistic fiber is not that hard either. So what materials are you trying to find? I'm not saying you're wrong or that I disagree with the concept. Just that nothing is impossible to find.
---
Right? I got plague walker a long time ago. But have been using an instigating SS for a couple weeks now. Really need to go make myself all new Mutations but not that one 
---
Lol that amuses me. I‚Äôm quite ok with it.
---
The bag next to the workstation at the WS station is my drop off point. 
---
The suitcase inside the Watoga Station that you walk by to the vendor is another.
---
How about 
---
Early levels, like level 4, get a power armor chaise for 60 armor energy and rad res.  There are lots of spots just look them up online.
---
Learn where PA spawn, server hop and get armor pieces and power cores.
---
You can take the power plants and get lots of power cores
---
Build excavator PA with the now easy to find mods for +200 weight
---
Dont mod repair anything before 25-30 your just wasting mats, if your playing decently you will always be getting more wep then you need.
---
SCRAP all you can wep and armor wise early game, its how you learn mods.  It sucks to get late game and not know the hardened receiver mod for you legendary \*\*\*
---
Unless you expect to always be on a team, get 4 char and lone wanderer perk.
---
You can make all the healing items you need with a run down the river from the covered bridge by the overseers camp.  Pick up blood leaf and soot flowers with the Green Thumb perk and one run can net you 30-40 healing slaves.
---
You can pick up a Hazmat suit early (level 10) at the Poseidon energy plant on the roof.
---
 FAST money maker: Get a Hazmat suit server hop to a nuked whitesprings, pick up flux. With Green Thumb you can get 1400 caps worth in about 5 mins. Vendor run. WIN  
---
exe...exe...
---
Sorry it just aggravates me when people offer advice that you can learn on loading screens.
---
There‚Äôs a plan for a water pump that you can stick on the ground and get dirty water.  
---
It‚Äôs kinda slow but I have a routine of pumping water, collecting wood (my camp is near a decent wood source), boiling water and making soups to eat/drink and juices to sell. 
---
With Green Thumb and Super Duper, I never have to worry about hunger and thirst. 
---
ah, okay. I personally don‚Äôt enjoy a vats build. Doesn‚Äôt feel natural in that game since you can‚Äòt slow time. 
---
But combining both can work.
---
I didn‚Äôt need either before and used Demo Rifle Perks
---
I‚Äôm tired of collecting any explosive or energy ammo. The weapons are completely and totally nerfed beyond my level of interest and the fact that I‚Äôve played through to level 60 and have zero energy weapon plans or explosive weapon plans kind of exacerbates my point. 
---
Ended up spending 3000caps last night on plans just so i could sell enough stuff in my stash.  So many resources and not enough stuff to build with them.  I'm all for cap limits to cut back on farming, but bulking 50 different resources and only shaving down a few lbs is brutal.  Maybe if vendors returned 1/3 caps to into the store instead of 1/4 would strike more of a balance.
---
Both
---
Who has a full stomach when they come back from the dead? If you want logical they'd probably have to drain our food and thirst bars and remove all buffs from food/drink and chems and we'd probably be respawning with like boneworms and forced to reset at set locations like cemeteries. 
---
Flash ferns under the pine trees is another source of violet flux. Even with ¬Ω of the zone off the map I can reliably harvest 30 from a queen fight. 
---
As for the pitcher plants, I have a solid theory about how they work. They open automatically when you get close, like a defense mechanism. Here's a threat, spray the goop! The goop is your flux. I approach them directly, and am ready to harvest them before they spray, and I lose the flux.
---
I called this one achievement unlocked, because I think I have achieved perfection.

---
I have many hours into a level 59, 121 and 61 and I've had my based griefed exactly once. I killed the griefer and moved the sad, burning tatters of my home for around 20 caps and it was completely fixed. Also, since they fixed bobble-head stacking thing, I've never died in PVP that wasn't consensual. 
---
Remember, if you take workshops you are agreeing to consensual PVP. I look for owned workshops specifically to start a fight but I would never destroy someones base who just wants to PVE. Heck, if I take your workshop and you don't want to fight, I'll give it back and maybe actually give/craft something awesome for you. 
---
The endgame has two extremes; PVP and helping others. I'll probably do both every session.
---
I assure you the [Atomic Shop executive staff](https://i.imgur.com/f8pSfFv.jpg) have their finger on the pulse of the community.
---
No already existing structures that are there when you place down your camp do not count towards the limit if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking 
---
I got the good boy dog food Perk and those things give 37% hunger.  Plus near negligible levels of rads for that much food.  
---
Not sure why but I find the stuff everywhere.  Sitting on 30 cans right now. 
---
Yeah, having burst would be amazing
---
Best option would be to allow us to rename them.  Second best would be to show what was on them while they're still in inventory.
---
On that note Anthem, and The Division 2 are coming out soon. Both of which are the same genre as Fallout 76. There are options, no one is married to a single game.
---
&gt; It's the targeting HUD virus/glitch.
---
I searched for posts regarding this and the symptoms don't match - this is reported to cause game crashes / blue screen of death. This isn't what's happening to me.
---
Not to rule it out completely just saying my symptoms don't match the other reports.
---
Enclave still has the under armor plans. They're in the Production vendor, not the Armory.
---
Almost all armor mod plans are missing.
---
Does it require amputation of fingers to go half-handed? :)
---
I really wish we could do what New Vegas did.
---
Break them down so we can use them for other ammo.
---
Look here bud, thats now how things work around here. Embrace the bugs, live in them, let the hate build inside you... This is a Bethesda game and bugs fuel us! No but really I would like this fixed. Even some Skyrim day one bugs that still happen kill me slowly inside lol.
---
I‚Äôve got credit for events I was no where near and never entered / passed by.  Well out of range when they complete.  
---
Sometimes the game does big out your location vs event positions. 
---
Just an FYI, Flux stays around for quite a while after the nuke zone clears.  If you don't have a Hazmat Suit or WS isn't currently in a nuke zone, you should still check it out to see if there's flux.  Also, plants a little outside of a nuke zone will still be converted to flux.
---
It feels bad selling it to vendors(it feels worse drinking it cause you ran out of Purified/Boiled water), but boy is it lucrative.  Do try and sell to other players first, as they will often buy it for far more, especially Cobalt Flux.
---
I wish you can break down ammo, like in New Vegas.
---
Could use it to make other types.
---
must. have. track suit.
---
It's a rare spawn but I've had it a couple of times. Kinda funny and want expecting the first time and had a good laugh from them all just clanking around
---
Found the tree hugger! Lol good answer though.
---
Heck I'll bite.
---
  It's roughly 7% extra HP for what was a week, in a mostly PvE game, and when not in PA.  Yeah it stacked, however the HP is meaningless compared to the advantages of teamwork.
---
Yeah, but a crashes happen pretty rarely for me. I've never had a pvp interaction at a workshop so I wouldn't know. I mean the workshops have free fast travel so it's not that many caps. Violet and Cobalt flux are the two that are somewhat hard to come by, so I'd prioritize them over more fusion cores imo.
---
What is your connection speed?  Are you using a regular PS4 or Pro?
---
You dont need details. Its the same exact fucking bug your dev team should be the experts on this especially if theyre enjoying lavish Bethesda dev perks.
---
Lone-wanderer perks is all I use.
---
Maybe even events that can harm other players.
---
\-- Raider Event: Sky Germs (or something)
---
The Raiders have gotten ahold of a biological weapon. Launch it on a certain area to give everyone in the vicinity some disease (Rad Worms, Parasites, w/e). Have the area the disease infects grow over time because diseases spread. Make this one time consuming to do so it's not easy.
---
Counter-event: Clearing the air
---
The Raiders have released a biological weapon in the air. Build air purifiers to clean up the mess and (optionally) find the Raider(s) responsible and put them down. Have no set timer for this event and have it involve the entire server (besides the player who did the Raider event and their team, if they're on one.) Have a note that this event /might/ mean you have to engage in PvP. The player who set off the bioweapon might have hung around in the area to pick off people trying to build purifiers.
---
And events in response to other events.
---
\-- Brotherhood Event: Bringing the Pain
---
The Enclave released a bunch of bots to survey an area. Prevent them from getting the info they need by wiping out the bots. Optional: Destroy the Bot Stop the bots came from to prevent the Enclave event Bots on Parade from respawning at that Bot Stop on that server for two hours. 
---
&gt; There‚Äôs a plan for a water pump that you can stick on the ground and get dirty water. 
---
That's even worse though. Assuming you want to get 40 water to make 20 soup you can either spend ages pumping the water or use the drink-&gt;collect trick to get it in a few seconds along with a couple of diseases.
---
Then of course making the soup costs 20 wood which is ~8 logs you need to pick up.
---
I mean none of this is "hard" but I play games to have fun not to pump water or collect firewood - I can go outside and do that stuff.
---
Yeah, straight jackets sell for 43 caps each, so 4 per vendor.
---
The day after the last player uninstalls, a patch will finally drop that fixes all bugs
---
Strength:  Incisor and Martial Artist.  Three points left for three one point level weapon buffs OR Blocker if running low health build. 
---
Perception:  Three points for one-pt rifleman OR commando OR 3 point skeetshooter.   One point concentrated fire.   Three points Tank Killler.  2 points Night Eyes.   
---
Endurance:   3 points Fireproof. 1 point Radicool (swap if not doing low health build).  3 points Iron Stomach.  1 point Aqua Boy.  
---
Charisma:   4 points Lonewander (especially if doing low health build)
---
Intelligence:  Six points allow swapping of any 5+1 or 3+3 combo.   I normally run 3 Nerd Rage plus 3 Demo Expert or 3 Stabilized.  
---
Agility:   Swap the points as necessary for the current build.   I normally run 3 Sneak, 1 Light Footed, 1 Escape Artist, 1 Adrenaline, and then a swappable 3 point block of Enforcer or White Knight ‚Äîbut could use Ninja when playing Stealth or Dodgy when doing low health. 
---
Luck:   3 Class Freak, 2 Starched Genes.  Two swappable three point blocks which vary by play style:  Serendipity plus Bloodied if low health; One Gun Army + X if heavy; Tormentor + X if rifle; Two three point crit enhancers if playing crit/vats.   
---
I see the projection, but regardless of how many times someone reads that post it's still baby's first rubber barbed wire bracelet.
---
Read it yourself. You even have your own internal struggle narrated at the end.
---
Super cute.
---
Yes!  I always dump extra ammo into random containers at train stations, along with any kind of "food/eatables" that gives you a buff, water, etc.  
---
I also got a melee legendary from one once..which was far better than what I was using so I was happy!
---
I use workshops primarily for fast travelling to specific regions. If there's a water source there, all the better. I'll pop in purifiers so I can sell it. A lot of times I also won't even bother to defend one because you have to run all over creation trying to find where the next wave is spawning from. It's much easier to just finish whatever it is I'm doing, allow the workshop to be overrun, and then go back to reclaim it once all of the enemies are centralized around the bench area.
---
Why give them extra money?  You get a pretty consistent intake of atoms just playing.  
---
You have to touch the orange bridge to trigger the spawn. I think he's rarer than the traveling responder bot because I've only seen him spawn once and I've seen the bot spawn 3 times. 
---
Yep, I am one of those players that quit before all the stuff was fixed, simply put I didn't like the state of the game. I didn't care that they fixed it 6 months later, I had moved on and had no intention of returning to it.
---
I have a *** bloodied grognaks axe. Still looking?
---
I personally have both those equipped at all times, the sad thing is, if you‚Äôre not a mutant or into rifles there just isn‚Äôt many perk cards really worth investing in either skill line. I really wish they added more passive perk cards to both, such as perception perk that would highlight flora/dead enemies or a luck perk that actually increases the quality of your loot drops/ammo from dead enemies. 
---
I'm sorry. Wrong person
---
There is no real concentration of cash registers outside of Whitespring, but each named location (in urbanized areas) will have at least 2-3. But there will often be a safe nearby that is also loaded with pre-war money. Also always look behind the counters that the cash registers are sitting on. You might easily end up with 200 cloth in a single game play.
---
Ah yes, The Bullet King farm. RIP sweet prince. I remember farming him for hours for that sweet yellow loot. Then he got removed from the game
---
I killed a lvl 17 yesterday with slap damage. Took me at least 50 swings with my 3 star grognaks axe. Getting your camp wrecked might seem bad, but mine keeps getting terrorized by scorchbeasts. I just stand there getting killed swinging my axe.
---
I got 99 problems but the SBQ aint one.
---
It‚Äôs a suggestion. Lower levels can‚Äôt do anything with level 30 to 50 legendary items and you can only store so much. Sure you could sell stuff but at a lower level you haven‚Äôt been everywhere. Your own private vendor would be cool just drop off all your legendary items if they sell great!
---
thank you!
---
Yeah, that is only if they are all out of PA.  I don't get how.that extra HP will offset the DR/ER/Rad loss.
---
But wouldn't you need a teammate to cosplay as a little girl to accompany you?
---
It's pretty decent for team play and also for event rewards.  Saw a video lately what says it also effects the legendary Loot u get, scaling with something called "seeded Loot ID"
---
Private vendors are in the works allegedly.
---
The VATs targeting same body part isn't an issue. It's what we wanted to compensate for no slow down. If that would have been in for release it would have been better tho
---
The fact the game is pushing more and more that everyone has to play the same meta or be worthless is getting annoying
---
How is that explosives build working out for yah
---
I debated 7x7 vs 5x5 but was worried I'd hit the height cap at 7x7... did it work out for you? 
---
People can engage PVP freely with you if they don't fully capture your workshop from what I understand. People will actually start capturing your workshop, and their teammate who's come and found you can instantly PVP you. Lots of people have gotten jumped like that. I don't want to get jumped while I'm doing other things like harvesting oil/springs/plastic. Some people are just so desperate to "beat" someone that they're like a little dog running around rubbing the lipstick tube on your leg. 
---
I don't have any trouble finding violet flux though. Pitcher plants, Half-Life hips, and flash ferns around prime are all violet. If you find a good source of Cobalt that isn't the whitespring let me know lol.
---
Absolutely not worth it once you've done it a couple times. The reward is awful compared to the time you spend gathering mats for weapon and armor repairs. On top of that, she bugs out/you disconnect around a third of the time.
---
Not feelin it chief.
---
Don‚Äôt be naive....it was duped all to shit. You are just not in the right market to find them. If the truth makes me an idiot, then so be it...i am the one laughing in the end. 
---
Yup I know. Should be interesting.
---
It's not much help in the sustainability department, but one always spawns on the north side of Grafton inside the bus with the tinker's workbench in it, so make sure you check there whenever you pass through Grafton.
---
The most popular seem to be low health builds that capitalize on stacking Unyielding armor, Bloodied weapons, the Adrenal Reaction mutation, and the Nerd Rage perk. Damage, especially with melee weapons because of the Unyielding STR bonus, gets absurd fast.
---
Some good points I don‚Äôt disagree with..
---
Just cap a power station workshop after doing the restart the plant thing. they literally spawn them like hot cakes.
---
It happens from time to time haha. Wish this still happened with feed the people.
---
I play mon-wed all day and night my power is out right now but add me I‚Äôm level 86 or something Toxic_sunshine22
---
I'm glad you enjoy it, however I often shoot at different body parts and it would be much more useful to have a set starting point to go from. So, it's what you wanted maybe, but not I. A way to switch between these 2 options would be fine with me.
---
Also, what's "no slow down"?
---
Yeah, go pester all the new players.... Damn, you're a tool.
---
 You can pick up a Hazmat suit early (level 10) at the Poseidon energy plant on the roof.
---
Farm Straight jackets, golf outfits, etc... anything with a high cap to low weight ratio.
---
Also, find a spot with mole miners and sell off the combat rifles and shotguns, those fetch a really good price. 
---
Pharma Farma is very lucrative to sell off what you don't need. Or if you have the plans, super duper &amp; chemist perks, you can make chems to sell as well. 
---
Junk that is not bulkable can be sold for at least 1 cap per item, I use asbestos from cigarette packs as vendor fodder. Gold and silver scrap can be sold as well since it's not a commonly used item.
---
What is really weird to say the least, how can someone make melee the best thing in game when its mindless and boring to play as melee in most FPS games? Only game that kinda do melee right is Kingdom Come. Here in fallout you just charge (or get charged, most enemies will run at you) and hit the button to one hit enemies at melee. No aim, nothing.
---
TSE guns were the only viable guns in game. They ruined them because of stupid pvp crap that no one cares about. I just want to be able to use a gun in this game thats a First Person SHOOTER.
---
are you using first Aid? it makes them 45% more efficient. pair it with chemist and dilute them for a good efficiency increase.
---
What about the kind of flux from raydodendrons?
---
Get rid of turrets, they eat budget.
---
Patch 6: Removed a bug that allowed low charge fusion cores to be crafted into fully charged ultracite fusion cores 
---
Dev Note: this was found to be to reasonable and decreased the unnecessary and tedious grind. Sorry about that please go back to doing your fo76 chores.
---
Because it's an artificial dichotomy you've invented to help you pick a side to play victim to, cutie.
---
Acid is my problem. I can pickup enough iron and lead ore in 5 minutes to make 5,000 rounds of .50 or 5.56. Finding enough acid to facilitate that takes a lot longer. My camp is on an acid node and I usually take a workshop which helps.
---
They can turn on pacifist, anyone who uses a single brain cell will know there will be raiders, you're such a whiny kid.
---
There's some great suggestions in the comments, so I'm not going to repeat them.  Just make sure you have hard bargain perk equipped and pop a grape mentat before you hit the robo vendors or Graham. That way you're selling less of your inventory for more caps.
---
oh yeah I forgot to put 3 dots to look smart, but hopefully you get the point.
---
I expect that the tactic will get fixed but I assume they'll allow current builds to stay as-is... you just can't use the tactic at workshops anymore. Either way, I'm actually ok with rebuilding this with regular walls too, you get a lot more room inside. 
---
I could live with this.
---
I depends on what kind of play style you have. Basically, you want to max out all perks that increase your damage, then things that improve your weapon, and then things that compliment your playstyle. 
---
For example:
---
As a stealth commando you would max out the commando perks, and then put things into points like tank killer and concentrated fire. Then you‚Äôd put in the stealth and Crit perks, and you finish it off with quality of life perks.
---
Perks are not the main part of a build thought. Sure, they are really powerful in fo76, but you need good legendary roles on you weapons and armor to be very good. As a stealth commando you‚Äôd use Bloodied Crit damage automatic handmade, with unyielding armor.
---
One thing you are ignoring is what time of day you are playing. The fact that you have 300+ hours means you are playing a lot; so, you must not be playing all of your game hours at the same time as OP. OP specifically stated that he has a job and a life. I infer this to mean that he plays for an hour or two a day after his kids go to bed.
---
It is self-centered to assume that your play experience is exactly equivalent to OP's. How do you know what kind of other players are online at exactly the same time and on exactly the same platform as he is? How do you know that those players behave exactly the same as players who are online with you when you play on your platform? Maybe the times OP is online are in fact the same times that the majority of griefers come out to grief? Did you consider these things among all your sanctimonious, "If I don't experience it, it doesn't happen," assumptions?
---
Thus is very cool, thanks for sharing. üòä
---
So that's primarily for melee but isn't there a build for guns too ( or was that nerfed) How do they keep their health so low?
---
What system are you on? 
---
&gt; Do you think there should be a way to charge fusion cores?  
---
If nothing else is changed... no. There are plenty of fusion cores available in the world and they last a very long time.
---
&gt; I have 78 fusion cores
---
You got problems. I start chucking them on the ground when have over 10. That's enough to play for several hours even assuming I find no new ones.
---
Sent!
---
ps4
---
I would also add that PvP makes absolutely no sense in the context of the story we are given in the game. We are all vault dwellers from 76, we all grew up together, in harmony and peace with our neighbours. Leave the vault and everyone is now killing in each other instead of the main mission to rebuild? Wut?
---
Click on Community Options at the bottom of the Community Details box (upper right). You can add flair.
---
Yes stims are chems and they do dehydrate you.
---
At the moment, the number one build is bloody melee. Adrenal Reaction, Twisted Muscles for mutations, Nerd Rage, Radicool, Overly Generous, all 1h or 2h melee damage perks, a Bloody melee weapon, and a full set of Unyielding gear
---
went into a nuke zone in whitesprings last night, with friends, and was up by the row of houses, i am lvl 197 i asked those with me to hold off for a second i had a full health lvl 68 glowing one. i used my two shot (not explosive) level 45 semi automatic handmade, using the 35 round piercing magazine, i had 3 star master rifleman and expert rifleman, tenderizer, tank killer, 1 star bloody mess, doing 98 dmg (range 174, accuracy 105).  
---
they watched as a face tanked this ghoul, i hip fired slowly paying attention so as to actually hit my target, every shot was center mass, heart/lung area, or face/head shots.. i used a clip and 1/3 maybe 1/2 of another clip to kill this thing. So, almost 50 rounds of ammo (5.56) to the chest and face of this thing to kill it. (at/in melee range)  
---
now I am no Nick Valentine, CSI, or Doctor, but I am sorry 10/20/30/40 shots to face, head, heart and still attacking me?   
---
yall need to watch some Sons of Guns or something, or maybe take a trip to Vegas to the place there you can rent any gun ya want and actually shoot some of these weapons you are programming, put up a ballistic gel body and see what a .50 cal, ak47 (assumin thats the basis of a handmade) can do to a body especially at close range can do. 
---
cmon, everyones seen Zombieland... double tap to the head..
---
seriously. 
---
&gt; the order that they're used in
---
For what it's worth my preferred QoL change for fusion cores would be to load the lowest CND core. This would make the cores we do carry more efficient.
---
Meh. I do queens because they're the only thing in the game that's mildly challenging. For what it's worth, the rewards are a couple of legendaries that are sometimes good, four random stable flux, six super stimpaks, a prime receiver plan that you haven't learnt and sometimes an Ultracite plan that isn't garbage.
---
If you need a specific prime receiver then they are eventually a reliable way to get that. They used to be the quickest way of acquiring flux, but probably not since the TSE nerf.
---
So I had fever claw disease yesterday and it said the active effect was -25% from ranged weapons. However I didn‚Äôt lose 25% from ranged I lost 25% from Melee damage. Maybe that could be it ?
---
Must be lv32 with black hammer and gjallarhorn
---
Where can we source that info? Is that is true it is amazing news for the community.
---
they should just remove all weapons and make the game hand to hand only tbh. what kind of post apocalyptic world has guns littered all over the place? my immersion is instantly ruined whenever I load the game 
---
Try perks like adrenaline if you really want dps, it's awesome especially at the queen. It works with everything. There's perks to get around armor but you have to craft a build to the gun. I'm switching cards all the time. One thing that's really annoying is not being able to save loadouts.
---
Had to reply because there's a lot of stuff I know isn't true, but stated fact. It's kind of like the fake news. We all went through the grind at the beginning too. Pistols (I think) are meant to fall off as you get to 50. Only the devs know why there's no armor piercing perk card.
---
Can't really comment on energy guns cause I'm grounded, been grounded since starched genes. My friend uses a gauss and likes it though. We even did speed run through the silo when the patch came out, surprised how little it changed.
---
 I think maybe fallout was a single player base that liked to console cheat (maybe) xD I dunno, but it seems that a lot of people like the idea of invulnerability god mode. Just my opinion!
---
Meanwhile a dude with an old board can one hit super mutants in armor. Game is balanced!
---
The only moment guns were viable in this game was during TSE pre nerf. Now its shit fest again.
---
Keep it real. LOL. I've never used VATS just because of this very point.
---
 I have 400+ and I live in the game, not fight with it, not dominate it and just play. I have done my grinding and have 2 decent chars. The one I have now, has quit fast traveling and this is working very well indeed.
---
In Fallout 3, NV, and 4, time slowed down when you entered vats. As time went on the slow-mo effect got nerfed over the games. In FO3 it felt like enemies hardly moved
---
I always had a feeling that fo76 devs created smokescreens to hide real problems. The convenient portable fuel tank pa dupe, the mega camp multiple door glitch, the items in artillary dupe, the crafting boards dupe... I feel that the disconnect problem has always been there but other problems were created specifically to distract attention.
---
Fallout 4 had much better weapon balancing than this game. Survival more on that game really made it nice. Enemies took just a few shots to die. So did the player character but that made it even more fun. My God I miss falliout 4 survival. 
---
That's half the problem the rest is standing still and still loosing so much water haha
---
how is it easier to kill deathclaws than crickets? are you just missing them because they're agile? I've never had a single issue killing them.
---
You can trade your ammo to other players for caps or different ammo. I'm up to ~50,000 5.56 ammo because I trade other stuff my the thousands.
---
Sorry there's nothing to be done about missiles, just toss them.
---
Yes, servers have fewer players for sure. I am finding more Legendary bosses because not everything has been farmed. I am finding new people to play with on PS4. Seems us, die-hard players are helping each other out more and more.
---
If you need someone to do stuff with add me on PSN: R-C-MAN
---
Yep, a recent development.
---
Damn man, sounds like you really spent a lot of time thinking about that. The comparison had nothing to do with the actual weights of things, or the corresponding specials that perks coincide with. I don't actually care about any of that. The comparison was that there are weapons in this game that require unique perk load outs to optimize. Did you ever stop and think that you could run Ordinance Express AND Bandolier?! But you don't want to do that do you? Did you ever stop and think that otherwise, you weren't intended to run around with 300 cannonballs, 300 grenades and 40mm rounds, 20 mini nukes, and whatever the fuck else you might be carrying? Am I displaying enough Contrarianism for you yet? The point is, there is nothing inherently wrong with the current setup, you just don't like it. Don't pretend it's a valid complaint when there are actually things wrong with the game, and weapons on the game. You don't like it, and don't wanna do the things you'd have to do to optimize the weapon, so you want it changed. This is called snowflakeism.
---
the radworms bug only happens if you log in with radworms and cure it, a relog should fix the issue though. I've only run into that bug once.
---
&gt; there is plenty of other side quests/exploring to do
---
I think you'll find a lot of people would disagree with you on this. If you're focusing on these two things, you run out pretty quickly.
---
&gt; Also it is called a god roll for a reason, if they werent super rare everyone would have them. 
---
Except, thanks to a duping bug, way more people have them than should. They aren't super rare, so the game is having to be balanced around lasting effects of people exploiting a bug after launch. Oops.
---
&gt; You dont need some ultimate weapon to just play the game and enjoy it.
---
Agree here. Played through to end-game with weapons I crafted/received from quests. Now, if I was doing more PvP, I might think differently as the duped TSEs would give a seriously unfair advantage, but that's a whole other issue.
---
I hate people like you. You're under level 50, and show up to SBQ fights. Have fun with your slap damage and free endgame loot from the people who csn kill it.
---
Some classic Gamer nazi roleplay. 
---
So all effects to weapons/armor etc... catered for the player to have a low health to be effective?
---
Idk what's wrong with my format but I posted basically the same thing 5 times and all I get is down votes and definitely not any response from Bethesda.
---
But yes Guns are severely under powered. 
---
My Alts name is Dickbutt...
---
Step 1: Get a full team of friends
---
Step 2: Smash a camp or workshop to get a huge bounty
---
Step 3: Lure other players in with bounty and have friends waiting nearby to kill them when they attack you
---
Step 4: Repeat
---
Step 5: Profit
---
My squad has easily made about 10k each this way
---
Yeah I don't know why anyone complained whatsoever about bulk items not being scrapped for mats.
---
I am, how much are you selling for?
---
I feel you are wrong.
---
And the whole world is like a fucking restaurant, it's full of food and beverages. Just pick the ones you like and enjoy.
---
Make some friends, they don't even have to be real friends just random people or people you traded stuff with.
---
Ctrl+Tab -&gt; Join.
---
Lmao okay bud I am in every market. I know what was duped and what was not, yes melee weapons and aid and stuff were duped. You are just mad your TSE got nerfed and think that everything everyone has was duped. Surprise! Some of us actually work for our stuff, how are you gonna tell me my armor is duped when I farmed for most of it? 
---
Well they released two last week out of the norm because well...
---
LOL. You are super serial eh'. ;)
---
 I don't like Fortnite and want no part of it in the game I play.
---
Vats critical build using sneak is the only thing that even come close to melee. And you can tank alot at low health with the right perks.
---
I always dump on ice machine at golf club. I don't think anyone actually uses those but maybe some new level50 could gear up for cheap and a bit useful stuff for a short while.
---
&gt; As it stands though, I don't feel the game is very grind heavy at all. Sure if you want top tier shit, yeah, its grind heavy, as any game SHOULD be, but everything else is far from being grindy. But any easier and I feel things would be too easy.
---
The problem here is that you run out of the "everything else" fairly quickly if you concentrate on it, so grinding is pretty much all you have left. And to that point, progressive grinding (where you obtain part of what you need) is far preferable to all-or-nothing grinding (like we have). If, at the end of a session, you can see you're closer to your goal, that gives you some sense of reward for the work you put in. Unfortunately, with the current mechanics, I could grind for days on end and be no closer than when I started. I think that's where a lot of the frustration comes in.
---
Never left. Haven‚Äôt been able to play my stealth crit build in months because of it.
---
I almost cried post TSE nerf when I saw my 50 cal. One of the best parts of my game session was doing that event "AWOL armaments". I would climb in the truck, put my power armor and unload the 50 cal on gutsys. It was fun and it felt like a real weapon that you put over a truck. After the patch I went there, took a full clip to take half HP of ONE gutsy. They gutted the game. I barely log in now, don't give a crap about pvp. I just want to do my pve and feel like guns are actually guns, not NERF toy guns.
---
Meanwhile, a dude with a piece of wood can one hit pretty much everything.
---
Bullshit. Stop lying. I craft hundreds of items per session at multiple work benches. Food , ammo,etc. 
---
Xbox 1 here and I'm not banned.
---
Tired of banned dupers spreading this lie.
---
Anecdotal, yes, but it did happen. So maybe it wasn‚Äôt supposed to
---
Just looked at the picture and my eye literally let out a tear of happiness, gonna try to build this later

Theme this week is "Rest and relaxation", Well Rested bonus lasts 50% longer. New items include:
---
- Vault-Tec University Track Suit (which is the first under-armor on the shop), Black Sunglasses, Tropical Suits, Hunting Caps
---
- Red Rocket Bed, Pickaxe Pilsner neon sign, Dart board
---
- Dancer photo mode pose, Cheers! icon (two Nuka Colas clinking)
---
TL/DR 
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt forget the fact that everyone needs to boost strength over the top to begin with just to manage carry weight, and that stregnth increase means melee damage increase, an equivalent which does not happen with a perception/agility/luck build for ranged. 
---
Yes, exactly.  What reason is there to even attempt making a  rifleman or a pistols build?
---
You HAVE TO max out strength to manage carry weight. So if you do that, then you might as well just sink points into melee,  shot guns  or heavy guns (all perks are in strength tree).
---
I have strength maxed out, which means I can switch between shot guns, melee and heavy guns. 
---
Does maxing out any other category allow you to swamp out perks for three different categories? Not that I know of.
---
ahh thank you for the clarification.
---
Hahaha!! I thought the same!
---
99% of legendaries are crap. This game has turned legendaries into a loot grind, not cool rewards sadly. 
---
The concrete foundations are indestructible? Could make a base with those thick walls, no need for turrents except the entrance. Opens up a lot of possibilities
---
&gt; You and Bethesda management are on the same page there. I wonder how that's working out for them.
---
Not well, but I'm not sure the alternative would be better. Once you get your dream armor and weapons, what motivation is there to stick around? You've kinda done it all.
---
Next hint, please!
---
This dude plays minecraft 
---
I am sure they know already, but I will say just in case; The hat can spawn at Freddy Fear's House of Scares, in the north east of the map directly east of the Route 66 sign in the map, and also North Mountain Lookout, which is almost directly west of the Red Rocket Mega Stop.
---
What/Whom did you sacrifice to Todd Howard to get it?
---
So half full, not empty.
---
Why do people exaggerate so much?

This post?

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every_weapon_mods_learn_chance/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
All armor mods have the same learn chance, and it's not translated from code base, but it's there. Combat armor only goes to material 3, which I believe is polymer.
---
I find a few at west tek but no their drops aren‚Äôt better they‚Äôre all the same I think 
---
Some plans are still RNG, but so far they seem to have equal chances- case in point harper‚Äôs ferry. You‚Äôll get 1 plan from either sturdy or heavy armor there, per ‚Äúreset‚Äù, but they all seem to appear pretty equal. I completed sturdy/heavy combat armor not even really trying to within hours of the patch (different characters/non-deliberate server hoping)
---
Sort of... except without using the campfire bug/feature you can't build more than 1 high and all the foundations have an invisible ramp on the sides that let you walk up 1 level without stairs. 
---
I had the same once and like some others said they were nearly all legendary. Got half my current gear in that one run. Made me dizzy trying to use VATS in a hoard of those jumping commies.
---
Haha I was typing quickly on mobile.   There are multiple typos.  Oops. 
---
That's how it starts.....
---
Damn 900 hours , people need to listen to more people like you. It‚Äôs people that have dedicated countless hours to this game and leaving that are the ones really being hurt.
---
I would say screws and springs along with the already there steel and wood. 
---
Use the perks to make food and drinks last longer, really makes life easier. Same with the cards for reducing weights of chems, food, drinks, ammo and junk.  
---
You don't even need to use a disease cure. As I mentioned above.  
---
Buffout caused the problem, not the Disease Cure.
---
oh i didn't know it did anything like that.
---
Bowler (to not be confused with Bowler Hat. It's simply titled Bowler)
---
Crumpled/Battered Fedora
---
Silver Shroud's Fedora
---
Formal Tuxedo Hat 
---
I think I forgot one or two more
---
You don't even need to use a Disease cure. Using buffout caused the same effect.
---
Dodgy and Serendipity are the two most op damage reduction perks. Blocker is up there as well, Lone Wanderer is also good if solo.
---
when you learn them they are gone right? only extra ones you would keep (of same plan)
---
I jump up at a vendor counter or on a public work bench and drop the stuff there.  It leaves a bag right on the counter and can't be missed.  :-)
---
The above swappability let‚Äôs me play PA+Heavy, Sneak+Rifle, Sneak+Melee, Melee+Shotgun, or low-health build, as mood changes.  
---
It sounds like you just don‚Äôt like fo76; what you‚Äôre describing is a completely different game.  So, maybe you should play something else.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt play or enjoy fo76, but your suggestions are just not likely to make it into the game, and in several cases would reduce the range of viable builds and weapons, making the game more boring.  So what I am saying is, if those are your criteria for enjoyment, you‚Äôll continue to be disappointed, so maybe this game just isn‚Äôt for you.
---
I totally agree with you about scorchbeasts. The bullet sponge aspect and low rewards of killing them are so demoralizing. Also the screen spam that literally blinds you is obnoxious, poor game design. I‚Äôm not unreasonable, I want a fun game just like you people.
---
If you had the entrance with a garage door/powered door. This would be legit AF
---
(1) Teleport to Whitesprings resort
---
(2) Kill Sentry Bot
---
(3) Gain 700xp
---
(4) Loot Fusion Core (100% chance)
---
(5) Win
---
Make an offer. I swear I'm reasonable. Lol
---
oh i didn't know it did anything like that thank you for educating me.
---
You sure it isn't a she? I mean there are tons of eggs to harvest.
---
Take me under your wing grandma, I‚Äôm 76+ hours in and only level 35 as I‚Äôm scared of everything. 
---
But seriously, this was a helpful joy to read! I‚Äôm also particular to some .45 so this was definitely good for me.
---
Facts &gt; Feels, my guy
---
I‚Äôd get pretty hungry if I ran around carrying 200 pounds of stuff in my pocket 
---
Ya I‚Äôm not running any mutations or drugs.    Didn‚Äôt change my build at all.   Seems like lots of people are having this issue.  
---
Bloodied makes you do more damage the lower your health so you infect yourself with radiation to push your health down to 25%
---
My own soul...
---
The mosaic tiles are atom shop items and you cant build any atom shop items in anyone's camp but your own. 
---
Yeah, I know.  It makes it really hard to watch your weight when you're in your 40s and your appetite hasn't slowed down but your metabolism has.  It's like no matter what I do, I...oh, you meant in the game.  Sorry.
---
I like being able to run around whitespring without being attacked by infinite robots, or dying so they stop. You do you, but picking up a 50% fusion core and hassling with whitespring bots isn't my idea of a good time.
---
I am surprised my friend hasn't stopped playing after this happened to him twice. 
---
This is amazing. Only camp perks active, works with locally sourced scrap from only the finest scrappers in the region to provide you quality post-Armageddon luxury at the best price!
---
I use them all. I'll probably collect serums until I get exactly which ones I want but I'm happy with all of them at the moment.
---
Try this:
---
(6) Quit to main menu 
---
(7) Login 
---
It seems to me like before I would try to get the same server and never did now I try to find a new one and get the same one xD 
---
Is that true? I've built on friends' camps, but never anything from the atom shop now that you mention it.
---
Raydodendrons used to give fluorescent flux and as far as I know they still do. Yours Might have been a glitch though as I‚Äôve seen non nuked flora give the nuked mats. 
---
Yeah. I see people's inventories, running around with 6 guns and thousands of rounds of ammo and 50 stimpaks and 30 rad-away and any given time... like, no wonder people struggle with stash storage and carry weight perks. The amount of excess stuff people carry around is just obscene.
---
Granny Tip: When on my Ammo Run if I don't find .45 in it I don't loot it - I server hop or come back later for better RNG
---
super duper is after level 50 right? i need to get this
---
Yes , and it stacked.
---
First, I think most fallout players would prefer a game with npcs. If theres a demand for human/ghoul npcs (and I think there is), I think sooner or later they will add them. 
---
For those who prefer a game without npcs, they could create an option to continue the game as it is now.
---
I think it would be a massive win for them to appeal to both publics. :)
---
Oooo! More loading screens.
---
Right?! I think this could be a thing. I'd want this service.
---
&gt;I've lived in rural areas with wild animals around.  
---
&gt;They don't just show up one day and start tearing up your generator.  
---
&gt;YES! this made me laugh. Too true. Some fucking dog just pawing at your water purifier.
---
Thanks for those who didn't know :)
---
This idea is superb! I only want to point out that the game won't let you place your atomic shop items in someone else's camp IRC
---
But still, neat thought
---
I'm probably not in the norm but I feel like I'm leveling up too fast.  Like I'll go around for a couple days hoarding junk to make new weapons and armor because I'm at a higher level than my gear and by the time I'm done getting everything built it's almost time to upgrade everything again.  
---
Ha! I hope so. What are all of the stats on it?
---
Hmm, somewhat mediocre this week
---
About the Track-Suit, IIRC the Cappy Shirt and Jeans is underarmor, but it has no mods whatsoever (which is what you expect considering they said no P2W items), so the statement about the Vault-Tec Tracksuit being the first underarmor is false 
---
But either way, thanks for the info!
---
Running out of content is a different issue than the game being grindy.
---
I actually got nothing from the fight because I joined so late and didn't hit the queen because I'm melee build and she wouldn't come down. Instead I killed the other enemies and revived down players in a support role. But you can hate me I'm not losing sleep. 
---
Straight-Jackets have the same value too.
---
That‚Äôs what I was referring to yes
---
i also usually keep my characters food/water gauge at 100% most of the time
---
A single 52 Gutsy would be able to take over the world with this change. That pistol is nuts already.
---
Highest I've ever gone is 117 charge on an Ultracite FC.
---
that makes even less sense.... dogs feel threat from a cannon?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
I will admit, you got me right up until the /s.
---
That's the scuttlebutt. Stormy pointed that out, ruining my dreams of a mosaic tile downstairs area. :)
---
My bad :)
---
Says guy recycling loading screens by fast traveling to stash and crafting stations, to use valuable crafting materials to craft a ubiquitous and freely obtainable item, and taking 5-10 minutes.  
---
But I don't want to eat guns
---
40 percent faster swing speed. 
---
Does more damage the lower your health is
---
+1 agility
---
I've played runescape for a decade because of the grind. I kind of like it.
---
So you search the corpse and nothing pops up, and you don‚Äôt get the perk icon/animation? I‚Äôve had it where you initiate the search, nothing pops up and then 10 seconds later the animation plays and the extra blood/meat is there. 
---
Yeah, that's the best build. They also use a perk called Serendipity that allows them to avoid damage 45% of the time.
---
I only know of two effective builds at the moment, the other being Explosive Shotgunner. Though it doesn't have the same incredible DPS it recently got nerfed and will stay effective because of Enforcer. The preferred build for a Shotgunner would be the Marsupial Mutation, all shotgun perks plus fireproof and demolition expert, an explosive shotgun, and then a Dense mod for your chest piece
---
There are other builds, have heard of at least two similarly dedicated set ups for both vats crit rifles and fast dps heavy weapons. There's also Unarmed but that's basically the same as bloody melee. If you find anything on these let me know
---
Some people set up berserker builds as well for going into nuke zones without power armor. A set up like this wouldn't work all of the time, I've tried it. It seems okay but Explosive Shotgunner or Bloody Melee is better
---
They said that was one of the things that got fixed in this patch. But sort of unsure if that is the case. For now I'll take their word for it, unless someone proves this is still a thing.
---
Let me remind you of what you said above:
---
&gt; I thought maybe it was a Radworm/Buffout interaction, so I removed the Radworms, ...
---
&gt; so I removed the Radworms
---
Let me relate that to what I posted:
---
&gt; If you use a Disease Cure now they're all nullified (?). Same if they "naturally" go away. The only fix is to relog. This sucks.
---
Let me rephrase that to make that easier for you to follow:
---
&gt; If you remove radworms then mutations don't work anymore. The only fix is to relog.
---
Let me relate the rephrased version to what you said:
---
As you mentioned above, you removed radworms and your mutations were jacked up. As I posted, if you remove radworms your mutations are jacked up.
---
Let me know if you have any further questions.
---
Lol. I don't fast travel anywhere to do it, but like I said. You do you. I'm not here to scream in the dark about how my way is the only way. üôÑ
---
Point being most problems arent with the game itself. Many people rush through the story and dont play side quests then complain. But yes the TSE duped weapons are causing an imbalance in the game causing it to feel ‚Äúgrindy‚Äù and pretty much broke PvP. If the duplication bug never existed we probably wouldnt be having this conversation.
---
I thought they nerfed 2h melee! My fire axe feels weaker too.
---
That's a very good question. There have been reports of vendors not all carrying the same plans, which means it's very possible that if one player in the server buys it, nobody else can until they restock. 
---
Check your pip boy under stats&gt;special and see what your charisma is listed at. When you are on your perk loadout screen will represent the "base" stats but you need to check to see if you have any diseases/chems/mutations/food/drink buffs \[or debuffs\] that is lowering your Charisma to something below 6. I know "The Blight" \[disease\] reduces all special stats by 1, and there seems to be a bug where if you relog it will refresh the duration instead of normally counting down.
---
Consider this. The higher your CHR, the better drops you get from events. I might suggest creating a max CHR decked in Unyielding designed for event farming via group play. Given the massive deflation in caps combined with the fact that event apparel drops are some of the most sought after items in the game given the rarity, I‚Äôd say high CHR will always be valued high even after these rare cosmetics become less rare.
---
Personally I‚Äôve got a damage build toon for pvp and nonsense, then I‚Äôve got a crafter/farmer build toon to gather and produce. As if a couple days ago I am raising my team medic/event farm build toon. Best way to play imo, keeps you from dashing your special stats and perk loadout balance. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how you expect a non-vats build to do more damage? What perks do you think you‚Äôd gain that would allow for that?
---
If they come naturally
---
What platform are you on?
---
I've never been openly attacked by anyone.  I've only been killed by players that I initiated with.
---
I think people need to put their Camp in more remote areas where it isn't visible from the road...
---
It does get sneak bonus 2.5x. Sandman found doesn't work with non silenced, I use a dragon. bloodied is the best right now.
---
aa, Vs scorched, and two shot is next. I found two shot doesn't work well with vats though. Misses a lot. Furious your looking at the queen mainly and aa is better there (imo) with tank killer and adrenaline or go heavy weapon.
---
&gt; put a function on my favorites wheel which would consume a random [food or water] based on my needs, prioritising prepared/cooked lower condition items.
---
Introduces new bug where you literally eat your own best legendary.
---
Didn't realize the Cappy Shirt &amp; Jeans was under-armor, too - they really ought to mention that. 
---
But hey, if the Atom shop material is crappy it means I can save my atoms.
---
Reminder that [this PvP document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djsNSmuRLbpNgyZauhhRQPl3lTSKv6NpKvjPbUPSETM/edit?usp=sharing) exists.
---
What platform you on bud? PS4 and I one shot things all day no problem.
---
And is it the same bug? As in you kill em and then they heal to full? Or is it the one that shows you do a bunch of damage but you actually do less visual bug? 
---
Then why did you blow up when I began to scrutinize your logic?
---
There are multitude of rifles that take advantage of batteries included (laser, plasma, gauss). Rifles are a weapon class pretty evenly split between energy and ballistic types, same with pistols.
---
No other weapon in the game suffers from this unique issue.
---
And I agree, more content is needed. We are on the same page about a lot of things, I just don't agree that this game is "grindy". Lack of content is a different issue all together. Of the goals there are to achieve in this game, they just don't take much grinding to achieve. Some things do, as they generally should, but lack of content is not "grindy".
---
&gt;  Add a hidden loot timer. If you haven't gotten at least a tier 2 drop in X amount of hours, force a random drop.
---
That sounds stupid. This mechanic would be found out and then people would just loiter till their guaranteed drop.
---
How about 3k?
---
But where's the table for human sacrifice at the top to appease the gods at Bethesda to bless the player with new content and patches?
---
The kid who cheated off me in HS and got us both suspended  when I didn‚Äôt even know he was cheating.
---
The bag can despawn, which is why putting it in a registry is the way to go.
---
No, so easy to come by for an Active Payer
---
Unarmed, you mutant.
---
Well that's messed up. Will u accept unicorn hugs to help ease the bad memories? And I not a kid btw lol 
---
I‚Äôve had misssile turrets shoot from the top of the building area allowed all the way to ground level so I don‚Äôt think the range is an issue maybe the game just isn‚Äôt responding to there being enemies around I‚Äôve had it happen before 
---
In all seriousness, I would never judge someone by the type of game they play; I just picked the biggest fish on the market right now because of issues it highlights.  To keep it brief, innovation implies risk, but any idiot can imitate.  Too often in this industry someone will slaughter a horse, and the rest of the horde will beat it's corpse into mash.  It's especially alarming when that "horse" is anti-consumer practices or just serves to dilute the spirit out of what was a unique product.
---
I don't build turrets. 
---
The Dark Tower fan?
---
Granting that the free repair aspect is probably related to the change in how conflicting camps were handled, there's no reason they couldn't patch it out. You'd just be able to place down the broken camp as it was when it packed up. 
---
Nice as it is to be able to cheat the repair costs, it hardly seems intentional. Otherwise, "Repair All" would have a 40 caps/no junk required option
---
My camp is built over a prebuilt train car house in the Mire. It has a working sink and I love that shit.  You have to drink first and then collect real fast though. 
---
Fun part is I love doing this for people, building a good looking base keeps my mind off the buggy messed up part of the game. Sad part is a lot of people have trust issues. If I ask pay up front they think I‚Äôll leave once paid, even if I ask payment after I build individual things. A couple of times I asked for payment after everything was done, and was kicked from the team. Few times but still a bummer.
---
I mean any disease like that. Not the radworm glitch. I mean can I cure a disease I get after starched genes is applied with out curing a mutation.
---
&gt;you never know if it‚Äôll come in handy. 
---
Rockets and mini nukes are never handy...unless you're *trying* to become overencumbered. In that case they'd be very handy.
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm building right now. Considering ranking AGI to 5 to share max rank Adrenaline. Have you tested this yet by chance and gotten good feedback? 
---
Heard that on sharing multiple low rank cards though. Totally agree that should be a opt as long as you have the CHR to pay the share costs.
---
Ah yeah I know what you mean. I wish didn't like my camp the way it is now =\] I'd try this for sure.
---
Are you on xbox by chance? I‚Äôm down to get some revenge for a fellow reddit subscriber.
---
I mean, I quit playing this broke ass game like a month ago after 250 hours of play but my last camp was literally tiny in comparison with this and used up at least 2/3 of the budget. 
---
Reading is helpful friend. I said exclude workshops. 
---
Does anyone even actually lock their doors on their homes? Mine, and the majority of random player ones I've come across are unlocked. If the wanted person can get in, so can the person hunting them. It's not like you can lock someone else's doors.
---
I had this bug a few days ago it was pretty weird seemed the only way to stop the heal was to do damage below a certain number my weapons that did lots of damage very quickly would just heal them but I went in melee and slowly and painfully killed them and it worked 
---
Here is a video of it happening to me: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/374296669](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/374296669)
---
My gt is same as my name on here
---
Empty relative to when I was playing a month ago. I have 300 hours into the game and have seen a steady decline in server population. Was just asking if people have observed a similar trend.
---
I apologize in advance if this is naive, but when keeping yourself at 25%
---
how are they handling if a swarm of mobs pops up? Are they just Stimpacking
---
like crazy? (This is mostly for the people who radiate themselves down
---
to the 25% mark)
---
Same here \[PS4\]. But did run into the bug in this post last night. Legendary kept re-gening.. i finally shot him enough that was losing faster than gaining and died.   
---
Also noticed last night that the whole "0" caps  bug on a vendor is back also. Where if you buy them to 0 they don't reset the next day until you sell them something.
---
Nooooooooo
---

---
Looks like a He.  You do have to wonder where the eggs come from.  Maybe he has a girlfriend. 
---
Who trades anything with other players for caps OMG You ?!?
---
Here is the Want it All Player.
---
Personally I see the hardship from another player and just drop it to a baggy. 
---
 Seriously you sell ? 
---
Yeah, um, how old are you? You have the mentality of a preteen. 
---
They need light. Use the spotlight turrent and lights around the camp. Mine do pretty good right now.
---
I would fix an old suit up. Use the perk to make repairs cost less. Ultracite PA looks cool but that‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôd rather use T60 as its much cheaper.
---
So say would a executioner gamma gun be an effective counter to that build?
---
Just drop the low ones. Should be a way to scrap at least
---
Cappy Shirt and Jeans is an outfit. I own it, wear it and love it. 
---
I've cut back on drinking and have been trying to sleep more. Consequently, less Fallout time. Otherwise... I don't have a point. Reddit!
---
Quest rewards in this game are really weird, it's never really clear at all if they are meant to be in universe or just a weird videogamey thing. 
---
Nah. I just ignore em cuz I know that trick after the first time. 
---
In fact, I do this all the time and it works in my favor 95% of the time. 
---
To be fair though I wait forever and get sick of it. I‚Äôm generally done with the vendor in 10 seconds after opening the inventory while some people seem to be trying to make a lifelong connection with the bender.
---
Let me know if you come across any Calibrated Shocks. I've found jetpack at the Enclave vendor twice, but these are an absolute pain in the balls to locate.
---
I use the shit out of them. Only a couple I don‚Äôt want, and it‚Äôs usually character specific (gun mutations/melee mutations). Empath is about the only one I hate, and that‚Äôs because I play ‚Äúsolo‚Äù
---
wow..i dont even know how i did 300 hours
---
I love stealing fusion cores. only costs like 100c
---
There's a [player-created Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djsNSmuRLbpNgyZauhhRQPl3lTSKv6NpKvjPbUPSETM/edit?usp=sharing) proposing a lot of fixes for exactly this kind of fuckery.
---
I love posts like this because in another post someone is complaining that there isn‚Äôt enough ammo. Like, if only there were some way for these two people to meet in game and exchange their ammo...ü§î
---
Hold on a second. ‚ÄúAgain nobody cares ‚Äú
---
A) that‚Äôs not correct English. 
---
B) you keep replying, so you obviously care to some extent. 
---
This post warms my heart. I salute you, granny.
---
I usually sell it to the vendors so players can feel they earned the legendaries
---
Isn't this a much better discussion than one about how you can go around terrorizing other players and stealing from them.  I do the same thing, newbies are the life of this game so us that have been around a while should go and help them out.  I've even gone as far as following around a newbie and killing things for them.  Let them get a shot in then step in and wipe out the beast attacking.  I remember when I was low level running into the Flatwood Ag research location, those level 1 Farm Hands were tough for me.  it would have been nice to get some help when I was the level.
---
My gm: is Zetsubou Pro send a text for when your  on
---
No. It‚Äôs fixed. Just pick up advanced power connectors and it includes the wall switch, pylon switch, and pylon keypad
---
They don't need to do weekly patches or take the game offline... Let them figure this shit out on their own time and stop making demands. 
---
Good with salt keeps meat around. Class freak if mutated with speed demon and happy camper brings it almost to a halt. Also if you do whitesprings nuked every once in while, you can get a lot of irradiated meat. It never goes bad!
---
I thought legendaries regenerated multiple times naturally?  I know they used to "mutate" in FO4.  In fact, I try to coax legendaries into regening because I had heard that increases loot value.
---
But I may be totally FOS.
---
Have you been to the corpse catapults at Johnson Acres?
---
I did the same thing! Lots of overlap, but I think you missed some obvious choices, like REM‚Äôs ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the end of the world as we know it‚Äù and Siouxie and the Banshees‚Äô ‚ÄúCities in Dust‚Äù. Mine is also a bit heavy on The Cars, just because.

Check the disposal sites and you should be about to find another.
---
Beeeeeee, booooo, screeeeee, dongy dongy, beeeeeee, boooooooo.
---
Sorry to the people who don't speak baud :)
---
Annoying yes,  but also funny and creative. 
---
Fear monger, lol. It's to promote group play and build friendships. This game is literally so much more fun with a group of friends. It's fun while playing solo too, but sometimes I pass up content because I'm alone and it's not worth the effort/resources. Besides, they're cheap as dirt in the atom store and it's easy as hell to get 500 atoms in just a day or two of playing the game.
---
Yes it‚Äôs true. You can‚Äôt build anything in a teammate‚Äôs camp that you acquired from the atom shop
---
Dude that's a whole new level of griefing !
---
The critics (hell, everybody) are stuck in their echo chambers.  It's how they get paid.
---
You can destroy those items if you want. What's the problem?
---
I have can do on and get it ever so often but I used to hate finding dog food now I accept it and use good bot as well
---
It's not.  The Lucky Hole is a mine, but it's got some of the best atmosphere in the game imo.
---
Thank you!!
---
Wearing it should should give you a temporary perk called ‚ÄúBottoms Up‚Äù or ‚ÄúAll Bonged Up‚Äù. Make alcohol last longer.
---
This is definitely what I want most from the game currently. Maybe something we have to craft like an ammo converter/machine?
---
I think it depends on what build or weapon your using 
---
Choked on my coffee at the Granny Panties part. Please keep going.
---
One thing to watch out for is some mutations can cause this however it can be mitigated with Class Freak - I have all but 1 of the mutations and I use Class Freak level 3 and although I have to use food and water from time to time it doesn't seem that bad. Also, as long as I kill the occasional animal and pick up a boiled water (they're everywhere) I'm good.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of time since launch lol. Good fight
---
They probably have no idea how to fix the piece of shit.
---
I took me a few weeks when I had those perks, but not THAT long. lol
---
Is there anyway I could get back into the same server? 
---
You‚Äôre clearly missing the point of my post.  The point is that a gamers experience of the game shouldn‚Äôt include a random attack by other players.  I ‚Äúget‚Äù the mechanics of the game.  I‚Äôve played multiplayer games for years.  I‚Äôve never had such a horrible experience.  I can‚Äôt even set up a camp without it being destroyed or my character being killed.  I‚Äôve also been randomly murdered at train stations and the white spring mall.  It‚Äôs insane being being the victim of random PvP at least once daily.  The point of the game is NOT to ruin other players experience.  
---
And by the way, special points can be buffed (duh).  The higher the level you are the better buffs you get.  
---
What does speed demon do?
---
see I love fighting Gutsy I feel they are actually dangerous I mean I was in a party last night and we were mowing down sentrys and assualtrons (not even talking about pile of protectrons) then 4 gutsys come around corner and dive for cover 
---
but think if every enemy had the damage of gutsy but had less hp it would make you spend more time lining up shots and using cover rather then just walking through a wall of bullets spamming stimpacks 
---
its more a over all balance concept then a flat figure 
---
I cant really say, my main is AAE
---
In Summerville there are lots of low level mutants to take out and they drop 308. Ammo so that place is ok. 
---
Looks great! How do you get in? 
---
But they make such a cute squeak sound when they die :)
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.  That legendary mod would act just like a weapon / armor mod (a one time use to attach to any weapon / armor).
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
Will do!
---
"Blow up"...lol, ok. Your scrutiny of my logic was wrong. You are reading what you want to read. You are still stuck on the Gauss thing...again, I'm making no comparison between the perks used here. Simply pointing out that it's a PURE ballistic damage weapon, not split like Plasma, that requires non-ballistic perks to upgrade. It shoots a different ammo type than it's classification, requiring a different perk to lighten the load. The Broadsider is an explosive weapon, that requires ballistic ammo weight reduction. It's an exception to the standard formula, like the Gauss. Whether it's intended or not, idk and I don't care. Not that realism is very important in this game, but from that standpoint it makes sense. Cannonballs are big, lead balls. They don't explode per say. They shatter and fragment. Which means before they are fired, they are BALLISTIC. But since there's no other way to demonstrate this mechanic aside from having it fall under ballistic ammo, explosive damage, I get it. 
---
The last 2 photos show the tunnel and interior!
---
I used it to make a tower in the middle of the river. I actually sunk my water purifiers to the bottom underneath. It's pretty fun putting on my power armor just to dive down to collect.
---
&gt; hardship  
---
That word, it doesn't mean what you seem to think it means. Having *too much ammo* and wanting something to do with it isn't a hardship.
---
Stealth. I'm mostly using the hunting rifle and super sledge. 
---
Yup.  Take a great game with excellent lore and instead of improving and expanding to what everyone wants.  Lets just break the shit out of it and give everyone a 100 lbs of shit spray painted gold.
---
Is there any place like Pylon 13 that can give you over 100 rads &amp; has a rad scrubber near by?
---
Once I dropped a solo nuke on fissure site prime and dced as soon as the queen spawned üëå
---
Legendary heal but regular mobs been good on my end. Had a level 5 mutant go invincible once but that was quite a while ago. The server lag has been bad for me lately. It's either that or my comp is ready to take a dive. =|
---
Same I lost a 3 star two shot combat rifle with the other 2 perks for vats which was really good weapon for my build
---
I'd get a bounty on my head and eheh, fighting those suckers who one shot me melee would drain like 200 caps out my collection, where I'd only gain 30 or less caps from them, so after a good couple revenges, a bounty is not what you want to get next \^\^;
---
best bug ever! lol
---
Another over exaggeration of things. So tired of all these, FUCK YOU posts. 
---
Go yell at the clouds. 
---
They arent trivial when insulting someone else's intelligence lol
---
I did, mystery solved lol
---
Jesus this is embarrassing. This is what we have after 3 months. 
---
Nice asspull dude.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
You get more caps by selling to other players than the pitiful amounts the vendor bots give out.
---
Oh god my stomach just exploded twice after hitting that hot button!
---
There has very often been an update or insider on Tuesdays, so this silent Tuesday is pretty odd one.
---
I got a TSE 50 Cal from the queen one week before the Nerf, now it is just collecting dust in my stach.
---
It‚Äôs a game mechanic, it doesn‚Äôt have to make sense just get use to it. Punji boards produce minimal threat but yet are invaluable to protecting stuff from melee atrackers. 
---
Observations = Free asspulls. Forgot bout that.
---
There was a glitch with assaultron heads that made all your fusion cells go into the fire slot and when you clicked it fired all your shots but did 1 shot amount of damage 
---
I take it english isn't your first language.
---
pretty sure vendor at welch station has some
---
Grant you it's creative, but sure there must be a better way? Like just building a some concrete defence walls around it so you might only have to scale it. I mean trying to get steal the workshop option felt like trying to get the last pringle in a can, just so darn annoying and small gaps!
---
Empty is empty. 
---
Also, other games came out recently. That always draws people away.
---
Pretty sure Whitespring golf course will always Trump everything else.
---
this, I picked mine up with three other variants by checking one of the bunkers at Black Mountain Ordnance Works every couple days 
---
I can kill a Bronto and get 50 meat that I just throw in a fire and cook 20 at a time. They spoil in 10-15 minute segments if I'm online or offline. Only gives 20 points of food. 
---
Nice name! It's a mutation, faster speed (walking, sneaking, sprint) and faster reload too. But it increases hunger and thirst.
---
Not really.  I'm melee so I don't have the repair and bullet costs.
---
The rewards are still meh.  You can get 1 star legendaries for the kill and the event completion.
---
See? Like it says on the tin:
---
&gt; It just reads like the author is a child that just learned their first dirty word and they are now a bad, bad boy.
---
You do you, you super cute bad mofo!
---
Well I don‚Äôt agree with the gg ez thing or killing afk people but everything else is just meh what ever do it if you want just don‚Äôt fuck with me because I won‚Äôt fight I‚Äôm a pacifist and will not attack anyone (mainly because you don‚Äôt know what type of weapon they might have is it tse shotgun or a ghoul slayer gamma gun)
---
Thanks! 
---
Grind Whitesprings
---
Uhhh.  Im on ps4.  I thought grabbing what you saw was searching the container too.
---
I am not sure how anyone completes this quest. I can't get them to spawn at all with my lvl70+ char on PS4, or my lvl20+ on XBox. I just assumed it was bugged for everyone.
---
Workshop battles are totally different.  Those serve a purpose and are fun!
---
&gt;Kingdom Come Deliverance
---
ive heard of it, never tried it. 
---
Feel free to give the glowing mass and high radiation fluids to me. I'll be happy to take some of them off your hands
---
I totally missed seeing the tunnel the first time. Looks awesome! 
---
I just went ahead and bought the plan. Start saving those caps. 
---
Pay to win, bordering on that.
---
Esstially loot boxes as well.
---
And loot boxes are under a lot of fire right now.
---
You keep saying ‚Äúyou do you‚Äù over and over followed by some passive aggressive comments.  It‚Äôs funny to read, since you appear to be recycling phrases too.
---
The Radworm ‚Äòfeature‚Äô is hilarious. But yes, Jesus Christ, fix these weird ‚Äòfeatures‚Äô. 
---
KEEL OVER AND DIE
---
Yesterday I tried joining my husbands server 10 times and each time my screen froze and I‚Äôd have to quit the game. I would load into another server fine but when I tried the switch... nothing. On try 11, I FINALLY loaded in and died instantly in the nuke zone at whitesprings. Womp womp.
---
nope, been logged in and doing workshop runs for maybe 3 hours now, solid 
---
With 360+ hours I have not yet been in a situation where I felt like I was being purposely singled out or had someone attack my camp maliciously. However, if someone did come and bother me I would do the ??? emote and the 'hello' emote but I wouldn't fight back unless I was confident I was prepared to do so (and didn't have any valuable junk on me). Failing all of that, I would 'block' the person and/or exit the game and join a friend's server.
---
Roll it back.
---
Something to add to your morning run:
---
South West of 76 is a moonshiner's shack that always has a few ticks. Kill them for their blood. Do the same to the ticks at the Mill just down the hill on the way to Flatwoods. Tick blood can be made into blood packs which are part of the recipe to make stimpacks. With chemist and the perk that lets you search for extra meat on animals (the name of which I've completely forgotten) you can usually get 6-8 tick bloods and end up with 12-16 stimpacks. More with Super Duper.
---
Yeah but if im rolling around with my team of 4, we tend to discourage our foes fairly quickly and we end up with the server to our-self's. 
---
Grinding mobs is the answer.  If you can find events that require milling lots of mobs, even better. 
---
Guess I should clarify, I'm lvl 48 now. The muties in Summerville seem to be small beans. :P
---
Nope.  Just the monorail pylon camp in the middle of nowhere.
---
If I have maxed lead belly and aquaboy, why do I take rads when collecting dirty water?
---
They said they would never do this. And it's a good thing. You will eventually have every perk option. Plus some are level based. You might get them, but can't use them till a certain level.
---
Yeah, I honestly don't even know why they have to verisons, I'm assuming a programming error that was never caught and no one ever bothered to submit as a bug report
---
it honestly feels like they're dealing "true damage"
---
I have a bounty all the time now. I don't wreck CAMPs but I kill their turrets because they shoot at me, and I want to get my bounty higher. Also if they are in places like Whitespring or Charelston vendor spawn, I don't feel bad about it.
---
Exact same situation here. By the way, have you experienced those bugs getting even more severe while in a team? Because I was never awarded a stealth hit bonus while being in a team, despite being \[HIDDEN\].
---
I will be the first to fall on this hand grenade......for fucks sake! 
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
You make every other perk automatic to the point that we are all moving the cards on and off to see if they work and then you make us jump through extra hoops every single container for a subset of perks. Wtf. 
---
Alllllll that missed ammo.
---
Most 1 star legendaries don't sell for crap in FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  Probably just best to drop them.  Concentrate on finding 2-3 star legendaries.
---
If it's got minus damage OR plus damage to one enemy team, it's complete garbage.  Vendor it or drop it in a suitcase at the vendor for newbies.
---
Hope that helps!
---
Ugh, sucks for me then.
---
Thanks for the info though!
---
Clearly we simply disagree whether this is intended or a mistake. That is all I want to know. 
---
However,  you choose to directly insult me, calling me a "snowflake" and the most I've said toward you is that I found your original comparison laughable.
---
Yeah a Executioner gamma gun would useful, since none of the armour would be strong enough to negate the rad damage. A grenade (like the pumpkin grenade) would be useful, but they'll most likely have enough time to dodge the grenade
---
I always wondered why scorch beasts hated camps so much.
---
for starters, my STR goes into the 60s
---
that + bloodied power fist + twisted muscles + talons is big damage.
---
While I was near the Watoga Station I saw a lower level character building a house. I gave him a few Stimpaks and proceeded to head to the vendor. I felt pretty good about myself.
---
Along the way I checked the suitcase (you know which one) and found about 400 plastic and 400 hundred glass.
---
*It seemed the wasteland paid it forward.*
---
That seemed like the best I'd seen so far. Is there a method for getting it swamped with enemies. Sometimes it is if other players are there, but by myself it's a ghost town. 
---
The quest of the OVERSEER. I have all the log of her but the quest didn't valid.
---
Save up your caps, that's one plan that never drops.
---
Rad Worms is increasing the positive and negative effects of your mutations. So if you have Speed Demon you may see a bigger drain on resources if you dont use class freak perk. 
---
dont worry, t45 doesnt really do much in the long run. excavator armor is where its at for the level you are currently at, and it has more functional uses!
---
Water will increase thirst and regenerate enemies.
---
It's because they both have attacks for which mitigation doesn't really do anything.
---
Relogging respawns them.
---
i love clearing out a horde of enemies and fighting through a legendary boss to get a 1 star bloodied switchblade that sells for 2c. you dont?
---
I've noticed a reduction in players.  Also nuked zones.  I've seen maybe 4 or 5 since they released patch 5.  I usually play from 6pm to 10pm central. 
---
My daisy cutter is worthless now. Im on xbox 1. Anybody wanna buy it and some nukes? 
---
You can already make food/water a favourite and access from the wheel.
---
You'll get over it.
---
Popcorn?
---
Hrm. Was kinda hoping for some way to cheese it. This is pretty much what I was already doing. 
---
What I did to combat this is use the perk cards that buff the food and water consumption. It really made a huge difference.
---
Done
---
I always end up hurting my brahmin at my camp.  There's no way that I know of to get rid of a specific mutation though, and I don't want to lose all of the good ones I have.
---
When can we meet
---
By getting rid of some dupers and eliminating the mass quantities, haven‚Äôt they already improved the server in theory? You‚Äôd think that would be enough to bump everything up a notch. 
---
From my memory of things before this patch they would get to half and then regen to full once. This one got to half, and kept regening. My shots would do not quite half life on 'em. So after he filled back he went to like 60%, was regening, got to about 80% when I got him the second time dropping him to about 40%. was regened to about 60% when I him the third time and got him to 20% health. Final shot hit at about 40% health regened and killed him. It was like there was no trigger to regen after that first time. any amount of damage would make him regen to max at a fairly fast pace.
---
Someone on here mentioned the serendipity perk that negates 40ish% damage, does that negate rad damage too or just physical damage?
---
So server hopping. Oy. Thanks for the tip friend. 
---
I *think* it's is bound to the jump button
---
PC: Space

PS4: Triangle

XBO: Y button
---
Xbox? Go to Recent players in the Xbox menu. Join one of them.
---
&gt;High powered rifles such as gauss, hunting, black powder and lever action, I think that they should be the high damage against tough enemies type, balance them around killing super mutants. 
---
Currently everything high-level also has high damage resistance. There's nothing that's just a sack of hp, so they'd need to change that if they wanted a bit more scissors-paper-stone.
---
The big issue with not making a C.A.M.P. on a water source.
---
They need to make collecting water from a Pump as quick as doing it from a water source.  
---
I was impressed at first until you revealed that you used an exploit to get to that level, wow. 
---
It will be this evening, if that's alright. 
---
GT is disenchanter
---
/r/fallout is leaking
---
&gt;Even worse is the turret targeting, could have a few super mutants just standing on the edge of your camp taking pot shots at your extractor and generator while your turrets scan the surroundings like nothing is going on.
---
Yeah the turrets don't seen to even notice enemies that are  20 yards away from your camp and shooting at your generator.
---
It‚Äôs a stupid mechanic that adds exactly nothing to the game besides monitoring some arbitrary meter that has little or no impact on anything. 
---
Destroying the stash makes sense for being able to loot their bodies, but what do you get out of destroying expensive objects?
---
Just because you haven't had issues doesn't mean they don't exist. And of course it's complicated, literally everyone understands that. That's no excuse for releasing a game that clearly wasn't ready.
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be a new server, you can even rejoin the same one, so long as all the ghouls are dead they‚Äôll respawn (this method for nukes)
---
If there is a leather stealth perk,  I'm not aware of it.  I run a combo of raider, heavy combat,  and pretty much whatever legendaries give me the best perks,  i have 3* sneak and 15 ability.  I'm usually only detected if a mob bumps into me,  and even then sometimes they push me out of the way.  One caveat,  i have shadow on every piece of armor that i can put it on and i wear the stealth combat chest from the free states questline. 
---
Wtf. 11+ hours a day since launch. You should quit and see some sun light.
---
Alt-f4, this is how i farm certain areas.  I had friends to join, but none of them play now
---
I asked because the first time I built one was at a work shop and it wouldn't let me use it to defend it because it said I was too close. 
---
2 small water purifiers does it. I used to boil water low level, and it was a pain but once you get a stable base going, you'll have water to vendor.
---
inert flux is from flora you've gathered inside a nuke zone that have gone bad.  For example, if you harvest the glowing tree sap inside a nuke zone, your hud will display "raw Cobalt flux added". The problem is that raw flux goes bad, just like food does, so it has to be changed into stable flux.  This is done at a chemistry bench under the "Nuked Flora" option.  Masses and high radiation fluids are required ingredients for changing raw flux into stable flux, which doesn't go bad.  Different types of stable fluxes are then used for crafting various power armor mods and other things.  For example, the plans for a decontamination arch take just about every type of flux there is.
---
Not even putting the Hogwarts train in would help at this point. The game needs:
---
1. More PvE Content. Like, a lot. And hey, some human NPCs so you have someone to actually rebuild for.
---
2. Major, major infrastructure changes and bug fixes to improve stability
---
3. Separation of balancing changes for PvP and PvE so that each is appropriate for what they are.
---
Man, I really wish we had an acct wide stash box. With a higher limit.
---
Toxic Valley has plenty of flash ferns if you nuke Lewisburg.  They also have a few Quantum Leafs which are Cobalt, it's not great but it's better than most places.
---
TBH I've only had someone attack a workshop of mine once, and he was like 50 levels below me.  Squashed him like a bug like 5 times before he finally gave up.  Maybe I just happened to get more peaceful servers.
---
You're Welcome
---
We should be able to buy the moving ones in the store if we have the regular unlocked, then
---
Reminds me more of a ziggurat (step pyramid). Looks great regardless. 
---
We use both up too fast and meat and vegetables spoil much too quickly. You kill an animal and loot the meat just as the sun comes up and halfway through the day it's spoiled? Too much of the game consists of chores.
---
Yeah for some reason it counts your teammates as ***you*** being in stealth or not.
---
Which is BS.
---
Yes! I would love to be able to do that. 
---
I understand that ammo is very easy to come by and craft, but there are times where I wouldn't mind making a few extra caps or produce additional material off of unwanted ammunition.
---
This is a great guide, I wish I'd read this before I dropped my first nuke. like an idiot I nuked Fissure Prime first and gathered a bunch of violet flux, only to realize that I couldn't do shit with it because i needed the other ingredients to make the stable violet flux to in turn make the goddamn T-51b calibrated shocks I've been chasing for 2 weeks.
---
So what is the best place to nuke for the other 3 ingredients? is it still Whitesprings? I've heard the area around Vault Tec university is also good. 
---
Yeah, I've had times where I wanted to just level buildings (400 hours in the game but no TSE heavey gun so) but I still just feel shaken by having a bounty on me, especially not to be able to see where everyone is on the map XD
---
&gt;This is why I built my camp in literal bumfuck nowhere.
---
That helps. but only to a certain extent. 
---
I did the same thing, but liberator bots will shoot at my generator from 50 yards away, slowly chipping away at it until it is destroyed.
---
What kind of weapons are you using? Does switching to melee help?
---
Sorry,  that was my bad.  I totally misread your post. No i have yet to see a legendary pipe revolver. I would love one though for my gunslinger. 
---
At least I can address people without insulting them or their intelligence when someones says I don't understand something. 
---
Yeah, let me paraphrase, I could be a cunt to people like you but I'd be worthless then
---
Found like 2000 various bullets in a suitcase and totally didn‚Äôt realize that I could be doing the same thing, I have so many extra plans I don‚Äôt need that I really should be leaving them behind for others! 
---
And I‚Äôve found if anyone else is in the building it can also negate the respawn.
---
People would scream Pay 2 Win.  And they'd be right.  You could literally buy 100 packs at level 1 and have every card available as soon as the level unlocks happened.
---
Best advice is to keep playing.  By the time you hit level 100, you'll be swimming in cards and you'll have tons of unspent levels where you can just get whatever card you want.
---
My melee character is around 170 and I've got 44 unspent levels.  Don't need the cards or the respec points now.
---
You can't. Just have to use radaway or a decon shower until it's gone. Then if you can't craft Mutations a lot of people sell them for pretty cheap üëç
---
Excellent idea! I dropped my All Rise and went to pick it up and it wasn‚Äôt there. I was so mad.
---
What‚Äôs high level these days?  I‚Äôm stuck in the central time zone evening players so it‚Äôs peak time for douchbaggery.
---
I have  some of every cultivatable plant in my C.A.M.P.    
---
I have Green Thumb.
---
Every time I return to my C.A.M.P. I harvest my foods.  Usually 16-20 Corn, 10-12 carrots, and similar amounts of Gourd, Melon, Muttfruit, etc.
---
I pick up wood every time I pass a log, so I have usually around 300-500 wood scraps.  
---
I grab 50-100 water from a source, and then... cook the shit out of everything I have.  
---
I usually just keep the Corn and Blackberry stuff, since it sits conveniently atop the alphabetical list.  The rest I sell to Vendors.  Easy experience, easy money.    
---
I also make all meat I find into food.  Simple Mutt Chops restore 45 hp.
---
Once you make this part of a routine, it's maybe 5 minutes out of an hour to do.
---
Intentional, it went in 2-ish patches ago
---
I've never even seen wood and I'm level 60... How tf
---
Xbox. üòë 
---
&gt; Hmm, somewhat mediocre this week
---
That can be said every week, really it's in the eyes of the beholder. Personally, the pilsner sign and dart board appeal to me somewhat though I'll need to see what they look like after work.
---
Definitely. 
---
Burn out the lower charge cores first, it just makes more sense. Combining would be great for weight reduction, but something like this would essentially do the same thing and save us the effort of having to build something
---
We need more emotes! I'd buy a Cheers! emote but not the icon.
---
fucking lord can I have some? i‚Äôm on ps4
---
Could have been worse,  if he had used footlocker stash boxes it could have been made with no gaps.   Maybe i shouldn't put that up here...;)
---
I don't use power armor all the time.  Really only use it for nuke zones.
---
And then they nerf the crap out of White Knight..........fml :(
---
If you use power armor all the time, go on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  Sell your excess Ballistic Fiber.  Use those caps to buy Fusion Cores.  Everyone wins :)
---
Aren't Neon Letters are still bugged? Some of the letters won't snap properly -- end up at an angle and clipping the wall?
---
Not sure about tenderizer but my DCG is doing 1500-1800 dmg
---
That‚Äôs really encouraging.  You‚Äôve made me feel better.  üòä 
---
&gt;And by the way, special points can be buffed (duh). The higher the level you are the better buffs you get.
---
I've never heard of this, can you provide an example where a level 100 player gets a better buff than a level 80 player?
---
&gt;The point is that a gamers experience of the game shouldn‚Äôt include a random attack by other players.
---
Love or hate it, the game allows for unprovoked pvp interactions. Your *opinion* is that the game shouldn't include a random attack by other players. That's how you *feel*, not how the game was designed though. Bethesda dictates how the game works, and right now the game allows for unprovoked pvp interactions with bounties as the penalty.
---
Stahp it!
---
Young Man or Miss do not spread this forbidden knowledge! Tis a crime worthy of Treason!, make sure the only forbidden knowledge you have are those technical data!
---
If I remember right, they can be bought from vendors, I think in Whitespring. ITs common.
---
Agreed. I have a high swing speed combat knife that wrecks. 
---
I failed to mention I did get an automated reply telling me they couldn't restore an item. I was misleading when I said not a peep. Sorry Bethesda. I was distraught. There really is no category for C.A.M.P. or "other". Update though, this is being addressed ion the next patch!
---
I found one less than a hundred yards from my CAMP the other day.  He was just staring at me from a distance, unmoving, so I lined up a perfect shot with my TSE Dragon... about 3/4 of his health instantly vanished, and then so did he :(
---
Serendipity only negates physical or ballistic damage, but the perk card only works when not in PA, but action girl/action boy maxed plus dodgy would mean you avoid a % of damage for the cost of 30 Ap or less I believe.
---
gah I hate having to wait like 8 mins to reply XD
---
&gt; it counts your teammates as ***you*** 
---
Just what I thought.
---
I was optimistic when Bethesda revealed that FO76 was going to be a multiplayer experience, but I ended up preferring to play solo because I feel useless in a team.
---
People have already been in the vaults. It is exactly like a silo. qq
---
West tek is a pretty good place higher level mutants drop caps and almost always drop 5.56 usually there‚Äôs a few legendary guys in there if you have a good clearing weapon it‚Äôs rather easy 
---
That's definitely not right.  Good catch.
---
Combining makes sense. That's just QoL.
---
Charging is bad. Cores are plentiful...if you explore. Charging will just lead to people charging cores and dashing around as Perma-tanks.
---
This will in turn lead to bored but vocal players who find the game too easy. And then to balancing the game around permanently wearing Power Armor.
---
Personally I think Cores need to be more rare. As does wearing Power Armor.
---
Yeah they changed it.
---
I‚Äôve got 3 bulk leather you can have 
---
thats surprising.. the low level that got killed either left the game or changed servers.. evidently he didnt get the warm fuzzies.. hopefully that didnt make him go "F\*\*\* this game" and quit. surprising they would do this. i mean higher lvl areas i could understand but in the twinkie area?
---
disease cure will not cure mutations.
---
No, I'm telling you when I tested I was consuming 6 water long before they starting dropping more water in the purifiers.  
---
There seems to be some erratic consumption rates going on
---
This would happen in FO4 if the game thinks they won't be able to do enough damage to you (such as running around with 6 pieces of sentinel gear) and so they would run away. On my standard armor melee build I have 5 pieces of sentinel armor, and things like blocker and lone wanderer, and they often will yell retreat.
---
Blackwater mines (the building with armor bench) and watoga (cafe and various bar tables) spawns multiple cans.
---
add me on xbox if you want rid of your glowing mass and hrf? Sell your inert though.  
---
Ill give you something for the Mass and fluids.
---
GT:  stitch32
---
We paid. We should get a game that works !! Mr Bethesda worker. 
---
Exactly. 
---
Charging just leads to people who quit exploring to find Cores and instead use recharge to perma-tank, get bored and complain about how easy the game is.
---
I saw a level 4 get wanted for doing the same thing. Can you even fight back to defend pre level 5 with pacifist mode stuck on? Sounds like a griefers paradise.
---
I bought the Fusion Generator plans from Camden Park's vendor.  I was hoping that it would occasionally generate cores, but not a single one has appeared all week :(
---
Good to know!
---
I still have mine as of logging on Sunday night.
---
Yep same thing for me. Even with Speed Demon that keeps me at 100% with no big issues. I've run out of Purified Water 1 time due to extended play and negligence. 
---
Naked avatars... While entertaining is a royal PITA when you try to get out of your Power Armor.
---
Well I *know* I don't have to wait 24, because even in those initial few server hope I got two or three different items (I just never got what I was looking for).
---
That would be amazing!
---
Twisted Muscles, Talons and Adrenaline Reaction mutations. You a bloodied weapon and bam 1000 or more damage. 
---
PSA: For the developers, dont nerf melee, nerf mutations. Nerf Talons and Twisted Muscles by like 15% and youll be ok. 
---
kinda what i was thinking.
---
in the video you can see me switch from an electric, 2 rifles and a gatling gun with explosive shot.
---
Guess I'm gonna have to add it to my "buy" list then.
---
One time all my weapons were doing really weak damage, and I'm a 2H melee character with all the perks. It wouldn't stop until I restarted the game. Xbox One
---
Good Doggy perk with Canned Dog Food.
---
Easy to find, gives 3 x the benefit and health.
---
Purified water for all drinking.
---
Never need another perk card or food ever again :)
---
Im sorry if that has been already posted but I will try to describe as clear as i can.
---
During my gameplay I started bulking junk. When I was confuse what junk was unscrapped in my box I decided to transfer all to the character, scrap all and then pressing T to transfer my all junk to the box.
---
After that all my bulked junk was unbulked (200+ plastic lost). So watch out with this
---
I will add u in a bit
---
You only need one Gold account, but you'll need to pick up another copy of FO76 since you have the physical disc. Make one of the XB's your home XBox, any silver accounts that play on this one get the benefits of your gold account.  Play your main char (Gold account) on the second XB. 
---
LOL as far as i know they patched all the good stuff...looks like we have to grind the old-skool way. i did see some good RifleGaming videos where they dropped nukes on a few places that spawned a ton of glowing ones. but, without a nuke drop...maybe events? i'm in the same boat at lv 62, just kind of wandering around killing things.
---
It seems that the common belief is that they're trying to "encourage" more PvP. However, the actual effect will simply be for non-PvPers to avoid supply drops they didn't call because the contents are trash.
---
It applies to all the aid drops, I found out myself the hard way the day it was patched in, my very first wanted level
---
I get what you're saying, sort of, but you really think an endgame boss in a multiplayer RPG should go down in a few hits? I don't agree with that at all. I think this post was referring to the regular enemies anyway. I guess, in my experience, I don't see it as much of a problem. Level appropriate stuff tends to go down pretty fast for me, even for a fallout game. anything below my level is vaporized. I guess what I'm saying is this isn't really a survival game first, it's a fallout RPG with survival ELEMENTS. 
---
I appreciate your response and thinks for not being like the other dude that replied, LOL
---
The day after the known plans tag popped up, the Watoga suitcase was filled with plans. I was finally able to get the barn plans after a billion tries!
---
Yes. 
---
Sorry, I have a day job. I can't spend my whole life playing the game. My kids would be where's Daddy. You have a wife and kids too ? Erm ? 
---
if it makes you feel better, power fist and deathclaw gauntlet has the same base damage (not sure after mods tho). 
---
You only get a 10 cap bounty for each item. So if you just shoot 1 you only get a 10 cap bounty anyway. Get some good defense perks and good armor like -8% from players and -15% standing still or sprinting and then when people come to hunt the bounty you get caps. Hehe.
---
We need PVE only servers, so we can have personal game tweaks. Servers with 2x damage and 50% less HP for EVERYONE. 
---
Servers where Cores are Super rare.
---
Servers where food and thirst rates decay much more slowly...but where food is more rare.
---
Modifiers would be great. Choose which settings you like, go to a corresponding server.
---
Oldest rebuttal in the book.. never heard that one before.. the game works dude. it will take time to get it into a better state. At this point the only the bethesda needs is time, not weekly patches just to make some people happy.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  You can pay players caps to mod your armor.
---
The only time you should be buying mod PLANS is if you plan on spending a LOT of time modding other players armor for caps.  It's not profitable unless you turn it into a job....lol
---
Plus when you pay players to mod your armor, the caps stay in the COMMUNITY...........they don't get eaten by greedy vendor bots with 200 limit cap pools :)
---
Can you blueprint it or is it too big?
---
Yup., I a post about this a few days ago.  Someone said a change came out in patch 4 but I couldn't find anything on it.  Supply drops now act like they're "owned" which they shouldn't be.
---

In response to the last part, you can make the XB you give to your friend your Home Xbox, and they can make yours their Home Xbox.
---
You can then "share" single copies of digital games you each buy. Just make sure it's a trustworthy friend, because they can F your stuff up.
---
Getting over 200 mr fuzzy tokens and not being able to get my fucking outfit
---
Yeah, level 52 gutsy's with the assault rifle are one of the few enemies that makes me want to improve my defensive stats due to them taking out 10-20 percent of my health with each shot. I've been towing with the idea of unlocking perks such as Ricochet, Suppressor, and Dodgy just to combat this but it's a big perk point / level investment. As it is, I can take them out usually in one hit with my instigating super sledge  but when going up against 5 of them they get in some good shots and I usually have to give in an use 1 or 2 extra stimpaks to not die.
---
It would be sweet if we had access to a type of dump container that would be held up by a flotation device of some sort which then would send out a signal to players (something similar to US Requisition quest) so players can sort of be notified of this sort of thing. Granted a lot of people may not find what they hope, but still.    
---
Remember to "search" caps stashes now too
---
Move your camera around as you rotate the item.
---
Look at where you want to place the item at different angles.
---
It happens on Xbox too.
---
Annoying but this method works for me.
---
well for higher levels supply drops are trash true.. but on my new rolled character i hit it pretty good from supply drops.. was lvl 5 and got 3-4 pieces of leather armor, one was lvl 5 regenerating, and a lvl 5 pump shotgun which to my level 5 self i said awesome to start with.
---
Right, but I enjoy cooking many different things for buffs, so I have a minimum of four or five different food and drinks on hand at any given time. Of course, I've also got dog food and purified water on the hot wheel for the quick approach, but that has simply become my go-to and caused spoilage of most other things because of the tedium.
---
Hello Bethesda employee. Critics far outway you. Sad but true. 
---
Then you have something to work towards again. Spend a few days not *completely* optimized. 99% of the pve content can be played solo, with no build.
---
I mean, I guess it could be just me, but I like having somewhere to go. When I switched from pistols to unarmed (because RNGzus decided to bless me with the talons mutation AND a bloodied mole miner gauntlet) I had like 10 strength, 1 end, and no melee perks. I don't the next 10 or 20 levels moving points and unlocking perks (and probably the best 40 levels after that hunting down gear and mutations). Each time I leveled up, I had that satisfying feeling of getting stronger, I had to make choices of which perk to take next. Now, when I level up, I just pick something random so I don't see the point-or-perk screen everything I need to swap perks out. A full respec option would have let me immediately hit max potential, and then what? Get bored that much sooner, because there's no room for my character to improve anymore?
---
My stomach exploded after reading the comments. Good, funny stuff.
---
Lol !
---
Exactly, so many Bethesda employees now resorting to fake accounts on here over fixing the game 
---
Quad would be pointless. 
---
Double-conditioned, the gun would still break before you‚Äôre through the 1200 round mag :)
---
I haven't tried but I doubt it. Its about 3/4 of the budget and the blueprint budget is lower. Plus I suspect there's going to be errors all over the place if you try and place it again. 
---
On xbox there used to be post of 600+ now there's only like 250 but not everyone creates post on xbox and it's on xbox
---
It wasn't worth doing before they nerfed our weapons, but at least it was fun. Now it's neither. 
---
Dude you would probably be able to make a great YouTube series of creative FO76 base designs. That‚Äôs the coolest base I have seen
---
PS4?
---
Well that certainly is scummy then.  
---
Yeah that‚Äôs good , any idea what the glitch was ?
---
Make sure you're using Class Freak.  It reduces 75% of negative mutation effects.
---
Only pick mutations that are useful to your build.  Then go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits to buy those serums from players for caps.
---
DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT pay the modus vendors for mutation serums or recipes.  You can get it MUCH MUCH cheaper on the trading reddits.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
Seriously though. Im a spammer when it comes to collecting and keep having to just drop lots of potentially useful components. At least give us the base component from the ammo, a la, lead. 
---
Right now whether you consider the game working depends on what you do in the game and a very loose definition of 'works'.
---
Crouch while in base. You disappear off the map
---
I've found I stop getting XP from the robots at Whitespring most of the time.  Not sure if this is a bug or a feature.
---
Same here. The other day I ended up using like 40 stimpaks against one Mirelurk queen (just South of Watoga Station). I can usually make it through many battles without every having to use a stimpak so this was bad. I'm thinking of combining my Poisoner's armor pieces to have a full set of 5 in an effort to not die from the acid attacks.
---
I think anthem might take away more players...
---
Spelling and grammar lines up to topic of the post
---
Well you can play a ghoul.
---
Perk yourself out and edit your character.
---
That would be interesting but would require a lot of work.

You're being sarcastic I hope. Thanks for the tips on how not to be griefed. I've been griefed lately, someone following me across servers and everything. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A GRIEFER PLEASE, PLEASE develop some humerous or terrifying role playing attributes. Just getting killed by douchebags who say "gonna cry now baby?" is so boring and getting old
---
Neither.  The only robots that don‚Äôt give xp are the low level mr gutsy.
---
You're funny.
---
How long before Bethesda starts banning people for "exploiting" the game? 
---
Fantastic.  Got a recipe for Peach tea?  
---
Clipboards at Camp McLintock are also a great screw source without a fight.  Check the blue plastic containers all over the main building.  Usually 3 per basket.
---
Nah Fusion Cores burn out quick with Jetpacks 
---
With respect, it may be your opinion that wearing power armor should be rare, but some of us like to build for it, personally, I couldn't see a build for both being very viable because of the weight of regular armor and the additional perks required
---
One-shits.  
---
What a fantastic typo.
---
OP is suggesting they take the game offline and suffer a hit, similar to final fantasy. He also is saying they should do weekly patches or else they'll take a hit. At this point they should just continue patching as they please. Taking the game offline will be much worse to their player base than not doing weekly patches. 
---
Oh cool, didn‚Äôt know that. Tried it myself yesterday and once I‚Äôd picked up some plans nothing spawned in the next 7 hops.. but logged in again today and there was a new plan
---
Yeah, Camp Venture for the bags.
---
I was just being polite... :'(
---
DLC :)
---
Word that‚Äôs fucking awesome. I‚Äôd love to try this build out. 
---
Psssst
---
Read the terminal outside the entrance.
---
Eat an Assassin's Fatman, and you die in a glorious explosion of guts and glory.
---
Yeah nobody is going to be using camps to play house. CAMPs will be mobile fast travel points to get straight back into the fight. They will always be nearby with a stash and a crafting workbench to stash junk and repair/craft ammo.
---
They do. Food stacks with chems. Beer and Party Boy/Girl at 2 also gives 3 Charisma if you‚Äôre short on Grape Mentats. 
---
1. It doesn‚Äôt show on the tooltip. May or may not be bugged. 
---
2. If it‚Äôs anything like F4, Fire is damage over time and multiple hits with it don‚Äôt stack. Many things in F76 work differently though. 
---
Then don‚Äôt fast travel *pro tip*
---
Combining them, rechargins them, etc.  We need this.  Maybe make acquisition of the fusion generator for C.A.M.P. a precursor.  Or permit it to be done @ the Core Generator at Power Stations.  (There will be long lines there.)  
---
We all have to agree thre are so many things to farm to maintain a character.  Fusion requires only hydrogen, so let's simplify it.
---
cool! I wont be on until 2-3 hours if you dont mind holding on to it for me
---
Ok I'm pretty sure the assaultrons were doing the same, and not dropping loot either.
---
fun, and bait for then to attack you
---
&gt; Also ZeniMax has nothing to do with fallout 76 lol so shows what you know
---
roflmfao
---
oh child
---
i know i saw one on sunday, don't remember where though

They give approximately 100xp pet kill, and drip fusion cells and aluminum

Were there supermutants in the vault...no well then guess were gonna need a whole new story.

In the right group not much.

/u/NotAcceptingPMs is toxic but they raise a good point.
---
The timer can be fixed to requiring X amount of legendary kills. There are ways to make it work.  The lack of content becomes grinding though. I am out of content so all that is left for me to do is grind for better weapons. Weapons that do not drop. Which is why I've stopped playing until the next update. Grinding for ammo to grind for weapons that don't drop is too much grinding. It wouldn't be as much of a grind if I used melee, so part of it is on me, but I shouldn't be pushed toward using a specific weapon type to lessen the grind. I don't really enjoy melee in 76 so my grinding would be even less fun haha. I don't want to be handed tier 3 legendaries, but I'd also like to get one at some point. And have a fair amount of ammo. I miss having ammo.
---
This is a nice idea but it's pretty limited by the fact that you need 1 stable violet flux for each recycle. The 30% chance to double is really nice but violet flux, from what I've noticed, is a bit more rare than some of the others and would bottleneck this method over time (at least for me). 
---
My method for fusion cores is to just occasionally fast travel to locations with sentry bot spawns and kill them real quick. Has worked pretty well so far. But I will likely supplement it with this. Thanks for the info! 
---
I‚Äôm 40 so most gamers are kids to me. I grew up in an era where we figured out games on our own and it was considered weak or cheating to have to ask for the answers. I will say it‚Äôs much more rewarding to figure it out on your own. Rather than just have the answers handed to you.  In closing hugs are great. Happy gaming.
---
That doesn't change the fact it still locks up ever 5 minutes or so otherwise
---
Ugh. Humans complain no matter what you do for them. Stop playing if it's that bad. Atoms are FAKE, worthless anyway. It's a game. Sheesh.
---
I would say it is more about the experience and camaraderie especially if you leave voice chat on and participate. Last night we killed the SBQ fairly quickly but soon after the person who actually launched the nuke showed up and was a bit peeved considering they didn't make it in time due to being over-encumbered.
---
Please, no! Please, don't do it!!! Don't go!! nooo nooo noooo noononononononononononononoooooo!!!
---
is that what you were hoping for??
---
Ok thanks.  I'll have to test it out again.
---
hahahhahaha bethesda is soooo fucked
---
Honestly I hear about so many people quitting but I think that with the sales people are also joining. Most of the people who quit , I ***think***, are higher levels who are bored... and tired of the lag/disconnects/freezes. But I see so many people just now starting the game. If I had to guess I'd say a third of the people quit?
---
If you make power armour more rare, people then will have to have standard armour along.  
---
Until we're given a bigger stash budget, F-that.  No one wants to have to manage and repair both types of armour.
---
Then don't, the world is full of options.
---
Fair enough. All I know is I haven‚Äôt been on in about a month cause all the issues. 
---
Schucks, I someone didn't notice that you had posted a video link. Thanks for the response to my comment.
---
Awesome! I've been needlessly hording these thinking they could cure my mutation and just needlessly living with all kinds of nasty diseases. This pleases me.
---
Did PS4 standard edition pre-order get any free atoms?
---
If yes....mine never turned up!
---
Getting over that FO4 mentality is tough.  We were spoiled to be able to store EVERYTHING and to use a Perk to fast travel even when overencumbered.
---
This is created using a bug with campfires, so this will most likely be considered and exploit. Odd to see positive reinforcement from you regarding the build type.
---
I personally love what you can do with it, but its abusing a build mechanic. We should be able to do this without campfire glitching.
---
Does it have to be rad free? I go with razorgrain soup. It's easy to make, can be farmed in your own camp (1 each of: Boiled Water, Wood, Raizorgrain) has 30 HP, 10 Disease Resist, Food 10%, Water 15%... all at only 5 Rads. Combine that with the Herbivore mutation which provides you double the benefits and Sun Kissed 2 perk to quickly regen radiation damage between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. You're all set!
---
*Item Name:* FEV Serum.  
---
*Description:* Set Intelligence to 1, set Strength and Endurance to 15. There is no cure.
---
Sell your stuff you don't need on the 76 marketplace. I make about 70% of my caps selling stuff. Stuff you don't think anyone would ever use but they do. all that extra ammo that you've been piling up so that you have three thousand rounds of 5 mm ammo that's an easy 1-2k in caps. 
---
yeah tends to be in favor of ghouls and scortched. when it is super mutants there is always a 3 star legendary though. 
---
I picked up several bags of stuff the other day inside the whitesprings and moved to the depot so they wouldn't go to waste. I check and will take stuff that I need, and if I have stuff to drop, I will. Some people will come along and take all the stuff and either vendor it or just leave. I have seen that a couple of times. 
---
Its already a fraction of launch numbers. When anthem comes out bethesda will post something like 'uhh were fixing 2 bugs (and breaking 17 more things) in a patch in three weeks!'
---
A player wanted to capture my factory, he was a melee user, So i jumped down to work shop, thinking i would shoot him a few times, then jump back up with marsupial. First, the bloodied glitch happened, which bugs with adrenaline cancelling out the bloody effect. So he soaked up a few shots. When he got close, i jumped and marsupial stopped working. Thank God I have speed demon... I ran for my life and the love of my junk.
---
I later came around and killed him with a sniper, but this glitch moment really tightened my butt cheeks lol.
---
It's their attempt to stop server hopping
---
Had one person do this to me about 5 seconds into getting into a vendor.  I just took my sweet ass time.  Jump in front of me and slap me all you want, I'm not moving until I'm done.  Now, ask politely if you can have a turn?  I'll stop what I'm doing and let you have at it.  I'm in no hurry.
---
Preach!  
---
The day the patch that added (KNOWN) to the vendor inventory, I scored so much free shit it was unreal. Dumped a crapload of plans, too (gotta balance the karma, yeah?).
---
Theyre a rare drop on workshop defends
---
With my lever action and stealth I was able to burst through a legendary mob‚Äôs healing bug, but only once out of many times.  In this case, he was standing below me while I was perched on an awning in Whitespring so I was able to pump off a 3.5x mr sandman initial shot, followed by a critical headshot.  Even though he started healing after the first shot I did enough damage with the fast fire rate in VATS to burn through it.  But this bug really needs to be fixed, I often waste all my initial burst and then I‚Äôm in ‚ÄúDanger‚Äù without sneak bonus.  
---
Yeah, Half my armour has the sentinel affect, 1 with assassin sentinel and a the rest are 1-2 star unyielding, but I'm currently like over 100 my weight limit plus full stash so eheh, tied to a my Excavator PA, also just checking which perk cards i don't need to get some for admantium skeleton, but I'll think ponder on the defence perks. Thx for the suggestion!
---
I always play with friends. At least 3-4 always. 
---
We‚Äôve had crashes and issues. But never to such we gave up playing. 
---
Now bring on the hate because I said this. 
---
They still sneak up on me. I'm on the cliffs near Whitesprings and one wandered in when I was in bed trying to recover some HP. Plus my camera faces the wall. That breathing is creepy.
---
Wanted to make a post about this for some time now. 
---
For me selling ammo is the main staple of Fallout economy.
---
To kill men, take their bullets and convert them to gold. 
---
That's how it's always been.
---
And dropping ammo on the ground hurts every time.
---
It was, just barely with a TSE version. Now even the TSE version is garbo since it got hit with the 3‚òÖ god roll Super Sledge-nerfhammer.
---
I was recently plaiing with 2 other Friends and everything was fine 
---
Literally all of the items in the production terminal are showing known. I have none available for purchase and the under armor isn‚Äôt on the list
---
I'm still looking for a level 40 or 50 Furious Auto Grenade Launcher (1 star is fine as long as it is Furious). When I join in on SBQ fights I usually but out my Vampire's Auto Grenade Launcher (with demo 5 and grenadier 2) and fire off as many rounds as it takes. Each shot takes off a noticeably chunk of of her health so I do feel like I am contributing. Also, I found a Suppressor's Explosive Plasma Gatling gun which does surprisingly well against the SBQ.
---
People who actually played the game already figured this out 2 months ago
---
Excavators lowest level is 35.
---
1k on your person?  1k total?  
---
They imposed an absolute limit of 1500 over your max carry weight.   Seems fine.  Even with weight reduction gear that‚Äôs a hard limit that eventually renders their character useless well before their old duped total.  
---
&gt; inventory management and the other hour was specifically hunting for plastic so I could bulk some more junk up and sell to a vendor.. So I could do a little more inventory management.
---
My life.
---
Hopefully it will be easier to stack foundations and such so one can create stuff like without any tricks like this in the future.
---
Anyways, excellent job! üëç
---
I carry so much junk that I totally avoid random players as well. Hate to lose so much.
---
Ive collected about 250 drop holotapes and never used a single one. so useless.
---
Well at Least it‚Äôs not just me. Guess I will have to suffer for a month or two until they get around to fixing it
---
2 hours or so? 
---
I 2nd this. It's such a let down for what could be a cool fight. 
---
I think this could be solved with just a few basic mechanical changes. Such as add Sam turrets near the Fisher sites or the ability to craft or repair them. I know there are some close to the queen but not quite close enough to where I've ever fought her. That way the waves of enemy she calls and serves a purpose as they will attack the turrets on the ground forcing some players to defend those turrets. 
---
This adds extra damage to her as a nice basic mechanic to the fight that is simple enough to figure out at a quick glance and saves on bullets without making a fight necessarily too easy were you don't have to contribute. And it slightly gives low level players that just want to join the event something to do even though they should not be there in my opinion. 
---
Dude stop. Individual weight limits mean fuck all to dupers. All they will do is spread the goods across multiple accounts. All your suggestion does is make things harder for the average player 
---
/u/Ladydevann this is a great example of what can be done when you dont give us restrictions to our camps! 
---
I gotta say, I've never run very short on violet flux. Prime has 3 species of violet flux, and flash ferns are tied for most common with the flourescent flux mushrooms in the Willy Wonka Grove.
---
Whitespring isn't so lucrative to my knowledge, but I've only gone there looking for Cobalt.
---
Good luck!
---
I think on your dupe point, having 10.000 explosive weapons increases your possibility of unlocking the mods. I also think it would drive more duplication to again get those mods. 
---
&gt;It seems to be based on the number of people that tagged the enemy. If I'm going solo, I never run into it...
---
This is my experience as well.  It almost never happens when alone.
---
White Knight in AGI
---
Since Fallout 76 is just one or two steps from just being Fallout 4 Online (#ShotsFired) I cant imagine why I cant pull legendary mods from one weapon and add it to another. I know the modding community did it. So I don't know why Bethesda can't add it to the game.   
---
We could always play it safe. Not allow players to do it but a Vendor Bot can be middle person. For X CAPs Vendor Bot removed Legendary from weapon. It could always one of those RNG things. RNG + Caps = Chance of removing Legionary MOD from weapon or armor.   
---
Or if we talk Real World Money... RNG + ATOMs = Better Chance of removing Legionary MOD from weapon or armor  
---
Then we flip it. RNG + CAPs/ATOMs allow you to Add MOD to Weapon Type.  
---
Weapon and MOD go together. Melee MODs stay with Melee. Guns MODs stay with Guns I understand middle ground will happen.  
---
Higher the STAR the more it cost.  
---
Please see Black Desert Online for details on how this all works or a better example of the idea. At least maybe I can have some Armor and Weapons I really want. 
---
They come about every three weeks, right? Last one was on the 19th so... Guessing this week
---
I'm having fun leveling alts till their builds are finished. If they ever decide to make endgame fun I'll have plenty of different ways to play it. If not, at least I had fun leveling.
---
Does the brawling mod work for arm armors? It doesn't add to the existing weapon damage number =(
---
this is where the strangler creatures originate from what i understand
---
Excavator starts at 25. 
---
Was it by crafting or scrapping ?
---
I've decided to buy it if it is still available
---
I was wrong then. 
---
I told ladydevann about this a few hours after after the most recent update, still haven't heard any news and the latest hotfix didn't even mention it. Looks like this is just something we have to deal with again
---
Nah, it was over the Power Armor Edition and the fiasco over the canvas bag being a nylon bag. Their way of saying sorry and trying to make up for it.
---
I wouldn't say it's any better or worse than it normally is.  I feel like server disconnects have been out of control lately - just total, out-of-the-blue disconnects with no "Server Not Responding" warnings or anything.  It's especially frustrating because it seems like fewer people are playing now, fewer nukes are being launched overall, and yet stability is *down*.
---
I always dump excess stuff at cash registers as most of the vendor locations have them, with the exception of maybe one train station or so?
---
Forthcoming.
---
Grinding. Like a mofo. 1400 caps a day from vendors, plus the very occasional sale of a plan of weapon to another player.
---
Yes.  But not until we can lock items from sale/scrap.
---
‚ÄúPathetic‚Äù would be a way to describe it in one word. ‚ÄúGame killer‚Äù would be a title to give it. 
---
Opting out of PVP should make you not lose your junk. I must have died at least 3-4 times so far fighting the SBQ, and when i pop into deathcam theres like a single scorched standing over my body (cool thanks team), reload and run back to my bag and its gone. Super fun. Then i get a Vent, a useless PA plan and junk. Awesome.
---
Im low on camp space so i carry tons of ammo with me. It weighs pretty much nothing with bandolier 2.
---
Im a walking ammo vending machine atm. 
---
I hoard nonperishables
---
Ahh. That's why I never got it. My agility is like level 3. Thank you sir. 1 cookie for you. 
---
Yes add me
---
Hey guess what was datamined? It turns out the perks were initially a part of the atom store. I believe backlash from the whole EA fiasco caused a change in this, possibly lunch boxes as well.
---
The reason is story. Vault 76 is the first vault to re-open after the bombs fell. In later DLC, the other vaults in the area will open as well and it will be an event.
---
Yes god forbid anyone expect to get what they are promised and pay for. How dare them?
---
You don't make any sense.
---
Thank you for dropping paper bags full of legendaries. Sincerely,
---
A player who still uses two legendaries that I found in a paper bag at Whitespring Station
---
I have Obese Jesus in TESO and I was able to change it so people could see it. I think it is a MMO type thing
---
You could always build a port-o-potty given the plans.  But yes, it is funny that there isn't an intact toilet as far as I can tell.
---
Whats your psn?
---
The only standard edition that got free Atoms was Xbox. Some deal with Microsoft, also why the BETA was available on Xbox first.
---
Sent an invite. Carcass_stew
---
Checked my ledger at lunch. 20k ea for marsupial and speed demon from modus 12k for bird bones grounded and healing factor from another player. Almost to cap max again. Wondering if I could recoup caps from twisted muscle or if I should move on to ultracite mod plans.
---
Not if the level caps of the perks remain. Example you can't get Sun Kissed even out of a pack until level 45.
---
You do, you auto buy them with XP
---
Carcass_stew
---
Its easiest to get in worlds with your friends if you do the following. 
---
Step 1: Have all 4 players leave team.
---
Step 2: Have all 4 players crash their game. 
---
Step 3: While everyone's in the Menu, add each other to a team. 
---
Step 4: Have party leader click play. 
---
Step 5: Wait for a world to queue and your good to go! 
---
90% of the ones I have to drop are useless.  A melee wep with the stalker effect for instance..what is the point of that?
---
I've been doing it wrong for months. I only found out about this last week. :(
---
Apparently you can use low % fusion cores to craft ultracite fusion cores at 100%
---
Cry me a river... 
---
You must like getting bent over and forcefully fucked.
---
By the way a really great defensive structure is to place a foundation sticking out of the ground as much as possible, then places punji boards on all for edges¬π and two turrets on each opposite corners. Mongrels, wolfs, cave crickets, mirelurkers will all get attracted by the turrets but will be prevented from attacking them due to the interaction of clipping and punji boards. 
---
¬πTwo large ones and eight small ones will do it. 
---
I am surprised artillery worked.   There was a big camp across the tracks at Charleston station. Someone before me built three artillery at the power plant and I claimed it. I then tagged/smoked the camp and must‚Äôve shot what 12+ rounds into the center. After the barrage was over I ran around at the camp and there was no damage.   I just assumed that they couldn‚Äôt do it. Was it because it was a workstation built artillery?
---
Side question. Are you saying that if I have more than one player I can share items between them? 
---
Na, if they really want to troll they would want to do it in adventure servers. It‚Äôs not trolling if they do it in the survival servers where nobody but griefers would go. The survival servers are just as useless as the patches that moved the game backwards. 
---
Not my point, we all should get what we are promised. Bashing Bethesda, or any company, because of an inconvenience that they correct... stupid human response. Ever pay a bill late? Why hell, let the electric company post about you on their blog... I'm sick of people complaining about this game and still playing it... suck it up or go play FortNite. You can't complain you hate being a drug addict and complain the crack is of low quality. :)
---
Did the 4 people groups + Guild took over a server. We never crashed. DARN son, When we nuked the THOT Queen, we became laggy. 
---
It seems they have to be aggroed, Bethesda should let them track enemies the moment they enter the building area.
---
Dude logged alot more time than you. Bye. 
---
Or if you're going for a rifleman build, the Bandoleer perk reduces ammo weight by a lot and you can just hold it. 2,500 .38, 10mm, 5mm, .45 only weights 1 pound per ammo type 
---
Don't you worry someone will comment shortly about how they value your input and will pass this info along.  
---
Family more important than a game. Chill out. Get laid. Make a baby. Then come on here and moan lol
---
Added. Coming to me? Or am I coming to u?
---
‚ÄúHotfix‚Äù in my line of business means you don a cal suit and work on shit live. Although the crazy fuckers will bypass the cal suit and still do the work live. Very dangerous and we try to avoid it. 
---
Neither do we. 
---
There are three other sealed vaults to be found around the map.  Future plans.
---
That would be awesome for sure!
---
It requires 2 consoles and accounts but yea. You can also place in containers if you have a friend in the world you can spawn to
---
Again... if it makes you butt hurt then go play something else. They are working on it. :)
---
most common places are whitesprings and westek. I find a few legendary in watoga consistently.
---
I bought a tse handmade today and jeez its not fun. Every hit i do, it heals and damages them at the same time. Im wasting so much ammo. Theres something with Two shot or explosive that need a quick fix. 
---
So, total noob question: How on earth do I beat Father Gascoigne? I keep either getting caugh on the tombstones (mainly while trying to dodge away) or being way too close/far to do anything meaningful. Any tips would be appreciated. 
---
I just want to commune with some goey Great Old Ones :(
---
Yeah camps will be nothing but a mobile gun and healing  base. 
---
Thank you a lot.
---
That sounds much better than what I do - pick the ammo up anyways for absolutely no reason!
---
I feel like I could be the strongest being ever and still want to run away screaming from wendigos! I‚Äôve finally learnt to stare deathclaws in the face, except the ones at Whitespring obviously that I run to the sentry bots.
---
You sound like you‚Äôd make a great teammate (ahem, bodyguard), do you ever team up? I‚Äôm on Xbox and wouldn‚Äôt complain if I saw you around! Maybe to tell tales over a cup of tea?
---
&gt;Mole miners !! They drop missile launchers assault rifles shotguns. Then sell to vendors.
---
I mentioned them the last time this question came up. Clearing out Blackwater Mine and the surrounding area will easily net you enough caps to clean out at least 2-3 vendors, and it only takes 20 mintues. 
---
Add me TheMeiserVader
---
It does reward you- by the enemy dying faster.
---
Run carnivore, and a few purifiers and you‚Äôll be fine. Rad worms will buff up Carnivore to like 60 percent per piece of meat and about 33 for each water
---
Thank you !! And Yes !!
---
 Oh damn I hear that!! Ya I bulk everything an sell constantly to be safe.
---
They usually come out on Thursdays
---
Yup
---
Come to me if u can
---
lmao! I raid factories all day long, but i have never seen amything as crazy and funny as this. I hope this doesn't become a thing.
---
Looking my self
---
Sorry I am on PC
---
True, though I much prefer splatcat to splatapult. :P
---
I would definitely recommend it :). Apart from being a gorgeous game, the story really goes places and the collectibles all help to either add fun sprinkles on top of the story cake or function to unlock cool stuff (or both). 
---
Also, FOOKIN ROBUTS!!!
---
Nothing better to do?
---
Try blocking someone random before you sign out. its not supposed to put you on servers with your blocked players
---
In your world now. Fast traveling
---
This is awesome! Thanks! 
---
Nerfs are just as necessary as buffs. 
---
You don't need to fight the ghouls, just slap on a hazmat suit and go gather flux. If you have green thumb you can easily harvest 100+ flux in a matter of minutes just by gathering the red hot blooms, raydodendrons, and rad berries that spawn in the relatively safe areas near the hotel entrances. 
---
On the off chance a ghoul does agro you, just high tail it to the nearest sentry bot and let him deal with it.
---
I hate to be that guy but have you repaired/uninstalled/reinstalled/run as admin? I did all that crap and it fixed a couple of things. Game still lags like hell and I still get discoed but at least I could fast travel again
---
wow you saved it for last? i saved up like week 2 for that plan
---
Were these all found at Fort Defiance or are they found elsewhere?
---
Wall pieces will automatically orient themselves when attached to a floor or over a wall.  The solution is to add a temporary floor on both sides of the wall so that you are placing it on the seam between two floor segments.  When you do, you can turn it around if you wish.  Then just remove the extra floor.
---
(Haven't played KH3, so I can't comment, but neither game would be a bad choice. Whatever you choose, lmk what you think!)
---
I don't go to workshops on a daily basis, but it ain't the first time I've seen that... sorta why I'm addressing it before it becomes a real issue...
---
That would result in the average SPECIAL value being just below 11 as opposed to just above 7. That's quite a difference.
---
&gt;Set Intelligence to 1, set Strength and Endurance to 15.
---
Well my second dweller is already a SUper Mutant.
---
They all left and went back to other games. 2 said how do you play this ? Didn't know what to say. 4
---
Why do I even still play ? Fallout and 2,3 etc ? Love it. But when Far Cry comes out I'll be gone.
---
Crack open the beers then !! Screw this
---
The 100+ times I was disconnected while clearing a silo, just after launching a nuke, or during a nuke I launched (while playing solo) over the last 3 months. 
---
Thanks for replying that quick, you seem to know alot about all this.
---
So is sentinel builds still viable and what perks etc.. make them op (or was this build nerfed with the tse)
---
I saw some guy using a laser rifle the other day, and immediately ran over and gave him 2700 fusion cells.
---
Jokes on him
---
As far as I know the colored outfits are only event drops, but I'm honestly unsure. All the hats and the two common outfits can definitely be found in the Asylum via spawns.
---
I believe they've already said they're not doing mod tools for it (though remains to be seen how moddable it is... Battletech had no mod support, but was super easy to mod).  I imagine this was purely a financial decision, as Obsidian doesn't exactly have the fat bank it once did.  This one also seems to be a bit more linear in scope, so modding would be a little weird.  Think if Borderlands happened several hundreds of years in Fallouts future.
---
Oh,  continuing to play 76 after work since I am not a banned duper is the plan. 
---
Thanks a lot
---
Yes.  Ive gotten Serem Recipes and some pretty good Legendaries from her. 
---
If your on ps4 and would like a 100% full SBQ carry i can help. Messege me on PS4. 
---
Yeah, I'm really bored with it honestly, just passing time till anthem. All my friends are getting it so I'm risking it too. No one I know plays this. @_@
---
Accepted. Thank you!
---
I iike that idea! :)
---
Here is one I made :))) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inHwTRfP_U0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inHwTRfP_U0)
---
yup
---
They had an Inside the Vault on these days  
---
January 29 (wednesday as part of the patch)
---
January 24 (thursday)
---
January 17 (thursday)
---
January  9 (wednesday)
---
January 1 (tuesday)
---
There was two patches in January. 
---
Don't cheat
---
No prob. Thank u
---
the enemies can shoot them down with range. It's annoying lol.
---
It affects melee now too.
---
Indeed. LoneVaultWanderer was somewhat helpful to confirm support were still looking at my ticket a few days ago. Although hasn‚Äôt responded to my recent DM‚Äôs asking for info now the time has lapsed
---
Obsidian was responsible for all that is good in NV... Beth was responsible for saying "Yeah, yeah, that all sounds great, now get it shipped in 3 weeks."
---
We'll pass that message along...
---
How long does it take to get running? I know that the vampire community was super dedicated with fan patches, so if it isn't too hard to get working, I may check it out!
---
That sounds right. Thanks for confirming.
---
Let‚Äôs over-repaired the over-repaired the over-repaired the over-repaired the over-repaired .............. over-repairception. 
---
This is done to stop farming.
---
Because it was coded by interns.
---
I like to run around Watoga looking for legendary protectrons. Got my Troubleshooter's Axe, TSE Tesla Rifle, and an Instagating Gauss Rifle that way.
---
Yeah, there was a remarkable decline in players on xbox after patch 5 hit.. I think a few of them stuck it out a couple of days, but that hotfix that messed up looting when a lot of people are around drove the ones on their last straw.
---
That's a feature, not a bug.
---
You do start in a vault.
---
The only one not to have a vault at start is new vegas. You start in a pedophile's house.
---
Don‚Äôt be narrow minded bruh. You honestly think Bethesda don‚Äôt make mistakes? It LITERALLY says in their email about it to contact them and submit an appeal if you‚Äôve been false flagged in error - which I can assure you I have. Not that I need to prove it to some random witch hunter on the internetüëçüèº
---
How do you even get underarmod mods or underarmro in general and does it work with PA
---
White Knight.  
---
I would love for someone to RP as Edna from Incredibles and be like "have you thought of mosaic tiles darling?" "This floor is so taboo darling."
---
I've found some of the hats just laying around.
---
Ahh, that's when i usually take a break to rock a piss or something.. if you're in a rush i could wait forever.  
---
/petty
---
Got any duplicates to trade?
---
Any specific event? I've been looking for the outfits for a few days.
---
I think it's going to be great, but don't expect something too Fallout.  I believe it's shaping up to be more hub oriented, like Borderlands, but with a lot more story.
---
[deleted]
---
Is destiny 2 any good at the moment and does it have an active player base?
---
For a lot of us over level 100, it's been the patch 5 nerf and the lack of communication from Bethesda about what to expect in the future of the game. I know a lot who waited a while after patch 5 but with no communication, we drifted to other games or tackle our back catalogues. Reason I still haunt this Reddit is that am reluctant to abandon a game that I enjoyed a lot. Bethesda can see the server numbers decline, but seem reluctant to express plans for the future to keep older players interest. 
---
It was a sad time when I streamlined my stash, scrapped my crops and retired my camp to hopefully return in the future.
---
Rushing to max level isn‚Äôt what this game is about. Take your time, enjoy the journey.
---
Oh, so you are heavily compromising? I think 1000 is a good number too.
---
Morgantown Highschool is a plastic pool too! Take the back entrance to the sports hall. There is tons of those pumpkin-lanterns, bowling pins, golf balls and  also plastic plates on a table. In the school cafeteria and in the corridors you find some stuff too. Easy make around 100 plastic with one looting :) 
---
Decon arch. It removes your rads. Powerful, and convienent, but it costs 1 of every stable flux to repair.
---
I think was caused by their fix to Bulk items not being used for crafting/repairing automatically. I had this happen to me as well. It worked fine initially, then they messed it up and now the fix messed it up again. 
---
Bulk items should only scrap with needed for crafting/repairing or when specifically selected for scrapping
---
Make sure none of your friends is wearing the targeting HUD on their PA. It's known to cause major glitches and crash everyone in the area.
---
Nope, it's not.
---
Good to hear that, it works wonders for defending workshops 
---
I do this also.  I have a TSE shotgun build.
---
If you are lower lvl or have issues killing the Sentry Bots, stash all your junk, unequip your PA and armor, sneak crit them until dead, grab a core, repeat until you die, respawn at CAMP.  Nothing gets broken, no junk is lost, and you have Fusion Cores.
---
Leave ~~Britney~~ Bethesda alone! üò¢
---
I don‚Äôt think giving 5 dollars worth of fake video game money is correcting anything. How about a AAA company releasing a functioning game? Everyone that paid full price for the game has every right to be angry about it. Unfortunately, when you pay a bill late, you pay a late fee. I believe Bethesda owes a pretty hefty late fee at this point. Nearly 3 months have passed since release and the game is still no better. In fact, it‚Äôs getting worse.
---
 It was ready for me. Its a Bethesda Fallout game and I have been playing them for a long time.
---
 Sure there are issues but so what. Nothing game breaking and frankly trivial really. Because you get upset about the various Legendary problems concerns me not at all. I sell em' and make my own crap largely. 
---
 I hunt Scorchbeasts for sport and the game is cake for me.
---
I never got mine either
---
I didn't find it to be that much worse, but I run the perks for increased food and water satiety, and the dog food perk.
---
Unfortunately I couldn't back out of the Enclave shower before I lost the mutation.

You sir are a genus. Or maybe im just an idiot. Anyways thanks!
---
I killed a wanted lvl 8 player when I was about lvl 15. 
---
I was just getting rid of his wanted status for him. I followed him on the map to Overseers camp trying to give him his junk back, but he and his lvl 3 friend (guess they were in a party)  started attacking me. They wouldn't stop, and it pissed me off cause I was just trying to be nice, so I killed them both... repeatedly.
---
Tldr: there are certain situations where some under lvl 5 can engage in PvP
---
Because ‚Äúit just works‚Äù lol
---
That's when my body tells me to rock a piss, make some food or check my phone.. while i occupy the vendor.
---
There aren‚Äôt issues with unlootable ash piles anymore correct? I gave up on this because of that 
---
This gun WAS amazing in Fo4, you just pointed it at what you wanted dead and they where already melted down 
---
3.	Absolutely yes.
---
Just running around the streets in Watoga or in any specific buildings? 
---
Vault 94 opened for a bit before vault 76 did but they resealed themselves for some unknown reason ( according to something I heard on a holotape or read somewhere in game)
---
NO DRAPES!
---
Dog food and 4 small purifiers keep me going fine. I only supplement here and there when dog food is hard to find. In fact I have so much water that it has become a major income generator for me.  
---
I might have an extra one. Are you on Xbox?
---
Wish I had . It was a lot cheaper back then I'm sure
---
they added a second loading that fixes nothing. make loading longer and added new bugs like frozen on assets load and soft locks. Even the second loading fix is Gerry rigged af. You see  a couple of game frames in between them flashing in front of you.
---
Edit, I was looking at op's post and it's already getting tons of downvotes. some people here are strange with the downvotes.. 
---
Selling them would just feel wrong.  It would harm their reputation further.  However, allowing us to TRADE cards would enhance the social aspect of this game immensely.  
---
Think of how nice it would be to give away cards that are simply clogging up your deck, that can't be used in your build.  Like you really need 3 maxed copies of Lead Belly.
---
 Have you ever played a Fallout game before?
---
Seriously!  Ammo, cigarettes, and toilet paper should be the new gold.
---
That's not a bad thing considering the perks we have in this game. Like back in fallout 4 you needed 5 points in either perception or agility to max out rifleman or commando, respectively, to do 100% more damage but here you need 9 points to get the weapons up to 60%. Plus with all the weight reducing perks the cap at 50 just makes for a weak build.
---
I've been playing last couple hours with no problems. You on PS4, Xbox or PC?
---
Thanks for the info. By the way a neat trick that you might find useful is to put that arch on foundation of your choice along with a generator if it needs one all hooked up, then blueprint the whole structure including the foundation. 
---
At which point you can store the lot by storing the foundation while standing on it and replace it any time vie the blueprint. 
---
how much are they now?
---
When I was lower lvl, I used to take over workshops and defend them once.  Nets you XP and plans for very little resources spent (ammo and mats to repair your weapons and armor).  There are tons of low lvl workshops where the enemies aren't tough.  Take a few and server hop.  It's not that fast, but it works.
---
This is true.   Happens for semi auto fire. 
---
Not so much for hunting rifle.  
---
Yeah I think it sucks how people are getting banned like that. A buddy of mine got banned out of nowhere and they have yet to get back to him in any way. It is discouraging when I know of a bunch of people still able to play who have cheated/duped without being banned but people are getting banned for no apparent reason 
---
As a member of the silent majority,
---
dude, but don't you have anything else to do, like shower or eat?
---
As someone who spends nearly all of my time decorating my camp, my husband's camp, and my brother's camp: Yes please! It always makes me a little sad when I stumble across a little wooden shack with everything stuffed in one corner, wires going every which way. It's your home, not a garden shed!  
---
Speaking of making things pretty, does anyone know where one might find the plans for the cat paintings? I need all of them.
---
It would alter the power level of players and require some rebalancing, but it would also allow for character development past level 50, which is far too low to accommodate the player base.
---
It‚Äôs just server lag, and your video is pretty strong proof of that. Everyone keeps saying it‚Äôs a new damage bug, no it‚Äôs just a visual lag between your client thinking you damaged something, and the server letting you know you didn‚Äôt.
---
Server lag, it‚Äôs a known issue.
---
Yes.  I don‚Äôt think they ever changed the stealth system to work in multiplayer.  I gave up on my stealth rifle character for that reason. 
---
Whitesprings loop, from the golf club, through the buildings north of that, continue on the road/houses to the left of the road till you run out of houses.  Loop back around to the parking lot/garage area (theres a scrapping bench in there to help), finish up the 3 houses on the way back to the golf club.  Loop complete.  I loot everything on that route, scrap at the bench I mentioned, sell what I can to the whitesprings station vendor, drop the rest in a sack on my way out.
---
WesTek is good for XP, but I don't get nearly as many legendaries there as I do in whitesprings, but it does have a higher frequency of 3star legendaries... just takes longer to clear out.  Pretty easy building/area to clear.
---
Uranium Fever is less desirable now as most of it's legendaries cap at out level 40.  TSE was hella strong so even a level 35 was worth having... now that they've lost their power, its a less common place to go for legendaries.  But you do get 3 guaranteed legendaries there.  Also, tons of scrap from looting everything.
---
Any time you're on the vendor circuit to get your daily caps, always check out the robots in watoga, often a few legendaries there.  Make sure you complete mayor for a day so the robots leave you alone and you just pop the legs and leave.
---
That would suck because if intake my perks off I'm well over 1000...I just carry alot of meds and ammo
---
You 2 clearly are not Fallout fans at all. Ammo should be twice as heavy, unsellable, unscrapable, and should do next to no damage. 
---
It depends on the item, but generally you cannot place atom shop items in someone else's camp. 
---
good idea, i'd like to have someone improving my camp (and get paid for it of course). would also like bethesda introducing inner walls :)
---
Assassin and ghoul slayer cannot be on the same weapon...
---
*humans* ? what you do for *them* ? damn son, that's some zuckerberg talk right there
---
Introducing a turret objective is s great idea I have seen thrown around. 
---
Also, I have seen scorchbeast traps mentioned too, to add more strategy into getting her down onto the ground, for longer. 
---
Better loot pool, and more interesting fight mechanics is something this game desperately needs, considering that the Queen is the only end gsme content....
---
Oh wow.  I looked up the material needed to craft the cores... I think it will be much easier just to take over the workshop to get the cores then to do the nuke runs. 
---
Chill man
---
PS4
---
whitespring definitely..sometimes theres 5 at once!! areas like harpers is great to grind at but you are lucky if you see more than one on that server
---
Not everyone banned is a duper. They have a good many banned because of Bethesda screwing up
---
Ooh, that's right. Fort Defiance is great for XP, junk, and straight jackets.
---
Considering there are so many weapons that are just straight up garbage, sometimes even almost entire categories of them, it'd seem that's obviously not the case in the current state of the game.
---
It's a hypothetical post almost like seeing into the future of what PVP servers will become with just 2 spawn points I'm beginning to think the programmers at BGS have never played a multi-player game.
---
I have plague walker and carnivore among many other mutations. It makes for lots of nice, free of effort meat to munch on. 
---
So can you respec SPECIAL points past level 50? I'm confused
---
I think that would be a good idea, because i have too much Fusion core all time so too much carry weight used.. In my opinion that would be nice but it would be a rare plan really rare, or idk a thing possible easy but a "budget" for all the charge fusion core like 5 per character or 10 maximum.
---
Dead game is dead.
---
If you think your build is done at 50, then you're doing it wrong. 
---
Wish I could use cannibalize in power armor...
---
I didn't think perk sharing used calculated stats.
---
So you could also theoretically make a camp that can't be wrecked by griefers or NPC's though? That is really appealing.  Have only had my base attacked once(and no, I don't make my camp at Whitesprings), but this would be a handy way to resolve that issue. May have to explore this on my next free evening.
---
This is very helpful. Thank you! Just so I am clear and don't mess this up. 
---
My 'new' Xbone X becomes my 'home' Xbone using my 'Gold' account, and then I can use my 'old' Xbone S to log in as a 'Silver' account?
---
If I don't have to pay a monthly fee to maintain a mule account, then I might not be gifting my Xbone S to anyone anytime soon. I just got myself 5 x 600 storage!!
---
Because they want you to travel everywhere by walking and not by fast travel. Thinking fast travel in an online game would work the same way as a single player game is funny.  Loading information from a server isn't the same as loading it all from a HHD. 
---
And through-wall conduits!
---
It's easier to point fingers and say someone else did something wrong then to look into the actual evidence and do anything about your broken video game but please continue I'll listen 
---
That's cruel 
---
Oh okay, thanks! My problem with pitcher plants is that I‚Äôll approach them and they just won‚Äôt open at all. I know sometimes it‚Äôs completely on me, since I‚Äôll fight a SB and just run next to them without noticing, but a lot of the time the just don‚Äôt open at all. I‚Äôll start really farming the other plants next time around.
---
Give that intern who has to deal with updating the game a break. He applied for the social media management position and now has to fix this conundrum. 
---
It works well with carnivore.   You can eat the meat raw for like 40% food bar regen.
---
Glad to meet you Granny. I turn 69 this year and I am happy to know that I am not the only codger playing this game.   
---
Are you wifi or LAN? 
---
Was also finally able to get the plans as well on Xbox, after checking the location every time I logged on, took me 15-20 times but was finally able to get them.
---
Ghouls at whitesprings drop tons of cloth junk
---
I would absolutely love to be able to scrap ammo for gunpowder and lead, like in FNV. 
---
Ammo is so goddamn plentiful in all kinds of various calibers that I'd love to be able to turn it into 5mm for my Gatling...
---
I have an extra brown
---
If they let you use Atoms for this purpose then people will freak out and call it a pay-to-win gimmick.
---
&gt;Reading is helpful friend. I said exclude workshops.
---
So you did. My mistake, I was quick to reply when I realized how ignorant your idea was. My bad. 
---
&gt;Does anyone even actually lock their doors on their homes?
---
Uh yes. 
---
&gt;If the wanted person can get in, so can the person hunting them. It's not like you can lock someone else's doors.
---
Understanding the game mechanics is helpful, pal. 
---
Player A and Player B are on a team. Player A becomes wanted, and hides inside Player B's locked house. Player B is in passive mode. Player A can freely open player B's doors because they're on a team but other players can not, or they too become wanted.
---
Or, for extra security, Player A just goes to player's B camp and walls himself in. Anything he builds becomes Player B's property.
---
Your idea is flawed.
---
I go to Ash Heap. There are a ton of generators around the digger, and to the south/south west. There also are a few frames that spawn around there too for more cores, and you can sell the parts for a few extra caps.
---
Yes that‚Äôs correct. You could move a point from endurance to luck or which ever you want to change. Does that make sense?
---
I still cook the meat for the tiny extra XP and extra food regen
---
It would be cruel of me to accidentally kill those poor lvl 1 creatures without eating them at the very least
---
I don‚Äôt have exacts but most people that left are probably waiting for the elusive modding support or private servers. At least I am. 
---
Yeah, Mutation serums was the only plan that didn't go up. I'd love to buy mutation serum recipes for 12k from another player, but I tried several times and nobody responded. If you're in a party with the charisma +2 for each new party member, have hard bargain 3, have the mothman eggs, and berry mentats you can get it down to 17.6k even if you have very low charisma. I've only boosted Charisma to 15, so I'm not sure if it goes lower than that though. 
---
That's a fair argument lol
---
It has to do with radworms. For me when its gone i have to relog üò§
---
that exists since fo4, advanced connectors, can buy it at some vendors.
---
I throw fusion cores on the ground because I find them way faster than I use them.
---
You have ~220lbs of fusion cores? Jeez, how do you have stash space 
---
Yet an annoying bug in this game
---
I think a PVP indicator would be a good addition. Some sort of notification, maybe in your buff bar, that would show you are a legal target for PVP. That would stop a lot of the misunderstandings, I think. 
---
Thanks for the physical copy tip. The new Xbone is already taking some change out of my pocket. I'd like to keep what's left.
---
You had a good run, def worth the money you paid. Hopefully once its all fixed up you can come back
---
This is why I need an interior designer.
---
This kind of stuff is why it would be helpful for some sort of global/server chat that would be broadcast to all current players. Otherwise, I find myself sending messages over Xbox to let others know I‚Äôm about to fill those containers up with ammo and plans.
---
I suspect that anyone running by triggers them for everyone, but who knows.
---
Reminds me of building foundation walls in fallout4. By using the stairs block. You could stack foundations up. 
---
Yup. I bet I‚Äôll get loads of responses accusing me of being a ‚Äúcheater exploiter scrub duper POS‚Äù but I genuinely have played the game the way it was meant to be played. Never duped or glitched or what have you. I know a few people also who are currently banned pending investigation - seems to be even if you‚Äôre reported you get banned. Ban first ask questions later I‚Äôd guess smh
---
That's a nice problem to have. I must be doing something wrong lol. I haven't thrown away a fusion core since they reduced their spawn rate in fusion generators.
---
I haven‚Äôt needed to repair it at all due to my base location(it‚Äôs on the border of the map, but I‚Äôll keep that in mind.
---
#WAH
---
Workshops being a bonus to come back to after farming out in the wasteland seems to be an incredibly foreign concept to some people.
---
The defenses are designed to bring you back once an hour to grab your loot and get some water n stimpacks that you're prolly a lil low on after an hour of fighting. 
---
It's so simple, yet all people do is complain about how they can't afk for resources anymore. 
---
Haven't played since last patch. My water meter drained twice as quickly as my food meter despite having the same perk levels... Is this intended? I have loads of water so doesn't matter really also have more food then I can track, most the time I'll sell it when its condition is almost at zero.
---
I might not gift it now, if I don't have to have 2 subscriptions to maintain this mule set-up. I'll just put it in the bedroom and use it as a streaming device. Or play the game there when I am lazy on a Sunday morning.
---
I'm level 95 and I check periodically and I have never seen one thing in any of those ever.  Maybe it's a PC/Xbox thing, but I never see anything on PS4.  I usually drop my stuff in Flatwoods.
---
‚ÄúOh well, back to the daily tedium‚Äù
---
You ever take rad-x?  It suppresses mutations.
---
I always use the ice box, trash cans seem to have a weight limit in whitesprings! 
---
What a wonderful contribution to the discussion.
---
/s
---
Anyone know if the stuff you place in containers will remain there for other players after you log off?
---
My buddy got banned a week or so ago. Still doesnt know why. I hear rumors that if you craft a bunch of stuff at one time you may get like auto banned which I think is stupid. Crafting alot of stuff doesnt automatically make you a duper
---
For vendors, even if they keep the 200 cap limit, at least let us go above that limit when we sell things back to them. Of course they may not be able to do this because of the massive duping that‚Äôs gone on...
---
Not finding the ore inside the tree.... Looking
---
It seems like every time I'm in a nuke zone, it does this. My last SBQ battle, Pretty much everything I took down just had a spinning circle on the loot window, including three or four legendaries. I picked up a legendary weapon from the SBQ, and then wandered around gathering flux. About five minutes later, the weapon I picked up from the SBQ popped up on my screen. Thinking maybe the server finally caught up, I went back to the scene of the battle, and I was finally able to loot everything, and got a bunch of stuff.
---
It seems like the server(s) are just getting overwhelmed with requests or something.
---
I was just saying what you said
---
Oh, maybe. At first I just assumed it sort of ‚Äúrespawned‚Äù like the other types of flux too, but it just started getting ridiculous, since maybe 1/10 open for me.
---
Ah! That might be the answer. Thanks!
---
You're mistake is thinking bethesda actually cares
---
Didn't someone find in the code or maybe when breaking into that dev game room there was a presidential (enclave) X-01 skin or something?
---
Lol seriously they‚Äôre not using a freaking api call for a gaming server, this isn‚Äôt some internet website like weather(dot)com. It‚Äôs a game and the more people like yourself try to guess at how their infrastructure works, without having any actual experience in game design yourself, the more stupid you all sound.
---
Sorry but pretending to know wtf you‚Äôre talking about deserves being called out for bs.
---
Sometimes I move forward or backwards and it‚Äôll flip.
---
They're not very profitable by any means. I might get to harvest 2 or 3 in any given zone.
---
At one point the path splits and goes up to the left or down to the right.  Go down to the right and descend inside the tree.
---
*only to make bobby pins weight a shitload
---
Ohhh yeah I do have those. Thank you! 
---
1600 would not be enough. 
---
I might or might not find it necessary to pick up every shiny thing. 
---
Haven't checked last few days (as nowhere near enough xaps) but seem to remember close to 20000 caps. I may be wrong but they are by far the most expensive plan I've noticed
---
I'm not nay-saying the idea,  i love modders and mods, but do other mmorpg allow mods in the public servers?
---
This is total ignorance, not a statement. 
---
Whitesprings lol üòÇ
---
Goddamn.
---
This sub is so fucking toxic right now, it's unusable.
---
damn they were 11 before
---
My wife is on wifi and I'm on a wired connection she deals with more server problems then I do.
---
Bathrobe (with slippers) can be purchased inside whitesprings. 
---
hes still banned, and saying Yeah that didnt happend doesnt make it fake. Lol half the problem of this threads are people like that. You should work for Bethesda
---
Haha hey man no worries. And yes I agree that an end boss should be time consuming, but after playing some of the looter shooters such as destiny, I guess i want to see more mechanical methods of reaching the end of a fight. Rather than just shooting at it. Either way I'm not trying to argue, rather just add my point of view, because I do agree that normal lvl enemies such as a super mutant overlord are not exactly bullet sponges, even though they do take a fair few hits, it's never tedious for me personally.  
---
 It's just that last boss build up, and in good armour which everyone has near the end, it's a shame the challenge only extends as far as having to hit bad guy lots rather than avoid damage or trigger some sort of critical hit area or something. 
---
But then, maybe some would find that too arcade like or something. 
---
Either way, happy adventuring. :)
---
Yeah I know it suppresses them but I don‚Äôt take Rad-X unless I‚Äôm running a nuke zone. 
---
Lead belly is just for eating/drinking, aquaboy (I think) is just for swimming - but I get the point....
---
I'm pretty sure I have before.  But that may have been removed in a patch.  Will have to test it when I get home.
---
Run sneak in PvE and use Secret Agent for PvP. Stealth boys are best used to prevent other players from using vats on you and they aren't that useful for PvE. Likewise using a piece of chameleon armor or the mutation also prevent player vats. 
---
lol me too
---
&gt;Wyndstun
---
The game works fine he says lol. I wished I lived in my little own world where everyone else is lying and every fact was "alternative".

---
They could have private servers, fallout 4 modders is what keeping game alive to this day. Bethesda has to figure out business model, where modders fit in order to keep fallout 76 popular for years to come.
---
Gutsys have armor and armor piercing bullets. Return fire with some ap rounds of your own and they crumble like all other robot scum. 
---
I do 5 Whitesprings run per day I play.  That will give you AT LEAST 5 legendaries and a buttload (that's a lot) of chem.  I don't use chems, so from just those runs, I can sell enough to empty the vendor caps per day.  It's quite easy.  I think I sold like 50 Rad-X yesterday because the ghouls drop those like crazy.   That's not even including selling legendaries.  I drop everything that isn't worth at least 175 caps (or it's something I'll use).  So whenever I'm running low on chems to sell, I go to my stash or my mule character, pick off 3 or 4 legendaries, pop a grape mentat, and start selling.  I usually keep around 2k because there really isn't much I want to buy at this point.
---
I could do them both for 750
---
Welcome to the endgame dude. It only gets worse.  
---
I only use power armor for nuke zones though. I have fully upgraded armor, max ironclad, max barbarian with 15 str, and max evasive with 15 agi. My DR outside of power armor is pretty high.
---
If the last patch is any indication, we‚Äôre waitinf longer for a rushed, half-baked patch. Worst of both worlds. 
---
Well sentinel requires that you stand still, but dodgy, ironclad, adamantanium skeleton, nerd rage, serendipity (if your a none PA user), bloody mess, Tenderizer, Barbarian and Radicool  are all what I have for the doing high up damage and good resistance. I also sport a mixture of Sentinel assassin, weightless, zealot and cavalier unyielding armour pieces. 
---
Regarding TSE, TSE was the only way to effectively make a sentinel build be killable, since you'd have to stagger the opponent and hit them with a TSE to kill effectively, but with that gone well, it's only bane is a melee build which now are waaaay to OP for my liking, cause I've been one shot by some lvl 40's, while being lvl 201 myself
---
Also that brick walls seemingly take up more budget than wooden suuuucks.
---
My house looks nice but is absolutely tiny in comparison to my friends wooden one.
---
I have hit max budget, and I don‚Äôt have a single turret
---
I hope you can forgive me for misspelling griefer and my grammatical errors in a post I banged out in a few minutes on my phone. Though in all fairness you seem to be the only person who cares
---
Cute. Troll harder stupid child
---
I'd take the brown... On PC?
---
Like life.  I don't play to remind me of life.....
---
True... some folks bought duped items
---
But i also have a bidder going for the BOS as well
---
Butchers Bounty is the name if the perk. Perception based.
---
White Knight is also a godsend because of the repair material requirement reduction.  Save on that ballistic fiber.
---
People here still enjoy the game, they just don‚Äôt enjoy the unnecessary chores that have been recently implemented.
---
That‚Äôs why there has been a massive drop in activity here.
---
Not sure if this is a bug but:
---
Laser rifle automatic barrels reduce the magazine size to 21. It doesn't say this is an effect of the automatic barrel. Also it most definitely should increase the magazine size if anything. 21 is too low for how fast laser rifles shoot with automatic barrels
---
I wish I could up vote this more!
---
So you say d/c and lags and freezes are feature ? You sound like that 
---
Wood armor only exists as 1 star. I'm not calling you a liar, but...
---
D:
---
Had similar happen in watoga. Killed a 3 star, then had another spawn a minute later, starting to shoot it and it stepped backwards into it's capsule thingy. Moments later a none leg spawned. Weird
---
Oof ouch owie my feelings. Please remove yourself from the gene pool.
---
Xbox lol
---
Yeah, I built a medic like a dummy lol. Outside of power armor I'm a little bit squishy unless I throw on dodgy and serendipity. 
---
And that's totally ban worthy right. Because everyone selling items is open and honest about duping and none of them try and tell you that all there stuff is laggit 
---
Given the recentness of your throw-away account and the comments you have been posting here and on the Market I can assume that you got caught flat footed when the first unannounced ban wave came around and your mule triggered as having excessive inventory like hundreds of thousands. 
---
Stop whining.
---
Yeah sorry. I wasn't aware there were other power plants in the game. (Noob)
---
I‚Äôve seen them for sale at the Harper‚Äôs Ferry vendor, and you can occasionally find them in the display cabinets inside the burnt out house near that vendor (to the south), although you might have to server hop a bit... this guy on YT has more info: [Marine Armor Plans](https://youtu.be/4PzGT5BEBGg) 
---
i can help with workshop items (on pc) at a basic level if you like, but looking at some of the structures our fellow survivors made: i don't feel like anywhere close to a designer
---
Also, if you're suffering from withdrawal, it lowers your stats, the status screen isn't very good at telling you that, pop an addictol if nothing else is working, that might fix it
---
Where do you get them
---
Or animals if you have that perk
---
Thank you! I'll try this route for sure.
---
/u/Moredius you liar
---
i will take both for 750 be on tonight  gamer tag "waynestaton" will you hold please?
---
No need to apologize - that's why I posted it. Just wanted to make sure you knew there were other power plants so you weren't just limited to the one. :)
---
I always dump stuff in Overseer's caches too, particularly plans and aid.
---
Also, it's nice if you take only what you need and leave a little something behind that you don't need for the next person.
---
Same here, I like to make food for the buffs, but keeping up with the current drain rate is tedious as hell.  I'm glad I live nearby to a creek where I can run down and spam collect 60 water then run back up and harvest my farm.  I love my melon juice and corn soup baby!  
---
I think I'm going to have to build a second or even third small water purifier and generators if I have the budget to run them.
---
Interesting... Thank you! I want more lol
---
Some online games have had private servers and mods can be installed at the server level.
---
Flatwoods fridge every day I pick up coffee, seafood, ham, and dog food. Sometimes when I do swarm of suitors I get Cajun rice.
---
Im not a big fan of energy weapons but as usual i was out of rifle ammo and so i went laser rifle for 960 rounds (bagspace depletion for the win) after the onslaught ( pritty fast cuz every enemy eats a full clip)  i noticed durability was still 80%.
---
Not super but also not the complain level i read here every day so if i ever have enough stash to actually upgrade a rifle this could be fun for some days.
---
I was just talking to my buddy about that yesterday.  Oh wait...that was you haha!  
---
It's okay, maybe we'll find an empty one tonight.
---
Go find a super mute cluster and have fun unloading all those missiles and gather caps. I had 17 nukes the other day and went sniping with a Fatman...it was great fun, lol.
---
Throwaway account? Again another ASSUMPTION. I made this account before I got banned and was intending on setting it up to use for trades and power armor crafting. I‚Äôve not posted any comments on the market jackassüëçüèºhundreds of thousands? Again fake news but ok bro. I never had anymore than a few thousand scrap junk and a flux. All which could‚Äôve been gained legitimately but feel free to pass neg comments without proof. They actually said 500k and above RARE items would trigger a system flag not 100k, so that shows you know nothing at all. You must be a Bethesda shillüòÇ
---
I just want to know how to run power through walls. It was easy in Fo4 with the vault building set. Those connectors were legit.
---
Make is 85. There's 7 SPECIAL stats. Right now, the maximum for SPECIAL stats is 15. Raise the cap to 20 for all of them and this makes the average SPECIAL stat 12, compared to the current 8. 
---
If anyone has a more balanced idea, please chip in. 
---
Are you fucking serious?
---
It's been FIVE DAYS since the last Inside the Vault and a week since the last patch and that isn't fucking enough for you?
---
Stop using FFXIV as a fucking example.  They didn't take down their service as a courtesy to their customers, they did it because they had to redesign the ENTIRE game literally from the ground up.
---
Yup seems like you‚Äôre right to be honest
---
A quick toggle for pacifist mode would be really nice. 
---
Just hit a key. 
---
I think the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats do stack with PA, but don't quote me on that. Also, u/blasports linked a thread about the underarmors. I didn't follow it, but I think its the same one I've been referencing for a while now. 
---
Not comparing it to maybe three weeks ago.  It was double that on most of the servers I was on.
---
In excavator armor
---
I like this idea. But this would only show on the client side?
---
achievement unlocked: "Shakes fist yelling up at sky"
---
No, I care, too. I was just too busy laughing at your spelling, grammar and punctuation to comment until now.
---
PS4 here. Regularly get stuck as a floating head and hands for minutes when loading in.
---
Numerous crashes loading in.
---
Sometimes I have to try loading in 6 or more times before I can actually play.
---
With the Grape Mentats I got it down to 9400 or so. 
---
It's sad tho, all I've ever seen or heard is the same automated response from the support bots or the same copy and paste response from an actual person. Zero compassion or connection to try and help people resolve issues
---
The bug happens to non legendary enemies and regardless of level. I've had it happen on a lvl 6 Mole Rat all the way to a lvl 68 Super Mutant. If you take a explosive weapon and a single mob and shoot him slowly you can clearly see his HP going up when bullets are clearly hitting them.  Does not seem to be a bug with everyone though so they are possibly thinking it's in relation to a perk or possibly gear related issue.
---
Thanks for the reply! Good to know i shouldnt be lugging that crap around... What location is good to find excavator armor? 
---
This is new to Fo76 yea? 
---
I'll google it now actually haha 
---
If that would make the idea more palatable to Bethesda and as long as it worked, then sure.
---
I‚Äôd be down for a ‚Äúconvert to candy‚Äù option at Watoga High School or for credit elsewhere in a similar fashion 
---
This is pre-update info, but might help for world spawn points. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLi69pVxFZlYv6pQcRNJoHDVtZqraIk-InlA_ThEgPU/htmlview
---
76 isn‚Äôt a hoarding game like previous titles. You have to make hard choices and stick with them. Drop it or keep it but please shut up with these shit posts. 
---
and they'll continue releasing them when they're fucking ready to.  People bitch that they aren't releasing enough dev notes, then they bitch that the dev notes are getting rushed out and aren't saying anything important and then they bitch that the rushed dev notes still aren't coming out often enough.
---
Is this poetry? Wtf
---
Yeah, I think a little balance would be nice in regards to this. Over a course of a game day, my character should be obese from the amount of food and teas they consume.
---
lol wut?
---
&gt; but do other mmorpg allow mods in the public servers?
---
24 player servers = MMORPG? Hell, might as well call Fortnite an MMORPG then since you can technically role play in the game if you try hard enough. 
---
It's not explosive exclusive.
---
I'm explosive but I kill ghouls with a sledge. They disappear regardless of weapon.
---
Kind of weird you are fishing for a specific correlation lol.
---
You have to harvest them just as if they were in the wild. I usually use them almost immediately to make some sort of prepared food to avoid them spoiling quickly.
---
No it doesn't automatically go into your stash box. They remain ripe until picked. 
---
Definitely surprised to see the positive reaction
---
too little too late, Anthem, Cyberpunk, never looking back
---
The amusement parks are really good spots for materials. All of the teddy bears, cups, and toys for plastic, lead, screws, rubber etc. I always like to loot Tyler County Fairgrounds EARLY on to get a jump on some of the materials that will slow me down in the later early game to mid game.
---
Not perfect and cost is 6 cards but leadbelly and cannibal saved this game for me. Just drink from the stream and eat zombies all day. Food is just vendor trash now
---
And do you want them to fix it right or do you want them to keep rushing out shit because Reddit keeps yelling at them and we end up with a patch like the last one.  they're patching the game on their own fucking schedule, they don't need all of the fucking armchair game devs telling them that they could do a better job faster.
---
Yeah all I got was cookie cut emails from support. Gave them my reasoning, told 7-10 days it would be looked at and a decision made. But now on day 13üòÇdone with this game but will continue to post to make the issue known.
---
The level cap is fine. They need room to grow into over years (if the game even lasts that long). This sort of concept is nothing new with MMOs.
---
The only thing I can recommend for now that I found helps is switching from a automatic receiver to non automatic. I found when I switched mine the bug happens less.
---
I love this game have never stopped playing it (400 hours) through all the real and fake controversy's.
---
But right now I log in and 
---
\- My damage fluctuates up and down by 100 either way
---
\- My stealth works completely randomly
---
\- Various mutations turn on and off (marsupial and others)
---
\- Easy to test perks such as faster reload of heavy guns work 50 percent of the time
---
\- Regenerating enemies
---
Had zero of these problems until the hotfix patch.  And its unfortunately unplayable until the next fix comes in.
---
Yeah I was thinking anti-armor explosive would be the new tse after the nerf, that combo'd with the tank killer perk could negate most of the armor of an opponent plus it's stagger ability would make the sentinel effect null as the opponent would be standing still
---
In fo4 you could sell literally everything, and I think that's the biggest problem.  I'm still not used to being stuck with ammo I can't sell, along with other things that build up like gunpowder.  The super low vendor cap exacerbates the problem since, if I pick up everything, I find it difficult to sell everything from a single 2 hour play session more often than not.
---
It's bizarre how different people's experience can apparently be. I get two 2-star legendaries basically every time (the Queen's loot hasn't spawned like twice out of 20+), some stable flux, some ultracite, a prime receiver plan (usually but not always), and maybe even a serum plan (I think have three so far). Plus whatever other random stuff I get from the scorch mobs she spawns.
---
Easily worth the ten or so minutes it takes for a group to murder her.
---
Yeah I lucked out on that one for sure. I think I had to throw in a reduced weight bloodied cultist blade, but I don't melee so that was straight trash for me anyway.
---
Where
---
I've found Marine Armor plans (Legs, Torso, Arms) in BoS areas in South Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
Pump is way slower my man
---
I can turn the game on and play the fuck out of it, therefore the game works. You're talking out of your ass. Let the devs patch when they are ready is all I'm saying. 
---
See I would agree with you but we've seen what happens when Bethesda rushes out a fix.
---
The most recent patch and then hotfix is frustrating af and I don't want a repeat of that because they didn't spend enough time testing.
---
r/market76 
---
Oh I thought you meant packaged food
---
Ideally yes, but there will always be a couple of people who want to try out survival and not think about that
---
Look whos late to the party.  
---
I thought using paint that preserves the item could be applied or another that allowed you to scrap it could work. It would be very difficult to accidentally paint and scrap something. 
---
I just spent quite a bit of time sending a detailed report of my load out to the DEV that requested the info. They are looking into it as much as possible right now. I included everything you have listed here as it's happening to me too. Hopefully we can see some serious fixes soon.
---
Why go though the hassle of trolling in adventure mode when they're going to make it so easy in survival
---
Oh I want them all
---
&gt; it's unusable.
---
no the game is getting to that point. The community is just sick of it. For good reason. 
---
They literally patched an old bug back into the fucking game
---
Life hack: If you find a pond/river/etc with dirty water you can spam the collect button as fast as you can click it and gather a crap ton of water faster that any pump or sink can spit it out. Its nothing to gather 80+ water in about 30-45 seconds then go boil it for 40 boiled water. I'm on PS4, don't know if it works on the other systems.
---
No,  it's because some people are just assholes to the core. 
---
You said mighty ;)
---
I can hold the limbs for you (100 caps). But like I said, ive got another bidder for the BOS and Ill sell it to the best offer.
---
I've bought three of them for a grand total of 12k: Handmade Rifle, Combat Shotgun, and .50 Cal Machine Gun. The patch nearly killed my build. My Combat Shotgun did 899 damage pre-patch. It did 244 post-patch. But there are perks you can take such as Adrenaline that'll significantly raise your damage if you string together kills in quick succession. 
---
I personally think it's low. All weapons perks except unarmed require 9 points for full power. Plus everything except rifles have weight reduction perks, some even absolutely necessary for enjoyable gameplay. Then there's all the other rest of the perks. So the level 50 cap really feels low.
---
(Dirty) Water is everywhere.  As is food (cannibalize).  
---
I think the Rad Worm bug is amplifying hunger and thirst as well
---
It works a treat for workshops too. 
---
Invalid argument. At this point you lot are complaining for the sake of complaining. 
---
&gt; I‚Äôve NEVER posted any comments on the market jackass where do you even get your info?
---
I click on your name and then go look at what you wrote on the Market.
---
Where you said you were just crafting marginal / small amounts of stuff.
---
That you earlier said you were sitting on thousands upon thousands of materials to make Power Armor and Power Armor Mods.
---
Where you deny picking up Brown Bags categorically only to a couple of days later try and use picking up Brown Bags as an excuse as to where the voluminous amount of material ended up on your Pack Mule.
---
Yeah, Occams Razor. You should have been banned.
---
He has offered 750 for the BOS
---
you have to find the plans and then craft it. expensive but ohhhh so worth it. 
---
Fly, you fools!
---
(Falls back into the dark chasm that is r/fo76)
---
Ah well, I was going to hook you up with 1k. Next life.
---
Yes please.  The mods they've done so far have been really useful.
---
Dude are you high? Delusional? I have never posted on Market76. Jesus Christ üôÉ who is ‚ÄúOccams Razor‚Äù I‚Äôm so confused as to what you are talking about lol
---
Give me a robot bench so I can make a Mr. Handy to harvest, store and craft.
---
I always upvote these posts. It has been said million times, but Beth needs to sink in the flood of these copy-pasted posts so they pay attention.
---
I have been paid a few times now to build and decorate houses. I have every pan but 7 of them
---
This is awesome, but good luck getting a prime gatling laser plan.  That's easily going to be the hardest part.  I keep getting prime SMG, LMG and pistol plans.
---
Fixed a couple of patches ago. 
---
Hahahaaaaa! I know you want the game to succeed but ignoring the actually facts of the matter is just plain sad. Just because a game starts doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs working. A game can be strung with dozens of symantec bugs that ruins the overall experience. You are funny lol.
---
Yeah, I recently looted a AAE Handmade off the scorchbeast queen, which is great for all my maxed out rifleman perks, but I'll max out Tank Killer and try testing it on enemies. I remember testing my TSE on scorchbeasts and My god was is a beast XD.
---
But Yeah what you said is right, as long as you can stagger a sentinel, they're dead pretty much. They also can't stand a AAE or BE(Bloodied Explosive) Shotgun to the face, but that would kill you aswell due to AOE... Hehe.
---
Also Pulse Mines and grenades are surprisingly good against people in PA, even tho they won't have many damage resist perks active, but if they run a low health build in PA, pulse and BE, AAE in this case won't do much.
---
I'll give you three guesses as to how many shits i give...
---
Nah, come on, I only ever pick up Rad Worms and Buzz Brain, a little Buzz Brain doesn't kill you, and everybody loves Rad Worms these days, mmkay?
---
MODDERS
---
*fapfapfapfapfap*
---
Be assured that we are collecting all of your suggestions 
---
and placing them on a shelf where they can collect dust
---
I've thrown away several *shrug*. Unfortunately this game still includes a lot of low yield gambling for plans and gear üòï
---
It takes all modifiers into accounts. I have a base of 7, I also have 1 piece of armor that gives me +1 charisma. I also use the magnetic personality card when I play with my 1 friend who still plays (rank one on the card) this gives me a total of 9 charisma and allows me to share any 3* card. Assuming I don't have a disease that reduces my stats or my armor with +1 charisma is broken.
---
the Batteries Included perk probably helps a ton
---
The actual complaint was that it wouldn't auto undo the bulk for crafting, which it used to do.
---
nope, I've never seen the icon or animation with it. I kept track of it to see what kind of return it would give me, and I've never received anything. 
---
Hmm well it's a decent thing but I have a better use for violet flux. I'm currently running around with probably 40 fusion cores all at 85 or higher remaining charge. If I was ever in need of some there are a few places in the world where fully charged cores spawn.
---
1. Outside the Poseidon Power Plant (possibly the other one too but never looked)
---
2. Inside the bunker near fissure site prime
---
Failing that the event Line in the Sand gets you 2x fusion cores for successfully finishing it.
---
It's all about choice and sacrifice. Yes you can go the 9 point weapon build but it's at a cost. This is how it should be.
---
Like I said, it needs to grow into something. If you can already comfortably place all the perks you need, what's the incentive to add a higher level cap later?
---
Oooo. Time to start popping Berry mentats and crafting them. Thanks!
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I think I tried that but I'll have another go, maybe it doesn't work on PC?
---
Any news if Railway Rifles are gonna get fixed yet?
---
Ahaha. Seriously, just send that guy a message and make up anything negative about FO76 and he'll report it as fact. He was responsible for starting the last F2P rumor because one guy told him a GameStop in Australia didn't have physical copies of 76. After he received negative feed back for being dumb enough to believe some anonymous weirdo on the internet, all of a sudden he had 100s of Australians telling him GS didn't have copies. He also doubled down and lied saying Bethesda was the on pulling the copies, to which Bethesda called BS on. 
---
How much do AAE handmade usually go for?
---
950 for both
---
40? That's 120 pounds of cores. I couldn't do it lol.
---
Yes that one. 
---
But again, the issue is that learning from scrapping does not seem to unlock all forms, unlike plans. This is likely a glitch but it the heart of the problem
---
Just gonna say this. I don‚Äôt grief people, I love helping others out. I did this as a test to my friend to see if it worked. Literally kept smacking him with my gauntlet over and over. He didn‚Äôt attack back or use his stims. And I was able I kill him. Made me wanted for 10-15 caps. So yes slap damage can kill you. If you stay still idle or don‚Äôt heal yourself you will die. I‚Äôd rather die fighting for my life then getting beat in the face to death. I haven‚Äôt played for a week now. Me and my friends went back to 7 days to die. Last time I was on I went after a guy with 250 bounty. Finally killed him while he was trading with some low levels.( I didn‚Äôt know I didn‚Äôt see the emote). Next thing I know all of them (5 players) started attacking me. Lvls were 47,60,76,101 and the wanted guy was around my lvl(150) I think 136. I tried fighting back with only one. The 47 who kept pestering me with his deathclaw gauntlet. Me being in no armor took out my gauntlet as well. I think both of us had bloodied weapons. But somehow he kept killing me first every time. I even tried vats on him. Then I realized he was on a team with the 76 who was just standing watching. So I killed him, let the 47 kill me and tried to leave after respawning. They kept attacking. Me being around low health almost died again from slap damage. I had to run away jump up on a building and crouch to camo, just to be safe. I don‚Äôt have any harsh feelings towards the wanted guy, he apologized and I apologized for killing him while trading. But I warned him of his new friends that he‚Äôd have to be careful with people like that. Don‚Äôt associate yourself with toxic players. Even for trades. Make sure people you meet are trustworthy and can have a few good laughs with them on discord or reddit before going out to trade. You might get a message from Xbox or Bethesda my dear griefers. There is the option for this on Beth.net and I‚Äôve been using it a lot lately. Also don‚Äôt forget to take photos with your cell phones of gamer tags and how the character dresses üòÇüòú
---
Good luck fellow gamers ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
He deleted much of his stuff it seems.
---
Pretty sure Bethesda already came out saying they only banned people with something like half a million items on their person.  Not just people "crafting".  Pretty safe to say those spreading the rumors about people being banned for crafting and just angry cheaters.
---
A "He said She said" PR hit to fuel the already legitimate fires burning against Bethesda.
---
That's a fine build if you have a regular group but I'm usually by myself.
---
Yep, that's the one. Thanks. I've got three ranks of it and just couldn't remember it.
---
So what it already does but with a weight increase?
---
You‚Äôre welcome 
---
They're obscenely heavy for what damage they do.
---
3lbs is way too much.
---
A Workshop Event dropped one for me before.
---
There is absolutely something different since patch. I have to start each gaming session with 20 corn soup, I play for an hour and I need to get more soup. Thirst is running out much faster than food and MUCH faster than before patch.
---
Yeah, that's been going on for a while now unfortunately.
---
how many people were there total? if there isnt that many of u..u are in for a longgggg fight
---
Options like eating guns?
---
It‚Äôs a server issue not a qol one.
---
It seems to me (this is idle speculation) that each time you go and find nothing there is a server where someone got there first. So areas that are in high demand have nothing a lot of the time (and often times the stuff you see is stuff no one else wanted).
---
The whole post was deleted you fool. Mostly because people like said troll above are accusing me of stuff?
---
I didn‚Äôt deny picking up bags and it literally says in this post I think that was part of the reason?üòÇCan you not read properly???
---
There's plans for all kinds of elite mods you can't get from scrapping. I just considered it the last 1% endgame type stuff. I grabbed the BoS armor mod for all limbs before they changed the vendor plans. Took less than an hour of hopping at Grafton station. I've been told I was very lucky though.
---
It will be remain there until removed or the server crashes
---
"A simple cost benefit analysis will show that at this point this game will serve Bethesda best by dying out quickly."
---
That is why I think these design choices keep getting made. They want player numbers down at this point so that when they discontinue support they have a manageable active player base to deal with, minimizing backlash. 
---
To fix it would need alot of money for a player base that just is not there.
---
I don't really want to believe the development team is just this fucking bad honestly. 
---
Sacrifice damage to enemies for... weight reduction?? The perks are kinda horrible, the gun/meele perks should have been 5 points and the weight not more that 2. Right now most of the weight reduceing perks are at 3 points. 3 whole points just to reduce the weight of in game items that includes your weapons, power armor, food and drink. Plus seperate perks 
---
It should show the parts on it if you inspect it and should show the total stats
---
Just letting you know I've had enemies healing off a regular shotgun at level 15-20 on ps4 and with sneak attacks from 10mm same level range. Not consistently a problem I am still eventually able to kill them just annoying like drinking water every 3 mins in game.
---
Wow, I'm surprised you're actually the first time I've ever heard of it dropping.
---
I imagine most people have a fusion generator at their CAMP by level 50. Why not let it recharge a single core while it's in use and give it a long time to charge but not too long? I think a combined hour of actual time would be enough seeing as that would net you a handful of new cores from the power plants. I doubt (m)any are using the fusion cores for Gatling Lasers seeing as those are worse than a 10mm pistol.
---
I bet they'll have a camelback in the Atom store for 1200 caps that buffs thirst before they have a patch to fix it.
---
The twist ending where the game broke my heart and made me quit came out of no where. 
---
Always just deletes the name with no result, not to worry.
---
do u guys know if the torso plans are also at harpers ferry (not the vendor)?
---
The event at Morgantown Airport drops a supply crate with 100 Pre-War money upon completion
---
You dont need an id for every piece of steel. Every stack needs an id, but the size of the stack is just an integer or other numerical value. You dont need to know which piece of steel is number 1 and which is 644. You only need to know that there are 644 in this container and change the number if there is something added or taken out.
---
that's a lot of help, thank you!
---
It's all about your build. If you arent optimized for max damage with your weapons of choice you will have a hard time. 
---
In my experience they are not tied to anything and simply spawn all over Fort Defiance. As on my last straight jacket run I also picked up at least one uniform of each color including the hat if I could find it. Which I also found multiple copies of each all over the place. Grant it the Fort was freshly respawned so all the loot was fresh. 
---
They should reset to 200 every day. All vendors of the same faction share their cap pool.
---
You are the second or third person I have seen say that about Uranium Fever. I have gotten several drops that are max level from there. I don't think the level of the enemies necessarily dictate what drops you CAN get does it? Can't you get any level drop off any legendary?
---
Weapons are one thing, perks and mutations are another. I have a 1* AA Gatling gun and I clean up her adds just fine, and I feel like I do good damage to her. But I‚Äôm running a max damage HW/Pa/Adenal Reaction build. 
---
You don't need another copy of fo76, not another Xbox. Go to a secluded area and find a stash, beehive, suitcase, lunchbox etc; check the players who are on server and memorize 2 names, deposit all you want to transfer to the world stash, then open your other character and go to social, under recent players you should be able to find the ones u memorized, click on them then on "join" and you are on the same server but using your secondary account. Now just double click on the world stash and loot everything. 
---
Yes.  I'm actually pretty upset with the tonal departure with the introduction of the NCR in Fallout 2.  It just added a bit too much civilization to the wasteland, ya know?  That being said, I really like how Obsidian expanded upon that dynamic in New Vegas.  I guess the end evolution was different than what I expected, but was still a fun bit of story telling and atmosphere nonetheless.
---
Man you are dense as fuck... 
---
I do have a regular group, and they're nigh unkillable. It's my consolation prize for being stuck in power armor like an iron lung. Then again, my friends start complaining about rad hotspots and diseases and stuff, and I'm just like "what? Where? I never noticed!"
---
Also, stepping off a high place is far less of a problem.
---
wasn't it multiple?
---
Do not try as a defense. They are not accurate but maybe it has to be outside the circle. I built up the edge of my circle so I never noticed
---
i had marsupial temporarily disabled when they nerfed the carry weight from 40 to 20 a month back but that is it..
---
Make sure your perks maximize your damage. Heavy guns are decent if perks are set up right. But the biggest thing you need to do is make sure low levels don‚Äôt show up for the battle. They raider the queen‚Äôs defense and do little to no damage to her. You can beat the queen in a small group as long as almost everyone in the group us high level and doing lots of damage. 
---
Ha ha! I just assumed that pump and water source is the same speed. My pump is right next to a creek. All the time that I‚Äôve wasted on that pump. 
---
dayum im on ps4
---
Yeah that‚Äôs part of my question, I‚Äôve seen them and am aware of the fact that they will be opened. But you actually answered it with the lore which makes sense. It is strange that you can see dwellers in the wasteland though. The other vaults (at least one) have opened at some point before. They could have easily just finished them and had them available at the start. Clearly this was retconned though so that they can be completed and added later on. It‚Äôs an odd decision, being able to find dead dwellers out in the wasteland already kinda contradict the idea that they aren‚Äôt available since we are the first out. Thanks for the response 
---
Thats not raiding thats just griefing, raiding by definition means you take something so you are not raiding you are just being a dick
---
Yeah, that was my point. I included it with the post. Obviously Super Mutants can't be in the Vault. 
---
Take Rad-X diluted when you do the nuke run.   Those don‚Äôt suppress mutations.  
---
It's worst than hard-core mode in FO4
---
Not sure what the issues was but it has worked now. I did transfer everything to the stash but then needed more steel (not sure where it went). Once I go the steel it worked without me needing to put it in the stash. 
---
It was really easy. I bought it on steam for cheap, downloaded it quickly because it‚Äôs an old game, and when I first started it up I got an error which I then googled and downloaded the patch fans had made. I went with the basic version of patch since I wanted the original but playable version of game. 
---
It IS a pretty old game so get ready for 2006 era graphics but there‚Äôs a lot of skills and dialog options. It also helps to be familiar with World of Darkness universe. 
---
Sacrifice damage for... weight reduction?? The perks are kinda terrible. Right now almost all weight reduction perks are 3 points. 3 whole points just to reduce the weight of in game items just so they can be usable. So that's 3 points for your weapons, food, ammunition, power armor, etc. Plus seperate perks for reducing the weight of ballistic and energy ammunition, seperate perks for reducing the weight of fusion cores, seperate perks for reducing the weight for meele weapons and pistols and shotguns. It's just way too restrictive.
---
In a alternate universe there is a Fallout 76 where the opening screen was a choice between 3 races.  Ghouls, Humans, and Super Mutants.   
---
Each one started from different location in the game. Each race had different perks and abilities. I feel like I am about to begin describing any other MMORPG that has ever been made. Look I login and choice between Human, Elf, Dwarf... Started walking in that direction and just kept dreaming of what could of been. T-T  
---
where is phoenix ? im not familiar with that one
---
You think they aren't using an API for a gaming server?
---
lol.  Btw - you can diss me for the reviews of my game, but i own a game studio and built an MMO over 5 years and launched it on steam.  I have been a dev (now director) for 20 years.  You may be right but that was a pretty vitriolic response just because you disagree with my comment.
---
IF they aren't using APIs they are using something else to get data from their database to the client, and i'd literally have no idea how they are doing it. 
---
Anyway you seem really upset for some reason, sorry man I was just trying to make a funny comment.
---
Probably got the small letters an thinks its the Neon sign. I've farmed sooo many workshops all of them an NEVER seen it as a reward.
---
&gt; server crashes
---
just as I feared
---
Oh I have designed people's homes before, have you seen that episode of south park where Randy Marsh smashes walls to make the house more open? I smash people's walls.
---
Yeah seems virtually impossible now. One of those master lists says grafton, another says pleasant valley. Another says Watoga. If there was a higher rate I‚Äôd do what was needed
---
900 for BOS chest  and 100 for deep pocket arms - 1000 total  if you can hold please
---
In addition to White Knight for durability/cost, having Lucky Break will cause your armor to self-repair on occasion.
---
Please just make laser rifles actually viable to use and not a meme weapon. They are visually fun and appealing cause lasers..... but in the game world its so sad how pew pew pew is litterally pew pew pew instead of wham bam alakhazam!
---
People have been doing this for a while
---
This is some of the worst ideas I've ever seen posted on here. An there has been some stupid shit.
---
I've found the blue, clean, brown, and green in the Fort,  3rd floor on the beds or bench in shower room.  
---
I'm insanely jealous of your pink, red, yellow, and forest outfits. I've server hopped so many times for those. 
---
this happened to me a few days ago and they dropped some pretty good loot
---
You also forgot the ability to jam your weapon while firing.
---
&gt; Ahaha. Seriously, just send that guy a message and make up anything negative about FO76 and he'll report it as fact. 
---
I have seriously thought of that 
---
Luckily none of them were load-bearing
---
It should also regenerate the enemy at high damage...
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons
---
Uh huh. No research at all. Notice how Broadsider is listed under heavy weapons and NOT explosive? So yeah, I'll keep telling you you're wrong as long as you keep being wrong.
---
I would guess your head is dense with cement: You live in your own little world where F76 is the best game ever and can‚Äôt even admit some of its failings. Says ALOT about you. Like I said, very sad...but also funny lol.
---
It depends on how many are actually fighting and how many low levels are bidding around making her more difficult to kill.
---
I've gotten prime lever action plans, prime handmade plans, prime combat shotgun plans, but the most useful for me was a prime western revolver plan.  Given how rarely I use my pistol (the only two times that come to mind are scorchbeasts and this one mole miner on a ledge in Blackwater mine when I'm exiting Uranium Fever.  I just can't let it live for some reason) it's actually a pretty nice receiver, and fits in well with my situational ranged usage.
---
I can verify Grafton station in real play, not a spreadsheet. The other stations I have no clue.

\- Absolutely maxed on building capacity. I wanted a balance between aesthetics and practicality. I chose to relocate the generator so the dual missile launchers  can protect it and the spotlight helps their targeting systems.  
---
\- Provides plenty of melons for food and purified water. I love the outdoor campfire cooker with a nearby picnic table and small blue cooler to store your cooked food.

They really set the bar low didn't they?
---
 This game needs to be over-over-over over-over over-over repaired.  
---
I added my Alt to my mains list, accepted the request next time I logged on with that character, both on PC.
---
Pretty sure you type in the name (has to be 100% accurate) then hit enter. Maybe it got broken with latest patch but I've got my alt &amp; main on each other's friends list so it worked at some point 
---
It‚Äôs sounds like you need more preparation. Try to get a team together and coordinate.
---
They're mostly as good as hardened receiver I think. Bonus damage against scorched is a nice extra if you can afford the bullets.
---
The Swamp Itch really gets me going personally
---
Oh thanks! I didn‚Äôt know that. 
---
Bethesda replied to this. They claim it works as intended lol
---
Sorry that you‚Äôve never bought anything on the internet. Welcome to 2019 tho.
---
What I have noticed now is the other extreme. If you leave excavator armor on when you log off, you get 200 lbs extra weight limit instead of 100 when you first log in, but if you remove and reenter your excavator you go back to only +100
---
what i meant to say with the post is not that far off from what you told, except the way and the ammount of info :)
---
i know that the QC works hard and they find lots of stuff, i'd be shocked if they wouldn't.
---
but as for QC u can only test so much, take a clipping PA for example..
---
i can see that a QC is not gonna test to get out of a power armor on every corner of every building... having a few million players,.. yeah theres probably someone who runs into it, be it by accident or not..
---
The entire sneak/caution/hidden mechanic is bugged as all hell for a lot of people right now. You know, one of the games main mechanics. I'm in near-permanent caution, negating any perks and mutations that work when hidden, healing factor for example.
---
But, you are right, the game is fine.
---
Mutations themselves have been bugged by a strange interaction with radworms, the disease you often get from ghouls, if you dare to cure the radworms all of your mutations get negated unless you relog the game. Another one of the games main mechanics being bugged.
---
Of course, as you so rightly pointed out, the game is fine.
---
Since the last patch many players are reporting that weapon and armour degradation has gone up, hunger and thirst are getting out of hand and fusion core drain has gone up. None of this was in the patch notes, and because of course Bethesda are being so open and honest with us, these things must be bugs and not intentional /s
---
Not forgetting of course, that for you, the game is fine.
---
The servers have become far more unstable for a lot of users since the last patch. A disconnection from server (their end, not mine, when it kicks everyone) and bluescreens are more and more an eventuality, not just a possibility.
---
Blah blah...game is fine... blah blah
---
The weapon damage bug has returned for some players, enemies are healing for no good reason (ie legendary) or not taking damage at all.
---
But, as you say, the game is fine.
---
They released a patch, it broke a lot of things and even rolled back some problems that were previously patched, then they release a hotfix that fixes 3 of the huge list of problems they had just introduced or re-introduced. 
---
The very definition of fine: Fallout 76
---
Most frustrating, I really like this game, and if they would just get their act together and fix the things they have broken I could carry on enjoying it. For now, I am playing other games and checking back here daily for updates in the hope that I can enjoy the game again soon.
---
What level will i achieve this? And how do i get around this stupid budget limiting thing?
---
7?
---
Scorchbeasts have a unique ability to regenerate / ignore damage against explosive weapons that was never fixed, even with the prior fixes.  
---
It makes it extremely difficult to know how rough any scorchbeast fight will be 
---
yeah. there's some fun to be had making a full auto that shoots .38 and then just blazing low level enemies until it's gone.
---
The wikis are wrong dude.
---
Check the weapon in game.
---
Jesus fucking christ.
---
I took Poseidon workshop while it was powered up. Everything *appeared* to be OK. Sat next to the fusion core machine for an hour... Got nothing. 
---
I just got the email last week after butting the claim back in November.
---
Doing a loop around and thru the city, but staying away from the very edge, then you start to get assultrons, and they don't spawn as many legendaries 
---
If you were in a group that dropped to just you and you're using strange in numbers then it bugs out and removes all your positive mutations. Leaving the empty group from the social menu will fix it.
---
darn, we need robot bench for real
---
Bro this guy doesn't know anything. you do know NONE of the youtubers even play the game. They have not played it since beta. They have not tried it for more then 5 hours. They went on reddit and reported other peoples post's that were far less aggressive and "fuck fallout 76" and reported on it like they were experiencing all this themselves. 
---
You ever wonder why all these guys background video is always the same shit (**probably not because you seem to take everything on youtube as fact**). because they get sent in game footage. They also have others play on their accounts for footage. The game will not be going free to play. NO STORE IN EXISTENCE would be giving the game away for free. That is just bullshit. You sound like a total mongrel posting this. Especially since you haven't even picked up the game and tried it for yourself.
---
all the top comments btw hating on fallout are by people literally stating they would never even play it? but they have a right to bash on it like they have played it forever.
---
Also before you come back and just call me a fanboy or some shit. I know the game has problems. None of them are game breaking anymore. Actually none have been game breaking since after I started playing just after the first huge patch. Only glitches I have seen are regular fallout shit that just makes you laugh. (stretched enemies sometimes, funny play models) this also happens less and less now.
---
Honestly, try the game for yourself before you start following 3 week old rumors. About free to play that was said by Bethesda the day the rumor came out that it wasn't true.
---
No one in upper management at Bethesda ever played D&amp;D and it really shows.
---
I got mine roughly mid January, and I filled out the request the day after it started.
---
Have you tried having all the mats either in your inventory or stash and not spread between the two? 
---
it‚Äôs more about efficency ... 1200 caps from all vendor factions can be done in under 1 hour; fast killing and picking the right places to farm are the key
---
&gt;At this point the whole net frame and most of the base code would have to be altered drastically just to bring the game back to a stable condition
---
Source? I'm not being critical of anything you said, I actually agree with you, but on what basis do you form this opinion?
---
Am I missing something or the point of inventory managment is to manage it and not drag around everything you see? 
---
Stacking all that food and charisma really doesn't seem to make as big a difference as it should.  I helped someone test this out the other day where Bulk Springs show a value of 80 and for him were selling at 20 (and he was running high cha, hard bargain, grape mentats etc.).  For me they sold for 17.
---
I'm 4 Cha, Hard Bargain 3 and the helmets are 27 each.  When I've popped a Grape Mentats I think I maybe got that to 29-30. Is it worth a bunch of consumables to effectively save you 3-4 helmets per 1400 cap run (or to put it another way 3 each of rubber, plastic, and glass)?
---
So I craft helmets (or extra Bulk materials) to get to 1400 and then do events.  On a longer play day with good events without a ton of travel I can net another 5-800.
---
I ran into an invincible wolf the other day. 
---
I‚Äôve had passive turned on since the first week. 
---
I don‚Äôt hate pvp games. In fact overwatch is one of my favourite games.
---
Pvp in this game however is completely pointless to me. I felt the same way about the dark zone in The Division. What the fuck is the point of pvp in gear based rpgs where one person can and will have a completely unfair statistical advantage over the other? There is literally no point in engaging in pvp in these types of games for any reason other than ‚ÄúI am bored and want to pick on people‚Äù
---
I've always seen it as Slocum's Joe. Where have you seen Slocum Joe's? Fallout fandom is like wikipedia anybody can edit it, so it is probably user error.
---
I would very much love it if it worked with Friendly Fire. 
---
Considering Flamethrowers ammo production is garbage...
---
I have seen inside of this vault I can tell you what is inside but idk if it would spoil the fun for you
---
Are you on drugs?
---
I don‚Äôt have friends
---
The plates are really good if you get trolls trying to melee you. I have a secondary set of power armor with the plates on it so when I see one of these melee griefers running around I watch them kill themselves on my plates.
---
Do you have any weight reducing legendary armor? I have this happen all the time due to that.
---
Are you going to take all that you said back if the game does go free to play?
---
&gt; Sacrifice damage for... weight reduction?? 
---
In an online SURVIVAL game, yeah. The junk reducing perk means you get to craft what you want faster and earn more money from bulk. The ammo reduction one means that high ammo pool is viable for an auto/heavy auto build.
---
They are all trade-offs. This isn't borderlands where if they did have a perk system like this it'd pretty much be combat or combat support perks.
---
The only place for "useless" perks taking up slots is with picklock and hacking and it's not that they're bad but it's a pain to switch them out.
---
I get it's restrictive. That's the point of a survival game. 
---
Also it gives you room to grow as the game grows. Cause if you're comfortable now the only way up in terms of increased levels/perk limits is power creep.
---
I'm not against increasing the level/perk cap at all. I'm sure it'll come with the next DLC. You know, like this sort of thing has in past games.
---
Any gun that uses ballistic ammo using weapon can have a AAE varient, just it's a real grind to get.
---
Don't know if recharging is needed but it would be a nicety if added just plug an almost dead core into your fusion reactor and it let it charge over the course of say an hour or two. 
---
As the game is now cores are pretty plentiful I can't say I've ever dropped below 7 cores of 50% or more. If there would ever to be a drastic change to their availability then yes recharging would become much more necessary option.
---
I found this: apparently explains the difference. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/4eirw4/slocums\_joe\_or\_slocum\_joes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/4eirw4/slocums_joe_or_slocum_joes/)
---
It‚Äôs not a Molotov, so I‚Äôm guessing it might work. I‚Äôm a solo built so can‚Äôt check. Can anyone test and confirm this works? 
---
Maybe the. you get the team to all to pool in on copper and plastic, to help with the costs of the public service you‚Äôre providing them :) 
---
Whenever a piece of armor is listed on my favorites wheel, I always worry that I might eat it if I select it.
---
Other guy asked what your max is?
---
I use a semi auto handmade and still it annoys me so much. I have to farm a lot of ammo for little playtime and this bug makes it 100 times worse. 
---
Shhh, we don't talk about that...
---
I stopped using excavator when I found the calibrated shocks for my t-60 but yeah that extra is nice.
---
That was happening before and the glitch where you didn't get the weight seems to be caused by them trying to fix the extra weight but they rolled it back.
---
This a million times. I had 5 power armors in my stash once. It was so annoying.
---
Jesus, have a little bit of patience
---
And faith.
---
I've tested the assembly myself. Character has Agility of 7 (base) but with Herd Mentality and Strange in numbers is acutally 10. Action boy level 3 equipped with the jetpack torso refills AP from zero in 13 seconds. With the Core Assembly torso the AP regen from zero is 6.5 seconds. Halfs AP regen time. Plan to repeat on alt character and without Action Boy to see if it always halfs the base time (suspect that it will). This doesn't impact the total AP pool, just the recharge time, handy but not essential. One noted effect that from 100% AP I can jump in the air (with marsupial and bird bones) and the AP will be fully regenerated by the time I land. Bouncy...
---
No, but his kids will be if he plays too many games.
---
Jesus, flux is easy to get. Maybe instead of spending the time typing this string of bitchings, you could have farmed the flux you needed in half the time. Seriously go play farmville if that's what you wanna do.
---
I also wanted this for DS3 really bad
---
I will go slumming and bang your mother into next Tuesday if this game goes F2P.
---
It's a game at the end of the day. I mean don't get me wrong but I don't want to spend my free time doing "inventory management" instead of exploring the wasteland and enjoying the game. It's tedious right now and increasing the level cap would help balance it. Right now I have multiple weight reduction perks at the expense of damage, which means more bullets used to defeat enemies, which means more resources required to make more bullets, which means more stuff to scavenge and carry and organize. It's not fun, it's a game, it's supposed to be fun not tedious.
---
There‚Äôs a few notes in the game. I‚Äôll see if I can pull ‚Äòem up when I get home. I know for sure that the inconsistency is there in both games and I noticed them right away because I have nothing better to do with my free time. 
---
I know that level 40 is the max for mole miners.  And I've never gotten a max level legendary from a low level ghoul in whitesprings.  I thought their level affected the level of their loot.  But, the way this game runes, I suppose anything is possible =P
---
Once again, talking out of your ass. How do you even breathe while you spew just so so much shit? 
---
Because you SUCC BIG SCORCHED BALLS!
---
Or because you forgot to put your scrap in your stash. 
---
When I'm low on steel and lead, Flatwoods is very useful.  The motel has a weight room with several barbells.  If someone already took them, server hop and they should appear.  Steel is pretty much everywhere, so if you need a bunch, tag it for search in your pipboy (on PC it's C for component view in the junk tab and space to tag scrap for search).  On my sniper character, I have lead permanently tagged for search, and rat poison is the best source because you get lead and steel, and it doesn't weigh nearly as much as barbells.
---
Picking up enemy firearms is a solid source of steel.  Without any perks, a simple 10mm will give you 6 steel, and assault/combat rifles will give you 8 or so, plus rubber and wood.
---
The penitentiary is another great spot to source lead, steel and screws all at once, plus a handful of expensive straight jackets.  It's a big interior, and if you take a nap before going there, you'll probably get a good bit of xp clearing the dozens of mutants or ghouls out of the place while you're at it.
---
During the day I'll get dropped, 9 pm to midnight I'm usually good with no drops. 
---
There is less people online at those later times too.
---
It's just like a normal generator
---
Its the fluid inside the shower that requires the flux. Its like an anti venom to a snake bite. You need the source of your radiation to cure it.
---
You‚Äôre the hero my OCD-addled brain needs. 
---
Same
---
This exact thing is what made me think of it
---
I thought all legendary super mutants healed automatically at some point during the fight. is this not the intended effect? I figured it was a function of their being legendary.
---
&gt;  This may have been posted before but I'm unsure so here it is.
---
It has. 
---
It is a fairly common frustration. I'm a collector. I'm the kind of guy who wants a full set of every power armor in the game, even if I only ever wear 1 or 2. Having to cycle between 5 or 6 frames before finding my Excavator when I want to go out gathering is a headache. 
---
Hell, I'd be happy with just being able to rename the frames. 
---
Seems super random.  I've found both the Marine wetsuit and the Marine chest piece plans in Welch.  Hardly common though.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Broadsider_(Fallout_76)
---
Note "damage type: ballistic".
---
Nothing in the game files points to the Broadsider as being an explosive weapon. Not even in-game logic suggests it, as the ammo that it fires, cannonballs, are crafted with 10 lead and NO GUNPOWDER.
---
I'm not really seeing this thirst or hunger problem on PS4...
---
Hmm patience....seriously :/
---
How many replies does it take?
---
It helps to have Batteries Included to reduce the weight by 90% so it's only 4 really. My character is currently a Jill-of-all-trades so she has the intelligence to allow it.
---
Yes, it is almost as if that was entirely the point and you weren't smart enough to cobble together that not-concealed-at-all fact, or read the post, and simply band wagoned on the herd mentality of others who also read none of it and commented regardless.
---
before i quit allmost a week ago i used to alt f4, it was faster than menu and reloading and you allways had a new server.. (kinda sad how we grow custom to automatically avoid bethesda bugs and accept them this way)
---
I would be perfectly okay with this, more realism and more IMMERSION.
---
Get a shovel because I think your going deep into necrophilia.
---
Never mentioned anything about legendary mobs but yes those do heal and are intended. The bug is damage healing basic enemies an was gone but brought back with the most recent patch.
---
Yeah bro I see... I dont have much and reading his posts there is no way I can compete with his offers ... he appears to have max caps and all kinds of legendary items...  Can I just get the deep pocket arms for the 100 caps? 
---
A lot of dark souls players thought my name had to do with making a chaos scythe in game or something. I've used the name chaoscythe since playing counterstrike before steam existed 
---
Nope!
---
yeah it's prob cos you must put junk in your stash now for it to work with anything :/
---
Surprised this hasn't been fixed already tbh.
---
Then be my fucking guest and check the weapon yourself. 
---
I fucking have the weapon. I have checked it.
---
I'm not offering bullshit I "found" on the internet.
---
Again you are linking a fu king wiki that copied their FO4 entry to FO76.
---
No. They‚Äôre literally just stash boxes with a cosmetic makeover
---
Yeah. If I find another, i guarantee, its yours
---
K.
---
Actually that's just a mess up with the game. Itll show ammo you've used when in your last fight as if it disappeared. I've tested it a few different ways and came to that conclusion. First time it happened to me it showed mini nukes being taken from me and I made sure that bastard didnt run off with them...erhm...I mean float off.
---
Would be great if it was automatic while still keeping the little sound and animation when it works :) 
---
Agreed. I don't care how much something costs if I was never going to buy it in the first place. Only thing I've gotten is the astroturf floors and I still have over 5000 atoms waiting for them to drop something - anything - remotely cool.
---
Oops *handmade
---
If you nuke Watoga does it make more of the robots legendary? I keep wanting to try this.
---
Private servers were scheduled for the end of this year, along with modder's (maybe) is what Bethesda said...i know there word is as good as chocolate fire guard's at the moment but its what they said pre launch at least.
---
15 str, Melee perks, Radicool, full unyielding, solar power, lone wanderer, nerd rage, adrenaline, adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, talons with adrenaline stacks my bloodied powerfist is hitting 4k+. I could proc revenant, eat some str+melee dmg food, drink some whiskey with Party Boy card, take psychobuff, use bobbleheads and magazines and pretty sure I could get 8k damage. But just standing around with low health high rads not doing anything my powerfist damage is over 1k. With Barbarian, Fireproof,  Lone Wanderer, Serendipity, Nerd rage and Dodgy, you're actually insanely tanky for being such low health and no PA. This is what I run      
---
I like to call it the [BDSM](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f19938b&amp;d=s92ss2sv2se2sf2pe0er2eh2e31eu0c72c81cu1ir2a12a04la2l71lt2lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=) build. Bloody Drunk Super Man. The more of a beating I take the stronger I get.     
---
If you're in a party, more than solo, the cards will change obviously.
---
It's also a FALLOUT game. Plus enemies are like actual tanks. You need tons of ammo regardless and then you need to scavenge for resources repeatedly. Sure it's a survival game but it's Fallout not invortory management simulator.
---
i quit allmost a week ago, but up till then, it DID work.. i alt f4 every time to rotate, never failed...
---
relaunching from back to menu was a coinflip.
---
blocking a player pretty much worked too but im not sure it was 100% or not.
---
however... if they have more hidden patch notes  or "accidental side effects / features / bugs" it would not surprise me.. it sounds exactly in the path of expectations at this point (unfortunatly... )
---
Prob with r/filthycasuals (I‚Äôm a fan!) is that the audience is less interested in the technical aspects of the game. And these posts assume you‚Äôre deep into the game and kinda heavy on the technical aspects. 
---
So they‚Äôre better off here. 
---
Yo wait, I only typed one of these. This is trippy
---
No need to be a ass, man. The community managers here already said they're working on a roadmap and will eventually show us. 
---
Oh
---
Check to see if you can Repair all Structures, and make sure you have enough copper to run wires.  They're just always-on, and they don't require fuel or anything once built to produce 100 power.
---
Bethesda's idea of soon :/
---
‚ÄúCan do‚Äù works on ALL trash cans. One run through the white spring resort nets me a decent amount of non perishable food
---
Check the suitcases and cash register ;-)
---
The entire interior of the vault exists behind that door with lore entries and everything but it won't open till Bethesda can be arsed to release it.
---
It is definitely odd with such a wide loot variations. generally my legendaries are fairly lackluster generally one to two stars from her. I have never gotten a serum plan from. 
---
I don't necessarily mind a 20 to 30 minute long fight but the loot pool has to be worth it in order for me to want to take advantage. and I feel with the general inconsistencies that the community has been getting it is just simply not worth the resources or time. 
---
Low-level players joining has been an issue in the past as well making the fight tremendously more difficult than it needs to be. 
---
Yeah except I was supposed to get off to go to sleep for work in the morning....aaaaaand I was on until 2 in the morning.
---
I've read that bounties from damaging camps are based on the number of hits they do to the camp. So, an orbital strike would only count as one hit, even though it could level an entire camp.
---
Is this bulk?
---
An ass?? Seriously, how long does a road map take to get done? Its not like there up to much else is it.
---
Maybe if they get there pad and pens out and start work  on the road map they will stop breaking the game with there crappy patches!
---
You guys are mad though, something as easy as a road map shouldn't take months to hare with customers, you get that right or does the blind fanboism make you blind to common sense?
---
 The game has lots of bugs, Its a Fallout game. 
---
 My Sneak works about right. You do get in some places extended Danger and Caution notices but they are rare for me. As I was in a hurry I ran and sneaked away from my local level 50 Scorchbeast today instead of killing her and my new third point in sneak works great.
---
 Mutations and Radworms, yup they'll fix that. ;)
---
 I have not noticed any particular accelerating of food and water notifications. I make a point of being well fed and hydrated so I would notice. My Armor is degrading slowly and its nearly all Scorchbeast damage, its not very fast. ;) Gun and Sword are degrading normally. I dunno.
---
 Servers are about the same for my PC game. Certainly irritating and the biggest problem I see.
---
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's weird network stuff in action, well the healing enemies anyway.
---
 The patch fixed the exploders and they sure fucked up bobby pins, but I'm not upset by this patch.
---
 I have some 450 hours in this one and many thousands in the other Fallouit 3D games. I have taken my plan whore and turned him into a Gentleman of the Mire where he lives and generally keeps order in his part of the world. Daily walks to The Whitespring bring all kinds of unexpected events and we did 3 level 80 Beasts there a day or so ago. That was fun in BOS Heavy Combat with all the trimmings. Rads were a problem but I guess I could have put on the X0-1 I had in my pocket. We'll get a fucking Jet Pack someday. ;) 
---
These already exist...
---
I'm not being toxic, just stating a fact 
---
It was a really cool moment when Codsworth called me Reyes. I was like "what? how?"
---
Nice touch.
---
Same as here, h3adshotfox77, add me and when I get back on I can hook you up with lots of crap including ammo.
---
Once you get last 30 or 40 those problems are far less noticeable,  things like ammo Smith and super duper start putting out enough ammo on craft to be far less burdensome. 
---
I don't even bother locking the fusion core extractor now, since they undid the nerf on how fast they are produced. I figure if somebody comes by and takes some, they need them, and it'll probably be full up again by the time I make it back anyway.
---
I feel like people already do this with the available containers. 
---
I have a large farm in CAMP.  All that food can be sold for 1 gold each.  
---
I grab every single bit of scrap I ever see until I'm over-encumbered.  I bulk and sell it.  
---
I sell weapons instead of scrapping them!  This is a BIG DEAL, lots of money from weapons.  
---
Lots of other tricks out there.
---
Same as any other generator, it just produces a lot more power than they do.
---
Nah whats really sad is that so many people are ready to accept mediocrity and bad service.
---
I've been there many a night lol.
---
That photo looks familiar.....is that what they used to call the "Hitler's Hospital?"  I think I read an article about it once and that photo looks like one I saw in it.
---
Yeah I had mentioned this in an earlier post somewhere. No matter how you look at it. It is P2W...or at least pay for buff
---
that would make the game way easier and make character builds even less important.
---
Why do you morons want to ruin this game so much?
---
I got a legit explosive shot gun. So very nice.
---
Interesting if it's some magic combo.
---
The only reason being a crashed server is likely wiped before it's rebooted, if the same instance is EVER rebooted lol
---
They're great for a fireworks display.
---
A compelling argument.
---
Thanks Man I really appreciate you working with me.. its a real struggle to get caps.. I guess I need to start saving and selling stuff here instead of giving it all away or selling it to the vendors
---
added you as friend on xbox from work will be only in about an hour..
---
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
Yes.  I got the complete marine set at harpers ferry in the display cases just straight from the fast travel spawn point.  Granted, it took a month of checking every time I played, but I finally got them all, including wetsuit and tactical helmet.
---
TBH even Bethesda said majority of the people are banned because of items numbers. My friend got banned also by crafting and I am pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt cheat. 
---
Nowadays people can only read so much and then will put their own mind to interpret stuff they want to see/think. 
---
To be fair, Bethesda's not done anything thus far to instill much faith in them.
---
Its a trick to make you happy when you do finally get in the servers then have to play the micro management game with your food / water / ammo stash space.
---
I sent you a private message 
---
yea luckily i'm a hoarder and have a stockpile of black titanium! 
---
Are you on Xbone? 
---
Oh yay.  A different youtuber parroting the same story
---
I got this yesterday, just scrap and replace, easy fix! 
---
They had a road map before release that Chris Mayer talked about in the NoClip documentary. I think it assumed the beta would be over quicker, and possibly had new staff underwritten by the game's sales. 
---
They're probably trying to figure out how much they can actually get out, what gets pushed back or cancelled, in such a way to guarantee no changes.
---
I'm really hoping it's soon though. Anticipation is getting too much
---
Not sure if this thread is still being monitored, so forgive me for needlessly tagging you, /u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
I'm a huge stickler over mouse sensitivity, and I've noticed a strange bug that's occurring on my end. Whenever I'm standing in power armor, my aim velocity on the X and Y axes is what I have it set to normally. However, when I'm crouched/sneaking while in power armor, the Y axis's aim velocity is half that of the X axis. I can share my .ini files with you if you'd like, as I've made a couple tweaks here and there that could be causing it.
---
And while I'm replying, I'd also like to ask if you guys would be willing to implement a different sensitivity setting for the Aim-Down-Sights mechanic? I use two different sensitivities for the hip and for aiming and having the ability to set a different one for ADS would be exemplary!
---
No need for name calling. We're paying customers providing an opinion. Don't like it then downvote and move on. No need to act like a smart ass.
---
I think so, I just Googled it and the first image looks a match. 
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll try that
---
Do you know which ones ar the rarest? i have a pink hat and green dress
---
Well, if it was abandoned in the 50s or 60s, it would; that's the time period most of Fallout's architecture and interior design is based on, after all. That said, that could absolutely be the medical wing of Project Purity from the start of Fallout 3.
---
Im the same way. I sell most 1* to vendor and keep the rest to sell to people. If I have something that goes awhile without selling, ill sell it to a vendor as well
---
Also, he hasnt replied yet, so if you get home before he replies or if he doesnt beat the 900, then its yours.
---
There are different player types. There is a definitely a couple of player types that are pissed off. The Try-Hards that raced to end game content are bored. The Ebayers that bought dupes TSEs for their exploited god mode are angry. The Squeekers that can‚Äôt stand grinding and want instant gratification are annoyed.
---
It is a MadMax world out there. The rest of us are spraying chrome over our faces and waiting to enter the halls of Valhalla. 
---
&gt;And follow FFXIV's example.
---
I don't think they can afford to. FFXIV needed to do that to keep people subscribed. They stood to make money by fixing it. Even if they fixed FO76 it probably wouldn't make much more money. Just their carelessness gave it too shitty of a reputation too quickly to really recover I think.
---
As the other poster wrote, those containers are already in the game. What we need is a way to tag them after we put something in so that the next player is alerted to it. As it is now, the best I can do is drop an extra paper bag on top of the suitcase.
---
 The connector is on one end on the top. ;)
---
I'm relatively silent. Mainly because I haven't been playing the game lately. I wouldn't assume that the majority of people not posting are happy with the game. 
---
Agreed.  Many of us don't have the perfect plan for a build from Level 1 on.  I focused on luck, an ability I no longer need with my HP and weapons, so above 50 I'm moving points and building a PA/Heavy build.  
---
It's a slow process, but it's part of the game.
---
I imagine all the colors or pretty rare, but specific ones are much more popular than others.
---
Got any Magazines or Assassin's armour?
---
So cool, whether it is or not.  I am obsessed with abandoned buildings.  There is an abandoned chemical plant here in WV that I have snuck in to and it looked straight out of fo76 (green water and everything).  Same w/ an elementary school near Fayetteville.
---
I've been trying...  (ModAuthor)  
---
They won't give us a roadmap to modding until the game is stable, which is why I keep trying to isolate, find fixes for and report bugs...  
---
\*shrug\*
---
to be very honest, for me personally they have passed the point allready.
---
i have uninstalled the game a few days back after not playing it pretty much 6.5 days ago.
---
i actually saved up some game-money budget for this game.. but felt like i would waste money and theres other games coming too that are totally in my sights...
---
the thing that allmost hurts is; why are they not seeing what they are doing to the F76 game and the playerbase thats got to be shrinking badass by now i think?
---
its like they are doing the EXACT opposite of what ppl are allmost spamming on all channels and their mothers, then ruin it on top of it by creating a random number of new side effects
---
I don‚Äôt ever have an issue with water and food, but keeping the meters full doesn‚Äôt add any extra fun to the game IMO.  Same with repairs really.  It is pretty much just extra work to consume more time.
---
First of all, I used two different sites to show you the same information. It even benefits from the Heavy Gunner perk, which specifically states NON-EXPLOSIVE weapons.
---
I don't know what else to tell you. The proof is right there in front of you. Keep being an idiot if you want, whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
Ypu are better off doing it your self. That insures its actually done because at this rate it ain't coming 
---
Neither of those games were this broken for this long.
---
I'm glad you guys enjoyed the video. I am working on other glitches to build camps. I have a few new videos up now with more coming later!
---
Thanks for all the support!!!
---
Level 67? No offense, but I'm not surprised you couldn't solo the Queen. That Gatling Gun should be a good weapon to use against her, though; AA heavy guns tend to chew through Scorchbeasts, Her Majesty included. 
---
Does the Armorer perk have to be active for your armor to have more durability while in use, or just at creation?
---
bulk 1 star assassins rolling pins 
---
This is the point, here.  
---
The game is designed to force you to choose.  It's not a Min/Max game.  The game is easy enough that you could play as a sniper without ever adding points to perception, play as a melee without ever adding points to strength.
---
Wanting to Max every perk in a specific field for super specialisation isn't permitted with the 50 points, because you have to denude a lot of other perks.  I like it.  But I accept that many don't.
---
They're usable.  Just not convenient.
---
I had to call it quits on xbox Sunday night AU time zone, when I server hopped about 8 times and landed in the same one again and again and again and again
---
That should have been a Saturday in US time... 
---
Back to Warframe for awhile methinx
---
I get where you are coming from but inventory managment was always a part of these kind of games. And every fallout had it too. 
---
Sorry. I was talking about controls. I agree the way loot is given could be changed, but the actual putting your cursor and seeing things, and how everything on the game can be picked up, I dig
---
Yeah or store and replace 
---
&gt; It's a thing to want to acquire all the plans in the game. For the love of all the...   
---
They actually need to fix the quests that are supposed to give you plans as a reward.  
---
Quite a few of them give the same few Tier 1 plans 187/200 times (Think of how large that data point that actually is) and the other 13/200 times it rarely breaks tier III.
---
Look in the game
---
For the love of fucking God, I will give you a Broadsider so you can see it with your own eyeballs
---
I do not give a shit what half assedly maintained wikis say about weapons no one uses
---
If you aren't even willing to look for yourself in the game, I don't give a living fuck about what you think
---
I understand why we can't sell ammo.  I do, really.  It's already way too easy to hit the 1400/day cap as is.  And you can already sell ammo.....to other players.  
---
But scrapping it for lead/steel/plastic/powder....that would be nice.  Maybe they could give us a bulking system, like junk has, and we can either sell the bulk ammo, or somehow scrap the bulk ammo, not to break it open, but to actually scrap it.  Not sure how that would work, but at least its something.  
---
Although, I will say...if they make ammo scrappable...they need to DRASTICALLY reduce the per piece weight of Lead Scrap.
---
when you enter fort defiance, do the outfits spawn to the area right of the entrance, or left also?
---
I applaud you! Thank you for all the input :)
---
It's not about Duper's who collect weight gear, it's the standard players that do
---
thats pretty neat
---
I got this image from /R/AbandonedPorn . 
---
Finally a post that doesnt try to convince me to uninstall the game. 
---
I'm just curious now to see if Bethesda have any follow through at all!
---
For months now they've been saying were passing this on and that on to the dev team to fix....but still nothing gets fixed or done. Even when they do attempt it they break more than they fix and then roll back to before the damn fixes :(
---
As far as gaming companies go at the moment they are pathetic. 
---
Almost a month ago they started mentioning this road map and still nothing, its weak Bethesda :/
---
Ooohhh a new sub for me!  TY!!!
---
People burn out after 1 hour, the game flopped pretty badly.
---
Because the point of trolling is to make people angry, especially when they have little or no method of recourse. Most survival players will be there exclusively for PVP and will likely be just as OP as the potential troll. 
---
The most recently equipped frame should be the first in your inventory.
---
But they should definitely add something to differentiate between frames. Maybe showing equipped pieces?
---
I have a friend, a fellow mod author who had a casual communication relationship inside the community, who it took about 2 months.  
---
Another it was a couple weeks...  
---
Seems very random.
---
hahaha player made road maps could be a good thread :D
---
Once i found **54 High Radiation Fluids** on the blue suitcase!
---
Agreed. I know it was originally probably a joke but...I like that idea
---
All I can think about now is the skyrim Thomas the tank engine video. 
---
Original without the shitty hdr https://m.imgur.com/dqdTXyB. [Also small article about it](http://5thingsilearnedtoday.com/blog/2014/5/2/stunning-photos-of-the-abandoned-beelitz-heilsttten-red-army-military-hospital-by-robert-gtzfried)
---
I mean it's the first fallout where weight is an issue. You have limited stash and limited perks, so can't reasonably build your character without sacrificing major perks and that's all fine but it's unnecessary sacrifice due to the way the perks are. Like why does it need 9 whole points for only 60% more damage. Higher level just seems more reasonable to me personally.
---
I made the mistake of getting Perfect Storm around level 17 but that gun carried me through tight battles well into level 35-40
---
Mine has been all over the place too. I'm in Lvl 45 everything Excavator PA I'll start the game with 500-550 carry weight, get out to do something and I'm down to 350. I'm running full marine deep pocketed everything and out of PA I can carry 300, jump back in and 350 is all I get. WTF, lol.
---
Yeah, honestly looks like the ratio of dicks to decent people is higher on Xboxes, sorry.  
---
Only way to get it. Plus players are better at this shit then the company. Hence modded games are always better or fix the mistakes
---
    
---
Half of it comes from a "selfish" place, I won't lie, I freaking want a stable, functional game ;)
---
It's my experience. 4 our of 15 tries. Not all the time but enough to get me to stop trying. And dont forget the perfect set up guys that down her before I can even load.
---
Mama Dolce's is the best source of Cobalt I've ever seen.  Nuking the grafton area netted me a ton of violet.  I'm actually lowest on Crimson right now.  I know what gives it, I just haven't found a good farm place for it.
---
I don't want it more like FO4. Why make a game that's just the same as a previous game, only the setting is different? Sorry, I like moving forward, not stagnation.
---
Slocums joe is a cafe
---
Slocum joes is a restaurant
---
That‚Äôs what I thought fallout 4 was showing me, but I‚Äôve never thought on it too much
---
I sell costumes. Halloween skeleton nets me 60 caps a pop and cost 5 plastic 2 cloth. Weigh 0.1 lbs. so doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of stash space. I don‚Äôt even bother carrying around guns to sell. The weight to cap ratio is trash in comparison 
---
Scrap ammo, craft new ammo with the parts, even different types of ammo?  No way the engine could handle that.
---
It‚Äôs how many times destroyed.
---
My understanding is this is the risk. It's easy to die often with this build. The core intent is to destroy before they can get to you with sheer damage.
---
Water??  You mean bullets right I just dumped 4000 shotgun shells(I know! I like to hoard things)
---
It‚Äôs based on how many items have been destroyed.
---
The most recently equipped frame should be the first in your inventory
---
Negative. PC my dude. 
---
It always was. Just that you could stash shit you never will need again didn't mean you could bring it on you. 
---
I agree it isn‚Äôt hard.  It just doesn‚Äôt add any fun to the game.  I think that I‚Äôd prefer it if the meters emptied slower and edible food and water was harder to come by.  It‚Äôs just a chore.
---
Question do you use Power Armor?  
---
If yes do you use a Targeting HUD Mod?  
---
If yes again...  
---
[\[Bug Fix\] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/)
---
&gt;I name all my characters ridiculous things for laughs.
---
my main character is named "Hodd Toward"... (no joke) (lvl 130)
---
He either attacked them back and/or ‚Äúseek revenge‚Äù and they were free to attack his base. If they wrecked his base and he didn‚Äôt attack back they would not have a bounty of 20.
---
Sound like he fought back and got shit on.
---
Int that high is still a thing?  Damn this broken game
---
Sorry to hear all that. I have not had this level of issues.
---
I started losing interested after level 50, launched a nuke and played a little longer, hit level 75 and just couldn‚Äôt find a reason to want to continue. Got over 100 hours out of it though so I guess I can‚Äôt complain too much.
---
All of this would be great, /u/B3ximus, I agree, or even tabs within the stash boxes.
---
It seems they used your idea. That's been working out great, i heard the game is a huge hit.
---
Never knew that, I'll have to give it a try.
---
You would love nowadays Fukushima photos. It looks like any post-apo movie environment. 
---
Ok thanks
---
**Rad Worms.**
---
Awesome, thank you so much! 
---
Commie Whacker?  Watoga Highschool (though you may need to server hop if it's all yellow)
---
So your problem is that you entered the wrong code and only had 1 keycard? I don't see how that's not totally your own fault.
---
The whole launch code thing is super annoying in my mind just let me put in a key card and launch the nuke. It‚Äôs such a hassle to look it up I‚Äôd be happy to go and find the key card and launch codes if there was just some way I could deposit them all into the enclave bunker and it gave me an active key card which I could then launch the nuke with I hate typing in the code so I refuse to launch it at all. 
---
Could you imagine if nuclear bombs actually did decent damage? Lol what a silly thought, I know. 
---
TFW you realize bulk Ultracite Explosive Vents would actually be good for something at least...
---
I still think it can work with bolstering trapper armors that have the +25 rad resist perk on them + rad resist perks and rad sponge.  I was able to do it with my friend (with normal trapper armor) and we could survive the nukes.  If we stayed apart for a second it meant permanent rad damage tho.
---
Are you sure this isn't Bioshock?
---
Yes!  I follow Fukushima and Chernobyl stories.  There's a sad beauty to it, at least that's what I see.
---
To put that I just wrote another way, they're trying to figure out if people calling the company "pathetic" and "weak" are going to make investing in content over the next few years a loss leader. 
---
They're human beings, and you don't have to talk like that. This game was people's lives for years and this wasn't deliberate. 
---
I dunno. I had someone flatten half of my large, 3-story camp (no PvP, no workshops, wasn't on a team), and they only had a bounty of 10 when I logged off.
---
What?! I didnt see this. Hopefully they change their mind but I have adjusted my gameplay so it isn't a huge issue. I was so disappointed when I noticed they changed it and assumed they fucked up. 
---
That's kind of the point. I can't store stuff. So I need to carry it on me. Hence why I require the weight reduction perks. In the previous games all the things you didn't need, just store em and take em out when required. So weight reduction wasn't an issue. Atleast not in the form it is in this game.
---
They fixed the fusion generator spawn rates a few patches ago so it's 8 an hour. If this happened more recently and they still didn't appear I'd say the screen was bugged. If you had fast traveled to your workshop then they probably would have appeared. I just go on vendor runs and come back afterwards to get them. 
---
Not right now, but let me get back to you once I have one available. Only have a lvl 35 Assassin's Explosive Shotgun on me now (this one still one-shots enough high level enemies that I won't give it away just yet), but RNGsus has been good to me this week so far. Feel free to add me, PSN: miskhak.
---
Thanks for the feed back. I know about the port-a-john but as a builder of many bases I'd just love to make a bathroom in my house. This was more of me hoping that Bethesda saw this and would consider adding it to the atom shop or something. 
---
It's Slocum's Joe.
---
It's a bit awkward.  It's meant as "Slocum's Coffee," but the odd possessive reminds me of Carl's Jr.
---
Man this game must be a wake up call for hoarders. 
---
Welcome to the club. Now for the jetpack and calibrated shocks :)
---
If there's a blue suitcase at the vendor, I drop stuff I don't need there.
---
If there's no blue suitcase, I use the cash register (till for you brits).
---
At Whitesprings Station, I use the sack on the right of the tinker's bench.  It's hard to miss, especially when there's usually some delicious and enticing imitation seafood right next to it.
---
During a whitesprings nuke (or even just a normal whitesprings farm), the de facto rummage sale seems to be in the ice chest just to the left of the golf club front door.  
---
Of course I want people to find the things I leave for them, but if they've got somewhere to be right away, I don't feel sad that they missed something special.
---
I just rolled up a melee/power armor alt last Friday, hit lvl 30 today, and I'm already dumping quite a lot of scrap, ammo, plans and assorted food/water for others.  I hardly use ammo, but I pick up .45, .50, 5.56, 5mm and shotgun shells because I know they're common ammo that others use.  If I found a few dozen .45, 5.56 and a pile of lead in a suitcase while playing my main sniper character, I'd be jazzed up.
---
Was really hoping for a better story.  Congrats on the 27 caps.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôve never played with a group, though! 
---
So basically get rid of the Targeting HUD mod until they patch it? Thanks for the info, I was using that and that's when I started noticing a lot more crashing than usual, but not an insane amount. However the lock ups didn't happen nearly as much until this hot fix, could that still be the reason?
---
I dont like people completly closing in their camps. We have to work together to rebuild not build ego homes. Never got griefed thankfully.
---
I thought it was kinda funny and cute, sorry you was disappointed.
---
Based on how nerfs keep pooping out. I agree unfortunately I feel like they will be a higher abuse on perk cards. 
---
Let‚Äôs get them to fix the game first. 
---
Psh, everyone knows fatman doesn't do enough damage to kill anything
---
Yeah, it's Radworms.  That disease became bugged in Patch 5 and one of the things it sometimes does is cause Marsupial to stop working.
---
Melee, melee and melee. If that fails try using melee.
---
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
---
Thanks for sharing. Hopefully this works when I reinstall the game after the next expansion 
---
Never ever seen that.
---
Gives a +15 thirst quench to everyone in your party that's next to you
---
...get the kids to play so you have packmules.  Genius!
---
i have all the plans except the torso and helmet :(
---
i dont think the helmet plans are there right?
---
Exactly, I use .45, 5,56, and 5mm rounds, yet I have 1000+ of .38 and 10mm I‚Äôm never going to use so I just drop it, making it a complete waste. 
---
All explosives are terrible. Why are you holding on to those paper weights?
---
I wish I was in an empty server... *mouth watering at the thought of farming at all of the workshops*
---
Don‚Äôt worry the way patches come out this will never happen. 
---
Yes and thank you!
---
My hunting rifle does more damage than a rocket launcher. Bethesda, why?
---
It would be nice if it did. You know if you have beer in your stash and have a cooler and then it made the beer into cold beer. T-T I keep reading post that make me wish something happened that never did. T-T 
---
What you mean someone worked on this for years of there life? I think they should stop and go back to working on Raspberry Pi programmes tbh :(
---
Most of the damn thing was ripped straight from FO4 you know that right? Or do you mean the worked really hard on the Atom store?
---
If they've fucked up they need to come out and say as much officially then, not hide behind shill's fanboi's and useless CM's who's only agenda is to dowse the flames and offer no real help or support to customers.
---
They may have worked on it really hard and really long....we're the ones that are expected to pay for it though and then what just go away quietly whilst they work out the best way to bin the failure off?
---
You left the vault with intent to rebuild and help others, I did not. :)
---
The stalker melee weapons are just trash to everyone tho. They have no positive effect.
---
I‚Äôm confused on this. Couldn‚Äôt you just leave the server as soon as it‚Äôs happenings. Just ‚úåÔ∏è out of the situation? 
---
Uhhh... a what‚Äôs house, now?
---
Yes / No.  
---
Something changed in the mid-Jan patch in introduced a ton of instability (though it's improved for some).  
---
Finding this took me from 9+ Crashes an hour to 1 or 2 an hour, which pre-MidJan patch I had ZERO CTD's previously in 3 months of non-stop play.
---
Hahaha,
---
This was a nice little happy ending surprise. 
---
Eh, I don't bother with those anymore.  Just hit Fort Defiance and trip Line in the Sand.  Two full cores with a decent chance of BP from SB and a pile of loot to pawn.
---
It artificially extends playtime
---
üòÇ well I did get a few workshops and farming at the whitespring done so there was a silver lining. 
---
glowing fungus will give crimson flux. like the ones in the pink forest by prime
---
But to max Lone Wanderer you need 4 points, don't you?
---
No wonder... but... why?
---
How so? Besides agility affecting all weapon types, only one stat would affect damage at a time. If you want to get unyielding to raise all your stats to make you more versatile, that's a choice you could make and yes, the price of doing that would be it uses up your slots that could be used for other events. I don't see how it would require anyone to do anything. It more maked other weapon types work more like melee builds and no different than how melee currently works.
---
I'm not worried about min/max and establishing a single meta. I'm proposing we bring up the bottom end of damage dealt by everyone that isn't currently using melee. It doesn't nerf anything and only makes everything else stronger.
---
If it turns out that it's too easy to overload SPECIAL points and do more damage than intended, put a hard cap on the bonus. Make 15 points be the max and anything beyond that doesn't affect combat performance.
---
Maybe, but why? Not like it costs a lot to repair your camp.
---
Yeah , probably the most frustrating bug. 
---
Seems to prevent all non-melee and grenade damage to all enemies until re-log and isn't really related to server connection or latency. 
---
It feels like I encounter it more often when i use sneak attack + crits with automatics? Some kind of overkill prevention gone haywire?
---
I dont see your problem. You just fucked up the keycard step which is literally the only thing you have to be careful about. 
---
Copied from my post 2d ago: 
---
Im playing solo and i decided to finally finish the I am become Death quest. I went into Silo Alpha and i expected it to be a tedious stupid task. It was surprisingly fun, the enemies are not that hard and you gotta actuall think when you want to get through it. Probably one of the more ambitious quests out there. So i prepared everything and launched the nuke (THX for the nuke codes dwellers).
---
Went to Fissure Site Prime, and we took down the queen within 8 minutes. I had a lot of fun. Lot of people helped. 
---
I have looked in the game. I've used the damn thing before. It benefits from perks that literally state that it's not an explosive weapon. 
---
But, of course, you're just going to call me a liar now. You just want it to be something it's not. Whatever, I tried, but you're just going to act like a baby. You're not my problem anymore.
---
I thought the suggestions were going into the circular file?
---
I compiled a 27+ hour (and growing) Spotify playlist that (for the most part) avoids songs already used in the series: [https://open.spotify.com/user/9lgwxpmmjbaia8zg00r4my4wh/playlist/0S2apEVCepj1hl2mmpCReM?si=IMmbg4-PRwi-hnpt\_OcKsw](https://open.spotify.com/user/9lgwxpmmjbaia8zg00r4my4wh/playlist/0S2apEVCepj1hl2mmpCReM?si=IMmbg4-PRwi-hnpt_OcKsw)

Not for those sensitive to genre-hopping, banjos, music for poor folk, steel guitar, Apocalyptic sermons, or spastic rockabilly. Needs more of RedEye's Appalachian forebear, Hasil Adkins ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasil_Adkins)).
---
I'm in the same boat.  Always near 600 and selling to all vendors.  Grahm is linked with the Watoga Station Vendor Bot so you aren't missing out on the extra 200 caps. 
---
I hope they watched the division 2 live stream because that's how its done devs and community managers talking to their consumers. In a proper video...I mean I love the division community
---
üòÇüòà topic deleted? üî• Even this post came down üî• Long live the Raiders
---
I would love to do that, literally only got the game to build anyway! 
---
This was before the last patch I went back to my camp dropped all my junk all my guns I was going to scrap all my aid that I don't use and dropped my ammo to sorry which I use and which I don't...and crashed before I could do that...haven't been on much since then.
---
Jesus. Thanks for the info, I'll definitely take it off
---
Crying about crying.  Sigh.
---
Yes please. Was assembling a level 15 set of raider for a friend. Queue 5 minutes off setting out all of my frames to find the right one.
---
So, basically everything a level 1 to 5 character does minus the dishes. Got it. Cool.
---
BTW if you could let me know if this helps, I'd be grateful, I am trying to club Bethesda over the head with this problem, to get it acknowledged, and the more posts that are related, and show a positive correlation, the better.
---
No it doesn't.
---
Are the mobs being healed or are the hitboxes off again and you have to aim a bit to the edges, or both?
---
All the times I've server hopped, only had noticed a hat that spawns on a nightstand. If I recall correctly, the right side. Never seen an outfit in the two rooms by the entrance.
---
I've noticed a lot more noobs and less 150+ players then what used to be online. I'm normally on 8 to midnight and catch a lot of 40-60 level players (my range) and like 4-6 under level 5 players and a couple 150+ players.
---
I just do my grind then go gift a new guy/gal some goodies then log off
---
The only Unstoppables costume that can be found in game is the Mistress of Mysteries dress. 
---
I might try that game at some point,
---
i did play div1 quite a lot actually, but once you got near endgame the game was just pested with aimbots and shit, got tired of that really, really fast unfortunatly, never had the patience to give it another try, also other games :)
---
This happens alot if you open your pip boy quickly after logging in. But ive never seen it persist. You found a gamebreaking bug thx for sharing that. I hope you can be freed and play again. 
---
Pumpkin farm is my goto now.  If you have the perk it's a bit over 40 just hitting the little patch to west of it.  No fuss or bother, just grab and go.  Almost no critters though.
---
I'm posting screens in one hour, see you then.
---
&gt; Odd to see positive reinforcement from you
---
Why odd? She did not chose personally to forbid stacking foundations, she is here to have a chat and collect our feedback :-) 
---
Sorry, I'm on Xbox
---
Im loggin on now.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
Braking them for mods would actually be better. 
---
They're randomized, but I usually find a magazine in the Whitespring Gold Club, downstairs in the employee's only room behind the service desk (laying face up on some boxes) and another upstairs in the bathroom that's closest to the side exit (tucked in vertically between some stuff just inside the door)
---
Need to know where the best place to find them would be. I'd like to have the jet pack at least
---
Dumped just over 350 hours and made it to level 167. Completed the main questline and most of the side quest. Participated in several nukes, buy sell tradea etc, several TSE arsenal, decked out t51 set jetpack shocks,  and couple nice super sledges. Really wasnt a point in playing anymore. Decided to take a break when Red Dead 2 released. A few weeks later I hear of a huge TSE nerf. Not that I needed to play or farm anymore anyways. Logged on just to see how bad and ya final nail in the coffin for me. I held out alot longer than most. Maybe they'll dial that nerf down or only apply it to PvP damage, which is how it should have been done. Regardless Anthem and Metro releases soon, and I might get FC New Dawn aswell. I hope they try to fix 76 up but I doubt it. Like TC said theres alot they could do but to me looks like they're more focused on PvP.
---
Right next to the faxes from corporate
---
&gt; No one wants ... both types of armour 
---
I do. Full set of legendary leathers plus T60 and Excavator. 
---
The game is literally coming apart at the seams :(
---
Thank you for typing that all out and calling them out. Autoscrapping bulk items is counter intuitive to the players. We decided to bulk it for a reason. It should not be included in scrap all. No one was asking for them to change that mechanic. 
---
So basically they should fix the in game economy. 
---
I disagree about AP being enough. Outside of VATS, which I rarely use, AP doesn't really benefit me at all.
---
It would also help boost pistols, as it would increase their fire rates without raising their base damage, keeping them from getting too powerful.
---
Tip (or rather a workaround): you can log out while they are attacking you. 
---
But you can only recycle them once by your method and it uses flux which isn't common. It's far easier to just visit common PA locations and grab the cores which a lot of people seem to be doing already
---
oh, i should have elaborated- i sit there and steal them to the point that when the other player returns there are none. lol
---
For violet flux? That's pretty awesome.
---
One of the places I've seen these show up regularly is inside the train cars to the east of the NAR Repair Yard.  You'll run into them if you follow the railroad tracks west from Watoga Station.  I've seen Marine Armor and BoS Underarmor plans there.
---
I have heard that budget increases with your level, or items get cheaper with your level, whichever works.
---
&gt; Cores are too common 
---
WHERE? I‚Äôm always running out
---
Yes please 
---
I wish I had room for that perk, but I've just got no room.
---
I'mlevel 49 and I murdered a 167 today. Got 150 caps for it too.
---
What‚Äôs the stand fast?
---
Get this junk node harvester immediately sir! 
---
I luvs me my 50cal with a heavy barrel and 4,000 rounds of ammo. 
---
Community managers often arent permitted to encourage the use of bugs or exploits in public forums. While it might be a small thing, there are very real game implications for using this exploit....besides a cool looking base I mean. It could look bad if people start abusing the bug for griefing purposes and the community manager/rep is encouraging its use.
---
Kind of suspect they don't actually play the game or know how it's done is all.
---
Yeah. This happened to me last night and went away after I exited the server and came back. It had me worried for a bid. I don't know for sure but it was probably due to rad worms.
---
I dont run melee but I think the axe doesnt have any available mods where the supersledge does.
---
It's entirely too small. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt my fault, I‚Äôm saying it wasn‚Äôt a fun experience and tbh didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense
---
Bingo. I‚Äôm carrying around 10 power cores at 96-99% charge one at 83%. When I get a core down to 12% I jet pack that sucker into oblivion.... only to not switch out what auto popped into my frame quick enough. My OCD cringes every time. I no longer pull my 100% cores out of my stash to manage weight anymore. I used to carry around 5 100% at a time.
---
I mean it could be optional. Go to a vendor and pay caps to combine charges. To be fair if I ever run low I will straight up buy a 100% fusion core from the vendor over using flux to craft one myself
---
I like the food water rate (on ps4). 
---
I can confirm that Glowing Fungus is "Fluorescent Flux"  The blast berries I believe are crimson.
---
If you could scrap/craft that would solve the issue. 
---
We just need the correct balance for it. 
---
Well no, apparently the community hates all ways of handling this.
---
Bulk used to be scrapped after resources and also after mods. Nobody cared that bulk was scrapped because losing mods was awful and costly.
---
Then neither mods nor bulk was automatically scrapped and there was an outcry about the inconvenience of manually scrapping bulk.
---
Now bulk is automatically scrapped again and there is an outcry about the wasted plastic.
---
Of course. Next time I get on and take it off I'll play for a while and let you know
---
and currently the grogsnak can't be double repaired with weapon artesian so i would go with super sledge or fire axe
---
That was a huge missed opportunity. We know the system exists to upgrade weapons because you can upgrade the MoM gear all the way up to 45. Why didn't they take the same approach to the rest of the weapons?
---
I‚Äôm running speed demon, marsupial, and bird bones. I swear that I can see the water/food bars decline in real time. My industrial water purifier and massive corn field can barely keep up. Something has definitely changed.....
---
To me Crognac is slightly better. The downside is that you cant repair it to 200% with the perk. Base damage sledge is 180 and axe are 200 for my build right now.
---
How do you guys have budget to do that kind of stuff?
---
Idiot.
---
Line in the Sand is a couple full cores and almost always trips when I stop by fort defiance.
---
I know this thread is old but damn. I just ran it and got 268 steel. Thanks for the tip man. Saves me from running around town to town.
---
Hmph. I was level 85 when I quit but Id had that camp for a shit ton of levels so maybe that's it.
---
It's a unique combat armor chest piece reward from the Early Warnings quest line. Gives bonus to sneak.
---
Except since the change it seems like you can only 'search' cap stashes about 20-25% of the time. Seems unintended.
---
Na, its just a 1* legendary.
---
I have a chest piece with its modifier plus chameleon plus +1 agi.
---
super sledge only has one mod but the sledgehammer has a wide variety of them, i bought countless mods for the super sledge only to realize they were all for the sledgehammer which is a whole different weapon
---
Ok that makes me feel better ;)
---
Everyone on reddit always knows best, reddit should control what anyone in any profession does. Because what do professionals actually know? Not more than reddit that's for sure.
---
Agreed. reduce hp and bump up damage. Dying should be feared, not ignored while you're knee deep in blood and guts grinding your way through a camp.
---
They rigged the creation engine to make it operate online. Their functions for quest giving were written for Morrowind based on a single character being given quest items, into an object oriented architecture that tracks items across multiple people and dynamically scales the map.
---
That's a nightmarish task of network engineering, and I'm sorry it doesn't impress you. It should.
---
They have said it officially. Just because they don't start the day streaming a developer hitting themself with a cat-o-nine-tails and begging for forgiveness doesn't mean they aren't sorry. 
---
Pete Hinds apologies multiple times in this and says the Devs need to work on "getting the game where it should be". Should is the operative word because it means they know there are problems. Because they're not idiots.
---

No one is asking you not to complain. I'm asking that you try and do so in a constructive way. If you get a bad meal at a restaurant, you take it back &amp; be civil, you don't tell the maitre d to go fuck themselves. If you do, you deserve to leave without your refund
---
 I'm not convinced somehow. Looks like a wiki read to me..
---
Is the regular sledgehammer better then the super is mode? Like I said I dont use melee much I'm a sneaky sniper
---
You know thats rich coming from the guy who left me a comment once that was so nonsensical I had to screenshot it because it was just that moronic no one would believe me. Never seen someone try so hard to appear intelligent but come off quite the opposite:
---
"*They hyped up a fallout multiplayer experience, which is exactly what we got* **(correct, a hyped up game that didn't meet expectations)***. 16 times the detail is actually there* **(no its not, its really not, you know math? lol)***, the game is packed with tons of foliage* **(you know thats just leaves and trees right? Those have been in videogames for quite some time lol)***, props* **(props have been in movies since the early 1900's)***, and interactables* **(sigh...nearly all videogames have something you interact with)***. We got distant weather systems* **(thats not exactly new either e.g. Dying Light, Red Dead Redemption 2, The Witcher 3)** *nukes* **(once again has been done in other games e.g. C&amp;C Red Alert, Crysis and obviously Fallout 3 &amp; 4)***, crafting materials everywhere* **(ever heard of a little game called Minecraft?)***, multiple biome types* **(Yeaaaaah never seen that in a game before)***, hidden lore* **(Who cares when its hidden behind endlessly boring computer logs and the emphasis is not on story anyway)***, more enemy AI in a fallout game than ive ever seen* **(There are different enemy types yeah but you mostly run into  Scorched and the AI is terribly bad)*****.*** *76 is the most immersive survival/multiplayer game out there imo, if you dont enjoy the game thats fine but you are wrong as hell in saying its a "bad" game.*" **(Just that entire sentence lol makes me laugh so hard).**
---
You clearly haven't got a single fart of an idea of what you are talking about as your arguments in favour were just brutally bad. Interactables, props, foliage, wtf? No man you are the one who is truly talking out of their ass here lol.
---
Why would you do that when you could bulk and sell the steel?
---
Can you trade me the plans to make the cool blue lettering you have there? 
---
The worst part would be getting the jetpack and the Cali rated shocks 
---
Depends on what you're killing. If you can get a couple of legendary Grognaks and switch, you're off to the races
---
Yep gotta use that perk
---
if you want to lock your door, someones gonna break it down. put a workbench by a window so they can select craft on it and teleport in if they want to look OP 
---
&gt;*stay* stable
---
haha, you‚Äôre hilarious 
---
I don't know what to tell ya, I got nothing (quickly goes to edit wiki).
---
Does it still aggro every bot in the enclave?
---
We need a buff to food and water. (Honestly not much +10% to basic recipes and +20% far more complex. )
---
I would be fat with the amount food/water we are currently at. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. I don‚Äôt have the extra plans but I can make any combat armor BOS for 100 caps each. 
---
The issue is, I think, that you have a ton of crap you don't need. Like chems, weapons, food and water.
---
Idk who‚Äôs cereal you shit in but your right. Just going to üÖ±Ô∏èenix I usually spawn 2-3 and that‚Äôs without even trying to find them.
---
My bad, cobalt. 
---
Never 
---
I also will not spend real money on atom shop items (except for a gillie suit). But I do spend the points I earn in game. There are a couple of tgood hings. Mainly the hard wood floors and the camo paint for the hunting rifle. I see no issue with spending points you earn from the game.
---
I do the same thing, didn‚Äôt even notice it was resetting. Thanks for the info
---
I'd also love the t60 legs with calibrated shocks. Gt is 'The big Snit' send me a friend request
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Glowing_fungus_(Fallout_76)
---
I made an edit to the wiki, I just bought the recipe for Rad Away &amp; remembered seeing a tunnel under the highway South of Abandoned Bog Town. I used green thumb &amp; went from 0 to 92 so 46 pickings down there.
---
What type of shotgun (double barrel, combat ect.) and what is the damage. Since its 2 star and low lvl can you do it for the handmade and 1500 caps.
---
I am not certain.  Their camp was a regular camp.  My camp was a regular camp.  I wasn't holding any workstations and haven't claimed any for a while.   You bring up good questions.  All I know is I saw blue smoke and it looked different from the orbital strike I called in.
---
Why does this matter in an online game? 
---
best thing is it tags all nearby creatures. You can get a lot of xp during scorchbeast queen fight by just standing in the middle
---
I'm almost positive I bought the plans from one of the vendors in Watoga.
---
This sometimes happen to me but to scorched as well, you hear them mumbling then suddenly as if someone shot them (without the noise of a gunshot), they'd drop dead. I was able observe one protectron near phoenix, he collided with a shopping cart and he dropped dead then the rest followed. Very weird, indeed.
---
The division 1 had a problem of catering to their oc crowd more then their console crowd 
---
I know! So a bad thing is that during construction I was attacked about 5 times from that direction.... plus I need to route power through the tunnel around the whole building to get to it... 
---
Could i have a picture of these plans?
---
I'm at the point where I feel a bit indifferent about Fallout 76. I am also starting to think that regardless of Bethesda's good intentions, they may not be able to *physically* fix the game in the way they need to. When you look at their more recent updates - where they fixed some things and either completely broke others, or re-introduced already-fixed bugs - it was a case of one step forward, two steps back. 
---
Of course, it's not uncommon for unexpected bugs to occur when something is patched. That happens all the time in software development. But Bethesda have never used this engine in the context of a "game as a service" experience. Its apparent clunkiness and fragility probably *isn't* so bad in a large single-player experience. But in an experience where many players are logging in every day and where the world is supposed to evolve and change over time, it could ultimately be a bridge too far.
---
Due to this situation, I find it hard to envisage a situation where they have fixed the major bugs *and* been able to add meaningful new content. Creating content and fixing bugs at the same time is tricky for a whole variety of reasons, and I think it's extra-tricky for Bethesda. There's a high risk, too, that adding new content will also pile on more bugs (or re-introduced already-squashed ones) en masse. I think that danger is very real.
---
So my perspective on this whole thing has sort of changed. Although I'm not very interested in the current experience as-is, it would normally be reasonable for me to say something like "They have a good foundation here to build on". But I don't think they physically can do what they want to do with this game - no matter how great their ideas are. I just think it's not feasible for them.
---
I hope I'm proved wrong, but the evidence so far isn't positive. I'm very much taking a wait and see attitude now.
---
That's the thing though, if i send my steak back 5 times due to the waiters, chef's fucking it up of course i'm nt going to be civil about it right?
---
How many times do you send your's back before kicking off or do you just sit there waiting for steak number 47 and for them to stumble across a way to get it right?
---
Asking when the road map they said we'd get almost a month ago is actually coming isn't being rude or mean or nasty either. Calling this mess weak isn't being mean its a simple fact, they couldn't even get the last patch right or the fix for that patch.
---
I personally think people are being a lot more civil than any of them at Bethesda deserve right now, they release a weak empty and vague ITV once a week and thing that's enough? Seriously, it just starting to look like there trying to hide away now and forget about FO76 and the customers they have an obligation to.
---
If you have Rad Worms, Jumpg height is increased. When it wears off, it nullifies the marsupial effect. 
---
yah..also.at whitespring a i see a lot of dead ghouls walking around or moving. 
---
If you play with a team yes otherwise there are some useful for solo tenderizer, lone wanders , hard bargain and the fast travel one . 
---
Yes because the drop rate for you must be the same drop rate that everyone else experiences.   There is no way, in your world, that someone can get 60 hardened mass and less than 10 high radiation fluids.   So I was able to make 10 stable flux even though I had enough of everything else to make a ton more.  I can't control the drop rates for things.  So back off.  If you don't agree that this is a problem, then make a coherent argument and discuss it.  Chiming in with a hit and run rebuke that is easily handled and dismissed doesn't actually add to the discussion.
---
The best was using VATS on a squirrel literally at my feet (cause you cant shoot anything too close to you), first shot way in front of it, 2nd way behind it, 3rd hit and killed it.
---
yes of course
---
Well seeing as 'inside the vault' hardly gives us new information and EVERY single patch since launch has been a colossal disaster then... no. It's not enough. 
---
Maybe FO76 should be brought down completely and reworked from the ground up. 
---
Prime has a lot of both. With the perk for double flora collection you can easily get a bunch of flux
---
Similar experience. Good trading opportunities to sell stuff for me with some of the legendaries I have found and kept. Made some BOS armor for lower leve lm folks who dont have the plans too.
---
Just kill 5 Scorchbeast queens and you'll get at least 1000 caps
---
It's still less silly then murdering everything in the cell so it can orbital strike dirt...  Really should have been enclave version of distant thunder.
---
I don't want this, would break immersion imo and makes it look like MMOs. The game looks a lot cleaner without it.
---
Armorer is useless. Only affects self crafted guns. Endgame is legendary armor and with no way to add mods to armor, armorer is just useless. I have it maxed bc i didnt know better. Dont waste perk points.
---
Thankfully I‚Äôm a member of the vocal minority. We always get what we want. 
---
I like the idea of putting a cap, i just feel like it is way too easy to raise the particular stat you want to raise, i mean lets just look at perception, 15 perception at base, +15 from unyielding when below 20%, +5 from the major effect of those legendaries, +3 from raider underarmor, +2.5 from herd mentality with SIN, +5 from eagle eyes with SIN, +1 from a legendary effect of your gun, +3 from certain food items, +5 from orange mentats, thats already 54.5 perception, there is also some other card that raises perception at night to bring that a little higher, thats a massive difference between someone who has 15 at base and is not using any perception boosting items or mutations
---
well there‚Äôs a ‚Äúunique‚Äù legendary sledgehammer called All Rise which is almost every two handed melee player‚Äôs main weapon at some point, but a good max level legendary super sledge can still be better. for non legendaries, i‚Äôd say sledgehammer is a lot better because you can mod it with a sharp heavy rocket and all that stuff  so its damage gets pretty high
---
shiiiiiiiiiiit you seem like a chill dude to game with, im too basic to PC tho haha 
---
Just uninstalled the game which fired up the bethesda launcher with threw a popup for rage2 into my face before I could even accept the uninstallation.
---
It's almost like they're are asking for it.
---
I'm going to read the patch notes only from now on in case a miracle happens.
---
I haven't played in ages, but The Division had the same issue of only one person being able to talk to a vendor at a time. It was even worse on that game because the vendor inventory was tied to a global reset timer, so there was a constant line of people for the first hour or so after each reset. 
---
cool..but i dont have any combat armour yet... i will.keep it in mind..thnx
---
1) I need the plastic for other things more than caps
---
2) at lower levels the extra experience helped
---
3) it‚Äôs quicker than bulking and traveling to unload it when I have other stuff to sell.
---
Terrible idea. You‚Äôd be able to equip almost every perk, rendering strategy obsolete.
---
Only via friend. 
---
The method I used was fixed in the december 4th update. I believe just this last update also added a max cap on how much xp you can gain from a single thing, so not anymore, but if the method I used had gone public by any youtber like the dupes, the game would have been an absolute mess.
---
Either someone beat you to the mines in which case just relog to server hop or you're at the wrong spot.  There's a location called Hornwright Air Cleanser #3 (or something like that.  Test site #3 is way down at the bottom of Ash Heap near the vault down there.
---
Isnt there a mutation that deals area damage?
---
I know of all rise. I also moded out a buddies sledge with a heated bladed rocket mod. I haven't seen many mods for the supersledge so I didn't realize they only had one.
---
This is the answer we all want. 
---
1. scrap ammo
---
2. Vendor limit increase
---
3. Scrap legendary(some kind of bonus)
---
4. Sell legendaries for more.
---
5. Player vendors.(I got 20,000 caps sell to me)
---
6. Fix the game. 
---
Whichever XB you log your mule into will need to be the Home XB, which will prob be your S. You can log your Gold account into the X, so you can get the  benefits of your single Gold account on both.

Crying about crying about crying

My game sometimes does this.  Relogging or completely closing the game doesn't help.  I have to completely restart my PS4 and things start to run a lot smoother.  It's a pain in the ass, but maybe try that next time?
---
What is the plan? Never heard of it.
---
&gt; didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense
---
So, prior to getting access to the nuke silos MODUS told you exactly how to decrypt the codes and launch a nuke. You can repeat these instructions at the terminals in Whitespring Bunker and if you wait until later in the week the codes will have been decrypted by the robots there as well.
---
That's just your in-game options. Players regularly decrypt and [post the codes online](https://nukacrypt.com/) immediately.
---
Please no, this is a bad idea. The RPG as it is has choice and defines class pretty well, if we muddle it more, this will just become jack of all trades with no downsides
---
If you have a weapon with good reach, the axe as an example, you could get him stuck behind gravestones and hit him through them, get rely good with parries or just try and be more aware of your surroundings, there's a music box you can get that helps on phase 2.
---
I dont know about other people but I try and shoot for selling stuff cheaper then it would be at a vender but for enough that I make more then I would get for selling it at one.
---
It did in Vegas.
---
That could be a fact or a 2017 joke
---
I agree with your point about the engine being better with a large single player experience

Except I don't think either one of them want to show their faces. According to much of the sub-reddit Pete's Twitter has been basically dead since launch (I have not checked it myself). And Todd only seems to show up when there's a new game or product. 
---
Players like you are the reason im never gonna play this shitshow of a gamemode. 
---
Someone else just posted that GameStop is selling 1x bundles with FO76 for $400.
---
Now that would be entirely too convenient.

If we could name the frame it would help, because I have a mixed set that has insane radiation resistance, that I use most of the time. Its mixed t45/t51b/t60.

Yeah pretty common bug since the beta, you on XB ? I have 2 xboxes, problem on the one but not the other. Haven't found a fix yet, let me know if you do.
---
So gamer tags don't break immersion but character names do?
---
At least when you inspect them too
---
yes. more frequent the bigger your list is.
---
Exactly same here but I want to stay fair and reasonable. I wanna feel like me and the other person both came out on top. I wouldn't mind list of what the vendors sell everything for and what they give you for each piece as well. I'm to lazy to work it all up lol
---
Looks like I triggered your dumbass so hard you dug through my profile and typed an essay about some shit that had nothing to do with you or what we were talking about. You must be super fun at parties. Or a psychopath.
---
yes. The spawning dead is awesome.
---
I was doing this one once with 2 friends and we had 1 minute to run all the way up the mineshaft. They both got out, and as I was about 100m from the exit, the quest completes and from the quest reward I get 3 missiles that make me overencumbered. I died about 5 meters from the entrance chugging nuka cola and lost hours of junk.
---
The problem is that the stash limit isn't stopping people from storing upwards to 1500 (the new carry limit per last patch) on their person. People just bypass the stash and make mule characters, which still crap out the server whenever they log on.
---
If you guys raised the stash limit, progressively lower the character max over a couple patches, and introduce a small account bound storage compartment so people can share items and resources across characters, I think you'll find that storage would be less of an issue.
---
For example, a 900 stash limit, 100 account storage shared across characters, and 1000 max on character for a total max weight of 2000 per character on server. This would raise everyone's non-character storage significantly while technically lowering the overall max weight capacity of everyone which is currently 2100 
---
I mean, what legitimate purpose would anyone have for carrying more than 1000 other than muling? So honestly, I think realistically you could lower that 1000 limit even further if you give people time enough to get their stored items sorted out.
---
I don‚Äôt care about PA but this is amazing. When the vendor system is up you will be rich. 
---
Accidentally flag the ammo as 'undroppable' like items in the MISC tab and you got yourself a deal.
---
I think my biggest problem is I have over 300 hours more than you. So essentially I have seen more of the problems I guess. Plus console, always going perform worse.
---
I've got three great camps over 3 high level characters, I have walked WV from end to end multiple times since the beginning of the BETA.
---
The bugs have kind of been a nail in the coffin the last week or so. I was already starting to get bored. Do a vendor run, farm for some legendaries, look around for events to join in, but essentially the same stuff most days with no real end-game to get involved in. The game started to become a bore, once you;ve seen it all enough times what else can you do? At least in 4, if you completed the game, you could play it again and experience a whole new story by going with a different faction, that isn't available in '76 and that;s because it is multiplayer, I get that. 
---
I just don't think bethesda realised how little content there actually is, it looks good, and there is a lot to explore, but in terms of non-repetitive content, there isn;t a whole lot. I've walked out of the vault and done all quests available right the way up to nuking the SBQ, multiple times now. Every time it was the same, the only difference was how my character was built and the weapons they used. But the story, was identical every single time with no real way to vary it (except use the karma syringe on different animals to get different responses from Rose, one interaction with one character where you can effect what she says) 
---
The problem is the game is at a point where it both needs to start gearing towards new content (at least an announcement by now) and also the bugs need to be prioritised. The game is not in an acceptable state for the price I paid for it, in a lot of ways my gaming experience has worsened over time due to the re-occurrence of bugs and introduction of new ones. Seriously the broken stealth right now is a major game-changer, it breaks all of my characters, messes with mutations and armour and messes with my ability to fast travel, most annoyingly out of my own damn camp. 
---
There is too much being broken and not getting addressed or even acknowledged. However, go post a picture of a camp you have built, you can be damn sure "Bethesda Replied" shows up on that.
---
They need to prioritise because if they keep going the same way they have been, this game will dead in the water in a couple of months, and I *really* don't want that.
---
There is so much damn potential here, and even as is, if the bugs were fixed and stability was exponentially improved, the game could be so much better.
---
Instead things get broken, entire character builds get made redundant overnight (bye bye sneak critical vats build, if I can't get hidden most of my perks are useless)
---
Honestly I feel frustrated more than anything, I see a game that I could really love being mostly ignored by the people who can fix it. They just seem to be too focused on bringing in more PvP, fair enough, not for me or for a lot of players if you read this sub, but bloody well fix the game first and introduce something for the majority before catering to the minority.
---
I painted the head of my x-01 with atom paint, so I always know which one it is, excavator and ultracite though, *sigh*
---
True. Can confirm. Had several minor items disappeared. It happens between log off/in times. I log in and notice some weapon or armor is going missing. 
---
Luckly untill now it happened just for some cosmetic and minor weapon but I hope they address it really quick
---
Well technically the Atom store is selling duplicated items.
---
sorry, don't have them. although you can get them from phoenix at watoga for 9800 caps
---
Yeah. Level 2 reduces materials. Level 3 increases durability. 
---
I'm on PlayStation, but if I find a way around it I'll be sure to post it here
---
Honestly though, can't you already cram almost every damage perk there is into a build of your choice with current limits? 
---
I kinda feel like the extra points would mostly go towards convenience and QoL stuff rather than further ramping of damage, though I suppose a glasscannon might get a little less glassy.
---
Another BETA bug that hasn't been addressed, the CM's have sent it across to the dev's though, so they are aware....just busy doing other stuff apparently :(
---
Fact. You would zero, walk out the door on an op, and it would be broken within hours. 
---
Can you blame them? I'm sure their twitter is full of hate and vile from people.  People on the sub reddit gets pissy enough when you question them and I'm just some random person on reddit. If either of them questioned them they would really lose their shit 
---
I think the real issue here is that we are given zero points to allocate at level 1
---
read the post

Todd Howard :
---
"It just works"
---
Dude, that sounds awesome. I hope you are able to finish it someday!
---
You have plans for a bridge? 
---
Luck doesn't affect the rarity of the loot you get, it only affects the durability of said items. So higher luck means they will have higher durability when you find them.
---
Did you submit a bug report to Bethseda?
---
Like one with Instigating and one with Bloodied or something along those lines?
---
Ok thank you, I only have a few people on my friends list that plays it 
---
Items deleting / removing / going missing should never have been allowed to get through Alpha let alone BETA and then onto launch. 
---
You'd have thought they would have fixed that as a priority really :(
---
Have you not had a dog (real dog not those odd yippy rat crossbreeds).    ; )
---
 I've had two that would eat everything except the top of the soda can, one that loved plastic  (ate doggy doors down to the wood), or would actually play catch with heeself throwing fist sized rocks 15 ft in the air...  Had one on high school that freaking loved ceramics, it spent countless hours trying (and failing) to eat a massive power line insulator.
---
The one playing catch with rocks still gets me, a good $200 in dog toys ignored for a chunk of stone... Thank god no busted windows either, thumped a couple though.
---
Gotta love it :)
---
I will never buy another product from this company anymore. Too much is too much. I have never seen that
---
Yeah, I have thrown out thousands of rounds of various ammo types but I've also thrown out tons of lead and gunpowder, too. I'm never really short on ammo. Selling it would be nice.
---
There about 40ish points worth of perks in each individual special. Raising it to 76 wouldn't make that much of an impact.
---
I actually got the code online, it‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt have the end game mission feel, it feels to simular to repairing the power plants. I understand the Queen is seen as the climax but I just found it lacking certainly from a fallout perspective, where‚Äôs the story of the people? Where‚Äôs the immersion? 
---
Wait, you won't drop it just in case, but you will scrap or sell it? I get you actually get something if you sell or scrap it, but either way you won't have them anymore.
---
Not a problem if you 1 hit everything with melee
---
hmm yes its unfortunate it happens with small lists aswell. Hope they find a permanent fix. You can only try to restart game and computer and see if that resets it.
---
\&gt;I don't know why they aren't reaching out to players at high level or with many in game hours to ask what their experiences have been like!
---
Nobody knows for sure, but my guess is that they don't have the capacity. They are fighting fires at the moment and that's their focus. Their challenge will be to ensure that they can get some of that stuff under control *enough* to be able to focus on delivering new features.
---
As it is, and while I understand your sadness about not reaching 1,000 hours, you could perhaps look at this situation in another way: be thankful that you were able to wring 900 hours of enjoyment from this game. That's not only a good stat on its own, but it's a hell of a lot higher than most players could possibly bare. So, look on the bright side. :0)
---
Why the convenience of being able to swap out perk cards is counter balanced by you having to manually do it.  Frankly I barely swap out my perk cards. But I also don't go for min max of anything that I constantly have to switch around. 
---
Personally I don't think combat and non combat perks should be pulled form the same pool. Why not 50 point perks for combat perks and 26 for crafting/utility perks.
---
Why not a champion point system like ESO? Marginal skill increase past the soft max level. 
---
I think there should be a hard max level somewhere though... They could increase it later on.
---
You already can go above the 200-cap-per-faction limit when you sell things back, but only by 25% of your purchase price.   
---
e.g.  you can sell 200 caps of goods, buy something for 100 caps, and then sell another 25 caps of goods. 
---
Is 30 caps and a couple rounds of ammo really considered a high investment cost?
---
I haven‚Äôt checked since a few weeks ago, but they still were then. 
---
Yeah, as someone that works in software development, I had the "confused dog hearing his master's voice in a recording" look when I first read that a weight limit was implemented to help fix that problem.
---
You have to be pretty optimistic to think users won't try to game that.
---
The melee nerf is coming. All them explosive shotgun users will cry till they get it. 
---
So would you say mass and hrf is worth holding onto for now?
---
Plus side is moving camp it's all shifted to stored tab at 100% HP.  At this point it's just an excuse to fiddle with layout.  
---
I‚Äôve come across this several times. 
---
Same with superduper and rad sponge. They get really annoying 
---
Melons. Why drink and eat when you could do both at once?
---
*Managing hunger/thirst is my least favorite part of this game. And I'm not against survival mechanics. I love Don't Stave! In FO76 it's tedious as opposed to compelling.*
---
Ok I‚Äôll be on tonight or early mornings
---
That's not at all how it works:
---
* Bulk originally wasn't scrapped at workstations with the scrap all command, but could be used for crafting. This was ideal
---
* Patch changed it so that bulk couldn't be used for crafting either. This defeats the purpose for those bulking to save stash space.
---
* Now, while bulk can be used for crafting again, scrap all also scraps it unnecessarily.
---
Or, more simply: there is a difference between scrap all and scrapping for crafting that you need to learn.
---
The only place you'll be able to get mods for it is in the MODUS armory terminal, under mods. Even then, it rarely spawns. Get ready for several hours to several days of server hopping. 
---
Yea that had me confused to bc it doesnt really make sense but im pretty sure all ss are with the regular head unlike the All Rise. Hence why its unique. No ss ive come across has a heavy hammerhead or something like that only a possible heating coil
---
Good tip is to not dig into your resources when building on a workshop.  Just use the workshops and you dont loss anything really 
---
That‚Äôs a comment you left ME several days ago moron lol. Buddy we were talking about how I ‚Äúspew‚Äù a lot of shit. My reply was to show you it‚Äôs exactly you, not me, that talks a lot of shit lol. I merely commented on your silly shit.
---
https://ibb.co/P1MVhdb
---
You can‚Äôt even defend the nonsensical things you said because it‚Äôs all shit you spewed yourself lol. You are the gift that keeps delivering low IQ lol.
---
Game stop is giving this game away in Germany if you buy a used controller... Honestly, Bethesda needs to write this game off and start on another fallout... 60x heavier lockpicks, patches that disabled nukes, reusing skyrim assets The list goes on and on...
---
"It just works" 
---
-Todd Howard 
---
Feel fleeced yet? This game has me not wanting shitfield and elder scrotes
---
Plus the cost of building defenses, resource collectors, and powering it up (think power plant repair event). I spent about an hour building up a workshop just to disconnect 5 minutes later.
---
On the other hand, if you can already do a full damage build with existing limits, all you're gonna do by adding more special points is allow some QoL and some minor tankiness. 
---
I played division a lot, may go back.  I am a solo player, so i liked how the dungeond worked. Yeah, not as slick as a coordinated effort but still had a blast.  Div 2 looking to be solo friendly?
---
Think about how badly this could go if other players could build permanent structures. One troll could literally end this game.
---
We already have people building storage boxes over workshops
---
My issue wasn‚Äôt the cap. But not knowing there was a cap. 15 felt like such a random arbitrary number to stop at. I‚Äôm more of a causal player and didn‚Äôt read before spec‚Äôing. So I always thought I could just keep taking perks and be forced to customise my build afterwards 
---
https://pics.me.me/heres-a-solution-im-mad-i-dont-want-a-solution-33299816.png
---
Exactly. It would be better to take perks like lockpicking, hacking, and crafting perks and make them 0 cost.
---
Crafting perks that currently provide a combat advantage, which I think is mostly weapon durability, could be separated into separate perks if there's concern over balancing but I don't really see how it would be much of a problem.
---
That would reduce the swapping problem without affecting balance at all.
---
Dont most of the normal sledgehammer mods basically make is a super tho. Add a rocket and it's the same thing lol
---
I know, but losing your progress when you disconnect is frustrating.
---
So if I mod the legendary, like my chest piece I made pocketed, it doesn‚Äôt affect it?  If that‚Äôs the case, Good to know so I can move those points somewhere else.
---
The only two quest reward items you need to leave for max level are All Rise, as it's a pretty good weapon, and Last Stand, as it's the only piece of legendary Scout Armor in the game.
---
Yeah I just cut off the PlayStation. I'll give it a rest for tonight. But overall I'm happy that's the only bug that's effected me hard in the last month and a half of playing
---
I meant more enemy linked ones like Exterminator or Ghoul slayer. 
---
Am I missing something? It says "finally", but the date stamp from the dude telling Beth he was wrongfully banned and Beth's response is like...an hour?
---
Dulfy made a list here: http://dulfy.net/2018/11/23/fallout-76-apparel-and-outfits-guide/
---
It's not 100% complete and I don't think it has been update since it was released but it's a start.
---
I agree. I think there should be a 5 min timer that let's you reconnect to the server you DCed from and keep the workshop. If you dont get in in that time then it becomes unowned
---
3 of us 
---
\*facepalm\* I just got it. This joke would be easier if this were Fallout: New York, huh?
---
If on ps4 just closing and reopening might work. Restart is the last option. :)
---
Ohh I see, thanks
---
That's fine. Back in the previous games you could get yourself an average of 7 or 8 when the cap was 10...hell, if you got that one perk and then the bobbleheads, you could get a full 10 across the board in fallout 3. An average of 11 out of 15 is still worse than 8 out of 10
---
Unfortunately it does not work. Was the first thing I tested when I got my first plasma flamer
---
Nope.. Only applies to armor you crafted. Legendary armor cannot be crafted. The perk is useless. Dont see any way of it being helpful.
---
It was fun the first time for me. I didn't feel like doing it a second time though.
---
Speak for ur self. Im still loving the game and i would consider myself a casual
---
This is how you break melee even more, it would be damn near uncontestable in terms of raw damage output.
---
Mate got to agree to this :/
---
All Rise was the one I was thinking of, but forgot about Last Stand until right when I got it as a reward. Then I just alt-f4'd and went to go punch something other than my computer.

This shits been going on for a week now. It‚Äôs been entertaining as hell to watch. He posts updates from time to time. I think he‚Äôs been banned from like all the gaming subs for spamming.

Lol the server disconnects make this clip 10x better
---
Thanks a lot lol, I'll remember that next time
---
Lol.
---
You don't have to pick them up either. I get you also get ammo for completing quests and events, but seriously why keep them if you aren't using them?
---
Gz, on finding all the colours.  
---
Myself and many others have been hunting the red variant for quite some time now, it seems to be rarer than the rest. If you remember any extra information on where you found the Red variant specifically inside Fort Defiance, and how many jumps you did etc, that might be incredibly useful info.  
---
Thanks. o/  
---
u/landfleem
---
It is common. I've explained it like 35 times in this thread lol.
---
Add lucky hole mine and West Tec/Huntersville  to your morning run. Add scavenger on after u kill/loot Huntersville West Tec. Get any where for 500 to 700 steel. With excavator power armor, got to lucky hole mine and collect lead ore. Smelt it down and make 600 rounds of ammo. Add super dupper and ammo smith for good measure. 
---
Its annoying when we get hit but atleast for me most of the bugs I‚Äôve gotten have gotten patched or fixed.
---
I am on now
---
Ahh, so I'm definitely missing a large chunk of the story. Sounds pretty ridiculous and hilarious!
---
They need to allow respec at every level past 50.  This move a point or pick a card nonsense is counterproductive to enjoying the game.   There is no reason to be stopped from trying a new build once you hit max level.  Trying new builds helps with keeping you playing past the mediocre end game. It's supposed to be fun.
---
Improvise,Adapt and Overcome.
---
I don't see it very often. Maybe I need to stop by more.
---
If ammo condition and gun condition were a thing,  yes
---
Don't worry, I did the same thing. Keep an eye on the MODUS production terminal; some people vendor it as soon as they get it. That's how I upgraded to a lvl 50 Last Stand.
---
Completing this quest several times should give you a holotape that allows you to toggle a non-quest version of the vox syringer effect at will, so all applicable animals will speak instead of the usual animal grunts.
---
I've wanted a refund since about two hours into this game.
---
I found my way into any camps i discovered so far so i reallly dont mind. I especially love the idiots who close their camps off and put workbenches near windows or have open balconies. You must be very smart. 
---
I know a good many new players that have no problems at all the tse nerf made them no longer a must have weapon and as for the duped armor there are ways to beat it. It's an arms race we just have to use what we have available.
---
That's even better. I don't like farming the white spring! Good tip.
---
Do you still have the level 50 version? Can you tell me the stats? I'm curious how much of a difference it is.
---
Chad sells both at Camden park.
---
Stopped playing after the second patch. There‚Äôs no reason to play while each update breaks more than it fixes.
---
I‚Äôll come back to play the game over again in a year or so when stuff is actually fixed.
---
If caps and items can be mailed between characters, that would be a way to subvert the 200 per vendor per day limitation.
---
Shared account stash/caps would kind of work... There are times you come across an item too good to vendor. 
---
I had a level 35 war drum 90% weight reduction so 2 pounds, ignore 50% armor, reflect damage while blocking. Handed it to a low level 5-10 range player since all the lvl 30+ peeps ran away
---
See I'm confused, some times my turrets will fire at things really far away and sometimes they won't even look at the dog attacking them. I have no spot lights, will have to try tonight.
---
Eh, I'm casual, and I still enjoy it.
---
I lock my doors now too. I was sick of getting shot in the back while crafting.  I like my little hole jn the ground, sorry, warp back to our own camp if you need something.  
---
Some people on here can't handle facts. :) 
---
No wonder why gamestop is giving this game away for free with a used controller purchase
---
Basically yes, but I think its still the sledgehammers base damage so Im not sure if the damage then surpasses the ss. Btw be carefull trying to trade those items. I thought the same I got a lot of shit for advertising a sledgehammer I modded with a rocket mod. 
---
And after half a decade of trying, this is STILL all that "survival mechanics" amount to. Rather pathetic
---
Its:
---
Require food and water to survive. But make sure its sufficiently common that it doesnt actually prevent playing the game. Which makes it so common theres never any risk of being without.
---
Which makes the ENTIRE MECHANIC completely fucking POINTLESS.
---
New Vegad did this with survival mode. No Mans Sky did it with the idiot mechanic that is launch fuel. It's just a pointless collectathon. Game play wise, that's literally all it amounts to. 
---
Yes i try to dump known plans and ammo I do not use. Sometimes I'll throw in some stims and a legendary weapon or armour aswell if I'm trying to clear some space.
---
Don't know, I'm the only one in my group still playing lol
---
I think yes and no. Not to the extent of how it used to be, but for sure make it stronger. That‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm holding onto mine, just in case.
---
Cry baby
---
As it stands, I can get 14~15 in my main damage stat, 15 int for crafting, and then I still have 20 points to spread around for utility. The amount of HP you get from End is small, the only reason you would build it above 4 is for armor perks. Charisma needs no more than 7 points to always have its best perks for the situation equiped, and can live on 4 points, Agi can be 15 if stealth/pistols, if not, 8 is enough for Adrenaline and a 3 star utility like sneak damage or Action Boy/girl. 5 points in luck and I have startched genes, and a 3 star rifle/heavy weapons perk. This all fits neatly in the budget with misc Pa perks and what not. I switch perk cards a lot during play as well to change strategies and get more utility. 
---
The amount of specials is almost perfect. Lenient enough for cross specialization, closed enough so you don't have people having their cake and eating it too. Honestly if you cannot work within these boundaries, I don't know what to tell you, either you are utterly scatterbrained, or very bad at RPGs
---
Why did you get shit for it? 
---
Just got my instigating 50. Cal sniper back in 4 with a new stealth build. This gun damn near breaks the game.
---
I agree, Why do people pick up the ammo knowing they can't sell or scrap it. Yet the OP doesn't want to drop it in case they might need it, but will scrap or sell them? That doesn't make any sense to because either way you won't have it for the "just in case" situation. I understand Events and Quests give you ammo but just drop the ones you don't use.
---
I'm definitely running up against it. But it's also looking for ways to avoid high-budget items. Turrets are the big one, but there are smaller things that you can reduce. For instance, concrete foundations cost more than wooded ones. There are also things like using the picnic table in the mess hall instead of individual table and chairs. I also, have the Carnivore mutation which means I don't have to waste any budget on crops.
---
Wait, colored uniforms exist? I only found the white and dirty weathered...damn. I have all the hats though, I guess that's cool...I was wondering why the hat color names didn't match their actual colors
---
I still don't have mine! and this is my Ticked as of today...

Wow, here comes some salt for you.
---
&gt;Destroys entire base reducing their gameplay to scrounging for resources to build.
---
Calls it beneficial for reasons that don't matter.
---
Says so because of the contents of their stash.
---
Calls it a *favor*.
---
Please explain your logic in a way that normal people would understand.  Maybe you'll let us come and blow up your camp and we'll call it returning the favor so you can drop everything you're doing to have to go do something else you don't even want to do because apparently that's how this game is supposed to be played, doing shit you don't want to fucking do because you just want to play the game like every other Fallout but can't because xyz decided abc and now you're fucking stuck playing for shit you thought you already took care of because time isn't important or matters at all apparently.
---
Seriously just what the fuck happened to people in *our* world??  Who fucking says someone destroying ALL OF YOUR BASE did you a favor?  Just holy fucking Christ what is this, Spirituality?
---
Or are you just trying to be positive?
---
Whatever happened to enjoying a video game, instead of playing it like it's a damn other job??  Or not having your experience ruined by others under **Any** excuse?
---
Somethings damn wrong here.  It's disturbing how complacent people are with shitty behavior.
---
You‚Äôll toss it away in time - it‚Äôs just more dead weight in your stash.
---
I don't need to "defend" anything to you lol. I stand by what I said. You're trying way too hard.
---
I disagree on the screaming for more content part after only 2,5 months. The game came out not only with a gazillion of faults but also with a missing endgame.
---
All the +100 players here know that and they put up with it. Hoping it would change. Well it changed but for the worse.
---
It‚Äôs clear that we don‚Äôt represent the average player. Because the average player will have quit a loooong time ago. Not even seeing the SBQ for a single time. And also not pouring more money into the atom shop. So focusing on this group is a bad bad move. Which probably did cost the company a truck load of money.
---
If it would have been clear to me that the game would not be build up as promised but crushed with every update more and more well I wouldn‚Äôt even have started playing it. I guess I was hoping it would change and I somehow hoped Bethesda would be engaged in what the community has to say. But they are not.
---
I think the meltdown is happening because they want to turn it into a f2p alternative. Kicking out the caring players out first. So the wave will stay small. No shitstorm because the ones caring are long gone.
---
Especially if he was telling the truth. That‚Äôd be fucked up. That‚Äôs what caught my attention. 
---
The other day a friend of mine gave me 54 ivory grip plans (???) ... along with others (40+ lbs worth of plans altogether)
---
More people read this sub for entertainment than actually play the game. The game has been dead bud
---
or if you're melee but can spare the 2 points it's good to just stockpile. 
---
It's almost like people have different play styles.
---
I did and I didn‚Äôt even break the code of conduct 
---
I would be happy if they just made it so two shot weapons didn't have awful vats accuracy even when it says 95%
---
Aw bummer. So is it 2 or 3 hours now? Pretty silly little event thing if you ask me. It takes about 30 seconds to rest,  and you only needed to do it once an hour or 2...
---
Those 600 Atom sunglasses look awesome though. /
---
Combined with mobs regaining hp again i‚Äôm getting the feeling they the ‚Äòbuild merges‚Äô are more extensive then imagined. 
---
For instance camps that cant be placed while no other camp occupying the spot.
---
The whole idea that we are back to square one is just mindboggling.
---
Are you seriously so dense you can't see I'm pointing out a major flaw before it's released? Obviously you see the potential to be exploited read the end of the post I ask Bethesda not to fix this in the most sarcastic manor possible
---
It's so funny how this subreddit works - I read your comment here, chuckled a bit, and expected it to be at like, -5 downvotes. Usually, this r/ gets pissed and downvotes whenever anyone is overtly negative - especially in a positive and upbeat thread such as this one. Only then do I realize you've got 19 thumbs up! Life is a weird place!
---
But, also, you nailed it. xD
---
Bc it was a regular sledge i modded with searing heavy sharp rocket. Wich in my opinion makes it a ss. Name doesnt change and some people got mad over it. Nothing big put just trying to save you some frustration.
---
I would actually be in support of this, I see no reason really not to. Access has always been a standard think to take in all games, its a no brainer. The constriction of the point allocation should just be combat related
---
500 atoms is such an insult. 
---
Oh, I don't mean to give any impression that I didn't get money's worth from it at all. Just feels like a bit of a sad end so far. Like I say, I shall return! 
---
They are right where they belong. In the trash
---
I got one of a glowing wendigo at the bos camp at that mansion near watoga 
---
It costs more to claim when someone else has built a bunch of stuff.  I usually claim one first thing when I login so I have actually switched servers to avoid paying 100 caps to claim a bunch of turrets and workbenches I don't need.  I'm not saying don't do it, just that it's probably not working how you think it is.
---
 I think when they toned down the surrogate penis that was tse, it highlighted the gross imbalance between melee and ranged.  What I'm hoping is that they'll buff ranged all around and not nerf melee.  We'll see I guess. 
---
Same, it's just a design philosophy thing at this point.
---
Guess what, I signed up for a Fallout game, last I checked, I DON'T need to deal with this in any other Fallout game.
---
Guess you just enjoy seeing people be hurt.
---
Found a goul slayers gamma gun, I‚Äôm I just a joke to you Bethesda 
---
Karma means nothing. People are fickle. The same people upvoting this grab their pitchforks over the "Im done posts." 
---
And yeah. Im pretty sure at this point they have no damn clue.
---
Oh lol I'm well aware of the difference.  They have different handles.  All I'm saying is realistically (I know this is a video game) that a supersledge is a sledgehammer with a rocket so a sledgehammer with a rocket would be a supersledge.  Lol
---
Perfectly fair, but load times may vary depending on PC strength. Some load times may exceed 5 minutes.
---
It would be better if there were more traditional RPG elements - for example having enemies with super high energy resistance and low physical resistance - so that you actually had to learn how to kill them. 
---
In fairness, OPs version did look more like Fallout 76.
---
Wow.
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I mean
---
Not back to 100% but maybe to like 60-65 ish
---
Why didn‚Äôt you just leave through the secondary exit in the control room?
---
No need for personal attacks smart ass. I bought this game just as you. It isn't yours or mine to ruin or save. It's my opinion.
---
RadShield from the mire questline also doesn't suppress mutations and stacks with diluted rad-x, but it's a bit annoying finding the ingredients for it(whatever it's called grows along the main river apparently, though I've never see them).
---
I‚Äôm the soup guy in my party.  My camp is on a lake, and I have a nice heavily-walled garden of six tato, six mutfruit, and a dozen corn.  After a couple hours adventuring, when I go back to camp to repair and rearm, I go in with green thumb and collect everything, grab a bunch of dirty water, empty the purifiers, and then with super duper make all the adhesive I and my party will ever need and then so much corn soup that I keep three adventurers topped off all the time. I also drop it to create bags, give soup to low levels, and I STILL end up with it going bad in my inventory.  
---
So I don‚Äôt know what y‚Äôall are doing, but I have so much corn soup I never even consider picking up other food, and I‚Äôm never not well-fed and -hydrated. 
---
I still cook anything I happen to grab (glowing meat, especially), but that‚Äôs just for selling. 
---
Thank you man. :) 
---
Suprobo3
---
Bug? Maybe? 
---
Each time I exit to main menu (usually when I get disconnected or switch characters), then log back into a world, my Favorites wheel is out of sync. Some weapons in my inventory say they are favorite (with the heart) but don't show in the favorite wheel. I have been needing to reformat the wheel every login. Additionally, even some of the items that are favorites that are still in the wheel are in completely different slots. As if a garden gnome rearranged my favorites wheel while I was loading in. I should have gnome they'd be up to something! 
---
Thanks. 
---
:( 
---
Can‚Äôt win them all...
---
They're unkillable because of you. Aren't there Cha perks though that handle rads and diseases? If you're in a good size group and you are sharing max rank rad sponge can't you run around nuke zones in a dress just fine?
---
You don‚Äôt have anything to defend lol. So deluded you are man, you got all those downvotes for a reason. So if we were talk about cars not video games you basically said your car is the best because it has wheels, windows, seating, brakes and an engine so your car is the best lol. Don‚Äôt ever become a lawyer lol. I‚Äôm tearing up here with the laughter lol. 
---
You know people are quick to tell sarcasm but if you counter that with sarcasm yourself mostly people dont understand it. Love to do that and see who falls for it.
---
Shouldve made my sarcasm a bit more obvious thats true.
---
Its Bethesda we are taking about so they might go with it. I hope not. 
---
I didn't really think this was that big of a deal until I got an instigating mole miner gauntlet.  I have low strength and no points in melee but I can one shot everything in Whitesprings now while my fully modded two shot rifles with all the perks, takes four to six shots and allows me to be swarmed.
---
Which is fucking insane. I can eat damage from everyone in this game, even Mirelurk queen acid, i can survive. Mobs of Glowing ones? Tough but i got it
---
Waves of gutsies? Might as well not bother sometimes.
---
Although i have a 3* Troubleshooters boxing glove with all my perks mutations an such im doing 500 damage plus the robot damage so i dont fear them as much. But they still make me pause
---
Imma go kill myself where was it? Please tell me I feal dumb
---
That's a nice little ziggurat. Now you just need some victims to sacrifice!
---
Well when you only have like 70 caps, it is. Jeez.
---
Well I know for me on ps4 it shows me as online as soon as I hit play despite me having a few min of loading. Not sure if that would count tho if they implemented a timer
---
I‚Äôd say even that might be too much. I was think around 45-50% of its original.
---
yeah. That‚Äôs so basic. Every mmo company knows that. Well nearly every company. Apart of Bethesda. I don‚Äôt know if they are slow learners but they sure take their time. 
---
Did they thanos snap your duped weapon?  https://youtu.be/3GwjfUFyY6M
---
Oh boi so then you not only have to constantly repair your weapons but watch out for bad ammo
---
That's fair.  I know I've been conditioned to grab a microscope whenever I see it by the other FO games.
---
That sucks that that was your first experience. It takes some resource management and planning, but not too much.
---
Drop weight until not overencumbered, die, respawn at your base. Something along those lines would have been my course of action.
---
Why do you need a fusion generator? Thunder Mountain just generates them. Not in any kind of hurry, mind. Does a generator make it quicker
---
They plan to nerf the more and make super mutants stronger.
---
Speaking of professionals, is this game still at a 49-51% metacritic rating for professional (not user) reviews? Isn't that like the biggest flop of all time for a AAA game? I think it's certainly in the top 3. By all time, I mean all time in Earth's history.
---
Xbox, sorry.
---
I've just squatted on Posiden for a few times, I can take the plant in about 25 mins. I've got about 75 cores and the perk card to extend them. No worries, mate.
---
Tons of people use the Broadsider, I don't know what you're talking about
---
Yea anywhere from 45 to 55 depending on if they make explosive perk cards still affect tse
---
...no, you signed up for massively multiplayer Fallout-themed game as a service. White-knighting that loathsome, abhorrent concept is what this sub was founded for and continues to defend until this day.
---
You wanted multiplayer Fallout, here are the other players. I hope you enjoy them!
---
Dam
---
They are fine, but over done in FO76. Eat/drinking/repairing multiple times in 10-30 minutes = GTFO.
---
Your fault for even caring about PvP - it will always be broken because even with a total reset some people will still buy their way to the best pieces of gear.  Just give up - unless you want to put in P2W dollars.
---
I'm 105, and not sure I'm done with my combat load out yet because of swapping around points after nerfs, and theres still quality of life and crafting perks I don't have. 
---
That sucks however this is a survival game to some extent.  Always make sure you have food and water on you. I have speed demon so I have to have a metric shitton of the stuff on me to not die of thirst and starvation 
---
or how about that... A marketplace that's IN YOUR PIPBOY! You just browse what you need and buy it and BOOM, it's now in your pipboy baby! (seriously... this game has way to many menus that just don't even realize that there's a perfectly good pipboy right there that could be used for menus...)
---
the code is so easy, type nukacrypt.com, tap on the link that takes you to the codes, type it in the keypad. this process takes like 30 seconds, you‚Äôre upset that you have to tap your controller a few more times ? not the stronger enemies or having to decrypt the code itself ? 
---
They tried to keep you out and almost  succeeded. I applaud them!  
---
That is what this game is all about.
---
The game is broken enough already, overpowered builds were possible at 50 then nerfed into the ground.
---
Adding more points will just give people the ability to create more overpowered builds rather than focus on a jack of all trades and this game will (believe it or not) be worse than it is now.
---
I like how you people are screwing up reality so much that you're trying to pretend that griefing isn't as fundamental to online gaming as online functionality itself. What is wrong with your brains?
---
That is the reward for the unreleased election day event which was already data mined. 
---

Gotcha I've been getting a lot of hate in the comments. Which when you think about it is a good thing.
---
What gets me more then anything is the disease proc chances. Get rad worms.   Cure rad worms.   Get rad worms 5 sec later... .by now I am more worm then man....I am...worman
---
I understand your frustration but how may I ask do you know the level 147 had all mutations and was a duper I'm just growing tired of seeing that kinda blame and crap posted.
---
Except you, apparently
---
Posted on what was known as "gaming circle jerk" sounds legit.
---
Yup, shows you how stupid these mechanics will be. 
---
Not being mean or anything, you almost sound like a nuka cola ad. You should added "That's why I drink Nuka Cola Cherry. It gives me the energy I need to move fast and live happy. Nuka Cherry: It's in the bottle!"
---
They aren't showing up because the game bombed, substantially. Not because the mean tweets. 
---
I have to eat and drink maybe every 30 minutes, I dunno if you guys are bugged or what.
---
Exactly, let us kick these people from servers, being wanted is part of the game, grieving is an unintended part and we were even given mechanics and ways to deal with grieving, well give us the ultimate tool, if someone starts attacking me against my will, let me immediately block them from any and all interaction with me, make me invisible, my camp invincible against them in all ways, and let me be able to 'kick' them from my camp zone so that I can force them into a loading screen if they even dare step foot near my base, continually.
---
You wanna grief in a game designed to stop griefing?  No.
---
Photoshop can do anything these days. I could shop my own bethesda letter if you'd like
---
Disagree.
---
yeah i don't want a name floating over characters
---
So how do you know the level 147 was a duper with all the mutations if you were stuck in a silo?  You know not every high level player is a duper. 
---
I can't remember which power plant we were at but a player meticulously sealed up every door and was working on thr front garage doors with stash boxes just like this. I thought it was hilarious and kept jumping in and out showing where hair gaps were. We eventually sealed it up completely, he gave me a bag of goodies and I went on my way
---
Lol I was thinking of only using nuka cola for hydration but decided not to 
---
I don‚Äôt think they will. Since Bethesda‚Äôs approach is to nerf without attacking the real problem.
---
Terribly unbalanced enemies. No viable endgame weapons. Overpowered Melees etc 
---
They will probably continue to nerf everything to the ground. Why? Because there is no endgame content. By this they prolong the grind so players take longer until they reach that conclusion.
---
At a camp near Charleston?
---
No worries. It‚Äôs a new fix ;)
---
You uhhh.... you play a lot of Call of Duty dontcha?
---
yes unstable isotopes and erectily charged but only when you get attacked with melee and not enough to kill a lvl 50 protectron
---
Well that‚Äôs stupid lol
---
When I trudged to the nuke zone finally because he had exactly 16 of all mutations and almost a TSE for every ammo type. Im not one of two year olds who complain about anyone that kills them with one. He didn't have armor at all and you can guess what he was using instead. I always trade with people to see what they are carrying, and it explained why he wiped everything so good. If he got it all naturally he should be lvl 200+
---
Like you can't read or what?
---
no shit. Really? Wow! Didn‚Äôt see that one coming.
---
Dude that‚Äôs the reason nobody cares about the SBQ anymore 
---
I need a Nuka Cola...
---
DRINK. SOME. WA. TER..
---
There are exit signs that guide you to the exit. Also, in the robot respawn terminal room there is a fridge of food/water and 2 medical bags next to the fridge.
---
.../s
---
Sheesh, weird to think your the one complaining about how toxic this Reddit is
---
Fuck that. If they take everything I earned legitimately ill never play again.
---
Col. Gusty has something to say to your commie ass
---
Lol Epic is far worse they screwed over all the save the world fans for Battle Royal yeah good comparison üòÇ 
---
It has to be natural charisma, no armor or chem modifier. So if you have a natural 6 charisma then I have no idea other than disease or mutations.
---
I got out. Check my responce to the other dudes  comment, he was a duper. 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_mutations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations)
---
There you go buddy. Do the math.
---
I reported something by uploading to YouTube and sending them the link.
---
Ooh get you, Mr Raider, with your washing and eating! 
---
Man, that typo...
---
Never said 76 was "the best", you're just making up shit and being loud. That's apparently all you need to do to get upvotes on this sub. 
---
76's level and world design is beautifully crafted, I don't care how many bug reports you list or how much shit talking you do. I know you don't care about the details I tried listing, but I do. The game is fun as hell imo, and fuckin works. Doesn't work all of the time, but works way more than enough for me. 
---
Not sure who made it, but I think this one's pretty complete: https://www.imgur.com/a/79uAEOc
---
If you won't link us the picture, at least link us the thread you are talking about. "that thread" isn't a very helpful searchword to find it, lol.
---
shitposts drawn by hand will always get a thumbs up
---
Im pointing my fat man at my feet now. Please tell my story to the next generations of nukers.
---
You just come up on me to say I'm wrong because you feel like saying I'm wrong.
---
Replace a normal gun with a water gun. That‚Äôs what happened. And now people are complaining. Funnily the ones who cheered at the nerf first.
---
Reactive Plates.  Watched 3 players kill themselves off my PA yesterday trying to grief me with glass cannon melee builds.  Pure comedy.
---
Which is my latest Bethesda logic complaint.  I shouldn‚Äôt get a bounty when some idiot decides to run up and take a swing at me.
---
No, I'm stating a fact...
---
Two things:
---
* I want to be able to hotkey my chassis. Fuck opening you pipboy, scrolling through your gear, selecting your frame, and all that nonsense when there's Scorched breaking down the door. Let us hotkey that shit.  
---
* I like the idea of chassis autorenaming when a matching set is slotted in: Power Armor Chassis (T-45), Power Armor Chassis (Excavator), etc. Still not ideal for people who have multiple sets of the same type of armor, but definitely an improvement.
---
Link?
---
Im sure it will happen. Nothing goes by the anti fun police of Bethesda :)
---
Thar explanation still isn't viable at all to be fair I'm lvl 120 with everything you just listed and more does that make me a duper? Also don't see what mutations has to do with it they are beyond easy to obatain all 16 of them...
---
How could you see his mutations?
---
Put up a post and ask
---
Seriously, right now don‚Äôt cure radworms.  Its buffing your buffs.
---
Ultracite need the Black Bird paint job.
---
Dont think I could find enough nuka to keep up with my speed demon mutation 
---
I have 3 characters above 50 with different builds and I usually spend time farming mats to build camps and experimenting with different camp builds. I'll build two i'm happy with, then experiment with the third until I'm happy with that, then i scrap one of the old ones etc etc. They're getting better and better every time.
---
I was at 1508 dmg for a gauss. Now it‚Äôs sitting at 400 something. Well it was time to pack the bags anyway and move on
---
Yeah I figured that out recently.  Tho I usually dont cure it regardless 
---
He had 16 of each mutation in his inventory. How do you have everything I listed? A tse for all ammo types? If you do have them honestly I wanna know how I will become a student
---
noice!
---
Blast berries are crimson at prime. They're not easy to spot, but they're freaking everywhere.
---
That‚Äôs what they told m to do as well. Kinda aggravated they need to freeload off a 3rd party to handle reporting by video. They run a game studio but their email is overloaded by a 20mb attachment?  WTF. 
---
Yeah I've tried bringing this up a couple of times no one wants to listen they'd rather bitch about bugs and disconnects. It's turning into an echo chamber in here
---
This is literally a Broadsider feedback post, and it's crickets.
---
The wiki entries on all the wikis for this weapon are incorrect and virtually blank
---
Try to Google anything about the Broadsider in Fallout 76, the only results you will find are for Fallout 4.
---
Pull your trigger more than 1 time, kill things, post less about not being about to use your nerfed duped shotgun
---
Just because they are a carrier for a disease doesnt mean they are effected by said disease 
---
I think Bethesda wants to kill its own player base. Probably to switch it to f2p without the too many ppl complaining...
---
With just the ones that affect Special
---
-11 Strength
---
+4 Perception
---
-3 Endurance
---
0 Charisma
---
+2 Inteligence
---
0 Agility
---
0 Luck
---
Trading + most of them are obvious just from sight or the VATS perk
---
If only the factory could produce it for us
---
I thought it was pretty fun 
---
There were soooooooo many of them 
---
I‚Äôve only got 3 power armors, one with atom shop paint, and it‚Äôs still annoying just dealing with the other two.
---
I need to know what armor I‚Äôm grabbing when I‚Äôm farming with Excavator vs showing off with Nuka T-51. At least my X-01 is Atom shopped so I can switch to it quick for Queen runs
---
I did the calibrated shocks on my excavator I have this glitch and will keep taking advantage of it, I've  had caps disappear, Ive had weapons disappear, Ive had junk vanish, Ive lost a lot of time wasted and caps spent taking over workshops only to be disconnected, finally a glitch that works for me? Ill keep it! 
---
Sometimes my carry weight is 350 sometimes 345 sometimes 430 sometimes 450, sometimes it changes every time I look. Here and there its stable at 450 on login until I exit my PA. It does not matter if I have more or less weight then I can carry. out of my PA my cw is 280 lbs, so it should be 380 lbs in my PA, but its been as low as 320. If I log in and its what it should be or higher its a good day to play, if its less Ill exit game and try loading back, until it is, otherwise im starting to ask myself why im still playing. I usually play with a group, often 12 of us in chat most of us battling the weight issue daily if not hourly.
---
fallout 76 = hording game where you cant horde, what a great idea, knot!, or hey this fallout 76 is really good inventory control game. 
---
"Dont save steel and aluminum, if you do, you'll need adhesive and black titanium, or if your really lucky some  cobalt flux, its cool though there's a never ending supply of yellow flux which will over encumber you in no time if you bother to pick it up. And if you have the adhesive, guess what, you'll need some aluminum  but nope cant hold onto it because its all too heavy and that unlimited stash size that was promised before release is never gonna happen"
---
I said I drop them lol, it just accumulated from rewards 
---
Well nobody wanted nerfout 76 and yet here we are.
---
Jesus christ, you dont find who uses weapons off of the wiki. Do some fucking asking, take the data before you post 
---
What would be more awesome is if we didnt have to resort to long and tedious placement tricks in order to achieve the desired result. 
---
More like buff the perk cards. The numbers are shit. 
---
Would be an interesting workshop idea
---
I was going to post something similar to this xD no way in hell is fo76 an mmo. 
---
It JUST works 
---
So basically you poorly managed your character?
---
&gt; What was I supposed to do? 
---
Plan and manage your character better next time...?
---
very nice..i need to add super duper..i have green thumb but super duper is an extra bonus..i rarely use stims..EVER..because when i gather the ingredients for soup i also craft healing salves (around overseer camp)..i love crafting food and drink because they provide extra bonus for 30 mins (INT, PER, END etc)
---
What kind of made-up bullshit is this? How do you know they had "exactly 16" mutations? FYI there are 19 mutations, and you can have 18 at any one time.
---
TSE isn't even that strong anymore, haven't you seen all those people crying?
---
How do you know what level he "should" be. There is no drop rate for anything you think he had.
---
I felt for you with the health damage from hunger and over encumbered issues, but this is plan ridiculous
---
At the current state of the game, ur screwed playing a Rifle Build. I used to run one too and it's no fun at all.  Since u are able to do a decent amoumnt of damage in regular, things come to the worst in Nuke Zones. Every glowing one needs 5 to six hesdshots to get down and u can completely forget about stealth there.
---
Maybe with stealth modded PA but don't count on it.
---
I can forget about Loot in Nuke Zones too btw.
---
It takes forever to load and corpses decay within that time 
---
sure. Tell that to the players leaving because their dmg output dropped by 80% 
---
Which makes you an excellent one to comment on game balance :D
---
I'll not click and pretend its Calvin pissing on todd howards head :)
---
It‚Äôd need to be cheap though, or bundle it for a cheap box of ammo, otherwise there‚Äôs a broken economy.
---
Take the data? What the fuck are you talking about.
---
You claimed tons of people use it. You say it is a fact, and you want me to perform a survey?
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
Lol. Im not sure what they even tried to fix with radworms, was it not actually increasing your rad damage received? I damn sure didnt have any trouble contracting it - I stopped even trying to cure it long ago, because id get it again the very next hit the disease resist wore off from antibiotics
---
But it isn't an unmitigated disaster. 
---
I think they should give us water guns instead. Would feel more powerful that way.
---
Lol im hopin they turn the plant into a workshop at some point 
---
I've been mulling over this one ever since people first started talking about it during BETA. Honestly, I prefer it the way it is. There are issues that could arise with just showing character name:
---
* Unless Bethesda planned on limiting it so there could only be one "Sally", one "James" etc (which would be BAD), then we face the possibility of the confusion of multiple Jims and Bobs in the same server. That will get confusing fast. It will also cause other issues, which I will touch on.
---
* **It's a lot easier to find people using screennames.** Say you want to play with someone new, and you add them to your friends list on your platform. You now have to figure out who the heck they are in the game. It's so much easier to be able to look at your platform friends list, look at your FO76 social tab, and then look at the names above people's heads and be able to identify them.
---
* **People don't always stick with the same identity/character.** I know my character is no longer who I named them when I left the vault, and I wouldn't want that name to be the one that appeared in-world, because that's not the character I roleplay as anymore. And sometimes, I change things up and switch up my look/costume and am someone else for a day. So if we're stuck with a name, that's kind of limiting. Would we be able to change our name whenever, like our look? But that leads us right back to things being confusing as far as identifying friends.
---
* **If people can change their names whenever they want, griefing can occur.** Say someone causes trouble for someone as "Fred" then changes their name. But there is another Fred on the server who is minding their business, unaware of the fact that someone who isn't paying attention to the fact that this isn't the same person (just set on revenge) is now coming after him, thinking it's the same person. That's going to be an issue that some rotten people will surely exploit.
---
Honestly, I personally feel like things are fine the way they are, though I know that's just my own opinion and others don't feel the same way. (Just offering my own thoughts on how a compromise might be made...) The only way I can see this working is if maybe a small line of test under the username is shown in brackets with the character name (and we are allowed to change this at any time.) That way, the username is always shown, there are no problems with identity, but people can still show character name.
---
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? Please explain all knowing character planner. I had no food becuase I had to eat it due to a healing bug. I used my bloodpacks and didn't have the perk anyways. Please explain. Please do.
---
Thank god 3 months after the game comes out youre post is here to tell us about this thing we knew about before the game came out.
---
I appreciate this.  I've bought some decent 1 star legendaries off of vendors.  I drop my known plans in containers, because they're not worth the hassle of selling.  But I don't drop ammo, legendaries or aid because I have no doubt people with mules or 'traders' just "Take All".
---
It is a subliminal design feature, by staring at that rotating wheel you are being conditioned by Todd's soothing sub-audible voice in the background, "love this game, like I love you, and buy buy buy from the Atomic shop".
---
More workshops would be nice
---
I do and thats nothing really man not trying to be a dick either they are easy to craft and ppl sell them for 300 caps a peice and I have traded and grinded since day one to have everything that I have and yes a tse of every type tse's are not rare nor are bloodied you wanna see rare weapons I have guns no one else is trading because I refuse to let them go most the time to prevent that rarity being lost mind you I'm not saying I have to be the only person with these but I am confidant I am one of very few.
---
If they're not your kill then sometimes they spin forever
---
I would equip an auto eat and drink perk card just to improve quality of life
---
So, you just felt like telling someone they were wrong, cause it gets you off or something. 
---
Cool.
---
Grogs are lighter. If this is something that matters to ya. By about half.
---
I just started a new character today and some kind soul left about 300 of every basic starter ammo in the trashcan in the first Red Rocket in Flatwoods. May Atom bless your soul.

This! Rad Worms is bugged to give a 50% increase to any effect on your player, positive or negative! 
---
So, if you sprint with rad worms maybe the increase to water / food rate gets an additional 50%?
---
I suspect it is the cause of many of the bugs reported here. 
---
I just roll with it and enjoy the +50% to damage mutations and chems :D
---
Become an unstoppable worm and drug addled beast!
---
I actually didn't find this quest until a week ago, I'm sure there are others out there who would appreciate the quest, but still don't know it exists. 
---
No need for negativity. 
---
Unyielding is amazing if you are a ranged VATS user. More agi for more AP and sneakyness, more luck for faster crit building, more Per for better vats accuracy. The bonus strength doesn‚Äôt hurt for carry weight either. 
---
I typically leave a plan at each vendor whenever I do a vendor run, but likewise I've only seen another plan once out of hundreds of times.

KID CALM DOWN HE HAD 16 MUTATION SERUMS CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ME. HAD 10+ STACKS OF 16 SERUMS EACH. ALL WERE DIFFERENT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HE IS USING. (Other than speed demon, Marsupial, Scaly skin, and that other armor one) TSE IS THE MOST DUPED WEOPON, AND IS HARD TO GET.I DON'T CARE, I JUST WANTED TO HAVE MY FIRST NUKE BE A PROPER EXPERIENCE. 
---
Sometimes I'll log in and see 6-10 events going on at once, others its a bit of a ghost town. I think it just comes on to bad timing when connecting to the server.
---
Actually didn't know some of what you said üòÜ is that because herivore and carnivore negate eachother?
---
If this happens just move your camp nearby to build a stash box and store your stuff. Only costs around 40ish caps.
---
Nope, I'm just stating something. Your complaining about people stating things, yet you put a post on Reddit were anyone can see it. If you dont like being called "wrong" then dont post to Reddit 
---
Give ya tree fiddy
---
it was dead to casuals from the beginning. Which isn‚Äôt a bad thing since the game was never designed for the casual player. 
---
The dupers are annoying yes. But the reason for ppl leaving is Bethesda‚Äôs total lost of control over their own game and disconnection with the community 
---
It says a lot about how much the game revolves around inventory juggling that most of my perk loadouts have at least 3 weight reduction cards in them. I know that at least part of this is done to make us have to play through content we've done countless times just to maintain weapons, armour and ammo but damn.
---
I'm totally the reason they're unkillable lol. Charisma perks have rad sponge, which is take rads and you heal rads on everyone around you. Share it at 2 stars and no one has rads. I can share 5 point perks so I don't share rad sponge. One of my team mates shares 1 or 2 stars of rad sponge. With rad sponge and ghoulish you're constantly healing and healing rads, so it's a pretty big buff. I also have team medic 3 on constantly, first aid 3, suppressor so they take less damage, tenderizer so they deal more damage, and traveling pharmacy 3 so I can carry hundreds of stimpaks and radaway, and every other chem we could need.
---
Other cool stuff I can do at level 200. Share power patcher, weapon artisan, gunsmith 5, makeshift warrior 5, super duper, all sort of other stuff.
---
Between events and stuff I share Sun-kissed if they have rads, photo-synthetic if they're low on health. I share traveling pharmacy or thru-hiker if they're over encumbered. I'm crazy buff-bot lol.
---
Ah I'll be sure to go pick some flowers next time I'm in a nuked Prime zone. Thanks for the tip :) 
---
Someone on here want to sell me a 2 shot explosive lever action for caps???
---
Yeah it sucks especially when you logged into a server with your camp spot taken. 
---
And the Bethesda anti fun police strikes again. Another win for them.
---
Like literally right now the only event happening is power up Poseidon power plant in my server  it‚Äôs annoying im trying to do my daily quest to lvl up 
---
I would have several mutations but keeping them without the perks is a chore. And you can get them in bulk for cheap, but won't they all TSEs rise in price due to the slow elimnation of duping, and other sources being harder?
---
Congrats, a loophole an extreme minority of players might use. It's still better than the bs system in place now. 
---
Even the molerats spawned inside
---
Nah. It‚Äôs another 800 caps to make your stash box look different for the 47th time.
---
Professionals always know best, professionals should control what everyone on reddit thinks. Because what does reddit actually know? Not more than professionals that's for sure.
---
It was a while ago...I was level 41 I think...came across a suitcase at WS Station that was filled with alllllllll kinds of hardened mass, glowing blood, radiated fluids...and tons of legendary armor and weapons! Thing is I didn‚Äôt have any so I took them all haha! Next thing I know I was at 800lbs and my camp was near Sutton. 
---
Sold stuff to the vender and dropped a bunch back in the suitcase. It was such an insane find. But since then, nothing.
---
Why the beam splitter on the laser weapons and splitter and flamethrower barrels on the plasma guns gets bonus damage and benefits from "Rifleman" perks, not from the "Shotgunner", "Heavy Gunner"(or)"Commando"? This kills usability of this weapons for non-PERSEPTION build users.
---
I like what you wrote.  I wrote up a different perspective and then deleted it because it amounted to the same kind of thing, but only a slightly different approach.  In the end, the end result was the same and it fit the same behaviors you observed.   I do suspect that the container contents just held in memory on the server because changing sessions changes the generated contents and I believe you can leave a session and come back to the same session to have the same stuff loaded in there.  We know that contents of global containers persists even if you disconnect because that's how people are transferring much of their stuff to alt characters unless they use a second person to act as the intermediary. 
---
I do think that the container generates loot based on a flag that indicates whether your character has looked in that container yet or not.  Once it is generated then that flag is set in that instance and the container contents is tracked at that point.  I suspect that no container contents is tracked unless it has been interacted with which might explain some of the instability after a session has been around "too long".   Maybe it is just tracking too many things that aren't getting properly cleaned up.   Maybe global containers contents should expire after a reasonable timer.  Pushing this out to every player might significantly increase server load unless they do something to balance it.   
---
I do like the idea of having container types so that when we put stuff away we can put weapons with weapons, armor with armor, etc.   I see that as at least having the potential for reducing server load because it limits the scope of the tables being interacted with (depending on database setup).  
---
If you nuke VTU (Morgantown area) then you'll find shedloads of cobalt flux in the form of mutfruit, as well as bloodleaf in the river.
---
There's also a decent amount of yellowcake flux there too.
---
The [Book of Eli OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DIxIgZR1Do&amp;list=PL5D064E0EB89444C1) is fantastic if you're looking for a break from Inon Zur's melodies (the default music, not the radios). 
---
Panoramic is especially haunting, I can actually listen to that on loop for hours lol. 
---
No tse are neutered and price will only slightly rise if the get re balanced beyind that they are no where near the worth of some guns hell I have a western revolver worth more then almost any tse gun or my combat knife.
---
you know that would require work and thought. It‚Äôs much easier nerfing everything. So that is what‚Äôs being done.
---
Nah I mustve ate something or had something because it works like a charm now. I wish I knew what though. :/
---
Find me one person who mains the Broadsider. I will gladly converse with then privately.
---
I don't think asking her or Lone to take a look is bad form.  Then again, I moonlight as a bull in a china shop.
---
I couldn't care less about the caps, and as I wrote, I'm not really ready to sell it now, as I only found the gun yesterday. But I always wanted a handmade, and still do, although it's less powerful than the shotgun after the nerf (I guess...).
---
I'm pulling screenshots off my PS4 now, so I can show you the gun later. It is a double barrel 3 star legendary, and the third effect is useful, too, iirc.
---
Later, ...
---
Are there two types of flatwood monsters like there are mothmen? The stalking mothmen dont stick around to fight, they just steal your soul and bolt. The vengeful (?)mothmen will usually fight till the end, at least in my 3 or 4 encounters.
---
I found one flatwoods monster early on and he disappeared first shot, the second time I found him I melee'd him. the fight took about a minute -it was in the bog before I had marsupial, I either kept falling in the trenches and hed be on high ground, or when I got up, hed teleport down.
---
You know, that's not surprising at all with how Bethesda has been *handling* things. I'll check later this evening. This is so disappointing. 
---
Your reading comprehension isn't very good, is it...?
---
It's just the servers tanking. Each client requesting to see each inventory and then modifying theirs and the ghoul by looting stuff then creating more by dropping bags everywhere and then people trying to modify those loot bags...
---
Basically it all multiplies together to cause a load of inventory lag for everyone.
---
...and asshole griefers.......
---
Or just let username them. Like you could with gear in 4
---
Camden park 
---
You can get the plans from Campden Park vendor
---
I wasn't full.  I was happy with my base.  The guy was a pain in the ass.  I haven't had a problem with budget increases as I level up.  Other people I play with have had problems with that; probably because I have moved my base around until recently.
---
Personly I think it's the really rare mods that make the value. I have a "critical .38 reciever" for my hunting rifle. While it itself is not that great, many more mods like that are.
---
Pardon me, ‚ÄúGreat Game‚Äù. Clutching at straws a bit there bud.
---
You don‚Äôt need to be loud man, just live in the realm of reality, then weigh up the factual pros and cons. If you find the game fun then good for you but don‚Äôt take a turd and make it out to be a roast dinner. Your defending points are things that have been in games for years, some examples even decades. Whats worst is those things that have been around for years were badly implemented in F76. If it can‚Äôt even get the basic shit right then it never stood a chance to begin with. It gets ALL the backlash for good reason but please continue to live in your fantasy world just expect most to disagree with your feeble points of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great game because it has trees and shit‚Äù lol :P.
---
I‚Äôd be more skeptical if his Reddit account was fresh but the dudes been on here for like 5 years or something. Why would he put that all on the line just to make stuff up? I guess anything‚Äôs possible though. 
---
Or they just tank energy resistances for enemies across the board seeing as per lore that's how it's supposed to be. Instead we now have enemies that have higher energy resists than they do physical resist.
---
Sunshine oil? Safe to say I have not seen this yet after almost 400 hours playing this game.
---
LOL WTF NIGGUH?? Go back to your video game posts???? Hahahahahahaha
---
I agree completely, it would be amazing to build towns, guilds/factions, and even better would be self sustaining town that functions even when logging off. But honestly I dont really see that happening at all with this game. They would have to tear down and rebuild to much of the game for proper functionality, plus it would be riddled with bugs and glitches galore. 
---
"In the midst of a build-balancing fiasco, let's just flip the table and scatter the pieces."
---
So RadWorms is bugged and instead of multiplying rads by 150%, it sets *all* character "spells" (things on the Effects tab) to 150%. Then when it wears off, it sets these effects back to 100%, which overrides the jump modifier back to 100% (or normal height).
---
They didn't say absolutely 0 PvP but they did say PvE.   I'm not sure how they'll handle workshops.  I have no problem with PvP related to workshop holding, but leave my f-ing camp alone. 
---
Don't, wait until it's $10 in a bargain bin, or free to download.  The game isn't going anywhere and honestly your hard earned money deserves to be spent on better quality products.
---
I did the nuke drop finally today! Super, right!!  Na, I got booted right after the bomb dropped. 
---
        
---
If for some reason I am low.. i sold too much to a vendor... big bend tunnel is a win for weapon scrapping.
---
This (purified) water is too clean for your soup.
---
Or better yet, become a feature
---
Decontamination Arch.  I use it near a radiation zone to decontam, drop off my stuff, fix my weapons/armor, and get back into the action.
---
Reported :)
---
I don't know the specifics of your character. That's on you to sort out. However some general things:
---
&gt;I'm starving. Taking health damage, so I cannot fast travel.
---
Tend to your food/thirst needs prior to a run? I can't imagine that the run takes so long that you starve in the process.
---
&gt;Massivly overencumbered due to valuble quest rewards.
---
Drop items. What's more important, the item or getting to the nuke zone?
---
&gt;Teammate left quick and had no food.
---
Call team mate back to help you. Otherwise were you ever really a team?
---
Now some of this is easier in hindsight so I have some sympathy but a lot of this is pretty obvious stuff. It doesn't take rocket science to think about what you might need or need to plan for.
---
Basically a sticky roll that doesn't rot. Called dilberts (sp)  sunshine oil on the recipe when you find it.
---
I've had this advice earlier and I do appreciate it.  I "knew" about this weeks ago but in the heat of the moment I didn't recall that option at all.  So, next time, having learned the hard way I will move my camp.  It is a pain in the butt.  A simpler fix would be for Bethesda to not require flux for repair.  Everything else I can come by in 20 minutes or less and/or already have it on hand to repair.   The flux was the only thing I didn't already have on hand to repair.
---
Oh exactly... Wtf is that about? Can't cook with clean water lol
---
I just realized that this game should be in San Fransisco because we are all 49ers.
---
Hmm, well alright. Now I have something to do again.
---
Wait. So you aren‚Äôt gonna give us the link to where we can order the GS controller/76 bundle? 
---
What a tease. 
---
I think this all speaks to the general frustration in the game. Bethesda has not demonstrated the ability to fix anything without screwing three other things up. They fix something really dumb and screw up every mutation and status effect in the game. Brilliant. 
---
This.  I want 30k caps compensation or $30 back for being lied to.  I play the game so can't ask for a full refund but that price slash 2 weeks in was fucking bullshit robbery, should've been a $30 preorder.
---
Please place all unwanted items in the vendor cash registers, play on the side of light. Don't be a Vogon.
---
Never noticed. 
---
I don‚Äôt even play this shitty game you fuckin tool LOL
---
No problem
---
I get tons of unstable flux.  Stable flux is a lot harder for me to make.  I haven't been getting very much high radiation fluids lately.  I get plenty of hardened mass.  Last time I had enough hardened mass and other stuff to make plenty of stable flux, but only enough radiation fluids to make 6.  That was after a good long run destroying any radiated baddy I could find over and over again.
---
Reported you for racism to Reddit, not the sub :)
---
PETA trying to pull a sneaky, but we're too clever
---
Why do people keep forgetting about Grafton? The Grafton vendor in town, not at the station.
---
LOL ok if that gives your thirteen year old brain peace of mind. An accounts just an account lol. You aren‚Äôt doing anything.
---
Hell yeah. If and when I reroll I'm curious to run a Cha build but without a regular group it seems pointless. Right now my Special build is 15, 3, 7, 3, 8, 15, 3.
---
We aren't talking an eye for an eye, but 20 cap bounty in exchange for losing something that takes an hour's worth of farming (for all the materials AND the flux combined to complete the repair) that isn't close to balanced, not even talking about fair at this point.
---
Ok, great :) glad to know you approve
---
My doors were locked.  He was outside. Try again.
---
yeah, and people are selling her cola's on ebay since no one know where she is. I swear lol
---
The overseer is very disappointed in you 
---
That says more about you than it says about me.
---
But it‚Äôs limited to the 200 cap limit. If I I buy a plan for 6000, it only increments the amount up to 200.
---
What happens in New Vegas stays in New Vegas?
---
You're a game developer?
---
Carnivore mutation + party boy perk = no more hunger or thirst
---
I do the same when I see bags, grab the plans and weapons/armour and put it into a till or suitcase. there is very little left for me to learn as far as plans go so why the hell not. i will also drop any magazines or I have no use for.
---
They changed it some patches ago. There was a big uproar here but we all forgot
---
I watched this happen.  It was blue smoke and as far as I can tell an artillery strike shortly after it.   I was in the area when it happened.
---
Survival games are gonna follow the Negan route by that logic, and thats not what makes a survival game fun.  Games that aren't fun don't do so well.
---
I enjoy the game. I don't enjoy all the recently introduced bugs.
---
Oh I see I didn‚Äôt even notice
---
i wish. hooded rags was my favorite outfit.... i even make a berserk/chameleon playstyle for that costume. 
---
Exactly:   Pacifist mode only prevents you from doing damage to someone else.  That's it.
---
heheh.
---
I was referring to the Mandalor bay shooting.
---
I went to West Tek to get some weapons for my daily caps run a few days back. I stood far right to snipe the first few and the suicide dudes when I noticed their health would chunk then instantly refill as if nothing happened. I tried four or five different guns from pipe sniper rifles, lever action guns and .50 cal to miniguns and pistols that I had on me. Every single one did the same and it bugged me a lot. I went up to them with my trusty All Rise and blapped them which saw their health go down and stay down. I sighed and relogged to change server and saw that it wasn't a problem there.
---
I don't know what it is but my experience was limited to just those super mutants outside before I left the server. I've gone from playing this game frequently to feeling like I should in order to get my daily caps and not even that is enough any more. I've finished Fallout 4 a long time ago but even with a smaller world that game with mods is far, far superior to this mess.
---
What does party boy do?
---
A medic pump really helped my survivability. 
---
This was my first experience with something like this at level ~84.  I've been playing since the beta.  Probably not as many hours but I've been playing since the beginning.  I've had some great interactions with players and I've had others that just do their own thing and go on their way.  Either way is fine.  This is the first experience I've had like this.  I'm not interested in playing this way.
---
I think 50 is fair. It gives you enough freedom to build your character how you want without becoming a superhero who‚Äôs good at everything.
---
No.  It isn't.  It isn't even close to what was offered when the game came out.   
---
I make it on 2 or 3 times a week.  It's really annoying to not be able to get caps any faster than this with a real life to juggle.
---
You don't live in the realm of reality, you live in a world where your opinion is the only thing that matters and anyone who disagrees is wrong and delusional. It's a great game, flaws and ALL. What essay are you going to type up for this one?
---
i get the serendipity animation and audio every now and then but i don‚Äôt even have the perk equipped 
---
I had him RES tagged "anti-duper" for [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aesz3j/i_am_a_level_200_bounty_hunter_ive_played_this/) about hunting down dupers.
---
oh.
---
Im just wondering what kind of servers Are they?
---
If games like wow can hold like 100-1000 players per server with theyr stashes why a fallout potatoe server can‚Äôt hold 25 players with bigger stashes then now lol?
---
I've never personally had that issue
---
Strange, I've seen them open after patch. They were previously all open right? Not sure as I could imagine other players could have always went ahead to unlock them as Im busy looting valuable shit.
---
If there's some lock then it must apply to whoever invoked it, and the lock gets removed and then everyone else can loot them? But according to the thread they are no longer instanced? That's really strange, just yesterday I looted a box like that, it was open near my camp, near the bog workbench, and it had normal looking loot inside. 
---
Im not sure if there was quest about picking it up, I have several quests open so I don't normally look them much, it looked like it was there before I joined the server.
---
Oh man if that's really how it is, I've not dropped any yet and I got maybe 150 of those tapes. The loot wasn't even great? Some stims, maybe ammo, maybe regular weapon to scrap. Why would they make them non-instanced?
---
We really need to bug Bethesda about this to revert this change. There's no way this serves any purpose.
---
Better than you I'd say.
---
~dances~
---
I hadn't even thought about that
---
Man it would be great to sell the massive amount of useless ammo to vendors or even scrap it to make ammo I actually need..... Why isn't this being funded?
---
Exactly,  I am fine with a fair resource requirement.   I get attached to weapon s that have served me well and it hurts my immersion that I have to just toss them aside. I would also like to be able to remove and reattach mods and treat legendaries effects as a mod.  It should require  the proper perks and resources to do so.   That would be more fun.
