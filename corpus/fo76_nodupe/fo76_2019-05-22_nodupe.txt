And FYI, it seems very easy to get mods from breaking them down. I crafted 10, got 12 with super duper and ended up with almost all of the mods. Same thing with the radium rifle got me 1.......

What bugs are still here from beta?
---
And you swing it like a hammer in PA
---
Basically as long as the Horde boss is alive, the game will continually spawn in enemies. The Boss spawns with spawn slots. Each time one of those slots is open (You killed the spawned enemy, NOT the Boss) the game will refill that slot with another enemy. This slot has a chance for the spawned enemy to be a Legendary, potentially allowing for unlimited chance at Legendaries as long as the Horde Boss stays alive.
---
I see, this is just a Xbox problem
---
I dont always notice friend requests unless im expecting one and alot of vendors are afk.
---
Looks good with the green hood - even better if you also have the leather coat!
---
I am a melee build, but during group events use a quad Tesla a few times then just sit there and let everyone else clear out the mobs while they attack me.
---
Oh shoot, I had that too! Who knows how much I lost in my cave roof!
---
They have, this guy has no idea what he's talking about.
---
not really suck per-se.   because for example to get a legendary with the exact prefix and suffix you want is  pretty much impossible to find in the wild it's like a 1 in 100,000 odds chance you get what  you need.
---
you could farm for the next few years and still never find the perfect rolled item you wanted ,but the item shop will sell you one for $29.99
---
and since most people trading now dont accept caps because caps are not really "valued"    you dont have many options.
---
The market on reddit is nice tho.
---
Sure. And sometimes they're right in front of my face and emoting a heart and still ignore the request.
---
Ok honestly the real problem isn‚Äôt players one-shotting legendary enemies.  It‚Äôs how the loot system works.  Players shouldn‚Äôt feel punished for being stronger than the people around them, at the same time players shouldn‚Äôt feel like they need to essentially change they‚Äôre strategy in events where it goes from ‚Äúkilling the mobs‚Äù to ‚Äúlet‚Äôs find the needle in the haystack‚Äù of trying to find the legendary enemy in midst of all the regular.  Give proximity based drops to all players in the area.  Don‚Äôt limit your players.
---
I wonder how many people who were just using the pocked armour glitch got banned for being ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù I know my friend was in the 800 lb range because he just couldn‚Äôt be assed to deal with inventory management anymore.
---
I would definitely do this for someone. I even have a message by my vending machines saying you can message me for a better deal if it‚Äôs too expensive (more like ‚Äúmessage 4 deals‚Äù) as long as someone sends a message right after the friend request or asks me beforehand, either way, I‚Äôd gladly accept and help them out. I‚Äôd even stop what I‚Äôm doing and hold the item for them
---
They fixed mine but it had nothing to do with any ban.
---
Your English is great, but don't let silly people teach you the wrong usage of then/than. It's super easy, but somehow seems to be today's grandest freaking mystery. Right up there with the totally baffling to/too usage... (deep sarcasm intended, in case not obvious for really slow folk).
---
I am wondering if Bethesda is getting a cut of the profits? 20% royalties on all sales of Items being sold by these dupers. Just duping for thoughts. Lol. I don't know why anyone would buy from these stores anyway. For example $150.00 USD for the two Shot Explosive Shot gun. That is a joke in itself. Lol.
---
I did it first try
---
It definitely needs some sort of real endgame like the vault raids that are hopefully coming out this summer but otherwise there is a ton to do. I have more hours in 76 than any of the other fallout games so far so I think that must mean something.
---
Knock out a post here, sometimes people get replies quickly. Just state which platform, if you need someone with particular skills to help, even bullet sponges to take the heat off you while you do your bits. Never hurts to adk
---
Iirc Bethesda tried to fight people grinding areas by having server hoppers re-join their previous one. My guess is the mechanics are conflicting.
---
Yeah, it was that bad.
---
Me and hundreds of others, so like half the player base
---
üòÇ üòÇ Awww...are you all upset because I don‚Äôt like your precious guns, get over it!  Yet you‚Äôre the first ones to get on here and cry like little babies over the slightest thing...am I right?  Of course you won‚Äôt admit it üòâ Grow up, we all have to listen to you whine, so you can listen to me say I don‚Äôt like something üëã
---
You can move things in other fallouts on PC. Ctrl z and hold and move if I remember correctly.  I've tried and it does not work in 76.
---
Could you explain this better please?
---
I concur with this initiative.
---
What? I used to use em' and hardly ever repaired em'. 
---
Some kind of Legendary explosive one might need that kind of attention.
---
You gotta understand it's risky, greifers do the same exact thing and then open you up to pvp with their friends, and to top it all off once your in open pvp with someone they can destroy your camp. For a lot of players it's just not worth the risk.

**Issue: Crossbow "Bolts" Cannot be interacted with in the World (Picked up, etc)**. (Ticket Submitted on 02-15-2019)
---
crossbow "Crossbow" \[WEAP:00055463\]
---
AmmoCrossbowBolt "Crossbow Bolt" \[AMMO:0032B235\]
---
ProjectileCrossbowBolt \[PROJ:0032CEDB\]
---
Assuming the Collision is correct on the mesh, the only other thing I see is the Bolt is set up a bit differently than the Railway Spike which should not caused the fault.
---
However the ProjectileCrossbowBolt is missing a name, so it won't be able to be interacted with by the player.
---
Fix:
---
~~Add the Missing Name to the Projectile.~~  
---
Comparing the changes it appears to have been an issue with the Mesh and not the projectile name.  
---
Credit to  [Formula\_350](https://www.reddit.com/user/Formula_350/) for pointing out the fix I missed in Patch 9.0
---
I've read somewhere its bugged. On my first character and playthrough I was able to complete her mission. 
---
My current character has been to all locations but the quest is still stuck active. 
---
Apparently if you listen to the holotapes out of order sometjmes it will not finish the quest. 
---
Bethesda even has a disclaimer on the site stating just that fact.
---
Yes!
---
So remove all the code, no more bugs.
---
I DO need more, though.
---
For science!
---
if people are losing stuff because it is going to their stash it is still relevant.
---
Did you have gunsmith equipped?
---
 I called it done when I killed her old man. That used to be a difficult thing to do. ;)
---
How did  you complete it?
---
No, for some reason people only focus on 1, its annoying
---
I feel almost certain you put it in there and forgot
---
Here's hoping a similar idea comes around once Bethesda does the 'faction' system.
---
I hear you loud and clear friend. Like your in a bad place and you just cant get out of it. Maybe Morgantowns a girl or job you want but just cant reach yet. The concrete is just self doubt and that grate, its only fear of the future. Be like the sewer water and just flow thru the openings. The TLDR: you need to relax more and your life will get simplier.
---
Oh I know. I‚Äôve linked up with people over social media before. I have 76 on both Xbox and PC. Xbox you can make a global LFG from the Xbox‚Äôs home screen. We need something like that for fallout 76.
---
They are overkill when being used in an event like Free Range where the goal is to keep the Brahmin alive. I‚Äôve watched numerous times where people come in with these guns and go hog wild and kill the Brahmin and ‚Äòsquatch, thus failing the quest. I‚Äôm a melee character so I‚Äôm not familiar with the different types, whether one isn‚Äôt as bad as another explosive wise, so maybe not all of them are that bad. But the ones I‚Äôve seen used light everything up then I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm supposed to be concentrating on, which in all reality is a me problem, but I‚Äôm just stating it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just like the sheepsquatch staff like sure lvl 50 ones with mods do a good amount of damage but without bloodied, SS, power attack or any of the legendary effects they‚Äôre useless compared to the ones with legendary effects. Hate it because I‚Äôd love to run around with a Bloodied, SS Bear claw
---
New event is basically 'free range' part II
---
Sheepsquatch jumps out and everyone stops protecting the animals.
---
Event Failed
---
Oops my bad. Now I understand this issue. Sorry for the confusion.
---
The only thing I can think of is place the general cook stove down ( the one with cinder blocks. Exit build menu. Reenter build menu and try and edit the cook stove to a different one. If not store and then place as the one you want. This might work. Past this one it's up to a ticket with beth
---
I guess that‚Äôs my luck. My friends have tried doing those but we‚Äôve got no one else with them
---
Yay!
---
I just want to be able to learn mods by scrapping them.
---
and make it more common to learn items when scrapping.
---
After scrapping/repairing dozens of laser rifles you would think you would know how to make one.
---
Just focus on looking at the colored circles.
---
I love the Lever action Skin, but yes more skins would be great.. I'd love to have "the Pack" skin for my handmade from Nuka World, make it all pink and yellow. I'd also kill for some Giddy Up Buttercup themed skins or Nuka-Cola ones....
---
What fucking stupid response
---
How does that work with player vendors if a player is in passive? I don't buy it. People need to toughen up or go back to FO4 if they can't even man their silly little shops.

.50 Cal Receiver does less damage than the Hardened .308 Receiver. (Credit to Erik2112)
---
Tweak the damage variables.  
---
Yeah, the head goes to two, but it loses its prefix. That's extremely odd. It just becomes a Salvaged Assaultron Head * as opposed to the wood armor that loses its secondary and tertiary effects, to match the wood armor that you find through natural drops. I have a 1* quad assaultron head that I got as a drop ages ago, and a 3* (now 2*) assaultron head that used to have a stalker's prefix. Idk how the hell that bug happens, but I don't think it's related to the wood armor based on how different it is
---
Sorry
---
Was looking at the full post and title. When I responded. Yes I agree we need a cross the board rebalance of all weaponry. And perk cards. But from working in the industry. Even if Beth rolled a crit and got it perfect for them. We as players would break it in 10min. I want one so bad but ....
---
Honestly, I've tried to gather kindling. I just don't know what the *hell* it looks like. I've done that event 3 times and don't know what I'm looking for.
---
Chems perhaps?
---
Nice work
---
This has never happened to me
---
Not an issue. Hope you get it resolved
---
Thanks for the feedback and helpful info!   
---
**Issue: Crossbow "Bolts" Cannot be interacted with in the World (Picked up, etc)**.   
---
Ironically I saw the notes about the Crossbow Bolts, but " **Weapons:** Crossbow Bolts have been made easier to see."  Didn't seem like a "fix" as not a single person had trouble "Seeing Them", they could not interact with them!.... I guess I should have tested that!   
---
 **Issue: Hunting Rifle .50 Cal receiver does less DMG than the .308**.

Good catch, completely missed that one!

 **Issue: Gauss Rifle "Hit" Bug**.

Interesting, will wait for some more feedback from players before I cut that one, and test it in game!  
---
 **Issue: Combat Knife has an "Invisible" Blade**

Ugh, Thanks, Adding that now

I run a Gatling laser and Gatling plasma build so Fusion cores, copper, and nuclear material.
---
sounds fun
---
When are you guys fixing our online friends to appear in main menu and problems inviting people to the team
---
That's a good idea, I'm going to do the same!
---
Possibly.  He'd have to be using a ton of psycho though.  Considering that 2 psycho only boosts my Handmade to 240~
---
Always pay off your bounty. Unless you want to literally be endlessly chased by posses who somehow know exactly where you are at all times and have a never ending stream of support.
---
rippp
---
It‚Äôs why I keep my prices low. Stash space is more valuable than the stuff in my box
---
At work currently but I'll be on around 9pm*pst.
---
Maybe the flamer isn't as popular as the tesla or laser. But even then, that seems like a pretty good price based on what I've seen
---
Same here. I‚Äôm a melee main but I use a Tesla just for situations like this so I can quickly get a hit and let everyone else get one too. 
---
And yes, I think they should just roll all the loot that any enemy *would* drop into a box at the end. If an event is going, just eliminate normal drops and have them all go to a loot-instanced box. It doesn‚Äôt make sense plot wise but neither does the random aid and ammo that gets magically dropped into your inventory.
---
Except there are approaches to Game Theory that show clear advantages for both sides, and Game Theory came about well after capitalism was well and firmly entrenched in society.
---
I want content. And.... Bug fixes. (GASP)
---
Not 100% sure if it works like that it was just a suggestion , but you could test with a friend not on team?
---
Anyone know if missing legendary stuff got fixed?
---
Can't you? In settings?
---
You can thank bullies/griefers for that. It's too dangerous to accept friend request or team up these days...
---
That happened to me too all the stuff for sale was...no longer for sale but still remained in my inventory
---
So what people do is invite a random person to their team, they have a friend of theirs (not on team) initiate a fight and the two go into pvp, and because you are on a team with one of the pvp players it opens you up as well, passive or not. It happens, it's for real, I've experienced it myself. Considering most fallout players have no interest in pvp you need to relax and understand why people don't take the chance.
---
I use a fire rate railway rifle. And you sound like i hit a sensitive spot.
---
I agree, I started playing Fallout 4 again with Dogmeat as my companion and it adds a lot to the game experience. Dog makes noise, I stop what I'm doing and look at Dogmeat for his cues. That being said tho, the AI in Fallout 76 is lacking compared to Fallout 4. Yes Fallout 4 had its AI issues...but at least the AI in Fallout 4 could figure how to enter a room and shoot at you at the same time or pose any type of threat. 4 Gunners when you're low level....RUN. 4 Scorched when you're low level...bare fist it.
---
üëç
---
Move your camp machine around a bit maybe, this should shift your spawn position.
---
Awesome!
---
People get pissed off at me for using nukashine with quack surgeon
---
Wait wild Appalachia was temporary? Shit I just started playing again and never got to do it...
---
I mean this is the nicest way possible, because it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I've been through it myself, it's a pretty common method for greifers since the indestructible camps and also slap damage being taken away.
---
It stayed in my inventory, but after loading the game back up all the stuff I re listed disappeared. All of the legendary stuff I was selling. I didnt get a chance to list anything else. Kind of afraid to try it again.
---
[removed]
---
Whoever is in charge for this, just have to make an easy work or to make a worker to do an easy work.
---
* Enter in eBay or duper website. 
---
* Make an order.
---
* Buy and receive the duped items in-game.
---
* Write the name of the account that served the √≠tems.
---
* Review the trade history of that account.
---
* Identify all the accounts that served product to the account that serve orders.
---
* Lifetime ban those accounts and delete all the crap they have.
---
What is the part you see potential complications in this plan?
---
For me, the only problem could be that the company had no tools to review past trades, but I think it is not the case.
---
No need at all to try to legally close those websites (all over the world, probably) or to beg eBay to remove the duper sellers from its system. This was going to be the complicated plan.
---
Excellent news. Thanks. I'm planning my 2nd character as Berserker.
---
I want that idea as well. But I'd also like boss fights that require multiple teams. Like big raid dungeons from MMOs like WoW, EQ or ESO
---
I just buy and apply them so I can‚Äôt accidentally sell or drop my weapons.
---
I knew someone was going to post something like this, thanks for not disappointing. Made me smile
---
No, then it will be just like encrypted. Full of leeches and other do-nothings. Average IQ of the online community gotta be below 60.
---
Adrenal reaction, nerd rage, psychotats, ballistic bock, small guns bobblehead, revenant 
---
All those increase damage dealt
---
Too bad it‚Äôs 308 ammo
---
Not if it rolls to see if it should give you a badge, then rolls again to choose which badge to give.
---
No idea what it actually does though.
---
We all have to do our part if we want the game to succeed, thanks for the feedback!
---
yes.
---
I plan to upload something similar soon as well to help players map out how to get as much of it done at once. Thanks for posting this! I‚Äôm putting the finishing touches on mine and hope to add to what others are doing.
---
Same
---
Survival score is definitely good. If they are going to have the leaderboard at all it needs to be kill based imo.
---
Yes
---
You can get friendly ghouls too
---
There is usually dead death laws near fissure sites I would check around.
---
Someone explain what I just saw.  Mules get the mission rewards?  Is that it?
---
I know the railway rifle, it‚Äôs the explosive ones that get me. When you have multiple people in an event firing away on those, it gets to be too much for me. I‚Äôm there for the event. Hell, I‚Äôd rather stay back and protect the Brahmin in Free Range just to pass the event, but those guns do damage to both and then the ones that are there for the event have wasted their time.  Not a sensitive spot...I‚Äôd have to actually care to be bothered, I‚Äôm just stating my opinion.
---
Why does it have to be all or nothing? Surely they can come up with some 'player has contributed to event' conditions as a middle ground.
---
Would you still do the event if that person wasn't there? I don't see how this affects your play experience.
---
I run it when I log in as its where my CAMP is, can range, sometimes I get maybe one or two legendary enemys but still pick up 6-8 legendary items, usually 1star, but get scrip for them. Best I've had is 12 legendary items in 1 run.
---
Ha first time i did it i didnt either. I just gatheted logs. Same thing right? Nope. Kindling is just sticks on the ground. You get area markers on your HUD theyll be under trees and when you cursor over them itll say dry or wet kindling. Only pick up dry than put it on the fire. The game explains nothing.
---
This would have been better if my original goal was to get to Morgantown, and not my C.A.M.P
---
I know the majority of the community doesn't like PvP, but I personally am really excited for the battle royale mode. Hopefully nuclear winter comes with some pve content as well.
---
Several challenges which I've attempted multiple times to have them register, to no avail.  
---
\-Social: Make a Friend. I've tried adding people through the game and it didn't log it.  
---
\-Discover Locales: Cranberry Bog stuck at 2/5 even though I've already discovered Abandoned Bogtown, Allegheny Asylum and Cranberry Glade || Mire: Treehouse Village and Valley Galleria already discovered, yet not registering either. || Savage Divide: Top of the World and Huntersville, also not registering as found.. even though I've discovered those back in November. || Toxic Valley: Grafton Dam and Wavy Willard's Waterpark. Add those to the list of bugged locations.  
---
\-3 out of the 10 Survivor Story Holotapes: Responder Colonel, Miguel Caldera and Nurse Scott. All found and not registering as completed.

---
\-Several magazines that I've picked up (which I checked to see if they registered immediately after finding them in the world, not given by other players) do not checkmark thru challenges either.  
---
\-Repair Shotguns: Not logging my repairs.
---
Other bugs I've noticed still persisting:
---
When other players exit their Power Armor near you, it does the same thing it does when you yourself exit it, a split second freeze frame chop up in the game. In certain situations this can mean life or death if a player decides to exit their PA during combat. I've actually died due to this before going up against a high level mob surrounding me. (Note: PS4 Pro)
---
Going into your pip-boy hologram variant menu in certain situations (such as when just loading into an area after a fast travel) causes your whole game to lock up, disabling all controls except to open up the map/menu and quit, which is your only friend at that point.
---
C.A.M.P. budget showing incorrectly depleted/used up when relocating to a new spot (even if you scrap the blueprints) until you restart your game after moving and placing down what you stored up.
---
Exiting a world while still in a +100 Excavator suit bumps you up to +200 carry weight (without Calibrated Shocks) until you either exit the armor in that session or die. \*This one might seem like a good thing to some, to me it's a detriment as I can get carried away sometimes and hoard way too much junk only to find myself forgetting the bug is happening and I exit my suit to cook something at a random location to then not be able to fast travel again until they get rid of tons of stuff.
---
Massive drop in frame rates (PS4 Pro) when in big battles, to the point where it's hard to judge my aiming movement due to how sluggish the game becomes. Happened today at the new Arktos Pharma event with several players and monsters around me. Had to spam like 6 stimpaks because of the delay on button inputs with the frames chopping up.
---
Freeze frame chops when switching between different weapons on the favorite item wheel.
---
Lots of PS4 blue screens of death / game straight up freezing. Some of it seems to have been improved on with today's patch.
---
...There's plenty more, this is just off the top of my head that I can think of. Don't get me wrong, I'm not here to complain about the game. I love it. Level 115, 400+ hours in, and I play with around 3-4 other good friends of mine and we have a blast most of the time. It's just that some of these things really deter this from being an extremely smooth experience, which, 6 months you feel like is not much to ask for.
---
Don't get me started on all the QoL improvements and changes this game needs. That's a whole 'nother beast.
---
It just feels like now is the time to reinforce and fine tune this archaic engine, as it feels that all the assets carried over from FO4 also carried with them their diseases. We need some Creation engine antibiotics to be produced, and it's possible that many will need to be created from scratch.
---
There will be an Automatron like DLC in the future. Mark my words. Everyone wull have your pet robobrain
---
I couldn't even get to the elevator. Logged on, saw it was active, FT'd to the event, and hard crashed to the xbox home screen.
---
That‚Äôs terrible; hope someone from Bethesda sees this because you could lose a ton of value...
---
When did players stop enjoying just playing and start enjoying getting loot?
---
Serious question from a 38y player.
---
Back in time we used to enjoy the game for itself, not for the rewards :/
---
I agree with u/Rafa343x   
---
They are completely different games. Both have pros and cons. 
---
RDO takes a LOT longer to make any significant progress and they are saying the summer patch will have bounty hunting, game hunting, and player shops as ways to make income. 
---
i enjoy both games. but everyone has different tastes. i hope you enjoy RD2 so you won‚Äôt have wasted you miney.

I'm not trying to attack you or anything. But the suggestion of pushing Bethesda to charge us for extra camp budget only hinders the chances of patches releasing increases for free. I believe periodically over time, the camp budget will get bigger. It's in their best interest anyway, majority of purchases from atom shop are probably related to camp items and PA paints. As people buy more stuff from the shop, they fill their camps, Bethesda then needs to increase camp size to allow people to continue buying from them.
---
It may not be every month, but we have seen like 2 updates to camp size since launch, I'm not banking on it, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was also in a small increase with the release of display shelving.
---
Have not had that issue yet, on PS4. Went down there a few times today.

I thought they already did

Basically, multiple events will default players there, that post from March had plenty of people confirming it. Also, players commented about how the dev room is no longer accessible, it's in a separate world space completely.
---
I mean.. I didn't need that link to realize you're full of it, they moved that room long ago and you're just going off very old information.. and worse, you're harassing players because you think they're "cheating". You really really need to find better ways to waste your time.
---
All I am saying is its should be available to update the instance its hits 12:01 am. Nobody wants to wait to download the dam thing.
---
No one shows up to this and many other events  now that player vending is a thing.  Go to an event, no one shows, look around the map and all I see is people hanging around camps.
---
I died a few times down there and immediately respawned still in the basement.
---
I mean that's fine and all but don't get upset on reddit when people point out youre an asshole, because you are one.

OMFG.

My first time in it, I was literally the only person putting food in the trough.

This is true. You can bet your ass I defended that level 1 radroach  with my life. Nobody touched fluffy on my watch.
---
I mean... They are giving stuff away in the store. Like the orange carpet.
---
Would it have been better if they explicitly said it was for the mistake?
---
The reason I rush to take out the open range sheep squash is because delaying the kill is almost guaranteeing a mission failed because more bugs arrive than the available players can kill to protect the brahmin. No way in Atom am I failing that event again!

Nice! And also nice!

Any idea about the event cooldown? I noticed it triggers with player activity just like Campfire Tales but I'm not sure how long is the cooldown or if it only starts during a specific time.
---
But God F O R B I D XD
---
it seems to be less then it used to be... or maybe i was just lucky last night.
---
I haven't tried it in months but it was shit then. It gives you an area to search for the person but that area doesn't update or update quickly if they walk out of it or fast travel. If I wasn't in a group chat with the other 3 it never would have ended.
---
You know what? I think I was wrong - maybe they don't overlap.  I may have been confused, because I forgot some corpses are considered a "scene" and other corpses are considered an "object".  I'm counting each individual dot right now, I'll let you know when I'm done. Just didn't want to waste any of your time
---
I had this happening after the purveyor too. Very frustrating.
---
I sell for 5k or less. I simply don't need more, and really don't need anything if you think about it (just a game and all that). So if someone's like "hot shit, 5k for a XYZ!", good on them.
---
Yup. I haven't been able to use a fermenter yet. I'd get the "budget" message. That was supposedly fixed. Now I get a "not slots available message."
---
Did they even test what they did to see if it would work?
---
I don't think all that takes 30 mins.
---
I'm not talking about team invites, I know those are risky with randoms. How is a friend request a risk?
---
it starts when you enter the building
---
Thanks
---
I keep seeing  "TS shotguns" being pushed as good. I thought it only adds one additional pellet, not an extra round. If so, then TS on a shotgun is probably one of the worst prefixes you could get. Am I wrong?
---
That would explain why I‚Äôve listened to them all but shows as not completed. Not sure why you were down voted for giving helpful info lol.
---
I think the alpha depends on the friendly creature tiers. I normally have a 3 stars legendary sheepsquatch, but I also found a grafton and a fog crawler, all 3 stars legendaries (when we had level 2-3 in the creature tiers, can't be a coincidence?).
---
It's just this game. Most people are constantly playing and being disappointed, hoping that each new add-on will have a reward actually worth playing for. Rewards are cool but I just want more content to play.
---
Honestly, I have no idea.  Maybe someone can explain.  I don‚Äôt like double barrels so I‚Äôll scrip or sell this one too.
---
I‚Äôm in florida.  It was in the 90‚Äôs in December.
---
The Bounty Hunter AI is actually incredibly smart, and I dont just mean they know everything. Bounty hunters will show up if youve been firing your weapon or scaring people. They will ride to your last known location, and then track you from there. Ive spent tons of time spying on Bounty Hunters while they are chasing me. You can watch them get off their horses and check the ground for tracks. Dogs with sniff the ground and then start following your scent. Also, its not never ending. When you kill the handful of bounty hunters they dont keep coming unless you are wanted and stay in one place.
---
I will be kind of gutted if they get removed, but at the same time it won't effect me too much, in fact it will give me some more budget since I will have to remove my lights etc from the 6 or 7 deathclaw ones I had.
---
I glance at the list and say "oh, here's something I can do in under 20 minutes" and do those. "Pic of Player" things I don't watch for, because they're so picky there is no promise I'll see it even if I look for it.
---
Like the graphics look like new Vegas mountains? Idk I think it's a rendering issue
---
 If you move your CAMP controller it will move your spawn point. You can put it anywhere inside the circle.
---
Thanks for your honesty. I only ask because I am a shotty main, and I avoid TS shottys because of this. Lately I see people pushing them, and it's made me wonder if I'm wrong. Hopefully someone else will know. Cheers.

---
Here's the link the one 0art says we advise listening to these in order.
---
Haven't done it yet but I gotta be honest it sounds both overly familiar and tedious.  Protecting animals?  Loot is worse if you fail to protect them?  Where have we seen this before?
---
I was thinking it would be something like the Yao Guai Fist from New Vegas. I think this is better, somehow, though. A whole flippin' bear skull on your arm.
---
Added, let me know your thoughts, as a non-bloodied melee, the posted is based on my usage.
---
Well, if you want mine, I‚Äôll sell it cheap.  But I won‚Äôt be online till tomorrow.  I‚Äôll probably vendor it and see if anyone wants it.
---
It doesnt affect YOUR experience, but it seems for most online games they will sacrifice some players enjoyment if it means stopping exploiters.
---
Read my post again. I said a cosmetic pet. Not a protective one like the ones we can tame.
---
I haven't seen one since the Mothman event. :/
---
No, please god, no.
---
Keep it away. And that one fucking song about being a mighty mighty man.
---
Yep. It‚Äôs conduit avoidance &amp; kindling blindness all over again. Oh, and keep those turrets repaired!
---
This would be perfect. It reminds me of Arks taming system!! :)
---
Saw a pic of one on market sub yesterday. Im in same boat as you. Looking for that fall damage. Most are a weight reduction or limb damage. Didnt think it existed either til i saw that post.
---
Exactly,  for every 100 units you put out you‚Äôd get maybe 5-10 nukas.
---
Downvote all you want but this sounds both familiar and tedious. Defending animals?  Getting worse loot if you fail? Where have we seen that before?
---
No, I'm in here, because I thought this was a bathroom, then you sat me down and chained me to this bed
---
I'm down. I've been doing it solo. Usually successful, but can only save one animal and am not getting good rewards for it.
---

Saw a thread detailing the specs of each survival legendary this month. This week's has Nocturnal....so do with that what you will
---
You are that difficult customer that wants no onion, chips on a seperate plate, add mushrooms, steak cut into pieces etc.
---
Imagine a job where you can just ignore those customers and still get paid. Welcome to 76 trading, where the difficult customers just get ignored and the store still makes caps.
---
I think you got it spot on!
---
It broke viability on all continuous damage melee weapons. The main solution is to increase the damage. I have made bloodied and non+bloodied build with buzzblade, the damage increase would fix both.
---
I've been playing since the beta and gave gone thru all the ups and downs. I have to say it is so much better then from release. It still has a ways to go, but it definitely is much more fun to play now.
---
I play WoW, FFXIV. Neither of them constantly have big patches unless it's an expansion drop or major content drop. Not 8 GB for a dungeon.
---
Thanks I had no idea.
---
150? wtf. if i were to purchase a gun here. 5 buck max if it was the exact thing i was looking for.
---
Apparently you did not read my post.
---
I investigated the area.  There was no CAMP around.  Nobody was walking around the area.  There are no caves around the area.  And there were no stairways to heaven around.  There were also no events going around that area to teleport them their.  So why would there be player dots there for 5 to 10 minutes?
---
And people thought duplication glitches were patched but a new one cropped up.  Same thing could have happened with the developer room.  Just because someone says the original way no longer works does not mean there is not a new method.
---
Yeah , it‚Äôs pretty good
---
Where do you put the code in to?
---
Yeah, I same. It's probably been there since they released the repair kits. But I just noticed lol
---
Cool
---
A bathroom can be 2 things! And You should always read things before signing them.
---
I'm avoiding it for a bit and letting everyone enjoy it before I go in dying a lot and have everyone revive me a bunch
---
It's not my fault that you're name is Dr. B.Athroom

Light wood laminate!
---

---
As always thank you friend!  
---
1)  Edited the Scope issue to put it under the "General" as it's effecting all scoped weapoin.    
---
2) Never noticed that one, will test it out, but would explain allot, great catch!    
---
3) Hmmm Do you know which patch you think this started in?
---
Heavy build TS Gatling with Power armour you dont one shot everything but you do massive damage and have good protection.
---
Unfortunately with the way this game is set up it‚Äôs going to be like this. It‚Äôs like this for many games. Hell battlefield 3 was like this back in 2011
---
Say light wood laminate...one more time....
---
Awesome, hopefully more will weight in and provide some feedback here as well, but glad the first reaction is positive.  
---
Now lets see if Bethesda "hears" us.
---
Gatling gun. Heavy gunner perks, Stabilzed. And the Luck heavy gunner perks. Use Gunsmith 5 and Power Patcher.
---
If you enjoy having to download several gigabytes every two weeks, sure.
---
Are updates frequent or something ?
---
It used to add another shot at full damage, but it was nerfed so its 9nly 25% damage on the second shot.
---
I hope it doesn't happen to anyone else.
---
LOL cheers
---
Selling any flux farmer jay? Or more of a razor grain guy?
---
Don‚Äôt see the fuken point in mules and how the hell ppl find time to even level up 4 mules
---
&gt; I wouldn't count on that without first trying it out. 
---
I'm not. I'm just going by the patch notes, but there's always stuff they didn't bother to mention. I know that.
---
Fun game but be prepared to also experience the buggiest game ever made
---
This is the last time I visit the Insanity Ward
---
So it wants me to redownload the whole game. Has this occurred for anyone else?
---
Like how buggy 1-10 ? And are they game breaking bugs
---
The problem is you thinking they can ban accounts faster than they get created. And for no real benefit for all that work. The efforts should be on removing the duplication hacks like they have been.
---
Put it this way I see a mule standing there doing nothing I‚Äôll just leave the event and they get nothing as well
---
This could not be a more perfect weapon for my character
---
He's right you know.
---
I feel like the quests are much more exciting and it overall seems like a better experience as well!
---
You could try your luck on Deathclaw Island. 
---
Guests of Deathclaw Island stay at the fabulous burial hole. You and a guest will be maimed and your entrails will be scattered along the riverbank before being deposited into the burial hole of your dreams!
---
For PVE, I just use 5 unyielding shrouded wood. Didn't seem to get a big boost from chameleon. With a proper bloodied build you are sitting at something like 37 AGI which combined with sneak perks makes you pretty much undetectable even if they are walking directly into you.
---
Damn, I like the sound of that!
---
Yes but be wise and don't buy it directly from Bethesda's pages for 60‚Ç¨. I got mine for 10‚Ç¨ because no one wants to buy it so shops and few online markets sells this really cheap.
---
I've seen several videos that said West Tek is pretty good. Apparently if you nuke it first it's filled with glowing ones.
---
I still get irritated all to hell when I spawn at Whitespring after it's been nuked and I die before I can reach shelter, spawn half a mile away, then someone comes along and steals all the "junk" I've spent days gathering.
---
10/10 buggyness but not game breaking so long as you can cope with experiencing some type of bug every 5 min. You do just get use to it after a while, but some of them are frustrating as hell.
---
System?
---
Cram your player vendor full of your surplus and hang out building or something?
---
Why?
---
You think Bethesda doesnt have expenses or something?
---
Xbox. Sorry
---
‚ÄúSo clean‚Äù 
---
Post apocalyptic game, give me the grimy looking white and blue wooden plank floor any day over the clean rubbish.
---
Damn that‚Äôs kinda of discouraging I delt with Bethesda games being buggy in the past but I usually have 255+ mods so it usually worked out. Can‚Äôt really do that here  that blows
---
Burrows is a pretty easy run through to add into the rotation for a decent xp grind at your level too.
---
Leave all your weapons and Armor behind at your camp but one low level weapon. Drink some Nukashine. When you come to, take a random chem and start running back to your camp. You can only use what you find. Take a random chem very time  the last one runs out. It may be weird but it won‚Äôt be boring.
---
As much as possible once you leave you can never go back
---
Actually sounds really fun
---
A work of art.
---
You can add me aswell! My PSN: CaptainModrah
---
I'm not sure what it is but I got a recipe for like formula P? Or some shit like that
---
About as buggy as Skyrim ever was without having to worry about if you saved or not. My computer is nothing special and I‚Äôve never had had the major problems some people complain about. Servers can get slow or quit sometimes but it‚Äôs a big mmorpg, even WoW has that.
---
The skin for the handmade in FO4 that you got from The Pack was totally legit. I want that one for all my weapons.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I‚Äôm doing that, it‚Äôs a great idea.
---
Exploiting what? Seems like a solution looking for a problem to me.
---
The Blackwater mine is usually a nice spot to get some xp, if the miners are there, then pushing through the small passageway before the bridge in the mine is worth a look. Otherwise keep an eye open for events. Teaming up with a high level player will increase the difficulty, but will also ring a higher return of xp. You don't have to be the one to kill them as long as you get a hit on them, you'll still score xp.
---
Yeah, most of my lengendaries despawn in seconds.  It's irritating.
---
I‚Äôll have a crack at it that!  I never really bother bethsey with this stuff as I doubt they would look at it in a billion years
---
It seems this is the one way they can't neuter your post-apocolyptic experience. Seriously, Farmville seems to be more the average posters speed.
---
Well I think the game is so cheap now it‚Äôs worth to try....I play it....I have love hate relationship with it, but I persevere cause I enjoy it. But without a doubt it makes eso look like heaven. Every update you also get to enjoy old bugs reintroduced and some new ones and some others fixed....it‚Äôs areal joy in the bug department...it‚Äôs becoming a part of its charm
---
Sounds like you got lucky, pal.
---
I didn't get it
---
Yet we can only nuke appalachia, and more than anything else, we nuke the Enclave bunker. Well played Enclave
---
Not so much the effort. I put in the effort for stuff if I can do it. 
---
I cannot, however, take a picture of a different player nude in a nuke zone by myself.
---
If it‚Äôs the one‚Äôs you have ‚Äúbook marked‚Äù in a way, they will pop up after relogging.
---
Well then you‚Äôre fighting bear-handed, duh
---
Bethesda isnt going to allow players to just be in proximity of a legendary and get a legendary weapon for it. Thats just how it is. You want the legendary? You have to damage to it. Sure it sucks when others one hit the legendary, but then you really didnt kill it did you? So you dont get the legendary. They cant add a fix to players being assholes.
---
Apparently you did not read my link. You could just Google the location and multiple results would come up that all say the same thing. That location isn't the developer room, that location is where the game puts you when it doesn't know where you belong. The same happens with the developer room, it defaults to the center of the map. That doesn't mean that's why they are there. Read the fucking link next time dufus. 
---
Also, here's some fucking common sense, if they were in the developer room they would crouch, 100%, because *everyone fucking knows it hides your location when you crouch*. Beyond that, Bethesda put traps on the room itself along with everything in it. The moment you entered you would be banned. If you managed to pick something up, instantly banned. This is common knowledge months ago.
---
You, Mr wannabe police, need to fucking stop assuming stupid shit. It turns out that nearly 100% of the time that players try to be vigilantes, you're actually just harassing other players. This is 100% what you are doing, fucking play the game and leave other people alone.
---
I‚Äôd love a squirt gun for the pump action. As summer is coming.

It‚Äôs a SHOP. Like a STORE. Where you BUY THINGS.

---
It won't result in a ban. Having duped items is fine. Having more than one of it is bad.
---
I'm speaking specifically to shotguns. There rounds are shells with multiple pellets (buckshot) as its base model. So on shotguns, I was under the assumption, it adds one additional pellet, not an additional shell. Does that make sense?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen it yet, but it seems like you get rewarded as long as one creature is alive. If it gives you any of the rewards from just keeping one creature alive, then I don‚Äôt see the reason of trying to keep everything alive and ready for the final few waves. (Personal opinion, my first time I got the Arktos Pharma Lab Coat.)
---
I only accept invites from my irl friends anyways because once you accept somebody on ps4 it adds your real name and Facebook info to your profile for them.
---
Bethesda did. Half the games population duped and cheate their way to top tier loot. You all want your play style, but God fucking forbid anyone wants a relaxed paced game that feels rewarding right? I don't even understand why you're here if you don't agree. I'm looking for supporters that want an easy agreement and a friends list. Not breaking any game mechanics, just not trying to be some neckbeard out to torment others. If you disagree, move on. This isn't for you. But I think your obviously scared and most likely a duper since your a big old raider and all. Keep your shit mechanics, I really don't give a fuck, but down voting me is hilarious. Seems like your ass is a bit tender at the idea of people organizing against grieves lol.
---
If you last played in beta, then skipped some updates, then updated in bulk, chances are there are some leftovers in your installation. I'd reinstall it.

If I sleep first to get the 5% rested bonus, eat a cranberry relish, and use a leader bobble head, I can get 200 xp per level 68 super mutant at West Tek. I‚Äôm level 144 and one run gets me almost 25% of a rank up.
---
Okay, but then what about legendaries that arent tied to events? The way youd determine whether a player gets to loot it then? Whether they have contributed right? Then we are back to the same solution. Whether they did any damage. I can see making it so that during events you get legendaries from the event being finished rather than killing the legendary enemy, but this doesnt solve the issue outside of events.
---
Dont be tricked by the MG42, its a bloody magnificent weapon but by god you'll be spending absolutely forever lead farming.

I've been going with a critical/sneaky rifle build, so every 2nd or 3rd shot is a one shot kill. Is that close enough?

It‚Äôs happened enough now that it seems obvious things are disappearing.  There are lots of reports of this.  I‚Äôve had people in my party that fast traveled and showed up missing a PA part.  My 1* handmade vanished.  It was just a hunters but it was my only leg handmade :(
---
Each part of the labs (ones that have the feeding areas) has lab type (mostly up high over looking the feeding area) rooms with pieces of paper with the code on it.

The passcodes are in the event rooms on notes u find in offices and all that‚Äôs there is junk and enemies
---
Yeah shoulda known better o well
---
Looks good with the welding helmet especially
---
Wonder if you get it again you‚Äôll be able to sell any extras. What does the backpack look like?
---
Tried. Didn't work. Ive uninstalled and reinstalled to no use as well.
---
Personally no but it was recommended by someone previously so I figured it must be useful in some way.
---
Is that a bad thing? Do you not want to sell stimpacks for 15c?
---
Yea. I got in the first try. Nothing was loading. Now it crashes as soon as I go into the elevator.
---
The Corvega backpack is pretty interesting, I guess. But I'm *still* just waiting on that Military Intel Officer uniform with that beautiful beret, though.
---
But be warned that workshop you captured is only yours until you log off that server, or get disconnected. That was my first workshop experience, get it all set up, then start doing some other things waiting for those materials to start rolling in, and the game crashes. All gone :-(
---
I work nights and play later on my 3 days off same time zone. Psn sneazel
---
It‚Äôs certainly Bethesda‚Äôs fault for not making a more dupe-proof system. I don‚Äôt know exactly how pocket armor worked back then but weird thing happened to me in the past when I bought junk stuff from another player. That‚Äôs when I realized how unreliable this program can be. It‚Äôs like simple math could go so wrong. But having a faulty system doesn‚Äôt mean everyone should feast on it and destroy it. It‚Äôs like when someone left his car engine running when he grab a coffee, it doesn‚Äôt mean I can jump in and drive it away.
---
Had the same thing happen. Once I cleared the needed HDD space, and clicked on "install", it appears to have recognized the original installation file, and the launcher proceeded to just install the latest update. My workaround previously was to simply launch the game directly from the game folder, however the only way to update the client is through the launcher, as far as i know. Unfortunately, i don't have a workaround for the free space issue at the moment. Best of luck!
---
Ooh I didn‚Äôt think of wearing the engineer uniform, I was using the drifter outfit. Works well with the bos hood.
---
Are you dense? Your post means nothing, it‚Äôs just your opinion of what happened. The post this guy linked has multiple people confirming a list of reasons why player characters will appear in this location BUT NOT ACTUALLY BE THERE. You straight up accused someone of cheating just because you didn‚Äôt have an explanation for something.
---
There‚Äôs everything from people saying that it acts as a placeholder point when players spawn into a new world, to the bugged event icons that appear in the exact location you say you saw someone. No to mention the bottomless wooden crate that a lot of people use to transfer items so you don‚Äôt end up crashing a server in the trade menus.
---
Maybe do a little research before throwing accusations of someone cheating around.
---
No what I mean is that if players got a legendary for simply being there. Imagine doing the SBQ with a crew of high level players that are actually helping, and then 5 level &lt;50 players show up and hide in the corner, increasing mob spawns and making your life more difficult, just so they can snag the legendaries after you do all the work. I get what the issue is, and get frustrated by it myself, especially since Im melee main, but I dont think there is any better solution that wont create Vultures who will hang around and snag up good gear after you do the heavy lifting. Most online game developers when given the choice of either stopping players from using exploits, or making the game more enjoyable will stop the exploits. Bottom line, if players dont have to work for the good gear they will put in less time, and spend less money.
---
Guess mine is just lazy my deathclaw is way more cosmetic than a "guard" lol idk what your expecting from lvl 21 daisy but i think your putting your expectations alittle too high buddy

Bad ass!
---
What do you mean? The 76 community is mostly wholesome no matter the platform. I play on PS4.
---
Still seems to be bugged even after the latest patch.  WTF, Bethesda?
---
5 accounts? sure, you're not duping at all.
---
Cool, I'll add you.
---
Boy that‚Äôs not a skin that‚Äôs an entirely different geometry.
---
They never claimed to have fixed it this patch
---
True! I didn't mention that so thank you for doing it here.
---
Maybe you you carelessly use explosive weapons a lot.

Crashed on first try when the boss was down to 50% hp (PS4). Second time was a win, got a nocturnal baton ü§Æ

It's a teal blue color with teal and white stripes on it on the bottom part of the backpack and the word "Arktos" written on the top part (I don't remember if "Arktos" is in the teal blue or white). It definitely looks much cooler than the Pioneer Scouts backpacks which I was had a tadpole and a opossum on them respectively kind of how there is a sloth and mothman backpack in the backpack concepts Bethesda released. However, I doubt I will get any extras as it was learned on my top right of the screen without giving me the plans. I could make you one for free tomorrow at 3 PM EST if you are on Xbox if you want.

Well this could also lead into making different kinds of jerky, made with different meats and spices, and have it work on the same system as the fermenter.
---
New recipes for jerky, using like 3/4 meat, salt, other ingredients for different types, then put the crafted result in some kind of drying over or rack until it condition bar degrades and it turns into jerky. The trade-offs are that Jerky doesn't spoil at all, and retains some or all of the benefits from the meat it was made from, but it takes like 2 3 or even 4 of a meat type to make one jerky, and eating it may cause thirst to go up for a short time.
---
We know that gauss rifles were really expensive to make or at least mass produce. And we know that enclave pretty much had the monopoly on the tech. So maybe the one we see in Fo4/76 is the enclave model and the other one is the expensive less made one. 
---
Regardless I would like the skin as a cool swap.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm on PC. But now I‚Äôm gonna have to try getting it and see how well it fits with the Arktos Pharma Lab Cost I got xD.
---
Nice, I'm on pc and haven't found one in the wild since patch 9.

You are right. But they are selling PA skins totally change its appearance whatever PA it is... so why not?

Raleigh Clay's is confirmed. Heaps of them growing in the planters. Planted a bunch around my camp for others to use.

I do quite a few, so I can buy stuff in the Atom
---
Shop if I wanna.
---
But only the ones that you can do alone within reason. I do alot of the picture ones.
---
And only if they are 30atoms or more. If its just 10 atoms it needs to be easy. But lately , all the easy ones require a team or partner.
---
They REALLY want to get teams going , and are clearly catering to a team based crowd.
---
I wonder if thats because something in the future will lead to team versus team type play?
---
Seriously! Both musician and chemist were clearly broken and they didn't fix. Bad form Bethesda.
---
Yea just an actual apology would make me feel better. But I think Op's point was this was an easy opportunity because the items were already free anyway.

Yes absolutely, but to the best of my knowledge it's an extra shell.

Glad to hear it‚Äôs not just me. I was going crazy trying to get down there. I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
I've had 0 issues.
---
Yeah my attempt was at dolly sods. I think I might make it my new side mission to kill 10 radscorpions to make the venom syringer that does 40 poison damage plus base damage so I can use that.
---
Sounds like I struck a nerve.  You sound extremely unhinged over a video game.
---
I report and move on if I see any suspicious shit going on.  Bethesda investigates any potential wrong doing.  If there is foul play, they deal with it.  That is in no way harassment.  If I was to message these people and verbally berate them, that constitutes harassment.  I am in no way targeting anyone.
---
Let me just correct some things for you
---
Photographer: EXTREMELY easy if you know what to do. For vertibot just claim Grafton Steel Yard workshop and repair the landing pad and a vertibot will spawn. For cargobot, use a supply requisition to call a cargobot. Dont bother trying to catch it where it lands as it is tricky. Just wait until it drops the package and mark the area on your map. Then call it again and wait at that same area for it to return.
---
Electrician: You dont have to become the conduit 60 times, you just have to be a conduit for 60 seconds total.
---
I am on Xbox which is maybe why but not sure
---
Dumb question but I haven‚Äôt played today, how does the new content start. Is it a poster or something like the others?
---
Same other then a bit of lag.
---
What platform is this?
---
Best bug report ever!
---
...exterminator XD
---
Bye.
---
There are two finger bears sat on a chemistry workbench wearing gas masks. Can‚Äôt remember the name of the location but it‚Äôs top north, northwest edge of the map.
---
The two in the cardboard box boat near the lumber mill look cute and the one sat by the graves with military helmets on wearing the campaign hat is cool, that‚Äôs just south of the monorail towers.
---
Yes.
---
It works! Thank you kind soul!!!!!
---
For sheer burst damage output probably quad explosive since you can do more damage with no reload.
---
I didn't run the new event yet but it was working fine for me, no disconnects
---
Do you know how long you have to wait to start it again?  I don't want to keep joining halfway in... :(
---
I table danced in flatwoods and some guys gave me a few caps and a laser rifle. ü§£
---
"Okay," "I'll try and tone it down...." :-)

I haven't owned a tse yet actually I ran a two handed melee build forever but got bored of it as things were too easy for the most part. I figure a bloodied stealth sniper or just a stealth sniper in general would be a bit more grindy and challenging/fun.
---
It's good if you use explosive legendary weapons or PvP alot
---
I haven't played the new event. If you'd like give anymore information, I'd appreciate, but not necessary. I will take this advice for when I go to try the event
---
Use radshield, that'll give you a bigger rad resist then rad-x and it won't suppress mutations.
---
Just curious now....my PSN is willblake_
---
What personal info do you see? I feel like I've got my settings pretty squared away.
---
Needs some laser turrets on the nose!
---
Working tonight and tomorrow but I‚Äôll be on for a few days after that. Been hard doing events solo and iv crashed my last 3 Nuke attempts. Lv 165 melee.
---
PC.
---
I'm not big on the pvp in this game as it always felt lacking to me but I've never gotten to use a tse rifle yet as I ran a two handed melee build. I definitely would like to get a nice tse rifle at some point for my build though.
---
This is what I came here for and haven't found the answer yet.  Its normal like 30 minutes for the campfire one right?
---
LOL i might try that while wearing my tattered dress
---
I‚Äôm down, I can‚Äôt talk much but I play almost every week night. Sleepz2184 lv179.
---
Upset?  Couldn't care less.  I'd rather make sure the event is successfully completed than someone get a 1 star level 15 rolling pin.
---
Far as I am concerned it ain't over till we have a nice and quiet face to face...She's got some explaining to do. For example I'd really like to know how she explored all of Appalachia in a day. Bull shit if she was just one day or hour ahead of me and I got to where she was just 'after' she left. She has to have a Transportalponder or a variant thereof and I want it. Oh, and I'll take it too even if I have to pry it from her cold dead hands.
---
&gt;You can't just print money.  
---
Tell that to my Marine Recon Helmet plan. 30 caps for 2 glass, 1 plastic and some rubber.
---
I would like to tour! Do you remember their ign?
---
Hell yeah, or release them in the same style as The Fixer: a reskin with a specific effect at the end of a quest. 
---
I‚Äôd love it if they added the handmade skins from Nukaworld.
---
I can't play it at all no matter what I have tried. Xbx 1
---
Im not gonna be a dick and downvote but i dont like the idea because its a wasteland not a petting zoo. Sorry man
---
How do you give someone top comment?
---
Yeah same I am trying again to see what happens
---
Here comes the almighty ban hammer. Better drop it in some water so nobody could ever get it again
---
I'll give it a try tonight. Not sure why anyone would need to kill a bloatfly with VATS using a melee weapon anyway.  I just swing once and they're dead. That's probably why I'm not seeing this a problem.
---
I'm like 100% sure they were under floor decor, now I can't find them at all.
---
It's sugar-something; I really forgot. His ign was showing up when I took a picture, I dunno why it's not in the image.
---
Truth

This question gets asked multiple times a day.  Here's your answer:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
I see one about once a week. Usually in the savage divide.
---
If you add somebody and they have their Facebook linked you see all their info when clicking on their profile.
---
unfortunately, have to pick up the magazines from where they spawn in the world. seems like more of a challenge that way
---
I changed the jump hotkey. I thought I was already safe
---
But what the hell i still jumped
---
Green hood?
---
This is true, even though it has been stated that the pylon ticks (reply above). And yeah, I don't doubt you could call in a cargobot, though I've never really bothered with them, as they seem utterly random in the location they choose to drop, and from my experience they seem to be rather quick to swoop in and drop. Sure, I might be wrong in that assessment, but again.. never really bothered using those holotapes, just going on personal experience. Think I've got somewhere around 4-500 of them by now.
---
I was mainly pointing out one way of reliably getting one to show up at a select spot, aka. the collision course event. Actually did it they other day, and worked like a charm. Only problem is the event is semi-rare to spot for some reason. Maybe because it's tied to a low-lvl quest in the airport, Idunno tbh.
---
Appreciate the input though. The frog in a jar one finally works aswell.
---
Bummer
---
Yea I was messing around waiting for POE to download and decided to start stripping. Lmao
---
Almost like things are different in real life and video games
---
protip: hit ALT+F4 to beat the boss
---
I know; just look for a player shop near the Top of the World. I'm gonna try again later when I get back from work
---
The people who just sit on top of a building or the bear, who don't collect kindling or feed the fire can GTFO when it comes to getting a shot on the legendary.
---
Theres 2 quantum bears in the lucky hole mine one's above a little drop off a rock holding a pickaxe with the other hanging onto the pick off the ledge clinging on for dear life.
---
I always make sure to take pictures when i find them i think there a hilarious little addition to the game.
---
I started getting the little white, I wanna say lighting glitch, where is kinda looks like a smudgy crack, or glare. Happened to me a while back like 2 months ago
---
all probs seem to be xb1. no problem here on pc
---
if you still dont care, sell me your bear claw and lab coat please
---
Back before the plans were marked (Known) in the game (and you just had to remember which ones you knew) there was a PC mod that did the same thing called "Known Plans".
---
For what its worth someone was already in alpha silo. They nuked arktos pharmacy during the event. Not much happened. The event stopped seen a couple of legendaries and few more reg ghouls.  Not worth it imo
---
I‚Äôm on console and I have no freezes atm runs really smooth
---
Or ballon grenades ? hahaha jk you member? I member?
---
They should make a thing in your terminal with a list of all the events and you can go through and toggle/check which events you'd like to receive a pop up on
---
It‚Äôs still the beta.
---
idk, it worked for me. after the update and maintenance i quit my game and started it again, when the event was active i fast travelled to arktos(not the event), then went down the elevator and it worked. 
---
don't know if this helps or not.
---
oh and im on xbox
---
One server hop and Anne was in the fountain at Bolton.  
---
Thank you, I've really put the camera off for far to long.
---
I was only on for an hour and also haven‚Äôt run the new event yet and also ran really well this evening.
---
That said there have been a few threads regarding issues on xb1 tonight so it might be worth checking those out for any relevant information.
---
amazing information drop dude
---
Lol, unhinged? From a guy who can't be bothered to click a link, can't be bothered to Google if there's any other reason (that's obvious) why players would be there, and would waste Bethesda's time reporting players even though you have no clue what's going on..
---
Dude. Come on now, you can't be that daft. Stop your Mr Vigilante act and go take your meds. And find better ways to spend your time for Christ sake.
---
Ah, okay.
---
Raider armor plans only drop from one quest, rose's top of the world quest. It drops once, and only once per playthrough, meaning you need to run through with multiple characters, and it doesn't even drop all the time.
---
It is missing from all other loot tables. Or at least it was, I haven't seen anything suggesting that's changed, before patch 9 at least, haven't been keeping tabs since then.
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Yeah I tried to get that collision course event to pop up but I server hopped like 15 times and it never started. The holotape way is guaranteed
---
Thank you!
---
I think that is kind of the point. The big issues aren‚Äôt getting fixed, period. For example the Swarm of Suiters event has been broken since launch and was only fixed with the pioneer scout update, where they had to fix it because practically the entire player base was going to be in the area. That‚Äôs almost 6 months of broken content. There are even users on this subreddit who do ‚Äúbug roundups‚Äù after every patch outlining what the issue is, what is more than likely causing it, and how to fix it. Bethesda is a multi studio behemoth in the gaming industry, there‚Äôs no reason they should get the same passes as a indie dev.
---
Why must you break my heart at every update fo76 ? Why?
---
So is this a manually aimed stealth sniper or a VATS sniper?  The reason I ask is you appear to be half and half.  Really high luck would generate  VATS crits faster and you have Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint to generate AP in VATS, but no Concentrated Fire, Better Criticals, or Crit Savvy.  If you did want to swap between manual and VATS sniping I would take at least one rank of Concentrated Fire and then 2 of Long Shot.  Some may recommend Four Leaf Clover, which is great if you have low luck, but unnecessary if it only takes a few shots to fill the bar.
---
Gun Fu is another good VATS perk in agility, even one rank. Unless you PVP Secret Agent is a waste of 3 points.  PVE mobs barely will detected you with the stealth perks you already have and a silenced weapon.  You are also missing White Knight, which you don‚Äôt necessarily need but saves on repair costs.
---
Tormentor is great for auto rifles or a boss fight.  Makes no different if you are one shotting everything with sneak attacks.  Might be better to have it for certain situations, but run better criticals or something else.
---
What mutations are you running that necessitate class freak?  If you say adrenal reaction then I would say run and bloodied build and give different advice.
---
If your used to fallout buggy or have ever played an online game then you get the idea. Its not anyworse then every other fallout. I can count on one hand the number of times i have been dropped from a server(that wasnt my fault) in past couple weeks.
---
With so many people playing they find the bugs rather quickly. Howevet you just solo doing your own thing will encounter much less then the whole of reddit. Or so it is for me.
---
You realize private servers have been mentioned as a feature? You really think one group of people farming xp is going to ruin the point of survival?  Fucking please explain.
---
They could implement monster hunters way of player server management. When kulve taroth comes around there is always players hosting the siege. Anyone not participating gets booted.
---
Green thumb doesn't seem to work with the event plants. I just tried it and nothing... just gathering one per plant still. I doubt the butcher works either.
---
Toss me a friend request. ExecutivePirate
---
Try changing clothes or appearance?
---
Yeah, I did that for a few days after the challenge arrived aswell, but just gave up. It'll happen eventually I thought.. And it took a good week lol. Good to hear the holotapes are reliable though.
---
It has a counter next to A B C
---
Dude FUCK yes. I loved this gun from Fallout 3 and NV. I always used the unique one in NV called the YCS-###.... I forgot the numbers.
---
I would also love the incinerator if fuel was easier to get.
---
There's one right outside the train station at Welch as well...its been there a while. No plans unfortunately for it...also doesn't count for the Musician badge.
---
Someone dropped it, grab the sucker
---
In my post and a following post, I did in fact justify why I believed they were cheaters.
---
No events like Uranium Fever were going on.  No CAMPS were there.  No one was in a cave.  No one was in a sky base.  And no one was idling there.
---
There were also multiple people there ranging from Level 17 to Level 400.  The lower level people were not there at first, they seemed to have fast traveled to one of the people.  The higher level player dots disappeared as soon as I started getting closer to where they were at.  I was also constantly checking the map because I was super confused.
---
I submitted a report because it looked shady.  Bethesda investigates and determines if they in fact cheated or not.  If this is in fact a glitch, I have never seen the dots appear in that area for Uranium.  When the event icon appears in that area, the people always have been at Blackwater Mine along with their dot.  And like I said, Uranium Fever was not going on at the time.
---
TLDR version:
---
Step 1: click on elevator
---
Step 2: crash to desktop
---
Step 3: reflect on the fact that at least it‚Äôs not Anthem
---
Yeah that's how mine is too, didn't get in ever tho
---
Check your terminal
---
Got most of them done by just exploring and searching. Still it‚Äôs a grind.
---
Dang do you get the building materials back? Or is it gone forever
---
It's a real shame we can't play together on the same servers like Final Fantasy XI.
---
That‚Äôs cool, I‚Äôd also like some sort of camo or sniper skins for it as I can play a stealth rifleman/sniper with an instigating gauss as my main weapon.
---
What kind of food do I have to deposit should I bring things to the event or get it there?
---
I have been finding broken cameras all over the place. You won't get the quest that goes with it but it'll help with the camp stuff. I actually found one in the pharmacy today in a tall toolkit. If you're on a PS4 I actually have an extra one
---
I know that. I kept putting food in the same one (receptacle  C I think)  hoping to get 3/3  but it never went above one.
---
I solo'd her a few hours ago. Seems the same.
---
It‚Äôs definitely broken. The time I got in there was no progress showing on the side of the screen. Killed a few legendaries and lagged out. Got a few legendary items tho lol
---
Don‚Äôt know how rare they are, but so far I‚Äôve heard you can get that lab coat or the weapon, but also have a chance of getting a Arktos Pharma backpack plan and stimpak diffuser plan, think the weapon comes as a plan or has a plan for it too.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had problems crashing with event but it‚Äôs not just that I‚Äôm also getting crashed or froze fast traveling to random places and had a few times where I was trading and after the trade finishes one or both of us freeze
---
It's growing in thee water.
---
Oh that sucks
---
I couldn‚Äôt find them in the Atom shop at all
---
Because they are incompetent.
---
How do u do this again?
---
So, no instanced dungeon, no group needed (as its public event). ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Does the event start show as global message (nuke and imposter sheepsquatch)?
---
The challenge comes when no one else bothers to do it anymore, and you have to solo it. Like Free Range now days.
---
It takes alot I think 40 to 50
---
I just got trash legendaries. No cool plans or anything.
---
Lots of legendaries down there though.
---
F76 is a big name, and it was popular to shit on it. The people who jumped the hardest were after the money and views, not the game or the "art of gaming". I'm sure if you checked out some smaller channels or those less interested in fame, you'd find fair reviews. Many a true nerd always does his own thing and doesn't really jump on bandwagons; he had a full playthrough of the game until he ran out of new content, and still comes back every once in a while. He complained about issues as they came up but never made it a point to just shit on the game for the sake of doing it.
---
I thought I had seen one, just logged in and do have one in inventory on PS4.  Specifically it‚Äôs 3* assasins, +25 poison res, and 50% fall damage.
---
I was playing literally was killing the final boss a 3 star lvl 100 fog crawler and I fucking lag out literally 2 shots from it dying
---
Everything you build stays in place on the server after you log off.
---
Give it to me
---
Would the melee vats bug be suitable for this post as well? Where trying to vats melee since the last two patches gives a 0% chance to hit, occurs more regularly on flying enemies like bloodbugs or bloat flies, but also triggers less often with ground enemies like super Mutants and rad roaches!
---
I was bare hand punching the campfire tales boss and people were laughing lol. I saw it on the map and was like "ooh I'm down for that" and when I got there I realized the only gun I had with me was an instigating railroad rifle and I didn't want to be that guy. TBH till this time I didn't know there was a legendary final boss because I guess the first five or so times I did it someone must have one shotted it before I even saw it.
---
The lack of self awareness here is great.
---
You are being incredibly vulgar over a video game.  I will repeat once more - a video game.  You are taking offense because I reported a couple of players who appeared to be cheating.  If that does not make you unhinged, then what are?
---
Bethesda sorts the reports out.  Not you.
---
Grind legendaries for scrip. That should kill an hour or two.
---
Do you use any mods? Bethesda have been adding new files into sResourceArchive2List with every major patch, so you need to add those into your mod line too.
---
Same. It's a shame too, I've gotten many compliments about my kitty, if it wasn't expensive I would spend my earned atoms on it. And Bethesda could have been nice or acted like it was intentional, a gift to the players perhaps.
---
smh.
---
I got mine with a Civil War Suit...would look better with the Black Prospector Hat, but it clips too much through the front.
---
Explosive guns do not hurt the brahmin.
---
So far I've been running kind of a combo of stealth and vats because I'm still leveling my new character up. However in the long run I was thinking of running a bloodied stealth sniper since I would be on avoiding damage anyways. Atm I know I want to run speed demon and marsupial for sure as those are just nice to have on top of them I want adrenal reaction for sure.
---
We can. If you join a friend, you will join his server where ever he is. I was just saying, by default, if you connect to the game alone, game will choose a server more appropriate for you base on your location. 
---
The game is not region locked. GTA V online is.
---
It's super laggy even when moving items from your stash. I had to turn it off tonight and wait til tomorrow. Couldn't take the lag. On Xbox btw.
---
Glad you enjoy it. In the end that‚Äôs all that matters, personal enjoyment.
---
4 Unyielding +3 agility and 1 chameleon armor is better than weightless and chameleon mutation on armor that has the ultralight mod applied to it. Using full weightless armor and the mutation is advantageous when you are going for aggressive stealth and are using the armor mods for combat oriented purposes.
---
I meant the weapon plan, but of man I would love the back plan. The lab coat is super cool but the logo gets covered by the backpack sadly.
---
Ooooof sorry damn that sucks bro I guess I should praise atom I ain‚Äôt got it that bad
---
It depends on what your looking for. Some are locked as drops from events.
---
Like I said, an asshole.
---
Every week lately. And they manage to break something every time. I wonder if they test this stuff before release.
---
Yea, it‚Äôs why I kinda want to get the Arktos backpack to go with it, just gotta hope my luck is good when I get on tomorrow xD.
---
Your advice did help I traveled to the place and not the event but still it fails when I even text the elevator this is so frustrating
---
Its your mods and ini file.
---
I‚Äôm on the ps4 now - trying wavy Willard‚Äôs as we speak
---
Oh man! Is it really? I'm trying to download the patch now. Is it in the atom store? It's not one day only, I hope .. I'm falling asleep waiting on this thing.
---
I‚Äôll buy it from you!
---
&gt; The efforts should be on removing the duplication hacks
---
I agree. Of course this is the first priority. We have to hope they will stop the duping, sooner or later.
---
Otherwise, any action they could take, one way or another, will be pointless.
---
I thought the SBQ was nerfed pretty hard in the previous patch. Still had the mob spam, but it wasn't tanky anymore. Patch before that was a brutal buff.
---
I suspect they tweak the formula with each patch based on collected data.
---
wait, you can get the plans in whitespring?
---
Grafton vendor
---
At least consoles get crash codes.
---
PC it just shits itself to desktop in a fraction of a second. One second you're looking at something, next you're looking at your desktop.
---
What really stings is when the inventory bug steals your favorite legendary weapon.
---
Disappointed that the mouth doesn't open and close,  like the bear trap gauntlet from fallout new Vegas dlc : dead money.
---
im on xbox grinding it right now. pretty sure the way the brahmin move on terrain is giving me cancer though so i might be dead before you can join me. gt- JagoStrife
---
Yeah the Free States Vendor there sells it. In the shop with the terrifying massage Assaultrons.
---
They can't just do that
---
I fucking hope to god it‚Äôs not that BR bullshit
---
I‚Äôm unable to zone into Wes Tek, PS4.  Well I‚Äôve tried 6 times and only once have I been able to zone in
---
This. It‚Äôs there and under 100c for the chest, arms, and legs each
---
You actually do not need the cat, you can just take pictures of other stuff. There are more available animals to photo than you need....
---
Assuming its the photo weekly your on...
---
;)
---
Yeah and everybody using the vendor bots in grafton and flatwoods would get all the enemy loot instead of just the usual leather right arm and five waters.
---
‚ÄúLooking shady‚Äù is not cheating. Maybe they just wanted to avoid nosy little snitches like you, who thinks it‚Äôs their job to monitor someone else‚Äôs game. Your not the cops in game. Mind you own business and I can almost guarantee you will have a better experience.
---
Also did you miss the part where I explained there is a bottomless box there that people use to transfer items to their mules.
---
Even if they are going into the dev room, which they 100% aren‚Äôt since they moved the room to a new location after all the videos came out, THATS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
---
Finally, aren‚Äôt you on PS4? You seem to be from your post and comment history. Maybe you should do some research and realize that you can‚Äôt use the software to access the dev room on consoles.
---
Ooh, sounds cool! I‚Äôll happily take you up on that offer, since I‚Äôm on Xbox. The time may vary, since I have to drive my sister to work, but we can work out the details.
---
Well did you know Behemoths have a range attack, they a rock or mud but it‚Äôs kind of rare so you will usually hardly see it but I was once privy to the spectacle of seeing‚Äôs behemoth fight a scorch breast.  Talking about scorch beasts what defences do you have against them since as it so happens these a scorch beast spawn point to the west of twin lakes.
---
When I trigger the event. I don‚Äôt initiate the event until more people join.( wait the the computer till you see a bunch of yellow arrows spawn in). The rest is up to the players. It will get easier as people become more familiar with the mechanics.
---
Why would it be instanced? It's a dungeon not a raid
---
From what I've read you are right. Only one of the pellets is an extra shot
---
Two-shot adds one projectile, 25% total damage (regardless of projectile count), and 150% extra spread. The problem is the spread, not the pellet count.
---
It crashed when I started the event and if you die down there you cant recovery your items happened 3 times to me.
---
Yeah vault 63 was the one I was talking about I just forgot the number
---
I agree and I don't even *want* the cat and deathclaw bushes (sorry, they're not my thing).
---
Maybe it's changed since the last time I did it, but of the few times I've done it, there's been nonstop defense events.
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs a nifty mask!
---
Good luck my friend!
---
Thanks!
---
Nice. Already own the game myself.
---
I'm saying removing the leaderboard would ruin the point of survival I don't really care if people grind XP in there
---
I did in fact know that. Did you know that it does minimal damage? I sat on my couch and watched him for 20 minutes the other night. In 20 minutes he was able to destroy two razorgrains.
---
As for the scorchbeast, I've only once seen one at my camp, and it was dead on the ground when I spawned in. As for defenses against scorchbeasts, I have a Behemoth named Dave.
---
I tried again got to the point where I‚Äôm killing a boss and on the last shot right before it dies it lagged me out so I won‚Äôt be playing that event until they release some sort of patch
---
The purveyor came out last week, not today.
---
ive been wanting an AAE forever now :(
---
I tried it solo added 31 radsag meat it was still 1/3 tho i failed and all 3 animals died the lv 100 fog crawler still spawned and i almost killed but i died so im not sure you even need to deposit food or even protect the animals or it may just affect the drops you get
---
Never downvoteted you? And 80% of my gear was natural drops, rest I bought while trying to avoid any commonly duped items. You're making a lot of hostile assumptions and calling me butt hurt?
---
You're fine, organize whatever. Most "griefers" and true raiders aren't on survival, no gain. I'll just be jacking your shit in adventure
---
Crashed a lot of times here
---
FRH9P-GJ97M-6DHF6-2FC73-PTVWX
---
Incredibly vulgar? Are you fucking 12? Grow up. Yes, it's a video game, and people don't "appear to be cheating" by being on a part of the map that's widely known to be the location it will default you to when an event glitches out.
---
But you don't care, because the thousands of legitimate things players are trying to report.. those don't matter because they'll just ignore everyone. Because people report some of the dumbest shit. Just like you.
---
You're not just wasting someone's time out there, you're spreading completely false information.. if some idiot actually believes you, all of a sudden we've got a witch Hunt going on, Bethesda having even more of their time wasted.. all because you've got the problem solving skills of a raisin.
---
Again, you **really** need to find better ways to spend your time, minding your own business and playing the game is what first comes to mind. Let Bethesda handle the *actual cheaters*.. oh wait, I've already explained how they already do that- yet here you are still talking shit.
---
Ya beat me too it lol nice catch dude
---
Np

The faction vendors usually have a rotating stock of faction specific clothing.

There are also set spawns for outfits, if you're looking for a particular one search the wiki.
---
Player vendors are also a good source, I know I always keep my machines stocked with a variety of outfits I come across.
---
Certain outfits (like the jumpsuits, the leather coats etc) are only event rewards and very rare.
---
Other rare outfits like the hunters long coat, winter jacket and jeans, longshoreman outfit can be found off the responderbot vendor (who spawns rarely at charleston station and lady Janet's soft serve)
---
Xbox here ... I crash 100 percent of the time if I'm in power armor, but can join the event on the map or enter the elevator without issue. A buddy I play with had the same issue and entering without power armor worked for him as well.
---
I guess that you got your answer today.
---
Oh that does the thing right
---
For the handmade just add the paints from Nukaworld.
---
What?
---
That‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm glad I can contribute to that
---
I'm a rifle player which means I can generally one shot everything with my Gauss rifle. When I'm with others, I intentionally hold the trigger for a shorter time because not only does it do less damage and allow others to reap the rewards, it shoots faster in case some asshole decides to one shot it.
---
The ground lighting is something a number of users have seen, including myself.  It started back in Patch 8, I think.  I'm not sure there's much we can do about it.  I thought it might be a video driver issue, but I'm too lazy to update and find out.
---
I have a 980ti i7 and the only time the game noticeably chugs is when I'm around other player CAMPs.  Certain ones, for some reason, really bog things down.
---

Then you admit there is the probability of fault for your unwarranted response that only serves as an outlet for your aggression. Even if was banned for that, does anything you say actually add merit other than you cater to your ego? Thank you, have a nice day.
---
Apparently there‚Äôs some Formula P recipe or something along those lines that drops too.
---
In that case dump class freak, take Serendipity instead, it will keep you alive.  Also consider nerd rage in INT.  I find hybrid builds to be more fun and versatile, but less optimized then a pure build.  If you are in the process of leveling I would suggest sticking with one build, it‚Äôs cheaper perk card wise to maintain.  
---
What I mean by that is I have all rifleman cards and 3 and at 1, and all commando cards at 3 and 1.  This way I can swap in glow sights for White Springs if I want more damage for example.  The downside is to obtain this flexibility you have to attain a fairly high level, which is more difficult to do now then it was initially at launch.  So concentrate on the build you want, then some crafting perks, then QOL cards that allow you more flexibility.
---
then they need to have an option for non survival.
---
Didn't they recently nerf the double shot mechanic to just fire one extra pellet not another whole shell?
---
For some reason the dont work... although they do work for the scout challenges (or they did for me)
---
u/Ladydevann u/Valseek is there some reason why buying the magazines, etc doesnt work, but finding them in the wild does?
---
Where is this exactly? What section? A B or C?
---
You have to find the visitor camera first, then it will begin to spawn in the world. And I tried to drop or trade the camera, but it‚Äôs not doable.
---
oh geez im stupid I though you could only buy it at the harpers springs free state vendor, thanks!
---
Legendary Radscorpions are no joke.
---
Hey any possibility I can get one of them backpacks?
---
Ok üëå
---
Also don‚Äôt die! I just went down and I couldn‚Äôt respawn. Just lost all of my junk :(
---
Saw mine at the fisherman‚Äôs shack. As most say he was up on a cliff.....watching...
---
Found the keypad and can‚Äôt activate it WTF
---
This would be a good supplement to whitespring, pretty grindy though.
---
Is it as stupid unnecessarily hard like the sheep imposter?
---
Is there a time limit to beat the super hard thing at the end? Does it kill you in one hit? 
---
I‚Äôm a little fucked up after the last rape...er new event Bethesda gave me.
---
Basically before if you spam equip/unequip with a piece of pocketed armour it would reduce your overall carry weight into the negatives.
---
Once it‚Äôs negative you no longer suffered from overencumberance.
---
Made the game a lot more enjoyable not having to worry about weight.
---
..guess I‚Äôll go find a terminal plan
---
Nah. He was banned. He deserved his ban, most likely, as an appeal did not reverse it (seeing as he's trying to get unbanned through purchasing a new copy of the game). 
---
The only variable on my post is the fact that I relied on the fact that the vast majority of bans in this game are for dupers. 
---
OP was banned. OP is trying to evade that ban, and OP's new account would still deserves a ban, regardless of what the original ban was for. 
---
You jumping in to defend him because I said his "duping ass" does nothing but cater to your ego, for unfathomable reasons.
---
Every mod on it adds 1-4 lbs.
---
Shit guess it isn‚Äôt just us xboxers having problems then
---
mods. reduced weight only applies to the base weight
---
The behemoth lost against the scorch beasts, since scorch beast screams do way more damage than behemoth rock/mud throwing.
---
I haven‚Äôt been following the news around this game. Somethin happen?
---
And all I outlined was a way to make that happen.
---
Your right, I'm wrong.  I ment to say the update. Thanks for the correction.
---
only specific foods count, like the new Kelp for one of the collectors. the ones that count seem to emit an orange smog around them
---
No worries.
---
Sure. I can add high capacity, too if you want. It will be free.
---
granted, salted meats now increase thirst.
---
Ok.
---
I'd love to see the faction skins return!
---
You can server hop monster mash with me, theres a certain way to maximize xp to time.  Can run a few events as they pop up along the way as well if ya want
---
Don't act like you didn't do as commanded... ;) Gotta make sure the merchandise is in good condition.
---
Arktos Pharma basement needs a hotfix  your unable to recovery your items if you died it showed me the marker  but no little brown bag 3 times it happen.
---
I'd love to if you are on ps4?
---
Missle silo?
---
It was free on the atom store, might still be.
---
So I just wanna know if I can get a response here, I got a reddit account specifically for this and have never used reddit before but I need to know. Bethesda what the hell is going on? I preordered this game, played its very first closed beta and every beta since and defended this game to my last breath, I preordered the 80 dollar version not only for myself but I bought my wife an Xbox one S and the same copy as me just so we could play because we‚Äôre both huge fans of your games and you have constantly And consistently screwed us both over. With every new update you have broken the game to the extent that we can‚Äôt even play,sometimes for weeks most of the time for a solid month. We both just tried to play the latest update and my game is freezing and my wife‚Äôs game crashes as soon as she tries to enter the new ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù. First of all, your definition of a dungeon must be completely different from the rest of the worlds because this is not a dungeon, it‚Äôs a spot for a random event to spawn, a random event that mind you we can‚Äôt even play because our games either crash or freeze. Second, why in the flippity frog fucking hell is this a shared play space? I don‚Äôt want to get on the elevator to go to this dungeon expecting a nice difficult run through with my wife to grind some gear only to get down there and see level 450 XxcaptainnolifexX already finished and is walking off with all the loot and xp. You‚Äôve been sitting on this ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù for god knows how long and it‚Äôs still not optimized. You are a million-billion dollar company with hundreds of staff members, how fucking lazy are your staff that you can‚Äôt even do this right? I mean Jesus Christ. I would love to play this game, I have wanted a co-op fallout for years, ever since I played fallout 3 on my cousins 360, why are you purposefully fucking us over?
---
Is there anything instanced about this update? I'm guessing obviously not if it's an event, but if you can still explore it outside of that, I'm still hoping for instance dungeons.  But that's borderline impossible on the first week of every new update that adds a new place, because everyone and their mother will be there to wipe it clean in minutes, and that's not fun.
---
Thank you so much for the replies. Much appreciated. I just like to collect the outfits you can find in Fallout games.
---
Or get the personal terminal from the atom shop for free.
---
Yeah man that would be great! Thank you üò≠
---
Im running a low health build with a tse gatling laser, shreds everything but i kill myself more than anything else does. I have a vamp gatling gun with 50% limb damage too, but i burn through 5mm so quick i rarely use it. Heavy gun builds can be a lot of chaotic fun.
---
Again, it is not up to me to determine whether or not they cheated or not.  Bethesda investigates it and decides.
---
Would it be fair to everyone else if they did cheat?  Of course not.  Rather than turn my head I decided to report it because I thought they were cheating.
---
Yes, I do play on PS4 and it has its fair share of bugs.  A lot of the time when you load into a fresh server, you can just walk through things because they did not load.  I try to avoid it because I hate getting stuck but I have been able to walk through buildings and sometimes terrain.
---
Always drop a test item before transferring something valuable. Only a madman would just drop a high value item on the ground.. Use a world container at the very least.
---
If you're part of the event/in proximity you should get the loot of enemies regardless of whether or not you "tag" it. Basically the same as being in party with other players, you don't get the exp but you get loot.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be strange if you went to someone‚Äôs house and the people in the family photos on the walls all had their backs  turned to the camera and you couldn‚Äôt see their faces?  
---
Sorry this just struck me as odd.  If your are part of a family who decorates your homes with family ass photos I mean no disrespect.
---
Lab coat is cool btw.
---
Happened to me as well, and no I'm modless. I lost a lot of junk because I fell through the goddamn world, but it's fine. hasn't happened since
---
Yes it does
---
Something called p serum
---
A lab coat
---
A stim pack diffuser
---
And bear arms?
---
But to get those you will need a decent completion like.. everything saved.
---
i got the lab coat on try #2, no bear arm yet
---
Damn dude, how many characters are you leveling?
---
Well that‚Äôs kinda dumb lol thank you man
---
Isn‚Äôt a post like this against the subreddits rules?
---
Well that sucks. Thanks man
---
Since beta I've made 13
---
Yes loot. No exp.
---
Honestly, I find the whole layout rather confusing at this point, and I'm sure others do as well.  It doesn't help that the game doesn't really tell you where the different friendly animals are once that portion starts.  Is so-and-so in Chamber A, B, or C?
---
It's bs for us peeps who actually grind
---
Absolutely!
---
Yeah. I have no core group of friends that play, so I rarely group up. The entire charisma tree, all the team mechanics, none of that matters to me because I'm never on a team. 
---
If they instance or auto-group some of these events, I'd be support in a heartbeat. I'm that guy that gets a kick out of not fighting, always touching pylons and trying to reduce damage/resistances of monsters. But that entire aspect of the game is dead to me because of the way teams work right now. 
---
On PC it's cumbersome as hell to join a team. Oh, I got a team invite? Let me just, what is it... control+tab? ok, now is it under team? no that makes too much sense... there it is, under recent players. Right click to open the menu... ope, my mouse missed the menu by one pixel for one millisecond so the menu disappeared. Let me just right click to bring up the menu whoops disappeared again. Ok right click, accept team invite, event's over or I died during all that. 
---
I think if everyone in the event space counted as "on a team" even if you weren't that'd be useful. You'd still get a lot of gain out of teaming up in every day gaming if you can, but for world events, it'd be a luxury to have everyone in the area on a team, even if they don't instance.
---
Your account has 5 character slots. If you haven't maxed out the vendors on all 5,just make a new character and transfer items over to sell.
---
That's awesome luck man. Would you trade the White Springs one?
---
Yup 3 times in a row for me. Once after I died so I lost all my junk
---
At 15 Intelligence, wearing full Unyielding for 30, plus sleep/cranberry, I get nearly 2 levels per pass. 172 and counting!
---
Once again that already happens.
---
20 is 1 40 is 2 60 is 3
---
Lmfao yes I agree. I noticed that alot of my loading screens are "Ass" photos
---
Very active, hit me we have alot of people online.  Message me for PSN
---
Arktos Pharma is now a part of the new content that they have been releasing. It has a new event along with new items to get from completing the event.
---
If you collect an outfit not found in Fallout games in this Fallout game, lmk!
---
dope
---
Put the Old Man Winter mask on, then jump off the center of New River Gorge Bridge, something special will happen.
---
what do you mean by new?
---
Damn. I should try that. I knew you get more xp with higher int but not THAT much.
---
I hope I can have all the materials to pull this off. My camp is something not even a homeless person wouldn't dare live in.
---
I...would disagree strongly that this game is better than 4. 
---
I agree over-all with the rest of your points. It's a lovely landscape to explore, it's just sad there's so little to _do_ in that landscape.
---
That was a typo. Fast typing on a phone isn't my strong suit.
---
Yep online RN, ID‚Äôs:  C-1195
---
I believe it‚Äôs somewhere around 1-3% more per point. So 30-60% more at 30 than 1
---
I agree. I haven't been on a team since I started playing (30+ hours as of this writing). I don't even have friends yet. Add me please I'm nuclearsalad
---
I dont use mods :(
---
No mods, what about the ini file?
---
Those are all worth a lot of caps.  Don‚Äôt sell them or give them away lightly.   Drop rate is maybe 1/1000.
---
I find if you fast travel you rarely see it, go on foot and it will track you!
---
No, I am just mature enough to not berate someone over a video game and start name calling because they do know everything about a video game.
---
And I got a good laugh at that last part.  I have not talked shit at all.  I think I have been pretty respectful actually.
---
I‚Äôve done the same thing.  
---
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt somebody tell me my ass was so big!‚Äù
---
Wow have had no problems with it on PC myself
---
It shouldn't but you gotta play around the game you got not the game you shoulda got.
---
... wow. Don't...don't ever do this, unless you're trading trash between alts you won't cry if it's lost.
---
Unless you lose the plans before you can read them bu falling into a fissure.....
---
Know who that happened too?
---
This guy......
---
Server lag. Slow server.
---
They been piling on this engine for 13 years now. Maybe we will get a new engine with Fallout 77. Not the sequel to FO76, but the 77th fallout game.
---
I did a two handed melee build for my main but it's not very flexible without drastic changes. so I figured itd be easier to have an alt focused on this build as well because I got kinda bored with running around hitting everything with no problem. I adjusted my  build some based on what you said how's it look now?  https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f236fe&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2c71ar2an2ao0a04lt2l71li2l12iq2ic4au2la2pe2&amp;w=ir2&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
Dude honestly if you aren't enjoying the game, like your comments seem to point to, just stop playing.
---
Yooo been having this problem a lot lately. Like the other day I nuked white springs cause I needed high radiation fluids, and a whole bunch of lvl 200+ came and killed everything before I could even get a shot in. I was so mad.
---
Likely you're at the wrong bunker, there's a bunch, some can't be opened yet.
---
So they get what they want for themselves and don‚Äôt bother asking...kinda like people visiting your camp and grabbing a cold beverage from your purifiers, right?
---
This is incorrect. There aren't as many posts about PC issues, but I've seen at least one, and I personally can't stay in game for more than 5 minutes.
---
You are just talking to yourself now. Do you think I give a shit to read anything beyond the first letter? Move on big boy
---
Because you are still tracking those challenges, untrack the completed ones.
---
It‚Äôs been a pretty good spot! Glad you found it!
---
you failed to include shutting down ARIC-4 which can ONLY BE DONE IN STAGE 1! there is a passcode door behind her (970930) and behind the door is a lower level where you find the shut down codes. after getting them you can shut down ARIC-4. But again only in the first stage.
---
Yeah but it could be an opportunity to add more, not everyone like these paints :/
---
im still over here trying to figure out why you can‚Äôt use some unarmed weapons in power armor 
---
you‚Äôre telling me I can work the bolt on a rifle, pick locks, and type on a keyboard with those robot hands but I can‚Äôt hold a thing in my hand and punch with it?
---
That is really strange that I got all of them then. Had to be some kind of glitch in the system.
---

---
Aww, I didn't immediately agree with you, so you're settling into petty insults already? Adorable.
---
Psn longtrainrollin, let me just finish this daily.
---
This model just screams ‚ÄúFOOOOM‚Äù
---
Syringer is no longer in the legendary loot table. Drill still is though.
---
CT_ stands for curve table not cut.
---
Anti armor energy weapons could be fixed by adding Mod Target Energy Restance under the effect.
---
A lot of weapons have the issue with scoping zooming in on the gun instead of through the scope. This is an issue with scoping mechanics not the scope itself.
---
They fixed the 50 cal receiver damage for hunting rifles last patch.
---
Some of these really aren't bugs or issues they are just the way its designed. You can get the plan for ultracite laser pistol now with 0 issues due to all plans spawning in vendors
---
No, that‚Äôs how it works.  Pre-duping those would be worth 10k+ each or more.    Now still worth many thousands each.    My recommendation is keep them and enjoy them though.
---
Meanwhile you basically made a witch hunt post against me.
---
Xbox was real laggy for me earlier and it was so bad I had to disconnect for the night. Only went there once and it was unplayable.
---
Yeah I just logged off, did a couple runs.  Got a 3 star weapon and armor (crap), a couple 2 stars and a bunch of 1 stars.
---
Glow sight is a utility card, doesn‚Äôt need to be on all the time.  I would take at least 1 Concentrated Fire if you use VATS.  You could also take Nerd Rage 1 since you have 6 INT.  Fireproof is a good perk, if you PVP, fight scorched beasts, or use explosive weapons.
---
Maybe. The notification is big with a little animation like when you start or finish a mission so it's pretty hard to miss. Weird if that's a bug.
---
"Talking shit" is you thinking you're in the right for wasting employees time when there's legitimate things they have to deal with. 
---
Logically think here, if they actually contacted you back and said "what evidence do you have they were cheating" think about that. How stupid *should you feel* saying "well, they're showing in the middle of the map, but there's no one there!"ü§∑
---
This is why many games warn you when you report someone, that if you're making a false report you can get in trouble. Because they don't like having their time wasted over stupid shit.
---
So I wonder how long until Fallout has to resort to the same, to keep people like you from wasting their time. Because you don't give a fuck, but they have to waste money on stupid shit like this.
---
Seriously, do you have any thinking skills at all? Can you not imagine how many players that have legitimate issues have to wait longer because of people like you?
---
What was weird for me is it crashed 3 times in a row then I hit join event and it loaded me in down stairs. I hopped servers to a friend who was actively doing the event and it crashed again 3 or 4 times! The span of the whole event and it‚Äôs got a 30 minute timer! It‚Äôs bullshit.
---
Why not a fridge! This game is off the rails...
---
That is....terrifying.
---
What's your PSN?
---
Nice, thanks! Joining u in a bit
---
I was Disconnected from server until the latest update, so I'm not sure....
---
You actually solo killed her? Like not one person showed up.
---
I too would like to know. Sometimes it wants me to pay 40 and sometimes 11
---
Man and I was frustrated that my chameleon armor isn‚Äôt working....
---
Added you already!
---
Yup
---
Are you doing the mammoligist quest? I completed it no bug. The cats were all dead but they still counted.
---
Sent you a message with my PSN
---
Found one outside abandoned bog town and I‚Äôve seen him outside white springs. He seems to be a random spawn with groups of super mutants.
---
I've completed them all and are not tracking them, nothing shows up in the pip boy.
---
lol right? or type on a keyboard? its kinda like the "can build a fusion generator but not a fridge" thing.
---
I would definitely buy it if it were a skin.  I still prefer the way the Gauss Rifle looked in Fallout 3 and New Vegas over the Fallout 4 version.
---
Saw him attack the Whitespring by the Western entrance behind the cottage a couple of days ago. Could be a new random spawn for that location.
---
(Also fwiw on top of the pond in the hills between the golf course and Huntersville there's one that will occasionally spawn in the fields behind the abandoned bog town.)
---
I lost whatever I had on me because I figured if I died and got above collision I would be good, but I just kept falling lol :/
---
I honestly don't remember whether or not I purchase them?
---
Did you notice this prior to today's update? Genuinely curious, because I've never seen this in the 229 levels lol
---
Jokes on you, I don‚Äôt have any badges...wait...
---
Im experiencing it as well. On occasion it will not give the option to collect, behaving as if it was dropped and not placed.
---
Wait really?
---
Ok I'll look for the others
---
I have. Bog town about two weeks ago and white springs a 100 levels ago.
---
I figured nerd rage would be good at 3 since I planned on only equipping gunsmith as needed as people were saying weapon artisan is better. I went ahead and re added fireproof as well. I really appreciate the help.
---
Man, that's good to know... Can't believe I've never seen it like that.
---
Wait.. a game boy elder scrolls game?
---
This should be the fucking tagline for this game! üòÇ
---
Hell yeah man
---
Don't think I've gotten any of those yet
---
Yeah Many a True Nerd, Final Render, Oxhorn (when he doesn‚Äôt blow up in rage or start whining) probably many others, are pretty good at what they do. No douchebag alarms there
---
You got that right. Wonder when the actual release is &gt;&lt;
---
Sure dude.  Weapon Artisan and Fix it Good are great upkeep cards.
---
We are the testers man. Cut out the middle man.
---
Wait what? Where are the plans...
---
My first run all I got was a Nuka Grenade Plan....
---
Second run, didn't even get a blueprint...
---
Both times Legendary lvl 100 Alpha Sheepsquatch drops a 1 star item for entire group. They need to buff these rewards a little, I was getting better items off the random no star legendary enemies that spawned around.
---
Address Unknown by The Ink Spots
---
I made a playlist on Spotify, collecting the songs from all Fallouts and added a few that I think would fit in the game. The name of the playlist is Post-Apocalyptic Radio
---
Its no wonder why Bethesda games keep getting dumped down and simplified!!
---
All day today, doing this event Ive noticed countless times players from all levels 50 to 200+ not do a single objective when putting stuff into the troughs.
---
Dont say "its the first day, people are learning!" literally I learned it on my first try, didn't even take more than a minute to figure it out.. Yet I see them running around with their heads up their ass killing stuff but not picking up a single quest item the whole event...
---
Its SIMPLE.. 
---
If you're in Habitat A, kill the Deer, pick up Venison and drop into the trough
---
If you're in Habitat B, collect sludge from the toxic waste piles, kill the Molerats for more Sludge, drop Sludge into the trough
---
If you're in Habitat C, you collect the red/orange plants and drop them in trough..
---
They accidentally gave us that and now they took them away. Not cool
---
Good job on getting that far
---
Kk adding you now
---
Or you know, get a token for the machine or more copies of the S'more recipe to sell.  Like I said, don't give a shit what you think.
---
Is that fixed now?
---
üòÇ
---
VATS works great for me. I wonder why it‚Äôs so different for some. Maybe there‚Äôs a bug with a perk or weapon ability as opposed to a global VATS issue.
---
That happened to me after patch 9. It really sucked. Plus the vending machines don't hold/remember what you put in them so you have to set prices and items all over again.
---
Or.... I can keep doing whatever the fuck I want with the game I played for.
---
Bit late to the party but tyvm this was very useful (upvoted)
---
970930 your welcome
---
That sucks. I'm on Xbox One X and shit takes ages to load as well.
---
why?
---
It's to deactivate the computer and transfer announcements to a friendly mister handy wandering around during the event.
---
Can't find the right build for me so I'm testing out all
---
That's legitimately terrifying
---
yeah, that'd probably work.
---
Maybe research the correct meaning of the term ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù while your researching the limitations of your console. I am simply pointing out that you are falsely accusing another player of cheating, when it is quite literally impossible. A witch hunt is defined as ‚Äúan investigation usually conducted with much publicity, supposedly to uncover subversive activity, disloyalty and so on, but really to weaken political opposition‚Äù. Nothing I said was false or used to weaken your argument, merely disprove it on a fundamental level using the evidence that is available to anyone who joins the conversation.
---
It‚Äôs over man, you had your moment in the sun as vanquisher of the horrid cheaters, and have since been disproven. Move on and learn from this situation. Look into what you are accusing someone of before making it public.
---
3-5k
---
I can drop a nuke for you if you want one.
---
Ugh. I‚Äôve had a lot of server disconnects and app crashes on my PS4 the past week. Losing my character would be a real blow.
---
This.
---
Idk I saw several dozen the last two days. Server hopped a lot to farm mutie kills
---
Well the thing is this week's  code havent been decrypted. Only alpha. But last week i saw 4-5 nukes per day at the sbq
---
how much should I sell the formula P plan for?
---
Not sure. Up to you.
---
I assume you mean for me not on me....
---
:)
---
I would actually be impressed if they had the time to ask about each individual report.
---
If they did I would use the same explanations I gave.  The report should have a box for you to type a reason for the report.
---
And if it turns out that it is a display bug or something, I cannot be held accountable for a visual bug in the game.  They would probably look into it eventually and fix it.
---
Unfortunately I've found that most of the time, the game requires the animals to be dead before the picture will count. Sometimes it will take it when they are alive. It's a hit or miss.
---
I seen him about a week ago farming the bots in whitesprings...
---
Yes I'll nuke whitesprings for you if you want.
---
You have my sword.

It's a pain in the ass. You can spend the entire trough-filling time limit in a single room filling the damn thing as fast as the stuff you are supposed to put in it respawns and only get half way to full. And it is mostly luck if your defense targets survive. Just a single fucking molerat gets through every round to hit your defense target a couple times, and the cumulative damage kills the defense target on the last wave. They need to regenerate the defense target's HP between waves to make this event a bit more viable. My success rate, over level 200 and with great weapons and armor, has been about 1 in 10. You just can't kill the attackers fast enough and the defense targets are too weak.
---
I don't know man.  I had to ask about twenty or thirty people the other day just to have one person meet me at the Charleston capital just to get a photo of someone in power armor.  You'd think people would be after those atoms, but most people don't seem to care even when an offer for them is knocking on their door.
---
People still use Facebook
---
That‚Äôs true but maybe it could be vault residents coming from another state? Could also open another area to explore aswell
---
I‚Äôm wearing exactly what you‚Äôre wearing + a BOS hood. This mask goes with almost all headgear
---
You got any CAMP space to build much after the structure?  Looks great!
---
Ah was hoping it was something cooler thx for the info
---
I think for the radstags, you will see the glow when they turn to meat piles. I THINK, but I'm not positive. I didn't see any glowing until the even was done.
---
I'm 30
---
He didn't get downvoted for asking a legitimate question. It was probably for being condescending.
---
I think the super sledge is higher, i could be wrong tho. If not almost definitely the bone hammer is
---
Its been working properly for a couple months. Figured we where good. Gotta report bugs that re-emerge. Now I know. Again.
---
Ah thx
---
Bullet sponge reporting for PS4 yourfavdeputy
---
Hey I use your mods on PS4!
---
I'm 42. Deleted it a couple years ago. Thought it died lol
---
And unfortunately, at 8.5GB, I can't download Patch 9.5 on my home internet, so I can't even confirm if anything has changed.
---
Fighting with getting Beth Net launcher on my laptop to recognize 76 as being 'installed' via copying files (did it once before w/o having to download everything, but I'm using a different drive this time) but I'm sure as hell having problems. As soon as I can get updated, I can continue the bug hunt with you!
---
Duh
---
I was just about to post this! My camp needs ceiling turrets because of it's weird design.
---
What would be the alternative? Instagram is too vapid.
---
That would be nice but that's not how it works.
---
The 3 hvy wpns cards at one star, bandelier (5mm becomes weightless), stabilized, and one gun army.
---
Thank you! I can now go to bed knowing it's gonna be there tomorrow. :)
---
This is epic. I love this... You are inspiration to crspoy camp builders like myself. My camp is hobbled mess that I've only just recently learned how to make wiring look neater through Player vending only to find I can't remove any floors or anything to redusign my camp.
---
I have near thunder mountain, though I only had one super mutant alive
---
It‚Äôs hidden behind another so you have to wheel around to where it is and select expand and then select it
---
Thanks.  I never figured that out.
---
I only worked it out yesterday üòÖ
---
The bashing damage star is valueless, unfortunately.
---
Are you saying no one helps you activate the pylons? Or you mad cause someone isn‚Äôt doing what your also are not doing?
---
I‚Äôm curious.
---
A final end to duping, these vaults they've been working on for almost as long as it took Obsidian to make all of FONV, perk card "decks" so that we dont have to switch 10 cards everytime we start crafting, 4 and 5 star legendaries.
---
Thanks. I‚Äôve tried expanding all of the options but just not there anymore.
---
Right... thats what im saying?
---
225 damage? Fuck!  I need that.
---
If those things aren't getting fixed, it's likely because the proposed solutions don't work, and they have to investigate more. People are working full-time on this stuff; it's not like they probably haven't tried these suggested solutions already. 
---
You really think that the other studios, who are also in full production on their own titles, have time to help Bethesda Austin? BGS only has about 400 employees across their studios. That's half what CDPR has.
---
Ah, then you‚Äôre in big territory I imagine.
---
I‚Äôve seen a behemoth at whitespring maybe 3-4 times in ~800 hours.  I thought they were nuke zone only until I saw one during normal conditions trying to get past security at the gate near the train station.  It did not go well for security.
---
You made a post telling people to go on my profile and check through my post history all because I think some players cheated.  This is no different than if you made a new thread giving my profile name and telling people that I report players who I suspect are cheating on PS4.
---
You can be cheeky with your definitions but there is a different when it comes to a witch hunt over the internet.
---
The ones with the orange smog are the only thing I was putting in there.  It counted one.  I put way more than that in there.
---
That is correct. It is rare but happens on slow servers from time to time. I prefer it solo as there are not as many adds.
---
I‚Äôm just hoping the whole legendary player or prestige system whatever they‚Äôre calling it actually gives a ability worth resetting to level one.
---
Why do you have to download 3-9 every patch, most patches for me are 1-2 gigs
---
We can trade backpacks now?
---
Nothing is making you buy decorations and skins. Fallout 4 didn't even have any cosmetics and stuff to buy. Instead, you had to buy the dlcs for new content in game. I'd much rather 76s take on giving us the new content for free, and instead making their money off of things that dont really add anything to the game other than some more sparkles and pretty colors (which can still be had for free).
---
I want a new game mode that "survival" should have been.
---
Regular map that everytime a nuke is dropped results in a long lasting nuclear hell hole that slowly expands. It should also add numerous roaming rad storms and generally make the game terrifying.
---
Also hoping for dark nights and reliance on building characters around radiation resistance.
---
Basically I want to  watch the world burn.
---
Agreed, on all points. Before 4 and 5 star legendaries get added, I think duping has to be eradicated. Because items like that should be extremely rare, but if Dupers are still around when they're released there'll be hundreds of them within the first week.
---
I tried that and no one took the free stuff.  Wonder if that's bugged somehow.
---
Oh yes, the strongest 2 handed melee is definitely not the spear. What I meant to say is that i think the spear is the strongest 2 handed melee weapon with a "Medium" speed.
---
That's what brought me to Reddit lol. Don't have time for much else and I don't know anyone on here personally so it works for me I guess. Just didn't know Facebook was still a thing. I probably know two people that still use it now in my circle. But maybe they are lying lol.
---
Yup since last patch have had this problem is is highly annoying and has only gotten worse
---
One accepted meaning is "used to indicate possibility"  so it does not always mean can which usually means "are able to"
---
That's incredible.
---
Are 3 single HVY weapon cards better than 3 full heavy weapon cards...I get the space saving.
---
Yep so far I've had to do like 4 attempts in a row to actually tele.
---
Agreed, but I dont think there will ever be a day when duping ends for good. Even after they ban all the dupers it doesn't matter, the damage is done.
---
Codes reset on Mondays. But I have noticed a decrease in nukes since they nerfed the queen loot. It's rarely worth it to nuke unless you need some scrip fodder. Some fluxes are good. 
---
I try to launch a queen pretty regularly, but sometimes I'm just lazy lol
---
You using mods or uni edits? If so you need to fix your Custom ini file.
---
It breaks every major update
---
Yeah I'd say around that much time. I hopped into an active event hat was failed. I stuck around reading notes and killing robots for about 30 minutes before it started back up again
---
all junk, some caps and some of your aid.
---
I activate at least one pylon. It's pretty tough for one guy to handle all 3 and try to get hits in. Most people don't read directions so the event fails.
---
Definitely good drop
---
Have been in an easy half dozen nuke zones since Saturday, so I'm thinking you might just be unlucky with the servers you connect to.
---
I am assuming the high levels were checking out the new content and couldn't be bothered with another boring queen fight.
---
I've had stuff disappearing from my inventory for awhile now. Most recently was my FE combat rifle which I kept on me. Just poof...gone one day.
---
Haha nice. This one completely bodied all the assaultrons and sentry bots in the area. What a sight to see.
---
Good point
---
Im just using it as en example. Bethesda would hardly need to do any work to get those in.
---
You didnt disprove my point, if it isnt possible then you still couldn't
---
With nanotech? More likely power suit :)
---
Praise Atom!
---
I tried it but it was so laggy it was unplayable. Just turned in my scrips and sold out to the vendor and shut it down for the night.
---
It dropped but I had to sign off and go to work, been dying to play with it lol
---
Right on. I usually use a mic and have little to no issues, but I dont run it every day multiple times or anything, maybe once a week if i see it pop and im not in the middle of something.
---
Three cards gives you a 30% bonus, while nine gives you a 60% bonus. There are a lot of good cards in strength you have to give up to do that.
---
They already said vault raids are instanced and that they were working on the technology
---
I got formula p?  If anyone is on xbox and can make those stimpack diffusers for the badge I'd be very grateful!
---
Honestly it doesn't even look like 60 are growing in there.
---
What was it??
---
Stormy zone?
---
Thank you kind stranger
---
I would love a super sledge skin
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
im terrible at pvp, it makes me really scared and i just hate it. but, i will go to survival mode for a 3 star weapon, none of the challenges were really hard to accomplish and not everyone on survival is trying to kill you. I've run into people that were just trying to get the weapon as well and they didn't kill me and i didnt kill them, i lowered my weapon, waved and ran the opposite direction, they did the same. 
---
stash most of your aid, all of your junk and you'll be fine.
---
its a challenge, it's supposed to make you work for it.
---
FO76s main storyline doesn't even take a day to fully process if you know what you're doing. It's even blatantly spelled in your face, the holotapes basically explain the entire main storyline, just without the downtime of FO4's options of "Yes", "Sassy Yes", "Sarcastic Yes", and "Later".
---
While there are definitely side quests with interesting implications via the hollowtapes, notes, and newspaper clippings for FO76, the storytelling in general is shallow compared to the nuances of RDR2. Every character is memorable in RD. Some hollowtapes are extremely forgettable.
---
There are exceptions, though, I mention it a lot but I *really* like the story of the Vault Tec School where they barricaded it and started eating each other. Certain roles are voice acted really well in FO76. The issue there is the story clearly wasn't the main goal.
---
RDR is more like a cinematic, FO76 is more like a game.
---
Just low demand for the disc. So eager to get rid of them.
---
Maybe you could get more than 50 special stats to allocate? Or raise a Special stat above 15? Or give a non perk based damage boost to a weapon category of your choice? Idk
---
I‚Äôm in the US and have not gotten this email I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre in the us?
---
True. Thanks
---
Seems high? Thanks
---
Happens every single time on my Xbox One X, but hasn't happened once on my fat Xbox One... Which is a first, usually it's the other way around.
---
How does that work with no DR? I've always been curious of this build. Is it all perks that help you out or are you always a piece of glass
---
Maybe it depends on region. I live in rural America so a lot of people are still stuck in the past.
---
I‚Äôm getting a weird bug - reported it but just got endless Bethesda auto-responses (not exactly the Fallout 76 experience I wanted to relive IRL lol). I was completing Order of the Tadpole. I finished the toxic waste part of the quest and the revive a teammate part. But when I completed and turned in the bugs part of the quest to Scoutmaster Treadly, I lost all progress on the quest. I restarted my PS4 but when I reloaded, only the waste cleanup was still completed. I can‚Äôt re-complete the progress I lost so I just can‚Äôt continue with this quest. I‚Äôm not seeing anything else online so maybe it‚Äôs just my unlucky ass. Anybody else have this happen? I‚Äôm at the end of my rope here!
---
What fixed
---
You see it one way, I see it the other
---
ü§∑
---
Www.kinguin.net
---
Look up fallout 76.
---
Thank me later.
---
I think people downvote just to downvote.
---
The musician challenge
---
Just pulled one from the vendor let me see
---
They have no clue the dread of seeing a lesgemdary assaultron for a 10 mm user.
---
There goes the hour.
---
The mode just came out. Some people might be desperate for new plans. To determine that need is up to you. If you want to charge 25k no one is stopping you, but give it a couple of days and that plan will be everywhere.
---
I don't know I'm on an alt and haven't gotten the pioneer scouts quests yet
---
I'm pretty sure that's just what he says regardless, if you can do the possum challenges then you are a possum
---
Nevermind, I haven't noticed it on pc
---
I still don't understand the difference your complaining about?
---
Quite honestly I don't think you do either.. but by all means please help me to understand.
---
I have played the event and I have my own personal tame I don't see the difference in the two.
---
Or is it more of the matter you rather be rewarded for something that is a team event and not something you have to grind on your own for?
---
cool, let us to know‚Ä¶
---
btw, what was the time for the downgrade to happen? 
---
or it just happened when logging out?
---
I wouldn't doubt it, but I haven't checked. My camp is kind of out of the way for most people lol
---
That would be fun
---
Right? Like super hardcore. PA is rare af and fusions cores are insanely rare. Just a super hardcore mode.
---
If you like it then there is no reason to leave I suppose. I wasn't saying it was bad, just thought it was fading away popularity wise.
---
There's something there.  And I assume a nuke zone would be survival + ?
---
So shrouded can be applied to all wood armor? Does it stack that many times? I guess with super high agility shadowed is a bit redundant?
---
I don't really like it. I'm on it to keep in touch with people lol
---
Turned it on and the game told me "this account is logged in on another system" or something like that and immediately crashed. Loaded it back up and it gave me some message about save data being corrupted. Seemed jittery logging in but everything seemed fine once it loaded. PS4
---
That has nothing to do with fo76 or even crossplay in general, it's about expanding game streaming.
---
No. This is not fixed. 
---
The time frame was enough time for me to logout and log back in. Lol. It's now a 1*. I suscept this occurs immediately.
---
Agreed. One of the images in the year roadmap of new content looked like it contained a robot companion. I would also bet on human/ghoul/scorched NPCs filling a couple locations on the map in the future too
---
 Like 1 in 3-5 use mic.
---
No one rp‚Äôs.
---
It‚Äôs stupid well least I know it isn‚Äôt just me
---
Yes, it's happened to me for several times
---
That bitch is as bad as Fallout 4s enraged dog crawler (most powerful enemy in the game). There were only 2 of us against it and we did barely any damage. Broke my super sledge and my hunting rifle. Thankfully some guy turned up with a TSE gatling.
---
Just a link that‚Äôs why people are assuming that cross play is coming. I stated nothing!
---
I was hoping to find this, too!
---
lol that‚Äôs fkn weird
---
No, I told people to check your profile to provide proof that you were on console. That would prove to most frequenters of this subreddit that you were incorrectly accusing players of cheating who were really just minding their own business. If I had sent them to your profile and said that you were incorrect simply because you are on console and don‚Äôt know how games work, that could be a witch hunt.
---
Also, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you ‚Äúthink‚Äù  someone did if it can be proven without a doubt to be incorrect.
---
And just to clarify the proof works like this: it is impossible to get into the dev room on console since this requires running special programs, software, or scripts that canning be used on PS4 or Xbox 1 platforms, you are on console by your own admission and through past posts and comments (this is my concrete proof) confirming this. This is not a witch hunt, it‚Äôs me effectively and accurately disproving your accusations against another player with indisputable evidence.
---
I am well within my rights to oppose and provide proof of false accusations levied against another player. If you don‚Äôt want to be embarrassed, maybe you should research what you are accusing someone of before posting about it online.
---
Grow up and move on little fella, you lost this one. You‚Äôll get em next time tiger. Or maybe not, since you obviously don‚Äôt want to spend any time making sure your claims are correct.
---
Its the same for me too all i do is is crash evertime i do it.
---
Gotcha. I just text people lol. If I don't have their number then I guess we really aren't close friends. So I figured why see what they were eating that day or who they wanted for president. It just ate up too much of my time. I guess just like FO76 does now lmao
---
A nuke zone would have to be insane. Like you HAVE to have a rad suit and everything in there is like lvl 100+. Also unique enemies in there would be cool but that would never happen as it took 6 months for them to make 1 new enemy. Lol.
---
After you select the FT point, don't touch any other controls. It's like the workbench bug for me.
---
Been having the same problem after today's patch.
---
im on xbox so im not sure if it works for you but
---
you could just change characters, go to the recents tab and join his world without having to friend them.
---
God of videos.
---
It stacks. The high move speed while sneaking is one of the best selling points. I wouldn't say it's redundant, you just hide really well.
---
Yea freaked me out. I had played a bit after updating then logged in again later, so it wasn't immediately after updating either.
---
It‚Äôs a rare bug I‚Äôve seen this happen once before your really lucky my dude
---
Ahh, ok cool. He‚Äôs had me 2nd guessing. Yea I think I unlocked the possum challenges the first day.  Thanks.
---
https://imgur.com/a/61duPEH
---
That does sound pretty appealing. How does full shrouded compare to standard move speed/run speed.
---
Wh what about other players is it survival or adventure
---
Like it's running so much smoother after today's update. I think it's gotten worse as they add stuff. Sure its been getting better but in The next couple days someone will figure out the new dupe method and they will have to emergency shut down servers to fix and not focus on the lag and disconnects.
---
Ive tried to do it carefully, but it still happens. I do sometimes fat finger things but this is definitely buggy.
---
I‚Äôve been playing at least an hour a day (sometimes up to 10/12 though that‚Äôs very rare) for about a month and I‚Äôve only seen two drop.
---
What platform are you on.
---
Mines in the glasses caverns there two trying to help one floating away on a plank, my second fav is at one of the power plans and he has a spaghetti strainer on his head and a cigarette
---
so it is all platforms and not just consoles jeez hopefully whatever inevitable patch comes next doesn‚Äôt make things worse
---
Please do it!
---
I want the riot armor from FNV first. I want that NCR ranger look
---
Hey fallouts set before elder scrolls so you never know
---
I thought the same thing but that would be lore breaking af
---
"Now kids. Let everyone have a go at hitting the pinata"...
---
I get it sucks missing out on legendary loot but maybe rather than blame the person with the OP weapon to nerf themselves for the sake of those that can't react quicker, why not get Bethesda to balance their game by not making so you can one-shot everything?
---
So dope
---
And I can‚Äôt put a roof over one of my walls and can‚Äôt attach my floor to the stairs in that spot.  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I have edited this post to better explain how her your post history and platform can be used to disprove your allegations. I apologize for any miscommunication.
---
Yes, its ~~400~~ 360 Atoms v ~~500~~ 350 Atoms...but that's hardly a sale either if you think about it this way: 
---
There is no reason why both items are differently priced. If Light Wood was at a 30% discount **but** had a base price of 500 Atoms like Dark Wood), it's *just* 10 atoms different.
---
Same here. I played earlier today and did the event  twice. Got on later tonday and crashed 5 times trying to do the event. Tried all the above  and didn't fix the issue.
---
Yeah ive seen the ones in the glassed caverns, im gonna make a gallery of em all that ive found
---
Nukabears gotta catch em all
---
The really weird thing is that all three of my animals survived because hardly any enemies showed up to threaten them.
---
5mm is already very, very light. I‚Äôve never found bandolier useful. 
---
Then again I run a low health build with primarily an instigating gatling gun, 1.5k rounds lasts me a good long time.
---
I think you're the first person that's talking about legendaries that aren't at events.
---
The reason that it's an issue with events is that it is a guaranteed spawn, at a specific location, at a predictable stage that can draw a bunch of players. 
---
If you're having trouble outside of events with random people poaching legendaries you've randomly spawned in the field that's a different issue.
---
Nope. Weekly challenges
---
Platform?
---
Been on since December, only one in the wild months ago. I was marching thru the mountains somewhere and started taking damage, spun and didnt see anything so i thought it was like the ghouls in WS when you fast travel in sometimes. Swung my ax and connected and see the blur and the something mothman and some rays or something. Pretty exciting. I won. Sometimes i feel bad for the creatures that come charging at me he'll bent on dying.
---
Yeah it gets me everytime I do that quest too, and every time I interject and tell him I'm a big boy üòÇ
---
I'll try taking them alive. So far with the Ash Heap the wolf and mole rat didn't count
---
My solution to this problem is to switch on pacifist mode and start chucking molotovs everywhere. Works best with a fully ranked grenadier card so you can just carpet bomb the whole area and be sure to get some damage in on everything.
---
Would be nice if they changed it so the loot spawned for everybody though. It sucks losing legendaries because the enemy fell off a cliff or something.
---
Might I ask what gives you the "petting zoo" feeling from what I said? You can already tame creatures, so I'm not sure what your referring too? Sorry if this sounds rude, that's not my intent, I'm just genuinely curious.
---
Bethesda is hardly a behemoth by any metric. Most AAA companies have thousands of employees, Ubisoft as a collective for example has a staff of Fourteen THOUSAND, Take two nearly 5000. Zenimax has 1500. Bethesda Game studios is dwarfed in size by nearly every other developer trying to make games on their scale, not the other way around.
---
No
---
Side question. Did the 4* give more scrip than the 3*?
---
It'd would need to be something worth the hassle of going from 1 to 50 again. I was thinking maybe you get an extra SPECIAL point per time. Eventually it's possible people would get 15 in all 7, but it would take so long it might no imbalance things to much. Either that or in addition to it some unique perk cards. Honestly I'm not sure what else they could add to make it worth it.
---
I found this by accident and kept it a secret for a while, just felt like sharing it to the community today. Don't know if this is a bug or not, but it looks like it's a feature in the game.
---
Always around big town!
---
Worked for me tonight on XB1.
---
I don't know about Many A True Nerd... I mean he makes this hour long video of everything he doesn't like about 76, but he was constantly contradicting his own points between one segment to the next. And after survival mode he made another video which was basically just a laundry list of complaints that literally everyone else was saying... Then after Bethesda updated survival mode with a bunch of the suggestions he made another video basically taking credit for causing the changes . He definitely isn't as bad as some of the other guys out there, but he definitely has an ego problem.
---
Hey thanks man I'll be on in a few hours üëå
---
What PA set?
---
I want a survival mode where we have no legendary weapons or armor. Everything you want has to be picked up or crafted. Players are always hostile and rad storms are more prevalent and harsher which require PA or some other radiation protection. There is no way to make caps other than scrounging and selling to vendors but workshops provide 4x the resources to make them more desirable.
---
It still bugs me that in 1st person view you hold a hammer in 2 hands, but in 3rd it‚Äôs clearly one hand.
---
Started with the patch two weeks ago.  They let you fast travel with enemies nearby, but it seems like the timer is triggered even when they aren‚Äôt.  That‚Äôs my guess, at least.
---
NOPE!
---
Yes, I mean character.
---
If they released your idea, In something multiplayer like this, in about 2 days just about everyone would already have 50 pets running around there camp and it would destroy the immersion of a wasteland. Im just giving my opinion bro no worries
---
Only if it is not casual underarmor.
---
I‚Äôve run into your last line there. I play every day for a little while but it‚Äôs grinding out the 10 commendations from MODUS. I‚Äôll play an event and then go to Whitesprings only to find that the few players online at 7am EST have already slaughtered everything there so unless I want to play for 10 minutes and then hop servers before another 10 minute sprint, I‚Äôm pretty well shit out of luck. 
---
I still have most of the DLC quests to do but I feel limited in them also since I get two days every other week to be on when there‚Äôs people around and I‚Äôm not sure that I rank highly enough to complete the Sheepsquatch or Burrows quests at level 45.
---
Agreed
---
They have a twisted sense of priorities, right? 
---
OMG! You can build topiaries without buying them from the atom store. Shut it down!
---
Bulk junk auto scrap bug still existing over multiple patches, can't finish some challenge, still no fast travel mats requested since near the start of the game - eh.
---
It seems that with Berserker‚Äôs builds, you are mostly just a piece of glass. You can get ER and RR and some percentage-based damage mitigation perks but nothing comes close to wearing armor.
---
I have beaten the quest with me and one other person and all 3 creatures survived.  The key is putting as much food in the trough as possible to get the best defender.
---
I genuinely like the game. I didn‚Äôt at first but it really did grow on me. I‚Äôll probably finish out what I can do and then give ESO a shot until the fall DLC comes out. This goes double if Nuclear Winter is some battle royale nonsense.
---
Also, what platform?
---
Yeah :D you can't escape that haunted place!
---
They need to rebalance the game, being able to 1 shot legendary enemies just shouldn't be a thing. 
---
The game has been out long enough to understand the different builds and weapons, and make adjustments to have more builds be viable while having the game be enjoyable to play in groups. Its a group game. 
---
The issue of tagging an enemy shouldn't happen because the game should make and sense and balanced for groups to take on the group activities together and it be interesting + rewarding!
---
It works well with the weird unstoppables top hat thing, cant remeber the name.
---
Same here....
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you tadpole!!‚Äù
---
*Removes the pin with teeth from a pumpkin grenade and shoves it up his metal arse*
---
Inventory and Stash limits are much much higher than burnt books. Personally, that's my number 1.
---
lol!
---
There was a application released on Nexus Mods today that creates this for you based on what is in your data folder. Super nice. It can also amend already created fallout76custom.ini's

damn, that's really bad news. 
---
I will keep waiting to redeem my scripts in a couple of level 20 characters, I guess. 
---
High chances to get Wood armor at low levels because some armor types are not in the pool yet.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
I'd love some kind of BoS paint job for my Gatling Laser.

I'm level 270, and I don't use my most powerful gear at these kinds of events. Having said that, low level enemies can be very squishy for someone fully spec'd into their weapon of choice.  You don't need a TSE to kill them really quick if you are spec'd right. A one-star anti-armor weapon can do it, maybe not one shot, but two or three at the most.
---
It's cool, no worries. But I gotta say, I did mention you would only be able to have one pet, which was to keep people from doing exactly what you mentioned. Otherwise if had a bunch of pets it would be a total "lag-fest"
---
Oh so THAT'S where the stimpak diffuser comes from for the Scout quest? Damn...
---
I play every other Monday and Wednesday nights about that time. I‚Äôm only a level 45. Send me a PM if you would like my PSN.
---
I wouldn't want half my family to have my phone number lol
---
He complained because his song was associated to an immoral and violent game.
---
Pretty funny when you know that this song is about treating women as sexual objects and nothing more.
---
Fucking amazing!
---
I think the bears are going just fine. I still get worried when I see yogis
---
the free states vendor is inside the white springs resort, not near or outside right?
---
It seems to happen right after the nuke clears up. You can still get some good caps from collectors for stuff like that and it‚Äôs good for leveling up a new character.
---
There's one outside whitespring with glasses, gun, and hat.
---
Indeed im selling them now..
---
Pretty heavy cost
---
For 3 your chucking a super stim away
---
Yeah and whatever level your character is that's the level piece you get now. That they said they did fix in this patch lol
---
&gt;I...would disagree strongly that this game is better than 4.
---
No one is better than the other. They're both different games prodiving a different experience.
---
It's cool, no worries. But I gotta mention that I did say that you would only be able to own one pet. As I figured people would do exactly like you said, and start hoarding tons of pets.
---
I think they admitted to not having the technology to run instanced servers.
---
I can see how it could work but you have to be super sneaky in agility right and perk out in other non PA perks. How would that be better than unyileding
---
Y'all got any more of them violet flux?
---
Inside, in the spa section on the row is shops downstairs.
---
Yeah, you can also just use their account name to join their server.
---
You joke, but I finally bought Atoms when the Light Wood Laminate came out. They had just removed the mosaic tile floor from the store and I swore I wouldn't miss out on flooring again! We all have our priorities.
---
But they have you on Facebook which is way worse lol. And they see everything you post. I agree
---
What sort of edge do you think you gain by being condescending at the end?  Frankly, you sound like a douche.  It is unwarranted and unfunny.
---
At the end of the day, this is still a video game.  Would you like a pat on the back because you proved me wrong about something in a video game?  Sorry I do not know every single bug this game has to offer because that is not my priority.
---
I am short on atoms (sub 1500) so I try to do them all in case atom shop has some good stuff each week.  Little annoyed this week Bc I blew a lot during the nukashine pa paint week and now I see 3 items I want!
---
Seems each day 1/5 is nigh impossible, level up requires paying attention, and camera vary a bit.  Don‚Äôt seem to get the easy stuff anymore, but I imagine something came from on high about easy atoms.
---
Yeap. I think I'll be buying them from a camp vendor... \[PC\]
---
I was referring to the expectations and weight that the name Bethesda carries. When a company that owns such powerful IPs as Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Starfield, Doom, and Wolfenstein you have to expect more that a buggy mess and the promise that it will all be fixed later. You are talking about some of the biggest games of all time. Now, we get a cheap mod for Fallout 4, that could have merit if not for the countless bugs and glitches that have been known for months.
---
Now imagine the same scenario, but instead of ghouls or robots, there are Liberators... and they drop glowing meat along with similarly confounding ilk.
---
Confirmed that crouching works. The trick is to have your gun out so you can tell when you're "standing" then immediatley stop and crouch.
---
Ignore him and let him clean up his own toxic goo 5 miles away.  Not like leaving toxic good in Toxic Valley is going to lower property values.  What does he want?  For the place just to be called ‚Äúthe valley‚Äù?  What‚Äôs next, picking up ash in the ash heap so we can just call it the green hills?
---
Fingers crossed brother.
---
I really wish this weren‚Äôt the case. I prefer solo play and don‚Äôt really know how to initiate teams. It really leaves people out because of it.
---
wavy willards waterpark
---
Ps4 or we could work something out xd
---
Then why are you here? To farm downvotes?
---
Lol. Instances are coming with the Vault raids. Todd and the 76 team talked about it a few weeks ago at the Bethesda show.
---
Thats badass! If i were to stumble upon this i would geek out. Imagine two other camps with this blueprint in the background.
---
Yea, that‚Äôs the other thing....they‚Äôre all ‚ÄúDiseased Protectrons‚Äù. Diseased. Robots. Dropping meat. Lol.
---
NCR ranger outfit but it‚Äôs Responders... would that work?
---
They are everywhere. You find broken cameras that can be repaired. Maybe it's just because I have one but I have seen a dozen or more in the last week.
---
havent seen a true PSA on here in a minute, props.
---
I found taking workshops a lot helps.  You eventually get a cycle of defense (never defend) and retake (do it then), and it doesn‚Äôt seem people mess with forest area shops much .
---
Some raids with hard tactic, that need proggresion.
---
But this is bethesda, they will reskin some shit, give it insane damage and make it bulletsponge, abraka dabraka "boss".....
---
It was pre-war riot armor and as we see there were large scale strikes going on before the war. I could see local police being issued them in case things got violent.
---
It's a decent price for that gun... The reduced weight is good to have on a heavy weapon like that... And two shot goes a long way on a weapon that already has high DPS as is. The bash damage is useless though.
---
So it's their fault that you made a dumb assumption that players are cheating because the location it will default show players is the center of the map? Quit your bullshit buddy. They don't need to fix something because you lack common sense.
---
You **could** just stop assuming the worst about others, stop wasting Bethesda's time, mind your own business, and just play the game. You know, like everyone else who has a life? üòã
---
Berserker build is pretty much a poor man's bloodied with far worse upsides and greater downsides. Having zero DR/ER is probably just as good as having 20hp except you dont get any real compensation.
---
Every time since last week's patch. I just farm them to get steel and scrip.
---
More points would work for me I get the feeling that if they made it unique perk cards they‚Äôd make them high cost and medium reward honestly I could go for a permanent buff each time you do it like 10% to a weapon types damage extra ap stuff like that not too much but enough to make a difference
---
Not if it doesn't have the flag on it or if it has a US one instead
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt think it would give me any edge. I am just done being civil with someone who would rather falsely accuse others of something than look at their own ineptness on the subject. 
---
This being a video game doesn‚Äôt excuse the fact that you targeted and harassed other players simply because you thought you knew something that you obviously had no clue about. And no, I don‚Äôt want a pat on the back, I want players like you to stop making false accusations that only surge to divide the community.
---
Also, a word of advise, if you don‚Äôt know every bug, or exploit this game has to offer, maybe you should just mind your own fucking business and let others enjoy the game in the way they see fit.
---
Feel free to show up to free ranges. It's not bad at all to have a lower level player be the one pushing the cows.
---
I think private servers will come on down the line.
---
I think its talking about the drugs they used on the animals .
---
its Broken for me too :(
---
Lol I made a post about that too
---
Drop it on the ground during a SBQ or ISS fight.  Someone will be wearing it 10s later and you‚Äôll know who‚Äôs a bag thief!
---
Oh wait I misunderstood
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get it. I was the only one on one of the troughs and there were about 4 each on the other ones. I managed to get mine up to level 2, the others had like 1-5 of the required items deposited. It seems fairly straight forward but I guess not?
---
So that‚Äôs a yes... 
---
I will take one in Responders colors, blue white red highlights or Firebreathers red!
---
Right yeah, I'm asking about player effects
---
This is what I pictured Nuclear Winter to be üò≠
---
Thanks for the heads up. I‚Äôm sort of a hoarder with the cool outfits so I‚Äôll probably save them. I have close to 25000 caps anyway from playing for so long. Hopefully they put the armor stands in some day so we can show our spoils off.
---
wtf... you can? I've been paying since beta and never knew. I only started using vats to target mostly at night because my vision is bad tho I don't think I've ever intentionally used vats while playing melee.
---
Exactly lol
---
All right, thank you! I‚Äôll try giving it a shot.
---
We don't talk about those games, for reasons.
---
Dark times.
---
Oh so this happen I log in and my house is in a nuke zone and I lost my house. Doesn‚Äôt even ask it I want to change sever to save my house. Just great I can‚Äôt even do the event and now my house which I had since lv 50 now @ lv 123 get taken out by stupid event that won‚Äôt work right. Pop in a nuke zone.
---
It occurred to me that the way they can handle this is to allow tracking of inactive events in your pipboy data tab the same way that you track quests and can choose to untrack events you are in.  That way when the event becomes active the standard event notice will pop up in your hud wherever you are on the map, and it avoids potentially notifying people that don't care about some events.
---
dope asf doing this when i get online tonight
---
Yeah that seems like a bad trade off. Why not get the benefits from the unyileding armor is my biggest question. I'm at a stand still in my play so I was curious to try it out but I don't see the benefit to going from bloody to berserker. But it's always interested me. I think the gameplay aspect is much more skilled with berserker but it's hard to delineate the difference other than one can take a little damage and the other none at all
---
I beta‚Äôd WoW and it was less buggy on release/more playable (aside from servers getting overwhelmed) and they didn‚Äôt have the kind of server tech that exists today. BGS could have the same quality of GW2 with their rolling instance patching, etc... stuff that just want around then.
---
Wow‚Äôs has an advantage in setting up raid puzzles do to the 3rd person, positioning oriented combat.
---
He‚Äôs comparing mustangs and corvettes, but you‚Äôre comparing mustangs and model t‚Äôs.
---
I am on PC. I have one for sale. Won't cost any more than doing the quest. RB1955. Camp is up north by the observatory. Will be on about 3am and then again by noon. At work right now.
---
whats a clean spacsuit worth?
---
i have a couple i want to sell but duno what to set the price at..
---
That was where the developer room was located.
---
And you probably are not the most qualified person to tell others to get a life.  You got extremely emotional about this whole situation.
---
I agree completely. this is easily one of my all time favorite games of my life. I have probably close to 1,000 hours now but goodness sake can we have content released that isn't broken for once.
---
This one is actually fun. Easier than encrypted or sbq. And i actuallly walk away with 3*s. It does get chaotic tho if everybody runs around like headless chickens pulling enemies from one section into another.
---
ok
---
What false promises they made that people keep saying, but don't show mo proof. Not only that, you've a problem with them banning accounts
---
I fought him about a month or two ago outside Harpers Ferry during a nuke. He was a glowing Behemoth.
---
It's not just him.
---
I think berserker as it is is a good build archetype but the risk/rewards need to be adjusted. They either need to increase the dmg boost to like 100% or add 2x or more sneak modifier. Either that or make sneak much harder to cap; thus, requiring no armor which is the whole point of berserker. 
---
The prefix should be more geared towards sneak build.
---
What is also annoying is when your a high level bloodied build thats trying to tank hits so the lower lvls get to tag it, but then they take their sweet time tagging all other mobs instead of the legendary. 
---
So, as a lvl 260+ that spawned that lvl 68 3* legendary for you, if you dont tag it as soon as you spot it, i sure as hell aint going to take the risk of dying and losing out on a legendary drop for you and i will one shot the thing if you fail to do your part as i have done mine by giving you the opportunity to tag it.
---
I should be on a couple hours around lunch! Lvl 80, but still with shit guns. SineCera
---
What sorcery is this
---
Jeeeez.  This sound like fun. NOT.  With crap drops on this event crap drops at Legendary Vendor (she thinks I like pistols and pipe weapons for some reason)  Wes Tek is the only place to hopefully find decent drops.
---
I think a separate "hardcore mode" would be nice. Survival would be a better name, but thats already taken by their pvp server. As it stands right now, high level players really have to restrict themselves to have any kind of a challenge in this game. Running around with a .44 and no damage perks is nice and all, but it would be nicer if there weren't 50 stimpaks around every corner
---
This worked for me too
---
Just fyi, what you are describing sounds almost exactly like the frost mod for fallout 4 if you haven't tried that yet
---
No, it really isn't.
---
No problem! Nothing like free atoms!
---
Your welcome :)
---
You forgot the real #1.. the guy who got there before you did and took everything (even the burnt books).
---
Super sledge still out performs it with dps and the sledge isn't the best either.
---
No, I mean you still don't fucking get it.. fuck, what is wrong with you? That **isn't where the developer room is**, that's your default location when the game can't assign you one. Do you literally think there's a fucking room right in the exact center of the fucking map?
---
Jesus, I wonder how many morons have been reporting players because they're completely fucking clueless. Like, is this fucking ticket science bro?
---
I tap them once and then stop shooting.  
---
No reason to be a dick about the loot.
---
[Gonna go ahead and give you this since you keep replying but definitely don't care at all.](https://www.homedepot.com/s/shovel?NCNI-5)
---
Yes, At the same location which this image appears to have been taken.
---
I love it when these guys spawn there.  Not the biggest fan of the yogi bears because they seem to kill me faster than these do.
---
I have two broken cameras at the moment. I can give you one of you want it. 
---
You'll still need to find the tourist to get the sight seeing quest for the 2x lens but it would mean you can complete your daily camera challenges and don't have to continue searching and can just stumble on the tourist organically. 
---
I'm at work so can't help for about 6 hours but the offer is there if you want it. PSN is fakenunchucks. Pop a note in the friend request saying you're from here. 
---
Safe travels wastelander!
---
Or instead it's eyebots. Legendary eyebots. Have fun with your level 1 legendary gear.
---
I'm on xbox and want to launch one badly near pumpkin house to farm much needed cobalt.  Never dropped one before but i do have keycards
---
Hit me up if you can help!
---
GT: whoafrenchtoast
---
oh wowwwwwwwww.
---
Dosent matter. They are all dead.
---
If on xbox I'll help you get one. Wont be on until after midnight pst
---
Is that the deal? I noticed that not all of my photos counted, but I thought it was just random.  
---
Damn, I've been trying to get good shots of live critters... kinda roleplaying a daring wildlife photographer. Sucks if only dead shots count.
---
yep!!!
---
That's fantastic!
---
Maybe you have a point, maybe you don't. Either way i don't get it, what do you actually expect from this besides the usual BS from others? 
---
No I'm not trying to be a dick here,but you honestly think this is really going to lead anywhere? These types of complaints are a dime a dozen here, not once have i ever seen Bethesda acknowledge any of them and i doubt they ever will. 
---
Save yourself some time and grief, just enjoy the damn game or move on. It's not worth all this extra effort. Your time will be served much better doing something else than complaining into the abyss.
---
Good Lord... I hope no one is buying them haha. I sell 1* equipment for 100caps
---
Now that I haven't seen... but would love to. Sounds highly amusing.
---
Having the same problem, reloaded 3 times, got all keycards again and still room is blocked by invisible barrier :( (on Xbox)
---
For me its the lackluster dlc. Burrows and the new event are meh. Scouting is fetch grinds. Nuclear winter looks like it‚Äôs battle royale. I just want fallout stories and new characters. Maybe wastelanders has a few idk. But why would i buy anything for a game I enjoyed ‚Äúbeating‚Äù already? Give me some dungeons and move the actual story along and we‚Äôll talk.
---
You make great points. Your English is also great.
---
It's pretty random but I've had better luck with dead ones over live ones. It'd be nice if all we needed was a "picture" instead of using lots of ammo to put the animal down just to take a picture and if it would be consistent.
---
Oh man I hope this wasn't the same guy who launched a nuke at prime on my server ten seconds before they posted the 8 minutes to server maintenance timer.
---
Depending on what the effect is I sell 1*s for a max of 700
---
Imposter sheepsquatch is very easy for me now, as long as others activate the pylons. I just dtand in front of it, letting it hit me as I shoot it with my vampires cryolator to slow it down. My full set of Troubleshooter's armor (2 being sentinel) makes me almost damage proof to it.
---
If a mob is aggro'd towards another mob or player you don't get sneak bonuses.
---
Do you actually know what it means to target and harass other players?  I ask this in all seriousness because I did not do that.  I reported a few players who were in the location where the developer room is.  Or was.  After that, I left it at that.  I did not further pursue the players by messaging or actually harassing the players nor did I reveal their usernames.  In fact, I do not remember them because I am not pathetic enough to keep a list.
---
Funnily enough, it is players like you that ruin the community.  You get so unhinged and swear the oath of the keyboard warrior to make it your goal to embarrass others on a video game subreddit all because of a little mistake.  I wish I felt pity for you.
---
And there it is.  The unhinging.  Damn I love it.  That is what I mean by representing the community in an immature way.  Pull out the profanities when all else fails.  All you had to do was just say that players appearing in that location is a result from a bug and accessing the developer room on console is impossible.  Just that.  Plain and simple like a civil person.
---
Pay attention to who does that shit and block them forever so they end up in a solitary hell of their own design.
---
It depends on what it is. Also sometimes you just need to get rid of caps, so paying a few k for scrip is a good method.
---
I was gonna write 8 paragraphs on why I won‚Äôt read this absurd article yelling at the sky, and then realized I should probably just not read it and spare others an overworked manifesto of my reasoning.
---
Not only that but they left it in for a week straight and then allowed those of us who used the topiary already to keep them. Some of these comments are fairly dramatic.
---
Depends on the gear my friend. 1K for a nocturnal leather left leg is kind of insane. But for a max level furious LMG or Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, that's not out of the ballpark for the going rate. I think 8-900 is better but 1,000's not _that_ outrageous.
---
What if I run around in a full set of Cavaliers armor and take pot shots?
---
I bought combat armor dense torso plans from Phoenix in Watoga 3 days ago. Dropped by there more or less by mistake, he had them. Didn't next time I dropped by. So I guess some Vendor inventory is still random at the vendors.
---
My rule is: 500 caps per legendary with bonus caps based on the effect. Furious, bloodied and explosive all give +200c
---
I'm selling many 1* weapons like Anti Armor / Instigating / TwoShot / Bloodied / Furious for 1k. It's an easy sell depending on the weapon.
---
Those affixes on most two handed heavy melee / shotguns / good rifles / MGS and heavy guns honestly sell fast
---
This makes me think of tomacco lol
---
This is roughly what I would do. But you can pop the heavy guns down to rank 2 and you can get another level 3 perk card in there.

---
never got a chance to enjoy that freedom lol. that‚Äôs so true if we don‚Äôt have to worry about weight and caps limit etc and now the scrip limit. It‚Äôs more of an RPG game than action game now, especially with all the latest vending and gambling features.
---
Oh. That sucks. Realistically that's when a sneak attack would be the most surprising lol.

I think that would be a nice way for Salt to be useful.  
---
At the moment, I just drop Salt and Pepper on the ground like they are worthless.
---
I think you just speak it into existence on r/fo76
---
Do you happen to have a link where I could find out what the rare drops are? I‚Äôve searched high and low and can‚Äôt seem to find a list of rare drops. I have a two BOS under armor pieces and had no clue they were rare.
---
raider content and glowing sea content
---
I will be home within the hour if you need help.
---
I think the build gets busted by bloody for sure hence my intrigue. Not sure why anyone would try it other than cheaper weapons.
---
???? You are selling your xbox?
---
Ugh yeah, hate it when that happens man.
---
Mine is complete. Just did it.
---
Are you at the correct dome? They have numbers in them.
---
Worked for me today. On PC.
---
Those were rhetorical questions, no one ever had to purchase or redeem these from the shop.  People just realized one day that they were unlocked automatically and then everyone started using them.
---
Most newer players don‚Äôt know the huge performance gain they can get from the right one-star instead of a trash three star, partially because they don‚Äôt know the right perks to boost them yet. A one-star bloodied melee weapon can one-shot most creatures if not all if you build around it. A three star nocturnal with bash damage won‚Äôt get them very far.
---
Are you crafting the jar or the habitat?
---
Not that I remember. Maybe by like one scrip but that's it.
---
and the spaceshipguy likes it :) . thats surely one of the bigger ones! thumps up
---
You can get excavator mods from the lower level vendors in and around the Asheap. You can also buy the plan, but it will require 5 Violet Flux to craft.
---
for me i sell trash 1 stars for the "recommended value" inbetween 2 to 70ish caps
---
The jar. Thought it was the same thing.
---
Watch, this will be patched tomorrow morning. The other major bugs tho? Nah
---
Nope. It‚Äôs in floor decor in the camp build menu. It‚Äôs a frog in the jar.
---
I guess that is better than 'we do not intend to do anything about it.'
---
Fallout 76 was justifiably criticized and unjustly ahit upon.  The game has a charm of its own the empty world feels appropriate and the atmospheric story telling is top notch.  If the only story line you ever played in the game was the mistress of mystery it would honestly be enough.  I put a little over 100 hours into the game at launch and have since moved on mostly with the few attempt to return just not bringing enough enjoyment to want to stay not because I dont enjoy the game but because I havent felt challenged by the game at all in my entire play through and god mode is only fun for so long.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be. And yes, I would pair Agility/sneak with Berserker‚Äôs. I‚Äôm on a strict, static QoL roleplayer‚Äôs build, not Berserker‚Äôs, so I‚Äôm not speaking from experience. I use Berserker‚Äôs weapons because I don‚Äôt want to wear armor because armor gets sweaty and disgusting and uncomfortable to live in 24/7. So with no damage or defense perks, I‚Äôve got it even tougher than Berserker‚Äôs builds, but I survive, and it‚Äôs largely thanks to sneaking and positioning.
---
Same here lol
---
I just absolutely love how unhinged you are over a video game.  People like you are what embarrass this community because you cannot stay civil.  You act as if this stuff is common knowledge but I guarantee the average player does not know.
---
I also love all the unnecessary profanity.  You certainly are an emotional individual.  You have been quite disrespectful in all of your responses.  Perhaps you should take a break from the internet.  I actually almost pity you, I cannot imagine being so angry at a person over a video game.
---
Right!? üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt know about transparency, i just hope i can get some nice skins for all the weapons i use, but that seems to be the one most difficult item for them to make. For everything else there‚Äôs a pretty good variety to choose from.
---
you can buy the plans from vendors. since it is excavator its any of the non train station responder vendors, or the responder vendor at the white springs
---
no it only effects the condition of the items you pick up is all as far as loot goes
---
Luck doesn't effect legendary spawn rate. It's all RNG based.
---
Duh. Thanks man!!!! It worked!!!
---
For scrip fodder I usually do 250 a star. That's 750 for 40 scrip. Not a bad deal, but also they don't really sell so I think a lot of folks are still dumping their old stored stuff. And then also the stuff they got from the legend vendor. üòÇ
---
What is the purpose of this? What is Aric? I‚Äôve only managed to actually log into the event once and it was in the final stages. 
---
Other times it‚Äôs a 5 minute load screen, 3 minutes of trying to heal through invisible enemies, 4 seconds of ‚Äúevent failed‚Äù showing on my screen.
---
What system?
---
Thanks, thats okay. I do not wanted more anyway :)
---
Xbox
---
So why are you just dropping stuff? That's just as bad as dropping power armor frames to get into them.
---
You can trade gear for free.
---
Lol why are you giving them more chances?
---
it was...
---
You mean level 1 eyebots? Robots protectron won‚Äôt drop 1* stuff, usually 35-40 items. This happens a lot after nuke.
---
What is the aric-4?
---
I like you gt -)) what's your platform?
---
for the best photographs, have them look directly at your nose
---
Devil girl hat/mask is great too
---
Lol, or the razor grain flour....

Does NOT work for me.

Cleared cache (10 second power button held down) then disconnected the power from the xbox.

Get back into game, get into the elevator - crash to desktop (home screen)

My religious aunt gets to see my posts about satanism and abortions. Win/Win in my book

Nah, level 50 and up bots. I got 16 vampire drops in one run of the pro shop. It‚Äôs almost like they were supposed to be ghouls and something glitched because they all had ‚Äúdiseased‚Äù in their name.

I would love to see more Camp options for walls, floors, decor, etc. Ultimately, I‚Äôll be happy if/when we can place junk from our inventory. I have a bunch of clean items in my stash waiting for that day. It would also be nice to have something more to do when you‚Äôre idle in your camp.

Also... I really wish we could buy the Persian rug that I keep seeing around the wasteland.

Combat shotguns don't really benefit from automatic, they take a hit to damage but still don't shoot faster than you can click

They were actually connected to the new player terminal that was free.
---
Testing the waters also try to get some attention to try to fix my lost character or something equal
---
I got the recipe for it just now so I‚Äôll let you know
---
Me and some friends set up a small discord that has  around 8-12 players now, and we do events together all the time. 
---
If we want to do free-range, we 2/3 people will Server hop to find the event, then everyone joins their server and we do it as a group. 
---
We did free range earlier for example and one guy who was there crapped his pants when he saw 12 high level players (Level 100+) running to help his event. 
---
He calmed down when he realised we just liked the raider look and were not going to butcher him, and we did the event together. 
---
I get this game needs a hub or a LFG system, but honestly finding a small group you can play with and do things you enjoy (like a Clan/Guild) will always beat LFGs with randoms.
---
Outstanding!
---
There‚Äôs a whole subreddit of pictures of found bears. I can‚Äôt remember the name of it, though...
---
After all these Bug fixes they need to do, I would really like them to sit down and fix the Weapon Mod system. Way too many weapons straight up dont have any mods or just a single one.
---
do you plan on using VATS or no?
---
+5 charisma, +3 luck, and improves gun accuracy for 5 min
---
Thats your choice...but since you wanna act like you know everything i feel i should point out that most of what youre saying isnt BGS but BSW... Surely you don't actually think BGS had anything to do with which material was used in a bag or think BGS themselves are the people banning players??? 
---
I highly doubt BGS even wrote the terms of service or EULA... BGS overall has never had a problem with mods (tho with an online game it SHOULD have different rules)  and if you do anything that goes against the EULA youre subject to bans or suspension
---
Im all for critical opinions but lets place blame in the right area and remember that there are LOTS of different groups all working under the Bethesda name and use are heads and realize that marketing, support, publishing and developing are ALL different divisions regardless if they all say Bethesda
---
Same happened to me. So I tried to blueprint it. Couldn't blueprint the whole house. So I did it in 3 parts. Then I couldn't attach the 3 together. Had to rebuild a second time. Only now the base seems to blueprint like it did before. Hope it stays that way. The 50 part jigsaw puzzle camp sucks.
---
Take the initiative
---
Not sure to be honest. Seeing as it's real time, I'd prefer to use it only when absolutely necessary.
---
I found the same thing.  I thought it was attaching from the other end of the connection that worked, but being still as possible seems to most reliable technique.
---
Dead inside physically or both. Any way it could be like a single player experience
---
It doesnt
---
How else could I tell Mule1 from Mule2 and Mule3 and Mule4??
---
Its a buyers market, prices will keep going down. Also, my prices all depend on my need for caps. Ive sold explosive stuff for like 300-400 if i want to push inventory to buy a mutation recipe.
---
Would normally say "khajit has wares" but running out of plans to sell which is my fun thung to sell.
---
You can move your CAMP thing only and that'll change where people spawn. I moved mine way over by the edge of my green circle, and people spawn outside of my camp instead of inside my floor now! Hope this helps!
---
I was seeing quite a few nukes last week, PC.
---
Things I'd actually spend $ to get Atoms for?? what?? Are you crazy?? :)
---
Have seen the one at bog town several times.
---
I loaded into the event after it had started and the entire time there was no quest tracker or markers. I selected/deselected the event in my pipboy but nothing was ever visible.
---
So if other people are having the same issue I did then that might explain some of the clueless running about.
---
Frog habitat still bugged for me.  I was finally able to get pic of generator but yeah had to keep trying.  Music instruments also didn't register playing for me.  I DID get 1 deathclaw hide...in a random container so yeah.  That sucks.  Love you gotta be a conduit 60 friggin times in a quest that costs almost 2K a pop.  Awesome.  Also at level 160 and STILL haven't gotten plasma grenade plans. Awesomer.
---
We had fridges in fallout 3 I‚Äôve never liked how we couldn‚Äôt really store things in fridges like in fallout 4
---
Everyone's RNG is different I guess, I've probably gotten badges 80% of the time, I got the upgraded carrying capacity backback from this event alone having done zero of the achievement badges for possum.
---
It will get you close, but royal jelly is so small. It'd be good to know of where is spawns in each location.
---
Now I wanna make a crashed one! DAMN YOU!
---
Glad I'm not the only one..
---
Ahhh yes, the good ol' days. Worked fine at launch, been working incorrectly for months.
---
Not just you.  I got killed several times by invisible.. I don't know whats.  I server hopped and that seemed to work.

here is a basic PVE Sneak rifleman build, you can swap out the carry reduction perks if you don't feel like using them. currently rifles lack any weight reduction perks, unlike Big Guns with Bear Arms
---
Oh never mind, you're another two year old alt/throw away, conversation is meaningless. Glad I save myself actually putting effort into my response
---
You went out of your way to investigate and report players who had no impact on your own gameplay. By most that is considered harassment. And harassment doesn‚Äôt have to be repeated. One act is enough to be considered harassment. I didn‚Äôt accuse you of repeated harassment, just this one instance. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why you think I‚Äôm unhinged. I have been calm and very clear in my intent and purpose. And I‚Äôm not a keyboard warrior, I didn‚Äôt seek out this conversation, I just stumbled upon someone who was clearly ignorant about the accusations they were making. 
---
And I don‚Äôt need your pity. I‚Äôm going to go home, see my wife, eat dinner, and boot up the game just like I do every night. I am more than happy without one iota of your pity. 
---
I hate to break it to you, but profanity is just a series of adjectives that have negative connotations. It‚Äôs just colorful language. Reddit has a user agreement that allows this language. If you don‚Äôt like it, maybe you should use the official forums instead.
---
And me and the other user tried to say that this could have just been a bug, the other user even linked you directly to a post supporting it, but you decided to ignore it and now you want to throw it back into the debate. I‚Äôm sorry but I won‚Äôt allow you to use this poor excuse for a defense when all you have to do is scroll up to where this conversation started to prove that YOU are he one who chose to ignore your very suggestion. And I brought up the fact that it was impossible to access the dev room on console as soon as you confirmed that you played on PS4. 
---
If you wish to keep debating this, please at least use common sense and remember what has already been said so that you don‚Äôt stagnate the conversation.

P.S. I went back through this comment before posting to make sure it would suite your liking. Please let me know if this is to harsh of a criticism for you to handle so that I can recalibrate me future comments to your liking.

Works for me earlier today
---
I'm not trying to compete with the supersledge with dps. Hold your horses there bud, just a player here that wants to use spears and have his perks work as it should be
---
They gave it to you already. By not removing it from your camp. Just because you had access to it for free temporarily doesn't mean it should be free forever.
---
Pretty sure they are releasing them slowly. Only about 10 or so are seemingly available as of now.
---
You're at the wrong bunker. Its the second bunker east of the road or the one just west of the camp fire near the door to the bunker on the east side. It's easy to miss it. Directly behind the toxic dump there's a bunker. Keep going straight behind it.
---
Hey, its you too, I also like your vids
---
You're brilliant and beautiful.
---
Just completed mine today on XB1.
---
Reminds me while I was trying to melee in 3rd person during the camp fire event, couldn't hit the shadows in 3rd person but no problem in 1st person
---
I know stealth commando pretty good. It's a fun play style, and is satisfying with and without VATS. You'll want high Perception and Agility. Under Perception you'll want the commando cards with concentrated fire and/or tank killer. For Agility you'll need sneak, covert operative, escape artist and adrenaline. As you progress you'll want at least 6 luck for bloody mess, starched genes and class freak. You'll want to avoid Endurance and Charisma. For endurance you'll want radicool if you're playing bloodied, and Charisma you'll want Lone Wanderer if you're playing solo... Maybe tenderizer if you're in a group.

I will message you in the morning! PSN is same as name on here.

Dont come around with fortnite

I don't thinks so. They just suck. I usually run towards the entrance and let the robots waste bullets on them.  There are two things I hate 1.) Mirelurk Kings 2.) Radscorpions.  They both are bullet sponges and drop garbage.  Scorpions are worse as they can burrow and NEVER give up chasing you.
---
Yeah, this happened to me a few times. Even if they claim it's fixed, I'm just not comfy doing it lol. I always drop a bullet or something first and see if it appears. Especially with sales for ammo since the ammo screen amount is bugged
---
Xbox player here. I'll try to be gentle.
---
Still no fix for the plasma gatling gun bugs and the plasma core condition bug? 
---
Also hearing many complaints about the game crashing after entering Arktos. 
---
Still loading inside foundations when traveling to vender camps.
---
Legendary monsters still disappearing before getting to loot the body. Happening more frequently now.
---
Maybe you should consider fixing the current bugs and stability issues BEFORE adding more unstable content. Or maybe just hand the game over to another firm. Its seems to me you are incapable of running compatibility test BEFORE dropping new content. Most of us would prefer to be able to play a stable version of the game instead of only being able to download updates.

---
I don't think you understand fucking emotion, profanity doesn't equal emotion.. my use has mostly been incredulous, I can't believe there's someone this.. whatever you are.
---
This has little to do with the game, but your entire disregard for the employees time at Bethesda, and the time you add to players that have to wait longer that have *legitimate fucking issues*.
---
Why? Because you *suspect* someone is cheating, simply because *you cannot see them*. Other players wondered why people were showing there on the map- you know what they did? They fucking googled it or they asked!
---
But you, you don't care if there's some employee that has to go through thousands of tickets a week- how many are people like you, with no evidence what so ever??
---
And even to this point, you're completely incapable of seeing that you took the wrong actions, you feel no empathy what so ever for the *human being* who's time you're wasting- and you couldn't even **waste ten seconds to Google if there was a reason you'd see players there**.
---
I'm not embarrassing myself, I'm trying to point out how ridiculous and petty you are.. that rather than play the game, you would make accusations of cheating with **zero** proof. Not even enough evidence where you *should* think they are cheating.
---
There's something wrong with you, you project that I'm "unhinged" when you can't even see what the fuck I'm saying *you are doing*. Look in the mirror bud, you wouldn't know what an emotion was if it slapped you in the face, and you definitely don't give a shit about anyone else.
---
Blocking you now, good night.
---
Probably all the other players being in such a tight area
---
Yeah exactly lol
---
Oh yeah for sure. Fps was garbage thought it was watching a slowmo film üòÇ
---
So you didn't try to trade with them????
---
"I find your lack of faith disturbing"
---
Well, that should work in your favour to get your lost character back, accusing them of deliberately deleting it. After all, if someone comes in to me at my work an accuses me of doing something I have most likely not done I sure as heck will work so much harder to please that person in the future. *Or not...*
---
Bugged? Anyone really surprised?
---
These only happens to me if enemies are around
---
Ah thanks!
---
Enclave bunker has Advanced Connectors plan. You can then use switches between your generator and lights to interrupt power to your lights by flipping the switch.
---
Oh fuck I‚Äôm gonna just start chugging Nuka shine now XD
---
I did that when I set up vending.  Put up 20,000 rounds for 1 cap each (5.56, 5 mm). No one bought any.  Turned out to be a good thing.  Since no one buys bullets from my vending machine, I'm gonna blow it all on legendary runs at West Tek for a couple of weeks.
---
How do you want it? I don't have paypal
---
It happens now and then. Usually at the end of a nuke-cycle before regular spawns start again. Not new, has been like that since forever.
---
How else would you explain online characters being removed on thier own
---
*Thats* why I can‚Äôt kill people with serendipity? I think that‚Äôs the dumbest perk anyway, sure it‚Äôs great for pve, but I‚Äôve lost lots of matches va pvp because of it. But thanks for pointing that out, I‚Äôll be even more careful now.
---
Doesn't happen on consoles.
---
yeah of course I was sleeping
---
The trade interface is clunky and I was giving the item away anyway. The paper bags have been working fine for months now, so I just dropped it. Big mistake, my mistake.
---
thanks I'll add it soon
---
Do you guys frequently hold onto his eggs? He appears more frequently if you do. I've had wrathful attack my camp in The Mire.
---
Crazy, I‚Äôve been playing this a looong time and I‚Äôve never seen this lol.
---
What animals are you taming and where are best spots to find them?
---
It's a reference to NCR soldiers permanently saying "patrolling the Mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter"
---
the best way to get those materials is to nuke the SBQ, centre the nuke on the prime fissure so all the added beaties are irradiated, then tesla rifle the hell out of the place.   If people give you attitude because you're not shooting the SBQ, ignore them, if they want it done their way they can drop their own nuke!
---
Thanks for commenting, additional info always welcome,'going to billet point to make this easier since I'm on my phone.  
---
1) People have reported it showing up again from time to time, possibly a revision control issue, for example one of the hot fixes fixed the "Bulk Scrap" bug for 2 days before it got broken again, the broader point is it needs the legendary AP's added.   
---
    
---
2)  You'd think so, and you may be correct.  
---
But The assumption was based on the naming compared to the other linked Curve tables.   
---
If you check the other curve tables linked on the COBJ's they are not named with the same prefix, and only the grouping with CT_xxx are failing to return any scrap.    
---
I'll see if there have been any changes there, but those stood apart.
---
3)  Do you have a specific FormID you are referencing?   
---
I only ask because Unless something has changed, the engine quite literally didn't have a mechanic built in for reducing ER in the same way as DR.  
---
Trying to replicate the same effect in CreationKit using FO4 as a test bed (core of the '76 framework is based on that) reflects that.   
---
4)  Thanks, the post was a cut and paste, then update from the original, if you'll look that's already been updated (several hours ago) to reflect its a global weapon issues.  
---
That became clear when another poster reminded me it was effecting several other weapons.    
---
5). Again edited and corrected several hours ago, thanks however.  
---
6) Disagree, in large part depending on what you are specifically referencing.   
---
Weapons missing from the Legendary tables (Until the Vendor) meant for 4'ish months the "rare" weapons were always inferior to other Legendary counterparts.    
---
I mean why even include a weapon if Bethesda didn't intend for it to be useful / fun / viable.    
---
The request to see an increased drop rate of X for example lives in QoL now as they finally fixed the issue with the plans, until that point it was nearly impossible to obtain some Plans to scrap and learn mods.
---
Has anyone determined if the refrigerated effect continues when you are in power armor?
---
I bought that mod for my support character and would love to use my good with salt points on other cards but don‚Äôt want all my food stores spoiling faster while in power armor.
---
connect a terminal and set the waiting time before you actually get to your floor. they would also need elevator music
---
I gave up after the sixth failed attempt.  Overall stability seems to have decreased and load time is slower.  Will try again in a couple of days.
---
Not a problem!
---
It‚Äôs modt likely just a stupid door. I‚Äôd save my atoms.
---
Did they say that only the raids are being instanced?
---
my camp is right below the doggy... I try to visit every day lol!
---
I have extras but I‚Äôm on PS4, sorry
---
I think this issue should at least be looked but when I was trying to place an item down in my camp it phased through the floor and I couldn‚Äôt do anything with it after..I was forced to rebuild my entire camp and wasted a ton of resources and caps just because an item phased through the ground when I was trying to place it on my floor..it took hours to build my camp and I think if you just implemented a way to delete all objects of the same type lots of people could avoid what I just went through.
---
How do you even know this is the case if you've never played the game? I've never had to grind for any materials or supplies.
---
I did that the first time.  BLAM DEAD.  I was like, wait what?? That's pathetic!  Still, while it's nice to wait for others, if there's people using 1 hit deathclaws and explosive (pretty much anything) then I'll probably shoot-to-kill, assuming if I don't, someone else will.
---
"Maybe"        
---
Odd ball issues like that I can never figure out if it should be under the heading of "Character", "UI", "Weapon", etc..     
---
      
---
Regardless of my waffling adding it to a couple of the pages would not be the worst idea,'I'll add it in the morning.    
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
I wish but dion after seeing how successful fallout 4 was three a fit and said he didn‚Äôt know his song we gonna be used in a game about murderin( but really because he‚Äôs old and broke and saw bethesda sitting on a mountain of money) and ended up sueing them although I don‚Äôt know the outcome of the case as it‚Äôs all written in legal mumbo jumbo
---
Yea same, I‚Äôll stay away for a few. I did it early in the day and it worked but the frame rate was jacked!! I did get the new weapon, bear arms, so that was cool. But the one time it worked from beginning to end it was basically unplayable!
---
Well it technically was made from pre war riot control armor and covered by a simple duster. I suppose it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard to believe it if seeing it in 76. Now I‚Äôm for this as well
---
Oneshoting boss that have zero mechanics is also nothing new.
---
Pc
---
The more the merrier!    
---
Brutal download, shame they don't have an early / incremental download options for players like you.
---
I was confused when I first went to Arktos after the update finally downloaded. It was hyped as "Just go to Arktos and go down the elevator" - well, I did that, and wandered around blindly for a bit, encountered a handful of people running to and fro without doing much of anything, and got my ass handed to me by a sentry bot that didn't even take damage when I hit it with a critical VATS shot  (and I'm lvl 141). On my *third* descent down the elevator, the event actually announced itself and prompted me to go talk to the computer. I actually did try to talk to the computer on my second try, but not much happened. There was no active event marker on my first or second try either, so I couldn't apparently join an in-progress event.
---
Haven't had a chance to try it again but I'm not sure when I do if I have to wait until the event begins, or if I can join in midway.
---
so you're saying I have to manually flip switches to get it to do it?
---
Well, at least they could keep a fare amount of the good ones
---
Ohhhh! Now it's funny because I understand the reference üòÇüòÇ
---
You should try the trade subReddits, market76 and FO76bazaar
---
Yes this so frustrating. I had so much plastic at one stage I thought I'd never run out. Then after a major clean out going to the gender I got done more junk and naturally scrap as soon as I can to only seconds realise how much of an idiot I am
---
Don't you have to buy the game again to have a mule?
---
As far as I'm aware no.
---
I've also had many items eaten by rocks/cliffs. I was sitting at max budget for weeks when one of the past few updates suddenly granted me some more budget. I asked around if anything was included in the patch notes about more budget or them fixing this bug but everyone said no.
---
I'm not sure what to think of it but I sure hope it happens again soon because those damn rocks ate more of my stuff again!
---
They said they were always meant to be team focused, with only one party at a time. It wasn't going to be instanced at first, and you'd wait in a queue... But after play testing it they realized it would just be annoying and frustrating, so they decided to make it instanced so people wouldn't need to wait.
---
At least it's only way i know of. If you're looking for something more like blinking Christmas lights or disco.... then i have no idea if that's doable.
---
No way!...
---
I saw that Enterprise and Build myself a little Prydwen at the *exact same place*
---
Ah, cool... So I'm just naturally real-world unlucky.  üòÅ
---
to be honest, i have no use for caps or low level weapons. If someone needs 25k+ for a top-tier weapon or armor piece that i'll be using, I'll happily pay. To be honest, caps really aren't useful other than for trading (go figure) so im cool with giving them all away
---
Yep.  And a one star AA Handmade is pretty damned effective too.
---
Honestly the event starts and ends so quickly I haven‚Äôt even seen what happens at the event.  I completed it though and got formula p, whatever that is &gt;,&gt;
---
as tier 1?
---
I hated companios, only there to block me in doors. It is so great all AI are dead.
---
So is a 1* furious handmade. Use it as my sniper weapon all the time. With my build I take maybe two shots at most things and it's done. Maybe 3 or 4 if it's tanky.
---
I had it equipped and it worked for me :/ maybe it's just the lag
---
Ah, cool... So I'm just naturally real-world unlucky. üò≠
---
Pretty sure I got the plasma grenade plan, too. Either that or randomly from the enlightenment event. My money is on the 50+ event, not the level 5 event.
---
I've encountered The Beach Boys on a few different servers. Experts in abusing the passive system to attack people who don't want to actually PVP. And then if you try to actually PVP them (and have a decent build or weapons) they hop servers and block you. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I just really think if the devs implemented a feature to delete all objects of the same type then it would fix this issue entirely..a radio phased through the rock you were trying to place it on? Just build another then hit ‚Äúdelete all‚Äù and problem solved. I‚Äôve seen it in plenty of other games..
---
After you spent all those years in school!
---
I can‚Äôt even make it out of the elevator before it crashes. 4 times in the last 20 minutes. Hopefully it‚Äôll be playable next week
---
Will do! Had no idea there was a market on here :) thank you!
---
It is wood under trees. In marked location.
---
Do you mind if I join you guys?
---
Add me: CaptainModrah
---
Gotta say, it surprises me how a bug-report gets down-voted. I guess after all this time, more than 6 months after launch, the people who didn't like this game still take their time to make sure their hate is felt.
---
LOL me too. They're pretty much garbage players who just spam Stealth Boys. Pop a berry mentat and they're done.
---
Well if there was a notification more people would join, and they‚Äôd join as soon as the event is started. So that would solve your problem.
---
I found that too, I've also found the green hood works perfectly and looks pretty good :)
---
A clan that hop servers all wearing the yellow shorts and blue shirt outfit. They pretty much just abuse the pacifist and workshops system to engage in PvP with people who don't want to actually PVP. And then when you fight them they leave.
---
Not only fucking ghouls, that place is too hard to render for PS4....
---
Honestly if you are over 50 the event needs your help. We‚Äôve never had a problem dropping the alpha, but the event would be a lot easier if we had more people gathering food and pumping up the friendly creatures. It seems like the level 0 ones drop instantly, but even the level 2 is somewhat resilient. I‚Äôd love to see a level 3 but it takes so much food. 
---
Help.
---
It's bought and paid for. I suggest at least getting your money worth.  About 100+ hrs should cover it
---
Why would it not be instanced? Being a dungeon and not raid has nothing to do with that.
---
Benefits of instanced dungeons:
---
- Can be designed for certain level and number of players.
---
- can be started at will
---
- can be done with pre made groups/friends, without pug randoms
---
Agreed! Every time I realize it‚Äôs started and by the time I go through two loading screens, I‚Äôm too late to help gather food. I‚Äôd like to join as soon as it starts!
---
That or a list of every item that's placed inside your camp. iirc I think fallout 4 had something like this but either way I'd be thankful for anything
---
Would you have preferred I just report them without seeing what was up?  Maybe you do that but I do not.  I only submitted the report because I genuinely believed they were cheating.  I happened to be over encumbered at the time while going through that area.  At first I did not think much of it until I got to the spot they were supposedly at.  I did not open the map and just report them because I saw their dots there.  Like I said, I believed they were cheating at the time.
---
You are entitled to swear, of course, but it is not always necessary.  The other user resorted to personal attacks which was completely uncalled for.  Sometimes when we get frustrated it is best to just not say more.
---
I simply do not appreciate that you and the other user tried to make me look like the bad guy over an honest mistake.  I cannot explain whether it was a map glitch or what but perhaps they were not in the developer room and I get that now.  We are human and we make mistakes, I may have rushed to judgment but I was unaware of said map glitch.
---
We can continue to argue if you wish but I do not think more can be said by the both of us.  This is actually getting silly if I am to be honest.
---
Take care and God bless!
---
I'll definitely do that next time!
---
I think you kids have never worked in the real world... And have never had the opportunity to pitch an idea you believe in while knowing it isn't going to make popular.
---
Not difficult, just gusties all over place again and boss that oneshot u in endgame gear. Easy to kite shit. I am so disappointed by bethesda, they just can't do hard to fight bosses. They know only bulletsponging and overpowering damage....
---
I have a CAMP on an acid resource. Took me about three weeks to make 50,000 .308 rounds to feed the MG42 and 40K 5mm rounds to feed my gatling. I was going to sell .308 for 1 cap ea. (which I think is cheap) but nobody bought them. I generally use a gatling for legendary grinding and was saving the MG42 ammo for the toughest enemies, but now that I'm sitting on a mountain of .308 bullets I can't move, I'm gonna go have fun. I'm gonna use them in my collection of MG42s at West Tek,the only true sure shot ** &amp; *** legendary source at the moment(non-nuke).
---
Now I need to figure out what to make with the 2500 units of acid I harvested.  I figure I'll go try Aluminum, Black Titanium &amp; Ultracite farming, If no one buys those then I at least can make power armor to sell.
---
I for some stupid reason thought this was going to be an actual dungeon I could spelunk with my friends, but it's just a new event and a keypadded door that leads to a room with a red trunk. That's it. I'm disappointed.
---
How many Michelin stars does it have?
---
in case you are serious, 4:8:2000 is an error that shows up when the servers are down.

I would love this so much. We know they can track some via the terminal already. I'd love the terminal to let you choose which ones to be notified of when they're ready to be triggered on the map. Or when someone else triggers them. I absolutely love events like the fasnacht parade and encrypted where everyone joins in. But this new one actually NEEDS lots to join.
---
I was able to join the event 3 times after the servers came up. Now I'm getting the hard crash everytime. The first time i used the elevator it started, not sure if it's related. (Xbox also)
---
...but hey, that's just a theory... A GAME THEORY
---
Can't even employ human npcs.
---
Most of the old stuff fixed, decent amount of new content.
---
Give it another try
---
Wait a while before you start the event from the terminal. I did one more run tonight and there were initially two people and we just waited about 10 minutes before triggering it and ended up with a lot of folks joining.
---
You are still one very angry individual.  I sincerely hope you find help.
---
I've seen it maybe 4 times (and i have farmed WS more times than I would feel comfortable to admit). Most often they are lvl 1, but sometimes they spawn in as higher level robots. After the robot spawn wave Whitesprings usually goes back to normal.
---
Now... the real magic is the wave before, and I am not kidding now, you can search this subreddit if you don't believe me. The wave before the robots is usually really bugged. About 90% of the glowing ones will spawn as legendary. At this point the radiation has usually gone away, but some of the flora is still nuked. This happens often, but not always, at the end of the nuking cycle. After that the robot spawn wave might happen. And then it goes back to normal. Been like this since the start. Something bugged with when it resets the spawn cycle after a nuke.
---
... you mean standard game mode?
---
Or do you mean bonus items for playing standard mode? (on top of the atoms we currently get?)
---
The one with venison is the easiest to get to level 3. The radstags spawn constantly. The one with the toxic stuff is a bit harder. I have t tried the kelp one.
---
You can't attack while you Sprint. Cavs good for charging in or running away.
---
Oh ok. I thought they were ok to drop as long as you hadn't fixed them. Happy to try if you see me on. I'll also keep a look or for the tourist and will shoot you a message if I come across them again.
---
You are right, but fallout comunity are mostly 20+yo guys who like to run around, no nerds like us who want some dope proggres raid like naxxramas in 2006.
---
That's my typical price for most 1\* items, with a few exceptions for higher level and sought after weapons.
---
I can get you one tomorrow if you PM me your gamertag.
---
Yep!
---
I've tried the starlet sniper hat and green hood and both look amazing
---
I don't know, but I know it makes your beard disappear.
---
Well, that's one way to fix the bugs.
---
Not as intense overall but we got a 100 sheepsquatch that could one punch kill us. After several respawns we took it out from afar with explosives while cheesing him a bit. It was the toughest most bullet spongy yet damaging thing I have seen in the game.
---
Yeah I could‚Äôve sworn they had a feature like this already implemented in fallout 4 but anything would be better than this, I can‚Äôt even place my camp down the same way it was and it‚Äôs killing the game for me
---
this is patently false. all models are stored in the game files. doing anything with the developer room in-game cannot change anything in the game files.
---
the reason why deleting that room may cause issues is because it may be referenced in other ways. it shouldn't be, however bethesda are known for using quick and lazy fixes. if you remove parts of the game that scripts and algorithms use, it'll crash, or behave unexpectedly.
---
in short, the dev room may have been made essential to a lot of the code running in the game. it shouldn't have been - never, ever - but it could be.
---
it's actually very sloppy and lazy for them to leave anything like a dev room in-game. to disable all items, objects and scripts related to the dev room should be as easy as changing a value from 1 to 0.
---
i remember bethesda fixed a quest bug by using a container in the dev room for skyrim, so i'm pretty sure they do tie down the devroom to important functions... but hell, what a stupid thing to do.
---
Well I'm sure glad I built my two death claws and 6 cat stack when I did
---
&gt; the buggiest game ever made
---
Oh come on.  It's not even the buggiest game *in the Fallout series*.  New Vegas was a mess at launch, and it never did run well without mods.
---
I guess he did not, when there are invisible ghouls and other buggs, it is not possible...
---
So far mine havent been removed
---
One bug I was having got fixed. One random but if floor in my camp I was finally able to remove... But I lost a turret and yet my build budget hasn't changed and I've still got other floors I can't remove... I was really hoping for a fix without having to move my camp and start from scratch to build the camp how I want it
---
I discovered that you need to craft one from scratch vs. placing one you've stored.
---
It will depend on your level if you can try this, and even though RNG is still the primary factor, there are those that feel what server you're on plays a roll. I've only recently begun testing it myself so I can't say for sure... But the theory states you'll get on a good one that spawns legendaries for you more frequently then others. So if at the start of a session you get a legendary that gives you something good (even if it's not something you want, but is a decent roll nonetheless) you'll continue getting good things during that particular session on that particular server. So if you roll something good you should go to West Tek, Whitesprings and other legendary farming places during that session and you'll have better luck. Again this is just a theory some people have been saying, and I have nothing to back it up.
---
And I got a Yao Guai for tier 2
---
I mean, looking at what many of the people talk about on this sub, that is indeed exactly what we want. A casual game where we kick back, relax, and do something silly for a while.
---
Yeah, it hasn't happened to me in a while though. It's mostly super mutants that would end up exploding for me.
---
guy doesn't know what he's talking about. nothing in-game can change the game files (except saving). your save may become corrupted, but not because "it's an anchor for in-game models"; bethesda may have tied some code to the devroom for some reason, and disabling it may cause the code to not work properly.
---
they did this in skyrim so it's not entirely unfeasible to think they did it here. very lazy and bad work imo.
---
The grey knit cap looks good with it too, with the tattered field jacket
---
Didn't they patch foundation stacking?
---
Fucking 10? I've been playing since the beta and I think I've seen like 1 or 2 in my whole playtime.
---
They don't drop from deathclaws, they're a random drop from some containers, meat bags, and higher tier mobs like gulpers and mirelurk kings, but not deathclaws. It's dumb, I know.
---
I've tuned into it every time I see a notification that someone has started it. That said, I've only seen a full group of 4 once. The reward was meh. The actual hunt for other players was fun in a suspenful way.
---
Don't even need to VM anything, changing MAC is built into Windows.
---
Now, banning on BIOS and GFX serials like Blizzard does it with Overwatch, that's proper.
---
I mean I keep thinking of codsworth from Fallout 4  for 210 years staying at the home cleaning worried about the rust and knowing his family was dead but stayed anyway :( I mean there has to be the codsworth equivalent in appalachia who could use a new friend.
---
Granted it is easy to survive in 76 but it's still dark, you walk around finding skeletons or the remains of people infected with the scorch plague, most holotapes you find end with the owner dying or begging for help, same with the notes laying around. Fallout 76 is dark.
---
Some people just can't move on.
---
A glamour system
---
my game is german so i think its an international crisis :D
---
I sell upwards of 8000 caps of product a day, with no where near those prices, except on items i don't really want to loose, but am not using.
---
Some vendors just want to showcase the stuff they have collected, "show and tell" style.  They aren't as interested in selling as in show casing.   High Stock rates, bring in the viewers.  High Sell rates keeps the stock to show.case.

&gt;Cranberry Bog stuck at 2/5 even though I've already discovered Abandoned Bogtown, Allegheny Asylum and Cranberry Glade 
---
i 'fixed' this by walking on top of the marker. like, literally less than a meter from where the marker shows. dunno if that's possible with the above mentioned markers, but could be worth a shot.
---
&gt;Going into your pip-boy hologram variant menu in certain situations (such as when just loading into an area after a fast travel) causes your whole game to lock up, disabling all controls except to open up the map/menu and quit, which is your only friend at that point. 
---
this is lag. waiting (sometimes more than a few minutes) should re-enable your pip-boy in time. if the game ever freezes - caught up in a loop, sound repeating, etc - try waiting a few minutes, and it should come back. i freeze every day (at least a dozen of times) and i always just sit and wait (it helps having friends on discord). the pipboy bug is simply the game having to load in something... seems it checks something server-side as well (perhaps retrieving information on your inventory?) - the issue is most pronounced when a lot of things are happening, like killing the scorchbeast queen or with a lot of explosions.
---
&gt;Massive drop in frame rates (PS4 Pro) when in big battles, to the point where it's hard to judge my aiming movement due to how sluggish the game becomes. Happened today at the new Arktos Pharma event with several players and monsters around me. Had to spam like 6 stimpaks because of the delay on button inputs with the frames chopping up. 
---
i think this is the same issue as above. they're both related - essentially it's lag and instability - and when the frame rate chops up enough, it'll turn into a freeze. i have at least 20-30 mini-freezes (1-10 seconds) every day.
---
Personally too, I‚Äôd get rid of strong back, het inscissor and rank up martial to 3*
---
that is way I love mods, they fix annoying crap like that
---
Did you have them all repaired at 200 % durability? If so the extra bonus to all weapons and armor at that durability is no longer added.

No, not always, but the number goes up without doing that
---
What do you mean by ending? You won't be able to play the quests? Sorry I'm new at the game
---
Pretty sure it is a plan you can get from the new event
---
Side note, grab rejuvenated instead of lifegiver rank two
---
Also sunkissed as your swap perk to get rid of rads during the day
---
Well most other effects would be more useful
---
Oh man, the super mutants are running around with TSE's too?
---
I'm scared.
---
Did a scorch queen take down i think it went down to 1 frame per second at the end but managed to grab the loot before the serve crashed - 2000 rpunds of 5.56 and 1500 of .50 cal for a no star shotgun.  Lol...
---
That mf had 1200 DR, holy fuck is it back?
---
Hence the need for VMs. harder to ban.
---
Happens to me all the time lately. It's always non-robotic enemies for me. During the new dungeon, I had ragstags exploding ALL OVER THE PLACE killing me over and over again. Many times I'd be downed, get revived, then instantly downed again from another exploding ragstag.
---
Really, REALLY, bad bug and needs to be fixed asap!!!
---
Thanks a bunch, it means a lot &lt;3
---
Yep.
---
Fix the old quests/challenges that don't work first ... before you add more content that doesn't work.
---
Nope .... Fix the fact that players are making free Atom Shop content first .... forget about the playability of the game.
---
i use the suitcases sitting around the train stations to give someone something, just pop the item in and anyone can grab it :D

---
I also think on a earlier thread someone said the durability doesn't effect damage
---
Not really, it's super easy to determine if you're running in a VM
---
Yes, anything that gave a star via a mod was removed to only be an effect
---
Assume due to the Legendary vendor and exploiting the shit out of modded weapons like scorch killer
---
Zealot isn‚Äôt bad, the reload res is really nice since it takes ages to do it.
---
I have a stack of 4 fully charged fusion core for the last hour of running around in my power armor and so far the whole stack is still fully charged
---
I‚Äôm interested since I use power armor for everything but crafting and sleeping.
---
I used to do that too, just got too damn complacent now that the drop bags had worked so well for so long. My own mistake of course, one should always be careful, especially with legendary items. But still. Sad to see this bug back.
---
That's awesome!
---
Wish I was 1% as creative as the people I see posting CAMP's here.  Been playing since launch and still chilling in a 3x3 two-story cabin :(
---
Learn to crop or posy source images.
---
You'ld be the only one.  Melee is a mess .... swing, hit, do no damage, get crushed by a counter attack that should not have been possible, stand around staggered as you get destroyed waiting to refresh.
---
The box tells you something is going to happen in 5 minutes, I'm sure it said an orbital strike, maybe I'm wrong.

---
What do you think of this? Incisor and tank killer to help you ignore armor. Lone wanderer for when you are solo and you could switch out for group perks when grouped like bodyguards or rad sponge. White knight to save you repairs just a bit. Same with gunsmith.
---
Try placing an object down and it phased through the floor causing you to delete your entire camp and you can‚Äôt place it the same way it was because they just got even more strict with camp building :):):):)
---
YES.
---
As much as I enjoy Fallout 76, the thing I miss most about the previous games were the companions.  Nick Valentine from 4, Serena from Skyrim. Not just because they were extra storage space when traveling. Defintely not for their aim. But because they provided dialogue, they added personality and history to the world. Even Dogmeat did this and all he could do was bark, find the occasional item, and get stuck in the floor from time to time.
---
Someone else posted a suggestion about creating robot NPCs to do minor roles around camps, like Mr Farmhands who tend to crops and Mr Gutsies to act like mobile turrets. I see the assets from the Automaton  DLC were repurposed for the Lying Lowe quest, so why not bring that back in some capacity?
---
This.  Claiming a bug doesn't exist when the overwhelming evidence and testimony of the masses proves otherwise.  Kinda feels like those Super Mutants that take no damage, in spite of the fact they weren't blocking.
---
Just repaired a weapon and the damage stayed the same
---
What happened to fixing the Stimpack Diffuser &amp; Deathclaw Hides missing for challenges this update?
---
It was the scorched weapon receiver learned at the Firebreathers station that used to give a 4th star, along with the sacrificial blade mod for the machete. But these were just mods and not real legendary effects and it has been corrected now. Still works as before.
---
Well, I appreciate you letting us all know, and hopefully save someone the hassle of losing something awesome.
---
Not everything is an easy fix. This community, and basically every other community has made new content their primary request from Bethesda... Which they have obviously focused on. This means exploits get fixed, but niche fixes are taking a backseat to things that help/balance new content get the forefront. Since this update was final one for Wild Appalachia I assume we'll get plenty of bug fixes between now and Nuclear Winter.
---
But do they serve ‚Äústrange meat‚Äù?  Honestly, I was expecting this story to go completely sideways with the owner attempting to PVP you so you could be on the menu.
---
No worries, I got it safe and sound on my suit :)
---
I imagine that in many cases it‚Äôs not as much a question of priority as it is how quick it is to fix. 
---
The backpack mod was likely just switching a no to a yes to make the plan consume upon use, with no further complications. 
---
Something like the melee VATS bug, while widely reported, probably isn‚Äôt as quick a fix. There could be any number of reasons it occurs along with any number of unintended consequences when fixing it. The last thing they want at this point is to fix one thing and break another.
---
There is a pretty common spawn for them at Bog Town. I don't think I've ever gone through there and NOT seen one out behind the taller buildings.
---
Zealot's is decent as long as you run Bear Arms so you can keep the thing just for SBQ fights and the occasional scorchbeast. VATS bonuses aren't normally useful for heavy weapons, because VATS burns fusion cores extremely fast in PA.
---
If it wasn't mmo (for values of "massive" less than or equal to 24) it wouldn't exist.
---
Yeah the terminal is one way to do it, but I think it would be much more straightforward for them to simply be checkable in the pipboy when they aren't active.
---
Wtf is the bear hand?
---
The fact that people on the trade forums set it into effect to systematically spread the high capacity plan and made huge amounts of money doing so made it an exploit. It was mean to be a reward, instead it became a highly spread item making a few people very rich. Had people not made a thing out of this it would most likely have been lower priority, but the trade forums were flooded with people spreading the plan for caps.
---
Exactly! A few times this happened to me on an SBQ fight! Where there was just me and 3 other players whooping the queen, one lvl 40 died over and over doing the best he can to melee mobs away from us while we focus on the queen. And the rest? Hiding inside the bunker! This was back when slap dmg still existed, i spammed the whole inside of that bunker filled with player's hiding with my TSE. 50 as soon as the event ended.
---
I don't see any here
---
Haven't used nukashine, but I can confirm as a quack surgeon myself your patients do recieve whatever alcohol effect you revive them with, but it seems only liquors work, and since none of the new alcohols are affected by party boy/girl, I have the feeling they don't work with quack surgeon either.
---
If you're melee you can't really do anything until they land. You'll need to do damage to their wings to make them land, then you smack them with your melee. If you have a shotgun and combine it with Enforcer you can force it to land pretty easily.
---
Zealots combined with a Prime receiver will make it a nice weapon for SBQ-fights. Heavy to carry around for that use only, unless you have Bear Arms. Which I recommend if you have a heavy build.
---
I got the country door myself. Got tired of broken windows.
---
can't y'all just use an item for fun sometimes
---
Buy before you scrip, it just takes a bit of discipline.
---
Day 1 -- accumulate legendaries, scrip 'em  
---
Day 2 -- buy stuff from Murmgh, scrip stuff you don't want (e.g. 3* wood), get more legendaries, scrip 'em  
---
Day 3 -- as day 2.
---
That way you never get stuck with 3* wood or 3* assaultron head befor logging out.
---
Off topic question.... anyone else can‚Äôt sign in to the game ??
---
new gauntlet from the trailer
---
I just fail to understand how the VATS issue which affects a core game mechanic for an entire category of weapons against a whole subset of enemies is categorised as 'niche'.
---
I guess the answer, using the official reply to the challenge issues as a template, is 'players can use a non-melee weapon'?
---
That one is nice!
---
3. I believe after patch 7 where I definitely noticed this.
---
Capitalism? ;)
---
Right, my bad, small phone screen
---
It‚Äôs just a chapter of the road map they put out for new content to be released. Some things were time limited, like those relating to the Fasnacht parade, but the majority is here to stay.
---
Field scribe hat also looks pretty good with it
---
I logged off this morning now I can‚Äôt sign back in wtf
---
Yeah, this time the item was just nice, but not important. I would hate if this happened to someones favourite item being handled to someone for an upgrade or similar.
---
Gear level really has nothing to do with it. Things that matter most are Legendary attributes and your perks. I use melee as my primary was of dealing with the trash enemies and first time I fought the alpha boss I did fine. True it does do a lot of damage (About 60% with 1 hit in my max lvl PA) but I dealt back good damage. I saw the chunks of hp I was taking from it with each hit, so really on you. Melee builds are the front line in World bosses, if you can't take a hit, back off and use guns.
---
It was only for melee , not for ranged !!
---
Some perks do that. If you crouch/ sneak your damage goes up. I am not sure if it shows in weapon stats. I have seen that before and it was due to changes in perks.
---
Plus some of the values I gave were what I got the weapon at
---
I get what you are saying but how about at least an acknowledgement and some form of commitment?
---
'hey people, we are aware of this and working on a fix to be rolled out in the foreseeable future'.
---
Okay so I began my adventure as a melee. If and when they land, they don't stand a chance. Before the landing frequency was tweaked due to complaints there would be times I'd have to just run away or just let it kill me because it'd never land. 
---
I have since switched to heavy guns and they usually land as the final 5mm round penetrates their abdomen exploding within their chest cavity hurling them to the ground to bounce around a few minutes while I grin in self satisfaction. 
---
However, they have tweaked the landing and sonic spamming favoring the adventurer. I'd recommend a missile launcher with targeting computer system to explode on their wings. Once their wings take certain amount of damage they'll always land. 
---
Alternatively, you can swap perks to a heavy gun and fire at them with high rate of fire weapons. The luck perk has One Gun Army and has a small chance to cripple a limb when your heavy guns hit. At rank 3 this chance is 12%. But with the high rate of fire weapons your probability is much higher.
---
OP wasn't making a joke, he found Bethesdas in-game joke that's a nukashine wake up location.

I just upgraded rifleman, but that shouldn't effect every weapon in my inventory

This and ingredients. If I don't accidentally scrap cooking oil it's most likely to get used up when I bulk oil.
---
On wich system do you play ? It woud be amazing to visit your camp. I am playing on ps4
---
Looks awesome.Thanks
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
My bad. Didn't know about it.
---
Can't say that its happening to everyone. Got 56 in my inventory, all still say 100.
---
I love you
---
Yeah, it's a strange system. I think more or less the concept is to evade. The real time combat allows for you to jump in and out rather than a typical MMORPG which has cooldowns etc. I like this system better because I can react in real time rather than making movements and adjustments in position between attacks and cooldowns. But even as a ranged heavy Gunner I get pummeled in one or two hits usually lol
---
Yeah, it crashed on me the first few times, so I was going to ignore it, but when I got on the terminal at my base, there was an entry for the mission. Once I activated it, I haven't had an issue.
---
A lot of bugs are introduced by changes in the previous patch, which should narrow down things for them, but I guess not.
---
If you use a switch, make sure the pole is not next to the building you are trying to control the lights, otherwise the switch wont matter.... move the pole with the switch away from the house, and turning it off/on should control the lights as well.
---
Most plans for heavy armors are available at the vendors under notes. They're kind of pricey but you may find some cheaper on player vendors.
---
Can you craft me one?
---
For sure, but it did spread the item in unintended way, removing an important reward from the game. Thus exploit... by capitalism. 
---
I spread it myself. By mistake. After learning it I noticed I still had it. Wondered if I bought it twice somehow? Sold it on my vendor. Didn't know it could be reused then. Heh...
---
According to the wiki page, not yet. But eventually.  Still waiting for the SBQ so I can waste an entire wall on 1 decoration.

Shoot wings with a shotgun, not worrying about damage, just trying to cripple the wings so it lands.
---
Follow up with weapon of choice when it is on the ground.

I don't need it myself since I've done most of them already, but this will be really helpful and useful to tonns of ppl!  Thanks for your time and effort!

At fisrt  anything i could shoot it with till it hit the ground. Than used my melee but find a weapon that suits your build in any way, I rock bloodied and got an explosive bloodied10mm pistol as my sidearm.

Wasn't that person trolling with the battle royale BS. I couldn't find any evidence that they were telling the truth. Was there new stuff datamined with this patch?
---
Civil war era suit and top hat.
---
Lol does it work if you have the knife skin
---
I have a legitamite problem I need help with there is constant disconnects when playing project paradise
---
what kind of moderators are you people who silence some one like that
---
For the more traditional look, miner's hat for the win.
---
Lmao calm down bud
---
Blender it for 15scrip
---
Exterminator's legendary effect (+30% dmg vs bugs &amp; mirelurks, including the crawler) and Exterminator lvl 3 perk (ignore 75% of bug &amp; mirelurk armor, including crawler). It fell reasonably fast with my handmade.
---
I would be calm if this site wasn't deleting and removing my questions and concerns
---
Cav is for melee, sentinel is for ranged. 
---
 
---
If youre running melee you can charge at your enemies and take less damage while doing it, then hit them with a power attack.
---
If you use guns you can get a good position and sit calmly while placing your shots.
---
Both are good pieces of armor but truly shine when in complete sets, even after the nerf.
---
Lol, is that what you‚Äôre posting
---
There are so **so** many posts on this
---
It‚Äôs known. They‚Äôre attempting to get it fixed
---
are you the one deleting my posts?
---
Only once. Got mauled to death by a gang of charred ghouls when I travelled to the Whitespring Station.
---
Paper bag seems to work fine when I drop fertilizer and toilet paper on beds.  üòé
---
Well I mean putting a stop to every having some bushes is obviously top priority...
---
Yes, this is silly. You refused to acknowledge information that proved that your opinion was wrong, then proceeded to defend your harassment of others once you knew that you were incorrect. 
---
Now you want to say that it wasn‚Äôt your fault because you were ignorant, after you actively sought out others who you had no reason to suspect were doing anything other than enjoying the game.
---
Also, there is no ‚Äúperhaps they were not in the developer room‚Äù because they weren‚Äôt. It is literally impossible to access this room from your console because of restraints and safeguards in place by Sony. This [article](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-17-bethesda-cracks-down-on-fallout-76-accounts-with-illicit-developer-room-items) by Eurogamer has an official statement from Bethesda saying that the only way in is to use third party software on the PC client. (I just got home and was unable to link this before)
---
But hey, some guys on the internet proved you were wrong and said that you should actually give a shit about other people‚Äôs perspective, so now you can just right off the entire incident as a oopsy on all sides and go on with your day learning nothing from this situation.
---
No, it will have a little green shield next to a moderator‚Äôs name plate
---
I do not have little green shield
---
oh
---
Give players stuff for free? Bethesda doesn't do this anymore.
---
i‚Äôm frantically trying to get rid of mysterious veil from my inventory, not that i‚Äôm hating the quest, but i don‚Äôt want it cluttering my apparel tab. hit a wall with the ski lodge (high level super mutants )
---
According to patch notes already built topiaries will remain. Not sure what'll happen if you try to move them though
---
Yeah, that fog crawler is no joke... stacks some serious damage over time that cuts right through power armor.
---
so let me know how wearing power armor works with unarmed builds. not everyone can use shiny power armor.
---
I did mine with a bomber jacket and bos hood. I thought i looked like the vulture more than a plague doctor though
---
A dense torso mod on your armour helps mediate damage from their sonic attacks, perk wise I use an automatic handmade with commando, commando expert and commando master with 1 level of each, tank killer (rifles ignore armour), bloody mess 3 for extra damage, concentrated fire 1 so you can target the wings. With the gun I have the powerful auto receiver on and the magazine that gives you armour penetration and extra ammo capacity, finally some psycobuff or similar never hurts, I might have forgotten the odd perk or two but it‚Äôs early lol, it was a long time tbh before I stopped running away from them, when I finally did kill one it was by fighting it in the air, sometimes they just refuse to land, try and jump on top of something and you‚Äôll avoid scorched melee hits while your pointing your gun to the sky, good luck out there
---
AT LEAST IM ON MY 12TH TIME TRYING TO GO DOWN THE ELEVATOR SO I CAN PLAY PROJECT PARADISE! YAY I LOVE THIS BROKEN GAME THAT WAS LITERALLY WORKING LIKE 8 HOURS AGO I  HAVE 4 HOURS OF YOUTUBE VIDEO PROVING THIS
---
r/fo76bearhunt is the subreddit you're thinking of. Add pics of what you find in-game so all can witness the glory!
---
Zealot effect is awesome. I use a Zealot 5mm for all my queen fights. 
---
But onto the Gatling plasma. It is the highest dps of the heavy laser class. I use that also for queen fights. However the anti armor legendary doesn't actually do anything with it. üò©I digress. It's a good weapon!
---
If only Robotics Expert, Animal Friend, and Wasteland Whisperer worked like that. They'd be actually worth running on a build.
---
That‚Äôs what I thinking but I had second thoughts with it being explosive. I figured I ask Reddit as I don‚Äôt know much about good rifle builds
---
I've been putting mine un the suitcase near the purveyor if I can't burn them,  hopefully some random with find them and have script to earn.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs the one. Thanks!
---
As I said I am not saying it did not need patching, it did.
---
I just don't see how any of the mentioned bugs, which are a constant source of frustration, apparently don't.
---
For a bit of background... a very large list of bugs - most of them still unacknowledged (officially) and unaddressed - was submitted and discussed in the late December/early January period by a very talented friend.
---
He did manage to get 'higher up' than most players with the matter but cutting a long story short they labelled all these bugs 'low hanging fruit' and stated that 'they had bigger fish to fry'.
---
So moving forward I cannot help but archive any newly introduced bugs that remain unacknowledge and unadressed in that 'low hanging fruit' filing cabinet and some of them are so egregious (VATS and FT are driving me bonkers) that I just cannot fathom while they have been placed in the 'ignore' list.
---
It happens if you go there too frequently or too many other players just pass through to the vending camps and not properly clearing the mobs. I usually go there at least hourly and when I don't see any players roaming around.
---
I cant imagine its so much harder to remove drills and syringers from the legendary drop pool than it was to remove the server wide free food drop from Feed the People.
---
Yeah, just like before it works fine 99 times out of 100, and then it don't. When you least expect or need it.
---
Also, this is why I keep my bed behind a secret, hidden door.
---
I just picked up my first Plasma Gatling about a week ago. So far I'm really pleased with it. The only thing I need now is the mod that concentrates the beam.
---
\&gt;  I use melee as my primary was of dealing 
---
Sorry, gonna have someone else answer that. Only thing I could offer on that is use: Bloodied unarmed weapons with sentinel armor and just stand there. It's what I've seen others do and it looks like it works but I've never bothered to ask.
---
Instigating has issues with explosive effects apparently
---
Plus it isn‚Äôt max level, so there are def better options for folks out there
---
Wow thanks for that. Cool site!
---
Plus it looks way cooler in red. Dunno why people are downvoting you. I am equally pissed about this. Have my upvote
---
Also on pc. The first time yesterday that i took the elevator, after the loading screen, my screen froze and i had to restart the pc.
---
this post has been silenced 
---
im going to take revenge  for the actions displayed here you now owe me a great debt
---
Ok, I know it‚Äôs not max level but I didn‚Äôt know those perks don‚Äôt work well together. Thank you
---
you have 3 weeks to repay your debt
---
Stealth commando sounds like fun! Would I have to forego power armour?
---
Been playing for 200+ hours. I've only seen ONE behemoth so far. I was only level 20ish when I first started exploring the Savage Divide. I went through almost every bullet I had to put that big bastard down. Made sure to get a pic with it before and after.
---
normally I would, but I was moving all the garbage ammo i'd picked up today and always just drop that crap. Got excited and did it with the weapon first. Oh well.
---
Where did you find mods
---
PC
---
Naked?
---
Hahaha I'm drafting a review
---
https://imgur.com/0cJKFZw

This was my first pull. I've had bad luck ever since but I know the Ultracite Gatling Laser is highly wanted, and this is Instigating. I have NO clue what to sell it for. I've priced it at various prices but I'm finally posting here to see if I can meet anyone in-game to sell it. 
---
PC, name Lorehn. Usually playing after 7PM PST.

+50 Damage Resistance while aiming

Double Damage if target is full health

VATS critical shots do +50% damage
---
Oh, sorry if I "subverted" your "expectations" LOL
---
Yep I just saw a player at the new boss fight today killing most creatures with one or two shots with a handmade, fast and quiet.
---
The only one I could build at my workbench was the site. But as for any other mods I haven't been able to find any anywhere and I've been to a lot of Venders. Both train station and player.
---
Can't wait to "corn" my Radtoads and Mongrel meat
---
Soooooooo manyyyyyyyyy buuuuuugs.
---
I did it 3 times that way. Then i tried the elevator and have crashed everytime since whether i use the elevator or the event marker.
---
I had to get someone to craft mine otherwise i'd be totally willing to help you out.
---
What are the best mixes together, currently have a Unyielding/sentinel set
---
bolstering/sentinel set
---
Assassin/cavaliers set
---
I was thinking of going for a vanguard/sentinel set next but with your view about running melee.
---
Perhaps there is a better mix I should shoot for?
---
Bolstering/cav 
---
Vanguard/cav 
---
Unyielding/cav
---
"all new characters"
---
Walk out of Vault 76. Die to radiation because nuke zone now.
---
Well, I was lucky and ol' mamma moleman gave me a vampiric, weightless (90% reduced weight), +50%dmg on limbs LMG (light machine gun). It uses .308 and it can mow down a Scorchbeast if I can keep up with bullets.
---
I do not have a specific build yet so no extra heavy gun damage, or anything. Vampiric keeps me healed.
---
I had this same problem. 1 plan read and nothing. Later on i tried to buy 2nd plan and said my inventory was full(it was not) found 3rd plan today and read it and it worked! I think some server fuckery was going on and reading the plan did not stick. Had this same stove for 3 days now and finaly got it built
---
Wait two dayis till she land, then fist her 4times, she ded.
---
Its worse when the enemy has guns. My 2nd character is camped in the forest near a guaranteed Scorched spawn, and the instant I load in, despite my camp being a good 100m away from them, they start shooting at my camp. It gets better (worse) though. They directly target my two small generators, which I have placed out of their line of sight (behind a hill), and behind 3 large defense walls. Doesn't stop them. They home in on my generators immediately every time I spawn at my camp. Really getting sick of it. I also have a turret placed next to the generators and that never stops them either (lvl 6 scorched lol).
---
The cooking show bears where hella cool to come across, snapped a pic and left them all be...
---
Clancy Manor in the valley if you haven't checked it out.
---
Does anyone have a recommendation for minimum level to do the Encryptid event? I haven't joined one yet as I'm level 62 and don't want to be a pain in the butt. Would I be useful at level 62?
---
Just make sure pacifist is on or else the second the event "ends"(usually officially ends quite a few seconds begore the notification ) you're gonna proc agro on all the players who will proceed to murder you for caps.
---
Thanks dude! Been there yesterday for a short time right after the event and couldn't find any hint, what has to be done.
---
My build allows me to spec into PA with Heavy Weapons easily, just switch up my cards. I only really use it for nuke zones and SBQ fights, but I mostly use stealth commando for everything else. It requires most special points being in Strength, Perception, Intelligence and Agility. I could sacrifice Intelligence points into different specials though... It's mostly in my build for utility perks.
---
I am talking about that moment at E3 as he was going though his speech. Idk I took note of it, and though to see if any other saw it. Not sure what "you kids" bit has to do with anything?
---
That could get broken super fast but in the best way.
---
BGS employee: Sir, VATS is broken and sone of the quests cannot be completed; I think we should focus on that in the new pa-
---
Todd: D E L E T E       T H E      C A T      B U S H
---
Use this fists down at the lake. We seem to have a crustacean problem.
---
you fucking cucks I will kill and fuck your familys alive
---
I was downvoted to hell for saying this boss is fucking shit again. Bethesda can't make bosses with complex mechanics, so they are adding Bullet sponge with crazy amound of damage every two months. I love Fo76, but this sux, engame is shit.
---
Yes it is! I did not say it was not. Some of my favorite screen shots are of skeletons reaching to each other, or reaching for a control of some kind.
---
I was up until 1am trying to join the event with zero success, tried a hard reset clearing the cache, tried walking there from gauley mine, tried fast travelling to the event, fast travelling to the building, everything basically so looks like il be getting my event rewards from other people‚Äôs vending machines, crying shame, I was really looking forward to getting stuck in last night :(
---
This update won‚Äôt let me sign in
---
uhh yeah? major bug =! high priority
---
it's dumb to bring servers offline as soon as you find fixes for things. then servers would be down constantly. but obviously you have to bring down servers if there is a very serious issue. all huge games does it. nothing odd about it.
---
"Oh, I wonder how that new update is goi..."
---
***Reads post***
---
"Yeah, I'll give it a fortnight."
---
Don't skimp on VATS it's really good on most builds, especially if you use guns.
---
I wrote that as a joke. Could have an easy way of getting junk for selling, they die and so on...
---
put dense mod on your chest armor thier breath attack won't hurt you anymore ..now this won't help you kill them any better but they wont be able to kill you unless they land...(this does not protect agaist the poison attack they cropdust you with)
---
Wondering if a shotty build would benefit from VATS. I imagine it would at medium range.
---
Guess we all know who mama's favorite is...
---
if any one has info on this please let me know!
---
Because I rewatched some old E3 footage? I got tired of listening to people go on about broken promises, or this or that from E3 stuff that did not live up to what he said. Took note of that part of the speech. Have you gone back over it and had this thought? No? Right because none of it really matters anymore.
---
Absolutely. In fact, that's one of the very efficient ways to take out big enemies. Shoot at legs with Enforcer perk equipped: sooner or later you get a crippled limb, causing them to slow down to a halt. It's also one of the most efficient ways to bring down a Scorchbeast or a Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Sounds like a flaw in the game. You shouldn't have to unequip your gear so as not to one shot a legendary. They should work on scaling
---
I hope it is! Glad to be of help
---
I just started having this issue, I was doing project paradise a bunch earlier and recently in the past hours it was disconnects constantly, I think its a game bug though,
---
This game is what we make of it, and that's the best part. There are vary few things I wish I could add, but in all reality it's such a solid start. I can not wait for the Elder Scrolls version will hold.
---
I've only ever once randomly crossed players doing picture challenge. It was two ppl taking pics of each other in clown costumes in front of Freddy's. I came in my clown costume and we all kinda took pics together and for each other. That was it, never had that happen again in my daily efforts.
---
That was patched out months ago.
---
Ooh. Then there are recipes I have not found yet. I only have very basic ones and am almost at lvl 70.
---
One shot without low health? Stealth vats rifleman build with an Instigating lever action or gauss rifle.
---
What are you trying to build? A dps monster? A tank? Or kind of a hybrid
---
With the right build and mutations a bloodied builds can reach monstrous levels of damage. I have a full set of uny/cav and a bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet.  Fully specced into unarmed/melee with bloody mess on, adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, and talons, health at 40% my DCG sits at around 1200 damage per swing. 
---
If i put nerd rage level 3 on, get my health down to below 10%, have 15 strength + 15 from uny. set +radicool perk + shielded brotherhood fatigues + armor perk - putting my stength around 40ish - i can see well into the 2-3k range for damage per swing. Coupled with the martial artist perk and SS legendary effect, it puts out insane levels of damage. 
---
If i switch over into heavy guns, throw on power armor for the stabilized perk, and add in demo expert, i can get my bloodied explosive gatling plasma up near 300 damage per shot around 30-40% health, and thats energy damage, much stronger than ballistic. I have a beam splitter on it, adding extra projectiles for unpisted damage, and the stabilized perk ignores 45% of armor.
---
With the plasma i can kill the queen by myself in less than 10 minutes, if i have someone to keep the mobs off of me. The biggest drawback to a bloodied build is your health. While its an unbelievably strong build, its extremely easy to die. I die constantly, and i have 300+ levels of experience.
---
With my assassin's sentinel set i can tank several hits from any player and get shots off on them before they kill me. As long as im not moving, theres a good chance im going to take less than 30% damage. However this only applies to player damage. PVE damage youll probably take 25-45% damage per hit. 
---
With a vanguard sentinel set, youll be able to tank and incredible amount of shots as not only is the sentinel effect in olace, but full vanguard sets put your DR anywhere from 500-800 depending on the set, which is more than power armor. However you wont be capable of nearly as much melee damage. You could still run a bloodied gun, but that would completely defeat the purpose of vanguard. Which is why some people like bolstering. However bolstering is dangerous just like bloodied, being low health all the time is scary, and without the added SPECIAL stats from uny armor, its still very easy to die. I didnt like bolstering. Tried it for a bit, got rid of it. 
---
Vanguard/cav ive never tried. I could see it going well with some mutations and a furious swing speed melee weapon.
---
They said *at least* raids will be instanced.
---
Then I was lucky to buy a furious 1* gattling gun for 200 caps...
---
I would much more willing to keep playing the game if they told us ahead of time if something was coming to the store or if it was going on sale.  
---
Right now I am only playing it again because one of my friends randomly wanted to start playing again.
---
 Unarmed builds are limited when using power armor since none of the unarmed weapons (power fist, mole miner gauntlet, knuckles, etc) can be used in PA. Instead, your power armor arm pieces can have mods which augment your unarmed attacks. There's only 2 that I know of: Rusty Knuckles and Tesla coils. One adds a bleed, the other adds energy damage.
---
Haha üòÇ
---
The Fasnacht Parade ended lond ago but everything else is here to stay.
---
Fantastic advice, gonna try that as well!
---
Thoughts so lol just got reminded of it when I started the quest on my alt account
---
The vendor bot at the Watoga Station in southern Cranberry Bog always sells the plans for the Sturdy and Heavy Combat Armor sets. Don't know about any of the other sets. Hope this helps.
---
invisible ghouls, disconecting, oneshoting boss,.... 
---
But i don't belive it is dead, you just don't have luck on players that know something like this in game, don't forget only part of comunity is on reddit checking for news.
---
It's mostly requires coordination and fallout random haven't transitioned to that open mic follow the leader play style. The event fails more than not due to the friendly animals getting killed. Everyone is after that 3* legendary at the end for that sweet 1* ghoul leather left arm lol. 
---
I think as more folks become more familiar with the mechanisms it'll be an easier pug.
---
I honestly don't know if it's bugged, poorly explained, or a mixture of both.
---
Perk Card decks is a great idea. And also, a closet of some sorts so we can easily wear armor sets and make armor builds
---
I too got complacent and lost a bloodied/exp/faster reload revolver today. Lesson learned.
---
How dare you sleep lol
---
I've seen it-- it's a bear skull gauntlet, and it GROWLS ; )
---
i reported the same thing and got the same downvotes. reddit is retarded most of the time.
---
Nope
---
üò¢
---
I ran around in the new event area for about 4 hours and ended up with 15 star items.
---
I did it three times, 3\* weapon every times, shitty but 120scrips man! :D
---
I thought they said about 6 months back in the beginning of the year. So maybe June or July?
---
Interesting, check hot posts, there is guide, few people confirmet i will NOT kill them.
---
That sweet scrip!
---
Ok, so how do you propose to balance the issue that everyone suddenly gets more damage done than the game and content is planned for?
---
This got me past the elevator then the game froze after about 2 minutes. Second time crashed to home screen again in the elevator. üòí
---
Have you done the personal terminal to activate the first waypoint? I've seen some folks report that they didn't have future issues after that.
---
In whitespring golf club even non-legendary ghouls does drop legendaries. That place is crazy.
---
Stealth wasn't until my 2nd playthrough. My first was pure Destruction dual casting.
---
everyone‚Äôs been having tons of issues with the performance there, on all platforms. i dont think anyone knows of a fix for any of them yet other than just wait for bethesda to do a hotfix or something
---
If you are not finding many legendary foes change servers. Seems that some servers spawn more than others.
---
Ehhhhhhh... two-shot on a shotgun is kinda meh. Shotguns normally only shoot 8 pellets, but what two-shot does is literally just add an additional projectile (also reduces accuracy), which basically doubles every other weapons number of projectiles as they typically shoot only 1 projectile normally, but for the shotgun it literally adds 1 pellet, so you're now firing 9 pellets instead of 8. Same way it worked in Fallout 4. Granted that one pellet is doing 20% of your default damage, but it's pretty damn easy for that one pellet to miss unless you're barrel stuffing enemies. Other effects are a LOT better for the double barrel (especially QUAD as you get 8 rounds and the innately high fire rate makes it exceptional).
---
This reminds me of people complaining about others stealing *their ore* (I saw that first!) in Warcraft. Thank goodness we don't have a zone chat.
---
Hopefully. I cant handle another encryptid style of clusterfunkery.
---
It's called power creep üòä
---
Considering I've watched people rip them to shreds, it sure will. If it's confirmed the splash won't then the bullet spread is. Cause the enemy creatures were not doing the damage. The lvl 200+ guy with the explosive automatic weapon was.
---
this was my 1st time experiencing it. 3 times within an hour and one of them ended up being at robo brain in sugar grove
---
That's the thing I can't get down their I just crash trying @.@
---
The Dailies? 1, maybe. All 5? Fuck no.
---
The Weeklies I try to do though. 30 Atoms to go claim a particular workshop.
---
I like the Survival Mode challenges since they feel like a quest and it actually has a good reward. Or at least something worth a nice chunk of legendary lotto script if the reward doesn't work on my build.
---
While I agree completely that there are bigger and more important bugs, there are also easier bugs to fix. In this case they most likely just had to copy/paste the correct code from any other existing plan. Probably took less than 5 minutes to do. Not even kidding.
---
Finding out why melee doesn't connect correctly and why it no longer targets some creatures correctly in VATS is most likely a project that need several of the code debuggers going through thousands of lines of code trying to figure it out and at the same time having to be careful not to break anything else while doing so.
---
I would love to have my melee fixed, but I acknowledge that it is a complex bug. I agree that the plan felt less important, but it was most likely fixed by an intern who still had the last bite of his lunch-sandwich in his mouth while he sat down and fixed it in a jiffy.
---
To me, the one thing does not impact the other.
---
It crashes my game everytime i try to join or use the elevator. (xbox)
---
Me too! Feel free to add me - VvT, so we can party up sometimes for some events and dailies. I won't be in the game for a week or so (on vacation now) but after that I'll add you asap.
---
It's only bad because there's no communication. Lol.
---
Ooh nice
---
Ye like being able to sign in so I can actually play the fuken game
---
go to any rail road station and read the 3 posters for side quests. the pioneer scout one is good to get started early and then explore
---
Yeah i also play at this time so maybe im just too late for today. I just saw how the burrows was utterly dead on day 2 and its already rare for me to find servers with much action.
---
Maybe some weapons are bugged. I‚Äôve done the event a few times, and honestly key to success for one of them was carpet bombing the whole area with nuka grenades. Didn‚Äôt touch our mascot.
---
Did you get the real meaning of the prize bot?
---
I fired continuously with my exploding legacy plasma gatling at mr Mirelurk for 20 secs on my first run just to test this out. He did not lose one iota of hp. You guys simply need to defend the creatures better, they are most likely taking damage from enemies while the explosives guys are protecting them.
---
Exploring.  A lot.  The best way to do it honestly is wander like heck around the left side of the map, so the grey and the greenery part of it.  Everything else starts to be more intense the more right you go.  Discover all the locations, loot loot loot.  There are a few lookout towers that will help you with that, don‚Äôt even bother with Rose‚Äôs quest (top of the world) until you get to level 25-30.  It‚Äôs really a lot faster and you learn so much about the story that way.
---
On Xbox:
---
- Sign in takes longer than it should and a couple of times there has been errors.
---
- The news screen shows up in game before crashing.
---
- There's a collision with trying to put a roof over the top of the staircase (on full size walls).
---
I have done a full shut down of my console and it's still has long sign in and crashes in game, only played half hour before the news screen appeared then my game crashed.
---
I‚Äôll check it tomorrow and I‚Äôll boost my luck as well...
---
Did someone notice that, on one of the red computers in the military wing in Enclave Bunker there is a discussion log between MODUS and Vault 51's Zax?
---
They said 6 months from the requests were finished coming in, the requests were stopped 3rd of May, so most likely beginning of November.
---
If not enforcer, a good limb-damage weapon.
---
On my main melee I have an Instigating / Limb Damage railway rifle I use in a pinch. On another I have a limb damage cryolator. 
---
I generally carry at least one cripple / make land / helper weapon on every character. Sometimes it helps handle some irritating events / encounters and other times it helps everyone doing an event / raid.
---
All 3 times I did it I traveled to Gauley Mine and walked and it worked fine for me.  Only crashed once during the actual event, other 2 times worked fine.  And PA seems to be a trigger, 2 friends crashed hard going in with PA and we didn‚Äôt not wearing it.
---
Like all the other events...hardly worth the trouble...3 times y-day, 3  1* items from the bosses lol
---
The event doesn‚Äôt even work you can‚Äôt fill up the feeding troughs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòí great job Bethesda
---
Confirming this fixed my issue.
---
I noticed this too. But no other players around. Also I get detected alot more now so it seems
---
This ^ they remain friendly during and after the event.  You can‚Äôt kill them.
---
This personally helps me with caps: every day vendors reset their selling system which starts you out each day with 1,400 caps to obtain through selling them items; I will usually just go around and pick up every single thing I see and sell it if I don‚Äôt want it.  Through this I‚Äôve been steadily increasing my caps.  For food, water, and health there is categories in the luck perk section that let you search containers for extra supplies... you end up getting soooooo much more.  Also try and do lots of events for finding more plans, weapons, and armor.  Also as a side note; you should scrap all your junk that you want to keep so that it weighs less, you can scrap weapons to obtain mods for the same type of weapon (as in now when you get that weapon again you will have customization options), I would try and start the pioneer scout quest line soon because a lot of the objectives you will just naturally achieve over time.  Hope these help! Good luck! And I‚Äôm always happy to see another person enjoy this great game

Invest 3 points into enforcer in AGI. Get a shotgun - any kind, any level. Doesn't matter.
---
Fire wildly at it until you hear a funny noise. It will land.
---
Beat it to death with a boxing glove to show it who is boss.
---
It has been this easy since release. You should always carry a shotty - this works on Behemoths, Assaultrons, Mirelurk Queens, death claws......

Fleshed it out a bit, put a few alternative perks in and buffer up your mutations. Given your strength is base 1 you might as well take Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones and Egg Head. You get +6 Int, +4 Per, crit damage, fall speed and +4 Agl at the cost of a single point of Endurance.
---
Junkies
---
Or the max lvl 3* furious/explosive/ less vats AP cost black powder pistol. By the time your done reloading the darn thing ran away.
---
Start using a melee weapon too in the early stages. Still pick up all the ammo and keep it in your stash for later. If your on ps4 i will be able to give you a starter pack this evening. About 8 hrs from now
---
That's really good actually.
---
I fear no man. But that... thing...
---
It scares me.
---
This player knows what time it is. There isn't any reason for any other strategy.
---
There should be a punishment for people who do this, reduced reward or something
---
Add me and we can work together BHOhmygod
---
If my game didnt crash I'd love to play it
---
Let's make it Wednesday afternoon :)
---
I have no issue with op robots like fallout 4.
---
Maybe invisible ghouls? I got killed by them so many times i should farm antighoul gear.
---
Fast travel far away and enter a building with a loading screen. Then travel to Arktos again, worked for me.
---
Well that's one way to see it but IMO, camp buildings and sold items have in common, that they both have to be "saved" at the location where one placed the camp for other people to see. Unlike normal stash, that isn't available for others. So from a simple "saving data in the environment" perspective, it's not completely bullshit...
---
Might have to try that thanks.
---
dez gajm iz shiet nigga
---
Which is inevitable in all games, sure. But it never ends well because it tends to make all start content to easy and the end content crazy hard until you have correctly specced out for it. So we don't have to accelerate ithe power creep ourselves. Balancing will work to our advantage in the end.
---
Just did the messenger to Harpers Ferry and from start to almost finish (we failed) there was about 8-9 legendary enemies from super mutants to all types of anglers... after it was done I had 32 angler meat!...lol
---
Mine is 1250 if I‚Äôm going to bother, mostly because I‚Äôm lazy and use the bumpers to set the price, and that‚Äôs one of the break points. So 1250, 2500, 3750, 5000
---
I‚Äôm only selling ‚Äúdecent‚Äù items though.
---
I am not sure about that...
---
It did work pre-patch 9, it was only broken in the current patch level. Should not really be that time consuming to identify the changes that caused it and revert them or address them.
---
Please tell them to not just wait a week to fix it. Hotfix this at least
---
Most of the radstag meat in one zone you couldnt interact with to pick up - the dialog was there it just didnt do anything.    
---
Managed to fill the kelp one up though... but then the game crashed.
---
You really want anti-armor on shotguns, since they can't get armor pen easily. Two shot also raises the spread which you really don't want on a shotgun you plan to use at anything beyond point blank. Explosive is good for helping stuff connect but explosive shotguns recently got rebalanced to put them in line with other explosive weapons so they aren't devastating like before.
---
If invisible enemies we need MORE area damage and explosives to ensure they aren't getting the dps in. Because these friendlies don't heal üò©
---
Does diffuser heal em?
---
IT DOES NOT KILL THEM. I spent 5 Minutes shooting them. It does 0 damage. Stop spreading bs. The only exploding damage they can die from is the turrets
---
It doesn't and don't believe anyone who says it does.
---
Ain't that the truth. They can have broken atom challenges that won't work for weeks, yet someone finds a way to earn atoms fast and they'll fix it faster you can... wait ... they just fixed it =/
---
If your Xbox I could help you a bit with quests and stuff, I‚Äôm a level 130
---
The event has been really buggy for me. I get a freeze and have to restart the game almost every time, as has everyone I‚Äôve played with. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a factor. 
---
The few times it hasn‚Äôt crashed it‚Äôs failed because just like the Encryptid event, players aren‚Äôt understanding the instructions just yet. 
---
I‚Äôm basically backing off the event until they fix the crashes and people figure out how to play it. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone in that.
---
Yeah. I was -5 at one point. Sometimes I feel like any criticism of 76 is met with downvotes. I'm just like eh, a different color shouldn't be $10+.
---
Do you have the costume ?
---
Where did you find the code?
---
Clearly no one as they are still for sale.
---
I saw a lvl 35 One Star 50 cal for 1500 and it wasn‚Äôt even repaired like almost completely broken.
---
rip my 200 bulk lead's worth of plastic
---
Looks dam good
---
I sure hope this will work! If it does I‚Äôm throwing a big party at my CAMP with free drinks, plans and junk! Thanks!
---
I found the same guys a while ago and looked into it. I'm fairly sure there's not a wearable version. It's a shame as the gasmask version does look cool.
---
Great photo - much better than what I usually see on here.
---
Same but on ps4 I‚Äôm trying redownloading the game again currently 51gb grrrrrr
---
I'm so fed up with this bot finding me time after time so now I kill it when it turns up,may as well as I'm killing robots for atoms at the moment.
---
I shoot them üòé
---
I think you have to go for the scorched on the ground. Once they are dead they will land. At least I got the impression. Most of the times it works for me.
---
Why not make an active event its own "zone" like its done with other games. The game would then automatically fill it with all available layers up to a limit, say 5 players for a low level event per phase/zone.
---
Of course on top of that they would need a way to join an Event indipendent on if its active on your server.
---
Honestly the best option would be to make it like the LFG tool from WoW. You queue for the event you would like to do and it puts you in an instance with players that also wanted to do, that, ideally all in a close level range so no one one shots shits while you scurry after them and it would make the world feel less empty with actually something to do.
---
I like the events but going for one and then being alone or none starting at all that you want to do is just awful and takes away a real opportunity for instanced group content.
---
I've done the event three times and haven't had one crash
---
Had him pop up at withsprings once near the enclave main entrance to the right on the rocks right next to a guys Base I was like wtf.
---
What country are u in?
---
Dang I'm level 16, quick question are you on ps4?
---
What platform are you on?
---
Yeah it is pretty annoying
---
I hate people like that... whenever i see a player die that isnt an asshole (one shotting everything or trying to kill me somehow) i always revive them and if they die i leave their loot because this loot dropping is one of the most awful mechanics and i hate it to death. Its just a big time drain that makes a grindy game feel even more grindy.
---
You don't want to know just how upset I am right now. I can't fucking believe it
---
Australia.. the game worked fine this morning but now after I got back from work I can‚Äôt log in
---
Don't put hacker and lock pick on there just do this when you need them.
---
For melee you need some blocker and inciser for armor pen.
---
I used to program, but it has been a while. This could be easier than it seems, but in this kind of game that would not make sense. A large percentage of the players play melee. For this game to survive and for Zenimax to not shut it down they need to show profit. To show profit they need happy players who spread positive word of mouth and who buy Atoms.
---
Not fixing game breaking bugs if they are easy to fix goes against their own survival as employees. I just don't find it likely that something so important is an easy fix that they chose to ignore. Unless they dream of unemployment.
---
&gt;bare fist it
---
Here i go again... *sigh unzips pants*
---
You do not need to have a team before hand. I was alone and once the event started more people joined. Team only helps to co-ordinate your battle a bit more.
---
yeah 1 flux and 1 ultracite. But it increased the damaged for my BE by ~100
---
Exactly the same mate 7am this morning loaded up did a trade this started abt 2pm when I tried to trade.
---
I think it‚Äôs must be a server outage or something
---
I don‚Äôt have any points on fireproof or enforcer. I guess another 6+ levels to beat her.
---
Exactly happened to me as you described it so I‚Äôm trying down loading it again grrrrr
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôd quit too.
---
Thanks for all the great advice, I‚Äôm so looking forward to killing one.
---
Any chance someone may have gained unauthorised access to your account?
---
Not trying to 'put the blame' on you here, just thinking on possible explanations that are not that uncommon in 'online' games.
---
It's rng. I keep seeing "have they nerfed/buffed Whitespring" posts pop up lately. The answer is no, it rng, always has been. You might get none, you might get every ghoul give you something. I've even had some drop 2 items. 
---
The places listed are popular because they have a higher mod population so there is a greater chance of finding legendaries, that's all.
---
That's this game in a nutshell.
---
I'd say try logging out and back on, see if it clears, might just be a visual glitch. 
---
Otherwise you might consider opening case with bugthesda about it, that way it's on record it was unintentional. last thing you want is them thinking you intentionally duped and getting banned.
---
Shh don‚Äôt tell people our secrets üòÇ. I got 4 different jumpsuits from uranium fever a few months ago. Albeit I‚Äôve done the event countless times and it only happened once. So it‚Äôs like a jackpot at the slots! Lol.
---
When to whitesprings the other day to see what the vendee had and took a detour to the golf club and came out with 6 legendary's low level but worth the scrip.
---
West tek for me has been hit and miss there is normally 2 legendary's outside at the first part and sometimes one at the other side and maybe 3 inside if your lucky.
---
I reckon it‚Äôs their local severs. I‚Äôm trying to trade with this guy that needs to go to bed so f ing annoying let me know if downloading fixes it
---
I had a very similar the problem, if you're running Borderless try Fullscreen.
---
In fuken 3 hrs m8
---
Probably the handmade. It has a drum magazine which holds 80 rounds. I think the combat rifle only has a extended magazine at 30 rounds.
---
If you can collect legendary items then use the Purveyor at Berkeley this will give you a good chance to get a decent weapon set and armour. 
---
I roamed Morgan town railroad a lot. You can scrap a lot of guns there and learn their mods and also get a power armor frame and fusion cores. The enemies there are low lvl so you can get XP to lvl up yourself. Probably use a pump action gun from there for a while as get lots of shells there. There‚Äôs some food around in the caravan there. 
---
I lived off radstag, dogs and whatever I could find around Morgan town. As you lvl up get a raider power armor which you can get at lvl 15 Check the web it will tell you how to do this. This will will give you extra carry weight and protection as you are quite squishy at lvl 11.
---
Camp near a river and get a water purifier up as some as you can. Use boiled water which you can craft easily and this gives you lots of XP to lvl up.
---
Start to move out to wider areas on your missions. Whitesprings is good to get lots of lengendarys as you  lvl up but be around lvl 30-35 as it will be tough around there and get a good melee weapon like an Instigating supersledge if you can before you go there. You will need a lot in strength if you do this. But as you play you will need to decide the build you want. I‚Äôve gone Melee and Rifleman. Great for ranged and good in close.
---
Collect junk and sell and scrap it. I had to learn all the stations and vendors to get max caps each day. Now it‚Äôs easier as you only have to visit one to get your 1400 caps a day. Having caps means you can buy from player vendors food and water and also from Reddit users. Actually it‚Äôs so much easier now than it was in the old days - lol
---
Good luck
---
No idea, why you don't get markers, but I had them everytime so far.
---
I just haven't gotten to it yet, busy doing other things still
---
Just to be clear, this isn't some beginners mistake, is it? You're absolutely sure you weren't affected by something like adrenaline, drugs, or any other temporary boost like magazines that might have boosted your damage, and expired after a while?
---
Wrong!!!!!! The don't damage the friendlies. But nice try.
---
Yeah, with 50 cal balls =)))
---
You're right though, I think I will.
---
The bug was not on my character though, I was trading with my girlfriend and on her side it showed "**50 cal ball ()**" - no number
---
I asked her to drop it if possible and I will check it again tonight. Cheers !
---
As a Gen X'r, I listen to Nirvana and commit suicide on a weekly basis. Boomers said it would be better for society.
---
[](/celestiapout)The combat rifle's soul purpose in life is just to use up all the .38 ammo.
---
I've only done it a couple of times but they've been issue free runs but I've read a lot of problem reports so that puts people off but it's an event so won't be dead, just maybe needs a little fixing. Encrypted was a crashfest when released but people still show up on the rare occasion that starts, at least the new one has no entry requirements. The Burrows short life is because it's fairly small and only has one short quest so not much reason to return there. A shame really.
---
I saw someone else recommend or suggest the personal terminal can be used to select messages like group finder. Bethesda just needs to implement it. It's a good plan.
---
Unlocked with Arktos Pharma. using a stimpack applies to entire squad
---
Next post by Op: "Stop using explosive turrents!"
---
Mate I really think it‚Äôs server side coz I was able to get in after abt 10 tries at 2pm
---
Yes please.
---
I actually seen a couple of these posts
---
That 20% XP comes at a cost... I get 30,000 XP on average before I get gang banged...
---
I like the fact someone will come and hunt you down, its inevitable so its easy to prepare for. The Cranberry bog is the best place to farm XP and watch out for Hunters, has high places to scope people from a distance plus there are high level enemies around to block them on their way to you, 5/10 times a scrochbeast will give their location away if you hide near a fissure.

#GitGud
---
No worries m8 my fuken fault for deleting it
---
I literally read it that way
---
How would I know that exactly? I have scoured my email and nothing. None of my stats have been changed or altered in any way.
---
Link me a couple then. I can't find any
---
Ps4 too.
---
i got some really awesome duct tape from the 3\* i killed today at whitesprings :/
---
1. Lag fest CTD
---
2. Lag fest but completed...no legendary loot or did the melee ninja it
---
3. Not doing it again until it's fixed
---
4. Not doing it until upon completion the legendary loot is distributed via the quest reward.
---
I‚Äôm at work now. I was reading it before work so it was probably 7-10 hours ago if that helps. Made me decide to wait on event
---
Or a possible symptom of a mutation or disease?
---
Have you ever shared your login details with anyone?
---
Do you live alone? If you don't can someone in your household gain access to your PC/game without your knowledge?
---
Is your password unique or you have used it 'elsewhere'.
---
Is your password unique 'enough' or it could be easily guessed by someone who had had 'access' to you in the past.
---
Again, not saying this is 'on you'; the reports of 'disappearing gear' have been taken seriously enough to put them in the known-issue list by the devs however yours is the first account I see of someone logging in stark naked and the caps gone so there could be something else at play here.

Thinking issue might related ISPs international inter connectivity
---
This. I want this. I wanna be in a survivalist faction like the Free States but are actually Marxist-Leninist-Maoists planning a People's Protracted War in the heart of Capitalist America when the bombs fell
---
This also works with a sledgehammer. It removes the head of the hammer in case you were curious. Big beating stick.
---
Yeah, well maybe another bot then
---
I have never shared my login to anyone and yes I live alone. My password is unique and it couldn't be guessed. What do you mean by "something else at play?"
---
Been trying to sign in for past hour on PS4. Others having issues on PS4 too?
---
On ps4 having same issues
---
Higher levels do not make you stronger.  Any high damage weapon with zero legendary affixes and a VATS crit build completely breaks this game in every possible way.
---
Unfortunately, the solution here isn't asking players with good builds to not play them, it's asking Bethesda to get off their asses and do a combat balance on the game - because the complete and total lack of challenge coupled with the ease of 3/4 builds that require zero legendary items to dominate is the real problem here.
---
I just go to vendors and buy whatever I need.
---
That kind of event are no fun for me because = 10 fps
---
Yes, punish players for running a vats crit build.  Makes perfect sense.
---
This is legitimately probably one of the stupidest things written on this subreddit so far, and that's saying something.
---
Exactly.
---
Blocking someone does not work like that in this game.  Good luck blocking everyone running a vats crit build.  It's totally their fault, not the designers and their lack of attention to game balance, right?
---
Itsmore rarebut also works for the bone club. I got a three star legendary yesterday.
---
Considering once you are at three digits all enemies are low level enemies, and crits/melee builds hilariously break the game, this isn't any players fault.  Blame the game and its abysmal combat, not the player that figured out a good build.  Zero legendaries are required to 1-shot nearly anything in the game.
---
Spoiler: Physical copies for any game are often cheaper than digital.
---
And remove stealth boys
---
this is legit one of the many issues i keep getting , closing the camp build and reopening it fixes it for a very very short period. Im hoping when we do eventually get the camp building update itll be fixed
---
Are... you playing the same game?  The Sheepsquatch and Imposter, and now even the SBQ can be killed in seconds.  It takes players with good builds paying attention instead of the 99% tryhard population toting around shit with their glass cannon "DPS" builds.
---
I have a feeling this is exactly what Nuclear Winter mode will be. I have a feeling itll be recommended for level 50+ or legendary players.
---
BoS hood + Silver shroud coat here.
---
Overwatch did something like this, where promotional material for one of the Christmas events showed two winning poses that weren't actually available in the game. When people asked where they were Blizzard apologized and added them, insta-unlocked, for free. I get that Bethesda made a mistake but I don't know why they didn't own up to it and accept that it happened and move on
---
wear mine with the BoS hood + Silver shroud coat here.
---
This worked for me thanks.üòÅ
---
Just exploring possible explanations to your predicament other than your save getting corrupted in such a specific - and unique at this point although maybe I will go back home after work and find myself in your shoes, who knows - fashion.
---
It could be based on your points in that special stat. Maybe 1 passive for every 2 points of special.
---
That's why they've done it.
---
For a cat, there is a static spawn in the Mire.  I can't remember the name exactly but it is a new farm that was added for the Free Range event.  Slightly South East of Southern Belle Motel.
---
The large majority of Ubisoft doesn't work on their big AAA games, that's almost entirely Montreal which is a relatively small studio in comparison
---
Well I've started getting some riflemen cards for it now, and its going to take a lot of shop browsing to find a TSE for it! lol
---
I was having a go with it last night and its pretty good to use with a few trigger pulls to kill most enemies. 
---
For the perks, Commando would not work on the handmade unless I made it automatic? I doubt I will go for them if that's the case as its very bullet thirsty upon testing as it is lol
---
Now im getting ‚ÄúFailed to download config from Tile Storage‚Äù. WTF does that mean?
---
Thank you for helping. Such a shitty situation
---
I thought I'd conditioned myself against that but then it happened again the other day. I try to ensure I go direct to the vendor but I'm so easily distracted. I think my school reports said as much!
---
May I ask what camera you use day to day? Cause I get the impression you know your way around the real deal haha  
---
At the Encryptid event, whilst trying to stay alive, I couldn't help but think of a kind of Fallout Journalist...its way too fun taking shots of people mid battle for any good !
---
Like science increases energy weapon durability and ammo smith could make you quicker at reloading your guns. I like this idea.
---
#*THE EMPIRE HAS COME*
---
Why
---
Yeah I couldn't find a lot of the glowing things. So I launched a nuke on prime and the come flooding out as adds. It's great. While everybody else is hulk smashing and pew pewing, I made myself a minigame to take pictures of the ones I need before they get killed. 
---
8/10 I would get to them first, this is important because even if I didn't get to them before they were obliterated, I could get pictures of the dead bodies that counted... Except for when bloody mess procs the bodies to blast into millions of pieces. Then the camera won't recognize the creature. 
---
The hardest one was the damn glowing mirelurk Hunter. I seent it two other times before, but I was in kill mode and bloody mess the first one. Second time it fell through the ground after I killed it. Lol. 
---
It's most certainly an awkward challenge. But what I did notice is that there are far more than 76 on the total number of creatures that count. We just have to get 76 of em. Now for the other challenge where I gotta kill 10 rabbits... I saw a whole field of em and then they disappeared right in front of my eyes! Still pending that one.
---
Super hardcore would be simply being actually punished for dying, like loosing one level everytime you die. Implement this single aspect and even the vanilla adventure mode becomes extremely challenging.
---
Don‚Äôt do it alone, make sure there‚Äôs some high levels in your game.
---
Are you suppose to kill them or just to find them?
---
Your title looks like a fan-fiction of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
---
One thing i want: a fallout 76 version of fallout Frost. Gas mask or pa mandatory, more dangerous fights.
---
A totally new game mode, with mechanics similar to the dark zone of the division.
---
I feel like I've seen one in Charleston before in the mayor's office. ü§î
---
Hey man, from a level 56, just want to say  fuuuuck you douchebag. 
---
I see you in game, I‚Äôm fuckin your shit up every time, dick.
---
You can say that. I would have to make some serious reassessment of how I play if I were in your shoes.
---
I have toons 'built around' certain gear. Reverting to T-60/All Rise while I 'pick myself up' would be quite the pain barrier to cross.
---
A complete list of creatures I've photographed but not got credit for (*typical*) so far:
---
* Mutant hound
---
* Mothman
---
* Glowing radstag
---
* Glowing wolf
---
* Glowing mole miner
---
* Albino radstag
---
* Albino radtoad
---
* Legendary mirelurk
---
* Legendary radscorpion
---
* Legendary scorched
---
The imposter Sheepsquatch or the real one? If its the real one a weapon with a high damage output is all you will need... For the imposter a team of some hard-core dudes will be needed.
---
I can put a all the Sheepsquatch varients down in 7-10 shots with a BE lever and the right perks attached.
---
Haha, just the 105mm. A Fallout Journalist sounds like a really good time. Piper's great-great-great-grandmother?
---
I have been back and it has been a great place for pictures plus I'm often the only person there. So for days where I want to roam around on my own, it's not a, bad place. Just a bit small.
---
It most likely still is. They didnt remove them from my base.
---
I have work HARD for that love... I regret some things... but hey, it still worth it!
---
I can see why that would be upsetting.
---
But atleast they're fixing the real problems.
---
CAT BUSH
---
Or just more songs
---
It's already been said but I'll say it again...if it's the imposter make sure you have high levels on your server because he's tanky as hell. Think of it like the scorchbeast queen. It's kind of a pointless fight if you don't have the right folks. 
---
If it's the regular sheepsquatch, he's squishy as hell. But stay high unless you're melee and tanky because when he hits it hurts.
---
fake news
---
I was thinking exactly this concern yesterday. My conclusion was that as long as the limits for turrets are kept, all you realistically get is more fancy building. 
---
Water farming is not the most efficient way to get caps, so I don't think allowing people do more of it would realistically influence the economy.
---
Unfortunately not. Just a big ol'.... "Screw you, you don't get your screws back!" ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Foreign translation are a mess.
---
Some aspect of the game are unplayable as is.
---
I agrer
---
A unique and original design for clothes? üò© Seems to good to be true 
---
I loved being able to customize my armor on swtor. Even down to tertiary colors on accents. Was awesome
---
I had three crashes until I used the method mentioned. Don't fast travel there, fast travel to a nearby location and walk. Worked fine after this.
---
So I sent a ticket to Bethesda. Support guy is going to send the ticket up to see if it can be resolved. I sent 4 screenshots proving I indeed have shit. Even the photo I took of the level 100 Grafton at the end of the new event. Crossing my fingers, but knowing my luck, won't help
---
Ok Think you‚Äôre speculating a bit... and it wasn‚Äôt nerfed by 75%, it went from 90 to 60 as far as i remember. As for repair kits, why buy the worse repair kits when you get better ones in game? I have 25 improved ones without trying. Repairing stuff to 100% is never worth it
---
U RANIUM U RANIUM U RANIUM U RANIUM! That is really all you need honestly.
---
I had a sentry bot explode upon death. I thought to myself, that's unusual. So I walked over there to loot it and then it exploded again and I died. I thought to myself, that's unusual.
---
I've had it for over 500+ hours... I've just hit 600+...
---
well im not sure which one i will come across with tbh. i just read the poster and now following the questline.
---
I'm pretty sure it takes 7 screws too make a hand made rifle and get none back when I scrap, it's a bit ruff.
---
okay then thanks
---
After the first challange of 40 Atoms it's 'mod 1 handed mele weapons' for another 40.
---
That's 80 Atoms I don't see where you get the rest from?
---
got it, thanks!!!
---
The imposter one, yeh you won't do it alone. Once the final event triggers for it, people will join you anyway. I'd read up on what you have to do as still people don't understand how to manage conduits.
---
So I found that you can make foundations stack now again. Not as much as before, and not free form, but still I managed to get myself a nice castle with a few layers of hidden floors. Its not a bugged indestructible camp - it could be but I didn't want it.
---
The idea is that top open floot is workshop, bottom floor is a bar and basement is utility room where players shouldn't have access. Obviously, players now spawn inside of basement which they have no unlocked exit out of.
---
I will change some of the floors I used to foundations. I guess this will kick the spawn point upwards.
---
What‚Äôs that mask!? How do i get it?!?
---
Any one else finding the tse are just as powerful and prevalent as before, after the updates?
---
I love it as well. We need an outfit station with different armor slots so we can put on shoulder pads and stuff, and with armor mods that change color AND design, there is so much potential.
---
I really hope that you get some form of satisfaction from them.
---
In my mind 'reverting to a previous save', although it may 'wipe' your progress in the event yesterday, should be achievable.
---
They must have some kind of backup system so even if they refuse to restore individual items under the pretense that they can't in cases as egregious as yours they can... hmmmm... 'do better'.
---
I've noticed the quest items will only drop 1 or 2, but are not instanced like the other loot. This was done intentionally to prevent excessive feeds. If 10 ppl hit one radstag and get 2 each, there won't be much of a challenge filling them up. That's why they throw droves of em at you to handle the business. 
---
Best thing to do in these instances is rather than the normal cluster loot around the dead body, set teams up to cover different sections where the animals spawn from and each team loots their own sections and kills. Drops off. Goes back. Works like a charm.
---
I do. After a million loop I turned off. Even the "silence" is better.
---
My Bloodied SS powerfist, only down side, cant use it in PA, but for that i bring out my good ol 1* Bloodied grognaks üòÖ also found my new fav for my main ( rifleman ) , 3* Bloodied Piperevolver-rifle + FFR and Weight reduction, but for the Main when shit gets real, Bloodied + Vatshit + critmeter fill gauss rifle,  1k dmg easypeasy
---
Two shot never shot another whole shell, two shot was nerfed few months ago to increase guns base damage by 25% instead of 100%.
---
Yeah I can appreciate the preloaded plans they have for paints. But really the best thing is to be able to make our own styles. I haven't bought a single paint for regular armor or weapons. I think I got one in a bundle, but haven't even applied it yet.
---
Don't fast travel to the place. Fast travel to a site slightly further away and walk the rest of the way. Fixed it for me.
---
[](/angrytia)Killing things to upbeat 50s music is pretty entertaining for a while, but after a while I just get sick of it.  
---
What I'd really love is the option to use the ambient music from the older installments. [FO76's ambient music is just a bit too upbeat for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XczL-NLzVrk&amp;list=PLe0EamRrnC6QMqcXEuT9nxsWFHJIGodzr&amp;index=2), it doesn't give me the overbearing dread of walking the state sized grave plot of Appalachia.  
---
[Some of the older songs used to be overbearing enough to make me feel like the world already died.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW3DTCIO5Zs&amp;list=PL58427501A0AD8A2C&amp;index=2&amp;) The jury is still out on weather wanting that feeling is a bad thing.
---
I don‚Äôt care if it reverts my event progress, I just want all my shit back. Just some days ago, I acquired the sheepsquatch helmet to complete the outfit and now it‚Äôs gone. Gonna try to be positive, hopefully it won‚Äôt be long. Guy told me characters are saved on the server
---
The advanced power connectors are pain and resource and budget intensive. I tried to look this up when I was exploring the alternative to strings going across the place. I get stuff like you said lol.
---
Well well well, Hello there üòà
---
Combatrifle uses .45s,  unless ive missed a reciever
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt buy armor skins. I focus mostly on the modifications. Like combat armor, when you ‚Äúreinforce‚Äù it, it changes the color and it actually looks like it‚Äôs been reinforced. Stuff like that are the things I think they did right with 76
---
There is indeed a 38 receiver, and an auto 38 receiver.
---
Wont that decreese its dmg? 
---
And thanks for response bud ü§ü
---
Jes*s christ here s another one....yes for f*ck sake yesssss!!!!!!buy the f*ckng game its awesome!!
---
[](/clop12)It sure does, but getting any damage out of 38 is worth it, you wouldn't use it for a Sheepsquatch, but it's great for killing trash mobs without wasting valuable ammo. It's the thriftiest weapon in an arsenal.
---
So tired of this question alllll the time
---
Happen to me 3 hrs ago on ps4 in Australia I‚Äôm currently re down loading the game after I deleted all the data to see if that will fix it have 71 minutes left to see if it works
---
Yeah I‚Äôm having the same Problem in Australia on Xbox, but my mate is able to login no problem
---
Ye m8 can‚Äôt give you any answers till after this bloody download
---
Alright, that‚Äôs all good
---
This is amazing! Beautiful done!
---
Just turn it OFF?
---
If you can afford the space, how about vending machines in each of the four legs to be evil? :)
---
I've managed to get it on 2 accounts. I think the camera in general is still a bit glitchy as there's a few challenges that haven't registered without relogging but it is doable.
---
What is your luck/charisma? I'm getting [all sorts of numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=2122967287) and it can be hit-and-miss for hours.
---
Give it a day at least!  There has been many cases of crashes, the event was up when in europe was already early evening. 
---
Don't comlare it to the burrow,that was an area with a quest like any other location.  This one is an event and everyone will join everytime for at least a week.
---
If I remember right theres a refined receiver that does the most damage.
---
[Does this one work?](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survival_(Fallout_76\))
---
r/empiredidnothingwrong
---
Aye, this happens with wooden always.
---
Aww man!! Really want a Bloodied pipe revolver.... Damn. Yeh I never understood why they made the PowerFist unable to be worn over power armor. The things go hand in hand.
---
I have like no damage resistance so that's the main problem, but I usually don't die that much. It's all the damn robots plus my shitty resistance that causes me to die repeatedly when I do it. I always make it through but damn I need a bunch of respawns
---
Thanks for the reply, at least I know and I'll trade any wooden armour straight back in.
---
My 1* bloodied handmade and my bloodied combat knife. Got both really early on, way before I could use them. They are the two weapons that I roll with all the time. 
---
Could there be a better roll for a combat knife on a bloodied build, that has 40% swing speed and +1 strength also?
---
I'll calm down now.
---
Radstorm.
---
You have to be brave and get stuck in. Try to have no junk else you will lose it. Turn off auto stimpack as you will lose too many Stimpacks as you can die a lot. Work together. Some being conduits able to run fast and others hitting hard when the imposter is vulnerable. It
---
I doubt it will, since I‚Äôve spawned many times inside foundations in some CAMPs. Players might also spawn inside a foundation if you do so.. let me know how it turns out!
---
Use a Hunter's or Zealot's weapon, equip the Fireproof perk and possibly a PA. When they land, strike its face. Zealot's Prime and Executioner's Prime works exceptionally well against them. 
---
If you lack legendary ranged weapon (not sure how, gamble with the Purveyor), just use as many weapon specific perk cards as you can afford and anti-armor perk cards such as Tank Killer or Stabilized. 
---
Perforating magazine could also help somewhat. Also make sure you shoot at them from as close as possible because they tend to fly 150-200 feet away, just at the edge of most ranged weapons and you'd do fraction of the damage.
---
I did the sheepquatch event but I didn't even had time to touch him once because I was the noob with the croock and two high level players killed him instantly, I saw him and by the time I was close enough his head popped away. Damn that was sad.
---
wow are the grenade plans still there? whats yr ign?
---
carry a hunting rifle,but MUST have peircing mag. just pick your shot rather than spray the air with bullets. a l55 can been brought down or killed in 25 rounds.
---
if you can withstand the acid attacks, get rid of the scorched first, but they will of cource respawn,but they do more damage than the beast if you let them.
---
having said that, I'm rifle build, with 60% on rifles. If you have the strenth, then a combat shotgun may be better, again MUST HAVE peircing mag and hardened. And there light.
---
someone else had theory about NOT firing at a certain point when it flags that its going to land.
---
the fissure across the road leading from charleston to whitespring is a great spot to practice. l55's all day long.
---
My 3* Junkies Fire Axe, with Swing Speed and +1 Agility. She‚Äôs nothing fancy but she gets the job done and has saved my ass more times than I care to count.
---
Stripping for Exalts? That might count as RMT tho.
---
That's awesome dude. How did you build 4+ stories.
---
My castle has 4 maybe 5 but top isn't accessible
---
I didn't notice any hints about the smoking stuff being feed. I saw one of the goo piles and tried to pick some up but nothing happened, although the event hadn't started. Anyway, thanks for making this post!
---
Anything that would stop them making money &gt; anything that would disrupt the clients enjoyment of product
---
oh yeah :D
---
It takes like 5 seconds to make a smurf account, and like 5 minutes to transfer gear over to it. You can‚Äôt take down someone‚Äôs store just because they sell something you don‚Äôt want them to. There is nothing Bethesda can do, especially since their game lacks the tools needed to catch dupers and the like.
---
yep
---
I can't
---
I tried to add like 12 pieces of fragrant venison but the counter never changed from '0/3'
---
Definitely wouldn‚Äôt hurt. I absolutely LOVE this game and think it‚Äôs only getting better with the new content. However, some pretty harsh bugs have arisen lately and my game hard crashes at least once a session now. (PS4) It‚Äôs a bummer, but some free items/caps/Atoms would be nice for sticking it out.
---
This though...
---
Every time I bulk something I go out and scrap it again. Even if something like how you can't scrap favourites is implemented I'd go through and scrap individual things manually
---
I still haven't been able to log the wolf in the Mammalogist badge :( Maybe it's me?
---
Havent done this yet. How is the food gathered?
---
Im wondering if green thumb works if its picking plants or butchers bounty if you get them from killing mobs.
---
a bloodied vats chance handmade..
---
i named her !A Problem Solver
---
only call her name when facing Big Bosses ;)
---
I'm too cool to get killed. I am the alpha boss.
---
I have a forest chest piece with the effect on it, bought it from another player
---
Seems like we'll need to frame everything that way now..
---
"Bethesda I won't be buying camp parts if I can't build do to Nothing is Selected, can't remove part, etc."
---
They patched that.
---
"MUH
---
MUH
---
MUH TWO SHOT EXPLOSIVE LEGENDARY"
---
God damn, shut up.
---
I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel like back in November/December I was seeing the "Double" legendary effect on ranged weapons showing up about what you'd expect from any other effect. However, I haven't had a single "Double" weapon drop for me since December/January, and I play for at least three to five hours a day.
---
I'm wondering if that effect has somehow just stopped showing up on new drops.
---
Damn. Thanks. That was not obvious at all.
---
You should watch the most viewed fallout 76 video this month with over 5 million views. It‚Äôs by the Internet historian. Look it up!
---
Better than it‚Äôs ever been ain‚Äôt hard coming from where we started.
---
A simple option like ‚Äúdelete all of this selected type?‚Äù Or maybe just have a section for all placed items in camp with however many of that item kinda like the stored tab that‚Äôs already in game would be great haha.
---
Probably were. If you have a 3* tse shotgun with the third effect being reduced weight or reload speed it‚Äôs a dupe, most tse handmades are dupes, any legacy explosive laser sold for less than 10-15k is a dupe, etc.
---
Oh boy. More dumb Fortnite shit.
---
That fog crawler is tough. The sheepsquatch thought? It died in like under 60 seconds. So many people were spamming it with explosive (TSE?) weapons. And there I was feeling a bit weird slashing it with my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.
---
don't forget to save one of your bladed weapons to kill scorched! kill 76 for an additional 40 atoms
---
Same.
---
I could crash it for you, just hand me the keys and I‚Äôll see what I can do!
---
There is only one alpha and that's me!
---
Pretty lame. Nothing "Appalachian" about it whatsoever.
---
I would make it much much more brutal. I want to see lvl 10s getting the drop on lvl 70s for some caps. I think sikll should be involved but right now its just time spent playing... Meh still more fun if your worried jumpy cunt will show up to ruin your day.
---
I'm dutch: i read the word 'free atoms' and my pointer was already at the upvote button!
---
Thnx man! You're the real mvp!
---
I was thinking about this last night. I haven't tested it, but as our character data is stored locally it may be possible to 'save scum'.
---
The PS4 has a built in back up feature that allows you to make a copy of the saved data to the cloud or an external device. 
---
I used to use this in Dark Souls to trade gear to my newer characters. After trading with a friend I'd reload the last backup and effectively duplicate the items. I have to wonder if that works for Fallout 76? 
---
I'm just curious, I don't have the friends to trade with even if I wanted to try it! Besides that possible exploit though it may be worth testing?
---
Oh dear.... time to park an alt on the server and wait for the sound of rads... where's a good spot? East side of the forest?
---
Can‚Äôt log in otherwise I‚Äôll give you one on ps4
---
I‚Äôm constantly getting wood table plans from workshops.
---
Very useful list, though it does omit two of my personal favourites: Sweet Mutfruit Tea and Blight Soup. Both offer a tasty 20% buff to critical damage!
---
I've been having an issue lately with Resolute Veteran where, in many cases, as I fire at a mob with a reasonable health pool it actually starts to regain health. I end up having to switch to another weapon to actually kill it. I haven't tried with a normal gatling and I haven't tried post this most recent update.
---
sry . I forgot to mention that I'm on pc. :P
---
Yeah I guess I have to agree to disagree. Just literally did Free Range, saw at least two other Explosive weapons, everything went as smooth as can be.
---
It may be a bit too NRA sounding, but it ain't the gun, it's the operator on this one bud.
---
And just from looking at that ghoul that was stood twenty yards away lol.
---
No problem
---
It happens fairly often so probably like a 25% chance
---
Depends on what the star is. I don't even bother selling trash stars, personally. If it's not a good item, just junk it.
---
Sometimes you gotta flex on poors.
---
You imply that all dupers want to sell their dupes. A lot of us just dupe ammo and maybe a gun or two for our buddies.
---
Maybe just all the walls made of radios lol
---
You sure it wasn't "Another settlement need your assistance...". ?
---
A nuke zone in not a rad storm though.
---
Get good
---
This one should be extra dead.
---
It doesn't say rad storm, though, it just says stormy weather.
---
If you're on PS4, I've got domestic tables at my vendor for 100. It has an end table. Jay_31_
---
I was wondering about that myself; I'm otherwise pretty close to finishing the leatherworking challenge set, but this one had proven elusive. I guess now I know why.
---
Happened to me before patch in whitespring golf club. But it is extreme at project paradise.
---
Yeah I'm curious about this, too. I tried a few times earlier and didn't get credit.
---
You and I can get them from quests and grinds. It may take time but if you want a guarantee right now weapon ... risk some stimpack for the item.
---
On xbox
---
Nope, no consumables or mutations
---
Only one way to find out...
---
Campfire has been patched for a long time. :(
---
*Hello Scorchie, Scorchie, Scorchie, I've got a treat for you.*
---
She will land immediately.
---
Welcome to the club. We meet on Thursdays.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
Honestly even if they change it to 100 caps per death max you should be carrying at least 1k on you its easy to make that in a day but buy out the vendors. If you die 10 times in a row without killing somone you are doing something very wrong or your gear is no where near up to par. Its just bs you can walk into survival with no caps nothing to lose at all.
---
While I appreciate the suggestion the point of this post isn't to get me to set up and camp then wait for people to come to me, the point is the make other play styles more viable.
---
I can‚Äôt fault you saying that... but I do like playing the game, just not the hours it would take for me to be able to shoot my mg42.
---
Me too dude me too
---
Pretty sure the Harpers ferry or Watoga station vendors sell these. Grahm also can sell them, I got mine from him.
---
Dont think they spawn in the wild or anything, but I could be wrong.
---
I think the point here is what qualifies as a serious issue.  If it's something that affects the customers, it's not serious enough to address.  If it affects the company, that shit's gonna get patched real quick.
---
People getting a few free atoms should not be considered more serious than many of the issues we've all faced with this game.
---
define 'help'.
---
I might jus do it make a big room and have radio's for wallpaper lolüòÇü§£
---
I seriously hate that "I didnt know the gun was loaded" song... I dont listen to the radio because of it.
---
There isn't a static spawn for this plan. You can find them in random locations like toolboxes, but you can also find a bunch of other plans.  
---
You can buy these plans from vendors like the one in the Watoga Shopping Plaza.
---
I need a camera picture of a player wearing full mistress of mysterious outfit. :)
---
Man that sucks. Your pic reminds me about how I log in naked and normally level 1 for about 30 seconds every time, but eventually the server catches up. 
---
I really hope support can help you, but if not maybe the community can help you get some stuff?
---
Thanks, I'll go check them out.
---
This is where i dont understand, i've tried to take a shot in a "classic rain and lightning" weather in the forest zone , no succes.  I've not found a rad storm out of nuke zone but yeah, maybe it's that, even if it seems i'd read on a patch note that nuke zone are now a "rad storm" for all the photos challenges ( after players complains about how rare and difficult rad storm can be to found ).
---
Anyway, if someone find the solution, please share, it can help others peoples, i'll do so if i finally found the answer ! ;)
---
Think the Whitesprings Station vendor has brick metal &amp; barn, or the actual names of those. Seems to stock building plans &amp; walking cane only (odddddd)
---
Ah okay thanks for the help, I will probably buy the plan and then find it somewhere lol
---
You SAID you wore PROTECTION ... WTF?
---
Honestly you are setting yourself up to have a bad time if you rock up with a low level character, survival is meant to be end game content. If you want to show up with a level 20 go for it , but expect a bad time. As a level 20 you should be playing avoid the fights most of the time not picking them. Tired of this "cater to all mind set" The game caters to you by letting you enter it, you shouldn't get awarded for participation in a survival mode you should be brutally punished for no excelling. That's what survival mode is for: the try hard PVP community. Not for the random level 20 guy that rocks up with a pipe pistol.
---
Anti armor handmade
---
Is there anything in the game you cannot do without having an extra buff? *Apart from the Queen and the Imposter.*
---
There are plenty like this
---
My AAE Handmade, I‚Äôll always stay with her.
---
I've actually seen more rad storms in the last couple patches, I think they upped the possibility of one. Hopefully we see at least one this week, and that will make the thing work.
---
Hey man thanks I appreciate the love, thanks for the laugh good to know they rage quite love that shit. It's just assassin sentinel gear nothing special, not as good as it used to be but still decent.
---
&gt;Costmetic salt shaker: Only 500 Atoms.
---
That's the best bet unfortunately. It also happens with the Assaultron head if you get one of those.
---
Was hoping this would be on the list of things fixed...:/
---
You have committed a thought crime. This game is the best fallout ever. All criticisms are trolling, all deleted equipment is user error, PvP is bullying, all evidence of crashes and glitches is anecdotal. 
---
Repeat after me: 'In Bethesda we trust.... x5'
---
Noice, thanks dude
---
Wow this game gets worse and worse every time I go on it. Patching useful glitches, nerfing everything, increasing the grind, putting none cosmetic stuff in the store
---
When will this game just die and put me out my misery
---
Noice, thanks dude!
---
I'm sorry, for starters I'm not a smart person, so with that in mind, can you explain that to me?
---
I feel like I just hear the same 5 songs over and over again. Haven't heard country roads in weeks.
---
I found a 1* Furious Handmade lvl 45 at lvl 40. I have never run the rifle perks as im full melee but at lvl 130 now i feel insanely lucky to have that thing. Kinda scares me how good it is just plain.
---
Anything that can be used for crafting should be protected as well. Basically, anything that has a purpose other than being scrapped for materials should have to be manually scrapped. 
---
The downside is that you‚Äôd have to take an extra second or two manually scrapping things every once in awhile. The upside is that nobody has to screw themselves over for no reason anymore. Kind of a no-brainer.
---
Yea seems like i can't unlock the Grafton Dam either.
---
Good job Bethesda.
---
They patched that but allowed single layer floating foundations provided your first one is on the ground, so you can put one down and then build off the edge of a cliff
---
Yeh I have 2 BE handmades, one automatic and the other semi lol. That said one is for sale to now. Got one with a better roll.
---
The one place I've found the plan in the wild (non-workshop), was outside the Gym by Flatwoods.
---
There's a Plan spawn there, but it's random as to what you'll get.
---
Scratching my head, frankly a modded non-legendary gauss was my go to for ages.
---
Still have yet to find a "epic" replacement, have a furious &amp; an instigating (which is a force to be reckoned with) that I rely heavily on but nothing thus far has the hours.
---
I did have a 2 shot bolt action pipe that carried me on my first character for ages, was a level 20...now worth 5 scrip
---
Yeh I tried the junkie build after patch 8 or 9 but didn't really work as I had most addictions and my special was low as fuck lol.
---
Seems so minor, they said it would be fixed last big patch. Dunno what they did that broke it before.
---
Yeah I'm level 250+ and still haven't found locations apparently
---
Lol yeh got some right names for my guns, a tad nerdy but appropriate I think.
---
Thats my point also. Dont want spawn-fucking on stations? Define a better battleground.
---
Oh, I never thought of that.
---
Ahh yes the AA handmade is definitely a Pvp head popper, great gun.
---
Yeh I have one, had the double vats version but traded it in, regret it a bit but I don't cry as often as I did. Especially since it got duped heavily.
---
They did make Radstorms more frequent but still quite rare, think it was in last week's Inside the Vault.
---
Not sure if you're aware, but Free Range in particular may not require much server hopping; you can cause the event to start by simply showing up at one of its spawn points. 
---
If I ever get around to doing Encryptid, I'm going to hire your little group like mercenaries ;)
---
Furious is good, try it some time. You can kill a sentry bot (L60) with a few shot wihh the right perks. Even less in hidden mode.
---
ah.....sorry, can't help with that.....cheers
---
nope.
---
yep, that's true that in that radio is something wrong
---
Doesn‚Äôt count if you discovered this locations in the beta. Create another character and discover them.
---
Indeed, or atleast they can make that if we are not wering PA right arm we can equip unarmed
---
doesn't work sadly
---
Would this effect stack with anything else? Like grape mentats
---
I think it depends more on your build than your level. Both my characters are above level 100. I've got a stealth sniper who is just useless... she is too squishy to be of much good. My other character is a power armor wearing, heavy gun toting tank who can handle all three pylons at once (or at least he thinks he can). As long as you're not too squishy you'll be an asset. Just pay attention to the mechanics.
---
Passive non combat cards need to happen, it's such a chore to swap out cards back and forth for fixing weapon and armour and such.
---
All it does is waste time.
---
Trying something like that right now
---
if it's only 120 atoms it's unlikely they'll bring the servers down. if it was infinite, they would do it as soon as they found out. context matters a lot.
---
I dunno, I'm having a ton of fun with it, personally. 
---
As for the down voting I think there's bots or something cause everything seems to get down voted. Even stuff with only positive posts. I don't get it otherwise.
---
It‚Äôs the same for me. I‚Äôve joined the event and when we were fighting final boss the game crashed and freezed. Now I can‚Äôt re-join the event bc of crashing
---
I just tried to do a rebuild yesterday after the arkos pharma update. /U Bethesda totally reverted camp updates. You can no longer build through small obstacles like you could before the update the 21 may. I have a tower base and can no longer build it the way I'd like to. No problems doing this before the update yesterday.
---
But you can name characters with the same name I've two Archers and two Berserkers.
---
I still remember that I was logging in the beta, I was one of the first inside. I wanted to create a char with a cool name so it can't be taken...
---
Its absurd that they said they fixed this two weeks ago and it doesnt work. Theres no way im hanging out in survival all week literally waiting for a rare green cloud to spawn. wtf
---
You sound surprised.
---
Any bug that makes it easier for the players to progress in any way will be nuked.
---
Any bug that hinders player progress will be left untouched, (or called a "Feature"), so we have to play longer to achieve our goals.
---
Maybe it's just a case of Easy Fixes get Fixed, but we all know that isn't always the case.
---
Good info, and after playing it once, it checks out xD.
---
When I gone (roughly 4h after maintenance finished) there was only one guy there, not knowing or figuring out what to do. It took me some time, but I figured out the food thing etc.
---
Yeah, just bloatflies spawned, and the event failed easily. I am reading all kind of feedback, like people claiming they have been able to do it with a mate or a small group, and people claiming they failed even with 10 people there, and a lvl 2 defender animal. Will have to check again, problem is the low people...
---
Yeh I just got rid of my furious handmade, it was a great weapon but next to some of guns I've obtained it felt a little mediocre.
---
Not parting with my hard earned atoms until I know what wood it is... it better be maple don't want some dodgy softwood when a deathckaw is trampling all over it!!
---
Plus... who likes softwood... your wood has to be hard right?! So in summary Bethesda, if you are going to give me wood, make it hard.
---
Wait till you come to the bog lol
---
Spoiler: 2/5
---
I don't think they'll actually bring the servers down over this.  I just felt like your original comment framed this as being a more serious problem than the other bugs that we've been dealing with.
---
Thanks for this guide, can be really useful!  
---
My experience with this has been rather bad xD as when I gone (roughly 4h after maintenance finished) there was only one guy there, not knowing or figuring out what to do. It took me some time, but I figured out the food thing etc.
---
Yeah, just bloatflies spawned, and the event failed easily.  
---
 I am reading all kind of feedback, like people claiming they have been able to do it with a mate or a small group, and people claiming they failed even with 10 people there, and a lvl 2 defender animal.   
---
Will have to check again, problem is the low people...Maybe it could have been made in another way? Instanced? Group finder / matchmaking? Server wide notification like encryptid?  
---
As it is now, I can't believe, one day after its release, I am already doubting I will be able to complete it, as a solo player. Maybe if I server hop like mad and or spend most of the time checking the event....
---
i miss three dog...

I don't want camping to the the only strategy I see no matter where it is, whether its at my camp or at a train station

You‚Äôve just answered it for me, I‚Äôve been complaining for so long about the incessant toxic downvoting and I didn‚Äôt think it could be bots
---
Team mechanics are still broken for PC. You generally have to exit to the main menu to team up which is annoying. But even if you do, most of the time your team mates status will not appear on screen, you can't share looted bodies unless everyone gets a shot in. Strange in Numbers does not work, perk card sharing does not work. This was sporadic until patch 9 bit seems to be fully broken now. The only way to tell you are on a team is via the social menu.
---
I'll go check it out! Thank you
---
A wonder i haven't mutated into a rad worm myself up to now.
---
Upvoted for visibility
---
Then select a battleground where there is no possibility of camping ;)
---
I'm not suggesting bunkering up. I'm suggesting i.e. taking people to cranberry glade for low-visibility no-high-point PvP in swamp area.
---
Thanks for this guide, can be really useful!

So I think we must raise awareness about its issues so Beth can fix it asap; either implement server wide notification or the other not so easy to implement fixes.
---
pass me a slice Michelangelo
---
Theres specific sections of the map for certain levels but that being said, i believe its all RNG. Ive seen only level 5 and 10 super mutants at "high" level areas. I feel like the level 20-40 range is the roughest part of the game.
---
I bet you we all have the same thing in common we are with Optus

Better not forget the canned coffee this time

I just watched a Deathclaw Matriarch get fucked up by an ant. The whole world is crazy. 
---
Almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
What builds are killing those two in seconds
---
Upvote because QoL
---
That's what I figured, and that's kind of how it was upon launch, but yesterday I was being attacked by level 62 scorched champions at Morgantown and 68 Super Mutant Overlords near the Top of the World
---
Now you have Bethesda a reason to fix it. Great job!
---
I have been trying to do these challenges with a new character i just made couple weeks ago...
---
Yes, something has to be done. Im still pissed I only found 1 guy doing the Paradise event 4h after maintenance finished, on launch day!  
---
And same with the encryptid event, at least that one has a server wide notification
---
You can only have a max of five. Similarly to how lights have a max of fifty.
---
You're like all those cheeky companies that release free promotions at working hours. Im at work for another 5 hours.
---
I've reached the point with my melee build where I one shot most enemies, so it's difficult to not accidentally kill a legendary, especially when they don't have a star
---
I saw this the other day on ebay, not buying but just typing fallout 76 brings up numerous sales of duped weapons and armor, what gets me though is there are actual people paying more than the games RRP for an ingame weapon or piece of armor.
---
There is "The Asylum" a discord server where this shit is shared, tips on duping handed out and so on.
---
There are groups of people l, teams if you like, seeking out dupe glitches actively. I'm also thinking there is a glitch with the technical data quest... I keep seeing the same people there, crouched so they don't show on the map, I join there server regularly and they are there all the time. I have names but no proof, but there is something going on there at the moment. 
---
There a bunch of jobsworth c%*&amp;:.
---
That's crazy, I actually thought it was buffed. 3 event's in and 
---
3 lab coats 
---
Packback plan
---
Bear arm plan
---
I really wonder if it has anything to do with luck. I have a very high luck. Kinda played myself  tho because thats all i wanted and the event is kinda dead to me now after the first day.
---
As someone who has played the game almost daily since beta, and is in this subreddit, the new quest IS hard to understand the first few times.  Even knowing the concept 'gather food", "protect animals", "kill alpha", I end up showing up late, trying to figure out where everything &amp; everyone is at, have to kill the robots that won't stop shooting me, now everyone is gone and I'm lost, ok it's protection time, final boss and we're done.  Sorry for not helping more, but I'll get the hang of it after a few tries.  Bottom line, go easy on people who may not know what's going on, just because you've done it a dozen times doesn't mean they ever have.
---
Same. My sister just started playing and she really wants to see Mothman, so getting Path of Enlightenment to trigger only seems to happen when she's offline.... But either way, it would be good to know. There's server wide notifications for Encryptid and Death From Above, why can't I get it for Feed The People? My customers demand stew!
---
What? 
---
If they're that lazy to not even giving a fuck to change their weapon to something that doesn't kill in one hit then they're assholes in my book.
---
You're not very logical in this matter.
---
I think he is referring to the insane damage output you can get with melee weapons. A good bloodied build using any half decent melee weapon can do 3k+ dmg (and thats on the low end btw) in comparison to ranged which with the exception of maybe instigating black powder weapons and a fatman/mirvs (lol)  the damage just is not comparable at all. The only downside to melee right now is lack of any splash damage for it, but tbh with how fast weapons swing with the faster swing speed modifier and martial artist really you can cut down hundreds of mobs before anyone can even get a shot off.
---
My luck on my build was 11 at the time, so idk @.@
---
In my opinion its still well worth going for, especially if you can kill the Sheepsquatch pretty quickly by your self, I would still go their to farm Legendary items if not for anything other than the Scrip.
---
Free Range is also very good, if enough high level people show up to the event I've had up to 3 lvl 80 Legerndary 3 star Sheepsquatch's spawn there.
---
Im 236 and I've not seen any difference.
---
Any other players in the area, regardless of level, can sent the enemys thru the roof,in level and numbers.
---
If I get the jist of your post, you may wish to back off a little to safer areas. On the other hand,does make the game a tad more interesting. cheers.
---
Nope. Im on PC. 
---
AND SHAME ON YOU FOR NUKING INOCENT CAMPOWNERS YA BLISTERING BARNACLE ON A MIRELURK'S ARSE

Fucked up droptable, drop all instead of pick one of the bunch.

That place is broken for me.. always totally freezing when killed couple enemies in there --&gt; ctrl+alt+delete

More PSA: This works with the Sledgehammer too

Also....isn't this guide (and the others) missing info like the code to get animals to help you etc?
---
just found it

---
Thanks, though I don't think I can go many places safer than Morgantown Airport...
---
Yeah, this game still needs more quality of life fixes. Im still dreaming of text chat since beta...
---
Yeah, somehow I just know that won't work on console, but I know PC players would love it
---
someone told me in the comments
---
Amazing, first mention of this I see. Funny that there are two big posts called "guides" for this event but no mention of this XD maybe this would help solo players or small groups?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/

Literally second google result....
---
Did you not just say it was made a thousand times before?
---
Username checks out
---
Oh wow I had a 11 luck as well! So ig that theory is dead. 
---
Yeah there is quite the number of 3* spawning there. Thats crazy never had more than 2 Sheepsquatchs at free range so I'll definitely keeping going to those.
---
Keep server hopping whitesprings until that glowing deathclaw spawns, it's always drops a hide. It spawns between the laundromat and that AntiVirus fountain.
---
If your lower level then you may need a buddy to spawn in at a higher level to get this lizard to show up, but it has dropped for me numerous times, I put the hides in my vending machine for 250caps, they went pretty quickly though.
---
Grenades, shotgun headshots, oneshot rifle sneak headshots are how ive dealt with this. Not the best but it works. I always keep those on me even though has nothing to do with build. Something that needs fixed but also could ruin the game so i low key dont want them to touch it lol
---
You get to pick perk card or rearrange perk points. No stat increase past 50. Sorry
---
30 minutes after entering the lobby. the feeding time is 5 minutes +20 sec for last call feeding time
---
Most of the issues I've faced could be "fixed" by letting me reconnect to the server I was just on. 
---
Last week I wasted 3 nukes in one night and stopped playing for a few days. Crashed to desktop before I could exit the silo on the first one. Server crashed shortly after the SBQ regenerated on the second nuke. Third one was another crash to desktop while I was fast traveling to Whitespring. 
---
The kicker? I lost 200+ pounds of random stuff looted while fighting the SBQ on the second nuke. I had almost 600 pounds of stuff on me before the server crashed and afterwards, when we rejoined, I was under my 370lb carry weight limit and no longer over-encumbered.
---
Thx
---
As a solo player I find this very sad. Looks like it's very hard to finish these events with randoms. Something needs to change in the formula, group finder, instanced events or idk.
---
They adopted me! So I named them and care as my little pets. We live in a symbiotic relationship.
---
Maybe find people like you, who do zero damage and play with them instead of coming to leech of from high level players with actual gear.
---
Say "Apple"
---
Allright, I was thinking about your build and weapon idea.
---
I'll take this. Thank you.
---
Because ppl are running around invisible killing everyone
---
Oh shit yeah or just need them
---
The disclaimer doesn't say anything about it being bugged unless done it that order, it recommends listening to them in that order, to "Follow the Journey."
---
I still spawn in my own camps objects
---
Do you play a bloodied build, by chance? 
---
I do, and I notice that the timer appears and disappears almost instantly as if I took damage while it was counting down.
---
Wondering if maybe it has something to do with a high-rad playstyle.
---
You need a second set of stairs to the same floor, then you can remove the first set, and replace the stairs where they were, and remove the second set.
---
Hope that helps in the meantime.
---
No. But the game currently on PS4 is super buggy, low frame rate and a lot of lag!
---
Pretty sure I get screws scrapping with scrapper equipped
---
Pretty sure you can't do that on PS4, or I'm just too dumb to figure it out. There's a recents list but not a join option, just invite/mute/block I think.
---
Yeah the one time we had 3 spawn it was me and 3 friends in a group and I think 1 or 2 other randoms as well so their were a good 5-6 of us their at the time, all over lvl 100.
---
took 5 seconds -&gt;  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76)

That's exactly the kind of stuff I'm talking about.  These are problems that have been around since beta.  If anything should be considered as serious, it's stuff like this.
---
depends.....at level 20 , I was working my way thru the ash heap.
---
lewisburg was horrendous. My son at l15,and another random player, wave
---
after wave,after wave..... l68 mutants,fully armoured and mini gunned,
---
loads of fun for hours.
---
Well. You dont have range, so it's natural that you would be able to deal more damage as compensation. Have you thought about the fact that virtually nobody plays melee in survival? 
---
Melee ain't OP in this game. I have a melee build with B SS meathook, powerfist, deathclaw and can do thousands of damage, but still prefer rifle builds over it.
---
Check again mate, we only get wood and steal.
---
Saw the same thing yesterday it was in the 90s and an ant comes by and just wrecked it
---
My husband found out it too. And I was like ‚Äúoh did you read about it somewhere or from you tube‚Äù. But no, no one knew about it, or no one shared at least.
---
That's my main weapon. Called it Whap!.
---
I heard rumours about it being just another battle royale. Hope it's more like that concept from the OP, though...
---
Well done with the guide! I dont know why players in wecond part ‚Äúprotect animals‚Äù tend to stay only with one. I would only assume if all three are alive, rewards would be bigger.
---
That is amazing.  
---
I can't even figure out how to put a roof on my camp.
---
You only gain new perk cards (and respec if you so choose) after lv 50. A thing that most people forget when whining about high levels killing them..
---
Exact same with me. Found all parts of basement code, explored the whole thing, read all terminals and new event started.
---
yeah that's what I though like in the free range event
---
Could also be AFK just to keep the shop running in the world. I have a few friends who do that.
---
Too bad, I bet we get a sweet looking shovel next week though!
---
I never said it was OP. For sure range is king in PVP, but in PVE encounters honestly outside of the scorchbeast queen event there isn't much reason to bring anything other than melee to a fight. I disagree that it's broken I'm just assuming that melee's insane damage it what the OP is complaining about.  I mean cmon do melee weapons really need to be strong enough to one shot mirelurk queens and sheepsquatches?
---
No idea. Let me know when you find a good spot.
---
duping is frowned upon but abusing a bug to get atoms that others have to actually earn or pay for... makes sense in this sub. u cant have both. No exploiting or yes exploiting. Make up your mind mods
---
Yep had that over 4 hrs ago deleted all my data and game and are in a the process of downloading the game again to to if that will work if not Beth just lost a customer
---
My legendary musket I named Yankee Doodle. Has an effect that ups vats chance before combat with sneak it makes almost everything one shot kills. Great for when I‚Äôm in an area I need to get out of. Just sneak towards the exit drop the biggest threat and run like hell. Had it since level 15 I‚Äôm 45 now lol just can‚Äôt give it up.
---
Yea, the same case is with Imposter event. I mean you are in location and you see 3 pylons. Obviously those pylons aren't there just for display. Just seeing those pylons is enough information to put you on thinking:"Hey maybe I have to do something with those", but apparently not a case with average F76 player. And then you have written out text of what you have to do and F76 players still can't figure out. I am amazed how ridiculous average F76 player is. The standard can't be so low.
---
I turn off ambient music and kick on silent hill st from the PlayStation 1 game sets the mood pretty well for that dark dread in your heart.
---
I‚Äôm currently trying to reinstall the game to see if I can fix that exact problem
---
Vampire's. Seriously. Which that rate of fire you will never run out if hp. Tank anything with abandonment.
---
Fastest way I found is to run into the small building on the south end of the white springs. It‚Äôs full of dozens of ghouls and a wendigo. Lead them outside near the cars and then blow all the cars up. You will die but you will get a ton of XP very quickly.
---
No that's 2006/2007. 2000 is a ban.
---
Yeah.. ok. I‚Äôll go there with ya. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure which video of his I saw first, but I was immediately turned off by one of the bigger points he was trying to make. It was after some pretty good suggestions for the gun-armor mod interface. 
---
He basically said he didn‚Äôt like the Survival eat/drink mechanics, and then further admitted something like, ‚Äú it makes the game boring because he always goes back to Flatwoods to get food.‚Äù So this was a complaint. 
---
He didn‚Äôt even consider that maybe HE was making the game boring for HIMSELF. 
---
I see 76 as a canvas for literally countless gameplay styles... here Many was saying ‚Äúmy playstyle is boring so therefore the game was boring.‚Äù 
---
So in other words, the guys a n00b.
---
Hotfix is coming shortly. If someone finds to way to make even few Atoms more easily it will be priority one for Bethesda to fix. Bethesda will move all other problems aside while this is fixed, because people might now buy less Atoms with real money.
---
Curious if it will account for over-leveled players or if it will be a straight reset.  I guess there's no real advantage being over 50 short of perk card options, but some folks are 200+.....
---
I found a work around for this - don't die
---
2 star level 50 anti armor gatling plasma. Scorchbeast melter for sure. Wish I could get a better one but I do love it.
---
sheet ..thats like a 50gb download..i only.get 100gb  a month..cost me a fortune if i go over
---
Wait what
---
Yes please!
---
I may have this plan, give me 30 min to confirm for you if still in need
---
I am currently wandering the wasteland wearing the drifter outfit, black cowboy hat and plague doctor mask. Its not a bad look I feel!
---
Yep I know my speed has crawled down to a small it will take another hr probably to finish downloading
---
Yeah sorry my comment was more directed towards the OP who seems to think it's broken. I personally don't think it is. Sure the damage may seem a bit insane but what's the difference if they can 1 shot or 2shot mirelurk queens. Even with their current damage it's less effective versus other ranged builds because of their close countered-ness and the melee dmg it faces, need for more travel, lack of splash, etc. If it  also dealt similar dmg to rifle builds, seriously who'd play melee? It still takes longer for a melee to kill a mirelurk queen than a handmade build does because I actually have to get to the queen to begin with. I just think it'd be a smart idea to nerf melee... Dmg is all they have, seriously.
---
take me.6hrs lol
---
I'm off now. Won't be back on until tomorrow night. Still interested though
---
Something like that
---
can the ps4, log in to the ps4 server ?
---
fo76 can crash my ps4,router,exchange, but the last time it was the sony server that crashed. if thats down, then you won't get to bethesda servers.
---
I‚Äôve got a level 35 .50 Cal HMG that I‚Äôve been using since I got it. Its a 3 star legendary with reduced weight, boosted damage to super mutants, and another attribute that I can‚Äôt recall offhand at the moment. But that gun has been with me through thick and thin, and is one of the guns that helped me fire my first nuke as well as took down the SB Queen. I tend to use other weapons like my bloodied minigun and whatnot, but when it hits the fan I always swap back to the .50 Cal.
---
i have the exact same problem.on my ps4
---
Bethesda accidentally gave everyone topiary cats and topiary deathclaws as buildables in camp. Theyre supposed to he item sin the ATOM shop but were mistakenly given to everyone. Bethesda has since removed the topiarys from being able to be built by everyone, because theyre an ATOM item and are not free.  So other person says ‚Äúit was‚Äù as in it used to have topiary cats, but now wont because the topiarys were removed from everyones buildables.   But im seeing other people say they still have the ones they already built
---
im having exact same problem..ps4 in australia
---
Very nice work! Thank you!
---
Haha thanks yes agree 100%
---
Reallyüò´ noooooo i was imagining a room of speakers blasting out beach boys lol "Wouldn't it be nice" ü§£üòÇü§£
---
No no no, they said they want a protectron
---
they both can show up when server is down. i had the 4:8:2000 error yesterday while trying to connect after update, complete with the "Account not authorized" message
---
its Wad Worms
---
I think you can take the photo after killing it and still get the achievements. I saw it pops up with the name in the upper right corner and assumed this was all it took. I have not verified this and could be taking out my ass.
---
I did nuke a couple of times to get some flux and chance for some desirable legendary drops. It's a hassle to launch, then people either won't show up for the Queen or they "TSE" the hell out of Whitesprings.
---
Damn, I cried tears of joy when I got my cool looking pickaxe skin lol
---
Welcome to the club. After patch 9 I think it was, I logged in and started inside the vault. My level 99 and 80 something characters were both gone. As in they never happened. No camps, no stashes, no progress. no nothing. It was as if I has just started the game from scratch. A ticket sent to Bethesda netted me a final reply of ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing we can do about it‚Äù. I had been in since beta.
---
Maybe I misunderstand, but I think I had a similar issue.
---
To fix it I had to place a steel pole at the upper floor beside the stair. Then I could place another
---
floor level above the stair.
---
I think you might be right, my ps4 is having alot of trouble as well
---
I think it was an issue for some with this patch.  You may want to give it a day for this to sort out.
---
Not gonna delete mine cause that way to big of a download time, takes me like 6 hours lol
---
Did the camera show the name tag to the top right? Sometimes you have to keep repositioning yourself, even at point-blank range to have the camera recognize the body.
---
Ye probably m8
---
Mine is nothing like that. Progress is still good but no armor, weapons, and caps
---
I think it was an issue for some with today‚Äôs patch.  You might want to give it a day to sort out.
---
It's a display issue rather than actual inventory bug. I've had it happen often but it goes beck to normal quickly on it's own. Mine was power cores which would have been so heavy my guy would have smushed instantly, it didn't. Save support the extra work and let them fix real issues. You will see this return to normal
---
Because
---
1) Bethesda doesn't want to piss off the player base
---
2) the weapons actually suck for the most part and are not game breaking just don't make sense in a realism way.
---
3) there are not longer a small amount of them. They have been duped and redistributed into circulation.
---
Wise decision probably just turn it off and wait a day
---
damn...are you having any trouble getting on ?
---
I wish I could say this suprises me. And the paying more than the Retail of FO76 for an in game item is just baffling.
---
Or play something else I guess
---
While I believe PvP to be the most interesting aspect of F76 I myself am not particularly excited about BR news, and hoping that it won't be an actual BR, even if somewhat similar.
---
What I would want the most would be to improve the sense of persistency - player towns, shared server pools, more tweaks to matchmaking so that on survival killers are placed with killers and wandereds with wanderers, instanced raids, instanced PvP.
---
Fo you have any mods enabled
---
You would want to substitute the explosive buff so something else... just taking it away completely is too harsh.
---
It‚Äôs patched. There are just quite a few left over from before they patched it
---
Thank you, but it specifically states ‚Äútake pictures of wildlife in the Mire‚Äù, and one of them is ‚Äútake a camera picture of a cat‚Äù.
---
Am I the only one who is wondering where the "pro shop" is? I have been to WS countless times and also Enclave Bunker, and I have visited the Golf Club a handful of times. There are areas I tend to no go though ... I've never seen a pro shop that I dam recall?
---
Not a one
---
Hey we can help each otherm ign: DaveBlazko
---
I didn‚Äôt last night.  But I am US and haven‚Äôt tried recently.
---
Fallout 76 is mostly just a copy from Fallout 4 with added network code. I wouldn't say that they have put much effort to make it. They also skipped testing phase totally and let people (us) to test game to save money. We have now tested it like 6+ months and most of the core problems are still in the game, because Bethesda isn't going to fix those problems.
---
So these are the real facts and not assumptions that are based for personal feelings how this game is made. If you want to support this kind of game developing and quality in the future you probably like to play broken and buggy games.
---
It gives off a consistent mood... can‚Äôt really explain it. But I enjoy playing through the playlist once, then its either Classical playlist once, original score for a while, or just no music at all.
---
There's always one shit sandwich hanging around on here. Also yeah I've noticed there isn't much they can do. You could try not being scummy but hey you be you.
---
As someone posted before: I don't suffer from Rad Worms, I enjoy every minute of it.
---
Hi ! just added u :)
---
If you are with Optus, I was having issues until I switched to my mobile data. Optus is having weird connection issues currently
---
you mean replace all Exposive perks on energy guns with a 'random' one....this would also work to fix the issue
---
Reply back if you find issue thanks.
---
ATOM store $$$ bottom line, they have to pay salaries.
---
Haha
---
Ill keep my Bloodied explosive laser rifle thank you very much. In fact, it needs a durability buff.
---
I'm not 100% sure of that. Maybe it's another thing we've missed, anyway... the objectives descriptions needs to be more  specific.
---
Wow! Prices must have dropped. Lol. I saw this a few months back on one of the Duping site. I was floored to be honest with you. Nonetheless why bother paying for an in game Item, I  have gotten every Legendary Item after playing the game for awhile, approximately 150 levels and you will come across every one of them at least once.
---
Can we do the other challenge too, by the way?
---
Awesome weapon especially with auto mod and that‚Äôs before you even start finding legendary variations
---
If others are working fine, please comment as well.  This sounds like network lag to me.   I haven‚Äôt tried the event yet, and curious on expectations.
---
 About that "Consuming" error, I am getting this same error as well, though with a slight variation. It only happens to me after I complete an event/quest, and use a single consumable immediately or shortly after the completion.
---
&gt;**Consuming**:  consuming food or drink hangs the client and the process needs to be  killed. Not sure if related, but happens in PA or on foot with the slick  Pip-boy overlay. *(Ticket submitted months ago)*
---
I have submitted a ticket as well, with the steps to replicate it:
---
1. Player completes a quest or event, and the completion message and rewards pop-up. 
---
2. Player then uses a single consumable item from the inventory, either  immediately after quest/event completion, or within 1 or 2 minutes  after.   
---
 \--&gt; (in the Pip-boy screen, using either any single consumable from the Aid tab, or a Plan from the Notes tab) 
---
3. Game freezes up, and while the music still plays, the player is unable  to perform anything, and the mouse-cursor does not move. 
---
4. Upon alt-tabbing and opening the Windows Task Manager, it shows that the Fallout76 executable is not responding. 
---
5. Only solution is to force-close the Fallout76 executable.  
---
Sadly have only received the usual automated reply to check requirements, permissions, etc.
---
You mean the mothman statue one ?
---
It is kind of brutal, but I kind of enjoy the grind. My eyes roll and I cuss when I scrap one and don't get the mod I want, and get this overwhelming sense of satisfaction when I do (when I finally got a suppressor, I let out a deep sigh and muttered "finally").
---
Now I'm onto the endless gathering of springs for the lever action (farm spots for them are a bit better than the ones for screws though). I'm actually getting more duds (no mod learned) from scrapping levers than handmades though, if that's any consolation for you.
---
I don't think these weapons are an issue. Sooner or later they will release higher level weapons an 5‚òÜ gear these will eventually be more or less obsolete.
---
hope it sorts out .last time, waited an hour,..all came back.........minus all my junk, I may add.
---
cheers
---
Thats fine, you can keep it, but in the interest of 'good will' you should just display it in your CAMP and not use it.
---
But that is totally your discretion
---
I already paid full price üôÑ
---
i think its a problem on bethesdas side..tried logging in then and it said they are hard at work trying to fix the problem..
---
I can‚Äôt even be sure these kids will get this reference, but very accurate lol
---
ok..thnx.for the feedback
---
Haha, yeah... that‚Äôs back
---
Was a bug about two or three months ago -_-
---
Man i'm already at 6 hours not consecutive without even seeing a single tamable.  It's clear there's something wrong with my character. Could you help on ps4?
---
I'll pay you 2000 when you find a tamable deathclaw.
---
Hope so, I‚Äôve been searching for 3 hours.
---
It does not work for me
---
What a terrible idea.   Stop being jealous of that which you do not have.
---
Late last year I got the white suit. Didn't think it looked that cool and tossed it in the Overseer's chest. Weeps in stupidity.
---
it is technically an exploit when it comes down to it. But yes, eventually they will become obsolete.
---
are you in australia ?
---
Yep
---
same..thats 3 people so far i know of having the same issue.in australia
---
That's really weird ..
---
I'm wearing
---
Grab of mysteries
---
Worn Veil
---
Eye of Ra
---
i hear this song always when i turn on radio. I also hate it.
---
Wtf is that?
---
I'd say it is because the power armor gauntlet is too big to fit inside of most of the unarmed weapons. If you look at the power fist and deathclaw gauntlet, they are designed to fit a normal human arm inside. 
---
Other than that, it is clearly a game balance decision. The unarmed weapons have much higher damage numbers than one handed and two handed weapons.
---
I am just saying it‚Äôs not just you. And I think they are working on it.
---
There are plans for under armor pieces. I can craft them and probably got them from treasure maps. Maps are golden if you bother to use them.
---
I am not jealous, I could easily get one if I wanted it. Energy weapons just dont suit my style, and if they are not supposed to be in the game, then they should not be allowed to be traded here.....that is all I am saying.
---
Nice powerful rifle with dirt cheap ammo. Farm steel from dead enemy weapons and craft ammo. No need for lead or gunpowder. It also makes choooo choooo sounds. This makes it my favorite farming / exploring weapon. You can put an automatic receiver on it but the magazine capacity hinders it and the recoil is pretty bad outside of vats. 
---
Ideally for an automatic Quad is the best primary effect. For a semi auto bloodied or instigating is best.
---
Ikr. At a loss with it really.
---
You have to wear the Veil of secrets
---
Don‚Äôt you want to become Groot? üòÇ
---
I wouldn't call them an exploit. It should've never been in the game yes but the ones that dropped were not from an exploit. The thousands that were duped well that's an exploit.
---
Would be good if we could set them on the player terminal thing that was added recently.
---
yeh..glad.to know its not.something wrong.at my.end...so far i know of 3 other people.in australia (where i am). having the same.problem
---
ah I see ! sry
---
There is no trading here.  Say, let‚Äôs talk about nerfing your gear.  What‚Äôs your build?
---
Not random. Choose a similarly powerful perk that applies to energy guns and replace it.
---
Mine kept screwing up too
---
Turned out, it downloaded in the background while I was fucking around trying to ‚Äòfix it‚Äô...
---
Just had a loop of spinning update circle then all of a sudden, it boots up after my 30th fruitless attempt of starting the app, lol
---
Man if that piece of armor was on xbox I would have paid good money for it.
---
used 1 in the past......not bad........then looked at the weight of the spikes.
---
if you have the plans ..make one ...go play with it..............if it works for you..........
---
So is it fixed for you?
---
Then maybe that‚Äôs a separate, new issue related to regional servers.  You can bet they‚Äôll hop on that.
---
VATS crit Sneak Sniper
---
Use |3* AAE+1Per hunting rifle | 2* AA+50%Crit hunting rifle | 3* AAEWWR Handmade. Vanguard armor with WWR and FDC
---
How is it an exploit? Thought this was a developer oversight and people got them from drops... you saying that people can somehow choose their own mod on legendary weapons??!
---
Fisto wants to know your location.
---
im having the same issue im in australia also
---
not saying that.
---
I'm just starting a discussion on it is all.
---
my game crashes every time i start the new event on pc, the event starts then 30 second late my game locks up...done this 3 times, i think its a diffrent server each time i log in 2 since i have to restart my pc every time the game locks up  
---
amd r5 1600  3.2GHz , 16g 2400mhz RAM, gtx 1060 3g, m.2 240 ssd, 2Tb hDD, 500w psu, game been running fine wile doing every thing else before update.
---
I'd like to see wooden armor removed from the game... Just like mole rats. 
---
Seriously, who wood really think that can hold up in a fight?
---
Thank You awesome PSA I'm doing this tonight before its patched.
---
I‚Äôm one of those guys but yeah I doubt it I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs per reset not per 50 levels
---
Nice gear. Too overpowered.  It should be nerfed to keep things fair.  Right?
---
I always forget when I bulk to stash the bulk.... then I scrap said bulk.... makes me feel like an idiot everytime....
---
I can see it being viable in survival, depending on their perks, a stealth wood armour build, wood look good
---
Sure I heard that this is another bug... There shouldn't be 3 star wood... and if you log out and in then it reverts to one star... ?!
---
Crap. I haven't been saving cooking oil from scrapping. I wonder how many recipes I've never been able to make.
---
I want wood armor plans.  Until then I can't deck myself out in vegan armor and ambush other players while shrieking "QUINOA!!!"
---
Max hp never increase. You still have 250 at level 50. (if you don't have endurance or perks/gear)
---
Ah the Suppressors effect, good with certain weapons, had a crossbow which was a beast early on. I normally look for the 33% accuracy in vats on weapons now, that with GunFu is magic, lasy but good for clearing the golf club rapidly.
---
I checked to see if I had updates in background but nah. I have no idea, this is stupid.
---
Not really but I appreciate your opinion.
---
The fact is if it takes 7 screws to make a gun we should be getting at least 2-3 back when we scrap.
---
PS I hate grinding I just want to kill shit, as I live about 200 metres from a fisser site.
---
Cheers mate
---
Play with moving your CAMP device around - it will change where you spawn.  The place where other players who fast travel spawn in your CAMP as far as I know doesn't change, so its a bigger problem for them.
---
Yes excellent idea. I'd actually like it if every event poppped up. There's so many events I haven't done yet.
---
Check the overseer's camp, I drop all my plans there. Pretty sure even brick buildings.
---
yeah and I thought they fixed it...
---
I gave one of these away for free on discord the other day. Regularly give weapons away, not shit ones either... Gave a Bloodied railway away the other day w/vats crit and less vats cost.
---
I don‚Äôt think backpacks work on power armor, so no
---
TAKE MY MONEY! I WANT HIGHER BUDGET!
---
That's what I mean.
---
Add a little depth to game play and cooking in general.
---
Game stability always suffers after a major patch.  After patch 8 the server always crashed 5 or 10 minutes after a nuke punch. That week I lunched 36 nukes and every time it crashed. Should be fixed in a week or so.
---
I stopped bulking because of this. If I need to unload something for weight, I just put it in the machine at 1 or 2 caps and it goes. I don‚Äôt trust myself to remember.
---
There's only one way in now, on the triage side...all the other doors are boarded up. You have to fight your way through a new basement level, figure out how to get to a room with a key card, all the great Bethesda trademarks. There's more lore, and you really get a sense of how the Responders made a last stand.
---
She still has 32767 health and 300/300/300 resistances in the datafiles. Did she land? People tend to fire at her from beyond their default weapon range doing fractional damage. Also if there are bloodied builds in the group, that can look like an easy fight.
---
Yeh from previous post and what people have said, Im going to make an alt and go heavy weapon with it. Put to much effort into my toon now, to go and change up now. Only have one character, level 170 lol... Spent quite a bit of time in Pvp.
---
SIGH.
---
I just LOVE this game. /s
---
Well its good that they fix it. If u want something for free u need to work for it. Otherwise u are a commie
---
What issue?   These guns dropped for three month under the rules in place at that time?
---
Well... even heavy combat armour is vegan... it does not eat meat. Nor veggies, only sunlight, so its even better.
---
Progression.
---
There's already the dogwood water filter.
---
Why not salting meat before the fridge?
---
I only use simple mods that change things like meat-pile colors (texture replacements) so I don't have to update my mods after each update. Is this what you mean by "tweak models" or is that something else that I am not familiar with? Can you give an example of a mod that "tweaks models?" Then, I would be happy to test it.
---
hmm..wouldnt be surprised.if they.got a secret buff..im sure the explosive harpoons did..havent used a tse in ages..might have to wipe the dust off and have a play
---
An acceptable tradeoff until you unlock a fridge
---
I need to start reading those patch notes. The only reason I stopped playing the game is because I felt like I'd done everything a handful of times. Be nice to see some new stuff.
---
Have you ever wanted to throw a controller through a 62 in flat screen? I have, trust me I feel your pain.
---
I do.
---
no issue, just opening discussion about them is all.
---
I have ping for bulk ammo on my vendor.  1 cap for each bullet is to much.
---
Umm...seriously?!  Just move on. üòÇ I have never seen so many people get their panties in a bunch over someone having an opinion about something.
---
What system tho
---
I have my character dressed up like SWAT. 
---
Marine under armor, the blue vault tec leather and combat armor, and the vault 76 hat. Just waiting on a Vault tec backpack. 
---
It works. People tell me all the time that I look like exactly what you are looking for.
---
I feel like an application like this should be integrated into a mod manager like Vortex as a feature. Personally, I have not tried to see if Vortex even works with Fallout 76 but I expect it does not (since there is no official mod support yet). Nonetheless, this application sounds very useful for certain people!
---
If you were banned you can still sign in on another account that is gamesharing with the main(banned) account and just play that way. 
---
However not many dupers I‚Äôm aware of are going to play without their horde. So they don‚Äôt even consider coming back
---
Want to that right now
---
Not really.  You just hate losing to them in pvp.  But, really, your gear is equally lethal.
---
The Whitesprings station vendor should have them too. I've just been there and he had them on sale.
---
How about they fix the two shot explosive legendarys so they can't one shot everything players and enemies alike. They said they have fixed them more then once before.
---
Are you saying you can... 'unscrew' screws? That just sounds like fantasy talk. It's not like you ever find screwdrivers in the game either...  
---
(In case you're wondering I have Level 3 "Fidel Sarcastro" Charisma Perk equipped).
---
it is a super sayan death claw.
---
I love this game, I really do. But Bethesda really needs to get their act together on this if it‚Äôs a known issue.
---
Never said I didn't care, just that playing the game itself is already fun, not just getting the best loot.
---
But if you rather want to buy those 2 items from me instead of playing the event, I'll glady sell them for a nice amount of caps, I always can get them again pretty easily :)
---
But they would have to 'give a shit' :/
---
Use a cryolator on the imposter Sheepsquatch it will slow it down enough for the melee players to do there thing.
---
Have no junk on you
---
Make sure to activate the pylons
---
Keep track of the Sheepsquatch I have lost the body a few times.
---
Yeah, it's stupid it does that.
---
N1 mate hahaha
---
I have a 3 star bloodied? (Low health more damage) for sale that I got from the purveyor last night... was fun to do one odd the challenges but I can't mod it.. so up 4 sale for the day and into the grinder :)
---
I haven't played PVP for a while to be honest so have not encountered this issue...yet.... On the positive note these weapons do help take down the larger boss enemies in Adventure mode.
---
I have to admire your resolve leaving this comment up. Most people delete after like 10 downvotes.
---
Deathclaws in 76 are pansys!
---
Get original.
---
I have a level 25 exploding executioner LAR that still rocks over most top level tier weapons... don't let the level of it put you off...
---
I usually one shot these guys. Last night this guy one shotted me. I ain‚Äôt mad about it.
---
My camp is just a house
---
Too bad they are still unavailable in the Atomic Shop. Good that I got them early ;)
---
You should know that when you scrape those rusty weapons, their screws can brake. And that‚Äôs the reason we don‚Äôt get any in return.
---
Joking, obviously we should get some back. I recommend using Scrapper perk though.
---
whoops. Me too. I'll start stashing some of it.
---
Also get rid of the drill drops as well!
---
I haven't tested myself, but I read that some mods still need to be listed under sResourceArchive2List to work.  These mods include those that change model skins, which I assume are done in the glow mods, and mods that alter animation such as lower weapons and fast power armor.
---
...even because silencing the *choo choo* would be a crime!
---
I bet you guys think,  "git gud."
---
Suffering food loss from parasites.
---
A least you failed with other people? I tried it twice last night, and both times no one else came. 
---
I lost the first, because I didn't know what the hell I was doing, and the second, because I think my one animal I was guarding aggroed a bunch of cave crickets from another bio.
---
Idk...  I've made this mistake a few times and the trick is to not be stupid and to sell or stash the things you bulk immediately after making them.
---
I'm triggered
---
Cosmetics like most camp items, eye candy.
---
I had not come across that guide. It‚Äôs a good read.
---
I feel you there as well. I‚Äôm an OG gamer, and a long time Fallout fan. All nonsense aside I really do like this game, and you‚Äôre right Bethesda needs to pull their head out of their brown eye for sure.
---
I got that same (Right Leg) POS armor the other day. I was saddened by this
---
They Un do several fixes with every patch
---
People can run a vats crit build without being dicks and oneshotting the legendary farming targets. They know what they are doing. Howabout you start reporting them for griefing? Because that's why they are doing it like that!
---
Get shorty
---
Ye didn‚Äôt work now it‚Äôs saying it has to download another 23gb making it a total of 64gb you have to download
---
Using the Scraper perk doesn't return any screws mate, just gives you extra wood and steal.
---
Cheers Mate
---
They really learned after SBQ, Encryptid was just as good for a "boss" event as this is for a "dungeon" event but they've really been right on with these updates
---
I never considered the reload effecting VATS. Would that make Gun Fu more or less useless? Also, pardon the necromancy, I'm only now getting started on this build.
---
I mean the weight is impressive.
---
I did too. Idk if lil kids or a language thing but no one is doin the objective. I‚Äôve only finished the quest once with one animal.
---
Clicking the Event marker worked for me everytime also. Xbox.
---
Also pls de-equip the perk that heals rads on a survive.
---
Some people use high rads to "dial in" a Set amount of HP for certain perks and mutations to function.
---
I lost all my rads yesterday and my .50cal went down From ~230dmg to ~110 or sth Like that. Also my stats went down From 20-30 to 5-13 and i got overencumbered and was a walking stick with a bb gun.
---
I've gotten several wood from mumbles, I've probably bought 10 or 12 3* armor and everyone has been a left arm, such horrible luck
---
Idk my man, I have an AAE Plasma Gatling and it outputs more damage that pretty much anything I've seen anyone I've encountered doing any activity. I can kill the lvl 100 Legendary Alpha Sheepsquatch in like 80 shots with it, and its health bar just melts.
---
Only enemy it doesn't really melt is Scorch Beasts/Queens and against players, man if they don't have Serendipity its basically an insta kill.
---
This would be very useful for the new events they added.  Every time Free Range pops up I end up doing it alone.  Project Paradise is also an awesome event but I hate having to check the map so often.
---
I joined the event with map marker but after 10 minutes the game freezed and crashed. Then I've tried to enter again with elevator and crashed again.   
---
XB1
---
I didn't know they were for hire...
---
Thankyew, thankyew veddy much...
---
Now if you'll excuse me, I must be on my way.  There's another settlement in need of my help...
---
Noone got banned for the overweight glitch.
---
As a user of all three this is correct.
---
He‚Äôs a fake dude.
---
The central computer. If you shut it down no more robots spawn.
---
On my first Run a couple of gutsys, a few assaultron and a sentry bot annihilator spawned.
---
Cute little bloatfly didnt stand a chance
---
Classic Bethesda fix 1 thing break 2 things in the process
---
It's about 50% for me. I've managed to do the event a couple times.
---
None of my friends play fallout 76. Those I can find online don't usually play at the same time as me, and being at work most of the time and getting only some time off to play doesn't make it easier. I don't want to team-up because I like playing alone. I don't want to team-up because I can't spend ages finding people who play a the same time as me and are constant and want to do the quests I need to do.
---
This is bullshit . We were promissed that you could do everything alone. And now they're shitting all over that promise.
---
LET ME DO STUFF ALONE OR IMPLEMENT MATCHMAKING.
---
If you're on PS4 I have them for sale cheap
---
There's a number of us that have been begging for "responder radio" which is like Hunter/Hunted in reverse. 
---
When someone yells out for help and turns on responder radio, any other person listening gets a ding on the radio and we can choose to fast travel to their location in exchange for a stimpack or something. (This is to avoid exploits that would see someone trying to take advantage of this to try to rob wounded players of loot as opposed to fast traveling to assist)
---
Even if it's behind a mission playwall to unlock and you have to build a responder receiver or something. 
---
Since responders are finally getting some love on the Atomic store coming up, maybe they'll finally let us do this.
---
Melee/stealth in team based events shouldn‚Äôt be used. I and most people I see playing aren‚Äôt going to wait for a person to run around tagging things before killing it. Majority of the time that person misses out on tagging Legendaries or most of the XP. Even if that isn‚Äôt your go to build, use a shitty rifle and just tag the things. 
---
This is especially a problem when you have to keep an ally alive and there are many enemies rushing the target and/or you.
---
I fucking hate Mole Rats, they have the dumbest mechanic, same with Rad Scorpions. The burrow and instantly popping up on top of you onyl to burrow again sometimes before your damn stagger is even finished is incredibly annoying.
---
Almost as annoying as Scorch Beasts (which I still ABSOLUTELY despise, as they take took much god damn damage to kill, and NEVER drop anything worthwhile)
---
You can hit the discount cap before even taking a grape Mentats!
---
What are the other two modifiers?
---
The legendary robots and ghouls continue to respawn under arkos pharma even after the event is completed or failed. I ran around for an hour yesterday grinding out random legendary enemies till I was over weight.
---
I'm on pc and have never had this problem. I have four sets and before one could rename them, I often needed to place the all down and collect three of them to get the one set I wanted to use. I have gotten stuck in PA twice, and had some pieces unequip on their own (still in my stash though), but never had an issue collecting multiple sets without having to enter them. So maybe fixed?
---
What platform?
---
BSS Fire Axe. Been with me for 110+ levels. I'm not a melee build anymore but it's nice to have something for close range.
---
The camp system really doesn't make sense sometimes.
---
I can't place a tato cos apparently it's intersecting with another object when there's nothing else around, and I also have two tatos nearly fully inside each other.
---
Xbox I'm afraid, thanks though!
---
Lead belly does in fact help with cannibalism
---
commented above.. but melee builds in general are terrible for team events. Even if you don‚Äôt do huge DPS just pick up a gun and tag things. Nobody wants to fail the event waiting for you to tag things. And especially shouldn‚Äôt run around melee if your build can‚Äôt handle stronger enemies.
---
I ran around the new event 4-5 times yesterday and I don‚Äôt use power armor. I had 0 problems, the only thing I would die from is an Assaultron beam every once in a while, and I run around at 20% HP all the time to keep nerd rage active
---
Make another account
---
Agree, should have some protection for not scrapping bulk items. Ive start only bulking when i go to sell it, but just means i dont have much space in my stash and my carry weight is always overcrumbered, would love to be able to fast travel again.
---
Its not too bad, mildly easy if you get a high vantage point
---
I build my camp from scratch post patch and didn't have a problem with stairs.
---
Ugh, mechanics....might give it a miss.
---
Easy soultion,
---
Git gud.
---
But for real though. It's really. It that hard. Just get a vantage point, it can't hurt you
---
It used to not scrap, then everyone said "let bulk autoscrap when crafting".
---
So bulk autoscrapped. Now everyone is "don't let bulk autoscrap!"
---
Yes, but since AW doesn't actually work on Gatling plasma or any other energy weapon, a lot of other weapons would be better. A furious Gatling plamsa would probably do more damage.
---
Amd it was beautiful
---
I just wish they made them a little more worth while. So far my luck has been absolutely terrible, and I'm more excited when I see Legendary robots/Ghouls/Animals than I am when I go to loot the Alpha Sheepsquatch body, or get the event completion reward (which like 7 out of 10 times I've ran I didn't even get a plan, and 1 of the 3 times I did it was a Nuka Cola Grenade which I've had the plan for since I was like lvl 20...)
---
They still need to work out rewards...
---
Events like Project Paradise should always reward a Event specific Plans
---
Legendary Enemies should always drop an item of equal value to their Legendary Tier. (out of the like 20+ lvl 80+ Legendary Sheepsquatch's I killed yesterday about 90% of the time all I got was a 1 star piece of trash)
---
You know how frustrating it is to kill the SBQ, Imposter Sheepsquatch or Alpha Sheepsquatch is and your only reward is a like 1 Star Nocturnal Switchblade or Wood Armor piece, and when you complete the event you basically only get a few rounds of ammunition and like 3 stimpacks? The answer is very.
---
This is why you have no friends.
---
How were you admitted into 76 anyway?
---
Killing the enemies isn't the hard part, it's completing the objectives 100%
---
I do though, and i didn't even do it with them. I'll probably do it with them today though
---
They should make a drop down menu with all the events in the game so that you can press "Y" to track the ones you want so that when they happen you get the notification for them.
---
By buying the game, are you salty I still people junk?
---
Finally encountered one last night and got it to half health. It then flew away and left me thinking I wouldn't get a wing. But if you go to where it last took off, there's a little ash pile that has some mothman loot in it. I finally got my wing!
---
This fixed for anyone yet? Having the same issue, plus the main menu isn‚Äôt loading and the one miraculous time it did I got kicked out of the game, asked to login ti Bethesda.net and the same issue with the main menu again. I‚Äôm also with Optus and in Australia. Glad it‚Äôs not just me, though my PC was about to kick the bucket.
---
This only happens with 3* for me I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs Bethesda doing it purposely
---
You‚Äôre going to take your friends‚Äô junk?
---
Yes, I agree.  But if my teammates die. The alpha will go after me and it can't reach me if I get up high
---
Is that so, well its a good thing its not my only Legacy Gatling Plasma and I also have one that is 3 star and is Furious and explosive.
---
Going to have to try that out.
---
not fixed yet..im with optus in australia.too unforunately but my internet is working fine with everything else..im able to play other online games but not.fallout
---
Nope, but if they die, I may pick it up so they don't have to worry about it, and give it back at the end
---
Jokes on you, I have dysentery
---
That one is much much nicer.
---
Same here. I hope it gets fixed soon. Keen to try the new event
---
Acid is the main problem. I can get free steel and cheap lead, but not too much acid per server.
---
If you are interested, my route is as follows:
---
1. Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast bridge; 2 Yao Guai
---
2. Middle Mountain Cabins; 2 Yao Guai sometimes
---
3. Silo Alpha; 1 Yao Guai often
---
4. Seneca Rocks Visitor Center; 1-3 Yao Guai sometimes
---
5. Monongah Outlook; 1 Yao Guai often
---
6. Dolly Sods; 1 Yao Guai, but now half the time it has been already killed by Tadpoles
---
7. Abandoned Waste Dump; 1 dead Yao Guai at the entrance
---
8. Toxic Larry's Meat &amp; Go; 3 Snallygasters
---
9. Fissure Site Prime; 2 dead Yao Guai
---
10. Fissure Site to the west of Prime; 2 dead Yaou Guai
---
Also I pick up every Abraxo, Bug and Stingwing drops wherever I find them.
---
I haven't played RDO but as far as looting, exploring, crafting, and building go that's all I do and i thoroughly enjoy the game. I play in adventure mode and have been in pacifist mode since like the start of the game. Haven't had any problems except for when friends want to get in a fight lol
---
That actually shows that duping is much less widespread as it was a few months ago. Back in Jan or Feb, you could find weapon packs on eBay 10 3* items for $10. $1 per gun. The supply has dried up a lot to see a 15000% price increase.
---
Even after beta I remember bulking stuff and it not being auto scrapped. What changed?
---
What's up with the condescending title?
---
First of all, everytime you join the Event (at least for as long as people are not getting sick of it), it is most likely already in full swing. You arrive there and it's "fill the troughs" and before you realize what these are supposed to be or how you ought to accomplish that, you now need to "defend the target" - huh? What? Why? Then a lvl 100 grafton monster pops up (for whatever reason), you kill it, the event concludes and you get a recipe with no idea what it does.
---
Then you hop server to do it again - and it's just the same thing... the event has already started, half the people have no idea what's going on, a select few who DO know are stoically completing objectives, you kill a bunch of glowing enemies - and then it's over.
---
For all intents and purposes, that's just bad design. Especially for such long and fairly complex events.
---
So I guess I really must be a complete and utter idiot. I will give it another shot today after work and keep OP's guide in mind.
---
same..i only get to play a couple hours at night. guess im gonna miss out tonight
---
Googled it and found an old reddit post, according to the Anti Armor affix represented in the game code, it only reduces your targets DR which means it only works with standard ballistic weapons.
---
The glow mods that replace skins/textures definitely work fine for me (I use 10 of them). The 11th and final mod that I use is "Reasonable Scorchbeast Scream Effects" ( [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/176](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/176) ) and afaik that one still works as well. I can test both in a bit when I test "Power Armor Fast Exit and Enter." I have no reason to suspect that they won't work fine with sResourceArchiveMisc and I believe it's unnecessary to have to use sResourceArchive2List. I will let you know (with proof) how my testing goes.

The item is floating. Wait what item? No item selected.

I hear you man. Feelsbad

You‚Äôre welcome.

Go to any train station and activate all the posters. It will give you the quests you need to start all the dlc.

There's two game modes now: Adventure and Survival. There's strict PvP restrictions in place in Adventure, so you can't get killed by another player unless you shoot back and you're not in pacifist mode. Only exception is if you're taking a public workshop: someone else can try and take it from you, and they can attack you freely if you're at the workshop. Similarly, no one can damage your CAMP unless you've already initiated PvP with them. Survival mode removes the PvP restrictions, adds limitations to fast travel, increases the penalties for death, and gives you a 20% boost to exp gained. So it sounds like you just want to stick with survival.
---
As for other players, it's super easy to avoid them, and aside from some daily/weekly challenges (which just reward currency for the cosmetics store) you don't have to group up with anyone to accomplish things. There are a few endgame events that require teamwork, but you can count on randos showing up and helping out. Other than that you can play solo just fine.
---
let me know if you get on bud..lol
---
I still have over 3000 atoms with nothing to buy.
---
 I don't think I've ever even looked at the daily challenges.
---
 So I would have been one of those guys who had no idea to take a picture of you in that outfit
---
It‚Äôs sad that this is still a problem.
---
There is, in fact, a flare gun in 76. Point is, if you use is when you are dying, someone will show up not to help you, but to steal your belongings.
---
You‚Äôre not an idiot friend, I did the same exact thing. It‚Äôs poorly designed and shouldn‚Äôt happen this way.
---
I feel for you I play the same just exploring and occasionally seeing legendarys and this morning got my first weapon I desired.. junkies gauss rifle and I was slaughtering super mutants with one shot then I had to go to work and when i came back I can‚Äôt even sign in now? So I guess I lost that weapon like you and the game lost me
---
Don't forget the Rad Worms' cousin; Bone worms.
---
Will do. Fun fact in the meantime. Thought I‚Äôd load up some overwatch while I wait and I can‚Äôt login to that either lol. Discord and phone wifi are working fine though. Maybe it‚Äôs an Optus thing? Shit me weird
---
Cool story, bro
---
This exactly. Maybe limit to five events, but let us choose which ones we like to do.
---
Wow if it works I'm moving everything over. Thanks.
---
from the atom shop
---
yeh..kill a 3 star ghoul at ws..then the body dissapears..happened to me a few times
---
Thanks bro
---
Don't get me started on mirelurk kings
---
hmm..
---
Approved **only** if a Wendigo shows up when you play it at night,.

I doubt he actually cared. Fallout is probably the only reason he is even known. He got money from them licensing it and wanted to tap out more cha-ching before he faded back into irrelevance.

A little bit. If they ask nicely for it back I'll return it. But if they swear or get mad I keep it

Aargg.. that‚Äôs a Nice weapon drop. I‚Äôm sorry to hear so as well..
---
The login fails have been quite ‚Äòactive‚Äô lately I feel as well.

Got a little tired I must say so as well. It‚Äôs rare to see legendaries when you just walking around and exploring. And when you finally see it you sure want it to function properly
---
God damn...
---
Need a few pieces to see a real difference in weapon weight reduction
---
DOMO ARIGATO
---
I always scrap with scrapper and i don‚Äôt think i have ever seen screws from weapon scrapping.  It was springs though that irritated me in the beginning days of the game considering how many springs was required to make a set of excavator armor you would think that scrapping any power armor would yield more than what it did.
---
I can‚Äôt remember exactly right now what you get for scrapping it, but it seemed quite lacking for destroying super advanced suits.
---
Hahahaha I must admit there might have been some deranged frustrated giggling about that while redoing my CAMP
---
Brilliant, thanks for your reply
---
I can't help you with the items you lost but in the future stay in the area and look in a wide circle for the meat pile, server desync can cause the remains to be in another spot. As an example, I've killed a mothman on a cliff and had to drop to the bottom for the loot.
---
Is there a pattern with the 3* ghouls disappearing?
---
Ooooh! Okay that sounds quite possible to me!
---
Thanks man I will
---
I have the same goddamn problem. I farm west tek a lot and about 20% of the time enterin the building the game stops loading and just freezes and i have to restart.
---
Remove wooden armor from the game.
---
I mean, the new weapons are hella cool for raiders, ie. Cultist blades, Sheepsquatch club n staff, and that new bear claw. Just need legendary lists for them now ...
---
Alright then
---
AWESOME! Now to just stack 3 more diseases, so people in my AOE get melted üòé
---
If you want a real grind start trying to unlock radium rifle mods.  It‚Äôs as bad as armor scrapping, I‚Äôve done well over 100 and I don‚Äôt think the hardened receiver and suppressor are anywhere in sight smh
---
=( yeah. mods fill that hole tho.
---
To be honest, I find it amusing. I love the game, but it‚Äôs just a game. And this is just a place to post opinions, see the great stuff that people post, and share your thoughts and opinions. I don‚Äôt trade or sell stuff on here. I honestly couldn‚Äôt care less about being upvoted or downvoted.  It doesn‚Äôt affect me one way or the other. Playing games and posting on here is a way to have fun and talk to people that enjoy the same things as me. We won‚Äôt all have the same opinions, and that‚Äôs fine.  And even if I got downvoted to 0 I‚Äôd still play and enjoy the game, and still come on here to see the great things that people post, and I‚Äôd still post my opinions. üòÅ
---
I've had them even pass through the steps of the cabins at WS. I can see them under the lattice on the steps. I now know not to kill anything on the steps.
---
Yeah well i hope not tho. 
---
But weird there‚Äôs a pattern indeed
---
This is why you are so salty.
---
Funny that currently in the game's canon he is likely there trying to keep things clean
---
So does weapon weight reduction armor take away total weight of weapons? Or just the base weight also?
---
The whole weapon as it is currently modded
---
I'm not salty. I take there stuff. They're salty when I take their junk
---
Due to insanely overwhelming player requests, in patch 9 they made every item/creature/building/location the same shade of black. 
---
So FO76 is now like playing a text based game, only without the noob crutch of having text. Just a player screaming, scorchbeast screaming, ghoul screaming, blackout death orgy, as you try to sprint from unseen event, to unseen location. I'm pretty sure they, like, quadrupled the number of fissures, because I have spent the last 25+ hours of gameplay doing nothing but falling into one. 
---
The best part is not really knowing if you actually still have your weapon equipped, if you still have any ammo, or if you still even have clothes on. I do have to say it's made survival mode really stand out (or at least I think it has? I don't really know which one I'm in anymore).
---
Anyway, if that sounds like fun, you should join our mime and shadow puppet role playing group. We meet every Tuesday at the nearest fissure, or at least everyone says that's where we meet, I haven't been able to confirm.
---
Sounds like Vault-tec security
---
That means you aren‚Äôt collecting stuff for the objectives, that‚Äôs part of the problem. I don‚Äôt think anyone thinks killing the enemies is the hard part.
---
Yeah I actually saw 2 ghouls underneath the stairs. Just stuck there. 
---
Maybe this area isn‚Äôt running optimally on the spawning
---
Ahhhh see well that makes sense, that‚Äôs how I think the weight reduction trait should work on all weapons also. Cause honestly it‚Äôs useless considering all weapons need to be modded for maximum output.
---
Special shout-out to drinking dirty water, when all you wanted was Bloodleaf :(
---
I'd love a ballistic fist from New Vegas
---
I love the armour pieces I have I can carry up to 20 heavy weapons and others 4 handmades and others
---
Happened to me a couple days ago with a pair of L65 SBs @ Line in the sand.  
---
Killed both, no bodies.  
---
Maddening part was the other team member could see (and loot) them.
---
Go ahead and give it a try. You are (mostly) safe in adventure mode now, there are only a handful of ways left that can force you into PvP (claiming a workshop and staying there, having certain mutations or armor perks, so: factors you can entirely avoid), and camps are safe now (hostile players can still kite enemies there, though, and those can cause damage, but that's it).
---
Disclaimer: I have almost 900 hours of FO76 under my belt, and have had only a handful of confrontations with griefers even back when they could still do real harm.
---
It‚Äôs not hard I may have not gotten 3 tier rewards but I soloed it lol
---
Let others do that, if they're there
---
? maybe
---
Oh how I hate mole rats only enemy to follow you across the whole map.
---
Has anyone tried it in a Nuked Zone yet?
---
That's the best way to look at this sub. Even if your opinion is unpopular you're entitled to it. I like seeing you keep your post up it's nice to know there's people out there who won't let downvotes stop thier opinion from being heard.
---
I personally do not use explosive not because of the issues mentioned here but because I constantly kill myself with them. I'm entirely too wreckless with an explosive weapon.

just.googled.optus network down..and apparently.its a problem with optus..been.down for about 8hrs now..dont expect it.to be fixed inna hurry..i wish i could change to telstra but im locked.into optus for another fukn year..had so many problems.with optus
---
No modding it won‚Äôt afect anything it still will be light exp my leaver rifles weight 1.5lbs lol
---
It's basically a part of me now

Awesome bot, I'm glad it exist...but bad use here it's a game. Please  go somewhere you're needed

11 luck 4 charisma.

Just wait a minute then play lol

Nuke... on a survival server?

Accurate.

just googled optus network down..optus having problems for the last 8hrs..dont expect them to fix it any time soon

Don‚Äôt roast the Furious drill.

I'm not sure, but I've only ever seen one Breach And Clear event active at a time.
---
And even though I've had them both several times, I never get credit for "Needle Spine" or "Whoopsies" in the Challenges.
---
Nothing it crashed

just googled optus network down..been having problems for the last 8hrs..dont expect them to.have it fixed anytime soon

Also, soil boxes for crops.
---
Think I would have been dropping frag mines in the doorway(s)...
---
Yep m8 üëç give up time I reckon
---
Yeah those are the type of numbers I was looking for on my rifles and heavy guns, but after modding they‚Äôre 15 and 20+ pounds with Weight reduction trait on them, just doesn‚Äôt make any sense, would be nice if they fixed that
---
May be they want to talk about it on E3.
---
Gatling LASER? Beta male
---
Sun Kissed is a lifesaver when you have Rad Worms 24/7 (and honestly who doesn't)? It at least beats going to Whitesprings every 10 minutes for the drinking fountain or constantly having to use radaway.
---
yep..im.always having trouble.with optus..should have known
---
Did it this morning, all was...well, moleminey. Three supervisors as usual.
---
Mine are fully modded my friend
---
Please assume the position....
---
Yeah, this happened to me a couple weeks ago. I dropped a 3* gauss I had just picked up from an enemy, 15 100% fusion cores, and random junk for a friend, hopped backwards and no bag. We looked all over and it was nowhere to be found. I was upset over the fusion cores.
---
Hell with you guys, I LIKE my wood armor.
---
Sneaky sneaky.
---
Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not useful for someone.
---
Yea there should be a tier effect with higher level weapons and armor giving back good scrap. I should get at least 1 screw and 1 ballistic fiber if I'm scrapping level 50 weapons without scrapper perk.
---
Quad barrel targeting computer etc etc
---
Fuck that. I like the aesthetic of wood armor. Instead of removing content, fix the problem of three star reverting to one star.
---
I keep hearing different things, but thank you.  I still have 3 other characters so I'll see if any of them end up seeing it as I level them up.  If not, it's really not THAT big a deal, but it would be a nice addition
---
Thank you ! I'll check it out !
---
Lol, I have a VE laser rifle as well. But your aggression is unnecessary
---
I don't think we should expect much from summer season. But I have high hopes on autumn.
---
I know. I‚Äôm saying the weight reduction Legendary trait on any weapon should do the same as your armor pieces. It should take the total weight after mods and reduce it 90% not just the base weight.
---
Gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Ahhhh got you
---
Yeah, we need to go back to deathclaws charging like ghouls and hitting like yao-gui.
---
It was so bad yesterday that I quit playing. I'm a daily player since December but last night it was unplayable for me on Xbox. So laggy and freezing. I was able to scrip and sell my limit and that was it. Even pulling items from my stash was painful.
---
Certainly was the case before yesterday‚Äôs patch - same with a three star assaultron head losing its prefix and turning into two star on login. I filed a ticket and standard response was ‚Äúwe are aware, we can‚Äôt fix items‚Äù. Still hoping for some scrip refund. Took me weeks to get enough for a three star weapon. Fingers crossed maybe it‚Äôs fixed after yesterday so it shouldn‚Äôt happen to anyone else?
---
Hello i'm here to talk to you about Unstable Isotopes, electrically charged and Plague Walker

I want the war drum

What, did you read agression into my comment? You‚Äôre fluffier than I thought, I simply stated a fact
---
I run around with all three and it doesn't always kill them lol
---
I've seen such people (and not only in mirror).
---
I've had it glitch out like that, or not have any other spawns, etc. Bad luck, switch servers.
---
Numbness will subside in several minutes.
---
I love C!

Lol don't really feel like this is badass at all. Kind of pathetic to think I'm badass Ina video game

Gatling laser is pretty good, espically tse

I sea what ewe did there.
---
Sort of a crazy accusation, but okay. This the reaction I like
---
U from Australia??
---
It's a perk card?
---
The Bear arms showed No Mods when I looked at it on the bench... Does it have mod plans?!
---
They did something to supposedly make foundations easier to place. But from my testing, they modified the function which identifies the nearest surface regarding what stuff can be placed on. Now if you have a rock laying party submerged under the world, it considers *this* to be the correct surface - therefore the terrain above is considered too high and thus your object is ""floating"".
---
I can start Monday thanks Bethesda

I loved RDR2‚Äôs single player mode but would often get so bored just riding around from one stop to the next. It looked great but wasn‚Äôt paced very well. Then I tried the online portion when it released and hated it. I had played some 76 right before RDR2 but put it down for a few weeks. But when I started playing the online beta, I jumped ship to 76 exclusively and haven‚Äôt looked back. On almost 900 hrs now and still love it. And couldn‚Äôt think about returning to RDR2 no matter how many fancy new clothes they put in the game. Give 76 a shot. Especially if you like looting, crafting, and building
---
I play fo76 like it's a single player game. In adventure mode, nobody can kill you or destroy your camp unless you attack them, or you own a workshop which they want to take over (small optional event).  
---
I'm on pc and I barely ever run into other players, and if I do, they just give a friendly wave and move along.  
---
Btw I've played rdr2 online as well, and in fo76 there's SO much more to see and do without interacting with anyone.
---
Are you guessing? How do you turn it off?
---
To the best of my knowledge just donuts need it.
---
Mine got fixed with the update today. Did you try logging in yet?
---
The 3/25 times the event doesn't crash is an awesome experience involving teamwork and cooporation which transcends Fasnacht, honestly (because of the difficulty), while being slightly less intense than ISS (also because of the difficulty), drawing in more players because there is an overall higher success rate even if stuff gets screwed up.
---
But the 22/25 times your game crashes, well this saves you time you would inevitably spend exiting the game (if even to restart it, but mostly to restart it), plus your caps spent to join the event are gone now so you get the opportunity to hunt down more caps again, creating a new endgame element. Brilliance.
---
Making radium rifles to scrap is a bigger grind than the SBQ.
---
This ground my gears when I first played the game. Speaking of which you should totally get springs and gears as well
---
I know for me it was unplayable between disconnects and being extremely laggy. I'll wait awhile til I go back.
---
I‚Äôm noticing the same.  Can‚Äôt wedge flooring into Mire trees like I did before. 
---
This is new to me, on a more positive note... seems we can place objects (like lanterns) on top of workbenches now
---
I got mine at the Golf Club by trying to be generous and leading a couple Ghouls towards a low health lvl 35 player. I had to revive them 3 times.
---
Even with the Contractor card it's still like 1 Violet flux and more...
---
Why do the down vote then incel boy. Cry that your thread didn't get the epicccccc response you wanted.
---
Is players stealing shops common?
---
In all my hours I've still yet to see it, I just do a server hop or two &amp; find it unclaimed.
---
I just want to be able to force-delete stairs.
---
I have a foundation with two staircases on it that's attached to absolutely nothing and it's ruining the look of my base. The problem? It's somehow an absolutely vital component and my entire base will collapse without the (moral?) support it provides.
---
I just want to get rid of it, without destroying and rebuilding my entire base. I spent hours on it. I don't want to redo it because of a shitty bug.
---
How many kills do you have with it? It it legendary?
---
I can tell already that lowered weapons will not work (because it is not a .ba2 archive). Mods that are not in .ba2 format require a separate tool to load loose files (Baka File Tool  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/9](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/9) ) and cannot be added to the game via the method we are talking about (INI). I will be testing PA\_FastANIM.ba2 and double-checking that the mods that I already use do in fact work momentarily.
---
But this is the response I wanted. You getting all mad over a video game is honestly funny. You need to chill out.
---
Happened to me a bit a couple of days ago (Australia too) 3 times in 10 mins. Full restart of ps4 seemed to fix it for me anyway.
---
I wish I could but I spent the other $40 on Spider-Man and a six pack of Blue Moon.
---
Any nuke zone counts as a radstorm

Yesterday was a bad day for crashes, disconnects, and lag on Xbox. It was completely unplayable for me on Xbox.
---
You can turn off the robots in the beginning of the event by going through the keypad door and clicking through a Terminal there
---
Apparently its been all day, but its the internet not FO76, elder scrolls online wont load either. PSN store loads just fine lol
---
Some dude nuked my house yesterday, tried it but didn't work
---
Are you on xbox as well?
---
Just bumped into a conga line of four deep kings in the mire near the Purveyor. It did not end well for me.
---
Yeah. It was just bad yesterday.
---
Last week someone said to me, that Bethesda doesn't read Reddit.
---
I actually have some kills with it, and i just really like taking pictures, why does everything have to be a legendary weapon instead of just wanting to have fun..
---
Ah I see. Sh*tty Aussie internet :p
---
I just play my own music on Spotify. I turned the ambient music off so it doesn't sound weird.
---
I did this to a guy in excavator PA the other day in watoga, he was in between two small houses crouched, I led some mirelurk Kings to him... Pocketed myself a boatload of lead, ballistic fiber, aluminium, steel, adhesive.... I filled my stash, bulked 89 steel and sold the majority.
---
#Noice
---
Giggity.
---
It's just like real life you get a raging kick ass 3‚òÜ Wood just to have it revert to 1‚òÜ before you can use it
---
No, keep wood armor.
---
Other's from Australia also having the same problem so don't panic
---
This üëç
---
I‚Äôm part of the elite, Glowing Postulates
---
The problem is that Bethesda would have to re-license every song, and that costs a lot of money.
---
The timer was the slap in the face though.
---
Been using wood armor on my latest character since level 3 and already at level 60s, it's completely viable from start till endgame content. Wood is extremely light, decent amounts of defense, has the most powerful stealth mod in the entire game, extremely cheap to repair and now with the Legendary Vendor and once the three star is fixed it will be even more ridiculously powerful in the hands of the worthy. Many people overlook wood like it is dead content; there is a reason it remains in the Legendary loot table despite so many people whining about it.
---
Yeah I should have added west tec to that list! Are you on xbox too?
---
In Fallout 4 the scrapper perk was actually useful, you got shit like screws, springs and nuclear material back from weapons.
---
Also, why do assault rifles have glass in them? I can only assume it's in the sights.
---
Haha yessssss!
---
I would prefer to see survival being a totally different server.  
---
With no legendary effects for armour/weapons...
---
Would balance things out a lot.
---
Maybe even having no level requirements on anything, just smg, grenade launcher. lever rifle and such. Would... make things very interesting.
---
Yes, higher levels would have more perks and strengths... but a good shot could neutralize that pretty quick.
---
Why not?
---
Yeah. I'm really really hoping for a hot fix today
---
This too.
---
I‚Äôm getting paranoid too, but for checking food and water, we should have an option to always see the meters!
---
Going to unlock the One Man Army tonight got 12 perks points I haven't used. Broke level 200 last night..
---
Wow I'm really loving this patch.. Good god, the rate at which legendaries are dropping is fan-F-in-tastic! the game got a boost in fun last night. Thanks Bethesda :)
---
What if it‚Äôs not a bug?  What if they simply removed the whole ‚Äúteleport to enemy using melee Vats‚Äù thing?
---
I believe one of the duping fixes broke this. It may have been the same time crafted weapons stopped stacking. You were able to make boards and sickles by the dozens then scrap all at once.
---
Would have payed good caps if it wasn't bugged.
---
Community managers do
---
Same here although we did it the first time with neary an issue. When it does work, you get **A TON** of legendaries.
---
I..... i got mine ....... \[stares at feet with shame\] ........ from.....     *^(molerats.)*
---
Were you talking about the plan or just a single mod? Would like to clarify before i waste a bunch of time server hopping.

---
*Again*
---
No kidding. I've played since December and yesterday was way worse in my opinion.
---
Wood armor users unite, never switching out from it and once the three star is fixed it is going to be even more disgusting with AP and sneaking legendary enhancements.
---
Hmm.. I know it is something that was fixed 2 patches ago.. but it may have been reset for whatever reason.. but they should
---
Awesome, thanks buddy!
---
Three weeks?  What platform are you on?
---
That should be a feature on our terminals
---
Snow.
---
I'm on PC. Ran the first event flawless. tried 2 more times after the first time and everytime I went down it froze and I had to switch users to close out FO76.
---
This is a great idea.
---
We now have the personal terminal, just add current events to it with timers.
---
I had to activate the trough over ten times sometimes before it adds my stuff.
---
Some people like to show off their wood.
---
That‚Äôs the equivalent of 10-20 cents. 
---
Server cost are always going to cost more than that. I‚Äôd suggest if they were going to do this it‚Äôd be 500 atoms a month at a minimum.
---
Otherwise they can look into running a local version of the game but you don‚Äôt earn trophies or atoms.

Expose myself to radiation and diseases you say? Sounds crazy enough to work. What's the worst that could happen, right? XD
---
Well it was easy, to be fair
---
yeah, I've made sure to always check my junk before scrapping all.. wasted way too much plastic..
---
3\* tesla rifle with +30% to animals, explosive, and +50 DR when aiming.  It's only level 40 but really shines with grouped enemies.  It still gets regular use after 40+ levels.
---
The 1st bloodied weapon that ever dropped for me from a whitesprings ghoul was a 2* bloodied pole hook with power attack, took me ages to find the puncturing mod at a vendor (they‚Äôre everywhere now lol), it might not be the best bloodied weapon in the world but il never part with it, love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Plaugewalker scales off how many diseases you have
---
If you ever do that again, put that free vending machine and put it behind a locked door that you'll open only to 'noobies'
---
I have a giant statue in the middle of the yard i can't move or remove because apparently an item is in use.  I expect to never ever be able to get rid of it. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
same
---
Thank you üòÅ  You sound like me with Molotov cocktails!  I had to stop using them because I kept catching myself on fire. 
---
Your suicide bot reminded me of a funny story...I was talking to my boyfriend and made a comment about blowing my head off (it was used in context of having one of those days at work) and my phone started asking if I was going to commit suicide, the suicide prevention hotline information showed up on my screen, then it started calling it...without me ever touching the phone.  I had to quickly terminate the call. That‚Äôs when I turned Siri off!!  üòÇ  It‚Äôs great that they have the option for people that need it, but sometimes it butts in when it‚Äôs not needed. Better safe than sorry I guess.
---
Amalgams, they're slightly weaker for a higher cost.
---
If you‚Äôre melee you can attack while sprinting and it does more damage
---
Everything recently got the nerf hammer been running into empty locked level 3 safes
---
Yea you cant earn any atoms while in a private server... but no I think it should be cheap.. cuz if you start a new game and play till your lvl 25 or so you'll have about 500..
---
I did it last night and got stuck on a loading screen upon exiting the mine. Had to quit to home and restart.
---
And it would have to be a per server thing... not a monthly thing
---
I def would not call it useless. My weapon weight unyeilding Combat armor let's me carry around 70 or so weapons. Enough that I can get my daily caps and steel in 2 west tek runs.
---
My BE tweaked handmade only weighs like 2 lbs vs 22.not sure how that's useless.
---
Short answer, yes.
---
Yeah, I thought something like that.
---
Wait on PS4? I was trying to get the key fragment last night and there was 10 times more mole miners then when I watched my husband go through and get it. They all kept going after me üòÇ
---
First time I went through Lewisburg - mobs of high level mutants.
---
Went back some time later, noone else around - L6 scorched.
---
Same with Top of The World and the Palace of the Wind.
---
I finally got some to spawn by trigger the teapot quest
---
 I recall it got broken when they fixed some other recycling things like scrapping mods,  and had that mess of patch where they had combined different branches. 
---
Or something like that. I can't remember anymore but a lot of things got broken on that failed patch. They had some internal fuckup with that patch and it took several more patches to fix most of it.
---
Yeah, super low upload speed seems to be the issue. God damn I hate optus
---
Cuz I dont always want to play with people.. maybe just 1 or 2 friends.. no stores.. no events I got to wait for.. no need to server hopping to avoid others CAMP..
---
no issues here.
---
There is plenty to do and it keeps me coming back every day. So yes it's worth to take a second look at.
---
Ughhhh I guess I wrote this wrong. I‚Äôm not talking about armor with WWR. The Legendary WR trait on rifles is useless. It says 90% Reduced Weight but after modding it out it weighs maybe 1 or 2 lbs less than a regular rifle. I want the 90% Reduced Weight on the actual weapons to work like the armor does. Does that make sense?
---
Haven't got around to it yet, probably should, but... 
---
Still, gonna take your advice and find a high place to smile from, so thanks for that tip.
---
Once you put a "Prime" receiver on any possible weapon, you get the ability to make "Ultracite Ammo" at the bottom of the Tinker Bench crafting list. BUT YOU CAN'T NO LONGER USE the normal rounds anymore.
---
Generally the resources to make Ultracite ammo adds the need for 2 items to normal list. 1 Ultracite and 1 of [Violet/Crimson/Yellowcake/ or Florescent] flux. 
---
In my case it takes 1 Ultracite and 1 Violet Florescent flux additional to get the same 180, 5 mm rounds with Ammo Smith level 2 (for god sake, don't forget the Super Duper card! it it fires, you get 360!) 
---
I went from 197 per shell to 230 with the Ultracite with the prime receiver. They are MOST effective on the Scorched level 69 go down in 2 well placed shots. I'm level 200.
---
Some asshole got it removed, so here‚Äôs the original. If you craft a combat knife, there are two options for no upgrade. Go back and forth to complete the first challenge. I recommend checking the combat section in challenges for your progress. Keep modding the combat knife with the two no upgrades until you complete all the challenges. After finishing the first challenge, there should be two new challenges: mod edged melee weapons or blunt melee weapons. Either that or mod one-handed melee weapons or two-handed melee weapons. Just keep checking your combat section until you finish all the challenges, it should give you around 140 atoms if I remember correctly.
---
Yes, it really helps try to get the materials into the troughs though
---
Could have done with a bite animation. Just saying.
---
Mire life, it's real twisted when you start using herb/carnivore and eating literal unfilling garbage just to stack up diseases but hey it doesn't break stealth so I mean that's a fun thing to do with Tesla Coils
---
I agree
---
Corrected.. :)
---
Both great suggestions
---
Lol oops, actually I think I read it wrong. The only weight reducing weapons I have is my sledges that don't get any mods. Even still, 1-2 lbs for a weapon mod isn't near as bad as 20lbs. I def wouldn't call it useless.
---
This is purely opinion, but I thought it would look REALLY cool when I bought the outfit.   
---
It doesn't. It looks very stupid. Also, why would I put rounds in my hat?
---
&gt;let bulk autoscrap when crafting
---
No one was saying that. The problem was game was scrapping mods over bulk junk, when crafting.
---
Im fairly sure bulk was always scrapped when crafting.
---
And no one ever said let "scrap all" also scrap bulked junk, when scrapping normal junk.
---
Agree.
---
Look.. I love fallout.. I hate people
---
PA\_FastANIM.ba2 works fine for me by including it using sResourceArchiveMisc. I'm still working on editing and uploading videos demonstrating the PA\_FastANIM.ba2 with and without inclusion and I will need more time to do videos of the other mods that I use (I have to leave the house for awhile) but anecdotally they work fine and have for some months now (I switched to using sResourceArchiveMisc back when the author of the mod BetterInventory put the information on his mod description page). In the meantime feel free to test them for yourself you might get the answer you need before I can finish (later today).
---
Dick move, Bethesda.  Dick move.
---
recreate helgen down the road campers!
---
yes, persistent 100% of game time
---
Yes, I am sure. I have a commando character that uses auto-assault rifle. 2 days ago I got a 2* zealots assault rifle. I equipped it with the same mids and can drop a SB faster, using a third of the ammo as before.
---
Lol no problem man. Agreed I also have a Sledge and it‚Äôs beautiful at 2 lbs. but try having a handmade with that trait and mod it, it comes to something like 15lbs with all mods and the same weapon without weight reduction weighs something like 17, saving like 2lbs lol. That‚Äôs useless to me. Same thing applies to my heavy guns. It‚Äôs more a gun issue cause melee mods only require one mod for maximum output
---
Those guys have those awful giant but basically useless flak jackets and riot helmets. 
---
I was going for a more elite weapon specialist security officer- aka- SWAT.
---
Also, if you look at their current MTX pricing you see that an emote is $2 and they have sold in game items from between $2-$15 I‚Äôd suggest if they did servers they would be more expensive than any in game item, as A) people will pay it and B) they will think that people will rent servers for friends so say $20 a month for 4 friends is on $5 which isn‚Äôt bad.
---
Sounds like pinko bullshit, but okay.
---
um... PC here, having the same problem. First time it worked flawless, every time after its crashing a few seconds after the elevator lets out in the basement.
---
Each piece grants the following stacking bonus:
---
Improved Stealth in dark areas
---
Faster sneaking movement speed (+125 for full set)
---
Greatly reduced weight (each piece weights under 1 pound)
---
I love fallout... hate people.. if it was a monthly fee I wouldn't pay it.. it's not my fault they made a game that is cost so much to run
---
Mods really that heavy? Iv never really paid attention. I know that alot of people consider weight reduction as a wasted star on ranged weapons, especially shotguns. I do agree, I can think of a number of other stars I'd rather have.
---
Awesome man, thanks. I'll test them when I get the chance.
---
stashing it isn't going to help, as it will autoscrap from the stash if it needs the ingredients and the item is there. Take it from the guy carrying around a lot of bug parts and cooking oil, the only safeguard is physically dropping the items you don't want to scrap into a paperbag and picking them up when you are done.
---
Pic of backpack plz
---
Haha there it is, Optus :p 
---
Wouldn't happen to be raining where you are? My phone always has dodgy signal and data when wet haha
---
I did the event and got an okay drop... Don't be so salty. Its the best way to get legendaries at the moment.
---
Yes you are correct, the weight reduction should be applied to base gun and mods, now it‚Äôs only applied to base gun + initial mods.
---
It‚Äôs wrong and makes no sense.
---
Nah, no rain here. Just shitty internet lol
---
Yup anywhere from 1-4 lbs per mod.
---
That would make sense since I‚Äôm a melee only without PA
---
I used about 1000 rounds of 5mm and like maybe 5 stims. Not wearing any power armor. In a team of 4. Maybe it's just that you just need to play with better players...
---
Ok  thanks for the advice I'll try it out but again that isn't the point of the post Its to change the game mode.
---
You don't get any added benefit from having more than 1 piece of Chameleon.  You should ditch the other piece for something else.
---
That sounds pretty damn legit! Thank you for breaking it down!
---
raider armor mods, and raider power armor drop from lots of different things, but the actual plans to craft the armor itself are just not in most loot tables.
---
It's just to draw out the content length..
---
Like challenges with nonexistent items..
---
Great idea also display remaining time left so many events i gone to with less then a minute left and it fails and mr/miss game devs how many adding timers on the HUD time left on buffs or a warning its about to run out.
---
Join the club. I've tried to make posts about how I still have 0/5 motors crafted in the Early Warnings quest, and get downvoted.
---
Definitely
---
I‚Äôd buy a bunch off you. I‚Äôm sure others would as well.
---
It just makes sense. Think of Inert Flux as a per-dinner Anti-Acid
---
Are you sure it was 2000 and not 2006?
---
Thank you! Glad others see it that way
---
And at 10 or 20 atoms per.. so what 500 atoms gives you 50 server uses.. not to many.. then it would also get people to go into the regular modes just to earn a few dailys done so they cant do 1 or 2 private runs
---
yeah lost 3 bags of loot last night in arktos pharma because of this bug
---
THATS explains how the daisy cutter was 6lbs. I just couldn't fathom her a fat man could weight 60lbs without 90% reduced weight.
---
I know, and I get that. But I don‚Äôt want you to get your hopes up that something that is frankly impossible will happen. 
---
As an indie game dev I see people set themselves up for disappointment, and I don‚Äôt want them to announce it at $5 which would be a great price and you be upset by that cause your expectations were not formed with the needed info. I personally say it‚Äôll be $20+ but it will be impossible even if they owned google for servers to cost under $5 a month.
---
What you want to hope for is that they add an offline mode, as that shouldn‚Äôt cost you anything. It is possible as that‚Äôs how I expect they will do mods eventually. Have an offline mod mode and the ability to rent servers to play mods with friends. But they cost Bethesda money to run they will cost you money to use. The current ones are worked into their MTX etc.
---
I decided I wanted to try a melee build a few days ago... At least 30% of my hits don't register.
---
Tbh there‚Äôs no other way to see it.
---
Why is the effect applied to initial mods and not to other mods? Makes no sense.
---
If you're talking about nothing appearing in the boxes, that's happened to me a few times; when that happens at least the event is good for farming shotgun shells.
---
It's in the loot tables because it's in all the other loot tables. Don't act like this table was made from scratch, it's obvious that Bethesda copies and pastes as much as it can get away with.
---
Karma pays in caps!
---
I just want the freaking high level players to stop one shotting the Legendary mobs at the event before i can get a shot in. I've lost tons of potential loot because of these asshats.
---
Wait. Jumpsuits are worth money? I just throw all mine away because I never wear them, i had several BOS jumpsuits
---
I once woke to a scene in Jaws. I wonder how many more of these are out there.
---
Interesting, I play from about 1300 Central to 1900 Central and didn't crash once, did at least 6 new Arko events and didn't crash.  The only oddity I did notice is another way to enter nuke zones without power armor.  I'm not sure if it was a lag thing or not.  I'm doing more testing on it today before letting Bugthesda know how it works, no it isn't the PA trick on the edge of the circle either.
---
Delete all the game generated ‚Äúini‚Äù files and restart the game.  O.K. to keep your Fallout76Custom.ini file in place if you have one.  This worked for me, just not sure why, but don‚Äôt want to spend the time comparing minuscule changes.  Let nVidia use game settings.
---
I‚Äôve always enjoyed the heavy weapons. I do highly recommend doing a heavy weapon+power armor build if you do heavies though. Stabilized is just a fantastic perk with the accuracy bonus and the armor penetration. My 50 cal and my minigun just eat up almost anything I run across.
---
If someone has already bought the game, play it again and figure it out for yourself.
---
Ycs/186
---
The only time i didnt contract this. Was when i got the marsupiel disease (cant spell). Didnt even notice till my friend freak out at me jumping like a rat across a cave
---
Exactly! I just started to collect RW weapons and realized this. Would be nice to get this fix for sure so inventory weapons are actually a bit more manageable. Anyways hope somebody who can do something is reading  this üôÑ lol
---
The full imposter event...yea, be prepared to die.
---
Free range is easier with a couple of people.  
---
It's similar to the fascnacht parade - but fewer waves of lower level critters, but the boss is a @#$@4.  Last time I did it, there were 2x 'squatches, both L80, 1 legendary.
---
One player to steer the brahmin, the other two to fight off the critters.
---
Plain 'squatch all by its lonesome?   Can be tough, especially if its a legendary, but doable solo, even as melee.
---
No, I‚Äôm with you, would love bug, performance and QoL fixes, balance should be nice too.
---
Unfortunately the Bowie knife doesn't have a skin in the shop. I made that mistake when I bought the cool looking combat knife skin, and realized it wouldn't work because I have a Bowie knife.
---
I've done this. The downside is you can't share atomic shop stuff, which might not bother some people. If you can run both accounts it does make gear swapping and photo challenges a lot easier.
---
Exactly you get the idea
---
Oof the downvotes
---
? got a 3\* super sledge from a mutant in west tek
---
Well even more so now. Cheers.
---
Recipes - you will eventually get to the ingredient areas and then not have the recipe to make anything. Why take the chance? Or, alternatively, just don't buy recipes at all and pick them up as you go along.
---
What now..?
---
It can be frustrating sorting through someone‚Äôs four disorganized vending machines full of plans for basketball hoops and lion statues trying to see what weapons they have for sale, only two learn it‚Äôs an over priced nocturnal double barreled shotgun and a suppressor‚Äôs single action revolver.
---
I would hope that over time players will learn what sells and what a good selling price is.
---
Right but it asks for something like 12 Different creatures in total, but if you scroll down the list, ‚Äúcat‚Äù is the first of a long list of creatures that will fulfill the requirement.
---
You just have to take that total amount of pictures, not specifically the cat, or the rad roach, or the toad......just look at the list, count how many total creatures they allow to finish the quest.....you will see that they give you more categories than you need to finish it...so you do not have to do every single one, just enough to complete the requirement. Its like that with alot of the list ones.
---
There are more creatures on that list than you need to finish it.
---
I didnt take a picture of the cat, because you don‚Äôt have too.  I substituted a rad roach for the cat because its way easier to find those.
---
The assaultron one is a genuine bug that shouldn't be happening, and is unique in a waythat wasn't predictable. The effect that causes the assaultron head to irradiate the user is being incorrectly slotted into the first legendary mod slot, overwriting the first legendary effect on login, that effect has it's own special slot it should be going into instead, and normal ones dropped from enemies are correct, it's just the way the purveyor adds effects to weapons that is bugging out and putting the effect in the wrong field. 
---
Wood armor has been missing legendary attachment points since the beginning, and was never going to work without direct changes to the base items.
---
If it's not working in stormy weather, take a picture of something like an enemy, with their name in the upper righthand corner of the screen like you do for other challenges.
---
It doesn't need to be a radstorm, I took mine when it was raining. (If you're talking about the Survival Gun Challenge.)
---
My dog just got over them. The mutt must have given it to me. Teach me to go raw.
---
Purveyor actually gave me one good weapon so far, a quad explosive RR and I've been having great fun with it on xbox.
---
Debating making it full auto but don't have plans or mods so really need to find some first.
---
Yeah. I still have the 0/5 motors crafted for Early Warnings that has been preventing me from finishing the main quest line since the game released.
---
So, you don't have to be allies/teammates, just in the area?
---
Nice! There‚Äôs a couple of these I‚Äôll use! At Dolly Sods jump up on the roof and look towards the campground along the path past the ticks. There‚Äôs always a high level Yao Guai walking the path. I see l see one there every time.
---
That is a bug...
---
I think it‚Äôs like once a day or something, it‚Äôs quite a rare event
---
Don't take it personally...people got the suspicion that there might be downvote bots around here because even the newest posts instantly get downvoted
---
I love wood armor.  Great for stealth builds and low strength.  I heard that the three stars return to one star when you re-log.  That's a bad feel there.
---
think i misunderstood you. think its supposed to be a slim chance, but haven't read anything official on it no
---
You need to take a picture of an enemy or other thing during the storm with their name appearing in the upper righthand corner like other photo challengtes.  The challenge is written poorly.  Rainy weather worked for me.
---
NOICE
---
Right... and yet I‚Äôve heard over and over someone claiming it‚Äôs a bug. It‚Äôs just misinformation and people complaining.
---
Patch notes. Read them.
---
A three star enemy doesn‚Äôt always drop three star items. You are correct. We‚Äôve had discussions on here about it. It‚Äôs a greater chance but still random.
---
My Bowie knife with 40% faster swing speed, 10% damage if mutated, (I have twisted muscles), and plus 1 strength is amazing. The only thing that I could improve is if it had furious on it, but without it swings as fast as I can click. Great for smaller animals.
---
That's the best bit
---
That'a the crazy thing, (and one of the reasons I posted this) they did exit the power armor, I saw them do it. That's what made the whole thing so strange, and scary..
---
But it‚Äôs just not profitable to do so...
---
Then you haven't used reddit enough
---
I always make a feedback ticket in their [site too](https://help.bethesda.net/app/home).
---
I have found that when they disappear like this the body returns to its original spawn location. You may have to do some detective work to figure out where that may be but I have been able to retrieve a few \* of legendaries that way.
---
I have a Bowie knife with 40% swing speed, +1 strength, and more damage if mutated (I have twisted muscles), i don't like bloody, so it works well.
---
Well I hope it gets noticed and fixed soon I have a great idea for a bar/vendor shop in the bog!
---
Ok gotcha... I just occasionally play with some randoms who just can‚Äôt accept it isn‚Äôt a bug. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt understand
---
It is
---
It gave me no indication it was doing anything, but kept force closing the app saying it takes too long to start
---
Then all of a sudden, it just worked. Patch magically downloaded
---
It fires off once an hour and there are a shit ton of high level assaultrons and stuff to keep you busy. I have explored the map and I‚Äôm not there very long before it starts.
---
Thanks, so just an enemy in the normal rain?
---
Lol.....
---
I have in the past, unfortunately, adulting is priority and by the time I run through the silo, my game time is usually up and I do not get to collect the fruits of my labor!!
---
BTW I am PC....
---
It's like the other photo challenges, you need to target an enemy with the nameplate in the upper righthand corner during the storm. The challenge isn't written well.
---
Ahhhhhh thanks man. I‚Äôll be putting one in. Can‚Äôt hurt right . Thank you dude

I won‚Äôt kill them cry baby just for the research I unloaded a clip of shotty on them nothing
---
This is intentional and was introduced, afaik, via the December 4th patch.
---
Speak with a Scout Leader indeed.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. The chance rate feels like about 80% to me.
---
My gripe for the last 4-5 months!  
---
I also had to run around and re-kill insects the other night due to scrapping quest parts...
---
What about Gatling Plasma?! :P
---
I forgot another issue:
---
FT to a player Vendor and end up stuck in part of their structure (happens to me 30-50% of the time). BGS, lets please have landing pads of our choice for incoming FTs.
---
Thanks, on PC - I'm not as dedicated to farming as I could be I'll admit. Plus I should have known to wait a while before buying anything!
---
Good luck we should stop doing those challenges that force players to take certain pictures wearing certain items in certain places.
---
Make a statement that these are bs I rather get a perfect preserved pie from a machine
---
... because it looks cool?

... because, just in case?

I don't know

You should, Redditors can be...... harsh.

Fallout 76 &gt; Feedback ticket &gt; Gameplay (or something)
---
People pay a lot to get that one...
---
Yeah, that's pretty freaking stupid. I just bulked up all my cloth and then went out scavenging then scrapped it on accident.
---
You are so fast. And thanks for doing this!
---
During the event I‚Äôve noticed the turrets will attack the friendly but I think that‚Äôs by design.
---
I had to play hide and seek with one at whitesprings. It stayed under a lot, until I baited it by getting off the bus and walking around. It was not fun.
---
Each of them increases the damage of two handed weapons, so slugger, expert and master all increase your damage.
---
well, damn... was hoping that rumor would prove to be true.
---
I'm on most nights on xbox, check my store I think I have table plans for sale from most of my characters really cheap (50-100 caps or something).
---
If I find I have an extra set then you're welcome to just have them but I'd need to see if I have more than one spare.
---
Yep! I did a scorched in savage divide during the rain (I don't know if there was lightning, I can't tell.)
---
I‚Äôm asking if slugger and expert slugger stack for instance
---
Drop something , wait until bag materializes under you.
---
Move on , you must wait there‚Äôs a slight delay , don‚Äôt blame the bag disappearing when you can‚Äôt stand still for half a minute just to do things properly
---
Why do people keep asking for this thinking it's reasonable? Bethesda is never going to get rid of low rolls. It's part of the legendary grind. If every piece of armor was a 3-star heavy combat piece, everyone would have them, the game wouldn't be fun, and you play the game less.
---
Besides, if you're going to complain about low rolls, armor is absolutely not the way to go. A good roll on wood armor is way more valuable than a worse roll on stronger armor; with armor, it's more about the affixes than the stats. If you want to complain, complain about the fact that there are only like 3 good melee weapons and the rest are rolling pins and pool cues, which are worthless no matter how good the legendary afixes are.
---
Yes they do.
---
Whenever I do it, its 100% on accident, like forgetting to swap to my normal sledge frok my super
---
Wow okay thanks
---
huh? where...oh, sorry...case of snot-ear, don'cha kno...
---
More than agree. Players dont seem to think to guard more than one target anyway. They dont realise reward would be better if all three are alive. I have mention that on my mic but they simply ignored me and I ended up defending second animal by myself. Third one died.
---
How did you get it to 0?

Thank God I built my favorite camp prior to the last patch. Good to know but sucks it's happening. I had the "item is floating" a lot though...so my decor is randomly placed and my upper floors don't have enough beans for support (in my RL building skills opinion).
---
This game was worth buying at launch.  Don‚Äôt listen to the negativity. I‚Äôve been playing this since BETA and yes there have been plenty of bugs but no more than Skyrim or Fallout 4 ever had. If you want to play it, play it.
---
Seems to happen to me mostly when at other people's camps. It won't register unless I leave their actual camp area sometimes, when shopping their vending machines.
---
I just love it paired with my new plague doctor mask and drifter coat. But make the colours would be off
---
Put a light barrel on it
---
Wood armor is bugged and reverts to one star after restarting the game, so until it's fixed, this is a perfectly reasonable request.

On a funny note - I have satellite radio in my car as I spend a lot of time on the road and I always listen to the old time radio - playing all the old time radio shows like The Shadow, Jack Benny etc. etc. In the last month or two I've been hearing all kinds of the songs from Appalachia radio getting played...hell just heard Fred Astaire trying to sing 'pistol packing mama' was just hilarious. On two different shows I heard Dorothy Lamoure and George Burns both singing the same song. Ever since I started playing Fallout 76 I've been really noticing those songs a lot more than I used to. Great fun.
---
Uh... My sucess rate is 100% @ lv 47 with 3 other team members under 100... You might just need to get better.
---
The Creation Club version had a completely different animation that doesn't match with how the Gauss actually works.
---
I bought 20 bucks worth of atoms just to complement my atom wallet since I went out the country for a few days and I was missing some of those daily‚Äôs for a few days I got all 4 horsemen for the power armor ( even tough I don‚Äôt use power armor , fuck logic huh) just because I really liked them ... 
---
But other then that hardly think I would do it again as the incentive in return it‚Äôs almost close to zero.
---
Bugs like discovering (Grafton dam) and other that are supposed to give out free atoms haven‚Äôt been fixed since release date ( being something so simple )
---
But don‚Äôt let them give a frickkng cat topiary because they will patch that ASAP 
---
Pissed me off to just realized things like this but bleh...
---
Karma is just dumb fake internet points there is no value and you can‚Äôt exchange them for anything and is a flawed system in general that said I don‚Äôt live on this website like you do to farm it and boost the low self esteem and ego you have

&gt; or constantly having to use radaway.
---
Hoping you meant disease cure; Radaway actually increases your chance of contracting a disease.
---
We might have to wait for "the ultimate vault tech patch bundle!" Available for a limited time only for the low cost of 2000 atoms! Get it quick dwellers!
---
Nope hazmat suits count as armor
---
Now test the actual number of caps you get when you sell (just remember you're losing at least 10% of your caps when you do this!).  Assuming you didn't check that at the same time.
---
Report is that people are getting little to know caps for the purchases, as though the 'tax' on the ammo is much greater than 10%.  So if you sell 1000 ammo at 1 cap (1 cap seems to be a trigger, or at least one of them), you get the erroneous message about the number bought, but supposedly you'd only actually receive a few caps from that instead of the 900 you should.
---
People have been complaining about it, but I haven't seen anyone actually test it under controlled conditions, and I haven't heard of anyone providing proof (like a video, not that that's absolutely necessary).
---
Fair enough, I didn't realize that was the case. But then the reasonable request is to fix the wood armor bug, not remove legendary wood armor drops entirely.
---
This is true wasteland scouts spirit right there Ladys and Gents!
---
Let me know when you do that.....

This just in, masochist wants to make the gamer harder for everyone else
---
That's terrible.  Thank you.
---
IDK why everyone is so butt hurt over this guy taking people's junk upon their deaths...I do it too, I relish on it. Dead players mean free shit. If they didn't wanna lose it maybe next time they will stay alive longer.
---
Otherwise, I've tried this event 6 times and failed all 6 times. Each attempt we have animal alive when the alpha comes, seconds later the friendly animal dies and we fail, Everytime
---
On my old charecter I just ran around in a hazmat with chameleon thinking it was just broke but nope they are protective
---
The patch before the most recent. Same with melee weapons. Broke my heart. üòî
---
Then there's me that hates doing this event and it seems like it's active as soon as it gets dark. Notifications would definitely be nice.
---
&gt;Anything that can be used for crafting should be protected as well
---
That is everything.. you truly asking for pure manual scrapping..
---
SB are end game opponents. If you have a good build &amp; end game gear then they are no problem to take down. I run a VATS Sneak/Crit build with various double crit rifles. My handmade can take one down in half a clip. Personally I wish the SB were stronger
---
why did they do that?\`:(
---
Also drinking dirty water.
---
Well... Last night after the update I got about 1.5-2 hours of playing in... Running around killing things with my crossbow for the badge and looking in containers for the camera. Never did come across one.
---
However, I went back to my CAMP at the end of the session to craft/repair and when I listed only craftable items at the bench it showed up that I could make the camera! So I guess I either picked one up or it was added to my inventory!
---
The crawling ghouls happens when you don‚Äôt properly load the world , do you spawn inside whitesprings and run like crazy while the world is loading in ?
---
As for the bodies same rule of thumb don‚Äôt kill them to fast and loot as you kill , the game can only render so many piles ( do you use bloody mess? ) so be thoughtful that just like you they might be another 23 people on the server.
---
This is an online server game , you guys have to account the load time and pinging of stuff , seems like Bethesda don‚Äôt rely on fast servers ...
---
Leave my wood armor ALONE.
---
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. All you need to do is hit the enemy once. You don‚Äôt have to kill them. Why rush to one-shot kill?
---
I played PVP mode for almost an hour last night and saw one player waltzing through.  I was farming XP in stealth and he left me alone and I left him alone.  
---
Yes, there are occasions where you see multiple players duking it out at the WS train station but honestly that‚Äôs more uncommon than common.  
---
I‚Äôve had more PVP situations recently in Adventure mode.  Not sure why people feel the need to ‚Äúswipe‚Äù you or shoot you to draw your attention to visit their camp but it‚Äôs happened twice to me in the last 24 hours.  The first time it happened I was checking out my stash box and I got tapped several times by an opposing player so I nuked and blasted him.  He seeks revenge (of course) and as I was at the vendor trading ganks me and takes my shit!  So I catch him later and take back my stuff and he starts shooting again.  Cmon man. 
---
So PSA to other players I will gladly check out your camp and what you have for sale but if you tap or shoot me to hurry up the process you will get lit up.
---
I use a Whitespring run to top off a level-up for the daily challenges often, and routinely walk away with at least 3-4.
---
The shop owner yes  but I look around the map and see  numerous shops with 2-6 people while the event is going on.
---
I accidentally found out the other day too! Awesome addition.
---
Because they really like to fix "bugs" that benefit players...
---
Find the solution ! 
---
Here, just made a little thing to explain it simply : [https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6853/qa0Fre.jpg](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6853/qa0Fre.jpg)
---
For me it's good, i've the weapon. ;)
---
Thanks for the reply, wasn't sure if it was just the once or what
---
Oh trust me... I know it will never happen and if it did it would be expensive..
---
Have both, love RDR2 campaign but regarding online Fallout 76 is miles better, it‚Äôs not even close.
---
For the first issue, what weapon are you using?
---
Radical! Radical! Worms!
---
Alright, thanks for the reply, wasn't sure if it was just me
---
Nah he said that because of the increased radiation intake caused by the worms.
---
I'm getting them so much I don't even bother to cure them now.
---
BE LEVER
---
You could always carry a lower level gun as a curtesy.
---
Have you used it yet? They're really bad in my opinion.
---
Blast because there‚Äôs a dude with a bigger blast and less sharing intentions.
---
Sorry but if you don‚Äôt like it block the person and server hop you will never bump in to him again ( unless your in survival ) because who gives a shit about consistency
---
Bethesda really should consider taking a second look at the Molerat mechanic in this game. 
---
First of all they need a longer cooldown between each time they burrow towards you. As it stands now you literally cannot run away from them. They burrow or ‚Äúteleport‚Äù to you so quickly no amount of running speed in game can escape them on foot. And no creature in this game should be unescapable. 
---
Secondly no Molerat should be able to burrow through the roof of any building. If I jump on top of Whitesprings Resort it defies logic that the Molerat can borrow through that place in seconds to reach me. I‚Äôve had them borrow to the tops of trucks to get me. Makes no sense and just makes the Molerats feel somewhat broken. 
---
Thirdly they really could could use a much shorter attack range. As it stands right now a Molerat can successfully bite you from a few feet away. That one might be harder to code as it‚Äôs probably just based around our characters hitbox. 
---
And fourthly jumping away from a Molerat should be treated as a block mechanic. If I jump over a Molerat from a few feet away I almost always still get bite by said Molerat midair. You cold be floating 20 feet above the Molerats head in a Jetpack and the darn things can still land a bite on you.
---
Wait what!? I was sure it didn't do that? Mine hasn't done it I'm sure same with certain ingredients. Unless that's from a mod I had (save my stuff) which I stopped using when I had to reinstall that game again the other day as I didn't think it did anything üò±
---
no problem bro!
---
Only green rad-storm works :
---
Adventure is same as before besides pacifist protects you and your camp, can no longer get "murdered" for being in pacifist. Survival is pretty much all out PvP with no fast traveling (besides your camp and play stores if I'm correct, the stores one not being intentional I assume.) You get more exp in survival if I'm correct but not really much to make it worth it in my opinion, other wise only real reason is to get the weekly survival weapon challenge finished for a "named" gun that you 100% could get as a drop.
---
Thank you man. Ticket has been submitted
---
And unfortunately the cannonballs don't weigh 0.
---
The most interesting thing about that
---
If there are bugs like melee VATS not working for weeks, challenges not doable since it's not in game yet (the lost camera week...) or challenges which are bugged since ever - Beth: **YOLO** *investigating*
---
If there are Atom Shop items accidently for free (even we talk about just 50-100 atoms worth) - Beth: **hotfixfixfixfixquickfixohmagadwerelosingatoms**
---
I have the same issue with a railway rifle. Try cycling out of vats and back in. That usually resets the issue and can be a player fix until Bethesda fixes the bug.
---
Jesus
---
But it‚Äôs bugged ?
---
though it was a feature =)
---
Looks like I may be shelling out 6000c for t60 Stealth Boy plans after all!
---
No , you have 3 points in luck and then you could get a backpack with a cooler so you tripping boy
---
Thank you too for doing it, maybe they fix it!
---
Or... you can do the even that gives power armor plans
---
Yeah, I cycle out, but it's annoying in the middle of multiple enemies, where I need to make the kill asap.
---
I started leveling a new character, have Pharma Farmer equipped. Stocking up on the disease cures, have about 10 so far - so by the time I start farming ghouls, they'll last about 4 hours.
---
I would say adventure mode; survival mode has a lot of tryhardas and you don‚Äôt gain anything extra by playing in survival other than a 20% bonus XP, the weekly weapon challenges can be ONLY done in survival mode if you want to complete the challenge to get the weekly weapon. That‚Äôs pretty much it, good luck to you out there too :)
---
Yes! 
---
I'd also like them to add quick swapping perk card sets at some point because I spend a while after zoning in here and at encryptid swapping out my 'walking around' perk cards for heavy offense/defense to do these more intense events.
---
Never know. Definitely worth 5 minutes if my time though lol
---
Companions are already in the game, go make a friend
---
Thx for the response.l
---
The real question stands.. Is the game worth it? (jken of course)
---
[We *do* indeed love it!](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151) 
---
It's incredibly helpful and makes the game far less lonely, even if you're just chatting about stuff while you travel.
---
They were amazing in fo4, they made them very Un practical here. As we speak my dude in fo4 is holding a broadside, waiting for me to come back.
---
It's pure luck i'm afraid. You might get a 3\* or you might end up with a drill.....roll the dice.
---
Or the sweet rolls. I suppose cranberry cobbler will do in pinch.
---
The diffuser is a drop from the event so...
---
More like 5 percent.
---
Please learn to use Google.
---
I was also wondering this....and if theres different loot outcomes from completing the event, dependent on which creature u rank up or area??
---
As my post says... *waited several minutes*.
---
I havent done the other two but I feel like one could totally be a mirelurk queen. If they wanted all 3 to be powerful like a deathclaw. I could be wrong though xD.
---
We need a clear, ‚ÄúIs it worth playing‚Äù sticky if there isn‚Äôt one lol
---
Also get it to delete reposts. Idk how many times I've seen rug posts and garden posts, but I see them literally every day and its annoying.
---
Did they ever implement a proper reload animation for the single action?
---
This is your daddy's wrist watch, while captured in battle and held prison, he hid it up his ass from the enemy for 5 years, until he died of dysentery. Then out of honor for the man, I then hid it up my ass for 2 more years before we were rescued. And now son, I give the watch to you, may you always wear it proudly.
---
Right or left bumper once or twice then back has work instead of backing all the way out.
---
Nope.  Purifiers aren't refrigerators. That water isn't cold and it isn't for them to just take.  If I have extra and they want some I'll manually share it.  I don't want it disappearing when I need to use it.
---
Me too , but seems like we getting a battle royale mode or some sort of pvp mode
---
Me, too. But I rebuild ,y camp every other day, and I always use that floor. It was worth it for me!
---
Yes there were issues where Hardened and Glowing masses were in junk. The wonderful fix was to move them to "Aid" that worked well.. If they really want a pure fix, but more work on their part, it would be a "Bulk" tab in the pip-boy...
---
but..
---
Do you drop these as junk upon death?
---
They might mess up the auto-break of junk bulk during crafting.
---
Great tip! Thanks for sharring man
---
You used 2 rubber, 4 adhesive, 7 screws, 3 springs, 6 steel, and 4 wood to craft this weapon? Here‚Äôs 2 wood and 1 steel as scraps.
---
The solution would be to give hazmat suits and the start inside the Vault and that whenever inside your camp you could take stuff off or indoors or whatever
---
There are few diseases I will cure when doing PvE honestly.
---
instigating (double damage) + exploding.
---
Yea, it'll work for a while, especially if its an auto.  What caliber?
---
You mean the frog habitat counts now? And the stim diffuser might drop from the new event (total speculation on my part)
---
I've just been "grinding" the challenges lmao.. thought there was an easier way just wasn't sure.. but heck.. fallout is such an awesome game and you'll get to see almost most of the map when completing the challenges so I don't mind doing them. Only need the carry weight mod then I'm done
---
yea the frog works now but the music one doesn‚Äôt still
---
Oh I know. This bug has gotten me killed many a times. Usually by a super sledge to the head.
---
Oh, that makes *much* sense!
---
Saw Oxhorn.  Looked like he got a Level 100 Grafton Monster.
---
I think the thought is....since fixing the misapplied coding to make 3\* wood a reality is apparently a difficult task...the short fix is don't let the Purveyor award Wood for a 3\* purchase since it isn't really a 3\* purchase...
---
I'm really scratching my head on why the handmade hasn't gotten a skin. That's, arguably, one of the most popular guns in the game. 
---
And one reason I love having skins for my main weapons is because they won't show up on trade menus, when scriping, selling at vendors and vending machines, etc so it's a little piece of mind over the favorites notification.
---
Did the impostor sheepsquatch event and after it was completed the impostor body disappeared.
---
This is the problem with the ‚Äútag‚Äù system. It feels stupid and is easily exploitable. I can carry a level 1 player through a SBQ fight. He/she just needs to hit the SBQ once with a pipe pistol and then hide. Every MMO ever made had a similar problem but most of them figured it out quickly. Not Bethesda though.
---
So did i ....its bullshit.
---
And inventory management!
---
Amen
---
As others have said, they‚Äôre really bad, and ammo is expensive and weighs a ton.
---
Even worse. That‚Äôs a tough event for your ammo...
---
Sry to hear
---
It's incredible isn't it.
---
There's nothing to be ashamed about. I have slain many creatures in my lifetime... Scorchbeast Queens, Super Mutant Behemoths, Wendigos... If it bleeds, I will kill it.
---
But those damn molerats still seem to get under my radar and before I know it, there's one gnawing on my ankle.
---
So take pride in your accomplishments and do not worry about the little missteps we all make. We are, in the end, only human.
---
There was a small period of time (like 1 week) where they killed the auto break-apart of bulk for crafting. Oh man it was a very bad time for Fallout 76.
---
They acknowledged it an fixed it quick time reporting it as "opps"
---
I have a two shot version, only ever used it for squirrels when I get bored.
---
BoS under armor isn't super rare on the whole. I think the officer uniform plan is rare-ish but the fatigues are common. Here's a post with the best list of outfit drops I've seen.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9wogg/_/
---
As did I. üòù It isn't the end of the world though, since I use a stealth build.
---
It was unintended and also unnecessary as a mechanic. PVE DR is fine as is now (and before) the increased DR due to condition. PvP DR on the other hand.....I'm sure enough people have said by now.
---
Is that the scientific answer to this burning question?
---
What event gives T-60 mod plans?
---
Just talked to someone with the same issue but on a lever action rifle. So maybe this isn't a projectile issue.
---
It just works.....
---
I use the same. It hasn't been that prevalent for me but I've definitely noticed it. Almost like the explosive effect makes it inaccurate like the two shot. Hope it gets fixed.
---
People said this about the fasnacht event, wasn't true. People said this about open range, wasn't true. 
---
Stop blaming weapons on your failures.
---
We can still hope...one day we might get fixes for serious bugs
---
Highly unlikely that Bethesda would allow you to edit a character locally and have that be the defining source for what your character is.  WAY too many ways to exploit the whole system if that were allowed.
---
Tired of switching perk cards?  Just edit the card limit to 1000!  Don't get the drop you wanted?  Just edit into your save file!  Out of caps?  Hey, there's a way around that!
---
More than likely (though there's no way to know for sure without digging into the game files, which I don't have the understanding to do), your character 'name' (or whatever information Bethesda needs to associate your character with the server files) is stored locally, but all the actual data is on the server where it's safe from prying eyes (and character editors).  Even if all your information was only stored locally, but in an encrypted state, it wouldn't be terribly hard to figure that all out and game the system.

It‚Äôs in cranberry bog it‚Äôs distant thunder
---
Thx. I will try that. I talked to someone with the same issue on a lever action rifle. So I definitely think it is not weapon specific.
---
I do however much charge they have left - for example, a core with 75% charge will be 75c, and one at 50% will be 50c and so on
---
So this is for lose baring
---
Honourable mention for Wood Legendaries?
---
Btw are they rare or common events, I‚Äôve done around 5 or so before but still don‚Äôt see them often
---
I‚Äôm only selling 100% charged, currently at 110c to account for the tax haha, might bring them down to around 90c to try and get them gone faster haha
---
This. Paperbags are very unreliable, I lost several legendary weapons when it simply vanished. I saw it sat there, the next minute it was gone. Use suitcases lunch pails and sacks instead. Trash cans don‚Äôt work, they only hold 20 pounds or something, but little lunch pails are like bottomless pits, you can dump everything in them.

I got a drill this morning from the 3* lvl100 sheepsquatch in atkos pharma.....annoying. Pretty sure theres on on the shelf in there u can just pick up.

Bethesda really should consider taking a second look at the Molerat combat mechanics in this game. As they come off as ‚Äúbugged‚Äù to your average video game player.
---
Secondly; no Molerat should be able to burrow through the roof of any building. If I jump on top of Whitesprings Resort it defies logic that the Molerat can borrow through that place in seconds to reach me. I‚Äôve had them borrow to the tops of trucks to get me.

That'd be great.

Also, I wish more of the dailies would be available through the personal terminal.  Right now, it's just the Biv and Scout quests.  Why not add in stuff like Queen of the Hunt or Ecological Balance?

This bug usually happens when you log into a world, usually I wait a little bit for the world to load up, about 20 seconds, and then fast travel. If it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs camp that your fast traveling to and they just got into the server it may take a while to load in meaning you can‚Äôt fast travel to it. 
---
Just some advice on the bug
---
Ok thanks. So now, is Ammo Smith some kind of perk card?
---
You can report them for spam
---
Melee/sniper build in Excavator PA. Have all the swing speed perks, and a couple of rifle perks for armor penetration, and fireproof 1.
---
Have taken out about 10 SBs so far.
---
 I get acceptable results with an Executioners combat rifle against L50 SBs.  
---
Takes time and about 200 rounds, but it works.
---
If they are within reach when they land, switch to Vampire switchblade, blade of bastet, cultists dagger, or Black diamond.  Otherwise, keep unloading the rifle.
---
@ L83, took out L65 SBs with an Anti-Armor LMG.
---
Mr. Searchy is your friend.
---
I do but they are like the Hydra: report one, 3 more posts appear!

yeah in the german translation even some of the new event objectives and many of the enemies and npcs are labelled as "mod:heavy barrel" or something else....it's hilarious when your only event objective is "Predators incoming! mod:heavy barrel"
---
My event runs fine everytime I do it
---
I know what youre talking about, but thats not this bug. This one occurs when just free roaming. I have had it happen to me numerous times while doing scrap runs.
---
You can't login different characters of the same account simultaneously. He's obviously farming the badges and selling the plans
---
Yep, got it a couple of times, also, when managed to enter there¬¥s invisible enemies, waiting for a hotfix...
---
Not if you want an immersive gameplay experience that you can enjoy solo. Never going to be.
---
dual clienting is the real P2W. No joke... free fast travel point, easy muling, your choice of shared perk cards, easy enabling of strange in numbers and herd mentality (not to mention shared empath), more player vendor space (this one‚Äôs awesome; my second account sells all the equipment; since he‚Äôs always home people can always inspect my wares), easy muling (hell my primary 2nd acct character, I call him farmer john, has all the weight reduction perks, 3 pieces of weapon weight reduction armor, plus good with salt and homebody; he‚Äôs my real stash.)
---
Not that I've seen (and I've sen a lot :P )
---
I thought that maybe they would despawn/move if attacked by NPCs, as I've seen that happen a lot.  That may be related, but it's not the only time I've seen it.
---
Just last night, I had ghouls in WS attacking the entrance, and one I killed 'moved'.  I saw the inventory and it poofed as I was looking.   A few seconds later I noticed the corpse (now a meat/ash pile)  was sitting on top of a car a few feet away.  Same inventory.  At no point did I see the ghoul on top of the car, so either it chose a random spot to spawn, or the server thought that's wher eI killed it and eventually put it there.  *Definitely* wasn't at the original spawn point.
---
Same here. I don't need to buy anything and always close to max cap limit so if they sell or not is really not important
---
Google "Green Hood Fallout" and you'll see a bunch of images. It's the same item as the assault gas mask minus the frontal mask (and enviro protection). Not the easiest item to find, but check around whitesprings and the Pleasant Valley Railroad station - at the station it is under the head of the skeleton who is laying on the luggage.
---
Pustules..
---
I'm enjoying it solo.
---
Yes it does. Got the plans for it for the first try.
---
It makes 3 difuser (6 with perk card) and it costs a super stimpak and junks.
---
Happy now?
---
YES please!!!!!!

I keep coming back in this sub reddit to see if onky ONE thing is changed...actual customization and paint jobs IN GAME.  Anthem is getting raked over the coals for not having proper customization in game and f076 seems to get off Scot free.  It's an mmo lite you need tk add in skins and paints for everything and you need tk add them in game not your stupid shop.  Shop should be reserved for the really intense and cool ones made by developers.  Or wacky ones etc. *sigh* guess I'll wait some more and keep f076 dusty on the shelf.  It may seem small but it's a semi big deal to me that I cant earn in game customization options.

&gt;my second account sells all the equipment; since he‚Äôs always home people can always inspect my wares
---
This has been fixed FYI.  I verified last night (as I'm sure 1000 other people did).  You don't need to be at your base for customers to view your item's full stats.
---
The terminal is not necessary, Just go to Arktos Pharma Building and take the elevator downstairs (I don't know if there are more than one, but if there are, the right one will say something about being 50+ when you aim at the button)
---
AND the revive requests
---
SB can drop ultracite receivers. I killed 2 at one time last week and both had the plans.
---
I tend to kill a lot of SBs as the meat is yummy.
---
I don't know why this was removed, I can still see it on my profile page though. I thought this was part of the game.
---
You‚Äôre probably right. I just started using it a little over a month ago and I only follow certain things.  And usually when I don‚Äôt agree with something or like it I just move on. I usually steer clear of drama on posts (funny since this post was full of it) just because I don‚Äôt want to deal with it and am here to enhance my gaming experience by sharing things with people that enjoy the same things as me. üòÅ
---
You're a sick player. Dad joke.
---
Hmmm...I need to be revived too.
---
No. Nope. Nada. Not gonna happen.
---
We found a Sheepsquatch, level 100 3*. Two times... :)
---
Yeah, full heavy weapons and explosives build my two shot one only does 450 damage. It's fun to screw around with but not something I take out in hard fights.
---
It is utterly horrible but so much fun at the same time, took like 10 cannonball for a measly lvl 20 protectron
---
Yes, but thats the alpha. I am asking about the creatures you must defend
---
Hey I just want to say thanks for not being a dick üòÇüòÇ a response sometimes is better than a " Google search"
---
Great so another update that some how manages to be terrible on launch. And it looks good aswell, ah well guess we can't grind it till a week or so from now when more complaints arise and they somehow find a solution.
---
Yes, but i am not looking for the alpha. I am asking about the friendly creature you must defend
---
Sounds like a mule. You definitely weren't a jackass for seizing the moment.
---
It's because this event is actually designed to be completed in a group, not like the burrows that can be soloed.
---
Arktos Pharma Dungeon crashes if a player E X I S T S
---
I melee in PA, and, for the most part, usually use a fast vampire weapon.
---
I am asking about the friendly creature you must defend, not the alpha. Sorry
---
The mob returning to its original spawn point makes the most sense (at least I can come up with some logic why it does that), but that would assume you actually *knew* where that is :P  If you're running around a familiar area, it might help (like the WS area), but out in the world?  Good luck with that! :P
---
Lololol two people didn't care to reply, not only reply but they said more than a article would. If you don't like the post why even comment on it?
---
Either google that answer or PLAY the game to find out. 
---
Why do you want someone to tell you what your opinion should be?
---
Oh, sorry.
---
I remember a ghoul for the molerat habitat (for the goo feeding grounds, rank1)
---
And a glowing yuo gai for the radstag area, rank2
---
Clear your cache.
---
I haven't had any issues so far.
---
I've started downvoting all of them. I stopped reading or responding to them, just downvote and move on.
---
I do this as well. Tis' a solid idea.
---
I definitely agree!  The SBQ &amp; ISS have a server wide notification, so this should as well.
---
Vault 76 hat?
---
I‚Äôve had three times in a row where the first supervisor audio cue played but it never spawned. The last two would appear as normal. This morning it worked fine.
---
Is any video game truly "worth it"?  We are bags of meat and water on a rock traveling through space without our consent or control.  Our time is finite.  Its ending unknown.  Our genes cry out for survival and duplication.  The cosmos itself is a mystery we're still working out in tiny bursts in the strikingly small number of instances where a handful of us are gifted enough to be smart and privileged enough to be educated.  Otherwise we are lost, confused, pointed in too many directions at once, and often lack the foresight to make good choices even when given every advantage.  Any concerns we have about all of this are ultimately futile, as we will die and be forgotten anyway.  Nothing a single one of us ever did will endure.  Our species, our planet, our galaxy, and even our universe will one day vanish.  No trace of us ever having been here will exist.
---
Or maybe these people could fire it up themselves and see what they think.  idk
---
Tbh hard for people to just help others without the "oh search google always works" lol
---
Who are these people that cannot form their own opinions and have NEVER used a search engine? Do they live in the same time period as the rest of us?
---
One more thing the auto-moderator should definitely be setup to police.
---
Revive posts are at least relevant. This is probably the best/easiest platform to find help.
---
I've seen it happen once, at the queen. I didn't go check it out tho
---
I just started writing nonsense wall-o-text answers to whatever they ask.
---
Why don‚Äôt you use the favorite wheel or whatever?
---
I quit for a period so idk if they changed the scrap results from advanced power armor pieces. Back in BETA I feel as if I would constantly break down torso's and helmets I found in the wild to good result. Recently I noticed it's like... 2 steel.
---
thanks for answer. Unfortunately it didn't work for me :(
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
There's real information overload in general with this quest.  If you jump in blind, you will be completely overwhelmed.  And even if you know what you're doing, you'll be overwhelmed.  There's only so much a player can process on-the-fly.  Many had trouble balancing the Pylons with the Imposter Sheepsquatch, even despite its big, clunky exposition dump, and yet here we have a quest where it's kind of like having three distinct sets of pylons and three Sheepsquatches, all at the same time.
---
Yeah, it's hard, but so is any chaotic mess.
---
ToTW proper scales enemies - if you are getting 50's, then higher level players around, or have been around recently.
---
Revisit later - you'll get lower level enemies. 
---
That said, if you get into the buildings just behind top of the world - those will always be higher level.
---
BTW, Lewiston, Palace of the wind, mega red rocket, and a few other places along the western edge of the divide also scale.
---
@L20, suggest roaming the toxic valley for a while....@30 start the excavator and mysteries quests, get back to ToTW in the process, and pick up roses quests.
---
Have you submitted it to the Retired Topics link?  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=fo76&amp;utm_content=t5_jrw25
---
I got tired of every third post being a request for more songs on Appalachia radio day in and day out and submitted it there. The turn around time was really quick.
---
Hahaha I know it's a joke mate.
---
Just beat the bitch with a rocket hammer and call it a day.
---
one of my friends suggested going to a high place like top of the world and looking around because you can see storms from a distance and then you know where to go(or server hop until you find a server that has a storm)
---
Bruh
---
I'd also like the option to not repeatedly hear the crappy intro audio for events I happen to be passing in and out of range for and have no intention of wasting my time doing.
---
Sort it with "Y" first. Hit it twice, it'll only show that machines inventory, with unassigned stash items under. I haven't had a scrolling issue since I started doing this.
---
the motto is: do whatever it takes to move ever upward
---
Will check when I log on tonight...  something like limb damage and reload speed...
---
Have you enjoyed the cool challenges you can‚Äôt even complete without a teammate? What about the badges?
---
Why waste your time on this post? Human answers are better. They give alittle more insight. I haven't played since 3 weeks after launch. So maybe the article I read online, the game mode might of been updated and I might not know? You sound like you have Alot of friends üòÇ
---
And players are moaning that this game cant be played solo! Way to think outside the box :)
---
What if there was just a part of the map that had a list of all the events, and which events are on at the moment and which are not. It could also allow you to mark the event, and if you are the leader of your team, it will display if the event is on or not in the top-right corner. It‚Äôs a rough idea, so if any of you have any recommendations or opinions, I would love to hear them.
---
Can you include a map of the area drawn in crayon? It's a bit of a maze.
---
Bloody screws ü§¨
---
That‚Äôs depending on the level you build the armour or weapon at, you can choose the level while crafting it
---
Please no, at least not until they put in a toggle to opt out of these notifications. They already went overboard with them.
---
K thanks

Just wanna say thanks again, insight is better, and it's a up to date answer
---
He is.
---
I might have to just camp out there. I was there just when it started and it kept spawning legendary bots. I did forgot about the explosion on the first one tho haha.
---
There is no test server, that's why you see "lack of entitlements" when they patch, they use the live servers to test.
---
You generally can only craft items up to your current level, these usually tier up every 10 levels or so. Some weapons have a min level before it can be crafted at all.
---
Just me paint FUCKING EVERYTHING in vault tec colors and I'll be ecstatic. I want blue and yellows guns for days.

---
I'm definitely spamming this on these posts now.
---
I would not mind the Wood Armor so much if it actually was 3\* with some decent perks, but in my case, I have purchased 10 pieces of 3\* armor from the Purveyor, and 5 of them were Wood armor pieces that reverted to 1\*.
---
I also found out last night, that even if you try to scrap them in the Legendary Muncher, immediately after getting them,  you only get 3 Scrip for the 3\* Wood Armor pieces, so the Muncher is in on the conspiracy as well.
---
I'm done buying Armor from the Purveyor until something changes, at least give me a tinfoil outfit &amp; hat with the Wood Armor.
---
when its working it is great for hard to hit enemies like those they fly or are really small, so you can accurately target them.  I dont use VATS 100%, but when i need it its nice to know its there.
---
My snipers normally do about 110....
---
Verify you do not have a disease that affects ranged weapons (there are a few) and you have not swapped out perks that affect rifles.
---
They could make something for consoles with a limited choice of words and phrases.

I got an unyielding AP refresh wood piece that disappeared on me:(
---
The favorite wheel is for my armor switches and chems
---
Why are you so mean about it? Do you really think that only kids or idiots don't know how the event works, yet?
---
Yes yes yes yes yes!!!!
---
I got mine with the pirate hat and the silver shroud coat.  I look like I belong in Bloodborne
---
You should only be able to craft weapons and armour up to your current level, ie at level 20 you won‚Äôt be able to craft a .50 machine gun because of its minimum level even if you have the plans and materials for it. Hope this helps.
---
Sorry, they removed access to the game for anyone named eddie in the last patch. It was a specific instruction from Todd. You should really read the last "Inside the vault".
---
I don't think this will come under a Bethesda Plz category.
---
Chest piece is most important as that is going to take most of your damage. Limbs maybe take 25% of the hits, so perk preference outweighs damage resistance for limbs.
---
Yes just completely ignore everything I said because I hurt your feelings. Oh and then take a personal jab at me that really shows your shining intelligence.
---
Big pile of pre war money please
---
Exactly! I think that would be a great idea. It would also be cool if it gave you the option to automatically fast-travel to the event once it started.
---
Yeah, your bench should have a screwdriver instead of just pounding the weapon till it breaks down
---
Thought that favoured or starred item,gave prompt "are you sure ?" . Mine does on ps4.
---
talking of which, You think a keyboard gives problems, try  on a ps4 controller.That can drive you spare.
---
Your going to want the rifleman perks in perception to up damage, as well as maybe bloody mess or tormentor in the luck state. Happy hunting
---
I legit saw someone selling a fusion core with 25% left for 400 caps AND a plasma core for 500! Are these people high?
---
Well, that's pretty interesting.
---
Thank you for the input I will definitely look into it.
---
Please no, this event fires off every half hour. Serverwide events are already overused and intrusive. This would be fine if they allowed some way to toggle out of all of these but they do not at current.
---
That sucks ps4 for me
---
Explosive weapons cannot harm your animal friends.  Without pacifist enabled I cannot harm any of the friendly creatures during or after the event.
---
Oldest trick in the book.
---
&gt; faster then a dress on prom night
---
Damn son.
---
Have you tried charging it up to 99? Hold down the fire key. Slower but more certainly damage. If you have a few perception points get one point in each if the rifleman cards for +30% damage.
---
It's definitely been a problem for several patches now. I don't even headshot anymore, switching VATS  limb targets seem to correct it, so I just aim for arms/legs instead.
---
Scrub
---
Honestly, if people can't figure out what 'activate the pylons', or 'defend the Brahmin' means, I don't think there's much hope for anything more complicated than that.
---
I don't know if it's intentional, but I'd like to think that someone there is looking at what the player base is actually capable of, and saying 'if the players have to think about it, it will never get killed, so stick to the easy plan'.
---
I was only speaking to the three star for three star enemy. Not the random quality of the drops.
---
The worst thing is that they are almost guaranteed sources of disease, because they'll nip you no matter where you are, even if they don't appear to physically touch you.
---
You ok? Need a hug?
---
I play on ps4. I just wish I could swap the favorite Wheel and emote wheel.  The favorites is up on the dpad and emotes are down.  
---
When using the left joystick to run, it would be much easier to press down on the dpad to drink/eat/swap weapons.  How it is now,  I usually have to stop,  use what I want,  then continue.  It's jarring.
---
I want fuud for my tum tum too
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad. It got me and my teammate twice.
---
I find that any ballistic gun loves to have anti armor perks on it. Both the legendary effect and tank killer since I'm reading that it's considered a rifle by game standards. After that, you can try looking at going more stealth since it works at long range and try to maximize your sneak attack damage you get from it and the stealth of your build so that you remain hidden longer.
---
Well, it should.  haha
---
actually i'm a fan of wooden armor...  
---
I'm kinda happy that now it comes 3\*...!
---
Don‚Äôt worry Bugthesda will fix this glitch eventually.  I mean, it‚Äôs only been happening for months now.  
---
The good news is they have repair kits and other more ‚Äúimportant‚Äù things to implement instead
---
I lost mine too and it doesn‚Äôt seem like you can trade for it either. :(
---
That fucking noise haunts my dreams.
---
I make a living by selling salt at a very reasonable price of 24999 caps.
---
Use Molotov‚Äôs or Tesla rifles, helps to get a hit on whatever you want a hit on. I personally use a vampires Tesla when going into events liked nuked whitespring or Encrypted (you‚Äôd be surprised how much junk you can get from those robots), or crowded areas where I don‚Äôt have time to pick a legendary out of the crowd. Just be sure to give a good amount of hits, or it might not register for bigger mobs.
---
You‚Äôre joking but I would really like this. What a confusing layout!! Super cool though!
---
Noice! When you test it with your PS4, tell us the results :)

This all day long

Checking a users post history is part of reddit. There is no rule against it. Many users delete tgier post history religiously. There is also nothing wrong with speculating about a user through thier history.
---
I keep my history in all it's awful and often cringeworthy glory for all to see. I have nothing to hide.
---
If they're end game opponents then they should drop end game loot. I don't think anyone is complaining about them being too difficult to kill, it's the fact that it's not worth it because they drop crap loot.
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is that you fell for their trap?
---
That's really well done
---
Same here. Sorry but my aesthetic is built around Scout Armour and Wood Armour. I want to be able to aim to a full set of 3* of those pieces.     
---
Id rather they fix the problem, rather punish people who don't want conform to the marine/combat armour play-style.
---
Is sell all ammo type for 1c and Fusion Cores for 15c each and nobody buys anything :(
---
I'm always on the hunt for plans I don't know, Apparel for my collection. I love farming the new events like Campfire Tales and the new Project Paradise (when I'm not getting disconnected.) But really you have to do things that you enjoy - no one can really tell you what that is. I like collecting and selling plans and clothes. My friend runs a bar - that's really all he does most of the time. Another friend spends all their time in the munitions factory / fighting the queen. End game is different for everyone because we all like different things.
---
I've had the sams problem for a handful of animals (but not all) including Brahmin and Yao Gai.
---
Sometimes charging assaultrons will one shot friendlies the moment they spawn out of nowhere
---
Only thing that gets my blood going for sure nowadays is hopping on the PvP servers and doing my best to hide and shoot a few peeps. Its the most panicking thing ever to go from "hidden" to "detected" while in chameleon armor because you know someone is popping berry mentats and its time to run for your life
---
That is exactly what they're saying.
---
yea, couple weeks ago.  Ran the building solo, level 1 eyebots, mostly, dropping level 1 legendaries.   I gathered them all up and left them all in a bag at the foot of the stairs.
---
Things like going from one end of Whitesprings to the other never leaving stealth. 
---
Clearing areas with teammates
---
Events again with a team
---
Farming flux 
---
Launching nukes
---
Skipping about the Cranberry Bog looking for Scorched Beasts.

Drinking Nukashine and walking back.

Acid runs, ore runs, plastic runs

Aim at the ground below their feet for more consistent damage unless they have a larger hutbox like the deathclaw.
---
I always drop a Bobby pin an tell the player to wait until I say I'm done. I step back an see bag an then go an add stuff. I also try an drop on a solid surface and not something made by someone in a C.A.M.P area.
---
Ah, no, not fusion cores.  These are ignition cores, cores unique to this event.  They only take lead, nuclear material and aluminum (I think) to make.  All of the mats you need are indeed provided in the event.
---
That was my MO always in the past. But over the last few months it has worked so well I just... relaxed. I feel stupid, I was always so careful in the old days.
---
Preserved Pie at 25k is a meme at this point and you're taking it seriously lol
---
Someone on Market76 offered 2k for my 1Star Bloodied handmade so people will buy things at the price they want. If you don't like the prices then don't buy? Like just hop to another camp and find it cheaper. It's really not hard. People who are overcharging will either figure it out and lower their prices - or people will buy and they won't /shrug
---
This has been one of my thoughts for several months now. I like doing things like one violent night, uranium event, and monster mash, but I have to check my map frequently in hopes that I don't miss the events if they become active. Seriously hope they implement this. Thank you for posting this!
---
üòÇ üòÇ  Dude, that seriously doesn‚Äôt even make sense. FYI...I‚Äôm a blast because I don‚Äôt take this stuff seriously üòâ  Life is so much more than an upvote/downvote on Reddit or hurting someone‚Äôs feelings over something so inconsequential.
---
The spontaneous dying of enemies is a game feature at this point. 7 months is enough time for a bug to be recognized and fixed.
---
&gt;Yes there were issues where Hardened and Glowing masses were in junk. The wonderful fix was to move them to "Aid" that worked 
---
I think nothing was chanced. I can't remember because of the similarity of names, but either of these should still be junk. If they both were originally in junk, like really early, it's possible as it took, I don't know, few weeks at least, for me to get into nuke experiences. But as far as I've ever got any of them, one of the above have been aid item.
---
To make flux you need 3 parts and the raw flux. High radiation fluids and one of the above is in aid, but one of them is junk. It's just protected at least againts scrap all, just like been bottles, but it can be manually scrapped and I think it might also be scrapped for ultracite, if you have no other ultracite. Of the last part Im not 100% sure.
---
On death you drop all that is junk.
---
Can you imagine 8 of us working together taking down the SBQ reviving each other with beer and actually communicating
---
lol thanks! I'm a glass cannon! Giving me a helping hand helps you too! Especially if I have revenant on!!!
---
I've got an 3* with assassin's, explosive and 90% reduced weight. Its awesome and the ammo is very cheap.
---
PS4...I have seen 3 nukes since Saturday afternoon.
---
Elder Scrolls Online has it, and it works just fine.  It‚Äôs slow, but you can just get a wireless keyboard and it works without interference.
---
I definitely need this. I might need to crack open the archives if I can't find it.
---
This has been an issue from the very beginning of the game, and Bethesda has never really addressed it, so at this point it's safe to say they are either unable or unwilling to fix it.
---
On the Bright side, WWR Armor affect the total weight including mods, and also affects RW weapons, so my Instigating, SS, RW Super Sledge only weighs .07 lbs, and a few of my weapons display 0 weight when using 5 pieces of 20% Weapons Weight Reduction Armor.
---
Note: even with 5 pieces of 20% WWR, you only get a 90% reduction, this is also true with the Ammo, &amp; FD&amp;C reduction armor as well.
---
that's the idea
---
That‚Äòs sad... maybe i should report it as a bug.
---
I am in the 150's and I just switched to a bloodied build its fun but if  you are not careful you do die easy.
---
Yeaaah and all my possum challenges are either weapon mods description or nuclear winter spoiler &gt;_&lt;
---
Settle down there Daniel Bryan
---
Gotta be honest, it did the complete opposite for me.  I think Project Paradise is a sloppy, poorly designed quest and a really disappointing way to end Wild Appalachia.
---
If it were one or two animals?  Maybe.  If they were in the same large room?  Maybe.  But the way it is now, there's just too much to deal with unless a good portion of the server is behind you and everyone is coordinated, but if people show up to this event and their first impression is failing over and over again, that's not going to happen.
---
That's some really light barrel !
---
If you're just out for scrap, you're right, there are better ways to get it.  But it's a fun event, neat workshop, enough scrap to make the event cores and pay back built defenses, and it takes very little to maintain.  We had fun just participating in the defense for extra loot and charging back-and-forth across the structure was a cool experience.
---
I always contract parasites. This disease hates me. My camp is in a location south of Harper's Ferry and I always login standing in the middle of pond... Parasites immediately, most of the time lol.
---
Thank you all for your advice. Looks like I'll need to juggle my SPECIALs a bit more and get perception up to add those cards to my loadout. Going to have to make some hard choices.
---
WILL NOBODY BUY MY 20000 DRILL?!?!??!
---
yeah its been a long time people have been asking for this
---
I‚Äôve found a couple near the bottom of the savage divide.
---
The Steam EULA (I couldn't find the console versions) clearly states you cannot sell items for cash value. It also states all content created in the game belongs to the Licensor (Bethesda not you) so technically every legendary we've ever rolled belongs to Bethesda which is as you say interesting. 
---
The implications of the EULA basically mean you can't sell for RMT because Beth owns your stuff. They own it and can do as they please. Which is why RMT is so dangerous if too many OP items pop up for trade could they remove every copy of said item? It's unlikely but completely within thier power and rights as the Licensor to do so.
---
I'd have responded sooner but this post got out of control on me. It's actually been a great learning experience and quite fun. I've never had a post this popular before.
---
*Can you say "Toxic Sludge?" I knew you could!*
---
I did it last night and it worked liked normal for supervisors.  I did find there were only a handful of normal miners popped up the whole time.  I spent a lot of time just waiting around.  It's hard to tell anymore what things are bugs and what are just bad RNG.
---
I suggested something similar a month or so back and one of the developers commented saying that they really liked the idea so hopefully it‚Äôs been passed on because it really would be helpful
---
I made some screenshots from the german translation/version of this bug if interested 
---
it's kinda hilarous if your event objective is "stabilized long barrel"
---
[https://imgur.com/a/QKHeIqE](https://imgur.com/a/QKHeIqE)
---
Yup, this game needs more useless crap. Bug fixing and gameplay doesn‚Äôt matter at all...
---
Nope not fixed lol.
---
Also additional proof with reddit thread from yesterday asking Fallout 4 players if it was fixed, didn't check myself since download too long and fell asleep. And just a heads up Fallout 4 gets an update every few months but for creation club additions and nothing more and this update breaks mods constantly lol.

I would suggest hopping down there while the event isn't going to familiarize yourself with the layout - it's not too bad once you've been down there a couple times except the room behind the keypad fucks me up everytime and I get lost lol
---
Do we know that the game's units of distance are meters?
---
Nah, you're being downvoted for being toxic.
---
Have you completed the event?
---
I feel like this is exactly why they put the challenge in the game.
---
I felt like an idiot but it also gave me a good laugh
---
http://imgur.com/a/j3nIO0R haha check this out from yesterday! He just stood there frozen for me to do this!
---
Burrowing enemies are especially annoying when you‚Äôre at a workshop and they‚Äôre the thing attacking it. I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve had a workshop, it gets attacked, and one mole rat somehow ends up outside the build zone, stuck in the ground so you can‚Äôt finish the defense quest, making you have to leave, let the quest go to ‚ÄúRetake‚Äù and hope it doesn‚Äôt happen again. 
---
Grafton Steel is especially annoying because they like to get under the floor of the building that‚Äôs right outside the build zone and just stay there forever.
---
You won't be able to craft some weapons until you are high enough level
---
Good call. Completed the event last night and ran around for a while and finally just got disoriented and traveled out. Didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to play but I will for sure do that next time.
---
Maybe they died because you were too busy worrying about what other players were doing and not protecting them.
---
That guy was literally just saying they are too difficult to kill lol
---
Would you say the same for rad resist? 
---
If I have a limb piece the has 25 rad resist and another that has 0 but has some perks (legendary), you would prefer the perks since the 25% of hits are located on the limb?
---
Thanks for the insight!
---
Jesus christ now i'm worried some bugs will never be fixed
---
I mean, I‚Äôm not trying to clown the guy. I fell for it too the first time. Low lvl had a crit ready in the bank. I hit him once with All Rise then he floored me with a combat knife and broke my armor in one shot.
---
Now to play the devils advocate here, without simply saying its a multiplayer game hur dur, there are a lot of things in real life that also require other people to participate in, and the focus of the game is working together, it wouldnt really make sense to have only solo challenges in the game or it would defeat the whole "fallout with friends" vibe the game is trying to be
---
Features
---
case study with non legndry damage effects.9 in rifles and tank. target - s/beast l55.
---
low level gauss dmg 200 -worse than slap damage.
---
high level  dmg 224 - again, worse than slap damage
---
 buy plans craft/scrap till penetrating capacitors turn up.
---
h/level 224   13% (give or take).    huge difference. this took a lot of time and recources.
---
same goes for all ranged weapons  inc. shotguns. ALL armour peircing and hardened.
---
and still 2/3 shots against l68's enemys.
---
Ive only seen 2, and both were L50.
---
The one I had to take out @ bog town, and the 2nd last night - L50 snoozing in one of the ponds just above WS.  (Looked like a green boulder in the  middle of the pond.)
---
Wasn't aggro'ed, I had something else I wanted to accomplish, so I left that one alone.

Well, it is *now*.  After 500 hours.

My buddy has one these. Super rare, you'd probably have to trade something nice instead of caps for one of these. 
---
Here's proof, he's on the far left, oddly playing a tuba somehow http://imgur.com/a/8lGFrWh
---
Fav place for plastic? High School?
---
How in the hell do you collect 15k in goods a day legitimately. smells like bs. day after day after day? naaaaa.
---
Overboard? There are two server wide messages for the whole game. You see these, at most, once every four hours on average but probably even less than that.
---
Or we could have a bot that automatically replies "No fucking way" to all of them.
---
There should be a default set of "scrap/don't scrap" items, then we should be able to designate what we want or don't want to auto-scrap.  Like, I have enough sheepsquatch horns, I'm never going to use the deathclaw for anything other than scrap, but I'd like to hold on to all the tick parts etc.
---
HOLY sh\*t....I don't know about other translations but.....in the german translation it's more than some info....the whole possum challenges are just gibberish snippets of nuclear winter content...like some challenges are still ok but most of them are only some random objectives of the nuclear winter questline...how would anyone be able to complete any of them now? Wow Bethesda xD
---
I was in a blast zone and got glowing pustules from a ghoul on the balcony above me. It sucks but I reckon getting that disease is just par for the course when you're in a white springs nuke zone.
---
Stay away from quests till lvl 50. That way all quest rewards are max lvl. Just grind out the forest.
---
In Berkeley springs there is a handmade spawn on top of the roof of the salon. I also picked up the plans from the vendor bot in harpers ferry at around level 16 beforehand
---
Read all the perks, focus on stat buffing and dmg/dmg resist perks
---
Buy the handmade plan from the vendorbot at Harpers Ferry or Watoga. Make, scrap, repeat.
---
Location matters! It seems the further you are from Whitesprings, the lower your prices have to be to have a hope if making a sale. I was way down in cranberry bog and couldn't shift decent *2 weapons for 4-500 caps. Moved my camp with a couple if caps of whitesprings and everything sold so fast I felt like I'd been shoplifted. People are not willing to pay a few caps to travel but they will pay hundreds for weapons and armor?! Or maybe only super high level guys looking for god roll weapons are willing to travel...
---
I just want level 50+ servers where it's feasible for my endgame characters to farm gear all over the map instead of being confined to the eastern half.
---
Why is no one complaining about this? It feels like everyone just accepted it and doesn't even care anymore.
---
And rolling pins, ffs.  3 star freakin' rolling pin...twice
---
There is a spawn inside the burrows to. Behind the locked Gate. Also certzin that i have seen some modplans for sale at vendors
---
So low level rads are so common that you're bound to just stay slightly irradiated at all times and if they have mandatory minimum radiation levels then no matter how high your resist is, it does the same (collecting water or eating for instance) then in high rad areas like a nuke zone, your +5 on radiation resist won't really do anything to stop the flood of rads so it's essentially a wasted stat imo.
---
Some radshield or glowing blood packs will be a better option unless you get pharmacist and slot it for radx/radaway (which is pretty easy to make and with super duper and chemist can become easy source of money diluting and batching)
---
Still don't give a shit about your feelings on the matter or anyone's fake internet points.  Feel free to fail Campfire tales as often as you like as you wait for people to get a 1 star wood armor piece.  I'm going to complete it.
---
Only if he actually want to sell them.
---
this part was easy for me, but i have constructed two lights in my camp and not been credited for that part?
---
Why are you worried about other people's prices?  I like when I see shit priced way higher than mine.
---
Me?  On PC.  Crafted a bunch of the Stimpack Diffusers and tossed them on my vending machines.  Kept having to craft more to sell as they kept selling out.
---
One violent night always notifies players.  It's when the sons of Dane radio broadcast comes up....
---
Take note that currently weapon-type damage perks, like Rifleman or Heavy Gunner, do not increase the damage of this weapon. Bloody Mess does work, so it's a nice weapon for a melee specialist, or a shotgunner who wants some range.
---
I was referring to the plan , I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs extremely rare as I‚Äôve not seen a duplicate in known plans since, I have seen posts saying it is also in Grafton station sometimes
---
Well, I can't see myself coming back to it anytime soon.  And the thing is, because it relies so much on being super coordinated with other players in order to succeed, it ends up being a cascading problem.  The fewer that show up, the harder it gets, which means even fewer show up, which means - you get the idea.
---
Okay, thanks for the tip!
---
I followed a guy from before vendors to now. He was selling one of the white powder jumpsuits for 18k. Now? 3k. Still doesn't sell.
---
Kinda related, I like to throw joke items in my vendor for exorbitant prices. I'm selling a note titled "DON'T TOUCH" for 10k.
---
Blueish grey baseball style hat with the 76 "gear" logo. It was an Atom store purchase. May be retired now though.
---
But have you ever heard the tale of Johnny guitar?.  I feel every fallout game hits this issue eventually with their radio stations.
---
I've made 30k in a day without a single thing priced over 1k. Some days I can't even put stuff up to sale until I go on a buying spree.
---
Where is the location that most overlooks the whole?
---
I had someone try this, but I knew what they were up to. I killed then all multiple times until they begged me to stop.
---
Question, what's the point/value of shutting down the ARIC computer during the test?  If the friendly animals become hostile to you, seems more likely they'd die in the ensuing battles.  Why would anyone do that then?
---
I got the Breaking Bad call back. I woke up in a dug out with a bunch of plastic barrels and a skeleton in a labcoat beside me, then a truck with more barrels in it. It was hilarious. I love these wake up locations.
---
Now I want giant mutated snapping turtles.

I have had the drives for about a month now and I can definately say they make a big improvement in loading times but you do need to stay put for a while still and wait for the monsters to populate. If I go into the WS gold clubhouse I will get attacked by numerous invisible monsters unless I wait about 20-30 seconds for the server to say there are monsters here. Inside buildings its a ton better. I get in and can go right away. I think its just the outside that still sometimes need a little time but its about 30-40% faster overall now.
---
Jump out of build mode and back in. Solves that problem for me
---
My intention was to reference it! I'm so glad you got it!
---
If you stay in the main room for a minute you can get your bearings on which the direction the 3 habitats are. And ye it does get disorienting - I don't think I'm claustrophobic but every time I'm in a basement-type place in fallout games I get turned around and panic lol
---
This would be a HUGE quality of life improvement. I'm picturing hovering over an event on your map and getting a small info card on it showing the time remaining (if applicable), recommended level, number of players, etc and having an option to subscribe to the event (with a button-press, like you would for fast travelling).
---
Maybe make a perk for it, or give Scrapper a second star level?  The flavor is that we're just breaking this stuff apart, and the Scrapper perk represents us doing it more effectively, with less waste.  
---
Make it "Scrapper 2," which would let us disassemble devices instead of just breaking them apart.
---
They can‚Äôt anymore.  
---
If I remember right, Then PvP is only allowed within the confines of the workshop area (build region).  They changed this in the last update (not the current one but the one before).  
---
So as long as you are just outside that zone you are free from PvP.
---
I will help you, for free. ign - dignite
---
This comes off as a ‚Äòthe answer is no, please stop giving clarity to a disaster because we want to treat this like a genocide that it is‚Äô.
---
Chameleon mutation only works when standing with your weapon out. The second of invisibility when your crouch is from Escape Artist.
---
Better than bone~~r~~ worms
---
What exactly is the value of shutting it down?  The friendly animals attack you too?  Or just the mobs that spawn to try to kill it?  If it's passive I'm wondering if it's more likely to avoid the mobs so maybe that increases it's chance of survival by staying out of a fight.  I'd be worried if it's aggressive it might take on the Alpha mob and get one shot killed.
---
Well...the list is endless...
---
1.  Start a a serious trader/vending camp.  If you need a start buy a Serum Recipe for 3k and start selling serums at 200-250 caps each ( Xbox prices) and you'll make a killing.  This will however require you to play the game and grind for flux and junk to make said serums.
---
2. Start a pure Survival character.   You gain XP much faster in Survival and granted it's not perfect by any means it does add some excitement to the game knowing you are gonna die by the hands of somebody 200 levels higher than you.
---
3. Start new characters to with different builds, I currently have 4 different builds, bloodied rifle build (lvl 216 Pure survival) Heavy weapons build (lvl 237 Pure Adventure) Lvl 2 Trade/ Vendor character and a lvl 99 PA Melee build that plays both Adventure and Survival.
---
4. Also my guess is you may have done what i did in the beginning and just rushed through everything trying to get the next level and quest done.  I skilled all those terminal TLDR and loor hollow tapes, go back and actually try to learn the stories of each event, it's very interesting if you take the time to listen.
---
I use a suppressed instigating version. Max rifleman X3, Tank killer max,  max bloody mess and maxed covert op.  Works really well for my preferred play style, (I swap out to heavy weapons/pa for nuke zones etc), obviously it‚Äôs down to personal preference though.
---
3* now usually won‚Äôt give a special point perk so it‚Äôs pretty worth it
---
To avoid it just AIM at him and see if theres a option to invite for team, if the option dont show he is already on a team and probably just baiting you for his friends...
---
So we are forced to be forever stuck with spam? We come to sub to discuss the game, not answer the same shitpost 200 times a day.
---
And it‚Äôs not like a window pops up and makes you click ‚Äúokay‚Äù, it‚Äôs just a little pop up in the corner of the screen.
---
It's not a smooth on a PS4.  You have to sit through the blue screen transition before you get to the dashboard.
---
To argue against the grain for a moment, I feel like there is really two schools of thought on this. For one, people who like FO76 will obviously say that the game is worth playing, but on the other side, someone who loved the exploration and worldbuilding of previous fallout games will look for something in FO76 thats different from what someone who loves the gunplay and PvE aspect. I think these "is it worth it" posts should stay to talk to potential players about what they want and dont want.
---
in my opinion:
---
figure out what end-game items youll enjoy using the most and base your build around that playstyle early. I recommend looking at the 1st effects for armor and which weapon perks seem most useful and you like using the most. 
---
a quick rundown: 
---
bloodied/unyielding is best for damage but kind of glass cannon. 
---
crit spam auto weapons are best for pvp and burst damage. 
---
strength stacking for melee damage is still a thing, made even better with unyielding. 
---
top-tier effects are things like bloodied for low hp, vampire for fast/shotgun weps, anti-armor for extra damage at high health and two-shot if you plan on using explosive in a high health build. 
---
heavy weapons do the most dps, rifles have the best perks (anti-armor, staggering, crippling) and pistols are weak but are usable with vats crit spam. 
---
honestly, anything is viable with a coherent build, especially heavy weapons and rifles, pistols less so. just make sure you have a plan, i recommend using nukes&amp;dragons build planner. 
---
some side tips: pick up every armor and weapon you see to scrap it, and dont waste caps on in game vendors (cheaper from other players almost always)
---
yes and the cat lady house
---
Scrapper does not appear to give back much "useful" extras.. I just get back lots of wood.. or other un-interesting resources
---
I know for certain I didn't. The last thing I did before logging for the night was repairing all my armor and weapons. I still had 10+ armor pieces on me for the scrip machine. I noticed my chest piece missing when I went to recycle the others
---
I mean...they fixed it....by changing the website to 10% too....
---
Thanks for such quick reply, is there a way to be invisible with armor ?
---
Right, I revived someone at a SBQ event
---
That is the type of min/maxing tip for a second character.  Enjoy the quests the first time through.  Grinding shit in the forest will kill a new person's joy of the game within an hour or two.
---
That... would explain the itching.
---
But I thought I was suffering from the blight.....?
---
We need other than a hammer to scrap with!
---
Yeah I laugh bout it now, but remember how salty I was at the time. Most importantly, I learned PVP was not to be taken casually in this game.
---
Just tried it and still same result but thanks for your suggestion anywayüëçüèΩ
---
When choosing your perk cards - you don't want to rank up cards like Slugger or Gladiator - instead you want a level one card of each tier 1-2-3 as this does more damage opposed to leveling 1 card up completely. Perks like Starched Genes level 2 (to let you keep mutations) and Super Duper (duplicates most things you can make) make the game alot easier and I definitely recommend getting them as early on as you can. 
---
Try not to worry about buying camp plans etc early on as you will earn them from completing quests / taking and defending workshops. You should also check the suitcases / containers at train stations and the overseer's camp as often high level players will drop extra plans, loot, ammo and aid in there for passing low levels! 
---
Try to pick up food that doesn't spoil such as canned dog food, fancy lad snack cakes etc as it's easier to keep yourself fed due to food spoiling times. 
---
If you find yourself stuck you can often find a quick answer here for some help!
---
Instigating, +Vats Crit, -Vats Cost Dragon. Very satisfying hunting bounties and punching (figuratively) way above my weight in the Wasteland.
---
Not keen on wasting an extra perk point.
---
Would be alot easier for them just to give as a few screws back when we scrap weapons mate
---
It's designed to not be a solo event.  Sorry, there's plenty enough stuff that's for solo player, this needs multiple people to complete.
---
Definitely shouldn‚Äôt have seen L62 near Morgantown. That‚Äôs crazy. That‚Äôs part of the forest; should cap at like L6 (unless someone nukes it). Savage divide is the start of areas that can go up to max level, so thats not unusual if a high level is/just was in the area. It goes Forest(L1-9)-&gt; toxic valley(L5-20)-&gt; ash heap(L10-40)-&gt; savage divide(L20-max-&gt; mire (L25-max)-&gt; cranberry bog(L30-max).
---
Those are approximate minimum-maximum level ranges based on my experience.
---
TIL
---
Sounds like you need a hug. Too bad that sounds contagious.
---
I would prefer a mod that simply answered "yes" to every one of them, and then locked the post.
---
Perk loadout was one I was hoping was there. That's gonna be great to have.
---
You are suffering from Rad Worms.....No! I'm **living** with Rad Worms.. Don't define me by the disease.
---
well.. I got to admit that I like the  ballistic fiber being a grind.. makes my 200  ballistic fiber feel like an accomplishment. Now if the armor worn down any faster I'd change my mind REALLY fast!
---
Dude , preach, I will never understand asking people if it's ok to play now, how about just try it ya know? Worst cascenario you just put it back down , best cascenario you don't, it's as simple as that
---
Looks like I'm gonna be spending today working out how to get these downloaded and working.
---
But then you can't be a creepy ghost witch
---
Yeah im definitely going to try it myself because i didnt even know this was a thing
---
Lmao buddy here's something with pictures for you, you simpleton.

This is like trying to teach a moron how to swim in a bath tub... No matter how shallow the water is you'll still find some way to drown
---
If your still not stratified build one of the deathclaw statue,build the stuffed animals,build the hedge pets cat and deathclaw... O WAIT THEY DON'T MOVE ENOUGH RIGHT Lmfao 
---
Your not making and valid points and your agreement is crap. Your complaining wanting a non moving pet. Now buddy in the event your comparing to...they move *jaw drops* crazy right and get this they attack other animals and can died *GASP*
---
Also it's not considered a suggestion if it already is available what your doing is complaining.
---
"O i can't get one i wish i had some easier way to get a pet" 
---
YA YOU SIR ARE AN IDIOT SIR
---
Waiting to see how great of a rebuttal you have for this next comment...
---
I run into this problem when I am inside someone else's camp, or when I first log in. It usually helps to run outside their camp before attempting to fast travel, but this won't help you if your are stuck in their foundation.
---
This is truly beautifully done, both the environment and the game strategy. A big THANK YOU to Bethesda!!! 
---
The other two boss events are also very enjoyable. If only they could improve the rewards and make sure the bosses always drop three star items, people will be playing all three non stop.
---
what he says.
---
Do events.
---
You can also go to the toxic valley and ash heap region; they are not that difficult.
---
Hoard plastic, screws, springs, ballistic fiber.
---
Sell/Exchange all legendary that you don't use for Scrips at railroad stations and gamble for other legendary at the new legendary vendor.
---
To sell?  3*.   To use?   2*.
---
I'm able to solo 3 pylons (if I absolutely have to), with 100% health, T-60, and an auto 1* Vamp handmade. If I can get someone else to take 1 pylon, the vamp actually does a pretty good job of counteracting dmg from just 2 pylons. Then I make it a priority to keep the other pylon holder revived.
---
Let everyone else pound on the squatch.
---
I normally run a low health build, but I haven't failed an encryptid event since I started doing this. If I have to hold all 3 pylons, I just avoid the squatch and spam stimpacks
---
It's a weird layout, to be sure, but it all joins around a central junction.
---
The problem is really one of imperfect information.  You can't see beyond the chamber you're in, so when things go wrong, you don't always know the best way to react.  They clearly want players to shout back and forth, but eh.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
With a full set of weightless armor.
---
More like "Classic open world survival/building game"...
---
Sorry, what do you mean by that? you mean like enemies? 
---
And do you know if your perks determine what type of weapon youll get in any way?
---
Why does this read like a missed connection from Craigslist?
---
Go look at other games that have private servers, and compare the costs.
---
Keep in mind, some games require a bit more...oomph from the servers to run.  You can get a Minecraft server for $15 per month, which supports more people, but doesn't require a particularly beefy server.  Getting a 76 server would probably cost more than that (YMMV).
---
It's not a FO76 problem, the came is what it is.  Servers cost money to build, money to maintain and power, and money to have beefy internet connections.  None of that comes free, and the server supplier needs to make a profit on top of their costs.
---
(Bethesda doesn't make or supply the servers, they're all 3rd party like Amazon, because it's actually cheaper t have a 3rd party provide them compared to running their own network of servers across the globe).
---
In all honesty, I appreciate the tip of putting more food into the trough. I was unaware more food resulted in stronger friends.
---
Thanks. I have then plans just seeing if there was another way
---
It feels like going to war for your country and bringing back a foam cup for souvenir.
---
I do grab that once a day lol
---
Thanks guys
---
3x
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll pass this along.
---
Awe, but I promise to not pronounce it correctly!
---
A robot or super mutant dj would be the best.  Maybe making subtle comments about events or songs.
---
Very few times have I lost PVP unless the player was on a team. I still have to take the survival mode plunge
---
I'd love to hear more about this.. I have all 3 of those mutations.
---
3 I learned my lesson testing 2 yesterday üò¨

Really???  800 hours in and I'm just now learning this?  ::bangs head repeatedly against desk:: fml.  I love that event.

I have suggested this in every thread that brings up notifications (e.h. flares), so I'm glad the focus is finally shifting to the Opt In model.

If you've completed an event, it should add it to a list of events you can opt in to be notified of.

Can be done via pip boy or via a personal terminal.
---
Kind of hijacking your post for a related topic - how much would you guys pay for screws? Since we can't bulk them, the lowest you can sell them for is 1c each, but I haven't had any bites. Thinking back to when I was strapped for them, I'd have paid that for a giant pile of loose screws, it's not a steal but man it'd save an hour or two of farming for them. 
---
I have over 500 screws since I ran out once and have been collecting religiously ever since. It's the one thing I never don't pick up.
---
Passing this feedback along, thank you!
---
Nah i mean when you pick from the vendor, is it better to spend 100scrip on a 3* or 50scrip on a 2*
---
I havent got anything worth so far, alot of rocket launchers, which i just scrip again anyway, doesnt seem worth it going for the 3*
---
I dont care what you say, one day someone will buy my pie for 20k
---
This happens a lot at the WS station.  I always start emoting  the puking thing and run around in circles.  Then I just follow them around doing the thumbs down emote.  Usually they log out and block me after  a few minutes.
---
Remove wood armor from the legendary pool to begin with.
---
No, that's not everything. It's stuff like baseballs that turn into grenades, glass bottles that turn into molotovs.
---
Yeah, I had to get in the habit of going straight to the vendor after bulking what I wanted to sell. I've forgotten to only a handful of times, but it is an inconvenience.
---
Ehhh. I'd point to Conan Exiles (yes, it's a dumpster fire of a survival game.. but...) and their private servers... they suck balls. 
---
Now, they third party their private servers, so maybe that's the issue, but I and my buddies had nothing but trouble logging on, keeping them persistent, etc. Wasted money all around.
---
The recoil for full auto makes it useful for hip firing at close range, if you want to engage with it at medium or long range forget full auto.  True for a lot of weapons but especially this one.
---
Thanks for the vid! Short and sweet and straight to the point!
---
Yeah, from the small tests I did last night, the 10% seems to be accurate (30x1 cap, earned 27 caps after sale, etc) but I will check into a few others later on. I can absolutely put some video up, I think it might help some people in the community to get their heads on straight, lol.
---
No I tend to get random stuff but I did get one nice roll out of it and when I did armor I got a good piece. I‚Äôve gotten better stuff from the vendor then what I‚Äôve found playing since the game came out honestly
---
If you are going in while in power armor try going in without it. I crash every time in  power armor, but get it fine without it.
---
I have 100% WWR and even a bare assault rifle weights about 1.2lbs. When you inspect the rifle it shows all mods/specs as Standard or none. I think the problem is it calculates weight like it does with damage. Taking one effect to the initial number and reducing it by 20% then going with the new number and reducing it by 20% etc until all the WWR perks have adjusted the weight. So its never going to be 100% true weight reduction. 
---
Now add a mod to it and that mod doesnt seem to calculate out at all. Or even factor into the calculation. For example if a weapon weights 20lbs and has a 5lb mod it shows 25lbs carry. Say I use a 20% WWR armor I only see 4lb loss. which is 20% of 20lbs.
---
Whitesprings. 225 a run
---
Does rifleman perk work with Gauss?... isn't gauss classed as an energy weapon... albeit a rifle, but I thought rifleman was for ballistic non-auto rifles only?

I think someone who broke down the drops commented that it was a full 50% chance to get a 1\* off a 3\* enemy, and then it was kind of like 25% for a 2\* and 15% for a 3\*.  It was actually very low.
---
Now, part of that could very well be skewed by the same thing we see with Wood Armor and Murmrgh, where you get a drop that simply can't have 3\* to begin with.  Wood Armor is obnoxiously common in the first place, and it wouldn't surprise me if it pulls from the same defective list that Bethesda has refused to fix (the same one with the Drills and the Syringers).
---
It‚Äôs kind of a waste of time/caps when Vendors have terrible deals
---
I couldn‚Äôt do the event at all last night, crashed every time I went anywhere near it but this morning I did a hard reset before logging in and made sure I fast travelled direct to the event not the building or walking in from gauley mine like I tried last night and managed to join the event without any of last nights issues
---
I found some gems in the vending machines üî•üî•üî•
---
Does it have any attachments?
---
A clean modern suit or a clean civil war suit? Either would be cool.
---
I haven't bothered picking up this perk yet, how does it work?  Do you get additional components, akin to FO4?  Or do you just get more of the usual, ie Wood and Steel?
---
Np. It should make it helpful. But only testing would give a full answer.
---
Bug fixes and QoL
---
Please for the love of god Bethesda rework the perk system... its a mess, it's tedious, and soo soo many duplicate cards.
---
The new weapon
---
That doesn't do any good when the high level hits vats and instantly kills the mob when it spawns.
---
What I do is sell all my plans for anything between 10 to 50 caps. 
---
My weapons and armor are 100 or less for 1*. Around 200 for 2* and between 300 and 1000 for 3* depending if they com p for My suck or have at least one or two good rolls on them.
---
All my weapons and armor are based on trial and error for people logging in to salvage legendary items for scrip and that's what I sell them for quite frequently.
---
gimme that bloody two shot explosive faster swing speed anti armor drill rn
---
If you go when someone else hasn't cleaned up there are a few variations of clean asylum uniforms and stacks of different hats.
---
I should of added the part were our eyes met and my heart fluttered in that magical moment
---
Seeing how WR armor uses up the second legendary slot in all armor i find that a HUGE drawback if I were to run 5 of those pieces. To give up one armor piece with that weapons reduction would be good I guess but having to use up a second legendary slot seems just too much in my opinion. The 90% Reduced Weight is absolutely useless for anything other than melee. It‚Äôs a problem they definitely should fix.
---
I would have bought that lol
---
Looks like a scorched deathclaw. They spawn during the scorch queen fight.
---
I'd be more concerned about posting something if it was broken, but you might consider putting it up and linking to it every time someone complains about losing all the ammo for no caps...I've seen the complaint a lot.
---
Posting videos proving (or detailing) a bug, and getting that to Bethesda is a big help in getting things fixed.  But if there's nothing to fix...up to you if you want to try for a few free internet points ;-)
---
Yeah any useful skin would be nice. It is difficult enough to get atoms without using actual cash then they expect you to spend it on 8 different camera skins. I doubt anybody is that active with the camera anyway. We need skins for weapons people actually use....Hammers/Handmades/Shotties/More Rifle skins other than boring camo.
---
This is an amazing idea.
---
I spent so long trying to get him to spawn only to find out he didn't have the one I wanted on the days I tried.
---
Rule #1 Don‚Äôt take junks to events because you CAN die. Same with nuke zones, if you run a low health build an exploding car can send you to respawn.
---
Could just be luck but atm I'd take any lucküòÇ

The overseers cache is not a personal storage container. If you want to safely store your things, look for the blue containers that are called ‚Äúmy stash.‚Äù

Works every time.

Maybe if they put the Pioneer Scout Master down there, he could explain it to everybody.

The Athletics test was fun and real stupid to not let redo it for awards that were honestly trash like purified water and stimpacks.
---
**Exploit:** Addressed an exploit that could allow players to earn the rewards from the Athletics and Swimming Tests multiple times.
---
Other people have said traveling to Gauley Mine first and walking Arktos first has a higher chance of working. May have something to do with letting the area load fully before taking the elevator. I crashed twice fast traveling straight to Arktos but walking from the mine worked
---
dam man that sucks, did you notice if the weapon perks you got gave you major or minor perks??
---
I feel like if your most likely to get a major then its worth?
---
Clearly, the screws are made of steel.
---
Plz
---
Yep I‚Äôm tentatively waiting to see if all is still well tonight lol üòÇ
---
Can I make a suggestion on this? Can we have the option to select what events we‚Äôd like to get the notification for? Cause there are few I‚Äôm trying to grind for items such as the Rodger‚Äôs Reserve Beer etc but keep missing them :(
---
That's *freedom*, my friend.  The Second Amendment in action.  The right to Bear Arms.
---
"item needs support" dude  its just the next roof peice, it has all the support it needs. Building is for sure the most fucky thing about the game now, which is good.
---
Makes total sense for sure. But again my point being the 90% Reduced weight trait on any weapon other than melee is pretty useless unless you‚Äôre good with saving say 3lbs per ranged weapon.
---
I'll give it a go.
---
I was having this issue - this may not work for you but it's worked for a lot of people including myself. Try instead of fast traveling to Arktos itself or clicking "join event" - I have been fast traveling to Greg's mine supply and running up the hill and I have been able to enter the elevator and get into the event successfully. Not to say I haven't crashed from other things - like a random trying to trade with me sent me to dashboard while I was down there. But I hope this works for you and others. Good luck. Hope they hot fix it soon.
---
I don't remember it was such crap they were all immediately scrapped lol
---
He's a pain to find. If he isn't there, run up to the bridge, turn around and head back a few times. I got him a few times but he never had what I wanted.
---
I charge 25 caps for 120% and 20 caps for 100%. These things are heavy, I don't need them, so they're priced to move.
---
1 cap per 1%. You can go a bit lower I'd you want to sell more.
---
And this is why I love the Fallout community.
---
I woke up to what appeared to be a tea party, akin to Alice in Wonderland, but more likely a reference to Sheogorath.   Good stuff.
---
tbh I don‚Äôt have any issues with gathering most of the resources. I even have some spare I regularly give away  in my magnificent giveaway vending machine. The funny thing - I‚Äôve started to run out of steel recently.
---
Yeah, this sound right. That's bad.
---
Same experience here.  There are times it goes really quick, and other times I can go get coffee while I wait.
---
I don't know if it has to do with the server itself, or if it's related to the location of the server you connect to being more distant.  I'd assume the former, but I haven't done any testing to see where the servers are that I'm connected to.
---
Good advice, once I set my SPECIAL stats, am I able to increase them over time, or are they set in stone?
---
Preach!
---
Hmm lucky, i was running a heavy gunner build on 1 acc, and thats the one that i mainly get the launchers on, could this possibly be the reason or maybe just coincidence?
---
Buyers choice. I've seen good points made for 2 and 3‚òÜ purchases on here
---
Thanks pal. I'm trying everything everyone is suggesting atm so I'll do yours.
---
It does work with rifleman. It‚Äôs the exception.
---
Did the ammo issue with vending get fixed yet?  I price ammo at 2 caps because if I price it at 1 cap I dont get anything.  It has something to do with the 10 percent tax on sales I think.  It would be nice if we could bulk ammo so that we could set the per round price at some fractional value.  The only reason I have ammo in my vending machine is just in case someone really wants it.
---
I personally love it for farming. I can carry so many sellable weapons for vendoring and I make very few trips back to camp or train stations to see.
---
Especially now that Sent/Cav has a 75% chance of protecting you, it keeps you on your toes now.
---
It'd be a trade-off.  If you want the more valuable scrap, you equip the perk.  If you don't, then you don't.
---
Personally, I have to swap out a bunch of perks when I craft anyway, so I don't see it as particularly onerous.
---
Glad I'm not the only one to think this.
---
I lost 45 stable flux, 100 ultracite and a sentinel armor piece due to this.  Feels bad man.  Learned my lesson though.
---
I've gotten a high rank Deathclaw but all the others have always been something smol like a tick / radroach / bloatfly and bloodbug. I plan on trying to test it more tonight and try to power level up the kelp / sludge to see if i get a better creature. sadly because the game makes you drink water when trying to pick up the kelp/sludge it's much harder than killing deer that just suicide on my deathclaw gauntlet
---
Good lucküòÇüòÇ
---
Use armor piercing(one woth 35 bullets)
---
There are other colours of clean asylum uniforms at the same place, but other players often take them so you might need to trek through the whole place a few times. I got 2 different clean uniforms in one trip once, and a lot of different clean hats.
---
I just put stuff in my inventory and sell it from there. It dosent do that stupid thing if I do that.
---
If I had seen you had screws for 1c each, I would have bought the lot.
---
Not going to say how much I would pay though lol that's up to you mate.
---
Cheers
---
You too lol üòÇ
---
gauss is single shot rifle, and subject to the rifleman cards and tank killer,long shot and sniper.
---
the ammo is under energy
---
I hope it works for you!
---
THIS
---
yeah no more bringing junk with me lmaooo
---
Well, I guess you just gotta be quick. Or, as I did with the Helvetia event (I forgot how to spell it sorry), you just gotta know where it will spawn, or all of the locations it may spawn. Use things like mines to notify you if an enemy is at the spawn location or not, or find a vantage point where you can survey the locations. And with Tesla rifles, you don‚Äôt need to aim at the mob, just aim at its feet and it will branch off and hit the mob anyway. As for them using vats to kill it quickly, it still takes one or two shots for most high level mobs to go down. Essentially, get an understanding of the environment the mobs will spawn at, and use it to your advantage. 
---
I hope this helps, and sorry for it being so long.
---
This happens on PS4 and Xbox 1, it's annoying.
---
This honestly sounds like the best idea wish people could spec roles
---
Hey man I totally agree with you on that note. I‚Äôm glad it works as intended on the armor side. I have no problem with that. I just wish it worked like that with the actual weapon too.
---
Yeh anyone here have a bone hammer or bone club legendary for sale or trade hit me up!   
---
Been wanting one for MOONS... Have caps, 1 stars, junk, ammo, shielded underarmour you name it.
---
You can change them as you level up - if you choose a perk card and you end up not needing it or it's not useful you can just switch it for another card. Your special points cap when you hit level 50 and from there you get the choice to either pick a perk or move one of your special points. So if you accidentally give yourself 9 Endurance and you want more Charisma you take one from endurance and move it to charisma etc :)
---
Really mate, cheers
---
My fame is arriving tomorrow so I‚Äôm gonna be a newbie, but I played all the other fallouts multiple times. Do people do this often?
---
Trying different builds is fun but honestly, if you don't play with other people it gets boring. That's why I like the vendors, I might more people in game this way.
---
Please get a mic and set it to area. Pretty pretty please. Makes the game more fun for you and everyone else around you. Just turn the mic off when you have to pee please.
---
Bacon starts with B, too. I like bacon.
---
id do it for free. caps been maxed out twice already on currently at 15k unfortunately more than what I know what to do with  since I have almost all the recipes and plans but I'm on Xbox sorry
---
I know where there is one random slipper in the game but I can't remember if it's pink...
---
I hate that.  Pisses me off every time.
---
I'd say becoming a wasteland trader is fun, at least to a point.
---
Someone else said once you've added 20, the counter says 1. Then 40 = 2, and 60=3.
---
Problem in general is poor scaling. 
---
Like mentioned about, good rifles can drop them very fast and trivially, while you likely take more damage from the few scorched it might have around. My AA E handmade takes one down in maybe a magazine or two. If it doesn't have any treets to reduce my vats hitchance I can kill one in about minute. So obviously anything so weak can't really give a lot.
---
I've even saw someone saying they were farming them with bloodied build. Can't remember what for, but with bloodied +50% vats single SB might just take few quick bullets to kill, so you could farm them for even XP.
---
But with players with average gear they are difficult, bothersome to kill, and can be dangerous as well.
---
So I think things aren't scaled well. (enemies, weapons, builds, loot)
---
Oh wait my apologies, i get ya now, so you suggest buying the 2* over 3*
---
Do you have any idea what the chances of getting a major perk over a minor?
---
I'm so sorry.
---
Fair enough mate but I doubt that they will make a whole new perk card for it
---
I may .50 ammo in bulk and sell for 1 cap each, also any reasonable 1 star legendary for 400-500 caps. Any extras I sell for 25 caps each if I'm at my stash limit and have bought out the vendor limit for the day. All of my ammo is sold at 1 cap each, regardless of type.
---
So buy my stuff please ID: Drankster033 on PS4
---
Gotta stay one step ahead in survival. Plan every move. Use adventure mode to set up in the spot of your choice. THEN enter survival. No real camp. Just drop the module and whatever crafting you need. All aid stashed. It‚Äôs exciting for sure
---
Kill dupers
---
I do. Have FT trouble as well.
---
I find that with max sneak and a full set of unyielding giving me a preposterously high agility score I die very rarely, because nobody aggros on me. For the SBQ fight I just put on some life saving armor and my maxxed out mysterious savior perk card and lean into my squishiness.
---
I also die a lot during encryptid of course but then everybody dies there.
---
Yeah, just guessing. I honestly didn't do anything for my desktop, it just wasn't a thing there. The dashes on my laptop showed up after patch 9
---
I've also seen someone say that healing factor helps a lot to solo all 3 pylons, just gotta get in a spot where u can crouch undetected
---
Charging shotgun Tesla. I've had this puppy since lvl 50 (now 131). I keep it handy for ghoul mobs and robots. Don't even need to aim when surrounded. Just keep pulling the trigger and watch the sparks fly.
---
And use a maxed out super duper perk card when you do it. Also the scrapper card is nice to use when scrapping after mass crafting guns so you don‚Äôt lose as much steel.
---
Do covert op and mr sandman stack?
---
Yea in WS I often run into paperbags full of stuff, sometimes bulked material sometimes even stable fluxes. Some brave folks bring all their precious belongings to war lol
---
Would be amazing but unlikely, this game could barely survive when each player had 400 lbs weight limit and now imagine if every player had 800 lbs limit plus a companion multiplied 24 players.
---
dont tell me what to do , your not my dad FRANK!!!! 
---
My dad was an astronaut who died in space!!!!!!  Mom told me!
---
 Yeh anyone here have a bone hammer or bone club legendary for sale or trade hit me up!

Been wanting one for MOONS... Have caps, 1 stars, junk, ammo, shielded underarmour you name it.  &lt;3
---
It‚Äôs crazy that a AAA game company still has bugs the level of an asset flip on Steam.
---
Asking about foundations and being fed up with silly game issues is toxic?
---
I bought 2* till i got a doable weapon with my build. Then i switched to 3 star. U have nore chance to get something close to wat u want if u do 2 then switch to 3 to get your god tier
---
Weight reduction armor perk is actually in the 3rd or Minor Slot, so it's only found on 3* armor, I'm currently using 4 Unyielding, +AP refresh, WWR, and 1 Chameleon, +AGI, WWR, I also sometimes swap out 1 piece for an Unyielding, +STR, JWR piece
---
All good mate wasn't sure if you were being sarcastic or not.
---
What I'm saying is that if we have to use screws to make the hand made rifle then we should get some back when we scrap them.
---
I sell bobbleheads for 100 caps. Is that reasonable or should i lower that a bit?
---
I kind of figured that automated alerts seemed like a no-brainer with the personal terminals being added.
---
erz der gearm werf ert?
---
At least One Violent Night has a notification - sort of. Whenever the Sons of Dane radio goes active, there's a pop up, but I think people don't pay attention to the radio pop ups because they're usually pointless.
---
Right? I thought maybe mine was glitching and that's why I only had scout stuff and Biv. Guess not.
---
&gt;now with the Legendary Vendor and once the three star is fixed it will be even more ridiculously powerful in the hands of the worthy.
---
OP was referring to this. However which way you think it will be fixed? Removal of 2-3 star wood armor from Purveyor. Or ability to have 3 star wood armor?
---
It's really unbelievable we have to suggest that.  An event, that requires multiple people to complete properly, gets no server wide notification.
---
It's pretty pathetic as designs go they completely forgot to do that.
---
Oh okay I‚Äôm mistaken then. Is it possible to find it on let‚Äôs say Vanguard sentinel?
---
Ayy someone else who framed their plant poster :)
---
It really depends on what the 2\* effect is though.
---
Someone posted a list of the potential 3\* effects and there really aren't that many worthwhile ones - I think 25% faster fire rate was the only one that I'd find desirable on weapons.  But things like 40% swing speed and explosive are 2\*.
---
Armor is a different story with Sent/Cav, but it's a rare effect in practice and because I've gotten to the point where it's like "I want Cav on my Right Arm," I'm just resigned to it-happens-when-it-happens, rather than playing a slot machine for it.
---
What they have free nuts now? How you get it? Is it like how you can make lemonade without lemons in Fallout 76?
---
I played Destiny 1, i remember how people HATED that Rahool would decrypt purples into blues, Bungie listened and changed it
---
but here people are ok with the same thing?
---
meh
---
Ever listen to the broadcast?  It tells you that they need help dealing with the wendigo.
---
Yeah, I usually miss those pop up notifications, because it's usually to tell me "Checkpoint" or "You have contracted Parasites." lol
---
This is never going to make it in. I see where your coming from, I just know this isn't making it in.
---
Nah not interested in paying atoms for that. Give us private dedicated server options like so many other survival crafting games out there, like ARK and Minecraft and such things. There are official servers hosted for you by the company or you can set up your own dedicated server on your side, network, PC, w/e that you and friends can play on. 
---
We'd finally get to open up the modding community options if that ever happens.
---
Yeah exactly why i was curious. Good luck and please let me know!
---
And sorry I‚Äôm not trying to make this an armor argument or anything. I‚Äôm just more worried about the legendary trait on the ranged weapons. I think it should be fixed.
---
I disagree. I'd rather have DLC. It's cheaper and it encourages them to make the game fun enough that we want to buy more. Microtransactions encourage them to make the game grindy so that we feel compelled to pay to fix the balance. I mean hell, look at how the dailies for atoms have gotten more and more annoying which is exactly the kinda thing I'm talking about.  
---
I want to pay for a good game. Not have a game that is designed to be just fun enough to keep me in but also frustrating to get me to actually pay for it.
---
Normally I do it in my house behind locked doors. But it can be done in public if you enter the bench, exit it, drop the stuff and then go back into the bench. Can't take my stuff if I'm standing on it......
---
 I'm not sure that's true. I do seem to have more confuse with 2 pieces. I use a Combat Knife so I am in there with them.
---
 I have not found a good piece to replace one in Heavy Combat anyway.
---
Vanguard's Yes, but Sentinel's &amp; Cavalier's are also Minor modifiers and use the same slot as WR perks
---
Nicely done, thanks!
---
A few plans, like night-vision scopes, can be bought from vendor bots (check Whitespring). But you‚Äôll have to do the ‚Äúscrap-grind‚Äù for most mod plans.  I think I had most mod plans after scrapping about 40 handmades...  I believe some plans, like the suppressor, have a low probability to obtain (it was among the last plans I learned for my handmade).
---
While I agree, the problem is a LOT, I'd say 75-80% of player vendors have no clue, they are NOT on Market or Bazaar 76 and have no idea of current prices.  If the vendor is around I try to help them out and let them know they are not gonna make any money selling serums for 3,000 caps.  If their not around I drop a bag of fert on top of their vending machines, also add a corn or nuc material if the prices are really bad.
---
I WAS WEARING MY ARMOR!!
---
I was tapering off on my PvE Shotgunner. I collected tons of rare outfits, plans, made a camp I could be proud of, etc. Going from playing almost everyday to maybe twice a week. I made a sneaky rifleman for PvP. I used weapons and armor I found on my shotgunner once I hit level 50 on my rifleman I was ready to go. Now when I play I'm farming chems and junk from other players! When you get a good battle going between 5 or more people at whitesprings (who aren't teamed up and full god roll armor) it's so much fun.
---
Incredibly they have this feature possible in game, enabled and able to be used, functional on the Sheepsquatch event, and they forgot to set it up for the new event.  WTF programmers, what were you thinking?
---
Um...no? Open your map paranoid pussificant, this is a video game.
---
Lvl 203 human I use wood armor
---
I spend most of my time doing PA part runs so I end up with like 30+ fusion cores at 25% constantly. I sell them for 5 caps
---
Yeah, the deathclaws are my entrance to my farm with a sign next to them saying, "Deathclaw Farms". They help fill the theme. Also have some cats scattered around my farm cause I like cats :).
---
Well, yes... selling items is breaking EULA, but having just a listing of items on website isn't breaking any of the EULA. Just having a listing on website with prices behind it, doesn't equal to selling. And I can make that listing even without buying the game/launching game, means I have no obligations to Bethesdas EULA, because I haven't accepted it. If person A makes the listing and person B does the transactions, then it's the person B who is breaking the EULA, not person A. And that is why Bethesda has no power over websites that are selling RMT items.
---
Last question, is this at close / extremely close range?
---
you have my upvote.
---
Gotta keep all three alive.  I got the Stimpack Diffuser recipe from completing it with all three critters alive.
---
Ahh got ya. And sorry I‚Äôm not trying to make this an armor argument or anything. I‚Äôm just more worried about the legendary trait on the ranged weapons. I think it should be fixed.
---
I would like to note something my friend showed me last night - if you go to your personal terminal in your camp  - under automated alerts it will say something about escaped animals in the pharmacy and it will give you coordinates and when you go down the elevator then the event will start! Worked for me! Only showed in the terminal one time tho.
---
It would also be cool to be able to loot the alpha creature something like in destiny were everyone is able to get their own loot from one npc
---
i love how people are downvoting this
---
poor guy has a real issue, he isnt raging, he isnt freaking out
---
it is a known issue that bethesda has acknowledged
---
some fans of video games really defend the companies that they cant even hear valid criticism of the game they love
---
I love this game, played it for hundred of hours so far, but im not blind to the fact that the game has issues, and communication about them helps everyone
---
 Not any more, but I had some of it, back when I used Black Powder Pistols.
---
Save it as favorite
---
Rewards and design of these new encounters are really bad. Bethesda is just recycling old items and enemies to these new encounters. If you have seen one encounter already in game these doesn't bring anything particularly new. Just cheap copy-paste content.
---
I can confirm the kelp does not respawn fast enough to fill the trough - the only one I've been able to fill to max is the deer so far.
---
They have this logic fix 2 bugs break 10 more and then the other ones likes this or the discovering certain things or the possum badges or ... I‚Äôll just stop there you get the idea...
---
6 months but don‚Äôt let the atom shop give a freebie because they will fix that ASAP.
---
Don‚Äôt give a benefit of anything to the player base because they will fix that too ...
---
FFR is also second star.   The only good weapon third stars are vats-based or weight reduction.  But 2 stars don‚Äôt sell well on subReddits.   IMO, if you are looking for a tool to use then you get more chances buying 2 star weapons.   If you ever want to trade it stick with 3*.
---
NP, like I said though, Bethesda has known about the issue since early Beta, and has not addressed it.
---
They really need to up the group size from 4 to 8...
---
Manipulation of game files or dev room item.

Do you have carnivore?
---
I will happily kill my self to help you üòÇ Psn ZzappBrannigan ... msg me on there when you‚Äôre ready to do it. I should be online 4-5pm British time and again at 8:30-9:30pm British time
---
Yeah seems like a long shot but thought I‚Äôd give it a try.
---
Someone posted a video that had a friendly deathclaw and a friendly charred ghoul.
---
Do you have more than one camera? Apparently if you have more than one, you gotta figure out which is the one the game recognizes (because it will only recognize photos from one of the cameras).  
---
That's all the help I can give (other than to ask are you sure they are in the right area?).
---
I lock up tight at camp. But i have a stash, stove and PA bench outside along with a bed a guitar and a couch. Plus water and a farm. I just dont like people in my actual house seeing me doung the weird shit i i do. But i accommodate for travelers.

I submitted a support ticket yesterday about this since the dashes are still around after Patch 9.5. Here's what I got back:

Now that you mention it......

Let me peak.

I've noticed a few who nuke prime site but ever since the legendary vendor came out, no one is fighting the queen. The small few who show up are just shooting all the mobs that spawn
---
I have 4 weight redux pieces for weapons and it works charms some weapons weight less then a pound ( heaviest 4 lbs handmade )
---
hi, sorry this happened, I find that when this happens to me (and it does happen) to try and wait a bit for the meat pile to appear with the buzzing flies, I usually try to figure out where the enemy originally spawns at, as usually for some weird reason the game makes the body disappear when you kill it, but then it places the body back at the that initial enemy spawn point
---
its alot easier to do this at whitesprings as once youve ran the loop a few times you get to know where the placement of enemies is
---
and with the "enemy body fell into the stairs" issue, you can also wait a bit and sometimes if you are lucky, the game will pop out the meat pile outside of the stairs
---
sometimes you have to wait a few minutes for this to happen
---
hope this helps you in the future
---
ahh okay that helps, so if i go 2* I'm going to get a major (like explosive) over a minor?
---
I'll have to put this to the test, thanks!! if this is the case i think ill go for the 2*
---
If you have carnivore and its' not like chicken soup then it most likely won't count.
---
Glowing fungus soup works fine for me as of 8 hours ago.
---
either press stimpak in error (6 mnths down the line) or when I need the stimpak,
---
up pops the emotes  - died SO many times. and yes - stop wot your doing, push buttons (slowly and deliberatly, just f'ing DO IT),wake up the household (JUST..DOOOO  ..IT).  rant, moan ,whine, whinge................
---
Nope.
---
i find any critical post is met with downvotes, pretty ridiculous
---
The 25k pies are usually just a joke, but some people have the audacity to put actual good stuff on sale for 25k.
---
NOBODY CAN AFFORD THEM, YOU IDIOTS. THEY ALREADY SPENT CAPS GETTING TO YOUR CAMP
---
No, I've never actually listened to it.  I started playing at launch but my son--who'd played the beta--said it happened any time you were near the Sons of Dane compound, so I believed him and never bothered.  Damn...I thought I raised him better than that.  haha
---
I got lucky and found someone selling The Fixer plans in their vending machine. Keep an eye out for event farmers selling extra plans
---
New weapon, you need the unarmed skills for it. it also makes noises when you punch.
---
I would like to see more types legendary effects added. This that provide utility and not just damage buffs. So we can have more types if character builds. That not like small mini games in C.A.M.Ps to increase player interaction. Like gambling for caps
---
This happened to me last night - I had gotten in and it wasn't initiated so I was trying to get my party of high levels in so we could try to max out all 3 habitats when some stupid level 5 came in and started it and then just stood around the rest of the event and didn't help feed / protect and only one of my party got in. It was really frustrating :/ like get out of here if you're not going to help. 
---
I normally don't mind lower levels trying to get some XP from events but normally they're helping revive or draw mobs away or SOMETHING. but this idiot just stood there like WHAT HAPPEN
---
Chameleon armor pieces make you invisible when you crouch.
---
Same here. Really want that beam focuser. First weapon I can actually see my damage register on SBQ.
---
As close as possible I imagine; for example, when a Feral Ghoul in Whitesprings starts to melee attack me right in front of me.
---
Oh, they'll never do it.  I'm just speculating.
---
Make me thinks of Leroy Jenkins
---
haha feels back man, thanks! :)
---
I have everything personal locked up , outside on main base / bar / vending area there‚Äôs stash boxes everywhere blend in with the decor and only one tinker bench , don‚Äôt need people loitering around longer then needed so , give them just the option to break down and store and move along ...
---
Good advice! thanks!
---
I use unyielding armor 4 pieces with a chameleon piece I have collected a full set of sentinel armor but with the unyielding armor boosting my stats so much I have not used it yet
---
Although I don't use it, some people swear by it. Instead of removing it completely, just remove it from the 2 and 3 star pool. No sense trading in 100 scrip only to get a wooden chest piece.
---
I'm not too sure they added new effects. But I did see that some weapons can now spawn with legendary effects. Like the bone club
---
Damn.thx again
---
The ghoul is only rank 1 though. The more food you input into the feeder the higher the rank of the animal. I am curious what a rank 3 would be for radkelp and toxic sludge
---
You are correct on the CT\_X, Sorry for doubting, have not looked at those entries since the B.E.T.A. period when XEdit's reading of the '76 game files was in it's infancy.  
---
Do you have an idea, looking at the weapon, why it would not properly scrap?
---
I don't see why not as there's already hide drying racks in the game - you can find them with leather laying over them near most of the cabins etc. They've implemented other things we've wanted before like the ability to have rocks disappear when building in camps or (known) appearing before plans. /shrug you never know! there could be a hunting DLC some day lol
---
My statue was the last thing I wanted to place.  I put it somewhere and can't move it so I guess it is now a permanent fixture next to my vending machines.
---
I had this idea but with a vampire Gatling gun , then swapped to my vampire tommy gun seemed to worked better a the cost of the 45. Round.
---
To bad people are idiots ( most ) and don‚Äôt read the prompts , active pylon to make creature vulnerable...
---
Sigh ...
---
Or Bethesda can remove the need to ‚Äútag‚Äù an enemy during large group events. Everyone in the event should be entitled to the drop regardless of tagging it.
---
I think it's personal preference.
---
I like the three star weapons because: I farm legendaries and the RNG of getting 3\*'s from loot drops to be not great (nested rng upon rng upon rng etc), so I take the opportunity to get them guaranteed from the vendor.  And the scrip re-exchange rate on a 3\* weap is 40, the rate on 2 2\* weapons is 15+15=30, if you care about that sort of thing (and it reduces the amt of stuff eating my inventory space 1 vs 2 weap.) I also like the three star effects, personally, so they have good value to me.
---
Totally agree with this full 100% I've wasted so much plastic on this
---
Don't be scared to scarp weapons you find. Most of them come easily at end game.
---
Haha, exactly like Leroy Jenkins! Maybe i should change the title to ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Leroy Jenkins the new event‚Äô hahaha
---
Cooking oils shouldn‚Äôt either ... 6 months and running
---
Thanks for the heads up that‚Äôs useful
---
Hide stretching? Why not? We have in game locations with hides hanging loosely over racks.. I assume they're meant to be tanned already, or turned into buckskin.. but there's no evidence of the actual process of *working* the hides. 
---
‚Ä¶ and it matters to me, dammit.
---
This has been happening to me a ton lately. Do you think maybe it's because when you die - the game isn't registering that you have a backpack?
---
Do you have a picture of the backpack skin?  I haven't seen it yet
---
I'm having issues with the stimpack button, seems I have to completely stop everything, step back from the fight im in and press and hold it for it to work. Fo4 you just tapped that shit even wile wildly flailing around you would still heal.
---
If you're on PS4, I would *love* to come by and take some pics.  lmk
---
Great job!
---
I cant make it till I get my scout badges lol
---
Take your time. Rushing anything is the enemy of fun in this game.
---
We've gotten a Mirelurk a few times as well as the deathclaw.
---
Person A accepts the money Person B delivers the item. Basically acting like an Employee or independent contractor of person A. 
---
It's a weak loophole but I get what you're saying.
---
You‚Äôre misunderstanding. I mean anything that is part of a crafting recipe. Not anything that can be broken down into scrap that you can craft with. 
---
For example, digested goo is used to make psycho, so you‚Äôd have to manually scrap it. A used oil can isnt used for anything but scrapping, so it would auto scrap.
---
How about letting us know where to go too?
---
I did end up getting in.
---
Went back to my camp, checked my personal computer thing for the arktos 'quest'. 
---
Then FT'd to Gregs mining supplies and walked up to Arktos.
---
I also made sure I was NOT in my PA.
---
Yeah, i think the mirelurk is rank 2 out of three. I would assume maybe a queen or a king would be the rank 3 but it is unclear
---
If you wanna shoot me a message I can try to join after work today. GT is the same as here.
---
No selling fallout stuff
---
That's funny, I team up so often I had no idea that limit existed. 
---
MMO my ass. I love this game and I'm totally addicted to it, but it's a Fall Out that happens to have other people playing at the same time, not a multiplayer Fall Out.
---
We've been asking for this for ages and they mentioned it once and talked that it was difficult to fix. Then they purposely forgot about it and we all did too.
---
And the bone hammer and the shovel as well ouo!!
---
This is actually Fallout canon, after WWII they wanted to save money on screws so they made them out of material that dissolves in air. That's why you have to keep replacing them.
---
I'd say knock a little off if you want to shift them. Maybe 10-20%
---
As a person that plays exclusively ranged, I use cavalier set and ditch sentinel. 
---
IMO sentinel is only useful on very long range or against noobs.
---
At short range, you either crouch or you are vatsed to death. You can also supplement your sentinel with stealthboys, but if you do, good enemy will pull out quad auto tesla and stagger you to heaven.
---
You can only stand still and keep shooting at ranges greater than vats permit, and this is where sentinel shines.
---
But when distances are smaller, its all see and not be seen because as soon as you stand still you get vatsed. 
---
This is why cavalier is good for ranged builds - if you have better position than your opponent, you are more likely to win, and with cavalier you can use obstructions to break vats targeting and get to better position while being decently protected, then go back to crouching and reappear from this better position.
---
People who say sentinel is for ranged and cavalier is for melee have no idea about PvP in this game. They both serve different purposes for different playstyles and if you know how to use them they will be great whatever your weapon is.
---
I *really* wish the disease-resistant perks also made you recover from diseases faster. I've maxed that perk card and still get sick every damn day.
---
I‚Äôm loosing the will to play , after seeing and doing everything ... it just not really fun when the new content is broken , can‚Äôt really go forward without giving two step backward or sideways...
---
And the future looks not so appealing when they plan to integrate a new pvp mode ( who plays this for pvp ?)
---
Not me sure I‚Äôm here for the PVE and if you can shut up on the mic I appreciate that I don‚Äôt care what loot you found or what damage your pushing , ain‚Äôt trying to measure dicks here just trying to sit down have a nice time away from the real world for just a fucking minute or two without being frustrated by something or somebody ...
---
Trapping. I want trapping. SO BADLY. 
---
Craft the traps out of steel and springs. Set them (have to remember your locations), and have to check them... perhaps a greater yield of hides and mats from doing so?
---
Haha!! Excellent point
---
Yea i honestly thought it would prevent people under level 50 from accessing the elevator buttons since it says 50+ but i saw low levels as well so apparently not. I have found that if you have people wait in the elevator upstairs you can make it almost impossible to access the buttons on the elevator until your group is in and ready.
---
So is it worth it?
---
VATS has always been buggy since it was changed for this game, seems you need to wait a few seconds before firing for it to actually be at that percentage. Stating this as my entire build was made for vats gunslinger.
---
They don't even have meat - just wood and bone - and even though they have a Y for Butcher's Bounty it never turns anything up.  They bother me.
---
Is it titled fo76 trading?
---
I keep forgetting that it does this. There was a point when it wouldn't scrap your bulked junk.
---
Yeah, I'm all over the place with armor because I prioritized Sent or Cav as I found it.  Hunters, Nocturnal, Chameleon, and a couple Unyielding.
---
I could do more damage if I had more Unyielding, yes, but I do enough to kill most things quickly anyway.  And I ultimately need to survive standing in front of the SBQ.
---
Does anyone know if this has been fixed yet?
---
My base is right next to Alpha. Benches, beds, vending all open. About 6 l as large purifiers unlocked. Take a break while shopping or before launching.
---
there is a terminal where you can change the targetting parameters, or just shut them off.
---
That's probably true.
---
No one would ever accuse markets of being rational.
---
Lol no. Capitalism is centuries old. You can live long enough to see game theory turn 100 years.
---
I don‚Äôt use a backpack.  But do benefit from unyielding armor.  I think it sometimes uses your base stats when performing the calculations.
---
it is a curious psychological attachment some people have to modern products, consumerism, like most of the human conditions, can devolve into an almost tribalistic defense of a chosen product.
---
it really is an unhealthy way to approach life, particularly when most of the companies that manufacture the products could care less about the people who consume/buy their products, modern corporations only care about ever increasing profits and maintaining the bottom line.
---
yet still, people latch onto a certain product, or company, and somehow feel the need to blindly defend them no matter what valid criticism is leveled at them
---
its an unfortunate byproduct of modern capitalistic/cunsuymeristic society
---
we have been programmed by advertising to believe that the things we buy define us
---
this is dangerous thinking and undervalues the independent thinking of an individual
---
some people love coca-cola but dislike people who drink pepsi for no other reason other than it is a direct competitor to their "chosen" product, and vice versa
---
look at Xbox vs PS4 , the list goes on and on
---
and of course, its not just products that people latch onto and defend even when it seemingly is counterproductive to their own beneficial well being, look at the sorry state of our partisan, divided political realities we live in
---
Capitalism as it best , I marked shit for 500 , 1000 caps I don‚Äôt sell garbage just plans and drinks.
---
I don‚Äôt care the price if I like i pay , same mentality for people buying if you can‚Äôt afford or won‚Äôt pay shut up and move out
---
So Mister Sandman works? (Apologies for necrothread)
---
I have been getting headshots actually, the thing though before firing with vats I wait a few seconds before firing, I believe the percent coming up too early and game using prior percent chances.
---
Note: There is a similar bug that makes a teammate appear at a different location of the map than they actually are, except they are totally invisible/intangible.
---
If you sell for one cap you don‚Äôt get anything in return
---
Beaver tail should be a food option in this game. 
---
The beavers are a huge pet peeve for me. Massive.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OKOQ0jg5bo&amp;feature=youtu.be at 4:46. Level 62 Rover the Charred Feral Ghoul
---
Yeah I mean we already have the bear traps that work in game - it would be neat even if you could only put them at your camp and they could have the potential to trap small animals and then occasionally something bigger that you then have to fight. Would be a more fun way to get meat / leather than just going to flatwoods and killing low level things.
---
Are you sure the friendly animals are alive?
---
No it's not a theory.
---
Encryptid and SBQ are the only ones that I know that have a seever wide notification.
---
How is Thursday? That‚Äôs my first day off
---
Ya know.... fast travel mats were in the beta. They were also in every other fallout game. No reason why we cant have this stuff
---
All the hot money flows into perfect items. Slightly flawed items are cheap.
---
Correct, but if you look to the side of the name it says that it is rank one. The more of each food you input, the higher the rank of creature. The deathclaw is rank 3.
---
Oh, by the way, if you‚Äôre ever struggling to get plastic... just server hop Grafton Steel over and over, kill all the low level super mutants, and scrap their laser rifles, rinse and repeat. Make sure you use the scrapper perk. You can even take the workshop there and get a camp plan for your trouble, as well as build a stash to store your plastic. Quick and easy.
---
The Project Paradise event is a good example of why I don't have a dog because I can't seem to keep an animal alive in that event.
---
I'll have to try that because it was really frustrating. We had a level 14 and 5 down there just sitting on their hands. Like I know everyone wants to do the new content but if you're gonna be there then help. 
---
Since we found out you can use the personal terminal to actually initiate it - we did that instead - got our group on the server and started it with the terminal and then went there.
---
Hey this game recommends you sell it at those values so either your wrong or Bethesda in their infinite wisdom is wrong and I'm betting the one with infinite wisdom is right with what they recommend I sell it for. (Sarcasm)
---
I saved a bunch of legendaries for the vendor. Then I got a couple 3* items and the type of weapons and armor were basically trash so I'd go with multi roll unless you've been saving up the scrip
---
Fast travel to event rather then the building entrance ...
---
Plus pro tip avoids a loading screen
---
I do just fine, I'de say I have a harder time beating the good that I already have. My point is: buying items is cheating, you only have 2 cheat cause u aren't good enuff.
---
Last night I got down the elevator, event was up but not started. 12 minutes had already gone by and everyone that was down there were all just running around. Counting me, there were about 6 other people down there. I started up the experiment so we could get going, and some random guy wearing the old man winter mask started punching me and did the thumbs down emote over and over. If he was waiting on his teammates, that's not my problem, especially considering that 12 minutes had already gone by and no one had bothered starting the event. Your teammates, and my own, can join at any point before the event ends ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
When I rolled a "reduced limb damage" effect on my armor, I decided to check in the game files for the list of legendary effects. There's nothing of note - the only other legendary effects I found in the files that I've never heard of in-game look like holdovers from Fallout 4, and unused 4th and 5th stars. Neither of which are actually guaranteed to become playable in-game (although Bethesda will definitely add five-star legendaries at some point).
---
It actually seems like anti-limb damage was always there in the files, and was only activated when they added the Purveyor.
---
If your wearing all Wood armor.. you are Groot
---
I doubt Bethany Esda was listening to the 'food builds' they just added whatever they had planned. You have Survival for your pvp focused game, otherwise you get griefers
---
I like it like 90 percent of the time. Try to make it a game just keep jumping try to get on top of a crafting station and wait for everything to load. The other 10 percent of the time I forget about the game and get stuck
---
It helps if you are in an area where other vendor camps are nearby. Think about the strategy behind a shopping mall. Also, make sure you are playing at a time when a lot of people are on. I notice a ton of people on between 8pm-1am US Eastern time. Also, make sure the gear you are selling is appropriate for the location of your camp. If you are selling high level legendaries near Vault 76, you probably aren't going to get many takers. Likewise,  no one in the bog is going to buy starter gear.
---
I would love SWAT outfit but if only if modern version of it.
---
Most of us have been playing video games for the better part of 10+ years and somehow we're still struggling with the concept of reading mechanics
---
LITERALLY kills me 
---
Ayyyeeee
---
Confirmed it's been removed from the tables.
---
Oh yeah I do too and you might be right about that. It's like "you're dead so you don' have armor ha!"
---
Post here if you do.
---
I have a beer cap for sale for 69 caps, someone will buy that I know it!
---
I've bought them at that just to complete that consume bobbleheads challenge.
---
My record is 5...normally it's 3...but I really went for it on that 5 spot.
---
Oh a typical reddit pve noob... What does pvp have to do with griefing? I am not even able to destroy anything... It's a joke and Survival? I get a whole 12caps per kill.... Yeah totally worth it... NOT
---
I dropped my Furious Handmade and didn't realize till the next time I logged in. I was.... furious obviously. Hope someone found it and appreciated their luck.
---
I would like a few more slots too because I have all girls and I want to make a male character but I don't have room and I like all my girls :c
---
The meta in pvp is literally to sit with an ass/sent set because you can barely be damaged. But thanks for the downvote and shoutout. 
---
Thats why before the dupe wave assassin sentinel sets were literally priceless. Its still the strongest pvp armor set, bar none. Range doesnt change it.
---
Yeah I did 2 servers of camps looking for gun or plan 
---
It's obviously because beth knows what i want
---
Got it, thanks!
---
No idea, some douche at the bottom Said he reported it to the mods and Bethesda I think
---
No problem. Always good to ask questions. Yes it does but only if you having it after covert ops to give you the full 3.75x sneak hit.
---
Ah! I was confusing rank and level. I'm with you now. Sorry.
---
In survival everyone is camping and spawn trapping... Fun isn't it?
---
This has rage chronicles written all over it. And I love it.
---
If anything, they need to make Wood Armor situationally viable through the perk system or a new talent system.
---
This goes with Power Armor types no one ever uses unless theyre collecting their first one like the Power Raider Armor.
---
Some perks that buff those power armor situationally would be interesting incentive to use other Power Armors.
---
Yea im in the same boat, everything I've got was trash, saved 1000scrip on 2 accounts before the trader came in, and after rolling about 30-40 3* weaps Ive got 1 half decent weapon, might start getting 2* until Ive got a few things i need, then go for the 3*
---
Is is a glitch or a foreshadowing for the Vault battle royal mode?
---
If you are not scrapping for mods I could recommend you sell the guns and buy junk with screws on Whitesprings. They also have bulk of screws sometimes. Also, selling the junk without scrapping could give you more caps if you play as a scavenger. Is not hard get screws.
---
orchid they‚Äôve said that when it WASNT scrapping that it was bugged.  According to Bethesda bulk junk was always supposed to auto scrap.
---
50 cal ammo not worth a lot. Can craft 180 a pop with ammosmith. 38 is abundant too. I normally just drop in starting area.
---
I‚Äôve had bone worms for as long as I can remember.
---
I haven't tried it but I'll do it
---
FYI - Icon Prefixes... hasn't been updated for the new patch, so don't download that one yet.
---
I wish we had one too so that people could actually get organized and figure out roles so it's not such a cluster. It would be nice if you could organize like this group is gonna work on Feeding A / this one to B and this group is going to kill mobs and these people are going to focus on protecting the friendly animal and these will fight the boss and make teams to make sure everyone gets rewards etc :/ it's frustrating to try to attempt with randoms - even when you have your own group going
---
I don't think you're ever had a tamed pet before because thats literally what you talking about patch 9 they don't attack random ppl.. Just like a turret doesn't go off unless there is an enemy.
---
And they aren't killable unless you enter pvp with someone or placed your base where a bunch of enemies spawn. (Not saying they're indestructible)
---
They are placed under the same conditions as your base in patch 9. 
---
Secondly they already are basically cosmetic dog or cat lvl 2-5 nothing but cosmetic they dnt serve a purpose other than looks not to guard or protect but just moving around.
---
Didn't think I'd have to draw a picture for you but here it is buddy
---
And you are complaining..
---
it helps a liot, especially when you do a run with lots of weapon scrapping like WesTek. half again and more the scrap you take out of the run. Just equip the card to scrap.
---
Shooting something with a regular gun is fun, but shooting something with a gun that eplodes is more fun?
---
Very true, in saying that no one takes caps for these items, they want to trade for other perfect items haha
---
And nobody stimpacks you literally just standing next to you waiting to loot your bag , but guess what I don‚Äôt pick shit up during this event lol !
---
Damn it! This vaccinated perk sucks
---
Let's please not ask for things to be removed because they're too difficult. There are those of us who don't find SB's hard in any fashion. I farm them for xp when I want to change my build set up and I don't have the perks. They're some of the best and easiest xp farm in the game now.
---
I am glad you cannot destroy things in Adventure.   But the rules should be loosened for Survival to allow camp destruction and higher win payouts.   Maybe 100 caps per kill.
---
I know. RageChronicles understands the substantial. Allmost all  the people on reddit are food builds that got destroyed by a PVP build. They are all just mad since they died and lost 50 caps. I hate the food builds complaining about everything...
---
Yea they can join at any point but you only have so much time to fill the feeding troughs to level up the friendlies. If you see people waiting be courteous or join a different server and initiate it on your own and do as you would like. If other people initiate it be respectful.  If its not started quick enough for you, then as i said, join another server and initiate the event yourself and then start it when you want and do as you would like.
---
The only thing I haven't been able to solo are the Encryptid Event and the SBQ and the Arktos event due to these being the end game content in a multi-player game and people always show up to these events any with the exception of encryptid anymore. Everything else is soloable.
---
I still use Power Armor for SBQ but what really sucks is previous to the unyielding armor I had several weight reduction by 20% armor pieces that were modded with pocketed/ deep pocketed I can't use.
---
I do 2 star weapons. 3 star kept giving me berserker explosive or suppressor vats. 2 star has been giving me items all over but I got my anti armor explosive pipe gun which I love. The 3rd perk for double scrip cost isn‚Äôt worth it for me.
---
That would be a really neat feature.
---
Hmm. How much damage you do without any weapon? I find it a bit not credible.
---
I sell as cheap as possible at I cap per bullet and the first person who wants to trade gets all ammo of any type free only one type though
---
which new event? I assume the paradise one ?
---
It's so annoying at this point.
---
nope.  give up
---
Yeah that would be excaclty what I want and make the base fkng destroyable if ur not in pacifist mode! It's still stupid
---
I've only seen it on him once in 100+ interactions
---
The cobbler gave me dysentery last time...
---
First, farm 1000 screws.
---
Craft/scrap handmades until you're put of materials
---
Then farm 1000 more screws.
---
It should only take scrapping 200 - 300, before you unlock them all.
---
Or, you can just find someone else to mod them for you?
---
Thanks for the advice mate, but paying 10caps for 1 screw at White springs doesn't interest me.
---
It's green and white with a wolf in the center. Same color scheme as the lab coat. I'd take a pic but it's bed time ü§£
---
I try to jump out of the way but last time the camp was on a cliff... needless to say I died...lol
---
Yeah it hot the first hour, now there's not enough people to get rank 3 animal even one
---
Have you found the guy selling the You've Been Insulted! notes for 25k?
---
Yes. If you are on PS4 I'll sell it
---
My carrot soup and corn soup are fine. I live off those and blackberry juice. Alphabetically all towards the top for eating on the run.
---
I thought that at first but then I thought about it  more. Bethesda has never told anyone one time how to actually play the story. Not in fallout3, fallout4 or 76. Obsidian didn't tell us how to do the story in new Vegas either. These games are decision based. You can walk out of the vault team up at level 1 and technically go straight to the endgame. I have 2000 hrs on fallout 3 and around a 1000 on fallout 4. I've already hit 500 hours on 76. 99% of the time you see Bethesda post something like this it's when they know they have a bug. As I said my first playthrough I completed the mission and challenge. This time nothing. I'm not the only one either. I am sure this is a bug.
---
They also gotta stop making workshops for pve only. That's stupid. The range from workshops should be all over the map!
---
Thank you for the feedback I am not a starter so I know however I have a lot of ammo and would like to do something better than just get rid of it if you want to trade and be the first you get your pick of any 1 type of ammo all free
---
Fellings aren't hurt? üòÇ I'm just trying to understand what makes you post it üòÇüòÇ

Like I said, 12 minutes had already passed, and there were now 6 people down there. That means their teammates had 12 minutes to get down there to join before the experiment started. So, no, if over 10 minutes have passed, and there's 5+ people down there already, I'm starting it up. If you don't like it, then YOU can server hop to do it elsewhere. Simple as that. Now, if I go down there, and it's just me and one or two other people, and 10+ minutes have passed, then I'm just leaving cause that'll be a waste of time. If the event just started, and I'm alone or one or two other people are down there as well, then I will 10+ minutes or until we have enough people to start it up.
---
You can probably change the site from a regular site to one with a circle that seems to help to focus the beam a lot better when I aim at the enemy.
---
Yep. People will find a reason to complain about anything. If they want people to play by their own arbitrary rules, they'll need to wait for private servers.
---
I see those alot! I wish you could sell combinations of items too in like a bundle - like the You've Been Insulted! + toilet paper + raw fertilizer.
---
I sell items from my inventory. Never glitches
---
" I don't like to read articles " can you tell me the patch notes? Or I can post another thread asking for them.
---
I also have 5 mm Gamma cells fusion cores plasma cores cryo cells etc
---
Another rage kiddo that die too much in survival and want to destroy lvl 10 players CAMP. This is music üòÅ
---
I learned about the "overseer's cache" the hard way. Still smh every now and then.
---
It would be more fun if you could learn how to fucking reply to messages properly
---
My own personal head cannon is all the mods that are already on it are also magic. If we mod a magic rifle are our mods also magic? No,  We're duct-tapping non magic items to our magic rifle.
---
lol it's the "food builds" guy again
---
Agreed...1 cap per screw is a screaming deal.  Saves me from having to search the wastelands in search of desk fans.
---
sometimes
---
Me too. I really enjoyed the event once I was able to get into it lol I really like the layout and the atmosphere and the layout.
---
Good tip!
---
Yes, thank you üëèüèª
---
I understand wanting to wait to start an event cause you got teammates who want to do it as well, but you can only wait so long. I'm not gonna sit there and continue to wait after 10+ minutes have passed; if we got enough high level players after a certain amount of time has passed, I'm starting up the event. Plain and simple
---
This Saturday I am going to attempt to do 20 SBQ fights back-to-back-to-back, etc.
---
Gathering all the supplies I should need over the next couple days.
---
100k 5mm should be sufficient
---
200 stim packs
---
100 purified water, food, etc.
---
and enough spare mats to keep everything repaired.
---
The XP food is throwing me off though. Need to make enough to last, but keep it off main character to keep it from rotting.
---
I need to do this.
---
Some people are very creative indeed, thanks for sharing the image :)
---
We are both down voted üòÇüòÇ
---
When free range starts, I always try to message a few people to let them know it's going. It usually works and we'll get 3-5 people to come join.
---
Got it on xbox less then a week ago. I have found it about a dozen times now. Had the hunters longcoat only once and shoremans only once.
---
(Big) events need a cross-server matchmaking system!
---
Like this: Players who want to take part in a certain event select it on the map and end up in a queue. Once all potential spots are full (let's just arbitrarily say 12 - selected across all region servers), everyone queued gets a popup message telling them that the event is about to begin. If all of these 12 players confirm, they are simultaneously teleported to the starting location of the event, there's a 2 minute get-ready-countdown and then the event starts for these players. If someone declines, he's out and the rest returns to the queue.
---
Simple, effective and highly engaging. Using this system could also be a potential cap sink: just charge 50 caps for joining an event this way (to simulate the fast travel costs). There could also be different queues for different difficulties, similar to the WoW dungeons: normal, heroic, mythic. The higher the difficulty, the better the rewards, of course - and the tougher the enemies. 
---
Also, this would basically *eliminate the need to manually hop servers over and over again* - one of my biggest pet-peeves I have with a game which was marketed as "you‚Äôll never even see a server when you play"...
---
Good legendary prefix wood armor with the shrouded mod is stealthy and light. For someone who is low level and want a full set of stealthy armor, you could do worse.
---
I agree about removing it from the purveyor's loot pool if it drops from 3* to 1* once you log out.
---
Awesome. Old World Blues vibe.
---
Meh, a kill is a kill, it's fun when it's new but when the novelty of the explosive wear off, the fun is going too. Taking picture of funny glitches, animation or ragdoll never get old personally
---
But even those shouldn't be multiplayer only. I'm not talking about difficulty. I'm talking about game mechanics.
---
I will agree the rewards aren't anything spectacular - although i do love the Bear arm but I really think the environment in Arktos is neat.
---
You need to find and hire Mr Veterinarian ftw
---
I would also buy from you and I have a bunch of flux if you need any

I feel like such a creep sometimes just going around peoples camps with my camera üòÇ I told my bf that we need to put on suits and go around to camps with cameras while in area chat and pretend to be from an HOA
---
Just saw one on another post. I want it now!
---
Sounds good to me mate
---
How many caps I dare ask
---
Where would you recommend farming 2k Screws my guy
---
Lmao, by your description of the event you seem like the person who just finds high ground and waits to shoot the boss
---
Yes sure... I would beat ur ass out. I don't kill anyone below lvl 50. Have fun playing against my pvp build with Assassin's sentinel and aae laser rifle. But I as a food build won't even know what this is. Btw survival is a joke. The ammo I use to get a kill is more expensive than the kill I get
---
&gt;Event specific Plans
---
It does - there is the Recipe for the Drug P and the Plan for Bear arm - not sure if there's more as I haven't been able to do the event much but it does have event specific plans. 
---
Also I am not sure about you but I saw lots of legendaries down there the couple of times I did it - I saw 3 legendary robots + 2 legendary deer + the alpha all in one event last night.
---
The worst part of the event is the vultures waiting for anyone who didn‚Äôt store their scrap.
---
yeah they havent seemed to learn form almost every other successful game that does this
---
and you are totally right, going into a brand new dungeon should be a unique experience, where you have time to explore and play how you want
---
i remember when the burrows first came out, my team and i tried a few times each night to try it out, but each time we got there, all the enemies were already dead, even the final assaultron
---
it took us 3 nights of that before we even saw any enemies, and then another team of lvl 200+ players rolled through at a lightning speed and slaughtered everything
---
my team only has limited time to play together due to real life and families, so we couldnt just try over and over
---
needless to say, it soured us on Bethesda interpretation of what a dungeon should be
---
please consider instanced dungeons
---
even if it means we can only run it so many times per day, it would be better than how it is now
---
Very much so
---
I sent invites and friend requests to like half the map. I picked up one teammate and several friends but we ended up failing the event. It took a while but we did kill the legendary boss (a fog crawler).
---
Yeah, I learned that very same way.
---
The best mutation I‚Äôve gotten was a kangaroo one. I could jump SO HIGH. My teammate and I were cracking up. I had high rads from collecting water at some point and used a Radaway without thinking. No more kangaroo :(
---
Do you not know how to correctly respond to a comment or did you forget to change to your sock puppet before replying to your own post?
---
8500 or I'll trade for a responders white fire helmet. It doesn't look good on my character
---
Have used nothing else for food today, (except 1 ragstag steak for carry weight) and i guarantee you that if you are seeing 0% food, its a visual bug.
---
Well I have like 2000 Fusion Cells, 1cap each, is like 1800 caps
---
Why am I a rage kiddo u food build? I don't get the point. Ur just a perfect example of a reddit user that has no clue of what's going on in pvp. But then ur complaing about it!
---
So true! Got mine last night. Didn‚Äôt notice he was in water until both achievements popped up. I was tempted to leave the event to go get my backpack but I decided to stick it out.

---
Unfortunately it's still a multiplayer game - whether we like it or not.
---
I agree, however.. This same thing was posted 10 hours ago. It's even higher up on fo76 front page. We don't need multiple posts giving Bethesda common sense
---
Happens to me too, sometimes i need to try 5 times
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is that if i initiate an event it better start when you want it to or i should leave server? Now i wasn‚Äôt around for your example that you mentioned but you sound like the exact person that is pissing people off that want to 100% this event. It is easy to complete but not to 100% it. If you want to act like trash, people will treat you as such (looks at username).
---
You probably know about this but just in case:

Not really, people sell them for 10 caps
---
mmmmmmmm... bacon.
---
the melee bug has been going on for 2 weeks now, it severely hinders a melee character
---
how long can it take to fix what they broke?
---
Meta is to have four person well integrated team that has synergies build not in a single character, but in a set of four. Team that consists only of ass/sents will only be efficient at one thing: camping on the top of hard to access area.
---
Team that has a tank, a interceptor (cavalier), artillery backup (sentinel) and a sneaky support will be able to achieve more.  There are few layers of PvP optimisation available through team mechanics and not having them by definition denies ones access to meta levels. Four ass sentinels, while a respectable force, rarely touch these synergies.
---
The vast majority of PvPers in ass/sent sets I met were fresh meat. I even made one guy who purchased his ass/sent for $ quit the game after whooping his ass and showing him my "garbage" armor. I definitely have more fingers on my hands than good ass/sentinel players I encountered. Those guys and gals kept it at maximum range.
---
meh.  i only do daily challenges by accident.  I don't have time to hunt down and take a picture of a  clownsuit wearing deathskull radscorpion in a rad storm.

I've had several tamed pets.

Name 1 dog

Name 1 cat.

Name 1 damn thing even remotely close the the FROG IN A JAR COSMETIC PET.
---
Again, improve your reading comprehension. Yours sucks.
---
What fixer plans?
---
I love the wood grains I bought every type as they me out
---
I had an issue where I thought I placed a floor piece but it never materialized. Reloaded the game and the flooring piece showed up.
---
The biggest thing i can say is take the pylons, and bring a lot of stims. Honestly, unless you believe in your team, best strat is have enough health/armor to run and grab all 3 pylons, let them down you, don‚Äôt release. Every time you are downed (but not killed), it‚Äôs 30 seconds of uninterrupted damage everyone can do to the imposter.
---
I had a rough fight that some level 48 spawned, not many people showed up, hell it was just us two for the first few minutes. I was trying to hold 2 pylons as well as tank AND dps the sheepsquatch. I am a HW/PA build and I‚Äôve got a tank perk set with t-51, but I‚Äôm also a bloodied build and holding 2 pylons is a large health drain... it wasn‚Äôt going great. Once some other people showed up and finally grabbed the pylons and I wasn‚Äôt having to take pylon damage, I was able to drop her in a minute or so.
---
Yea it seems to take 5 to 10 times to FT these days , I try running for a little then FT, sometimes that works and sometimes not. Its Def broke tho. Even the stupid countdown timer stops itself before it hits 1 even with no enemies around, at least for me
---
Excaclty.
---
HAHA
---
Tamed pets will protect you from spawned enemies at your base. THEY ARE NOT COSMETIC.
---
I was reading and someone mentioned you can get plans for new meds? Anyone have a list or know what that's about?
---
4 is really excessive. I use 1 mule who is also my player vending store. If I do SBQ, I will bring the 2nd character sometimes so I can get more loot / prime receivers (main already learned them all and can't receive them anymore). I'm amazed they can run 4 to be honest. Even running 2 on my beast of a PC is a bit rough, and takes a lot of management.
---
That's an understatement.
---
It's a dope combat rifle perfect for a stealth build only way to get the level 50 version is crafting it but i'm a nub
---
melee bug that makes a whole class of characters almost unable to play?  "we are aware of the issue, we have no timeframe but hope to address it in a future patch"
---
free ATOM store topiary items?  FIXED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Enjoy!
---
No, that's what YOU'RE saying. Lol. I'M saying that as long as I see that we have 5+ higher level people, and if 10+ minutes have passed, then I'm initiating the event. If that much time has passed, your teammates- and my own- have plenty of time to join. I'm not gonna sit there and wait just because you want me to. If you don't like it, go do the event somewhere else. Not my problem if you get pissy cause I didn't play the way you want me to. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Ran into it a few times last night. Best I can tell, if there's no cost associated with the jump, it's not going to let you do it.
---
It should t be on 2 and 3 star legendaries only on the one stars.
---
My buddy got the stimpack diffuser plan, i got the formula p plan twice and the bear arm melee weapon plan once
---
You shouldn't be able to damage players during events. I've had it bug out on me a few times but you should be fine in adventure mode
---
*Anal [Bulk Screw]*
---
The Vertibot farming method made it super easy. 1 hour from level 1 to 60 on double exp weekend.
---
You could also server hop if someone started an event in a way that didn't please you.
---
Have you kept all 3 friendly creatures alive and beat the side quest while the event is active? Probably not because you would be praising the challenge instead. Also OP gear waters down your experience. Bethesda isn't going to make a dungeon in the game that caters to OP players, because that is stupid.
---
Agree!!!
---
Apparently the stimpak diffuser plan can drop so we can finish the medic tadpole badge! That's the only one I'm aware of
---
Ok guys it's not worth arguing with u since there are no arguments u have to bring. It's pointless discussing anything with you. Have fun in PvE u food builds!
---
Meh that‚Äôs a bit steep for me. Just got the leather coat the other day for 3500 and felt like I got taken. I‚Äôll just keep hopping now and then. Thanks anyway!! Would love the responder fireman uni too.
---
whut the f is someone doing naked and afk in the wastes?  if you hadnt done it, it would have happened anyway.  #noguilt
---
&gt; at piece of armor was on xbox I would have paid good money for it
---
No no no. Any 3 star wood armor becomes 1 star on next login. It's worth 3 scrip.
---
i server hopped thot dang robot with my friend for 2 hours, neither of us got it to show up!
---
Probably because you're screaming at someone on the internet?
---
What does the formula p do?
---
What do you plan on?
---
I gave up and snagged one from a vending machine.
---
They‚Äôre lame for sure. I could use the atoms but it‚Äôs just not worth the trouble to do most of the challenges
---
Most of them are easily obtainable by messaging people in game, posting an lfg on your respective system or checking here for others looking to complete them too.
---
90% of the game can be done solo. Heck, I didn't even see another player for my first 100 hours playing.
---
And ya, I kinda like the requirement to look at and do things in the game that you might not have done otherwise such as taking a pic naked in a nuke some. Tricky but fun to try it.
---
just go without clothing, it's a pretty skimpy bra and undies set on the girl, I've gotten cap tips for pole dancing on multiple occasions.
---
That's what I'm saying! OP doesn't seem to understand that they are not entitled and can server hop just like the rest of us ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'd server hop or just leave the event if we didn't have enough people or if there were any low levels, cause that's what a not crazy person would do lol
---
Another post about why wood armor should be removed and another person learning that some people actually use wood armor.
---
i made razorgrain, corn, and carrot soups last night on ps4 and when i consumed them they did increase both water and food like usual
---
hope you get it sorted!  i cant live without my soups!
---
Glad to hear you‚Äôre enjoying it! Keep it up and have a blast!
---
hehe me too, corn and carrot soups!
---
I look at it this way - I bring both of my characters to queen (but only if I am the one launching the nuke), and both are entirely capable of killing the queen. My main does (and I am not exaggerating) typically 80% of the damage to the queen. People don't optimize their builds and typically aren't contributing much in the way of damage. In other words, despite having 2 characters there, I am more than pulling my weight. If you want to leave a free queen kill on principle, that's up to you. I do get that not everyone pulls their weight though.
---
Do you still have this ?
---
Wym?
---
I also can't get one in the mire to register either :/
---
Nope neither
---
I had to babysit a couple players last night in there. They were both 100+ but getting destroyed by the large amounts of robots spawning. They'd go smack them with their deathclaws or whateve melee the other used and then frantically run through back to me while getting murdered. At first i thought it was xp sharing, but then i figured that they knew i could melt whatever they brought in 3 seconds or less...
---
Plus the low levels in there too... it was interesting.
---
I discovered a trick in my camp. Fast travel to it (I get stuck). Then click the map and fast travel to it again and it spawns me in a different/safe place.
---
&gt; Who are these people that cannot form their own opinions and have NEVER used a search engine?
---
Facebook/twitter users.
---
yes...
---
I sell plans
---
I have a 100% crash rate on xbox one x when trying to enter the new DLC area under Arktos Pharma.  When I press the elevator down button the game switches to the loading screen and then either locks up with a buzzing noise, or simply crashes the entire game application and puts me back at the main xbox window.
---
aaaaaaaaaaaand blocked
---
shhhh calm down kid, or mum will get angry and you wont play :P
---
I did and it is fixed for me as well. Another person reported it fixed too :)
---
I've literally never seen anything like a photo challenge (except in GTA). I've unlocked photo-modes, but never seen anything pop up with a "take a photo with xxx" challenge.
---
yep, i double-checked my search history to verify
---
That would be an amazing thing to randomly come across ü§£.
---
thats a lot of boobs
---
but school is for noobs. if he actually attended said school, then he, or she, might learn something. fo76 states 18+
---
n.b. .... he opened this box himself
---
Calm down there garbage can, it‚Äôs not the games fault
---
Thank you, I was hoping that was the case. I'll take it to the Pharmacy then.
---
Would you sell or trade for it ?
---
Hey you're right. Didn't notice that
---
My friend has also had a lot of trouble with invisible enemies. Mine are normally invisible when I first join but appear after a few seconds. I was having more trouble getting into the event than completing it - I had a random crash when someone tried to trade with me and also when a friend fast traveled to my location.
---
I do not run in. And things loaded absolutely fine 2 patches ago. It's not a loading issue if it works for the first 6 months then stops.
---
Awoooo!
---
If you don't mind farming the flux for the shells, prime receiver is best. 
---
Personaly I'd shoot for hardened, good damage and the ammo is easier to come by.
---
Don't forget your food :D
---
I have a TSE double barrel for sale that I got from Mnarmanurgh  (whatever her name is) in my vending machine
---
It was sold as a multiplayer game in which you can still do everything solo.
---
Yes, enter the build menu and pick it up.
---
Not only does it say it's 0% food when I craft it but it doesn't satiate hunger on the status bar either. Looks like I'll need to contact Beth if I'm the only one experiencing this.

No mammalogist if no mammaries

---
Sugar grove(fans, globes) and Charleston Herald(typewriters), and Tyler Fairgrounds(toy booths) will be your homes away from home for a while. Tag screws in your inventory as a wanted component, pick up absolutely everything that shows  magnifying glass, and forget about crafting handmades for a while. You'll be able to farm/save a couple hundred a day this way. 
---
It's how I got through unlocking the 42 crafting mods for the handmade. 
---
I have 680ish of the 756 total rifle/pistol/energy/heavy mods unlocked
---
If you are refering to my setup, i am on playstation, so uhm, it can handle games with better graphic... 
---
It is bethesda fault, they are still releasing not working content.
---
Maybe stop sorting by new, and being so self important
---
If you went to school maybe you could learn to make an understandable or cognizant argument.
---
Yep got one 2 says ago. (Unless THIS PATCH removed them but nothing stated anywhere regarding this.)
---
Did you really expect to do end game content completely by yourself :/ guess you missed the bug train where you could kill the SBQ by stacking bobbleheads etc. RIP
---
"someone made a base i don't like, get rid of it"
---
There is a few around the first town you enter from the Vault.

In the resort there with the pool, or at the diner area.

\*twatwaffle-like typing  detected\*
---
I only started playing a few weeks ago but it seems this game is far and away better than it was at launch so i think it is at least somewhat safe to hope they will make more QoL stuff. At least I am being optimistic and enjoying myself.
---
For fun I kill mole miners don't know why I find enjoyment in killing those abominations but I do
---
Took me 7 hours one day.
---
Kid... what level are you?
---
Ah yes I forgot, thank you.
---
Nice round up. 
---
I‚Äôm definitely in favor of improvements to the broadsider and other launchers. Durability and base damage needs help. 
---
Broadsider ammo situation makes no sense either. They could probably let the gun benefit from heavy gunner and demo expert in lieu of buffing the base damage. It‚Äôs such a novelty it wouldn‚Äôt be overpowered in the slightest but at least it‚Äôd be more usable
---
Yeah. That's what I bought. Fallout 4 has end-game content and you do it alone.
---
Walking from Gauley Mine worked for me after multiple crashes, too! Thanks! Now if I could just get some more people here...
---
How insecure about yourself are you?
---
Oh I love bases,
---
But bases which essentially are built within a world object not allowing people to kill them or see them until it's too late?   
---
Yeah naw fam. It's a base involving glitching/exploiting.
---
Fixed.
---
Hi guys. I'm Ryan. \*Hi Ryan\* and I'm addicted to running Whitesprings.

It‚Äôs hit and miss but ya not really mate. I do buy all maps but Forest thoe. Also VE Weapons I don‚Äôt have. Cheers mate

‚ÄúI got sniped and now I‚Äôm pissed‚Äù
---
You got what you wanted now.
---
We're not allowed to do trades in here anymore afaik (rule #10). And we're also not allowed to link to trading subreddit, because the mods don't like eachother (mommy and daddy fighting). But you should google a 'fallout 76 market'.
---
Wow, you want measure dicks? Cool. I thought we are discussing how developers fucked up again.
---
When you get so angry that you type with your fists.
---
Its not the way i want to do it, its what should be done if you intend to 100% the event. I was able to do so once last night with about 10 people. You get new super rare plans out of it so unless you just want the legendary drop from the alpha its better to wait.
---
I had a camp in the mire by the crashed plane/waterfall that always spawned two of them
---
I‚Äôm with you.  
---
I‚Äôve gotten into a groove of taking workshops just for the plans and making runs for armor and weapons plans for my shop.  It‚Äôs plans that bring in the customers since I‚Äôm way out in the Mire.  
---
I also finally started buying serum recipes.  The first was the hardest.  With vending, in addition to maxing out your caps for the day at a single vendor, I‚Äôve quickly bought two more and an about to buy my 4th.  So gathering flux has become a thing to support the Serum part of my business.  My goal is to acquire them all. 
---
There was a player on here who was planning on starting a construction team.  I‚Äôm thinking about joining them [PS4].  The wasteland desperately needs a set of really good renovators to turn shacks into homes.
---
I love my BE Lever too - took ages to get it and now you'll have to pry it off my dead corpse to get it out of my hands :U 
---
But my personal favorites are my Deathclaw Gauntlet - it's always been my favorite weapon and my friend gifted me a couple months ago with a Bloody  / Swingspeed / 1 strength gauntlet and its' my baby! 
---
And I got myself a Bloody / Swingspeed bowie knife that I use all the time because it's SO FAST
---
Let them down vote if they want. Its nicer to help people, thats what this reddit is for. Helping new and old players, and discussing anything 76 as long as its within the rules. Some people on here need to read them again.
---
Okay thanks for that
---
Will check out that spot!
---
You forgot the sidequest given by the Mr Handy to override the main computer.
---
Ditto with selling items for caps to the robot vendors.  I mean I like algebra, I just don't want to take the time before spam selling to the vendors.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm new a just got on here two days ago
---
I think increase charisma +5 something else +3 and better gun accuracy for 5 minutes
---
Well I‚Äôm just trying to say if you‚Äôre a fucking level 25 fighting a level 100 it‚Äôs not the games fault you can‚Äôt defend yourself you fucking idiot. It‚Äôs fucking sad you‚Äôre gonna complain about the game, maybe get a life and stop complaining you fucking stupid cunt
---
You should also get the faster swing perk and fly like the freaking wind with your knife!
---
I loved my one star bloody handmade - such a fun weapon to pick things off with.
---
np man, just trying to point you in the right direction =).
---
Didn‚Äôt think the fogcrawler was that bad. Maybe I‚Äôll be more afraid for the frog crawler. Sounds intense!!!
---
Was thinking the same thing, been getting TSE, ME, AAE radiums, handmade, shotguns. 
---
3* it's all garbage. 
---
Armor has been back and forth though.
---
I went w/ 3* at first but didn‚Äôt get anything I could really use. Since I have terrible luck finding legendaries in my game play I‚Äôm switching to 2 *. More ‚Äúrolls‚Äù at the Purveyor seems better.
---
Doesn't have to be a lot just we should get more then just basic easy to get junk from scrapping particularly when using a perk.
---
Yea if someone else initiates it, i wait for them to start, if i don‚Äôt like the group (levels or builds) then i move along, i don‚Äôt hijack someone else‚Äôs event. There are plenty of servers to hop to.
---
That‚Äôs how every online/multiplayer game is...nit just Fallout 76
---
I sell em for 5
---
But fallout 4 isn't a multiplayer game now is it c:
---
I don't pvp. however, if I were a sniper, guess where i'd be.
---
now if there was a stratigic, tactical,territorial,defensible reason to open fire on another player............................................................................................................
---
I think u forgot... DISABLE the robots
---
Yes. It was part of the completion reward, not a drop from the boss.
---
One got a random invite when I was in Whitesprings Lobby, that I accepted, and immediately heard a shrill 10 is year old voice...WHATSSS UPPPP DDUUUUDEEE!
---
I left.
---
1. I have life. 2. I am level 230 and other content is no problem (imposter sheepsquatch will kill me, but it will take him while). 3. Yeah i complain here, because it will eventualy end up at devs, "feedback" little agresive, but i have reasons.
---
Where u can cook outside of the flatwoods church
---
Actually no, I personally have found someone using the base by the name of BrentLK, I ran up to the base and killed him and his friends, but I realised quickly from talking to him and others in the community, his base was built into the roof via glitching (Since you can use objects like chairs/workbenches to travel into walls and using foundations+stairs you can make a floor and badabing).   
---
I can accept being sniped since I snipe as well. I just dislike being sniped from a location where I have no feasible defense and they are using a fault in the game engine to create somewhere where they can see me a mile off, line a shot then shoot me without me being able to do the same (since when you're in a wall you can see out, but others can't see you).   
---
You trolls can sit here making this out to be "THIS GUY IS HACKUSATING" and I am one of the biggest anti-hackusaters going around, I know for a fact this is one of those, infact I can go in game right now, grab a clip of someone using this base and show you if you want?
---
Man you didn't need to do him like thatüòÇ
---
But if you sell one or less then 1‚Äî-&gt; .9 of a cap ?
---
You can, as long as you shoot it. You can still damage it even if you're defending the animal.
---
 Get your kid off my video games lawn
---
Love it! Hahaha
---
But the parents don't care one bit. That's the issue. GTA V 10 year olds and the same in other games is entirely the fault of parents without good morals.
---
This. Exact. Thing.
---
Sugar grove is my go to for springs. 
---
Not bad for screws either but I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a better place for those... if you know of one let me know
---
Survival is difficult for this reason. Instead of getting mad, get even. Throw orbital strikes on him or better yet, find his base and drop a nuke on his ass. I hate exploiters too but to be honest he's just taking advantage of something he found out. So if I were you, which I have been in this situation numerous times, I'd just get even.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
You have to 100% the event and everyone on here only cares about killing the alpha and not actually trying to fully complete the event. Its so difficult to explain that in a way that doesn‚Äôt somehow piss people off.
---
Oh god how I wish...life was so much simpler living at home with no bills. I stopped being one of those when I was 17 and thought being an adult would be so much more fun...boy was I wrong!  But life has been very good to me, so I can‚Äôt complain. But thank you for making me long for the good ole days üòÅ
---
Sounds fair to me. After all I'm not trying to rip people off, I just genuinely don't want them and figured I'd try and get something for it.
---
I know what I'm doing next time I play.
---
are you on pc? i¬¥d be interrested in buying it.
---
ltp
---
That doesn't complete it.
---
You have to find it in the world.
---
Player vending isn't counted.
---
Same with magazines.
---
It has been complained about since I've joined the community. They don't give a shit.
---
There is a bobblehead for that, however I believe it only lasts for 1 hour.
---
The clear solution to this is to add scorch-beast bone armor to the game, and you need scorch beast bones and body parts to craft and maintain this new powerful armor. We should also be able to add legendary mods (with a lot of difficulty) to crafted armor and weapons. The mods to add legendary traits to crafted armor and weapons should be just as rare if not more rare than legendary drops themselves, but it should at least be an option.
---
Flatwoods cooking station area and just up the road where the gym is near FLatwoods, around the other side by the car.
---
wah-wah wee -wah!   that is dedication!  did you have a friend hold it while you took turns leaving/returning to game to get the vendor to re-roll its loot table? or did you just server hop by yourself at the train station?
---
He will eat you for making fun of him. In your dreams.
---
I've also seen some groups like that on XBox that will build bases for you! I've always wanted to try it out but I'm just scared I won't like it and I don't wanna be rude / step on toes trying to direct people to figure out what I want - but I'm also not like a master builder either. I've got a more raider/ shit shack kind of touch haha
---
And I've been slowly trying to buy the serum plans over time too - I ultimately want to know all of the plans that I can - with the exception with some of the like weapon mod plans that I will most likely never use you know? But I have heard you can now buy some X01 mod plans from the Enclave so I really need to take a stroll on down there and check it out soon.
---
For real. The ceiling for the amount of power needed to sufficiently steam roll most of the game is honestly very low. While its neat to feel like you're doing 3/4 of the damage on the SBQ allowing everyone else to leech, it's really not needed. I've got a TSE handmade. Havent used it. Still prefer energy weapons and such for the pewpewpew factor
---
Green Country Lodge by Flatwoods has one.
---
It also alters your spawn point.
---
The challenges don't pop up unless you complete one or if you finish a requirement on a tracked challenge. They are listed under the menu from the Map screen.
---
I wish they could be checked from the Pipboy. Opening the challenges from the map every time to check progress on challenges is annoying.
---
This. Not naturally rare- naturally unobtainable. Only originally gained through ‚Äúcheats‚Äù. (I say originally because you might get one via trade, but the source was originally a cheat).
---
Try to fast travel. Wiggle a bit. Retry fast travel. Wiggle a bit. Repeat ad nauseam.
---
It's not, this guy is probably just one of the types that normally tag the boss and hide but failed to do so on this fight.
---
No, not often.   
---
Only when you have Pacifist off in Adventure mode, or are in PvP mode, or within the confines of a workshop that you have taken over.  
---
Otherwise, you just ignore them and they get bored and go away.   
---
I had a similar thing happen before the patch to limit workshop PvP.  Only, for me, they didn‚Äôt even wait for me to exit out of the vendor.
---
Gotta catch some noses
---
If nukacrypt doesn‚Äôt have it I highly doubt it‚Äôs been cracked.
---
Don‚Äôt see it every night but it happens. Anyone trying to get you fight in adventure mode is just setting you up in some way. 
---
As a low lvl you won‚Äôt be much of a cap target. More profit to gank higher lvl players  
---
I would also advise not taking any workshops till you fully understand the risks and how to avoid them. Raiders will fuck with you just because its fun.  Good luck.
---
Or have it respond with a canned answer and lock the post.
---
"Yes it is greatly improved, has a robust player presence, bugs are few, etc. Thank you for your query, we see this many times a day, please search on the topic for detailed responses."
---
People say it's easier to get the bot up near Lady Janet's Soft Serve. I've been casually grinding (not server hopping but going there every now and then) and still haven't found it at either location.
---
Just go to the the food preparation area near the church at the start of the game. There is always one or two there, it's the easiest of all the non-hostile animals to find.
---
Hating on the speakers.
---
If my experience is any indicator, it may have? I don't think other players can engage you in PvP until level 5 since one of the patches. I'm either level 10 or 12 now ( haven't picked my perks yet so I haven't been counting ), and have run across players of all levels 5, 10, 25, 60+ etc.
---
Pre level 5 I was able to team up with other chatty low levels who happened to be going after the same overseer's quests.
---
Since then no one has bothered to shoot at me yet, though most don't seem to talk either and just use the wave emote as they continue on their merry way. Have completed the 'feed the people' and 'fertile soil' events several times with 1-2 other random players who were in the area.
---
I haven't yet but I've heard a few people have.
---
They are so abundant thought? I always have 100 some how
---
I did i landed some shots, but they weren't killing blows but then i went down and some random ninja looted the sheepsquatch and all i was able to get was some meat, and the event completed loot which was some water,health items and a lab coat.
---
I sell them at 10 caps no matter how full
---
This is what I love about the Fallout series...!
---
Good. Ive seen plenty in the flatwoods area, specifically around the motel and on the outskirts of town
---
 There's nothing worth picking. I unslotted my perks long ago.
---
Ones in a pot with tato and the others got a knife?
---
I don't know what level you are, but once I reached around level 60 I never had to worry about bobby pins again. I'm sitting on 300+ of them currently and I use them often.
---
Really? I usually have over 100 Bibby Pins on me at any given time. Never have come close to running out
---
U have to give it a second
---
Not always. Its determined by the initial placement.
---
I moved mine and it worked once then back to the first placement spot.
---
Look at you guys, what a beautiful comunity.
---
A'thank ya
---
Maybe as a player base we should start taking some of this responsibility. We can't exactly report kids but there needs to be some way letting the parents know what they are doing.
---
While all of us can say "make it stop", until these parents realize what they're doing it won't.
---
No. They are reminding me how enjoyable this game actually is.
---
Reminds me of one scene from Far Cry 3.
---
Who's crying? Sounds like you are. Nice attempt to troll though. Move along.
---
Yes.  The enclave vendor sells the plans for the X-01 armor mods.  They are expensive though.  
---
I want the plans to build the T-60 PA but the only place that I have gotten drops have been from treasure maps.
---
I have all melee cards maxed
---
I used mine all last night sorry that‚Äôs happening to you
---
I got a weapon that I honestly believe to be much better than any TSE in the game, Bloodied Explosive Harpoon Gun, the best choice for a sniper rifle on heavy guns oriented builds, quick reload the dragon on steroids.
---
Haven't even found the camera yet so I have no daily or weekly challenges. Even stuck at the booze challenges. Oh and the nukes crashes.
---
Fast traveling to the location you're already at it seems to fix it
---
Would be more into pvp if legendary effects were disabled in survival mode.
---
Also power armor should be the best defense, but restrict mobility.
---
Says the one who swears in his postüòÇ
---
Basically wont happen. A mod even commented here on reddit saying it was a real pain the ass. Takes a whole lot of licensing work. Not only for the rights in general, but the time frame of use.
---
Could it happen?... yes... but considering the current priorities of getting new content out, I doubt they have man power devoted to that legal slog.
---
Vats a long time, stealth to, they always see me even when crouched and with my silenced sniper. So my build is useless, as I'm also meele build.
---
An instigating pool cue with 40% faster swing speed isn't that bad...
---
Nice! I'm working on getting a swing speed shovel right now and I can't wait.
---
If you're wanting a "safe space", maybe try an offline game?
---
Of course I am, have you ever been stoned as fuck chilling in game and a fucking 12 year old squeak comes out of know where and obliterates your high.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought. Wasted my time, but not my card. I'll hit Alpha now. They have the code for that.
---
Orbital strikes need a ridiculous boost. I can bathe in them.
---
Yeah I haven't yet bothered with the treasure maps really - my friend likes to do them but I can't be bothered just yet! 
---
I think the only ones I am really interested in are of course the calibrated shocks and maybe the tesla coil i think for the chest piece that makes you damage melee attackers.
---
Oh, is it? That's a sad news:(
---
attacks animals trying to kill it. which sucks if you got a rad roach, but is awesome if you got a deathclaw.
---
Read the edit.   
---
You'd find that if you had been in this situation you'd know all grenade types don't effect glitch bases (Because the explosive damage is stopped by floors/walls) and only a nuke works, which causes them to skip off.
---
Must suck to die by a frog crawler that highüòÇ I have no problem with them at level 125, well good luck with your personal problems. I mean you tried your best and that wasn‚Äôt good enough tho... oh well the communists in the game must have something to do with it huh
---
This is great stuff. Even some of the more minor things I‚Äôve posted about (pertaining to guns) you have mentioned here.   One (unimportant) thing I don‚Äôt see mentioned is that while trying to use an ultracite laser rifle in power armor, if you are in 3rd person, instead of firing you just juke your arms around a bunch instead of actually shooting. This is ‚Äúfixed ‚Äúby being in first person, where you can then fire as normal, or (to my recollection) not being in power armor.
---
parents.. the worst...
---
It maybe just needs a prompt like dropping/selling favourite items? 'you are about to scrap your bulk items, are you sure you want to do this?' then you can back out and stash it before it's too late, or give it the same protection as the few items you have to scrap manually
---
Which is also an exploit? you'd go that low huh? Shows what kind of scummy PvE player you are fufufu.
---
and your animal you are guarding attacks. which sucks if you got a rad roach or bloat fly.but awesome if you got a deathclaw
---
DAMN. I need the Enclave backpack skin.
---
I couldn‚Äôt travel to an event at all. I tried and nothing. Backed out and waited, tried again still nothing. Had to travel on a friend and hope it put me in it as I started doing event stuff
---
&gt; Took me weeks to get enough for a three star weapon.
---
What?  I can easily grind more legendaries (on xbox) in one night than I can exchange for script.
---
I think you can only have 1 chem buff at a time.
---
All rifles work with Rifleman, that's the point of rifleman.
---
Maybe you should stop, take a deep breath, do some jumping jacks, meditate, count to 100, anything really, before posting again.
---
yeah that one
---
thats just bad luck. keep trying
---
Yes it's happening to a lot of people right now. 
---
A workaround that might work for you (worked for me and several others) to get into Arktos Pharma is to not fast travel there directly or click join event - instead travel to a nearby location (Gregs Mine Supply works best for me) and walk to the Pharma - since doing that I was able to successfully use the elevator and do the event. I hope it works for you!
---
I just play random Chinese singing videos on the mic till they get fed up and leave.
---
That's good to know!
---
For sure! There was another thread on that exact request I included.
---
Hah! Fool. I get all the salt I need just browsing this subreddit.
---
to be fair. I think his post is just to push everyones buttons.
---
but, he opened pandora's box, and the post comes across like a stupid child. I could be wrong, but thats the way it comes across. a bit like your reply, I can't tell if your being sarcastic or serious
---
I like the tv watching the tv's ;).
---
One of the best interactions I've had so far was with a 13 year old from the sticks. He would \*not\* stop talking and he was \*hilarious.\*
---
"omg a deer antler I love it! I love hunting do you hunt? Oh you live in a city? I wonder what it's like to live in a city. I live in a trailer. I like fishing too. Can you fish in this game? You can't? They should add fishing in this game. What do you think is over here? Hey look what I found! This is cool!"
---
He stopped playing a few months or so ago. I miss him.
---
This is almost genius. Jackie Chan singing videos here I come.
---
Thank you! I'll give it a try :)
---
Yeah, had a chameleon build. While"invisible" I was always shot at..wtf. I gave that up.
---
oh.... well that sucks.
---
 I've moved mine twice, and both times it fixed my problem.
---
wait what? did you reply to the wrong post????????????
---
wah-wah wee wah is Borats statement when he is amazed by something...
---
maybe take a second to think before you accuse someone of nonsense accusations, i was on your side with this geez
---
There is a way.. ESRB rating is supposed to tell parents what's age appropriate. 76 is rated M and the parents know that. There's really nothing the player base can do other then mute and move on. Unless you want to demand a strange child that you don't know go get there parents, and then as an anonymous person from the internet call them out as a bad parent. That will go badly for many reasons.
---
No problem! Good luck!
---
Wow I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre being downvoted. This is basically cheating if it‚Äôs impossible to fire back
---
This isn't my only looter shooter - I'm dividing my evenings between this, Warframe and Division 2. Slows down progression a little but also helps prevent burnout. I should have said "obtain" rather than grind, I misspoke there.
---
Gimme a shout bud! GT JaggersLips13
---
AA doesnt work on laser weapons, and it doesn't work on explosive weapons, making AAE energy guns the only possible combination where the prefix doesnt work - twice. Exterminators explosive laser rifle would be just as good, dude.
---
You tried to brag about your OP gear, and indeed explosive laser rifles are great. But it kinda waters down the bragging rights if you have the single worst explosive laser rifle combination in the game.
---
Prime starts to shine on Guns that don‚Äôt have hardened receivers, like heavy guns.  Everyone should have one prime gun for the queen of course.
---
Been trying for weeks to get them to change it... they are on day 34 in a row
---
Sorry I finished in game with a random. Thx anyways!
---
Radiation has mutated our hands into rock hard hammers of justice. 
---
That should satisfy your concerns.
---
I‚Äôll buy it off you for tree fiddy
---
Surprised Bethesda doesn't offer private servers for real money where we choose who joins and who doesn't, imagine how much money they would make.
---
You can also blow lootable corpses into oblivion. You might find some unhappy compadres?
---
This feels like what the terminal is for. It has automated alerts on it but so far I haven‚Äôt had anything pop up on it. It‚Äôs pretty much set up for it, I really hope they put it in soon! 
---
I also constantly check the map for events :)
---
I believe on Xbox One you can report players for being way too inexperienced, which is about the same as what you say. I wish there was an option for inappropriate age gamers.
---
The best part is when they start singing a garbage pop song.
---
I'd recommend the strength perk change to max out expert and master slugger. This will jump your melee dmg. 
---
There's also Party boy/girl which triples the effects of alcohol in Charisma. Pair that with whiskey for another +6 str.
---
I think this would be cool however who really only uses their fists?
---
Not being a native speaker I can't seem to conclude wheter I am being ripped-off or is it the deal of my life
---
"I'll show you a good fight. Keep you strong and quick,Yeeeeeeeessssssssss?"
---
There would realistically be other people looting and killing, friendly or not. You don't get to pick how everyone acts who plays in your game.
---
It's trolls dude and people misunderstanding.   
---
If you use one of these bases you cannot be fired upon until you step back "into the world", whilst inside you're essentially in a cocoon with invisible walls, you can see them, they can't see you. If they jump out then yeah, you can hit them but I've known many to throw grenades out of these bases (allowing them to hit people whilst being perfectly safe) or they'll simply find a spot their gun barrel will stick out of the ground enough to allow them to shoot and kill the opposing player, whilst keeping their hitbox within the walls/floors to protect from harm.
---
I had two missile turrets go missing. The wire was still there but no turret. I have a feeling they are still taking up camp budget.
---
Or hilariously.
---
Nah just joking have a nice day
---
maybe him prefers to play the game as intended...
---
Send me a msg when you are starting I'll join.. Dookiestorm
---
Today you face the prison of dwellerrrzz
---
For real - I use party chat alot and there's one guy that always ends up bringing his like little daughter to the chat and we always end up leaving after less than a couple minutes. It's irritating and rude as well - they don't even ask "is it ok if I bring someone underage into this all adult chat" they just invite her in and then we all suddenly have to cater to that? Sorry no -I just got off work and I wanna chill the fuck out. I don't wanna walk little Tina and Timmy thru every little thing and have to listen to you painfully parent over voicechat. If you're gonna play with your kids - do it on your own time.
---
Sleeping until you‚Äôre ‚Äúwell rested‚Äù (like, 90s?) gives you an XP bonus. If you haven‚Äôt left the vault yet, take a nap before you head out and have an xp boost out of the gate. 
---
Repairing weapons/armor takes the same amount of materials regardless of how damaged they are so if you‚Äôre short on materials you may as well wait to repair thins til they‚Äôre close to broken.
---
Dude you type like a China man trying to speak English, it's fucking hilarious.
---
Wow, you want measure dick haha. You want sore finger, (Salt and Vinegar).
---
Got the hunters longcoat from him on Monday.  PS4.
---
30 minutes? 10 minutes? Are you using leather armor and a pool cue?
---
did you include shutting down ARIC-4?
---
Yes, they do. Also, I‚Äôve had this issue since the game launched. Hope Bethesda reads this and patches it up.
---
I have a Suppressor's Lever, and I only headshot.  I haven't played since the latest patch, but especially with Gun Fu, I haven't had issues chain headshot killing one after another.
---
It was the coolest looking , nastiest death claw I‚Äôve yet run into.  
---
Level 91 scorched and whatever with a seriously bad attitude.  He ate three of the greenish scorchbeast that we‚Äôre terrorizing robots around the spawn point in ws, plus every damn robot that came within a yard of him with damn near one shots.
---
Took me a minute or so of chugging pots and laying into him to get him to submit and it didn‚Äôt help that he seemed to have a group of ghouls helping him.  He was a beast.
---
So what that is 345 est right..
---
that damn loch ness monster strikes again!
---
I spent all but 200 I had hoarded on 2* items, got nothing, then 200 on 3*, got godroll and quality junk. This means nothing,  but next time I'm gonna scout the server buying 1* to see what prefixes drop, jump servers until I find nice one then go 3*.
---
With fog clawler, alpha, boss, at new event? You sure?
---
My pie is 10k or bust! But yea I agree, greedy vendors are pretty much dismissed within seconds of me opening their shop. I sell mostly plans and they all go for 25 or 50 caps depending on the rarity. Ammo is 1c each for every type. And anything else (water/stims) go for just a bit more than npc shop so I can make a better profit.
---
At least they're better than the stupid alcohol challenges that have been around longer.
---
Hardened mass is in junk still is it just doesn't autoscrap when you scrap all but it still gets dropped on death
---
Maybe use a quote that is more know. Don't watch borat. Looks stupid to me. So wah wah wee wah sounds like whining.
---
If that was wrong, my bad. Maybe be a little more clear I'm your statement.
---
Great info, thanks. Now I just need the plan for a "Friend" is that a drop from the new event?
---
I believe that there is a fine line between realism and annoying. For example rdr2 has you having to eat and maybe drink, but not your horse. That would be annoying af and would take away from the overall feeling and atmosphere of the game. You can punch a robot 4 million times because the last thing you want is to have your (often) last melee (or fighting) resort to be gone, that would be annoying af.
---
I wonder if, instead of looting their bag, you can open it and add more stuff in it?
---
It‚Äôs easy buddy... you just suck
---
Actually, he stated it was a frog clawler...
---
Wasn't rifleman fixed in the previous patch?
---
"See a fan, take a fan"
---
Me all day long.
---
Hmm. I'll try again. Maybe it was just a bug. Thanks.
---
what's that?
---
Judging from your general attitude, i hope they don't fix this and it continues to haunt you. Also, "fufufu" is cringy as fuck, go outside.
---
I dont open fire on another player without reason ....ever.
---
but that location or a church tower or similar, is where you would expect to find a sniper, and thats NOT an exploit. scummy if that is near a spawn point, yes, but thats where snipers live
---
damn it todd.
---
Just switch servers for now, I suppose.
---
I just made a rant about that this morn.. all that came of it people talking about the cost to Bethesda to run private servers... like they dont owe everyone who plays alittle something haha.. I'm joking before anyone gets there butt hurt
---
There's always at least two running around flatwoods!
---
is there a list anywhere on what the traveling merchants can sell?
---
Shooow me video how you fist him, i am waiting.
---
I referred to this as well
---
How was the game "intended" to be played, O-Oracle?
---
If you scroll down I made it like 4 hrs ago
---
They do still drop from the queen I believe
---
Thankies!
---
its ok, im sure there are no bad side effects from extreme violence on young impressionable minds.
---
i mean, look how great the U.S. is doing right now!   its not like there is an entire culture of violence!  everyone is calm and debates rationally online!
---
*preach*
---
It's also worth mentioning that r/ShouldIBuyThisGame very much exists
---
Excellent idea
---
Again read the edit.  
---
It's built INTO the building, not ONTO it. I wouldn't care if it was ON the building because I can destroy a base no problem.   
---
Also Edo you're a cool guy, please teach me to be as cool as you.
---
I keep reporting them and the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why this game got so much hate on release DAE tHiNk YoUtUbErS r DuMb‚Äù posts as meme posts. We‚Äôll see what happens.
---
holy crap i forgot about his singing career
---
Fine, I'll buy 30 fushion cores tonight when I get on! üòé I ran out recently or accidentally sold them, not sure what one.
---
Yup, I completely lost it at "frog clawler", good post!
---
Ok detective, When I say unarmed, I mean the unarmed class of weapons. Just a set of knuckles and I‚Äôm listed as doing 250 damage per shot. No chems just perks. 
---
Never checked bare fist damage. 
---
I only 1 hit the counselor from FULL health with a running attack. If she‚Äôs at 50% or less, pretty much any shot will send her right past the regen  phase and kill her
---
As I was walking through one of the normal doors into the Pharma.. I unintentionally peered into the void and so it peered into me .\_.
---
There‚Äôs a game called Destiny 1. In D1 there‚Äôs a repeatable dungeon-ish activity called The Prison Of Elders. You basically go from room to room killing different types of enemies until you get to the end &amp; claim your prize. It probably sounds pretty mundane but it‚Äôs a lot of fun.
---
Good luck guy in real life!
---
I've totally realized this *after* throwing the card in. At least you caught it before that!

Yeah, my knives also can be a problem as I have to kill stuff fast with them. Hi ho.

Yeah it's what I do tbh. It's just one of those stupid things they ignore.

Yep. Nothing worse than seeing AWOL Armaments, loading in and having 10 seconds to try to start it.

Can we get an opt in option as well?

Search "ping pang wing wang song". No Joke. Then make sure you have your audio in auto so even if not in a group they get to hear you. Wait till they fast travel back to their camp thinking they lost you, spot on the map, Daisycutter.

Some kid messaged me once, ‚ÄúHi my name is Ethan and I would REALLY like the hunters long coat you are selling (for 5k) but I currently don‚Äôt have caps. I was wondering if you would give it to me?‚Äù
---
If you read what they posted at all the context was very clear. Thats how reading works when you dont understand a word you look it up or use the context to understand how it's meant. So im not trying to be a dick but honestly The problem definitely was not them  maybe you should pause and actually take a few to read before you jump the gun.
---
wow
---
i bet you are fun at parties
---
I guess?
---
Are you in power armor?  Hop out of it before going down the elevator.
---
yes
---
2 shot is bugged with VATS. Gauss rifles tend to be wonky with VATS. Ammo is considered energy and heavy as balls (.10 each shot). Gauss rounds also track like crossbow bolts and can hit/get stuck in terrain. Ignoring 2 shot VATS issues, you will often see 95% chance to hit, and put 10 rounds into the dirt because of it.
---
Rifleman Perks affect it, but I am convinced the damage is energy based and falls under energy resistance instead of physical.
---
Where are the rabbits
---
That's Call of duty or Fortnite. Not fallout.
---
25% is fair. I've also gotten badges from the repeatables as well.
---
Ok thanks a lot, I‚Äôm glad I left then.
---
I would have no problem with this..
---
Hadrened Mass is still junk. It's just flagged to not auto-scrap now. As Bulk items were at launch but now for some reason aren't.
---
I believe so.

Between the Enclave Bunker and the Whitesprings Service Entrance!
---
New skin for backpack and more useless 3\* legendaries and this game is suddenly taking huge step to great direction? I would say Project paradise is a very small step for better direction. Its a little bit more interesting encounter than previous one, but still goes to category 5-7min of new content.

Of you don't exit the screen, you can buy the items back for the same costs. This let you adjust your pieces to maximize profits.
---
I my opinion there should be a limit of 3 mutations at a time and a potential to ether persons fly become a ghoul and super mutant which will both have positives and negatives instead of become a walking taking Tumour.
---
Idk what I was expecting, but I like it!
---
Ive done countless queen kills and have yet to see one.
---
Actually ya. You should come over sometime. Well have a blast as long as I get your references, lol.
---
Imagine hating something so much that you spend time posting about it on a forum that is dedicated to that thing.
---
thank you kind sir for defending my honor!  i guess im kind of dating myself, Borat did come out along time ago
---
Totally agree, I've come across it in numerous locations. For you fucking retards that don't understand and won't listen... What basically happens is players get inside the graphics, outside of the world, they can't be seen or fired upon, yet they can shoot out of certain crevices and throw grenades at you taking no damage themselves. It's a design flaw on Bethesda part, and it's being exploited by fucking cocks. Anyone against this post or my point of view are either using this exploit or were born out of wedlock in a test tube.
---
The past couple of weeks I noticed it seems common that a first shot or two at any foe often does nothing even if I‚Äôm quite close and the VATS % is over 90. It seems to have changed with the previous (not Arktos) update. 
---
Before that I noticed another strange thing fighting a swarm of robobrains: activate VATS shows &gt;90% chance pull the trigger and get a hit then the % immediate drops to the teens. Simply cycle in and out of VATS and the % goes straight to &gt;90% again. Had to do this on each of around 6 robobrains.
---
Yep. Said how its completely optional and how it can only be done during the feeding trough stage too
---
The fix that stopped weapon mods from autoscrapping broke this somehow. It should be an easy fix to just flag each bulk item the same way beer bottles or baseballs are flagged but they havent done it yet.
---
Lolllll my friends from Brussels. Would live this comment.
---
If you are in PA and not running a low health build, blocker isn‚Äôt as amazing as it seems. PA is already tanky as hell. 
---
Exceptions may be made for the boss mobs (imposter sheepsquatch, the new dungeon final boss) who melee hit very hard.
---
just read your edit. thought you couldn't build within existing structures ??
---
I haven't touched auto-scrap since the stupid bug repellent quest. It's so dumb.
---
That would be kinda cool
---
Yup. Part of being an adult, is accepting things you can't change. 
---
So what if a 10 year old is playing FO76? PvE isn't gory, it isn't over the top violence, there's no profanity, it's definately not overly sexualised pr pornographic. They paid for the same access the OP did, I'd rather help out an overeager 10 year old, than some crotchety entitled ass who thinks they can judge a parent for playing a PG game.
---
Judging by patch notes it should be fixed since patch 8!
---
I let my kid plays some games that maybe he shouldn't (not fo76) but even games for his age I make sure all incoming game mics are muted and he doesn't get a mic lol
---
A game may have a rating but even in something like plants vs zombies garden warfare 2 as a parent I keep in mind:
---
"Online Interactions Not Rated¬†by the ESRB"
---
Plus he is 5 he gets whiny no one wants to deal with that(I have to) and he don't need to hear what 12 year olds have been doing to his mother.
---
Yes, just re-did my camp last night and any I had I could replace.
---
Feel free to send me a message on Xbox - GT is the same - I am on most evenings after work and weekends are free! Good to hear that you are enjoying it!
---
I'm pretty sure it's a bear, since "Arktos" is Greek for "Bear"
---
They're a def check the box right now on console. We have 50 foto limit so end up deleting then anyway. No point in line up good shots lol
---
Yeah.. but.. I can see how using the map as a weapon is kind of cool/interesting. It adds this new element of discovery.
---
Occasionally it's nice to be misinformed! Thanks for checking.
---
Deathclaw Gauntlet, Power Fist, Super Sledge. And I guess you can make it four because I forgot about Grognak's.
---
Got one as a reward. Haven‚Äôt used it yet.
---
You can build into floors, walls and all sorts. There's a lot of glitch bases this just happens to be the newest. I can go in game right now, TP to a friend with this base and get a video which I'm tempted to do to kind of "Shut down" all the people on this thread who're talking smack.
---
just dont mod ur guns /s
---
That's 15 seconds of my life I'll never get back.  Great job.
---
Completely agree. That is all.
---
Amazing "tl:dr" questions deserve amazing answers. Anytime!
---
Good question. This deserves further examination.
---
I have 4 WWR pieces and bear arms. My fully modded Missile launcher weighs less than 2 lbs. I think armor reduced the full weight and not just the base weight. 
---
My 90% RW gamma gun with a deep dish and auto fire mod weighs 0.36 with my armor. Would likely be more if Armor was only base weight.
---
Lastly I was also looking at a plasma Gatling in someone‚Äôs vending machine with the 90% reduced weight legendary on it. It would‚Äôve weighed like .07 if I bought it. So that stacks too with the armor and bear arms
---
This just happened to me coming from Whitespring Station towards the Ghoul houses.
---
Was on my way to catch a frog, decided to cut through the houses to see if there were any legendaries...
---
Complete white screen when facing the Whitespring building and massive stuttering, but if i looked in a different direction then the game was fine
---
God dude why dnt you reread my last comment build a stuff animal and stop crying..
---
Build a camp in "thier" space...elaborate more
---
Use your words big fella lol
---
"I want something that moves around"
---
Compares the frog in a jar...

Great comparison *two thumbs up*
---
And i would not put it past you to have made separate accounts just to down another person's comment
---
Minty is the right word - it's spearmint to the max
---
I dont hate it, I own the game and played it quite a bit. I do have the ability to be honest about it though, and when I pull up reddit autocomplete usually loads me to this sub so I click on posts with interesting titles like this. It isnt a good game and it isnt something that should be recommended to most people but there are some types who could enjoy it. There are also types who were there from the beginning and hardened their resolve to love the game in spite of everyone calling all the flaws out to the point where they are ignorant to how bad it is because they are stuck in a mentality defending the game

But yeah this one is a fickle bastard at times.

The *golf* club

so my under the map base might still actually be there, legit.
---
And they have iron fist perk. With that equipped I can kill level 21 deathclaws in 6 or 7 punches. Anytime I'm in the forest I play unarmed. I still one hit everything in the forest just about. But dont waste ammo or resources repairing weapons.
---
r/titlegore
---
I know this post is 5 months old, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents in case anybody else finds this through the Googly.
---
From what I've read, the fire rate is supposed to be the number of rounds per 10 seconds.
---
I'm not sure if that's accurate, but it's definitely not correct for the Gatling gun. I think there may be an extra zero.
---
So instead of 500 rounds in 10 seconds, it should be 50. Or about 5 rounds per second.
---
I was looking it up because I got a Bloodied Gatling last night that does 500 damage with low health and current perks and thought it was crazy.
---
Fun fact, "Kilroy was Here" is [engraved on the National WWII Memorial](https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzQyMTgwMWJmN2U4YmIxMTE0MF9EU0MwNzk1OSBjb3B5LmpwZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwieDM5MD4iXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il1d/DSC07959%20copy.jpg) in Washington, D.C.
---
its rated M, and you can watch a enemies head explode if you VATS is.... that is not gory to you?
---
i was 20 something when FO 3 first came out, and even i thought the heads exploding so you see the eyeballs and brains splatter in slow motion with VATS was a bit too much
---
desensitization is a real thing, and is unfortunate, but almost unavoidable in todays world
---
To fill in for missing gear, mostly.
---
Like an almost full set of legendary combat armour, but a crafted arm.
---
The BOS Rifle is pretty good for a crafted weapon, especially at lower levels.
---
Things like that.
---
Hahaha yea I went the wrong way with the time.. embarrassed
---
And.. if you do it at Charleston Station, the vendor EXPLODES when another person spawns in.
---
:(
---
hang on a tick......you have a 'friend'......with this base???????????????
---
I foolishly assumed i could do what im asking lol and didn't think about that this time
---
Yes it's still sold by that vendor - the better place to farm for it is actually Janet's Soft serve above the vault by the turkey - you run down the road from janet's (kill the mobs) and passed the bus is the random spawn point - plus no one hardly ever builds their camp there - in fact i've never seen a camp there at all :D 
---
And instead of hopping off the server if he doesn't have it you should try to have someone hold him for you - and relog on them as the inventory changes every time you join the server - you just have to be careful as sometimes you will trigger other random spawns like mole rats or ghouls that will kill the bot if you don't get them fast enough (do not use explosive guns) 
---
Good luck getting your coat!
---
Stay away from Hornwright Industrial building dumbass
---
Update: If I move camp they reappear. So this is actually a bug.
---
I can't even build any more. Every patch makes things worse than before. My camp is automatically broken down into single floors with decoration.
---
I still can't build slanted walls on half walls.
---
I cry when I log in because my camp is broken...
---
Also if you log in AFTER a nuke has hit, it still trashes your camp.
---
And it charges me so much more to move than it says it will....
---
üò•üò•üò•
---
Go somewhere in the Forest, like Morgantown airport. Low level Scorched. Bashing seems to wear down durability faster than shooting.
---
put them in a bowl and pour milk on them?
---
Ok, maybe I forgot that part...
---
But if you don't pay for it where is the sense of pride and accomplishment?
---
Every 20 hours
---
Yes, overboard. Any intrusive unsolicited event like this serves as an immersion break
---
Im not saying don't have the option, I am saying add an option to opt out.
---
It should be optional. But hey if you wanna down vote player agency that is your perogative.
---
It doesn‚Äôt need to break... you know you can repair an item when it‚Äôs not broken right? Just shoot it a few times to get it under 100% then repair it and repeat
---
I'm pretty sure its same as the vendors. 20-22hrs. I'm almost positive.
---
thanks for the confirmation
---
Got as far as you insulting the readers and stopped. 
---
Please write a version that doesn‚Äôt seem to be as rude as I‚Äôd be interested in hearing about this. Many thanks.
---
oh, we didnt have that happen at all... i know sometimes at whitesprings ill see a robot just all of a sudden keel over and die for no apparent reason... maybe that happend to you?
---
sorry that happened to ya!
---
Yeah I will definitely wait a bit next time. Thanks for the response mate!
---
I‚Äôm now more frustrated with my self that I panicked and didn‚Äôt check the area haha üòÇ
---
I actually checked inside quick afterwards and the mobs had all spawned again but not fully ‚Äúawake‚Äù. They were just in their sleeping position and I could walk through them. And they were all there I assume but I couldn‚Äôt toggle them either. 
---
Maybe I hit the respawn time as well and made it glitchy with it disappearing at the same time
---
That's alright, I usually screw that up all the time, I think I just had a moment of clarity for some reason.
---
Just repair it after shooting a few arrows, the crossbow doesn‚Äôt need to be completely broken, it can be at 99%, then repair it
---
That's how Bethesda works ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
You‚Äôre correct about the Armor reducing the full weight of a weapon. My point on this thread was to point out that the 90% Reduced weight trait doesn‚Äôt do the same. Just the base weight of the weapon which is odd to me. It should be fixed because that legendary affect is not effective unless it requires minimal mods like a melee weapon would lets say.
---
If you're still going later on I'll have a few who will join ya
---
this bug is still in the game. lost the feral ghoul and wolf blood samples for whatever reason and the bethesda support is just sending me automated messages with walkthroughs and upcoming maintenance stuff. no message from a human yet after 2 weeks. at least it seems like i can progress the main story withouth finishing this quest, right?
---
still, something needs to be done about this terrible customer service and a quest bug that is in game since release i assume, that ruins a main quest!
---
Fast travel mats would help. Yes they likely could be used to trap players but that can happen in the current form.
---
I just wish for the moment players would realise that where they place the camp module initially is where visitors will spawn. Simply keep it there while you build and ensure visitors have a safe space to spawn. Its really fairly simple to do.
---
I know, it's just taking forever to get below cause the particular one I have is over 100%
---
 that is exactly why you posted and ended up sounding really lost you didn't read what they said you assumed. Context is a important part of reading comprehension learn the context before you jump it's easy. Dont try to blame others for your failure/ignorance in the end you have to learn from your mistakes.
---
Just message my GT and I'll message you when I'm on
---
Where's the bloodbug proboscis?
---
Wow. Your comprehension sucks.
---
If you don't understand these posts you never will. 
---
Have a good day.
---
On the rest of your assumptions... üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
---
Msg my gt
---
Msg gt
---
there are good people on both sides...
---
Yup, definitely 20 hours, just like the Vendorbots.
---
imho it's intended
---
we have no idea tho
---
I have done at least 50 queen fights haven't seen or heard of anyone getting recipes since they nerfed TSE.
---
This is the only good solution.
---
Exactly why I want it separate that way I pick who is in my game. Not the whole server just dungeons. Anytime a new dlc is released a flood of people start the mission, in some cases I like it cause it forces interaction, but in some cases it makes you rush thru a story or mission and doesn‚Äôt allow you to take your time immersing into the content
---
Yes, my first was a TSE Combat Shotgun that weighs 90% less.
---
Not wrong, but there are a lot of bug unfixed that could be considered an easy fix. A big point of the post is about communication on the issues though. A quick two sentence announcement stating "We're working on X but it's a complex issue. We expect it to be another another few weeks for inplementation." Would fix a lot of the negativity
---
I'm being sarcastic lol
---
Got some amazing drops off her the past week and got a TSE Bolt-Action Pipe yesterday! Lower rof than my Lever Action but after replacing my Evasive perk with three gunslingers I've got the damage up to the 360s.Not bad for a non-bloodied build.
---
Murmghs drops have been consistently good enough that I've mostly stopped bothering farming Whitesprings and Fakesquatch. Still pissed at how undeveloped her character and inclusion is though.
---
I HAVE TWO &lt;100% CROSSBOWS ON SALE IN MY VENDOR FOR 40 CAPS EACH
---
PSN zonkerbl mornings (5 am ish) and weekends
---
cool.
---
There is a quick play menu that has been datamined. Although it is likely connected to whatever Nuclear Winter ends up being (likely TDM, BR, or FFA).
---
Mind freakkkkkk
---
Funniest shit ever.
---
cool thanks
---
For me success rate has been around 50-60%, most of the losses come from no one helping collect feed. If im doing it by myself I can sometimes get just barely enough for 1 rank 2 pet if the server is able to spawn in the resource fast enough.
---
The other times I lose is because of all the crashes and freezes this event has lol
---
I saw a post earlier where someone was commenting on private servers - they were willing to pay 10-20 atoms per login...
---
&gt;if it was a monthly fee I wouldn't pay it.. it's not my fault they made a game that is cost so much to run
---
OK granted this was probably a middle school kid, but there is plenty of that mentality around.
---
I think they'll hold on to private servers until the game revenues have started to dry up, hoping to force a renaissance of popularity with the modding community.
---
I assume you run an unyielding set. If so, it's been bugged for some time, making you lose the buffs from your gear upon death and suddenly registering you as over-encumbered.
---
lol
---
You're making a good start. And im really happy the kid still enjoys it. 
---
But fallout was rated m for more than just the player interaction. 76 may be reasonably chill by fallout standards. The game is filled with dark and twisted things that I'm not sure a kid should be learning about via game. But I'm not a parent, so I'm not the best to judge. 
---
I mean you're not gonna let your kid play through the BioShock series. 
---
That being said though. I respect your choices as a parent. And taking away the mic is definitely appreciated more than you could realize. I hope your kid respects your rules and doesn't try to work around them.
---
Definitely.
---
We have never seen violence like this before.  It's not like there was a time where we took the whole family to watch women be burned as withces or public beheadings or anything.
---
Before video games, there was no war or violence if you ignore all the was and violence.
---
I remember how all the Israelites played GTA before they slaughtered all the Canaanite clans to the person.
---
Seems a lot of players have found the body somewhere else I see. 
---
Then maybe I could have gotten my furious handmade... damn my self üòÜ
---
also, I checked out the rest of your posts and comments on reddit and it actually doesn't look like it is worth getting back...
---
I thought I read way back when, that there would be fees for private servers.
---
The explosive prefix on any non explosive gun allows the use of both heavy gunner AND demo expert to work in increasing damage
---
Make sure not to have your gunsmith perk card on too.
---
To clarify for OP, it's not a global reset, it's 20 hours from the first time you put something into it.  If your first transaction was at 6pm last night, the machine will refill at 2pm today.
---
You can still use the perk card for non-explosive if it has a legendary explosive effect. You‚Äôre good man üëç
---
I drank Nukashine and ended up in this thread.  FML.
---
Or maybe just from the 2 and 3 star purchases....
---
Yea I‚Äôve froze twice down there. No hard crashes yet .
---
Lol it did and I'll be damned if I remembered that in the slightest until you said something. However I just dont like when people try to blame others for their obvious ignorance. That shit is arrogant as hell imho to not read what somebody said then blame them for their lack understanding.
---
Oh wait really. Well I need to get farming
---
Yep- happened to me a couple weeks ago, but it happened mid-trade for the second person, and I was able to still complete the purchase off the dead vendor bot. Super weird.
---
I can understand it on herbivore/carnivore. +50% of 0 is still 0. But for speed demon it should work by comparison.
---
sick burn bro!  I have no idea why noone wants to interact with you around here!
---
Oh so when it says not explosive it just means not the base is explosive? (RPG, grenade launcher, etc.)
---
HEAR YE HEAR YE!
---
If you are playing on adventure mode you could always just flip pacifist mode on before starting the event and turn it back off on completion.
---
I have serums for sale in my vendor, 500 caps each
---
I ran into it once. I had 2 machines not powered and one day i ran power to them. The next server i was on those 2 machines had everything in storage. But i unpowered them again with full inventorys and no issue.
---
It's like the mechanism that auto scraps junk for crafting cant be separated from the mechanism for scrap all at a workbenches. 
---
Iirc bulked junk wouldn't show up in your available to build junk so you would have to scrap them manually.
---
so you'd think
---
no atoms
---
The thing is, wood is never supposed to go 2 or 3 stars. Those are a fluke and that's why they revert to one. You'll be waiting till Fo76 goes offline.
---
Yeah, it just means that it doesn‚Äôt effect the missile launcher, far man, etc. An explosive .50 cal or Minigun for example is still usable with the perk
---
Use it to bash enemies instead of shooting them. It counts as a crossbow kill for the challenge and also wears the weapon down considerably faster.
---
Also, if you have any of those improved repair kits kicking around you can repair it to 150%, bash a couple things, and repeat. I was able to complete the challenge in a matter of minutes and found a use for those otherwise mostly useless things.
---
They should just buff the wood armor in some way so that we all stop hating getting it
---
since when can you not contest workshops? i stole one on sunday... did the patch change it?
---
or do you mean greifing by __not contesting__ and instead hit the button then chase the other player down from across the map?
---
from, someone who enjoys pve and pvp
---
Explosive bullets is just a legendary effect, it doesn't change the weapons type so a 50 cal would still be a non explosive heavy weapon with it and the perks remain the same. The only difference is with explosive demolition perks also work.
---
I pretty much always have parasites.
---
What does the diffuser do? Besides granting a scout badge
---
It would be lore friendly. Joshua Graham from FNV has a modern vest that says ‚ÄúSLCPD‚Äù on one side and ‚ÄúSWAT‚Äù on the other side.
---
Why don‚Äôt you go play a real pvp game? I don‚Äôt know why people think bunny hopping in one spot while shooting people with bugged weapons is more enjoyable than fighting other players in a game actually designed for pvp.
---
We killed the Alpha Fog Crawler yesterday and my "reward" was a DRILL.  It is unacceptable that that weapon is still in the legendary loot tables!
---
Yea, lets all play with our third-best gear because anything in the (end)game is too easy, right?
---
Characters are saved serverside. Just reinstall and it‚Äôll download your data and you‚Äôll be set.
---
I've had it happen once, but I'm not sure what caused it so I'm not sure how to repeat. I'm also not looking forward to restocking 120 items, so I hope it doesn't occur again.
---
Nah.  Sounds legit.
---
10 -15 minutes is ample time to get your shit together. I don‚Äôt see this as a outrageous request. Like you said it only takes around 10 minutes to complete
---
IMO - make yourself some caps, stick on the travel agent perk, and go shopping.  There's a ton of nothing out there, but every once in a while you'll find someone selling something just this side of greatness for very few caps.
---
I picked up a sick shotty last night, I think it was quad ammo capacity, explosive, and faster reload.  Level 45, 550 caps.  Your odds of finding a decent item for sale is better than finding one in the wild.  (FWIW, it's possible, but you probably won't find something quite that good or cheap, but certainly something almost as good).
---
All these building restrictions do is curb creativity and open it up to being broken every patch. They need to lift them entirely.
---
ha I was thinking the same thing. god life is good
---
What was it called? I'm still looking myself.
---
Yep. my vampire's explosive .50 cal deals about 117 damage with heavy gunner, demo expert and bloody mess. Non bloodied build
---
If only we could color the army helmet black :\
---
A good idea for that. Thanks.
---
People need these posts!  How will they make up their minds if we don't tell them what to do?  What are they going to research gameplay on Twitch and YouTube or something?  That's just crazy man!  /S
---
Seriously, these posts are super annoying.  I waited and watched hours of Oxhorn playing before I bought it.  He never once said to buy it and I made that decision myself.  Don't be lazy, research it yourself.
---
right, my bad, 20% indeed

so if there's a 20% cap that would explain why it doesn't seem to stack with speed demon
---
False - character data is NOT local. They‚Äôre own page says this error is fixable with a reinstall that won‚Äôt delete characters. Persistent MMOS save server side not locally
---
I let my 5 year talk on the mic (area chat) it really screws with people when I one shot mobs at White Spring during a nuke or when I go 25-8 on call of duty. On a side note he really enjoyed walking in the Fasnacht Parade he would constantly ask every player " is that you uncle xXxX it's me xXxX " 
---
I would never let him play this game without supervision ( parade only) he is locked out of it and other games by age restriction on the Ps4 until he figures out dad's profile has the good games.
---
Unfortunately the answers move portions so the spreadsheet is useless
---
No, you like Juicehead video's, not Juicehead2 (fake, fan, w.e)
---
or just go to events and chat people up. most folks are damn friendly.
---
That's strange as long as you tag the legendary you should get the loot from it other people can't take your loot I thought.
---
Yeah well I just hit 20k today actually! Might be a priority now. I have spend SO much time in settlement üòÜ
---
&gt;However, with escape artist, one of the benefits of this perk is that running no longer negatively affects stealth, which means you gain no penalty from moving around at full speed in sneaking mode, which also probably means whatever benefit of muffled offered is probably no longer useful, since you're already as quiet as you'll be with that perk regardless of the weight of your armor.
---
Are you sure Escape Artist works this way? That is the way I read it to mean but I have not gotten any confirmation or concensus. I have a thread of my own from a month ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgipmj/does\_escape\_artist\_eliminate\_the\_need\_for\_other/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgipmj/does_escape_artist_eliminate_the_need_for_other/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about this subject that got very little constructive comments and no clarification. If what you say is true, then I would love to move my two perk points from Sturdy Frame, back to rank 3 of both Critical Savvy and Better Criticals.  I hope I'm not high jacking a thread but I would really appreciate clarification on this subject. Anyone? Anyone?
---
this is what is called a false equivalency
---
I'm pretty sure you can only have one active bag at a time.
---
Did they add it to the vending machines?
---
I'm on PC, if you want to add me feel free :) user is the same as on here.
---
Someone created this checklist. There's a tab for each rank:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bh5jIfHRQI_iE906EN8LcGTJib-Bei_CJE2h5HXB3dI/edit#gid=1386834576
---
Thanks, he watches me play fallout 76. I'm lucky he is pretty mature in the sense he knows its just a game. I always drive that home. There are other games he doesn't get to see like friday 13th too gruesome. He would know it's just a game but the imagery is concerning. Plenty of time for gore when he is older.
---
Your rant was well placed however so many kids playing or seeing games they shouldn't, and interacting with complete strangers online hearing any number of things you shouldn't want them hearing.
---
I keep his online interaction censored
---
I drive home games are for fun and if he gets upset it goes off or he plays a different game.
---
And just as important any imagery he sees regardless we remind him just like tv shows its fake and not real life.
---
Hopefully in roughly 10 years he can join me in the wasteland :)
---
Heavy leather plans you get from Responder vendors. Heavy combat plans from Free States vendors: Harper's Ferry and Watoga Station. Trapper, robot, marine and metal plans are world spawns only, while raider plans are essentially impossible to acquire.
---
The whole Savage Divide region is level-scaled to max, so if there's a higher level player nearby then you're likely to run into high-level enemies. Makes Top of the World and Whitesprings extremely dangerous.
---
Considering everything we have to put up with just to play the game....
---
I realized this weekend that this was happening. The weight crunch hit hard and I was panicking to offload weight and was bulking everything. Used up all my plastic and found some duct tape en route to the vendor. Wanted to scrap what I found and then went from being under weight to over encumbered....even I think its dumb
---
Despawns. So instead of doing lots of little poops, hold them in till you find the best time to burst. ;)
---
Sure it has a guaranteed 3 star boss... but I still got a 1 star nocturnal boxing glove as my reward
---
I think the Fallout 4 one looked awful. They were wearing a permanently open riot helm with what looked like a car seat cover. The ones from FO3 and FNV I thought looked pretty cool though.
---
But at the same time I have this weird thing of me just earning everything myself. I‚Äôm odd that way :P
---
m8, carnivores aren't supposed to eat cranberries
---
There‚Äôs a dirty version but I can‚Äôt see any difference :\
---
Don‚Äôt forget Brotherhood fatigues, I think it‚Äôs the best combo!
---
It wouldn't even be a difficult fix... Just make bulk junk go into the misc category or a new one of its own. Easy.
---
If you keep all 3 friendlies alive you have a much better chance of getting the new rare plans like stimpack diffuser and the new bear skull melee weapon plan so would rather spend the time to wait and get a good group rather than do it quickly for the legendary drop from the alpha. Just my opinion.
---
What level are you?
---
Rat farts.
---
Its more like bear head
---
Appreciate the help!
---
Well the dirty version has slightly more dirt and a more visible band around it. Might give this outfit a try though
---
None of my doors are locked. Jag-off
---
The game has as many bugs and crashes as when it came out.
---
Recommend
---
He will die.
---
Right- that‚Äôs 100% what I was saying. But I‚Äôm pretty sure hiding up on the electrical tresses you referenced is still inside the bounds, so if you idle there, you‚Äôre open to attack. I just walk over to the Charleston station and jump up on the roof usually. Works pretty well to avoid pvp and pve.
---
There's 5 animals I won't kill:
---
Possums
---
Beavers
---
Frogs
---
Squirrels 
---
Cats
---
Lol cool, I'll make sure I'm proper constipated before I unleash in that case
---
Don't forget YouTubers. I'll never understand having to be given an opinion on something rather than coming to it on your own.
---
Me and my team were doing this event with another team. My team were all talking to each other, relaying information. The other team was all in one room whilst my team split into two teams of two.
---
My team's troughs weren't filled as much as theirs since they had 4 people doing it. And they got a rank 2 Yao Guai to defend. I thought "4 of them, they should be fine." Then, I noticed the Yao Guai's health dropping quickly. WTF was happening?! There were four of them there a minute ago, what was going on? Then, one of them ran into the room I was in. The Yao Guai then died.
---
As soon as the "defend the animal" part of the event started, they all decided to abandon the animal and let it die.
---
Just... DEFEND THE DAMN ANIMAL! Don't abandon it, keep watch of it. A team of four people should have been able to defend a Yao Guai with ease. But nope, they decided to just run away and leave it to die.
---
Another time, another guy who started the event then proceeded to stand on top of one of the troughs and shoot the occasional enemy whilst I did all the work. Occasionally, I would just stop, look at him and do the angry emote. He didn't get what message i was trying to convey there apparently.
---
And the amount of times I've had to run to another room full of people and collect food because they're too incapable of doing so... urgh. It feels like me and my friends are the only ones who know what they're doing with this event.
---
I would rather craft annoying amounts alcohol by myself than not even be able to complete the challenges altogether
---
Ok
---
I still have all of mine. I was worried about picking one up and trying to move it and then it not allowing me to, but even that seems fine. Can even store it and place it down from there too.
---
What's wrong with it?
---
Trolling his dad, I'd say you raised him quite well
---
I did this one easy
---
What about foxes and rabbits!?
---
If there‚Äôs atoms I‚Äôm down
---
They... the even nake me to scrap my sweet little teddy bears...
---
 Bethesda, you..You Monster !
---
Again, he used a quote that is not well know. Even reading it sounds like he's saying I'm whining about 7 hours and then offered an idea how to improve the turn around rate.
---
Unless you know borat, you don't know wah wah is a quote of surprise. Maybe put a disclaimer when using vague quotes to help with understanding the reference.
---
Have a wonderful day you helpful people. üòò
---
Bring lube for the a$$ rape....... and lots of stimpaks.
---
Nuking on xbox?
---
Yeah you‚Äôre spot on with that. I agree it should work the same way as armor.
---
Kinda ridiculous that a 90% RW handmade can still weigh close to 20 lbs after mods.
---
The effect seems like it‚Äôs only really useful on weapons without any mod options to begin with, or ones where the mods don‚Äôt really add anything and you can afford to keep it standard.
---
Get munching on that Razorgrain!!
---
I just found a drill last night. Thought it was cool so i kept it like my chainsaw. Only does 6 dmg but still. I'm hoping to build a shitty shack down in the cranberry. When vault dwellers travel down there. I was gonna come out from behind trees with the chainsaw and horror mask. Lol. Good times.
---
It's probably not intended, just hasn't had enough publicity yet. They finally fixed Grounded a couple of patches back.
---
My first legendary weapon purchase from the Purveyor netted me a TSE Assault Rifle, can't remember the third star though. I popped it in my stash so that I could figure out what to do with it some other time.
---
My next three purchases were for 3 star armor. Each and every one had a very good roll of some kind. Assassin's Sentinel chest, Unyielding Sentinel left leg, and a Weightless Cavalier's left arm. All of those pieces were ***wood armor***! I couldn't even drop them back in the machine since I had hit scrip cap before buying. :(
---
Wow no need to be a dick i'm trying to help...
---
Wow, I cant even find a youtube video on that!!!!!
---
Wonder if particular silos match with particular launch computers
---
Do you know if there's a smaller chance to unlock a mod as you unlock others? Or is it like a 50% chance to unlock an unknown random mod each time?
---
They were purposely removed from the queen's loot table in one of the earlier patches. Only available from the enclave vendor, legacy players, or dupers.
---
I also found a 3* four times down in the basement all by himself. I agree with you. I‚Äôll wait till we have more people, burn through it and then sneak downstairs real fast. Got a aae.45 from one last night. Patience is key sometimes
---
Maybe the alert could flash on the screen with the loud Inception sound. 
---
BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
have you heard of Dune worms? yeah, like that, but radworms. It is said that when contracted, tiny radworms slowly eat you from the inside out. Once there's no longer enough of the host left to sustain them, they battle each other to the death. So, instead of a butterfly, out pops a human-sized radworm. Then it goes on to devour all in its path.
---
The reason this outcome doesn't happen often is they quickly die when outside of radiation. Radaway can also be effective.
---
That‚Äôs absolutely crazy. Thank you for checking!
---
Oh, yeah, that reminds me, I must go to youtube click on something Google thinks I should see then click on something in the sidebar.
---
I'll never need to make a decision or have an independent opinion ever again.  Thanks Sergei!
---
Yup exactly. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs effective as a melee option due to the fact they only require one mod. My RW handmade weighs over 15lbs lol. Just not right
---
The context is extremely clear your just ignorant and arrogant to fail in seeing your mistake but have a good day I dont like arguing on here especially with ignorant people.
---
It‚Äôs +50%
---
Wait, there is? Where?
---
https://youtu.be/f_z3mByOutE
---
like the -50% damage one or whatever it is &gt;:/
---
And can we please please bulk every type of scrap. Some can be sold without being bulked, so that's not an issue. I don't understand why we can't bulk everything for clearer inventory purposes.
---
It will guard the assaultron head and sheep squatch stuff but how dare you think it should block the item intentionally packed together to make it weigh less or sell
---
On the cliffs across the bridge from Harper‚Äôs Ferry.
---
Oh, and offense isn't up to the person speaking.
---
Feeling offended is up to the person receiving the statement.
---
Using a quote I've never heard of, and no reference as to the fact that it was a quote of surprise, offense was taken.
---
Then, when clarified, I offered an apology for the confusion.
---
76 is my secondary game, well behind Rocket league. I rarely play it back to back days, and even more rarely for more than an hour and a half at a time. 
---
I played for an hour today. Between the burrows/whitesprings and the new event I obtained more than enough legendaries to obtain multiple 3*s from the purveyor....
---
So, from a casual player...... You're doing it wrong.
---
I will try not to forget about posting the picture with Brotherhood fatigues.
---
Also, and important, if you want more black you need to mod the light leather armor to it‚Äôs strongest version, can‚Äôt recall the name, but when you mod it look into the first options (not where the pockets are).
---
Their names did show and I took pictures from every angle. Still never counted
---
sorry, but when my kid turns 6 or 7 he's gonna have to learn how to properly teabag, and he *will absolutely* have a mic.
---
i am not sorry, suck it.
---
not sure how people who dont reddit or spoil things before hand online will even know how or what to do, so you kind of are talking in an echo chamber about this
---
Pretty sure I know what I'm doing and have the gear at this point. Extreme coordination with a team of 4 people is probably why you have done fine. I'll go in, do my job, guard my creature, and the rest of the group will scatter all over doing Odin knows what. And I still stand by most of the food dispensers being un-fillable given the spawn rate of the stuff to put in them. The Venison trough is the only one I ever see filled, and that produces a glowing deathclaw that usually survives the event. I have never seen more than one creature survive it.
---
So new and refreshing!
---
Is it difficult? That‚Äôs awesome if it is
---
Nice! Yea i‚Äôve had some good luck with legendaries and drops, really liking the new event! Just hoping to get people conscious about the timing of the event.
---
They aren‚Äôt so bad at the queen, since most of the adds are non-legendary and most of us aren‚Äôt chasing the meat piles since often the queen is outside of a nuke zone.
---
Anytime w/ a cluster of high-value legendaries, I‚Äôd hold off on the boomy. I say that with a fully spec‚Äôd demo character, and it irritates ME when I blow the corpses everywhere, I can only imagine how much it bugs others.
---
That said, I do use them some in events where there are adds that need to be controlled AND I want to put damage on a boss (SBQ, Sheepsquatch, etc.)
---
I'm assuming PC, but you might want to edit your post and clarify.
---
i like the fire axe also.
---
I was referring to the base plans.  
---
The mod plans for the T-60 and T-51b are for sale at the Watoga vendor as are the mods themselves.  
---
I like having the plans as I can then craft PA to match the level of the player.  I sometimes do escort runs and it‚Äôs nice to be able to give them something to take away with them other than experience points.  
---
There was a player that helped me out early on by giving me Marsupial, Speed Daemon, and a level 40 TSE Combat Shotgun.  So, I like to help others when the opportunity comes up.
---
you know what
---
they should add fishing
---
This is what I envisioned Survival truly being like.
---
U r doomed once u put in a staircase..won't be able to remove either the lower floor or the upper floor..or the stairs in between them.. I had to dismantle the entire house to rebuild the stairs...
---
Does equip order matter like in previous fallouts, or just the fact that you have the two active and in synergy? Also thanks for answering my questions!
---
I'm a parent of  3 yo, and 14 yo sons and. . . . I agree 100%. 14 yo is getting old enough to where he's able to try to "adult" to a point, but I still do not include him in party chat with my friends. Because frankly things come up on the fly, and sometimes those things are not 18 &amp; under appropriate. Some parents are A holes though, who breed other little A holes, whom think it's okay to destroy "adult time". I personally despise those parents, and no I don't think it's cute that little Bobby Jo, or Jennifer just screamed into an open mic. Enforce some control, and realize that it's not cool to ruin everyone's free time because you parent like an inbred Donkey. Not cool, dude. Not cool.
---
I‚Äôve done Project Paradise several times where people were using mics and it‚Äôs never crashed for me.
---
Where in the hell can I get recipes that cheap?
---
Iv never had good luck with drops. First good rng. Lvl 93 now. I just sold all my .45 to a guy for all his 5.56 so now Iv gotta grind to make more
---
Yea i figured as much, but just hoping to get more people to be conscious about how the event actually works. Can certainly be started quickly if one just wants to farm legendaries, but to keep all 3 friendlies alive and 100% takes effort and coordination. The rewards for it are generally better as well.
---
Quick question for ya... Why? And if your response is because it's funny. Why do you find it funny? 
---
Someone could argue that with the logic you've displayed you shouldnt be allowed to have children. But in order for us to regulate that you'd have to be a woman.
---
check your status and make sure the rads didn't get you and make you a meat eater.
---
But, literally just used corn soup and carrot soup. now well fed and full drink and such.
---
Destiny games have had this same problem for ever with their raids
---
we have to rely on outside/independent lfg apps/sites
---
This is the exception to these types of requests. 
---
This sub regularly bitches about low roll drops. Even if the 1* bug is fixed, people will still complain because it isn't good tier drops, and they don't have a build that can use it. 
---
Most of the drop requests/complaints in this sub amount to little more than "BGS make it far easier for me to get top tier EQ"
---
Oh nice I see what you mean. I really wish I had found other friendly dwellers to help me out early on - no such luck for me lol I did the struggle for 3 months until I finally found some decent people to hang out with.
---
Finally saved up enough materials to craft my first set of power armor - server crashed and I lost the PA and my materials. That was a bad day for me lol
---
Maybe make it so stimpaks heal them when broken so your not just out of weapons. But I dont think it would be annoying. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than being stuck in a corner with 20 ghouls down my throat out of ammo. Only to be madly swinging my fists to try to escape and boom break a hand. The game isnt challenging enough. 
---
I've beat every mission solo, never once used power armor, dont wear any armor for that matter. Never owned any 2 shot explosives or godlike weapons. Did it all with just defense perk cards and melee build. I'm level 120 and play with a 1 star meathook. A little bit of psycho and down goes legendary lol 91 sheepsquatch.  Even playing with no armore I've still managed to collect 250 stimpaks.. the game is too easy but I love playing it. Need more of a challenge.
---
It's 50% in the pip-boy, but that's just some text. In the code, it's 40%.
---
you're completely right. Will fix it right away, thanks for the heads-up (Y)
---
All 3 glitched for me ... waiting  for a fix
---
Gotcha.  Yes, they would be in the zone. 
---
Though, if you have chameleon armor or mutation and stay crouched down, it would be hard for them to find you.
---
I actually filled my 50 slots with good shots. Beyond that the photo you take for challenges won't save even into your ps album, same me much more trouble for deleting.
---
Good thing I got a drill off a 3 star super mutant last night!  Instead of a legendary item üôÑ
---
If people want to down vote this then that's up to them, just wanted to see how many others are having the same issue. it mightve shown Bethesda just how bad it is.
---
Love those dailies. I do the campfire first to get all of Treadly‚Äôs bug parts. Then swoop over to Dolly‚Äôs and collect my pemmican, repellents and yao gaui ribs. Finally a little mutagenic waste FTW.  
---
I always get one badge. Sometimes two
---
I'm enjoying the bear arm, but I needs mods for it to see how it stacks up against my DCG
---
Wah wah wah. Gunna have to repost again lol.
---
Haha yea i hear ya, i‚Äôm around level 260 and have only gotten 3 or 4 ‚Äúgod roll‚Äù drops so its not common but this new event seems to have more 3* dropping for me, and the new legendary purveyor should really help too.
---
Watoga Station
---
In fallout 4 u could put in a staircase, then attach a floor to it, then keep few turrets and then remove the floor and stairs... The turrets would float in the air... And u save resources... Well, Bethesda don't want you to do that in 76.. But messed it up while implementing...
---
Nope, an unknown quote is not clear.
---
Wah wah is implying whining to anyone who doesn't know borat.
---
But you are arguing. üòò
---
^^^ this is the type of post Bethesda needs to read!
---
we have a fan of the game who was so put off by the shite RNG coding he has given up on an entire end game activity
---
much the same as people doing SBQ getting shite 1* drops or a freaking drill
---
Squirrels are just rats with bushy tails, screw'em.
---
-50% chance of disease = 100% chance of disease.
---
ikr?
---
No, this is what's called pointing out your false equivalency.
---
We live in the absolute ***least*** violent time in human history.
---
It just *seems* more violent because now we have 24 hour news that needs to fill the air with something, and as the old saying goes "*if it bleeds, it leads*".
---
We have ***ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, UNDENIABLY*** seen worse violence than we do today.  Hell, when was the last time a neigboring town raided your town, killed the men, stole your livestock, and burned down your home?
---
I'd wager that unless you've been to a combat zone, you've never actually been in danger of another person trying to literally, physically kill you.
---
Most of us lead very peaceful lives pockmarked by *news stories* of violence that are usually pretty damned far away.
---
I see frogs a lot near my base in toxic valley, southwest of the wrecked space station
---
I just got a mutant slayers explosive 50 cal from the vendor this would be perfect
---
I greatly enjoy when my 7 year old daughter hops on to say "daddy all these people are noobs" and  "git gud".
---
I think it pulls from some kind of arrayed list? For example, the suppressor mod would be assigned numbers 98-100 on a list of 100. So if you "roll" a 98, 99, or 100, you learn the suppressor mod. But if you roll 97 or less, you learn another mod? Unless you've already learned it, then you get nothing?
---
It's the only sensible way I can figure scrapping works, because starting off, can learn 1 mod per 1 scrapped gun. Later on though, you can scrap 20-30+ without unlocking anything. It can be frustrating...
---
See Alice about that flap limb
---
That's because, as of this post, anti armor perks and effects do not work on energy weapons yet/still
---
Damn, I learned something today lol
---
Craft, scrap, rinse and repeat I am still trying to get a silencer for my bloodied handmade I must have crafted 50 handmades
---
Yeah I mean we're adults so obviously I know people with kids - but at least my one friend is really courteous - if he's gonna play with his kid - he's like "alright guys - gonna spend time with the fam" and switches to their own party so they can chill and not bother everyone else. 
---
I had this one where this chick was holding her screaming toddler in her freaking lap and they just screamed the whole time and I was like I gotta go - I don't wanna listen to this.. Like take care of your child instead of just holding them crying. 
---
Props to you for knowing when it is and isn't ok to bring your kids in. Plus I see groups of kids on the LFG on xbox looking for other kids to play with - let them do that - instead of letting them integrate into adult chats. Because not all adults are gonna remove themselves from that situation you know? Some people don't care and are gonna behave however they want in front of your kid because it's not their job to watch them.
---
I‚Äôve only invested 246 hours into this $40 game, is it even worth it?
---
the other 88 lone wanderers who came before you would be disappointed in your statement

---
America‚Äôs culture of violence is, overall, part of its strength.
---
I've gotten 3* items the three times I've done it so far.
---
Well considering that it was poorly explained last time and people like you trying to be trolls came in to trash it, I figured I'd give a repost a shot.   
---
You can call it "crying" all you want. This is a genuine issue I'm discussing, rather than say, me crying about a perk or something. I play PvP for hours a day in this game and am usually the guy talking like you when someone cries at me for "Hacking" or "abusing a meta" and I to, laugh in their faces. But when it comes to what is essentially exploiting something which shouldn't happen? Yea I'll complain.
---
I seen your last thread and apologize for the trolls calling you bad at PVP instead of reading the point you were making of an exploit, not skill levels.
---
I opened up a ticket about this particular challenge and when I sent them a picture, they responded that I had to do it in the game.  Now I have to clean up squirrel bits from my front yard, log into FO76, find a drill and a squirrel ... WTF Bethesda!!!
---
If you save up to 1000 it lets you short yourself when you max out.
---
Oh no!!! A new backpack skin? Could you possibly share a screenshot thru imgr so I can see it? I didn't even know it was dropping this! 
---
I am really enjoying the event even tho I only got to do it a few times but I've got the Bear Arm plan now so I can make Bear Arms for everyone!!
---
Lol. I too must admit I have had my 3 yo talk smack to another. It was family (cousin) who he talked it to, but nonetheless.
---
It's more likely that you're not seeing people join due to the bug that causes the game to crash when trying to join the event/go down the elevator/doing the event. Happened to me and my teammates multiple times last night. I was the only one who managed to actually get through and finish the event, the rest of them gave up after a shit ton of crashes
---
My game still crashes every time i enter the elevator f k this don‚Äôt give Bethesda probs if there are still such annoying bugs!!
---
you defied the odds with that one for sure! congrats!
---
Ty
---
In the room where you use the terminal to start the event, there are lines drawn on the floor that direct you to each area. They‚Äôre not in crayon, though.
---
Don't be a negative nancy.
---
Cool. Thank you.
---
Thank you so much!! I need that in my life! I love how it looks!
---
I have 2 xb's, so, worst case, I can take photos of myself?
---
Why not use both? The Deathclaw Gauntlet is probably stronger overall, but you can use the Tambo especially against Scorched enemies.
---
It's w/e dude, people will be people. I'm guessing those downvoting and "trolling" in this thread are those who also use the base or something similar and just dislike the idea of it being taken out.
---
They will be repeatedly murdered by everything in there, but sure give it a go.
---
.38, I could mod it
---
Agreed.
---
there are two locations i know of that spawn half broken crossbows. one is in the locked room at Sons of Dane compound. the other is on a table at that meditation event place (forgot name)
---
Man that would be cool - I know a lot of people would want a BOS one too. I need a raiders backpack now.
---
They don't have to be killing blows. If the legendary doesn't load, wait about 10 seconds then go back to the body.
---
I think its just a drop from the event. I have the plan learned but I can't even craft the default one yet.
---
Nope. Just seems to be a bug in the games math with the two perks.
---
Unepquip gunsmith, bash everything, and drink ballistic bock.
---
Me and my kid will play whatever the hell we want,  and when you shoot my kid because he's getting on your nerves I'll merc the shit outta you for it. :)

There‚Äôs a shack south of sunnytop station where various critters spawn. See them there on occasion.
---
Also northish of sunnytop is a wreck of vehicles that also has random critters too.
---
Note radstags are in the critter grouping it would seem.
---
Heavy Gunner effects the .50 cal because it IS a heavy gun.
---
.50's/Cryolater/Minigun/Fat man/Flamer/LMG are all big guns. Grenade an auto nade launcher don't count as big guns and only proc demo demo expert.
---
Any gun that isn't above with an explosive rounds prefix will ONLY proc from Demo expert and the appropriate rifleman/shotgun perks
---
I have the link for that, but I don't think I can post that kind of content here
---
I haven't heard of that on ps4 yet though. Plus again, when people are there, they just simply do nothing.
---
Very true.
---
Observations about eating spoiled and getting diseases are true. 
---
The mutations are one or the other, you can't have both at the same time.
---
Spent all my saved up scrips today but got  some 2 star trash weopns n armor... Scripped them again... But some players are quite lucky in getting what they want I guess...
---
I found out this game is for the sims players. This comunity is, well not progamers. Also friendly only in some ways.
---
I would add that this is worst event ingame, hopefuly bethesda fix it little, but i know they don't care and it seems like comunity is happy....
---
I have a VE railway...not sure what the third star is off hand...PS4
---
 I mostly use my Instigating Lever Action on adds, as so many go down in one shot.
---
 It is amusing blowing an area clean but finding the bits can be difficult, that's for sure. I'll be careful with it.
---
Its called player vending.
---
You see the item and the price and either buy or don't buy.
---
Healing factor, speed demon.
---
Oh I see. Thank you
---
I'll also toot my own horn here if you want a simplified version [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brdr12/complete\_tadpole\_challenge\_checklist/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brdr12/complete_tadpole_challenge_checklist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Thx for reply
---
So it would affect pretty much every player above level 40?
---
VERY good to know. Thanks!
---
158
---
place it down somewhere thats not popular and never move again,
---
&gt;your preserved pie isn‚Äôt worth 25k caps
---
No, you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs worth 5k.
---
So, the place that everyone here gets the codes from doesn't have it so you thought you'd ask on here?
---
There's a small flaw in that plan.
---
\+1 for fishing
---
Real quick with that challenge. Do both of us need to be in the water for it to count? A friend and I tried several different methods and none worked.
---
Mics are essentially to really get the most out of the game. Once you start talking with random people you run into, the game definitely gets more interesting lol. Honestly without mics this situation likely would've turned out a whole lot differently I'm sure of that!
---
Just say sure I will - when you have the caps :D
---
I would like to actually play it once. So far, over 2 days of trying, 12 crashes. I even joined the event once! Was in there, shooting bots then...crash. it is totally unplayable for me still. 
---
Bethesda, hot fix this hot mess now!!!
---
Hahah yeah it was a tense moment at first, but a mic and a little irl charisma can get you a long way in this game! ;)
---
Looks good except for Sun Kissed and Travel Agent. You'll want Radicool and Lone Wanderer instead. Radicool will significantly boost your strength, so you may want to consider barbarian over strong back.
---
I really like the idea of a bloodied sneak build. I currently have a bloodied crossbow and I love it.
---
Sugar Grove is the best for sure. I'm kinda low level though so I avoid the control room if the Assaultron is present.
---
Camp McClintock is also a good place. The main reception area has them in small bins, and scattered on the floor and on desks. A couple of army bags are also around for ballistic fiber. I think the last time I went there I got 21 springs (not sure if that's effected by my Scrapper perk though).
---
For screws I usually do a run through New Gad, the Capitol Building, and the Charleston Herald. The muties in New Gad often drop springs, and there's a few fans, toy cars, and such about. Capitol Building has typewriters, a few fans, a globe or two, etc. Charleston building has like 4-5 typewriters and some clipboards (for more springs), and if you cross over to the next door building (part of the firebreathers agility route), there are a couple of hot plates and a desk clock. Takes longer to farm screws than springs imho.
---
I got a quad, explosive , +1 perception .44 Last night. Yesterday I got an medicine explosive Western Revolver. No tse but close.
---
Lol üòÇ
---
I used a death tambo until I found a 1\* .... either furious or instigating, I forget which, deathclaw gauntlet.  IIRC, it does about 2-1/2 more dmg per hit than the tambo.
---
(then I started hoarding too much, so now live in PA...I know, my problem)  Downside is neither will equip if you are in PA...
---
Zealot bonus is only against scorched, whereas executioner works on anything.
---
Also IIRC, the bonus damage from executioner is higher than the zealot bonus.
---
Wile it may take bit more work to get (enemy) down to 50% health, but once there, that extra damage per hit bonus from executioner is is great :)
---
On my alt character I have a permanent base and I love it.
---
This character however was made to be a wandering merchant who can place her shop down wherever, mostly in nukes and events to sell stims and ammo.
---
I figured being mobile was part of what they wanted us to play with in the CAMP system.
---
Nice.
---
I totally agree
---
I'm seeing a lot of anecdotal reasons and solutions, but I'm pretty sure it's due to lag. If you do it more slowly, taking a second break before selecting the first connector and a second break before attaching it to the second, it works more consistently. 
---
This explains why it hasn't been fixed since day 1, because it's a symptom of something tricky to deal with. Like, we'd all like less server lag, but it's not simple. 
---
This issue is the reason I don't take certain workshops, though. I'm done spending an hour trying to connect oil in Wade Airport to the energy box with 30+ connectors each.
---
*Says No*
---
Kid: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I use the mic 100% of the time, but mute when necessary as to not transmit obnoxious,  non relevant audio.
---
Made a couple dozen friends in game that I play with regularly now.  It's great.  :)
---
Are you on ps4????  If so PM me I'm down to help you
---
Ah XB1 lol ty though mate cheers
---
These are really awesome! I've already used the water-plant map for two camp locations.
---
I would really like to have a combined water-plant and resource deposit map to try and find prime locations for extractors plus a nice water feature.
---
Maybe this is being too lazy though as I can do some manual comparisons on maps you've already created.
---
It seems like such a weak weapon that it could use every boost it can get. I figure between stealth, bloodied and VATS I might have the highest chance of viability. Jealous of your Xbow!
---
What does QoL mean
---
How is it possible to have 40% swing speed + 40% power attack damage on one item? You mean 40% reduced damage taken when power attacking?
---
Then DC gauntlet will be better, because it has higher base damage + better prefix.
---
Spoiled items are unaffected and have disease. Carnivore is meat eating only, no fruit or veggies. Herbivore is fruit or veggies, no meat.
---
Both mutations still allow you to eat canned food, and items like soup are special. If you have carnivore, you will only get water benefit from soup without meat.
---
Yep. On PS4 I often have to leave the map a number of times to be able to select my camp to fast travel to.
---
Quality of life
---
Yep that one did thanks
---
In savage divide near the behemoth....a bit north around the lake.
---
Twin Lakes, its a random but they are often there, along with Opossum and Beaver and fireflys.
---
Visit my camp there!
---
I think I have a few for sale!
---
Good tips! Is strength mainly helpful as utility, being able to carry more?
---
15 tries, and I still cannot play it. :(
---
Hol up...
---
Ah thanks
---
This reminds me. I‚Äôm gonna have to teach my future kid how to properly BXR.
---
The bot has a timer. Once the timer has elapsed, he just dies. Seems to be about 10-15 minutes. Had lots of people joining and server hopping to get things yesterday with no issues.
---
Agree. I want to be notified whenever Messenger, Project Paradise, Census Violence are up.
---
Cause then everyone and their mom would show up to specific events.
---
Healing factor, speed demon, talons, electrically charged are some of my faves as well.
---
Actually, the damage on it is quite impressive with low health, Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction. You will be impressed. Especially with all the extra damage sneak perks. What Platform do you play on?
---
This game isn't worth full price. I don't care if you love it. The game flat out is not worth full price with the current quality of content and how buggy it is.
---
If that is a factor for somebody looking to play, it is a valid question
---
Nah lol, if they brought the base version from 1dr to 0, then all versions will have 1 dr less unless they were to buff it. So its intentional
---
The trick seems to be installing a secondary, temporary set of stairs. This allows the upper floor to be 'accessible' again, while you tear down and rebuild/replace your main staircase.
---
A bear head as an arm
---
You‚Äôre probably one of the cheaters who use said base. Hope BSG bans people using exploited bases, clownü§°
---
Whatever you say *smh* but I completely understand what you're saying on how you rather have something craftable pet instead of having to do the actual time and effort to get it and possibly lose it (your example the frog in a jar) where as if you were able to craft it and did lose it you could recraft it by just getting some simple materials or as you suggested easily obtained one through the help of a team. Either way you're complaining about the game being too hard and you want a change. I suggest if you want an easier game than play a different one.
---
And I'm going to have a great day buddy I hope you enjoy yours.
---
Same for me. Then someone told me to do the whitespring location. Literally when you fast travel ansel is right in front of you on the red car. If you don't see him, hop. Prob less than a minute between hops.
---
I think someone posted earlier that their CAMP blueprint was broken down into individual pieces. Rather than placing one down for the whole camp (which they had previously saved), it had split them up into separate Blueprints. Same problem?
---
They mean for trading items between players- not the vending machines
---
Thanks! After looking at the recipes I think I'll go speed demon. Yellowcake is easy to farm, and I have enough other things that require cobalt.
---
I thought so too till i checked the dead squach and all the loot that was left was some meat
---
Healing factor, marsupial and grounded for me. I use marsupial for exploring not pvp though.
---
Make unmutated humans great again!   OP is right though, 800+ hours in game started using mutation about 100 hours ago and its like hitting an easy button.  If you do pvp without mutations it is a major handicap because almost everyone has them.  The downsides can be heavily mitigated to the point where its not even close.
---
Yes! I finally got it last night. Had that and a civil war hat on him. I've found him dozens of times and this was the first time he didn't just have garbage on him.
---
It NEEDS to be implemented, im currently in a server and Ive waited 20 out of the 30 minutes so far and not a single person has come joined me. Its happened a few times now whereive waited the full 30 mins without a single person coming to help. This event is impossible to complete solo. So basically im wasting my time doing nothing because the Dev's didn't plan this out ahead of time.
---
You've got me hyped, now! PS4.
---
Text chat would undermine the whole pure RP aspect of this game, the humans are the NPC's, so they need to have spoken voiced dialogue. Microphones are readily available to you, even if you just connect a ps4 controller to talk into on your pc or something.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of chasing, and w/ the AGL you can keep damage on the boss (and your Adrenaline up) as well as the adds (as long as you are built to take your own demo)
---
38 is cheap and plentiful.
---
I would: 
---
a) keep it at least until you can evaluate its performance against a variety of critters.
---
if performance is underwhelming 
---
b) upgrade it to a larger caliber
---
c) repeat steps a and b until it is no longer useful
---
d) turn in for scrip
---
I found mine in front of the moth man statue. Pretty much spawn in and run straight until you hit the statue on your right.
---
Darn, if you were on PC i was going to give you a bloodied crossbow to help your build. If you want, next time I play, I can take a picture of the damage it does with my perks so you get a good idea of it.
---
Love me some Tea Time, mmm. Permanent shitstain on my completed events list, mmm.
---
Speaking from experience, the only people that actually talk on ps4 are either obnoxious children, mouth breathers with babies, or are already in a party chat. The remaining 20% or so that will chat in area chat are chill people.
---
Hell, I did the Enlightenment event the other day. There were four of us. Nobody was taking bio fluid to the lighthouse but me.  We failed it.
---
same with over repairing Weapons, no more extra damage
---
Aren't those Radtoads?
---
wow, im so glad you live in some kind of magical insulated biosphere apart from the struggles, trials and tribulations of the "plebs" and unfortunate masses, and anyone "unlucky" enough to have brown/dark skin
---
after 8 years on tour, i can say truthfully, the entire world is becoming polarized and violence and enconomic systematic oppression is very real and will not stop anytime soon
---
growing up in the projects, I saw 5 of my best friends die before we graduated due to random violence, and knew of countless others who lost friends and loved ones right here in america due to gun violence, gangs, and police over-aggression towards what you probably call "minorities"
---
I myself have been shot at at a fucking stop light for no reason, Been at a party where someone got killed, been at a club whent he whole place shot shot up, my uncle was shot and left paralyzed by a mugger who stole his shoes
---
Im not including the thousands of bullets that have just barely missed my head as we patrolled in Mosul, but i signed up to protect the US so I knew in that case what i was getting into
---
again, im super happy that you are able to live in this dream world where hyper-violence doesnt exist
---
but for you to "'wager that unless you've been to a combat zone, you've never actually been in danger of another person trying to literally, physically kill you" is extremely arrogant and ignorant at the same time, you discount the struggles millions of people experience every day, be it systematic genocide or the simple degradation of minorities in every way possible
---
You speak of these things having obviously never experienced anything remotely akin to what im descibing
---
maybe try remembering your experiences are not reprsentative of everyone else.  in fact in this situation, id venture YOU are the "minority"
---
SO
---
all this being said, i want you to know that this "peaceful" time you are enjoying has been paid for by the blood sweat and tears of many soldiers, we do this FOR you and for EVERYONE who values the sanctity of life and the pursuit of happiness and freedom
---
So a paternal twin selfy?
---
I'll come with a hazmat suit.
---
Rubber Armor ‚≠ê
---
+1 Endurance
---
Dude youre name maked me laugh so hard:)
---
AND legendary fishing gear!
---
Sure thing! I'm super curious to know. And thanks! Even if it didn't work out I appreciate the gesture!
---
oh good
---
Nexus Mods has a mod that will automatically generate your custom INI for each update. I just made a post about this if you want to check my post history. Lots of good modding info in the comments.
---
I just refuse to alter my language or behaviour. If the parent brings a child into that situation, it is the same as taking them to an R rated movie. They know their kid is gonna see or hear some shit.
---
‚ÄúOn his friend‚Äôs list‚Äù does NOT equal friend. Friend‚Äôs list is the only way to join servers with someone else. People use it for trading, or in the case of these guys, possibly PVP competition/rivalry.
---
I gave up on the event just now and went to do something else, not one single player was doing anything but killing everything
---
i see jetpack plans sell between 500-1100 caps all day long. 
---
i'd say 1500 for the minigun
---
So then don't cater to them? Continue talking like you normally would, f-bombs and all. If they don't like it, they can take their kids back out of the chat.
---
They ain't your kids, it's not your responsibility to parent them or whatever.
---
If you are on Xbox I can make you a bear arm for free when I get off work this afternoon. 
---
I really understand your frustration - I've only been able to complete it a couple of times myself - we had a level 5 start it before my group was ready and then do nothing and I've also seen people standing around doing nothing - like i understand it can be a little confusing at first but it's not hard to figure out to pick up the glowing stuff and put it in the machine with the diamond. I mean we had 3 pets and two died right away because no one defended I managed to keep the bloatfly alive almost to the very end but since I was the only one defending it got overwhelmed and we failed :/ it's frustrating
---
A secondary spawn has frogs/opossums/stags near the toads
---
Even worse, autoscrap seems to target individual junk items before it targets bulked items.  So if you have bulked plastic and cooking oil in your stash and request a mod or repair that requires plastic, it will scrap the cooking oil before it scraps the bulk plastic.  Frikkin' bananas.  I have some cosmetic junk items I've been holding onto for whenever the update releases to display them and have to keep a close eye on what will be scrapped when I craft or repair things, then manually scrapping bulked junk first so it doesn't auto-destroy my stuff.  So dumb.
---
I'm honestly more annoyed by the extremely self centered bEtHeSdA pLeASe posts every five seconds for more stupid, unless, non-game-fixing pointless shit to distract an already swamped dev team
---
george orwell couldnt have said it better...
---
"War is peace / freedom is slavery [and] ignorance is strength.‚Äù
---
Ty for replying,i will,u on in an hour?
---
when you said hide stretchers I thought of  Ramsey Bolton from GoT
---
I have been finding cameras in the world as spawned loot. Like in file cabinets or drawers. I wonder if that would start your quest if you found a random one too.
---
There is. Check the trading subs, they're even called "The Middlemen".
---
I know that.
---
If they are crashing you might have them try spawning at greg's mine supply and walking up to arktos - this enabled me to not crash when going down the elevator - still got random other crashes but at least was able to get into the event
---
Yeah I‚Äôm thinking about modding it and taking perks for it to try it out, I can always go back to current build and scrip it if I don‚Äôt like it
---
I was thing the same with the minigun
---
They must be lazy to just make everything lose 1dr instead of changing individual items. My Underarmor had 10dr before they made some of the items have 1dr but now that they did this mine has 9dr
---
Shit dude PS4? I'll stop by tonight if you have .308 and fusion cores for 15 caps
---
If they are ON something uou can store that thing and they‚Äôll get stored and become re-placeable as well. I had that happen with two turrets, one was on a foundation and one was on a roof. Stored the roof and foundation, the two turrets showed up in stored as well. Easier than re-placing my entire base.
---
Apparently you don't understand? There is no safe way currently to trade item for item - not items for caps - without a middle man unless it's a player you know and trust.
---
We all tried the whole "fast travel to spot close by and walk there" thing, didn't matter. We all crashed numerous times anyways. Weird thing: only times we didn't crash going down the elevator was when we were outside of power armor
---
Definitely helping with carry weight. It also help if melee for a good backup or crushing trash mobs.
---
exploring, questing, shopping, collecting things, killing some mobs here and there‚Ä¶
---
believe it or not, not everyone who bought this game is a lifeless ludo-kid gold-farming Whitesprings or West Tek 24/7, over and over, repeating the same routine thousands of times...
---
I mean thematically it makes sense for a fresh-out-of-the-vault person
---
Every time I see him I make a post on reddit. In fact one night I xbox messaged everyone on the server. 2 people showed up and the rest seemed annoyed I was "bugging" them about having the tourist.
---
Guess I will just keep posting when I have the guy on my server.  Good luck!
---
No it's specifically the tourist bodies
---
Apparently I do.
---
Thanks for your time.
---
Yeah, it can become overwhelming, especially if there aren't many people participating. It's a fun challenge though.
---
Bulk used to break down when building/crafting/modding previously and was protected from scrap all. They broke it when they stopped Mods being broken down and being used as materials. They fixed bulk not being used when crafting but it still scraps with scrap all.
---
Just make your base in hornwright, and then only go into worlds where you can place your base.
---
Problem solved.
---
Oh I know that - but I'd rather leave the chat than "Hey guys, there's a 9 year old in here!!!" - this is the response we get. people expect you to dance around their kids. so i'd rather just make my own party than try to deal with it
---
If I was a cheater who use the base, why would I complain about it and let Bethesda get my IGN (given I use the same on both) and exactly how to do it?  
---
That's like robbing a bank and running straight into a PD and telling them how I did it and handing it all over lmfao.
---
You are a bit special.
---
in addition to places already mentioned Ive heard good things about col kelly too...
---
If I decide to move or my spot is taken I kind of just move and place down my blueprinted trade platform. Than I kind of just redesign my base when I don't fell like grinding stuff.
---
Right i agree with you - but in the experience I've had - they chastise us for cussing etc around their kid like ?????? why would you bring them into an all adult chat? That's why we just leave and make our own party
---
If your on XBOX, me.
---
The only solution I've seen to this is to build your camp as a "floater," where you have a single land-based foundation attached to some stairs, with the rest of your camp built off of that. This way, when you blueprint it, it should all identify as a single structure. 
---
Not a fan of the floating camps, myself, but it seems to be a pretty popular build style for the mobile crowd.
---
Note that it only alters YOUR spawn point. Visitors still go to original placement.
---
Similar situation here - had a guy run with me a few times without mic. He was a good player and hooked me up often. Then he got a mic, when I happened to be playing with an irl friend, and he couldn‚Äôt have been much older than 8. Kept talking to his dog who was apparently trying to eat his chicken nuggets. ‚ÄúNo buddy, they are my nugglets! No!‚Äù And then when we tried to leave (never joined a party with him, he just popped up on our map) he came running up behind us ‚Äúwait guys, I need to go make ramen... no grandma, these are my friends... no grandma I didn‚Äôt take your medicine... grandma make me ramen please‚Äù
---
To this day we still laugh about that kid whose dog wanted those nugs as bad as he wanted ramen. Lmfao
---
Please move your camp next door to mine. I don't need them as much as I used to but one cap per screw is nothing. I don't want to drive the market prices up, but if I needed them, I'd probably be willing to pay 3 caps each, a bit more if I was feeling rich (I'm definitely not at the moment).
---
Nice
---
You should be able to get legendary leg armor from fishing. like catching a boot.
---
If you think about it that way, it does make sense. The rifle comes modded and at 90%. If you add other stuff that wasn't "legendary" it's not going to be reduced weight. You killed a mobs champion and took their weapon or armor. If you change it, is it truly the legendary weapon you picked up? The Grandfather's Axe Paradox.
---
I've heard it doesn't work for everyone sadly - I've gone down both without and with because there was a nuke zone.
---
I have a bloodied crossbow I dont use if you wanted to buy it
---
Some of my favorite challenges in tombraider were like that...
---
challenge: catch a chicken, toss it in the air, hit it with a flaming arrow before it hits the ground.
---
trophy name: Rotiseree
---
Challenge: Kill any animal with an explosive arrow
---
trophy name : "Was that really necessary?"
---
and a few others like that....
---
Task Force Falcon, OEF1, OIF1.
---
I'm no stranger to violence.
---
For the record - you can store and replace them as of writing.
---
\*\*You cannot though: \*\*
---
\- Create any new ones
---
\- Scrap and then re-place
---
\- View/Inspect in the Atom Shop
---
\- Swap model (Cat for Deathclaw &amp; vice versa)
---
\*\*Unclear:\*\*
---
\- If moving camp loses them forever
---
I get dysentery a lot. Being a silent deadly sniper that keeps shitting her pants makes me laugh too much.
---
The reserve currency status of the US dollar is born of guns and the willingness to use them.
---
Do you mean the number of the correct answer? Cause the order of the answers never changes.
---
That stops it for me alone, plus why would I move my selling/resource base I put up for the intention of helping new players outside of Vault 76 (next to overseers camp, it's got workbenches and farming for them) for the intention of moving these people into finding new glitch bases (since that's what happens, people over use these things then they find new ones).
---
How much health does eating meat satisfy? Maybe you‚Äôre bugged and Carnivore just isn‚Äôt showing in your pipboy.
---
Yup. I can put 40mm into the ground at my feet and take no damage. Now that's a normal one, I just found the Bloodied one so .....
---
I wish there was a way to browse someone's vendor machine before traveling there. I hate paying to fast travel to someone's camp only to have it filled with non-legendary weapons and armor. Like a wasteland Craigslist. You can see what they have, but you still need to travel there to buy.
---
So a tip the only thing that saves any considerable weight by being bulked is Aluminum and Lead. Anything else and you are just wasting plastic. Copper and Cork actually weight more bulked.
---
Oh cool, and an acid node you say too? I'm in the gym for rubber regularly, didn't notice, I'll check it out. Cheers!!
---
It‚Äôs odd that this hasn‚Äôt gotten more attention, because the majority of people I talked to used Class Freak specifically to reduce the negatives of Speed Demon (and obviously marsupial too as they sort of go hand in hand). 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not like the Pipboy menu is bugged for Speed Demon. Class Freak literally does nothing for Speed Demon. 
---
Class Freak should say, ‚ÄúReduces the negative aspects of SOME mutations‚Äù. If that‚Äôs what Bethesda is intending.
---
I had this happen this morning at Whitespring.  Ran into the parking lot and kept seeing the red arc damage flash but no enemies?!  I jumped out of reach and after about 2 solid minutes, the ghouls appeared, like 5 of them.  After I dispatched them and headed to the clubhouse, all the ghouls that came after me were lying down.  Like, literally, laying down and sliding across the floor and attacking me from their sleeping position.  It was like I got swarmed by a bunch of humanoid-radroaches type of crossbreed.  By the time I headed downstairs, they were normal again, but weirdest farming trip to WS I've had so far.
---
You and my mom agree on something my man.
---
I'm surprised to see so many people using healing factor. I tried it for a while and simply couldn't get the hang of it -- stimpacks are practically worthless, and the mutation doesn't work in combat.
---
Ugh I‚Äôm jealous honestly. Would love to be able to solo these hahahaha
---
They /do/ affect the gauss rifle, because the damage it deals is ballistic.
---
Its even better to meet those 9 year old GTA players....
---
Parents to self absorbed to care WTH the kids are up to.....
---
Can you be more specific with the locked gate? I just went through the whole thing
---
Full T-51b Armor and All Rise with Incisor. And keeping the aggro so the boss doesn't one shot the other players, most of whom seem to be using TSR or AAE weapons. In fact, if I didn't spam stimpaks, it would have killed me in a few hits at times.
---
Did you NOT fight the Level 100 Sheepsquatch? Or do you maybe have a broken gear setup?
---
I've been seeing them alot in the areas around vault 76 and flatwoods recently!
---
In that principle then the legendary armor that gives you weapon weight reduction shouldn‚Äôt include mods also? I kinda disagree with you here man. Mods are part of the weapon so it should affect the weapon at a whole not just base.
---

Edit: Not to seem entitled but please don't post links to patch notes, I don't want to go through 20 pages of them, that's why I ask for it replied here!
---
&gt;do not use your most OP one shot or "kill everything in the room" explosive weapons. 
---
Funny guy assuming I have enough stash/bags to carry more than 1 weapon tsk tsk.
---
I love when people sell weapons, bloodied explosive, or anything explosive really, and I turn around to flip it on the market lol. I've bought one gun for 1700 and sold it for 12k five minutes later. Same happened with a gun for 5000 I sold for 10k
---
Three permanent boss level events with unique loot
---
Two permanent small dungeons with higher legendary spawns
---
Two new vendors (players and a legendary vendor)
---
One new crafting ability
---
Cameras to take photos with, punch bowls to give free alcohol with
---
New Survival mode with weekly legendary rewards
---
If a privately hosted server is labeled "rp" and doesn't specify what *kind* of rp it is...I'll just assume it's a two ghouls-one-cup situation and steer clear.
---
Upvote for great film!
---
Have a go, just keep your head down.
---
Oh I know, I just want to know what I'm looking for!
---
Yeah I didn't bite because they screwed up on the sale.
---
one of the badges is make a serum. as well as use a serum.
---
Cant make that which is already made.
---
Yea i would love a text box to do this. It would save so much time trying to price  everything.
---
Just did it for first time,indeed was confused and could not figure out what to do,dindt find or see a machine or something to put the meat into
---
All the new content, including Free Range... hmmmm what else
---
Found him last week at the fairgrounds, back in the back sitting on a folding chair.  It was the 2nd stop I'd checked that day after the Colonel Kelly Monument.  I got him w/o server hopping.
---
Crayon would be fine if it meant getting local maps back.
---
I genuinely wasn‚Äôt aware of this as hadn‚Äôt run into it before. Bethesda really needs to try and ensure a fair playing field for pvp players, players should be reported for this kind of behaviour and given some kind of temporary pvp ban maybe?
---
In my opinion people that exploit glitches in this way clearly have no interest in actually playing the game, they should be allowed to play it.
---
Thx!
---
You sound like every stodgy old Congressman from the 90's saying rap and rock music is making kids violent. This was repeated shortly thereafter in the 2000's with video games being the culprit more especially GTA. They were very wrong and so are you. Here's some proof you're incorrect.
---
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093854807311719
---
Conclusion of the included report. 
---
&gt;Results indicated that trait aggression, family violence, and male gender were predictive of violent crime, but exposure to violent games was not. Structural equation modeling suggested that family violence and innate aggression as predictors of violent crime were a better fit to the data than was exposure to video game violence. These results question the common belief that violent-video-game exposure causes violent acts.
---
That's not to say Violent Video Games don't contribute to the desensitizing of youth. But Factors like family violence play a far greater role than video games. The effect of violent video games is minimal and part of a greater problem.
---
You see it's a far more complicated issue than to just pin violence on 1 factor. I'm glad you had your fun bashing the US but you should educate yourself further on issues like this.
---
Yeah, the event has a (small!) chance of dropping plans to craft the fixer. I bought one for 1.5k off some dude shortly after the event came out. I‚Äôve personally run it ~30 times now and haven‚Äôt seen them drop myself.
---
Prepare for the down votes here will be your responses.
---
Manage your stash blah blah
---
You are not playing the game right blah blah
---
The server can't handle it blah blah
---
I will up vote you to counter the stash haters
---
Yes you dont have to be on a team. You just have to revive someone.
---
You can be a Cannibal like me.... If I can eat with Herbivore  I'm 99% sire it would work for both. Also have Leadbelly
---
then why in gods name did you type all that nonsense?
---
"Most of us lead very peaceful lives pockmarked by news stories of violence that are usually pretty damned far away." is the most entitled and insulated statement ive heard outside of fox news commentators
---
again, i dont agree with your opinion but i will continue fight to protect your right to say it
---
but I often see them being sold for 220-350? NEXT!
---
I didn't know there was a dog!  I'm on the hunt to bring her to my base.  She will be named Belmont.
---
I wanna have a cute Deathclaw :3. Mister cuddles wants huggies.
---
Definitively something they could add to personal terminals.
---
As an old returning player in too busy taking pictures and doing badges. 
---
I've seen the event a few times but unless loot changes i have no reason to do tasks for loot.
---
Its weird overall. I played alot when loot was important and stopped after farming for no reason. Now that I'm back the last thing i do is farm for drops as i have everything i need.
---
Nah somethings wrong. You sound new to the game you probably missed it or the game was just fucked. No one can take your stuff. If you shot the alpha or any creature in this game and another player kills it you still can loot it. As long as you shot it. Tbh if you just joined the event and it died like a minute after that might be why cause I killed the imposter sheepsquach within a minute of arriving and only fired like two three bullets cause other players brought it down but I received nothing from it like I had never been there.
---
You know there's seperate sections for Title and Body right?
---
This all sounds eerily reminiscent of watching peeps get pwn'd by a cloaked imposter squatch while everybody else who had figured it out was humping a pylon.
---
That sounds like a hack, honestly. Doing enough damage to break your armor in one shot? With a fast melee weapon? They aren‚Äôt known for massive hits, they‚Äôre known for speed.
---
It's been since the introduction of the ft timer. I'd much rather live without that
---
Yup he a goner
---
TBH banning them does little, especially in this game where we can pick up accounts for $9 a pop thanks to VPNs. I just wish they'd put in some measures to make getting into the void-spots not possible, right now it's just manipulating current build mechanics to allow it and as stated, it's ridiculously easy to replicate in almost anywhere on the map (most are in cliffs and stuff like that).
---
That is a long sentence sans punctuation.
---
Cool Story Bro
---
I'm nearby and sold 5-6k worth since the vendor update
---
Just for future reference, "tree fiddy" is supposed to be 350, and it's just a reference so if you ever see it it's probably not a real offer
---
I've been dealing with this since Patch 9 too. And I submitted a support ticket yesterday about this since the dashes are still around after Patch 9.5. Here's what I got back:  
---
Met a young guy, early teens, in game friended him and we play together about once a week.  He is smart and has a more mature air than I expected, and I feel like I am running at half speed when we play together.  He is a very good player and learns quickly and he has definitely taught me some things.  That said I do keep in mind he is not an adult and I sometimes moderate myself in ways I would not with older players.
---
Two-shot? Yes, it was nerfed to +25% damage a while back. Apparently TSE does still give you twice as many +20% damage explosions though, except on shotguns.
---
There's another one at the yellow house - think it was a B &amp; B or similar.... a little NE of WS...
---
Because that line is 100% true.
---
Most people will never, ever face violence like you describe or you and I have seen.  The overwhelming vast majority, even.
---
What? The game doesn‚Äôt care about locational armor. The only locational thing is crippling, but the damage taken is still based off total ER/DR/Rad resist.
---
Twin Lake random spawns them, along with frogs, radstag, foxes, fireflys
---
I play on Dreamcast
---
Bulk junk should not be in your inventory, it's pretty obvious why.
---
I feel you but I find so much screws just walking about the wasteland I have like 20 bulk screws. Am level 65 I think
---
I was trying to bait the grammar police.
---
Weightless/Reduces fall damage is kind of a nice combo.   Light enough to keep in your inventory if you feel like jumping off a cliff.   Much better if you have a matching set, tho.
---
I got 4 urhlban scout pieces in a row lol. I was like okay I take a break from cashing these in
---
Do bottles or baseballs scrap if you build something that needs glass or leather and have none? I'm guessing they dont so the fix is likely a bit more complex than that.
---
I'm on PC, unfortunately. Thank you!!
---
You can have more than one bag - I've dropped a bag of ammo in one room in my friend's camp - went to the other side and was able to place a second bag without the first disappearing. It's a matter of distance between the bags. 
---
I also dropped a bag at munitions factory that a friend had - went and poked around the world - dropping spoiled meat etc all the while - came back to the factory and my bag with useless propaganda posters was still there
---
Sounds fair. Imo the minigun would fetch quite a bit more if it weren't for that Nocturnal roll. But I'm sure it'd still make someone very happy. Especially at a 1200c price point.
---
The forest above the vaultboy also has a random encounter.
---
Well just find a level 100 3 * legendary..and u got your drill
---
this is still an issue ive not gotten credit for discovering at least one area in each catagory preventing me from  gaining any atoms via these chalenges
---
Nobody wants to buy my toilet paper for 25 thousand caps! Absolute blasphemy!
---
Yes, yes, yes!
---
Do you have adrenaline perk? That makes your damage go up with kills, also bloody mess? Equipped or unequipped? Adrenal reaction mutation? That makes your health effect damage value
---
Don't know if you played Fallout 4 but mole rats did the same thing except there was a chance they were a raiders pet with a mine strapped to them that exploded when they popped up under you
---
Prioritize DR; most major damage in game comes from it. 
---
Finding 1 piece of legendary poison resist is a nice buff. Poison damage is rare, but otherwise unresistable. 
---
Having a baseline rad resist is a really nice QoL thing. I‚Äôd go for at least 50 once you are approaching endgame (one reason why combat armor is poor IMO. Unless you find a lot of 2star+ with (functional!) rad resist secondaries, combat armor has zero innate RR.
---
This should be stickied. But nothing is ever stickied.
---
Check at a vending machine for the accurate count. The pip boy lies.
---
The space you can build in is a sphere generated by where you initially place your camp, so the trick is placing the camp higher you've got the bottom part of the sphere to build with as well.
---
Shotguns use yellowcake flux, if I recall, so not the hardest thing to get hold of.
---
If your on ps4 and the crossbow is not taken I would buy it.
---
Fireproof 3... You're welcome
---
Outside Watoga. I'm on PC.
---
Thats not a fix. It's the employment of a god-awful communication strategy.
---
Thanks bro.
---
At least you're getting 3 stars. Still better odds than taking out a 3 star enemy and getting a 1 star piece of crap... and we've all been doing that from day 1. I think the vendor is a great addition, especially since you can get 40 scrip back if you get a piece of crap 3* from her.
---
Was already prepared.  Gotta goad the purists every once in a while.
---
Got to do the Scout quests
---
Thats it it‚Äôs time to get a mule character and give him a shitload of bulk and cooking oil
---
Specific lobby for griefers and cheats would be great actually. They can do whatever they want and leave the rest of us well alone lol.
---
This can happen when you first log on as well; specifically, you can't fast travel to camps right away, but the "normal" travel spots work for me right away
---
same here its the same places on my game total crap just another way too pressure us too spend more money on there broke ass game!!!
---
I did, do i have to earn all the badges?
---
PC. :(
---
yes, i know. the OP asked if they worked and i was giving an example of current damage numbers 
---
also i could have sworn the Fatman did not count for heavy gunner, since it is an Explosive weapon.
---
It's why I think it'd be way more handy than banning people, especially in a game rife with it. Plus it keeps their already dismally low player figures up right?  
---
Plus they could monitor how people play in those lobbies to figure out the cheats/exploits and patch them.
---
Fish would be a good substitute for Razergrain soup.
---
Yes and point was that that damage isn't distributed evenly and overall most DR has less value than perks added.
---
The primary reason I've never connected my headset while playing '76.
---
dang that is exactly my top 5. 
---
I add to those four, the mole miner gauntlet because starts at level 20 and I got a lvl20 3* god-roll that max modded it's great for levelling.
---
That sounds about right....
---
Also with friend request you can follow them to their worlds
---
You have to earn 3 of the badges to complete the questline that gives you a backpack
---
You're right, it doesn't proc from the damage perks but it does proc the weight reducing perks for "Big Guns" 
---
So something dodgy is going on there
---
I recently got a Zealot's explosive LMG drop. The next day the prime plans for it dropped so I figure why not. It's hilariously powerful against scorched. Takes about a second to kill a bat. I tend to save it for Scorched Earth now as it's expensive to run.
---
This is all excellent advice that I hope more players see. Thanks for the chuckle too; I love the way you wrote this. I'd like to see a whole series of "Numbskull's Guides."
---
That's what I thought. That was my experience. But only worked once for my own spawn then went back to randomly spawning me throughout my camp, lol. 
---
Was pretty sure other players spawns are dependant on the initial placement.
---
Yeah I dont use it..it handles 10% damage while aiming bloodied
---
You have to earn at least 3 to finish the quest.
---
So i don't have to revive a bastard undeewater! God thank you
---
Okey thanks
---
Amen brother. These are dark times indeed.
---
Mothman statue in Point Pleasant is the easiest one to server hop to find
---
If modding works the similar as in the past - that should be possible.
---
What your describing is essentially F4 modding for consoles - which was essentially remixing in-game assets. (full disclosure I've only created PC mods - never went through the hassle to test on xbox)
---
I feel however they will take a Rust / Steam workshop approach though and curate a UGC 'mod' section of the Atom shop at prices slightly under the Bethesda-made objects.
---
Might I suggest archery, athletics and swimming.
---
Lol. Got me! I more so was trying to read that sentence in my head and almost ran out of breath. The lack of punctuation kind of added to the story, especially the end, haha. It was a good read. I'll keep that in mind so I don't fall for the same trap!
---
Never! Someday Grandma Mrmgmglglflrlfrr will give me the 3 star Bloody Swing Speed +1 Strength Shovel! I shall name it the Gravedigger!
---
I definitely got one of my two serum recipe drops after the TSE nerf patch, but I can confirm that it's not in the current loot table. Possibly replaced by the jetpacks.
---
You don't have to actually have any open slots in your photo gallery for a camera pic to count toward challenges.  You'll get the message that it couldn't save, but it will still check it off your list.
---
Thanks, i will do them
---
Different people like doing different things.
---
Also why do I and the other players spawn in totally different places? When I travel to my camp it spawns me outside the building area facing away. Everyone else spawns inside next to my fusion generator in the furthest corner of my camp. I've even put lot of effort on how the camp looks outside but almost everyone just continues fast traveling from inside lol
---
Umm, not once did I complain. I stated I wish we had more cosmetic pets like the frog in a jar.
---
Please quote where I was complaining. Even once. I think you misread all my statements.
---
Took me hours at the waterpark, almost gave up when right on the car, the magical unicorn appeared
---
Almost couldnt believe it.
---
...ONLY NEEDED IT FOR THE TADPOLE BADGE, let us use photomode ):&lt;
---
For whatever reason ultracite ammo 308 crafts in 4xs the amount of normal.  It‚Äôs way smarter to
---
Prime an LMG.
---
Try launching a Nuke and then having it crash just as you get to the Nuke site...   so, yeah, we‚Äôve all had those days...
---
I‚Äôm greedy and want more than that. Im rubbish at managing my stash.
---
Skullface, US Army General, Ulysses' Duster, Ulysses' Breathing Mask... Just rip off some from Lonesome Road and most of us will be happy.
---
as a F4 modder - all I can say is there seems to be an unbelievable amount of low-hanging fruit left untouched.
---
Have a plan for your character build before you get in to deep.
---
it sounds like we live in, and were raised in very different environments
---
again, im glad you get to live in that happy safe world where nothing bad will ever happen
---
i hope reality never comes a-knockin at your door
---
take care and thank you for your service
---
Yeah it affecting your spawn seems... inconsistent. I‚Äôve had mixed results. Moved it on my alt account mule; every time he loads in, he‚Äôs in the same (new) spot vs the same (old) spot.
---
Moved it on my main? Spawned on a second floor overhang once, now back to the pre-move spawnpoint.
---
And he will scream, and his screams will haunt your dreams forever more...Won‚Äôt they Clarice?
---
Fair enough mate
---
A trick that worked for me (unfortunately it doesn't seem to work for everyone) is to travel to a location near Arktos Pharma like the Gauly Mine / Greg's mine supply (easier) and then walk up to Arktos instead of fast traveling there directly or clicking join event. This enabled me to be able to go down the elevator without crashing. I have still experienced other random crashes but this might at least get you in the door. I hope it works for you.
---
You wouldn't last through a single Destiny raid.
---
I dont mind it, clears up stash space on my hoarding character. Also, i have gotten some decent stuff just not god roll.
---
Biggest plus for me is that if i pick 3 star weap i know im getting a 3 star weap as opposed to the rng of killing a 3star mob that could drop any star and any weap or armor.
---
Just happened to me today. Did the virtual hand-slap-forehead while muttering "Stupid. Stupid! STUPID!" to myself.
---
Is the hunters long coat really that rare? I got it first try and thought it was common.
---
Found one today with towers built everywhere, and not just a plain table stacked, but a table with stuffed sheepsquatch plushies stacked on itself to the height limit. Stoves, nuka cola machines, tv's, a stack of punji boards with a sleeping bag on top.
---
I built a huge bloody house, this guy vult a monument of insanity
---
I run a bloodied rifle build, and have a bloodied vats Xbow I run around with as well. 
---
With max rifleman perks, nerd rage, bloody mess, and adrenal reaction it does around 280 dmg per shot. 
---
My recommendations? Drop glow sight to 2‚òÜ, and take 1 rank of concentrated fire full time. Drop grim reapers sprint in LCK for Serendipity; especially for bloodied builds, it's the best defensive perk. With a high AGI/LCK, most things will die well before your AP runs out.
---
I would drop 2 stars in AGI and get rid of Sandman, and raise CHR to 3, for rank 3 lone wanderer (solo), or (on team) 1 strange in numbers, 1 squad maneuver, travel agent. 3 chr also lets you take max hard bargain for vendors. Sandman is only useful 50% of the time, and is a waste of 2 slots for the rest.
---
In END, take Radicool or 1 rank of Fireproof instead of sun kissed. If you're running as bloodied, you'll most likely use rads to regulate your health, and don't want to lose them.
---
The numbers Mason, what do they mean?!
---
Me and my friend once identified the beavers as the next chance for civilization being rebuilt, so we built defense camps in the bog to protect them. It was a thankless job as they still ran away every time they saw me. My point is if you want those hides your gonna have to go through me
---
I had the same problem last night. I tried clearing the cache, rebooting the xbox, and traveling to the mine and walking to arktos, none of that worked. What I discovered is that I can join the event, and take the elevator down successfully but ONLY if I am not in power armor. I have gotten in without power armor 8-9 times now without issue.  I tried in power armor this morning and locked up.  I then immediately joined back and entered the event without power armor.
---
daaaaaaamn! nice pull!
---
Good to know! I‚Äôm working on this now actually
---
I saw this and immediately thought of Reboot and the TV character in it.
---
And what you were doing is called "lying." Violent crime is at its lowest point in the US since pretty much ever, all while violence in media is at its highest -- the opposite of what you implied.
---
I had something along those lines - I solo'd my first silo - launched on the queen!! No one showed up. Not a single person :c and back then I didn't have reddit / know about LFG to get people to join me :&lt;
---
The card will stay in there for the next time they run a silo
---
That was almost forced, but not quite. 1 upvote
---
Its descrpition says it heals you and your teammate. And it looks like a halucinogen gas cannister... :)
---
Since I solo, I wont realy use it.
---
More mutations I want that 3rd arm I was promised...
---
Is there even a reason to bulk up junk anymore?  You can sell loose scrapped junk without bulking it.
---
I guess my follow up question would be  .. Why is there no test server?
---
Of course karma isnt worth anything, it just shows if people like your posts or not.
---
That's actually one of the easier ones considering half of them are broken :D I suggest The Swimmer, Athlete, and Mammologist as the easiest myself. Revive a player in water shouldn't be too bad if you get into Arktos Pharma while the event is on - most of the rooms floors are covered in water and if not you can always find someone here willing to die for you!
---
How can you be sneaky AND drunk at the same time, them scorched will hear your hiccups a mile away.
---
yep, Bear arms just says heavy weapons. while heavy gunner specifies non explosive heavy weapons.. IMO it should work with all big guns
---
Pick up everything you see and scrap it for your stash. You will need lots of steel,screws, and springs. You can never have enough when you are starting out. Also, an easy way to get plans from the beginning is to claim workshops.
---
That's a bit naff, swear there's already perks that do that anyway
---
Server Hop in front of the Water Park. The tourist can spawn front of one of the cars. If you dont mind spending the caps for fast travel you can hit up Philippi Battlefield Cemetery (where i got mine) and Colonel Kelly Monument during each hop which are fairly close.
---
Screw him..he was obviously some sort of sex offender running around naked.  You did the wastland a favour.
---
And *that* is a whole cooler full of red herrings.
---
Holy fuck Ive only been using power armour this entire time. Considering how many bugs power armour has in this game I feel stupid for not trying. Cheers for telling me.
---
Yup luckily for the 40 you get back.  Too bad i need to wait until tomorrow to be able to scrap
---
Plus backpacks, with a ‚Äìslightly‚Äì tedious list of chores to accomplish before you can unlock them. And nerfs to explosive weaponry. And the Two Shot effect.
---
That's cute! I think the Space Station code is the 76 release date or something like that too. Bet a few of the codes are little easter eggs like that
---
I kill the all I especially enjoying eating the Beaver
---
100% agree, that's why explosive weapons aren't used unless it's an explosive legendary prefix i think.
---
Would have been fine IF they kept demo expert at 200% damage BUT prevented this proc'ing on the Legendary prefix
---
Go on bethesda site, forum section. Post it in the right topic
---
Actually I think Music is the only broken one now.
---
I made this when the game came out, it should still be mostly relevant today. [Fallout 76 tips/tricks](https://youtu.be/DPbB5M989TY)
---
It gets muffled by my mask
---
[https://imgur.com/a/6PQhHkw](https://imgur.com/a/6PQhHkw)
---
it really needs an automatic delay too, even with server notification 2-5 minutes.
---
I walked in at the exact same time as someone else and we are the only ones there. The event starts, and he instantly starts the collection phase portion of the event without waiting for anyone else.
---
I bail because even if we win it will only be with 1 animal saved and a waste of time. Let other people have time to notice/join the event.
---
Crap that means  I just lost my cat
---
Alright fine just take my upvote then
---
If your like me, most of us already have traded/bought what we wanted and use so yeah most of it‚Äôs gonna be utter junk. Nothing that vendor is gonna give is going to replace what I use anyway. It would have really been a nice addition back when I was level 40-50 and using really crap weapons. So no, I didn‚Äôt give up on it because it‚Äôs still something to do. Too bad it didn‚Äôt take caps because that would be the real cap sink Bethesda needed.
---
I've been going with two star, and it's been pretty decent.  Most of the time the third star is pretty negligible, so I go with the option that makes more economic sense.  It's cheaper, and I can recycle more of them before hitting the scrip limit.
---
I don't think your perks matter.  I've got all the rifle perks, and I still get heavy weapons.
---
You mean at your camp?  You don't need to be in your camp any more to sell things, the bug where item details wouldn't show up if you were away has been fixed.
---
Get your point but with my 3 fatmen i am overnecumbered again and cant fasttravel anymore.  Tomorrow is scrapping day
---
Give it a go and let me know if that works. It did work for a friend I play with also, but he is the only one I've had confirm it.  I posted this a couple times last night but I didn't get any feedback.
---
Yea, the daily limit sucks a bit. But if it wasnt for that, you would just have everyone hammering whitesprings and getting 50 3 stars a day ha!
---
Blast Radius! Time to blow up the whole family!
---
You should farm for what you want AND put the crap in the moley persons shredder and if you get crap from her put that in the shredder as well.  Perseverance will payoff, quitting will not.
---
Yea, this happens to me off and on but the vending machine seems to always have accurate count.
---
In Fallout lore, all the screwdrivers are flat heads but all the screws are phillips. It's a brutal world.
---
That is sick
---
Is this some sort of peasent joke I'm to rich to understand? 
---
If you don't like the prices DO NOT buy anything. It is free world. You are a free person. It is your choice. Stop complaining and move on. 
---
In case it is You Tovarishch Gorbatchov, You are absolutely right. Prices are to high. We need to interfere. Immediately!!!
---
Cooking's also not bad. Getting some of the recipes and royal jelly is annoying, but otherwise it's pretty easy.
---
i personally would like to see the current demo expert apply to explosive prefix, and the old numbers apply to dedicated explosive weapons
---
I seriously doubt that. I know Bethesda changed alot with FO76 but I dont think theyd reduce the Fallout series to mini games.
---
It's is also affected by the Grounded mutation's negative energy weapon to damage unfortunately.
---
Have you seen them in the actual atom shop yet - I looked yesterday and I couldn't find them at all.
---
Damn! Never thought about that! Now that you point it out it sure is!
---
My question. Does it function as a gas mask?
---
You have recovered from rad worms
---
.0005 secs later 
---
*sees ghoul 100 feet away 
---
You have contracted rad worms
---
...Or ballistic fiber from armor. Even if it was ballistic scrap to make fiber...
---
Cant you just ask someone who knows the plans to craft you a level 50? I would craft it no problem
---
true, that is the reason I play these Fallout games and no other games.
---
They cleary offer us a patern to follow (main quest, events, build..), but we have freedom to do very different things.
---
Knew there was something I could forget
---
I have the same roll with my railway rifle, it is a pleasure to use.
---
Sadly, no. I wish it did, but, to be fair, it‚Äôs just a leather mask with herbs stuffed inside to deal with bad smells. Hardly gas mask material.
---
Think so
---
I'm a bit dehydrated from reading this post. 10/10.
---
I could run with that, i just thought about it in terms of stopping the "explosive weapon meta" that's currently going around, would hurt the duped economy of legacy explosive weapons too. But i could happily have your change too. Anyone using actual explosive weapons have it hard rn

Did 3 last night. All PUG as I mostly solo. 2 wins, one loss. First was learning, and we seemed to have been hyper feeding one pet only, then kept him alive. Second was chaos, no one but myself was feeding, and struggled to keep the wolf alive. Last was better with people protecting each. I suspect team healing helps the animals btw, as I saw health bars going up.
---
Wear a wedding ring that now has 1 DR added XD
---
And so many jetpacks lawd have mercy
---
&gt;PvE isn't gory
---
[Bloody Mess](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk=1230) is a perk that literally "means enemies may explode into a gory red paste."
---
Well don't fast travel to my player vending!
---
You can‚Äôt have vendors set up on alternate/mule characters. Will reset everything even if you don‚Äôt log onto the character.
---
It makes sense with the vending and weight of weapons and armor.
---
I don‚Äôt have an alt/mule. Just the one character
---
Roger roger.
---
Ah I see that point, I've never really been in a chat room invite with all friends thing, but I would try to put that fellow in check right quick, I'd say, you brought your kid into an adult conversation, so don't expect catering.
---
i wonder how many pictures of glitches they are getting.. lol
---
Does no one use bird bones? I use it with marsupial, healing factor and twisted muscles. Love jumping off high places without pa
---
Yes! If you look in the direction of the silo, about a minute or two into the launch sequence, if you look hard enough, you can see a missile fly out.
---
I have been able to. Did you check to make sure you have stims? You can't revive players with diluted stims
---
Ah but at the time, it was thought to protect from the plague! I am disheartened.
---
I moved from whitesprings to the ash heap, it‚Äôs kind of strange because it‚Äôs in the ash heap that you kind of have to see when looking at whitesprings but the act of my camp simply being in the black spot means my customer rate has dropped drastically, I think I‚Äôve gotten maybe 4 people in the 2 days I‚Äôve been here meanwhile at whitesprings I couldn‚Äôt play for more then 15 minutes without someone buying something. Thing is, I‚Äôm really enjoying the ash heap so Im hesitating to move back
---
This has been happening to me on and off for a month.
---
Then craft one and stunt your luck and int.
---
I started again with second character,  no quests until level 50.
---
I guess its a good thing I got my swimming badge 2 days ago..
---
I have not tried since then
---
I NEVER trade for Weapons there. The pool is far too large. I go for armor instead. It's cheaper and I get a ton of great roll items I can trade or sell later, plus I've nearly completed a good Scout set for myself.
---
Then again, I have a colossal collection of Legendaries that I've been Scriping (Is that the word we're using?) every day since the Legendary Machines were added.
---
I think it's viable if you use the perk that increases the healing power of stimpacks and class freak to supres the negative.
---
I actually think this should happen because of the player vending.  That extra 200 should be vending storage.
---
It's been hit or miss with me on xbox
---
I actually did start a new character and I have! My end build will probably end up the same because I am ultimately a creature of habit but I have people to actually level with / help me level this time. I went ahead and got my backpack right off the bat! I've been pacing myself on the quest lines instead of doing them as soon as I get them. I spent a lot of time trying to build as I went along when I first started - spent a lot of time at my camp and this time I haven't bothered at all - relying on Whitesprings/Overseer's/ Friend's camps for workbench needs!
---
Same here. Having so many challenges effectively locked off every content update is really frustrating.
---
yeah ofc they do ,they also promised more transparency months ago...which only happened to a small amount
---
that's why it was a joke with the "fixed" part...because you don't fix a discrepancy between your advertisement and the in-game product by changing the advertisement afterwards....oh wait...where have I seen this before?
---
I just stimpak'd another player. Works on PS4 at least, and for me.
---
Quick, put up a missing poster!
---
hit up vendors ASAP..
---
I‚Äôll give that a shot. Thanks man :)
---
It‚Äôs a shit show since the update. It‚Äôs like they rolled the game back to December
---
I run a build of sorts, I can kill the boss solo in literally 30 seconds.
---
Magazines dude, not maps
---
Ah this is my problem then. Thank you!
---
same here
---
Dude I look sick though lol I killed myself with my tesla and look so bad ass with a blue saiyan aura around me
---
Kid's got a great role model. Shame he's gonna grow up to *vote.*
---
So does each factions vendors have a separate cap reserve?
---
Any gun you can rename to Choo Choo Pew Pew and have it make sense is worth it.
---
Not just then. It happens to me throughout playing.
---
US Army General, US Army Combat Armor, heck maybe some X-02 armor from FO3 and I just might die happy.
---
I‚Äôd rather have bone worms
---
I will pm you
---
Realize Luck is a good special
---
I've been able to with no issue yet. Double check that you have normal stimpacks as super and diluted won't count.
---
Yea didn't work.
---
How about asking for them to fix current issues before adding in more things that will just be bugged.
---
Yeah one thing I hate about adventure is there is no actual PVP. It's all a gimmick/ gank / trick.
---
People who invite to team who are already pvp with their friend ... people who do this role a dope you describe. .. people who run around post queen to see who they can snag for their scrap.
---
ü§∑ a few specifics, like the PvP dmg ones, maybe the Unstoppables, but generally no, they're not super valuable. Try putting them in your Vending Machine for 40-100 and see if you get any takers
---
for catching the REALLY big fish
---
Some mods have instructions on how to make a proper Fallout76custom.ini file. I include concise instructions on my mod pages that first time mod users can follow. I also include instructions on how to update your ini file for when the game gets updated. Here's one of the mods that I put together: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/299
---
Yes pvp is still enabled. Also be careful as the popup may not show up and you get ganked outta nowhere.
---
X03.
---
This was by far the easiest imo..only took a few hours for my buddy and I to finish these up.
---
Uh, you don't get shadowed leather mods from scrapping.
---
As for why it's not showing, have you used the plan? Sounds obvious, but it happens.
---
If you've used the plan, are you checking the right mod slot for it?
---
If you've done all that, and it still isn't showing, send a bug report to Bethesda.
---
well sh*t. I thought I had it figured out.
---
Tbh I think most just don't know what to do, first time I was there I didn't have a clue, I was already in there when the event popped up and there was no cues as to what I should be doin, nothing about feeders or protecting animals.
---
The Hellfire? Oh heck yes
---
Wait 2years till everything is fixed. (It was good between patch 8 and 9)
---
This one time, I got a White Powder jumpsuit but I scrapped or sold it. Don't remember which one, but I believe I sold it. Don't really care about it though.
---
I know I was saying it‚Äôs hit in miss for what ppl buy magazines for cap wise... and since u said you just came back I was saying if you have maps id buy them cuz I always buy but Forest.
---
All 3 are the exact same thing.
---
This was called the Halo hop back in the day ;)
---
Indeed! The dominant theory of disease transmission at the time was the miasma theory, which theorized that bad smells transmitted ‚Äúbad air‚Äù which would cause disease. Thus, the doctors made the masks hollow to fill with flowers and herbs such as mint, or vinegar, to ward off the miasma, as they would breathe in the good smelling stuff as opposed to the outside air.
---
Legendary 3 star Fisherman's Trusty Rubber boot - Left leg -  +40% Better chance to catch fish while standing in water +10% faster cast rate+1 fishing skill
---
Please don't take offense but I don't suggest doing this. 
---
Screws, springs, adhesive, ballistic fiber, sure. Pick up as much as possible but most other resources you only need a bunch when building your camp. Steel is probably one of the most common material and you can usually find it readily.
---
UV because I've been waiting for path to enlightement  Event for a week.....
---
I figure players like this washout of survival mode.
---
Two shot isnt awesome on gauss.  My favorite is a quad/ ffr. You really need to charge and headshot.
---
Agreed.  
---
Arktos pharma, Encryptid, and Free range all are highly team oriented and yet don't notify people.
---
I've always believed that r/Fallout is an anti-76 echo chamber and this one's between being an echo chamber and not being one. Look at the amount of anti-76 sentiment in r/Fallout to be honest.
---
Thought so,thanx!
---
I will never sell serums for less than 500. It‚Äôs too easy to turn a profit from them from robot vendors if they‚Äôre sold for anything less. Ppl selling them cheap probably duped them and don‚Äôt care.
---
I know. I love it. I‚Äôm making more caps then ever selling legendarys.
---
None taken! We all play differently.
---
I think about a week longer than the camera actually, because it's release date got delayed a week but the challenges calendar did not ü§¶
---
No prob.
---
Yeah, I kinda missed that, but the point of my post still stands.
---
I know grinding is a big part of the game mate I've been there and done it and still doing it.
---
I'm just having a spit at the moment because I'm scraping hand mades for mods and i've got lots of other junk but keep running out of screws because they don't return any after you scrap a freshly made rifle.
---
"You are suffering from rad worms."
---
Excuse me, I am ENJOYING my disease, thank you very much.
---
I'd be stupid to sell them for 250 caps less than I can get from a vendor. Yes there are dupers out there and if you want to buy from them go for it. I'm not going to rip myself off though. Gotta look out for #1.
---
Yes and yes. Is it just me that cant make them? I have 500 hours in the game I know I'm not doing anything wrong here
---
Diamond City Radio is the best Fallout radio to have existed. Fight me!
---
Haha, I always say "well, bye bye plastic" aloud to myself. ü§£
---
If every new feature (brewing, fermenting, vending, future display cases) is going to rely on stash space we need more stash space.
---
Once they up it to 1k we still won‚Äôt be happy lol. Try managing a 400lb stash. Now that was difficult
---
I have my carry weight higher than the original stash limit. Of course I'm going to upvote this.
---
The scary thing is when you're not looking at them....
---
They move....
---
Have you played the Project Paradise event yet?  It‚Äôs similar by a long shot. But it‚Äôs hard to get max rewards as it‚Äôs DOA cuz bugs.
---
No shit.
---
Tbh, scrapping in general could use a balance pass. Way to few reliable sources of screws.
---
I'd settle for more camp budget.
---
And cow bell.
---
Still wondering why I can‚Äôt fish or go hit a tree with a hatchet for wood
---
This sums up half of this sub
---
 Armor with weapon weight reduction would still work on mods because the "magic" of the armor is telling the weapon as a whole to weigh less. The Grandfather's Axe Paradox is still going to be the best way to explain it as a whole. Just like if you picked up "weightless" armor and say it's pocketed. The mods are specific because that's what makes it legendary. It's a lot easier to wrap your head around a legendary enemy acquiring the weapon from a fallen "hero" among their group "this was Un'gak's flame-sword, I weild for Un'gak's memory" slowly the item becomes tinkered with and becomes legendary. The part you add, won't be a legendary part of the item until you die, and one of your comrades picks up the weapon and wilds it in your honor/memory.
---
Like Waterworld lol üòÇüòÇ
---
I would love to be able to "track" any chosen public events to be notified when they are active.
---
On PC the only time I have anything close to the stated issue
---
"Unable to click in map object to fast travel"
---
Is right after I load into a server. I have to wait for the world to fully populate all item (slow camp loading), all players and their camps. One that is done then j can click on a destination and travel
---
Yeah with the new vending and punch bowl features requiring stash space, this seems like an eminently reasonable request.
---
I was collecting legendaries since legendary scraping machines went live. I am now carring over 100lbs of legendaries, because of that daily limit. Your idea is great, i love it, but developers want you to throw legendaries away and scrap only few of them, idealy play 30minutes daily and rest time spend using camera heavily drunk.
---
Allow us to scrap more a day that‚Äôs the real problem I can only get 2 3* roles a day and if they are bad sorry I have to wait a day to try again
---
oh right. Forgot. Are serum plans still going for 3500 caps on the website that's not supposed to be named?
---
Make sure you have normal stimpaks. You cannot revive downed players with diluted or super stimpaks.
---
For Xbox, join off a gamertag when inspecting a player on the map.
---
Nice. I didn‚Äôt realize that. Thanks. I have fireproof 3, it wasn‚Äôt equipped. üôÑ
---
Gotta be full naked for that. An Apparel piece means you could still have armor underneath, and kick ass while looking fly
---
Hardened if u use it for more than the queen. Prime if you use it exclusively for the queen. Prime needs special ammo tho which can be difficult to keep up with (ultracite)
---
I took a vintage nukashine and woke up in Scandinavia. Costs me 43520 caps to fast travel back... So I will miss the next 16 upcoming meetings.
---
But just in case you forgot, be sure to check your missile state holotape BEFORE going into a silo. They are identical on the inside, but if somebody has used a silo recently on that server, you can't use that specific silo for a few hours afterwards
---
Are the normal powered door plans tied with the doors with the keypad? I'll re-check again to see. Maybe I need the Science Perk or home defense to construct?
---
Its just caps are really easy to earn, so its kinda hard to not want to just trade for top tier stuff. Thats fine and makes sense
---
I'm not OP bud
---
I'm just waiting for them to implement a casino with table games. Let me play blackjack, dammit! If they want to control the cap economy, this would be a great way to do it.
---
What about a one life only hardcore challenge. I think it would be very intense !
---
Maybe it could take place on like Hawaii?
---
I don't have that mod unlocked, would have been nice to have.
---
Yea I‚Äôve done it once or twice but I loved the theme of POE. Project Paradise is probably a good alt though.
---
Yep, been around since release. As u/TazBaz stated, just build the turrets on another camp object -- I use shelves, and can fit two turrets on each. When they disappear, just store the shelf, and the "missing" turrets will store with it, then you can place them all again as a workaround.
---
Ahhhhh the magic, forgot about that.
---
True, they just need to give back X amount of items that you made the weapons with, instead of just wood and steal
---
Couldn't you somehow blueprint it and build it again from there?
---
I swear if I see another Mr Handy Buzz Blade in a vendor shop I'm going to lose it.
---
Is this a go back in time thing?
---
I'd live in nuked Whitespring like so many did farming decent legendaries and gobs of XP before both got nerfed.
---
I'd buy all the serum recipes from MODUS before they jacked the prices sky high.
---
And I'd do more queens earlier.
---
Oh, and of course, fewer weight reduction perk cards that get you addicted because you're 2k lbs the moment you try to take them off.
---
Oh for the Archery I just went to the bunkers in the swamp for the 50 kills there's about 7-8 radroaches killem and server jump till 50
---
With player vending out now, stash should be increased as we are vendors now
---
Rip all that plastic.
---
I was able to store my cat topiary and place it back down post patch yesterday
---
like you said. this game isn‚Äôt made for all. it‚Äôs an 18+ for a reason and this is an unpopular opinion apparently but under 18s shouldn‚Äôt be playing it at all tbh and game platforms should do a better job of controlling that
---
Agreed! Or telescreens from 1984.
---
You learn weapon and armor mods by scrapping those items. Fortunately weapons "tier up" every 10 levels (until level 45-50) so scrap away. 
---
However some have more than others and all are finite. Also they are subject to rng so at some point either stop collecting them or sell them. There is no guarantee you have learned everything but you'll go crazy trying to unlock it all.
---
I know all that, what I‚Äôm asking is which has a better damage rating
---
We always need more cowbell.
---
It's not hard to do if your primary method of playing currently is shopping and/or legendary farming.
---
Or just do to it like deathclaw hands, bloodbug probiosis, and beer bottles
---
Thx for the warning!im a big noob still:)if you have any other tips...
---
You could finally get Whitesprings the papers they need to reopen the hotel!
---
No, steal is not an object. Steal is a verb meaning to take something without consent. Example: I plan to STEAL his virginity. The word you‚Äôre looking for is steel which is a metal created by Henry Bessemer
---
They need to nerf the serum prices. Make them sell for 100 each. Within a week all the mutation millionaires will be broke.
---
Bethesda did a horrible job of explaining how this event works. Just give it a couple more days for everyone to fully figure out what‚Äôs going on.
---
I moved my C.A.M.P. after the update, stored my blueprints and was able to re-place them.
---
I just meant I‚Äôve been using a looooot of time building. Probably more than out fighting. But now I feel I‚Äôm in the need of a new rifle. 
---
I‚Äôm a lone wanderer with non-auto rifles. 
---
Made a bad-ass ‚Äòall star chain wrapped bat‚Äô for those low level mobs who doesn‚Äôt deserve a gauss-shot. 
---
So That handmade was actually my first useable legendary drop I‚Äôve ever had. 
---
Spent 300 hours atm
---
Black Flag
---
I remember that. It was hard. I was perma overencumbered until they raised it to 600 them to 800.
---
Civilians can‚Äôt be trusted with the amount of torque a Phillips can put out.
---
I don't PvP. No point. Didn't even know of this base until today. That being said, using this base isn't cheating. That's ignorant talk.
---
Were do i get this tape tho?
---
Is this your first day playing video games? How could you, with a straight face, post that you don't want kids playing the game? If you don't want to interact with kids, an interactive video game is not for you.
---
I agree with this. Let us have an extra 200 for the vending machines.
---
800 is more than enough, I'm not saying this as a "OMG GET GUD" player.
---
I would absolutely be on board for a PoE style dungeon if and only if it is done correctly.  PoE was so fun with real bosses (well, mini bosses I guess).  But they would have to add more loot into the game and not just the current loot table.
---
This is great! Thank you
---
Hmm. My Deathclaw definitely vanished. I guess like all things Bethesda, it's inconsistent.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know we could get armor mods from scraping armor. It‚Äôs literally never happens to me yet.
---
My daughter and I play.
---
She's more of a builder than anything but I don't let her on mic for two reasons.
---
So she doesn't annoy people with the fact that she's a child.
---
So she's not exposed to any foul language other than mine WHEN I GET THAT GODDAMNED SHIT BALLED WOODEN CRAP ASS PISS ARMOR!
---
&gt;'temporary' set of stairs
---
I tried that once.  Ended up with  2 permanent sets of stairs and floors that  still stubbornly refused to go.
---
Congratulations you're the first person to correct my mistake.
---
IT only took 224 likes and 66 comments.
---
Charging shotgun barrel is my favorite
---
Max out Action boy
---
Still nothing for high level bullet sponges?
---
there are still people with dosens of accounts with duped items which wasn't deleted for some reason. Serums are not big deal compare to this
---
But he's going to beat your ass out. Which, I take it, is something terrible. I'd probably be afraid if I knew what the fuck he was talking about.
---
Do you have level 3 armoror perk card unlocked , I know for deep pockets you need it I‚Äôm not 100 percent on this but it‚Äôs a option to check
---
I agree. I manage my stash very well, and people buying my items makes even more room. But, with all the added content and constant gathering/collecting, 800 just doesn't cut it
---
You can only sell the just you cannot bulk. Look at the value, if the value is 0 it can be bulked , and must be bulked to be sold to vendors.
---
While we‚Äôre on the subject... is there an actual AP regent star number that‚Äôs viewable in the pop boy somewhere?
---
im gonna make him vote for all the gross bad people too
---
he will be unstoppable
---
Yea just like PoE had themed armor &amp; weapons. Special items you could get only by doing that activity.
---
Let‚Äôs see it
---
Im still waiting for a fix for DTS.
---
Username checks out.
---
On Xbox. My fix to the crash has been waiting at my base for a few minutes and wait for the whole world to load. Or join the event directly from your fully loses baee
---
Nah. Its not hurting anyone for people's camp to be there. You can just ignore them.
---
And you got all the other "way of the tadpole" challenges done?
---
Clean kiddie corner
---
Stings and things aka clear out dolly sods
---
Revive a player
---
Hahaha how else would you describe legendary effects in world. Willpower? The Force? "This mini nuclear warhead launcher shoots two exploding nuclear explosives at the same time that then break off into like 14 smaller explosive nuclear warheads, and my armor makes me crazy stronk when I'm gonna die." The glass candles are burning in Westerosi Virginia, radioactive dragons have awoken from the earth and magic is alive.
---
I can't post it
---
What format are you on? I'm PS4.
---
HAH, rip man!
---
I think people assume that if you're West of whitesprings you are low level and selling non legendary items. We really need a legendary counter on camp status in the map. It can be very disappointing to pay the travel caps for a bunch of standard guns when you are higher level
---
Nah, no reason to give up, as many ass legendaries as the game‚Äôs rn spits out. Always worth a reroll
---
Anybody saying more stash space being a ba
---
d thing is either a troll or... actually no they are a troll.
---
You might be better off adjusting your schedule, then: if you go for 3* ranged (like I do), visit her every other day after you've accumulated 300 scrip (for three pulls from the lottery), but (and this is important) when the scrip machine has another 150 scrip available for you.
---
This way, if you get heavy junk items, you can simply go outside and scrip them again. Only takes some self-control to not immediately cash in those 300 scrip.
---
Or you could, you know, just equip Bear Arms and fast travel again, no matter what. ;-)
---
Instructions unclear, just sat around waiting for the alpha to spawn.
---
it does, but the issue is, it takes up ur hotkey (D-pad if ur console) bar. My hotkey bar is already filled with Armor Switches and Chem/Stim combos
---
Friendly fire is off during events, even on survival mode.
---
Cool story, but nothing to worry about.
---
Serums are a much bigger problem than duped weapons. Few people duped in the first place. Everyone sells serums, everyday, multiple characters. Someone with a bunch of duped weapons is probably only selling  on occasion or for cash. No one is making a fortune or doing dozens of deals a day selling tse guns
---
&gt;and starts it by accessing the computer
---
Is it possible to be in the terminal but not start the event? Like idle in the menu to "lock" the randos out of it until a few minutes have passed?
---
yeahp
---
That's a great idea. Desperate times require desperate measures. Mine hasn't worked yet, despite a lvl190 with bird bones giving it a go :-) [https://i.imgur.com/a1SISGC.png](https://i.imgur.com/a1SISGC.png)
---
True.. There's really no excuse why this isn't a thing yet lol.
---
Well if u read the stats, it‚Äôs the same dmg output but has 30% increase against scorched. Do the math
---
By what logic?  
---
Let's put it this way, in PvP I could snipe you out from across the map, without you being able to see me or know the direction and you could be a complete newbie. I'm seeing a lot more level 5-40s running around survival and that means they'll be in Charleston due to the missions. So they'll be right in the line of fire. I'd agree if it was \*\*ON\*\* the building but this is something abusing a problem with the game and exploiting to gain a significant advantage.
---
Hehe.  Cat bush.  Hehe.
---
Waiting for a Bethesda game to be fixed? Without mods?
---
Good luck with that.
---
Different build. I recently reached lvl 50 with my 2nd character. First played as an unarmed main with my first character and then as a heavy main with power armor with my second character. Very different experience after gaining access to heavy weapons.
---
I was a chronic hoarder with my first character and now I need a mule character (most likely my next character) to transfer my stuff so that I can properly use my unarmed character.
---
You might be mistaking confusion for caring...  it was DAY ONE of the event, people haven't seen the giant freaking room-maze before, haven't seen the 3 mystery substances before, haven't seen the looks like a "need 3 things" but actually "just keep filling it" meter before.  Some folks have trouble locating (not terribly obvious) objectives while keeping the invisiblelasermurderbots away. And then there is that firstforthegame level 100 \*\*\* enemy that actually kills high level players. #funonabun  
---
Make friends, bring a team. Share some perks. #putthemultibackinmultiplayer
---
Do the backpacks increase carry weight?
---
More camp budget!
---
More stash space!
---
Lmaoooo oh man, thanks for the laugh
---
Hardcore man
---
I think bugs/disconnects/and severe lag turned me off from the start. I‚Äôll try it again at a later date.
---
Did you move your camp? When I moved camp all items in vending machines went back in my stash.
---
I think it's pretty simple. Bugs that impact the game economy? Higher priority than bugs that have workarounds and don't impact the game economy.
---
I don't think so XD
---
I feel like people are mistaking the concept of a "Raid" with a Dungeon.
---
Dungeons are just a sealed up area with stuff to loot and enemies to kill. Maybe a few locked/puzzled/trapped rooms. If you've ever played a tabletop you know Dungeons are just a place, there isn't *necessarily* a ton going on there all the time every time.
---
Whereas the MMO concept of a "Raid" is much bigger and more elaborate, requiring lots of different people doing different things needed to succeed. That's where "instanced" locations became synonymous with group raids, to handle ready-to-go groups of players that wanted to be prepared for how elaborate it would be.
---
76 doesn't have a LFG system to prep a whole team for an instanced raid. All they have is Events to use as their mechanic instead, and it's functionally much different.
---
Bethesda just isn't gonna bring us full on "Raids" in the way you're thinking of. Just "Dungeons", where there's new stuff to kill or steal, and they're calling our attention to most of them through Events because it's the only way to assemble an ad-hoc group to play with, since everything is on a timer and there's no lfg system in place.
---
Still beats The Burrows amiright?
---
I‚Äôd love it if they made our weight reduction perks apply to stash to be honest, keep it 800 but let perks apply, then our stash would be like 5000
---
I put mine in the vending machine at 999 to try to prevent it from autoscrapping but apparently they're not safe there either. 
---
And since, for God knows why, the order of required materials used when crafting still goes raw material &gt; materials in junk item &gt; bulk materials, instead of raw material &gt; bulk materials &gt; materials in junk item, anything we'd want to keep in junk besides raw materials inevitably ends up scrapped. Adi√≥s Fasnacht beersteins, royal jelly, cooking oil, prewar money, insect parts, etc.
---
Whitesprings bunker if you dont already have it from completing the one of us quest.
---
Bethesda should have mentioned it in the patch notes or something...
---
Sertith :)

If they keep adding things that take up stash limits, it stands to reason that the amount we need should increase as well. Gatekeeping people because you used to have it worse isn't a good reason not to change.
---
Also on PS4 and wouldn;t mind getting in a team who know what they're doing against the fake sheepsquatch and pharma.
---
Ah, the classic days of Trade/Barrens Chat
---
Its almost like they WANT their long time fans to leave, at this point...
---
FYI, according to their patch notes they have since fixed this problem.
---
As for the Flatwoods Monster, they haven't removed his encounter - it's just extremely rare.
---
Some random encounters are also restricted. I.e. a crashed satellite isn't allowed to show up in certain places where the terrain doesn't support it. I don't know for certain that the flatwoods monster is a restricted encounter like that, but from where I and other people have observed him spawn he probably is.
---
You are correct. They can‚Äôt do that anymore. This happened to me before New Year, when you could still stack bobs and mags. Before Beth scaled back PVP damage per hit. It was easy to deal 10k or more dmg on the first hit. Getting your armor broke was real then
---
Just keep trying toolboxes. If you want to do the quest, i had luck at the kelly monument near the battlefield cemetary.
---
Just loged in and checked,i have it!thanx
---
I think that's a great use for the personal computer tbh, go through and set your personal event notifications and when they pop up it let's you know.
---
I know this is 10 days old now but just wanted to toss a thanks for finding this out I was just trying to find this out for my alt character that's a stealth sniper
---
Next: Revive an ally in water.  GL with that
---
The Tax is to stop inflation so that wouldn‚Äôt work
---
Reviews from sites are usually the first week, thats why many end up doing like a revisit a year later. Unfortunately people go off of those months after release
---
This
---
There is a silver lining to the story. My friend who likes heavy guns just happened to have another one in his stash just chilling and gave it to me for free that afternoon. I've been working hard to repay his kind generosity since. It's good to have friends in this game- preferably with a different build to yourself! Great for ammo exchange too.
---
More than one person can access a computer at a time unfortunately, but we still tried, and they still went right ahead and started it. They stood to the side of my buddy accessing the comp and started it up, while me and another friend melee‚Äôd them constantly and emoted the thumbs down. Gotta love clueless solo players, assuming (hoping) it was a kid.
---
Max action boy as stated above, max lone wanderer and 3 pieces of AP refresh gear. Cola nut maxed and nuka cherry/quantum for true burst potential.
---
Just like the vendors. 20 hours.
---
I've had a Mole rat dig out of a boardwalk to get me. I was like...but how??
---
its not real tax.. its a sink
---
BTW the only way some one could steal ones virginty is by rapping them.
---
So maybe next time you should think before you write and use a different example of "Steal"
---
It did show the red Atom symbol but that didn't prevent me from placing it from Stored.
---
Booooo. Sorry to hear that.
---
Indubitably.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was a bad idea. Just reminiscing about old times.
---
So just like that one mission in Fallout 4 then
---
You could do that without a camp being there. If you ar angry about PvP adavatnages then there are way more pressing issues. Bloodied builds, infinite invisibility, vats immunity, vats bug where every shot misses until you exit vats and then go back into vats, spawn camping, ect.
---
If you are, we need more demons.
---
I try to sell at a pretty hefty discount, with a lot of freebies.  People seem to appreciate it, and it's not like you win a prize for having the most caps or anything.
---
&gt;The server can't handle it blah blah
---
Players: The server can't handle it!
---
Bethesda: Let's give everybody tons of keys and password notes they can't drop after after they finish the quests, forcing players to carry around tons of unwanted inventory items they'll never use. But at least they all weigh 0!
---
You are the kind of person I aspire to be more like.
---
The best way to show you don't care is to keep talking about it to someone who thinks you're garbage.
---
i dont mind
---
Bethesda cant make complex. At least not and keep it functioning. 
---
I wanted to like this game, but it's just so, so bad in every way.
---
No I haven‚Äôt moved my camp since player vending was released
---
Id like to play chess
---
Oh, I forgot, some people are still insecure assholes that think any question about the game is toxic. So those assfucks are gonna down vote you. But if you get a -1 on a thread itself, that's probably bots. 
---
They're the same people that when you say "why don't we have (insert thing from FO4 that has no logical reason for not being in FO76)" you get "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IF U HaTe tHE GAme Y R u sTill PLayINg", there's no winning with them, so I just ignore them.
---
I actually did that one. Found a drill sitting on a table (sorry forgotten where) and Squirrels spawn near Graninger Farm pretty often. Had build a few of the weapons to finish it off but the Drill one was the hard part.
---
Rapping is a verb used to define a type of music. I think the word you‚Äôre looking for is raping. Example: I will be RAPING your dad tonight
---
I got a medics lmg that shoots the exploding bullets.
---
Dog food is the best source of food while using the Good Dogy perk card. Doesn't spoil and is very light compared to meat.
---
Right, however if they could incorporate the tax into the game (since it‚Äôs literally just caps disappearing) they could incorporate some sort of lottery or even a project that would be player paid for.  I get the inflation worry...but caps shouldn‚Äôt just disappear in a (essentially) player run server. With no npcs there is really no need for the taxes. They aren‚Äôt going to the vendors, they don‚Äôt go to the players, and the tax does nothing for the game right now.
---
You should join r/fo76creations and post all your crazy finds on there!
---
that's a fucking excellent idea.
---
Lol I take back my nuclear river comment the whole woods just plunged into a radioactive storm of some sort. Awesome feature.
---
Just to add - Non Tamable.
---
And another user posted in a different thread, stop bulk items from being auto salvaged during mass salvage. Pain in the ass re-bulking everything.
---
It‚Äôs gone from a 3 to an 8 over the course of bug fixes, added content, attention to detail, etc.  It definitely earned some of its negative image, but a lot of it comes as YouTube influencers riding on the coat tails of the ‚Äúcool‚Äù topic.  It still needs work without a doubt before it even comes near something resembling polished.  
---
For those of us that have been here, seeing the intention mixed with fair communication in most cases makes it worth the ride.... or for those I communicate with about it anyway.
---
If you have any "improved repair kits" and the weapons are below 150%, you can use the kits and it counts towards the badge...
---
Yes. 60 lb extra carry weight for a max level standard backpack, and then there are several upgrades, available to unlock after a bit more of grinding, including high capacity (another 60 lb), refrigerator, armor, and shielded. Can only use one upgrade per backpack, though, but you can have as many backpacks as you like, and switch between them as necessary.
---
The one near Harper's Ferry is Non Tamable.
---
Hey Bethesda, how about to stop fucking everything up worse than it already is? 
---
Sincerely

#DeadGame
---
I have found that while trying to delete things in my camp--Is that there is an order to things and usually one has to start deleting with the last piece laid usually takes care of 90% of it---its like unzipping something you just can't start in the middle--- I still get random floaters though--but also I haven't built after this patch yet
---
I never call for help anymore. More than 50% probability of junk vulchers swooping over. I try and die fast so they can't see where i went down
---
Definitely seems like it. I was pretty nervous purchasing that the game was gonna ruin the fallout series for me. Have been playing since fallout 3 and have been a huge fan of the games since.
---
Or a possible "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
It's cool it worked for you, but the first picture isn't in any kind of storm, it's a picture from outside a storm? Of course that wouldn't work.
---
Anyway, I'm totally fine with them meaning rad storm, but I still think they should say rad storm, and not just "stormy weather".
---
They removed it as well as the prisoner collar 1dr and the other 1dr items that were unintentionally made
---
More songs and randomize the tracks.
---
For PvP automatic is the best, no competition.
---
It's a pretty decent game imo - there's a lot of bugs and a lot of things that could be different but I enjoy my time in the wasteland and I have over 800 hours so far. I am glad you picked it up and enjoy it and the really green trees bother me too after spending so much time with 3 DAWG AWOOOO "Have you ever seen a tree?"
---
Seneca Rocks.
---
Lone wanderer only gets shutdown if I team up with someone, right?
---
On my latest play through I finally worked out that you can break Armor down for mods. So I‚Äôd start doing that sooner.
---
 There should be a prize for whoever pays the most tax, or at least a thing that keeps track of it.
---
Musican is still bugged for me.
---
Desperate times...   if they weren‚Äôt afk in a secure location, they‚Äôre fair game
---
Try to find another recipe for shadowed arms and check if it is \*Known\*. Also leather armor have separate plans for shadowed legs and arms, not like some other types of armor that have combined shadowed limbs recipes.
---
I used to run a Zealot handmade, and I think it was a marginal improvement when fighting the Queen?  Honestly, it was hard to tell, given all her damage reduction.
---
Your mileage may very. I got my godroll axe on my first roll, then I‚Äôve been rolling armor ever since. I‚Äôve managed to get some upgrades for my two characters. Others are worth selling or they‚Äôre going back into the wood chipper.  And, I still have a bunch from my mules to scrap.
---
Dude just build some Vending Machines. Ammo usually sells quick from them if you price it cheap.
---
Every weapon in game came from a player looting a creature or getting a reward. No caps or trades are required.
---
They should do more creative ones, in order to get people to go back to certain areas or events.
---
I am just an anxious wreck and I go to great lengths to avoid awkwardness and confrontation. It's a bit of a blessing and a curse.
---
Let you know so you dont make the same mistake i did.
---
Lol I have 45 kits
---
You can tame cats, but be prepared for heartbreak, every single "non-agro" creature  I've managed to get has died because they have like 0 defense. :(
---
Is my hazmat suit still 1 dr?
---
Im down for 1000... :)
---
They want you to buy it, better start farming those atoms. Saw someone with the Deathclaw statue, rug and topiary and had several of each so I know and appreciate where you're going with it OP. Please don't be waiting on the other mount heads to drop like the other guy though
---
So what do you do if someone has an item you can't afford but you have an item they want how do you get it if you both have 0 caps
---
BETHESDA PLEASE FIX THIS.
---
I‚Äôve gone from keeping 300 of each scrap to 100 and it has changed my life. At the end of every play session I‚Äôm back up to 300 across the board. Bulk it. Sell it all tomorrow. Repeat.
---
Great payh but it feels like you reverted the camp building system back two patches. Can no longer clip through small world objects, constantly tells you objects are floating when they are not and all foundation pieces must be touching floor. Can we get a hot fix for this soon please? But awesome new event love it! Keep up the hard work!
---
No.
---
This studio is a fucking joke
---
Bring a spare nuclear keycard with you. You have to put it in BEFORE inputting the code, and it gets rejected if you input the wrong code. If you accidentally push the wrong button, you will lose your first keycard, so having spares is always a good idea
---
Punch bowl?  Crap, what did I miss here?  I‚Äôm so behind... haven‚Äôt even done the burrows yet.
---
Should have taken the right at Albuquerque
---
I never knew Super Mutants posted on here?
---
Ty have 3 now
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
People can have differing opinions. These posts are getting old, change my mind.
---
It only affects  the queen if it‚Äôs a gattling plasma/laser or a gattling gun
---
I have all the workbenches and a bear proof teashcan as the stash.
---
On my first visit I got aae combat shotty, aa less vats ultracite gattling laser, ve revolver, v minigun, bloodied gattling laser, on my alt I got vanguard sentinal scout and bolstering cavalier combat.
---
Ever since then tho I've had crap, luck had to run out sometime.
---
I had a great interaction with a kid a week or so ago. Passed by him in his camp right outside Alpha Silo on my way to launch a nuke and he was listening to music/breathing heavily. Even when I have a headset on I generally leave my mic muted unless I actually want to talk to someone, so I took my mic down and blew into it repeatedly, really just making fun of him, but when he ran up to me and said "what's up?" I realized he was just a kid so I muted myself again and used the "follow me" emote and ran into the silo.
---
He follows me through the silo talking a mile a minute (was pretty funny commentary actually), freaking out when assaultrons attacked him only to have me melt them with my .50 cal. When we got to the end he asked me if he could launch it, so I gave him a keycard and messaged him the code. Was his first nuke and he decided to nuke the queen.
---
We fast traveled to Watoga station and watched the nuke fall. He was ecstatic, put a huge smile on my face. Unfortunately I dc'ed halfway through the fight and the time lost loading back in was enough to have the queen fly off right with a tiny sliver of health left. Sucks we failed the event but overall great experience.
---
With all the changes to camp damage, what does a nuke do to a camp now?
---
One word *Cazador*
---
I have shadowed on every other piece of equipment. It is known. I know it's different for each piece. Only let's me craft 4 leather arm primary mods even though while scrapping leather arms I have had other mods learned popped up. The problem is exclusively leather arms primary mod slot
---
Straight
---
I mean it's what you get when you get protection on a budget!
---
I dont think so
---
#Straight damage the two shot, but the 3 star is better overall
---
That would be great, but, what happens then if you were to remove the perk card(s)? Do you automatically become over encumbered out in the wastes?
---
I edited my comment, hit enter too early
---
It's been a little while since I played and looking to get back into the wastes, but the topic of stash space will always come up unless they fix the underlying issues (and perhaps some of these have been addressed since I've been away).
---
At the time I was playing however, there was no real outlet for using all of the resources you collected along the way. Limited CAMP budget, Workshops that don't save your progress or resources, and limited vendor cap availability for selling off excess. 
---
Once these limits are reached, players tend to store the rest of their materials along with the gear they want to collect and eventually everything fills up with the need for more space. 
---
Again, I want to point out that I've been away for a while so hopefully some of these issues are getting addressed, but back during the first stash increases, the increase was a band-aid fix to a larger issue.
---
I‚Äôd also like a daily questions thread, so I can ask dumb shit and not post a thread on it.
---
What do you play on? I have 6 extra cameras in my Misc that i give to new players,
---
He edited his comment
---
Depends on the situation.  Vs a large boss enemy with high DPS the suppressor is arguably better so long as there's no one else using the effect (iirc it's unknown if multiple sources stack).  You get the DR plus the suppressor effect so you can potentially tank and/or help your teammates tank.  
---
In other situations vs standard enemies the 2 shot will be better as it will kill mooks faster.
---
Yeah the Wedding Ring and Old Ring have no DR now. Guessing Backpacks as well but havent checked.
---
If your on xbox, head to my camp. I have a good stock of bobbleheads and magazines.
---
GT: Flame Buhda
---
Its okey as a low level ghoul or scorched gun but its nit that useful for any enemy over lvl 20.
---
Im also curious
---
Queen is a server wide notification too. Top corner alerts the queen spawning and then says her reign of terror has ended when she's killed.
---
Grafton day? Noooooo!
---
I'm on PC, thanks tho! I will eventually find my energy weapons bobble head lol
---
It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, they butchered repair, and durability perks, and made weapons, and armor break like tissue paper right before they added repair kits, so I wouldn't put it past them.
---
Lmao I'm sure he will enjoy it.
---
I've been rolling around with one of those, too. I call it the Mutantfucker 3000. I break it out for special occasions.
---
Thanks for the warning homie.
---
Possibly because I abide by the ratings given to the videogame dictating what age group is appropriate to play it... Just ya know... It's written on the box is all.
---
What region, or does it not matter
---
Hopefully the enclave/Vault Tec is putting the tax money to good use.  Such as making plans for the scout armor mods!
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try this. But I still hope Bethesda will see this.
---
Green trees don't really bother me, it's only been 20 years since the bombs fell, and they didn't fall directly on the Forest Region. Go look at pictures of Pripyat, it's pretty lush. 
---
I think the only reason FO3 isn't greener is because it's 200 years later, and was more directly impacted by the bombs. 200 years of radiation that doesn't disperse is probably a lot worse on plant life than 20 years. 
---
NV not being very green is cause it's in a desert. It's already not that green, and if you go to the ...mountain area where the nightkin are that I can't remember the name of cause I'm senile I guess, there's trees there.
---
They seem to have changed the spoilage increments due to fast travel and potentially introduced offline spoilage, from what I've seen, but that's just speculation -- I haven't run any timed tests to be sure.
---
Correct, as long as you‚Äôre not in a team it is in effect
---
8 of my 3 star armor picks turned into 1 star wood pieces. Thats about 48 1 star weapons or 80 1 star armor pieces.
---
 Mothman are just super rare, I got it to the point where I just needed a torn wing from one, and of all places I found one right where it spawns you when you go to gather the toxic sludge for the new daily. I have been playing since BETA and have only ever seen a handful in the wastland aside from that one event that spawns the wise mothman.
---
It took me about 7 or 8 tries and I got a bloody explosive gatling gun with +1 Perception. I would have preferred reduced weight but perception is the dump stat on my character so it does help out.
---
Things would still be green. Chernobyl is an overgrown mess just a couple decades after spilling more than 400 times the amount of radiation of the bomb at Hiroshima into the air. Animals have even returned to the site and are living, albeit probably with terrible cancers. So I dont find the nature of the world in 76 to be all that disconcerting.
---
That's fine but not everybody that plays the game knows about that or even uses the forum would it not be a simpler and easier to implement the same type of system in the game
---
If caps kept changing hands and there was no tax to take caps out of the game, because of events and cap drops eventually there would more caps than players could even carry. Which would make them worthless.
---
This has duper sting written all over it
---
?
---
It's very far from dead.
---
Nice try, Todd.
---
I'd be happy even if they only made it effect players who are currently under the effect of a serum. Cause being mutated isn't really OP, but being mutated and being on the serum for it is.
---
Haha thats awesome
---
Yeah but I didn‚Äôt fast travel because I had too many rocket launchers 2*. I literally walked to Sutton and my stuff almost rotten. A few items spoiled.
---
Dead not is.
---
Hyper active community, trading forums are explosive, weekly updates and new content every 2 weeks now.
---
I did nobody wants to buy tho
---
I agree. We need more demons. I saw a guy selling ‚Äútop tier‚Äù BE weapons, mind you they were only 2 star. No third effect at like 5-6k. And the pinhead got mad and followed me to my camp because I was selling the same stuff for 500 a piece.
---
Whitesprings, just server hop. It's the best place to level
---
Ill will check wen I get off work thanks for the update!
---
Yeah i ve made the first pic to show to players how to look for the rad storm when you re far away from it.
---
I see what you‚Äôre going for here, but we already the assassins prefix for other players.
---
BE Pipe Rifle is Wesley Pipes
---
Don't even bother. Compared to it's fallout 4 version it's useless. You just get more steel and wood and sometimes some plastic and glass but that's it.
---
Hell is other people.
---
The idea behind it is to remove caps from the economy, not to just move them around. Winning, for me anyway, would just mean most of those caps disappear since I am normally close to the cap limit.
---
Ratings are suggestions, not law. Parents can allow their kids to play any game. And any game worth its salt is going to attract kids, no matter how mature the content might be.
---
I'm lv 9
---
You can play solo for majority of the game yes and be fine dont sweat it, its a good game
---
Metatron(Explosive Ranged), Rodney Sting(Electric Baton), Xlll(Machete) to name a few.
---
ü§∑ set em all at 1 Cap and wait. Gotta just hope the right person comes along who actually used that ammo. Pretty much everything but .38 will sell eventually
---
&gt;Ok detective, 
---
Uh why ridicule me on fairly obvious thing?
---
The people who complain, cried the loudest but this game is far from dead
---
I was on a team last night helping a friend complete the kill 10 scorchbeasts for the one of us quest.
---
Then we where near the glassed cavern and someone launched a nuke on glassed cavern.
---
We and like 25 other people are just blowing the queen away. The 10th scorchbest he had to kill was the queen!
---
Btw someone used the cryolator on her while she was on the ground. That was a really good idea.
---
You might get 1k for the long coat and 750 for the jacket. The marine wetsuit is worthless now unless its shielded.
---
for sure. like, I know i‚Äôll find friends along the way n all that, I just didn‚Äôt wanna get the game only to not be able to progress.
---
Gotta fever
---
why are you carrying around bulked scrap? put it back into your stash
---
Deathclaws may have to rely upon a random encounter, if not near Welch there maybe one. Behemoth I don't think have a spawn location in the Ash heap, Mutant hound at Garraham HQ if the place is infested with super mutants, if not server hop. Radstag may also have to rely on just a random encounter with it out there, bloatfly and maybe stingwing could spawn around the train yard or around Mount blair, or the Rusty Pick, wolf perhaps down towards the bottom near Beckley, a bit out near a corpse (one of the locations for the Sheepsquatch questline)(or around the rusty pick), and a bloodtick I have no idea if they can be found around there, maybe the farm between Camden and Beckley, along the main road.
---
You lost, bud? Sure you aren't looking for [r/AnthemTheGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/)?
---
I watch a lot of AVE and Bolt Thrower videos, so of course I‚Äôll really enjoy Billie Eilish videos.
---
Also, a smart thing to do (for anyone who doesn‚Äôt have 76 but wants it), rent it for a day from a Red Box, download the game, return it, and bam! When u buy the game for real, you‚Äôll be set!
---
I brought a friend to flatwoods near the agriculture center, removed all armor, and aggro'd two mr handy's and let them kill me and had him revive me and it worked.
---
Trade with people you trust/know
---
If you tag some of the gohls in whitesprings you can then run to the robots that are everywhere. And they can kill them, giving you xp for the ones you hit
---
Yeah
---
I take advantage of the Unix-style alpha listing (lowercase "a" follows uppercase "Z") to force sorting so that stuff I want to turn in to the Legendary machines gets forced to the top, stuff I don't want to accidentally sell gets forced to the bottom.  
---
Legendary lever action: don sell dis kapow
---
Legendary fire axe: don sell dis choppy
---
Legendary handmade: don sell dis pop pop pop
---
Most other things: SELL DIS SHIT \*armor, SELL DIS SHIT \*\*weapon, etc.
---
Ah good to know, I'm using a full set of assassin/sentinel marine. :)
---
Strange that you're talking about economics, but using religous terms...
---
I'm unaware there is "an understanding" of what prices should be. Why don't you charge whatever you want and let other charge the highest price the market is willing to pay? Like an actual market?
---
Few Ammos get more than 0.5 caps each on the market subs so it works out alright
---
Miners hat?
---
Just got finished bulking what I wanted to sell to a vendor. My CAMP got attacked and looted the bodies. After that I made a bunch of vegetable starch and went to scrap it.
---
Big thx for your help, will look upon it - need just 4 of them.
---
Yes please
---
Just watch Waterworld and see how Todd would screw up a game
---
Yeah the Cryo works on her and Sheepsquash.  That's awesome!
---
you wouldn't be used
---
Hey mate, you're not responding to comments, you're responding to your own post
---
No and yes, in that order.
---
By and large, you can run solo. Teaming up with other players is not mandatory.
---
There are a few side events/missions/quests that are designed to need more than one person to complete.  You can participate in those events solo and still share event rewards.
---
There are other things that can be done solo, but are made easier if there's other players around.
---
Huh? Is this a joke or legit?
---
Ah ok thanks very much
---
It made me respawn outside even before the event was over. All three times
---
People are always looking for the Hunter's Long Coat and I've seen it sell easily anywhere from 1.5-3k - the Bomber Jacket is a little more common and can go from 500-1k - Marine wetsuits are pretty easy to come by. I sell more Brotherhood Officer suits.
---
ah so youre just an idiot who has ADHD and forgets about bulking stuff 5 minutes after you do it
---
The gatling with : suppressors , 10% while aiming, and damage resistance is a great tanking weapon for Encryptid event. 
---
With Power Armor and some perking into first aid, you can take 2 or 3 of conduits and also facetank the Sheepsquatch.  Makes the event go extremely easy when people can go ham.
---
Don't scrip it, imo.
---
You trying to scam a guy? Hunters Longcoat is 2.5-3k easily.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be included with the scrap all feature to begin with ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You‚Äôre just a dick, go away.
---
Except for the over caffeinated, ADHD numbskulls that go off the rails and start yelling at you (profanity) or worse (gay bashing).  Or both.  I jacked up some guy recently in survival and he lost it.  I wasn‚Äôt micd up but he was.  In retrospect I should have reported him but I didn‚Äôt.  In any event, after he described my sexual orientation and things I might do for fun some other player came by and lit him up.  The convo went from me to the other guy.  Not sure I‚Äôd want my 14 or 12 year old daughters subject to that abuse but I probably wouldn‚Äôt let them play anyway.
---
They'll increase in value when the display items come out. I'm sure itll include bobbleheads and magazine racks. 
---
Prices will go up, but I can't imagine by much.
---
lol BE weapons are worth 6k at least. I'd charge more. Not even 5 days of caps for BE? I don't know why he got made, but I would have bought your inventory. I'd probably buy his too and immediately re-list in the 10k range.
---
I literally still have stacks of gum drops and bubble gums in my stash in case those come back :-\\
---
Np mate! I'd also suggest Uncanny caverns, as they can spawn stingwings that I know of, but I don't know if that's just on the edge of the forest or Ash heap :/ But good luck hunting them! Some server hops may be needed, as always with this game XD
---
When you talked about the chat room I remember I got invited to a team and into a group room and right when i joined like 5 people were screaming and yelling get out to a bunch of people and i panicked and couldn't figure out how to leave and then a dude finally kicked me.
---
Feel free to think that, and be wrong. :)
---
Lol nice system
---
Hold up who can disable those how do you do that

You will need help with maybe 2 or 3 quests if I remember correctly other than that its straight solo make sure you have lone wanderer perk
---
MY bad mate it's the first time I've used this Reddit, Cheers
---
Do you actually believe your own bullshit? ISP conflict with the game? Sure, if they're down completely. 
---
Jesus, this sort of white knighting is pathetic.
---
Irdk if the masks anyone has are duped, I just want to find somebody willing to take a photo with me so I can add it to my gallery, and put some life into those loading screens
---
Sorry, wont be on again until Thursday night....
---
Currently adulting.
---
The durability was pitifully low. Like per use low not the damaged from use.  80% of them didn‚Äôt even go past the first star on the stat card.
---
I guess maybe there could be a pop up warning that prevents you from swapping the card out if it‚Äôll overencumber the stash?
---
Noice
---
Sounds to me not worth the risk unless there's something substantial about the reward if that's done.
---
I have had someone like that show up at my camp. Demanded to see my permit for operating a store, to see how i'm storing all my wares, etc. I slammed the door in their face, locked the door, and sat down for dinner, all the while they were going "S-Sir, Sir! I can see you through the window. Sir, open this door. Sir!"....It got annoying...
---
Don‚Äôt you mean answer ‚Äúno‚Äù to all of them?
---
Follow the overseers quest line.  It will keep you in level appropriate areas (most of the time)
---
Stay in the forest/green area on the left of the map until between L15 and 20.  
---
Then go to the Toxic Valley (north and west on the map - where the alligator is)
---
At 25-30, start working your way down the western side of the center (savage divide)
---
End up at the lower left corner of the ash heap (south part of the map)
---
At 40+ eastern side of the divide - Bog and Mire.
---
My play group  when all online has to form 2-3 groups (Rare Occurrence but does happen). Just makes it hard to coordinate between everyone since PlayStation Party is limited to 8 players and In Game party is 4.  Heck the Launch Nuke Quest is recommended a party of 8 but the game party system doesn't go that high.
---
My TS Gauss is called Flappy Flopper.
---
Haha missed out on that one! I appreciate the offer being made, though!
---
Happened also to me today. No idea what triggered that.
---
Im on xbox...have a good one!
---
After initializing the event at the red terminal. Go around the corner to the keypad door "970930" go down and find the engineering terminal and get the shut down code.. Then return to the red terminal and issue the shut down.

Haha yea I get cha, just the format of your post reminded of poorly planned out drug stings. Like"hey just looking if I could get some marijuanas off anyone. Will pay alot!!"

Sorry my mom says I have to be vegetarian so B can be for beets/s (but can we talk about how someone could actually go on a vegetarian diet in fallout 76 like there are so many options it‚Äôs really cool)

Here's a tip I don't see a lot: **Do not buy three star legendary weapons.**
---
Follow me on this one. Legendary stars come in tiers: tier 1, tier 2, tier 3. A 1* legendary will have one tier 1 effect, 2* legendaries have a tier 1 and a tier 2, and 3* legendaries have one tier 1, one tier 2, and one tier 3 effect. 
---
So far, so good. 1* legendaries cost 25 scrip, 2* legendaries cost 50, and 3* legendaries cost 100. In other words, you're paying an extra 50 scrip to get that last star, but **is that last star worth it?** Let's look at the tier 3 weapon effects:
---
Effect | Description
---
-------|------------
---
Durability | 50% more durability than normal
---
Lucky | Your V.A.T.S. critical meter fills 15% faster
---
Nimble | Faster movement speed while aiming.
---
Rapid | 15% faster reload
---
Resilient | +250 Damage Resistance while reloading
---
Steadfast | +50 Damage Resistance while aiming.
---
Perception | +1 Perception
---
VATS Enhanced | 25% less V.A.T.S. Action Point cost
---
Cavalier's | Take 15% less damage while blocking
---
Cavalier's | Take 40% less damage while power attacking
---
Endurance | +1 Endurance
---
Strength | +1 Strength
---
Agility | +1 Agility
---
Lightweight | 90% reduced weight
---
Out of all of those, I'd say *maybe* two are good, but none of these are worth 50 scrip.
---
Bottom line: Do not waste your scrip on 3* legendaries, buy 2* instead.
---
Asset flipping from one game to the next is all Bethesda have done since 2003. This engine is ancient. Their code is a spaghetti mess, decade old house of cards.
---
They're lazy and players keep rewarding it.
---
I posted about this a couple of months ago, was downvoted to 0, and informed that it was reported as "working as intended".  And at the time, I confirmed Beth did say it was proper behavior. I'm too lazy to go search it out again. 
---
But I'd love to read that use case....
---
"As a Vault dweller, I'd like to spend 20 minutes on a plastic run thru MGN, Defiance, and Watoga, 10 minutes bulking all my scrap to sell, and then as I stop at the tinkers bench in Whitespring train stn, undo all that by forgetting to stash my bulk before scrapping that pack of cigarettes I found on the mattress outside."

---
Screams across Reddit on a regular basis exceed 300 upvotes.
---
Maxed Class Freak is great with Healing Factor. The decrease for stimpacks becomes negligible in heavy combat, and you don't have to waste healing items when clearing out smaller locations like Camp Venture
---
Yeah. Also there doesn't need to be a limit engine-wise for materials, it's just an id of the material and a number. Doesn't matter if this numer is 50 or 50000. 
---
If anything, they maybe have to impose a limit on how many different things you can store, with their shitty engine. It could be that the stash space is used to camouflage this limitation without making it too obvious.
---
Hahaha Yeah I can see what you mean actually
---
I don't get the message, but I am unable to select the destination to fast travel to until the world is fully loaded (and if I'm not mistaken, I have to open the map *after* the world is loaded to get it to work).  I'd need to test it further to see if it's an initial login problem, or if it still exists after I've fast traveled somewhere that needs loading.
---
Assuming this is the same issue, it's a patience problem.  But I'm also on PC, so it may not be the same thing.
---
Oooo that‚Äôs what that room was for (besides the red chest) I found the the papers of the code hoping for something really cool to be behind the door but just dead body‚Äôs
---
I guess there is life after death...  because, buddy, this ain‚Äôt what death looks like....
---
I still do not understand why its not unlimited
---
its probably a lot easier now since there will be vendors when you emerge from the vault
---
most content can be done solo.. bigger stuff like events will draw a crowd most of the time weather you want it or not...
---
Id just like to say I get bad lag in the center of the place, going from 60fps to 30fps. I was downvoted for saying this so I don't know. My set up is fine I literally can't do much on my end. My specs are above recommended.
---
As a rookie player, should I be holding onto my cooking oil? What for exactly?
---
Just play the game and enjoy it you‚Äôll find half decent levelled equipment as you explore and complete missions and events. 
---
You can‚Äôt have god tier weapons and armour until you reach an appropriate level later in the game, so just have fun, you‚Äôll get there quickly enough.
---
Rabbits spawn on the hill behind the Whitespring service entrance. Server hopping should get you the 10.
---
Yeah no clue. Not fun to have to restock and reprice everything
---
Oh, I just thought the servers were separate. That's cool!
---
David.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I sell hu ters long coats all the time and the highest bid is almost always around 1k. Where are you trading?
---
How about Stab time
---
No offence, but you cant know for sure, until you find another one and check. I think this plan is relatively rare drop from forest events. I made 15-20 fertile soil to get my shadowed legs plan, that share same drop sources with arms plan, as I know.
---
I like killing beavers, not in game of course
---
Diffusers drop from the new event. Musician is still bugged though.
---
My AA combat knife: The pokening. AA vats crit DB shotty: Boomstick. And for nostalgia sake, my favorite gun to date, that I still use in FO4, an Irradiated Laser Rifle named: The Duke, because The Duke nukes em. I would love to have something similar to it in 76 lol.
---
Np!
---
So you dont have to find the tourist for it?
---
To that I‚Äôd make a reference to the elder Scrolls and add it the options to purchase homes,  but modes of transportation etc.  since they aspire to make the game feel like a player run world, they have plenary of things They could add in to keep caps as a valuable form of currency
---
Companies like Capcom? You bet they are. The hell even is this comment, of course there‚Äôs other companies putting out better games and better patches that have more grueling work ethic. 
---
Wtf ‚Äúforce the fun out of work‚Äù üòÇ
---
Is this Iowa?
---
I will agree with what you are talking about- it is very immersion breaking to have "Feed the People" pop up dated center everytime passing through Morgantown  
---
but i will also agree on a small notification like Encrypted has for these tougher ones-   
---
did this twice last night with 3 people, we were not even close
---
Yeah, I've experienced this, jank and fps slowdown and speed up depending on direction in Arktos Pharma especially. Turned down my shadow quality to medium and it helped.
---
You just keep grinding for that 3* bloodied explosive reload speed handmade (or whatever is the penultimate weapon for your build). I am sure you will get it before the universe goes dark.
---
The better question would be why do you think it's dead? It has gone through a great deal of rough patches, but it is far from a dead game.
---
Good story, for sure. Did you ever get your green hood? If you're on PC I believe I still have a spare I'd be willing to trade.
---
I put a desk in my camp to act as a counter for me to stand behind, I wrote "will buy all stable cobalt 25c ea" on it and I've gotten like 3 people to message me about it. Just find a way to write where people will see it often
---
The 10% sink only matters to lower level/ lower geared players. 
---
Unless you're only selling low value things, the vending machine can make you more caps per hours than randomly trading with someone. You don't have to stop what you're doing and still be able to offer up to 120 items for sale. That is huge for those of us grinding towards godly end game items. We don't have to stop grinding and still profit from trading at the same time. 10% isn't much imo
---
On Xbox - I normally sell mine for 1-1.5k because I don't want to sell too high but I've had friends sell them for 3k easily. Just depends on how desperate the person is for them you know?
---
I also only sell serums for like 200-250 but my friend sells for 500 and people buy his all day long??
---
Don't know if platform makes a difference, but I've played for 80+ hours on PC and haven't run into anyone being a dick ever. Everyone either leaves me alone, or when I was sub level 20, high level players often gave me stuff if they ran into me.  
---
I play on adventure mode though, assuming survival is a lot more fierce.
---
Yep. I am not going to sell an item that took months to grind for what is only a few days worth of caps.
---
Sacrifice him to the blood God so al our loot might be better
---
You win the Internet.
---
I'm a simple man. Up with you.
---
At another suggestion I have decided on David lol
---
Ok let's run this down. This is a flat out exploit, something which shouldn't happen.   
---
I PvP all the time, the reason I don't complain about all of that is because I don't need to, I can kick Bloodied builds for days, Inf. Invis. isn't something I've ever run into and I think it's personally a myth (considering I've fought loads of exploiters and stealth users, I just imagine it's people over-hyping Secret Agent/stealth boys being used in chain succession) , VATs immunity is due to crouch jumping (since when you're crouched you can't be hit in VATs) which is annoying but you counter it by just doing the same thing back essentially and the VATs bug is a pain I grant you as I've seen it a lot to, but also it should be noted Two-shot weapons have always had fucked up VATs things.
---
I'll answer your question with a question when ever has the statement starting with "I wish something would change" not a form of complaining lol.
---
What this whole thread was about is making you realize your asking for something that already exist your just wanting to be able to craft them so it's easier to obtain.
---
Ex comparison: should we be able to craft legendary weapons?
---
How quickly do you think the appeal would dwindle to grind for better weapons?
---
Critical thinking +1
---
well you know, I'd probably have to be there lol
---
I hit the rename limit with power armor so I can't name weapons..
---
An intrusive announcement won't fix that. I have launched nukes only to be the only one to show up to fight the queen before.
---
None of those are pvp advantages if they're available to everyone (not condoning exploits if any of those fall into that category, but none I recognize do).
---
In OP's case, one person gains a tactical advantage that other people can't have (as only 1 person can claim that base location), on top of the fact that they're exploiting a bug in the game code or design.
---
This is absolutely a good situation to report the user for exploiting, and for reporting the whole situation as a bug/exploit.
---
That is still limited by the 1400 cap ceiling. I can make my 1400 caps in 30 minutes without having to have serums.
---
I was at one C.A.M.P. today it said with small letters donation centre and what they were looking for with an arrow. never saw that before and left something as it made me laugh.
---
Much easier to kill her on the ground then trying to shoot her out of the sky.
---
What is a goddamn BE weapon?
---
No temper son isn‚Äôt much I don‚Äôt think they over text whatsoever how to ever I do think that they could use the caps for something instead of them just disappearing
---
Anyone still doing this? My GT:Drkbladez22
---
Baseball bat is call 'HERE SWATTA SWATTA SWATTA RIGHT HERE BOOM'
---
I thought you meant as in Wanted players lol
---
Destroys it. I made a post about this weeks ago.
---
What camp plan are you using to write that out? Seems like the neon lights would be a bit much storage space there. 
---
Also I just like the idea of standardizing so ever person knows you are looking for something if you have the poster next to the vendor machine
---
I have like 900 .308 bullets, come by when I‚Äôm online, but I won‚Äôt be tonight. Add me: Drankster033
---
You are drastically underestimating the number of dupes.
---
Thank you, was one of the best survival mode moments I've had so far  I did not, and would love to trade you for your spare!!
---
Anything you want ;)
---
YES YES  also some of the events will turn of as a notification
---
Yeah, and it's not like you can get a gun without mods. Even the basic mods still have weight that makes the 90% reduced weight a joke.
---
We do have an automod script in place to try and remove these type posts and remove any that get through. If you see one, report it!
---
I am, is your name your GT? I'll be on in a few hours.What recipes do you have?
---
I've only ever seen this happen on Vendor Bots for rotten food (they can't sell things that cost 0).
---
I don't know what could cause this on Player Vendors though sorry.
---
I'm online right now if you are.
---
IGN: jtm1994
---
Absolutely.
---
Ah, your caption of "Don't Work" made it seem like you had tried taking the picture from outside a storm.
---
Here's how I think it should work. When you hover over an event, it should say "Press E to Join Event | Press C to Track Event"
---
Then once an event is tracked, hovering over it and pressing C would remove it from favorites.
---
C was chosen for this example because that's the default favorite key in the Pip-Boy, but maybe it should be something else.
---
Maybe you could manage your tracked events with the personal terminal, but it'd be great to be able track events on the fly.
---
I've sadly made this mistake, and it likely won't be my last.
---
I bulked a bunch of surplus scrap to sell. Traveled to the train station, and picked up a bunch of plastic cutlery on the way. Hit the workbench and 'scrapped all'. Fuck.
---
I think the plan is for small letters or something like that. It's the pretty small letters in the build menu, the ones that a lot of people use to label their vendors
---
They won't fix this because doing so would destroy existing knives üëê
---
i couldn't find it, maybe it was once in the atom shop prior to the glitch? but i had never seen it before
---
Legendary Vendor is a gamble. You take a chance and sometimes you lose. Stop asking for all the aspects of this game that YOU don‚Äôt like to be removed, you spoiled entitled brat.
---
Bloodied explosive
---
Played for about 4-5 hours last night, still eating food at the end of the session I made at the start, although it was getting close to spoiling. Been on that time frame a long time.
---
Well uh, know what I‚Äôm gonna be doing
---
Wtf I never knew this.
---
Have you considered not dying?
---
Since Fallout 76 i can relate to elder folks which enjoy playing Golf. It's just fun running around with a three iron smashing ghouls
---
http://www.27bslash6.com/missy.html
---
Thank you.
---
NGL this is what happened in the last post, people misread and thought I was referring to something ON TOP of the building, rather than being glitched into it. So I got tons of trolls and people posting erroneously.
---
Yeah I looked for it the first day I saw them in people's camps and it was never there and I looked last night and couldn't find it either :/ i think it will be pretty lame if they want us to pay atoms for it after everyone's gotten it for free at this point
---
Because your parents didn't love you enough as a child?
---
Oh, no... That's the answer to why are you an asshole troll.
---
The assassin's prefix doesn't make a distinction between mutants and other players. It also does less bonus damage than mutant slayers, which is more specialized. It would absolutely still have a place and help put an additional disadvantage on mutations.
---
Lol hes downvoting everyone that's commenting.  I'll take the bullet for the crew.  Everyone gets an upvote.
---
I dunno why the hate on Tea Time. It gives a great consumable if you are a drunk. Sweetwater special blend has bourbon in it. Very handy if you're trying to be drunk all the time.
---
Holy diver lever action (exterm/explo/fast reload) to go along with sole survivor.
---
Also have been naming my heavy weapons after Schwarzenegger movies.  Minigun is Predator.  (Last) action hero.  Commando for a nice LMG.
---
Hell ye sign me up
---
Yeah. It was late night like 2-3a.m. I meant no bm to them and explained that the durability was far to low to make proper use of.
---
They were in the shop a long time ago. Never made attention to them but now I kind of like them.
---
The two shot makes your hunt easier, but the three star can make you better caps when you sell it to new players.
---
No don't go to Whitesprings if you are level 9! It's a very silly place full of high level maniacal players and ghouls. Stick to the left,/west half of the map for the next 25 levels. Trust me - I'm level 145 and still find Whitesprings challenging solo at times 
---
There are areas on the middle/east side that are ok but not whitesprings. That place be crazy for a newbie.
---
GT TeamRagnar48, almost all
---
Ya, use the miners helmet
---
Its a never ending battle.  In the beginning we had 400, the plebs demanded more so it went up.  Then that wasnt enough and the plebs said "We need more!".  So we got 800.  Now the plebs say "More! More! More!"
---
So trade with 2 people only. It would take so long to get anything if you have to get to know someone before trading. It's not that hard to put some kind of system in the game for trading it would help so many people that I see getting ripped off and cheated wouldn't save even Bethesda the hassle of all kinds of complaints
---
I prefer 80085 personally.

You get rich in this game by first grinding crap to sell to vendors and grinding 3\*s until you get some awesome gear to trade. Then you buy serum recipes so you don't have to do the collect the caps grind anymore and can spend more time grinding 3\*s. You too will one day become a serum millionaire. Ever upwards.
---
Yes, they appeal to the same online crowd. You'll have fun, give it a shot!
---
Unrelated question that‚Äôs a suggestion, Can we maybe have a trading system where we‚Äôre able to trade a item for a item?
---
Yup, this has been going on with all creatures for a while now.
---
So I love survival. But before I go into a server I out any important aid or junk away, problem one solved. After the last patch nobody can destroy your camp unless your in pvp with them. So if you don't shoot them they can't destroy your camp. And lastly you have to expect pvp in survival that's what it's all about, so be ready!
---
Oh for sure!
---
You on PC I can sell you some screws ptp
---
To each their own...
---
Hmm ... do not see any ideological in it, I'm atheist it's just a coincidence üòÑ
---
Maybe your right, maybe not, idk, it remain a game, if a free market involves the same problems of real life then, we could talk about ideology üòú
---
I'm not sure why either.....
---
I understand it's frustrating but if you are in a survival server why would you even try to rebuild your camp x.x they're only going to destroy it again??
---
Wondering if you have the butchers bounty perl equipt if you could possibly get more off the bodies for the troughs
---
You'll be fine.  The game guides you pretty well through the early levels, and once you've run through the storyline it opens up into whatever you want it to be.  
---
As far as solo play goes, the only thing directly gated by having to work with other people has been one minor piece of the recent Scouts update.  I play solo pretty much exclusively, and the only times I really need help from other people are at the big server-wide events that everyone just jumps into anyway.
---
No, xb1. But thanks.
---
I've also had this exact issue. Incredibly frustrating, especially since I found some at a good price
---
lol he thinks F76 died but still plays ARK
---
It's some here around the 'throne' area... It's like a Cage and you can see two weapons hanging on the Wall, one of them is Always a handmade
---
This is just incorrect.  Check out my other reply in this thread for a link to what prefixes work with what creatures.
---
Another 8 ish hours to go!
---
Nah, you don't need it for the Shadowed mod.
---
Pretty sure it's the same time as caps in the vendors
---
How's **glitching into a wall so you cannot be hit, seen or damaged, whilst being able to see and damage other players** not cheating? I'd love you to explain that for me since last I checked that's cheating.
---
My two main wants from Nuclear Winter are some sort of map-wide story related to the ATLAS facility in the Savage Divide, and more missions for Rose the robot raider.
---
What do you normally sell the green hoods for?
---
Are you stupid? This shows what he had to do because he was solo
---
Honestly, I'd put a report in about it.
---
I believe that you know what you're doing, so I don't know why it hasn't worked, sorry.
---
Just like every BGS game, many of the perks either don't work properly, or are unclear in what they do.
---
Go to r/martket76. They have middlemen to make trades.
---
It may be easier to implement in game but you could also wait forever to get whatever Bethesda thinks is right.
---
If it's an object in the game then it can be added to the "list" of camp objects.
---
Some will look weird because the models won't have a bottom or some wont have snapping points, somethings will need to get updated because some objects might not have collisions when they are used in the camp system.
---
In short, yes. But it would take some time to do that.
---
Um, what do you think a sin is if you are an atheist? Never mind, let's just stick to FO76
---
Yup. That's why majority of players suggested fresh characters only in survival. Lol. But as we all know you can just take your end game toons over there.
---
I wanted access to the crafting stations mostly
---
In the words of Blind Willie Johnson: It's nobody's fault but mine! :)
---
I've never had one. It's one of the few appeal items I don't have, so I was just trying to find one.
---
No clue what people are valuing them at.
---
Just using an ingame location. Not cheating.

Awesome - thanks for the update. That explains why I see them on one system and not the other. I'm still using a 16:10 res monitor for my gaming rig and a 16:9 for my gaming laptop.

The other player didn't have to do it he just found a way around it rather than having to rely on friends in game or strangers on reddit, which he should be applauded for its alot more original than H:Caps W:to revive you.... and your insults wated on me I'm too stupid to care ;)
---
Contact Bethesda directly regarding this, either report the player for exploiting, or...somewhere there...for the exploit itself (I didn't see an obvious place to do that).

I guess shooting back counts as PvP. I understand that PvP is the appeal, and I expected to be able to actually fight back for more than a fraction of a second before being shredded by someone three times my level.

That's why it was a "SUGGESTION" lmao

a small box in the corner isn't any more intrusive than the active queues text which is constantly on

Is it the shadows? I had a flickering problem using shadows on low so I bumped it upto medium. I'll try going high and see if that fixes my problem.
---
The flickering was with trees, it looked like the void and how it distorted the surroundings in every bethesda game.
---
Yeah it's not easy, some people really know what they're doing with their builds. I've gotten my butt kicked but slowly have gotten a lot better. I just try and stay real stealthy while im in a survival server
---
For the quest yes, but if you just want the camera to do the challenges, you just need the camera
---
It'd be nice if they consistently worked, such as yesterday's "take a camera picture of a masked played at the official Mothman statue." It didn't work.

And no, it doesn't already exist. The only cosmetic pet is the frog. I said I wish there was more. Complaint? Nope. There's other cosmetic pets(not counting the ones you can tame)? Please point them out.

He has a point though. You only see these posts if you sort by new. Do that on any subreddit and you'll find yourself wading through repetetive posts. No one upvotes those posts so they dont make it to any of the other filter types.
---
In this case the frequency of these posts show interest from potential new players. Given that the 'health' of an online/gaas game needs new players, trying to suppress the posts doesn't seem to be forward looking.
---
Practically, these are simply frequently asked questions, so the usual appoach is to have a static answer post in a visible location and to direct the repeated questions to that.
---
That's possibly where an automod can help.
---
Probably best to find one in the wild. Or have a minimal camp blueprint for when you go into survival :(
---
Ah gotcha, thank you
---
AH,  
---
Okay you're just trolling, poorly. Gotcha.
---
Hell, I'd even pay for a stash doubler purchase from teh atom shop.
---
Please don't hurt me!
---
I named my Bear Arms THE RIGHT
---
No BS.  My totals for three days as a vendor were 23k, 18k, 32k. I had four characters loaded up with gear since day one.  Had to move funds around to stay under 25k.
---
Bloodied effects don‚Äôt work for gamma gun???
---
I have a TSE laser rifle named AER 7 so I get that
---
Most things are 20 hour resets.
---
Yes you are a bad person. 
---
Peoples can sell things for the price they like. If you don't like it DO NOT BUY it. 
---
I think you are angry because they can get more caps then you. You are just another confused teenager. Don't worry , we all going to die one day .
---
have fun and bring a friend to help
---
Don't buy the whole amount, about 90% of them. Most likely they repaired, dipped into their sell supply and the UI didn't refresh.
---
I've got the same problem and my rig is above the recommended specs. I'll try to raise the settings maybe that's it since I've lowered everything thinking it would help.
---
Theres a limit?
---
Thx mate!
---
per character though. if you log in with 5+ characters that your mc gives serums to you can get a lot of freakin caps
---
Its 50
---
I tried to move my camp to the billboard near Whitesprings so I can have the cats spawn in my camp and it wouldn't let me lay my camp there.  I've seen other camps there, so I'm guessing they made it a no build zone now?!  I wants CATS!!!!
---
You want the small letters plan! It's around 1k from normal vendor bots and you could find it cheaper from players. My friend made a menu this way and put up what he was looking for - he used the neon lights to make a sign to like draw their attention to the menu wall - worked pretty well!
---
Yeah but I already know Bethesda is slow as fuck to deal with reports. I reported pvtpelnar89 and many other actual IG hackers, whilst having groups of us posting videos (etc) and the guy is still running around months later on the same account (He was hacking into walls, aimbotting and loads of other shit)  
---
I've come to the realisation they don't respond to anything unless it kicks enough fuss on Reddit lmao
---
As well as all those unique weapons from Survival mode and the vanilla game on top of the legendary weapons we keep for actual use and armor sets for different play styles.
---
I wouldn't call that very high level
---
Same for me, I'm using a 16:10 monitor with my desktop.
---
only 2 to go - during Encryptid I made one photo of legendary enemy (imposter sheepsquatch) and later realized there is always deathclaw body near fissure sites :)
---
I use adrenal reaction and I had a bloodied and an intstagating gamma gun. When my health was low they still had the same damage output. I've heard other people complaining about it too. Unless i was confused I'm pretty sure it doesn't stack
---
Lol
---
Good point.
---
Guess I should of said don't stack with adrenal
---
I've never seen a more passionate community for a game than this. It's great
---
Not really, it's an extremely reasonable assumption.
---
Great, now I want chicken tendies
---
you are the person that pvp players dream about by carrying lots of aid and junk on you and thinking that everything is going to be ok. 
---
Everything that you mentioned is the exact opposite of what you should do in survival.
---
What happens if you report people for "inexperience" it makes them play the tutorial again but does it in a slow and loud voice?
---
Puts on the "slow timmy" helpful hints?
---
I've got a junkies shotgun but I can't get any addictions.  My character is too good at drugs.
---
Yeah. I still heavily use an old one star auto handmade with vampire on it but haven't gotten anything with enough of a useful boost from the purveyor.  I kept a 10mm machine gun but just so I didn't have to keep carrying a 10mm pistol as a side arm
---
They're pretty decent now. The dmg is a lot higher than Two shot and has more accuracy but they're not as strong as bloodied though you can get full dmg at full health. You need 5 addictions to get the full 50% bonus and you'll take a few hits in special stats but that's it.
---
Why make a build which requires equipment your not likely to get
---
Interestingly, maybe unluckily, I have yet to get a drill as a reward for anything. I‚Äôve literally never seen a drill and I‚Äôm level 68.
---
My camp always shows yellow when vendors are active.
---
It stays yellow but adds a cap design around your base tent icon.
---
Look at the icon before and after the vendor is turned in. Same color but SLIGHTLY different design icon.
---
NGL this would be the best.
---
My TSE is named The Twat. My TSE Lever action is named The Cunt. My TSE sub machine gun is named Lady Beast.
---
It‚Äôs a very small pool per server, if you see something you don‚Äôt like any of it, say a nocturnal fatman, stop right there and hop server. There‚Äôs very high chance that you either get more fatmen or more nocturnal.
---
Is this game as bad as they make it seem?
---
I called my minigun "Brzeczyszczykiewicz". Just because he brzƒôczy and szczyka all the time.
---
Cool I'll look again. If you can remember let me know which sewer to enter through and I know some of the areas have names like central the pier and mess hall
---
FYI I had to explode a hound corpse north a little bit from Garrahan to get the picture to count, if you run into that as well.
---
I know all serum recipes, thanks. Post is not about that. Its about caps inflation problem
---

That's a good idea. Gonna try it next time!

None of that is that rare. Hunter long coat eeeh...maybe you could save someone 1 hour of server hopping, but it's not rare.
---
I don't have trouble finding enough legendaries to scrip each day - I was able to max out 150scrip on my level 25 without much difficulty and I definitely do not go out of my way to "farm" legendary items.
---
You might try just always doing events - especially the Arktos Pharma event - on top of the lvl 100 3 star alpha - last night in one event I also ran  into at least 3 legendary bots and 2 legendary stags. 
---
I would like to see some new ways to get scrip - like from the Daily/Weekly challenges like you suggested but I don't think it's a necessary change.
---
Reduce the amount you're trying to buy 
---
I usually can buy them by reducing by 1.... Sometimes gotta reduce more though.
---
As a previous comment stated, most likely they used some and didn't refresh the vendors.
---
When you take the drug to which you are addicted does damage drop?
---
Fuck tell me about it , I made the mistake of adding a boyo and the little shit it‚Äôs always sending party invites and harassing the shit out me
---
Or make a bank of sorts in Whitespring. They could even ‚Äútax‚Äù it like they do trades. Pay the bank to hold the item for you to grab it on another character
---
Being inside of the walls, yes I agree. Fox that. Putting a camp up there though is fine.
---
Here here. Anytime we get a new in game feature that requires stash space to use (Vending Machines) we should get a mandatory 200 pound stash increase. 
---
At least the least ammo, junk, and no spoiling aid items should be Weightless in stash. Until at least junk and ammo are weightless in the stash Bethesda is going to have a hard time satisfying our storage needs.
---
Good question i don't know
---
The weight of the syringer is simply too high for such a niche weapon. Even though there's a lot of potential fun to be had with it, I can't justify carrying it due to that.
---
Scaly Skin FTW.
---
Bring snacks and juice.
---
I just want a beaver tail weapon to slap people with.
---
I saw a camp where someone maxed out their build limit with sirens. All of them were powered on. It was wild.
---
Yeah, we got a free punch bowl! And there's a keg version. But don't worry, I don't think it was ever possible to unlock the keg version and they've disabled the punch bowl function. No more leaving Nukashine out for unsuspecting camp visitors. For now at least.
---
Why didn't your dad pull out?
---
They should have used caps instead of scrip. That would be a major cap sink
---
You sure you didn't scrap it instead of storing it? Stored items still take up camp budget so storing wouldn't have let you build your tent.
---
Both of you make good points. I just feel like it‚Äôs easier for anybody to make a fortune with serums. It was going on during this last dupe stint and is going strong. Also it seems when people dupe, prices go down. As more and more people learned about making caps with duping, prices went up. Serums used to be 100 standard. A set of recipes 19k. Not so much anymore.
---
Do you know the definition of insanity?
---
That's a great idea, a nice cap sink too considering there's still a lot of caps in circulation.
---
Yeah definitely, they could get really creative and make a lot of variations with it. Maybe even make a mod that does some real damage
---
It was in Savage Divide. My camp is South of white springs in the mountains. He was south of my camp and we ended at that hotel the overseer died (not died) at.
---
This won't change until parents become more aware of the content of the games they're buying. They wouldn't take these kids to see an R rated movie because of language, violence, and nudity, then you get on call of duty and 2 7-year olds calls you the N-word. I let my 9-year old play CoD WWII because he's really into the history and we educate him on violence in video games, and the language wasn't really anything you wouldn't hear in a Marvel movie. We ended up selling CoD BO4 after a couple days because whatever the narrator character said was just mindless "Shoot that motherfucker and shove a knife up his fucking ballsack until you turn it into a pussy just like the pussy he truly is". Its so obvious they just wanted the douchey-est monster-energy-drink-fueled tough guy voice over and completely lost any historical appeal or accurate representation of war and the things you might say realistically in the moment.
---
Press (E) to herd.
---
I recently paid 3 caps a piece for 250 screws because I'm trying to build and scrap handmades to unlock all the mods. Worth every cap IMO.
---
I wear mine with the Enclave jacket and Scout hat and look like I should be in the Nazi party. Looks pretty dope though.
---
Lottery would be cool but pointless with the cap limit at 2500. I spend caps just for the helluva it now.
---
Nope, keep it up. The game has a hard limit of 25,000 caps, random mule #4 shouldn't be wasting my time with machines full of random crap for 4999 caps.
---
You hit it right on the head there. I have all the weapons I want really (except for my Shovel) so I just do the scrip for fun and the hunt for my shovel and then my weapon collection will be complete.
---
That's the exact scenario that had me run out.
---
I got a piece of armour and it had the effect of 15% less limb cripple, im almost positive that wasn‚Äôt in the game prior to the patch ive never seen the effect on anything on the market nor have i seen it on any excel spreadsheet nor have i had it drop for me personally until now
---
That's kind of my point .. I need enough information to decide if I want to buy something or perhaps wait to discover it. The reason for not taking a chance is that I don't have spare caps to waste on something I don't need or think I do but the plan/recipe sucks.
---
Idk the problem with armor is wood pieces that turn into crap lol
---
Okay. I would.
---
Even if hey raised it to 1,200 my character would still be encumbered...
---
I have been saving mine up til i get to 1000 again and then spending them, its not as fun getting a few 2* weapons or one or two 3* a day
---
Good shit
---
You should call it nose picker
---
It's one of many locations, it's just easily the "worst" one since it gives a serious advantage. I wouldn't mind having bases on top which are like normal
---
That's ok thanks for the help. Really just looking for confirmation that its affecting more than just me
---
What's with the melee and flying bugs? It's always 0%?
---
Then through you I shall go. 
---
Beavers were the key to opening up the northwest once... and they shall be again.
---
100% more achievable than all the camera challenges for those of us who still haven't found one.
---
[This is an amazing idea!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpkbvr/can_the_free_range_event_have_a_notification/env3xnp/)
---
I had expected that I could have the 30 seconds needed to store my aid before all hell broke loose. For me the biggest frustration wasn't being killed, but that it was just incredibly high level players dropping everyone before they could put up a fight. I was looking forward to PvP, but never got the chance to actually engage in the "vs" part of it
---
Well played!! ...like a game that stuck to nice round numbers
---
Interesting. Want to move my camp but also dreading the stock reset. Might try this.
---
I have no data to prove it, just assumptions based on what I've observed on gameplay.  If you want to try testing it yourself, I recommending finding yourself a somewhat open environment with medium-leveled super mutants.
---
The sound test is easy.  Take off the perk, wear your armor, and sneak around (But not in front of) a super mutant from within an area it can't see you.  You can even sneak behind it.  Try running in stealth mode, and then walking.  You'll see that your caution meter moves even though it can't see you.  That's sneaking sounds at work.  
---
Next test, try sneaking without any armor on, and see if you notice any difference in how quickly a super mutant becomes aware of you by sound only even when it can't see you.  Then, finally, compare that to sneaking with escape artist both with armor on, and without, and see if you notice any notable difference, I didn't, so I assume that having Escape Artist completely removes the effects of movement sound, therefore mods like muffled are redundant with it.
---
* Camp budget bugs have been mostly cleared up, but it's still a limiting factor.
---
* Workshops still are ephemeral, but I'm kind of okay with that, especially since workshops give you an initial grade of resources to use so going above and beyond that costing each time is fine.
---
* The 1400 vendor caps are now in one shared pool so you only have to hit up one vendor to sell, but it is still a hard cap on sales.
---
* Player vending does alleviate some of the vending issues.
---
* Legendary exchange for scrips also helps get rid of some of the hoarding, but it's hard capped at 160 scrip a day too.
---
All this being said, I'm a fairly casual player sitting on level 57 on my highest toon and I am sitting at 750+ in stash and 200+ on person almost constantly.  An extra 200 for the stash would be nice.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but are you okay in the head..? Like honest to god this isn‚Äôt even trolling I think you‚Äôve actually lost it man. Try another trade, trolling doesn‚Äôt fit you
---
This is a helpful lil table you got there. Thank you. I still like the strength / reduced weight but really the first perk + swing speed is all that matters to me too. Lower stars don't get enough love - I really enjoyed my 1 star bloody handmade you know?
---
Thank you
---
Ok so is there any other effects that was activated or was this more of fixing up the legendary tables to ensure everything is in now
---
Doesn't matter the build. Pick a combination of 3 great effects on a weapon. That weapon is extremely rare. Your weapon of choice could be a furious fire rate minigun with reload speed. 
---
Doesn't matter what combo it is. The chances of you getting the drop you want are 1 in 346,410. Maybe a little more now that a few items have been added to the legendary table.  That is a 0.0000003% chance.
---
You solo fine.  But don‚Äôt be surprised if you are teaming up with folks online. Join a trade subReddits‚Äîthey make a good game even better.
---
I'm a little addicted to fo so it can't be dead Lol
---
Sounds like we think alike 
---

I‚Äôm taking that AA LmG name nice names
---
Considering that most wastelanders I run across are female, despite the fact that its statistically unlikely that the real person playing them is one, I'm surprised they haven't given us more options for dresses.  I, for one, would like a strappy yellow sundress and floppy wide brimmed straw hat.  I think it would compliment my Tesla rifle perfectly.
---
I had one squeaker shooting at me with his pipe revolver and taunting saying "you cant kill me theres no PvP its fallout!" and laughing.
---
Imagine the shock in his voice when I killed him with my shotgun. Ensue the crying and screaming that I bullied him.
---
I wouldn't. And if you want to play the downvote game that also works
---
Lol, maybe. I scrapped my Brahman pen to have budget to build a turet, then a fire. Then the tent. I thought I was being careful. But after reading these responses, I'm not 100% sure. It's still gone, nevertheless.  Still have like 7 cats though.
---
You should be good if you start now. People are making alternate characters all the time. 
---
Plus the community is really good. Most people love to help new players when they first come out.
---
I went to the number 3's camp once planning to kill the number 3, got stuck, and ended up having a conversation about my sticky situation. We then went on a player-killing spree as friends.
---
Can't stop that when I can make 12 characters.
---
How exactly do you think caps inflation is related to WTT only gear? I want the thing I want, not to hold 25k caps and an empty bag of hope for rng or player vendors.
---
I think you know how easy it is to get caps, and how hard it is to grind 3\*s, so you just want to shop instead of doing the work.
---
I would love a safety deposit box that you can pay caps to drop things off an then pick them up from another character. Would be really handy for caps and items alike.
---
Thanks. Honestly I got the idea watching Captain Noob and him going to "muties plaza" with it. Reminded me of a supermarket with dead super mutants everywhere.
---
As i spawn there is the jumping up and down, the moving forward, backward, then side to side. I am stuck. Someday i will have to watch that film to know the reference.
---
yeah item in the trading machine should not count on our stash weight some stuff are allmost impossible to trade because of this (power armor piece) without busting our stash limit
---
They had hide tanning benches in 4 so it would be easy to port over
---
Lmao well aren't you a pissy little cunt. I didn't down vote you bud, but now I will lol dumbass.
---
It needs more than that. Their needs to be an IQ test before entering the event so I can stop getting ‚ÄúImalowlevelandhavenocluewhatimdoingxx69‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúlookatmeimgonnalettheanimaldiewhileIfiendforacrappylegendaryxx420‚Äù
---
158 isn't high lvl? Wtf
---
Truth be told, a while back I teamed up with a guy and he was like,‚Äù let‚Äôs FT to site Alpha and launch a Nuke!‚Äù
---
I was like,‚ÄùUmmm.  I can‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm overencumbered.‚Äù
---
Him, ‚ÄúHow much. just drop some in your stash.‚Äù
---
Me, ‚Äú1400 and my stash is full...‚Äù
---
Him,‚ÄùAwww, Hell no!  Dude, we‚Äôre fixin‚Äô this.‚Äù
---
And my stash/carry intervention was born.  
---
But since then, especially since vending machines, I‚Äôm hoarding again.
---
I believe it's +10% damage per addiction, up to +50%. Considering most addictions have trivial SPECIAL debuffs, a constant +50% for each shot is pretty good imo.
---
They probably haven‚Äôt figured out what to do yet. When I joined the event alone I didn‚Äôt know where to get the stuff for the feeders, so I just wandered around killing everything shown as a threat.
---
i had the same issue and you won‚Äòt be able to place the blueprint either.
---
Had to remove everything around the stairs to get rid off it....
---
Oh wow that‚Äôs pretty annoying; I have one I honestly have never tested it
---
There is definitely an advantage towards the players that got serum recipes off of Queen drops compared to those that reached that level of play after the change in drop tables. I still find it hard to swallow the serum recipes price tag just to get into the serum game.
---
True
---
Okay fortnutgod6969
---
That's new. When'd they become popular? All the craze was 2-shot explosives (or TSE for cool kids) ages ago, but understandably due to the nerf, it's calmed down. Did they become popular after the nerf? Yes. Probably.
---
When you see many people over lvl 200,300 some one being 158 is low
---
I'd love a reason not to mutate. Marsupial, healing factor, speed demon are just too good.
---
Damn straight!  Been saying this for months.
---
For basic functionality, the camp as it exists is more than adequate. You can make a farm and grow your food, have all the workbenches, and some turrets to protect your shit. You can have your vending machines, and your water purifiers. 
---
This is, specifically and exclusively, for those of us who enjoy building big, cosmetically pleasing well decorated player houses. Which is fun, but not a required part of the core gameplay loop like weapon and armor workbenches are.
---
I have one up there and I never use it for PvP or exploits. I just like how it feels like a legit place to stay for shelter in an apocalyptic world.
---
Best way to counter is to drop something useless first on a flat area, see if bag pops up, drop second thing yo actually wanted to drop
---
800 is even rounder. It's made of 4 circles.
---
The literal easiest would be to patch over the creation club skins
---
I think I finally.found my spirit animal
---
Honesty id just take a way to share / transfer caps at a minimum
---
I can see you have high intelligence
---
Yea I so regret not buying a set months ago.
---
No prob. That was my exact situation to, second character and I wanted to try something different from my p.a melee main so I went with a kinda stealthy sniper
---
Lmfao
---
You‚Äôre camp icon is always orange but the icon itself changes when you power up the vending machines.  
---
It would be too confusing for new players if it was green, like all of the others
---
I watch him too. Love his videos. Changed my build since day one
---
If I had a good 'Instigating' melee weapon, I'd name it "Sucker Punch".
---
So less ways to get caps or more ways to get legendaries could help. Babushka garrahan is the step in right direction
---
The camp budget has never increased. There has been no announcement (that I'm aware of, anyway) that sates that it's even in the plans. 
---
We've seen increases to STASH budget. Not to camp size.
---
I sell mole miner gauntlet plans for 0 caps. Nobody buys them
---
I am just an altruist my friend. I'd rather see a player rack up the weapon of his dreams to play the games than to lock himself into that role of trader and adopt that condescending tone for nothing but virtual weapons.
---
You're right, I'm a bad person.
---
When you're reporting a player, it is *pretty much* industry standard to either give no feedback, or at most a 'thank you, we've taken appropriate actions based on your feedback'.  You will *NOT* get detailed information about someone getting banned or not, and most companies will at most tell you they've received the complaint.
---
Bug reports are different, a lot of times they don't want to let any information loose that could be exploited, so acknowledging a bug might not happen.  But other times they'll give more information.  I think it relates a lot to how big the company is.  Bethesda is big enough that they may not take the time to individually acknowledge bug reports (it would take a whole lotta hours to get that personal).
---
As far as the time it takes to fix things...it can take a long time to figure out what's wrong, figure out a way to fix it, test to make sure that it doesn't break 100 other things, and then roll that into one of the updates (which at least on console has a whole different cycle for approvals through MS/PS).  It can take quite a while if it's not a literal game-breaking problem.
---
They have said many times it is not an option, you would know this if you read any of those posts.
---
I have never seen a lvl 300. Highest I've seen is like 270.
---
You're right.  It's not useful at all.  It will be removed next patch.
---
I mean there's definitely way more to do than just... grinding for caps/scrips? Find things you actually like doing instead of just "I have to get my max vendor caps/scrips" unless that's what you only like to do and if that is so then I am sorry :/ 
---
Don't you like exploring or dressing your character or having people to play with / help other people or building your camp, finding stupid stuff to hunt for like a legendary shovel with swing speed?
---
I would straight up build a PVP character just for that mode. Otherwise playing survival is going to make you very sad.
---
I do and I‚Äôm taking that name now. Cool movie
---
I literally just looked at the post that said we should have 1000 because it‚Äôs a nice round number
---
Literally made a character during double exp weekend and grounded soooo long to get to level 50 just so I could run around with an absolute beast of a chainsaw...next week they made my character worthless. 
---
Now I have to use a damn super sledge :(
---
Says the guy who just threw a tantrum over getting a down vote and then blaming it on the wrong person? Yeah your opinion means a ton to me mate, a ton.
---
Sounds like a bad day in Appalachia for you, my condolences.
---
Great write up, thanks for this. 
---
Been a while since I spent much time in Charleston or New Gad so I‚Äôll have to make some more trips back over there.
---
Curious about the place in the mire now. I‚Äôll make sure to poke around some of the buildings there and see if I can find the spot your thinking of.
---
I'll add to the upvotes üòâ
---
a thousand times this
---
Highest I've seen was 376
---
100 isn't infinite. They are working their way up to 1000 but that will be the limit.
---
I love this
---
I'll add to the upvotes to help curcumvent his trolling. üòâ
---
Fixed? Dude, every update they have removed more and more ways to build at camp. Every damn update, some piece that used to snap or place just fine is no longer allowed. It‚Äôs only going to get worse until everyone can only build cubes.
---
Jeez, that's high. I'm 75
---
Right but you've suggested INFINITE space which would just be too hard to handle - if the servers struggle with 800carry space what makes you think they can handle unlimited?
---
But that's exactly what you're doing...
---
Lol. 
---
On the other hand I have noticed something strange happening with PvP. 
---
I haven't been initiating PvP at all, and yet still manage to get killed with TSE. Not sure if people are using exploits but Ive tested it, I won't be in combat with a player and yet they still one shot me.
---
They're only getting 50 caps out of it but I've got a Tse myself with all the auto rifle perks, tank killer and bloody mess too. But I dont find myself capable of killing players that quickly even of they're in PvP with me. 
---
Maybe it's my horrid luck. But I typically don't do PvP anyway. Only in the rare circumstance where someone is harassing me in game. I've had people follow me to settlements and prevent me from taking them when they were unowned. Or take them with in minutes of me taking and building them up. I get harassed alot in this game when it comes to players.... It's a little weird. My friends even call it out.
---
Bloodied Death Tambo named Fuck, because that is usually what I say when it breaks.
---
Hmm, speaking of rust, maybe there should be more return of material based on durability (like 2 screws back at 75% + for a handmade) That would make steel runs worse but easier mod learning and gaining of rarer mats at the cost of cheap ones might be something to consider.
---
Still think we should have a very large potential but locked behind bigger and bigger junk hurdles, not necessarily infinite, bad choice of words on my part
---
Yeah he apparently had 2000 hours in the game

Got a couple pics further away. Hard to get any good photos of it since it's so huge, and the camera doesn't zoom far from yer character. I'd love to see how it looks from a more aerial view but can't find a high perch nearby. https://imgur.com/a/1RoqF9w

Also, paper bags should ONLY be allowed to collect by those who dies &amp; drops during Nuke events. Only time you can get flux is during them. Players will watch you die, then take your bags. If not, then make flux non-junk so it‚Äôs not lost. Work as a team to defeat enemies to only be stabbed in the back by getting your bag taken. WRONG!
---
So... turns out you can take a workshop (well, some workshops) like Poseiden then you can scrap the door on it and replace it with your own. I cover the hole in the roof with a bed or something then I replace and lock the door with a level 3 lock then I stuff all the containers inside with mats that I scavenge from the area. I just keep scavenging until i have all the containers just full of mats then I make all the stuff i gotta make. I can leave the mats in the containers in the shed with the locked door and if no one takes the workshop from me (and they haven't in some long time) I have like a little storage area for a few hours... collect fusion cores while out collecting mats
---
"I wish the was more" to your argument...(that's me complaining) I've already addressed this. there are craftable items like the frog in the jar. The hedge cat, deathclaw the flamingos. 
---
In the underlining reason to your wanting a live pet that can walk around like a real boy *Pinocchio reference* is to be able to easily replace them without having to do the grind again
---
So i ask the rhetorical question why do you want this change? 
---
To make it easier to maintain having a pet right?
---
And trolling is arguing without a main point unfortunately your clearly the troll. You jump for one topic to the next. No wonder you think my comprehension skills are horrible  your communication skills deplorable. I've made my point my thesis and my conclusion..

Your complaining and now crying about being called out lol
---
Case closed
---
This too is great for reducing the time of farming 1400 on each char. Max out one at a time and forget about them a bit
---
I'm happy just being able to share atleast Something.

Backpack skin? Is it a reward from the event? Sucks I can‚Äôt complete it because of the scrubs but maybe one day lol

For sure. I‚Äôll be sure to find a friend or 2. Thanks a bunch!

I see you deleted your comment

13 day old account?

Sweet! Good to know :)

Yeah I personally wouldnt mind using atoms as well to get a transfer token or something too
---
Seriously! I woke up logged on and went straight to the silo to launch a nuke, all for nothing. I just got ripped big time TWICE. What else are we supoosed to do at endgame because my strat apparantly is working.
---
Pretty much. Tbh I‚Äôm just tired of hearing/seeing about it. We all get it it‚Äôs the best in terms of dmg. Move on. Invent some new form of pushing the infinite damage ceiling.
---
hell ya, will do!
---
Given player vending and the fermenter, I wouldn't mind this.
---
But I also think 800 works without having to get all frugal about what you keep.
---
Oil is used to repair some weapons
---
First one is tankier, second breaks quicker but has more dps.  If you are in a fight that lasts a long time I would take the first, otherwise I would take the second.
---
You can eat uncooked meat without a disease chance.  Spoiled meat will still infact give you a disease.

I think 1000 is fine just need to manage a little...

At work at the moment. It'll be about four hours until I can get on. What do you have for trade? I'd be interested in rare outfits or 2-3 unyielding marine right arm or leg pieces.

Yeah I know all that. Just seems like if he gets loads of reports per day for his \*extremely obvious\* hacking then they don't pay attention to IG reports to often, we've submitted about 2 hours worth of footage of him hacking to no avail over the course of 2 months, incl. discord logs of him "boasting" about it.
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind, and definitely get a few friends. Thanks man :)

Well I just made this reddit acount because I use it for alot of advice and tips for fo76, and started posting as well to see if people are having the same problems

How do you have " bulk " screws. I have 280 loose screws at this moment . But I can't bulk them . And I haven't seen them in a vendor in weeks. Back in January they had a patch where they increased the chances to find repair materials in vendor machines/ robots. But since I started looking again , these past few weeks, I haven't seen bulk screws anywhere. Screws are easy to find, and I wish I could bulk all my junk, helps me stay organized.
---
Sad but true
---
Contextually I'm not. Being selfish and self righteous in a game like this is garbage and the fact that you're so hurt about that that you need to keep replying while trying very hard to look like you aren't upset but also need to downvote every comment shows me that it's justified. But keep being you Oscar. ;D
---
I read that too fast. Thought you said Naughty Queen Runs üòú
---
What‚Äôs your plan once you find your shovel.
---
2000 HOURS?!? JESUS. In all honestly though, I think 158 is high-level. Anything below lvl 100, I would accept someone calling low-level.
---
The 800 stash space is **ABSOLUTE BLASPHEMY!**
---
This camp system is so much worse than FO4s, and FO4s had lots of problems.
---
I'd be happy with craftable "Vaults" or "Gun Safes" that we could stash items in. Make these vaults placeable in our camp and only accessible at our camp. I don't need to be able to access all of my legendary Melee and Ranged weapons from every stash in the world.
---
Legit question: why does this matter? I‚Äôve lurked gaming subreddits for years and only made an account a few weeks ago for 76 and I‚Äôve been playing since December.
---
This is cringy as fuck.

Now that i know you can surpass the two shot i might even try it out on my non bloodied vats crit sniper. Hate the two shot accuracy and cant find a aae, this might be a good alternative.

You can put crops up there. I have some.

Sorry, you‚Äôre right, it is yellow.

I *finally* got around to trying that location. Hell, at level 145+ I still hadn't discovered it :P
---
Charleston is a fair bit quicker to run.  But at Soft Serve, it seems like you have 2 locations, one in each direction (and some random spawn event I don't quite understand in the middle).  I don't know if the bot can spawn at both, but it does give you something else to look at while you're hopping.

I will scream triumph from the rooftops and then proceed to beat anything and anyone I come into contact with to death with it. *BONK*
---
just put the bulked items away before scrapping lol
---
Collect plastic and you can bulk items at a tinkers workbench, be careful when scraping junk when you have anything bulk in your inv because it will un-bulk so you‚Äôll lose all the plastic you farmed to make those bulk wrapped items. Best ways to find plastic is to pick up all the plastic cups and pizza trays and all the white plastic from the amusement part at the lower left hand side of the map. Basketballs and bowling pins are also plastic it will be super helpful to mark all the items you will need to search for in the future so when you accidentally come across them in the wasteland you don‚Äôt just walk past. Learn to do these things and you‚Äôll save tons of space and you can sell bulk items to npc vendors. You can‚Äôt sell reg junk to them. Sometimes I‚Äôll need some caps so I‚Äôll bulk a shitload of useless things I don‚Äôt need and have a lot of like cloth and glass and get some space back and caps.
---
pics?
---
This is difficult to listen to.
---
Telling someone what to do isn't the same as making them do it.  But I think we both understand what the other is saying.
---
Can't bulk screws at tinker workbench
---
Well, crap. No solutions?
---
It's to keep you playing every day, if caps/scrips/atoms were there all the time you would say "ahhhhh I'll get these on Saturday and have a big gaming session." but then you would just put it off saying "I can do it later" and end up not playing at all that day
---
*checks down votes*
---
It just increases the ammount you get from scrapping, rather than making you get more of the less common components, so it's more useful for some things than others, Maining a .50 Cal, for example- one assault rifle with my current build and scrapper yields 18 steel. Three assault rifles for 180 rounds, when I kill super Mutants in a few hits from it is not that bad, all things considered. Now I just need to find a way to get more Lead...
---
Spiper rifle, Boomstick and I forgot the pipe revolver name.
---
Because if I see a new account that has a post history largely criticizing the game I suspect trolling.   Perhaps my assumptions are invalid in your case.   Time will tell.
---
The urban scout mask, or the marine recon work pretty well. Military hat works as well.

Your right I never thought of all the useless items I have the only items I pay attention to have weight to them.

unfortunately I wasn't able to get good quality because it was super sudden and i didn't expect him to try and interview him, I do turn up the volume very early on

I answered your question in response to a similar question posed by OP.

Me too...I live almost exclusively on carrot soup.  My patch of 10 carrots keeps me fed for all of my (relatively short) play sessions each night, with an occasional purified water to balance out how much water I need vs how much food.

I haven't played it awhile - can someone catch me up on what project paradise is?
---
i mean you can still get weightless sentinel which doesnt take away the invisibility, i doubt any higher level players would go with no armor at all

Have you considered..  actually, never mind, enjoying being naked and just standing around.

Yes!!!!!

It shouldn't matter too much tbh - I've been playing since beta and lurking the whole time and only made an account recently.

This title was descriptive...
---
I too walk around near permanently encumbered.  The great thing about being encumbered is 36 lb over is just as bad as 400 lbs over (because once you are 36 lbs over, you can't just bufftat and ragstag stew your way to fast travel).
---
Can we get an automod to automatically black out the phrase ‚Äúfreedom of speech‚Äù, and replace it with a short paragraph explaining that freedom of speech has absolutely nothing to do with anything most people try to apply it to?
---
it depends on the stains. lol eh i grossed myself out. enough reddit for today :-)
---
I'm lvl 225 and my friends are about the same. No armor can protect you in PvP anymore so the best thing to do is just be invisible and never get hit at all.
---
because electrons aren't unlimited
---
It would be cool if we had a mailbox we could use to send items between other players and our other characters. 
---
A safe storage at Whitesprings Resort makes sense as well for our multiple characters.
---
Its worked so far. Can find a good set of weigtless.
---
Many of the WS turrets camps were set up by little kids, I heard many times when they scream ‚Äòomg omg mama i got another one, there‚Äôs another one‚Äô.  Only one time it was a very old gentleman, who not only used turrets to steal kills but was also actively griefing whoever spawned there with a TSE shotgun. So basically he wanted to steal everything including players caps. His grand kids or some little relatives were there to watch his back. It‚Äôs just a video game but people bring who they are right into it.
---
And wearing a plague doctor mask while doing so.   Good times.
---
If (when?) events are on-demand, this might work better.  But as long as events are time-based and/or random, putting together a group doesn't guarantee that the event you want to do will be active.
---
Only using LFG *when* the event is active might work, if the tool could put together a whole group in a short time frame.  But if it took more than a few minutes, some events may time out before you can get going.
---
You just gotta keep trying at it. It's really frustrating sometimes with a lot of the bugs and crashes but it's still worth playing to me. I lost my first set of power armor and the materials to make it which took me lots of grinding because of a server crash - my first nuke - no one showed up to fight the queen - it's frustrating - but there's always tomorrow to try again.
---
It‚Äôs ugly, I want to use other headgear.
---
if you start hearing Persona 4 music, *RUN*
---
Honestly. I dont feel like going through the hassle of that right now.
---
For a while I was bulking anything over 200 of each junk item and selling it to the vendors to keep it under control, but my current problem is Aid. Every once I a while I find myself flipping through aid and wondering how I ended up with 22 radstag ribs, or 30+ razorgrain soup.
---
Weightless sentinel is still hard to find.
---
Stop. My nipples can only get so erect.

Its 30 1 star legendaries for 150 scrips, so 30 legendaries killed each day. Without nuking (as thing brings swarms of players to the site so its hard to obtaining legendaries reliably) we have resorted to farming 3 events. The mole miner event, wolves event and the music at night event ( dont remember their names ). The mole miner one and the wolves gives 3 1*-3* while the music event gives 1 1*-3*. If we do these events as they appear we potentially gain 7 legendaries which can gain anywhere from 105 scrips to 35 scrips assuming to get all 3* and all 1* each time. We don‚Äôt server hop like crazy and we stay in one server as we take over the ammo factory and find server hopping super boring/annoying. So the event show up anywhere between 1-2 hours after completion and our average play time is about 3-4 hours a day. Each day we average 50-65 scrips from events and protecting the factory if we get lucky and there arent many players farming and speed killing the legendaries. So math time. 
---
65(high number) scrips each day * 3 people = 195 scrips (round it to 200 to make it easier) 
---
200s = 2 legendaries per day (assuming we get a good run and we get the highest amount of scrips we usually get) 
---
7 days a week * 200s = 14 legendaries a week for 3 people. 
---
If the legendaries arent what we want (been the case so far) and we scrap them all that is
---
15s per 3*(14) = 210s = legendary
---
2+14 = 16 legendaries a week (if all are scrapped) plus an additional 30s if we scrap those. 
---
Now for the low numbers. 
---
50s * 3people = 150s per day * 7 = 1050s =10 legendaries a week
---
We have yet to find any good legendaries as most are exterminator gear or useless perks. Best gear we found was a 2 shot black powder pistol but none of us use pistols. In conclusion we need a bump in scrip drops so we can finish our builds. 
---
Also i know 3-4 hours a day isnt crazy but thats the best we can do lol.
---
Do you just stay logged in all day? One time I had to go but didn‚Äôt want to leave my bullets behind and everyone had left the server so I was chilled so I put a hair tie on my controller from the stick to the trigger(I‚Äôm on Xbox) and I turned on happy camper (max I think, might just take one card to have max though)and left for like two hours and I had barely lost any hunger was super disappointed the ammo workshop only lets like 1200 or 1500 I can‚Äôt remember tbh.
---
It has to be a combination of the two. I won't sell a useful legendary below about 500 caps, and that is typically a useful effect on a unpopular weapon. Anything that has a useful primary on a popular weapon is gonna be sold for 1k+ caps. This is just because no one has an excuse to not be able to raise that caps in the same day. Even then I probably spent more time sifting sand yo get the item than the buyer did getting the caps.
---
If you're on xbox, let me know what you want for your Assassin's sentinel set.
---
Ok. Thanks. This is actually the first time my camp is yellow as before the update it was always green. Will check next time I am on.
---
 Because what they said is true. We do live in one of the most prosperous times in history. That's not to say violence doesn't happen or that there are no injustices in the world. Fewer people are dying of disease, war and famine then any other time in history despite our having the most people on the planet, ever.
---
Build more Camps, more often
---
I bought a lever action rifle and when I went to equip it I couldn't find it in my inventory I thought the game screwed me but then I see something in my wepons called pip pip it was the gun

Did the download start are 0?
---
61gb is the full game
---
Same feeling. I swap characters or toss.
---
*f o n d a m e n t a l y   f l a w e d*
---
Im not a troll im looking for solutions. What would be the point? As if the game didnt have server issues and glitches. You do remeber when the game first came out right? They have came along way dont get me wrong but i just went through two huge problems all in the same hour. I gained absolutely nothing launching a nuke and using legendary scrip i grind for. I lost
---
Super duper+craft lowest level, they are so rare and very few world spaqns.
---
Fair enough!
---
Nope, not click that and expanding their ego and bank account lol
---
Last time we discussed him on here he kinda did change a bit for the better, but hes still dependent on whatever is trending on reddit for info
---
I have no idea, but would expect it to place them with similar players in matchmaking rather than pro or intermediate players.
---
That works great until the server crashes or boots you out.
---
seeing as how we can break down hides into leather at any bench... I just want cosmetic stuff to make my cabin look like a place where a hunter/trapper lives.
---
All three are more or less the same. However, Charlie seems to have less robots, but more turrets. Personally, I go to Charlie because I feel like it‚Äôs easier than the other two.
---
Weightless sentinal. Lol.
---
Almost level 200, no mutations here.
---
Ad Victorium!
---
I‚Äôm sure someone in the community has done it before, but it‚Äôs a cool idea.  I‚Äôd like to bet on fights, but balancing seems like a hassle for each match.
---
Best part is every one of those guys that spawn camped you or raped you with their duped god tier gear actually think they are good at pvp when in reality all they have done is stack the cards so much in their favor they dont have to be even remotely good at it.
---
I like having scrips be a different currency as it encourages you to use caps on vendors and trading players. Though maybe having 1 three star piece of gear being sold for 3000 caps each week or for a set scrips amount would be nice. Just a set roll that everyone gets.
---
An actual bsod is a hardware problem.
---
Best to check your event viewer and get to fixing.
---
So if I want to focus on his endurance then build my character around that ?
---
I'll be on the lookout for it.
---
That's a fine solution IF nobody takes the workshop from you. They need to just give in and let us build item containers in CAMP that are separate from the Stash. Make them lockpickable or something, I don't care, but 800 simply is not enough.
---
Funny how you guys are the same people that complained when people were raiding your camps. Complained so much that they removed CAMP damage. See? You were all assholes all along. Hypocrites.
---
We spend them when we get 100 each time lol.
---
Im still playing, it wasnt my first time getting screwed oflver in fo76 lol. I just kinda came here to vent not to be criticized lol. Not saying you are but some others
---
Grafton steel has a lead deposit, not sure what other workshops have it.
---
Or, if you find one in the wild, build your camp near the deposit.
---
The ammo factory is pretty slow but at least it doesn't have a cap on the amount that can pile up.
---
If you find it and cant afford it let me know, I'll still give you a finders fee.
---
Want to make pvp great? Remove all legendary effects of armors and weapons when players fight each other, equalize damage for the same weapon so a level 1 hunting rifle does the same damage as level 50 when it hits a player. This will make pvp great and fair. Until then it‚Äôs nothing but dupers and ebay armor‚Äôs playground.
---
Thank you!!! I appreciate it, I‚Äôve been stacking up on it now
---
That actually sounds like a good laugh.
---
Man I barely get paid at my job, you think youtube will ever pay me? XD
---
*Fondlementally?*
---
I say launch 21 nukes over 7 servers people will tell stories of you to there wasteland grandkids.
---
That's what I mean, they were decorative hide tanning benches. I'm pretty sure they were added with Far Harbor
---
I have this currently as my C.A.M.P on xb1 feel free to visit üòä
---
I‚Äôm not prepared to take that chance.
---
And duper servers besides asking players on legit trading discords if he could have end game gear, probably because he didn't want to ask duper friends
---
I can confirm I used mine, area chat not teamed up, with no problems calling out legendaries for peeps to get their hits on.
---
Feels like half my game time is playing inventory management. 1000 would be nice.
---
By moving to the hill southeast of the Cowspot Creamery, that's how.
---
I once went to WS to do a clubhouse run and when I got there, saw a solid concrete foundation base with a ton of sirens and they were all on. I was mesmerized by it. It was in the area where people put turret bases and I assume it was there to block player turrets
---
If you're basing your build on one specific combination on one specific weapon, yeah you're gonna be disappointed.  Widen that gap to a small set of weapon types (like any rifle, or 2H melee), and have a little flexibility on the effects (would reduced weight *really* break your build if you wanted reload speed?), and that number becomes a whole lot more manageable.
---
Or, once you're higher level, adjust your spec to what you find.  I *really* need an AAE reload speed hunting rifle, but I can easily work with a ghoul slayers's explosive (anything) handmade, and with very little work I can retool to use any number of nice automatics or heavy guns.  I may not be able to go bloodied melee at the drop of a hat, but I have plenty of viable options with just a few perk changes.
---
Sorry for the necro but its used in psycho and I think some  chem mixes that use psycho
---
There's your problem. Server hopping is part of the game, I know it sucks but you really have to if you want to get nice things. I've not had much luck getting nice legendaries - aside from 1 star weapons I've never gotten a piece of armor or weapon that I still use now but I've been able to sell/trade for things I do want. 
---
Server hopping is the best way to accomplish what you're doing. Each new server you can do the events all over again or server hop a specific one. You need it for alot of things - from the possum badges from doing Campfire tales at camp adams or getting lots of legendaries from doing Arktos Pharma or AWOL etc. Staying on one server all day is a good way to get ammo and maybe some resources but that's not going to further your legendary cause at all :(
---
You guys are not nice people.
---
I did a tribute to Mason in my camp, will try to post pics later
---
It is and will always be imperfect.   But it is relatively stable now‚Äîand it serves no one to create the misapprehension that it is as flawed as it was before.  I want this franchise to succeed.
---
SHHHH keidjeidbxjdbdbd
---
RNG but still better chance for 3 star than off a 1 star enemy. It‚Äôs a lottery we need to get over this.
---
Anthem? Yes, it is really that bad. Worst AAA game out by far. The only redeeming part of the game is the flying, that's literally it.
---
Hahaha, i was too but i started getting a bit salty at my crappy rolls so figured if i wait til i get 1000 might end up with 1 decent roll
---
I have tried four times and the game keeps shutting off.
---
I‚Äôm not the one downvoting my dudes
---
ohhhhhh. I gave up on 4 without ever finishing it. Never played Far Harbor. 
---
Honestly... Preston ruined that damn game for me. (I mean, separate from the fact that Bethesda removed all the RP from the RPG)
---
What do you mean? Im on ps4 of that means anything. Whats the event viewer?
---
Yeah it's great fun when you've got four level 200+ and a scattering of 100s and down, but when it was just me and one other guy it was just an exercise in banging our heads against a wall.
---
Nevermind, I fixed it. It was actually 12gb but was saying 61gb until I freed up space
---
It‚Äôs only overpriced because you cannot afford it? Is this why you guys Nuke people?
---
Furious laser rifle.

It's name is "Breaky Mcgee", because regardless of perks, it will break in 10 minutes.
---
You're just comparing apples to a different kind of apple is all. They're the same genre. F76 is the better survival game my guy
---
I know... but then you get the dilemma of do I move my camp to somewhere tactical, or do I leave it in the nice looking place that I'm happy with. There's always the Converted Munitions factory I guess, but one dropped connection and then I need to claim it again...
---
I got a two shot light machine gun that really made me happy I‚Äôm nick name him needle cause of the hole pharmacy place it‚Äôs at
---
Yeah I know what you mean - it's always funny to me when people criticize people who complain as there's a loooot of complaining on reddit lol 
---
oh man the first time I did actually find a group to do SBQ? we have her at like 2% health and the server crashed and we all DC'd - best believe I was on twitter @ bethesda like W H A T
---
Maybe that's what i thinking, thanks
---
Oh ok. I am on ps4 and checked my camp and has a different icon when I logged back in. They must have changed it this update so it will be easier to find your camp. All it needed was for me to close the game. Thanks so much.
---
oh don't worry, I'm sure Bethesda will make them available for purchase in the atom store for you!
---
Right, so that‚Äôs where all the bloody cameras have gone!!!!
---
When you wanted to know if a game is worth playing and you got existential despair instead

AND THEN DEATHWING SHOWED UP!

Asking a innocent question makes me an asshole and a troll? ü§î

It wasn‚Äôt the meta last dupe wave.  Now that everyone wants it, I‚Äôm sure the duper‚Äôs will mass produce it the next chance they get, weightless/sent or cav.  For now enjoy being naked?
---
Hey! Forgive me if I have offended you. It is not my intention!
---
Except when you already have the best two star weapons, that third star is EVERYTHING. Still tough to get your original weapon plus a meaningful third star, but that's the end-game.
---
Id love to, but im on ps4 :(
---
Oh, you didn't bsod then. Just an app crash.
---
All you can do is send the report when it happens and move on.
---
I was thinking more of 1001
---
This franchise has already succeeded. How many games have they made now? Theres no misapprehension as how the game was released, they were aiming for thier downfall. 
---
I simply came to reddit to vent not to be criticized. We all know the downfalls of the game and make a consciences decesion to continue to play. That dosent mean that the errors and glitches like what just happened to me is ok and dosent need attention.
---
What are you playing on? Because it seems like pc is having a way harder time than consoles. I've played the event like 5 times just last night and not once did I have crashes or even any lag.
---
Did the Free Range thing and it worked good on the Sheepsquatch and hurt no one. ;)
---
Judges?
---
We‚Äôll accept this.
---
Actually I think Appalachia could do with some Johnny Guitar.
---
I also enjoy how literally none of the guns in this game seem to have a single spring inside of them.
---
I have encountered these friendlies before as well and I am stunned every time like 0\_0 I guess we will not fight this day.
---
Dude I'm 600+ hours in and still haven't found but 1 at lvl 20 and I didn't understand how fucking hard it would be to find another so I tossed it , now I'm 2 months into searching , what OTHER places do u search aside from sons of Dane compund????
---
yes, although its rare for him to load it into inventory.  
---
best advice, hop servers until you find him, then when you do, call a friend. take turns. one holds the bot while staying in his inventory screen and then one disconnects and reloads the game. then the one holding lets go and the one reconnecting grabs him to check inventory and hold him while the last person disconnects and comes back.
---
each time you reload his inventory changes and you get another chance to find the coat, rinse repeat until he loads the coat.
---
Its not called super mutant slayer, its called mutant slayer goddamnit
---
You need to work on forming and then completing coherent thoughts.
---
You also need to lay off the weed.
---
Yep now it is. Must have glitches the game when it was green last few times I was on.
---
I'm on xbox. Gonna try again when I get home. This can't last forever, right?!
---
I changed my gamer tag and saw a dramatic drop in sexual garrassment, just by using a new one that most people are clueless about the gender reflection. Is it that?
---
Awww I'm sorry
---
Gonna have to say YTA. If you dont like the prices you have the option to not buy. You just waste a nume to prove your e-peen is bigger, that is all I see here.
---
It will never be balanced. Its just a gimmick
---

Sounds smart, until you get disconnected

I shall relay the message to him
---
You keep coming back whey day though so it works
---
I'd prefer weightless assassins
---
If you can grind out enough materials every day, you can max out your vendor caps and sell the excess serums for any amount, and it‚Äôs all profit. Pricing them that low means people buy them more often, which ends up making more money faster, although it obviously requires more materials. It depends on how easy it is for you to get stable flux. But my point is that it‚Äôs not the dupers selling cheap serums. It‚Äôs the people who spend all day killing the queen or farming whitespring. From their perspective, it‚Äôs a quick and easy 250 caps that‚Äôs guaranteed to sell quickly.
---
This was so wholesome to read.
---
Never received one for a reward, but you can find at least three drills at Garrahan Mining Headquarters if I recall correctly.
---
True, I haven't been disconnected at Poseiden for weeks so there's that one small comfort lol
---
WeirdChamp interview skills. DansGame
---
YES Huge hit and beautifully done. The attention to details is incredible. Great Job Bethesda! 
---
However no, we don‚Äôt have guaranteed three star from any event. Did paradise a few times, the highest was a two star armor, the rest was one star, did an AWOL last night, three 3*** legendary gutsys spawned, all dropped one star armor pieces. The SBQ‚Äôs latest drop for me was a ghoul slayer one star arm. 
---
ISS had always dropped wood pieces since launch but since previous patch they improved it. Got an explosive handmade and a sentinel chest piece from the assaultron sheep so far, thank you for listening!
---
No one is going to take the workshop from me. Trust me.
---
You make a good point... I recently changed my gamer tag to something a little more fem
---
They still haven't bumped it? Haven't played in months I assumed they would. I didn't realize how out of touch Bethesda is.
---
I would also like to know. My instinct says "no" because pay-to-lose is nearly as bad as pay-to-win.
---
Nah I don't just stay logged in, I play.

Absolutely wonderful idea! My buddy and I tried this event last night and we were bummed because it was just us. Would love a server wide announcement!
---
I seriously doubt it. That would fall under pay-to-win I think.
---
Ty!wil try then:)
---
Then all the paid actors stood up and started clapping!
---
So what is the easy mitigation for the downside of  mutations? I got Marsupial totally on accident in a fight with a Glowing One, but the rad hit to my health was way too much to make it worth it. Do people just deal with the chunk of their health permanently missing or what‚Äôs the secret?
---
Agree 100%. This needs to be increased. I'd even say 1500.
---
Or just make a mule.
---
Go outside.
---
Haha, nice! Did you wave goodbye to the scorched beast for not destroying you? Because i would've offered my soul to not get attacked and harassed by one of those things!
---
No, they don't want you playing 20 hours a day, if that's what you're saying.  That's unhealthy and you shouldn't be doing that as a general rule.
---
Aside from deleterious health effects, the game only has so much content, and if you're playing that much, 1) you're going to grind through everything *way* faster than what's intended, and 2) you'll get bored and turn into 900 hour guy trying to justify doing things you're not supposed to just to stay entertained.
---
Moderate your play time a bit - there are other things to do, both online and...what's that other place?  I can't remember...but that's there too if you really run out of things to do.  There are very very few games that will hold up to that kind of play for long.  This is *definitely* not one of them.

Scorchbeasts occasionally fly around passively without engaging players, hence the white health bar.

Couldnt agree more. The vending system is killing my stash
---
I don't think anyone saying the additional space by itself is a bad, but the downsides with it are bad. But as many said, Bethesda can fix other things for server stability too, so,it should balance out if Beth can do it right.
---
Well it works for some people and doesn't for other?  What's the problem then genius?
---
Why do some people dislike Juicehead's videos? I've always felt they've been pretty objective.
---
I'm thinking about locking my camp because of the influx of bedshitters. I'm not kidding. I'll only have to remove the windows. Mostly. Unless they're complete assholes that are willing to lockpick the door or make mobs destroy the base.
---
They already have fish in the streams and fishing rods and a bait mechanic.  GIVE THIS TO US.  I'd get nothing else done in this damn game, I swear.  "I could go do that, or I could try to catch another glowing rainbow..."
---
Like the ones that have the spawn point inside but all the doors are locked and you can't get out unless you waste more caps fast traveling away?
---
I think you got a glitch then. I don‚Äôt melee, ever. Done the event three times and looted it after everyone took their turn. Same for fashnact and encryptid events. I think you just got hosed one time.
---
It's OK if they use the basic 0 level lock as this will help prevent critters getting in and causing trouble.
---
That's a strange take. I'm not a door locker myself, but why does this bother you so much?
---
GT: Atomic Punk 152   level 179 w/mic

That got dark fast.

I think it's just kinda dumb overall to try to sell stuff to other players but they lock the door
---
Datamining heavily suggests &gt;!that the Nuclear Winter update is either centered around or contains some sort of arena functionality!&lt;
---
I could take one, i'm on pc username is the same.
---
What on earth are we doing wrong then??? I get disconnected within 3 hrs 100% of the time.... no matter what im doing. Only two games that do this are Fallout &amp; Reddead (RD2 after last update only).
---
Huh.  Makes sense from a backend standpoint - it must anchor the RefID for each machine so that their associated catalog doesn't just vanish when the machine is removed from the world (by either scrapping or storing).
---
There is something to be said about rotating stock through starting fresh on occasion, but it's pretty nice to have the option.
---
It looks pretty stupid when you call people stupid but don't bother to explain why you think that.
---
Love this idea.
---
Aw that sucks :( If you're looking for a new one I would check the little red tool boxes that you see all over the places- I've had really good luck finding them in there. I know there's several on the road by cars / trucks on the road between the vault and flatwoods!
---
Ah, well that makes sense. My Luck is at 1 and I almost never focus on it. The only reason I‚Äôve ever used it was to get the Mysterious Stranger in the other games. Thanks!
---
what a friend! Good to hear that it worked out for ya! I myself found a bloodied 1* 50 cal, not the 25% FFR like I had before but I'll get there soon enough
---
But if they're selling stuff inside the house they night as well have a turret of some kind
---
Berry mentats. Pop em and check the area for his buddies. Invest in a tesla rifle. Get them close enough together and unload on them. Usually vaporizes the entire team in my experience
---
It doesn't act as a gas mask. I was in the ash heap trying to do the challenge while wearing it and slowly dying in the process
---
Every Facebook post about the game I see is littered with salty, regurgitated bile from people who don't play, and positivity so generic at a glance they could be bots.  Makes sense they'd have to go elsewhere to look for actual opinions.
---
That looks so fresh!! I love it! I can't wait to get it and try to figure out an outfit to go with it.
---
Or maybe your too stupid to look around and see the vending machine is in the back
---
There‚Äôs people looking for them? I have a really nice sledge I‚Äôve been trying to sell. No takers.
---
I love that guy, hes awesome.
---
Like they've locked their vendor machines in their home out of reach?
---
I think it's dumb trying to sell items but yet you lock the door to your house
---
This reminded me of Tom Hollands spiderman
---
Ye I hear that, I tend to favor obscure wepons. The logic for me in having beefy wepons is ammo cost mostly, mo damage = less ammo used
---
Lol see it would save kids that don't know no better from getting ripped off that's why I suggested it they came out with a new vendor system I just thought why not
---
Not all of the time stupid lmao
---
Obligatory link!
---
Why though?  Herbivore, carnivore and healing factor all have very little to no downside
---
No but they trick u by tempting u with exactly what you want
---
Yeah I had the generator for my machine destroyed constantly so I have to lock it with a lvl 0 lock. Anyone can get in and turrets don't do shit for some reason. Everytime I logged in my generator would get destroyed.
---
I think each container should have 250, and act like they did in fallout 4, only having the items you stored in them, not showing items in other containers
---
ahhhh.. you should update your post to indicate that's what you're referring to.
---
That I don't care about, I care when they lock the door but the vending machine is inside
---
I LOVE IT I WANT IT I NEEEEEEED IT!!!
---
What console? I have a bunch of not repaired ones, but cant get on till later. I'm on xbox.
---
Weak. I got up to 900 once.
---
Yeh I probably am, thanks for rubbing it in. 
---
IF my only goal was legendaries, I would absolutely agree. However, I've been trying to get through scout quests, which means I'm overloaded with things to do. Still hunting wabbits - don't know if I've ever seen one but I heard Whitesprings had some somewhere. 
---
I agree burrows was a good farm last time I ran it. Did the brand new event last night with a friend and no-one else joined, and we both crashed hard on the Alpha fight (woo task manager). Got three one-star legendaries for all that effort at least.
---
PSA = Public Service Announcement
---
I have, but mentioning it is an instant downvote magnet.  You think 76 has popularity problems?  It's far from the worst :P
---
IV read more and more of these stories. At WS station a few days ago I had a lvl 200 antagonizing me and a 3 other players that were there scrapping and off loading.
---
I could have easily ended it with 1-2 swings, but I let it be. Another guy there went back at him, he was snipped from a distance from the hill by blackwater mine.
---
IV pretty much always dodged the fights in this game, and that's a reason why.
---
Ah I haven‚Äôt been there since I was pre level 20, probably didn‚Äôt even notice. I‚Äôll have to go back and check it out. Got my first chainsaw last night, had some fun cutting up mongrels
---
I don't see your problem ... "precise receiver" or reflex sight" seems to be a far better description of your tasks than before
---
you're\*
---
Public Service Announcement, I only found out myself a little while ago lol
---
Berry mentats are a good idea. But you're still getting burned down in 1 to 2 seconds after you go red, even if you see them all. Numbers and automatic weapons are the meta.
---
"No, keep playing." -Bethesda

They commonly spawn on the road going uphill west of grafton station.

Haha, public service announcement. That's one of the few I know. Once they start rattling off BBE, AAR, etc, I get lost myself. ü§£

What do you mean anyone can get in
---
It doesn‚Äôt have any negative stats
---
Lame.
---
Legendary Ghoul Slayer's sawed-off double-barrel Shotgun... renamed The Boomstick, naturally! Not very creative, but it seemed appropriate!
---
Oh that might be because they're full on caps and haven't had a chance to move them yet - but they should really turn the power off so their camp doesn't show up if that's the case :/
---
The nerf was well deserved. Assassin's sentinel and cavalier were overly broken and need to remain nerfed.
---
To explain the kinda response you got, F76 has improved a lot and relatively quickly. It started off slow in March but two months after starting out with weekly content updates means improvements were quick and the playerbase is growing not declining. The trade subreddit is proof of this, it's one of the most posted in subs on reddit
---
It's not us it's the game.
---
I didn‚Äôt see it in the patch notes but did you guys happen to change how lenient you are with building structures in camps? I had a treehouse before this patch and I had to remake it as there is a glitch where items will phase through objects when you place them..but when I went to try and rebuild what I had I basically had to place my structures 2 feet or more away and I literally can‚Äôt build my house again or anything remotely similar..I don‚Äôt know if you changed camp building for some reason but it would really be nice if it could at least be looked at because I miss my camp.
---
I read this in the scout leader's voice.
---
The ability to bulk all your resources such as ammo, meds, chems. sounds nice too.
---
I'm not debating that. I agree. But a side effect of that is that you cant solo pvp anymore
---
I was having a pretty down day then I saw this post and giggled up a storm the whole way through. Thank you so much for this post!
---
Turrets are rubbish they never activate, I never bother with them and just use level ) locks on doors and shutters.
---
I personally like seeing the same subjects rehashed over and over again.  It's comforting, and let's me know that I really belong here.
---
(lol)
---
It's a new event. Really hard and really fun. [Look at the release notes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/braydy/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_95_notes_may_21/)
---
I wound up applying ultralight build to every piece of armor I wanted to sell in my camp. Doing that netted me another 100 stash weight space. 
---
Took almost all mods off the weapons unless it somehow made them lighter too.
---
Unless they changed that on tuesday, there is no tax on 1 cap items. i.e u sell for 1 cap, u get 1 cap.
---
Wasn't that what PvP was in adventure originally? I don't think I've ever had a PvP experience where it wasn't 3 or so dude ganking me. Then just laugh when I tried to fight back in they were all in their cheap sent/assain gear.
---
How many animals did you have alive?
---
That's what I've been rallying for since beta. Every item doesn't need to centralize to one giant stash, that's only going to make loading more bursty.
---
It does not -perception and does not work as a gas mask.
---
Check google, theres also 4 posts daily on this sub about whats changed
---
Just farm legendaries, you'll get one =).
---
Missile turrets seem to work wonders compared to normal turrets, as in they actually do damage
---
You're pretty hArD cOrE if you can't get along with children who are just trying to have fun.
---
That‚Äôs my experience as well. Two out of ten might be three star drop when the enemies are three star. Very low chance. Then there‚Äôs still zero star stuff like drill and syringer still being dropped by three star enemies.
---
You can? I thought you couldn't tame passives.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
You need to enjoy the game. Too many people competing to be the best and have all the best stuff. Do quests, challenges, events, with friends or make friends and do it together.
---
If all you want to do is farm it will be boring, as it just becomes routine , and let's be honest. Who wants that?
---
There's no such thing as "Passive."
---
There's more to do than legendary grinding.
---
Most people in adventure mode don't want to pvp which is why survival exists.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll have a look. I‚Äôve raised a ticket and if they can‚Äôt fix it, I think it‚Äôll be quitting time for me as 90% of the quests need the camera.
---
I just simply don‚Äôt understand why so many people even care about wood armor..it‚Äôs kinda rubbish all around and it definitely doesn‚Äôt have the looks to make up for it lol..
---
I think it's funny that even the Mayor sounds exasperated when he says "It's Grafton Day....*again*".
---
Actually we almost fucked up, so only 1 animal alive 
---
Guess it‚Äôs fully random reward
---
If you don't lock your door, even a radroach can open it and get in.
---
Because I'm RPing Brotherhood of Steel. No mutations at all. This isn't about the best build or highest DPS, it's a role play thing. 
---
My alts have (or will have) mutations, but not my main.
---
The forest or green asylum outfits would look good I think.
---
HELLO!
---
True. It should only do that if you're at someone else's camp. Even though loading might be bad, It'd be worth accessing items without having to go all the way back to your camp though.
---
Arktos lab suit maybe
---
And that's where the mule account comes in.
---
Have you tried the mod that you get from Rose‚Äôs quest?
---
Survival: I expect violence and am on edge; it will feel more honest
---
Adventure: I expect PVP if I take a workshop. Also, I expect dill-weeds to try to trick me into a not-actual-PVP-and-instead-a-trap
---
Same, crashes everyone I try to enter lab lab. I can join event, fats travel or walk from my camp (@ morgantown train station) and I get dashboarded every time!
---
They won't be able to replace it if that's what you put a ticket in for unfortunately - for any items that disappear you get a "We're sorry this happened, can't replace missing items, will forward feed back to dev team" kind of message - it's frustrating but that's all you'll get. I lost power armor. at least it wasn't a legendary weapon like a lot of people have lost.
---
play the game without one shorting everything with a bloodied TSE shotgun..? üòÇü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Server crashes.. and you loose it all..
---
that's been my problem. I still see a server crash about once a day.. sometimes I get 2 days between seeing one..
---
I thought you meant player I was confused
---
Yeah, the bloodied w/ adrenaline is rough (and Adrenal reaction). I can drop nuke mines at my feet if I‚Äôm at 100%. Once I kill a few guys, I have to watch out.
---
Teacher approves, have a gold star and a sweet ;)
---
Yes and now I think about it - the casual outfit as well because it has a aqua shirt!
---
PVP solo was always a bad idea, IMO
---
I don‚Äôt watch anything like that, I feel people are losing the ability to think for themselves and far too frequently rely on YouTuber videos and just regurgitate what they‚Äôve heard. 
---
It‚Äôs nothing personal against him, I just think it‚Äôs self serving nonsense. 
---
Just my opinion of course, I appreciate many people feel differently.
---
You mean atoms? Just wait until they come up with another hoop that we have to jump through. Remember brewing challenges?
---
The syringers are one of the most underrated but very fun weapons to use! My favorite is the bloatfly one! I love trolling other players in whitesprings. Shooting the ghouls with the syringer and a bloatfly appears after the ghould is killed and then shooting the same bloatfly to produce another bloatfly and another to where the player just runs off because it's never ending! XD You can literally farm bloatfly glands forever! The radscorpion one is one of the hardest to farm but i found that you can get quite a bit of radscorpion glands in west tek. I use the Endangerol syringer on the Queen! It helps sooo much especially when it lands!
---
L8CHRISTIANL8
---
It would. However, before they tackle stuff like that, I‚Äôd rather they hugely expand the number of settlement building pieces available. At this point, it‚Äôs starting to damage the longevity of the game. I know some people will say ‚Äòwhy not both?‚Äô but let‚Äôs be honest here, the devs are a skeleton crew. It‚Äôs not going to be both. 
---
Cool idea for the future, though.
---
I still LOL when the Swamp Gas -charisma status pops up.
---
You need to make sure whatever you are taking a picture of shows up in the top right hand corner with the name - although it's hard to tell if you didn't get the camera to recognize what was in the picture of if it's a bug &gt;&lt; never know these days
---
You still didn't say why.
---
Not before they add in an option to opt out of server-wide alerts. This event pops every half hour, we don't need that nag.
---
Thanks, what a relief.
---
And most PVP in adventure *ISNT*. It may masquerade as PVP, but really it‚Äôs a trap/lure only.
---
 My spear is named Doug. He has been Doug since the day we met five months ago. We are best of friends and tell each other everything.
---
I can sleep at last.
---
I'm not sure I'll have much time tonight but I'm interested, I tried this 4 times yesterday and they all failed because no one understood what they were doing.
---
Lvl 282, have mic
---
Lol, sleep well bud.
---
I hate acronyms, even asking 'the google' gives too many options. Thanks!
---
No you are not the only one, and it is beyond frustrating.
---
BE Is generally Bloodied Explosive | VE Is Vampire's Explosive | AA is anti armor - normally prefixes of legendary items!
---
He edited it lol
---
I've encountered the invisible enemies. Died like 3 times from it and just turned the game off. I wish they would test these things before making it live.
---
Is your generator in a room by itself?  
---
I keep mine in its own room, with no doors. If I ever need to access it, I just go in to edit, swap wall to door and walk through. It shuts the wall behind me so no one else can come in. Then I do the same to exit.
---
The fire department in charleston has a gym with plenty of dumbbells. Im not sure of the entire amount of lead, but the 160 pound weight yielded 46 lead.
---
I mean, how many hours a day are you playing this game, exactly? 
---
Personally when I'm maxed out on inventory space, it's not because I'm "saving good stuff" it's because "I'm storing way to much crap I don't need". Look at your junk and tell me you need, say, 200 ceramic scrap. 400 circuit boards. Whatever it is. 
---
If you have junk you don't use to repair your gear, or make ammo, toss it. How much spoiled food do you have? 
---
And if you legitimately have a stash full of junk legendary items...that stuff isn't valuable. A small buffer for days you don't play as much for the chipper, and vendor the rest of that trash. Or drop it in a bag like we used to do. 
---
I haven't worried about getting max caps since the first time I hit 25k. What am I gonna do, buy one more recipe I won't actually use? Hope someone has a better bit of armor in their camp store?
---
Defending workshops was part of my daily gameplay. I don't really bother anymore. Which makes me sad. :(
---
Agreed about trying to do the event with high level players on the server that either don't want to participate, or haven't seen it pop up on the map.  It's very very difficult to do solo or with a small group.  It's impossible for one player to feed the creature up to rank 3, and rank 1 creatures can be a squishy as Dmitri the lvl 1 Radroach.  0% chance of success.  SMH
---
I wasn't saying we had 100% chance of 3* items, but rather the enemies. It is always a chance to not get a maxed item, but I understand that, and to me this has never been a problem. It makes gear that is good actually worth something, and with the purveyor, there are no longer ANY useless legendaries.
---
Yeah, I was thinking about this a while ago. The idea of players having too many items on them causes server instability doesn't make sense (at least for items that stack). Otherwise, carrying around 20K rounds of ammo would be detrimental. Having 1 or 100,000 of somethings makes no real difference.
---
Having too many individual items, however, can be a performance hit depending on the size of the data for those items. Adding 200 more stash space shouldn't be that problematic because of that. Most of what players would be storing would be junk items for crafting, or a handful of weapons/legendaries. 
---
It'd make more sense then to change how stash boxes work. Only allow junk to have weight inside a stash box, and change it so stashed weapons and armor are weightless. Instead, assign slots to the storage, so players can store, say, up to 25 weapons and armor. This way players can store as weapons/armor in the box, but since weight doesn't directly impact performance, just quantity of individual items, you set a natural control to allow a safe limit.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm level 102 so unless all I do every time I play is just do the events, it doesn‚Äôt really leave much for me to do as the majority of them especially the scout challenges you need the camera.
---
If you want to spend 15 minutes minimum and a nuclear keycard to nuke someone who can just leave the server and find a new one... I'd say you're hurting yourself more than the other person. Ever hear the saying "cutting off your nose to spite your face"? That's you bud. But hey, you do you.
---
Luck of the draw?  Ive only been disconnected a handful of times since launch. I also only play for 1-2 hours a shot and at night so maybe it's timing.
---
are you getting the killing blow with it? i thought i read in a different thread you need the syringe to be the killing hit
---
I've done it - found bloatflies as rare ncounted on the road near rusty pick, then rusty pick spawned super mutants and hound was inside! Thx for help everyone :)
---
Maybe just lucky lol, not saying the 3* items have been anything god tier or even useable. :)
---
These posts are repetitive and annoying, change my mind.
---
I'm on PC.  Never had an issue loading in to the event or going down the elevator.
---
Yup, it's great :D Been using it for about a week now xD
---
Ah.  That makes sense.
---
If there's one thing i support in this game without hesitation - it's more stash limit
---
Pfftt, free fertilizer, yo! Make lemonade from those lemons.
---
I love those, it‚Äôs fun leaving them a bag with a propaganda flyer. Also, if the ground floor is locked, often the roof or balcony doors are unlocked, so I use my jet pack and again leave them a propaganda  flyer.  
---
It‚Äôs amazing the lengths I go to just to keep myself occupied.
---
What if.... it has something to do with having both games on my external drive? Fallout has been this way since day one - both were digital downloads, but RD2 was very solid until this recent update, now effectively unplayable online. If i delete then reinstall, will my ps4 retain saved game data like a PC would?
---
I like seeing the super rare TSE perception lever for 20k myself.
---
Anti Armor find one with 25% faster fire rate and mod with speedy receiver you will chew enemies up.
---
I know that you were asking about different Gatling guns but in my opinion both mentioned guns are garbage.
---
Nobody plays like thats not an option I might as well play by myself too lol
---
Dense torso mod basically eliminates major damage from explosions.  If you're a power armor guy, T-51b does a pretty fine job of protecting you.
---
SAME MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY!
---
Is it a plan?
---
This. And really the only reason 2 stars don't sell well is because 3 stars were / continue to be mass duped and there are 10s of thousands of them in the economy.
---
I actually bought something from a guys vending machine. Went down the hill and he comes up behind me swinging away. I ignored it for the most part but he kept at it and was already at half health. Two swipes and he drops and the next thing I know a guy unlocks and uses a TSE on me. Not mad because I've read enough that if you ever want to consider pvp you need to drop off your junk. The caps do bother me though.
---
Codes not cards
---
I'm not crazy. Your crazy. Dont tell me how to run my store
---
Yah because people in adventure mode were sick of that crap
---
Encryptid does give you a notification.
---
No it just learned automatically
---
Sad I'm on Xbox on mo fos can't fill any of them but venison and we keep failing
---
Huh o.o?
---
How is this not top reply.
---
It‚Äôs the killing blow with the syringer. A melee hit with it works best. And you definitely can use a different weapon first to get their health low, then whip them to death with the syringer
---
I have one as well, probably one of the highest DPS weapons in my inventory but it's just so damn hard to keep up with ammo. It's a shame because it's a really fun gun to use. 
---
 They really need to let us do .308 in bulk like 5mm and .50 bmg now that the .50 receiver is the strongest for the hunting rifle.
---
It sucks that it's just luck to get it I have horrible luck
---
My Tse Single Action Revolver is lovingly named The Bigger Iron
---
My IE Dragon is called The Showstopper
---
My Explosive Black Powder Rifle is called The Gut Puncher
---
It's probably a joke. The day player vending launched I put on in my machine and priced it at 9,999 caps for shits and giggles. It sold almost immediately, so I put another one in there at 19,999.
---
Those reports are not read by anyone or anything, and zero people will ever even get a warning for completely normal gameplay.
---
Pretending you're owed something, in a video game of all places, is pathetic.  People with your mindset are the cancer of video games.
---
Ah. I'm on ps4. Played it around 12am est and didn't have any problems. Don't know of I was just lucky then or what.
---
Someone's been in the wasteland a little too long....
---
Pacifist is the word that should have been used.
---
That's what's nice about the tesla. It arcs and deals all that damage youre outputting to everyone who's close enough. Had a similar situation happen at the legendary vendor with 2 low levels trying to bait. Ended up wasting the 2 low lvls with 2 shots or so and the other guy went down in a clip or 2
---
I normally don't get frustrated, but this is so true.  I'm on area chat saying "hey guys, let's focus on protecting this one mirelurk I managed to rank up to lvl 1 without your help.  It has the best chance at surviving."
---
And everyone ignores me, then gives confused emotes when the quest fails.
---
um it doesnt matter if someone oneshots the deer. their loot is group loot. if i kill it someone else can loot the venison. so yeah.
---
You play them and you get something team based like ‚ÄúFamily friendly‚Äù increased AP regeneration and 5% exp bonus but the exp is a shorter duration than the AP regen. The catch is you have to play the full game, possibly parts are missing so you have to track down multiples of the same board game. Possibly plans to make the game would be cool.
---
I take it as not for sale. Also sometimes people think they‚Äôre being funny. How dare they!?
---
Awesome Idea! I  found out the hard way last night. I walked into Arktos Pharma not knowing what to expect, there was no one else there, it took me a while to figure out where to go.  I  found the elevator, which was gliched out to begin with, found the terminal, saved the Tick named Dennis, or something like that. That is  when I  barely beat the legendary Sheepsqauch that was  apparently the Alfa creature. I am not sure if it changes to different creatures each time the event starts. But nonetheless I am thankful that I ate Scorched Beast Meat and had 40 stympaks to spare. I literally got my ass handed to me. Lol. I  honestly wish I had more help from other players, I just beat it, by the hair on my chinty chin, chin, Bahha! Lol.
---
And not to mention the drop was not really worth my time. I  also noticed that after returning for a second round, I kept getting booted off the server, not sure if any one else had that issue?
---
Hell I can‚Äôt even play the game due to real life situations I‚Äôm in right now! But I hope you are able to or something. Maybe someone will sell a plan for real cheap on here or a vending machine you go to
---
Are you referring to Juicehead regurgitating what's he's heard or just people in general?
---
Name same as GT?
---
Just make it infinite ffs
---
I always enjoy a bloody good laugh at these.
---
I had one where it spawned in a single room with two locked doors and a staircase to another locked door and I was like :/ 
---
But I might start carrying some salt around with me lol
---
Why does someone else have to change what they're doing?  Why are you blaming players for playing the game?  Zero rules are being broken here.  Go tell the developers to balance their fucking broken combat.  Asking players to gimp themselves is not only something that will never, ever work, it's wrong, stupid, and childish.
---
I, and everyone else that does this, will continue to play the game however we want within the rules.  Don't like it?  Too bad.
---
Yah I got a normal one and was playing around with it but then I got the two shot version and I was like it‚Äôs meant to be on my arsenal I was happy
---
I just use the explosion resist mod on the combat armor chest piece. Same effect with less perk usage.
---
It‚Äôs a meme comrade
---
I started playing fallout 4 again on the side and the infinite storage space makes me feel like a fat kid in a blamco mac n cheese factory
---
yep. it doesnt work
---
My vendor sells toilet paper rolls for 100 caps. It's next to the porta potty :-)
---
That really sucks I'm sorry hopefully you can play again soon and I hope when you get to that you get it first try
---
Yes it‚Äôs definitely a good thing to have a guaranteed three star boss especially at max level (not sure about One Violent Night though). WS always has one or two 3*** ghouls around but more than often they are level 40. Mama purveyor hates me though. I‚Äôve whacked so many of her relatives I probably deserve it.
---
I'm sorry I can't answer the latter question but as for the hard drives, I have people with solid state drives on my discord and they have disconnects the same as anyone else. And their drives are not external. High end system, low end, console, it doesn't matter. The game is a mess basically and we spend a lot of time figuring out work-arounds
---
Sent an invite.
---
Could you nuke my C.A.M.P I like the blown out look
---
The guy venting onto juicehead seems rather slow or maybe intoxicated he's making bold assumptions I myself haven't experienced watching a couple of juicehead videos .. juicehead was objective in the couple I've been sent to see and yeah he has inserted his opinion but it seemed to stem from experience and he used a lot of common sense.
---
I think people just need to chill out and realize BGS made some poor decisions as a company and a lot of people felt mislead and rightfully got angry. Yeah fallout/elder scrolls were good single player games in the past .. but we've had online gaming communities now for over 20 years and there is plenty of online material to sift through for how online gaming have failed in the past and what systems players flock to ... so as big as they are they should have had some foresight into the decisions they made people absolutely would be venting their anger in large quantities.
---
Arktos though thus far is a dissapointment to my friends and myself same with the burrows, the burrows even more .. it feels as though they are still in the single player mindset .. the new areas should have been made into instanced areas like regular mmo instanced dungeons are .. my buddies and I ran through this new area in less than 10 minutes ... we did the event a few times and just weren't impressed .. it's the same type of sit.kill.wait event then kill a bullet sponge with no mechanics .. for a DLC for a single player RPG game I would be OK with it as it's a nice looking area and the story is eerie .. but as a multiplayer suvival game it offers very little.
---
The only thing the burrows has going for it is that is has a bunch of creatures to kill near the entrace so you can sort of add it to your list of farm spots while looking for xp but other than that, you still have to load in when you don't really need to there is very little replay value to a survival game with these areas.
---
When they first annouced these upcoming updates they made it sound like they were gonna be instanced dungeons and I got all hyped because I'm used to online multiplayer games and then assumed the vaults were gonna be raids but nope that would also come with a server player cap increase and party cap increase ... but NOPE! ofc not .. just new areas to load into with no farming potential other than some event that's more tedious than the other ones that pop on the map and are as just unecessary...
---
Well it's worth the risk to me.
---
Pics, sir! Please!
---
Maybe. I was selling blank holotapes for 10 caps for a little bit there, but felt guilty and removed them.
---
Nice. I've been trying to get one of those all day.
---
They won't tell us, so probably a dupe glitch of some kind
---
I've tamed 3 possums, and a dog. They've all died very shortly after someone fast traveled to my CAMP.
---
Encryptid has a server wide notification. That's the main reason why I know it's going on.
---
lol as long as there‚Äôs stars, there‚Äôs hope
---
thank you
---
LOL.  I went to a guy's camp today and all the resources were outside the house.  Inside the house were rows of pews with a table acting as an altar with a stuffed sheepsquatch and several candles around it.  I felt uncomfortable and simultaneously amused.
---
Good to know, I stand corrected! 
---
I had originally assumed that was the case, but I think I got the wrong end of the stick reading this topic and I began to doubt myself. I'd never really considered where our characters are stored, it hasn't been important to me as of yet!
---
See, THAT'S a joke!
---
Yeah wish they would fix this, been wishing for months and thousands of plastic later. Feel like an idiot every time I get burned by it, then I get pissed at Bethesda, lol. Not auto-scrapping bug parts (like bloatfly gland) may be good idea as well.
---
I'm wondering if it has something to do with how the events are activated. Encryptid and the nukes are player activated possibly making the coding for activating a server wide event possible. I wonder if they changed up arktos to be activated at a computer instead of itd be easier to give us a notification.
---
Yea I have a snallygaster spit explosion item that glitched into my inventory I have it on sale for 20k not because I expect anyone to buy it just for lols
---
I do have only 1 crappy one :/
---
I moved back to my old crappy bunker.
---
But as soon as I get home I'll post it here :)
---
Considering my AK weighs as much as a Gatling gun, yes please.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. If I can get one that would be amazing, ill give you some caps for one.
---
I'd help you I'm on ps4 tho
---
This, as someone who grew up in the upper midwest where there are more squirrels then rats and roaches combined...
---
It's registered every time, which is why I'm especially confused. [Here's an imgur album with the camera interface, photo taken, and my challenge still registering as 0/10](https://imgur.com/a/2O1wxcP)
---
I've reloaded the game, restarted my PS4.. Guess I'll just try again later to see if it it's going to work
---
Oh im on pc. Thanks for the offer tho. :)
---
I‚Äôm really sorry man. I wish I had a solution
---
I got this off my first (technically second but the server crashed and rolled me back after the first one LOL) event, then when I came in for the next one, everybody was complimenting it. It's a shame it doesn't come as a plan though, being able to somehow share this with others would be great
---
I still haven't even found a camera. I know I could look up the known locations and grind to find one but i've been trying to get one just naturally by playing the game.... but i'm getting annoyed with all the photo challenges but not finding the camera ya.
---
Perfect Timing for the next Nukaholics meeting
---
This NEEDS to happen simply because of player vending.
---
It's suspected because players were setting up camps near Vault 76 or the Overseer's camp.   They were filling the punch bowls with Nukashine for unsuspecting noobs to drink.
---
Any good build does massive damage and breaks the game completely.  Simple vats crit builds.  Buffed melee's (no legendary affixes) using chems.  Anyone stacking chems even if their build otherwise sucks.
---
The game is flooded with idiots that think things like adamantium skeleton, the most useless perk in the game, and power armor are mandatory.
---
Use chems.  Use vats.  Aim for the head.  Don't use shitty, stupid weapons.  Nothing in this game is difficult to find or utilize regularly and god roll legendary weapons aren't even noticeable in good builds unless you're fighting these bosses, which kills them maybe two seconds faster in a good group.
---
Oh shit.  That's cool.
---
What made Bethesda decide Aluminum and screws are the most valuable resource for building.
---
My bloodied plasma rifle is named green goober
---
I also got this skin with only one remaining. It might be considered a lower tier drop
---
I haven't tried that, but the quest says "shoot". Should say "kill" instead if that is the case.
---
Can't believe they haven't fixed this. I stopped bulking aluminum and lead because of this. Now I only bulk when I'm near a stash box.
---
Correct, that's why the game has not been sold for full price since the week after it came out.
---
There's an arktos lab coat that you can get, I managed to get both the backpack and lab coat. They look really well together, the coat is white with green lining
---
Just let us transfer stuff to alt characters easily. Then we can just make a bank alt and more than double our capacity. Add in a mailbox or something that we can use to transfer stuff to another character of ours. Then they can hold onto everything we don't immediately need, like nice weapons we're not using or crafting materials we don't need. It's not like we can't do this already. But it requires a trustworthy 2nd player.
---
 Yes those griefers dont have balls for the Survival server so they come in adventure with a friend bait to one shot you when you engage, saw a lot recently, all i do is aim on the "bait" friend and see if the option for team up is showing, if not showing he is on a team and propbably his friends are hiding somewhere waiting to you to engage.
---
Same experience here. Now that CAMPs are safe I just leave it on 24/7.
---
Get a new script then cause this one clearly doesn't work.
---
Meh, I only get top replies with low effort posts like 'lol' or 'finally!'.  It's like the less effort you put in, the more upvotes you get ;-)
---
THEN PIN THAT FUCKING SENTENCE TO THE TOP PAGE YOU COWARD.
---
I'm not sure if they're tradable or not. I know the repaired camera isn't, and is destroyed if dropped. I'll see if I can wrestle the TV away from the kids. Are you on now?
---
And - It just works.
---
Try to fast travel to a close location like Greg‚Äôs mine supply and then walk to Arktos- this stopped the crashing in the elevator for me. I hope it works for you.
---
Wood armor is the lightest armor in the game, tho any armor with the weightless effect can be truly weightless with the lighter mod.
---
do you need both Wasteland Whisperer and Animal Friend maxed? or can one be maxed and one be a lvl 1 variant?
---
It‚Äôs a tedious one to do alone. Try to have at least one party member to make it quicker
---
All I know is, if having to re-download "EnlightenExteriors" 01 and 02 doesn't fix the seemingly-inverted terrain brightness vs time of day, issue... I'll be ***most*** unhappy... :P It boggles the mind why they didn't just use the ESO engine, that is, unless it lacks the necessary physics/ragdoll features a FO game needs. Of course, that's a rant for another thread! lol
---
 I did finally manage to get the launcher to recognize the folder and not want to try downloading the entire game! Seems that it was the fact the folder I was copying over already had the "__downloads" directory and that was screwing up the initial recognition of the game as it was ignoring the Fallout76 directory's contents, instead looking solely in that downloads folder. Removing it and then starting the Launcher up again initialized the analyzing (hash checks I presume) of the game files to determine what more had to be downloaded. Which for whatever reason it refuses to "patch" some files as it does, and wants to re-download them entirely, causing the update to grow by another GB. Which I guess is no biggie given I'm not downloading it at home *anyways*, but it'll take a bit longer to get, so I'll be seeing if I can once more trick it into using the "only" 8.5GB download.
---
\*le sigh\*
---
Def been happening for a while. Not a big fan of it. :/
---
This has been this way since the start of the game my friend.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried the event yet but I‚Äôve been seeing posts that say to fast travel to somewhere nearby and walk to Arktos.
---
Not a bug. Intended to remove caps from the economy.
---
Yeah, i know that seem dumb but it's my guilty pleasure üòÑ 
---
I don't do that frequently, only when i see an very very overpriced store, i know the price of the market so when i see a guns with his market price, well, that not chocking me, it's situational, like when i see a mule who overprice 1* weapons while we know very well that he already has a shovel of caps and weapons. What is the point? I see just a little too much greed, so I turn into a vigilante. Yes again it's silly, but eh! each one his way of taking pleasure in playing üòú
---
Bad the opposite experience last month. I've ran the silo a few times and still have no idea how they work, but a kid with an absolute garbage build but an in depth knowledge of the nuke system asked me to help him run alpha. 
---
He kept asking about what gun I was using because of how easily it handled assaultrons (TS .50 with all the heavy weapons and AA perks) and he guided me through the silo. Good times, some kids aren't terrible to play with.
---
Do you happen to have a paint skin on your camera?  I have noticed that when I use mine with the white crocodile skin it doesn't register some things. I started carrying around a basic with the 105 lens and can get things to complete.
---
So is 2.000 ;)
---
Sadness
---
Vendors only replenish 25% of the value of what you buy. Has been the case since launch.
---
What would be nice is if my pip boy data would reflect all the events I completed correctly.  Only shows tea time and powering up for me.  On PS4.
---
Well poop... guess I got lucky the first few weeks.
---
This happens way too often. As well as lvl 40 Creatures spawning in with hordes of lvl 60+ enemies. I've seen the event instant fail 6 times within first minute after "Greeting Friendlies."
---
best way to deal with preston and his quests let him give them to you. go knock them out, then never turn them in to the townsfolk or preston (dont get the reward) as long as the quests outstanding he wont issues new ones or talk that much.. so much quieter.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an energy weapon. It fires a projectile making it ballistic? I think?
---
This is the BEST!
---
We got:
---
Vending - wich is Stash Dependent
---
Display Cases -  aswell
---
New Items to Collect with each update (Sheepsquatch, Imposter, Arktos,P-Scouts)
---
and with the Legedary Vendor, people will hoard more legendarys than ever before (for selling or for turning into script)
---
So yes.
---
I guess even 150 - will be a start. 200 should be a good middle ground and 250 would be awesome!
---
Lets praise.
---
No you don‚Äôt unscrew them, you just completely destroy the entire thing to the point where everything is dust, and then you get the screw.
---
I got really lucky and managed to revive a low lvl while doing the heart of the swamp event, which means that I completed the 'revive a player while in water' challenge.
---
My Rapid Furious Gatling gun is named Wreckoning and his brother the Instigating Vats enhanced is Blat-Blat. My Assassins Exploding Wieghtless .50cal Prime Machine gun is Warsong Prime.
---
For the most part, he's objective about what he talks about. He adds a few of his opinions here and there, and always says it's his opinion. But mostly he just keeps us up on what's going on, speculates about possible future content, or repeats speculation that the community is currently having. The times when hes been wrong he almost always updates the video and apologises in a later one.
---
Me either - I get why, but lord is it annoying.
---
It was a comment on the direction of society in general, it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to comment on juicehead specifically as I‚Äôve never seen anything they‚Äôve done.  
---
My point is that people seem to be losing the ability to think for themselves and in doing so, elevate people on social media to faux celebrity status.
---
Yes, you're the only one.  There have TOTALLY not been 100 different threads about this since yesterday.  Just you, my man.
---
Same.  Probably just a way to show off that they got one but if someone wants to drop 20k on it, they probably won't complain either
---
I‚Äôve actually waisted a ton of caps doing this. Although I wouldn‚Äôt call them stupid, they may of forgot or something, it is pretty dumb.
---
It‚Äôs always been this way I‚Äôm afraid
---
Noted! I appreciate the percentage ‚úå
---
That‚Äôs a different challenge. Unless you know something I don‚Äôt?
---
Is it worth now? Asking for a friend...
---
Yeah, a final stash increase to 1000, and over. Hope they do it someday!
---
How much were you spending the first few times? Vendor typically gets back about 1/4 of the caps you spend on it. 
---
So if you bought something at 5k or more, vendor would be back at 1400 cap capacity and not realize the cap sink.
---
Stealth boys should act like the nightkin; shooting while under its effects will decloak you
---
First few months, Vendors only had 200 caps max.
---
Probably why it was harder to notice, 1000 caps would have refilled the vendors cap pool.
---
Found this Outfit actually, not bad looking.
---
You play on PC?  I would love nothing more than to assist with the event with people that can actually read and follow basic instructions.
---
As a mutant, I support this.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on now. :)
---
You charge for shitroll?
---
You Monster!
---
Plaugewalker does AOE tick damage scaling off how much diseases you have think it's limited to around 5??, both the other two can proc if you are using a workbench and get attacked by Mole Rats.
---
If you are never diseased it's worth trying out depending on how many low level rats you run into while you have your build menu open.
---
Beets, beer and Battlestar Galactica.
---
Had the same problem. Once my buddy (using the marsupial mutation) hopped on it's head it worked.
---
Unfortunately I never have more than 7k caps, so try to keep purchases around the 1k mark. Guess I was bugged without realizing it üò£
---
No paint. I don't really like the skins for weapons or cameras so I haven't invested in them. The only thing I've ever modded it with is the 105mm lens
---
Ohh good Idea, I did get the revive ally there for the main quest. did not think about that one
---
I feel like if they separated the stashes into categories it would work well. Say Armor has a specific stash box you can place in your C.A.M.P. and that box has 800 weight for only armor. Same for weapons (which would fill quicker but still) and so on. 800 is fine but not for everything. They have to find a way to make it possible to collect again.
---
As someone who's watched a fair few of his videos, and disagrees with some of his views on some things... I don't get you lot. 
---
He's said more positive shit about this game than not, over all, and if anything, I'm still a bit irked at how much he OVER SOLD this game before launch. 
---
Every time he comes up here it's "He's saying mean things about fallout" because there's a bug, or a ban wave, or some shit. He's putting the information out there as he knows it. "he skims most of his information from reddit" I mean no shit? So does just about everyone else. Everyone gets their information from other people. That's, legitimately, how knowledge transfer works.
---
Honestly i think y‚Äôall should stop complaining about mutations before they nerf them as well and just join the rest of the players that have them. Being a low level with none of them makes the game extremely hard. If you don‚Äôt like them just keep creating new players and walk everywhere and delete it and start again when you reach lvl 40. It‚Äôs like complaining about not having explosive energy weapons. They all ready don‚Äôt drop anymore but as of recently every player in pvp has them. Same thing with all the nerfs that have happened. I miss having my insane dps tse Gatling gun leveling and farming was easy and enjoyable.
---
Nope. Played at Bivs, played snare drums... didn't register
---
... thankyou. Good to know at least. Like the guy suffering chemo when the doctor finally just says, "dude... tests came back. you dead already, give it up. You got two months tops. Fresh coffee in the waiting room btw"
---
The brotherhood didn't because racist to mutations yet that comes a couple years into the future after the Masters army everyone is afraid of any mutation and then they because racist.
---
I saw a toilet roll being sold for 25k in a machine last night lmao, love finding things like that üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Read this post in Eric Cartman's voice.
---
I feel you. But I have to say that a huge part of this is maturity. I've been playing online games, notably MMOs and sure you get the whiney kids (and teenagers) who have no right playing the game. You also get some highly mature teenagers who I've had some of the best online gaming experiences with.
---
It's down to the individualand I've played with "adults" who are worse than 10 year olds, no exaggeration. I do agree with you though.
---
Probably what the other guy said. Few months back vendors had 200 cap pool, they only recently merged them all to a combined 1400 cap pool. So if you always spent around 800+, it would refill the 200 caps for the day.
---
Adventure except people actually use mics?

no such thing as legacy weapons, they will be returning once they are adjusted. the removal is **TEMPORARY**
---
as for the gauss though, I believe it still drops with the explosive effect. Haven't found one myself but they're relatively common in player trading
---
War. War never changes.
---
Nice. Mine's the one with the picture of the moose on every flat surface possible.
---
Some mods are so heavy that they make weapons with the reduced weight effect appear like a normal weapon without mods. They can sometimes even make reduced weight weapons weigh more than a normal weapon without mods.
---
If you turn up at my shop, and it's on the map, but locked tight, I'm either restocking on Survival, or got a troll trapped on Adventure.
---
Other than those 2 situations, I'm always open.

Named my harpoon "defiantbranch" because dude was sad to sell it so I told him I'd name it after him.

I got a quad explosive pipe revolver

Please look into camp building and placement..I don‚Äôt know what the most recent patch did but I literally cannot build anywhere without ‚Äúattached item is floating‚Äù or ‚Äúobject intersects with another object‚Äù and Its just me trying to place stairs that actually touch the ground.. this is making me not want to play this game anymore it feels like you‚Äôre just taking camp creativity out for no apparent reason

**Buy 500 atoms - (10 Atoms)**
---
I guess my fault was not starting my own thread about this as I and others have been putting forward this idea in response to the multiple threads on flares, etc. over the last 2+ weeks.
---
Glad to see that the idea has finally been noticed on Reddit. I somehow think someone at Bethesda was already thinking about this by introducing the personal terminal in our CAMPs. The interface is right there and allows you to work around any limitations the PipBoy interface has given the dev team.
---
Looking forward to the next iteration of the terminal.
---
Darn I was hoping they fixed it... Musician is one of the easier possum badges
---

---
I was bulking to sell in lots to a vendor.  Id rather sell it than throw it away...
---
Agree 100%, that would be a quick and easy fix to the entire explosive weapon line (Missile Launcher, Fatman, Broadsider, etc)
---
I got it too!
---
I would love to have the radius extend by 50% and the budget to not alter when I relocate. Increase of budget sounds really good especially if we are going to add decoration for our camps soon.
---
Let me guess, you're on console, right? There will always be children on consoles. There are children on PC too, but they are rare compared to consoles.
---
Im thinking junkies is now a viable build for those not running bloody. Not equal too by any means but an alternative but its unknown and a garbage prefix to most because alot of people dont naturally use chems, its difficult to become addicted, the addiction system was broken for 5 months and theres penalties to addictions, stat wise and very little info/discussion on it. So there are people looking but its a small base.
---
This is very needed, as people still can't figure out how to do it.
---
Last attempt had more than 10 players, many level 200+, but only me (lvl 70) and a mate filled the trough.
---
As I knew high level means nothing, most of those are still casual noobs that simply abused xp glitches or ran whitesprings 24/7. Veeery sad xD
---
"Don't you have phones?"
---
So that's why the Tadpole bug hunt  took four hours of everything rotting before I could turn it in.
---
I got it with two animals alive.
---
Nice assumptions.
---
I want a dog. 
---
Got it.
---
I was unaware of this one, great info, I'll try to replicate and post the results.
---
Isn‚Äôt that just energy weapons? I believed the gauss is ballistic
---
I usually have at least one piece of poisoner's on me. It's really damn nice against mirelurk queens, the difference between 0 resist and 25 resist is significant
---
This honestly sounds a lot like playing with my 40yo friend.
---
It's not your job to babysit anyone or watch your language around children in a game that's rated Mature.  If some deadbeat parent is fine with their tween kid playing 76, that's their concern not yours.  You might feel like you "should" adjust your behavior, but you are in no way forced to.
---
They basically dropped their kid off in the middle of the 1970's Bronx to play alone.  If they didn't expect their child to come home with no money, no shoes and a colorful new vocabulary, they're complete fools.
---
Yea, and you still atleast benefit from less weight of the base weapon if im not mistaken, even if it isnt a lot
---
i bought the plan from the watoga vendor, i didnt have much luck ever finding the berkley free one, it took me making and scraping 49 lvl 15 handmades to get all the modifications i wanted access to: hardened, aligned barrel, aligned stock, armor piercing mag, suppressor. suppressor was the last one i learned.
---
There‚Äôs sort of an arena behind Top of the World
---
It's always been good. The game had plenty of bugs at the beginning, but none of them made the game "literally unplayable" to the extent reviewers made it seem. The game.is great now. I just got back in after taking a month off and there's more content than I'm able to get through.
---
Lmao I'm sure that's how it went. You won't really be doing shit though because I haven't touched adventure since survival came out. I'm honestly not seeing how you're still replying if you aren't interested in an idea. Sure you never down voted me, but you're the only one replying. You sure got some stick up your ass about people doing something different than you. Nobody wants you here and I'm sure your friends list is empty as fuck. Later my guy.
---
They need to make it so when I'm server hoping it doesn't place me in the same world 3 times in a row
---
Player Vs Player(S)
---
Johnny, 7, running full assasins  build with a shiny TSE shotgun.
---
Are there multiple scout challenges where you go after a yao guai, wolf, and radstag with a syringer? I‚Äôve only ever done one such challenge and melee hits with the syringer worked fine for that one
---
That‚Äôs how I completed it
---
I'll only group with players that have mic's and are obviously old enough. No kids, ever. SorryNotSorry...
---
It's not just legendary enemies,  I have seen it happen to  level 1 ghouls and Scorched too. 
---
For me it's not consistent though. Some nights I won't see it happen at all, other nights it seems like it happens to almost every enemy I encounter.  No clue why.
---
Usually they die offscreen and I just hear the death sounds and encounter the corpse when I round a corner.  I have seen mobs just drop dead in front of me a few times though.
---
Again, are you okay? Lmao
---
Old old old old bug that should be easy to fix (one missing keyword..)
---
My only complaint with this argument is that heavy/sturdy armor still weighs 100% more instead of 10% more. I assume the game treats it as a hidden "mod" on the armor, and this "mod" is also unaffected by the legendary effect. It's fine the way it is though, a handmade rifle weighing 12 is still much better than 20. And people are forgetting that this works both ways; you can mod weightless armor to be ultra-light and, in most cases, make it weigh 0, quite literally weightless.
---
Nope you got the same issue.
---
The message was to the OP and me describing his experience.
---
Yes the world has to finish populating before you can fast travel. To me from a programming standpoint. You should not be let out of the loading screen till the world is populated, but since your standing there already if you still are seeing the loading screen (waiting for the world to populate) you can get killed by mobs. So it's an apple/oranges thing. Do they program it to leave to load screen up with a possibility of your death, or do they do as they do now and you are with reduced functionality till the world fully populates
---
Disagree, many **WANT** 3* wood armor, they just need to add the missing keywords, just like the Plasma Gun (only had one legendary AP for 2+ months)
---
No prob. üòä
---
The pies are almost always absurd or joke prices. I have mine for sale at 9,999c because either it doesn't sell and I get to keep it, or someone buys it and I make a stupid amount of caps off of one item xD
---
It worked! I just named it camera and made sure it wasn‚Äôt favorited. Thank you so much
---
Yes Please!
---
I'm confident that there is a cap for running and sprinting speeds. The mutation also doesn't stack with any walking and sprinting perks or even with the power armor mod.
---
Yeah, I'm slowly learning. üòÜ What about BBW? My drunk buddy says I should try one out...Waka waka!
---
There's 2. Kill X creature and then also a different challenge which just says shoot X creature
---
*Floor D√©cor:* Cat and Deathclaw Topiaries can no longer be built if they have not yet been unlocked in the Atomic Shop.
---
Well...
---
*Sometimes when you unload 500+ 5mm into a lv 100 legendary beast you don't get any loot...
---
On the bright side when I realised this was the case, I got some free perk cards to redistribute.
---
That's nothing new. People have been listening to and following those they look up to since the beginning of time. It just seems more prevalent since the invention of the internet because we can communicate with more people across the globe than we could before. It's not necessarily a bad thing if it leads to more positive change and/or results.
---
just play the camp adams event and get the medals. much easier
---
Good idea.
---
There you always have the notification that you found the sons of Dane radiosignal
---
Damn. I am very anti-Juicehead and I've had a couple of arguments with him on Reddit. Mostly civil discussions, though. This gut on the other hand...well, he raises some good points but he was probably a bit, um, inebriated.
---
LOL Big beautiful woman for ya!
---
What they need to do, is simply have our equipped perk cards also apply to the stash.  Then, if removing it would push us over the limit, don‚Äôt let us remove it.  
---
This feels simple to me
---
They‚Äôre common bc they‚Äôre duped so much and they use energy ammo but do ballistic dmg so idk if it‚Äôs legacy or not
---
kids can play games too. its not like fallout 76 is inappropriate for kids (imo).
---
I think people in survival keep everything stored and pull benches out on when they need it. I know they do that with decon showers anyways. Kind of smart, I wouldn't even bother with structures or even pre-fab tents. Just a FT point and everything stored. 
---
I went into survival to get the action hero. That challenge was all about crafting so I needed my benches to stay away from stations at least.  When I did I got the old "someone's in your spot" 10 times in a row so I gave up. I figured I'd just use their benches but when I got to our shared camp space there was nothing. 
---
I ended up placing my camp in another place. It didn't get destroyed but I felt like it was a big neon "come kill me" sign with it's lighted "welcome home" sign and Fasnacht balloons.
---
Yes!!!!
---
Ah, Should have been clearer. This is the very first one, the quest to earn the backpack.
---
&gt;the burrows
---
Holy crap, thanks for the reminder! I completely forgot about this questline...
---
What I‚Äôve been doing all my alts is running Can Do and Good Doggy early; it‚Äôs genuinely easier to stay fed and hydrated. Plus the extra caps don‚Äôt hurt.
---
That guy is hard to listen to.
---
&gt; This is a retoast 
---
Is that like when you leave the toaster going and it doesn't pop up / turn off on time so you have to make some more? I kid. This made me chuckle though.
---
I saw someone with the 'imported Chinese' teddy bear for a ridiculously high amount... get it??!? Cause its imported?? Made me chuckle. I kinda like it when they have a few things like that, as long as their normal prices are decent lol.
---
Read the title wrong, this should get looked into, tho I personally don't use class freak since I'm fine with the negative effects of my mutations since they don't affect what my builds are specifically for.
---
True enough, but they formed because of FEV experiments on unwilling subjects. 
---
I can't recall a mutated BoS member in any of the games, can you?
---
I'm not yet sure if I regret removing my Deathclaw. I thought the shade of green was a bit too much against a backdrop of the Savage Divide; I kept the cats as they're a lot easier on the eyes, on account of being smaller. Plus, cats.
---
I have a ‚Äúyou have been insulted‚Äù paper from insult bot set at an insulting price of 10,000 caps.
---
More likely your internet connection than anything.
---
As long as she spews only on my right arm I should be all right.
---
Constantly crashed last night but did a hard reset of the console this morning and that sorted it out, at least for now, have to see what tonight brings lol
---
Bro i still haven't completed that every time I do it the randos just shoot the stealth assultron it's like I'm the only pilon and they do Soo much damage I tend to run out of stims in the first 5 minutes because no one else wants to be shocked they just try to kill her without it (sorry for bad Grammer)
---
I posted a prime target on your thread. If you‚Äôre on PS4
---
Endangerol syringe works on SBQ. -25% DR. Very nice way to cut her super high DR down.
---
Pretty sure it has to be maxed to Tame, but each card works for different creatures. I have both maxed because I want full ability to Tame. You can only Tame creatures half your level and lower, too.
---
Yeah doesn't look tradable. Let's see if I can place it in a container
---
Just did exactly this yesterday. 3 or 4 runs through Watoga High for all that sweet sweet plastic, and all bulked up for sale to day. Was thinking about putting some of it up for sale through vending, anyone had any success in that area?
---
Would still love a stash upgrade though :)
---
Still, great find!
---
There is no bug. Never was. Vendors only get a small percentage of what you spent.
---
A few months ago vendors only showed 200 caps. So buying something for around 800 would refill it completely 
---
Now that all vendors show 1400, spending 800 only refills around 200 (not exact numbers just throwing examples.) 
---
So a few months ago it APPEARED to be fully refilling them due to their low cap count at the time.
---
It has always only given back about 25 percent of what you spend. Just easier to see it now that all vendors share a 1400 cap pool.
---
It was available long after the beta. I dont know if it still is though. I got mine from dogs at the scorched beast queen event.
---
The can be explained away as it's not a bug but server de sync. Witch is technically LAG. OP when this happens have you tried opening a container and been treated with the spinny wheel of death? That if you leave the container and then open the container again and see loot?. That's server deaynce
---
Switch servers will fix the issue in most cases
---
Bummer.
---
I have had like maybe 6 crashes since launch and it‚Äôs on my external hard drive lately I‚Äôve been playing for like 4-5 hour sessions and no crashes for quite a while
---
It just stopped at this moment
---
Sounds like it isn‚Äôt quite as tough as they said it would be.  But also sounds like the new Project Paradise is a bit challenging.  Lvl100 Sheepsquatches?!
---
I'll add you when I get off work.
---
Your first shot should be a vat crit to her spots...no poison worries.
---
Agree, I have stopped doing them now as I seem to spend a hell of a lot of game time jumping arouind the map, for what, a poxy 20 atoms!!!!
---
What does that do? I've searched and con only find people asking about it.
---
I stopped picking up code pieces because of this. I‚Äôve noticed that they will sit there and self duplicate until you leave the server.
---
Far too low!
---
Thank you for trying :)
---
That‚Äôs pretty lame imo thanks though.
---
We fill the stash regardless of the space we have.  If we increase it, we will just fill it again.  At some point we just need cut off.  We don‚Äôt need to have 500 of every resource, but we do have that much.  I saw leave it at 800.
---
Nope doesn't look like it gonna work. Sorry. Check your misc and make sure you didnt grab an extra by accident.
---
This is an amazing tip!
---
Why does it matter? I'm selling a Gold Plated Drinking Glass for 9999 Caps. Turns out you're not even obligated to buy it. Who would have thought? But, if you're in the market for an over priced Drinking Glass and you have a sense of humour, by all means buy it.
---
&gt; You should not be let out of the loading screen till the world is populated
---
From your mouth to God's ear.
---
I haven't thought through the intricacies of doing this from a programming and game design standpoint (though I may have to think that one through), but I'm in total agreement with you on that one.
---
It wouldn't be hard to program, but as with all things, there are ramifications to any change you make on something like that (and of course it's not quite as simple as it sounds).
---
Honestly, from a design standpoint, it's really just a way to minimize the loading screen time - if you're staring at a blank screen, you're counting the seconds.  If your character is visible, even if yo ucan't do anything, you've stopped that timer, and it 'feels' quicker.  I doubt the idea was thought through more than that (if even that far).
---
Damn that's pretty cool!
---
No problem. Hope you find one. I have 5. So it's too hard to find them
---
Heard the same when I went about 2 weeks ago but I‚Äôve been before and don‚Äôt remember it being there so idk if they added it with one of these new updates but it was defiantly there for me recently. Just not a month or so ago
---
some do.. some dont...
---
Regardless of personal opinion, it really should be possible to be 3 star like the rest, right?
---
I use it for stealth, the combined crouched move speed is invaluable when stealthing everywhere, and nothing else comes close. Armour rating and acceptance don't matter when you rarely get hit and wear an outfit, really
---
I dont want to play all day.  I'm just saying sometimes it feels like a  microtransaction game without microtransactions.  You are capped on what you can do in a certain period of time.  It just limits it's own potential.  You can seriously max out everything for the day in about an hour.
---
Ah, so if I wanted a Deathclaw, all I'd need is Wasteland Whisperer maxed? Y ea, I knew about half my level thing, I'm level 177 currently. so aside from a level 91, I should be able to tame anything with just the 1 specific card equipped?
---
If we‚Äôre going to keep expanding camps then Bethesda definitely needs to readjust what they just tweaked with camp building. I can‚Äôt place anything down as long as it‚Äôs within a two foot radius of an object..they are literally forcing players to build in the open which is extremely dumb.
---
Yes the mid Western Bos did recruit ghouls I believe fallout tactics there also mentioned in fo3 sorry I don't have links and they didn't form because of FEV they formed because they didn't want some politician to come out of a vault and try and finish the war also because they where aware of the enclave.
---
Same.  Got 2 of them months ago.  Haven't really done much Queen hunting lately.
---
Yes even if that means less players per world.
---
It stopped I think it goes only at midnight in not sure its freaking me out though.
---
I have done it only once but it went perfect
---
I went back to the body there wasn't anything in his inventory
---
It does nothing but take up a line in my inventory list.
---
I agree somewhat. I was finally getting good at managing to the 800 lb level. But with vending now, it junk they need some extra space to stash the vending items.  
---
I was surprised to see that we can have as many vending machines as we want though.  Seems like maybe one each would suffice.   Force us to be a bit more discerning with why we list for sale.  Now you role into some camps and there is 10 vending machines.
---
War, War never changes, i'll come punish your greedy play style... Atom purification for all \o/
---
I've seen it a lot with low-level mobs, sneaking through a house trying to clear it and suddenly they're all dead. Last night I had it happen to a mob I had to kill for a quest. I was walking down the stairs when I hear a Scorched death-rattle, and suddenly the quest pinged, I got the XP and the loot, and wow, level 25. It was a little anti-climatic.
---
I agree with this to a point, but we‚Äôre talking about someone on YouTube talking video games, not the birth of philosophy or mathematics. 
---
Can you explain to me why this is someone you look up to?
---
Why stop at 1K though
---
Trough is pronounced "TROFF"...
---
Love, your friendly neighborhood English teacher.
---
Thanks for the info on the shutdown, I wasn't aware of that.
---
As someone with four mutations, I support this. 
---
Weird idea to make it a bit more interesting, but maybe the bonus damage against players could scale with the number of mutations they have instead of being 30% up front. Like, 7.5% per mutation, max of 75% or something like that. Like there's a point where you cross the line into being less human than a super mutant, no matter what you look like on the outside. That might be mechanically hard to do though, so idk, just spitballing.
---
If it's not locked players can also get in.
---
It's all part of what waits inside the church. The people who were inside are now gouls and the pastor is now a glowing wendigo. The music usually stops when you get near the organ piano or big room of church
---
Hmm I don‚Äôt remember what time of day it was for me but I actually really like it and yeah it does get a little spooky but made me think of the fall and October which I love :)
---
Yea, you get it. Hopefully someone will comment on a way to fix it that magically has no down sides and has super fast load screens. But it's doubtful. Hope the OP understands the issue also
---
Yeah some people shoot them and you don't get a wanted level for doing that.
---
Yo buddy, I'm in the same situation. You just have left "Revive an ally", right? Maybe we can both revive each other?
---
Personally, I think that would be he most I would recommend.  800 was perfect for me.  Kept me flush but not overencumbered.   But with player vending now, I feel like we deserve a bump.  But not more.
---
3* Ski Sword: Choppy McChopface
---
Spoken told me it make use the camera isn‚Äôt favorited and just rename it. It worked for me on the tadpole
---
 challenges.
---
There's scorched attack dogs that spawn at the scorched queen event, they drop dog helmets and a bandana.
---
Got a snallygaster for 2nd rank at Toxic sludge and Yao Gai (the bear) but dont know which feeder and i think he was also rank 2
---
Sure we can revive each other. Are you on pc? Add me mazterbelen1
---
An Idea for extra stash space: Extra container... that is not part of your stash. You can lock it, but others could picklock it and steal all (for bounty of course). It would be nice add to the game in many ways. and you could keep it unlocked if you want to share with others.
---
Dave it. No one can say what it does.
---
Why did Maxson execute the scientists and desert days before the bombs dropped then? 
---
I'm not saying that my way is the only right way, I'm just saying that my take on the BoS has led me to playing with no mutations. If you feel differently, that's fine. It could lead to great roleplaying if we ever have organized player factions.  üòÅ
---
Tried 4 times across 3 chars today, ALL lock ups.
---
Yao guai is rank two for venison, but thank you!
---
This shouldn‚Äôt be the only viable build for you but I‚Äôm not here to criticize if that‚Äôs your play style i agree that it should work the same as any other armor. I‚Äôm mainly upset because they tweaked camp building but they didn‚Äôt say anything about it in the patch notes. I can‚Äôt place anything down now as long as it‚Äôs within a two foot radius of a rock or a tree..essentially forcing players to build more out in the open and I don‚Äôt understand why they are limiting camp creativity it‚Äôs really killing the game for me. I‚Äôm not personally worried about armor if I can‚Äôt even build my house again to store it in..ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Shit, had no idea thats where it even came from good looks
---
I'm glad you think I sound smart lol *waving goodbye* I hope you never fill that gapping hole of something missing. It really brings out the best in you lmao
---
Got one yesterday. Every dog will drop one down at queen
---
Of course. I dont want to JUST max everything every day, but it seems pointless to do any events after that because all the loot you get is potentially wasted.  I drop bags and bags of stuff all the time.  I guess I just want more space is what I'm saying.
---
No, for me it kept playing for like 10 min straight.
---
LMAO. I said TRYING. there ya go not comprehending what's written again.
---
No, not every dog.  I have plenty that didn't.
---
I lock up in the elevator.
---
Yeah same here.
---
Sarcasm I love it
---
.....oh
---
Might as well do it in the water so you dont have to do it again later for the swimmer badge
---
I haven‚Äôt found it either. I look at any tourist site I am near but nothing. Earlier on I tried server hopping to no avail. Not really sure the point of adding this line of challenges but making it so hard for folks to start. Of course some people found it easily.
---
I stopped doing the queen when people would join just to shoot the queen once and wait till someone else kill her. Then the event would fail because her dr is too much for the three or so people attempting to kill the queen.
---
&gt; Your Preserved Pie isn't worth 25K Caps.
---
I don't think anyone hopes to actually sell those, it's just showing off that you have it.
---
Well in that case it could of been a bug as it happened to me one time where I killed the wendigo and the music was still playing
---
I‚Äôve found the clean spacesuit helmet in the shop across from the medical center too. (Next to the beauty salon)
---
Ah. I never used it. I fast traveled to the event
---
Its not supposed to do anything. It a glitch.
---
I was either at your store yesterday, or someone else had the same idea!
---
You can only Tame creatures from the random spawn locations, though. I've tamed a few Deathclaws, but recently read you can't take them anymore for some reason. I can't vouch for that though because I haven't seen one in the right situation.
---
Why does it matter if a player can get in, they can't destroy your base unless you're in pvp with them
---
It was fixed for a bit, but then a patch broke it, and then it was never fixed again LOL
---
I just hold onto extra stuff for the next day - I drop heavy stuff like miniguns and the like. You could always make yourself a mule and have a friend help you move things around!
---
Yea, I am. IGN: Tennousu
---
I‚Äôd be up for it as well. GT: Shlambaisted. Should be on later tonight, but I‚Äôm also usually on most afternoons/evenings EST, and looking for something to do in game.
---
I'm all for PVP balance and fairness and this is a great idea as mutations are required for current PVP and this would give noobs and poor wasters a chance to cut our mutated asses down a bit.
---
Added.

/1 Handmade

/2 Tesla
---
Etc. I am That creative. I also haven't touched my camp since I built it at level 5. It's a square wooden shack with every workbench and a bed.
---
Plus even if it's not another player a level 1 anything can kill them in like 2 hits.
---
Seems many people are using mods to highlight stealthed players in survival. I agree stealthbois are too powerful but nerfing the user's damage output is too harsh considering pvpers can see you just fine
---
Well mine isn't role play mine is lore but he didn't form the Bo's because of the FEV he killed all those people because what they where doing was fucked up
---
It's an exploration game as much as it's a survival game.  Sure, you can do everything you need to *survive* in an hour, but there are a ton of things you can do or prepare for that you will not get done in that time.  And if you finish farming your scrip, make enough food and water, farm up enough scraps for repairs and stims and those 5000 bullets you'll use on the next SBQ fight, you can always go to events for recipes and plans, rebuild your base, or just go out and explore.
---
I play a few hours a day most days, and that's enough time to farm up stuff for a couple big fights, putting a dent in my scrip collection, and a little shopping.  Not much else.  I could easily keep myself busy for a couple more hours just sightseeing and looking for things I'm missing.  Another big block once in a while if I feel creative and want to build.  If I'm still finding extra time, I hop around looking for SBQ fights or any of the better events to get stuff out of.
---
The only think you're really capped on doing is selling stuff for caps, and getting scrip.  You can always farm legendaries the old fashioned way, you may end up with more than you can turn in, but anything good can still be sold, traded, or given away (or just dropped).
---
The game is a lot more stable now so that helps. I just give my character some depth and role play so that the grind feels more like personal missions. I collect a lot of random shit too. Make special trips to places just to get certain junk or ammo. I just get out what I put in I feel like.
---
.... Can I stea- *cough* borrow that idea :3 ?
---
Yeah that's too bad. Like I said I have 5, so they aren't impossible to find. But they do show up under misc tab so double check you dont already have one. I hoard junk so I picked up atleast 3 of those without even noticing. Good luck.
---
Do you know how much plastic I've wasted this way? It should've been fixed a long time ago.
---
Had it happen on Ultracite found seller selling 2 scrap for 1 or 2 caps, got failed message
---
You just have to focus on the things you like and pay less attention to the things you don't. Plenty to like *and* dislike if you look for it. 
---
In no order and without knowing anything about why you like fallout in general or what you like to do I'd say, in no order:
---
- try playing on only survival
---
- start a shop and try vending
---
- try playing through the main quest again, less bugs now and you can grab onto other things like the scouts quest along the way
---
- get into hardcore base building
---
- try and hit level 500. ;-)
---
I've done it a couple of times without issue, but like all things in this game, it works just fine for some, not so well for others and for a very unlucky group, not at all.
---
TBH. I understand your frustrations. But from the opposite side of the fence. Did you ever consider since you just had one event fail because of a "glitch" that you might want to hop servers to get on a potential non "glitched" server. Before you did anything else.
---
Yes we all know that the game has bugs, and issues with "glitches" but some as you just reported can be explained as pure human error.
---
The old addage " Better to be safe than sorry" come into play here.
---
I'm not saying you did wrong expecting the game to work correctly. But if it failed 1 time. I server hop. Cause if it failed again and I didn't hop shame on me.
---
I know that I'll probably get down voted to Oblivion here. But a lot of the post on this sub the last few days can be attributed to human error and not a error on the side if caution.
---
I love cats and trash cats, but boosting luck and agility... Benefits from food stack unlike drugs.
---
In a physical sense the paradox makes sense like in our world .. but the effect is like an aura on the weapon .. it exists regardless of the weapon it's applied tom the weapon happen to become the weapon on the roll .. so changing the weapon should have not affect the traits applied to it as a whole.
---
In any event if it remains why not remove all legendary traits on a weapon once it's repaired or altered why keep any .. once it's even used it is no longer the original.
---
They can steal your crops, kill your brahmin/pets.
---
And possibly lead armies of mobs to your camp.
---
I read the lore available on a few wikis. Testing on prisoners IS fucked up, but they weren't testing skin creams or ice cream flavors  ... they were mutating them.
---
I wish we could bulk ammo.
---
I‚Äôd really like to sell packs for unique amounts.  Like a 24 pack of shotgun shells for 20 caps.
---
A good place is the camp adams event Campfire Tales either spawns a low level Legendary Scorpion or a Legendary Wendigo (not sure of the wendigo level) but I get the scorpion more often than the wendigo.
---
WE NEED MORE!!! im at 358/800 what a fuck are you hoarding? also i play with 1 str build and im not overweight
---
I guess so, but I can imagine that isn't normally common
---
For me I love building, trading, player vending and legendary farming, as well as the new possum challenges.
---
Cleared it like 10 minutes ago, found plenty of fans and screws.
---
It's intersecting with itself. Try placing it somewhere else first, then move it to the original place
---
You can complete it by reviving anybody, I just joined a high level event and revived people there
---
How does it compare to the deathclaw gauntlet? Has anyone been able to get one from the purveyor?
---
Naked and afk? Begging for it!
---
Damn, must have missed it
---
I mean red dead has poker. Why not? FNV had a few casino games if I remember correctly. A poker game for caps or atoms would be awesome. And WV does have 4 casinos. Should add Wheeling and its Island Casino as an expansion and then play other games there too
---
At least from the videos I've seen he does his best to bring verifiable information to his viewers and corrects himself when he's wrong. I know some of his opinions are there but I don't watch for his opinions. Now why do you not like him?
---
I'm to the point I hope I don't get anymore legendaries. I have 900 scrip and enough scrip scrap to spend them all and build back up to 1000 without picking up another one. Admittedly I don't have a vending machine.
---
Bezerker
---
Not an option here.
---
I played so much blackjack in Red Dead. If they put it in here it might be the only thing I did anymore.
---
Both primary
---
leader of the pack is good for low lvl
---
On PC? I was on around 7pm till late last night mountain time.
---
This happens to me but only for CAMPS. It fixes for me after a minute or two.
---
At White springs today all the scorch in the clubhouse we're Frozen in position and nothing on them. I jumped worlds twice and still arrive at the same situation.It's not really big deal I've done very well there.
---
I know I do enjoy the syringers. It was hard to get the radscorpion it took me forever. I was thinking it was 40% damage instead of 40 points. I was also hoping that when in pvp if you shoot someone with it that it would give the same effect with the distortion of the screen. Or if you could turn a person into a bloat fly when they die would be awesome Lol
---
Well you did a really good job at trying not to sound stupid. Same form of sarcasm just threw in an oxymoron. Might be one too many if you get my drift. Do you kind of understand how that works? 
---
I haven't had to explain things like this since I talked to a two year old.
---
Yeah I keep one just for that reason too
---
Leader of the pack event in the forrest. Always 3-4 low level legendaries
---
I server hop and it fixes it.
---
is this true TRUE? 3\* degrades in to 1\*??? what!?
---
Also at the top left of the map by vault 51.
---
Is the elevator the only way down?
---
Cool. Have to farm this weekend.
---
I dont like wood armor but totally agree with you.
---
800 is more round though.  Same with 8000, 8008, and a few others.
---
Yes I've played quite a lot of fallout I know what they where doing don't you remember vault 81? I'm just saying the FEV wasn't the main reason for the BOS forming is was the collapse of the world and the worry that some gov stooge would restart the war after they found dead mutants at the edge of the glow he realized what was going on and stopped it there original goals didn't include killing all mutants that came after the master and the obsessive collection of advanced weaponry didn't happen till much later they originally wanted to preserve it and prevent it from dooming the world again.
---
You need to server hop since it‚Äôs a popular location. Another good location is the Tyler fairgrounds which has a good number of toys which also furnish screws.
---
I mean, I grew up in the city and my parents just had to accept the fact that taking their kid outside for any reason could result in their little boy hearing, smelling and seeing some stuff they'd rather he didn't.  It's just an unavoidable part of life in a densely populated area.  If you have to take the train or bus to get around, you have 0 control over the amount of puke, shit, drug use, profanity and conflict you might run across.
---
As a parent that has at least some control over what your child sees and hears online, it's really completely up to you as to what games are suitable, and to try and delineate what they can and cannot do in those games.  Realistically, I'm sure the chat in any pvp style game that the teenage crowd plays generally devolves into sexual and racial slurs, trash talk and insult.  My neighbor's son is in high school and literally screams all types of horrific shit into his headset, for hours on end, that all his neighbors can hear.  The N word is incorporated into virtually every sentence, and apparently most of the people he plays against are homosexual.
---
You didn‚Äôt get stable flux ? If you don‚Äôt put a dent in the queens health (or unload like 500 rounds of ammo) you don‚Äôt get loot from it. it should give you maybe 2 legendaries and some prime plans if it does though
---
Oh shit. That's where they're going! omg xD Guess I gotta manually scrap everything.
---
Well if you give me a few hours i wouldnt mind helping each other out
---
rats are cute
---
I experienced this whilst helping a low level player build a camp around a week ago, it‚Äôs massively annoying. Hopefully the volume of threads regarding this will prompt Bethesda to resolve it.
---
Love the hair. üòÄ
---
I don't think anyone can really tell you how to enjoy the game because we all enjoy it differently but some suggestions for things my friends and I like to do. 
---
I have a clothing + plans shop - I normally server hop and collect all kinds out outfits, rare and common both and i pick up every plan I can find and try to grab rare ones from Grahm and then I move them to my low level shopkeeper Sonni and I do all my vending there. It's fun and I like to come up with different outfits and I like to find and learn all the plans. 
---
Some people like to build incredible bases. I've seen an AT AT from star wars and the enterprise from star trek on this forum - people are super creative. Maybe you could try to find a neat location and just build your heart out - create your own creepy story. Someone made a creepy maze with a deathclaw in it at one point! 
---
With every bug they fix, another is introduced. It's getting better all the time but I think there will always be bugs no matter what they do. It's just something you can either accept and put up with or don't :c
---
Am I the only person that has never, ever, ever had an issue with bulk junk in my inventory being scrapped?   
---
Is there a single reason, ever, to be in a situation where you press "SCRAP ALL" while having bulked junk items in your inventory?
---
That‚Äôs the only place it can go
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox you can make a post on the fallout club saying you have the event on you and people will join your world (you have to be set to appear online or else it won‚Äôt let them join you)
---
I like my women like I like my Fallout 76 DLC.  Large.  Difficult to figure out.  Challenging to overcome.  Being played with by thousands of others at the same time.
---
gauss may fall into a energy category but it still fires a ballistic shell, it is a ballistic weapon and can still be found as a TSE unlike the other energy weapons.  
---
i dont know if it falls into two categories like the pipe rifle/pistol thing does but it is considered a ballistic rifle on perks.
---
I‚Äôd like to go into ‚Äúdon‚Äôt save mode‚Äù where challenges are tracked but no photo is saved to the gallery.
---
At least your intention was good. I still need to revive someone. My worlds are always so empty though.
---
God you're dense.
---
No flux, nothing. All three times.
---
My legit TSE lever I've had since early game is named FAITHFUL.
---
My explosive damage to robot minigun is A LEARNING COMPUTER
---
My bloodied death Tambo, which I thought I would only use for a bit and turned out to be amazing is TEMP LOVE
---
My bloodied harpoon gun is FISHERMAN'S FRIEND
---
And my explosive AA sub machine gun is COD4, homage to my... COD4 days ;)
---
Gotcha, I‚Äôll send you a message. Reply when you‚Äôre available.
---
I don‚Äôt have an opinion on them, I made it perfectly clear that earlier. My opinion was about people mindlessly following faux celebrities and not forming their own opinions.
---
Although I agree with what your saying, I have not actually heard any kids in this game as of yet.  
---
And if there are any very young children playing it, their parents are going to find out why they should mute the voice of other people first, or little johnny is gonna be telling the other kids at school to suck a big one
---
Well when you highest value item is 20 caps, I question your thinking process. I can kill a super mutant and find a 50 cap shitty assault rifle all day. So you definitely have a different view point on how you value your loot from the game.
---
I would suggest the Charleston Herald as there's a bunch of fans /  type writers in there!
---
Its okay that you dont know dont get butthurt
---
I mean,  there ARE fish in the water so,  yeah they should.
---
The mini gun should be The Reprogrammer
---
Yeah I can't believe how many kids are on that game. Definitely not for kids. Single player multi player any player
---
I want to play pool and use the dart board
---
I have a solution, Im on ps4 and I fixed it by accident. Get ready for something stupid.
---
‚ÄòI have space in my photo gallery‚Äô short answer? Dont have space.
---
I filled up my gallery completely by accident and AS SOON AS I DID, the challenges started registering. If it‚Äôs not saving a photo, it should work.
---
haha nice one, do you have any suggestions for my flaming chainsaw?
---
Glad to hear there have been some improvements on these such as the vendor cap consolidation and camp bugs. 
---
For workshops, I posted an idea when the game was fairly fresh that I think could improve workshops. They would essentially work like workshops in FO4 where they saved your progress and they would start with no resources which would give players somewhere to invest their extra materials. The CAMP is your own personal home or whatever you make of it, but I initially viewed the Workshops as the main place to build and defend from other players or PvE attacks just like in FO4. Without saving progress or giving a place to invest resources, they just became worthless unless you wanted to farm a specific material while you were online. 
---
Player vending will aid with someplace to offload extra materials, but only if people buy from you. I'd be interested to see how the community economy is working. Along with Legendary scrips, I can see some of the pressure alleviated by providing some opportunities to offload collected gear and mats. I'm planning on getting back into the wastes and see the improvements.
---
I think gaining an additional 200 lbs for stash will always be nice and even more-so as more stuff is released. Again though, it still feels like a band-aid fix. I know there are improvements as discussed, but back when I was playing I remember going out to explore, collect gear and materials, but inevitably fill up my stash/inventory and have no outlet for spares other than to throw on the ground or try to find someone to give it to. The game became an inventory management simulator while you collected the stuff you actually needed and get a bunch of extra that you couldn't even sell or use for anything. 
---
I think the first stash was at 200 lbs and when it was maxed out I would think, an extra 200 lbs would be nice. Once that was full I thought, an extra 200 would sure be nice. It sounds like we are at 800 now and again we are hitting the limit where 200 more sure sounds nice. Every day you play and cannot fully offload your collected resources for the day by either selling to vendors or using at your CAMP, it was that much more stored in your stash until it inevitably filled up. And so, the cycle repeats. 
---
With all that said, I really do look forward to getting back into the game, but I also really hope that Bethesda is taking the issue seriously. Such as making workshops worthwhile as something to invest materials into, studying the CAMP budget and possibly allowing something in addition to CAMPS that can use spare resources. Simply increasing the budget only further increases our hoarding of materials and doesn't solve the problem. I'll gain a better understanding of the state of the game as I get back into it though.
---
this is part of their "keep the free atoms to a minimum, so they have to spend real money" campaign
---
I do know my AAE gatling laser is a legacy weapon.
---
 Poor thing does nothing but collect dust in my stash Box as I am not a heavy weapon user.
---
I mean that event specific plans ALWAYS drop, not just like 1 out of 5 times you do the event.
---
Wait you‚Äôre complaining just that it‚Äôs a kid? Like they didn‚Äôt even do anything to bother you outside of just being young?
---
I did by accident, more than once..
---
Wait, are those the recipes for sale? I thought they were just the serums?
---
I love that they added this hope we get more in the future i need dark stuff
---
*im 14 am i allowed*
---
I don't think that's *technically* true about 80085...
---
To me the script cap is fine and I don't need another way to aquire scripts. Even with limited time to play and a set routine. I max out 2 toons scipts per day. And that's in a 3 hour window without server hoping.
---
OP, understand the frustrations that you are incountering, but it's a way for Bethesda to not get sued for inline gambling. Plain and simple as that.
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one
---
Yeah I should realize that, on second look it did apply.. I'll delete the post Lol
---
I like the idea of doomsday bunker. I‚Äôd stay
---
This fixed it for me too last night.  For some reason the game was confused about where an Upper Floor was actually placed.  I changed servers and it magically worked the way it was supposed to.
---
Thats the only way. Its just a crap shoot. One character i had to get rid of all 5 mutations i had before it eliminated the one i was trying to get rid of. Another time i wanted to get rid of 2 and i was lucky got rid of them on 2 tries. If you arent prepared to buy every serum again dont bother.
---
It‚Äôs all random how you get them and lose them. I used a rad shower until u got rid of the one I wanted, then I bought the serums to restore mine from players.
---
it's true, even though I'm pretty damn good at inventory management but everytime new content comes out I have to think to myself what am I going to sacrifice
---
They don't test even basic game mechanisms in Bethesda. This is another prove that they don't even play their own game at all.
---
Idk I don't think it should drop every time - it gives you the reason to do the event more than once.
---
Number of players on the server has something to do with it.
---
I always shoot them. More lead/aluminum/steel for me.
---
I let him give me whatever then shoot him as he turns away.
---
Interesting, this adds value to it.
---
LoL yeah totally
---
I‚Äôm so happy I read this
---
Huh? Are you referring to the locked safe in the back of a pick up truck by Raleigh Clay's Bunker? I was just there today and it just says "Safe Key Needed".
---
I gave him a few chances, but no more! Bothersome twat of a bot.
---
Had a broadsider called THE FAT CONTROLLER for a while, but I‚Äôm 99% stealth, so I sold him.
---
That's a good point.  Either way, they need someone to give a quick sanity check on these things.  Events requiring a ton of people should send server notifications.
---
This game engine can barely run as it is, you want them to fucking dynamically change the ID of EVERY SINGLE BULLET (plus everything else) when another player picks it up? Yikes.
---
Is this a new thing? I remember pretty vividly getting killed over and over again at the Sons of Dane compound while doing the event in the barn.
---
highest sale day ive had so far was a little over 41k, course i have been pack ratting legendaries for several weeks, saving ammo and everything i could find. had 35k rounds of 5mm alone.   
---
ive spent probably closed to 40k in caps for plans and a weapon or two, and a couple pieces of armor and still sitting at around 70k caps.  
---
what he said above is true be reasonable in prices, dont post for suggested price..  
---
although my 15 preserved pies i posted in my machine for 15k each are not for sale just for show only.
---
They‚Äôre not there.  I was going to use some of my glut of atoms to buy them but they‚Äôre just not buyable.
---
So,  my freebies will remain in place at my camp.
---
A few days ago I found a person's camp that all of the walls in the main room were covered with cuckoo clocks and all of the flat surfaces covered in other clocks. 
---
Nope. I'm out.
---
I don‚Äôt think you want to do this....
---
What platform and level? Whitesprings usually gives me single star weapons, but every so often it drops amazing stuff.
---
they're working on it
---
(but not fast enough, I've been at max photos since forever)
---
The level 50+ event?
---
Keep trying, hopefully you'll get a server made up of people who can read the mission objectives and follow them.  I got amazingly lucky to have people who paid attention instead of just shooting everything moving and expecting it to all work out in the end.
---
And don't forget to fix the automated turrets, they are very handy to have working!
---
PC, yes, but I feel like this was in the Savage Divide. Tbh I can‚Äôt remember, I visited about 40 camps yesterday. But that one stuck out, especially since I ran into Insult Bot about an hour later near a fissure site. He‚Äôs trying to insult me about my ‚Äòstupid blue suit‚Äô while two scorch beasts are raining froth at me.
---
I'm sitting right at 789 so I have 10 left for 10 drinks in the fermenter. Life is rough right now.
---
I'm just sad because I had to move my main camp due to anglers killing my pets so I don't have any of them now. At least I still have them on my other girl.
---
Me he gets it as soon as he opens his USB port.
---
That was really fun to read out loud hahaha
---
'k!
---
Honestly, the "game night" market is kinda booming right now.  Bethesda would do well to collaborate with a quality tabletop gaming company, like Z-Man or Asmodee, to create real life versions of their games.
---
And how in hell did I get registered for a lottery years before I was even born? Those identity thieves are time travelers now, or something.
---
Magic??? Wtf you mean?
---
*Mission complete*
---
I wanna at least try it but it's physically impossible without more people. At least with people there is a chance.
---
I never bought the serums, I server hopped when I‚Äôd mutate for all of them. Got lucky and got carnivore over herbivore. I‚Äôm worried about that one as well. I‚Äôm staring down at every mutation so I‚Äôd have to be pretty lucky. I‚Äôm thinking about doing it and trying to strike deals with individual people for the mutations I lose.
---
Could you elaborate on some pricing? Ive had my spot open for some time now and hardly get any bites, all my ammo is 1C, bobbles are like 100, high end clothing bout 100C as well, etc.
---
Same rarity as assassin sent
---
I do there the only explosive turrets you can get what system are you on?
---
Lol o i see you checked my profile what were you hoping to find?
---
Damn, was thinking about nuking her...guess I‚Äôll pass. Any suggestions or just stick to Whitesprings for loot?
---
Yeah we definitely need some skins for weapon
---
What console? I'm on ps4 and I have all serums but 3 (herbivore,electrically charged and empath) 
---
Well... ability to craft them anyway, i probably have 1 or 2 not in stock at the moment.
---
Insult Bot dies too.
---
Had a bloodied one used it once and sold it its a complete waste of time.
---
I have crashed a lot but when I got home today I got on it crashed then I went in to my friends sever and it  worked but then when I hopped sever it cashed
---
I‚Äôm thinking this would be my best bet as well. It just sucks because I‚Äôm nervous about how bad my rng will be
---
The low level enemies are tough
---
same, couldnt put a roof on, even placing another object to hide a tree next to it.  I also get no item selected or w.e when I try placing some floor objects even though it's green.
---
My Bloodied Ultracite Gatling Laser is named Death Star.  Green pew pew beams FTW.
---
I do what I want.
---
some people choose to sleep, and go to work during that 20 hour period tho.
---
How so
---
If you're on Xbox
---
I can gift you 100 screws
---
I think you need to fast travel near the event, then walk the rest. Worked for me.
---
Ah I‚Äôm on Xbox. Thanks though, I‚Äôd definitely have taken you up on that offer.
---
What do you hold on to prewar money for? In FO4 I tried to keep it to sell, but haven't yet found a use for it in 76 other than cloth.
---
The worst part about fo76 when it first launched was the server disconnects and the occasional disappearing quest. Aside from that the game was still a lot of fun and now the days of constant crashing are over
---
Where can I get one of these? I would like to enact my right to Bear Arms
---
In terms of effort - server hopping at the giant teapot is the best for time/reward tradeoff - you only have to run 10 feet to check if it‚Äôs there or not.
---
Spawns on central table in front of the teapot.
---
i have most serums on xbox
---
gt same as here
---
Do the teapot!!
---
No, but there‚Äôs a hunter one that specifies *killing* a Yao Guai with a syringer. That one works. The chemist trio only specifies hitting them. You‚Äôre saying you completed the chemist one by actually killing them?
---
Rise of the Thor build!
---
Yeah, the leaderboard is super annoying. I‚Äôve recently started a survival only and no outside trade/transfer character that is currently level 17. The score feature and location giveaway puts me in the ‚Äútop 3‚Äù well over 50% of the time. It‚Äôs unbelievably dumb that I‚Äôm being constantly hunted at sub-level 20 by people 30+ levels on me. Also, dedicated PvP folks are almost never on top and are the ones itching for blood.   
---
Oh, and the dream of a ‚Äúone life only character‚Äù? Never going to happen under the current system.  
---
Bethesda needs to add something like ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù, where the map will show a thermal mark of sorts that indicates action taking place, whether it be PvE or PvP. The more intense the activities the darker it‚Äôll show etc., that way you can always break off and let the storm settle down.
---
I think those are considered random encounters.  They exist to freak you the lower levels without murdering them outright in a fight they can't win.
---
yeah i can‚Äôt place a roof and can‚Äôt figure out why. can place the sort of cone roof but not the flat one. doesn‚Äôt make any sense
---
Top of the lighthouse got mine there after watching a video.
---
I‚Äôll pm you. They delete your comment if you say the name!!! It‚Äôs like Voldemort! Lmao
---
How much do you charge for serums?
---
Yeah they are.
---
You're just a bottom-tier liar-type troll. Go fuck yourself.
---
That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm totally thinking of the hunter badge.
---
I'm dyingüòÇ thanks for the funny.
---
Apparently if you power your console off completely (hold down the button) and boot it back up this clears some caches that might be causing the crash.  Totally anecdotal, no idea if it actually does anything but can't hurt.
---
How much would you be willing to sell them for? I don‚Äôt know yet how many I‚Äôd need.
---
You mean Polarbear Igloo? What proof do you have of him duping?
---
Go for it if you want but it‚Äôs not like the SBQ where you can tag and hide. I almost got one shotted by an assaultron and I was in full power armor and I‚Äôm lvl 130~.
---
Installing dauntless tonight.  lols
---
That feels like it wouldn't be useful very often unless you spend all of your time doing nuke zones. Not to say it doesn't sound cool because it does but - seems a bit like nocturnal to me?
---
Try the new thing.
---
Huh... Okay, well I appreciate the responses. I guess there is a Z-Factor involved that wasn't noticed.
---
That is funny though.
---
Wait, the dumbbells scrap for lead???
---
I can't get over how slow it feels without Speed Demon. I've got 2 permanent luck dedicated to Starched-Genes. I hope to never again lose my precious mutations due to a lapse in my perk micro.
---
I like it!
---
Yes, why are they excluding the majority of their player base?  To promote pvp in a game where pvp is extremely unpopular and does not fit well.
---
Still on PC.
---
The RNG tends to let you get the useful ones last and remove them first. I‚Äôve tried this several rounds and found that out. The useful ones like marsupial come well after empathy, herbivore and herd mentality, but then as soon as I took RadAway, ‚Äòcongrats you‚Äôve recovered from marsupial‚Äô...
---
My issues fast traveling are not at the initial load of the game. This happens during many points in a 2 or 3 hour play session, so sounds like two separate issues. I'm more than patient now upon loading because I used to have the pipboy glitch too. So I don't even move my toon until my camp is fully loaded, usually a few min after loading a world.
---
If you shut down ARIC-4 during the first stage, the defense targets do heal a bit between stages.
---
Is this art imitating life or life imitating art? Is the meta the only real? I do not know how far the rabbit hole goes but i know that at the end, is a cat video.
---
i usually sell them for 400 but we can work something out, im not sure i have all of them but I'll help with what i can
---
Sounds good. I‚Äôm going to be getting on shortly so I‚Äôll pull my ultracite laser out of storage and see if it wasn‚Äôt stealth patched or something and report back.
---
Every time. At least you get 3 steel.
---
We need more creepy camps- get out there and eat your heart out!
---
It would also help if our Perks affected stash space. I carry a ton of meds on me because of traveling pharmacist
---
Yeah, play that for pvp.
---
Finally somone proposing something decent!üëèüëèüôè
---
Took me 20 scrapped to get all the mods for it I just bought the plans in the end.
---
Todd: Lets take away some stash.
---
12 hours into my fifteenth rebuild of the same structure because of stairs and floors just getting completely fucked. Definitely some deranged frustrated giggling to maniacal cackling going on.
---
I have like 50 waste oil stashed already. I keep a bunch of it on hand because it's used for a lot of stuff and there are a few workshops with oil seeps that make it easy to collect a lot of it quickly.
---
don't waste your time getting less weight and carry more perks. work on perks that will give you a build for all weapons.
---
The power of the weapons is not the point.  It shows they do not care as much for the core game and just want to promote their pvp for whatever reason.  They think it will make them $$ but it will cost them more.
---
My ex girlfriends
---
Ah, so you're saying we need 8888?
---
I name all weapons xGARY \#. And all armor x GRACE \#
---
Happened to me yesterday for the 2nd time. Really not sure why its happening. My only guess is some bug with the updates (I believe the first time it happened was after the last update). Hoping this is something Bethesda is aware of and fixing. Refilling 4 machines is not fun
---
I usually sell mine in vending machine for 500 caps a piece, same price i get when i sell to vendors.
---
Price is negotiable so don't think it's set in stone.
---
Like bashing dmg on guns is useful lol
---
If they want people to buy it maybe they should actually put it in the damn store.
---
So you have no opinion on his videos at all? Besides the fact that you think Youtubers are serving their own interests which is true. This is a capitalist society we live in, unless you live outside the United States, so yes they are serving their own interests for profit or their own agenda, take your pick, my question was why do people not like his videos. So by replying to my question I assume you were attempting to answer the question.
---
I believe the vendor at the Whitespring station has most of the wall plans, if not all of them
---
I just pick the door and fast travel to my town and have one of my customers kill me
---
Wallace in Harper‚Äô Ferry has them
---
Yes but you can still buy items with the power off. The power only makes it so that you show up on the map, it doesn't completely turn it off. So the only other thing to do is lock the doors.
---
I think I got them from Wallace? Maybe try the Free States vendors.
---
I‚Äôll hit you up if I decide to go through with it!
---
"Item needs support" 
---
You're doing great.
---
Everything is fine
---
Your kids love you
---
What a lovely color palette you have.
---
WHY WONT YOU FUCKING PLAAAAACE!?
---
This has been a recreation of slightly more than half of all my building attempts.
---
Can you not reach the mute button on your high horse or something?
---
Even if it could only be used for vending that would be acceptable.
---
They're still putting it on the atom clock timer??  LOL glad I don't actually want topiaries. What kinda cultured Wastelanders do we have out there?
---
Lol you‚Äôre a pissy one ain‚Äôt you. You‚Äôve been making a fool of yourself plenty, might not want to insult the people who are giving logical answers to your question.
---
Could it be an issue with your firnds list, other people have reported having a lot of "friends" can cause the issue your talking about. I cannot confirm the list issue since I play on PC and never experienced either the firends list one or the pip boy one.
---
I just wish when it said there was a conflicting piece of some sort it would highlight it red or something so I can know what the fucking problem is.
---
You don't even need to suffer radiation at all to get mutations either, they are available via serums that you can pick and choose from.
---
Let's say you got something that you thought was valuable and decided to try to sell it at a high price. Because of dupers, the price of even the rarest items drops substantially. That is called inflation; the more of something there is and the easier it is to get, the lower it's value.
---
I actually laughed out loud at this
---
i just stopped hoarding... exept screws of course one can never can have enough of those
---
I think that's what the datamined mail boxes are for if they're not cosmetics only
---
Difference with RDO is its peer to peer vs fo76 dedicated servers. So in RDO its players telling other players what they are seeing/interacting with vs in fo76 its more dependent on how the server is handling the many interactions of the players with the npcs and world.  
---
When a server has been running a while, it will start chugging along and eventually crash but it usually has a several hour stability run before then.
---
Who hurt you guys lol
---
Online gambling.... idk wtf you‚Äôre talkin about. You don‚Äôt pay real life money for scrips so there is no ‚Äúonline gambling‚Äù aspect so there is no risk of getting sued. To be sued for online gambling they would need to allow us to pay money for scrips for a chance of winning a prize or more money back that has a resale value or a set worth in money. Bethesda does NOT sell scrips for money,  you do not receive more money or an item that is worth money. You could TRY to make a debate that cashing in scrips is ‚Äògambling‚Äô but there is no cost or risk or losing or gaining  money or items irl. An example of gambling would be:
---
Pay $20 to a website to open a package. When opened the site gives you x2 money back, nothing or gives you skin for your character that can be traded or sold for a lump sum to other players. 
---
Or like Star Wars bf2, pay money, receive random cards that effect gameplay. You are paying money IRL for a chance at goods. 
---
Players may make their own economy and trade items for cash IRL but bethesda has made tgis a bannable offense along with discouraging this. They are not responsible or have any part in this self made economy except to ban the users. 
---
In conclusion you arent spending money at all for scrips so you arent gambling.
---
I fight my friends all the time lately, but we never fight uninvolved people. Personally I never use pacifist. If I accidently shoot someone I didn't mean to, I throw up a heart and apologize over the mic. I have yet to have a single person use this as an invitation to mess me up. And if they do, well I should aim better.
---
Roving gangs of dicks absolutely exist, but I have to wonder why some people seem to find them in droves, and others never encounter them at all.
---
I know that's what I was pointing out- that's why they locked the doors.
---
Too much work for hardly any reward. An its temporary. Good try tho champ!
---
I share your pain with empath...I've been thinking about acquiring the empath serum and how much it would nerf the damage penalty and for how long with each serum dose.
---
Then the fix would be to unlock everything then make changes as you go. Floating turrets doesn't make the game unfun. Not being able to build a roof because the walls are "floating" is.
---
Nice upgrade
---
Lol did I hurt a Raiders feelz I thought you guys were tough. My mistake üòÇ
---
Nope. But it looks awesome with a beer hat.
---
I can't. I'm not a mod :(
---
Ironically that is what go fund me was supposed to be for. The founder would much rather there not be a ton of people begging for money just to not die. Not because he don't like them, he would just rather they not *need* to.
---
Get more rifleman perks and btw u have lvl 3 card with 20% more damage 
---
If u put 3 different lvl 1 
---
It‚Äôs 10+10+10=30 damage
---
Mine is all green and does absolutely nothing when you call her name "Mrs Kittypoops"
---
I would buy the shit out of them all
---
GT DrWattzo I‚Äôll help ya out!
---
near gilman lumber mill theres 2 little lakes with random animal spawns, sometimes beavers, frogs, cats, possums.
---
Nice story
---
My last character build, I just never visited them in Concord at all.
---
But, by that time, I was burnt out on the game entirely.
---
Yeah, once I hit the stash limit of 400 and had all these broken quests I just quit the game for several weeks until they raised it to 600.
---
I occasionally can't invite a friend to team, or it says we are teamed but we aren't, but I only have about 5 friends who play.
---
Ran into this and the only solution I could find was a scorched Earth camp replacement
---
move closer to whitesprings.   
---
if you are not loaded down (10+ ea weapons and armor or 30+ plans) most people will not travel across the map to check out your camp, benefit of finding something has to outweigh the 30-50 caps they have to spend to get there.. you see a ring around whitesprings of vendors (or any other town for that matter) get a spot in that ring and you will get more visitors and more sales.
---
You don‚Äôt have all three rifleman cards equipped?
---
I may have the leg plans, I can check when I get home.
---
Maybe just add 20% energy damage to the gun, as an alternative to explosive
---
Today I totally missed out on the alpha predator because I was sooo focused on keeping the last friendly animal alive. *sucks to be me*
---
also makes your animals attack
---
Let us acquire the heads first and then we can worry about the rest lol
---
Did you check all the vendors? They or one of the them should have the plans
---
Appreciate it
---
My guess is u had the raider on u when u completed belly of the beast, and just never noticed which was which and got rid of one
---
Also,glass should be used to store liquids like oil and acid, antiseptic, etc - not plastic.
---
Well some of the heads just fucking suck I want more than just a head
---
I believe hes random
---
Remember the situational cards like hard bargain, try switching to tenderizer, especially during events with high level enemies.
---
You get a set of Ultracite PA for free from a quest - sounds like to me that you lost your raider set without noticing and got the Ultracite and just assumed it was the Raider lol
---
I didn't notice this.. I just noticed and enjoyed not having an Assaultron up my a$$ when collecting venison and sludge
---
Muscle memory? Forgetfulness? The fact that the functionality changed?
---
Ap refresh Armour stacks, along with ap perks. My character has 390 ap, and regenerates 0-390 in under 3 seconds
---
Sometimes longer I just have to wait, network I guess.
---
Get in line, buddy. They still haven't given me the ability to wear [a beard with a handlebar mustache](https://preview.redd.it/mfja17x8k1j21.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98dca727b70d465c287e81e97d7a238f20cf607f).
---
I don‚Äôt have any problem killing them. On Xbox also.
---
If you're on xbox and have 25-30 units of oil I can craft the missing pieces for you. I have plenty of everything else.  GT is same as reddit name.
---
I also got mine from the Whitespring station!
---
TBH I haven't seen what your talking about. With weaponsmith or make shift warrior maxed. I got days without repairing weapons at all. Don't get hit in combat so my armor doesn't break. And if I'm in a boss fight (sbq, issue,free range, uraium fevor) I'm in PA with has a default breackage on it.
---
As so food spoilage, nope haven't see it. I make 20 soups right as I log in, play for 3 hours and still have 5-6 when I'm done for the day (speed demon).
---
I agree, one of my alts are Blackbeard himself who runs around with a broadsider and stuff.
---
But his beard is not mighty enough :(
---
Easy there teacup I was just kidding lol
---
farts were bad air.  I would be a plague bringer
---
shit, i have the oil, but i‚Äòm on pc. but thanks dude
---
I tried that
---
The radiation damage doesn‚Äôt, no. The base damage does.
---
I thought I did pretty thorough job checking, especially since the patch before last where so many more plans became readily available through the vendors. If anybody knows a particular vendor, please let me know.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1d11aff&amp;d=pp2pl2e60a00lv1lt2lu2l71sg0pd2pk2p00la2l11ic4ir2ce0ib1a72am2an2ao0a30au2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=12589cef a low health build that I use.  With unyielding armor and under 20% you get like 400 Action Points so you can crit for days.  I use an AAE Handmade but even a one star AA will one shot any supermutant any level.
---
So is Sentinal
---
Shoot. Good luck to you!
---
Im not 100% sure but I think i have several. Once in a while I come across these broken prosnap cameras that store in misc. If you are on ps4 I could give you one
---
So fucking true
---
Google says no. Reddit search says no. Please do those
---
It's more common than you know
---
This event is great, it is something this game needed badly, an event that many parties could form up and take on as a challenge. This is not solo content, nor is it a solo game. It's a good thing.
---
But the base damage was the same on the bloodied as the instagating
---
Yep I find myself getting absolutely destroyed. I already don‚Äôt have a defense build, so stack that with empathy and it‚Äôs hard to not get one or two shot by high level enemies
---
Apparently.
---
The game is growing and it makes sense to increase limit. When was it increased last time? 5 months ago?
---
Yes actually I did lol i wouldn't have survived my encounter without his help lol
---
Bash them to death with the Syringer
---
$59.99 on Bethesda's digital store page and PSN.
---
Free range?? The bosses are almost always 1-star, not at all guaranteed 3-star like the other events you mentioned.
---
To each their own opinion.
---
To.me if you "invest" your time playing the game to get legendaries to break down for script to pay a didgital slot machine for a CHANCE of good loot. That is gambling pure and simple. Might not be your definition. But it is mine and lawyers all over the world.
---
But to each their own. Good luck
---
Use the bleed out mod for it.  Did the same thing used it as a final blow
---
Seconded.
---
Yeah, games should be about choices - and really, that's not much of a choice. I can't imagine playing without those.
---
Bring it's health down and finish it off by bashing with the syringer
---
hadn't thought of that, I'm not a melee build, but it has to be better damage then shooting. Thanks
---
I have no idea if it was pure chance or triggered by what I did, but when I was trying to get the wing for the entomologist badge, I went to Point Pleasant and harvested all the eggs at the foot of the statue. Fast traveled back to my base in the Savage Divide and was immediately attacked by a Vengeful Mothman. If it was RNGeezus, the odds were certainly in my favor that day.
---
Shoot or hit it with your normal weapon until the health is very low, then use a stringer with a bleed out mod to finally kill it.
---
That is fantastic info. Thanks!
---
Dude... sorry this happened to you.
---
Fyi, I've seen several posts from players who barrowed an excavator set to register who then later dont receive the plans and can never build an upgraded lvl set.
---
I
---
we are gonna launch tonight most likely
---
You equipped it? Bloodied doesn‚Äôt show until equipped. It worked the last time I tested in a few patches ago
---
lol nothing is perfect so just do nothing kek
---
If it was luck than that is sad because it is his eggs and when u steal them u get a higher chance of him attacking
---
Yup. Happens to me every camp i visit has to load in small chunks. I end up seeing every wall and item load in and i have been inside camps houses and under them stuck. Also when i load in my camp when i start the game i wait like a whole 30+ seconds for my camp to load in chunks.
---
Just shoot it down and then run up and bash the last bit
---
Also there is a level 26ish one at battlefield cemetary. Went to that one after it got annoying trying to kill high level one at site alpha.
---
You‚Äôre a champion! üòÇüëçüèΩ
---
Is that the place with the mounted kitty faces all over the walls? Crazy psycho kitty murdering lady, more like.
---
Isn‚Äôt that kinda gated by your ability to access the Whitesprings Bunker? I assumed that was an endgame thing.
---
Just make stash space account wide so I dont have to do so much trading back and forth to alts.
---
i already learned the plans from the terminal and crafted 4 pieces, as written above. that won‚Äòt be a problem anymore. but that‚Äòs also why i‚Äòve wasted all the black titanium and screws i had left. and seriously, my character weight and stashe are EXPLODING üò´
---
Could it be the influx of players because of the new dlc maybe?
---
get disconnected every 30 minutes
---
FIX THE F\*\*\*\*\* SERVERS DAMMIT
---
I spent untold hours and sixty dollars on this game
---
and I am about to rage quit  with the dammed server disconnects and the   constant   attacks from mole rats and  shit every Five dammed minutes  when building in camp
---
You are 100% correct.  It kills me to do it, but I'm just leaving stuff if I can't immediately give it to somebody.  I've made my stash as efficient as possible, churn as much ammo as I can, and beyond that of a day (20 hours anyway) everything just gets left on the ground.
---
And no, I don't want an alt.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland. Some of the holotapes are pretty good too. Glad you're enjoying it!
---
that's a really good idea, I've  never thought about that...
---
or someone else's heart out
---
I‚Äôm not expecting handouts nor do I want them. This is bullshit. You‚Äôre telling me they don‚Äôt have backups of anything? Plus, if I got hacked, why did they leave my stash alone or fuck with my camp in any way?
---
Damn. That was a roller coaster from start to finish and I wanna get back in line. Lol
---
YOU CAME BACK!  WE MISSED YOU!!!!  FOOD BUILDS FOREVER!!!
---
If you're on PC I've got all the plans - legs, arms, torso, plus a ton of mod plans like deep pocketed, shadowed, etc. Raider stuff sells like hotcakes, but I just this morning dropped the price on robot plan because no one has been buying them and I keep accumulating more.
---
If you want to farm them yourself, I got most of them from Blackwater Mine or the street of raider shops behind Pleasant Valley.
---
Thanks all, I'll try bashing, maybe the lower level one, I don't have the bleed out mod
---
Ooo, I want this.
---
The can't invite ( do to either not onli3n or in main menu) I have seen since patch 9.
---
The "he's on my teem but does not show on screen" but does show in the social menu. Also seen since patch 9.
---
No the friend list issue is from back by patch 6 ish.
---
Issue. If you hadore than 100 friend in your list you got random lag every few minutes. This was supposed to be fixed in pach 7 or 8, but the work around was to remove people from the firends list ( less than 100). Like I said I have never experienced it andy friends list only started growing since 8.5 when I started running nukes daily
---
That and the Place Everywhere mod have spoiled me.
---
I dont know I've been getting really rare crashes lately on 76 so that makes me happy, I feel on Red Dead though I'll get a disconnect every 30 minutes now
---
Holy cow! That's long, if anything I start the game and let it load in while I grab a beer
---
Maybe that was it... I'm not sure now that you mention that
---
Someone said orbital strike can destroy a camp. Try it next time.
---
Sorry should have mentioned that. I‚Äôm on PS4, level 54..
---
Well, since the bullshit you're spouting literally CANNOT be the case, you're certainly not going to tell us, are you?
---
So that gives you a right to be a dick? 
---
What about the non-douchebag players your'e screwing over by doing this.
---
This makes you an even bigger ass than the douchebags your'e complaining about in my book.
---
Fucking bullshit. Ive lost a lot to the game eating my shit but never EVERYTHING... I cant beleive they wont set you back up with What you lost ...
---
Gt Isofree
---
What quest???
---
I don't have the bloodied anymore to check, but I do know for sure gunslinger doesn't work on it
---
Damn. I‚Äôm on Xbox or I would have given you a nice handmade rifle.
---
Recovering Hoarder here.  I had (have) the same problem with keeping everything, and have come up with a pretty good system for staying clean(er).  Don't curb your desire to collect everything, try and alter what you actually keep.  Scrap and bulk sell items to vendors (Hard Bargain + Grape Mentats to maximize your profits).  Evaluate what you are holding onto and identify items that are particularly hard to get again if you choose to part ways.  I've probably got dozens of pounds of cosmetic clothes, for example, that I can't bring myself to get rid of on the off chance I want to dress up like a serial killer clown and stalk newbie from the Vault with Chameleon armor.  But clothes only take up .1 pound each, so it's not as bad as holding onto that Missile Launcher I will probably never ever use.
---
**Junk**
---
Limit the amount of junk items in your stash.  No more than 5 bulked of any one item.  For anything that won't bulk, keep it at 50.  If you are collecting certain junk to make specific items that's a different story, but if you are trying to keep yourself stocked for unknown future crafts or mods, 5 and 50 seems sane.  Only exception for that is Ballistic Fiber and Screws, hoard as much of that as you can.
---
**Drugs**
---
I'm not a chem user but like to think that I might use them at some point in the future for emergencies, so I keep 5 or less per chem.  Exceptions are rad away, rad x, and stimpacks (\~30 of each). 
---
**Weapons**
---
Don't hold onto a weapon thinking "this might be fun to use someday".  If you pick up something, use it immediately.  If it doesn't fit your play style, scrap or sell it.  Exceptions are god roll Legendaries, either save them and alter your build to suit it or save it for an alternate.  Scrap weaker legendaries in the train station recyclers for scrip or sell them to other players.  If they don't sell in a few days, scrap 'em.  Once you've unlocked all possible mods for a weapon from scrapping, sell them to vendors.  You can hit your 1400 daily cap income pretty easily from just gunning down Super Mutants and selling off their weapons.
---
**Backpack**
---
Make it a priority to finish the Tadpole Scouts quests (Archery, Swimming and Athletics seem to be the go tos) and get a backpack as soon as you can.
---
**Strength**
---
Invest in Strength even if it Heavy Weapons or Melee aren't your deal.  At least 10, maybe 12 points in Strength to increase carry weight.
---
**Food**
---
Invest in Can Do and search every trash can you see, you'll be swimming in non-perishable food.  And Canned Coffee is amazing, just pop a can of dried grounds and keep on running.  Sell off everything else you get from hunting and gathering.  Don't resist the urge to pick it up, resist the urge to keep it in your inventory.  Cook dishes off and sell them to vendors, limit water to 10 purified at a time per outing.
---
lmfao, love the mood.
---
Don't it since there a limit per server and it also happens on every C.A.M.P I fast travel to
---
Thanks anyway. I did finally get a (non-legendary) hand made. In fact today. Planning to go look for some mods for it soon.
---
Alright so I did it and need to buy Talons,Grounded,Twisted Muscles,Adrenal, And Egg head
---
No respectable lawyer is going to look at scrip as gambling. I think you need to actually talk to a real lawyer before you make stuff up.
---

I have time to load a hotdog in the microwave and pee. Then i come back to either  beavers, house cats, possums or a fox getting filleted by my turrets. Lol
---
That's awesome! I'll message you now
---
to quote team america. yeah dicks fuck pussies. but they also fuck assholes.
---
"Online interactions not rated by the ESRB." &lt;- I think this works both ways, though I'm 100% not sure!
---
Crap. I need to edit. PS4. Thank you though. :)
---
Thanks for the tip. I had tried Willards for server hopping before. Maybe I‚Äôll give the tea pot a shot.
---
Tool limitations is their excuse
---
Go to the philipi cemetery parking lot theres generally a lower lvl one there. I used an off hand weapon to get it close to death then finished it off. Bashing works i got lucky and my last shot before i ran out of ammo got him. Now if only that counted towards the chemist challenge. Good luck
---
Yea. Same here. I guess I Just assumed it was my xbox being slow or the server being loaded
---
Works for me buddy
---
I wait to see what the prize is ive gotten ammo before. Then i shoot them.
---
One spawns on the roof of the salon in Berkeley.
---
Yea... Well... They are tools if they can't restore lost items imho. Sorry thia happen to ya.
---
Where do you see total AP?
---
Also, how many pieces of armor do you use with AP refresh?
---
Lastly, what perks?
---
What uh...what console you on there, tough guy?
---
It's happened to me twice in ps4 but the other three times I've been able to complete it. I have found staying towards the catwalks/middle of the labs area keeps me from crashing during the event.
---
Not in vending. Most of those are sold extremely quickly (under 30 minutes of posting) on trading subs. Dupers don't hold on to stock long considering Bethesda last response.
---
Like with the rest of these new quests, there's way too much shit going on and it's not at all clear what to do until you've tried it a few times.
---
I name my weapons after metal songs, much like I did with my ships in EVE. So far I have two .50 Cal machine guns, one called "Redneck" and the other is "Refuse/Resist." My gatling laser is aptly named "Laser Cannon Deth Sentence." Gatling Gun is "Sons of Thunder." I have an LMG named "Shake Your Blood." Deathclaw gauntlet is "Knuckleduster." Fire Axe is "My Name is Murder."

Man this doesn‚Äôt make sense to me what you‚Äôre saying. That‚Äôs like saying if you change a Two-shot hunting rifle to a 50cal bullet it‚Äôll only shoot 1 bullet because you received the item with it shooting 2 308‚Äôs.
---
this needs stickied for a week or so...
---
what does that matter?
---
I had a trio of them chase me from a little NW of Fissure Site Prime to Watoga Station..
---
No shit.  Bulking should lower weight of everything. Current iteration is total garbage.
---
Platform and tag? I want to see. :)
---
omg have one person throw on the plague doctor mask with a black fedora and another with the white wolf fedora and you have spy vs spy

It matters to me, guy.

Cool story.

Then I get on the mic questioning their methods &amp; they give me a ‚Äústop whining‚Äù or a ‚Äúmaybe you should do more.‚Äù My main problem I‚Äôm running into is people sprinting to the alpha instead of helping me defend the animal... like we had one wolf it‚Äôs already a pretty squishy creature but when I‚Äôm the only one shooting the Yao guai‚Äôs &amp; the cave crickets there‚Äôs only so much a man can do. If they never nerfed explosive weapons then it‚Äôd be easy to solo but you need more people defending than attacking the shit 1-2 star man.
---
I had read that today and went there. I looked all over the roofs over the Salon. There weren‚Äôt many foes running around so I‚Äôm thinking maybe someone had already grabbed it. Didn‚Äôt take time to server hop it.
---
It has drops tho
---
It could go up to 3000 I would still be over encumbered
---
This is good to know.  Thanks for the advice.  I have had to protect a friendly creature as it wandered all the way over to the elevator, where it started to get beat down by a gutsy and assaultron.  
---
I guess "get your shots" on the alpha and keep an eye on your critter's health is a good strategy.
---
I wish we had at least 2x as much time to fill up the feeding units.  5 minutes is enough to get maybe two to lvl 3, even with coordination of a strong 4 person team that's communicating with each other.  It seems like many people have no idea what to do during this phase, and they just run around shooting at anything that moves.
---
He‚Äôs saying they should make a quest so it isn‚Äôt a shitty regular weapon like the Sheepsquatch club, staff and crook
---
try scan and repair, maybe?
---
oh okay.
---
I have already stated my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs on a shelf inside the hut on the roof.
---
Pretty sure the enclave vendors sell them randomly. Production wing
---
Lol you‚Äôre just as bad as the shitty‚Äôs that litter the event, congrats on failureü§°ü§°
---
The club isn‚Äôt that bad but that‚Äôs because it has upgrades
---
Is this the first time a CM has seen this? I feel like it's been a common occurrence in the sub for awhile now.
---
Two shot rocket launcher called Poor Man‚Äôs TSE.
---
To roll in? I don‚Äôt know either
---
My 3* Instigating Fire Axe is named Stormbreaker.
---
I've seen mirelurk Queens wipe the floor with scorchbeast on more than one occasion and they definitely saved my rear end when I was in my low thirties once, also in the mire. One of my favorite pics in the game.
---
So?
---
He‚Äôs a clown he won‚Äôt post his ign or console trust me. It‚Äôs the internet warrior stage of his life (12-16)
---
PS4 but hopefully not too much longer ;)
---
Nope, should just effect carry weight and melee dmg.
---
...but the crate of Cram tho
---
Gt Isofree always happy to help
---
Melee VATS is bugged and doesn't work on flying things right now. Kill something, grab their gun, and use it to kill the firefly.
---
That said, I completed the challenge a little bit ago and had no problem killing them.
---
i remeber when i tried to bump myself off for someone but i have healing factor and the only way i could do it was grenades. All i had on me were frags and plasma grenades and the plasmas one-hit me cause i wasn't in my power armour. it took around 7 frags to finally kill me...
---
Joke or the guy is misinformed. It‚Äôs not true.
---
EXCLACTLY STRCKHU DJOVJWINS FUEPWOWKDNFJFOE SNJCOENW
---
You definitely stated your opinion but it didn't pertain to my original question.
---
Hey, game told me to collect a wing. He's not going to part with one willingly, and I'm not gonna get that sweet, sweet tadpole badge without it. There was really only one way that situation would work itself out over time. Better sooner rather than later, and better I get it from one mothman than going on a killing spree like I am to get the five deathclaw pelts to scrap or the foxes I had to kill for jerky, or the rabbits I had to slaughter...just because.
---
I fInd them funny in a gotcha kind of way. I see a big number and initially think "oooo something good to spend my caps on."
---
Un-equip the Perk Card for Mysterious Stranger first?    
---
Fun fact about syringers, you can scrap them and learn different poison barrels to use with it (along with sights and stocks). The best one for damage unfortunately takes a nearly unattainable 10 Radscorpion Stingers to craft, but does a good bit of damage. (Check mutant meat bags for stingers, as well as hunting them in Toxic Valley)  
---
(The stingers auto-scrap when you use that function on your junk. Trying to collect 10 and KEEP them til you craft the syringer has so far eluded my tiny brain's capacity to "not hit the button").   
---
For this quest, you only need to strike finishing shot with syringer, can (Must?) do most of the damage with something else, or even have teammate assistance... Just be careful around other mobs. I had my kill stolen by local bugs on 2 occasions...
---
Yes I melee him the second I hear him start talking, he always shows up at the worst time
---
market76 and fo76bazaar are both active (can't link or automod will remove).
---
It is an item alternative to that perk card
---
Campe Diem
---
Youre talking to people who play a video game looking for challenges and you just hand one over to them like that? Man I was never interested in that workshop until now!
---
This is an almost pointless reply, I apologise advance.
---
My frogs are screeching sounds like something I should say after cycling home from work.
---
That's right next to my camp!
---
I want your weapon, I've been looking for that exact one....are you on PS4 and willing to sell?  BTW awesome name
---
The food tip is awesome I was super turned off when I made a bunch of food, logged off, then came back to it all spoiled. The ‚ÄúI might use this one day‚Äù mentality fkin kills me to go against though but still thanks. I didn‚Äôt realize there‚Äôs a daily cap limit either that seems kinda rough.
---
Hey, no one cares that your wasting your own time trying to get back at a select few of people. Odds are you wont effect them or a single reddit user, and even if u do they probably won't care enough to make a post complaining about it like u did.
---
Dude i dont care about your pc problems honestly.
---
What your karma is. It's an indicator of how helpful (or not) your statements are. Apparently, not very.
---
C A N N I B A L   C A M P!
---
Yep, picked up a level 6 toddler last night. When she found a drill I yelled, ‚Äúoh sh%# keep it. I need to kill a squirrel with it.‚Äù You could see her puzzled look from the other side of the country.
---
I'd love that but if servers are gonna be even more unstable then i'll rather keep the 800
---
Since they take a while to load, run or jump away from the camp. It gives you a chance to not get stuck.
---
Not mess around for 120 levels to get my character build right.
---
I told my wife (Lvl 19) she should check out the Wendigo Cave to get mine.
---
Yeah the kids these days don't realize how hard it was on us!
---
*Reels in a mirelirk queen*
---
There is. They already had it where you they wouldn't scrap when you scrap all, but it made it so that the bulk items couldn't be auto-scrapped when you crafted something that required the bulk materials. So if you bulk all of your lead for instance, you couldn't make ammo from it unless you manually scrapped the bulk lead. Bulk Mats are the only things that have a need to be auto-scrapped and not auto-scrapped depending on the circumstance, so they picked the lesser of two evils in their eyes. I believe they stated that they needed to rework the system in order to allow both to occur and it seems they still haven't gotten around to it.
---
Personally, I'm fine with the current implementation over the alternative right now as I'd rather just remember to not hold onto to bulk items rather then having to manually de-bulk them.
---
Lmk when I can play caravan at my camp
---
I do now. But sometimes I will do that and it snaps me back where i loaded in and this, stuck under a house lol.
---
There you are!   Where have you been this whole time?   Been waiting for the Stash Scolder since the moment I posted this.  Welcome to the party... you‚Äôre late.
---
Might hit you up when I get back next week. I have two cards and keep getting code pieces then let them expire.
---
to quote myself: shut up nerd
---
What was the question you would like answered?
---
THERE SHE BLOWS!!!
---
Yeah I do that but there's those time when I'm on my phone and when I look it it's to late all I can do then is cry and fast ravel to nearest location
---
Bloody mess
---
I‚Äôm in Florida.  I‚Äôll trade that for my more roaches than rats and squirrels combined- even toss in those nasty huge hissing cockroaches we e been getting lately.  Those are real fun.
---
The broken ones can only be fixed into working ones if you already have the working one plan.
---
Every.  
---
Single.   
---
Time.
---
I still had it in my stash, bloodied still works ;)
---
Yeah lol good luck buddy
---
Last patch hosed up camps badly.  If they don‚Äôt hotfix this, then they‚Äôll never hotfix anything ever.
---
I've played plenty of games on console and used text chat. It is a pain to have a keyboard on consoles but it can be done as consoles do have usb ports.
---
I‚Äôm curious. Are you in power armor?
---
I love it because of how easy it is. Fast travel to Vault 76 for free, fast travel to grafton station for 6 caps, and a short walk to the event.
---
I may be biased because my camp also isn't that far from it, it's basically free caps everyday
---
Lol, okay. I haven‚Äôt had the snap back happen to me in camps yet, but I know what you mean.
---
Do we know when and how much the topiary are coming back (for the first time) to the Atom store?  I'd probably buy the cat one if nothing else.
---
Because that's the offered button. Could honestly be controller button limitations. Consoles always bringing down PC
---
Don't worry you're fine xD
---
This list of possible 3rd stars I'd take is longer than the 2\* effects-
---
\+1 Perception
---
15% faster reload
---
25% less VATS Action Point cost
---
250 damage resistance while reloading
---
90% reduced weight
---
Your VATS critical meter fills 15% faster
---
vs only 4 desirable (for me) 2nd star effects:
---
25% increased fire rate
---
Bullets explode for area damage at 20% base effect
---
\+33% VATS hit chance
---
Oh I love that bit, whenever I'm in that area at night I make a little detour to the church and listen to the creepy music!
---
It happens sometimes. If i want it to happen for sure ill visit the whitesprings. Lol
---
Mine often changes but right now I'm after a TSE Assault Rifle with +33% VATS
---
They probably want out of that tiny jar u monster.
---
But sometimes my own shitty internet makes me DC :( bad game 2/10
---
Bloodied, +50 limb dmg, and +1P Laser rifle. Been hunting for that beauty for a good while, instead I get 1* wood üòÇ
---
My water consumption went through the roof the previous patch.  Could this have been what is causing the sudden water consumption rate increase?  The rate is double that of food.  I'll be dehydrated and still have half the food bar still full.
---
Yeah i get that but it's not like that's a problem that's not fixable with very little effort
---
Oh boy, that might be my Goddess roll...
---
People need to RTFQ objectives.  It'll get better.  It's just like the Sheepsquatch event, eventually the idiots will catch on.
---
LFG Posiden Energy! Can pay with free Brahmin milk if I can ever get any!
---
All I'm saying is refresh everything 5-10 hours instead of 20.  People would come back more often.
---
Oh thats just the frog succumbing to starvation because they where shoved into a tiny jar and left to die
---
I always dumb the ore after quest because it's useless. The cost of acid to smelt those ore is too damn high and you can't sell ore :/
---
If I'm correct TSE no longer drop together, might have to buy that one haha
---
Cool, I'm using the anti armor now.. saw a assassin's with limb damage for sall the other day but the guy didnt reply. That's the one I'd want
---
Kill them. You only have one target at a time, so it's likely that who you're hunting is hunting someone else. And someone else is hunting you.
---
Normal PvP rules don't apply (unless you're on a Survival server), which means you have to be on your guard or instead of being the hunter, you are the hunted.
---
Shame, I sell fusion cores for 50/each and plasma cores for 25 but I'm on PC
---
Got a TSE Bolt-Action Pipe yesterday off Murhmgh so they deff do
---
Room full of desks in Military Wing of Enclave, The tents outside and interior rooms at Monongah and Thunder Mountain Power Plants..., the big brick building at Satellite Array has a lot of fans... get the Hot Plates too. :)   
---
Sugar Grove gets picked over sometimes.
---
You can disable the robots as well, there are a couple steps to it but its not too awful. Punch pad door (code is 970930 which is fallout 1s release date i believe)  there is a terminal within that you get a shutdown code from and you use that shutdown code on the main comp where you initiate the event and that shuts down the robots. Pretty sure you have to wait to do this until after the event is initiated.
---
That's actually pretty cool.
---
Kinda confusing how I wrote it but I meant any player can unlock my door cuz it's lvl 0 lock, I just don't want mobs in. Also if you have marsupial you can jump right in cuz I have no roof lol. If another player fucks with my stuff then oh well, it basically never happens or never to me at least.
---
No, those are the plans for the serums. You can buy serums in many, many camps for cheap caps these days.
---
Regarding friendly creature approaching an exploding legendary.  That just sucks, that's not really a bug though.
---
My problem is that if they do make it1000 then people are going to ask for more and more they did it with 600 and now 800
---
You on PC?  I'd love to have you around for at least one helping hand.
---
I think part of the problem is educated players willing to do the actual nuts-n-bolts mechanics of the event and allowing the majority of the participants to just buzz around like moths until the three star green flame appears.  
---
To this day I still join Encryptid and see xIeatASS69x standing there with his explosive gatling unloading into the Impostor when it can't be damaged yet.
---
I don't because occasionally he gives me 100 cloth (pre war money) but I always shoot him afterwards to put him out of his misery
---
Running junkies currently with a junkies gauss rifle.. been one shoting super mutants and other things with it ..running 5 addictions
---
Instigating /  +33% VATS hit chance / 25% less VATS action point cost Lever Action. Maybe not a "God Roll," but it's what I'm looking for. Also, an Instigating / Swing Speed / +STR Fire Axe.
---
yeah the founding fathers meant it literally you as a citizen can have bear arms
---
This.  Fucking this.    
---
Why the hell should something your moving not want to intersect it‚Äôs old self?
---
The absolute most garbage programming I‚Äôve ever dealt with.
---
Lazy.  Let‚Äôs just copy paste things but not delete until it‚Äôs done ?  Seriously.
---
This having to remove, lay down far away, grab in just the right place, the. Play virtual limbo half blind to figure out if it‚Äôs just perfect only to have to redo the process twenty times is getting real damn old.
---
Aye I would if I could. I have a huge waterfall/pond they could roam around in freely.
---
Though you're not entirely wrong about the monster part... One is my beloved pet and stays inside with me while the other is destined to spend the rest of his little froggy life being neglected on the self of my store.
---
The ore is the whole reason I did the event lol.
---
Good idea I just have it set next to my machine. My camp is pretty basic and that's part of the problem with the mobs, but the locked door has helped tremendously.
---
been there. dont be too flustered. i ran arktos a bunch yesterday, after fighting and killing a level 100 3star alpha sheepsquatch for the first time i got a 1star stalkers board. we all take it without lube some days.
---
Guys, I‚Äôm tired and not feeling to great today. This has not been more evident then when I read this post title  as Dear Bethesda, more bread!
---
Ah I see
---
Yeah Vendors have a shared cap pool of 1400 you can get from selling them things.  It used to be way worse, only 200 per faction and all the vendors were spread across the map.  Now they are all at Whitesprings in addition to train stations and other world locations and they share a single, large pool.
---
As for food spoilage, the Good with Salt perk does decrease it dramatically.  Especially good for nuke runs and gathering flux.
---
Thanks! I had a lot of fun putting it together (over and over again thanks to the bug when you move your CAMP) üòâ
---
Don't buy too many plasma cores...those things last forever.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôll let you trade the camera. Tried it on a spare with a buddy and it counted as a quest item. I already finished the quest too
---
It‚Äôs a lot of game for ten squids! Bargain!
---
Or just dont hoard things you don't need. I've never even come close to the stash limit in 250+ hours
---
Non vats ranged it‚Äôs usually better for ego go 2 star as the third doesn‚Äôt really offer much.
---
That was a struggle for sure. Damn kids these days lol
---
I was able to play in there a bunch yesterday and once earlier today. Tried a little later today and each time I crashed. I tried about 7-8 times and game just crashed and went to the Xbox home screen. Gave up now, and I know it‚Äôs not just me, 2 other people I played with (different times) had the same thing happen to them
---
Very cool!
---
Market76
---
What platform? I'd buy it.
---
Bloody, Swing speed, +1 Strength Shovel
---
The board games would be awesome!
---
The only way I can think of it being implemented would be to have a single piece of furniture, with a table and a set number of seats, that is dedicated to one or more board games. That would make sure that associated character animations wouldn't be impacted by an out of place chair. Stools would be better than chairs to avoid clipping issues with backpacks...
---
See total AP in the Stats screen in PipBoy
---
I dont think it disproves it that he is joking based on the other prices...why cant we joke and also make money?  
---
I also did with this with salt, put it at max caps.  I don't really think anyone is gonna buy it (if they did I'd fix it).   Then again I'm not using my vendor to make caps, I put free supplies in it so peeps can use it as a free refill station.
---
I‚Äôm good for it
---
No idea how good it be, but a tse quad Tesla rifle. (To be honestly any quad Tesla that's not got one enemy class damage boost would be great in general)
---
40% swing speed, furious, +1 strength
---
A workaround that worked for me was to travel to the nearby location Greg‚Äôs mine supply and walk up the hill instead of fast traveling to Arktos or joining the event directly and I was able to go down the elevator
---
It‚Äôs a major slip up if it truly is on Bethesda. I‚Äôd be curious to know what they‚Äôve done (if anything) to rule their responsibility in these issues out.
---
If I see a mule near whitesprings station walk a molerat over and let them eat the afk player because they are usually sitting out in the open. I had one guy die and not respawn and eventually the game timed him out.
---
I‚Äôm heavy weapons and got a 2* anti bot explosive harpoon gun.
---
I thought it‚Äôd be a joke weapon, but put a flechette mod I had laying around on it and started some crap at ws...holy shit it was epic.
---
I take down those nuke card flying convoys no problem, clear bots anywhere anytime.  
---
It‚Äôs become a standard carry now, esp since ammo regenerates to the point that I discard bulk of it constantly.
---
I think they make pills for the wood thing man.  Stay strong brother.
---
Free trip to the Mire to join the Enclave at level 2?  Sign me right the fuck up.
---
your rng is pretty dismal
---
Already tested! That won't work, but i always keep some "just in case".
---
Quad explosive 10mm pistol with the reduced vats cost effect
---
can a repaired one be give away? do does it destroy upon dropping like a backpack?
---
Ah, yeah I've heard you can by them from her. Thought you were referring to off enemies
---
How about: Ash's Pride
---
(Ash from Army of Darkness, Pride for Pride Parade for the flaming part)
---
The enclave science vendor has both. The serums are \~3800, while the recipes are \~18000.
---
I've bought four recipes at full price so far. Doesn't take that long now that it's so easy to make the 1400 caps per day, and people buy stuff from your machine.
---
You don't watch Juicehead's videos and have no opinion on them anyway so it's a moot point.
---
No, just the one camera. Maybe I'll try scrapping it and making a new one? Worth a shot!
---
RIP Mr. Whiskers. You were my brave door guardian while I had you.
---
plauge doctor mask is NOT a gas mask (at rhis time)
---
Cant have quad and two shot on the same legendary
---
Were you anywhere near the Responder airport base?  If so, there's one that's always around there.  First time there as a player it scared the crap out of me as I was like 15, until I realized it was non hostile.
---
Joined in on one of those after the event was done.  Had a level 182 who kept trying to facetank it and kept getting one shot.  Not even a bloodied build either.
---
Yep, you totally can take photos of dead things. Unfortunately I've tried all of these dead and alive to no avail :(
---
I had 11 two days ago and now I only have like 2, so for me they do not last forever. My Cores only count for 250 rounds, not 500 like some are getting with specific perk cards.
---
cosigned
---
Modded to auto?
---
üò¢üò≠
---
 I bought Plague Rider with my accumulated Atoms. ;)
---
You didn‚Äôt actually have a question to answer did you. Have a lovely evening.
---
Remember when White Knight stopped you from needing Ballistic Fiber for armor repairs?  My broken armor remembers...
---
what we should get is 5 set of challenges with 3 challenges each - solo / team / photo / crafting / event - and be able to complete a number of them - lets say 7 (one per day) - this would give us the same number of atoms but let us have a larger selection of things we can do
---
Every dlc should have came with a soft 25-50 pounds of more stash space. Keep the base amount at 800 and let the dlc speak for the need of more.
---
r/Market76
---
If you struggle with stash weight at this point, you are definitely hoarding and 1000 stash weight won't be good enough for you eventually.
---
I do have a spare set... it would have been smart of me to ask what system.
---
Did you get the action hero one that was the survival reward a month back? I had a 1* 2 shot for a while, then got the action hero; a 3* 2 shot, faster fire rate, faster reload speed .50 cal. It absolutely shreds.
---
Between trying to gather resources to put in the troughs and defending the creature largely without help, I can't see having any extra time to initiate this step.
---
Explosive or non? Do you have a standard rifleman build?
---
Vampiric Executioner SS Machete
---
Well I must admit it was a little bit of both. Last two were just too good to pass up. And im a sucker for a set.
---
Non explosive and a full rifle built yes
---
I had 120 of the 250, perked as a rifleman got a decent plasma Gatling  so I thought I'd burn them up...a week later, at least 3 hours a day and I'm still over 80 cores.
---
Yea its easier with a large coordinated group, which is kinda why i posted this, because too many people just ran right in and started the event in the first minute of it being active.
---
I was hoping the "automated alerts" on the terminal would do this.
---
3 words: Fast travel mats. We really need them. There was a poor guy that fast traveled to my camp to  hopefully buy stuff and got stuck in my foundation. At the time i managed to remove the floor he already traveled away again.
---
True, I max out on caps in one hour flat every morning...don't care about legendary meca movement so for me it's an hour a day, with occasionally hopping on to Hussle for more bobbys.
---
Are you using a beam focuser?
---
You sell frequently because your screwing yourself and attempting to bottom out the economy, but your actually providing other sellers with cheap goods, aka your the aliexpress of fo.
---
Goj on that. In just a few months you‚Äôll have made just as much as a normal seller does in one day.
---
Och thas a kilt naught a skirt!
---
Check all the vendors at Whitesprings. I‚Äôm sure I saw it there.
---
Holy balls how do you have 390!?
---
I just gotta say in hindsight love how the backpack looks like a paper bag in the picture.
---
The real test vault 76 was running was to see if traps are gay
---
Tip:
---
Place your power armor and enter it. It'll pull you out of what your clipping with.
---
Can USUALLY find an angle to place it down. (Not always.)
---
Yes it would have. I responded to you before I realized I hadn‚Äôt mention what system I‚Äôm on. I have since amended that. PS4 here. If you‚Äôre on the same platform I‚Äôd like to buy them.
---
Nope. I‚Äôd keep it single shot. I‚Äôm a pistol vats build so that with gun-fu and all my ap/crit regen perks would just decimate any swarms I ran in to.
---
Still, never heard about it being taken off loot tables.
---
I don't know why they implement these new weapons in game and they can't drop legendary lmao. It's actually silly.
---
No, more like for player capacity.
---
im trying to find those magazines lol i even grab the perk to help me find them, that's my goals lately visiting towns loot plastic.... sbq? sorry but i need to find the source of this noise first xd
---
I must have missed that one. I don‚Äôt think I got white Knight til way later. I do remember letting my armor break and then just building a new piece without ballistic fiber. I was such a cheap ass lol
---
That‚Äôs what I use. But it‚Äôs not for sale
---
Xbox sorry and good luck.
---
 Every time. Without hesitation.
---
gotta get that 76 challenge xd
---
Maybe one day we will get a legendary version of some of these items I mean the did add the armor and the pipe revolver in the legendary vendor.
---
May have been me : (
---
K. Thanks though
---
You can choose to leave the event (and thus the auto-group anti-friendly Fire) from the pip-boy. So it‚Äôs entirely possible to get in a firefight in an event on survival. People used to do that if they found people not in passive during Queen fights,
---
Due to the fact they did nothing original from Fallout 4, the games wheel involves heavy loot management.
---
They did not consider this when they limited the stash.  The limit was because thats how much info can be handled by the servers at a given time.
---
People then started duping and also using secondary accounts, so even though they managed to increase it over time, it‚Äôs basically like using a bucket to get the water out of a sunken ship at this point.
---
The solution would be separate independent stashes.  Right now nothing stops people from making more characters and filling that stash, so the solution would be allow for a creation of a Stash Box #2.  Not only would people be less likely to flood more toons and take some server stress off from logins, you should only need to attach Player2 Box to Player1, not a full shared stash (your gerbils would explode) but just access to alternate stashes.  
---
Its the same effort of loading your own stash and it wont change the fact people mule all the time now.
---
Don‚Äôt use bags maybe?  
---
I find a dr bag, suitcase, desk, whatever and make sure the other guys in it at the same time to transfer shit.
---
Very very rarely is there an issue this wY and things don‚Äôt disappear.
---
just make materials weightless
---
Well rested, well tuned.
---
Yeah, now I just sneak and run for my life if I get detected because I hardly find ballistic scrap and everyone selling it wants at least 10c per 1.
---
i have adrenal, grounded, twisted muscles, join my world
---
I'll have another look. I'm pretty sure I have been through them, but thanks. ;)
---
There is a speed cap for running, yes. Sprinting I think so too, but haven‚Äôt confirmed. Speed cap for running actually seems to be 20%, so speed demon with SiN, or Emergency Protocols, seem to not work as advertised.
---
Found a mod at a player vendor yesterday, 1250 caps.

Not to sound rude but you‚Äôre not going to have fun, you‚Äôre going to just be waving your arms hoping someone can save you. You‚Äôre not going to have a build being that low to do any kind of damage or keep yourself alive. In the end fight I watch level 150+‚Äôs get stomped, even I get my ass one hit killed at level 220 and I have good armor and perks to stay alive through most anything. 
---
Get your levels first, it doesn‚Äôt take long to level up. Nothing down there except the radroaches are close to your level
---
Faster fire + 90% weight reduction  Bloodied or AA gatling gun.  I've got troubleshooters, zealots, TS and even a 1\* AA; but having just the right roll would be sweet as pie.
---
Get bored.
---
I smash him with my super sledge.
---
I wish I played more in the past few months to have enough atoms for these skins pepehands
---
I managed to get pale rider, but now I'm gonna have to grind this week and decide whether I want the blood raider or the plague mask
---
I'm out of easy atom challenges so I'm gonna have to do it
---
I have the same thing... On fiber. And my line has been uninterrupted for months according to my uplink monitor. _no_ other games/apps/anything disconnects every few hours. I don't even get this on psnow. And that is streamed from an external server. 
---
The eternal disconnects of fallout 76 is Def not on my side.
---
this is a bug that has been outstanding since launch. it'll happen more than once consecutively if you're super unlucky.
---
 I like my X0-1, and was pleased I liked the one that did not ruin it's X0-1ness. Its pretty nice although I hardly ever wear it. :)
---
Just smelt the lead and iron
---
Instigating Black Powder Rifle w/ +10% while aiming and Faster Reload
---
Would Krean my Korm
---
Bloodied or Instigating Explosive +250 dr while reloading railway
---
Not 100% sure but I think there are 2 different ones listed in the machine, although they have the same name, I kinda thought one was male and the other female.
---
You can see a slight difference in size on the pictures but that is all, would be much better if devs changed the names or descriptions, to clearly distinguis them ofc.
---
Item needs TECH support.
---
Just switch weapons on a server load; no need to slog through the reload animation in that scenario.
---
I had heard that as long as you don‚Äôt take your finger off the trigger all auto shots register as crits once you activate it.
---
Check the map for events.
---
Something other than sweet roll.
---
Still drops. Energy weapons temporarily can not be explosive, but everything else is still possible. There are a few exceptions like a quad fat man that don't drop though
---
 I'd pay that, I have not seen it for a couple of months.
---
That‚Äôs at least a heck of a lot cheaper than the vendor. It‚Äôs like 20+ per from them.
---
A well designed lvling system will have a 3 star legendary 100 lvl enemy drop a 2 star armor piece or a lvl 45-50 item in the paradise event
---
I do ok at it but I have chameleon armor so.. some ppl can kill me some cant it's fun for the most part tho
---
i want this for no particular reason at all.
---
I‚Äôve been getting that a lot. Closing out of build mode and reopening it fixes it for me‚Äîbut it‚Äôs super obnoxious when it happens with every other piece.
---
Quad explosive weightless LMG. Hold down the mouse button until everything is dead
---
The Calibrated shocks have existed for as long as I‚Äôve known. I had them on mine since mid February. The jetpack I‚Äôve never seen though
---
Damn this sounds fun.
---
Would be nice. They‚Äôd be better off just doubling it though.
---
Most people play one session a day at most, how would they benefit from refreshing after 10 hours?
---
TSE Gauss with faster reload
---
Actually I don't know. I was logged in then check my inventory. It was there.
---
You can also pick one up at one of the raider camps in the divide it's on a dog in a cage
---
It's always somewhere on a server at a given time.  I checked every location on the same server to get it.  More expensive and also a rip if you get disconnected, but it does work.
---
Also annoying that after you get one. You'll start finding broken cameras in random containers.  I've got like 10 that can't be sold or scrapped, only destroyed.
---
Love it.
---
Fret over my overstuffed stash and what to get rid of :(
---
It's the only thing that I find most satisfying than clawing at the Insult Bot. At least some of the burns are fun.
---
I'm so good. Why don't you meet me in a world and we'll see how good you are at jacking my shit, since your so fucking boss.
---
Lol, I think I have 7 or 8 mutations, and I TOTALLY support this. And make the damage based on how many mutations you have. I'm shit at PVP as it is, but I'd find it hilarious to try it and get smoked in new and interesting ways.
---
Check if any workshops are claimed.
---
Shame. I have a few of them on myself but haven't had a chance to test it.
---
(XB1) GT: AlexAutoAxe 
---
Please do! Let me know what you think, I still have my bunker
---
You can roll a TSE AR or a TS/+33% Vats rifle. 33% vats hit chance and explosive share the same slot.
---
Head over to scorched earth if in lucky enough join a server that already has it going on.
---
Otherwise its drain the vendor caps, than scrap legendaries for scrip.
---
AA/Firerate/90% weight 50 cal.
---
Something somewhere along the lines of Assasin's it does 10% Dmg to Playesr on weapons and on armor it reduces incoming Dmg of other players by 10%. So Maybe on Armor *75% chance to absorb 10% energy damage* and on weapon *+ Total ammount Energy Damage absorbed by "Thunderous" armor*
---
Once you get into it it's good. Actually listening to quest holotapes as you progress in them, there's some good ones. Then building your camp, and updated it whilst it gets bigger and better once you start finding plans. And then building better Power Armor. Plenty of stuff to do and it's cool there's other people running around doing the same. I'm a bit burnt out but keep coming back for these events.
---
I'm a solo player and I ran into an event just in time to see a higher level player get dropped so I went into responder mode and revived him and completed the challenge without even realizing it right away. So you're absolutely correct...think outside the box.
---
I‚Äôm sure! Not to many out there yet
---
No skin off my nose. You are an idiot though, I definitely mean that.
---
delete the pictures. only saved photos will be used for loading screens.
---
Ah, I hadn‚Äôt even thought of player vending.
---
Yeah and it's even more doubly annoying when you're on the invisible ramp and can't jump üòÇ
---
Sorry for the stupid question but what weapons or weapon uses the plasma cores? I've gotten a bunch of the plasma cores and dropped them because I had no idea what they're used for..
---
Yeah that's is you use a PA Build (I don't)
---
I have a heated power fist I call "Hot Punch"
---
One Violent Night has an indirect one. Whenever you find the Sons of Dane radio signal, it starts. When the signal is lost, the event ends.
---
oh ok didn't know that, shame
---
Yummy.
---
You can view and delete the photos you don't want it's LB on the map screen then photos I think
---
I run a munitions shop out of the Cranberry Bog. I try to keep stock for every ammo type, all at competitive rates. I also do commissions for weapons. Low level dwellers get freebies.
---
I don't understand why people sell even 1* legendaries for exorbitant prices.  Currently I have a 3* Berserker's Fat Man up for 950c, because that's what I think is a reasonable price considering how much the average dweller has on hand.
---
That was very well written. Thank you for the great read!
---
I have a Gatlin Plasma that does over 100 for damage. I've killed several higher level creatures and some of them were legendaries.
---
All good man, this spreadsheet is a life saver when I'm trying to hunt something specific down: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/edit#gid=1760290048
---
Dunno. Was it in toxic vally? Pc? Did you had your mic running and told me that you are stuck in my floor? Then the awnser is yes. xD
---
Forgot to mention that too. Happens a lot to me when I get stuck in someones camp from fast traveling there. Pain in the ass I tell you.
---
Maybe he was wasted!
---
I feel dirty now for some reason.
---
Furious explosive weightless handmade or instigating explosive weightless gauss rifle
---
I like to name my weapons as close as possible to the real life equivalent. 
---
Radium rifle? Volkssturmgewehr
---
Lever action rifle? Marlin 1895
---
Handmade rifle? Ak47 or akm 
---
Hunting rifle? Remington model 700
---
Minigun? Gau 19
---
It intrigues me. Granted it won't be fully accurate, but it beats generic "rifle" or "shotgun" initial names.
---
AA two shot vats hand made rifle
---
Totally badass, I absolutely love these skins
---
Haha, no, sorry. I appreciate your rushing to help a fellow vault dweller in need, though!
---
It‚Äôs good until there‚Äôs nothing left to do and you don‚Äôt know where or how to continue the overseer quest. At least that‚Äôs my problem and I didn‚Äôt really want to YouTube the whole thing.
---
Exactly, sleep, play the piano. Check the stove for food stuffs to make, and check ammo for each device. Consider levels of Disease Cure and RadShield and if they are low do the appropriate trip.
---
 Its a wonder I ever get out the door.
---
I hear you there. Same thing has happened to me.  What a fucking joke. Lol. I  reported it to  Bethesda and I was told it is my internet connection, I  laughed and told the representative my connection is fine. I am running 100mbs on my new router and modem? That was the best response yet. Lmao!  Well hopefully my internet connection will start working again! I wish you all the best! :)
---
It used to be for those scrap 0/30 money challenges. Hopefully, we'll see more of those again instead of these photo op ones.
---
I need to give it more than the one try, but I fast traveled to the event last night and was the only one there. I figured I would just stick to one animal and keep it alive. Problem is, many of the enemies have ranged attacks so if I don't get to them before they can get an attack off, the animal is going to take at least one hit.
---
Assuming you have someone to cover each of the animals, is there a pattern you have to learn so you can intercept the enemies before they get to your animal? At least with Free Range, most of the baddies were melee so you could form up a circle on the brahmin.
---
the "uniform" changes depending on the gender of your character and then if you want to wear the opposite genders uniform you buy the "skirt" or "shorts" accordingly.
---
closing and reopening doesn‚Äôt seem to work for me :(
---
Endurance has a perk that reduces damage you take from explosions.  Fire proof I think is the perk card.
---
is this beer special or you just want it for collection?
---
Padded or dense mod on chest armor; Fireproof perk card under endurance
---
It's the big fireflies that are in the enlightment event at the lighthouse...
---
No. I was damn near down near the main fissure site everyone nukes nowadays.
---
I‚Äôm most likely these days to travel to a nearby landmark and hoof it there. But if they are far from any of your known locations, here are a few things that might help:
---
Just before you materialize, pick a direction and try to rapidly move. You will usually be moving just fast enough to get outside the camp range before everything solidifies. Unless there is a tree or rock in front of you (shrug)...
---
If you can see ant interactive object (chair, workbench, etc.) try and click it and it will put you in normal space for using that item.
---
If you can manage to place your PA within reach, you can click to enter it.
---
If all else fails, in super rare cases just spamming pip boy menu suddenly puts you above ground, but honestly that makes no sense to me why it would.
---
It might just be the fasnacht donut only right now, but I'm hoping we'll see more high level food like that requiring it.
---
Tactics is mostly non-canon. Maxson‚Äôs initial rebellion, which would later become the Brotherhood, started because they discovered what the scientists were doing with FEV. Maxson executed the scientists and then made a declaration the the Army about their desertion and rebellion. The bombs fell before the Army could issue a response or try to retake Mariposa, and eventually Maxson formed the Brotherhood to keep dangerous technology like FEV and the nukes out of the hands of the people that would misuse them.
---
You‚Äôve gotta get those pics from inside the vaults wile you can
---
You're fun üòÇüòÇ now I know how much space I'm renting out in your tiny brain. üòÅüòÅ
---
Yes I have a Rocket Launcher just for his thruster hole and I thrust it right up in there!
---
Pvp is a who sees who first thing now.. it sucks for sure. I'm testing max damage resistance perks to see if gives any real edge to be high armor. Relying on God roll legendary gear shouldnt be mandatory for PVP
---
Kill the dumbass ghouls or mutants that are probably beating up my house.
---
Gatlin Plasma is the only one I know of but there most definitely is others
---
How ironic. You've been there and done that.
---
Bloodied swing speed strength super sledge... a boy can dream
---
Im not thinking of this as a negative just a bit overly idealistic. Download size is the smallest hurdle to cross for them to port it. I guess they could majorly lower texture quality which would in terms save storage. But honestly i doubt theyd be able to port this to switch let alone phones. Fortnite pulled it off because its much less complex
---
I run fireproof 2 and dense chest mod. Pretty much immune from explosions and scorchbeast attacks.
---
Yall just never give up on that stash space, it's fine as it perfectly is and you just need to stop hoarding,
---
Unfortunately I haven't been able to stock pile them since I haven't been able to find many of them in the world or through player vending and railroad stations.
---
Not necessarily annoying, as I love the music, but definitely repetitive pretty quickly. Playlist seems very short. Instead, I usually load up the [Old World Radio livestream/radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZKX2fPHKNo) on Youtube. Has all the music from all the games, including DJs (both in-game and audio from people online pretending to be DJs, like Storyteller/Shoddycast.)
---
Me too, although it's probably going to eat up more server resources. I hope they do build only servers or something like that
---
Hey I have a question that you guys might be able to answer: is this game worth playing?
---
I can mod it if youre on ps4
---
Pubic Sassy Amen
---
Auto receivers also change the perk cards though. And if it‚Äôs the only auto pistol I‚Äôd be using there isn‚Äôt that much point. It makes sense to optimise my non-auto‚Äôs and maintain ammo. I‚Äôd want the quad to I‚Äôd have a clip of 60 and wouldn‚Äôt need to reload mid encounter. As soon as you make it auto the ammo consumption shoots up.
---
Yea is a bit odd. Was tempted to test them out to notice a difference then I got a better gun so never bothered to.
---
If you have limited time to play it would give you more options to work around your schedules.  Especially when your work schedule isn't 9-5.
---
Same time?
---
Unfortunately, no. I built a covered bridge base using a bridge that's part of the map/world. It took hours of trial and error to get the placement right and there's very little room to spare. I'd never be able to place the blueprint.
---
As much as it sucks the challenges are harder so you have to buy the atoms
---
There have been datamined mailboxes for atom shop.  I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs more than cosmetic with all these requests!
---
What is there to do? All the events happens only once a day. All the high level events rarely take place. People are done with the scorch queen and nuke zones
---
"Exploring"
---
-This only applies to low level players who haven't bother looking around. A lot of people are done with exploring.
---
"Dress your character?"
---
Are you serious? This is not a game that has extensive customisation for outfits. Dressing up is an activity that last for a few minutes max.
---
"having people to play with"
---
Not everyone has people to play with and bethesda make it impossible for strangers to hook up within the game.
---
"building your camp"
---
You can only do that to a certain extend. Additionally, you need to be high level to have decent camp budget and you need a lot of caps to unlock camp objects. Which goes back to grinding for caps.
---
"Help other people"
---
-How does that work? Do you just stalk other players? Or you have an open mic and go around being the complete weirdo asking random players whether they need help?
---
"finding stupid stuff to hunt for like a legendary shovel with swing speed?"
---
-How is that any different from grinding for caps/ scripts?
---
What compelled you to utter such complete nonsense?
---
Yea I‚Äôve played since release. I don‚Äôt know how people that do respec do it. Because now especially post 50 feels harder to level, and would take forever to relocate even the smallest amount of points while at the same time with the lack of gaining perk cards would take even more levels and time, to accrue the ones I want after I fix my special levels. 
---
TLDR; 1 point at a time are you serious?
---
Guess what, they DID.  I had finished with these hints working on other challenges when notice that server was shutting down, logged off, back on another it's gone!  
---
They took this away, yet my VATS still does not work for flying targets with melee attacks.  Nice priorities they have.
---
Either an instigating swing speed deathclaw gauntlet or an instigating shiskeab.
---
Rats! PS4 here. You should share pics if you can.
---
Makes sense - that‚Äôs the same reason I prefer lever over handmade for rifles.  Very balanced damage to ammo consumption.
---
Sorry to dig this up a few days later, but I love the idea of a 1 intelligence Vault Dweller who doesn't know the different between a rifle and a stick, bashing everything in the wasteland. It sounds a lot of fun no matter how it goes!
---
Agh, they must‚Äôve used diseased cranberries.
---
Now all we need is for someone to edit in the fallout narrations and it would be gold.
---
I wish we could keep that mod after finishing the quest. Tons of lols
---
I don't either but carry one for issues like this.
---
I would like a arcade cabinet so I can play nuka tapper in style.
---
I really only play an hour each day at this point, I log in go to whitesprings and kill the ghouls and complete Uranium fever until I have got my caps for the day and legendary scrip then I log off
---
I've definitely noticed weird item placement denial in Camp mode, was it the rock/tree thing you mentioned? Mine was with floor and wall removal mostly, but some weird item denial. I tried to remove what was a "C" ring of foundation but it wouldn't let me remove random parts; only in sequence from one end of the other. Why would they do this? It's only foundation
---
I'd cover my camp in Deathclaw turds if they were cat shaped:)
---
Totally dude! If i were working at bethesda on this, i'd cut damage players deal to each other by, no joke, at least 75% 
---
You can get burned down in 1 or 2 seconds from autos, and 1 shot by snipers in adventure. Same for survival, but the sniper takes 2 shots. That's crazy. I can burn down a guy just as fast and honestly, that's no fun either. There are no "good battles" where the tide turns even once in the fight. Like the whole exchange is over immediately. Always.
---
I mean the game could be played at 720p or 1080p. Many games are being ported to the Nintendo switch like Resident evil, doom, Skyrim, Fortnite, and many more. It's only a matter of time that we play full fledge game console games on the go.
---
There are even services that stream your games from their systems to your phone or computer.
---
Im willing to have an sd card take up 30 GBs or more for the game.
---
Fallout 76 is smaller than Fallout 4 in files.
---
50 vs 90 is a huge difference.
---
I play Fallout 76 at 1080p on medium settings because I stream the game for others to enjoy and to make sure it doesn't slow down when I play it.
---
I've tamed them, but it only lasts moments and seems pointless since they're so passive - but I'll try anything to keep them around.
---
I joined the event via fast travel and I ended up in the new area.
---
Seen a 3* super mutant fighting a 3* ghoul in the borrows only seen it once and glad I took a pic of them fighting with the camera lol that mutant gave me my best weapon to date a 3* ghoul slayer handmade
---
I have one for you if you're still looking. If you add me on pc you can have it for the nice sum of 0 caps. :)
---
very creative. love the way you wrote sheepsquatch station. the greek and bulb letter combo is cute as hell
---
That's exactly why they nerfed Sentinel. So no armor could totally protect you anymore. 
---
Now it's a matter of them taking out VATS system and it would be like any other FPS game for those pvpers out there, good old skill targetting a moving target.
---
Quad explosive railway rifle named Thomas the Tank Engine.
---
 Thank you for the offer. I'm on PC though.
---
It sounds to me like you just don‚Äôt enjoy this game? Maybe you should try a different one lol 
---
And it‚Äôs not hard to find low level players and drop them a bag of plans, aid and ammo that you‚Äôre not using to help out - it‚Äôs so common in fact they added a gift emote to make it easier! Plus there are LFG on console to find people looking for help and also people here who ask for help frequently- so it‚Äôs really not that hard to meet new people to help and hang out with :) 
---
And yes I am serious - a lot of players - myself included like to dress our character and have different outfits- it‚Äôs almost like it was a requested feature in fallout four to have cosmetics that didn‚Äôt negate your armor and now we have a whole shop dedicated to just that. Weird. 
---
And you can server hop to do events multiple times - none of the events are one time a day only. i am not sure what game you are playing but I see people nuke the queen and Whitesprings multiple times every single day on multiple servers. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying that there‚Äôs not problems with the game or it‚Äôs perfect because it definitely isn‚Äôt and there‚Äôs a ton of room for improvement in a lot of ways  but it‚Äôs definitely not as empty and boring as you‚Äôre trying to make it out to be.
---
If one, why not all perks? Is the issue regarding Stash Space about the server speed?
---
I bought the plan in bos vendor
---
It's mostly canon
---
It was not there today.
---
removing screws is a highly technical procedure. stick to building fusion generators, its way less of a learning curve.
---
I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs only been happening after the recent update for me..before I was able to put platforms down through certain tree limbs and i was able to build pretty much an entire house in a tree but now I can‚Äôt build anywhere near that same tree and I don‚Äôt understand why they negatively changed one of the most important parts of the game..
---
Apparently you‚Äôre not renting enough to come up with original insults so try using yours. It might just help you get a life instead of complaining on reddit.
---
It absolutely needs it, as of now i feel it‚Äôs pretty safe to say it‚Äôs impossible to solo. Maybe you can save one animal but too much ground to cover.
---
I would perfer that too but it's Bethesda we're talking about here
---
1000 upvotes.  No mere coincidence.
---
Do you understand that people still play the campaign in L4D2? Vindictus is still alive and well. If they turn FO76 into a theme park game, people would come back to have fun rather than come back just to grind.
---
Remove it because it doesn't stay 3 stars
---
Doesn't matter if you label them or not
---
Lol just figured it out recently myself, lvl 110. I thought it was random radio proximity spam until I had my map open.
---
I will help you out. Will send an invite in about an hour. I should have everything i need to Build the rest on my Character.
---
How bout unlimited
---
not sure if you've noticed but on PC the left/right arrows fine-tune adjust sliders, and the Z/C keys fast-tune sliders. holding right and C for example makes the slider move quite fast.
---
Cook food
---
As to the reload. Cary a junk Melee weapon with ya and log out with it equipped. Don't know why Beth hasn't fix this issue yet
---
I‚Äôm up for this again
---
thank you kind sir!
---
Neither butthurt nor do I not know, don‚Äôt worry (:
---
You still need help with this?
---
What finally worked for me is getting the quest from personal terminal then entering. Crashed 5/5 times before that, only crashed once inside after a few hours.
---
I do that's my psn, friend me and I'll join you
---
the prospector's hat sates my lust for a wide-brimmed hat, but more options would still be nice.
---
As another poster has said, go to your photo gallery on the main menu, and delete your unwanted pictures.
---
The backpack helped a little bit my god. I‚Äôm up to 790 in my stash and 20 away from being overweight on my person. I‚Äôm bursting at the seams here
---
Carry power armor. When you're stuck in their foundation you can usually drop the armor in their base, enter it and it'll pull you out of the foundation or whatever your clipping with.
---
I'd rather they totally changed the stash system. Give us storage for 1000 of each crafting material *and* a set amount of space for gear and supplies. Mine is always full, yet I'm constantly getting rid of things. I feel sad about all the legendary gear that I never got to try.
---
Damn so close I was the 999th upvote
---
There's no excuse on PC to not have a text window, where we can input our own values. Surely not a difficult thing to code.
---
Quad explosive +1 agi or 25 percent less vats cost  double barrel  for my shotgunner 
---
Bloodied explosive harpoon for my heavy gunner
---
I found the plan for it in a cranberry bog treasure map. Buy maps you see. 
---
Most vendors I see sell them for 5k if they know it's rarity. I sold one for that in my vendors.
---
 I am essentially immune to normal levels of Explosions. I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and suffer no damage.
---
 Its Perks and Armour. You need 3 levels of Fireproof and you need Armour with a Dense Chest and Strengthened Limbs. The Limbs seem to matter less, but you cripple easily without Strengthened.
---
 Now I do have BoS Heavy Combat so lesser Armours might let some damage through, I dunno.
---
I may or may not have had a bloody, swing speed, +1 str grognak axe drop last weekend, and it may or may not have me concerned that I used up the remaining good luck I have for my entire life.
---
Also, we need grognak axe mods ASAP.
---
***scrapper, scrapping***

Yeah games almost as bad a division 2
---
Yeah I mean it just involves the complete nuclear devastation of the entire world followed by power hungry political types bend on vengeance creating giant disease spewing bats that cause the few that remained to burn up from the inside out as their bodies and minds were forcefully integrated into some perverse hive mind.   
---
Also other players that are just looking for any reason they can get to pop a hole in your head and take your junk while flinging insults that you can't even find on urban dictionary over voice chat.
---
But at least there is no naughty sex stuff amirite?

You didn't read it did you. English doesn't seem like your first language.
---
 Damn I have some of those. Time to go Treasure Hunting I guess. :)
---
they arent going to see this..
---
Yup I'm still there up in your mind space go on keep flattering me. I'm all up in that without being nasty. Nor will I ever have to go there. I already won you're obviously worried about the implications of my post.
---
You obvioisly feel threatened by my post shining a spotlight on your filthy filthy little gameplay habits and exploits. 
---
Have fun thinking about me üòò
---
No, it isn‚Äôt. Bethesda has declared the game non-canon, except for a few choice parts.
---
Thank you for that. That was the issue! Darn pip boy!
---
So is it worth getting or....
---
My favorite re weapon right now is a bloodied rw black powder pistol lol
---
tis true, i was merely offering something helpful in the interim.
---
I accidentally scrapped about 400 plastic worth of bulk junk, I just closed the game and took a small break after that..
---
Bye no one cares you left
---
I think this is in lieu of using the posters to let us know about new additions to the game
---
Oh I have one of those. I just want a shovel so bad. They‚Äôre so funny
---
Chill out man
---
Lol, i bet.
---
Nice. I'll have to give it another go especially now that they've patched the weekly survival challenge
---
When it works, it was worth it. But I cant play a game that keeps crashing no matter what I do. Sucks, but it is what it is. I have other games and new games out that i can turn to. It was fun though.
---
So is it a bug that my male is wearing a skirt?
---
wave emote.
---
Furious Explosive Handmade, with 250 DR while reloading.
---
That's what I heard but I don't know first-hand.
---
Is your gt the same as here? I‚Äôd enjoy stopping over to see the place and your wares.
---
Well what annoys me is that I already got the cat from the shop and had a couple of them in my camp already.  Now I can't build any more.  I even created a blueprint of one but "do not meet the requirements for this item". doesn't seem right.
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug
---
AA TSE Lever action
---
In tadpole, there is a uniform, short, skirt, in opossum there is a uniform and short.
---
That‚Äôs pretty awesome.
---
Do you need me to die in water as well?
---
I got a TSE pistol a couple of days ago dropped on a ghoul in WS. They are definitely still available.
---
AA, swing speed, +1 ST Ski Sword.
---
The number in the line of text is not what sold. It is how much the player has in their inventory.
---
We have bloogbuds in my house too lol...I cal yao guis "Yogi" (Hheeeyyy Booboo).
---
Thanks, me too. :D
---
PLATFORM!!!!
---
Thank you for reminding me!! Xbox One
---
There was a glitch that duplicated PA under certain conditions. Happened to me and my son several times. I sold my extra ultracite armor. (I had 3. Started with 1)
---
Stand absolutely still for 1 minute while my base loads in random chunks.
---
better yet, buff lvl 50 wood armor so it's competitive with other armors as far as dr/er/rr
---
It's random but not completely random because I fought him 20+ times when my CAMP was in the savage divide just north of Summerville
---
Standart is the new standard - kudos ;)
---
Surprise! No one cares.
---
Do you need perks to craft the armor your using?
---
AA or Explosive Lever action, 25% fire rate, 15% reload.
---
Ok Bye üñë
---
When u say this all I could think of was.
---
Canabalanca
---
It is good information, I appreciate it. Generally find the sliders very finnicky
---
I mean you most likely need to use the armored perks
---
Not dismal, just brutally honest. Bethesda encoded more than 300,000 different combinations for a 3\* legendary mob drop (not including variation in lvl of item) that all drop at the same rate. The chance of getting exactly what you want (correct weapon/armor + correct primary/secondary/tertiary effect) from a 3\* drop are 0.0000028% (give or take).
---
Drop your GT and next time I'm on I'll be sure to try and join!
---
ChoosyFurball54 ‚Äî If i‚Äôm on GTA V or Fallout, hit me up! It on fortnite it‚Äôs my brother
---
oh i see i didnt read your original post properly. i assumed it was like the tadpole as well, where there is shorts skirt and uniform. and for me, the skirt and uniform were identical at the tadpole level. then at possum the only options are shorts and uniform, so yeah it looks like uniform is the skirt and shorts is what you probably wanted. they definitely should clarify that. but i mean.... challenges they add to earn the badges dont even work so.... yeah. i guess you got screwed.
---
That just leaves you with 3\* wood which will evaporate with time.
---
Ah, sweet.  Much thanks!
---
Haha!
---
I would very much like to join, if you get a chance please message me the discord link thanks
---
Can we even get an acknowledgement from Bethesda on this?
---
Ah thank you that makes much more sense
---
üñê
---
Lol!
---
For the love of god get rid of the pick locks lol
---
Interact with my moth man statue for good luck!
---
I would add suppressor (CHR) and dodgy (AGI) to it. Other than that looks good enough
---
If your looking for the start to that and are on PC I have a 1\* Instigating DC Gauntlet for sale.
---
Kind of...
---
Mole rats vary between f*ckers, suckers, pita and "ohhellnotagain"
---
I can give you 700 5mm for that 200 caps i guess or 500 .308
---
Do you still have the metal armor mods?
---
Yeah,i call scorchbeasts " AH WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU COME FROM CUNT"
---
The topiaries were NEVER in the atomshop.  They weren‚Äôt two weeks ago,  they‚Äôre not now.
---
They were toggled buildable in the game files for everyone then untoggled and never put up for sale.
---
Vampire (or bloodied)  / explosive /  vats AP cost handmade
---
Plans cost like 90 caps each, so dirt cheap regardless if you need perk cards or not. I'd say buy them anyway. Cross that bridge when you get to it.
---
Your opinion is valid.  It might be 1 out of 1000 but valid nonetheless.
---
Mrrrrrr
---
But for weapons i learned some new from reddit - toot-toot and pew-pew lol
---
Last time I looked (two weeks ago), this was bugged for the yao guai and wolf.  I hadn't heard of any patch/fix.
---
Also me if I'm in progress with the Stings and Things daily.
---
I've gotten close, but still want that exact roll.
---
Biv ain't messin around
---
lucky u had no issues i haven‚Äôt had lag issues like others just freezing and crashing I play just about everyday and how the game played before patch vs after is a world of a difference to me
---
Weird
---
They already ruined pvp in both modes why are you people still crying ?
---
Craft and scrap them, better invest in a lot of screws, also craft low level light metal armor, mods learned from those are good for light, sturdy and heavy metal
---
Nice. I have an AA FR minigun that is an absolute beast. Named it Lag Inducer.
---
I dont think so but I'd still buy it
---
I have been, but no luck in the rare mods unfortunately.
---
I just swap them in when i need them... I just can't resist opening everything when I'm exploring üòÅ
---
Ahhh that‚Äôs right. We didn‚Äôt get to keep üòî
---
Reload because CAMP couldn't be placed.
---
In remplacement of what if i May ask?
---
This made me lol.  Gaming youtubers report news about the game good and bad.  You need a break from this game, friend.
---
It does not unfortunately.....
---
BOS is just a mod you can learn and apply to any variant of combat armor.
---
That's a bit simplistic. Your buying power doesn't change just because the price does. I'm still not sold on how it hurts anyone's gameplay experience. Thanks though.
---
Well its more likely that is their problem then it being RDR2 and FO76 combined. I have both those games and have no disconnect problems. Only time FO76 ever crashed on me was last night during the Arktos Pharma before I initiated the quest through the terminal.
---
No, my GT is slothbrigade. I'll be on later
---
It's like from that one episode of Cowboy Bebop.
---
Or that film, Slacker dir. Richard Linklater.
---
You should finally get out of the Vault dude...
---
Mutant Slayer's is useful for leveling/farming at West Tek, but yeah other than that it's garbage. Same goes for Ghoul Slayer's-- garbage but kinda useful for farming Whitesprings. I can definitely get behind MS affecting mutated players. I could also get behind GS affecting players past a certain threshold of rads, which would throw some more balance against bloodied builds. I could \*possibly\* get behind the Mutant's effect being nerfed but stacking with every mutation you have (maybe like +3% damage dealt per mutation you have).
---
It was never meant to be there for free
---
Patched was an atom shop oops
---
Go under your quests and make sure you have it selected. Should pop up with circles to check
---
Dang, I've heard people talking about it like it was special, so I assumed it actually made noise. Hmm, guess I'll get it anyway. Thanks lol
---
Why Bethesda is too lazy? They fixed standart receiver but haven't checked other receivers. They are acting like amateurs.
---
Instigating Hunting Rifle... The day will come.
---
I wanted to only use the Greek letters since the ATOM shop ones are absolutely horrible, but I used what I could. I was going to switch the other letters with the neon ones but they took up too much budget. I'm definitely starting to like the combo though.
---
Did you try changing worlds?
---
where‚Äôs the plan for the diffuser?
---
I never really cared for these challenges. Bethesda is ridiculous for thinking people would actually do this to obtain measly Atoms.
---
What mods?
---
No, it does not. It does look very nice, though - 9/10, would def buy for 200-500caps
---
Few comments:
---
What‚Äôs with the melee card in strength?  Did you mean bear arms?  
---
How much ammo do you really plan to carry?  As a high str build bear arms will drop your heaviest item (the guns) so much more than ammo.
---
Perception looks good
---
Endurance looks good
---
Charisma I would say go 1 pt tenderizer 3 suppressor.  Get that spare from int.
---
Int is pretty solid.  Don‚Äôt see batteries included as useful.
---
Agility I can speak from experience that high level born survivor will eat up stimpack.  1 pt this 5 pts adrenaline is what I‚Äôd suggest.
---
Luck.  What are you trying to negate with class freak?  Int isn‚Äôt a huge loss, and all indications are that class freak doesn‚Äôt impact speed demon, and if it did, food isn‚Äôt hard to come by.  Drop class freak pick up one gun army.  I personally don‚Äôt run class freak at all on any build.  I have just toughed out the lower carry weight which now may be moot with backpacks.
---
My build below, similar tastes as you can see.  Just wanted a 15 charisma character have debated shuffling 5 pts back to int but I haven‚Äôt really missed gunsmith.
---

---
Responder vendor bots
---
This is really similar to how I think the Mutant's effect could be reworked. Nerf its base damage but have it scale with the number of mutations you have.
---
1500 would be better
---
It doesn't. However, it still looks really cool.
---
Ever since starting the game my girlfriend and I have called the Charred Ghouls ‚ÄúChonka‚Äôs‚Äù. In the high levels now and that name still sticks.
---
Exactly! Theres plenty of angles to tackle this objective from such as encryptid, SBQ and now arktos pharma this players approach was just another way to get the job done :)
---
Probably not. I know the nixie clock doesn't even keep time which was disappointing...it would be cool if it showed the time in-game.
---
I've never heard it make a noise and I'm around it a lot. Looks great though
---
They didnt balance it, they made it useless. I wont survive for a second longer wearing Sentinal assasin than I would wearing nothing now.
---
Yeah, all my disconnects lately have been due to my crappy internet, haven‚Äôt been dropped from a server for a while now
---
nicee thanks for this, saving this comment
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs either around the glass caverns or in one of the terminals in the enclave base
---
I have my passcode near my bed. If people wanna see in my locked building. They can find it easy lol
---
Not only that? But why is a .45 of a lever action rifle on par with a .50 cal rifle? If they're saving that position for an anti material rifle as top rifle...I kinda get it then
---
Mine is like that too and I made sure I have the quest as marked but nothing shows up.
---
no i shut the game off and took some ibuprofen shortly after the picture was taken. Is that a solution that could work?
---
Banging name, will be tomorrow but will be sure to try!
---
lol, nice story.  There's been speculation the "wastelanders" dlc coming up in the fall will have human npc's so wait and see I guess.
---
it is exactly the same friking  bagpack with different skin colour. i dont want to be a dick but it is a shity art work, this doesn't mean it looks bad, it looks very good but still a lazy work
---
Oof
---
You could try searching.
---
Yeah it's new
---
I think the point of wood armour is to get a specific legendary effect coupled with an incredibly low weight for a full set and better sneak in dark places, which is kind of like a unique legendary effect that's only on wood armour in the same way that The Fixer has a few odd effects (+stealth and movement speed, higher damage than a combat rifle). A wooden chestpiece reminds me more of someone wearing a necklace of regeneration vs a regenerating breastplate made of leather and heavy polymers: the dr/er always seemed like a minor bonus on top of the effects
---
I always go to Watoga station FIRST to deposit my junk. Feels bad man, back to the grind!
---
I assume it's from Arktos?
---
Are there any stairs under it?
---
By chance you remember how much he was selling it for?
---
The melee card increases the fire rate on the gatling... Plus Both my most used heavy's have reduced weight ( Bear arms is kinda useless for me) ammo-wise i Carry around 20k ammo...
---
Charisma advice i Will take tho
---
Batteries Inc reduce the weight on my fusion cores and the plasma cores for one of my 'fun-play weapons'
---
Class freak is a left-over from when i used to run healing factor and some other mutations so i'll take your advice on that one.
---
Ty for the feedback!
---
5000 caps
---
Looks great! Will visit when I can!
---
It doesn't make sense to me that we could make leather armor but we couldnt make wood armor. Wood armor is literally just bark taped to my body.
---
My buddy and I call Scorched "pepperoni people" and ghouls are "stinkies"...
---
Some days yes but yesterday she gave me an explosive trouble shooter handmade so she not always bad to me it seems
---
I agree with the points you make. I guess everyone would have one of those weapons after a minute or two. Then field is level once again because everyone is mutated at this point. 
---
If you have no mutations, I don‚Äôt think any weapon will counter the disadvantages that you face in PVP
---
It‚Äôs in the daily as a repeatable
---
not connected to it, but yes this is a second floor with stairs coming up to the floor this rood would be covering
---
Some rando friend requested me and I was said what the hell . So every day for about a week I got a message that says hey whatcha doing ? He‚Äôs no longer in my friends list .
---
Yep, AgentClaret!
---
How did you label, exactly?
---
I have floors I can't remove because they support for something... I made a floating base from the one foundation and have one floor panel too many on the outside of my first floor and I can't remove so I've had to kinda make it like a diving board
---
Try getting rid of the stairs till after you put the roof then put them back

Reminds me too much of the Brain Scratch episode of Cowboy Bebop.
---
Maybe stash space shouldn‚Äôt be based off weight, but item numbers. One piece of pa takes up the space of two weapons. I understand that infinite stash space cannot work, but basing it on weight seems arbitrary
---
Saw one today - Stims (not super) 200 cps.
---
Loled, took a dump on his potty and moved on.
---
that would require me getting rid of the whole second floor. I really think this is just the game being super picky with what can clip and where. But i will try this
---
I love all of these.
---
Sounds like a content issue. Probably one of the reasons this game has shot down in popularity, cuz it ain't hard enough
---
It might not be that but stairs were the problem I had the other day
---
Yeah  I found this out the hard way as well - I wish we could sell things back to the vendor machines, or trade them uniforms to other players.
---
Don‚Äôt know if it helps, when I can‚Äôt place something that I should be able to. I exit the build menu and enter it immediately again and the item is suddenly placeable.
---
Yes from arkos
---
Protect single Assaultrons.
---
They have feelings too ya know?
---
Had the same problem, remove stairs, place roof, replace stairs
---
Ps4 ... it's in the title for fucks sake
---
That was happening to me yesterday.  I was eventually able to get in by joining the event and fast traveling that way.
---
Thats exactly what is happening to me
---
Pretty neat!
---
I believe they are all considered pistols until you put a stock on it but I'm not 100% on the beamsplitter/ shotgun info.
---
Bloodied, SS, +1 strength (or 40% less damage while blocking) Bone Hammer :-/
---
I‚Äôll do it for free if you‚Äôll help me out with the same, PSN: DrugsKeepMeGoing
---
Its wood!
---
What letters are those you used for the name? Atom shop?
---
i‚Äòll be on in 10 minutes
---
Cool :)
---
nope
---
yeah it didnt work thanks for the input though. I think im just gonna move, again
---
Np hope you can get it to work I know how frustrating the building can be
---
I'd be willing to trade in kind. I have one character at Grafton steel and one in Charleston whichever would be better for you.
---
it worked out, i think the effect of the different letters is legit, kinda like how the scrip machines say legendary but "leg" is backwards and its all wonky. now we need bethesda to allow you to put a scrip machine at your camp!
---
Idiots still trying to sell stuff for 25k. They don't seem to have a brains to think that if someone fast travels to their base he doesn't have 25k left.
---
Which mods were you looking for , I do still have them but on my alts which I don‚Äôt have access to at the moment and won‚Äôt until tom, which ones specifically did you want ?
---
Missing: Pet Topiary Cat 
---
Name: Leif 
---
Reward: 1000 caps upon safe return
---
Sent you an invite!
---
DoN't YoU gUyS hAvE pHoNeS?!
---
Read mobile game - couldn't resist. Sorry.
---
Placeable junk! For decorating or fulfilling your life long dream of being a hoarder.
---
LOL. I don't think so. I bought the Armour I have now from Cunningham and later got the last of the Heavy Combat plans I needed.
---
 I've know the BoS mod for ages, but I don't know where you would get that now. Probably from the Brotherhood quests.
---
It could yes, sometimes the game bugs out. Try launching the game and attempting again...If it still doesn't work...Try to be creative and perhaps add something that could cover that hole, like vending machines or nuka cola machines or something.
---
Functional pets.... how long before this sub blows up because people don't clean the dog poop from lawns.
---
lol oh well, it was nice while it lasted
---
Got one this morning a 3* bloodied crossbow wanted to trade it for an instigating rifle if not I‚Äôll scrap it
---
I‚Äôve been saying that they should‚Äôve added Wheeling and the Wheeling Island casino for so long! I thought deathclaw island would be better if there was a casino there that harbored deathclaws in its basement after some unfinished infrastructural work and made it to where Wheeling is just a deathclaw hellhole
---
I look around and see just about everyone but me on my server with explosive guns shredding everything down where I'm still struggling at level 60 ish doing. Yeah I am not going near the event until I feel I can contribute my part and not just be another useless player. Though I am happy to collect shit but I wouldn't even make a dent in the big guys health until I sort my perks out better and get my weapons sorted better so maybe I should join and have that be my usefulness
---
Okely, thanks for correction.
---
The black bulbed letters are the Light Bulb Letters Set in the ATOM shop, and the red/white ones are the Greek Letters set you get from Biv
---
Drop an item at the top of the fissure there's a 50/50 shot your junk will teleport to the new bag.
---
I agree with you, I wish they would remove some of the limits of the game. I understand they may do this for many reasons but wish they would remove the limits or increase them!
---
AAE fire rate LMG. I have loads of decent miniguns and gatlings, but I've yet to find a useful LMG.
---
I wish I was attacked every five minutes
---
Also add if you die? You spawn down in the bloody event. Not outside behind two long loading screens.
---
Bloodied ultracite Gatling laser with reduced weight
---
how is it a hit? ive seen more that 2 people there once
---
It's been past two patches for me that I can't remove a floor that's apparently supporting something when it's hanging off the side of my base
---
I fast traveled into a locked camp today, the owner was there , ran out the door and shut it again so I was still locked in, I left a glowing bloody shit on their bed like any other camp I get locked into
---
I tried healing factor for like 20 minutes. I couldn't believe how easy the game became because of it. I got rid of it immediately after
---
DarkRepulserXB1 - shoot me a message if you want to team up
---
I want to build my own underground bunker.  Vault life forever surface never !
---
I'm like you in regards I only get to play 1 or two hours a day if I can get on.
---
Normally do 8 hour sessions once a week though and it happens the longer you play.
---
Just checked. Cant place foundation
---
Unbelievable. Just think about all the people who got screwed over for them to take down the servers for that. I guess it really shows where their priorities are.
---
Alright! I‚Äôll be on in roughly an hour if you‚Äôll still be on!
---
Before --- and after --- yesterday's patch :(
---
Yeah, they stopped bulked scrap from auto scrapping, but whatever they did *also* stopped bulked scrap from being used when crafting (I would have to see what I needed, pull the bulls, scrap them, then craft), so they reverted it back.
---
They way how you can sell legendaries to vendor and trying to maximize your daily scripts is truly Bethesda quality. They don't test these mechanisms by themselves at all so there is always these ridiculous defects.
---
Right I feel like I do 30 min of prep before I even leave the camp
---
Why didbt you just stash your stuff like everyone else, sounds like a you problem tbh
---
Ok I sent it to you in a chat because I can send you a message for some reason.
---
It's been happening ever since Player vending was first introduced
---
I mean, adding fishing to Sea of Thieves brought a good amount of people back for it's relaxing factor. We have fishing poles, hats, and clothing in the game already. I honestly don't see why they couldn't add fishing at some point.
---
No worries, I‚Äôll be heading out shortly but I‚Äôll be on a bit later if you want to meet up
---
I like the Black Rider
---
Idiot
---
RIP in pieces
---
Why don't they just go back to the fo4 collision rules. People understood the glitches and new how to work with them. You could glitch objects into each other and natural items for a really creative touch. You could keep all that here and still maintain the no build zones to protect key areas. People building settlements was what kept fo4 relevant long after the content was done.
---
Alright! Just let me know
---
I sell my pie for the same. Pie is completely worthless. That‚Äôs the joke.
---
What platform are you on by chance?  I think I have that exact weapon
---
Nope, but it looks really nice.
---
trust me i tried that, didnt work. its just the sheer lack of freedom we havw sometimes to place objects
---
thanks
---
It would be cool if they also included the entire NES and SNES library so we could play that as well
---
Some people are just lucky like that, I've come across a few "gank squads" but they only make up a small portion of the PvP encounters I've had. An IRL buddy of mine has come across gank squads nearly every other time he logs on. 
---
Some people just have bad luck, or poor timing.
---
Yikes.
---
Yeah but there's not enough hardened mass, glowing mass,  and high radiation fluids to make it stable. Great yield though
---
This is easily the worst part of the game for me.
---
These design decisions can be explained and justified, but they ultimately suck the life out of one of the core design tenants of Bethesda games. 
---
"You can go anywhere you want, and you can do whatever you want"
---
Some days the limitations create real gameplay opportunities, and I like those days. For example, the fact that I can only hold so much junk means that I often have to go out and do stuff to craft ammo. I feel a real connection between time input, and opportunity output. Although, server hopping for lead does get rather tedious. 
---
Other days I feel unjustifiably punished for having a blast. For example, I was fortunate enough to be a part of at least 10 nukes in one day recently. Legendaries were a burden because I had way too many bad ones to scrip in one day, and a stash so full of decent items that I'd like to try someday, once my build can justify their existence. I couldn't even sell them to other players, because I'd have to put them in my stash to do so. 
---
Having some kind of limit makes sense, and I really don't think that everything should be unlimited. The numbers just feel off, and rather unrealistic.
---
I'm wouldn't consider myself a hardcore player. This is one of my main hobbies at the moment, but I have a rather busy life. I can't play 8 hours a day, but when I have the opportunity, I don't want to spend half of that valuable time fighting systems that feel designed to stop me from just playing the game and having fun.
---
Same here. Can‚Äôt remember the last time I went to the ash heap or watoga.
---
It‚Äôs just one of the rare plans so it‚Äôs worth it. I sell them for 500 all day and people (well, more serious players) are usually pretty stoked about it.
---
I literally did a lot of damage when I did it just now lol
---
One way to increase how much I'll buy from you is not scatter your vending machines and hide them. One you've got two out front I'm gonna assume that's it only sometimes I find the hidden ones after looking because their camp said they had more...
---

---
Since beta, the servers have been utter crap. Is the engine at fault or ate the Amazon servers not up to snuff?
---
Also fallout 3 takes place in DC and it got several direct hits by nukes.
---
Yeah, I did a couple Whitesprings runs last night to stock up ahead of time. I did manage to get 10 or so of each from the ghouls inside the burrows, but there's not enough enemies in the area to utilize that harvest.
---
Leftovers are water that weighs less that normal water.
---
Arthropod
---
On ps4
---
I had it one the other night that got stuck at 75% for a solid 10 minutes. Just as I was about to give up it suddenly spiked and completed. How long have you been waiting?
---
They're probably not going to miss your $20
---
Kudos to bethesda as well,  I read magazine racks and bobblehead displays are coming soon
---
About 30 minutes. I just wanna farm legendaries :(
---
How do you remove the stairs tho?? It will say area cant be reached so he have to do the whole floor prob.
---
I walked up to a vendor camp today and there was a lvl 80 glowing deathclaw just hanging out. Luckily I'm too low of a level to mess with it so my first inclination was to slink quietly away. Only to realize, it was his pet!!!!!
---
I Want One!!!!
---
I got three wood pieces in a row today.
---
they glow in the dark too!!!!!!
---
Amen to that, anything that will bring the community together apposed to killing each other!
---
Ppssstt...the brother hood plans are at grafton station now. Don‚Äôt tell anyone else.
---
It would be nice if they just implemented in game txt chat
---
I've got some caps. What are the major and minor?
---
So what armor would defend that?
---
Where did you get the dense plans at out of curiosity? If you remember of coarse.
---
It's also good for quickly radiating myself back down to 20% health as well.
---
This is probably coming. The framework for it is already there with those fermenters and punch bowls. All it takes is a 'weapons stash box' that has an upgraded version of the Lightweight Weapons perk. Assuming containers can be assigned perks, of course.
---
I'd be happy with BSG fixing servers as their first priority. Then attack the dupe glitches.
