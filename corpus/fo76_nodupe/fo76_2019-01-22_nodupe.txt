Mirelurk queens, assaultrons, Yao guai, glowing ones... I have no fear of these anymore. Shotguns are my best friends.

There's a difference between trying to get through your ignorance, which I'd not what I am responding for, and defending myself against the bullshit you're spewing at me. Not surprisingly, you can't see it just as you can't see that you're not the victim but a contributor...
---
This video has been posted over and over here with his channel name and the video plastered everywhere. He dupes. He also promotes selling duped gear for real money via ads. All of his videos are long enough and full of garbage fluff to monetize.
---

---
  
---
He's a garbage youtuber with no other aspirations beyond clicks. If you're willing to sell your viewers hacked goods that cost nothing at exorbitant prices, you're not in the business of being a community asset.
---
Fuck'em.
---
Just the jetpack will for around $2K, you probably looking at  $5-7K for all 3.
---
Dude, I work in retail as a home improvement  specialist at lowes. People get pissed when I am spending 30 plus minutes with another costumer all you can do is politely say wait your damn turn like a normal person and stop being a fricking savage...
---
If they can't handle that there will always be another sale.
---
Stop complaining. It's part of the game.
---
Yes I remember this mod, it saved the day! After some time you could disable auto-updates because they didn't break anything new anyway. 
---
The core audience did nothing but complain. Bethesda biggest mistake was to try to cater to them from the start. They should have made this game exactly like Rust with no pvp restrictions and fully lootable stashes. Then the game might actually had some purpose. It was impossible to please the singleplayer fans with this game anyway as they expected it to be Fallout 5.
---
Invite to team and exit power armor on the same button is even stupider.  I've gotten out of my PA in a nuke zone too many times because I was trying to invite someone.
---
Just irritated getting that karma dropped. Maybe it isnt a big deal as I think it is. 
---
Almost as bad as the electrically powered water collectors somehow sounding like gas motors. 
---
No takers? That‚Äôs odd. 
---
I will have to find that. Thank you so much kind sir.
---
This is super helpful. Thanks for the info noobs like me appreciate it üëèüèº
---
Yeah sorry my man but claiming innocence when getting this kind of windfall won't cut it... you've got to be aware that it's coming from an exploit and even if you were that slow and didn't become aware until you started to get actual feedback about the dupe exploit from your customers (via accusations) that should have at least opened your eyes. I think you had plenty of chance to do the right thing but you chose to bury your head in the sand instead.
---
Ssshhhhhhh! Straight jacket value is a closely guarded secret! 
---
Plants count too
---
Heck yeah or if anything at least put a group finder icon by our name in the social tab. Easy scan through that and see who's lfg. 
---
It would be great if the drop chance distributions of 2* and 3* enemies where known. Currently, the page uses some pessimistic estimates: a 3* legendary drops 1* 60%, 2* 30% and 3* 10% the time, which is based on my own gameplay experience.
---
I agree, defiantly shows he was attacking you, and looks like it shouldn't have issued a wanted status for that.
---
I've been playing on XBox since the stress test.  It's been pretty stable for me overall, until just before the most recent patch.  It had started to crash/disconnect a lot, for maybe two weeks.  It seems to have cleared up with the patch.
---
Haven't had much of a problem with griefers.  Most people are friendly or keep to themselves.  My camp has never been directly attacked, although people have accidentally shot it a couple of times during encounters.
---

---
The higher your int, the higher the starting condition of anything you craft. Int 9 gets my weapons and armor to somewhere around 135% condition (hard to tell exactly), so that will definitely make it last longer. Plasma and fusion cores also go above 100% when you craft them, tho the bonus is less with fusion than with plasma. And of course if you have Power Patcher equipped your PA breaks even slower.
---
No problem.  There are a lot of really beautiful places around the map.  The one also keeps my fast travel costs down.  It's like 16 caps to Watoga with Travel Agent.
---
Do you remember where you got that BoS outfit on the left? I accidentally lost mine :( 
---
I‚Äôve only recently started running the silos (I‚Äôm 450 hours in between all my toons) and I‚Äôm sorta pissed I didn‚Äôt start doing it earlier. I think the activity is fun and diverse.  
---
Couple tips for it (MILD SPOILERS)- It‚Äôs an intensive activity, so you‚Äôll need to prepare, make sure you have enough ammo, chems, etc. make sure you‚Äôre not close to encumberment, you‚Äôll acquire tons of mats and some rewards at the end, and it‚Äôs a bummer to have to turtle walk to a stash. Max hacker is super useful for shutting down the turrets (there‚Äôs a few rooms that have *lots*). The highest level enemies are level 46 assualtrons and 52 gutseys and they can be challenging.  
---
Having said that, it‚Äôs not all that difficult, I‚Äôd say give it a go!
---
Absolute truth since the beginning, I don't resort to swears through social sites especially with random people. I'd rather continue to banter over actually logical sense. You continue to do all I have previously stated focusing on what you want and ignoring the bulk of any message. It has taken quite a bit of both our time to get completely no where, except learn that I am speaking to someone who can't stand by their own words.  Many others have expressed a better point than you, and they said less than half. Please continue.
---
You can buy a game and still hope the features you hate get changed, especially when there are logical reasons behind the need for a change.
---
I leave plans that i already know next to the mr handy in front of vault 76 if a new player is fresh from the vault
---
Here's how i would change the control scheme  
---
R1 = Attack/Shoot                                                                                                                                                                                           
---
L1+R1= Melee Power Attack                                                                                                                                                                          
---
L1 = Aim/Block  
---
L1+/\\ = VATS

---
L2 = Sprint    (I hate L3 for sprinting. My thumb hates me after a weekend if i can't change it away from L3)                                                                                                                                                                                           
---
R2 = Grenade    Hold R2 to Cook Grenade and Set Detonation Timer on Mines up to 15 seconds (Cooking Grenades will go a long way into making Grenades more effective)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
---
R3 = Bash/Kick  (Low Damage, High Stagger)                                                                                                     
---
L3 = Crouch  
---
/\\ = Interact                                                                                                                                                                                             O = Pip-boy

\[\] = Reload, Hold to put weapon away                                                                                                                                                        X = Jump  
---
Touch pad = Map
---
It's only 25, i counted a pg twice. That's still more crashes than days I've owned the game tho, not awesome. 
---
 On a positive note there have been no error crashes since 1/17
---
System?
---
Or rip yourself off and try Medical Bay at Enclave (4800 w/o perks to reduce price to 4200).
---
I see it but it doesn't seem enough of a difference to fuss at - as long as you can repair with Fix It Good you're golden.  The stats difference is only from repairing with Fix It Good - your INT just makes it last a bit longer.
---
The game is like a Kafka novel.
---
I havent been to WhiteSprings in ages! Probably wasnt me, but im glad ya made a new friend!
---
Once the tse nerf happens this wont be an issue. 
---
Yeah - I've only seen one sell at the genetics vendor in the Enclave Bunker but it was more than my paltry 18K caps I had on me at the time... can't remember the exact amount but it was 20K+ for sure - it was for the Carnivore recipe.
---
That's why I posted about it. I got a 50 Cap Bounty on my head for defending myself and my workshop from a Level 23 because...?
---
Sorry to hear that. I'll add some auto-repeats and history filters so you don't crash.

In general, I like that there is almost no focus on caps.  There's no reason to pursue the accumulation of caps.  No economy to break.

Stash size is a server load issue not a qol one.

Oh no worries dude! Really cool tool you wrote though. As a software geek, I appreciate it üëç

I get where you are coming from but playing computer is my alone time of the day. Plenty of people like it that way. 
---
The past 2 or 3 nuke zones I have been to thinking to myself that I‚Äôll play for another 30-60 minutes to get some levels and maybe some good legendary gear and each time I was frozen within a minute or 2 of getting into the nuke zone. Definitely really frustrating... I am on XB1. 
---
One thing I noticed last night is that I left my screen frozen for about 5 minutes before finally force closing, when I logged back in my character was loaded with radiation damage. Luckily I hadn‚Äôt died but kind of messed up that I can freeze on my end, but someone can come up and take all my stuff if I had died and I would have no idea.
---
It‚Äôs used for trading. W stands for Want, and H stands for Have
---
How are you selling for 41? I can only do 25 per with 6 charisma and hardbargin
---
We need paint jobs for The Combat Armor Helmet so it can fuckin Match the Material Upgraded Combat Armor
---
For what it's worth, I learned a lot from you guys' little debate amd enjoyed it thoroughly.
---
You're right, it wouldn't **always** be off, but advertising something like that all the time simply wouldn't happen. For any woman. 
---
Yes they do reset
---
I‚Äôm surprised we can‚Äôt find him alive to be quite honest. I had assumed non feral ghouls would be a huge part of the npcs we encounter, yet we don‚Äôt see a single living one. We have one traveling super mutant merchant, but that‚Äôs it. Every other npc in the game is a robot. Intelligent deathclaws exist in the fallout universe, you can have one as a companion in fallout 2. They should just add an intelligent deathclaw trader in, and have him actually live. And in the lore, they can actually talk. I‚Äôd love more living creatures to talk to, the wasteland is really lonely right now.
---
Same. Less than a dozen crashes. Even fewer disconnects. 
---
The only frustrating bug I ever encountered was killing Ethan or whatever his name was who was always already dead.
---
Hehe yeah that's how you find outlaws despite their chameleon armor. *refrigerator suddenly turns on*
---
I feel you. I can attest to this statement I work for Lowe's as a Specialist a number of years ago and my wife is a Specialist currently. this is a common issue in retail. People can suck its just a fact. Age doesn't matter I've dealt with 60 year old men and women who have less patience than a 5 year old. I sell to tradesman now so life is much easier for me. I don't have to bite my tongue as often. You can't please everyone all of the time--its a thing
---
Why not both?
---
No logical discussion can be had with someone that refuses to read and resorts to bogus accusations instead. As you have refused to substantiate any of your accusations against me on multiple occasions now and continued to insult me, it's safe to conclude you're an ignorant person that's simply too full of his own shit. Good day 
---
I might be mistaken. I'll check it out tonight. It's been several weeks i haven't played. I might be mistaking it with another cloths sell price. Not home ATM, but i will be soon. Will keep you posted.
---
That's how I got my awesome series of Mothman Photos.
---
I get more crap for stating somewrong with this game. You get upvotes for blind faith here.
---
Multiplayer game. Online. Text chat is basic.
---
Trading system + player vending, need text chat.
---
Community and faction based events, need text chat.
---
How about add the functionality, I can chat and make friends more easily and you can turn it off and live in your bubble with everyone muted.
---
If you're on PC, sign me in: LGeo. I'm 160, if it matters.

I like how your buddy decided to blep for the screenshot xD
---
He‚Äôs asking if that‚Äôs the time.
---
Not sure what you are saying here. 
---
Fallout 5 isn't a thing yet. Just saying. We have no idea what that game will be like, hopefully they learn from the mistakes they made in this game...like catering to griefers. 
---
The reason why a whole mess of their "core audience" keep making statements on that fact is simple...we're reminding bethesda who's been buying their games, year after year. 
---
If they devote all this time to catering to _you_, they're making it worse for _us_, and we've been reliably lining their pockets for _years_. 
---
And making a griefer-filled shitshow like 76 is _going_ to cost them goodwill, and it's _going_ to cost them repeat customers business. 
---
Fallout 76 was a mistake, I'll grant you that. PVP shouldn't be in it at all, it should be like any other fallout game...with multi-player elements. 
---
I guess my point is the vitriol is largely fueled by this.  Also cheating/duping.
---
This is imo the reason you don't see this level of rancor on say, the fo4 sub.
---
seen this on PC as well, there is always something new for 76 exciting isnt it....
---
No, resorting to analogies doesn't quite cut it. My eyes were opened after hearing about it. I knew Fallout 76 was plagued with a serious problem once I heard back from people. I continued because of what people said to me, that I was giving back, that I was a new, fun resource they could count on. Players that were jealous resorted to violence and hate speeches. People that understood what I was doing gave me compliments and support, and typically walked away with new weapons and gear. Very few have even attempted to consider what I have said. Instead I read much of the same replies I have already read in others post.
---
Why are we discussing how a bunch of reprogrammed rusty hunks of metal determine cap values of random objects brought to them?  There doesn't have to be any logic to it.
---
If you are on pc use this, it is amazing

I'm like you OP, once i got my 40% speed combat knife i neved stopped stabbing things with it. Irony is i got it from the vendor that talks about "selling sharp bits to stab people with". Everyone kept farming for TSE weapons while i just want to get a 40% speed vampire combat knife.
---
Good day.
---
Good one (hate this area)
---
all these industry insiders here, what an opportunity for an AMA
---
You are saying my post is cancer? I'm confused man.
---
 I don't think Hardcore PVP was ever really something Bethesda planned on.  A simple solution would be for characters for HC-PVP have to be made for only those servers, no back and forth.  Seems the fairest anyway so people do not buff up on easier PVE servers.
---
Sorry im on PC
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Seems gooood
---
Bloodied cultist dagger is my favourite melee. Fast 71 damage. Especially when you have the waitress outfit n a cats head. Makes you look insane
---
In the enclave science wing you can buy serums that give you specific mutations. Make sure not to have starched genes on when you use it. Other players go to areas that allow you to farm rads and have a decontamination arch nearby. 
---
I got really lucky farming my first few (marsupial, scaly skin, chameleon,  and the radioactive explosion one) and bought speed demon and healing factor because I didn‚Äôt want to push my luck.
---
You just need to remember the day that the Nuke Codes destructed, and not plan to Launch Nukes at that time.
---
Or not worry about searching for codes and just Google them. People post them online almost instantly.
---
I have played many games and consoles seem to have connection problems more so than pcs no idea why.

Yes it does scroll to bottom and click on road map

Sure thing, ill be going in as soon as I get another person. Im Slim

No, your strength is lowering due to another glitch related to getting into PA while already wearing armor/underarmor that gives STR bonuses. Again, basic research would have told you this.

---
Lots of games do this. I left FO76 for AC: Odyssey and quickly realized that E talks to quest givers but if a soldier is near by it will also knock them unconscious. Which usually results in some city people attacking me, sometimes their dog attacking me, and typically ends in me murdering the whole town in a fit of rage left over from fallout 76.
---
I tried this three times. Unable to duplicate his results. Calling shenanigans.
---
The drop rate of crap legendaries, coupled with the stash limits and low selling price to vendors, is how they can allow legendaries to drop in such great abundance.  If you start altering that equation, you need to be prepared for adjustments to drop rates since you are giving them value where they had none.
---
370 hours in at this point, and have never seen Marine Armor plans nor Heavy Combat Armor plans. Hell, it took forever to finally get Heavy Leather Torso.
---
If you scroll down the page of Nukes and Dragons there's a "leveling roadmap," you have to enlarge it.
---
If you die before you get your bag the bag disappears. Even if you didn't pick up any other junk. 
---
I just dashboard out. Had 3 scorch beasts and a pack of scorched randomly attack me out of nowhere once, along with another time where a level 207 and a 156 (keep in mind this was literally only a couple weeks after launch, who tf plays it THAT much) instant dashboard.
---
I‚Äôd rather quit out and reload then have to either rebuild or relocate
---
I haven't played since I made this post. I logged in today just to do a few things at my camp only to find a Scorchbeast destroying my camp. I have had my camp in the same place for like 2 weeks and teh worst I have seen till now is Ticks. Now my home is ruined. v.v
---
Depends on the CAMP. Even when I think I've got everything ready for a "quick build", there's usually a bunch of stupid stuff specific to the ground layout that keeps it from working like I expected.
---
Plus, lately moving CAMP means it might double or triple my stored items, and I have to spend a while scrapping all the extra.
---
Mine is ferschnact mask and military officer dress uniform.
---
Oh, god. Totally missed that. thank you!
---
FYSA?
---
Got out of my power armor n tested out some reg armor that's supposed to have rad resistance.. yeah died instantly. N then came back to be spawned in the nuke zone n died again and again with no option to spawn anywhere else. 
---
Thanks Todd
---
its also an issue of number of ids not the quantity of then
---
So you have gone into nuke zone with radshield and lead lined combat armor and taken only 4-5 rad/sec? No power armor?
---
Yup
---
I mean I guess technically, just after A LOT of times trying I've gotten herbavore twice maybe and I  believe it was from taken damage from a ghoul not actually trying
---
Wow that won't from 0 to one million pretty fast lol.
---
My point is that puppies are cute, rainbows are beautiful, and unicorns are awesome :)
---
I definitely see more posts by people moaning about haters and unfair treatment of this game than I see posts from haters.
---
Just saying.
---
All you have to do is make a new character. Problem solved!  Or you could try to buy those items on fo76market or bazaar 
---
Ok, I had a couple pieces each of food &amp; chems and weapon weight reduction armor hanging around, so I ran a test:
---
||Gatling Gun|Lever Rifle|Stimpak|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Unmodified|19.8|7.5|1.0|
---
|2x perk|7.92|N/A|0.4|
---
|2x perk + 1x armor|6.34|6|0.2|
---
|2x perk + 2x armor|4.75|4.5|0.1|
---
So it looks like weapon weight stacking is multiplicative with perks, while food/chems stacking is additive but capped at 90%. Don't have the perks or armors to test everything, but that's a start.
---
So any quantity of weapon weight reduction armor is really good for rifles, or if you don't run weapon weight reduction perks. One food/chems weight reduction armor is good if you run 2-point perks, while the second has half the effect.
---
Well, if you buy serums (3600 caps each) you can get that mutation with starched genes off.  Other than that, you go get irradiated and pray.  Get 2 you like and one you hate?  pray the rad away takes away the one you hated... rinse and repeat until you get a few you like.  Put starched genes back on... grab class freak if the negs are too severe.
---
Lol. Still OK?
---
Read it wrong. Sorry
---
That‚Äôs what I saw in the video.  You were under attack before you killed him.
---
Wooby is a prophet. He is the symbol of hope that human npc's will roam in the wasteland along side players. He is something that most of us dreamed of. Praise be Wooby. Hopefully he will grace us once again if we pray to the god howard.
---
Thanks for the replies everyone 
---
It has the same numbers so theoretically it should work but who knows I have been able to try yet cause heavy
---
Thank you that is EXACTLY what I was hoping for 
---
Yeah, they broke open world to open world elevators completely in the last patch, were alerted to that fact almost immediately, and haven't addressed it yet, even though the entire POINT of "PC first patching" in theory was to catch massive fucking bugs in the new code before pushing to console...which happened how many days ago? 
---
sounds like a great way to lose tons of money fast
---
Yeah I don't really think that's a solution to the problem the OP posted...
---
Kinda silly.  What you really want is to be able to decide who is on your server and that they are like you, be honest!  The better solution is to have server options and selections.  I don't want to have to think about symbols over my head advertising how I feel.
---
It‚Äôs nice to have to save ammo. When you shoot an enemy, you can get up to 7 rounds from their carcass. So you actually add ammo as you play. Makes it easier to save 5.56 and shells. 
---
You found my happy times, add the dirty clown costume, wasnacht mask and make it a sacrificial dagger tho. Love sitting on top of the vault and waiting for new wastelanders to emerge. Jump down, crouch and stab in a circle around them then drop a random somethin and book it into the woods
---
The latest patch seems to have introduced more bugs than it fixed, or at least, more serious ones. 
---
What pisses me off the most is hopping to an event that you need to activate, and then the length of the event is longer than the remaining duration after activation. If swarm of suitors gives 30 minutes to get to activate it at the island, but I only join in the last four minutes and am the first person to activate the island, and the swarms come over a five minute interval, set the time remaining to at least five minutes.
---
Some events do this, some don't. Uranium Fever for example has a time limit to activate it but the timer resets to the length of the event once activated.
---
You want me to make my own door? Message received loud and clear friend.
---
I can't wait for proper player vending to become a thing.
---
Boo hoo hoo.
---
You got your point across perfectly. One thing that stands (to me) as evidence of how few people actually want to do PVP in this game is that you never see "looking for game" posts for hunter-hunted.  In other words, bgs created an entire game mechanic with that radio station to allow people to hunt each other who want to, and yet I never see people trying to get four people on the same server who want to do that.
---
Changing weapon or armor level should be a thing since it's so damn hard to get a decent set of 3 star legendary effects, maybe using end-game materials like fluxes. Fluxes need more ways to use anyway.
---
I really find it interesting to look at the wealthy, entitled, asshats in the resorts who became the raiders, and then look at the type of shit-stain that actually turns into a griefer. Makes you wonder. 
---
Easy way to farm caps, Nuk wight springs collect all the flux and sell it for 15 caps a piece 
---
Anyone else?
---
Got gud
---
The marine tactical helmet sells for 32 caps for me with my chr/perks, and is simple to make.  Good enough for me if I don't have anything else to sell to cap out vendors for a day (which is rather rare considering the overall low vendor cap).
---
He is only there to watch us and log out every action....kill the snakeüòÇü§£üòÇ
---
Well im pretty sure they made enough money and recurring transactions through mtx that they could afford better servers no? If that is indeed the issue
---
Really? 
---
I guess this is from photo mode unless consoles have some majorly different third person view to PC. 
---
In terms of fidelity it doesn't look "better" (subjective) compared to 1440p I run the game at, have you lowered a lot of settings to be able to run it at 4k? Did you create a customs settings ini for graphics settings (I did and it messed up visuals after they patched fov settings etc in).
---
Also this could have a bunch of screenshot settings/filters applied (in game). I have some screenshots that look nothing like in game when I am running around 1st/3rd person due to settings/filters in photo mode. Not PCMR'ing but compared to friends who have it on PS4 and Xbox there is a difference when you ramp the settings up on PC (though there are some pretty bad textures and graphical errors in this game on all platforms).
---
&gt;Really only useful in nuke zones
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
Only *necessary* in nuke zones maybe.
---
But ~300 DR is pretty fucking far from useless no matter where you are.
---
Man you're not wrong. Found a +40% swing speed Hunter's Combat Knife the other day, and after swinging my hammer so long it feels awfully fun.
---
Just drop a nuke there where their camp is. I'm all for being nice but you cant hog enemies especially in a high spawn location like white springs. Sometimes being a little passive aggressive in game helps people like that understand that the world doesn't revolve around them. Plus you're helping everyone else level up because well, white springs is xp heaven
---
Agree. The durability on the Gatling Plasma is just pathetic right now.
---
...both, for different reasons?
---
I've been sitting in the same room as someone i've played with, gone to do protest march, and one of us sees protestors and one doesn't. Same internet, same everything...and the game is flawed no matter what. 
---
&gt;they are all like that
---
Yes, they are. And not just game subs.
---
This is actually pretty fun. It's interesting to click and roll until I get something my character would actually use.
---
884 rolls to get my grail of a 2-shot handmade.  I honestly don't want the explosive because even with 2 ranks of Fireproof I kill myself when wearing a hazmat suit and cut my health by 25% or so when a ghoul gets right in my face.  I could also drop the demo expert \*\*\*\*\* and use the perks for other things.  Somehow I managed to land a 2-shot \* lever gun. I'm certain I've gotten well over 1000 legendary drops.  It took me 2019 rolls to get one in your program.
---
[https://imgur.com/jtsS4gw](https://imgur.com/jtsS4gw) Just to prove I'm not blowing smoke.
---
I gave up after 3000 rolls trying to get a TSE rifle of any kind.
---
Yes at that time 
---
I'll be your huckleberry. Ign is fishhelmet
---
Excuse my ignorance but what is a TSE? Is that the gun that shoots explosive rounds? I see alot of higher level players with that but have no idea what it is. 
---
Can i interest you in a Medics Assaultron Head?
---
Well be glad that your message was loud and clear to Bethesda. You will get your "talk to NPC simulator" in Fallout 5 exactly like you wanted after the backlash you gave them. God forbid they made one game that caters to another audience.
---
You ready to go?
---
Why are you talking in third person? You are the OP.
---
Yes you are. I'll gladly help you in game. That craps annoying 
---
Close. With the cowboy hat and the preacher‚Äôs vestments I was going for the Pale Rider vibe. Now I want to find a grey suit. 
---
I'm definitely up for that. I'll add you.
---
You can only repeat "Events" and "Daily Quests." 
---
Your explanation doesn‚Äôt relate in this situation you do realize. There is no hidden mechanic that makes an armor crafted with higher intelligence take less durability loss from damage, which is what you‚Äôre insinuating. 
---
you like that word. lol
---
Nobody said anything about haters. Just organization. When I sort by new it's a decent mix of "who does" or "can" etc questions and "suggestions" or "this is broken", but as voting happens there's a clear victor when it comes to the commonwealth postings lol. And I'm not saying any of it is illegitimate, again just organization.  
---
All of this is true but functionally irrelevant as long as nuke zones are the only real endgame content.
---
10th rolls Legendary Mirelurk Queen ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

---

Gain brief health regeneration when you hit an enemy
---
40% increased swing speed
---
Take 40% less damage while power attacking
---
As a melee: Omg why do you taunt me 
---
I just got your request. REady when you are
---
Frankly, if they did what they promised and made it so you COULD avoid PVP, it wouldn't be an issue. But as it is, level 150 griefers are running around one shoting low level players, because murdering people who can't do anything about it is "fun". 
---
Instead of an enjoyable experience...no one's happy, really. 
---
Same experience here man. I run into someone. Moment of awkwardness and then you wave and everyone moves on. 
---
I have like 330dr in my normal armor and it's not even the best set i can wear. So you can get power armor defenses while not in power armor
---
Guilty. I chucked away a medic pump shotgun with VATS bonuses at Whitesprings. Team discussion was "well, no-one does that build, do they".
---
Are you guys suiciding her corpse or something?
---
So you‚Äôre saying you crafted power armor with a max out intelligence and there‚Äôs barely a difference and not enough to even increase the damage resistance? Then why act like it‚Äôs a thing, there‚Äôs little to no difference, basically none unless you count the microscopic bar size increase from having maxed intelligence over an easily achievable 20-25
---
Lucky hole mine is great for lead, especially if you have excavator pa.
---
What compelling reason is there to use a jetpack "against" SBQ? Flying VATS falcon punch?
---
Most camps? Nine times out of ten you can't re-place a camp unless it's a 1x1 or maybe 2x1 footing. Lots of people build custom to a spot that won't replace unless it's in *exactly* the same position it was before, which there's about a 0% chance of doing. 
---
Yeah there are some workarounds to having your camp trashed, but like the OP said, sometimes none of them are realistic and you end up farming nuke zones to repair your stuff. That's lame as hell. 
---
Just saw a thread about that today. It caps at 20%
---
Oh this. Please this. Why can't we scrap them? It would make all the bullets I use taking down really big enemies at least worth something other than XP.
---
i thought about making a new character for it , but it would take lots of them because it's almost an end game item, and thank you for telling me about the FO76market.
---
But I need my junk!
---
You have coherent color schemes for the living room and bedroom. What is this sorcery? 
---
Yup, I'd be there with ya. 
---
I know a burn FCs sprinting, but never noticed it for Melee VATS. I usually use VATS on small enemies, Mole Rats, Rad Rats etc.
---
The special meaning is that its robot challenges, and its binary, what is the most basic language that robots operate under? binary. Thats it, theres no other hidden meaning to it
---
I‚Äôm on PC and it‚Äôs pretty much the same experience, but every so often I get a random person that walks up out of the blue and wants to trade, it‚Äôs pretty odd.
---
It won't count as a shotgun and it won't benefit from shotgun perks, but it will function like one.  I use it as a shotgun on my heavy weapons guy.
---
This reminds me of when I would play skyrim doing the dark brotherhood quests. I would place a fire rune on their bed, leave, and just wait for the objective to be completed.
---
Would give 5 months max.
---
Its...the endgame...hahhhah
---
They just reset 
---
I had someone do this recently.  The shower really stings.
---
I understand that some PVP oriented folks do it to accrue a high bounty.  I'm not super mad about repairing my base with common stuff, but please leave the decon shower and crops alone.  It's a real pain in the ass to fix and repair.
---
I used to feel the same way.
---
I spent a LONG time doing exactly the same thing. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs locked to real time however I have never had patrol duty start at night in game. It‚Äôs always daytime. Good luck. It took me maybe 15 or so tries to get that plan. 
---
Codes reset 27 minutes ago as of this comment. They reset midnight Monday night UK time. 7PM EST
---
Yes.
---
Camo effect?   
---
Curiosity very much piqued 
---
Def. should be able to repeat quests. I am one of the I am sure many people who scrapped or didn't receive their set of Ultracite armor that is said to be rewarded for Belly in the Beast (the reward says 'power armor chassis').
---
At least you made it through the silo. I've been putting off that quest. Just hit level 90 and that's all I've got left so I decided to do it today. Just finished repairing mainframe and disconnect. 
---
Was a little ticked. Figured I'd finally try it because servers seemed more reliable lately. So a few hours later I'm trying to log in and as soon as load screen pops up I get Shutdown Imminent 5 minutes. I'm on PS4 but I see no one talking about it on here.
---
As a fyi the builder isn't accurate.
---
It will show to d save levels then spend them on perks that unlock from gaining levels, which isn't actually possible.
---
not at all, when I build this, I didn't push my int up to crazy high levels. I just bumped it up a bit, to show the effect. I couldn't be bothered trying to push an entire 40+ int build at 4am for a reddit post.
---
Damn. All that work for nothing. 
---
&gt; For all intensive purposes
---
I think you mean "for all intents and purposes"
---
I run a VATS build and just got a medics handmade. I can crit every 3rd shot, and almost never need to use stimpacks unless really getting tooled on by packs of ferals
---
Hmm. I might give that a go. I tend to go do a loop of toy heavy areas, areas with a lot of can chimes, etc. it's not that it's "hard to get" lead, it's just the only thing I find myself regularly going out of  my way to gather. Well, that and, on some rare occasions, plastic for shells. 
---
You know how long ive been searching for thr keypad?!
---
If you wander up and loot someone's lunchbag, do you get tagged with a Bounty, if you were not involved with their death?
---
I didn't bump my int up very far to show this. It was a quick demo that int made a difference, rather than a full 40+ int vs only 15.
---
WOOBY GANG
---
yea ive read speed demon overrides any other speed effects you get from other means, shame too i wanted to try a sonic build at some point
---
People on Reddit post unfounded rumors.
---
Someone writes an article about those rumors.
---
People on reddit link to the article.
---
This is the cycle of how fake news spreads. 
---
We live in a time where instant gratification is king.
---
Especially on the internet.
---
As far as these shitbirds are concerned, you are not a person. You are a thing on the internet that has what they want, at their convenience.
---
These people do not deserve your concern, or your attention, or your stress.
---
If anyone gets more demanding than a "Any idea how much longer," tell them to kindly go fuck themselves. You owe them nothing. They need to learn that being a shitbird makes people treat you like a shitbird.
---
Their parents failed them. Don't continue the cycle.
---
As an energy weapon user, I'd rather waste a battery than waste durability.
---
[Level 50 ain't everything.](https://imgur.com/UhoZE9G.jpg)
---
That worked! Thank you SO much!
---
I don't know what that means, sorry. We just take her down as we always do, shoot at her until she dies, someone cripple her wings so she stays down, and is easier to damage. 
---
She dies, we all rush to her, loot never loads, and she despawns. Less than 2 minutes later, we all DC, or CTD.
---
Morgantown would be better imo
---
Same experience here on PS4.  Had one incident in my 200+ hours since BETA.  I‚Äôve rarely ever even accepted or given direct trades just ‚ÄúHey you want this?  Koo.  Can I get that?  Thanks‚Äù
---
I  am with you.  Maybe it is a PC vs Console thing?   I have overall been impressed with the interactions I have had with other players. 
---
How much radiation are you taking? I have quite a few mutations and I've found it's a very small chance per rad that you take. I would take about 85-90% of my health bar in radiation, and I would get a mutation on average of three to five health bars worth.
---
Also, if you've gotten a mutation recently (like herbivore) you have to either server hop or wait about an hour or so before you can get another one.
---
There are a few good places to farm for mutations but I chose the Emmet Mountain Disposal site just to the east of whitesprings on the map. If you go inside the building there are tons of barrels and a rad shower to the left through the doors. Take off starched genes, stand by the barrels til you're almost dead, step over to the rad shower, re-equip starched genes (if you have a mutation you want to keep), shower off your rads, and repeat til you get a mutation, then server hop and try again.
---
I wonder if that works for jetpack too
---
yep
---
Yup. Nukacrypt is the easiest
---
Sorry I left the server. My inventory is glitched or something. I had about 12 silo codes and they all disappeared. They are new also so im gonna get in another server 
---
yeah i got it and they should let you change the name of armor chassis or at least rename it themselves, because when i try to look for a specific power armor i have to get every set out and lay them down
---
Virtually everywhere else, people accept there is something wrong with this game. They accept that Bethesda did a very bad thing and hasn't owned it. They accept that this isn't a very good sign and the rate at which things are moving isn't very good either.  
---
/r/fo76 is cult like. You can't talk about the negatives of this game, people tune it out and down vote you. There is no support group for those that are frustrated but still trying.  
---
If On  PS4 we‚Äôre at prep just waiti for someone to post new code 
---
I crashed after getting Ultracite PA put on my chassis. Get back in, put on my armor, it‚Äôs back to Excavator. Ultracite is gone. Vanished.  I‚Äôm annoyed. 
---
I just sort of suck at aiming.
---
kinda wished it wouldnt give a talk icon since it gives you away if you are stealthy being/hunting wanted
---
&gt; Stash size is a server load issue not a qol one.
---
pure nonsense.  fiction.
---
To be fair, ESO is run by Zenimax, who has nothing to do with fallout, just elder scrolls stuff ;)
---
We built more than one PA, with different INT, had them both fully overhealed and they had different DR/ERs.
---
Which is why I make the post.... now that doesn't make Int actually useful, since you only need to do it once, and then your PA is good for the rest of the game, and you won't actually use anything else you build.
---
So YOU don't want to run a high Int crafter, but, it is useful to know a person who is, just so they can make your PA once.
---
I don't use a mic and can hear people talk to me no problem
---
Same here. 
---
You look offline though :)
---
Great points IMO.  What‚Äôs the right next end-game system?  Instanced dungeons with lockouts?  Once per week you can kill boss X and receive...what?  That‚Äôs the existential question of this game right?  What‚Äôs worth getting or doing?
---
It‚Äôs one thing to tune an end-game, it‚Äôs another to try to bolt it on.  How they can create an ecosystem where there are things worth getting?  PVP?  They‚Äôd need to fix/change so much just to have a platform for compelling PVP engagements that would make players want upgrades?
---
PlayStation 4: Since the last update I can't play more than about an hour before being disconnected. Recently I have been disconnected at a horrible rate of about every five minutes. It's at a point where I am actually unable to play. I love the game but this is ridiculous.
---
Honestly it's a lot of fun to just take a break from adventuring and just find a group of players and share a bunch of spare plans. Someone else gets a cool plan they might not have, and I get the satisfaction of making someone else happier while not wasting plans.
---
I'm also on Xbox, and it's been 98% nice or neutral encounters, and 2% me getting one-shotted by a total stranger.
---
To use these codes do you have to have all missions done?
---
Honestly, it's a smart play on Bethesda's part if they do. So long as they give something back to the people who spent money to buy the game already I don't see much wrong with it.
---
Either a collection of exclusive ingame items, emblems, or maybe a perk card would be cool. Or they could go the straight on route of gifting a bunch of atoms to everyone who's already bought a copy.
---
I agree completely with you.
---
Depends what else you are doing. Our group doesn't use Bobbleheads, and we have taken on the queen by ourselves.
---
[It's one more](https://youtu.be/KOO5S4vxi0o?t=18)
---
Which still begs the question of why I got Wanted for it.
---
Sure just invite me to a team whenever you're ready.
---
The mainframe cores have always been buggy/laggy for me. 
---
You have to remove the damaged ones from the mainframe then either repair them or find new ones. I would guess that if they‚Äôre not marked as quest items (since you don‚Äôt have the objective) it may allow scrapping them. 
---
I‚Äôm also certain it allows scrapping of repaired ones. I‚Äôve had all 15 damaged ones, repair them all, then find I only have 10. I think it‚Äôs cannibalizing ones already repaired to make others.  I know for a fact it does (or did, haven‚Äôt done it in a while) this with the ignition cores for the RockHound excavator, so it‚Äôs not a stretch to think it would do it here too. 
---
Its in response to the other guy, I am saying that the OP of other posts get insulted a lot.
---
Where the hell does one find it? I‚Äôm beginning to think public events? I‚Äôve never found a plan by scrapping before. 
---
Happens to me too. And it stays, zone, fast travel, always there. Have to completely exit the game to get rid of it. 
---
Good god. I know reddit is an echo chamber but YouTube and gaming journalism too?
---
People sell mutations for 400-500 caps on the FO76 Reddit bazaar, I got 11 out of 13 mutations using the serums.
---
Scrap loop. Seriously.
---
It took me quite a while.
---
I've always wanted Iguana on a Stick!
---
I guess you only need me for the queen, right? When are you planning to summon her?
---
Well shit. Thanks!
---
If you plan on using power armor, do a two handed build. If not, then do an unarmed build. I have an instigating deathclaw gauntlet that I can 1 shot most enemies with.
---
That's a good point &amp;mdash; is there any literature on just how much durability you lose per bash?
---
Your experience has been almost identical to mine then except one time I crashed out. I've had very few disconnects and have never had a negative encounter with another player.
---
I've never seen marine armor plans in vendors, only plans for their mods. All my marine armor plans have come from finding them in the wild, either hunting around Harper's Ferry or the trainyard east of Watoga station. Heavy combat does spawn at vendors, want to say ended up with the full set while also looking for BoS combat while server hopping Grafton station and the responder vendor inside Grafton. This was all post 40.
---
I'll usually pull about 700 lead scrap. Keeps me going for a while. It is the best place I have found. I have a lead extractor in my camp so that helps supplement.
---
PC, crappy internet, mediocre machine- no issues.
---
And we love you ‚ô•Ô∏è 
---
But plastic is the enemy.
---
Whoa, this is legit the fourth or fifth post I've seen on this today. What 4chin post is bringing you guys out? Is it a troll discord? Disgruntled youtuber?
---
2015 was three years before 2018.
---
There it is!
---
Some of those people would like to see what weapons you have to see if they can take you.
---
Codes just reset 40 minutes ago.
---
Xbox player, but since I am usually only playing for 2-3 hours at a time it is not really put under a lot of stress.
---
* Have had 1 disconnect - More likely related to bad internet
---
* Have had the invisible enemy glitch several times, but not since the Dec 11 patch
---
* Thought I had griefers trashing my camp in the pylon below Camp McClintock, but it turns out it was just my turrets sniping innocent SuperMutants walking down the road and attracting them to the camp.
---
* had once issue playing with my son where he couldn't see me when we zoned into Charleston, made it an interesting 15-20 minutes until I killed it and reloaded.
---
* Had one guy 3x my level running around my camp trying to convince me to hit him, but he didn't have any wanted or anything so I finally just changed servers.
---
* One shitty bug I;ve had 2 or 3 times lately is where my compass and map indicator will be reversed. Map arrow and compass says I'm marching north, but I check 5 minutes later and my still-pointing north arrow is about an inch or so south of where I was. Just talking to an NPC fixes that for some reason.
---
That's really it. Nothing I would consider game-breaking but I'm more of a casual player anyway so any hiccups are more amusing than frustrating.
---
Patrol Duty isn‚Äôt a daily, it‚Äôs an event. 
---
The problem is, there‚Äôs a relatively short timer on it and if anyone walks within range of the prison, it could activate. If they wander off, it doesn‚Äôt stop the timer. Once it expires, the event has failed and has to wait until its ready to pop back up again. There‚Äôs also another event that occurs there in rotation (Jail Break). 
---
sorry for saying that, but if it's not happening really soon, I'll have to go offline 
---
Sorry, don't get the reference.  I didn't play it.
---
They reset 
---
Crazy. What system?
---
On ps4 i see loot before her body finishes ragdolling
---
No, it is just that higher int built armor has a higher durability to begin with. Once you overheal it by 200% it goes even higher.
---
Nope, free for all.
---
[Plus you have your own theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_DVS_303kQ)
---
Thanks. It still isn't giving me the objective, but I've discovered that leaving this small designated area is what is deleting my cores. If I don't leave then it's letting me place the new ones in the slots. ü§û
---
They should also be worth less to some of the fools buying them communities/reddit/markets
---
sounds good, although ive tried logging off and on several times now and all of my codes vanished. I have no clue why. I spent an hour earlier getting the 8 codes for Bravo.
---
Oh look, another website nobody has ever heard of who's only source is a YouTuber. Not an insider, not a journalist, just an angry neckbeard that's already spread misinformation about this game.
---
Oh, had no idea.  Good to know. 
---
Now I know you are trolling lol
---
Thanks man! Im still after the elusive toilet plan
---
I think I got it doing events like Line in the Sand or turning in Technical Data. If you are on PC I also gave a spare I can give you after I get off work. 
---
Nope.  I'm sorry, it works on PC.  :/
---
I'm going to go with Skyrim didn't have weapons you were sustaining fire with. So in FO4/76 you need a different button it you're using an automatic weapon like a rifle or heavy gun.
---
You're right, i was mistaken. I was able to sell them for 21 Caps with 5 Chr and 2\* Hard Bargain
---
He's the antagonist of black ops two. He also liked shooting people with shotguns in the kneecaps
---
Well, you only need it to be done once for the lifetime of your Character.
---
Your X-01 built by a 40+ int person will be an X-01 built by a 40+ int person in a years time.
---
More mods may have come out, but it is still worth doing once.
---
pro-tip - Put a foundation directly below where you want the windmill. As long as there is enough space for the windmill to turn green indoors, try and put it on the foundation and the will mill should "Land" on the roof where you want it.    
---
This rule applies to Fusion Generators, Wall Pass-though Conduits, and Decontamination Showers
---
In which case the simple solution is to make scrapped or bulk junk items weigh less (or nothing) in the stash since many of us have nothing but junk in the stash. Then it‚Äôs only tracking a specific number of stacks.  
---
zero weight on bulked items would be a massive incentive to bulk scrap. 
---
On PC. Sorry, I should have specified, I just thought it was obvious from the CTD (crashing to desktop). 
---
As soon as I can figure out why all of my silo codes have glitched out of my inventory at the same time. Im trying to log off and on repeatly. I got them all today so I cant understand why they are gone. I invited someone to my team and then poof they are gone. I will send for you if i can figure this out lol
---
I'm in the exact same boat. I'm all stabby-stab all over the place nowadays. Whenever I'm in Watoga, I go robot-stabbin';  in the Whitespring club house, I leave a small mountain of dead ghouls around me, all stabbed to death.
---
I once had a guy stop me during the All Rise quest just to tell me when I get on the rooftop there will be a bunch of high-level robots, I help off on the quest for a few levels. Same here man.
---
Well if you sell to all the vendors every day for 18 days you‚Äôre already above the 25k limit. Assuming you don‚Äôt buy anything and don‚Äôt find caps elsewhere, that is. It‚Äôs a pretty low limit. 
---
I don‚Äôt seem to *need* more than 25k caps right now, but I‚Äôm hoping in the future they make some of the higher end plans more prevalent at a much higher price. Also, if you‚Äôre buying a nice gun from somebody they can sell it for up to the full 25k, so you shouldn‚Äôt have to max out your caps and/or they have zero caps to both be able to fully transfer the caps for the trade. 
---
TIL  I'm not as clever as I believed I was.  That's another one I'm gonna have to adopt when the need arises. Thanks!
---
Yup, it‚Äôs pretty annoying. I feel like adding the timer would be a huge QoL change for the game.
---
yup but im not that game balancer for BGS
---
Ah, pro tip indeed. UnfortunatelyThere is not enough space for the windmill to turn green indoors, and I‚Äôm not about to rebuild my base to do so. 
---
All of my Bravo codes were from today. How could they reset? It takes a week doesnt it
---
thanks man
---
Wow dam u win lol that's a great quote.
---
You might need to check again. I had this issue once in FO4 want I adapted to overcome it. I also use the weapon butt on my heavy guns when things get in my face with grenades equipped and I haven't blown myself up. And yes, I'm on PC.
---
Sounds dark.

I, on the other hand, am a cuddly ball of fun.  ‚ú®üåàü¶Ñüåà‚ú®
---
The main issue is that the pool is too large in general. 1:200 chance on average just for a handmade to begin with. I'm not aware of any data if certain enemy types and/or location combinations have far more reduced loot pool or non 50-50 armor-weapon distributions. I guess if such exist, we've already heard about them.
---
I could, of course, reduce the webpage's pool to simulate dedicated enemy types at locations, but legendary spawn is not guaranteed to exist or up to the desired level, so at the end, chances may not be better.
---
The irony of people trying to only talk about the positives have turned this into the most toxic gaming community I've ever been a part of. Even if CS:GO is yelling Cyka Blyat in my face, I don't have to report anything or talk with anything about the game not working. I can mute virtually everything and just play the fucking game.  
---
This is an MMORPG where there is no facilitation of a community. The community that was pretty decent at the beginning all left because they were burned too many times. The community that has stayed are either hopeless like me, or brain dead to all that has happened. 
---
It's pretty good. You still break limbs but take no damage.
---
Yeah - and it's more interesting to be halfway through the story when ghoul starts spanking your ass from out of nowhere. ;\^)
---
The problem with 76, specifically, is more balance and pacing. You'll be trucking along through an abandoned whatever-the-hell, killin' super mutants and hunting for desk fans, and then you hit a terminal with 15 logs to wade through *right then*. Heck, at least give us the option to transfer the data to our pip-boys for some pleasant campsite reading!
---
I do it a lot
---
ACCIDENTALLY
---
I‚Äôve only just recently picked this perk up (for the same reason as you) and I only have the first tier, doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything yet as far as I can tell though. 
---
thanks for watching
---
No problem!
---
At the end... The "plz call" and " multipass" are quotes from that movie...
---
Where did you buy the ‚Äútable lamps‚Äù at? I found ‚Äúresort lamps‚Äù but not the table ones. 
---
I'll check it out thanks!
---
Every Monday
---
Oh, that makes sense. When you leave the silos (other than from death) the silo specific items from your inventory (like the biometric card) are removed to reset silo progression. 
---
I once helped a friend get to the end and begin launch prep. Our goal was near simultaneous launches (on the same spot, we were trying to troll a bit). I left, and completed a different silo. While I was gone he got hung up with prep because the game bugged and was flooding the control room with bots, probably 2-3x normal. I launched and returned to help and had to go through the biometric stuff for that silo again. 
---
It's midnight Tuesday gmt for all codes.
---
Monday‚Äôs are the reset times depends on where your at , for me they just reset less than hour ago 
---
Think about it this way. It resets at a certain time in one place however, maybe that place is 5 hours behind you meaning, you got the codes and then 5 hours later, it resetted
---
&gt;Nobody said anything about haters
---
I suggest you re-read your "P.S." lol
---
There was serious delay in pickups and them being destroyed for me
---
Yeah just seems random, you get them on those first few missions and then i havnt noticed a pattern. I really need a power armour plan..
---
Would love brick wall plans too.
---
Meh
---
I've been wondering what people like about this event? the 3 star legendaries are always level 40 arent they ?
---
Yeah I'm gonna call BS on him 'destroying a big portion' of your CAMP with only a 20 Cap bounty.
---
The bounty goes up 10 caps for every object destroyed, no matter the size. 
---
So it's either you're seriously whining this guy destroyed 2 objects at your CAMP or you're doing some mad stretching with the details over here.
---
Well, it's Monday, so the codes were resetted.
---
Ok, dude, you'd surprised anyway. Google for how these codes work :) I guess you won't be able to launch anything today )
---
...yeah, the best legendary armor you can manage will have equivalent DR to power amror you can find chilling anywhere.
---
I'm not trying to say PA is better than regular armor on paper. It isn't.
---
But as far as current content in this game is concerned? PA is MORE than enough protection for any and everything. Calling it "useless" is hilariously misguided.
---
I haven't left the silo. If I leave the mainframe room, they get deleted.
---
uhhhh, didn't the Enclave genetics scientists create the Scorchbeasts tho?
---
But you can just make more characters and shift the caps to them. There really is no effective limit, just more inconvenience. 
---
That's one of the most paranoid things I've read today. And I've been on Reddit way too much today too!
---
Remember it doesn't matter if somebody tries to 'take you'. Just walk away and they can't damage you properly.
---
Just 3-4 months of bootcamp living with the same 40 people and seeing only them everyday has most ready to strangle each other by the time graduation comes.  
---
I'd say the fact that the vault dwellers made it to 25 years without already killing each other is an achievement within itself. 
---
Break limbs, but no damage when it‚Äôs rank 3  with padded torso mod, or rank 2 with dense torso mod
---
Hope y‚Äôall get diarrhea so we can see the end of this convo ASAP 
---
Sweet pic.  I really didn't think I would care for the photo thing, but it is really pretty damn cool.
---
Yes?
---
Or for easily avoiding the mass of mobs on the ground while you blow them up with explosives like a normal person, but I actually like your idea more.
---
But...but...what about all the free DLC?
---
Fusion cuisine isn't nuc--oh.
---
Sounds tasty!
---
I see mixed good and bad ideas in this thread, so I think it would be nice if we had explained the perspective of both sides, because understanding it is crucial for an effective fix to current situation.
---
The punishments are punishments only early in game, and serve no purpose lategame besides being an unwanted nuisance for non-PvPers, or a way to initiate PvP event on map, by displaying cap bounty for all other players to see.
---
The source of the issue is that there are no efficient ways to display interest in PvP besides nuking somebody else camp. If people could just put bounty on anybody head, and pay caps for the one who claims it, people would be putting bounty on their own head if that was more convenient than nuking a camp down.
---
Whenever I stumble upon a series of turrets pointing inside Golf Club windows (kinda separate topic), I gladly take one for the team and aim my artillery in there. My bounty then triggers nearby people and often they come try themselves. This can lead to back-and-forths that last for half an hour and are tons of fun.
---
Hmm. That seems a bit extreme, but at the same time, why leave the mainframe room?  Looking for circuits?
---
I play on Xbox. There haven't been too many douchebags in the hundreds of hours I've played so far. Maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones. I think it's fun to drop care packages for low level players. We are all from the same vault, after all.
---
Wooby is the Mothman's final form.

But what if I told you that you don't need to dodge them? ;)

I just want the basic rug with the split ends to put over the top of the the upper wood sections (2nd floor) that connect to the various stair sections.  
---
Point not missed. . . . People can do what they want.
---
I applaud the random guy every time who uses a mic and says hey  everyone come over here and tag this legendary so I can 1 shot him üòÇ üëèüèº
---
I'm telling you they need to replace the death paper bag with a flaming pile of skulls.
---
Nope, if there is anything that does drain the Shit out of my cores even with double duration perk, it‚Äôs jet pack.
---
Yeah. Just finished, now looking for security door.
---
I'd say in-game, everyone is having a good time exploring and doing quests.
---
Online though, it's kind of a shitshow. (I wish it wasn't, believe me) 
---
FML, I honestly thought that you have a week per code that the timer starts when you pick it up. Guess i was wrong &gt;\_&lt;
---
I logged in for the first time in weeks after the 1/10 patch just to be disconnected 4 times over the night. Haven't gone back since. I check this Reddit about every week to see if they've made adjustments. 
---
Human NPCs were originally going to be in but they took them out (NoClip doc) so that it's more special meeting another player.
---
I do think there will be humans in some sort of DLC though.
---
Sameeee! I‚Äôm in site bravo and used two nuclear keycards üòê 
---
I like 76 but there's still too much of it that's broken for me to play much for a while. I still have the 'launch nuke' quest left and have not entered a silo yet.    
---
I've grouped less than 10 hours and not for lack of trying. I prefer solo, but there's not much left.    
---
My main Beta char has a LOT of stuff and while I have given away some, I've had to sell or drop off stuff at train stations. If don't care what level you are but I can help in many ways.    
---
I play on PC.
---
It‚Äôs the giant blue door beside the mainframe you were repairing. Go into the computer and tell it to open. Can‚Äôt do it until all 15 cores have been repaired or replaced. 
---
If you or anybody else happen to be on Xbox and want to sell your extra plans for a reasonable cheap price like what‚Äôs mentioned, I‚Äôll happily buy a lot/all of them. I‚Äôm thinking about creating a shop that revolves around helping people with all things crafting, and gifting newer players potentially useful plans
---
Gt: UtricularShoe5
---
Shoot me a message!
---
You can manually go into quests and turn the event off and deactivate it for yourself but I believe this will cause it to quit appearing on the map until you activate it again 
---
Isn't it fun when you're so close that the skull is spinning around on your compass and YOU STILL CAN'T SEE IT?
---
Mine won‚Äôt let me stash it. 
---
Want to know an easier way? Forget the codes. They are the same for everyone. Google it. Thats what I did. I'd rather google it then do Hide And Seek And Destroy 8 times
---
Thanks. Finally got it. Now for the hard part? 
---
Lol!! Same here. Thank goodness I have 5 more. 
---
Scorched Earth!
---
End game event with no real gimmicks, lackluster loot, and is a pain in the ass to trigger. It bugs out a decent portion of the time (when it's not causing localized lag) and consumes a lot of resources for little reward. The minion spawns help recoup some of those losses, if you can loot them in time. 
---
Plus it's the only one that gets more difficult when you do it with friends, has scaling difficulty depending on who triggers the queen (so you're better off launching the nuke but letting a low level character run in first) and punishes you when folks show up but don't contribute, making it even more of a grind.
---
It's also the only event that will really suffer with upcoming damage nerfs, ensuring it's even more tedious than it currently is. Might be exciting the first few times you do it but then it's just a grind. 
---
You can stop tracking them from the data menu of the pip boy.
---
I been playin in passive mode to avoid griefers, and some people unload a bunch of shots with TSE and do no damage, then someone will come along and kill me in one hit, so i don‚Äôt even know how this game works anymore 
---
Oh, well now I don't feel so bad for losing it. :)
---
I never called it useless, I'm saying it's either extremely underpowered, or armor is extremely over powered. Because lore wise, power armor is supposed to be enough to take on 50+ Chinese communist scum, and a communist tank all single-handedly
---
It'd be easier with a pop up plus I'm not starting the timer early on the power plant events as it takes awhile to set up and defend against the first set of attackers
---
Launch prep. There‚Äôs 14 (I think) turrets in the control room. You can shut them off before entering though. 
---
Once inside you‚Äôll start prep upstairs. It will spawn section chiefs to do the prep. Other bots will spawn to destroy them, including Colonel Gutsy‚Äôs and Assaultrons (including the stealth variety, so watch out). 
---
This is happening to me too, in the last day or two. It usually takes 20-30 seconds for my quick-boy to pop up on screen and once it does I know I'm G2G.
---
Ps4. Mostly positive besides my camp being leveled once. Someone else tried it a second time, but was easily outgunned. 
---
Some people are desperate for ammo.
---
I haven't run into many either, but you will know them by the groups they travel in. If you see a wanted guy accompanied by some unwanted people, they're waiting for you to come for the bounty and then they will jump in. If a guy comes up asking to trade and doesn't offer anything, he's checking your gear to see how much of a challenge you are. These days I just assume people near my base are scouting it out. Probably a bit too paranoid.
---
The stutter is annoying. Otherwise... I really rarely crash. No issues with scorched queen apart from slow to load loot sometimes. Erm. Yeah I think that's it.
---
Nice build. I've maxed the slugger perk card and tried to stack another one but it won't let me, how do you manage that?
---
More agility = more bass speed. So that‚Äôs a start.
---
# Just drop one more item and it'll shift the position of the bag.
---
Why is it annoying to have a spot to disassemble cook and get buffs from at whitesprings. I always found them quite helpful
---
Yep, I was wrong about the release date. Thanks for that.
---
They will self destruct every monday, 7PM EST 
---
This is actually a good idea. Use resources to make them weigh less is a huge incentive and makes plastic more valuable as a resource
---
My first nuke I was trying to record while checking the sky and the map to just be outside the circle. One toe in and I was dust
---
Absolutely we need a total count on each section and maybe item group.
---
It's because Fallout 76 has recieved so much negativity and it seems that the game is in trouble. Go back and play MMO's in the process of dying or are only open on some community fan servers and you'll notice that they're the friendliest people you'll meet. It's because they want more people to stay so it won't be dead anymore.
---
&gt;Finally, I can play the salt card!
---
I...never thought about having two torsos with different mods.
---
WOW am I dumb!
---
Holy crap have you tested this personally?
---
This would have saved me migraine-inducing stress
---
You should have gone through the Enclave missions to be safe.
---
I agree. And yet I‚Äôm still playing. 
---
How long did it take to find those?
---
Model collision overlap. Nothing you can do until Beth moves some objects around.
---
Brick plans are hard to find, like a lot of things. I got mine from the Harper's Ferry Vendor.
---
I have not once seen this issue on pc yet. All i get are helpful people dropping occasional stimpacks or extra plans they dont need. Are you angrily approaching people or taunting them
---
It's worth it for the scorchbeast howl of death alone, no damage from them whatsoever. As for helping point blank depends on the gun and damage. My pistol I live my shotgun I die my combat rifle I get critical. I also do not run to much in endurance and have a low life build. 
---
Someone killed a cat in front of me a few weeks ago and I dropped 6 salt.
---
I noticed that today.  I hope they fix it in the next patch or sooner.  Some good scrap up there.
---
Seems like the cap would control how much folks can charge.  Upping the cap ups the non existent market value of things.  
---
So upping the cap is a bad idea.  It should be lowered, as there is nothing in this game worth 25k caps
---
PC. Crash, crash, crash. It is a guaranteed thing now. I've had crashes and disconnects since the game released (of course) but since this last patch it is much, much worse.
---
Also using the mod, also having tons of crashes.
---
You get mucho caps for it
---
it is not Wooby it is W00BY. the O is a 0. 
---
Counterpointa 
---
Honestly still whitesprings
---
It‚Äôs as if this world isn‚Äôt cruel enough...and where did this abundance of paper bags come from I ask you? 
---
I use level 45 raider armor in nuked areas all the time!
---
But then again, I am a moron.
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about the ones that are right outside the golf club
---
I feel like this aspect has been entirely missing in the faceless world of online gaming.  My college freshman brother-in-law is really into online shooting PVP war games, and I played with him for a couple hours over the holidays.  (we played on PC and I used his school laptop with my Steam acct and a quick download) I was pretty disgusted at the amount of racist, homophobic and otherwise socially unacceptable behavior that was happening.  It can't possibly be good for anything.  He didn't even seem to notice, even though I suspect he's gay but not ready to come out yet.  I just don't understand how people can spout so much hate-speech online and behave normally in public.  I'm not racist or homophobic.  Is this kind of shit going through their head as they go through their day and interact with people of various colors, religions and ethnicities?  It must be a sad existence to mistrust and hate at least 60% of the people you meet, at least where I live in upstate NY.
---
I'd proooobably tell you that I don't really enjoy having to stand still to have my damage reduction function, and that different people have different ways of enjoying the game.
---
My buds and I tend to go to the cranberry berry bog, and kill all the scorchbeasts there. 
---
I like to cripple both legs of humanoids, walk behind them, and shoot them in the head like a professional. Execution style.
---
I wish fatigue from New Vegas was a thing, because then I'd do that,  and then shoot them.
---
Done that.
---
I don't know, I think a lot of people were pretty happy being able to throw grenades with their guns out, instead of having to swap weapons every time they throw a grenade, which is how it was before 4.
---
Lol, I had an instance where every time a scorched spawn they fell from the sky and died.  I walked around hearing crunching noises and finding corpses.

Usually they‚Äôre all posted within a couple hours.

---
I think horde events are great. A little tip might help yoy and others who might think they are to much of a time sink.
---
Hordes generally spawn in locations that support that enemy type. So if you learn the locations, you can drastically cut down on search time and caps spent on traveling.
---
Most of my experience comes from the cranberry bog as thats where I spend 90% of my time. I do most horde events as soon as I see them and have done them many times (I have a level 325 and a 105).
---
Super mutants-generals steakhouse, robco
---
Ghouls-kerwood mine
---
Robots-AMS, robco
---
Scorched-glassed caverns, civic center(rare)
---
The other horde types such as mirelurk and crickets seem to spawn me near the horde from the limited times ive done them so if they do have set locations I have not done them enough to find out, the other types seem far more common.
---
There are exceptions to the above tho, I would say very rarely the horde is in a unexpected location and I dont know if this is intended or a bug. But 95% of the time the hordes I have listed are in the locations mentioned.
---
You said it's *only useful* for nuke zones, which directly implies it is *not useful* anywhere else.
---
Not sure what else you'd want me to take from that.
---
Dont kill the dream mannn
---
usually a day or two. they start with Alpha and end with Charlie

it's well known...... just no-one talks about it.

Turn on push to talk if you want to be stealthy...?

Do you not store junk in your stash?

Try it.  That's how it was working for me the other day, but with this game: test and verify.

Rejoin them if you can

Go get your stuff back

Stop hoarding so much garbage dood
---
Haha that‚Äôs a duper‚Äôs dream lol
---
Then let me rephrase to what the other guy said. It's only NECESSARY, in nuke zones. Rest of the game you can go without it with the right legendary armor
---
How much stuff?
---
If you're packing alot out makes the stability worse
---
I play on PC and have played on PS4. 
---
PC has been awesome. Mostly friendly and helpful. 
---
PS4 I found that most people mainly keep to themselves but I did have one level 150 dick who kept killing me when I was a low level, and 2 high level players trash my base once. 
---
it only makes it so you dont do damage to people, you still take slap damage, but they need to make it so you cant damage someone elses camp but you SHOULD beable to kill a wanted person.
---
or make it so turning on/off pacifist is easier/faster, like put it in social menu when you select yourself there is a toggle....too much time to go thru map then into option then back out of all those menus
---
I found a 40% swing speed vampire switchblade the other day and got excited, but it was only level 10. Now I only find good legendaries on low level legendaries.
---
1. Not relevant since there's plenty of officially sanctioned devices that do this.
---
2. The game doesn't need to be designed for the hardware, it can just use the text-entry API on the console device.

I don't mind the quests starting up so much..... it's the damn voices that kick off each and EVERY TIME you enter a event area - that twat at Mamma D's and the Grafton Mayor can go f-off as far as I am concerned :D

There is no way whatsoever that could go wrong.

quite a bit, but not enough to crash the servers, I've had more junk and I was fine
---
Nice job. I haven‚Äôt experienced nearly this amount of issues but then again just level 53 and a filthy casual.
---
I just then it when some gamer uses the word "broken" now. its become fucking meaningless gibberish 9 times out of 10. 
---
As someone who is interested in getting this game, one day, I really appreciate all the topics on this sub that express the frustrations and issues that regular FO76 players are having with this title.  I know it may be irritating to people that are having fun, but to people such myself, this is very useful source of information on the current state of this game.  
---
Just my 2 cents. 
---
Its nice, but Im just going to stick with Marsupial jumping away. Every now and then the server just seems to forget you are immune to explosives and I randomly end up killing myself. 
---
It tests well, but in practice Ive found it less reliable than just jumping away. And jumping doesn‚Äôt require perk points.

I have almost as many crashes as hours played. =\

it was full from other junk, was doing a lot of main/side quests that required me to build stuff
---
This is my usual plastic farming spot, though if i just need a couple I'll head to either the whitespring or top of the word stations, there's typically a couple forks/knives to grab on the tables outside, as well as the cigarette machines around them. Also, most of the bathrooms in the stations will have a bloodpack, for once you get the stimpack plans.
---
It was a sizeable amount, including a lot of power conductors which were attached to the walls, generators and the shower. I'm level 135, I know how much bounty you receive from destroying individual pieces, but this guy somehow only had 20 caps on his head, it made no sense.

You have to weight to get expert and master slugger they are different cards

I don't use a controller, as I play on PC but I just keybind one of my mouse buttons to push to talk...

How did they have plans stashed in diff containers? I didnt know this was possible?

You sure they were not your plans?

I think it's broken, or I need to get a lottery ticket because I got 3 explosive weapons in a row lol

no, only one is excavator power armor.

Yep

I had this happen to me.  Picked up a legendary hunting rifle.  Everytime it was on my person, it nerfed everything else, including mines.  Put it in my stash, and everything went back to normal eventually. 
---
Nope, getting streamed snipped. Guy found me stalked me and just keeps shooting me with a TSE but doing nothing to me as far as damage. Then I turned passive off and killed my buddy cause he had a bounty. Then turned passive on. My buddy ended up coming back and killing me in one hit even though I had passive on.

Alien invasion, need to target a mothership with a nuke to shoot it down, big alien encampment at space station maybe.

Just please do something with the space station, my camp is right over the hill and I'm dying to have something interesting happen with such a unique place.

Bone clubs are like one of the best non legendary 2 hands

You mean farming With? Because you can pull the SBQ out of the nuke zone.

If all you're doing is tagging glowing ghouls or picking flowers then it doesn't matter what armor you wear, use a Hazmat suit or carry a set of PA.

I'm not used to seeing taxes so high. Highest I've ever seen for sales is 10%.  Might be low for you in Germany. 
---
...I am the other guy lol
---
&gt;you can go without it with the right legendary armor
---
Yeah.. except Power Armor is *multiple orders of magnitude easier to find* than the right set of legendary armor.
---
Which... Kind of makes this whole situation make perfect sense, if you ask me.
---
Besides non-PA users having no options for armor in nuke zones (because hazmat suit). That doesn't make sense. Or, at least, it's terrible game design.
---
So if your camp is in the blast zone when the nuke goes off or timer goes off even you have to move your camp before detonation or it gets destroyed? 
---
That's tat, i was hoping i could build like a bunker using the stairs and concrete walls

I do regular swaps with players of plans (I post in many of the trading discords) Its a great way to bulk up your know plans for free and get rid of one's you already know in the process. I've made quite a few friends  in game by hosting swaps, and people come back regularly to swap again! Highly recommend trying it at some point.

with 5 hours of continuous 10 MBPS connectivity it got to 200 mb out of the 50.19 GB I need, and I'm not even sure I won't need the 2 gb and the other couple GB updates that happened between the newest one and the first one.
---
I guess I just cannot update the game on xbox anymore, this is the reward I get from MS for buying its hardware, just having its PC os wasn't good enough for them. lol, I am not mad, I am just unsurprised this is how MS transacting has been since forever.
---
I did but it always spawns me in it and I lose them before I can get out
---
Full Assassins armor, rank 3 of Fireproof and Dense mod. Not getting one-shotted, but whoever tells you that they don't receive damage are lying.
---
Can confirm that you are correct. I tried it.
---
Well tbh while attacking a camp is part of the game machanics it is entirely pointless unless you are seeking a wanted level for the pvp. But attacking a camp can get you a decent bounty rather quick. I think takin the attackers inventory is a bit far but maybe increase the price on a players head?? Like 250 cap minimum or something idk. To me it doesn't cost bust a handful of steel copper and glass to fix my camp when it get hit(scorchbeast not players) so I'm not bothered by it but I guess others are. Unless you have a specific reason for your camp location maybe change it to a more hidden location?   
---
I...uh.
---
^^Sometimes.

This is pretty much the only reason I never used the boxing glove.

not even for the non PA? I didn't think so but wanted to check.

Alpha‚Äôs been solved! 
---
It honestly doesn't really matter what armor you wear to fight the SBQ either.
---
There really isn't any difficult content in this game currently. Not at any magnitude to actually require build efficiency and planned consumable usage.
---
But nuke zones are the only thing that currently adds difficulty to the base game, which is why I consider it the closest thing to endgame content we currently have, SBQ aside.
---
If it happens again:  Have her move to an open spot and drop one more item.  The bag will move.

I farm legendaries at Watoga and Whitesprings for my end game entertainment and the hunt for the holy grail of perfect armor and weapons for my character.  Aside from some minor bugs (I've never seen scout armor drop and I think Black Diamond is a unique weapon) I feel like your program is very accurate.
---
I agree that the pool is far too large.  I don't think they should filter drops with certain "undesirable" weapons being excluded, as everyone having the same dozen weapons (handmade, gauss, super sledge, double barrel shotgun, etc) would be super dull.  I wouldn't mind if a 3 star enemy always dropped a 3 star piece.  The most disappointing aspect of my end game is seeing a 3 star enemy, which is like 1/1000 to have it drop a one star leather armor leg.  I might actually use it if the 3 stars worked well for my build.  The second option would be to tighten up the affix pool and drop a dozen unpopular/useless affixes.  For example, given that you can use one perk point for aquaboy if you want to dive in a lake, underwater breathing is an affix that's just there to ruin the algorithm.

Since the last update it takes me AT LEAST 3 attempts to log in and have everything work, as in‚Ä¶
---
1.) My pip boy shows up with a blank screen, or not at all with parts of my arms missing. 
---
2.) Cannot equip a weapon or even move my character. And camp does not load in. 
---
3.) My quests do not appear on the screen at all, or even in my pip boy.
---
These load in issues happen every time now and it is really frustrating having to sign in and out a bunch  just to get the game working correctly. And then when I do get in with all the normal functions, disconnects have been VERY frequent. I have had them before but this different.
---
I hope I am not alone on this and it can be fixed soon. I don‚Äôt want to stop playing this game, I really enjoy it. I just can‚Äôt spend my first 20-30 minutes of gaming logging in. 
---
Also true didnt think of that. Maybe on the pvp servers we some changes to the looting mechanics
---
There is no feeling so sweet as spending 1/3 of all your caps for a plan you already know. 
---
Yeah absolutely , i see the dude with the turrets as a raider. He left the vault like all of us. Had the same training. Same choices. Same chances.
---
He could have been a team player but instead he chose the life of a raider. Stealing the bounties of others.
---
Thanks OP for making the wasteland great again
---
I'm on PC and haven't used any mods, haven't even edited the INI file settings and I get disconnected when I die about half the time.
---
Just FYI, codes are not platform specific. 
---
Nukacrypt solves them on PC. They work for PS4 (and I presume XB1 as I haven‚Äôt heard otherwise)
---
Xb1 also. Don't know why you got downvotes for this? I have no doubt on my end that if I play tommorow I'm going to have a ton of rads as well.

Lol.

Don‚Äôt know what they go for in the various markets here, but they‚Äôre like 12k from a vendor.

Still getting infinite load screens on Xbox One X annoyingly usually after I've just taken a workshop
---
I have the same experience on Xbox. No one messing with me. No crashing every 5 minutes, maybe only a random crash every so often. No idea where all the jerks are but I‚Äôm happy they don‚Äôt appear to be on xbox.
---
Build a camp near by and use artillery?
---
Look, as long as you use the homewrecker and *stay by my sentry* I‚Äôll be fine with what you main. 
---
What we need is a Tag for Sale System so we can tag legendaries we don't want or tag Chems/aid items when we have stack larger than we need
---
Okay I get it I unknowingly promoted a guy who supports duping and exploits in the game, but from what I've seen nobody else has tried nuking different places. Yes it's a scummy thing of him to cheat like that but at the very least he did *one* thing good for the community
---
Nice to see that there are others that noticed that bullshit,maybe W00BY has more to offer.lol
---
If I ever do a"Mad Max" build, I might have to adopt this tactic. Thank you.
---
This is addressed in my feedback response to the INside the vault call, the UI is in dire need of complete customization and responsiveness updates, this is known as action bar modding/customizing and historically many classic games that were extremely successful have never yet offered it as a built in option, and have relied on the community to develop the modding in this realm.
---
I would love a one tap button for my Molotov. I use them around 42% effectively because of the UI problems.
---
For my full feedback post see my /u . I hope to communicate to the minds behind this awesome game the most immediately needed and logical revisions and additions which are indicated by the game's existing philosophy and mechanics, so that the changes made are as small to the core experience as possible while taking out the largest hurdles that are frustrating the players. This is simple efficiency of ideas. 
---
I have a quad crossbow, I kinda love it
---
How do you crash to desktop on Console...
---
So many idiots commenting in favor of the griefing asshats. 
---
Yknow it's crazy the servers were not this bad for silo runs before the last patch, it's crazy. I'm at 140 hours or so and I've definetly enjoyed it. 
---
Lol me too
---
Honestly they probably didn‚Äôt notice 
---
TSE Fuckbois deserve this agony.
---
Well considering 90% of the stuff sold to vendors is things nobody would buy, they have to have extremely high margins on items just so they don't go bust. 
---
Take me home,
---
I always like these types of fights. They are few and far between but they are cool when they do happen.
---
Lol, as I understand it the game can freeze and "blue screen" on PS4 at least. Not sure on xbone, but it might be more accurate to say crash to force close or something. 
---
That happens when the legendary creature inside has a good item.  
---
As others have said, Whitesprings, but don't forget about clearing out the Monster Mash at Watoga High School each day. It only takes about 15 minutes, you get plenty of random junk and ammo and caps, and I usually gain a level or close to it. 
---
I‚Äôve got no problem with them, even if they set up right behind the golf course. What I have a problem with is when they place a bunch of turrets on their camp aimed directly inside the club. 
---
Want a couple on the ground to protect your stairs. Fine. Poaching all the ghouls from farmers?  Enjoy your destroyed shack, because someone will mess it up for being a PITA. 
---
I will check it out. Thanks vault fam
---
Can you elaborate please?
---
Eh I just resorted to hunting people down in the map. 
---
And no I‚Äôm not killing them repeatedly.
---
Try
---
it's a TSE Assassin's Furious Flamer mod... Trust me, you don't want that kind of power. ^(it shoots explosions)
---
Pipe is lighter. I wanted to like a tactical suppressed short-barreled hunting rifle, but it was just too heavy.
---
I would adore a sven mod type play with all the mod accoutrements people can thow at it. 
---
I've played multiple times, only about 5-10m event. The rewards are the usual mediocre mess but some of the "messages" have been pretty funny - highloghts are a birthday song and knock knock joke.

Not on your fucking life lol no way not ever. Until real content is in there there was no way in hell that I would give them any money for any of the stuff thete
---
You have Demolition Expert perk?
---
Has to be since ive never gotten anything good out of there.
---
Mine bugged and I could not kill the bear.  It was invincible.
---
Sorry mate, I'm on PC.
---
Alpha is solved
---
Well I Dnt Wanna Pay That Somebody Be A Good Samaritan 
---
On Xbox that usually never happens (at least not to me), when something crashes the game freezes and starts making these noises:
---
grreeergrgeggrgegrgeggrgegrgegrghrtvertegbreeebootbeephergeberg
---
Since Greenwich is 5 hours ahead, that 19:00 EST. 
---
Haha ok was wondering if high charisma really made that much difference
---
the issue is that the UI lacks responsiveness, what should happen is one press - a grenade warning/timer of some kind begins visually so I can see that it will throw in 3 ticks so i can line up the throw or tap the button again to cancel it.
---
You think that‚Äôs big? Whats up with those historic outfits? Is Abraham Washington in business offering that much on the black market already? Or did they use to embed caps into clothing in the 19 century? 
---
I didn't get to Harper's Ferry before level 40 and I'm pretty sure I've seen *a few* other plans there. 50 cal and auto-grenade specifically. There sure is a lot of radium rifle though, I'll grant you that.
---
There's nothing to do, no lore for your character, choices, anything
---
Oh okay lol. That sucks but glad we could come to a understanding 
---
try moving your camp.  it will restore the whole thing at the cost of caps, instead of mats.  Just pick it up and put it right back down iirc 40 caps
---
I appreciate the help! I completed the quest except for one small hiccup. Key codes reset today and I'm not privy to that info. Anyone know the code for Charlie?
---
It really sucks when your bag falls into somewhere like that.

Thanks man. I just launched alpha using these codes and the bravo code I sent to my buddy on ps4 worked as well

Actually I reckon they do, why you think everything looks like it came from the 50s. 
---
And that's after you wait through double loading screens ü§£
---
Thanks. I figured out that mine were being deleted as I left the security door area.
---
Where is your camp built at? There is some stupid thing going on where if it‚Äôs at white springs people will destroy it because they feel like it‚Äôs wrong and that your trying to farm the golf course and it takes away from their enjoyment. 
---
This is common on any platform with a $200 entry ticket, which is accessible to 14 year olds the world over, which parents can only monitor a fraction of the time. 
---
I‚Äôm looking at you, PlayStation. 
---
Come to the platform with a higher entry ticket (PC) and you‚Äôll by and large meet more mature people. 
---
This isn‚Äôt just an F76 thing and is very common. 
---
What fits your view of real content?  I‚Äôm shocked they included the Red Rocket garage door, Nuka Girl rocketsuit, and the Space Suit because if the Atomic Shop is to mimic Fortnite‚Äôs microtransaction system, NOTHING in there should give any player any ‚Äúedge‚Äù over another.  Cosmetic changes only.  They are walking a fine line for being the new kid on the MMO block.
---
at first I relied on some steam controller configs to create combo mappings when holding to top right button for clicks on my left thumb scroll pad, but then I just got used to playing just as the xbox controller on both pc and xbox. thinking of going back to the steam controller since updating on my xbox is broken and i can't foresee playing on it with my xbox ppl ever again till i somehow get somewhere i can leave the xbox running for a week to get all of the updates after this last one broke it and caused a reinstall that just can't seem to access bethesda server at the speed i once had during the launch install.
---
it's bizarre that there is not a full rebinding and action bar customization function. when I'm in build mode i still have to go hit the default key for jump. I really want total action bar customization, it's an urgent item in my feedback response to inside the vault's call
---
Where exact.y is your CAMP located?
---
Did not know that! I sent a Charlie code to my buddy on ps4 which worked and I just launched alpha so I know they're solid. 
---
It takes me about 12 minutes to set up a shot.
---
Even huntington near marshall would probably be better than charleston.
---
Youtube is great for funny animal videos and watching people make fools of themselves. Insightful, honest and non-clickbait reviews of whatever the current bandwagon hate-object may be, not so much.
---
Simple. Easy. Smart. 
---
I really hope something like this comes around in the updates. 
---
$5 says your camp is at white springs
---
Is your camp a turret farming camp built next to the golf course?  
---
If not, is your camp in a hotly contested area?  
---
If first situation, people are probably annoyed with you and break it to spite you. 
---
If second they might be destroying it with the goal of pushing out others who build in the same location. 
---
Near deathclaw island. The turrets cannot reach deathclaw island, so there is no steal killing. I just placed it there and later realized the island was nearby. Figured I'd keep it there so people can work on their equipment going to the island or from.
---
I too dislike the terminal we have at the moment, they should add some normal ones with additional options like u said unlock/lock doors etc.
---
Same. And Sea of Thieves. All three games I enjoyed for like 2 to three weeks and gave up. I went back to nms middle of last year and had a blast. Picked back up sea of thieves and omg the game is amazing now.  I hope I can do the same with this. 
---
Nope. Complete opposite side of the map
---
With a stealth boy mod, not at all. 
---
Never crashed you say please post your computer specs
---
This made me laugh, and yeah that's about that
---
If your turrets are shooting into the golf club and you‚Äôre not there, then yes. You are taking away from other players as NO ONE gets any loot in that scenario if your turrets wipe out the horde as soon as it respawns. 
---
Codes just reset almost and hour or two ago
---
What kills me is trying to invite someone to team and jump out of my power armor in a nuke zone :(
---
Noticed this as well. Decided to put class freak back into the mix and the -50% didnt change under the spec section in pipboy. Changes the negatives for marcupial though. 
---
They had me at Mothman.
---
I m sure it would be possible somehow if correctly integrated ofc.
---
the easy solution is let each player customize their action bars.
---
if they need a modder to create this, give me the tools and i and many others im sure will attempt to do so for them, free of charge, because we play this game, and are trying to play it. for enjoyment. and we would enjoy fixing this
---
#preach
---
Yes. 
---
It works, we just launched one. 
---
That's what they said about Sea of Thieves and No Man's Sky.  Both are amazing games now.  We can only hope BGS does a good job in reviving the game. 
---
The only thing I'm mad about it the TSE Flamer... does it just... Shoot explosions?
---
Seems weird that your being attacked so much I‚Äôm not sure why people attack bases to begin with let alone one that‚Äôs minding its own business
---
Pelletized cryolator is good for this. Slows the tango down for everyone.
---
PA has one huge advantage: It's accessible. Sure, there might be armor in the game that has higher stats than PA, but I'm level 50 and I've sure never seen anything that's remotely close.
---
Maybe I'm just in the "grinding out your gear" category, which probably will last until level 100 or so.
---
Seriously. In THIS economy? It‚Äôs getting harder and harder to... land on your feet. 
---
The respawn rates and legendary rates seem to be terrible there though. But if you are looking for flux, I think I had around 400+ assorted from that hillside. 
---
Is your camp getting completely leveled, or just taking damage?  
---
I personally like what they did with 76 considering that I expected it to be horrible I think it really could use an update or 2 to deal with some minor issues but other than that I like it not only for gameplay but lore ( yes I‚Äôm that guy) and I think it‚Äôs really neat that you have to do a quest or two than you not only get access to nukes but also to some more lore particularly for the NOW PREWAR CONFIRMED X-01 prototype power amour system 
---
Hell no.
---
I'm not going to sit here and take it like a man... I spent $100 on this game.
---
It's like asking me to shut up and go away because some game decided to load up on pay to win micro transactions (BATTLEFRONT 2 everyone!).
---
FYI, the Battlefront 2 micro transaction fiasco was so loud and so huge in the gaming industry that EA/Dice decided to quickly kill it, and prevented them from putting that shit into Battlefield 5.
---
So no, I'm going to scream my lungs out at all the shit that's happening in this game.
---
No. It's near deathclaw island. It's been there for weeks and I've never had an issue until the day before yesterday.
---
Honestly how hard is it to...idk...go away from the side of the golf course? Or join a differenr server? Not that fucken hard tbh. This is such a stupid fucken thing to destroy peoples shit over. If it bugs them that much dont go near it. Is it that much different than the WS bots killing the ghouls?
---
The robots are no longer aggressive, but remain enemies. 
---
These were reset 1.5 hrs ago
---
They should just make it to just get credit for being in los and in combat to get either partial or all exp but get legendary and boom no need to nerf tse
---
They level it to the ground. 
---
West Virginia
---
Try dropping all your holo tapes and notes. It made a huge difference for me.
---
What even are these power armour colors?!?! The X01 doesnt even look like power armor!
---
*scrolls down and sees the Mothman figure*
---
Never mind, shut up and take my money!
---
Also worth it for the easy steel/lead scrap with the occasional legendary and they dont fight back. 
---
I'm having a problem understanding something. You die. On your way back to pick up your bag of dropped items, you pick up more items, while knowing that if you die the first bag disappeares? 
---
level 50 assaultrons? so you want to reward griefers with free loot?
---
Your buddy has a choice to select "Revenge" when respawning which lets him hit you. After all, you did kill him.
---
This has actually be kinda entertaining. Did it this morning. Baited a guy to his workshop, killed him. He seeks revenge. Killed him again. He tries yet again and gets splattered. Each time completely unaware im even still there thanks to the X01 Stealth Boy mod (took forever to find one from Modus). 
---
Now, I‚Äôm not a dick. I dropped off some goodies for him. Ammo, some duplicate plans, etc. 
---
It's not disturbing, you  just enjoy the antici--
---
So we can sit at a computer playing a computer game sitting at a computer.  Inception bwooooooooooong
---
People are griefing because their TSE weapons are getting nerfed soon, so they want to fight while they have an advantage. I‚Äôve been playing on a lower level character with some friends that are new to the game and we‚Äôve been attacked repeatedly over the last few days. Every time it‚Äôs been by people with explosive weapons, running in pairs so one doesn‚Äôt have to get a bounty. 
---
Combat knife with serrated mod give 20% more dmg ;)
---
If you ever need a buddy to roam the wastes with hit me up Captain_Forge
---
Didn't know that either! Thanks for the info 
---
People are teaming up and destroying camps and claiming each others bounties. 
---
Not my first fortunately. Already have over 300 hours on fallout 4.
---
Except that cap-grinding is the only way to consistently get a lot of plans, which you can only get from vendors. Plans are basically *the* cap sink in the game. Almost nothing else is even worth buying (vs farming it) unless you are totally desperate, or randomly happen upon something good that was probably dumped by another player.
---
I came in kind of predisposed to find it mediocre (Bethesda's been kind of down spiralling for awhile now, and I was never exactly on their hype team to begin with. They were just a decent stand in for the former Ultima experience after EA saved that one to put a bullet in its head themselves). And certainly expected a trainwreck just watching their interviews combined with my own experience in the genre.
---
Which is not to say its not a trainwreck, as it does really just kind of peter off into nothingness as far as trying to be a continous experience (unless you're into the most awkward imbalanced mess of a PvP game to be found in AAA, or even most indies). But other then a few kinks with balancing, its actually a fairly solid experience, and probably even my favorite of the Bethesda fallout entries.

A file integrity check and/or a reinstall seems to help.

Damn. I would have traded for that!

I've been playing on PC for about a month now, and am in a similar situation as you.  I've had a handful of disconnects, but it could've been on my end (my internet was spotty a few weeks ago).  I haven't had issues with other players either.  My biggest gripe is that my frame rate drops really low at times, and the game becomes pretty much unplayable.  I know it has something to do with being near areas where there's a lot going of things roaming around (Whitesprings is notorious for doing this to me).  If I switch servers, it usually fixes itself.  Sometimes I grind on, and if I get far enough away from the affected area, the frame rate goes back to normal.

I think it‚Äôs Lewisburg Station that has a bathroom one can hide in... #filthycoward 
---
Did you take into account in the design how much RNGsus hates me?
---
I always try to at least wave and be friendly to others, even if I want to go my separate way.
---
Sometimes I'll leave a bunch of junk, ammo, food, plans and legendary stuff I don't need in the Watoga Station blue suitcase (Watoga is where I usually am) and give other players a "follow me/come here" emote to make them aware I put a bunch of stuff into it.  It's about 50/50 if they ignore me or not.  Oh well, their loss if they don't want extra screws, .50 ammo, a two-shot gatling gun, an instigating super sledge or whatever else I left.
---
For a while I was saving any &gt;lvl 20 legendary stuff to leave in the overseer's box in Flatwoods, but after the last patch the stash limit seems to have decreased dramatically.  I also don't often get a trusting reaction out of -50lvl players as a mid 100's character, even if I wave, holster my gun and don't make sudden movements.
---
That's even how it is in Elder Scrolls I dont understand
---
The server doesn't crash, you do.
---
He had a bounty though, I didn‚Äôt think you could seek revenge with a bounty. And he didn‚Äôt come to kill me until a solid 20 minutes after I collected his bounty.
---
Yep. Otherwise there‚Äôd be another duping method using them.
---
For those unaware, an early method was to use the box on the artillery piece for the exploit.  Having any other player owned container that allowed storage in the camp would cause the exploit to be possible again. 
---

Many threads are blowing up that are regarded completely by the suggestions list here, from decoration and functional item displaying / organizing container type objects, to bobble head improvements, stability and duping concerns, item sharing / trade glitches and errors, to action bar customization (power attack, gun bash, grenade, hold breath, invite, third person) , emotes, and ideas for more permanent building in the world and player created factions. Every day I peruse the default Hot view on the this fo76 and add comments to the relevant threads letting people know that I also agree and have this list of suggestions which are designed with idea efficiency as the prime thought, what changes and improvements are most obvious to the existing design and gameplay experience, what modifications can be made which are the least radical to the type of gameplay we have going, that complement it and avoid disrupting the analog, presence relying game systems, while clearing up everyone's frustration over the bugged situations and awkward or impossible maneuvers it presents us with. 
---
I know, which is why I mentioned it's two completely different studios working on the games.  But their both owned by BGS, so it's not like communication between the two would be any sort of IP/copyright violation by any means.  
---
never before have i wanted a flamer so badly
---
Thats some serious healing.

/r/unexpectedkorg

I agree. If anything, my camp would be beneficial, not grief worthy. It just gives people a place to get crops and workbenches. Had some guys come in, say hi, work on their power armor and weapons. They played instruments with my wife and i, then blew us up and the camp too.

I don‚Äôt think you can. Would be nice to have a version without the scope.

No worries. My buddies and i found that out the hard way last week. Finished the the silo and lost a couple keycards typing in the old codes. It was like 745pm at that point. Oiy.
---
Do you see someone going wanted doing it?
---
If not you could be built on an enemy spawn
---

---
I didn't know how much I wanted this until just now :)
---
I think it's not a weapon you can modify. 
---
ya why
---
I don't doubt it, but it's just another frustrating thing in a huge list of things that are all designed to hamstring progress and force more grinding. I even get why they do it, but it still sucks.
---
Yep. Always seemed weird, but it still allows you to fast travel despite having many hostile marked bots around. 
---
Just bulid lol
---
That's unfortunate.  I only assumed you could because I found a thread of someone saying they were.  
---
Aw bummer way too late for me to save it now 
---
Ooh fingers crossed 
---
I for one enjoy finding all the bugs and broken systems more than playing the actual game about once a week then stop playing due to frustration. People just shouldn't get butthurt when the bugs and issues are pointed out, as ultimately we want them to get fixed, that's why we point them out.  
---
I know for sure the double barrel, 44, and handmade can. 
---
Kinda fun using an 8 shot double barrel.

It‚Äôs awesome.  Slight drain to AP though.

God damn it now I have to go to a WalMart...

There was definitely a bathroom at the Lewisburg Station. I was going to tell the lvl 16 to hide in there but he made the smart decision and fast traveled out of there.

I added you psn is SirGimps, sorry meant yo put a message in the FR
---
Turns out the respawner will lose the loot marker if you even just go into the transfer menu (without transferring anything) -- discovered that a few weeks ago when I was trying to get my last pair of trophies by repeatedly killing friends.
---
Why hot fix when they can just wait weeks and release a huge patch that will fix 150+ bugs..../s
---
I seriously posted about this last week and got down voted into oblivion. This reddit is a cesspool...anyways....
---
They really need to hotfix major bugs like this immediately instead of waiting weeks to release one big patch....and in the process probably breaking more than they fixed. They do this every time....
---
I see people get wanted. Sometimes I'm at the camp when it happens, sometimes I'm across the map and get the notification that someone is attacking and I check. Usually it's only one person, sometimes it's 2. They always have bounties 100+
---
Its talked about all the time but usually gets little attention as having your base demo'd isn't that common.
---
At 244 hours, on ps4, I've never had my based attacked.
---
I've never come across anyone destroying a base too.
---
Maybe on pc there's a high concentration of douche bags but that doesn't mean everyone has the same problem.
---
I still see whitespring bases all the time too. They are quite consistent tbh, but ppl don't bother attacking them in my experience.
---
Actually I reckon they don't and the 50's has nothing to do with that. It uses a generic term for power in and fictional units based on nothing. But if you want to believe that a small generator produces 3 watts of power, well then that's on you lol.
---
Update, today I got egg headed while taking &lt;1 in my full dur hazmat suit, at the stream behind the clubhouse. THis is the only time I have seen a mutation trigger without at least +5 RAD.
---
On the plus side, this isn't a melee character, but I wish the INT was more useful, he is RP as a psycho tech, using explosives, drills, rocket launcher, chainsaw, and the minigun shredder. A weakling, nerd rage conceptually but not planning to use the card because my sneakier mobility character plays the adrenal Radicool rage bloodied build hybrid with shotgun, rifles, and marsupial melee.
---
It‚Äôs the curse of posting at 4am.
---
These people do have explosive weapons with doubleshot. But it's usually one person (I check the map) and if it's two, they both end up with bounties.
---
The FO76 playerbase is probably the least interested in PvP that I've ever seen.  It's kind of funny that they put these systems in the game and for the most part, people seem to not be remotely interested in using them =p
---
I've been referencing this one lately: ["What Does This Plan Unlock?"](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl)
---
I like everything about this but the timeframe should be TBD because it takes 20 minutes to walk across the map (I did the math btw) and I feel taking 50% of your time walking to the enemy faction base or trying to find them. other than that little flaw I'd be down for this shit!
---
much appreciated ! thanks 
---
I feel your pain.  Mine got leveled last night after I defended another player who's CAMP was getting leveled.  It was a two person team that nailed mine.  My CAMP is no where near any of the places that mess up other player's game.  They did it out of pure spite.
---
I "used" Grahm for a workshop defense event..... I just took over the workshop as he was walking by so open up a trade window and waited. Sure enough it was super mutants and more than I could handle. I stood behind him and tagged each one and he super Sledged them.  Three separate waves, he slaughtered them all.  I looted all the corpses and then sold him the weapons. Lol.
---
There are certain hazards associated with life in the wasteland. If you CAMP solely on the view, availability of water and other resources, or ease of fast travel; accidents can happen. Always be mindful of what sort of creatures live near you.
---
I would die for a quad ammo dragon black powder rifle.  Probably better than a double shot overall. 
---
I don't server hop (unless the performance of a particular server seems bad), so I let the randomness guide my actions.  I managed to get the Lever Action Rifle plan from Harper's Ferry quite a while back.  I think I've seen it for sale maybe one other time ever since.
---
It actually didn't seem that important to me at the time, but I recently found a 3\* Suppressor's Lever Action Rifle which is pretty awesome.  Not only does it do the Suppressor thing, but it has explosive bullets *and* increases my movement speed pretty drastically whenever I have it out.  Still, even non-Legendary Lever Action Rifles are rare enough that I contemplate whether or not I'm supposed to manufacture Lv. 25 ones just to scrap them for mods.
---
Swap Assaultrons, with Scorchbeasts that can't land.
---
Roleplaying as desperate wasteland survivor = Excusing Griefing
---
I live in the LA area and love food and cooking. I'd be down for this. 
---
We are a humble people but we can change colors faster than Italy can change sides in a world war be careful
---
Bethesda should hire you.
---
That would be awesome. 
---
Some guns get the ‚ÄúDouble‚Äù effect instead of Quad. I used to have a double 50 MG. 500 round mag capacity. 
---
I've been building up my stable flux's as a priority lately, nuke zones can easily be 1 and done for enemies. Luckily you get stuff like hardened mass whether or not you tagged an enemy. I have a felling a good supply of stable flux will be important in future updates. Whitespring is still king, just because of the number of enemy spawns. Hardened mass, glowing blood, etc. is heavy too, not something you want to pack around for too long.
---
Fo76 community is used to being omnipotent quicksave gods than never die, even getting looked at by another player is their interpretation of getting griefed.  They brag about disconnecting instead of playing the game as intended to avoid:
---
* Pvp
---
* Social interactions
---
* Scorchbeasts
---
* Cost of repairs
---
* Death in general
---
* Workshop taken/contested
---
Disconnecting on purpose is an exploit by definition
---
&gt;(in a video game) the use of a bug or flaw in game design to a player‚Äôs advantage or to the disadvantage of other players.
---
Even with dedicated PVP servers the pve carebears will continue to whine about every other interaction in what is now a decent game.
---
You can seek revenge if you have a bounty
---
Rolling pins. Particularly 3* rolling pins.
---
I had that trouble further south.  Just move away from the roads and fast travel points.  You can still find nice places.  If you stay a long time griefers will still come by but less often.  Watch out for 1 Wanted trained by another player.  It's a sure sign they're building Wanted bounties.
---
I haven‚Äôt found all plans myself, but have the marine armor. 
---
I recommend 
---
1. Spend a while camped out around the top of the world, and do the full run picking up all 10 plan spawns from that area each time you come home. After a while you‚Äôll have most or all of what‚Äôs on their loot drop table. 
---
2. Spend some intimate time with each vendor In the game (using them routinely, at least 20-30 times on your vendor run). Not just the one for each faction. This includes non train station ones, like the responder bots inside Morgantown airport, the second one in watoga, or the Camden park one. **they each have different loot tables**. 
---
3. Iterate for every armor type, starting from leather, then light combat, then trapper, then marine, then the screw requiring ones. Figure out where to farm 80-100 of each resource they need, and integrate that into your daily run. When coming home, make as many lowest level arm pieces of that type as you can and scrap them. You‚Äôll learn another mod plan for every 10-40 you scrap, no, the level of the item doesn‚Äôt matter, and yes, you learn both material and misc mod plans that way, and yes, you learn torso and leg plans from scrapping arms. Because being able to make your marine bits buttressed is awesome. 
---
Note you won‚Äôt be able to learn some bits that way. Shadowed, BOS, Aerodynamic, Asbestos and strengthened appear to be scrapping-unlearnable. 
---
Also, scrap helmets, some give you the plan from scrapping just one. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you can get it on fat mans, missile launchers, or the grenade launchers either. I‚Äôve never seen anyone posting about having one with a double/quad prefix and at this point I‚Äôm inclined to believe they aren‚Äôt possible 
---
Yeah, I just tried it, but failed. I was doing pretty well until the reactor repairs. The first time, I just ran out of time. However, then the servers kept lagging on resetting the reactor. I had four different attempts, and it wouldn't start right away, so I had to hang around and wait, then the repair meter wouldn't keep up with me...super obnoxious. I had to give up when I was out of ammo for my shotgun, and my rifle broke. smdh
---
How appropriate, you fight like a cow!
---
Na, that doesn't work.
---
He did explained what happened. He killed a guy with a bounty, they chose to seek revenge and killed him
---
Well, neither my post nor my meaning have anything to do with hating, I thinking you're mixing things up. 
---
Are you on PC perhaps? I have 2 lvl 50s on my main char
---
I had to sit in front of the thing for like five mi utes before I could get through
---
With fireproof 3 and an explosive rifle (not ts) i take about 1/5th my hp bar with a point blank shot. 
---
It would normally cut my hp by 75% or more
---
No problem!!
---
He's helped me defend the Dirt Track on more than one occasion. 
---
Just sucks that it's usually after I've bankrupted the vendors that he shows up.
---
Also the crazy cat lady house, north of Bolton Greens, heaps of cat bowls.
---
Same here I've barely ever bugged while playing and I'm level 67
---
I'm not really saying It's a bad trade off. I've got another good weapon for that char. It's just something people should know.
---
cool that would be good to see when you open the Players list on the social tab, I think they could be organized there so the ones who are aligned with my setting are shown in White and the others would be grey, or some simple way of highlighting similar to how the Dot appears for someone an invite is coming from.
---
There are a few at Whitespring near the dead Yao Gui.  I bet you can get a picture of one over there.
---
The rug glitch still exists from Fallout 4. Dunno if that helps. Place an object on the rug then move the rug and both objects will move as one. If the rug can be placed down then you‚Äôre good.
---
Literally the only thing they accomplish is being a nuisance. I'm in passive so they're not getting anything by killing me if I'm there. And they're not getting mats. All they do is make me use up my materials to repair. Doesn't make sense. I assume this mostly applies to your situation as well. Although Idk if you play on pacifist. Lol
---
I have found supplies in train stations more than once, sometimes they were very helpful, sometimes I didn't need them so I left them there. 
---
But it was enough to make me join in on the tradition. I always try to carry stuff I don't really need that little bit further so I can stash it in a station... I don't just pack them with junk but I leave plans, extra stimpacks, extra ammo, rare outfits and etc... 
---
I hunt magazines a lot trying for the challenges so I leave those around too... Holo games and mag buffs like +1 lvl lock picking that might really appeal to someone who doesn't have all the lock pick perks yet... I like to think people have fun finding the rarer stuff like that. 
---
Oh also some holotapes just for fun, especially those fun yet creepy tales from the hills... They sometimes come with the astounding mags so I often have one of those to drop too.. 
---
gnarly
---
dope
---
Thank you kind sir. 
---
if it wont let you stash it its the one from the dev room. just leave it
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
Ha yes. I forgot to mention. I have a beautiful clip with one of those bad boys.
---
Youre not alone, my brother.
---
Surprise, you actually have finished the BoS line and just tossed your only free set of Ultracite PA!
---
73, 58, 52, 48, 12 have deleted two others who were over level 50
---
The best part of it all the people claiming to be holy warriors are using duped TSE guns 
---
But he‚Äôs all alone down there, having suffered unspeakable acts. We should let him live out his final days in freedom. 
---
You started well ahead of me then.  76 was my first, and now I‚Äôm only 26, lol
---
Only the impure monstrosities that inhabited the wastes. Mutated freaks and degenerates, all of them! (I'm RPing here, don't bring facts and logic into it :P ) Also, the Scorch Beast Queen was created by accident, and contained as soon as it was found. It was Eckhart that set her loose. So again, Eckhart's the real villain here, to the wastes and the Enclave both.
---
I hope they buff it.
---
Oh fuck, I still see it, I‚Äôm grabbing it 
---
Uh huh. Sure. Duper. /s
---
Seriously though, the people doing this need to stop. If you think someone is using an exploit, there‚Äôs a method already in place for dealing with them. 
---
I usually play on pacifist also.  I claimed the bounty on the one who did most of the damage as payback for what he did to that other player.  I wanted to make sure he didn't profit from it and that it cost a fair amount of the steel I was saving to make ammo upset me just a little bit.
---
Try a vfast weapon with 200% durability. 99% of the time I run around with my bloodied Grognak but I keep an Executioners Handy Buzz Blade in my stash. For some reason at above 100% condition the vfast weapons get a humongous damage boost, toss in Bloody Mess and voila, you're a human meat grinder. 
---
Where my $5?
---
my guess is 760, but no means yet exists to raise HP very much
---
You want camp plans? Cuz you can get -most- of them just by taking and defending workshops... Server hop the same workshop and repeat of you really wanna grind them out... You get one camp plan from taking the workshop and another for defending it... Three if it's a scorchbeast defense. 
---
Pile them up and then start searching and vendor hopping to fill in the gaps... There's a few rarities like mirror balls from grahm and clocks from the Charleston vendor, but the camp plan reward pool for workshops is rather large so it's the best place to start. 
---
That's so fucking grindy, they should just fix the damn mechanic 
---
This is probably what I will do, but does anything ‚Äòstick‚Äô or is it all brand new with each character?  In other words, is anything account bound?
---
I get ultra-light marine plans literally every time I go to Wallace in Harper's Ferry.  I've been playing since beta day one and I'm somewhere between lvl 130-140 without ever having power-leveled.  I have never seen heavy armor plans aside from leather pieces.  Unless there's a random event that exclusively drops them, I don't think they exist.
---
At my point in the game, I have no need for most armor and weapon plans.  I've scrapped enough found objects to learn all the scrap-learned mod plans for everything from marine armor to handmade rifles to tesla rifles.  My character has no idea how to make a handmade rifle from scratch, but I can kit out a legendary with whatever you want, including short, medium or long NV scopes. (which are terrible, btw)
---
I can make marine armor legs and arms (sturdy armor section) with plans that I've found randomly through exploring, but I've never seen them for sale.  I can only make light combat armor pieces from scratch.  I have never seen sturdy or heavy plans drop from vendors or found randomly.
---
The only plan I've ever learned from scrapping an item for the first time was the lever action rifle.  Very fortunate, I know.  I've only found the plan once, and traded it for an armor piercing/vats accuracy handmade legendary.
---
I know how to make broadsiders, harpoon guns, .50 cal M2, MG-42, Auto Grenade Launchers, miniguns and gatling guns all from plans I've found or bought from vendors.  I don't use heavy weapons, so I didn't pay attention to where I got them.  I've definitely seen Phoenix and the Watoga Station vendor sell .50 MG and auto grenade plans several times.
---
"Fight" gives them too much credit, really.  They just want to throw their weight around against people who can't defend themselves.
---
Level 150 assaultron dominators then
---
Oh my God, yes. I wish! I'd be all over that.
---
Low levelled charachter &gt;&gt;&gt; Heavily modded shotgun... hmm
---
I blue-screened twice today in 2 minutes and took it as a sign to go play something else.  I've experienced 11 blue screens in the week since the last PS4 update.  Most of them have happened during zone changes/fast travels.
---
I do the same thing!
---
From what it was in the other games, it's very underwhelming.
---
It's that water fountain isn't it? I was looking all over and couldn't find it. Thank you so much for this.
---
Goodbye disease cures!
---
Kept happening to me last night
---
Woah. That's...yeah, that's better than most of my usual haunts combined. Thanks for the tip. 
---
Omg I am so doing this.   Lol
---
Well the l could be I but we won‚Äôt know till we let em out. 
---
FREE WOOBY! 
---
And apparently his evil twin W00BY AS WELL!!! 
---
Here I am takin a poop while reading and now it relates to my current life movement!
---
Just started but I'm going to be hitting this game pretty hard. 
---
Drakemacgavin
---
I had that happen once. Got two caps per shotgun shell. Since I don't use them and I can't vender them, I was thrilled.
---
You're awesome, thanks for the tip!
---
I'm a team of one.
---
Honestly I'm not sure bethesda catered to ANY audience. The gri..."PVP enthusiasts who enjoy murdering low level players who can't fight back" don't get much out of it. The RPG enthusiasts got the shaft completely, as there are zero RPG elements of note in the game.   
---
The only thing GOING for this game, at this point, is a reasonably well made open world, you can explore with some friends...but like, I say "reasonably well made"... I call my base "camp floating rock" for a fucking reason, you know? 
---
They need to approach it like Blizzard did with WoW. Provide direct support and specifically lay out what they are and are not allowed to do. Unfortunately this needs some hard limits in the code as well. 
---
Well, for that current instance, yes.  But if you come back some time later, when the quest is available again, you will get the quest again.
---
Nah, there‚Äôs an intentional strat where one gets a bounty and the other doesn‚Äôt  so one can spot people and the other (with a bounty) can just follow them around and raid. Had this happen to my main‚Äôs camp, a friend went AFK there and someone followed him to my camp. Got there and one guy was watching (no bounty) while the guy with a 900 cap bounty killed my friend and ruined my camp. When we attacked the guy with a bounty, his friend became hostile but didn‚Äôt get a bounty because it counted as consensual PvP since they were on a team. It‚Äôs BS, but that‚Äôs how people do it. 
---
Smart 
---
Unfortunately they still attack poor Phoenix...
---
I guess I should have specified that it was as heavily modded as the game allows at level 15. Wouldnt have done shit in pvp or against strong mobs, but it hurt that turret pretty bad.
---
Er... You end your post by saying this entire Reddit seems like a witchhunt against Bethesda.
---
Am I wrong?
---
Not sure what you meant by sure, but like I said I'm not a duper nor do I even know how its done, Bethesda can check, my inventory is clean. I was against the whole multiplayer fallout from the start, but I knew that fallout 5 is years away, so Ive tried my best to like this, but with the multiple disconnects, nerfs, &amp; griefers I'm thinking I may just go back to modded fallout 4, where I can wander the wasteland douche free
---
Ok but isn't nerfing TSE and Explosive is the first step to "taking a hard look and rebalancing them all"?
---
It's much easier to take to legendary mods that have 100% bonus damage each and AOE in the case of explosive and bring them more online with the other legendary modifiers than it is to upper all the other modifers and tweak all the enemies in the game accordingly.
---
Except me. Mine dropped for me.
---
What level loot did you get, 30?
---
The difference between hitting it and holding it &lt;.&lt;
---
I had that happen last week, and it was happening to the Super mutants as well
---
Spacesuits and straight jackets are my go-this for emptying vendor caps. 
---
Nothing brings me more joy than killing them with my super sledge because despite playing 2h melee with no armor, I do run fireproof and damage avoidance perks and they can‚Äôt kill me before I hit them. 
---
Last group who did this was also using the drop grenades on death perk and that was a nasty surprise, thankfully marsupial jump gets you clear. 
---
But it‚Äôs a crapshoot. If you don‚Äôt get ghouls then it‚Äôs a useless nuke zone. Not to mention it seems to crash much more often
---
It is obvious, but only to people who play on PC. Jargon is funny like that. I can tell you are different from me, but cannot discern why.
---
I‚Äôm loathe to admit it, but the need for places to find particular (and ever changing) types of scrap actually has a huge positive role in driving my environmental exploration instead of just endlessly farming queens for the next prime plan you‚Äôre supposed to get on your personal progression list. And when it makes me revisit these places, I end up getting to know them better than as a passer by. 
---
Oh my God.  I do this to the robots in watoga with a pistol.  Cripple their legs so they crawl around then just leave them there...
---
Of limited usefulness but interesting. 
---
no i was just confused about whether ‚Äúkitchen stove‚Äù or ‚Äúcooking stove‚Äù and which one was the functional one for a friend.
---
This. You have almost one ‚òùÔ∏è n ten chance of actually getting ghouls to spawn and then if you do you will probably crash soon after entering the nuke zone
---
Both of those characters are such cartoons.  Neither of them belong in the game.  It undermines how great the voice acting is for, say, the Overseer.
---
‚Äúholster my gun...‚Äù
---
Dumb question please. What is the key to do that‚Äôs?  I could not figure it out.  ‚òπÔ∏è
---
[facepalm]  The /s indicates sarcasm. 
---
I think that would take a lot of effort, and if they EVER put that kinda work in, you'd be paying $6 per weapon type and armor type in the atom shop. Because that's what they legitimately think their skins are worth, apparently. 
---
That depends on the platform. 250-300 is Xbox prices.
---
PS4 is more towards 500-1k
---
And PC is like a grand, grand and a half last I knew. 
---
I built a sky maze at the Billings homestead and then invited people in the world to try it out. It was enjoyed by a few until 2 lvl 160 guys came and destroyed it. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and other than everyone‚Äôs been great. I was kinda ticked, does the game  have a report option? Is that a reportable offense? 
---
Hey you stole my camp spot!
---
I've not seen a single person with these unlocked. They seem to be missing. If someone says they have them, I would like to see pictures.
---
Seems pretty ridiculous for these people to purposely spend time trying to ruin the game for others. I'm spending too much time server hopping to save my base. My wife then has to jump to my new world and reteam and we lose whatever events we were doing. 
---
bit of a follow up question but can you attack them without them fighting back
---
I often get random requests to team up from people I don't know. I will look on the map and I can never find them or they are very far away. I assume that this is their way of getting a free Fast Travel to my position?
---
Pretty much what my wife and I have done. Stopped after about a week and a half post launch because once you get more than ankle deep you start realizing how just broken the game is from a technical and design standpoint.
---
Still pop in to see the current progress from the post launch beta to an actual release ready game - drop the occasional suggestion or eyeroll the ‚Äúno the game is fine you should be happy to have given BSG a couple hundred dollar interest free loan, YOooooooUuuuuuuTuuuuubbbbeee!!!!!!!!!!!‚Äù post.
---
Weren't there AoE sustained staves or spells? Hold down for continuous cast or something? I haven't played in forever. 
---
Lmao how do you know if it follows the base chemistry if you haven‚Äôt even played the previous games. I‚Äôve played all since Fallout 1 do you really think you know how the games are supposed to be like?
---
He should be banned 
---
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
---
Yeah, a mess of us do that with stuff, and/or just drop bags. Legenadries we can't use and can't sell, plans and recipies we know, magazines/bobbleheads/chems we'll never use, ammo we don't want.  Building materials we have in excess...
---
I've logged in once. I beat the weird jumping athletic challenge thing in 3 hours and then never played again.
---
It's a good spot.  I think we both have good taste in camp locations.
---
If you got one-shotted there‚Äôs a few methods he could have used legitimately to accomplish this. 
---
1). You have a workshop. He ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù it but not really. This marks you as hostile. 
---
2). You have a teammate who made him marked hostile, which means the whole team is now hostile to him. 
---
The other possibility is he‚Äôs a bobble duper, in which case he‚Äôs using two exploits to grief. 
---
I feel like one handed melee is pretty unpopular, because the damage doesn't compare to 2H melee.  Couple in the fact that Grounded mutation debuffs a portion of your energy damage, the burn effect of the shishkebab becomes way less desirable.  If there was some kind of shield option for a gladiator build, I think that would make shishkebabs and baseball bats much more appealing.
---
I personally think the weapon looks incredibly cool and I keep a legendary hunter/faster swing speed/90% weight reduced version as my melee option for my stealth rifleman.  Someone left it in a trash bag during a whitesprings nuke.  Given that the only time I use it is when fending off mole rats and saving ammo against low level enemies, it's pretty awesome for my character.  It weighs less than a bowl of soup.
---
What is a stealth boy mod? 
---
Oh nice! Thanks for the info! I just moved to a lead deposit in Toxic Valley near the water park. Maybe I should think about moving again...
---
I haven't played in forever myself. 
---
That‚Äôs an even bigger reward. 
---
SBQ doesn‚Äôt come to people. People go to the SBQ. 
---
I'll throw so much money if they release a Nuka Cola T-51
---
I just figured this out this morning, so you're certainly not alone on this! (Was trying to figure out why what I thought was a power attack wasnt doing 40% more power attack damage with my Grognak's Axe)
---
These people are always bountied in my situation, though. And no other players are nearby who don't have bounties. 
---
That's weirdly defensive.
---
There are plenty of other ways to get damage reduction other than sentinel. To your own point, to paraphrase, "because I want to jetpack" is just fine and more valid than "to run from enemies".
---
r/gamingcirclejerk
---
It'll still be a top tier weapon after the nerf. 
---
Bulking doesn‚Äôt do anything except let you sell junk that otherwise would not be able to be sold because of its 0 value. 
---
The ONLY exceptions to this I know of are Aluminum and Lead, which have their weight significantly reduced by bulking. Any other noticed weight reductions are because of the consumption of plastic to make the bulk packs. 
---
That would be amazing 
---
With your little retinue of harmless zombies like Michonne from Walking Dead
---
Just happened to me. Oddly enough it‚Äôs always after I die that way I donate all my junk to whoever comes across it. You suck bethesda. 
---
I do that.
---
Once you hit endgame, there's farming nuke zones and SBQ and that's it. We need some trade routes, some ways to expand camps, emotes to sit and drink at a bar, ways to play the board games in the world with one another. Books we can write in. Notes we can post. Arenas to build and lure monsters into to fight in gladiatorial combat and take bets on with an in-game interface to support it. More wires and devices to string together into complex machines. 
---
It really is ridiculous for them to go around trying to ruin another player's day.  I would hope that people who read our comments realize that most players are friendly and the griefers are a minority in the community.
---
Added. 
---
There‚Äôs another I‚Äôm on with almost daily and we‚Äôre similar level. 
---
I said that about Star Citizen 5 years ago when I was single and in college, now I gotta wait till my grandchildren graduate.
---
Thank you for clarifying, and apologies for not being clear but he was killing with one shot without us engaing in PVP. In other words we were not marked as hostile. Hope this helps.
---
Until you shoot them. If you can one-hit them though that‚Äôs not an issue. 
---
It'd be such a great addition like some responders survived and got into a vault it'd be really cool to see them come out of the vault then be around the map 
---
Enlighten me then, because it seems you have no compelling argument whatsoever. You keep saying I do not know what the game is supposed to be, yet have said nothing included.
---
Hopping servers allows you to mutate straight away.
---

Joint with Class Freak they're pretty good.. not great. But I would love to remove empath and herd mentality.

Not worth it, Bethesda will take majority of your profits anyway

It quite however it appears the windmill is too large a base

Then you‚Äôre dealing with people just looking to kill. If they both have bounties then they are both actively engaging in fights against people who aren‚Äôt fighting back, or actively destroying camps. Not as good of a strategy because they can‚Äôt see others on the map.
---
Also keep in mind you can‚Äôt see a player that is crouched on the map. 
---
Well now I use the known plans and perk loadouts... They are so good.
---
Well, if that true, it still reduces the number of assets the engine servers are tracking.
---
Interesting idea. Maybe you could enter a maximum amount like "hey, make this item font color red whenever it reaches more than 3lbs" or something.   
---
Somewhat legendary weapons/apparel are (for most probably) easy to spot on your inventory. But you can definitely carry some "hidden" weight. Like when you realize how much those 80 Rad-X you have are weighting 20, those 90 RadAway...etc

You need a lawyer to advise you of the pitfalls of casual franchising offers.

Honestly I don't want to know what's in that room. As someone that is a professional creator (illustrator), I dislike it when people do this. Why steal someone's thunder? No matter what you think about them.

Spoiling things is just the lowest.

Who says they will drop loot or give experience?

The whitesprings robots don‚Äôt and these shouldn‚Äôt either.  They are meant to be a deterrent

Will let the team know about this thread. Thanks Egor for taking the time to make this post.
---
So I assume you don't play fallout 76 and is just trolling on the reddit? Or the delay you have is months away? 
---
I went there initially because of the proximity to white springs when me and my friend were farming nuke zones for levels. Now I stay for the views!
---
I had this problem. 
---
A subsequent generation of its design had the movable core (about 80% of the camp) as a blueprint, and the specialized nook-filling bits on top. 
---
If I have to move, I dismantle the structure from the previous camp, then use the blueprint, then redo the last 20% manually. 
---
That both massively reduces the effort of rebuilding, as well as allowing me to rapidly plant the core with all the functionals at workshops.

1000 rolls got me a vampires swing speed board.
---
I knew that the loot system was a joke, but this is just player cruelty.
---
I'm on PC too. Sometimes the Queen dosn't even despawn after everyone has looted. Sometimes she turns into a meat patty too quick (like you said). I've seen people take 5 minutes to find her meat patty hidden with all the others in the long grass. Twice I've seen her morph into green goo and be unlootable. She is the size of a house - her meat pile should be huge!
---
Yes. It does. 
---
It would also allow items to be traded to other players for fractional caps. Let‚Äôs say I want to sell springs at 1/2 caps each. I can‚Äôt in raw form, but if I bulk I can sell the bulk packs for 5 caps each (coming out to 1/2 cap per spring). 
---
PVP in this game is fun when you know how to counter the meta builds, and learn the game mechanics.
---
What do you define as a long term player? How many times will doing the same pve content keep you amused? All the bots are boring, mothman is the closest thing to a fun fight. Teleporting mole rats, and immortal "longdogs" have got to be the worst. Do you think any future bot AI is going to be better or just have more health/armor?
---
We can each kill the queen in \~five minutes without tse/exploits so we are certainly past the next updates farming stage.  My hope is they keep the atom shop pumping out stuff for the whales to keep buying, and switching to either free to play or free to try\*  to get more players into the fo76 world. Since the fo community is too antisocial for a multiplayer game of this nature.  The pvp players don't post/whine/complain as often because we adapt to game changes  and accept that we can't win every time, while pve ~~carebears~~ players feel *entitled* to win, calling grief at every social interaction.

theres no recoil with any melee if u spam click fast enough

Remove the username, this sub doesn‚Äôt allow witch-hunts.
---
Or like some raiders who held out. 
---
Or like half the vault turned on themselves n some are good some are evil n they need you to lead which ever faction you choose out into the wasteland and establish a camp. Which could be your own camp and you could assign random ppl to tasks like in fallout4. So each person when completing this quest could have a group of 3-5 settlers that would look evil, chemed out, nice , family whatever working in there camps. N it would be so much crazier to have random players attack your camp n kill some of your settlers. Because for the size of the camp you can build at least we level 124 I could totally add three more beds no problem

VATS should never target teammates since you can't hurt them anyway. If you have pacifist on, it should ignore players. Also, DON'T WIPE MY TARGERTING JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE STEPS BETWEEN US.

Or maybe like a pop up bar or something? I know there was one for game of thrones, walking dead, and the office and they‚Äôve done pretty well! I think maybe Fallout themed drinks would go over better, and you could serve a few themed tapas or something. Just a thought!

I know it‚Äôs random since it was in s place I know well.

That'd be fuckin sweet. I'd personally prefer some enclave assaultrons doing the runs for me it'd also be cool to have them just go around with you like having one or two I'd have a dog and a protectron. Or even have your group or bots whatever roam to different camps to trade with other players

I‚Äôll be on tomorrow sound okay?

Yeah I gotta stock up and get my buds to catch up. So I have some backup.

In this game there is no forever.

Except when the food processor at Mama Dulce's eats your best armor or weapon. *That* is forever.

Stating a username and saying ‚Äúhey this guy is a cheater/duper/griefer‚Äù is a witch-hunt. We can‚Äôt independently validate what you say and your actions are considered encouraging action against a user or ‚Äúnaming and shaming‚Äù both of which are prohibited here.

I love Watoga.  I usually keep my camp right outside of town.  Two separate vendors, occasional legendaries, assaultron farming, and cranberries.  I'm suprised I dont see more camps there, as it gives you a free quick travel spot almost opposite of 76.
---
I would if they didn‚Äôt bite me from time to time. 
---
You are welcome
---
Peace homie

I would argue it‚Äôs easier solo. If you have power armor and a decent weapon, it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard.

Hold down the reload button.  Unless you've played many Fallout titles, it's never explained.  On PC, it's the R key.  I have no idea on consoles.

There's no reason to force a dichotomy. Surely there's a spectrum between standing still and jetpacking around that "dodging" and "not dodging" can both fall in.
---
You don't have to be defensive. It's fine. You didn't like the sarcasm. It's okay.

Usually, yes. Sometimes they're griefers who just want to see where your camp is so they can smash it up.

Thank you for taking the time to make this long post mate, it is really appreciated. Your feedback is incredibly useful.

Given the smarts of the Enclave in this game, I‚Äôm amazed their west coast brethren didn‚Äôt accidentally set off the nuke on the oil rig themselves.

Mine would be another Tab in the Pip-boy. So everything you tag for sale ends up there. So if i have 20 stimpaks and only need 5, you could tag 5 as a minimum and the rest get auto tagged for sale and go into into the tagged for sale tab. So i can just go to a vendor and hit a button to sell everything possible in the tagged for sale.

Likely put there just to taunt us with its existence

Super mutants are pretty funny I always enjoy going to value research center for my steel and listening to em. Grahams is decent I wish there was more I could do with him though

I went for the view and the central location.  I fast travel to SBQ a lot so it saves me some caps while giving easy access to two vendors.

ow well dunno then.

Do this quests, kill everything in sight. Maybe get a high level buddy to help you kill more xp bosses but make sure you get a shot in. The more you build your camp n create chems n repair items levels you up too

Just follow fresh Vault Dwellers, and make mildly creepy noises near them.

still bugged, it does sometimes fire 2 missiles, not every time, and the tooltip is still bugged as well.

There's your problem right there, then. You need to get actual cables to connect your modem to your PS4/Xbox/computer if you're going to be doing these huge downloads. Wireless connections are fine for things like web browsing and streaming music and such, but you need the right tool for the right job. 
---
I tend to give away there, and will do so until building my own geo caches and containers becomes an option. If I am moving items to another character I go somewhere far from stations and the vault and hide it, after walking both characters out there (usually near one of my camps). Then I rejoin the world via my friend list and claim the stuff. 
---
Me too, I felt like he could have been sillier. But I really think they missed an opportunity to add a quest for him like escort him through the red zone or something n he would give legendary plans or all his stuff would become 50% off for five mins.

This made me laugh a little harder than I care to admit. Thanks OP.

Here‚Äôs my Graham story.   I always go to camp before logging off for the night.  Two nights ago I login, and after waiting on the long login screen I spawn in and notice a super mutant wailing on my camp wall.  I sneak closer and notice it was him.  Turrets going crazy, he‚Äôs got one wall down and working on another one.  I walk up to him and hit R to trade, the menu comes up, and he turns to me and stops.  I don‚Äôt see anything I want, leave the trading menu, and he turns back around and keeps wailing on the wall.  I hit trade again, he turns around, the the window closes and he vanished!  
---
I repaired the walls and all continued as normal except my indicator still showed danger.  I scouted the entire area, found nothing.   
---
I guess he was moseying around and my camp fell on him as it materialized lol.

Bruh. You can't say "you don't have to dodge them" and then give running as an option, then start talking like I'm pushing some sort of dichotomy.

You said you don't have to dodge. Then suggested running away. You fucked up. It's okay.

the swing is two handed, but when you walk in third person, you hold it in one hand at your waist instead of carrying it at your chest with two hands like a sledge, pitchfork or spear.  It's considered a one handed weapon.
---
If you're not sure, go into third person and look at the "resting" state of the weapon.  If you drop it to your waist with one hand, it's a single handed melee that benefits from Gladiator perks.  If you hold it at chest level with two hands, it's a two handed Slugger weapon.
---
It's easiest to see in 3rd person.  It's always just over the shoulder for me by default, but you can hold down the zoom button and pull back on the mouse or view joystick quite a ways to increase your field of view.  Took me a while to figure that out accidentally.

Morgantown HS is one. Usually get around 100-150 depending on how thorough you are, along with a few springs.

Whitesprings has tons of golf balls (I know, duh, it‚Äôs a golf course). There‚Äôs also a trash can out back of the golf club with some plastic trash in it. Nuka-Cola cup stacks (or cups w/ lid) contain plastic too.

That‚Äôs... that‚Äôs the exact thing that‚Äôs prohibited by the rules of this sub. How would you feel if another user started posing your username everywhere calling for avoiding/reports for bad behavior? It could result in your account being banned or your experience being ruined because another user made a claim without proof. 
---
Even if you are 100% accurate and the other user is 100% in the wrong, you‚Äôre not allowed to name them in this manner because we do not want to set an abusable precedent. If this behavior were common place, much like in the Salem witch trials, accusations become accepted at face value without investigation and punishments are levied without proof or cause. It‚Äôs a dangerous game to play.

I think Morgantown High School has lots of plastic pumpkins and plastic forks.

As soon as it was over the factory behind us just exploded with supermutants. They were piled 5-deep in some rooms by the time we were done, they just kept coming in waves, and would‚Äôve just destroyed this dude.

Generally speaking, it's better to have one of each - Slugger, Expert Slugger and Master Slugger.  For 3 points, you get +30% damage, as opposed to +20% damage with a rank-3 version of those.  I went in with two-handed, but found myself gravitating into one-handed and unarmed based on the Legendaries I acquired and the tendency for higher-level enemies to block attacks.

Oh snap you mentioned that? My bad. And yeah, but separate developers almost never communicate with each other unless they‚Äôre collaborating. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs out of competition or dislike for each other, just that developing video games swamps you with endless amounts of work you‚Äôre too busy to do that kind of stuff. Yet another reason why big publishers are horrible at listening to fans (most of the time).

As a rule of thumb, the last mod for most weapons will take you 20 further scraps on average. You can get unlucky, of course.

The only change you can make is to level it up - you do this through the crafting menu on your weapons workbench, not modify, and basically use the old one and some parts to make a new, better one.

This happened to me tonight in a nuke zone while I had about 40+ glowing ghouls on me and I couldn‚Äôt find the original that I tagged. It lasted about 2-3 minutes until I eventually took too many rads and died. I couldn‚Äôt get into any menu, no button would work outside of my stimpaks and aim and shoot. Was pretty annoying! First time it never went away, but probably was due to not finding the original target and killing it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I couldn't exactly provide any great deal of information. All I know is that as soon as I stopped using it, I've gone 6 hours without crashing.

I could crash as soon as I enter areas, or loaded into them. Everywhere you go enemies will generally respawn as soon as you load into areas, so perhaps the targeting hud could have a crash associated with that.

Hope you get banned for continuing to break this rule even after the mods keep removing your other posts

Swing Speed is always better, Power Attacks consume AP and if you don't have enough protection you're gonna need that AP to get away from the Queen's AOE attacks. Plus you can be cancelled out of Power Attacks which the Scorched will probably do, it's also better to get as much damage in as possible before the Queen goes back into the sky and starting a Power Attack but then the Queen flies back up causing you to waste AP is the worst.
---
TL;DR: Swing Speed is better

Agreed the PC port is amazingly bad in this game, apparently it wasn't important to the developers. I find my way through the mess with a combination of in-game remapping and AHK remapping. I don't bash with my weapons, it's too problematic. I have two little buttons on top of my Razer mouse behind the wheel that I use to throw frags after loading them with the 6 button. But it's funky.

Yeah I was rushing that objective because all I want to do is drop a nuke! Lol

Just seems a little odd if you ask me. The numbers above are in order of how they appear in the challenges menu. Where any of the other challenges have some variation of 76 in them, these are binary. Seems strange to do that without any reason.

---
That's my unarmed
---
Yea that‚Äôs easier said than done for finding. Quite sure the Flamer itself isn‚Äôt a meme weapon. Finding meme effects is definitely harder for me.
---
Ahhh.  Thanks!
---
Lead pipes and buzz blades? Cool. Will add to the list.
---
Combat knife = Rambo build. Knives, crossbow and grenades. 
---
What a kneecapoerror.
---
One thing to note is that Cafeteria Trays are plastic (but not TV Dinner Trays, which look almost identical).  The last time I went on a plastic run, I found AVR Medical Center was pretty fruitful for this very reason.
---
Pssh I have no clue where he is. I've been playing sense release and I've only seen him four times. Friends online tell me he tends to spawn around your camp, but I've never seen him around my camp not once. And I've had my camp in four different locations now. So no clue. Just randomly? Lol
---
It actually shows you the raw value in your inventory. The Vendor gives you a % of that based on Charisma/Drugs/Perks. So while you don't know exactly how much you will get, you know that that item listed as 200Caps will get you more then a 20cap item.
---
They have one, its a Walmart exclusive but its sold out [LINK](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Funko-POP-Games-Fallout-S2-Power-Armor-Nuka-Cola-Walmart-Exclusive/800061855) 
---
Try ebay if you really want one.
---
Yeah I saw that, it was at such a good price too
---
Add me dude. 
---
was just in the heat of the moment, still peeved but, cant do much about it
---
I used to come across them quite a bit.  Been a while since I've seen one.
---
Oof 
---
Welp Atleast you know to be better prepared next time. You got to also think about this, you‚Äôre clearing out 2 high level areas, the silo AND the nuke area (even harder if you decide to go against the scorchbeast queen). Definitely have better gear for next time, helps a whole lot. 
---
I didn‚Äôt do bunker the first time until I was in my X-01 power armor repaired up to 200% and had some TSE weapons, that definitely helps too . (Haven‚Äôt done it solo yet tho) 
---
also, your not being an ass, and I do apprecciate that
---
I'm not sure that it's "instead". The 44 revolver definitely has both double and quad, as I found both of those.
---
Also found a couple of quad lever rifles.
---
Was sold in a New Year's bundle; appreciate it thank you.
---
Do it! Make your character look like home too 
---
Hey thanks for the love :)
---
Because Skyrim, that's why. Just in case asks...
---
Do I have a map for you! I did not create it and take no credit.
---

---
Likely underground or halfway to Virginia. 
---
I have a handmade like that.
---
Well another perk for me to drop that's the only reason I have it.
---
Because Elder Scrolls and Fallout are exactly the same Genre, right?
---
Yet another newbie, thinks they know what everyone else thinks, etc.
---
Sounds more like you wanna play D&amp;D with all the gate keeping...
---
Might be an afk molerat. I've had a few.
---
That's really bizarre. I shot him several times during my post above and he never turned hostile on me. But then, this is only the 2nd time I've run into him so I dunno what his normal behavior is...
---
I think some heavies can‚Äôt have quad (otherwise that 50 would have been 1000rd capacity). I can‚Äôt confirm though.  
---
Watoga high school has tons of plastic utensils, plates, halloween pumpkins and other plastic items.  There's a chem station for scrap breakdown upstairs in the science lab.  Alternately, the cooking area of Flatwoods has a lot of plastic items that will respawn with a server hop.  Grafton High has a good amount, on the eastern side of town.
---
Your lightest and most common option is to always check cigarette machines.  They are everywhere.  Not only are packs light and yield you plastic, cloth and asbestos, but you can sell the raw asbestos to vendors for 1 cap a unit with a base weight of 0.1 without any wight or haggling perks involved.  Not the most efficient vendoring method, but a little excess stack of asbestos is readily available and helpful to get that last cap out of each vendor.  You get your plastic, plus vendor fodder.
---
I don't know what you're using plastic for, but only acid, aluminum and lead are viable for bulking to reduce stash weight.  The other bulks actually weigh more per unit as of 1/21/19.  That may change (and should) with future patches.  Shotgun users are always happy when I drop excess plastic.
---
I think this is a SHITTY FUCKING idea. As it is, the vast majority of players use the "drop" ability to transfer items in a less cumbersome way when they aren't charging caps, and to leave items for others they don't need.   
---
This is a "burn the bridge down because the felon might use it" level stupidity. 
---
I actually like the token idea quite a bit. Have an "arming the troups" quest.  Give tokens that can be traded for stimpacks, random legendarys, patterns, etc.
---
Yep, scared the living hell out of me!  Thought it was the Flatwoods monster, &gt;!but it was a damn Terminal . . .!&lt;
---
SAME!
---
Dps is everything against the sbq so probably swing speed
---
To be fair, this game knocks off half of borderlands, and borderlands had this. 
---
Combat knife does go well with the crossbow and grenades. I could name her after Rambo's girlfriend from First Blood Part II.
---
Awesome! I found my first polymer combat armor chest piece today (a reward item for completing Grafton Day) and scrapped it, but didn't get the mod for any part of the combat armor. It's looking to me like there is a random chance to learn a mod, but the item you are scrapping must also have that mod equipped to have a chance to learn it (Hence why scrapping 22 base power armor helmets did nothing, but scrapping a single helmet gave me the ability to craft the helmets.) . So I have to keep hoping for the items to drop modded AND that I randomly learn their mod when scrapping them...rather irritating.
---
Yeah, he wasn‚Äôt interested in attacking me, just my camp.  
---
Hmm now that I think about it, I should have looked around more carefully for some critters that may have been attacking the camp instead.  Maybe they were really what he was after but we hidden from me somehow.  
---
If you play with a partner, have your mule alts on each on the other‚Äôs accounts. 
---
Officer highly suspect of rape has his orders.
---
One, that's...not true? Or at least, I've observed it to not be true, I've been in teams with people and i'd drop something, disconnect, re-connect to the same server, and the bag would still be there. Two, if that's the case and my experiences are odd "bethesda features" wouldn't the same be true for shit left in a chest or suitcase or whatever?
---
If you say so.
---
I supplied 6 fluxes and 400 caps for 5 serums 2 weeks ago on ps4.
---
Was going to be 4 for 1100.
---
Japan.
---
watoga high school, clear it. then run south the crazy cat ladies house, clear it. boom 400+ plastic. 
---
I have tinkered around with the Laser Rifle and in their current state they do seem pretty much perfect for the difficulty angle I am trying to achieve.
---
That was known at launch
---
Let me just tab out real quick t-and I've killed a neutral, his friends don't like me.
---
It's not even really about "killing yourself" - though it can happen - it's about there being two radically different actions bound to the same key... *for no reason* (on PC). If I want to Power Attack twice in a row, I shouldn't have to be worried about accidentally throwing a grenade in melee range. If I want to quickly throw a grenade when enemies clump up, I shouldn't have situations where I punch empty air instead. 
---
Yep I‚Äôve put In close to 100 hours, still have several places on the map to explore and about to hit level 60 so plenty of perks to unlock still. I‚Äôll probably get another 20-30 hours out of it so worth the money imo. 
---
I'm on Xbox as well and can happily say I've never been attacked by a player. Dwellers are the nicest people in the wasteland in my book. It's one of the true joys of the game.
---
Cups are actually cloth. The straws are plastic.
---
I cleared out lewisburg grabbing everything and noticed that.
---
It‚Äôs not low reward if you know how to pick your mark.  Just like real raiders, it requires though and strategy. 
---
A wanted player out farming?  Easy loot. Someone in their camp just hanging out? You‚Äôd be lucky to get anything besides the caps. 
---
Raider life ..blood in..blood out..throws gang signs
---
You guys didn‚Äôt know this was bad till just now? Depressing!
---
Is the Welcome Home sign an Atom Shop item?  If so, you can‚Äôt place it at another‚Äôs camp unless they also have it unlocked (and I‚Äôm not even sure then but don‚Äôt know)
---
Huh were the down votes for calling the game easy? Sorry if I offended people.
---
Anyone have any experience with throwing knifes? I haven't played around with them but a throwing knife/flaming chainsaw build sounds like it could be a lot of fun...
---
Nah, it's alright. You offered "the one right way" to play for yourself and it's silly. Jetpacking around is pointless - unless you enjoy it. That's fine. That was your response to an endgame build opinion - that the "one right way" for you was against the grain.
---
No one fucked up here. It's fine.
---
Crazy cat lady house? Is that the actual name? Cuz this I have not seen. 
---
I guess that works too, but the burning mine is its own separate thing on the northeast side of the ash heap. It has better enemies and loot imo, there are some animals for meat and the final room has a crowned or legendary mole miner, ghoul, or wendigo. Belching betty only has scorched afaik
---
Camden park is best, has low lvl mobs to not cause harm, has a vendor, has a weapon bench. Server hop.
---
I kill scorch beast in a few seconds, a couple of hits. Once it lands
---
Exactly, I need shotgun ammo
---
I don't think arches actually hurt you, do they?  I think it's just an "oooff" sound effect.  If they actually damage you, it must be like 1 hp a tick.  That seems fair to me for free rad cleansing.
---
The enclave is evil.  I'm happy to buy their power armor mods and mutations, but they are grade-A creeps.
---
It is an atom shop deal. I‚Äôll have to check if it‚Äôs possible or not. Good question. 
---
PS4, but thanks. 
---
Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm is a food factory workshop that can be captured.  You can use the terminal to select the food you want to create, once you have captured and connected the machine to the power terminal.    It‚Äôs output is too low for my liking though. 
---
Fair.
---
It's part of the Heart of the Swamp Event.  I think it's called a Strangler Heart.  The flower is vulnerable when it opens, and then it spews a toxic cloud that spawns enemies and closes.
---
It looks like the plant that you have to eventually kill during the event ‚ÄúHeart of the swamp‚Äù if memory serves.
---
I hear ya.  I‚Äôm like a psychopathic Frank Lloyd Wright. If your ‚Äúfort‚Äù is a monstrosity, defying physics of the Natural World, then i get itchy non TSE trigger finger with my Golf Clubs.  
---
There's one workshop with a food processor machine that you just need to power.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sunshine_Meadows_industrial_farm
---
I did it today. Got bloated glowing ghouls galore and farmed it for an hour until the server crashed everyone out. It's legit.
---
Why are you putting "one right way" in quotes? When did I ever say anything about one way to do something? You're the one saying jetpacks are pointless, and that non-PA is the "one right way" to play.
---
You're the only one trying to tell people how to do things here.
---
Thanks everyone.
---
Don't ever lose it/sell it/scrap it. Once it's gone, you can't get another (unless you "find" one). It is needed to craft a higher level version. I've been trying to get back into the mansion to see if I could replicate a new one, but can not get passed security.  Yes, wearing all the stuff from the quest as required. 
---
This though. Especially when I die it's a 50/50 chance I took too far of a jump off a building/mountain üòÖüòÇ
---
Is it odd that I‚Äôve put in close to 100 hours and never ran into Grahm? I don‚Äôt even really know where to look for him. 
---
Or you could just get martial artist and a power attack ss and be doing the same swing but more damage??
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** zipster8! ^(hug)
---
I'm really not. I'm the one saying there are tons of options and you're telling me my options are invalid and forcing you into a box because it doesn't involve a jetpack. ;)
---
nope, just a house full of cat bowls... and cat. yes, there are cats in there. 
---
I have tons of mods loaded up on mine, nothing that will put me at an unfair advantage I'll add, but I very rarely disconnect. Who knows what's causing it haha
---
What outfit is that?
---
That would explain why it wasn‚Äôt on the list though..
---
The level 40 Ripper, it does 16 damage per second and is by far the worse melee weapon without modification
---
I want a legendary golf outfit!
---
Are you crazy?
---
You literally started this thread by dismissing jetpacks as "not endgame worthy" in relation to sentinel.
---
That was the end of your very first post.
---
I have never said sentinel isn't worth using.
---
You said jetpacks aren't worth using.
---
What is wrong with your brain?
---
I mean, it's still going to wreck fucking face...
---
Easy for you to say, I use tse weapons to kill enemies and randoms keep getting in the way of the blast radius. A lvl 150 got in the way and now I got a 150 cap bounty on my ass
---
Chainsaw has 2, but yea I‚Äôll put that one in there too.
---
I've had this happen to me multiple times at this point..the toxic asshat population in this game isn't new. It's the demographic Bethesda was trying to draw in with this title to begin with. 
---
add me bro Chronic\_Coit. 
---
What? I see what's happening.
---
As a whole, the thread started with PA being an endgame goal. I disagreed. You showed up to say you love your jetpack.
---
Who has the broken choo-choo of thought here? You aren't even in the right topic.
---
pipe rifle seems a lot less accurate, especially in VATS, which kinda defeats the purpose of it for me. or could that be because my pipe rifle is TS?
---
If youre on pc theres a mod you can download
---
About how far south? I must see this. 
---
eNcLaVe dInT dO nUfFiN 
---
I remember attacking a guys base and it turned into this whole ordeal. I don‚Äôt even remember why I destroyed his base either. He tried to stop me and died several times trying. After he realized he couldn‚Äôt beat me he got help. Long story short he got 3 of his friends to come after me so it was 1v4 and lasted over an hour and the energy plant (Poseidon I think it‚Äôs called). 
---
One of his friends had a pretty decent melee build like me so it was basically whoever landed the hit first won. It looked like a fight out of an anime, lots of running, jumping and trying to land the hit lmao. Without a doubt the most fun I‚Äôve had on the game so far. Really can‚Äôt wait until there‚Äôs more people PvPing. The raider play style is so much fun.
---
I only had maybe 3 people bother me. One when I was starting out because I forgot about water and rads damage, he was swearing at me and being obnoxious. His girlfriend in the background asked him if he was being nice. No, he was not but at least he wasn't attacking me.
---
Then 2 players attacked me when my husband started playing, probably thinking he was my mule or something. I met him at vault 76 and wanted to give him some ammo and stimpaks. My bad I guess.
---
But overall, out of all the players I've met, 3 people being jerks is nothing.
---
I was after the clean spacesuit; accidentally scrapped mine. Finally got it after about 15 vendor reloads lol
---
 I could have called em Raiders but they were more like rouge Enclave really. I just enjoy this kind of thing. I guess griefer is not the best word but it gets the point across.
---
 Don't get me wrong. I think the twisted scummy bastards stalking the innocent are absolutely necessary. ;)
---
I'd like to see grahm vs the queen
---
At least OP's restaurant will have a long legacy...even after raiders flood the town, people will still be coming in for some food, maybe even a preserved pie
---
Only reason i go up there is the spot on the road inbetween hemlock holes and clancy manor is one of the random encounter locations
---
I wish I would have seen this while I was reloading his stock I would have sent you an invite too. My bad man‚òπ
---
Now I'm regretting vendoring my 3 star rolling pin. 
---
I've run across a unexploded nuke before. You can disarm them, if you do it right you get some good loot also. Not sure what happens if you fuck it up though. Guessing BOOM
---
I reckon Bethesda should read up on my feedback post about adding containers and customized functionality displays / storage as one of the types. It‚Äôs in my /u and Marsupials Herd announcements sub
---
Same. Sometimes the game loads fast enough it's not an issue, but more than half the time this happens unless I wait until it finishes. Being able to equip my gun is usually the sign it's safe to open my pip.
---
Good luck. 
---
I failed that miserably. I launch them quite irresponsibly. 
---
Wow Xbox moderation got worse? I used to enjoy profane messages directed towards me - they were like unofficial trophies.
---
Til raiders don't attack ppl but attack inanimate objects.
---
Mountain momma
---
MMm but that Super sledge though..
---
For lever rifle plans go between Lewisburg and Welch train stations. If it is not there change servers. You don't have to fight much at all and the fast travel between them is fairly cheap. I got it while level ~43.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KEPaCyrvbe8
---
Not the best video. But it asks the simple numbers question. How many people bought it. And how many are still playing fo76. 
---
Nah, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs no actual harm, I just have a weird mental image of them adding the zappy bits just to be sadistic (or low key masochistic, I guess either scenario works as ‚Äúbonus‚Äù pain)
---
I can send you the clip of me murdering power armored men with these weapons.
---
I‚Äôm a melee build so some of these weapons actually hit pretty hard.
---
I mean its not that hard to nuke places
---
Just focus fire on the Scorch Beasts. I know the temptation to nuke the Brotherhood is strong, but we have to prioritize. 
---
Honestly sounds like y‚Äôall are crying. 
---
Decon showers, jetpack plans, ultracite ammo etc.
---
My dude, I already said it, *I don't even use a Jetpack, or power armor.*
---
I just think you're wrong, and you sound like a dismissive twat.
---
So full Rambo and axe the Garb of Mysteries? That would give me a role playing reason to use the LMG on bosses too. I am liking this idea more and more.
---
I'm hopeful that Stash Increases+Vendors will ease this a bit. But I'd also like to see something to do with the spare legendarys. Either scrapping them, or some sort of quest turn in.
---
It might be nice for the economy if there was a daily quest or two that required common legendary. 
---
Ie "Daily: Arming The Troops" 
---
Which could be something along the lines of:
---
* "Bring _____ a Mutant Chestpiece"  
---
or
---
* "Bring _____ an Assasins Dagger"
---
Each time you bring it what it wants, it'll give you some prize TBD and gives you another quest. After a couple the quests get harder, demanding a certain type of chest piece (Metal/Leather/etc) or a 2nd Legendary attribute. 
---
Once you get to a point you can't give it what it wants, you gotta wait till the next day to start again with the easiest. 
---
If you don't have what it wants, you will have to go find it, either by farming or finding a another player with it, encouraging some trade once vendors are here.
---
It would act as a bit of an automatic release valve, gobbling up large amounts of Crappy 1Star Items at first, and gobbling up rarer and higher star items as Gear levels increase and people no longer want their 2 star and 3 star items. 
---
Basically, if it's not worth using, someone will turn it into the quest. 
---
Now what the quest could give.. there's lots of options. Random Legendarys, Outfits. Caps, Atoms, Supplies, Recipes, etc.
---
But I'm fairly fond of the idea of caps and/or atoms, just because we're so limited on our daily cap and atom gains.  This'd need to be tuned carefully of course.
---
It's possible - there are locations on the map where one can camp and there's also "world containers" in that space.
---
You on PC?  I keep 100 units of plastic in my stash and dump the rest for others in blue suitcases at train stations (cash register if no suitcase is available.)  I'll be happy to tag plastic for search and periodically give you piles as I do my legendary farming.
---
Actually, a loop around whitesprings, assuming you're dual purposing loot and legendaries, might be the best bang for your buck.  Between random container drops, coolant bottles and golf balls, you're likely to walk away from a whitesprings loop with a lot of plastic and possibly a really nice 2-shot shotgun, explosive or instigating shotgun.  
---
I just gave away a 2-shot combat shotgun the other day to someone that was willing to wave back to me, because I saw them carrying a shotgun.  If you're willing to share hits so both players get loot and xp, legendary farming is always more fun in a team.
---
Just to prove I'm not blowing smoke, here's a pic of the shotgun.  https://imgur.com/UExXVJV
---
Unsure from High School but fast travel to golf course South of the school, head North over some rocks and you will see a farm first on your left, past that you will see a blue two story house with a garage. cheers! 
---
 I just found that helm, never takin it off
---
Each type of power armor has its own Medic Pump mod, and it always goes in the chest. Keep checking the Harper's Ferry and Watoga vendors, you'll see one eventually. Or trade with a player for one.
---
I think you should only get a bounty after significantly damaging a camp, many times I have walked up to assist someone in pve only to get attacked by them after because a single stray bullet hit their wall
---
If you‚Äôre going to prove something then show a piece with higher damage resistance than a normal 200% piece, until then it makes no difference 
---
You know what fertilizer is, right?
---
Right, since you're the one that showed up to disagree with a reply disagreeing with OP with a rhetorical scenario since you don't even use a jetpack.....
---
You got problems, kid.
---
I'm on PS4. My bad encounters... 3 guys were following me around slapping me to death. I retrieved my junk, they continued and took my junk. I then killed them each 3 or 4 times and busted up one of their camps. Another time i was in my camp crafting and I hear booms, see someone is now wanted. My camp is being randomly attacked. I logout because annoying. It took me a couple of seconds. Literally everything in my camp was broken in less than 15 seconds. Literally every other encounter I've had has been good or neutral. This excludes doing PvP events and workshop stuff though.
---
Lay it on Us brother
---
There's a lot that needs to change first - like lifting the 25,000 cap limit and creating the ability to actually sell items to more than 6 vendor pools totaling 1,200 cap per day at a maximum.
---
XB1?
---
I remember someone saying the max for every stat is 45, but only under very specific circumstances
---
Are you the Todd_toddington on ps4 that completely griefed my camp just now?!? I was already having a shit day but this just made it worse. 
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know of anything really worth that much, especially once the upcoming patch nerfs tse weapons. The cap for transactions would be just fine at 15k imo, as I *would* pay that much for a plan for t51b jetpack, though really nothing else. Maybe a three star tse weapon that complements my play style with a really nice third attribute too. 
---
But it remains that I‚Äôm just shifting caps to alternate throw-away characters at this point to circumvent the cap limit because otherwise I get nothing for selling all the stuff I have. Essentially I have no cap limit at all, just added inconvenience for myself and whatever friend helps me transfer the caps. 
---
I guess I could just no longer pick up pretty much anything and toss the thousands of caps worth of stuff I have waiting to sell. Fallout without looting and scavenging is super boring, though. 
---
Protest signs would go well with the Commie Wacker, Sickle, etc.
---
In all honesty Morgantown would make more sense.
---
I only downvoted cause you exaggerated.
---
Just tried to add you
---
THIS üôåüôåüôå as a female player myself in my experience gaming people seem to EXTREMELY react one way or another. Hence why I try to refrain from using my mic in open lobbies/complete strangers, I dont want and especially dont need the same replies everytime I speak out, "OHHHHH YOU'RE A GIRL"
---
A: inbox gets spammed with "overly friendly" messages
---
B: next grief victim
---
Not to completely change the subject, but fun fact a lot of females like to play video games too and we just want to sit back and relax and have fun just like everyone else who games.
---
Lastly I know you stated in this thread that you have some anxiety and you dont always want to game with others, which is totally cool, but if you're on console and want a gal pal to roam the wasteland dont be afraid to hit me up! 
---
Just the one it‚Äôs for. At least visual in the pip boy that‚Äôs the way it it. And it‚Äôs only temporarily suppressed 
---
understood sir, i will only use them to lure out the source of the scorched and make appalachia a better place where people don't have to leave their houses fearing that a scorch beast will appear out of nowhere and attack them and lose all their junk
---
Ok. I have a commie whacker now. I will grab a sickle and a protest sign
---
I saw friend added
---
it says you are offline
---
Thanks for clarifying, I was unaware 
---
Sweet. Thanks for the info. I just started a new character and an sorely missing that thing.
---
Need a food/drink tab separate from aid, a crafting tab for ore, raw flux, gunpowder, and masses/fluids, or the ability to customize tabs and their contents. 
---
I certainly wouldn't put it past the Enclave.  I think of the BoS as misguided and slightly pitiful in their shortsightedness trying to achieve a noble goal, but the Enclave is like Littlefinger from Game of Thrones.  Smart enough to be aware of long-term damage from their actions, but too greedy to care.
---
wait a raider is in the Enclave? well i hope you start using them responsibly
---
What ever it is, it definitely got worse after the latest update.
---
I have targeting helmet :( 
---
Okay, saw it added. Coming to your world. Pls no jebait
---
Littlehorn and Associates were all vault 76 dwellers
---
Platform? I had my favorite CAMP just south of you on a junk node and a cliff. 
---
TYVM!
---
I actually dont mind when people do this, makes me feel like the pettiest super hero ever when I follow them back to their camp and level it with mini nukes.
---
Of course, no problem. If you need any other help let me know. I'm on xbone by the way. 
---
No, the "value" is what you'd pay the vendor to buy it, not what they'll pay you for it.
---
If anyone wants to add me my username is MsSleepyCat. I already sent some requests out! Thanks y'all!
---
what does '"Lay it on us" mean?
---
I have some plans if you want them.
---
I went to shoot a radstag with a tse gauss rifle, missed and hit a nearby workshop. The one reason why I hate whitesprings, too many bases to hit by accident.
---
Kind of related. I just logged in to play on XB1 and noticed my T60 torso with a jet pack is missing when I entered my power armor.  I have no idea how it disappeared. So frustrating. 
---
While I completely understand your point, I also see theirs too. For triple A $60+ game to release in the way it did was absolutely disgusting and really just showed what they depths they would go to just to capitalize on the holidays. The game was/is absolutely broken. I too put it down and am just waiting. So I see the OPs point and yours as that is what I do as well however, it is wrong to discount those (within reason) who are feeling completely ripped off by this game. Afterall it was marketed as a full release and not an early access title (where it belongs)
---
&gt;Each raider has their own reasons for doing things. I've got a  contracting background, so my camp is built like a legit home, and when i  see fortnite bullshit houses supported on a stick then i get an  overwhelming urge to go Brahmin tipping. 
---
I don't support your actions, but I absolutely love your reasoning. üòÇ
---
I can't really begrudge people for playing the game they want to play it, but the min-max'ers kind of ruin it for everyone else.  When a Scorchbeast Queen dies before you can even fast travel there.  When you have three back-to-back nukes.  When you have stupid looking floating houses rooted to the ground by a flimsy staircase.  When everyone and their uncle 50 levels below you is rocking a TSE weapon and killing things before you can even swing your sledgehammer.  I wouldn't find that particularly fun.  The scavenging, having to make do with what you've got, that's what I find most interesting.
---
These rage posts getting so many upvotes is ridiculous. How hard is it to not throw a grenade when you want to power attack? Just press the button if you want to power attack. Don't hold it down. Only hold it if you want to throw a grenade. Even if you accidentally activate the command to throw it, either move away from it which should be easy since you're throwing it away from you and it doesn't detonate immediately, or hit your pipboy while it's still held and it will cancel. You won't still be throwing it when you exit pipboy. And its fast too, hit pipboy then back out right away. I'm honestly not seeing this as a problem that deserves any real attention. 
---
I get it, you accidentally threw a grenade once and you got pissed at your bad move. That's fine, it happens sometimes. But unfortunately you felt the need to post it here and more unfortunately it got attention. Good on /u/LoneVaultWanderer for commenting just to shut these rage posts up, but shame on Bethesda if they decide to do something just to please lazy people like go back to the fucking awful method they used before where to use grenades they had to be equipped like a weapon. 
---
I probably scrapped 250-300 getting no mods before I finally got the suppressor.  I feel your pain and RNG was definitely not my friend on getting that one.
---
15 Base
---
15 Unyielding armor x5
---
6 Alcohol (With Party Boy/Girl Perk)
---
5 Radicool Perk
---
3 Solar Powered Perk
---
3 Underarmor (Enclave shielded)
---
3 Food Buff (Deathclaw Wellington)
---
3 Psychobuff
---
Total: 53 
---
Might be missing a few. If you're looking for more damage I'd recommend a different food and chem, giving you 40% melee damage bonus
---
The Atom Shop cosmetic stuff, Atoms are the currency.
---
Are you sure you're not getting it? I thought the same but when I restarted I had the item rewards in my invent. Not sure about the xp, but I never got the text pop up for Black Diamond, and I use it nearly every day lol
---
That's alright. Just pay it forward with mercy killing someone else who accidentally gets a bounty lol
---
for a game I paid in  full pre-ordered and played beta, I'm ok with that. to have the new stuff you gotta pay even if it gets discounted or full f2p within a year,I won't care.eventually they will take advantage with loot boxes to earn.
---
Distant Thunder - quick event to complete, chance to drop useful plans. 
---
Census Violence - another five minute event (though I feel some times that the robot talks longer than the event takes to complete) that has a good chance to drop decent plans
---
Uranium Fever if I need steel, aluminum, etc; about eight minutes from start to finish, generally, and good experience/scrap, plus chance at legendaries in the level 40 range.
---
Grafton Day if I'm in the area - quick and worth 60 caps on average, I think. Also fun to let low level players get a few hits in, then I can drop the monster. One of the easiest events to farm, it spawns absurdly often.
---
Manhunt - similar to Grafton Day, worth it if I'm in the area. Quick and easy to clear. 
---
Breach and Clear - easiest source of large quantities of lead, fast to do and leaves you with plenty for ammo
---
Heart of the Swamp if I'm in the area, it's decently quick to complete and a break from what I'm doing. Drops can be good depending on wave composition, scorched drop decent ammo for me (shotgunner) but mirelurks are terrible. 
---
I only did Patrol Duty while hunting weapon plans, would never advise it otherwise. 
---
I'm sorry your take someone disagreeing with you so personally. D=
---
I actually just snagged some plans off him lol yeah me too but I took a break so I'm only lvl 122. That's like my second time seeing him
---
My issue is with the fact you can destroy an entire base and log off without punishment.
---
I really wish they would incentivize attacking and defending camps. 
---
If you give players a risk vs reward reason to attack camps it will come off less as "senseless"
---
And giving players incentive to defend their base would help as well.
---
I'd really like to see it like a workshop style event / wager.
---
When a player engages another players base they get a workshop style prompt :
---
"Attacking this players base will cost x amount of caps, and engage you in PVP with the owner"
---
The owner would then get a prompt "Your camp is under attack"  and if they go kill that guy they'd get the caps the aggressor paid plus the bounty. 
---
This would work best if you also allowed player to repair camps with caps or a combo of caps and junk.  
---
The aggressor would also kind of need a reward maybe junk/mats for destroying parts of a base (Which they'd drop if the defender kills them), which would also push griefers to attack higher level camps as they'd have items with less common junk and such. 
---
Yes, it happened ever im fo4 but here is much more often. I dont know then why i got negative o  my post.. Reddit start begin untrustable by people just put right or wrong without think.. I will report it.
---
I'm fine with people RPing as Raiders. Frankly, this might be the first game where it makes sense. And yeah, that includes attacking other players and destroying their stuff. Just don't get pissed off at me for RPing the ~~genocidal fascists~~ defenders of Capitalism and last bastion of humanity. It's all part of the game. 
---
None of that actually happened, though.
---
Your little choo-choo is really far out in the grass.
---
I‚Äôve found that the ingame community is pretty pleasant. A lot are kind a courteous, several are indifferent, and very few are malicious.  
---
The community outside of the game leaves a lot to be desired.
---
get back here trator!
---
sounds good, take care!
---
I have met players like that. Thanks for doing what you do! I'm on PS4 though
---
This sounds awesome. The last time I met Grahmn he murdered a bunch of charred ghouls while I shopped from him. Not sure I got hit even once. If that isn't fantastic customer service I don't know what is.
---
That's a pretty fair and smart way to do it if you're not in a super tight build spot like a cave or trench.
---
Also they don't work in recipes. Only the ones with rads work in recipes. Which sucks.
---
It isn't PVP destroying someones camp and having a friend remove your bounty. 
---
I just drop them near where I found them, hoping that someone might come by and find one useful.
---
I'd say that 95% of the Legendaries I come across are not useful.
---
I never got the big deal with it getting destroyed since its never costed that much to repair anyway but this is a way of looking at it that I never thought of and find it amazing that it never came as a thought.
---
I'd like to be able to take the diamonds from one thing and put it on another...
---
I dump my extra plans at the Overseer's camp.
---
I'm at about 80 hours, still no Grahm or Mothman sightings.
---
 I dunno. You get used to it. ;)
---
Sounds good
---
On the contrary, the Enclave are *only* thinking of the long term. They are the epitome of "The Ends Justify the Means". Their entire plan is to achieve world peace. The only problem is they plan to do that by killing everyone but themselves. Eckhart is an outlier, in that he just wanted personal power and didn't give a flying f\*\*\* about the consequences. The Enclave, in general, would not be so shortsighted as to release the Scorch Beasts without a plan to control them. 
---
LA Boneyard = LA burgeryard
---
But there is a reason, its binary because its robot challenges. Thats the reason.
---
Brujh
---
Depends on your damage. Under 800 I do not dmg. Above 1000 i kill myself. 
---
No they're playing as tools. Raiders would fight back. These guys destroy a base and log off or have their friends remove their bounty. That isn't being a raider.
---
I drop stuff in the suitcase at the Charleston Station all the time. Usually it's duplicate plans/recipes, ammo I don't need, or weapons that have outlived their usefulness to me. 
---
Is this a PC issue? I ask because I rarely ever have such trouble on the PS4.
---
Playstation. Though my cousin just started having this issue on xb1 
---
Drifter Outfit 
---
Yes. Grounded and Healing Factor both do not get reduced at the moment. Maybe others as well. I had to take off Healing Factor due to this.  I will  have to take off Grounded if they ever buff energy weapons.
---
With all the non-buyer's issues, like "no npc's" and same engine shit, and the buyer's issues, like duping, nylon bags and terrible performence this community was shaken up a bit. 
---
Common misconception, they're actually made from nylon. 
---
It was burried
---
What items do you need?
---
Not too many enemies drop handmade rifles.  Always pick them up for mods.
---
There's a static spot where you can always pick one up at Berkeley Springs in the Mire.  In the far north part of town, up on the roof of the hair salon building, a handmade rifle is sitting on a metal shelf in the wooden shack.  When you go up the stairs to the roof and walk into the shack doorway, it's just on your left.  There's always two scorched up there, one in front of or inside the shack from the stair access, and one creeping around behind.
---
I always go for the knees when sniping something I can't kill with one shot.  Especially fast movers.  There is no shame in that.
---
If you recall FO:NV had a syringer that was most useful for shooting Deathclaws in the knees to hobble them, otherwise they were nearly impossible to kill until you got pretty high level.
---
The scorch should eventually loose interest unless you died right under his spawn....either way good luck.
---
Ps4. But my cousin has the same issue on xbox1. And he has his base near the water park but not near any npc spawns
---
I only have a furious combat knife. I tossed a serrated edge on it. It fits my guy. Big nose creepy mask, straight jacket over chameleon armor. 
---
Knife, machete, chainsaw, golf club, axe. 
---
And word on if we‚Äôre going to get a hockey mask? 
---
Asking for a friend. 
---
If you‚Äôre still trying to get your stuff back, send me an invite, GT is same as username.
---
No, it's 38% working. LoL
---
Medic shotgun damn near instantly heals 40% hp.
---
So I should be ok in a few weeks
---
Going to say something is underground or trapped in a wall.   I have had this happen many times at this workshop.    This thing was supposed to have been patched and while I have not run into an issue at this spot recently it seems you have.
---
The only time I destroy a camp is when it‚Äôs set up to kills ghouls and/or glowing ones at the golf course. I wish Bethesda would address this issue. 
---
They get explody if they can't shoot at you.  So do Assaultrons and Mr. Handy's.  Basically, if you shoot their limbs off, they'll bumrush you and explode.
---
my bad its like ‚Äúheads up‚Äù
---
Please add lock on favorites first before you add the function allowing to scrap legendaries.
---
How are you a able to build that much? I barely get my foundation and two floors before I am out of space...
---
I sent an invite to game 
---
I have to get the Mothman one!
---
I still have enough budget for a small turret, or so the bar looks. Maybe level does matter when it comes to that? I've always thought it didn't but I'm not sure. I have no turrets whatsoever if that means anything
---
&gt;her meat pile should be huge!
---
That's what she said
---
Is everything on screen yours?
---
Yeah, why? It's not my fault this games death mechanics are wack. 
---
I find it ironic that your post about a lack of content leading to not being able to tell our own stories....
---
Is just a title with no body. 
---
I find however, that 76 is ideal for telling our own stories. Ive got multiple chars, with roleplaying backgrounds. 
---
Their own motivations, quirks, flaws etc. 
---
A water farmer with an on going fued with a nearby deathclaw. She's also a drug addict now, which is eating into her water farming business. 
---
A naive wasteland tourist who is driven by sightseeing and picture taking even if that brings her into various dangerous places. 
---
My most recent is an elderly lady. She's crazy. She thinks she's a soldier from old world war 2 movies. She also thinks super mutants are Nazis, and will go I to a blood rage on sight. She's a fun lady. 
---
Turn on Pacifist mode. 
---
And we love you ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
I read every page.  You sir/mam,  need to be hired by Bethesda.  That was great
---
For exactly 1 hour, to be precise.
---
Except for the telephone poles and bridge, yes. Street lights are mine too
---
Get dense on your chest piece too. Then you‚Äôll take a really small amount to 0 damage
---
According to other posts in this reddit it‚Äôs 22 hours. However since Ballistic Fiber is so critical to making armor the military bases get wiped out very quickly. I am not surprised you don‚Äôt get any even when server hopping.
---
That‚Äôs something a duper would say.
---
None of... None of what actually happened?
---
I feel like we're literally living in two different realities. You've been throwing quotes at me that I never said and saying you didn't say things you did.....
---
Agree. I could go an hour with medium usage and go through a core. Today I burned 3. 
---
He does have some really good plans. Still trying to get those power doors! I had another player build them in my house but it's something I want so I can build them for others I run into.
---
Yeah I'd rather not have scorchbeasts autisticly screech at my camp everyday, no thanks
---
Go for their legs than blast their stinger. 
---
I seriously don't get it.
---
No, I get it. You're bad at this.
---
I disagreed with OP, you disagreed with me, now you're upset that I'm upset that you don't have a jetpack.
---
Never change.
---
TSE will still be powerful, especially on a gun like the 50 cal. While +50% damage isn't +200%, it'll still wreck anything that isn't the Queen in seconds. 
---
Further down is a Shut Up and take my money Fry pop
---
It is a huge mystery, but in my personal experimentation; I think even open world loot is somewhat personal, and things usually come back after 30 hours.
---
I think this because I have looted places clean solo, but have gone back to the same place later in the day with my son playing in group with me. While there, I can loot nothing in the open world, but the place is full for him.
---
Example. On Saturday morning I cleaned out Morgan HS, then cam back with him in the afternoon and he was able to pick stuff but I could not even see what he was getting. We were also playing side by side in the same room.
---
And this was not the first time it has happened that way.
---
The one offering you the solution to cold fusion in exchange for its life.
---
lol true
---
At what level are we talking here? I'm curios because I'm 48 and pipes don't come close to my hunting rifle, maybe they have a different advantage?  eg hunting rifle vs combat rifle
---
If help is needed still I can help as well. 
---
Combat knife's not a bad weapon, though. 
---
Its good ao yoy can still kill and farm them
---
I have both still die if weapon is nutty dmg. Even with dodgy. 
---
Yeah, I like to 'feed the people'.
---
On a side note, why do corpse stamen sometimes show up in my inventory and what are they used for?
---
Lmao, so true.
---
They'd actually be worth more to me if I could scrap them, get materials, and possibly learn a new attachments.  Especially if there was some way to learn legendary mods, maybe only for the weapon type they were on and very expensive material-wise to apply, but eh...  Even without that, if they scrapped as regular weapons I'd be happy.
---
While they may not sell for much, the shared cap limits on vendors restrict how much I can sell anyway, and I can usually find enough extra meds (rad-x, rad-away, and diluted variants in particular) and excess materials (always have tons of steel) to hit all the factions up for the 200 they're allotted.
---
The shared cap and the slow reset (a change to either or both would be nice) are more frustrating to me than the value of pretty much anything I've been selling.  Just not that interested in seeking out players to trade once the vendors are out of caps.  If we get a nice player vending system, that could change, will have to see how that turns out.
---
Yes yes i have many to es just ran ariund wToga and kilked the bota for the legendaries
---
what has rose told you to do? tell me
---
Thats been my thought the entire time. If they wiped the weapons it would be the same as if there was never any dupes. When you see a TSE you should be freaked out by how uncommon it is, except now we all just think its normal to have. 
---
So weird to imagine a fo76 where I only see someone with one every few weeks, not every player. But Ill enjoy my duped shit I bought. /shrug
---
If you ever get tired of it you could always just switch to something else lol 
---
Yeah you can say that but still does not beat the fact that it is stupid for me to be punished for doing nothing. They should just not have it do damage to bases. 
---
PC bug 
---
Today a teammate and I were wandering the wasteland and we happened to go into the ransacked bunker and explore. On the way out my teammate became invisible to me but they could still see me. I tried multiple times to fix this glitch like fast traveling to my base to prompt a loading screen and other places. No luck. 
---
The war drum would be fun. Its like a funny super sledge. 
---
It is definitely a sub optimal melee weapon though. Plus if I find it is too effective I can just not use perks to buff it.
---
I just dumped close to 60 plans and recipes in the lunch box at the Watoga train station. HATED to give 'em up but, man, I was overburdened, my stash was full, and I had already learned all of 'em once, so ... there's, like, 80,000 caps worth of paper there for whomever finds it.
---
bruh
---
Mildy annoying but pacifists will fix that
---
Other folk that describe this problem say that it's fixed when they kill the program and reload. I know that's not ideal, but it is at least one fix.
---
If you're in a team, you can rejoin the same server
---
I‚Äôve had a few occasions on XB 1 where we will kill regular scorch beasts and get squat. Never a Queen though. 
---
Damn. 11 codes poof. 4-4-3. Not one damn complete set from a full day playing. 
---
Sadly F76 is all i got until something like Division 2 or Days Gone drops. So im in it at least another month lol
---
radical
---
Is that on login or randomly?
---
I wait 10 seconds upon login as its flakey at first
---
rose quests
---
Haven‚Äôt touched the game in a month for my Xbox one x. Turned it on about 3 mins ago‚Ä¶crashed upon loading into game. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a one off but c‚Äômon man. 
---
Thanks for the help with that and especially thanks for the stimpacks
---
I found the easiest way to get rid of extra plans is the Morgantown Airport quest where you gotta defeat 5 waves of scorch follower attacks... At the end by the drop site where the drone drops the chest place them in a bag next to the chest.  When I do this majority of the time the low level player doing the quest will also take the bag when they see what's in it.
---
Oh... Okay.
---
Also don't forget the tons of human skellies in the trash out back of whitespring
---
No turrets or water filters, or resource collectors.
---
Anything that has a "Brain" in it.
---
Cost a lot of space.
---
\_\_\_
---
Also your camp looks amazing OP. Nice place to come across when your fresh out of the vault.
---
I know its a month old but where at? I've gone there a bunch of times in search and have found 0 every time. 
---
No prob
---
If you on xbox send me a message I'll give you a serum for it
---
Did we just find Fallout‚Äôs version of Maiq the Liar?
---
I think we did.
---
 That is impressive.
---
It's mostly on login but I have had it happen on a fast travel or load screen
---
Thanks.
---
Ya reliving does fix it but sometime I wish I didn't have to
---
r/fo76bazaar and offer to buy it (price varies, but almost always less than 1k)
---
Option two is go hang out and collect rads until you get a mutation. Don‚Äôt want it?  Radaway then server hop and repeat. 
---
Option three is for dumbasses.  Buy one from Modus for 4k+. 
---
Already bought some of the original Fallout Pops when I was collecting.  I even bought the Nuka Cola PA pop from Wal-Mart.  I really like the PA pops...but damn I don't need more.
---
I think the jury is out.
---
I hopped camp mcinlock for close to an hour.
---
Multiple times clipboards spawned. Multiple times there were none.
---
It was unbelievably inefficient but i for sure got 2 full clears in an hour
---
You can mutate randomly just by taking radiation. If you don‚Äôt like what you get, just rad away or decontamination shower and it will go away.  Server jump and try again. 
---
If you just want one specific mutation, serums are your best bet. Most people sell them pretty cheap on here. 
---
Do you have starched genes perk?  You need that maxed out to keep your mutations. 
---
Yeah I will have to now, but I believe they should still change that. When you switch pacifist back and forth constantly, you forget what u are on. The last thing I think about is throwing pacifist to do a simple trade. 
---
You can eventually get the serum for it, or you can get it randomly from being exposed to radiation.
---
It's at the lower part of the big ridge, you can see it on the map. I call it the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, because I assume that's what it's meant to be. It has a good selection of headwear. I can post a screenshot of the map if you need it.
---
Hacker. Only a hacker can get these to spawn. Reported.

On a serious note. This is the only quest I haven‚Äôt finished.
---
I just purchased them tonight for 8700 caps. You can get them in the ski lodge next to Top of The World. 
---
What system are you playing on?
---
Xbox 
---
For your situational awareness
---
I Dont Even Have That Much Caps Right Now
---
Plan: Assorted Lights
---
Raider Vendors and Harper‚Äôs Ferry vendor bots have it.
---
Ideally, someone wanting to trade should be a good thing.  There are so many bugs and exploits in this game that it's just impossible to trust anyone.  It really ruins the immersion.
---
tfw you hardly play pyro but your most expensive item is a pyro hat...does that make me a half brother? 
---
I don‚Äôt think it really matters. I had 6 and they never killed squat. It seems your only attacked by the environment when you pop back in to the base. Greifers can easily beat them so what‚Äôs the point... unless your parked at Whitesprings to get hits on ghouls....
---
Fuckin gotem
---
Thank you!
---
hmm, i‚Äôve found some in the cabinets. if u can‚Äôt find any there you should check the silos. i‚Äôve found 4 in one run. at least 2. 
---
Lights take away of lot of resources too, I don't have too many in my buildings which helps. Most of my light sources are outside to brighten it up during the night. Thanks for the compliment!
---
Thanks Kanye
---
I used to main pyro and had around 200 hours then my friend came over, deleted my stats, and said play something besides pyro. I now main heavy and use spy for trading purposes.
---
The only things that don‚Äôt get destroyed are floors and stairs. Everything else is demolished. 
---
That is seriously nice, hopefully you do not get many random spawns on it.
---
Maxed level ones!!
---
Fallout themed restaurant in NYC = Gold mine. So many artistic minds who will take it to the extreme
---
thats cool; and you by all means should be able to do that and benefit, but having that be the only way is just bad game design
---
At Poseidon, you can take the Yard which is a workshop, you can repair the entire Nuclear Plant, which is the quest being disucssed, and IN ADDITION to these two things, there is a giant rectangular machine always there, waiting for power, that cranks out Fusion Cores. It's like the other resource generators at all workshops except that you dont make it, it is always there. You just need to hook power up to it. That power requirement is hefty, so you would need to make a fusion generator yourself to power it, UNLESS you fix the plant... then the plant allows you to simply hook a wire between a nearby powerbox and this Fusion Core maker. It's very cool!

Violet‚Äôs not an issue for me. Cobalt is hard to find. 
---
Mele just...doesn't work for shit for me. There's some "bethesda feature" where even with 95% vats hit chance, I can swing twenty times and not land once. 
---
Was Int 15 when I made it, but again, that was 30 levels ago.
---
Fought a pack of 5 bears about 20 levels ago in it.  It's needed no repairs.
---
I hadn't thought of this, is certainly something to think about...
---
Is not a question, i just lift the problem, snoop to know how many hv my same problem. I hv targeting helmet but it happen more often with excavator PA, and is not normal Bethesda dont fixing it. I still get in trap inside my PA and they should had fixed it last past patch. Frustrating.
---
You gotta go back in time and have your mother get impregnated by a marsupial.

Don‚Äôt know about now, but it used to be that pulse did extra damage to bots.

 Early game I took it multiple times and made a ton of Salsbury steak.  They are still my go to for hunger, saving Dog food for when I need food and healing.  I am still a good boi.  Whish you could make dog food there.  I would build a camp there and never leave.

That's the thing - it's needed NO maintenance.  Isn't that weird?

Ah I see you employ my method of fleeing!

Just run and jump off the nearest cliff and hope the feral ghouls jump too!

Huh - definitely not my experience

I mean to be fair to Bethesda...we did elect Trump, so this universe is actually slightly MORE believable than reality at this point.

That's a really cool one.

the reason the flatwoods monster is a zetan is because if you look inside it's helmet it has almost all the features of a zetan

 I had one of those under the junk pile I was mining.  It did no damage, but its sound was annoying and I was triggered so I could not fast travel.   Fortunately a server hop fixed it.

This could be abused, but I do hate going through the menu eveeytime I wanna turn on pvp
---
All around the north and north-east of whitespring, outside the stone wall, if whoever threw the nuke knows what they‚Äôre doing, in the form of blue tree bark and green berries. 
---
Also quite a bit around west-tec research and/or NIRA, if someone nuked that area. It‚Äôs getting more popular because the NIRA warehouse and office has a mass legendary spawning (mutant) mob like the whitespring golf course. 
---
VitoriaRain playing PS4. There were so many glitches tonight during a nuke that it finally just froze up and I had to quit. Get it together Bethesda! Please. I love the game but hate the long load times, and glitching. I also had a power plant claimed and it glitches out the whole couple of hours I was on. At one point I was getting attached by invisible ghouls and losing health. It was floating diamonds through the air with nothing to shoot at. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è please fix the damn game already 
---
Pop the disc in
---
Hit start
---
Play the game

I have a lot of screws if you're interested, don't mind trading them for caps or any stable fluxes you may have. I'm playing right now too, tag: Xavier5249

how could it be abused?
---
Yes they do still work
---
Oh wait you can still be killed by other players in pacifist can't you?
---
Those are real!? I thought they were a myth.
---
I can help you out! My gamer tag is the same as on here

Thank you. That‚Äôs where I normally get it. Still significantly less than crimson and yellowcake every time I go looking. I‚Äôll have to dig deeper.

You were going for the clipboards? So you were able to loot clipboards, server hop, and find more?
---
The building is in possession of a person, thus an extension of the player. The only caveat is the wanted player can take full damage, while the building owner is invincible until constenting into pvp. 
---
Though I have seen people cashing in friends bounty's and that needs to be addressed. Personally I wan't the pvp server so hiding behind pacifist can't happen, because the closest thing to griefing I've seen was just that, a group raids a homies camp, we pop in and they are all on pacifist mode, antagonising him. Pacifist is not protecting just the carebears its protecting the trolls who know how to abuse the system. 
---
Pvp is not trying to make someone sad, its about looking for a scrap, griefing is with the intent to make a player sad or grieve. I'm here for the long haul since there are few games that do what fo76 does.
---
Well as you say, it‚Äôs a generic term so who‚Äôs to say that a fallout watt isn‚Äôt like a 1000 regular watts?
---
Okay thanks. Maybe the RNG is just been on the hate train and I should pay more attention when going through the Silos. Thanks!
---
Bethesda gave the green light to use mods didn‚Äôt they?
---
It's funny, everyone who mis-posts barter shit in here is also low-balling to a fucking hilarious degree. What's with that shit?   
---
No one is going to \_GIVE YOU\_ those plans, and that's what you're asking for. 
---
No probs :) 
---
What ammo are you crafting that needs cobalt? 
---
 They really need to fix that BS.  I am sure it is a holdover to FO4 were the hand made and Lever action were DLC and not in the commonwealth.  Seems like lazy programming on Bethesda part.  It is stupid what a grind being able to use either weapon is.  Fix this shit Todd!
---
This and my pipboy screen has been translucent showing the arm thru the glass.
---
I actually made a suggestion in the suggestions thread similar to this. Custom tabs on the pip boy, and also subtotals of ‚Äústack‚Äù weights next to each item. Like my 50 stimpacks weight is 25 lbs in parenthesis or something. 
---
Yea power doors are cool I always check harpers ferry for em. Never seen them in use besides on YouTube though lol. 
---
  Looking for logic in the Fallout universe leads to insanity.
---
Alternatively hit up fallout76 market on the discord
---
Why?
---
Not ammo, still trying to build my first rad shower
---
It does extra damage and an additional bonus to Scorched enemies. 
---
It uses UC 308. 
---
Whitesprings. A 30% nerf on fucking insane amounts of XP is still insane amounts of XP. 
---
I found out yesterday that I could repair other people's turrets and did so. I took a few lead scrap out of their excavator and some water, but fixed everything that could be repaired while I was there. Rad rats were tearing the camp up. I was on my lvl 7 reroll so I didn't have anything to leave to say thank you. I was going to this location to build my camp, but someone beat me to it. 
---
It's north of Bolton Green, near Morgantown in the Forest. 
---
Maybe your internet speed is too low? I played for a while today and it was perfectly fine for me.
---
Ahhh. Ok. 
---
Yeah, I struggled around there to get my vault suit shielded lining earlier in my fallout 76 career :)
---
You haven't read much of this sub have you? 
---
1.PC
---
3. Worst experience so far. Two game breaking bugs in the same night.  
---
First when I quick traveled for Harper Ferry my screen is black upon arrival.  I can get in and out of my power armor and still interact with the world as usual but can‚Äôt see anything.  I tried to fix this by quick traveling to a near by location but still nothing on my screen.  Had to quit game and get back in to fix this issue.  
---
Spoiler alert!!!
---
Second bug are actually server bugs related to the power armor.  I was just roaming around and happened upon Site Bravo and went into the elevator and to my surprise I started the nuke quest.  I was on my way to launch my first nuke.  Super excited about it.  As I make my way to the room where you need to replace 15 mainframe to open a large door(I have been in my power armor this whole time) I need to use the Tinker Craft station to make the mainframes.  But that‚Äôs when I found out I could not get out of my power armor(checked the surrounding area and found a few mainframe I could use but still need to craft some).  A quick search online I read somewhere I can try to deplete my core and then I will be able to get out of my power armor.  I did that and was finally able to get out of my power armor and craft the mainframes.  After I done that I tried to get back in my power armor before I proceed further and that‚Äôs when my character just froze.  She just stood there and I could not doing anything except open the map.  I tried to smash some button hoping it fix the issue before the robots came and kill me.  And that‚Äôs just what happens next, two of the bots came and killed me.  As they got close to me they begin using melee attacks and was able to knock me back further from where I was standing when I tried to enter my power armor....then I learned if you die during this quest you get to start over outside the bunker.  YAY.  Great time spent doing #%$&amp; for nothing.  
---
I thought that quest was a big for the longest time!!!
---
Did u get it from pheonix inside the city or the one in the train station?
---
Got it the other night, level 31.
---
Really surprised me as I normally get a mutation with high rads or standing in water but in this case I was running up a dried river bed with probably a half a centimetre of rad effects.
---
Its orsum, Ive been jumping up cliffs, on buildings and the whole time I torment my mate who wants it, cant get it and has to run the long way to get where I can now go.
---
Only issue...when you want a small jump, up a step, over a rock you cant...often hitting the roof inside buildings.
---
It's littered with bugs and no end game. It's still fun though. 
---
White springs has plenty of golf balls golf clubs. Also ski lodges have poles and skis. All count. But there‚Äôs plenty of golf balls on certain areas of white springs 
---
Thanks this one worked üëå 
---
This is the first time I've experienced this ever, It may be my internet speed. We have been being a bit slow today, I'll hold out for tomorrow, Dissapointed I can't do a WepMod Grind like I planned
---
Umm If Im Willing To Pay Caps Then It Isnt ‚ÄúGiven‚Äù Genius ! Im Not Asking For It To Be Given Im Simply Saying Why Follow A Game Vendor ! 
---
If I Had Extra Id Sell It For 1000-3500 caps Max Because Im Not Broke
---
Frankly it's fucking stupid that people are allowed to build in that zone at all. 
---
Dang I missed it 
---
Cool, I added you 
---
The best part of the vid is the circlejerking comments that always come up in todays market. I get companies screw up (and maybe pretty bad), but at some point we have to realize that people are still going to buy it (I got fo76 on release day and still love it). My main issue here is not the companies profiting but rather the content creators who just spew shit in hopes of internet points and subscribers. I'm not saying one cant have an opinion, just provide actual constructive points instead of "This is an affront to gamers everywhere! EA bad! Bethesda bad!"
---
You can upgrade the Mistress gear to level them up, you can't actually modify them so they won't show up in the menu. 
---
Ah right, that does seem obvious now.
---
I did that a while back, just building and scrapping a low level site until I got the achievement haha! Best of luck tomorrow. If you‚Äôre needing to grind the kill and revive achievement let me know, because I need those as well.
---
Was it used? Definitely odd you got it that cheap new. 
---
Bottom line... The game was released too early, and it's a new platform for Bethesda so yeah it's got a lot of bugs and exploits they didn't foresee.  
---
They are still working on it and regularly releasing patches and updates, but it should probably still be in beta, or should have been released how it is now.  
---
It's much better now than it was at launch, and there's a huge community that love the game.  Visit r/fo76 
---
I got mine at Costco at Christmas for $30
---
Sounds glitched. Had a buddy say someone dropped on Prime and Scorched Earth didn‚Äôt trigger.  It‚Äôs all kinda buggy down there anyway. Dropped frames, lag, unkillable SBQ. There‚Äôs plenty of intermittent issues that need addressed. 
---
Whitespring. Get your xp and items while you farm plastic.  Golf balls, golf clubs, plastic plates, toys, pool cues, pool balls, cola cups with kids or stacked. So much plastic. Over a hundred if you do a full circuit. Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
The buggy rocky start, I'd guess- elder scolls online is free to play (&amp; rated pretty ggod) &amp; charge for DLCs or their ESO Plus membership upgrade. I'd think, if they haven't yet, they may consider a Atom Shop membership with perks &amp; discounts... Especially sine DLCs are supposed to be free.
---
It ends the event for me every time. It's as though a single swipe from a ghoul takes the robot down to one health. I've never seen it do anything different.
---
I've had a lot of great encounters, trades of plans and such. Mostly ships in the night, maybe a wave.   
---
But there are \_so many\_ griefers I honestly don't understand the people who don't have at least a few "And then some guy three times my level decided to murder me, while I was in pacifist mode, and destroy all my shit, before i could even log out". 
---
Queen doesn't always appear.
---
It's happened to me a few times.
---
Barbells in gyms. (lead scrap)
---
But you can crouch walk, and pick a bottle cap off the ground...
---
Pulse is supposed to DOT robots but it isn't really listed.
---
You can try it - toss one at a Watoga bot and see if it ticks down.
---
I'd love this. Been waiting for them to implement it somehow. The only problem is joining a server and half the town missing because someone else is in the spot. I've been trying to think of a work around somehow, maybe like, a whole separate thing other than your camp where you'd have to rent plots of ground and then your building would/could be placed. Still seems very difficult to implement something like this. 
---
Grenade it. You can move them. 
---
Yeah. Very frustrating! Let‚Äôs make a drab colored world with lots of blacks, grays and brown. ‚ÄúI know! Let‚Äôs make the player‚Äôs dropped loot a brown paper bag!‚Äù Come on. Think a little.
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing this.  To avoid it I don‚Äôt bring up the Pip-Boy until my camp loads in.  Haven‚Äôt had an issue since I started waiting.
---
Do you have to server jump to get the 2nd mutation, 3rd, etc?  I was trying yesterday and after the 1st one (which I didn't want) I never could get another one.  Not server jumping, if that's needed, would explain my frustration....
---
 Honestly just build the character you want to be and play it that style.  Keep perk swapping to a minimum.  Use no legendary weapons and armor, just standard.  
---
I keep toying with getting that game. Like every few months I have my finger on the trigger but I just stall out. I almost got it last week but ended up with Pillars of Eternity 2. Maybe next time...
---
I‚Äôve heard that it is. Supposedly you can only get one every so often and server hopping resets it or something like that.  I just buy them off of other players who have the recipes until I can get my own set of them. 
---
yep, it only affects your ability to deal damage
---
Today recorded a pack of about 15 bloated glowing ones chase me. Scariest shit ever. They never seemed to stop spawning too and to top it off a scorchbest came in to fuck my day even more. Im only level 33. I got it all on recorded and even got a marsupial mutation though so im happy about that.
---
 Yep, once very early in my game
---
I like the plots idea! Maybe there could be a pre-built town with open plots for people to rent, and the towns could be a named location, making it so no one builds in it
---
Quite a lot of it. For every "I've never had an issue" there's a "I'm so sick of the toxic griefer asshats" it's seriously like some of you lucky bastards are on a completely different set of servers and I'm stuck on one with all the shitty fucking "killing people 1/3'd my level makes me feel powerful" psychopaths. 
---
Do you happen to have the targeting HUD on your power armor? If so try playing without it for a bit.
---
I just ran through the motel area killing all ghouls and every so often killing one would trigger an update.  I never actually saw, or as far as I know, actually killed one called "unruly golfer".  It didn't take more than 15? minutes to get them all.
---
I know, there is just no way to talk about this without a smirk
---
I'm late to the party. Same issue today. Fix for me was to kill and restart the Bethesda launcher - it picked up patching at 94% and ran to the finish.
---
(I know, I know - it doesn't help your case from 2 months ago, not the least because you rebooted, but I thought I'd add the info in case future people hit this code.) 
---
Oh okay, thanks.
---

---
No one should comment on youtube videos, let alone comment on comments on youtube and act surprised they are garbage. 
---
That was hard to write. But thanks for the comment.
---
Same here. I am on the X. If this happens I hold down Left or Up on the Dpad and it will pull me out of it to switch weapons. Safer than start/select imo.
---
I read this in protectron voice
---
The endgame is trash.Farming the queen is boring and The queens loot still glithes out.So no.
---
I sold 3 medic vats shotguns to a vendor a few hours ago for like 20 caps a piece. I‚Äôm on PS4 though so it wouldn‚Äôt have been of use to you.
---
Go on Nukacrypt.com
---
I‚Äôm still playing. But I would wait until February or March.  
---
Stranger heart from heart of the swamp event in the mire

That's something a duper would say.

You fantastic person, annoyingly I'm in Charlie xD, still though have an upvote you upstanding patriot!

Alpha 52732787
---
It would be horribly OP if it was a apparel instead of a armor 
---
The mic symbol already exists on PS4. Bottom corner of their avatar is either a red symbol denoting the lack of a mic, or a speaker showing they have one and can chat with you. 
---
Hang on I gotta go move my camp to whitesprings. What's the spot everyone hates where you can hit ghouls on the 2nd floor with your turrets? 
---
I saw in a youtube video a guy say it took him 13 hours to get the ones he wanted.  I thought I'd try to get a couple one time then try again later, but the first one I get is always something I don't want :(
---
Do buffs scale?
---
It still isn't versing the other player though unless they  fight back. Right now it is pointless. There is no fight. 
---
 I agree
---
Yeah I beat it solo at level 43. I took 15 diluted stimpaks and whacked everything with a super sledge. Didn‚Äôt have either of the level 3 hacker/lockpick perks.
---
Has anyone tried clearing their cache and what not, or is that what a hard reset is?
---
But you can add them all as friend and maybe join one?
---
This game has one of the best communities unlike some others
---
I got BOS limbs from scrapping, it may just be insanely rare
---
Lots of guns have quad.. have found a Tesla. Harpoon, combat shotgun and pipe bolt action with the Quad modifier so far.
---
Just buy the serums off of someone who can make them. It‚Äôs the easiest way to guarantee you get what you want, and only what you want. 
---
Freaking level 1 molerats take out turrets, so I find your story believable. 
---
It does DOT to all enemies now.
---
Also, my bad for not making a relevant point, but Bethesda most likely wont release sales numbers or actual player counts unless its leaked from a shareholders meeting. It would only hurt them, so I wouldnt expect anything
---
Yes it does which makes Watoga awesome!!
---
They dont attack you but if you get bored you can kill them. Smack an eye bit in the face to one hit kill him and get some free XP. Ignore the robots until you see a legandary version then shoot him to get the loot.
---
There is a spot inside the foundation that ghouls love. Nothing can be done except abandon event, come back in an hour or so to see if it works now
---
That‚Äôs odd, played 4 hours today on PS4, didn‚Äôt disconnect once. 
---
I so much want a quad dragon or black powder rifle even.  
---

---
Embarrassing?  Hardly.  Both of the power plants are absolute mazes.  Half the struggle of the Powering Up quests is simply figuring out where to go.  I can't imagine how anyone did actual work in them. üòÇ
---
So, you‚Äôre role playing as an NPC?  Interesting. 
---
Really? That's funny. Pretty sure that effect is supposed to only be robots.
---
If they're not worth anything they shouldn't weigh anything...
---
Wait seriously? You mean you finished the overseers  journey?
---
Somehow i got a 3 star tse. Gave it to a friend cause im melee.
---
Luck of the draw.
---
 Damn you making a lot of purified water.
---
Buff all ranged weapons!
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
---
In the current state of the game most to all ranged weapons are very lack luster, boring, and ineffective at best. They‚Äôre all too similar to each other in gameplay with only minor differences such as ammo type and visual appearance. This is in large part why so many hunt down, dupelicate, and use legendary weapons. Legendary effects are not just game changing but they‚Äôre practically needed in order to run most ranged weapons effectiently! Energy weapons sadly have it the worst at the moment, especially laser and plasma weapons which don‚Äôt even have enough punch to bypass the enemies damage resistance reliably even with anti-armor perks. If it takes a combat rifle (roughly 100-120 damage per shot) to take down a target with one magazine at close range then how the heck is a laser rifle supposed to compete when it only does 72 damage per shot!? 
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
---
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO MELEE AND LEGENDARY EFFECTS TO KILL 90% OF OUR ENEMIES IN THE ENDGAME! 
---
Energy weapons 
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
---
Oh how the mighty have fallen, pretty much the only good energy weapons are Gatling plasmas, gatling lasers, and gauss rifles. If you want to use anything else then you‚Äôre practically gimping yourself because of how weak and underwhelming they are. (And this is coming from the guy who‚Äôs played this game for 180 hours using only laser rifles)
---
Ultracite- these laser guns across all configurations do as much damage as pipeguns rounding out to about 52-60 damage per shot with max damage boosts (Excluding adrenaline.) Mind you this is without the damage reduction based on a targets resistances which makes the damage even worse, it should not take three magazines from an END GAME LASER SNIPER to drop one target out of a horde of 10! To make it worse according to the guide Ultracite is supposed to be the endgame variant of the classic laser weapons we‚Äôve come to love, and yet it does significantly less damage than the vanilla laser guns, has strict crafting components, and is extremely rare (have fun unlocking the mods!) A huge buff is needed to make this even remotely viable. 
---
Plasma- Plasma is also severely underpowered which is a shame because it‚Äôs supposed to be the end game energy weapon on its own. The enclave variant doesn‚Äôt fair that much better with only a minor stat boost that doesn‚Äôt amount to much. You‚Äôd think that having two damage types active at once would be a good thing, but as it turns out splitting what would be a 80 damage shot (which is already very low) into two halves just means that 80% of that shots lethality is abdosrbed by your targets damage resistances. Nothing says space age like seeing a plasma rifle unable to kill a damn rat quickly or firing 60+ shots at a assultron to get it below half health! 
---
In conclusion: If anything buff Ultracite laser guns and enclave plasma so they are 100% viable in the endgame, maybe even give them some unique stats so that they‚Äôre a bit more sought after instead of looked over. Energy weapon builds are almost nonexistent because of how bad the weapons affiliated with them are, buffing these two gun types could potentially fix that. 
---
Stat problems
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
---
Stat wise many guns have the same range, accuracy rating, weight, and damage. Fallout is an RPG at heart, it might not be there with the story but that doesn‚Äôt mean the gameplay has to suffer. We should be able to use guns to our own descretion and said guns should have their own unique quirks to make them feel SPECIAL in the hands of those who use them! 
---
Damage Falloff
---
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
---
You rarely see traditional sniper builds in action, the reason for this is because the range of all guns seems to hover around 200-230 at max and because of this the falloff is quite extreme for sniper rifles. Due to the low damage of most guns also skirmishes happen at close range to maximize damage output, even if some have a more effective range the damage still doesn‚Äôt make up for it unless you have a sneak build. Weapons such as laser rifles should have A LOT more range than most other conventional firearms (you know cause it‚Äôs a weightless beam of light capabale of turning you to ash), hunting rifles should be able to drop targets from extreme ranges, plasma should have less range as the round is slow and weighted, etc etc. 
---
I love this game and I want to see it succeed, but right now the gameplay 76 offers is very restrictive.  75% of fan favorite play styles aren‚Äôt even viable in this game simply because of the before mentioned issue, this product is to survive then this needs to be tended to especially if the goal is to add in a PVP mode! 
---
I personally love women, but your point on Crimea is pretty solid. Since at least the 1800's it went from European to Slavic peasant russian farmer.
---
 Lame
---
No kidding. Someone in Sentinel+Assassins armor with a hazmat suit overtop could be a seriously troublesome troll in nuke zones.
---
I'd be happy if we had two CAMP - one that was our "house" and one that was whatever else we wanted it to be.  Maybe you keep it portable.  Maybe you build a little store.  Maybe you don't do anything with it.
---
I like my current CAMP, but sometimes when I find a new location, or a new idea strikes me, I wish I could execute it without having to tear down what I already built.
---
 Exactly.   
---
It‚Äôs not possible. 
---
I like this idea!
---
I'm firmly in the "until it serves a purpose" camp. I wouldn't be surprised if most of those "raiders" farmed glowing ones, got bored with their ill-gotten level, then decided to take their boredom out on players who are actually invested in their surroundings.
---
The stacks of cups are plastic...maybe they are wrapped?
---
Thanks for the info my friend. Oh well üòî 
---
What if they had a town with equal plots and if for some reason the plot you normally were in was taken it would just move you to another plot. Since they would all be equal size it should work out. 
---
Yes! Good idea!
---
 It would be cool and maybe that is something that could happen with future DLC, but it kind of goes against the beginning story.  Hopefully future DLC bring new areas with things like that and NPCs.  
---
I blame the tagging system for this. How exactly is it immersive for us to whip out our weakest guns and hold back until everyone has tagged the legendary monster? Many if not most of us are trying to create powerful characters and part of the fun in that is "expressing" our DPS. The tagging system flies in the face of this fun. Bethesda please change it so that everyone within a certain radius of the kill gets credit (XP and loot). Thanks.
---
A suggestion could be a similar mechanic used by EVE Online:
---
If you logout outside of your camp or base, there's a timer where your character is still standing there. If you try to logout after attacking an NPC the timer till your character disappears is even longer. And trying to logout after attacking a player is the longest timer yet.
---
If you coupled this with disabling fast travel for a short while after killing a player, you have a much greater risk associated with raiding other players
---
I'd say this is the right answer.
---
Free your mind of the drama, take the game for what it is, and form your own opinion.
---
Where in the park?
---
To prevent conflict between camps and settlements, just cordon off areas of the map where settlements can be built but camps can‚Äôt. The rest of the map would be the opposite.  Kinda like an overgrown workshop, but more public.  Settlements are unlikely to be built out in the forest anyway and a large place would need a nice clean flat area to build on. 
---
Well done
---
It would be nice to have player towns, and NPC towns
---
From what I understand duping is 3 person activities now; these people are griefing and the fact they laughed afterwards just proves they were trolling you. If they really were trying to catch dupers they wouldn't even be bothering griefing you in the first place or steal your loot if they saw non duped item stacks.
---
I asked because I never see anything but glowing reviews about how wonderful this game is, how great the other players are, how everyone needs to stop being so negative. There straight up is no middle ground in this sub. It's either the greatest game ever made or you're only complaining because those damn youtube reviewers got to you. 
---
Where in the train yard?
---
Take a workshop around his routes and he'll eventually show up
---
Loot boxes only help them if the game itself is popular. 
---
I have one. How much you looking to spend?
---
Are you playing on one computer 2 accounts, 2 separate game files?  (ex one on C drive, one on D?)  
---
Are you using any specific program ISBoxer or ?  
---
I love multi-boxing in other games, but wasn't sure how well it would work here with no follow.
---
Also was curious how Bethesda views it.  
---
Like a separate world space for towns? 
---
I‚Äôm sure the idea was to have super rare, OP weapons/armor that would almost never be encountered. 
---
The dupers ruined that. 
---
1.5k?
---
I'm pretty sure that, in lore, iguana on a stick is human meat.
---
Buffs do not scale with your level or gear level. A level 5 Unyielding piece of armor will provide the same strength as a level 50 piece. If you meant stacking, yes. You can only have one chem active and particular food buff. For example a food that adds just 3 strength and another that adds 2 strength and 2 endurance. You will only get 3 strength and 2 endurance as a buff because the same stat bonus won't stack. However, as your stats increase there are diminishing returns. Really high strength will give less bonus damage than earlier amounts. For example from 1-15 it gives 5 bonus damage, then after that each point may drop to 3-4. I don't have the exact numbers and mine are just examples. As someone else mentioned there may be a hard cap for certain SPECIALS and you won't receive any benefit. We need more testing for definitive answers.
---
No, you‚Äôre the first. 
---
2k?
---
Sure, but what isn't OP in this game.  And Like all ideas it could be added to and improved, so there could be buffers or downfalls etc.
---
2k? 
---
The crouch walk is a bit absurd when you think about it. Being able to pick up a single small item is kind of a gimme. Imagine the outrage if you suddenly couldn't pick up small items in PA. Come to think of it, the cowboy revolver would be almost impossible in PA. Same with the lever action.
---
We at bravo and just now looking for the code lol
---
if someone is attacking your base theres a 90% chance its because you are one of those obnoxious people who turret spams the golf course...
---
but if not, dang :(
---
Would you do 1.75k?
---
I will. 
---
Just wanted to confirm that this still works, I got stuck without them and the car was the ideal pickup spot since it had 2+ bushes.
---
This what I‚Äôm taking about! On PS4 too. I haven‚Äôt gotten crap the last 5x‚Äôs. The loot never loads and she‚Äôs gone 2mins later. üò°
---
Bethesda should just start implementing the 4 and 5 star legendary enemies to challenge late game players with late game weapons.
---
Yeah, no kidding. They had to explain to this guy three times (and probably again since), [why we don't use our nukes](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/03/trump-asks-why-us-cant-use-nukes-msnbcs-joe-scarborough-reports.html)... Y'know, since we *have* them.
---
&gt;And three times [Trump] asked about the use of nuclear weapons. Three times he asked at one point if we had them why can't we use them," Scarborough said on his "Morning Joe" program.

All this hubbub about money for building a wall -- when what we *need* are **vaults**!

That said, my alt is becoming a shotgunner, and I think I am going to do this. That said, at least in the case of Deathclaws, they CAN heal their legs from a downed state. I damn near shat myself, because I had been moving in to get a pic and the little bugger stood up.
---
Nah it was still sealed. Nothing but a game code  And I'm in fo76 lol, but that's good to know. I was an early adopter of eso so I know how it can become something much better, but with everything surrounding it, it gave the impression that maybe it was just a generally bad game you know? Which is why I ask I guess, if there's anything I should know going in
---
Kinda. Same server and everyone still has their camps.  Basically a spot on the map that‚Äôs marked as a settlement and have a small shack or something with a bot in it to start so it has something even on a freshly started server.  
---
This could easily be combined with player vending, allowing people to role play as caravanners by making the vending at each settlement have separate inventory meaning you‚Äôd need to check back in to restock/collect caps. 
---
Of course I still want a stock market like exchange for base resources, and it could be included in whatever is the largest settlement. Perhaps weightless ‚Äúnotes‚Äù from vendors for items to be sold that are considered unscrappable junk items.  This would balance their weightlessness by making them lootable on death and unable to be used until redeemed. 
---
It‚Äôs easy, I‚Äôll help you if you‚Äôre on PS4. I did it solos at level 43.

Skyrim doesn't have automatic bows and magic doesn't have a punch with a magically charged fist (though it should).

I jumped ship a month after launch, I just couldn't deal with it. I check back in on this sub to see if anything changed every now and then but all I see is a fire still burning.

I'm stuck on step one.. there's two major problems with this step
---
First, I don't have a CD reader
---
Second, I can't find the CD, just some long string of numbers and letters
---
It is for the melee attacks, but Skyrim doesn't have to deal with guns for bashing.
---
Boy you're really not... getting that are you.
---
What's the point of nukes if you are totally unwilling to use them.
---
He's absolutely correct, should someone attempt to destroy the USA then they should expect swift nuclear retaliation.
---
Such is the point. 
---
I was at 7 ....... then the quest disappeared......
---
Alright.
---
Did you try turning it off and turning it back on again? 
---
My issues tend to be rad-away. It's not effected by traveling pharmacy and weight alot.
---
I really like this idea! Towns could have trading hubs, making the suggestion for trading hubs come to fruition!
---
Every patch seems to cause a lot of problems for some people and not so many for others. I avoid playing whenever I get issues real bad.
---
Getting a pc capable of playing online games is not very expensive. In fact the ‚Äúmaster race‚Äù often uses the argument that pc gaming is actually cheaper in the long run as games can often be bought at significant discounts. That and pc can slowly upgrade parts as they fail or become outdated, unlike consoles.
---
So im not sure where your argument is coming from, you dont need to have a pc that can play games on super high ultra settings to play online games. 
---
We must have had very different experiences as well. I first played online PC games in the late 90‚Äôs, and started online console gaming with FF11 on PS2. Been hopping back and forth between pc and console depending on what games I want to play. With 20 years of online gaming I can assure you that I have noticed no difference in the level of stupidity and toxicity that exists on any platform when people know they can hide behind a digital name.
---
I regret paying full retail for it at launch and still think it's more of a 30-40 dollar game, but I've put a fair amount of time into it and find it pretty enjoyable. If you've played Subnautica and liked it, NMS is going to be on a similar vein. 
---
after reading the post and the comment section I can confirm graham is a fucking war machine
---
Dense armor and fireproof for some reason seem to eliminate MY explosion damage inflicted on myself completely. But others can still damage me.
---
Because the scale of everything is way out of wack. If that were the case then some items would be consuming ridiculous amounts of wattage, a water purifier doesn't take 10,000 watts to run. A spotlight doesn't consume 1000 watts. However a generator producing 3000 watts would be fairly reasonable. There is absolutely no parallel here to real life. Don't try to liken it to real energy consumption, it's a fictional thing let it be a fictional thing. 
---
I got platt and bounced, this was when the 3 trophies that were bugged got patched so it became achievable. I also enjoyed it at first but boy oh boy, the sour taste in my mouth right now. 
---
I get that part. Why'd he have to ask three times, though?
---
Mutially-Assured Destruction is not a new concept. How the hell do you make it all the way to the presidency without some inkling of "why, exactly, we don't use our nukes"?
---
Guardians of the Republic.
---
shhhhhh some of us get 99% of our caps selling outfits to vendors
---
Yea.. one of those effects should be enough.
---
Hell the perk cards we have don‚Äôt even come close to those effects and a full set of that armor makes power armor obsolete which is idiotic.
---
Took me a few times of pausing the video but I snapped a shot of this on a YouTube post of the developer room. [Heavy combat armor ](https://imgur.com/a/lqsm2p6) 
---
Hopefully they give us the ability to turn the constant reminders about the community events off. I hate that every time I hit the scan button I get asked to jet off to some portal when I just want to scan the system I'm in. This was the main reason I shelved it again. 
---
PC or console?
---
Haven‚Äôt played borderlands except maybe 20-30 hrs on 2. But I‚Äôve never been huge on shooters. If you‚Äôre talking about the randomized gun/legendary drops, that has been around long before borderlands was repping it. :) A randomized loot system isn‚Äôt anything special. 
---
Come to think of it, Fallout 76 doesn‚Äôt do anything special except its years of built up lore through the other fallout games.
---
I realize that this is six weeks removed from when you done this test but did you happen to test to see how long it took for a regular Mr handy buzz blade to kill the subject? I'm just curious to see how much damage can stack.
---
I agree solo is not that hard I did it for the first time ever  today alone and was a little disappointed thought it would be more difficult but have read it scale to the number of players. I'm a lvl92 rifleman with stealth using a tse lever 
---
I like this idea.
---
I will say, for better or worse, that duper‚Äôs either didn‚Äôt realize their full potential or didn‚Äôt have complete sets to mass dupe because they‚Äôre damn near impossible to source despite them all mysteriously having the same stats haha. Small batch dupe.

I have the targeting HUD mod on my x-01 helmet and I've been crashing like crazy on ps4 since the last update. I didn't realize it at the time, but after spending a good while moving and upgrading my camp with no crashes, your post reminded me I stayed out of my power armor that whole time. This has to be a bug.
---
Smart.

How borderlands did co-op is the likely inspiration to much F76 design. 
---
I'm usually playing either late when the wife and kids are sleeping (can't talk, it wakes them up) or in the morning before work (my wife is almost always up doing conference calls for work because she starts at 7 and I don't work till 9, so can't talk then either). I used to use a mic a lot before I had kids when I was able to play after work and at.. normal times of the day.
---
They racked up a bounty and roamed around until someone killed them,  they took advantage that you were busy. It would be nice if the game gave you the same" your being attacked" notification along with the players information while locking them into pvp enabled for a certain amount of time. Similar thing with people taking other junk, it should inform us who took the junk, maybe not flag us as pvping, but at least it gives us a chance to negotiate the return of our scrap,
---
This happened to me yesterday. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to play today but it kept disconnecting me and I don‚Äôt know why. 
---
Trophies could not be earned during the beta if i remember correctly.
---
It seems to be a problem for a sizeable amount of people after the last patch. It also seems to affect all systems equally (or at least very close).
---
I‚Äôm sure the reason full sets (of mismatched armor usually) came about was dupers trading duped pieces with each other to fill out their sets.
---
They‚Äôre selling them on eBay now evidently. 
---
Nope. Tried playing again a few times.  Nothing to explore.  Same events.  Disappointed. 
---
I feel ya. This game has been an apex bittersweet experience. Maybe the most bittersweet game of all time for me. 
---
I hadn't played for a few days and tried to play today. So many disconnects and then for a while it was cool. The game just isn't baked properly lol. Neither was fallout 4. I never had a solid experience playing that game either, lots of crashes. And there isn't much of a challenge in 76 as far as combat goes. Maybe the PvP servers will fix that. 
---
There is so much interesting stuff in the Fallout and Elder scrolls universes that I tend to look past the glaring problems. In fact, I probably prefer sitting around thinking about Fallout more than I enjoy playing it. The landscapes, architecture, creatures, weapon design, armor, lore, factions... There's a lot to mull over and appreciate. Reading terminal entries outloud is something I started doing more and more of and it's actually quite enjoyable I find.
---
But yeah, I've set it aside again. It's just wasting my time. Would love to see some crazier shit implemented that complements this massive world that's been created. Challenges that outclass end-game characters... The lack of interesting places to nuke is just baffling. 
---
And the end of this game is so mixed bag. The music and atmosphere of doing Scorched Earth is epic. But the battle is just silly... like a Disneyland ride silly. If the lag doesn't kill you then the monotony will. This game is confused.
---
Got it.  If you're in fo76 you should know all the major bugs and what to avoid.  The biggest concern with exploitable glitches is duplicating items, which has been destroying the in game economy, but they just fixed the biggest method of doing that (although there are supposedly other ways). 
---
I've had the game for a month or two (on PC) but i'm playing slowly, so i'm still lowish level (22). My biggest issues have been occasional disconnects from server,  and high level enemies spawning in places that my low level quests take me.  My understanding is this happens when a high level player was there recently and didn't kill everything that spawned for him. 
---
I'm enjoying it overall and happy with my purchase 
---
Me and 3 other friends play almost every night. I swear to god when we launch a nuke we spend 20 minutes in the first part trying to figure out how to update the biometric data. 
---
Shit, good call I'll try it and get back to you
---
Was talking about how power attacks should be tied to holding down the right trigger like it was on Skyrim for us console peasants.
---
The issue with that is that it's not a cosmetic item like regular outfits. I think it should give some damage resistance, not as much as power armor, but perhaps equal to a set of studded heavy leather. 
---
Two Shot Explosive, the most broken legendary combo in the game. Soon to be nerfed to mere"awesome" instead of "lul its dead."
---
Yes, I just sold a piece that has a chance to revive you with a Stimpack if you die.
---
PC, fariszk, I couldn‚Äôt see my teammate (completely invisible) but I could see their actions (ie if they killed someone ) however they could see me on their screen 
---
I like that workshop. It always has reliable glitch free defend events, unlike a lot of others that spawn the enemies in weird places where they get stuck.
---
My girlfriend and I are stuck at 7.  It's ridiculous the spawn rate. Sigh.
---
They aren't elusive. They are level capped and because of Whitesprings nobody goes their early levels.
---
Pop the code in.  
---
Wait to download. 
---
Play the game.  
---
its prime .308 and do same damage as .50 receiver
---
No dice (gotta love ssds)
---
Should.. should I sacrifice a deathclaw on a pentagram surrounded by my SSD and other general storage media I have lying around?
---
No. Ps4 here and have done it all. Rebuilt hdd, clean installs, had it on internal and external hdd. No change. Ive had occasional issues here and there but this weekend the games near unplayable. Im crashing upon loading into a world. Literally In the past 5 minutes ive had 2 crashes and 1 dc. 
---
One of the few things that bethesda is greedy enough to fix cause someone else is making money.
---
Out of curiosity, what platform? On PC, I'd had very little in the way of bad experiences. Maybe 10 squeaky mics since beta, and something like 5 people who were annoying/trolls/ect.
---
that's scorched receiver.
---
A couple fissures are in terrible places for a large scale battle. 
---
I like the idea of special nuke zone bosses though. Leave the queen where she is. Make a special boss appear with its own event in a few select areas, and create a generic random one that appears anywhere else one is dropped, based on whatever fauna is common for that area. 
---
Solid post, thanks!
---
This just happened to me. Fuck, fuck, fuck you Bethesda. 
---
Alright well just don't give yourself an aneurysm
---
It was. I had a kneecapper 10mm pistol that crippled limbs. All bowed to that pistol. It was seriously game breaking.
---
Done. Now I just need a consistent internet connection
---
Had the same thing happen to me! You have to logout to the main menu and log back in - that‚Äôs how we fixed that 
---
I've logged in to a freshly respawned area and there will be a couple of them alongside the high level charred ghouls. And it seems like after that initial spawn, they do not respawn. They dont seem to spawn at the golf club area for me at all but they spawn in the storage/repair area, the building with the flamer trap. Behind it
---
Wrong. The Scorched Killer receiver does extra damage to Scorched but less to everything else and still uses regular ammo. 
---
Prime receivers do extra damage to everything (as indicated by the increase Dam stat) as well as an additional bonus to all Scorched enemies, but this comes at the cost of using Ultracite ammo. 
---
I feel that if there were legendary power armor pieces available, 99% of people would live in their power armor. 
---
Legendaries are the only way standard armors are viable. In my opinion, power armor is too easy to maintain. 
---
It's not idiotic at all. The armor has legendary effects and power armor does not. End of story. Quit relying on power armor, it was never and will never be BiS top tier gear.
---
If only the enemy draw distance was good enough for long range, and it'd be nice if they fixed spawning so that when you snipe far enemies and go in for the loot the game doesn't break and spawn more. This has happened multiple times to me. 
---
It‚Äôs probably not intentional. Just one of the endless bullet points Beth needs to fix with their game.
---
I have a set and I didn't dupe, although ONE piece of my gear is Unyielding sentinel and the rest is assassin sentinel pieces. Mine are mostly robot pieces and I have a raider arm and marine leg lol
---
Find me tomorrow, gt: theonlycuregirl. Have a mic. Am nice. All that good stuff.

Salt is useful.  Go with spices.

Yeah I mean there's no way I've gotten 10,000 drops, I've gotten at least a dozen two shots, and half a dozen exploding weapons including one two shot exploding weapon in my time playing. If I 'had' to guess I'd say that I've MAYBE got 2,000 legendaries in my play through? I mean it's not beyond the RNG that I could be that lucky, but it doesn't seem to match the numbers unless I'm REALLY high up on the far end of the bell curve.   
---
I will say, I stopped farming White Spring back at level 75 or so, and have been mostly farming Wendigo Cave and West-Tec until now, and I'm level 176, so that might make a difference.
---
So if you have these codes do you not have to hunt down the key cards?
---
Getting a lot of CTD. And servers always seem unstable. Long load times, lag when looting or gong anything really. Id swear server latency is four digits sometimes.
---
Don‚Äôt lie, heavy mains don‚Äôt exist. 
---
Though with Hard Bargain, a 200 caps item will sell for roughly 40 caps.
---
Which 50 reciever, theres 4 if I remember correctly with very different damage values.
---
I feel you, I really do, but what is there to do once you complete the handful of quests and discover every location? Yes mechanically the game is fixed but it needs more content. More events, more quests, more weapons and more creatures. The nerf on TSE is a step in the right direction towards making nuke zones enjoyable again, but besides that what else is there?

You are a tad bit special ed aren‚Äôt ya?

Home wrecker is a perk in the game, besthedia wants people to do this, it‚Äôs not griefing
---
The problem I have with this line of reasoning is 3 fold. 1) like all survival games where "but I can play how I want" is the battle cry for griefing it rewards griefers who have the time to spend online 24/7 setting out to grief people  vs casuals who just want to play the game. ARK, Rust, DayZ, Minecraft just to name a few. Giving even more incentive means the griefers are the core focus of the game for a game advertised as Co OP PVE with opt in PVP, that's not what many people have paid money for.
---
2) lore wise it makes zero sense.  Vault 76 was, unless it was another shitty Vault Tec experiment, meant to rebuild after the war. That's what we were selected for and what the community was meant to be heading towards. Suddenly after 25 years together we are now 100% OK with coming into this depopulated devastated Wasteland and what..... killing our Vault mates? That doesn't scan. 
---
3)until they bring in PVE servers it'll unbalance in favor of people wanting to grief. Bad enough when everyone has the same opportunity but in FO where you can come across a person a million levels above you with a stacked Perk selection and armour designed to reduce damage from or increase damage to a player while you're just trying to survive? That's only fun for one person. And it'll force everyone to play as the griefers want to play.
---
What level are you? I‚Äôve heard you get a smidge more cap each time you level up, I‚Äôm around 80 with zero turrets so I can get the most out of building. You have double of what I have maybe more haha.

Makes sense. And I like this idea.  Maybe make it upgradable like liners, but to a DR of studded like you say. No legendary perks, just DR.
---
I've got 200 or so hours on PC and have only had a couple negative experiences. One with a guy stealing my workshop and killing me and one a couple days ago where some dude with a TSE started blowing up my camp before I logged off. Everything else other than that has been great! I always give a wave to anyone I run into out and about and they usually all wave back. Very wholesome.
---
The hardest Beth fanboys I know all agree the disconnects and crashes are a huge problem, the biggest, and needs to be resolved. I haven't spoken with a real life person who DOESN'T totally agree with this.

I want to upvote and agree but you had to word it with the 'ill get downvoted cos /r/fo76 downvotes all dissent' lie.

Mutated symbol to show if potential  teammate will benefit from stranger in numbers perk.
---
Either the symbols or let us use our character name, and some text to identify our intentions.  Last thing some of us want is trade requests/party/team invites every other nuke zone. The text has got to be regulated but would ease a lot of tension on potential threats. 
---
I live in my power armor. I don't want it to overshadow the legendary effects on regular armor. I just want something more interesting than a bunch of shitty mods that can be difficult to obtain and boring. Hell even if the legendary effects just did what the paint schemes used to do in fallout 4 I'd like it more lol.
---
Sometime soon I think. I thought there was supposed to be another before the month was over. 
---
Other than the guy that mini-nuked my CAMP pretty much same thing

Yeah, that annoys me too. Looking closer, I believe it's in New Vegas and 4 too but the difference is always +\- 20% or so, never as radical as 76.

Ok great I'll add you when I get online! My GT is SoundlessAxis7

Most embarrassing? Not by a long shot. Ill let you try this on for size... I was just finishing up a night of adventures and had put a nice scope on my rifle, job well done I thought. My immense satisfaction evolved into desire. I got really sweaty and I needed a release. Long story short, I booted up my laptop, pulled out my lotion, and yanked up a video on how to properly apply lotion to a chaffed area, my hands were really raw from playing with it all night, and I ended up forgetting my mic was plugged in and on. I return to the screen to see three noobs teabagging in front of my character and snickering on their mics. Embarrassing indeed.
---
Are you saying they, Bethesda, actually recovered your personel item? o.O
---
I just farmed for all 18 mutations and then used rad away and if I got rid of one I liked I‚Äôd just sit in rads until I mutated. Got lucky and after a couple tries managed to get rid of empath, herd mentality, and bird bones. With class freak max rank the negatives aren‚Äôt that bad anyway

Ok cool! I'll add you when I get online. My GT is SoundlessAxis7

Obligatory rise up

Had a guy named US-Smash (PC) just show up and TSE shotgun my base down. He latter launched a nuke on prime and then after he went to do another, I found his base and waited 5 minutes after he entered the silo to make sure he wouldn't be able to fast travel and leveled his 2 story metal base.
---
I can help you transfer those serums now. and no need to give me free Healing Factor serum since I won't be using it =p You can add me on discord too if that makes you feel more secure. My ign is the same as here.
---
The level doesn't really mean anything after 50.  A level 300 and a level 50 with the exact same items and perks will put out identical damage.

Alpha and Charlie were solved on Nuka Crypt but I haven‚Äôt seen Bravo yet

What's your GT?
---
Hahaha, that could be true. But borderlands wasn‚Äôt the first to do that either, no one knows how they were inspired except the devs. 
---
Probably some big wig telling them ‚Äúonline service games are making a bunch of money, so take fallout and make it that so we can make more money, blah blah blah.‚Äù Then the best way they could adapt it was limited servers with a grouping mechanic, 4 being the standard across almost all games.
---
Ya it's my favorite place now
---
My level is 156. As I said to one of the replies, lights take away a lot of resources and most of my lights are outside. I maybe have a total of 6 inside the buildings?
---
tesla rifle is okay. other energy weapons needs that durabilty.
---
Whew! Ok
---
Agree, but sell price of items hardly matters right now since vendors are capped (har har) at 200.
---
Yeah that didn‚Äôt work for me :( guess after 5 nuclear keycards it‚Äôs not meant to happen hahaha thanks though mate.
---
1. PC
---
4.   Can't craft X-01 legs even though I appear to have all necessary materials. Anyone know what the issue here could be? I go to create X-01 legs and it is grayed out -- tells me I lack the materials, but every material on the list is displayed in white text. I can clearly see that the required materials are being met, yet no such luck. I can create the other pieces of the set without any problems. 
---
Haha fair enough. I'll add you in just a sec. IGN is TheJotunn. Maybe I'll have some Ultracite plans I can give you for the trouble or something =D thanks
---
No mods on em. That i know of... i should check that...
---
I'll get back with ya on that
---
A player might have pickpocketed you, did you notice anybody sneaking around?
---
Lol! Yeah. Only way i normally know. (Play in 1st person)
---
It can give you random event missions to go kill Scorched.
---
Hell no they weren‚Äôt first, (Remember titan quest 
---
?) but they evolved it significantly.
---
If anything they at least need to make it work like power armor where it negates your armor bonuses when worn but doesn't strip you naked every time you need to use it. 
---
So true I had like 2k steel then dropped like 1.8 then later I kept on running out for that
---
no
---
 Yes, I agree.  I just think it is not going to happen soon if ever.  
---
Is your stored items cleared out? Anything stored in your CAMP that isn‚Äôt built still takes up a lot of space. Usually once I delete everything there, I‚Äôm fine when it comes to build limit. 
---
Now I'm curious how many fissures there are to choose from. Five I think?  
---
(Not that anyone's ever dropped a nuke on teh one in the Ash Heap, but.)
---
They're farming the ghouls in the same way as the farmers are.  I think it's a dick move to destroy anyones base.  Maybe, disable the turrets if they're somehow one shotting the mobs I guess?
---
I think it'd be easy to patch in a little blue smoke like the cargo drops or something. And then maybe instead of a brown paper bag it's a locked blue and yellow Vault Tec lunchbox that can wither be opened by the dropee or someone with a level 3 lockpick skill

Why

Nimblejack32877
---
Wait a second. Each enemy drops stuff for each player separately as long as they got damage in on it? So if both me and another player shoot an enemy and I go up and take everything off of it, they can walk up and it appears unlooted to them?
---
So I can pretty much clean off anything from any enemy I find that has loot on it and I'm not stealing someone else's loot I'm only taking loot that was instanced to me?
---
Lol that‚Äôs probably it. Guess I‚Äôll just have to go with the regular .44
---
Want's it but thanks for trying.
---
I think 99% of people love in their power armor now. I know i do. 
---
I always sit at the same amount, and it makes trading with others difficult. I tend to carry a lot in my inventory just because of the stash size.
---
You didn't do "nothing" though. You're mutated now and you have to live with the side effects, you don't choose when that mutation attacks people, IT does. Treat it like having an automatic protective companion. Its like if you had arms that you couldn't control, and they start shooting people, you're still responsible for your appendages.
---
I don‚Äôt have many lights either. I have noticed after gaining a couple levels and going back to my camp I get more and more space. Might have to be a lot higher level to accomplish what I want to do! Anyways though very nice base, has to feel rewarding when you see other people using it.
---
Oh goody, I always go to fo76 to catch up on politcal news...
---
It should not be changed. It makes the most logical sense how it is now.
---
Maybe. I've tried and nobody seems to accept random friend invites. 
---
i played unarmed, but didnt build in power armour.  
---
late game fights are high rad areas.  
---
you either put on PA situationally, which is ok, but expensive without the perks.  
---
or you wear a hazmat suit and die easily. 
---
and you need the tesla bracers to use the unarmed perk in power armour effectively.  
---
i suggest going 1/2 handed melee.  you can use those perks in and out of PA.   
---
Oh maybe.
---
The single cups i grabbed were cloth. I guess that's good to know for making gunpowder but no one does that lol.

Something more than how it is currently, agreed.

Maybe they should introduce Perk cards for stash. Bethesda, take note! üòÇ
---
i don't recommend refracter. you don't need  much energy resistances. 
---
How are they farming if they‚Äôre not there?  I‚Äôve not seen loot on enemies killed while I‚Äôm away from my base. Has this changed in one of the updates?
---
Thank you! And it does!
---
I think they finally fixed the infinite loading screen at Poseidon.
---
A friend and I gave it another shot tonight to test it and we were actually able to get inside and do it this time
---
Each week they do an "inside the vault" update.
---
Its on their website
---
You can scrap the cheapest item possible, like light arms, to learn all available mods for all parts. It takes hundreds of them to unlock all mods though. The learn chance for armor mods is very low, and may be also dependent on intelligence.
---
I think that's more of the robots cleaning up all the dead bodies after the bombs dropped. I haven't played a bit but if recall correctly you don't find any bodies in Whitespring.
---
Those same "raiders" are the same lame asses who jump server the SECOND a player who can kills them shows up as well. Some raiders they are, what's the gang called? Feckless pussbag runaways.
---
Can‚Äôt wait until I can use a gatling laser.
---
Yeah this was supposed to be a game me and a friend played. We did play 76 together, but the nonstop disconnects and crashes I think wore them out and since launch we played I'd say 1/10th of what I thought we would. Thanks Bethesda.
---
Underneath the heaps of BS is quite an interesting game that has many great ideas but there is still quite a bit of bullshit on top that needs to be cleared off. And that's a big unknown if that'll ever be the case. Still I don't think playing it was nearly as bag as its reputation, albeit the amount of bullshit I endured in hindsight seems truly ridiculous. Not that it didn't at the time, but wow. 
---
I maintain that the east coast enclave were the rejects that had too much clout/dirt to get rid of easily, but were too annoyingly stupid to be let into the main group. So the main enclave moved to the oil rig and left the glue eaters of the east coast enclave to go hide in the whitepring where they would hopefully kill themselves off. 
---
There's a terminal entry where they tried to contact the west coast enclave and got no response. They concluded that the lines were hardened so there shouldn't be any interruption. So either the west coast was gone or they intentionally weren't responding. 
---
Oh goddammit. At least it isn‚Äôt r/nocontext 
---
My turrets have killed things while I was away and I've looted the meat piles for stuff.  Found a 2 shot lever action I still use actually. They probably don't get the EXP, but if you have the perks you want then the items are what they're farming right?
---
I think if you incur a bounty, you should be constrained to that same server until it's paid. Bounty should include 100% of costs needed to repair camp damage. AT THAT TIME starts a 72 hour counter, and when it expires you can server-hop again. 
---
People keep doubting that the map is four times the size of Fallout 4, but assuming the running speed is the same, it seems pretty fuckin big. I remember before F4 came out, a guy leaked some footage of him running corner to corner in around 10 minutes.
---
The machine is forcefully tearing radioactive cells from your body, of course its going to hurt. All these people complaining about little pinches and bumps. Grow the fuck up and get a pair! We are in the wasteland here, nit Chuck E Cheeses where they kiss your boo boos if you get an owie... For fuck sake man, show a little sack. God damn.
---
There‚Äôs around 10 fissure sites that I can think of 
---
I have so many questions like that.
---
Radwalker got cut, but plaguewalker is fine and plaguewalker causes all the NPCs to faint but no one noticed it in testing.....
---
So what did radwalker do to deserve the cut? What made that one "OP" or "broken"?
---
they've already talked about this and initially will reduced the distance between build areas so players can effectively have CAMPS right next to each other. If we hound them and enough time passes I'm sure we'll get clan plots out of the deal.
---
I know, but it‚Äôs a nice thought, with the hopes that someone from Bethesda sees this
---
Lol guns and a little electric shock are totally different. So that example was completely inaccurate. I didn‚Äôt get the mutation to destroy camps, it would literally hardly do any actual damage to a camp. It is a defense mutation and should not be treated as an attack on a camp. If anything it should just be an attack on the player. 
---
Hopefully 
---
I genuinely am amused by some of the glitches in this game. The mobs walking on walls, the super stretched out dogs, the power armor alien thing, teammates going invisible or naked... I love all that stuff
---
and i recommend bloody mess in luck. it is 'multiplicated' 15% damage boost. it is huge!
---
There is the last stand quest reward other than that,nope,unfortunately,although it‚Äôs the best non legendary armor modded 
---
The best advice I would give you is max marksman all 3 levels (regular, expert, and master). Due to marksman and commando being in the same branch. I would recommend thinking of going a melee as a backup. Followed by a few points in intelligence for +100 explosive for your grenades. I also believe there is a perk in strength or intelligence that increases grenade damage that also stacks with the 100% increase explosive dmg.
---
It was end of the month. So next week, unless it's been delayed.
---
i wanna rock this auto scatter tse laser.
---
If you're 12, have nothing yet, and need to ask your parents for some capital outlay to get going, nothing approaching $200 will give you a PC ticket. Remember many 12 year olds don't hold IT jobs or hobbies, don't have mates with spare parts, don't know how to install an OS or where to take it, and don't know how to cobble together a PC.   
---
Any laptop they get as a hand-me-down will have piss poor graphics that'll struggle running an A title from the last X years, hand-me-down desktops with enough RAM are rare, and new desktops are $1000 upwards, more if you need to include monitor and peripherals.   
---
And that's the small problem. The big problem is that all their friends have the same problem, and the bulk of their social group will inevitably gravitate towards the lower-cost of consoles. My kids, despite each having a PC game rig with a decent GPU I put together for them, steam accounts and all, still gravitate towards the playstation because most of the rest of their mates are there too, and you want to be where your mates are.  
---
Technically there is the glowing behemoth, but it's not a special boss or anything, just a stronger version of the behemoth that afaik can not be found in any way other than nuking the lake
---
This is one of the few ideas I really like about 76. At this point it would take time to implement but this is a really good idea. 
---
Now I know whenever someone is smacking me with a supersledge they‚Äôre just knocking on my door to see if I‚Äôm home 
---
I once found my bag inaccessible under a bed. and once the pointer was pointing to a rock. All i could think of was that the bag had clipped inside. We need more storage!
---
I know it's a bit late, but I was wondering if you're still offering this. Losing my mind trying to find it.
---
I sent you a message on PSN as well.
---
Everything in my stored is gone but I'm still over limit and still can't build wires. Even scrapped a turret and still can't place wires 
---
The Enclave aren't some group of sexual deviants... They would have nothing to gain from inflicting harm on themselves. Jesus Christ, this makes me sick. The Enclave are the smartest, most awesome, technologically advanced faction in the wastes. The raiders are the ones butt plugging and spanking their assholes with pennywinckles
---
This is what I originally thought because of so many fissures being present, total missed opportunity 
---
They're rare i kill them very frequently.
---
Willing to buy this if it‚Äôs still available for PS4
---
They‚Äôre out there for sure but not for caps or anything short of real money, or multiple god roll  items. Agree with your sentiment about them being similar to TSE in OPness just TSE got so out of control duped you even have lvl 5s one shotting people with pumps lmao
---
It is definitely a turd sandwich on a whole wheat butt bun with extra spicy shit sauce. however, I have some really good memories. Mostly playing with friends, and battling it out over a workshop, or just building a base to pass the time. Still, overall disapointed, obviously.
---
How did you finish the overseers journey quest and the kill a wendigo in a clown suit quest? I think both of those are bugged and won‚Äôt complete. 
---
Explain how it is logical? It is a defense mutation for melee attacker, not a mutation to help me destroy bases,m. It would be logical if it just started PvP with the player and not create a bounty on me for simply standing there. 
---
$$$
---
Thanks!
---
That was working 2-4 weeks ago.
---
Willing to pay 2K caps
---
I want some cool extra effects. Or an expansion of what power armor mods can do. Something. I like my PA. But it's boring. I'd love a chance to find a set of t51b with some built in strength besides the motion assist servos. Some t60 arms that can fight unarmed on par with a 50 fist weapon. Or maybe just let us put more than one mod on each piece. We can have jet pack and motion assist setvos. Calibrated shocks and explosive vents. Or maybe they're legendary mods that have 2 effects. Idk. I like my power armor. I have a full set of everything because I like variety. But there's so little difference in everything
---
People can pick pocket stuff off us?
---
As soon as you make rad-resist work in Normal Armor, sure.
---
But before that, hell no. PA is already too good.
---
Receipt?
---
If your internet connection has a lot of packet loses you are more likely to experience disconnects.
---
99% of people already live in PA since it's simply far more convenient. No one wants to spend 100k+ caps an a god roll set of Normal Armor and then have to take it off for end game nuke zones.
---
Its logical because you have a mutation that spews energy from you when struck. How are you not getting this? If your best friend smacked you and you were covered in tar, they wouldn't be spared just because they were your friend. Anything touches you, anything gets zapped. It's common sense.
---
Thats 1lbs each, i am throwing that shit away. Oh my god, there is no reason to farm anything in this game. 
---
Just found one and got it after seeing how rare it is in this thread. Kinda disappointing.
---
Legion? As In Caesar's Legion?
---
If so, then you are about 150 years too early and 1,500 miles too far away for all that.
---
I leave Single-Action Revolver Ivory Grip plans. Granted I throw away more than I 'give' away but it is the thought that counts. Anyone who knows the game, knows they are shit. 
---
My biggest disappointment in Fallout 4 was that reactive plates didn't work like real life reactive plates. (Firing off at the incoming projectile.)
---
The worst part is if u pick up something before retrieving the bag and die again the 1 item becomes the quest marker and good luck finding the real one
---
I don't think a pulse of energy would be self aware or intelligent enough to differentiate targets. And in the scheme of things, an electric shock jutting from you as an attack, and arms shooting from you as an attack, are pretty similar actions.
---
I'm waiting for my vampiric gatling plasma
---
That's solid gold
---
He's sacrificed who knows what for the sake of the users. It's time we return the favor.
---
We ride at dawn
---
Trying to come help, not letting me join game yet...
---
I usually leave Plans and recipes I know already in the suitcases.
---
I'm actually surprised they let the parts stack that much I figured there would have been a limit like 2 at full then the others would either have deminishing returns or no effect at all.
---
That would require effort via the mods. Don't hold your breath.
---
You can't turn him hostile against you. First time i found him i traded and then wondered what loot he would drop...emptied my gun into his head,  didn't do any damage and he didn't mind one bit. 
---
I suspect this is going to win the "greatest thing I have seen today" award. Still got a few hours left though so don't celebrate just yet.
---
I hate that so many people are forced to go PA or hazmat in nuke zones. It doesn't bother me at all because I enjoy wearing power armor. I've really enjoyed nuking SBQ with drop site v9 outside the zone and keeping the fight outside the zone so no one has to worry about hazmat/PA. I've got a full set of 2/3* unyielding heavy combat armor and I never use it, not even sure why I haven't sold it anymore.
---
Get the Constructor perk level 2 and the cost is halved. Worth it for the decontamination shower if you are not running nuke zones very often. 
---
Definitely still bugged. Looting Toxic Valley Treasure Map #3 requires Savage Divide Treasure Map #4:
---
https://i.imgur.com/u3xTYaF.mp4
---
One more thing. You can farm Radshield and Radaway. I did this for a SBQ fight recently. The cost is in time spent.
---
I have not tested this but cola nut + Nuka grape restores 800+ rads + decent HP. 
---
Top of The World. Skiing stuff counts
---
Here's my Armchair Developer^TM ideas(For what they're worth):
---
Legendary items should be able to be broken down into "Infused Ultracite" if you have a "Prototype Workbench"(Plans would be rewarded from SBQ event the first time you kill her). Infused Ultracite would then be able to re-roll Legendary modifiers(increasing with the star count, level, and amount of times you re-rolled it) or to "infuse" other legendaries with other legendaries of higher level/star count to bring it up to speed.
---
There should be daily "Wasteland Warrior" challenges after Level 50 that reward Caps and XP and if you complete all of them, you get a legendary(Would be 1 star at Level 50, 1-2 stars at Level 100, 1-3 stars at Level 150, 2-3 stars at level 200, and 3 stars at Level 250).
---
Do I think Legendaries should be rare? Yes and no. Legendaries are an important part of what I like to call "Build Refinement". Therefore, they should be obtainable in a consistent way, with random drops being supplemental.
---
For example, Scorchbeast Queen is a boss that requires a large number of players and teamwork to take down. Therefore, she should be far more rewarding than any other legendary in the game. The first time you kill her per day(week?), she should drop 1 Legendary Armor Piece, 1 Legendary Weapon, and 1 random Legendary, 1 of which is garunteed to be 3-star. That would make her feel far more rewarding. There should also be a way to increase the difficulty of the fight to make it even more rewarding(perhaps launching multiple nukes at Fissure Site Prime?).
---
Also, add a "Regicide" badge or paint or something so we can show off that we've killed her.
---
Obviously lol you clearly need to reread the post and comments 
---
I am talking about how I get a bounty for someone hitting me lol
---
Definitely happened in FO4.
---
The only one i would buy is ofcourse a usa exclusive i wont be able to buy
---
Make sure to aim it at the ground for the first shot. Failure to do so may void your warranty
---
You're missing the point. There is no reason- none- for a level 20 legendary mole rat to spawn    at firebase hancock during an event. 
---
Yeah, okay, level 20 enemies drop level 20 weapons.  But that isn't the point.  The point is that the cranberry bog's enemies should be higher level than Grafton's enemies because it is a late- game area of the map.   
---
Risk= reward, but low risk enemies are spawning in areas that are supposed to be HIGH RISK. 
---
It'll the make the community managers' jobs more manageable and effiecient.
---
I'm sorry, I was being a troll, players cannot pickpocket you. You were most likely the victim of a horrible glitch that some people have reported. At leat it was a legendary that you got from a quest and not a two shot explosive you looted though.
---
Same lol, very few problems, only a couple crashes
---
Rather it burn and crash into hell so Bethseda never trys this again but take one look at this sub and you'll see the problem.
---
I wanna know what‚Äôs up with the unmarked fissure site in the north east of the map. 
---
Both?  There's 3 power plants...i was once a madman and took over all 3 at once and powered them up. 
---
I had my reasons though....wanted that fusion reactor recipe
---
But I mean it so it's different lol. I KNOW IN MY HEART IT'S TRUE YOU CAN DOWNVOTE ALL YOU WANT, I CAN TAKE IT!
---
Weird.
---
I just tested it, both affected the bolt at the same time but only one or the other for the semi-auto.
---
The different versions of the Xbox One have different issues with the game?
---
Ah ok I was wondering for a sec. Thanks!
---
Getting your C.A.M.P. just right &gt;&gt;&gt; trying to fight off three screech-spamming scorchbeasts at once
---
No contest, folks.
---
Do you have a son Bart?
---
I died about 10 seconds after I crafted myself marsupial serum. I can jump so high this is awesome! *Splat*
---
It is funny how it changes though. When for first walk in there it's an absolute death trap and you are running for your life. Afterwards its quite a peaceful place and you can spend your time taking in the scenery and exploring all around the city.
---
&gt;  1.what is currently most optimal cap farming? I hear outfits have great weight/price ratio 
---
&gt; 3.what are faster way for leveling, doing quests sucks so I place my bet on grinding enemies on specyfic events or nuked zone
---
Event/workshop hopping is a good way. Events in particular may also answer your XP farming question. Also whitesprings golf club ghoul farming.
---
If you have perks/bobbleheads and a map, cap stash farming maybe?
---
Outfits are what I do though. Spacesuits, civil war hats and outfits, straight jackets, ranger outfits, ski and golf clothing, those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head that are worth a fair bit of caps and are easily farmed in low level zones
---
&gt;2. What's the point of legendary weapons when everybody aiming for double shot or explosive prefix 
---
Can't tell you a whole lot since I don't know much about the meta. glass cannon builds are fairly popular and they would rely on low-health procs from various perks and legendary effects, for one example. 2shot and explosive are getting nerfed soon, and who knows if things will be balanced or ever will be properly balanced. But I definitely see a lot of people looking for legendaries other than these.
---
&gt; 4.anyone knows any future plans on game?
---
I am fairly certain PVP servers are something coming very soon. They mentioned DLC will be free, but as to what the scale of these DLC will be is unknown. Vaults opening up, new quests, new perks are a few other things I've heard them mention. Unsure about dungeon or raid content. Check out their weekly/biweekly blog posts ("Inside the Vault" i think) to see what they are cookin up
---
Glad to help a new player and I hope you enjoy the game as much as we do here, but honestly cap and xp and legendary farming is tedious stuff and this game is at its best when you are enjoying the things which are not tedious and farm-y. I don't want players to come into it thinking its like a grindy MMO...I'm not really sure what to call it, Fallout-lite with friends I suppose?
---
This I can get behind.  Would imply that all the fissures are exits to a giant underground labyrinth and the SBQ could pop up anywhere which would go a long way to explaining how the disciplined BoS and Orbitally equipped Enclave both lost to giant bat.
---
Oh true. I wasn't even thinking about that lmao shiiiiiiiiiiit
---
Hey what's up? MY TSE doesn't one shot these people? That's some broken BS. Fix it now! I need to one shot everybody!
---
Perhaps CAMPs should only be destructible to you if the owner is hostile to you? No PvP handshake, no CAMP destruction.
---
Whoaaaa!!!! I‚Äôm in!
---
I read it quite thoroughly in fact. You're saying you want your non sentient mutation to differentiate WHEN you want it to protect you.
---
What are it's stats? 
---
That's weird thanks tho. Got like 7 minutes left on it thought I could do it on my own 
---
John Rambo is officially started. He is only level 5 so far. Trying to level using no armor and only combat knives thus far for weapons is pretty slow but I am enjoying it.
---
It's forcing me into melee stealth kills which I have never really messed around with before.
---
This is dumb. This is really dumb.
---
There are fissure sites located in the low level areas. Nuking them would be horrible for the newer players.
---
I couldn't resist.
---
Unmarked?  The one at the farm or further east?
---
Lol never did say I wanted to control when and where it goes off
---
I am saying to stop the mutation from affecting camps because it is stupid that I get a bounty when I was not the attacker.
---
I would be fine with it creating PvP and damage to a player but a camp is just dumb, because it has barely any damage anyways
---
And no a small shock and arms with guns are not the same. 
---
Since you've posted nothing but rants about the game for over a month now, I'd say it is indeed time for you to go play some other game. This isn't healthy, amigo.
---
Yeah but you can go to another player's camp, drop a few fertilizer and throw a Molotov on it.
---
No, not yet at least. Still having fun with it.
---
Nice. **Ad hominem attacks**. A clear sign that you're going to be easy to factually dismantle.
---
AREA TAGGING. Which I specifically MENTIONED. Like in other Looter Shooters. You have no clue what this means. If you are in the vicinity you also get the loot, and in some games even the xp. Destiny has it. Warframe has it. Games with easily defeated henchman in open world quick join settings have this. 
---
Your welcome for this lesson.
---
Well they sell them pretty pricey
---
It‚Äôs on the road to the west of Clancy Manor. 
---
I was waiting for someone to go out of their way for this 
---
\*holds breath anyways\*
---
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh its been said a million times. You're not wrong. It's just been said... a lot
---
At some point holding onto the anger and outrage costs more then the money you lost... or something. Truthfully, I have no idea what I'm talking about and am most certainly a hypocrite in this area. Still though, seeing someone else stay angry always strikes me as being so inefficient. I wish I could apply observation to myself. 
---
Same i have so mamy chems i ean out a vendor qith though someone else mentioned 40+ caps for a straihht jacket so ima start fsrmijg those
---
I am also a Bloodied build and it has happened twice to me, I'm on PS4 btw. The time I remember distinctly, I was walking in a nuke zone with power armor on and rad x active, around just under 20% health and 50% rads and I suddenly drop dead from nothing, just from 20% to 0% in a quarter of a second.
---
Actually the "low level area" is already protected from nukes, when you go to launch a nuke a sizable portion of the left hand side of the map is un-nukable, I'd say anything outside of that is fair game. 
---
It‚Äôs on the road west of Clancy Manor. 
---
I thought the nerf was tomorrow to TSE weapons
---
Next to the cabin? Nuked it once, not worth it. 
---
This is one of those missions that you're never really prepared for unless someone gives you the heads up (or you've done it before). You need to prepare not only for this mission, but the one after--be it the SBQ, Whitesprings, or whatever. 
---
Depending upon your build, it will take varying amounts of time. My PA build takes some time, as I don't have a TSE weapon. My Unarmed/sneak build is pretty quick, as I don't have to deal with turrets (due to stealth) and can  one shot every enemy. I can literally sneak past every enemy if I choose too.
---
When considering a silo run, I always play on the server for a bit to see if it's stable or not. If that's your goal, doing the nuclear key card mission is always solid, as you can never have too many. Shooting the cargobot out of the air is a good indicator of server lag. If the server is laggy, get out an find a new one. Server hopping is a thing and will make a massive difference. 
---
I will say that just because you find a good server, it will NOT guarantee you success if you nuke the Prime Fissure. Every single time I've nuked it, my game has crashed. However, every single time someone else has, I've never crashed. Good luck there &amp; party up. Also, just clip the Prime Fissure, while leaving the Glassed Cavern and DZ9 untouched so people can fast travel there and fight the SBQ outside of the nuke zone.
---
Regardless, if you wanna get good, practice the early part of the silo, even if you don't intend on launching a nuke. You can waste a lot of time trying to get your Biometric ID card. Know the process, what to do, and where to go. If you're with an experienced group, chances are this will be your duty while they clear the way. After that, it's off to the races until you need to repair the mainframe cores. I tend to find half of them, then craft the remainder. Ain't nobody got time for that. Beyond that, it's smooth sailing.
---
I'm hoping those are upcoming skins. The red X-01 is the hot rod paint from Fallout 4. I fucking loved that and want it in 76.
---
Well sure, but have you killed a mountain of ghouls with a flaming chainsaw? Makes for a good photo on top of the bodies. I would recommend doing it at night for the best flame effect. I really wanna collect like 10 of em modded and repaired. Hand em out at whitesprings and watch the mayhem.
---
Alright well if that's how you want to spend your time. 
---
For WV the best locale would no doubt be Morgantown.  Plenty of traffic, tons of younger potential customers (it‚Äôs a college town), close to other major cities/towns in the area 
---
Good luck getting cheap land there though.
---
Yea, I noticed that when I shoot enemies that are too close I can one-shot myself üòÅ
---
You're approached by a frenzied Scientist who yells, I'm going to put my quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber! What do you do?
---
Says anyone on reddit ever.
---
Cap farming? Easy. Farm people.
---
Wrong! I am saying I want no damage on camps for that mutation. Not saying to protect me only when I want. It does minimal damage in the first place. It is not a mutation to help me destroy bases lol so why have it to where I am the one killed a lose junk and caps because an idiot started hitting me. Makes no sense. It is meant to stop a melee attacker and do a small amount of damage. 
---
Serious question.  In your mind's eye, are these big wigs smoking cigars in a dimly lit conference room?
---
Level 2 contractor
---
Why Richmond?  It has no ties to the Fallout universe AFAIK. 
---
Modus did a pretty good job taking out the trash. 
---
I always just took for granted that the controls of PA that you could see when entering and exiting were just a lazy digital misrepresentation of what the actual controls would have to be for the suit to be any use.
---
If the controls are really as over simplified as they look PA would need its own weapons. Probably would have mittens instead of individual fingers. The lack of feedback in addition to the increased strength would make something as simple as a doorknob be challenging to use with just pushing the door off the door jamb. 
---
The argument that you can or cannot do something in this game because of realism is as fantastical as the premise for the entire game.
---
Now I just let them kill me. They fly away, and I save 10 stimpacs. 
---
Happy cake day! 
---
It's really hit or miss with the servers and is still undeniably an issue. What's so frustrating to me is the randomness, I helped kill the SBQ three times on a server without a hiccup a few days ago then crashed twice in a row on a different one while sorting my stash at camp.
---
Isn't that game guide mostly trash? Like it doesn't have much useful info in it e.g. weapon/armour mods and what they do?
---
I'm 99% sure it's rad damage related, but it's never killed me before.
---
I killed 3 scorched beasts and all the adds, but fell in a Cranberry Bog trench..... Dead.
---
Walked by the barrels at the flooded train yard..... Dead.
---
Neither of those things stack at least 84 HP worth of rads instantly. It's really weird.
---
Congrats on Winning!
---
Yessssssssss
---
What's nuka crypt?
---
I hear the screeee over my camp
---
Start to the start screen thanks
---
This dude is legit, ladies &amp; gentlemen. Just got hooked up an X01 Jetpack &amp; Calibrated Shocks (x2) for being the first to get the answers right! 
---
Hurry up! 2 winning spots remaining! 
---
Thanks, man! 
---
Deng Ive never seen a nuke go off in the Ash Heap, that would be interesting
---
Yes, you should.
---
I hate it when companies release auto-join shooter games that don't have area tagging in 2019. 
---
Pretty much.
---
Got someone you‚Äôre pissed at?  Kite an SB to their base. 
---
Down to fornicate
---
This times 1 million. Bethesda messed up, not the people using good weapons.  
---
So your argument, if I understand correctly, is ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no reason to use prime receivers in the game?‚Äù
---
Whether your making it because min-maxing isn‚Äôt your personal cup of tea, or because you like melee builds or some weapon that eats ammo slower than peace in the Middle East, it‚Äôs a lame argument. 
---
I‚Äôll grant prime receivers don‚Äôt make sense on a lot of weapon they are available for, but there‚Äôs good reason to go prime for some weapons, and a steady supply of flux helps with their ammo. 
---
Particularly for the automatics. The ‚Äúnatural rate‚Äù at which you stumble across the required mats and flora isn‚Äôt enough to make ammo as fast as you use it. 
---
Farming doesn‚Äôt mean you need doing it. I‚Äôll piggyback a run opportunistically, and it‚Äôll feed half a week to a week‚Äôs worth of ammo, but information on how to do this in 40 minutes rather than 4 hours is valuable: 
---
According to internet buzz dj, youre a bro. I found this researching whether I should spend 400 caps on it. Kudos.
---
Send me a request! I want to "inspect" your base!
---
Spoiler**  its worth shit loads apparently
---
The thought of people running around with mods installed on top of all the duping issues that have plagued this game seems so exponentially worse to me. The amount of cheaters in this game is kind of mind boggling but I can also understand... as I am an old man, perhaps my younger self wouldn't have taken issue with it. Hell I may have joined in, peer pressure and all that jazz. 
---
I can message on xbox :( suspendes from messaging
---
considering how many posts you dedicated to disliking fallout 76 you should really pick up another game, maybe replay the old ones 
---
Why on earth you still playing ? Only thing i see from you is just getting mad about game that apparently you don't enjoy. Just change game .
---
Argh! It's very early morning. I didn't see the /sarcasm :D
---
i‚Äôm just waiting on that no restriction pvp they‚Äôre planning
---
Xbox here, same thing. Lucky to get 20 mins on a server. 
---
Ok awesome, I added you. See you in West Virginia!
---
I wear full paint splat metal and a pirate hat, I usually give other plays a stab when i see them. often ask myself if I'm a raider
---
that stupid robot, she's gonna blow up the bunker!
---
Same. Killed a lvl 76 legendary yao guai today...aaand... A 3 star junkie's rolling pin. Sold it to the vendor for 8 caps. *sigh*
---
Private message me on reddit?
---
Waiting for the limited one that costs more than the fucking game to go on firesale, just cause the fluff looks cool...
---
Not a big boom, and it gives you tome to get away
---
i sent you a message !!
---
Rofl yes it will. I will still 1 shot everything with my TSE shotgun I guarantee it. Except maybe scorchbeasts now.
---
Yes! I love the space station! An alien event should definitely be a thing.
---
Players can jump in front of you while you're looking through your scope too.
---
No Ultracite :(

I‚Äôm not familiar with the expression - not a common one where I live.

Okay.

Its basically a positive mutation to have even if its weak since there is no downside to it.

Out of my way? Brother, this is on the corner outside my front fucking door.

I have bo idea why you are being downvoted. I was ready to, because of your username, but you make are giving good advice.

Before they want? Nahhh. Before they DO it? Yeah. 
---
I honestly doubt it
---
I saw this today. I saw one fall from the sky and I was cracking up!
---
agree
---
I'm in ash heap. several times now i have literally logged in,heard eerie bat scream and just say "nope" /quit
---
What really ticked me off is I collected 5000 Halloween candy from farming the monster bash event and got a crappy legendary PIPE WRENCH!!!!!!!!!!!!! ( Which also sold for around 8 caps)
---
Fingers crossed I get super powers!
---
Fair enough. Though I was still expecting it regardless 
---
Please don't take this the wrong way I am being completely sincere: as a fellow disabled gamer who has emotionally stability control issues from head injuries (I could never play this game without my medication, I would rage out), if the bugs are causing you distress I would recommend playing some Nintendo Switch games. I game on PC, Xbox One and Switch. Nintendo has by far the best quality control for their games so many fewer bugs, particularly their first part software. If you want another loot grinder the Switch version of Diablo III is great. 
---
Problem being
---
Server hop to take vendors new stock / other players take whole inventory to on sell at cunty mark ups...
---
Idk, my friend ordered a copy so long ago he forgot about it til it came in today. We were laughing at some of the stuff in there.
---
That's no problem, I'm not into PvP and disabled damage to other players in the game settings. I only wish that worked on the whitesprings robots too..
---
Game is dying. It needs players, and not just the drones who will buy literally any game they put out.
---
Ahhh Yongyea I remember when his channel was filled with insightful theories and news about future games..
---
Now it‚Äôs all too often 20 min rants creating fake controversies like that inaccessible dev room.. why am I supposed to be mad for an *inaccessible* dev room? There‚Äôs one in every game they put out..
---
Anyway I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre enjoying it, what‚Äôs really keeping me going is the devs listening to our feedback so well. Hopefully we see this game to its full potential soon‚Äô
---
I mean I disagree completely with the "no middle ground" stance, as...I'm in the middle? I enjoy aspects of this game, I dislike other aspects, I dislike aspects of the community and love other aspects? There 100% are people who are hardline "bethesda did nothing wrong" and "bethesda is a irredeemable garbage fire" but a fair few of us are just "please fix this shit so I can enjoy it as much as I want to". 
---
For me is always one type of perks. I heard few days ago that if gun have legendary effect is still bugged, but on my pipe guns i didin't notice difference .
---
2. Can't get to top level of the Monorail Elevator.  Keeps taking me to the ground floor.
---
I don‚Äôt see why the vendor couldn‚Äôt have a cap limit exclusive to each player and only have one of each item available per player. 
---
Ps4 here  crash maybe once a week if that 
---
LOL. Pussies, ;) I keep the music turned way down so I can hear the first hint of her wings. I get away all the time.
---
 My first char killed one at level 30 and we have fought with them since but they leave, or its Watoga. One strafed my house on the edge of its attack Watoga pattern the other day and I met 3 people and hung about with 2 of em' for a while.
---
 They are actually the best thing in the game. A seriously steep learning curve, but you need an apex predator. ;)
---
Yeah you don't wanna carry around too much junk. Maybe lots of other stuff, but store your junk often. Get that junk in the trunk.
---
If this is PC open task manager and force close FO76, i had it happen a few times and I exit the game but it's still running in task manager. Also close the launcher from there too if you leave your PC on for long periods my launcher will get up to 4 gigs.
---
A bolt of electricity is going to hurt whatever it strikes, theres a reason people don't want lightning in their house.
---
Don't forget gold clubs at Whitespring.
---
agreed.... but the incoming nerf for two shot explosive weapons there still is a high market for them.say you can spend atoms to obtain 4-5 legendary weapons. your f2p game now can gross alot of money
---
It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve encountered Grahm with caps. 
---
Two words. Server lag
---
I like to nuke places other than White Sulphur Springs and Prime. Mainly for flux and a change of venue. I've always had high level enemies spawn at my drop zones no matter where I launch though. My ol lady picked Charleston though due to the fact we live in Boone, WV. I launched it roughly at the same time u speak of though. Lol
---
Dont we have a wandering trader which takes a week to find anyway. 
---
Next time get it straight before you comment with such ignorance:) 
---
i enjoyed this game. but i can't recommend this game to other peoples. too much crash, too much laggy, too much buggy, too much unstable... 
---
That's the thing though. It reads..."kill robots with unarmed: 0/1111" This is the best theory so far, but I'm wondering if there's a second level to this, like the kill scorched goes from level one of 76 to level two of 760. Maybe there's more after completing this first set of challenges? 
---
I just can't accept that the devs put these in like this just because they're robots. I mean, yeah, they did the bug jars...but even I think there's still more to that. 
---
Don't compare it to fallout 4 they're totally different and not supposed to be the same 
---
No I've been having a pretty decent time with it too. I run my whole thing on Ultra though cause that's what the nvidia driver recommends for my PC.
---
Can't really say why. Maybe it's just because I tend to play a singular way and my play style doesn't make use of particular things in the game that are buggy. Like I barely use power armor at all, and never use energy weapons (if it's not burning nitro or nitrate it's not for me).
---
Could be that I tend to read on here a lot about what's bugged and avoid doing that stuff.
---
Worked for me in Fallout 4 too.
---
Gauss rifles are good
---
[Nuka crypt](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) is the website where the weekly nuclear launch codes are posted. 
---
I wish.
---
Did you have more with fo4 or 76? I‚Äôm gonna choose one
---
Lol, yeah. *feels bad man* I need to do more events, for sure.
---
Thanks science guy 
---
Still irrelevant lol 
---
Doesn't matter. if a player stands in front of you when you shoot... you will die.
---
In my honest opinion FO76 has got to be one of the most difficult games to play with your friends just because of simple mechanics issues and lack of scope for multiplayer. 
---
Thanks
---
Ok cool! Feel free to join me anytime you see me on. I'm usually playing solo
---
Nope. I've only gotten mods by breaking down weapons and armor.
---
Some guy i met gave me some lvl 15 power armor and i was super grateful because I‚Äôm only level 18
---
You learn that watching Bill Nye? 
---
Bwahahaha! This is exactly the kind of thing that would happen to me. 
---
The gymnasium of the school in Grafton usually has a couple of those big rollie containers of kickballs and basketballs, also baseball equipment if I remember correctly.
---
I'm sorry you're being so heavily demonized. I can understand that it could very well be an honest lapse of judgement. Simply stick with "I'm sorry, I will be more careful in the future" and you might just get leniency. Good luck.
---
I think it‚Äôs a lot of beginner stuff you never realize like 10mm pistols and machetes 
---
Put the materials in your inventory.
---
Then what were you like?
---
I learned a soup recipe but I don't remember which one it was. I also learned the Assaultron Helmet from scrapping Assaultron Heads. A teammate of mine got the same thing as a plan drop from an Assaultron, so it definitely exists as both.
---
That's all. I've never learned costume plans or other helmet plans.
---
lol it's all good.
---
As long as your rented it, you'll spawn back to that server!
---
I like the idea, just nothing currently in game to support the idea 
---
Not entirely sure, also depends on your level when you complete the quest to determine the level it will be when obtaining it
---
That‚Äôs actually brilliant 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/
---
:/
---
If only it were as simple as that. Thank you for luck. 
---
That‚Äôs true but I like to think that it isn‚Äôt meant to be taken seriously. More of a game just meant to mess around with instead of a competitive/strategic one. 
---
Honestly it was fun getting oneshotted by fat man and me trying to snipe him but I decided that I should warn others not to pick lock unknown airdrops 
---
I do the same thing.  LoL üòÅ
---
Would be nice if you could randomly learn a plan from picking up a mod that is just sitting around in the world. 
---
I've been in one there. It's rather boring. Very few enemies and next to no nuked flora.
---
The game is only fun with friends, but that says nothing since literally anything can be fun with friends. Watching paint dry can be fun with the right people. 
---
You know it's true. Constant bad press. Bleeding players. No end game means less returning players. Nobody who hasn't already bought the game will buy the game.
---
I'm a lvl55, I got a warning bonk from a lvl135's war drum last night.... (pacifist ON obvs)
---
Turns out he wasn't quite finished dumping his legendary bits in the bag, before I had a look...
---
I gave him a ???, he gave me a üëé and finished his dump, then gave me the üëç and a wave before he ran away to kill something else.
---
Good times.
---
I want wooby flair for Reddit 
---
I think "craftable version" is just an extremely poor way to say modification.
---
but even with that I have only every gotten mods from scrapping. never by using or picking it up, so maybe it is just a tool tip for a mechanic that didnt make it to release.
---
&gt; This could also potentially be how we add new nuke bosses to the game. 
---
**No.** Not everyone can play often enough to hit every boss and if the bosses have unique loot then you'd have to wait for some certain boss to come back around... what is this WoW?
---
That‚Äôs something a super would say.
---
I mean they do keep buying it, but you do you.
---
Ya cause reddit is the place all real investers go to drum up capital.
---
I‚Äôve been launching solo, and getting faster each time, but I get lost after fixing reactor every time :(
---
Me and my friends can have fun beating eachother with sticks
---
"its fun with friends" is true of almost anything. 
---
Someone actually paid you to build them a camp? Was it with caps or real money?
---
Save your money. The games is likely going F2P soon and isn't even worth 20 dollars on a good day. The game is a shallow cashgrab that makes even Fallout 4 look like the best RPG ever.
---
certain items can be learned from scrapping, the robot helmets for example are learned from scrapping certain items, there is one particular helmet that can only be learnt from scrapping said helmet. and theres probably others
---
Ive dressed as santa and gave coal to players a number of times.At their CAMP My buddy dresses as an elf. 
---
We play white christmas on the mic. Or gramma got run over by a raindeer. Then smash your camp. I always make an entrance through the roof. 
---
When you kill santa. He only drops coal.
---
Fun times 
---
this is real ! 2 calibrated shocks and a jet pack, crazy 
---
proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/svnEfYo
---
&gt; how? Why?
---
Only Bethesda knows why one can‚Äôt wield power fist while in power armor - but it‚Äôs cool to wield that tiny switch blade while in power armor 
---
If that‚Äôs the case it really is just the wrong setting for that. 
---
Your point was that people don‚Äôt  have gaming friends, and that‚Äôs why FO76 has been slated. And that‚Äôs just not the case at all. 
---
Stick up for it all you want, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite as bad as people make out. It was simply a badly managed development with no clear direction. They wanted to replicate ESO in the fallout universe, and it has been done badly. 
---
That is an awful defense of the game. Be better than that.
---
Friend and I always drop some ammo to make sure bag is there before dropping anything important.
---
as a single player game, fallout 4. kinda hard to beat mods.
---
as a multiplayer game, fallout 76. different people means different outcomes. and stumbling on peoples camps, while useless unless you need to scrap or stash, is still fun to me.
---
I got too close to a fissure (not knowing what it was) and got ganked by a scorchbeast. I burned 5 Stealthboys to get my bag back and run away.
---
Huh.
---
Oh my fuck please. It has to be able to do this though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tukQDg22o9M
---
But having blue smoke will signal other people walking by that there's your stuff that they can just take.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
LMAO, yup my bad.
---
Looks great dude!
---
I picked up a vegetable medley soup and it said I learned the recipe
---
never anything else and never an actual craftable item at shotgun etc
---
I have p.o ked up and scrapped several hundred pump actions/double barrels and never been able to craft one..... pretty sure I got all the mods tho now lol
---
Remap your controls
---
Caps! 
---
Yeah. It was far from consistent.
---
In 7-8 hops it was full once. Partial a couple of times, but three majority of the time there was nothing.
---
It was for sure different from closer to launch.
---
At first i chalked it up to ppl getting their first but a couple of times i opened the doors to find nothing.
---
Welcome. To. Capitalism. Meat. Baaag. Ha. Ha. Ha.
---
-Raider bot, probably.
---
What do you mean? Does he not reset? Cause I've only encountered him twice in my entire time playing...."sigh"
---
Also for some reason I heal them half the time and vats hits do very little dmg.
---
I have one for iou toilet paper that I love to randomly drop in people's bases haha
---
well considering it took EA/Dice a year to "fix" SWBF2 (ie. most major content came out Nov/Dec last year and more in Jan/Feb this year). I'd say u would probably want to wait the same amount of time for this, it will take time for new content and fixes to come, its just the way it is.
---
I‚Äôve only seen him a few times, and he seems to never have 200 caps on him. 
---
The mini putting green outside the side entrance of the Whitesprings building also has a ton of golf balls and clubs. Past the pool and down the road there‚Äôs a guard shack with more of them as well as small store building with a ton of pencils for lead.
---
LMAO.  Guess you don't get how hilariously stupid it is that golf clothes sell for more than "magical" gear.  Go back to your elite forum life and leave me alone.
---
I love how you used the garage door to make shuttered windows for a shop. how and where people build when player shops open up will be fun to see.
---
How many caps does that cost?
---
Ok üëå 
---
If you have unyielding with +1 strength  armor you can add another 5.
---
Or pretty much any explosive shotgun in the game
---
i feel like I had assaultron helmet and another helmet from lvl 1.... didn't see an assaultron till lvl 20+
---
As far as weight, ever actually held a tommy gun?  They‚Äôre heavy AF. 
---
I‚Äôm level 36 and I have been playing for around 2-3 weeks ish and I have only crashed around 2 times and they were both during that one brotherhood of steel quest 
---
Or the trash/news bins outside the train stations.
---
Also ammo and scrap in a suitcase is a good way to clear some STASH space.
---
Second 
---
Exactly.
---
If its labeled sulfur water that's cool. I take it as a reference toward the actual name of the resort. Our governor WV is the owner of the White Sulfur Spring resort and golf course. 
---
Its pretty good.
---
End game is lacking but you'll get a solid 30-40 hours or more of fun.
---
There's a heavy bias in the media as the launch was shakey.
---
I will say pc seems worse off than console though. It is a console port
---
12 year olds don‚Äôt have IT jobs? 
---
I guess you need to have a good talk with the other master race players out there because I am hearing conflicting things from you on the cost of pc gaming. For years now all I hear from the crowd that likes to bash consoles is that you can get a PC that runs better for the same cost, with cheaper games and less cost to stay upgraded. (Side note-this console bashing is usually done by some pretty toxic people who use not so nice language while they do so. Must be kids)
---
I suppose the initial cost could be higher with monitors and what not if your unwilling to settle for a cheap/used monitor or just hook it up to an existing tv. But why is the cost of a tv not factored into console gaming but monitors are for pc? 
---
My PC is nothing special and has survived this console generation just fine (aside from my power supply) despite me getting it in the ps3 era. A few upgrades that will not cost anywhere near the cost of a PS5 and it will be just fine for that generation as well. So I don‚Äôt agree with your assessment that hand me downs or old computers in general cannot play AAA online games, because it simply is not true. Once again, you don‚Äôt need to run things on ultra high settings. If you personally value graphics then good for you, but they are irrelevant to this discussion.
---
Also, your entire argument is based on the assumption that the majority of toxic players are children. That is very much up for debate and makes this entire cost for entry argument we are having fairly pointless.
---
&gt; you instantly get banned for entering the room
---
&gt; don‚Äôt spoil the surprise
---
It ain‚Äôt adding up well for the player.
---
And they are immortal to people who have tse or no tse. Which is broken. Expect nerfs.
---
My camp got attacked 2 days in a row now. Yes it's at whitesprings, by the pond near the snake, farther down the stream by the fences. Each time it was two people on a team. One guy had a high bounty, 1000+. The other just watched. I caught them in the act both times, killed them, claimed the bounty and received 1 cap. They spawned somewhere nearby but out of range. The one guy who had the bounty originally came back to attack me, I killed him. He was level 90 something. I got 1 cap for it. So basically, they are getting a high bounty so people will attack them and they will one shot their victims and claim whatever caps equal to their level. They keep one cap and have their friend hold the rest. This way they dont lose any caps. Then if he dies, he gets one cap back from his friend and comes back. This way he doesn't get the 50% debuff for being killed in PVP with no caps.
---
Regardless it's a bad idea when looked at from a wide scope. Leave fissure site prime where it is. Just make the other fissure sites worth nuking by adding bosses. That'd be so much easier for bethesda to do and it wouldn't exclude anyone who couldn't log in for that week. If you miss a boss then you're fucked on getting any of the special loot from it, and if they add new bosses they better drop stuff specific to that boss or whats the point of different bosses?
---
oh look more people with magical insight into bethesda's business plans. do you have an uncle that works for nintendo too?
---
Wel fuck that quest. I have 3 to go. 
---
Yesterday I finnally got them. Immediatly followed by "server disconnect". 
---
Didn't register. So I'm still looking. 
---
They won‚Äôt do it
---
It would mean to have an actual face for many to shift the blame on for all things bad in fallout 76...
---
Right now they are content with the brand taking the brunt of it all and have people forget about it all before creating the next hype for TES 
---
God forbid people use end game armor in end game.
---
Ohhh well...BETHEESSSDAAAA, I THINK THERE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE A BUG IN THIS GAAAYYAAAMME
---
Level 20? I think I got that unlock at like.... 160.
---
I have killed countless Assaultrons in the bunker and scrapped all their heads plus all of the level 24s in Watoga. I have no idea why it took me so long to get the helmet.
---
Honesty, just do a retro-futurism style restaurant where you play music from the 30‚Äôs-60‚Äôs without Fallout being involved. No need to alienate customers because they aren‚Äôt fans of a video game.
---
Its meant to be played with friends, that's for sure.
---
Sadly the min max "play games like a job"  angle is not coop friendly.
---
The superman punch.
---
No, this isn't WoW, but it is supposed to be an ever evolving online game. And you literally have 7 days to go kill said bosses, if you can't play 1 in 7 days maybe an mmofpsrpg isn't the one game you should be playing when you have time? Go play 4 if that's the case. 
---
It's probably better to nerf sentinel + assassin than fixing rad resist for normal armor users.
---
And for 1/100 the weight you can sell a golf outfit for 20 caps
---
Amazing 
---
Hey I'm just saying what I'm seeing and it makes sense. The game performed poorly and they need to attract more people to be able to purchase lunchboxes.
---
I'm willing to work around individual budgets, but this wasn't cheap. However, it is worth mentioning that the client insisted on the price.
---
It probably took 5-10 hours between two days to complete? 
---
no I mean I didn't even see an assaultron till lvl 20
---
I had the plan much earlier somehow 2x different robot helmet plans I'm certain I've had since lvl 1
---
The reload button doesn‚Äôt serve any function with a super sledge equipped. Just saying. 
---
Oh, like that. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks! üëç
---
Can see it already a giant mole miner boss
---
A Deathclaw broadmother  boss
---
A 10 feet tall 60 feet long radroach boss
---
A super behemoth boss 
---
A giant mirelurk king boss 
---
A blue screen boss as the final battle ;) 
---
have you tried asking her to, or trying to make it a party thing? you her and some friends make a new character and get drunk while taking turns roaming WV
---
Armchair developer?!  You sound like a Bungie employee :)
---
After implementing your suggestions they should change the name of the game to Destiny: Wastelands ;)
---
I definitely did not have the Assaultron Helmet at level 1.
---
Weird. :\
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
No ps4 :(
---
I get you feel frustrated for being talked down to. Don‚Äôt put me in a box with whoever did this. 
---
I‚Äôm just telling you what you‚Äôre likely to see more on consoles than on PC given the same game title, and what the root cause of that is (cost of ticket). 
---
I‚Äôm also telling you I have enough scar tissue to have my first person experience **strongly** corroborate this. 
---
Your personal opinions won‚Äôt change this fact. The console networks have a higher incidence of toxicity due to the less mature audience they‚Äôre targeted at and subsequently attract. 
---
Well, yeah. Even then, the amount stuff weights makes so sense. I mean, I can turn a double barrel Shotgun into a sawn off and that increases its weight somehow. The 10mm pistol and 10mm SMG can end up weighting the same even though one is clearly bigger and heavier.
---
I‚Äôve stumbled across graham once in 100 hours and he had nothing good on him. I‚Äôm suggesting something more accessible and rewarding. 
---
I grabbed fireproof 3 for them.
---
Drops their damage significantly.
---
 I will say when they go full auto it does feel buggy.
---
:( sorry man just saying not all games should be sweaty
---
At the very least, a ‚Äúbedroll‚Äù type option. Something that acts as a mobile camp with very limited stuff (sleeping bag an inventory craftable campfire, and a tent). You could choose to irreversibly use resources to craft a limited array of items ( couch, rug, basic traps) and when you pack up, it‚Äôs gone. all free of charge since it‚Äôs basically a hobo pack.
---
strange, I assumed it was a special edition thing 
---
/shrug
---
How many caps did this cost? 
---
There are sometimes Hazmats in the silos but I'd get one before you go. You can solo it for sure. Once you launch on the SBQ people will come. "Launch it, and they will come"
---
Wait, nvm that's last weeks codes! Sorry!!
---
Hey, there's a reason why Destiny had a pretty good player retention track record following The Taken King.
---
No, but there are lots of Hazmat Suits in the world. Visit the drop sites and you should find one.
---
When you launch the nuke players will join in to kill the queen. Scroll over the players on the map and try to find a server with at least a few 100+ players and hope for the best....
---
Or announce it here and see if redditors will help :)
---
Didn't think about that! Killing two birds with one stone. Good idea 
---
Also a good bit of the mines around the map and also Westek
---
&gt; mainly because being bored 
---
Sorry OP, there is no new content yet 
---
Will you be able to see other players on the map in that mode? 
---
Meh, i can clear harpers ferry and have enough rifles to clear out 3-4 vendors.
---
That takes 25-30 outfits
---
As someone who loves Fallout. I didn‚Äôt enjoy this game as much as others because there isn‚Äôt much content, and it‚Äôs so damn broken. The only pro this game has over FO4 is multiplayer.
---
I wear sentinel armor for 75% damage reduction and 40% player damage reduction, but I usually run nuke zones and farming in my X01 or Ultracite PA. Kinda what you have to do nowdays. 
---
I've found chameleon armour works! It doesn't switch off in photomode, so I've been taking nature snaps. Some creatures still aggro fairly easily - the deathclaw has a big detection range. Also, you can use the depth of field (? Whatever the first one is) slider as a zoom. 
---
I was paid 12,500 caps for my work. 
---
Goodbye
---
If there were legendary commie whackers and paddle balls this video I‚Äôm trying to make with all the meme weapons would be so easy
---
Pc? I saw that supply drop when I logged in. Must have been a few min late for the fight. So those belong to people? How do we get our own?

So the alternate is to make them essentially worthless?
---
Thanks for the Hookup, this dude is legit
---
i agree.. with such awesome features like party shared xp, lootable objects other than questitems in the world are on a per client basis, party scaled difficulty of areas... All those features that may incentivise group play and not actively hinder it in reload and ammocraft simulator 76. 
---
But back to reality. Of course it is more fun with friends. but you are playing with friends and the game then is more like a tool. Like when you give children a stick and they will have still fun playing with it. There is so little in this game that incentivises groupplay. A few perks (which is actually detrimental if you occasionally play solo) and maybe silos and the queen. Other than that you fight over kills and loot. So yes... The game provides a nice world to play in, but the fact you praise the combat system (which is arguably the weakest feature in the game, has massively imbalanced weapontypes, the AI is inapt at best, ttk either 1 or half a magazine, animationlocking left and right, idle to shoit time absurd etc) shows that you are not paying attention to the game itsself.

performed poorly according to who? the only people I have seen claiming it performed poorly are youtubers. any they tend to use reddit as their source. and game companies have a tendence to say a game "performed below expectations" like for example when COD only made $500 million instead of $550 million, but bethesda hasnt said it has done well or poorly. and frankly without actual info your spectualtion is just meaningless bullshit.
---
but oh right it went on sale so it must be selling poorly. *rolls eyes*
---
You‚Äôre in luck! They‚Äôre called ‚Äútattoos‚Äù and they let others know about your personality/identity/tastes/beliefs at a glance! 
---
I could come join in if you'd like. Just that I used all my ammo in my previous sesh so imma have to go and make more before hand
---
That was a delightful discovery. I was trying to think of how I could make a window work and I just happened to have the garage door selected to craft. It clipped to two walls and wouldn't you know it, it was green.

Get yourself some toxic goo
---
Others damage you with the actual bullet. Remember, TSE isn‚Äôt JUST an explosion.
---
We should get an inside the vault update this week so probably next week
---
That kills me, too. I love toxic goo. I've pretty much used that instead of stimpaks for the last month.
---
You aren't having the problem described in OP?

I think I have a medic 1* pump in storage, I‚Äôm on PC but I won‚Äôt be back on for about 20 hours.

I feel like this is what you would want for a towns idea anyway. This way not only are you in a consistent server, in theory so would your townsmates/server neighbors. This would allow you to get to know each other and encourage the story/factions we players are supposed to be organizing ourselves anyway. 
---
Yeah she's not keen. But I do things that I don't want to do all the time. It's called marriage haha! 
---
One day we'll get drunk and make a character (good suggestion). Then we'll see how things go. 
---
Hahaha! In what world do you think anybody would see these negative reviews, hear all this negative PR, and people would actually buy it? Do you have any reason to actually believe that other than you want it to be true?
---
And plastic
---
Mind letting me know where this is, would love to have a similar base 
---
I haven't had a crash since BETA on PC. Never had a freeze. Not even kidding.
---
I feel for everyone whose experience is spoiled by this, but i just cant wrap my head around some people not having any problems whatsoever, and others saying its pretty much unplayable.
---
Have you tried reinstalling, are your drivers in order? Maybe a full Windows reinstall (if you're on PC)? The latter does help your pc stay un good shape, and solves a lot of game problems in general.
---
Since idea posting, I have seen an average of 3-4 players in the last six sessions that are friendly, in the same world setting.  
---
I wish to reiterate that befriending others who post here, outside of myself is essential for the node to flourish.  That way the common group has a player base on a server or two by proxy of joining through social menus on the first friend you see.  
---
We very much need to make this a ‚Äúweb‚Äù of friends.
---
This has already been a noticeable change.  A positive change.  Lead to multiple teammates, and some good fun.
---
Once again, thank you like mind very much!

In the reactor rooms in the silos there are some.

I don‚Äôt believe that they are lazy, I think they might have just forgotten to take a full view of influences. The good influences felt when wandering this fallout are abundant. There‚Äôs just a couple they missed or didn‚Äôt even get to considering because they needed a player Voice to do that. Us
---
No, haven't expeirienced it. Sometimes the toxic goo won't give me rads but that's the only bug I've encountered. But usually taking some other form of 'aid' will reset the bug and make tge goo work. On PC btw.
---
Don't take this the wrong way but I play a maxed luck, pistol crit build and Harper's ferry is on my rotation of nightly runs and unless you can somehow fast travel while overloaded no possible way you are looting that many 15 pound rifles to sell out 4 vendors
---
Ppl are going to be pissed but like tse i expect a balance pass on it.
---
Ppl will cry but I'll take balance long term over power fantasies
---
Yeah, it going on sale to such a low price is a very good indicator. You're intentionally trying to look the other way and it's embarrassing. I'm going off something people can see, something that isn't normal, you're going off nothing.
---
I thought this was going to be a main mechanic from the start but oh well...
---
Might upset people here with this; I completed that quest in under 5 minutes.
---
It was very early days before it was a popular grind spot. (Probably 3-4 days after release). Doing the sword quest for mysteries when I wandered over to whitesprings there was just me &amp; some dude building a fortress on the greens. 
---
I just walked through once, killed ten unruly golfer ghouls without realy searching &amp; then went to get my sword. traded a heap of steel to the fortress builder - I remember this because it was his &amp; my first trade attempt in the game.
---
No I just play the game and see genuinely new players every day. Don't get your panties in a bunch.
---
Where did you find it?
---
I had this issue too, turns out I was out of steel/aluminum and on some weapons those don't show up as needed for the repair, but I guess you do still need them. 
---
What are nuke codes? Are they the things you get out of backpacks on ferals and scorched? I m no where near nuke codes, but I wander and get them all the time and they expire. Am I not supposed to take them? 
---
&gt;And the ~~apocalypse~~ game needs a few assholes.
---
Games played with other people never need *any* assholes. 
---
I don't understand continuing to attack random strangers camps when we all see how often people complain about it. 
---
Yeah, the "goo does nothing" bug is on PS4, too.
---
There has to be something new going on. I wiped my Herd Mentality mutation just in case the -1 or -2 to END was killing me but that didn't fix it.
---
I've just been killing random ghouls the past so I never noticed any of them were wearing actual golf outfits. I've actually managed to take out 7 so far. I think the constant nuking of Whitesprings might actually be screwing this one since all of the ghouls I killed that counted seemed to be lower level ones.
---
Yeah, SBs are getting on my nerves these last few days and it'd be nice to fight a boss without having to think of a dozen strategic combos to first get it to land before being able to hit it with my melee weapons.
---
You get the prototype hazmat suit, which is the same but yellow, from the side quest 'Tracking Unknowns'.  I've seen others, but this one is guaranteed I think.
---
Serum recipes?
---
Yeah well expect nerfs to everything. And expect people to quit in large numbers every time.
---
Isnt intended? Selling only walking cans since day 1 for me which makes totally sense in a golf Ressort. 
---
No worries brother. I recommend power armor for a nuke site if you‚Äôre on your own. The 8+ is for scorch beast queen. If you solo then drop it on White springs or Monaghan
---
I‚Äôd help you get a set together and help you through the process, but console still lives in a separate but equal world. 
---
Going off nothing? I am not the one claiming, falsely, that the game is going free to play.
---
what embarrassing is people so desperate to hate a game they make up bullshit to suit their narrative.
---
We do not.  I would certainly join such a thing.  Would you like to start it?  I am indifferent towards ownership or entitlement with the group.  I want the group to self sustain though, and this is a good way to help.  
---
If you don‚Äôt, I will.  Let me know
---
MortisCorpus

Yeah nothing helps this it hurts me too fast traveling or anything else doesn‚Äôt work but hey you can still emote

I mean this is literal immortality, why wouldn't they nerf that....

Smells fishy

You can. It‚Äôs tedious work to figure it out for yourself, but there are some guys that post weekly nuke codes online.

As long as it doesn't get the TSE treatment. The best gear should make you a literal tank bullet sponge.

They‚Äôre well made bait. Don‚Äôt carry any junk if you plan on capping. 
---
I‚Äôve set these bad boys down and nobody ever expects the grand smackdown of my bone club.
---
The point is per pound clothing sells for much more with zero special commitment.  So happy you can do your thing in Harper's ferry, it does not change the fact that clothing is a much better item to sell.
---
Excavator PA with calibrated shocks. 
---
Puts me to 120/415.
---
My play sessions start by hitting harpers + watoga for 3 vendors, over to the ski area for more guns to do whitespring/enclave/responder/raider. 
---
I get my 1400 caps in about 30mins.
---
Sometimes i hit fort defiance instead and hope for scorched. Their guns + straight jackets are faster.
---
An even bigger behemoth than that would be a cool boss!
---
I know some one who sells them tho 
---
Why are you here?
---
Wasn‚Äôt knocking the ideas.  They‚Äôre tried and true, even if a bit old.  Shame D2 couldn‚Äôt live up to the hype that Taken King built.
---
VATS is your friend in that one.
---
Servers are wait to flakey to have more room.
---
Best to change behaviour at this point
---
I made 3 posts on this earlier, I gave up.
---
Is sea of thieves that good now? I played it right before launch and meh'd out. My first experience was a 12 year old (guessing here by the voice and seemingly very limited knowledge about sexual things ironically) locking me in the brig and explaining all the ways he'd violate my body after I drowned. Like I said he was like 12 so "all the ways" was just yelling a couple of ways repeatedly. Admittedly pretty funny, but then my second experience was sailing a ship alone for a while, finally getting some treasure, having two people join and lock me in the brig, and then immediately crash the ship. Lmao. 
---
Good stuff.
---
I said it's likely, not definitely that's it's going F2P. And again, that's off the fact that copies are being pulls from stores. It's not 100%, but it definitely lends credence to the idea. But hey maybe blind faith is more accurate, according to you.
---
Scheme
---
Kids today. Back in my day the stash was only for 400lbs. Kappa
---
I liked the part about the .308 receiver on combat rifle. They must have forgotten to copy and paste it in from FO4. 
---
I‚Äôve always said (from the stash limit was 400) leave it, but have 2 stashes, one at 400 and no one can get into that just like we have now and the other unlimited but players can lock pick it and steal from it, would be worth trying to hide/defend your base 
---
If the camp edges were SQUARE instead of circular, this could already be a thing. 
---
The key to doing this quest is to have a lowerlevel friend (0-35ish) and go there. I was leveling up a new character at whitesprings and they would spawn all the time as long as I was the only or first one there. Have your friend trigger the spawns and walk in after to clean them up.
---
Still does not change the fact that clothing sells for 10+* that much.  So, you could spend 30 mins per night every night for 10 days = 5 hours.  I do one 30 min clothing run for 1/100 the weight and don't have to do anything for another 10 days saving more than 4 hours of time.
---
I'm on PC. I've had my share of nice encounters, but I've also had more than a few bad encounters. The only real PVP I've done in game was due to my accidental shooting of another player with my tesla rifle as I tried to help him fight off some super mutants. He killed me and called me some names, and from then on I kept pacifist mode on so I didn't do it again. The only people who have ever shot at me after that were using exploits that one shot me while I was in pacifist mode. That has happened 3 times so far, and one of them then proceeded to tea-bag my corpse and destroy my camp. Most of my other interactions with other players consisted of my trying to gift a new player a bunch of items only to be ignored. Why does no one ever have a mic? And why do the people I follow around act like they have no brain and no idea how to accomplish the most mundane of tasks, like walk somewhere without stopping and going idle for ridiculous strokes of time?
---
I finally got two of them the other day.  Only eight more to go....  It'll probably end up being the last thing that I do...   and, given my luck, that's when a TSE will finally drop for me...
---
Dyers chem plant has tonnez of them.
---
Same with west tek 
---
Stupid people are easily led. They read here how people ‚Äúfight the duper scum‚Äù  then they want to be cool too. Then they post. Then the next person  jumps in. Ad nauseum 
---
Nope, playing right now
---
They're new, so I cut them a little slack with lingo. Besides we're all looking to have a good time, so the quicker they can figure out stuff the better for everyone playing.
---
Yes! *We're trying to rebuild America, not build a camp.* This could become an entire content update. It would be cool to build your own town and become a mayor, or a dictator. Maybe we could finally get human NPC settlers (improved from Fallout 4, please.) coming from outside Appalachia to settle in and other players living together influenced by the Sim Settlements mod or Cities: Skyline. You could set taxes, build an economy, place plots for people/NPCs to build in, If you're trying to join a server and a town is built on the same place as yours there would be an alert that your town couldn't be placed so you would get the option to hop in a different server. 
---
Damn. 
---
Heck, I‚Äôd take 1-5. Better than dropping them on the ground.
---
Play a different game and feel better man.  Also as a current active duty soldier... veteren title really adds no weight to your complaints, though i  can't help but feel you specifically created this account thinking it will... TYFYS
---
Pretty much the same here.  I'm on PC and only play late at night, but in over 2 months of playing have only run into 3 jerks and it was nothing more than minor inconveniences like the guy who purposely killed my low level alt by exploding the cars around me to try and take my scrap when I died.  Joke's on him, I wasn't carrying any junk or scrap and I was about to fast travel anyway lol
---
X-01 plans (parts and mods) are not available in the game. You learn X-01 parts from a terminal, and you must purchase X-01 mods.
---
There is no alternative
---
If the legendaries are supposed to be worth more, the cap limit of vendors need to be higher - simple no nonsense logic 
---
So besides the player seed I theorize, there seems to be a "Server" modifier to that, many people have reported seeing multiple (like 8+) of the same prefix (Anti-Armor for example), or every other drop being One Prefix or the other.  
---
About 2 weeks ago I looted 8 Anti-Armor Weapons in a row, and over half of the legendaries from that WhiteSprings were Nocturnal armor...  
---
I mean it's possible to hit those streaks, but I find it unlikely.
---
That's some powerful delusion there friend.  Almost all the assets in the game, at least 90%, are directly ported from fallout 4 and the world is very large but basically empty.  There is not a single dialog choice in the game.  No npc interactions whatsoever, and no actual story
---
I got kicked,  but turned it off. Idk 
---
Its not even likely. do you know why that one store in austraila pulled the base game? (you can still buy the special editions) no you dont. ignore the fact that the site that we being linked around here as evidence was claiming amazon only had 28 copies (more falsehoods) and you have just more clickbait speculation claiming doom and gloom with nothing to back it up but wishful thinking and blind hate. You want the game to fail so much you act like it going f2p is already decided when there is no evidence it is even being considered.
---
But it still doesnt make sense for power attack to not only share a button with grenades, but not share a button with melee. Like one tap, light attack. Hold, power attack.
---
If I am carrying a hand-made my system crashes when I am scrapping other weapons.  This is on the PS4.  
---
I've had to store or scrap everyone one that I have found just for this reason.  Once it's been stored or scrapped, my system goes back to the more normal 2 to 3 hour crashes/disconnects.
---
The ones in the reactor only require lvl 1 to wear so they‚Äôre great to give to newbies too as they don‚Äôt carry the lvl 15 requirement some of the others above ground have. 
---
maybe. But during that process the game stops working with no alternative in sight yet
---
A full set of raider armor gives you a 100% boost of being in a hard place
---
Yeah... I have to wait for at least 3 minutes until it's safe to open the quick-boy.
---
I‚Äôm on mostly every day and really don‚Äôt have much to do anymore except farm stuff, my GT is Eingeborenen 
---
Are we talking about the same enemies here? Did you fighting glowing ones over 50 in springs with your AR?
---
Without the "Waiting" you just described ever game I've ever played on Fallout lol
---
t
---
They've not spawned for me before. I usually pick them up and drop them around flatwoods
---
Yeah ok.
---
You're telling me you found a route where you get 30-40 outfits in 30mins?
---
The golf club spawns 3 upstairs, 3 downstairs.
---
1-2 more in the side buildings.
---
Where are the other 30?
---
is there a difference between 'fissure sites' and 'fissure site prime'? Im a somewhat newish player (lvl 19) and recently walked to the Greenbriar (or what they call in the game as Whitesprings or something) and discovered a new map marker with a rupture in the road with green stuff coming out called a Fissure Site. I kinda ran away from the site as there were some high level ghouls nearby that i didn't want to waste ammo with and then some lvl 50 flying thing started shooting green stuff at me. Not sure if that was connected wth the fissure site or not, I got the hell out of there.
---
What are the sites and what purpose do they serve? Is something supposed to happen when you visit them?
---
The year is 2287, the Institute has lost many synth to the Railroad and the  Brotherhood of Steel. Isolated deep below the surface, the Institute is mostly shielded from what is occurring above, but they're always watching. Father has grown tired of the surface dwellers fighting each other and killing his creations as a result. Institute historians present a radical solution. In 2102, a group of survivors  emerged from Vault 76 and banded together to end the plague of the Scorched.... What if they could bring the Scorched to the Commonwealth? No more Brotherhood! No more Railroad! No more humans! A world where synth would thrive! 
---
The Institute scientists discovered a method to send a synth back to the year 2102, however recovery was not possible. Which ever synth would be sent to 2102 would need to survive until it could locate the founders of the Institute 8 years later.
---
A new prototype unit was created based on defense technology discovered many years prior in the ruins of a West Tek facility. The unit was named the WestTek Observance and Operations Bot: Revision Y... Codename W.O.O.B.Y.
---
The W.O.O.B.Y. was sent back to Appalachia 2102 to retrieve data and samples that could be used by the Institute to attempt to revive the Scorched. 
---
In order to avoid discovery of his true identity and mission, W.O.O.B.Y. assisted the former vault dwellers in the retrieval of items that would mysteriously go missing when their world would do strange things like revert by 10 minutes and just vanish and reappear.
---
Unfortunately W.O.O.B.Y. was destroyed by a nuke at the former Whitespring resort while attempting to assist a former vault dweller in recovering a lost 2 shot exploding weapon. The Institute was never able to recover the data that was collected on the Scorched and was ultimately destroyed by humans.
---
And now that he has a story... Bethesda developers can give their support people the ability to bring Wooby into a world after having him stop by the Dev room to pick up items that were eaten by the game/lost by a player and kindly have Wooby return what was lost.
---
Wooby is the NPC we need and the one we deserve.
---
Sure, but there's gotta be a better way to do it than holding down a button that's tied to a different action on press.
---
Going to take a wild guess and say he lives in Richmond.
---
I have the same problem.  Every now and then I have to go on a plastic hunt so I can bulk all my scrap to sell.  No reason to have 300 ceramic or 600 cloth.  Even steel can go, as it's so common.  I try to keep about 100 of each material unless it's something I use a lot(steel, screws, plastic, leather, etc.) and clear out the excess.  It usually frees up about 100 lbs. of space.  
---
Chems/Aid is the other big one.  Stimpacks weigh 1 each in your stash.    Not having them sucks, but they take up a lot of space.  Radaway is essential, a few rad x but unless you use them regularly there is no reason to keep psycho and bufftats in your stash.  I have 2 of each chem, not sure why I even keep 2.  Bobbleheads, Magazines, grenades, mines all add up too; you can always find more.
---
I‚Äôll get Mothman and Mole Miner, and probably the Radtoad, but come on... where‚Äôs my supersized bat boy? You can‚Äôt leave out THE iconic enemy from this game, Scorchbeasts.
---
Grahm would also be sweet, and they could give us a Scorched. 
---
You're right about it being the endgame.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/QmXJRA5
---
Already scrapped it and started over.
---
Yeah but at least a better way to manage inventory 
---
Best thing to collect to sell is flux. Takes about 100-120 total flux of any kind to max out all 7 vendors if you have the merchant card equipped. So basically just do one nuke zone a day and you can get 1400 caps a day without much effort.
---
Good sign it's legit.
---
Dang, I don't understand what happened. No amount of trying to reset it is getting us back into the game.
---
Any place with a lot of cafeteria trays (not the dinner trays) or plastic pumpkins.  Also, look for dog and cat bowls, enamel buckets, and brooms.  You can usually find plastic plates at any of the outdoor responder camps.
---
Lmfao that is great, it surely mustve been a struggle to get a grip on that sweaty controller to fire back in retaliation only to have it keep slipping out of your grasp. 
---
I usually use the drop function to give people things over the trade menu given that the trade menu is cluttered and wildly inefficient.
---
I‚Äôm really surprised that you‚Äôre convinced that only cheaters drop things for people and put things in containers, otherwise this would be a huge annoyance for everyone.
---
I'm about to give up, it's a shame all that flux is going to go to waste though.
---
Additional important perk card UI update idea
---
i want the UI to be upgraded so we can put a card in the trash, making it disappear from the swap field so we have to go retrieve it from there if we decide we want to actually use it sometimes (back burner - extremely handy for almost all organizational riddles), re order them, and most importantly keep the level smaller versions of the cards we decided to get an upgraded rank (we just use that hide feature if we don't currently have a need to equip the lower level card in the build). This would mean selecting a duplicate card would automatically cause the 2nd one to appear at the next power level up, and so now I still own two cards, just one of them is 1, the next time I choose it, 2, onward.
---
Card / power level design further contemplated---- I recently realized that I don't need the 2 level of barbarian at 30 STR in unyielding armor because the max DR is 60. I only needed the 1, adding 2 DR per STR point. The fact is I will have to select it a 3rd time now to own 1 and 2. The design here works out that a lot of builds take basic, expert, and master at the 1 strength, just as it is for lockpick and hack, they don't spend 6 more card choices to go up another 10% per card, although that is the way to get the highest specialized damage for one weaponry type, not every single one works this way. Explosives for grenades and rocket launcher or fatman is 5 points and I get double, not just +60%. I think basic, expert, master 1 point in each makes the highest sense than 3 levels of each or a single card with up to 5. **This is where my feedback comes from.**
---
Now THAT'S some choice information...Very useful! Did you make your own and scrap them, or use things you found???
---
It was a bit disappointing to discover Phoenix in Watoga after the Mayor for a Day quest. He would ‚Äòve been handy in those fights with robots.
---
nah. Given Bethesdas current fiddling with the nerfs I sincerely doubt they would be capable of thinking more far ahead. Expect a full TSE nerf breaking all builds but the melees. Afterwards the anti fun police will find something new to nerf 
---
Can‚Äôt fix what they don‚Äôt think is broken.
---
Usually you can just hop back into the game though, more than likely a teammate is still on the server with a regular disconnect. This is like the whole thing went dead and now we can't get into any of them.
---
Ok I'll add you now. Feel free to join me anytime. I'm usually playing solo
---
Its a legendary effect that gives you +3 on everything per piece, which combined is +15 on everything but the catch is that you need low health for it to take effect. My under armor also gives +3 on STR. Thats 18 STR im loosing while wearing PA.
---
My GT is SoundlessAxis7 btw
---
That's sad. My husband and I have been playing since launch. Although we're slowing down a bit now, we're not at the quitting point yet. Hundreds of hours of fun and counting. 
---
For the wendigo one, the one inside the cave also works
---
I hold Tons of giveaways, I said it's a price we would have to pay. 
---
Hahaha i had the same trouble first time doing it, It amazes me how low security and background checks were pre war. my guy walks in it with a rocket launcher,fatman, and small machine gun, biometric scanner issues me full keycard access to all parts of a highly combustible facility.  
---
Legit giveaway guys! 
---
The Fissure Prime is a special fissure important to the story. Don't worry about it too much, you'll learn all about it ;) 
---
Sounds like they popped a bunch of duped bobbleheads and one shot her. It's a thing people do now
---
I think you have not been reading my posts.  If "my outfits" sell for 30 and your guns sell for 60 but my outfits weight .1 and your guns weigh 10 who is maximizing effort and time?
---
I started making healing salve instead of using stimpaks. It‚Äôs lighter, works just as good with the right perks, and you can make a ton of it in less than an hour.
---
I hate people. Fun suckers
---
I feel your pain. I'm a history major, planing to become a teacher, and I screwed up the "Who was the 18th president?" question on the Enclave questionnaire. 
---
Its really is
---
Yay game breaking exploits. 
---
And FYI it's not just golf clothes that was a example...
---
They should add a large workshop area in the game that has no ownership and anyone can build in. While it's not permanent because its tied to the server, if they made it a free fast travel location everyone will pass through there from time to time.
---
Things people build will still have ownership to the maker so players cant mess with other players structures in this open workshop.
---
Ok but there was nothing running around
---
I had to rest the whole computer yesterday because of this. For the life of me nothing would let me close the program down.  
---
I feel you pain, and don''t have answers either.............you're not alone though.
---
This seems pointless. Ruin a feature just to catch a small minority of players?
---
Destroy the tree because  a few bad apples fell from it?
---
Couldn‚Äôt you just find them and not worry about cutting features?
---
Gonna look into this.  Thanks!

Once somebody is able to actually get something on her body to spawn leave something that says the word Scorch beast in there, like a piece of meat or the Scorch Beast brain. That way when you're looking through meat piles when she despawns it's very easy to know which one the scorch Beast is. It's the one with this Scorch Beast brain in it
---
Yeah I guess, I play alone though. It just takes so long though :-)
---
The point of the feature isn't to catch them, It's to get rid of duping so when we introduce higher level stuff the market doesn't get ruined again. 
---
I think with the addition of text chat, which should be integrated with the pipboy UI in a way, that you could add those symbols beside a character's name in the chat list.  Instead of crowding them around someone's name. It would help cut down on screen clutter to look at if you're in group events with a lot of people. Another option is adding in a bit of a nametag/profile you can access for people via chat when you click on their name to look at their profile, and then you can see their gameplay interests on there
---
What? Dude all the methods are patched besides about 2 that get you instabanned.
---
Uh your math is bullshit?
---
10 days of caps is 14k. That will take 460 outfits at 30 caps.
---
You said you can do that in 30mins.
---
Prove it
---
If you're thinking about the One Man Army perk for heavy guns, it's a chance to inflict stagger, not cripple. Still useful, but different. 
---
Unyielding armor? Calibrated shocks on your pa?
---
Wait really? 
---
I went to Whitesprings the other day and the only ghouls that spawned were golfer ghouls.
---
Same experience on xbox 
---
i‚Äôve noticed it too, i have max strenght so i thought the carry weight would stay where it is but nah. i have radicool equipped at all times so i thought maybe that changes it as you get rads but i never realize to pay attention to my carry weight like that to be sure
---
I'd love for a doc to be that Kovacs crashes and it's just stores full of dog food and shitty Chen's. Well that's all they seem to give me.
---
Trust me, we already have a blue screen boss :/
---
My wife has never played video games, but enjoys FO76. She likes the scavenging aspect, and will just roam the map looking for cool stuff and good places to set up camp. She plays GTA 5 too, driving around as Trevor wearing only work boots and underwear while breaking real estate signs hooked her. I‚Äôm also pretty sure she shed a tear when Arthur Morgan died üòÇ.
---
Put me down in the "I don't get why people buy this deformed crap on purpose" camp.  
---
Still can‚Äôt find a way to beat him üòÇ
---
Yep people suck.
---
I plan on running a store once player vending is implemented. I have about 15 of every Aid item in my Stash. I'm definitely going to need a cap increase. 
---
Why did someone down vote me lol "oh damn, I let the secret out" lol
---
This is dumb.  Sorry just my opinion.
---
Nope, just regular old excavator pa.
---
There's not much difference, unless you nuke them. Fissure Site Prime is the only spot on the map that will spawn the Scorch Beast Queen, the final boss of the game, when nuked. Nuke anywhere else, including the other fissure sites, it just irradiates everything. 
---
For real? Yesterday was the first time I took a peek at Whitespring and I saw some ghoul golfers. If I knew they were a big deal I definitely would've killed them.
---
30 minutes!  Would you like to have dinner and take the dog for a walk after you killed it?
---
Yea. Barely anyone dupes anymore. Most ‚Äúdupers‚Äù you see just stockpiled their weapons before the last patch.
---
They‚Äôre trying to cover their tracks at this point. If you want to stop that, go ahead but this isn‚Äôt the right way to seek them out. Why remove a critical feature when you don‚Äôt have to?
---
If you walk the river between overseers camp and Flatwoods, you‚Äôll find a ton of blood leaf. Then just come back up on the banks a bit and there‚Äôs sootflower everywhere. I think I made 40 tonight in about half an hour.
---
Real talk, if Assaultrons went to higher levels they'd be hard counters to a lot of explosive weapons.  
---
There are a lot of locales where they'd be very setting-appropriate and could take advantage of mixed range options to penetrate the envelope for explosives. They already can kind of do that now. 
---
The invisible ones make this synergize even better. If their AI weren't generally exploitable in other ways it would be a cool in universe balancer. 
---
I think they would rather leave it how it is since it's tied to the story, besides, not much will come from nuking other fissures anyways other than a difference in scenery. What they need to do is to give incentive to nuking other locations other than Whitesprings and Fissure sites, like adding unique bosses with actual fighting mechanics that isn't just mindlessly shooting down an enemy. I hope their future content isn't similar to fighting a Scorchbeasts.
---
I nuked the NW corner of map, the golf course up there.   About same, no mobs, few flora.
---
Like I said, make it a lockbox that only YOU can get OR someone with a very high lockpicking skill. The act of taking your junk will count as stealing which will make them wanted on the server which will create an element of risk for both parties: On the part of the dead guy who might lose their junk to a thief and the thief who'll risk getting hunted down just for stealing your crummy junk.
---
will i eventually learn where all the humans have gone?
---
I repeat my previous comment. 
---
I.
---
Hate. 
---
People. 
---
You're ruining the damn game for those of us who actually like grinding!
---
Power armor is already legendary.  I urge you to grab a set of leather/ combat or whatever level 50 modded however you like and go do your normal adventuring.  Come back and let's chat about adding legendary power armor.
---
hey sparky.  if i could only have extra character slots i'd make a sword wielding one strength knight who wears power armor only.  i was thinking with just one perk available for a sword build which would be the one to pick.  probably pain train.  so he'd probably pick any feat that would maintain his power armor.  so lots of intelligence.
---
also would like to make a pipe gun specialist.  can't decide if it'd be better to go pistol or rifle.  
---
i did make one character with all carrying perks.  he has done suprisingly well.  probably his tesla rifle, allowing him to hit everything at once.
---
presently my characters are - non automatic pistol build, non automatic rifle build, two handed melee, unarmed melee, carryall.
---
i have still never used a harpoon gun, broadsider, flint rifle or pistol, any medic stuff.  
---
i also read where one guy never fast travelled so was wondering what a build would be like that specialized in always being over encumbered.  
---
Even just the variety would be worth it. I've fought the SBQ less than a dozen times and I'm already sick of her, but don't have all the loot I want. If I could go kill something else to get prime plans and serum recipes, I would.
---
From my understanding, its a bug in which if you log into the game while still wearing your excavator power armor, it gives an extra 100 carry weight  to your character but goes away as soon as you leave your power and reenter it, could be because of that it seems.
---
For how much? Which ones?
---
I have a full set of 2/3* unyielding combat armor. In power armor I'm just a bullet sponge that's not special. 
---
Just going off rumors here really.   I know bobbleheads are duped because of the broken stacking; not sure if this stacking issue was fixed in the last patch or not.
---
Wait, how am I ruining the game? All I did was post on reddit. I literally haven't even logged into fo76 ine over two weeks.
---
Unless this is some kind of sarcastic thing. In that case, I hate you too... I think
---
I like shooting the legs off  the protectrons around Watoga from stealth. The way they drag themselves around afterwards makes me giggle. 
---
Remember that calling somebody a ‚Äúduper‚Äù gives them quite the stigma as well. There are two sides to this situation.
---
Id like to see a portable camp option, free to move but budget space is much smaller(like 10% of the normal camp budget). Main purpose is to settle down somewhere quickly to scrap, craft, sleep and even set up a small shop. 
---
I would go as far as to not allow normal house structures and only allow tents for shelter in these camps.
---
I've also had some luck in just circling the thing.  Usually you can find one pixel that will let you pick it up.  Same thing happens when I drop a scortched into one of the mining holes.
---
And, yes, if all else fails, try dropping a genade or any explosive and it should go flying.
---
That is a simple yet great idea. 
---
Maybe they could even move the fissure sites around the map throughout the week to trigger the events and spawn the enemies types of whatever area they are in such as:
---
# Mole miners and the large bug things (i forgot their names) at the ash heap
---
# Super mutants, hounds and behemoths at the fissure sites south of the great divide
---
# Mirlurks and Anglers at the fissure site at the mire
---
# Deathclaws and mega sloths at the Cranberry blogs discuss (not the prime site)
---
# Super mutants and wedingos at the fissure site near whitesprings (so we dont need to actually nuke white springs)
---
etc etc
---
Then when they do the prime site at the end of the week it spawns an all out frenzy of all enemy types like it current does.
---
Really I am just excited to see a nuke anywhere but the prime or whitesprings to mix things up a bit (secretly i do enjoy a good whitespings nuke zone though ;)   ).
---
The sarchasm is deep
---
Lmao not unless you drag them to the far southern border before you can kill them. P.s. There's a junk site right on the other side of the wall. 
---
I'm assuming all the intelligent Enclave members voted against Eckhart in his initial coup. The Enclave I know would never have unleashed the Scorch Beasts without some plan on how to control them. We want to rule the world, after all; the scorched plague is as much an impediment to us as it is to everyone else.
---
Good luck sunshine. :*
---
What? Who is talking down to me? I said I play on PC and console, and have done so for many years. So I‚Äôm not sure what your going on about here. Between this and your 12 year olds don‚Äôt have IT jobs comment, I‚Äôm beginning to think your making some not so subtle jabs at me. But surely you wouldn‚Äôt be doing that in a discussion about gamer maturity while speaking on behalf of PC players. I must be reading it wrong.
---
I don‚Äôt participate in this PC vs console bs, I just observe the arguments and have made note that the more aggressive and toxic comments seem to come from PC gamers. Usually its along the lines of ‚Äúconsoles are for kids and casuals, all hail the pc master race‚Äù and other nonsense with some colorful language inserted. 
---
You tell me my personal opinions based on my experiences don‚Äôt matter, then use your own personal opinions and experiences as part of your argument. What?
---
You cannot provide anything remotely resembling evidence that the majority of toxicity on consoles is done by children, or that overall toxicity is higher on one platform over the other to a degree that would be noticeable. If you have actual facts to support this then I would love to see them. If not, your just stating your opinion based on personal experience, same as me. I‚Äôm just not presenting mine as fact.
---
What is a fact, is that more online PC games have a global text chat than console games. So rather than being subjected to just the toxicity of those within mic range, you get all sorts of lovely text randomly coming in while your trying to discuss the game or find a group. 
---
Another fact is that PC games are much easier for people to cheat/hack and therefore ruin the experience of others. Clearly this needs to be taken into consideration when we are talking about toxicity and maturity of a player base.
---
But hey, if you want to believe that every online console game is infected with obnoxious little kids then go ahead. As someone who has played console games online since fairly close to when they were first available I am going to have to disagree. 
---
Seen hundreds now. Wait until a low level moves into the area. Teleport over and 80% of the time the clubhouse is full of them. 
---
I am trying really hard to grasp wtf is wrong with you. You post on reddit asking for an explanation to your issue, I post what most likely is happening, and somehow that makes me the one that's ruining this game... The fuck are you on? Get some help kid. Go outside or something.
---
Actually, don't. It's cold as fuck in most of the states. Don't go outside. 
---
All these suggestion posts tend to feel like "no duh" or silly and useless ideas. This is a really good idea I haven't heard a thousand times already.
---
Can't you just hop servers to stop "raiders" from getting your camp?  If so, how does that fit into the "living world Bethesda is trying to create"?
---
Congrats on first Place!
---
You get bombarded in the face by a never ending echo attack by a large mutant flying bat until you die... and also discover a new location on the map.
---
That's about it :P
---
Fissure site are used in game to spawn Scorch Beasts. The prime site is where the queen spawns from if it is nuked.
---
Congrats on 2nd Place!
---
Somebody would nuke you though.
---
Oh I found alot of those guys at early levels.
---
Add a chance for a random fissure site to deploy a raid boss every time a nuke is dropped. The fissures are a giant underground network probably filled with all kinds of wild creatures. Nukes being dropped have a chance to disturb one of the larger ones from their nest. Or have them randomly spawn a dungeon, so you can go in and purge the nest with a group. 
---
The game in it's current state is severely lacking on quality group content. 
---
So kinda like a lootbox BETA?
---
If speaking about 1 hit from TSE and 1 hit from Super Sledge, then sure.
---
However, when comparing damage per second, the TSE handmade will far outdamage the Supersledge.    Speed of attack from sledge is quite slow.  The speed of Handmade can be put to Auto.   Even on Semi-Auto, you can easily shoot 3 times in the time it takes to swing once with SS.  I have a handmade (non-legendary) and play with friend all the time who has SS.   I can easily out-damage his damage with a normal handmade and he has Legendary SS.     One, he has to get over to the mob, which I can take 1 or 2 shots before that happens.  Two, I can get 3 shots in before he can swing a second time.  By then the mob is dead.   This is without TSE.
---
Even before the Handmade is already OP (Rate of fire, high dmg), adding the TSE makes it way overpowered.
---
If you said TSE on slow rate pipe-pistol? That would not be as bad.
---
Fantastic seller with some real rare items. 
---
Me generation wondering if there really is a world out there.
---
Please remember, this wasn't the Enclave. This was Eckhart and his cronies, who killed most of the inhabitants of the bunker in order to take control. Eckhart and his group were traitors. The Enclave would never have approved mutating it's troops, or releasing the Scorch Beasts without a way to control them. 
---
We're evil, not idiots.
---
Thank you for your kind words!
---
People probably aren‚Äôt interested because of the systems. The systems actively handicap the aggressor in most situations making engaging in PVP a net loss for them. 
---
I‚Äôm not complaining, it‚Äôs a lot better than lawless wastelands like GTA:O where some guy on a hover bike blows me up because I had the audacity to go off-roading in the truck I just bought without thinking to enable passive. But it‚Äôs like saying you don‚Äôt need guide rails along a cliff side roadway because no one has gone off it while the guide rails are in place and actively keeping people on track. 
---
Launched solo (LV 91) last week to clear my mission list. Server cut out half way through the first attempt. But I was invested. Ran out of ammo, broke 2 melee and was reduced rifle butt bashing the turrets. Issue was I had nothing left to enjoy the fruits of my labour with no stimpacks or Radaway. Just make sure you have enough resources to clear, launch and fight in the blast zone. 
---
interesting. I def saw that large flying mutant thing and luckily ran away from it and evaded it. 
---
I don't think i've seen a Scorch Beast yet. I have seen plenty of scorched ghouls but not sure about these 'scorch beasts'. 
---
Reddit is a place for discussion for all types.   Not for the ones who think only their views are the right ones.
---
The best gift to low players is ice cold cash. Let us sell, B! Lol
---
\*put it directly next to Vault 76 exit\*
---
All perks stop gaining increases at 10.  After that you are only adding points to use more cards. 
---
Witchcraft! I‚Äôve had that quest open since like level 12, never did get them to spawn.
---
Having one can get you banned - from what I heard 
---
That‚Äôs stupid
---
No, but with how long her inventory takes to load, I might have too.
---
Ok, I‚Äôm about level 140. I‚Äôm trying to make a video in which I kill players with meme weapons (rolling pins, bone clubs, commie whackers). I‚Äôm looking for bodyguards (and hopefully test subjects), but mostly people to laugh with or give some of my guns to.
---
GT is Scorpion278
---
I‚Äôm on at varying times. Weekends are good.
---
I seemed to have figured out how to minimize my blue screening on my PS4 Pro in the White Springs and Watoga areas. When playing with my little bro and my bf, I realized I was blue screening 10 to 1 over them. The difference is they have original PS4s. It didn't occur to me until I fast traveled to a white Springs Resort and had all the texures look like early PSX models for around 15 seconds before it blue screened that it might be a rendering or memory issue with 4K. So I switched my Pro to 1080p and I 
---
haven't had a blue screen in several hours. This may not seem like much, but I was have 2+ blue screens per hour minimum.
---
This isn't ideal since the point of a pro and a 4K tv and all, but it's working for me for the time being until they can fix this hot mess of a game.
---
If you follow through the story, yes. There‚Äôs a lot of lore hidden around the map so be on the lookout for holotapes and notes. Also take the time to read the terminals. 
---
It does scrap it back its uses scrap before bulk your fine to bulk it also saves weight
---
Right!
---
In addition to what others have said, toys and sports equipment are super plentiful at the fairgrounds. I was using Camden, but rolled a new crafter toon who I planned to keep in the forest region, and lo and behold found the NW fair grounds right beside the Dirt track workshop. Every game stall there has either baseballs, basketballs, or golf balls. Each also has tons of toy 'prizes' where the carny would be running the stall from.
---
Buttresses!!! 
---
This man has reached a higher level of thinking.
---
"mumblemumble... profits... mumblemumble..." \*checks the ticker tape\*
---
Tha makes sense.
---
Bulking is done like crafting. For Lead for example, you bulk 20 at a time, and it requires 2 plastic to do so. 
---
Once all raw scrap is used up, it will draw from your bulk. Bulking most materials doesn‚Äôt save any weight (except for whatever plastic is used) but for Aluminum and Lead it does. 
---
It‚Äôs also the only way certain items can be sold to vendors. 
---
Like I said...go out with a normal set of armor (modded however you like) - not legendary, compared to power armor.  Normal armor needs balancing before any legendary power armor.
---
yes, and at lvl 19 you should already partly have, if you listened to what is happening in your quests.
---
Phenix, the answer is password.
---
Shame that if retailers are cutting that much shows that it must be selling really badly. Still seeing plenty of low levels joining servers, but wonder how many are staying? Also wonder what the active player base is on PC and both consoles?
---
You have to make it her own idea to play fallout 76
---
But this suggestion borders into psychology 
---
If you want to sell it you have to bulk for vendors and most people prefer to buy their junk in bulk form since the lowest cap you can set is 1 and no one will buy junk for 1cap a piece instead they will buy a bulk for like 10 making it .5 caps each or whatever definitely bulk all junk for sure sell the worthless stuff to vendors and keep the more sought after stuff for players to trade  
---
The flying mutant thing is the scorch beast
---
One thing that might help is train station have stash boxes.
---
So you could stash a bunch and sell as you go.
---
1800 is a ball buster though. 
---
Personally I'd just drop it. 
---
Yes, the problem is the scaling up of the SBQ when low level players come and cannot add anything to the fight.   I think the reason why she got scale though was because she died so very quickly before.   I do not know every build/situation, but a good reason why she died so quickly was the TSE.  But now the issue is the scaling when low level players want to get the end game loot.   
---
I watched a level 40 come into the event at the beginning and then noticed the player not around fighting.   Then at the end, the level 40 showed up again.  Most likely they were in the trenches or treeline hiding.  They only had to shoot 1 time.
---
1) They need to implement a minimum damage threshold on the Queen so you have to do x amount of damage just to qualify to get loot/xp.  
---
2) Also make it so anyone less than 50 does less dmg to the queen.
---
3) Then all the need to do is make it so anyone under 50 does not count toward the queen scaling.
---
Daily I think. Server hopping is not supposed to cause a reset (some guys were doing so to farm certain items on every server, so Bethesda made it so items that have been recently looted don‚Äôt appear for you, but may for others). 
---
Read it fully :) nice job! 
---
No lie, I got lost in the Poseidon Plant for over an hour after someone on the outside finished the quest for me, but I couldn't find the damn exit.  I never thought I'd miss those terrible Pip-Boy maps, but now...
---
I can, not sure where or when i got the plans, but its like the only helmet (besides assultron, eyebot etc.) i can craft
---
oh interesting. Good to know! And do they play a bigger role in the story later on? I've only seen one by that fissure site thing and i only really ran across that by accident cause i was following the road to the Greenbriar.
---
I just strip naked and hang around the golf club house. Most players get the message and clear my bounty! 
---
No. I was far away from my camp and/or whitesprings and killed lots of mole miners and super mutants
---
Then i pressed X to view mob's inventory then X again to take all.
---
Knowing I'll be crawling.
---
Hoping to do sell or give-aways
---
Right near "twin lakes"
---
Whenever you scrap most weapons or armour you will likely learn modification that you can craft. You will NOT learn how to craft the gun/armour by scrapping it, you must find or purchase a weapon/armour plan of that weapon to allow you to craft the weapon. As far as I know, you will not get mods from scrapping power armour pieces (or you can but it's just rare). Thank you.
---
Ok thanks
---
HA!  Quantum Nuka is awesome!  
---
Nuka cola machine is amazing;  would be nice if it plugged in and worked as a real cooler for a couple of drinks.
---
Find a bench and start scrapping then. Any bench will let you scrap any non-legendary item. 
---
To add to the list 
---
A .50 receiver for the hunting rifle does significantly less damage then the standard .308 variant 
---
Reason being Bethesda doing Bethesda things 
---
I got them to spawn as well... All ten of them
---
I wish they don't, but they actually do quite often (( 
---
Like they don't have the whole map and quests to  earn up.
---
Thank you.
---
you have to scrap the ones you come across.  I scraped one today that was in my inventory and then I got the notification that the plan was unlocked.
---
1. Your diatribe about master race trigger words suggests to somebody that doesn‚Äôt know you that these arguments triggered something in you, causing you to bring them up and repeat them in discussions where they don‚Äôt belong. 
---
2. My experience is limited to what I‚Äôve seen. And what I‚Äôve seen on consoles isn‚Äôt pretty. 
---
But I‚Äôve seen it enough times that I‚Äôve concluded, for my own conviction, across multiple titles and a decade or so, that it isn‚Äôt a statistical error or anomaly. 
---
Now, I wish to scientifically prove nothing to you. This isn‚Äôt a published study, and my experiences are neither scientifically recorded in the form
---
you‚Äôd trust as reliable data, nor are they immune to ‚Äúyes but they‚Äôre limited to the titles you/your kids play, which biases the data in whichever way‚Äù. 
---
Perhaps you spent just as much time on all the same platforms, and had a completely experiences. And perhaps one of our experiences is biased because the games we prefer or whatever. 
---
I don‚Äôt know enough about your experience, so perhaps let‚Äôs ask - what have you found, as someone with a foot in all camps?
---
Did you encounter toxic behavior? In what quantity? And where did you see more of it? 
---
If people don't enjoy PvP, they can turn it off and everything is fine or am I missing something? 
---
Yeah about 1 every 7 mins or so. Not so bad if you can do something else. It crashed after a bit and then gave up will do it again later today 
---
Fireproof 3 and dense armor mod. Screechattacks do no damage anymore. Profit.
---
yea i mean ive been following the Overseers quests and holotapes and she seems to be alive somewhere. The Responders seem to have all succumbed to this 'scorch' disease and have what looks like all other factions and normal people, leaving only mutants, ghouls and super mutants alive. Based on their research at Morgantown airport, they were closely working on either a cure or containment of subjects from the disease but doesn't look like they succeeded all the way. Im still holding out hope to meet *some* npc's eventually or at best, the Overseer herself. I already killer her friend Evan, who turned out to be a scorch/ghoul.
---
Tbh I don't get why it makes you an asshole... I'll admit it makes me think you're a bit weird because lets be real, I'm gunna let you do whatever you want to my base, I can only assume there's some frustration you really need to get out, could be a million things, but really it's gunna be like one button press and less materials than I'd loose between the sofa cushions to repair it. Barely use it other than a fast travel point anyway.
---
But I guess whatever tickles your pickle, probably better doing it here than in a game it could actually be a problem for someone.
---
I would place more emphasis on endurance for your iron fist build.
---
Though endurance doesn‚Äôt seem to have much appeal, the added health and ironclad, with adamantium and fireproof make you quite strong without power armor. Not to mention if you launch your nukes right, you don‚Äôt take rads in the Queen fight.
---
I have this for special:
---
S -15 (plus 7 for armor and brotherhood suit)
---
P- 1 (green thumb)
---
E- 15 (plus 3 for brotherhood suit)
---
C- 3 (Share strange in numbers at all times)
---
I- 5 (switch out with weapon perks)
---
A- 9 (standard set)
---
L- 8 (Standard set)
---
I had decided to clean out my stash box by keeping 150 of each crafting material.
---
Wood at 400.
---
Then any weapons i might wanna keep.
---
Everything i don't want or wont use, i have on me hoping to sell or drop to others.
---
I once read somewhere that one of the designers wanted to add a 150 feet tall glowing one becouse of how epic it would look but it was quickly made clear for him by the devs that that's what's called a 'major potentially game breaking element'. 
---
Maybe it's time for it?
---
I never personally got anything with higher level then was mob I looted that from, though maybe I was just unlucky, who knows...
---
yep they do, they are the ones who make the scorched and killed everyone
---
I give up.  I can't argue with you - do some searching (Google), you'll figure it out. I don't have the or patience for dumd*** people. Go back to your rifle farming and I'll do my clothing.  
---
I was hoping people didn't mention this on Reddit so they wouldn't hot patch it. I make most of my money from selling golf outfits
---
He can be killed, someone nuked him to see. You yourself cannot though. 
---
This is video that proves he can be Nuked to death.
---
[https://youtu.be/wnoBiYzqTck](https://youtu.be/wnoBiYzqTck)
---
I'll always voice it, but there are times I do indeed just want to sell some shtuff if people are interested.
---
There‚Äôs a bug currently that allows you to trade stuff like that.
---
Have them paint the power armor, put it in their stash, take it out, drop it. Then you can pick it up 
---
Well done post, thank you.
---
I generally like leaving the decon shower available for people to use, I just do not collect much flux, so that is always a worry.  So I leave acid, water and workstations all open as well.
---
Yes, I can move camp and it will rebuild, but that would take me quite a while as I have an extensive and very specific camp build (built around terrain).  So the cost would be in time here.
---
Been there. I say, they should simply move Queen's loot from her corpse to Scorched Earth event rewards to make it guaranteed. 
---
So odd that they chose not to add the plan for this item. But thank you

For me it's because I don't want to lose everything in my 'junk' category again! I lost it all twice and can't put it in my stash because that's already full of grenades, ammo, and outfits. I don't even bounty hunt anymore. Dying just SUCKS in this game, so I always stim who I can. No one wants their stuff taken.
---
Brilliant idea! 
---
I agree with you completely on this, I went for a 2 handed melee build myself as it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve been running since fallout 3 but I‚Äôve noticed how powerful I am compared to my teammates who use guns. At least until one of them got a legendary weapon with the two shot attribute. The other is still rather underwhelming damage wise even though he is using a legendary smg, purely because it doesn‚Äôt have the stats to keep up with my 450+ damage per swing with armor penetration. Rifles and other guns should be totally made more viable (especially considering the ammo you need to go through to kill half the stuff in this game)
---
I have the seven holotape miscellaneous quest.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen them. 
---
Welcome to the team! Most annoyingly unfinishable quest ever haha.
---
I managed to get one kill from launch until last month, then one day most of the ghouls at Whitesprings were randomly low level golfers and I finished it in seconds.
---
Holy heck, can you do it? 
---
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself and the subreddit! &lt;3
---
I picked up the marine combat helmet plans last night. Cosmetic still, but plans exist.
---
Wait why?
---
Read the rest of the comments from this post...you are the only dip**** claiming to farm rifles.  Everyone else is farming clothing.
---
I personaly think you should skip the suit and a make and make the x-01 power armor before you go. Dont know your build so some of your perks might now work but will give you way more survivability then a hazmat suit
---
Thanks for the advice! I'll be sure to look out
---
I don‚Äôt have any paints, sorry. Check r/fo76bazaar &amp; r/market76 I‚Äôm sure people would do it
---
So IT IS possible to learn the base item just from scrapping... and from eating? Interesting...
---
Hmm, I gave away my 3 star Cryolator (explosive), but would be interesting to test that out for the penetration.  You me be correct on that aspect as it does seem work with the perks.   When I was adding barrels, I noticed the Crystalizing seemed to be doing the most damage, that is why I put it on.  
---
I tested it out a bit because was curious.  Because explosive, it was doing quite a good amount of damage and still slowed down the mob (no need for crippling perks).  I can imagine if you wanted overkill, crippling/stagger would be over the top.   I do not think I was able to ever hit a mob enough times to see if it actually froze.  They (level 62 scorch) died way before that happened.  
---
Quite a fun weapon actually.   I just had zero heavy weapon perks.
---
Scorchbeasts are hella broken at the moment. Not only can they hit you through buildings as you said, they also rarely land in certain areas of the map, and can enter a state where they machine gun their scream attack without any recovery period in between. Also killing them gives you shit for loot. You should at least have a chance at a decent legendary but all you get is some meat to cook and some ultracite in their bones.
---
platform?
---
I don't think they exist. They weren't in the insta-ban devroom even, if I'm not mistake.
---
HAHAHAHAHAA! THAT'S YOUR REASONING?!
---
Look, okay, here's the thing. There's only a 24 player limit on each server, k? And server switching is popular as fuck thing to do, so of course you're going to see a lot of different people on the damn server even if you have a small ass player base.
---
I'll have to check out that out. Is it kind of like the prototype power armor in terms of getting it?
---
Heavy gunner perks and stabilized, when in power armor stabilized will ignore 45% of armor I believe which is very nice  
---
All we really need for that is adjustments to workshops
---
1)let your whole team be able to fast travel to your workshop like they can to your camp
---
2)when you retake a workshop, it should revert to what you had it as when you owned it last. (Maybe option on workshop to reset itl 
---
So when you invest your own material, it doesnt disappear with the server. Then you and your team can slowly build it up into your team's little village
---
For example next time I take tyler county, it should automatically go back to what's in this pic instead if having to use time and materials all over again
---

---
I have a couple. Marsupial and something else I believe.
---
Before the patch, explosive damage was +100% and two shot was +100%.
---
Bethesda put that in the patch notes.
---
Oh so everyone is for sure dead? 
---
maybe add expensive walls that can't be nuked. like made from ultracite and flux.
---
They're new players tho
---
Sucks that it's not shown via the interaction that it is a crime; I made the mistake once and won't be touching supply drops ever again or dropping them. Loot is absolute trash anyways.
---
As in they barely started playing
---
Recipes? How much for?
---
I used to always do this, but since the last patch I keep getting stuck in an endless emote motion...
---
Man the handmade rifle plans were level capped and I had missed the entirety of getting the chance to purchase them from vendors between levels 15-45.... I‚Äôm level 61 now :/
---
Some people have stated elsewhere that their is a big that if you don't have all the junk in one place. Be it on your person or in your stash. That it doesn't realise you have it. 
---
I‚Äôm 9/10 
---
It hurts 
---
Me too actually.  One of my friends do buy a little bit and use hybrid free/paid atoms to buy things though.
---
Make Appalachia Great Again
---
When did they make this a hard quest? I did it at lvl 15 week 2 or 3 of release. Is this like a recent patch?
---
The photos are pretty dark
---
People can tell if you're a pacifist just by shooting you once, if you arent in pacifist they wont get the player a is attacking player b notification
---
Well, the helmet I got from an Assaultron _Head_ and not from a helmet, so... Not the best example.
---
The soup I did get from either picking up or eating it.
---
Anyway, I've logged several hundred hours and those are the only things I've gotten. :(
---
To your point it would be cool if someone could datamine out a table of scrap-learn-able stuff.
---
Supposedly there was a 100% chance to learn the Marine Helmet from scrapping but that was a dev room pick up.
---
So many issues on ps4 it‚Äôs not even funny. If server stability is not their number one priority then something is wrong.
---
No they‚Äôre usually there
---
Since nerf city is gonna start it seems only fair that 3* enemies should drop 3* and so on 
---
Eat some food you savage. Also nice camp.
---
it really depends on whether you‚Äôre farming at whitespring or uranium fever or if you found a random legendary in the world. at whitespring the drops are almost literally 99% of the time garbage, uranium fever not that far from it either. i‚Äôve never found an actually decent weapon from whitespring but i‚Äôve seen a random three star mirelurk drop two legendaries, one of which was an explosive shotgun.
---
Yep, only vault dwellers from 76 are alive unless you count non scorched feral ghouls and sentient robots to be alive of course
---
Oh I am sorry. I didn't read correctly. No recipes mate my bad.
---
pc
---
Add that with an AA heavy gun, and you've got yourself a Scorch Beast melter. Seriously, I use this build, and my AA, non-explosive Gatling Plasma can kill a standard SB in about 15 seconds once it lands (I suck at aiming, so it takes longer when they're flying)
---
Harper's Ferry is your place for marine armor plans. When you fast travel, go through a hole in the wall in the building on the right. There are displays with plans on the first floor, and some more plans on the second floor (to get there go outside and jump on a red train car). 
---
Where at mate?
---
I suppose I need to rephrase. I'm just a bullet sponge in PA and it's boring. I prefer PA lore wise and in every game up to 76. I want it to be cooler than I'm a bullet sponge with rad resist for nuke zones. I'd even go so far as having less bullet sponge for more cool and interesting things to do with it. Lol it even would've been cool if we weren't handed a free set of ultracite armor and I could've had gathering it as a goal. X01 could've done something interesting. But no PA is quickly and easily finished aside from the tedious server hopping to buy mods, which we should've learned from scrapping pieces and crafted ourselves like we do with every other piece of gear. 
---
I wouldn't if I were you. Bethesda's getting ban-happy with exploits of late.
---
u/-rumHAM and they could name him Rux and he could be a Mirelurk 
---
When exactly do they reset?  I cleared Charlie solo today and had the code.  I entered it(I solved it then double checked online).  It failed because I had the wrong code.  I'm 99.9 siure I entered it right.  I fast traveled to the bunker to search for a new card, the word on the wall was 'pending' or whatever.  It was 'metalworking' before I entered the silo.  This was about 7 EST, seems to me it reset while I was in the silo.
---
If all the normal people and survivors got killed due to this disease, wouldn‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt all ghouls be affected as well?
---
This is essentially the same thing as playing the endgame of fo76
---
I would suggest an underground vault city that can't be nuked and can support much higher player count. No pvp, except a combat arena you can watch players fight in.
---
Are you actually under the impression that being aware of an exploit automatically means you use that exploit? 
---
It hasn't been too bad for me but I did have 2 dicks try to destroy my Camp the other day. I wasn't even there so I just logged off. 
---
The only other bad time I was 2 other dicks who kept shooting at my and following my around. I didn't have any loot on me so I just fought them and died. 
---
I must be late what's the deal with sentinel + assassins armor? 
---
I think the outrage trend started with EA. Bethesda was caught in crossfire. Also Blizzard got some.
---
I use anti armor 40% swing speed switch blade to spam slap damage on people
---
Then sometimes I still have it equipped when enemies attack and I SHRED them with no melee perks lmao
---
Hold down square button on PS4.
---
One possible fix for the escape artist perk is to have it use AP when there are enemies nearby that would have otherwise detected you. 
---
Sounds like a problem with your WiFi 
---
Super irradiated and mutated animals/humans are somewhow resistant to the scorched plague and all non feral ghouls got killed by other people thinking that they were mindless zombies
---
But does really those few items take up 56% ?:/
---
I spend about 25% of my time at the club.  I have explored every single location on the map.  I often go into the buildings where legendaries are to try and find some better armor pieces, but others do as well.  So the only reliable source of legendaries is the club.
---
I will always wait until there is no one at all at the club, then try and pop over and get a few legendary.
---
Now when I arrive, I cause a spawn of ghouls to arrive, its really irritating that a guy with TSE will pop right over soon as I arrive and 1 shot everything.   Those scum are just waiting for someone new to arrive and cause the spawn so they can warp over and take it all.
---
This is a very difficult to implement, because it just leads to a long path of problems that need to get addressed in order for this to work. What I would do instead is to set several towns as central hubs, that allow you to claim a home. You will have security, similar to Whitesprings, at this hubs and a Mr. Handy who will be playing the role of your tenant, as well as, a corresponding faction vendor depending where the town is located. The way the homes works is that there are different types. Depending where it's located and the size of the home will determine the price. You can only own one home at a time, but if you decide to move, all your furniture will be stored for use in all homes. Once you claim it, you're allowed to fast travel to it for free and can activate the build/edit mode within it. The homes will be instanced, so claiming the home will allow you to access it no matter what server you're in. If you're in a group, and other members of the group are in the same home, but you want to access theirs, when approaching the home, you can be prompted with selecting either entering your own home or a group member's home, similar to the window that pops up when you choosing to cut a wire from the random atom bomb encounter. C.A.M.P.S will continue to serve its main purpose, being a mobile settlement.
---
I have found 2 jet packs. The auto scrap in camp took one of them. I have stopped server jumping for mods. Traded for the rest of my pieces.
---
Abused by switching in and out, for example someone hits you and thinks you're in pacifist so they turn their back and you switch off pacifist and dump bullets before they can react
---
That's not true, I see my carry weight go up when I go from 15 to 26 strength
---
I‚Äôve noticed going from Danger back to Caution only happens when I‚Äôve broken line of sight with the enemy. I do experience what you‚Äôre referring to...I find myself running around corners and sprinting while pumping up and down trying to break Danger. 
---
Also, certain creatures like Molerats never seem to break off. 
---
I find certain creatures like glowing ghouls seem to have a sixth sense of where I am when sneaking. I get swarmed by these a lot at Whitesprings. 
---
I upped my sneak to rank 3, got escape artist, and got camo armor.   I am able to get up close and shoot them, but eventually some seem to spot me.  My armor does get trashed rather quickly, but I still only need to repair about once per 2 hours.  (No white knight perk equipped, only when repairing)
---
Funny... I melee them all the time at level 87...  Just took out a Deathclaw at Deathclaw Island with All Rise.  Mirelurk Queen is much easier when bashing away at her, plus I don't have to go hunt lead afterwards...  Same with Assaultron.  Granted, this only works if you can sprint and get close.  
---
I also take out Scortchbeasts, including helping taking down a Queen, with Melee.  But...  you do need a decent gun to get them to land first.
---
I've taken out a bunch of high level bears lately, but they are more difficult because they stagger you, even in power armour.  If they stagger you too much, you can't get your hits off fast enough.
---
The Sentrybots can be difficult.  Ran into a high level one with missiles and anti-armour shot.  Those I like to take out from far away.  I also run into high level turrets every so often with burning/explosive shot.  You die quickly when you get close to them, especially without the right perk cards.
---
Yeah, for most PVE Melee works well and reduces the amount of lead you need to farm.  PVP is a different story as there are more builds that negates close-up damage, assuming that you can get close in the first place.
---
mkay IGN helkaexe, i‚Äôll be on in like 5h so if that‚Äôs too late for you just lmk
---
I can't say, because I experience similar problems. My budgets max and the other day it wasn't. The only difference between the two days is I planted mutfruit corn and tatos
---
Autostim or lifesaving armor will do that. I've had it happen several times.
---
Every server is dead except for low levels and a very very rare high level
---
The banwave hit very hard, not only removing the people who were banned but their friends who went with them to another game
---
yeah thats not griefing. 
---
I'll add you. My friend and I play pretty often if you are interested. 
---
That's on par with most of the "contractors" around here offering building services, especially if they are providing the mats. 
---
I already take less than 5 hp per hit from a tse with a full sentinel assassin set
---
Can you IMAGINE after they nerf tse effects by 80%?
---
People are going to regret wanting the tse nerf when oppressive armor becomes more common and only unyielding melee have a chance to kill anything 
---
The plans exist in the game data, but aren't placed anywhere (even the test cells).
---
I definitely expected more from the Mirelurk since it was in the wendigo cave. That was the most disappointing since he killed me twice before I bested him. 
---
Someone posted a duper hunting "guide" on here recently, this is exactly why I reported it and it got taken down, it just incites witchhunting and players who aren't even duping are being harassed.
---
If you're going around harassing players assuming they're duping then you're just as bad as dupers.
---
Another who can't read... "All turrets face into the golf club so they shoot the Ghouls you're trying to kite".
---
I'll take your word on that. I hadn't seen this level of crazy before. Well, the reaction to 76 reminded me a lot of  the news covering the 2016 US presidential election 
---
he just doesn't agree with your point. and you are being obnoxious about it. a suggestion is fine, but this phony tough guy act comes off as faintly pathetic.
---
Not correct just tested it.
---
Many also did not sell to anyone outside their circle because they wanted to be the only ones with it. I had to trade high tier armor for every piece of my set
---
Platform, i wanna destroy your build
---
Yeah, but if you can get 40 caps out of a 200 cap item, that means you can get 20 out of a 100cap item, or 80c/400c etc etc. 
---
I've found it helpful to set an arbitrary Cap per pound, like.. 50, that is the minimum I'll horde items for. 
---
Power armor is obsolete compared to a set of armor with only 1 or 2 pieces and a dense chest piece
---
They will still find a way to complain that the game has a core mechanic that upsets them. They want safe spaces (literally) in game.
---
* leans back in luxury office chair, puts on sunglasses, puffs cigar with a shit-eating satisfied grin* 
---
Gauss is definitely a little buggy.  And I am not talking about  the "enter VATS, wait one second, only then shoot" bug. In my case, it constantly leaves VATS mode after one shot, even if target is in my line of sight and I have plenty AP.  So often I have to switch to my lever action. Damage is lower, but more consistent and I don't lose my crits.
---
Ok it so when your on we will have to rush the weekly one since challenges end in 7hrs so there would be like 2hrs left.
---
I'm pretty sure it's currently only obtainable through the off-limits developer room. Bethesda has been banning players who've been to the room. Players who have been to the dev room took stuff not available in game and started selling/trading the items to other players. I think I read that they're doing indefinite bans if you have items from the room in your inventory, but don't quote me on that... I'd be careful with it. 
---
You and me both.
---
You never did explain how you get 1400 worth of outfits in 30mins.
---
add me up, need some friends to do events :)
---
ID: john13th
---
Yea basically experiencing everything you said. Also since the last update my character only does sneak attack damage maybe 40% of the time and even when they do I can only deal sneak attack damage only once. After that, even if I'm still in caution, I don't deal any sneak attack damage no matter how many times I TBag the ground.
---
I'll take the tse lever action.
---
Good idea
---
Part of me wants to be concerned for you because you clearly don't get out much and another part of me is dying to laugh because this makes you sound detached from reality.
---
"Phony tough guy act" lmfaooooo
---
This is a Reddit conversation about FO76... Not a sit down with the Mafia, you lunatic.
---
but he had x-01 power armor so could it be autostim?
---
You mean, as the game was intended to play. 
---
Hmm.  The turrets have high/low ranges as well.  If it is too high up, then they will not target stuff when close; punji boards help with that.
---
One spotlight pointing in a direction, should direct the guns to target them though.  (If not too high).
---
That is quite a few points into turrets.   One thing to consider is maybe building defensive walls instead, would be cheaper on the budget.   Then maybe a few traps at the opening with switch on the outside wall?  Mobs wont pull the switch and traps will always be online, but you can turn off traps and walk in.  I have not messed with the traps, but perhaps they are cheaper on the budget.
---
I dont use any defenses at all except for some fences around my crops; my budget is maxed.
---
To be fair companies can be hilariously terrible at pricing even with entire departments devoted to it.  It's why some companies do better than others.
---
In an artistic endeavor and an industry chasing one another even analysismight be ignored because of what an executive believes the intrinsic value is.
---
In theory you're correct.  In reality some companies are woefully incompetent.  
---
That is an excellent and simple solution.  I‚Äôd love to see a town building mechanic.  It‚Äôd also be cool to just allow us to rebuild existing areas and ‚Äòrent‚Äô out those spaces too, perhaps have plots of land available in the surrounding area as you suggested.  
---
No questions. Come at me, dude. 
---
Chicken noises.
---
These should be considered reposts by now. Every single one is exactly the same for the same reasons
---
Anti-armor boxing glove, 2 incisor, 3 iron fist, 5 adrenaline. I 1 shot supers with regular vats attacks. Insanely fun to sprint through west tek jabbing green dudes to death.
---
It's on ongoing joke with the Fallout 76 missions: dead or robot :P
---
I think I've noticed mutant hounds have an easier time finding me in sneak compared to super mutants, which would make sense. Sometimes enemies spot me from yards away, other times they brush up against me and don't find me. I know it's to much to ask for atm, but I do wish there was some kind of mechanic in place that made staying hidden more consistent skill based and less arbitrary and random.
---
My only real issue has been server crashes. I've never had another player even come close to my camp - I'm under some power lines in the middle of nowhere. 
---
The game definitely needs some fine tuning and, er, actual NPCs, but the community here seems to be blowing a lot of shit out of proportion
---
Yesterday I was just doing some stuff in the game, decided to look at my quests and saw that I had killed 5 of them while farming the area without knowing. I thought they wouldn't actually spawn at my level. 
---
PC
---
If by build you mean character, I don't do duels. I prey on people who have shitty characters.
---
If by build you mean camp? I invite people to destroy my camp because it's vacant. I store all my benches when not using them. I have a simple shack which sometimes I trick people into going into and I lock the door and start slapping them. The only way for them to leave is to attack my camp which allows me to causes them to be wanted, in which case I use the black powder pistol and one shot them and stash thier junk. At that point I don't care if they kill me, I'm not worth anything.
---
And make sure you put Dense mod on your chest piece.
---
No because the atoms aren't going through credit services.  You're paying cash FOR atoms and you can buy Atom in $5 increments in most games.  Almost all use the $4.99/9.99/19.99/49.99 price scheme.
---
My issue with this is the "good" part.  What good weapon/ armor are we talking about?  Don't get me wrong, I hate the RNG of legendary to the point that I wish they would scratch the whole thing, nerf them and make them mods to craft.  However, my current pistol crit build would love to find a %dmg to mob type, crit dmg pistol of each mob type.  Would that be included in the good weapons?  Or is it only the flavor of the week gear?
---
Sounds like I need to find out what this queen is about too
---
I don't do duels. I ambush people who aren't expecting it.
---
That seems like a long time for that build. 
---
10,000 stash limit...Its not too much to ask for.
---
Only got 6. Been playing since launch lmao
---
Just got a TSE Dragon! Tnx a lot and a great idea! 
---
Umm.... I finished building the Excavator Armor. And saw the next part of the mission was take it down south and let the machine scan it. 
---
The problem was... I destroyed each bit of armor as I created it because I had no where to stow it. 
---
Ah yes, there it is. Predictable.
---
I don't think any of my perks would help. Is it the prototype x01 armor you're talking about?
---
Run Patrol Duty at the Penitentiary near Grafton, it's a possible reward. Grahm sometimes (rare)has it in stock no matter your level
---
Rifles have Tormentor (luck I think?)
---
Auto receiver on rifles would work fine with Tormentor.
---
Sounds good, friend :P yeah originally bought it at the turn of the year to join a friend of my own but it seems by then he was too far away we with reviews and had sold it same day haha, still in my books multiplayer Fallout is awesome no matter how you cut it. Look forward to joining y'all
---
NO. Kindly fuck off. The entirety of the rest of reddit is politics. Get this shit outta here. 
---
The wendigo one is easy af. You just have to kill a wendigo in a full clown outfit. Which yes includes the hat. It doesn't even need to be the one marked on the map. That's just an area where they spawn. Ya know.. the wendigo caves
---
Inside the different open train cars
---
I killed him and the quest completes but then it comes back when I log back in. 
---
The number of times I've gone to do a power attack against a horde of ghouls in melee distance charging at me... And then heard "dead man's click"...
---
just thinking the same thing lmfao
---
I stealth and shoot robots in the foot.  Boom, their foot explode in just a single shot.
---
Shoot both feet and have crawling robots.
---
Oh no!!
---
I think there has been a trend in the last few years to be completely over the top with Youtube and even some normal news outlets. There's a lot of rage in people reviews. Some of it is justifiable. But then they capitalizes on the public outcry and stir the pot for more clicks
---
Side note: I like yongyea's YouTube. His voice is calming even when he's angry at things :)
---
Not a bit more stupid as map on Esc button and you need to press "Z" to enter pause menu through map. 
---
I did that and the quest completed and came back when I logged back in. It‚Äôs done that for other people too.
---
im around 80 and only saw him once. sadly was a low level and had no caps to buy the AMAZING plans he has;-;
---
big yeah
---
One gun army is pretty optional, but all HG perks and stabilized are mandatory. .50 cal or Gatling gun are the only two I‚Äôd bother with.
---
It does that for me as well. I just take it as an extra 20 caps when it pops back up lmao
---
I'm amused that one, completely related to topic, line, is getting so much "interest" from the local people flying the SS of the wastelands colors...
---
Has anyone found plans for the 45, 51, and 60 sets?
---
You try explaining to a robot why a regular gun that could be bought anywhere in the good ol USA is more valuable than the outfits they keep behind a glass wall at the golf club that the president of the united states hangs out at.
---
I once tamed a pretty high levelled Yao Guai and never saw him again lmao
---
yea i got this guy back to my house he's only lvl 30 but hey it's a mirelurk king :)
---
Those helmets are strange - Marine Armor Helmet learn you a plan after scrapping just one helm, while yesterday I bought one Combat Armor helmet, found another 2 in the world (one in Helvetia, one in shack near Vault 76) and none of this scrapped gave me plan to craft. Anyone who have learn the plan make me lets say 10 (I can provide mats) and I can scrap them one by one?
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care dude, you already bought their dumpster fire. Just go play rd2. I‚Äôve already moved on to other more interesting and challenging games already. 
---
Hell yeah man, those things whoop my ass everytime. Even at level 70 with a tse combat shotgun lolol but I suppose that's life. 
---
oh god oh no oh god please todd do whatever this man says or Bethesda will lose a single customer
---
And they actually worked?? Everytime i power up monongah the power doesn't even work lol
---
If my game was not permanently having graphical glitches, I would love visuals in this game.
---
If this dumpster fire goes f2p. I want my money back. No atoms. No skins. No weapon paint. Im not into that fortnite-esqe trash. Money. And all of it.
---
This is so much worse then the canvas bag incodient and you literally listed atoms ad compensation. Wtf?
---
This sub makes 0 sense sometimes.
---
I think most have had pretty positive experiences so far.  In general a lot of us are coming from Fallout fandom and have been looking for the opportunity to experience it with friends.  We‚Äôre just happy to explore the wasteland together.
---
Unfortunately for some, a handful of very rare experiences can really hurt the way they experience the game.  Much in the same way getting sick after eating your favorite meal can make it difficult to stomach for a while.
---
There's an issue on pc too I think but not with that mod. Since patch my game takes ages to load and often crashes. The loading wheel stop then goes really fast. I've had regular crashouts since. I have that mod on one of my characters and it doesn't seem to make any difference
---
Was it hard bursting through the Earth's crust on the way up from Satan himself?
---
No questions here. I like the honesty. We all do it. At some point, caps really don't matter and it's just fun to instigate shit. 
---
He would have to be pistol specialized though!
---
And x I think on Xbox.  I play ps4 so it's a guess
---
I really enjoy this idea it's a very small end game addition but maybe even on top of the scorchbeast queen maybe addition mega bosses for better loot? I dont know I'm not a game developer which is obvious but hopefully the Devs see this and implement it
---
Waiting on you to come get lol..
---
I've been utterly addicted since release, haven't played anything else
---
The times, there are people in there, I tend to shoot it once (with normal handmade) and run it into people so they can hit it :)
---
Grahm shares caps pool with Watoga. 
---
Fix database, server, whatever code.  No other game has ever blamed game stability based on how many "widgets" were in your bank.  This is literally a bag of burning crap.  Your whole stash is smaller in size than the data you send in this reddit post.  
---
I used to be an accountant but went back to college to get my network management degree. After graduating I started working at the college in IT with a guy I met in my classes and after a couple years we ended up opening our own business together. He always enjoyed the hardware side of things, setting up servers and tinkering with the computers and I enjoyed the challenge of setting up the network to be as efficient as possible and maintained the network infrastructure, redoing the cables and setting up switches and hubs etc. We are currently just a contracted company, not some big corporation or anything lol. We just go in and setup or upgrade old infrastructure to meet the companies needs (future proofing what we can). He decides what we need for hardware and I design the network layout based on that and the building then we run it by the customer for approval.
---
They only spawn for lower levels and (I believe) not in nuked Whitesprings.
---
So uh, good luck with that nowadays.
---
Big guns arent really an end game, really if you concentrate on the right perks and focus on a a particular weapon type you can do a lot of damage with anything.
---
With that being said I am a heavy gun player and do enjoy it. Boring bits out of the way first, big guns need a lot if maintenance. Need to boost your Weapon smith perk to make guns last longer, stabilised is good for more accuracy and ignoring armor, power user for you cores to last longer in power armor (intelligence perks). Then you have all 3 of the heavy gun perks and whatever perks you need to your ammo (explosive or bullets) (strength perks).
---
You should also get these perks but they dont need to be equipped all the time, just when you are crafting.
---
# weapon artisan is good for repairing guns more then usual so they last longer.
---
# ammosmith to make more ammo
---
# super duper to make even more ammo
---
The good thing with a heavy weapon build coming from a melee build is they are actually pretty interchangeable as they are reliant on strength points.
---
If you have a perk loadout manager mod on pc you can switch between the two pretty easy too.
---
Haha, interesting question. I do this for fun and roleplay
---
whats a crit build? 
---
I will answer everyone‚Äôs questions for you. Because you‚Äôre bored as shit and they‚Äôre of a low enough level you can trash their stuff easily. It‚Äôs pretty simple. Pretty sure everyone already knew this...don‚Äôt know why it needed to be an AMA. It‚Äôs why I do it. But I don‚Äôt use kid gloves. I go straight in there TSE weapons and all. No fucks given.
---
Ah okay lmao on a real note though what's your level and the dmg on the black powder pistol?
---
Oh that makes no sense, so it makes perfect 76 sense! Tyvm
---
I did the same thing. It's an open door floor plan with all of the crating machines open for use. I want anyone running by who needs it to pop in and fox what they gotta. When some ass wipe with the name ComeGetSome starts attacking your camp, it's just so petty. No reason for it. 
---
I saw a group of 3 raiders today, just going from camp to camp, smashing them and then clearing each others' bounties, presumably trying to bait camp owners, but who knows. The first and only people I've blocked since I started about 4 weeks ago.
---
I don't want to get majorly spoilery but fair warning
---
The giant mutant bats cause a plague that infected a bunch of people and turned them into the Scorched. This became an extinction level threat and the various groups of Appalachia tried to defeat them. The scorchbeasts live underground and come up through these fissures. Scorchbeasts are very hard to kill, and the fissures are hard to close, but a nuclear missile should hopefully seal these fissures up, containing the beasts. 
---
I wanted to pvp but i‚Äôm xbox. Cheers
---
Erm are you sure about that? The Enclave seemed happy to mutate a trooper called Frank a couple of decades later. 
---
I use perks that fill my crit meter quickly and "better criticals" makes crits do even more damage(this can get pretty seriously high after all the multipliers)
---
Does this actually work?
---
&gt; I keep the music turned way down
---
the first thing i do in almost any game is turn the music all the way off.
---
Golf clap...
---
Grahm I have seen...twice? Maybe?  200~ hrs.  And patrol duty has given me 16 plasma plans and 2 hunting rifle.  I finally just bought them for 1500 caps from a dude. Worth every cap
---
understandable opinion. 
---
&gt;!but we both know they are not giving a refunds. its better to get something for our early adoption then nothing.!&lt;
---
I'm trying to be vague but I'm *around* 50. I'm at a level where I can cause trouble but not instantly scare people off.
---
Very interesting! I need to progress further into the story to get to these juicy parts!
---
So what‚Äôs the reasoning behind vault dwellers not being affected by this extinction level plague?
---
Well if they don't give us anothet stash increase. I will settle for clans with a clan vault + Player vendors + A shared stash between alts. :D
---
Ah okay okay. Well gg then sir
---
First of all its not true. You can't one shot everything. A scorched beast takes me around 6-7 with a maxed rifle build an demo skilled and the gauss rifle with tse. This feels correct and balanced to me since the tradeof with expl weapons is that the damage can easily kill you if you get to close. What often happens if a ghoul is rushing you.
---
Sure you can try to avoid it but there is a good chance you cant. So that feels properly balanced.
---
To spend more time killing a scorched beast is just a pure waste of resources. Before the tse I couldnt really make a dent and burnt through all resources only to get a scorched liver and bone in the end and the mediocre 300 xp. 
---
Same goes for glowing ghouls over 50 who are the most important targets for legendary loot in the end game
---
So no. The game started to become fun again with TSE. 
---
The nerf will make sure to remove that fun promoting the already overpowered melee builds to gods who have no match. The level 51 build I run as second char can literally one shot everything already apart of the queen. That is a problem.
---
That and the bobblehead stacking. 
---
Please yes. I just want my Tesla power armor back.
---
Same here, have my camp dangling off a cliff edge haha
---
And the tse will be level 25....
---
Pretty accurate. Bethesda failed, but it seems they are trying to fix the game. I would say one year or yeah, somewhat of 6 - 8 months and the game will feel a bit better. I will be realistic tho, failed games realy rarely get patches and fixes they need.
---
But there is something which makes me feel F76 will be patched like crazy - this game is somewhat of an experimental ground where bethesda will be trying new things for it's future games like starfield and tes6. So probably we will see a lot of cool new features and patches.
---
im always getting wood armor...or supressed spear..lol..
---
I saw a guy running around 1-shotting everything with a TSE handmade. I asked him if he was a duper. He said nope, I just bought this on Ebay for $5.
---
Sigh.
---
Ehhh every survival game I've played has had issues related to too many entity problems.
---
The weight exploit is a prime example of it.
---
I even had a guy tell me his overloaded character causes other players to dc when in proximity to them.
---
The netcode is shakey.
---
It's legit I got the shotgun
---
I think having bulked junk weighting zero when in stash would :
---
- make sense
---
- be easy to code
---
- make bulking useful
---
- solve most inventory problems
---
YouTube ‚ÄúPoseidon hazmat suit FO76‚Äù

If it‚Äôs not there, server hop
---
I've run into a few tse users and they're pretty confused when they don't kill me. I use a gamma pistol which does 125 rads per shot. Folks without power armor just die to rads. Doesn't matter if they're stacking sentinel or whatever and the PvP meta is no power armor. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Plasma grenades accomplish the same thing and you don't have to do any trading or grinding.
---
those perks and weapons that ignore enemies armor..what enemies wear armor? does it only work on like super mutants and robots?
---
We've only just come out of the vault and haven't been exposed to it as much, and you'll find a large number of anti-scorched techniques that groups tried to develop across the map. Pretty much all of them were incomplete as the people died before finishing them. An early-ish quest is an innoculation project, or a sort of immunization you can perform on yourself. If the vault had opened a few years earlier, the dwellers would likely have died. The factions of Appalachia didn't work very well together, but if the dwellers do, we might have a chance of stopping all this and saving not just ourselves, but maybe the whole country.
---
Games way to unstable connection wise to expand it atm.
---
You can have my moth man sightings.  Little fucker jumps me almost every night.   I have never stolen eggs and have only done the lighthouse event that he likes.  Nope like clockwork he's bailed me usually as I'm minding my own business exploring the mountains. 
---
So do I. I only take fights I know I can win. Or else...why would I fight.
---
Just play long enough and you will see the not-so-nice ones.
---
I'm going on 300 hours and can say I have met a few of them, not many mind you.
---
Only 1 of them had I put on perma-block.  He tried to snipe me while I was low health farming whiesprings.   
---
After he failed (and mini-nuked me), I just blocked him and left.   
---
I quoted what you said.
---
I reread it a few times tbh.
---
Doesnt make a lick of sense.  You're not spending 30mins on outfits doing the same thing i do in 5 hours.
---
Fabricated bullshit
---
If your on pc we use perk manager to swap on the go.
---
The problem isnt ways to add storage, they could do that very easily. The issue is the amount of server space that is taken up by the stash
---
....not bad.
---
Id still like to see different kinds of big unique bosses for different nuke zones/fissure sites though.
---
See I‚Äôm confused. Isn‚Äôt the point if the bounty system to deter griefing?  Like it‚Äôs something Bethesda implemented to help those who don‚Äôt want to pvp? If Bethesda still wants it that way they should make it so that people with a bounty over a certain threshold will lose a random gun or armor piece when killed. Alternatively allow drops to come from the offenders stash after hitting the threshold so they can‚Äôt safely hide their goodies. Make it more devastating to get a bounty for being a jerk. 
---
In addition, make it so bounty is only occurred upon camp item destruction rather than attacking it to help prevent punishment for accidental damage. Keep lock picks as they are. And increase bounty based on amount of damage done especially for something like the shower. 
---
Code is crap so change your behavior and deal?  You win fail logic of the day.  
---
I've already gone back and forth with you so I'll go ahead and just let you have the last say...
---
Me too. When I do not see graphical glitches, broken render, bugs and ugly lighting, slow, buggy and clunky as fuck interface, crazy scorchbeast "I cant see and hear shit for a minute" fights, boring inventory management and disconnects.
---
Yeah, when I not see this I am enjoying the game. The problem is, I see this all 80% of the time I play.
---
was supposed to be fixed in last patch
---
What's your IGN?
---
Problem solved since Diablo II :
---
- one affix : uncommon
---
- two affixes : rare
---
- three affixes : legendary
---
- 4+ affixes : epic
---
You could even color code items to make it more readable.
---
Pretty sure if you kill the scorch ground troops it causes at least the queen to land. Maybe all of them.
---
Just another tactic in addition to the wing crippling techniques. But yeah sb in general are an annoying fight.
---
Have not downvoted sorry to burst your bubble..
---
What are these free games? Is it pc players only or can PS4 players claim them? 
---
Something similar but different from my Reddit name
---
Rule 6 is enforced by a bot. The rule 6 filter is based off of title length. Titles like OP's are a rare false positive, where a short title is fine. If OP had contacted us as the bot message told them to, we would have approved it.
---
And a daughter named Lisa?
---
So true this lol
---
They can ban people who used a cheat engine to get in, but not everyone with the helmet, or paladin paint or whatever. Lots of innocent people have it now that have no clue it‚Äôs not in game and never had anything to do with exploitation. Bethesda would be really stupid to get ban happy. Lose a lot of future customers and it makes them look foolish.
---
I mean, feel free to check my comment history. There's a place and time for politics and shoving it into this sub is pretty weak. Like I said, the entirety of the rest of reddit (basically) is more than willing to circlejerk with you.
---
Impressive how big of a dick you are. Commendable.
---
Although I'd argue you're missing out on a good chunk of interesting encounters as well a good profit not taking on higher leveled players as well.
---
Anyways, always good to see more malevolent players in the game. The game's got a good amount of friendly people which is great. But it does need more baddies to balance the experience out.
---
Robots have twisted thoughts of prices and value. Who the hell needs exploding ammo flamethrower in a goldf club? Noone! But look how many naked ghouls without clothes there... they need some golf outfits on them!
---
Actualy, perfectly fits robot thinking in this game, lol.
---
I don't think it's a single player having issues with inventory management, and not wanting to throw away or sell everything they find. If stash space prevents someone from enjoying the game. Prevents them from fast travelling when they need to. Prevents them from actually playing the game. Then that is something that will lose a lot of players. How many people already bought the game for less than half price and quit already? This is a very niche game already. Every crash, every disconnect, every nerf, and every time you can't fast travel because you don't want to throw away all your chems and weapons, is another player lost.
---
Well, considering you do build a lifetime immunity to the flu, but there are so many different mutations and types of flu you keep getting it (the flu virus mutates at such a speed that every year it has changed ever so slightly that you need to build a new immunity against it) it could be argued that there are simply many different types and mutations of Radworms that you have to build an immunity against separately.
---
Another argument to be made is when you use the disease remove consumables you're essentially using antibiotics, which do not have you build an immunity against a virus. Thus you are actually preventing yourself from defending against the diseases naturally. In the real world this isn't the biggest problem, since the viruses we use antibiotics against are often not viruses you will easily contract. Whereas in FO76 everything and everyone is disease ridden.
---
Where was it out of interest as I leave mine open for use by anyone and have never had a problem. Its in an out of the way location mostly used by people exploring and in their mid levels so people are probably just happy to see it.
---
Thx this worked for me after using the the ini crater mod at nexus
---
No worries mate glad it worked 
---
[PS4 Pro, v1.07] Invisible teammate after fast travelling or entering a building. Can't even see their names. Its like playing with a ghost.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Oh, well now I know, thanks for the info.
---
bulked junk should weight zero in stash.
---
Yes. I had a very basic camp in the beginning of the game. I loved setting it up outside each new area/city/etc. and exploring. 
---
I've been getting it non-stop just now. Went into Berkeley Springs and when I equip my Radium Rifle my chassis disappears.
---
Ah I see...  hiding behind anonymity does inspire courage to be a douche, doesn't it?
---
I've had to wear a hazmat suit in training and no way can you wear those over armour. ;)
---
They already bought 76. Aint much of a stretch.
---
I'll just copy paste my message from a week ago:
---
"You probably won't get banned for having it in your inventory, Bethesda knows that some people have acquired these from other players. Previously people were able to get the hold of Fasnacht Masks and after the latest update the masks were simply removed from both the inventories and stashes. If Bethesda doesn't want these items to be carried by players they will do so again."
---
Better red than dead
---
I completely agree friend
---
Or a Gigasloth or Terasloth
---
Yep. Read my establishing remarks.
---
always respect an honest chill raider, with the state of the end game content right now i‚Äôd be all about raiding for fun if everyone didnt raise a huge shitstorm from being killed once.. would spice things up a bit but people take it all too seriously.
---
A giant mole miner wouldn't make sense since they're humans in hymen sized mining suits.
---
There are basically two ways to play this game. Doing the quests and exploring, or doing the quests, exploring and farming the hell out of whitespring.
---
Level 82 and since im done with pretty much everything in the game, im focusing on the trophies and challenges.
---
However, looking at it from the other side, the game is currently being played "successfully" with the limit where it is. It's manageable. You have to plan for what you need. I'd love to be able to keep 1000 of everything so I didn't have to worry about running out of this, making room for that, etc. But that is not the design mechanic. 
---
If it goes free to play people are gonna be even more pissed. Especially the people who didn't get it at a discounted price. Imagine paying 60 bucks for a game like fortnite lmao
---
I dropped a nuke on New Gad earlier. Jesus that was boring.
---
I'll go for them after the patch when the fear of stacked bobblehead tse handmades are gone.
---
Flair indicates otherwise
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Congrats enjoy
---
Enjoy your stimpacks!
---
Woaa.. energy shield sounds goood
---
It would be like the final nail in bethesdas coffin. 
---
I think that they should be focused on releasing new content in the game and developing the main story than going free to play.
---
Game turned out to be better than I expected and I've played every day since the start of beta. ;)
---
The robots and tapes even grew on me over time.
---
Strange thing though is the map now feels small to me but I've been exploring all over.
---
There are some definite flaws/balance problems to the game but my only real irritation is that the devs seem determined to make it more grindy as time is passing... why?!?!?!? 
---
&gt; I'm assuming all the intelligent Enclave members voted against Eckhart in his initial coup.
---
Or were in the Oil Rig, leaving Captain Ahab to chase his Communist whale more-or-less on his own.
---
Found out that the culprit was lined unerarmors that increased specials. Does your rifle have a special increasing legendary effect?
---
Very fair.
---
Currently, Raiding is legit the most efficient way to earn caps so I highly recommend bumping up your targets when you're comfortable. I'm able to rack up several thousands of caps a day from it.
---
I'd also recommend eventually building up a good CAMP. Can't go living on in squalor after reaping in all the loot.
---
Next we'll be fighting dragons...
---
I agree.  I would love to see PA not just bullet sponge.  However, on the flip side what if PA was melee only?  Like "tank' only.  Currently, you can be any build in power armor what if PA gave you a bunch of movement / aim / AP negatives and like in previous versions of FO lighter armor or different armor offered different bonus like more AP.
---
Mhh but i read that sadly you cant use toxic valley #3 map in other spots so the map is not swapped with another map is definitely bugged. Thanks for your answer
---
Do your research in future. Reviewers called this shit out already. 
---
Most of diseases I simply ignore - my character will recover from it in time and they barely matter or harm. As for immunity, being well fed and drunk reduce disease chance by 50% as far as I remember.
---
0 (which is what I think you mean by extremely negative?)
---
the players like me that stood by the game since launch would either want extreme compensation or outright leave. Being F2P doesn't fix the ossues with the game or bring in more revenue for the game, it will just create more problems than solutions.
---
Essentially it could require a faction of players being permanent in a server, so their built area is always there when they play. The random players they encounter will only be individuals or groups not yet progressed enough to buy their HQ build, and naturally groups that have chosen different areas that don‚Äôt conflict will encounter each other and be able to choose whether to align, oppose, or not care about one another. This is covered in my feedback response to the inside the vault call, you can check it out on my /u
---
I like the idea of a group leveling with shared efforts and also their hq itself having progression, the opposite of the camp whose potential is fixed and is meant to be re designed and moved freely. Hub building is about continually growing and iterating in one place. 
---
.... whelp. ;)
---
Also, have only one weight reduction perk per inventory tab.
---
Random drop at top of the world. On a...mole miner I think?
---
a few hundred players.on a server? i thought.there was a limit of 25 players.per.server..or is this just for.ps4?
---
I mean, the end game enemy is a flying creature that spits things from it's mouth at you.
---
I think it would be a stupid move. If they put anything in the atom store that is even close to Pay to win, i Will quit. Even though i love the game. I rather pay a monthly few if a game is good enough than buy items, boosters etc in game.
---
Sounds awesome! My GT is SoundlessAxis7
---
Maybe its that perk card that will stimpak you when you're health is below 10%. I have it and its very useful.
---
I've always wanted to Pet-a-sloth
---
Current stash limit is breaking whole gameplay mechanic of looting 
---
Why? Because how it was in Fallout 4? You go to settlement, push one button, and go away exploring, you know, doing fun things and such, with the ability to sort it out later without problem, when you will want to mess with inventory a bit.
---
How it is in Fallout 76? You, with overweight fight scorchbeast with your fists, because your hammer have broken, go to camp by foot without sptrint and spend another 15 minutes sorting and with tears scrapping valuable items just because you have no place in stash.
---
The game NEEDS unlimited stash. It is just required for the gameplay to work!
---
I've had raids go bad and I've had deaths before I could make it to a stash.
---
It honestly goes both ways.
---
Once I killed a dude who dropped over 1000 waste acid. Kind of felt bad about that one but then again why on Earth would you carry around 1000 waste acid??
---
Players of all consoles can claim them if you have a PC to play them on...beleive me, you don't want to play these games on a console.
---
We're doing it anyway, SBQ is just reskinned dragons from ES.
---
For myself the lower levels felt slower.  I suggest to stick with one and change points instead of picking cards when you level after 50.  You will still get packs every 5 levels to help you out with perks.
---
Ouch, RNG is RNG after all. It took like 20 tries for me to even get Patrol to start then I got it on my 3rd run. But 16 of the same plan? Damn that's lousy.
---
Steve is lovely!
---
I think the blueprint feature was clearly in this scope of thought but it would be way better to establish a second one with a Choice for little or no portability but greater budgets and functionalities, that concept could bridge the gap between the epicness of a super permanent hub base and mobile camps. 
---
"Successfully" by who? All those people running around in Excavator that have to stay in the PA or log off and back on if they want to fast travel? Or people who just dump everything if it's not 3 star best in slot item? I shouldn't need to draw up spreadsheets to figure out how to manage my inventory. Many people just won't be bothered with it.
---
My stash is getting maxed. I've bulked everything but you just can't sell it fast enough.
---
Let‚Äôs make positive noise so they do. 
---
"the tse's are needed!" lol
---
So, for understanding, to learn some mod it‚Äôs not necessary that this mod should exist in the item being scrapped? You mean that it‚Äôs ok to craft lots of similar items and just by chance some mods will be learnt during scraping?
---
By the way don't say anything negative of you'll get downvoted.

It was probably killed on its way to your camp it happens to me with an albino deathclaw I gave him an hour and checked my camp, he wasn't there so I back tracked towards where I tamed it and I found a dead albino deathclaw which I'm assuming was mine amongst a group of dead super mutants and 3 with low health. I must have just missed it.

Bethesda,
---
I play on ps4.
---
I Love fallout76
---
   Just wana say thanks for working hard fixing bugs and glitches. Im not  concerned about the glitches or bugs so much i know eventually it will all be worked out.  Im lvl 115 i play as a sniper sneak build no power armor unless its a nuke zone. I have 90 percent of the game completed. I love the play style of the game but i feel everything is so easy to complete at my lvl. I  struggle to find a good challenge. Im all about pvp for end game. The workshops is supposed to encourage pvp but the way it is set up i must claim the other players workshop before i can kill the previous owner. Most build houses or block workshop so im forced to get a bounty on me before i can claim it. I jump servers just to find owned workshops to take trying to instigate pvp. Problem is its rare to find any workshops that is actually being defended. There should be a bigger incentive for players using workshops. I spent 2k caps last week just porting around taking workshops from other players with little gain or effort. I did get 3 good pvp encounters thats alot time and caps i invested for such little pvp action. I feel that if a workshop is claimed and that player is in that workshops area i should be able to kill him as long as im also in that area. Also i shouldn't receive a bounty for lock picking a door or destroying any player made workshop items especially if its used to block acess to the workshop bench.  Instead maybe make it so once i attack a workshop item me and owner of workshops is automatically flaged for pvp.  Im very excited about your new pvp mode but im very concerned about the duping thats been going on. I feel this pvp mode should not be released until all forms of duping has been patched out of the game. I hope that those that choose to play this new pvp mode must make a new character that is restricted to the pvp servers only. This will prevent players from bringing in duped items from your normal mode servers  and force all those that want to pvp to really work for all there loot. My sniper rifle does over 900 damage, 3.5 times that if im in sneak and its nightime. Id love to bring that gun to pvp mode and one shot every player i see but honestly it be much more fun to lvl up with new characters loot and pvp as we go. 
---
In closing if you can bring harder challenges to end game play and give us pvp that has risk and reward ill be hooked on fallout76 for years to come.
---
Thanks Bethesda.
---
I meant more the profits from killing other players but that sounds good too.
---
sometimes using vats will.glitch.you through solid.objects to reach your target too....i always wonder what the other players around me think..it probably looks like i just teleported to my enemy..iv even glitched through small.windows to.my target lol
---
Excellent, lots of sound ideas regarding workshop continuity so we can actually build them up into really cool bases made by groups going around the past couple days. All of this fits in the feedback category that we want more permanent impacts on the world and other players. Constructing our one camp with its current features is a great starting point and bigger versions need to happen. 
---
i think 2se nerf is okay but drop rate nerf is not. why normal players suffer from duplication problem? 
---
Yeah... i know
---
Damnnnn you found the body, that's rough lmao. Honestly I wouldn't even be surprised if he just glitched out and went about his business
---
\*Cure a disease (parasites)\*

"Damn, I've run out of water. Oh, there's a river over there, I could have a drink"

\*drink\*   
---
YOU HAVE CONTRACTED PARASITES 
---
I couldn't name it better - 100% agree! Nerfing is not a solution when you leave unfixed other problems (overpowered melee, bobbleheads stacking etc.). I hate melee and I'm not even try to make character that utilize that and after nerf my guns will barely scratch SBs...
---
I mean continuously, the PA is strong, so is the raider armour, both are very durable. The raider armour had no problem standing up against a scorch beast. I meant a bear is one of the few animals that can wreck your PA, give it enough time and enough hits.
---
Yeah saw a group of super mutants and just couldn't over come his primal instincts and just had to attack... And loose.
---
Lmao F
---
Kinda think your lying isn't the bounty 10 caps per object you destroy

Got mine yesterday!!

I got in a server and there was a nuke event over whitespring l. I went to the enclave bunker and the mod was there for about 600 caps.
---
Stand still and take little damage in PvP, but people don't understand that you can force movements.
---
Yep, I've seen it. Me and a few friends ran along his route at separate corners of the map last night and this morning, looking for him. Determination and that map, weren't enough. There has to be a better way!
---
Cause maybe he didn't fck you base up and some mobs did
---
No, you sure you didn't accidentally drop the weapon, store it or if your carrying a ton of them its still in your inventory?
---
Because I'm a raider duh
---
Yes, but they're needs to be a "lock" feature *and* a "favorite" feature. Otherwise you would only be able to lock like 9 things.
---
I'd say otherwise. I play the majority of the game in a hazmat suit.
---
Meh 600 is more than enough. Quit whinning.
---
Where do you claim them? And yeah I can imagine. I do own 2, just not the rest
---
2. Fix the Salvaged Assaultron Head? I dont have any complaints otherwise atm I can think of.
---
rifle and explosive perks
---
Power armor can have a chest piece mod that auto stims too, but I don't know why anyone would use that over the other chest pieces.
---
Honestly these have always felt really forced to me. Like they're popular or something because they insist on being so. That being said, yeah, I'm getting that Mothman one. 
---
if someone drops 1k of something, i like to think of it as an important lesson not to carry around all of your junk... 
---
after killing a wanted player i sometimes see 500 steel and bulk lead and that‚Äôs when i feel a little bad for taking it when i know how much ammo i can make from it and how long it takes me to farm 500 steel and lead for my 50 cal.
---
Well I‚Äôm sticking with watts because that‚Äôs the thing people can relate too. 
---
It even better when the have a Brahmin or a tamed creature gimme all your plastic or the mole rat gets it 
---
Then make it MOPP gear.
---
Dude im on psn, if you want an hazmat suit I cam give you one.
---
The silo thing is doable alone, dont worry. Ive done it around level 50. 
---
If you need help for the queen, add me.

---
Hopefully it‚Äôs for some future event. 
---
Overall legendary mobs are way too many.What does "legend" mean to you ? Something RARE and SPECIAL. The stuff of LEGENDS.
---
Checked everywhere and still could not find it. Also I recall that if I dropped an equipped weapon, I would be empty handed. I got switched to another weapon in my inventory in this case. 
---
At level 85, I'm on 5/10.... And don't actually recall seeing any! 
---
Damn, I'm soo keen to have that black X-01 painting that is no longer available. I have enough atoms, but they remove it from the shop :(  I can even "trade" for Patriotic or Tricentennial one...
---
Lol 
---
Oh, so all types except for one?
---
üñï 
---
Looks like you are still here tho
---
ahhh so the tesla comes under rifle perks..thnx
---
I did this early on, so many tries. I can't complete "Kill a Windigo While Wearing a Clown Cosrume." Everyone i complete it (3 times now) it just resets. I ended up just stop tracking it.
---
**"Shutting down the government until we can build a wall around fissure site prime!!"**
---
(spoiler alert: it'd be just about as effective)
---
Fr they're mad annoying. Especially when you're not trying to engage with them. They attack on site too and from most of my experiences they float above me and spam the Sonic boom shout or whatever
---
Clear your cache, do a hard reset, worst case reinstall. I have two XB1's and it works fine. Sure it crashes but maybe once a week or a few times a week.
---
I decided to be a Raider during BETA. Shotgun/explosive build, I wear a mismatched set of armor (or a straight jacket), I use the Raider Power Armor, my raider base has some torture rooms, and my gamertag has Raider in it... But all of this is only for the show!  
---
I can't bring myself to be a bad guy and, in my 125 levels, I have never attacked anybody. I killed a few people with a bounty because they requested it, but my main raider RP activity is to give people I meet some chems (and plans, ammo).  
---
I guess it goes well with the raiders in game and their storyline.
---
The attack was actually nerfed! It was waaaay worse when the game came out.
---
Now you can see the rings pattern and avoid the attack.
---
There are no damage perks for energy
---
Correct. 
---
YES. Or, at the very least, the option to disable team invites (I always feel like an asshole for ignoring them, but social anxiety and all).
---
i see.  cool
---
Next time somebody steals a legendary in front of me I will track down their camp location and blow up their rad shower. Enjoy hunting down those flux the same way you hunt down my legendaries.
---
BETA lol.. except for the lighthouse mothman. Wether on main or mule I ever saw him - just my BETA character saw a Stalking one.     
---
     
---
But one of my friends saw him at his camp a few hours ago.
---
Duh!
---
I go most of my level ups from 7-32 there
---
no but the teslanis considered a rifle apparently ? so i use rifle perks yeh
---
Vengeful Mothman actually surprised me at my CAMP today.
---
I think there was this level of crazy during No Man Sky but that game deserved it back then with the false promises, this game most of the outrage is kinda just fanboys and casuals crying for little stuff, no one bother to think a company that never did online ever was able to do it and make a huge map that was somewhat playable at launch.
---
He can attack your camp?!
---
Or just stop using Two Shot or Explosive weapons
---
But yet they do. Plenty of players play without PA and not everyone uses Excavator that does use PA. Do you need to carry 5 weapons, do you need 5 stashed? I play successfully. There are others in this subreddit as well. And yes, I do wish we had more "space." But if we got everything we wanted in this game (just read the whining daily,) would it be fun? Games that are too easy get boring. Games that make you use a strategy are more fulfilling. 
---
Our opinions differ, however, we still play the game in front of us. 
---
Yeah, should be a system like this
---
I have a Excell file with every mod and weapon &amp; gun plus crafting recipe and legendary effects and it's less than 1mb.  The idea that our stash is taking up "server space" is just foo-foo.  This is a issue, but not a "space" issue.
---
The only camps you will find me smashing up are the ones right outside the windows of the Golf Club in Whitesprings; don't really see a reason to ever smash up a home otherwise since there is no caps in it for you. My current character is full atom shop bright metal with Raider PA only and I plan on rocking raider themed items forever even if they are weaker.
---
Yes
---
Pikachu meme*
---
Endgame is most certainly not built around power armor. You can get much higher damage resist out of power armor than you can get in power armor
---
since drills are level 20+ you‚Äôd have to go with your bare fists until you get the drill, that should keep things interesting
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure most do, around 15%
---
Nice that isn't too bad. I should have that. 
---
YongYea is the best ASMR channel on Youtube. Puts me right to sleep with his alien voice
---
Just because you're not having any issue doesn't mean many people aren't. And it doesn't mean the game isn't losing players left, right and center from all of these issues combined. It's not opinion, it's fact. There are many people crippled by the weight limits. And playing a game like that won't last long.
---
I carry 1800 lbs all the time, but I use the excavator PA which can carry about 450 with my perks, plus I have 1 shock which pushes it around 500. What I do sometimes is clear all my junk and move it to my alt character and start again. As long as your weight us under 4 x your carry weight you can walk around semi encumbered just fine, it's a little inconvenient but fine.
---
Mine isn't a huge gamer either (just the Sims when I'm at work) but she just likes it as something to do together, figuring that if she wasn't doing it with me I'd probably be doing it anyway. She only plays when I do but that's okay, we have a lot of fun. She accidentally picked an owned lock yesterday so I shot her in the head to be nice. Which is a sentence I never thought I'd type.
---
None of this is feasible without a serious stash limit increase
---
I dont talk about legendary enemies in general. I am talking about 3 star legendary enemies. These are rare and should therefore wield better loot.
---
i‚Äôve got attacked twice, annoying as hell on lower levels.
---
It's lovely!
---
A whole new generation of gamers is playing is all. Case in point: turning to an ameteur video platform for gaming reviews. Or social media.
---
There was a time when pieces of coloured paper (thats magazines im reffering to, older folk will know what I mean) where they had to compete for your attention with quality reviews, and not some trigger happy, sensationalist BS that draws in the masses.
---
In magazines the type of reviews you woild find on youtube nowadays had their column: "Readers Reviews".
---
My what a time to be alive.
---
ok, show me how you kill a queen without it. and without melee OPs.
---
Long shot but does any of this interest you? http://imgur.com/a/RQp8LUz
---
over 600? I doubt it.
---
I just spent 45 minutes loading in, controller freezing.   Loading in, controller freezing.  Loading in, controller freezing and then being killed by ghouls.   Loading in, controller freezing on top of two other players who loaded into the same spot and their controller froze.  I‚Äôm done for today.
---
You do realize that crafting batches for UC ammo are generally larger than normal batches (excepting 5mm/50) right?  They use the same amount of materials (except the flux and UC) to make more ammo than normal. 
---
I would prefer if we‚Äôre going to change it, to have them do regular damage to normal enemies, a small boost (like 25%) to Scorched enemies, and a large boost (50-100%) to damage to Scorchbeasts, perhaps even differentiate between regular SB‚Äôs and the SBQ. 
---
Weird never had that happen before I know I did trades on a laggy server and never saw the item in my inventory but others could, but switching servers I was able to see the weapon, guessing switching servers and your weapon is still gone?
---
Yes those changes sound like they have the biggest "frustration caused by the issue / time to fix it" ratio. Rebinding shouldn't be something we have to beg for, several months after the game is released. Several years if you take Fallout 4 into consideration.
---
Just like you I sent feedback too (as a ticket). 
---
Maybe not 2x, but 1,5x damage would be welcomed change. 
---
As we speak about prime receiver - can someone confirm that changing to prime receiver you can't change it back to any "normal" (by crafting or modding)?
---
Unlike Scorched Recievers, Prime Recievers are really useful !       
---
Their damage is comparable to hardened (mostly similar, sometimes a bit better or worse) but it deals **50% extra damage to scorched** which is extremely useful vs Scorchbeast Queens. Also in most cases they positively affect the maximum duration.      
---
      
---
The downside is the ammo crafting costs for it's manageable for slow firing non auto weapons like lever or hunting rifle, double barrels, etc. Non-auto Handmades &amp; other Shotguns are ok too. But a Prime 50cal eats way too much ultracite ammo / fluxes...
---
Damn dude, that‚Äôs crazy....everyone was on yesterday and even earlier in the afternoon. 
---
Christ... what is going on today.
---
Define issue? We ALL have the 600lb limit. We have limits depending on what we have equipped on our person. This is not an issue. It is a game design. And yeah, you are right. It is a FACT that all of us have to adhere to. 
---
This little section of the internet we call reddit does not encompass all FO76 game players. 
---
If you can get into the meetings at bethesda where they look at metrics with reasons for people leaving the game, then you can successfully say your opinion has merit. Until then, it's all conjecture and people complaining on the internet. 
---
Its too easy too click before you think. That is one part of the issue. 
---
I wonder how I would have turned out as an adult if I had been born in the post-internet era, i.e. the age of likes, instant gratification, etc.
---
Was considering coming back to the game when they added new content, but for sure not coming back now, I spent a huge amount of time farming those weapons and threw away everything else I got. What is even the point of farming legendaries now if it's all just the same crap. There's no end game and they kill the last bit of end game there was with this nerf. This is what happens when a company with no experience or knowledge of multiplayer games makes one. They are going through the same decades of mistakes made by other game devs, but with added incompetence and greed on top.
---
Top of the world middle level, loads of ski equipment in the circle outside of the rooms and inside. Ski lodge next to Top of the world. Ski lodge below top of the world.
---
Ski's, ski poles, ski outfits all count. I collected all 50 at top of the world and the building next door with the bot vendor, check the vendor room as well as the room next door to it plus the middle level of top of the world. Also there some on Rose's level if no one has taken it.
---
I did this myself last night and let me tell you it wasn‚Äôt easy, the place is a total maze, it took me 35mins, the best advice I could give to anyone who‚Äôs not done it yet is to fix the cooling towers first by accessing them from the outside, which is much easier. After that head straight for the security office which is down a dark corridor form the main entrance, when there access the security terminal and unlock all security doors, also you can access the control room using the stairs at the back of the security office. Once you‚Äôve done that just look for the signage on the walls, that will direct you to the rooms your looking for. When you get to the rooms just repair the broken pipes and terminals. You don‚Äôt need to repair them all once you‚Äôve done that head back to the security office head up the stairs into the control room and restart. Hope this helps someone. Poseidon is a pain first time.

The first bag doesn‚Äôt disappear, just the tracker moves to the new bag. Although it can drop through the world if you die again nearby, which is why I at least always run to pick the bag up even if I‚Äôm going to die again just so it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
exactly. The problem will be that there are only melee builds left that can fight scorched queens. That is sad since the games best points is the diversity around the builds. having rifle,shotgun,heavy weaponry etc.  which will be unsuable post patch for the endgam.
---
I'll be more careful from now on. The game nearly tricked me after I ordered a government drop and there was one already there. Mine landed on top of it a minute later. Whatever happened to the red letter warning of stealing?
---
Best part is that this thing has unlimited range
---
I just spent the last 45 minutes dealing with the freezing controller during gameplay bug.  I‚Äôm done for tonight.
---
Ha the technical data, everytime I pick a new one it replaces the old one.
---
That would be lovely! Would you like some springs in exchange?
---
Actual though laugh at them until they had the whole screen and you die of poison damage
---
If the gun does not have any other receiver than prime they yes, you cant switch. For normal guns I think it work both ways.
---
Console players are generally much more toxic than PC, expect lots of kids with alot of anger to take out on others. I've never had a griefer hit my camp on PC in around 350 hours of gameplay.
---
 As for the fixing the issue I would suggest just moving to a more remote location, I'm sure a number of high level players go to the island just to farm the drops from the deathclaws there. It's usually always high levels that grief from what I've read from reddit posts so if you stay away from places that attract them you should be golden.
---
happened to me and other users. these posts never get on the front page so Bethesda never hears about it.
---
would be nice if an official account saw this.
---
I don't have a physical copy of the game, so is it really too soft?
---
Have you seen what players are like? I think he's safer in there!! The lucky guy has every item in that room without grinding.

That is not always true, my Single Action Army can switch between Prime and regular.

Its Bandits like you...........that make me love this game!!! Saints, sinners and everything that is in between, makes this game interesting for me. While am   
---
not a Bandit or a Saint myself. I welcome every encounter i have with players or AI that make my time interesting.
---
Apparently. Happened on the western outskirts of Whitesprings by the cliffs.
---
It was either I was super close to a spawn point or he is in fact able to spawn as an enemy that attacks your CAMP.
---
Either way, the guy came knocking.
---
I know statistics. I know whatever one person experiences many others also experience. I know the reasons I'll be quitting. I know the reasons that would have made many quit by now if they weren't as forgiving of imperfections as I am. Crashes, disconnects, inventory limits, these are all reasons, and then the nerfs. Nerfing XP, making levelling more tedious. Making changing your skill points around more tedious. Making changing your build more tedious. Nerfing loot, that people have spent months grinding to acquire. Not only nerfing it, but nerfing it intro the ground. First Fireproof. With dense chest mod makes the explosive part irrelevant in PvP. Then 25% and 20% to Two-Shot and Explosive. Some people ground for months to get one of those on a weapon. I know games and I know players. And people sitting in a meeting obviously don't.

Odd coincidence that you mentioned this since like 15 min ago that happened to me for the first time.
---
Was in sugar grove and teleported my own personal non-existing upper floor. Fell down a place i should have a key to in normal circumstances.
---
I'm not worthy üò£
---
Because people are bored and raiding CAMPS is part of the game. People have good loot and nothing to use it on, so they attack other players bases hoping for a fight. 
---
I think they nerfed them you can thank the dupers, Bethesda thinks punishing everyone for a group is the best choice instead of just nerfing the dupe combo weapons. Like events that usually almost always gave 3 star legendary like the queen, awol robots, etc now love to drop 1 star crap from 3 star lvl 60+ legendary. They are going nerf this dumpster fire into whats the point of farming and grinding if I'm rewarded with trash.
---
They should just disable PvP damage entirely for players who have a bounty over their own caps; that way there is none of these issues with players abusing lack of caps. That way they get wanted but do nothing to people or structures so the person being attacked can then kill them for the tiny amount of caps they are attempting to abuse; if they end up with no caps at all they can't even deal damage to begin with.
---
Have only tried it on a Mr.Gutsy
---
Got 5 of them at once one day.. Completed the 'mission'. No rewards, no message, nothing. Totally dissapointing.
---
Both. I spent the better part of a month gathering materials and building and scrapping light arms to get every armor mod learnable by scrapping. Marine requires asbestos and robot requires circuits, both were hard to farm. I'm on to doing the same for weapons now. Here's a link to the spreadsheet I made to help learn mods and plans: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
I want to be 100% sure, because I've heard different opinions. Handmade surely have many receivers and I learned all of them (Hardened for sure). As for Gauss I've got normal capacitors mod in the stash, so there should be possibility to change it back.
---
Next time I'm at my camp I'll grab one and test it out on a few things
---
But it's called fissure site prime because it's where the scorch beasts first came from.
---
Brilliant idea. That'd make for a badass addition to the game.
---
You're telling me, imagine wtf is happening to the wildlife in Australia. It took nuclear war for all other species to even catch up.
---
Not trying to encourage on exploiting the game. Sometimes you just don't know with Bethesda on what they view as a bug or feature.
---
Totally my mistake. its not bulk
---
Yes please 
---
And what did Graham ever do to you?
---
I'm not gunna lie, I've been here for like an hour doing no work trying to spot your stealthy friends.
---
I'll trade for the MMG.
---
Handmade can. I‚Äôve removed the prime mod off of one I bought, then added it back on later after I learned it. 
---
I would assume the same for Gauss if you know any other capacitor mods. 
---
Its simple 100cap bounty for camp destruction, 1/2 scrap, 1/2 caps, guns/armor break 100%faster, thirst/hunger increase 100%.  Yes I know there is a perk card.  
---
Let me say this bethesda, totally screwed the pooch on this game. They included features that what it would appear the majority doesnt want/like (pvp).  Going forward they are  listening a little to the community but stop listening when it comes to pvp.
---
PVP is going to be part of this game.  Bethesda wants it.  Making us fight each other is cheaper than developing say a Nuka World type DLC.  They are hoping it has replayability like a bf or cod.   Comes down to money they want yours for as small as an investment as possible and they feel pvp is the tool to that means.
---
Im fine with that adjustment as long as the name is changed. There cannot be a receiver named prime, and another receiver that is better than the prime receiver and that is not named superprime. I just cant stand the prime name next to what appears to be useless.
---
I say authenticate and remove items from game all together; in a lorish way, be that through camps train station, or even just dig a hole. 
---
i don't think they can increase it until they manage the cheating, or at least curb it. they are already addressing this. perhaps another increase is soon, that depends on the effect of their methods.
---
Super-mutants are like this generations killer-bees. Humans created them and we who had nothing to do with it have to deal with it.
---
Okay, I believe you /s
---
I did this once when I saw a lvl 1 player in the vault so I left a bunch of useful shit outside for him to pick up and waited above the entrance in sneak. I never saw the player but I saw his icon on the map and his name tag and health bar and his icon moving on the compass but he was invisible so either new players are in a different instance of the server or it was a glitch. He never saw my bag or just ignored it, in any case.
---
I agree but the crackers are spilt. The time we went at the holes was ripened. Hence the melting upon an summers eve
---
awesome thx for confirmation!
---
I can help on PC. IGN: jchamlin. There is a learn chance on the combat helmet, it takes about 5-6 on average to learn to make them.
---
THe current way to deal with this bad design choice or bug is to use powerful endgame weaponry. which are the TSE rifles. With that you can get rid of these annoying beasts. But thanks to the next patch even this option will end because the entire tier of endgame weapons will be trashed. 
---
so there will be only two options left 1) run or die 2) throw away your current build and switch to melee which is OP.
---
After buying my TSE felt like doing events like Uranium Fever just feels pointless. After they nerfed AWOL legendaries from always dropping 3 star item to almost always now dropping a 1 star item feels even more pointless to do events. Queen is like the only event I feel people being involved is still a valid thing.
---
He‚Äôs an idiot and probably doesn‚Äôt realise that nukes would only make ISIS stronger. 
---
Oh ill "join" alright, just let me know where your camp is at first. I cant join a team with you because I have lone wanderer on though.
---
From the Bethesda Net Launcher, sign in with your Bethesda UN and PW and you'll automatically have them in your library. Just click to download.
---
would you trust Graham around your pets? I wouldn't.
---
The Marine Tactical Helmet has a plan. The Marine Armor Helmet is a (possibly) dev room item that you learn to make by scrapping just one of them.
---
My stat suggestion is for a single receiver that effects up to 4 different classes of enemies differently. 
---
Regulars +0% 
---
Scorched +25% 
---
Scorchbeasts +50% 
---
SBQ +100% 
---
We definitely will need a buff for primes after the TSE nerf, or a nerf on the SBQs DR buffing, otherwise scorched earth will be damn near impossible (assuming it doesn‚Äôt glitch and become impossible anyhow like it does occasionally now). 
---
I did this once when I saw a lvl 1 player in the vault so I left a bunch of useful shit outside for him to pick up and waited above the entrance in sneak to see what would happen. I saw his compass icon leave the vault and moving away but I never saw his model so either that's just a glitch or new players don't see anybody else either.
---
Maybe if you throw away any sense of logic or reasoning. Holy hell.
---
The only bad experience I‚Äôve had was two guys over level 100 who showed up right after I claimed a workshop, waved and moved on, then came back 15 min later after I got my extractors and turrets set up and stomped my level 25 ass in three seconds
---
It works, I came to suggest the same thing.
---
Yeah...but you have to find one first.
---
Hey I do think that placing cables in F76 is more complicated than placing cables IRL, dont be so hard for yourself
---
Same. I only picked this up maybe a week ago but im around 45 and have only met nice people. I know one of my favorite times was finding a lvl 16  and giving him a full set of raider power armor i had found.
---
Play to your strengths. That is key. What aspect of the game do you think she would be interested in? Focus on showing her it but importantly, not forcing her to make choices. Involve her in your gaming as a spectator until she makes the push.
---
My husband let me watch him play games when we were early days. I freaking love a good story and interesting narrative. The first game I consciously decided to pick up and play for myself happened to be Fallout 3 and I. Was. Hooked. Story was sooo good and I soon found something else I loved about the game - the exploration. Open-world games are my jam. I want to find *everything.* He never pressured me into making decisions. I was free to take it as far as I wanted to go and I liked that. 
---
I will try it thank you :)
---
I'm at 7 of ten, and I cannot find anymore!
---
I know you can get close or barely over power armor damage resist, but then you have to waste so many cards on protection then damage or weight reduction and armor can be annoying to repair then power armor since you need ballistic weave.
---
So now you have thrown in other reasons, not just the weight. Those I do agree with. I too get tired of the resets, and I'm on Xbox. I have never seen a multiplayer game do this on a non PC platform. As for the nerfing, yes, it affects all those that have made it to let's say mid level, who now will see a slow down on their efforts to proceed at the same rate as those who have benefited from the grind. 
---
I hate the perk cards and having to switch them out depending on what I'm trying to accomplish. 
---
Now, those TSE weapons. They need some nerfing. They do make this game way too easy. Agree?
---
I'm betting Bethesda uses the agile business model. I haven't searched it out, but seeing as how it seems this game was rushed to finish and now needs constant attention, it would not surprise me. 
---
All that being said, it is the game we have in front of us. Tweaks will be made. This person will be satisfied, this one will not. Will everyone ever be satisfied? Impossible. We all have different wants and needs. Sure some are common but what you see as a priority, someone else may not. 
---
I bought the blueprint with a low level alt and traded it to myself via a friend
---
Because it forces me to play as Oscar the Grouch.
---
The fact that this song wasn‚Äôt included in the game SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS EVENT is a shame.   
---
Could play ‚ÄúDark as a Dungeon‚Äù for the Lode-Baring event on the rare occasion it pops up. 
---
I should have said. This imgur list was from my post. I'm using that trying to get a DC gauntlet with the same perks (for asthetic reasons). I don't really want to give it up until I have something to replace it. Sorry
---
I will address your edits first I guess.
---
I never used any ‚Äúbut I know a guy‚Äù arguments. My opinions are based on my 20 years of online game experience and nothing else.
---
And yes I understand your using a probability argument. You don‚Äôt have much choice considering there are no actual facts to support either point of view, despite you presenting that view as fact starting with your flawed cost of entry argument. I simply don‚Äôt agree that kids are more toxic than adults in online games, and that there are enough of them to warrant someone taking that into consideration when picking their gaming platform. Even if they are, and the argument is that they grow out of it, then I could similarly argue that just because someone wasn‚Äôt a toxic gamer as a kid doesn‚Äôt mean they cannot be a toxic gamer as an adult. Kids can be well behaved, grow up, and then start doing bad things. It happens all the time, you‚Äôll find many of them in prison if you would like evidence of this. 
---
I bring up the master race thing because it is an example of immature thought and speech on the part of PC players. So yes, it does belong in a conversation about the maturity and toxicity of a player base based on platform. It doesn‚Äôt trigger me, and it wasn‚Äôt bait.
---
Ive already stated I find the toxicity equal. But I can go into more detail if that matters. 
---
For PC I find most of the toxicity to be text based starting with games like team fortress and diablo 2, then playing various MMO games and other diablo clone looter games, a few other shooters. 
---
For console obviously its mostly people with mics as most games don‚Äôt have a global chat. As for games its been mostly shooters I guess, battlefield, cod, destiny, pretty much anything with a focus pvp brings out the toxic people in droves on console. The cooperative games ive played are no where near as bad, such as dragon age, mass effect, the division.
---
So overall, my experience has been that PC will be toxic no matter if its co-op focused or pvp, if it has a text chat its going to have a lot of nonsense in it. Console anything with pvp and mics and your in for some lovely conversation. 
---
Regardless, I don‚Äôt really see one as worse than the other, toxic people will be toxic on whatever platform they play on. All platforms have options to report toxic players and either block their chat or mute them. I have done both many times.
---
So I don‚Äôt see any reason to encourage someone to make a platform choice based on personal observation of the toxicity level of the player base. 
---
We obviously are not going to agree on this, so I will just leave this conversation. Also I am not a fan of having to look through older messages to see if they have been edited and need a response to what was put in.
---
So good day/night, I have some Hulu to watch.
---
Maybe Ill just follow suit. I just created a post about nerfing the fun out of the game:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aikz1o/bethesda\_stop\_nerfing\_the\_fun\_out\_of\_this\_game/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aikz1o/bethesda_stop_nerfing_the_fun_out_of_this_game/)
---
But only the chorus on loop
---
Genius idea right here. Adds a whole new dimension to Melee and Hand to Hand combat. Not to mention it would have a lot more people experimenting with the timing in blocking‚Äôs melee attacks. 
---
"sleep"
---
&gt;heartache
---
By the number?
---
I ran through the Golf Club a couple days ago and I kid you not, every single ghoul that spawned was a level 9 unruly golfer. Strangest thing ever. Also strange was as soon as I walked out the back door, every ghoul respawned instantly at the correct levels. Super weird.
---
This is a great idea, it would make fallout be a true fallout, and feel it like into little diamond city or megaton :)
---
They are massive creatures that fly. Why have they never migrated to other, more radiated parts of the US or the world? 
---
Are we seriously made to believe that in the events of the base game/future DLC the Vault 76ers hunt them to extinction? 
---
Also, literally no point in giving them fev/radiation; only there for the reason ‚Äúthe govt/enclave is a dick‚Äôs head‚Äù
---
I'm not gonna lie, all the mutant slaying garbage I've been getting reminded me of the show 
---
I've a feeling if there's ever a Mutant equivalent to the Scorchbeast Queen, a Mutantslayer will rise up.
---
Those would be some really small suits. 
---
Honestly Bethesda needs to permanently fix duping, what is the point of having game testers if they can't break the game to find most duping methods, then they need to balance legendaries so not 1-2 are top dog and rest are shit, like junkie legendary if your addicted to everything the damage bonus is still not worth all the negative effects from being addicted. Then when they fix most bugs, add more end game content, story, level 4-5 legendaries, higher level cap then nerfing can be a thing. Its like they are focusing on pvp and everything else to the point nothing is really getting fixed/primarily focused on. Short, if they can fix duping forever and raise level cap of weapons to 70 or higher it would make most of the duper weapons still good but not god. They should also scale enemies, like level 1 will see level 1 in the noob areas and a level 160 will see a 160 so there not just getting bored oneshotting all the crap scorch.
---
I am on PS4 ..
---
I've had bad luck. Did silo solo, game crashed right before launch. Found an ongoing SBQ, hopped in, helped, she did the stretched out glitch thing, kept shooting until she "died" (but still all stretched across map), ran up &amp; down stretched dead SBQ hoping to find her loot, to no avail, then game crashed. I haven't tried to launch again since, but going to try again soon. [PS4]
---
AMAZING!
---
K I sent an add cya in 3hrs+
---
sorry dude i needed it on PS4 and i traded last night.
---
I wanted to share videos that weren't negativty spewing hate fests that were still critical of fallout and also had a bit of humor. My bad. I should have skipped  mentioning yongyea. I think I'll delete that part
---
&gt;The time we went at the holes was ripened. Hence the melting upon an summers eve
---
ok. if possible at all you will need a whole set of 3 star armor to find and yes you will loose a tremendous amount of damage because of the perks needed to help you support that. In that way it becomes unsuable for the endgame because you need an extremely high damage output to kill high level glowing / scorched beasts effectively. 
---
Its an entire different thing for middle game enemies under 40. There you dont need pa
---
Sounds like a diehard
---
This seems pretty reasonable. 
---
Regarding crafting ammo, I don't craft ammo, I search for people who have the ammo I need and I buy it, last time I've been buyin ammo it lasted me for two weeks. With ultracite ammo, this is not possible yet, you don't just loot this ammo so nobody has a surplus to sell.
---
I never saw the appeal of those toys.
---
That being said, they did a fantastic job on these.
---
I must've been lucky then. I finished the quest first time.
---
Nice, only saw one time Grahm kickass some scorched in Charleston the dude killed all of them within less a minutes.
---
You had badluck that the Scorchbeast didn't land or your level or build was not on part to fight it?
---
I haven't played in the event but I use a TSE Western Revolver and always call out legendaries so others can get a tag in.  Even my team mates because sometimes we won't get an item even though we're in a team.
---
I've never seen the last four colorways but they surely would be amazing. 
---
If they exist, I' gonna leave all my social life and go full Fallout Mode till I find them

Man that is a rough one. I lost ALL my weapons at around lvl 200. I know the feeling.

Thanks man

This only works if you kill the mob with the vampire weapon. Last patched fixed stabbing the air and getting health back.

Nope, but I do have a lined vault suit

---
YOU HAVE CONTRACTED RAD WORMS
---
"SON OF A...."
---
Agreed. Having it on the 50 cal is a nightmare for me with ammo use. Works well with TS gatling gun though.
---
Yeah same. All legendary enemies, no matter how many stars, just feel the same to me other then SBQ. And really if the 3* legendaries were such a problem in the game they should have just left them always dropping 3* items and just made them spawn much less then they do. That way when I do stubble upon a 3* legendary enemy ill actually get exited instead of of just looking forward to decent exp.
---
It's SUPPOSED to spawn at least one violet on the golf course every time, there's exactly five snap tails that ought to change to flux versions but they all don't. If they did you could at least get one per nuke but you end up with like 4 with Green Thumb.
---
The golf course is actually loaded with Crimson if you need it. 
---
your best bet at finding a long term or even temporary team is to ask around the subreddit, i found my best online friends by replying to a couple team up posts and now we‚Äôve been running together almost daily for well over a month.
---
Melee is not OP.  Everything else is crap that needs to be fixed.
---
The more people flat opt out on a "raider server" theres more potential victims cycling through my gangs world. Raiders are described a having terrorized Appalachia, so that's what a gang can do to a server, a gang of 4 amounts to 1/6 the players on a server. 
---
Plus server hopping to avoid raiders is the game version of packing up and moving to diamond city. Safe, but boring. 
---
I can not switch back on my 50 cal MG but seems to work on my other weapons. It is also what I have read if I am not misstaken.
---
I don't mind that spot though I do think there's more flux at the Ferry.
---
I've seen exactly one Queen and the server was nowhere near finishing her off in time unfortunately.
---
Sorry B, I'll try to give you a heads up before I drop a ICBM on your pad =p
---
I want a car door shield. Then I can roll down the window and shoot through it, pew pew.
---
I‚Äôm having this exact issue in PS4. I‚Äôm in my 5th disconnect in 2 hours. Last log in I froze and died from nothing, logged back in to try and get my stuff and half of my screen was black and I got wrecked because I couldn‚Äôt see, so I tried closing the app and it logged in fine except I think it made my stuff from the death disappear, and I ended up freezing and dying for no reason again. I‚Äôm only level 10 and this is the second time I‚Äôve tried playing this game with horrible experiences. I think I‚Äôm done with it now. 
---
Still do it with pretty fair regularity.
---
300+ hours each in FO3, Skyrim and FNV form some hard habits to break.
---
Hmm. I'm not trying to be an ass or anything but do you have any sources about this stuff. I just wanna know for sure weather they and actually do or don't cause I don't know the facts, but I've done a lot of events and all different kinds but I've never had a legendary as a reward.
---
Eh sure, everyone gets that. I wanted to share the vids I thought managed to get the disapointment of this game across without turning to stoking outrage. And videos that managed to find good and humor in the game too even when it was at it's worse. I've updated my original post to reflect that intention a bit better, hopefully
---
Battle Bot has a fairly high chance to drop heavy weapons (capped at lvl40) and ammo. Usually 5mm, plasma cores or fuel. As for acid there's plenty workshops with acid extractor nodes!
---
 Plague walker is my friend
---
This could be a solution. Fix the duping first. Raise the level cap of the endgame weapons next. I like it!
---
I think that is the single most upsetting thing I've seen in the game.
---
It took me seeing it a few times before it really sank in...but then it started bothering me more and more.
---
It is so.  fucking.  dark.
---
in a way, PA-s already have legendary properties: in form on modifications you can install. i mean, +50 carry weight or ability to fly seem pretty legendary effect to me. Sure, it's just a one-star, but that'll do.  PA have healthy advantages over normal armor anyway.
---
there's ok abilities for chest and legs, and maybe the helmet, but hand modifications lack serious options. I think, there should be +reload speed or +swing speed etc options too. 
---
There is at least one.
---
how can you lose all weapons?
---
that would be awesome, but what about time zone - it's 10:53AM CET - will you be in the game when I'll be back from work around 6:30PM CET?
---
Seriously. One isn't that bad, but any more than that and it is like someone putting a strobe light right in your face. It's not even a challenge, just incredibly annoying and frustrating as you struggle to see anything. It is absolutely not fun or rewarding in anyway.
---
I can say the same thing, in the same situation,  I believe I did this quest while searching for the sword as well, and had absolutely no issue finding said ghouls, but I think I was a bit under leveled and it took some time to actually kill them. 
---
Yeah I mentioned all of those issues as reasons for people quitting in my first post. And I was just thinking how ironic this short term thing with the toys giving rad resistance is. They give toys and then take them away. And that's gonna make kids cry. Sure TSE needed some kind of nerf I guess, maybe as a combined effect. Not the individual effects as much as they are planning to do. But whatever, I still say wait and see how it goes. 
---
I'm in the process of managing my inventory that I have already spent hours on and made a tiny bit of progress but still something needs to change with stash and the weight of things. It's not fun spending hours trying to figure it all out. Some people can't throw stuff away. And RPGs are know for people hoarding. 
---
I have every bank slot in WoW, every empty character slot is either levelled up with full banks, or a low level mule, with also full banks. I have my own personal guild, with a guild bank. I collect rare sets that were later unavailable, and then I think readded after I stopped playing, but not 100% sure. Like Defias set and Scarlet Crusade set that I grinded for weeks to get every piece on the characters like Rogue and Paladin. I like to collect stuff and I like to grind and in Skyrim I had every book, and every armor set, and every weapon etc. That's how a lot of people play these games.
---
We have all these weight limit perks, Excavator with Calibrated Shocks and Motion Assist Servos. So we get to hoard. Then if we want to fight we have to remove all of those wight perks or our damage and defense sucks. And we can't fast travel with all perks, and fully modded Excavator, and Grilled Radstag, Radicool with 50% rads, Solar Powered, Black Diamond, Party Girl and Whisky, and maybe X-Cell or BuffOut etc. I know I can get rid of a bunch of stuff and I will but everybody knows we need more space. Even people who don't hoard like some of us, even they know we need more space.
---
Dense armor mods are the way 
---
Lol yea
---
You got a mirror for that
---
Eh. I don't think like this. I'm not going to lump people into generations. I found reviews I liked which didn't delve into outrage. That's the point of my post. (I edited my original post after your response to better get this point across, hopefully)
---
Xbox?
---
Youre insane. I have a tse prime .50, i can LITERALLY choose if i want the queen dead or not based on the others there. I have video of the combined damage of the team vs when i actually unload on her. Prime is king in SBQ fights, esepcially on the tse .50. Anything else is just a waste.
---
No. That is the price you pay for being immune to radiation.
---
I've actually yet to set up camp haha. But yeah it's just updating, having had the disk in for a while. I'll let you know when it works :)
---
Yeah i assumed it was supposed to be the case as you had to find the fissure sites and nuke them, like a long running quest at least to nuke every fissure site
---
How much caps for 'em?
---
No... But bows are held for as long as you press the trigger, which is fundamentally no different from a button layout standard.
---
Hate shitty houses too, but I fought against the raiders. And I think this is one of the best parts of gaming content. Do what you want and keep high ground.
---
happens to me as well, I remove it now just to log out, to avoid thinking about it on return (plus loading in is faster out of power armor. there are actually a lot of ways that glitches can affect normal players. if you notice an extra item every once in a while that is actually a form of duping. I've started pressing buttons much slower during crafting. 
---
Sn hour prepping for a nuke launch? Was this your first time in the silo?
---
once she took off to the lowest end of the map so far down that the quest marker was stuck on the edge of the map for the rest of the event. we stood there for full ten minutes without anything to kill and with radiation slowly building up waiting for something to happen
---
Yeah we do ot all the tike making ammo, lol
---
Me and my friend have seen exactly 0.
---
A few miles away from me there is a legitimate government nuclear shelter for sale - relic from the Cold War and still in perfect condition. Sleeps 300 apparently, has generators, filtration systems, broadcast rooms, the whole kit and kaboodle.
---
It's cheap at ¬£400,000 - anyone want to open a Vault hotel, restaurant and gift shop? :D
---
So you want them to redesign the map every week?
---
Any idea how much work is involved in that?
---
The story is supposed to be that they have a nest underground and the fissures are just where they pop out of from time to time. 
---
Given that it‚Äôs a relatively new problem, it makes sense they haven‚Äôt migrated yet. Not like they‚Äôve been flying around Appalachia for 25 years, it‚Äôs clear from the storyline that their disastrous effect on the surface was relatively recent, evidenced by the many intact corpses that litter various areas. 
---
The vault dwellers‚Äô goal is to prevent their spread, taking up the mantel from the BoS and Responders who failed before them. 
---
Yep, I like RPing, but I don't like ruining real people's day, so yeah, I guess I'm a soft raider.
---
How has this not gotten more notice?? The entire event itself more or less is finally do-able (on my mind, playing from PS4) after the most recent update and this is somehow a thing that can happen? Im beyond baffled
---
I've read about it yesterday on that same subreddit ;) I've got similar problem - launched my first ever nuke (solo) and when people started to gather to kill it, my server DC'ed. Since I haven't been in the team I just wasted nuke. Hope the others killed her and get the loot...
---
Well we've been promised another stash increase + vendors. So that would, of course, happen first. ~\o/~ 
---
Bows are present in both Skyrim and Oblivion. I can't remember how they worked in Oblivion, but in Skyrim you hold the draw for as long as the button is pressed, which is systemically the same thing. They'd be almost identical schemas. It's why I've been so frustrated with the lack of dual-wielding in the game. I can dual wield spells and swords, but not a pistol and sword? Two fist weapons???? 
---
The only difference is the way the zoom function triggers with weapons that have sights. But honestly, that could be tied to dual vs not as has been pointed out countless times. It wouldn't be any more difficult to make than the current system. 
---
Which because reddit is ass on mobile I misread as "maga sloth". I was worried for a moment
---
I can't comment on the WoW stuff. Never played. Wanted to but never got around to it. I did play Skyrim but apparently not to the level you did. I can see where the "trophy" factor can come into play. 
---
I do have inventory issues as well. Dumped some weapons I know I'll never use. Got rid of misc junk that was just taking space and will never be used. I had the same problems in FO4. I carried both wedding rings not knowing if I needed the 2nd for an unknown mission later. 
---
The latest toy rad thing. Not sure what their thinking was behind that. I scrap them for the screws. I'll pop a rad away if needed. 
---
I do agree the game needs adjustments. However, it is still playable (minus the crashes and exploits) in it's current form. It does take some strategy. 
---
Besides, if they gave us all our wants, this subreddit would die. 
---
Yeah I second this, bumped into someone with a two shot the other night, he started griefing me and my friends and had the tenacity to say we were awful peoples for shooting back. 
---
so my level 51 small melee build one shotting nearly everything with a one star weapon is not OP? sure.
---
If you use bloodied you can even generate 10-30K with one hit. Check here for details:

---
DR and ER have heavy diminishing returns past 300 either way, haven‚Äôt met a power armor user I can‚Äôt Double tap headshot kill with a standard hunting rifle with max perks plus tank killer

What platform are you wanting it on, if pc I‚Äôm sure cdkeys will have it cheap 
---
I know. 
---
Several of the games take place hundreds of years after 2077. I am curious as to why they aren‚Äôt a persistent ‚Äúfuture‚Äù problem. 
---
The Mic one would be really good! I really like this idea. 
---
Is it out of stock a lot of places. It's readily available pretty much anywhere in UK for &lt;¬£30.
---
The only rumour was a clickbait "media" outlet guessing that it might be going free to play because one distributor "recalled" physical copies in Aus.
---
This is not november and SQB alone is not enough to justify prime receivers. She now dies before 5 min mark passes usually. I'm not very keen to discuss mathematics with a person who started the discussion from 'youre insane'.
---
Anyway, the best weapons in game are made worse, not better, with prime receiver, so just because you found a single gun that has a single use with a prime receiver, is simply not enough to justify their existence,  IMO.
---
Also the era of TSE just ended, those guns became cheap so it might be justified to prime one of those. But a prime bloodied explosive shotgun? Abomination.
---
You just don‚Äôt use a two shot, they‚Äôre an awful creation. 
---
I really like this idea.
---
No patchnote out yet, only Bethesda message from last week.
---
A very easy approach to the pvp problem would be: remove the legendaries from pvp entirely. problem solved.
---
It's pretty annoying how restricting this subreddit can be. I wanted to show people a unique deathclaw trader I found but nope, no pictures.
---
Not sure how writing in an excel file is relevant here?
---
They arent just names on a spreadsheet, they are coded into the game, with in-game manerisms, images, stats etc. 
---
South Africa &gt;&gt;&gt;
---
The presumption is that we eliminate them. 
---
Unlike a regular FO title, we can‚Äôt have a big coup de gras at the end with a single boss battle ending the title because this is an MMO.  Had it been a regular title, killing the SBQ would have been the final mission in the main story, with minor work clearing out any stragglers, similar to eliminating the Institute/BoS/RR in FO4. 
---
I like really this idea.
---
mine is bugged :( 1 week now all 30 empty
---
This is where I got my copy (I paid about ¬£20 at the end of November thinking it couldn't possibly drop any lower than that lol)
---
Its dropped to ¬£9 now so if you're in the UK or using a VPN to activate the key I would highly recommend getting it here.
---
try making sure you have the materials in your inventory, not in your stash. Seems to be a common issue for crafting lately.
---
I really really like this idea. 
---
No, you've got it backwards.  He's gotten to, and through, the endgame.  He's got his infinite hoard, and now he just hangs out in his room banning hackers.
---
that was one of my points of stupid nerfs in another post. They are already rare to find so make them drop also rare loot. Not a 1 star wooden leg crap.
---
If your priorities in game are to hit 7 vendors but only drop one nuke, my man you are doing it wrong. Each nuke silo is 200 caps, and the queen is 200 caps. Why are you worried about flux farming when you'll get enough drops during queen runs to max out the vendors anyway?
---
Good story, sorry for your loss.
---
It was Icarus that flew too close to the sun, though.
---
Yeah no shit its not november. Thanks for the overabundance of news there. Takes 5 minutes if youre lucky and you have people there actually trying to kill her vs hiding in the shed.
---
"Discuss mathematics." Youre the one asking an ass a nine question about something self explanatory, you dont prime for EVERY creature, you prime 1 gun for 1 creature, her.
---
Anyways, youre wrong, so wrong its hilarious, for someone so sure of something you doubted enough to ask on a post you made, lmao.

Thanks for trying to take the "intellectual high road." On reddit, havent seen that one before.

The bottom list is obtainable if you like dealing with snakes, or the friends of snakes that broke into the Dev room. (i swear I just found it somewhere guys, really.

I want/ed fallout 76 to be a great game. To be the best game. But it‚Äôs just not. It‚Äôs a dumpster fire born out of the slothful laziness of Bethesda Game Studios, and it‚Äôs burbling distain for its player base. 
---
So, by all means, continue with the ad-homonym attacks, and I will continue to objectively evaluate the performance of this franchise. Let‚Äôs see who looks the bigger dope? Hmm?

not for long. After the next patch they will be nerfed to oblivion.

I'd love that.

They seriously need to add specific songs for certain events.

I'm still sitting here being furious that all my armor I'm wearing under my power armor doesn't work. When I LOSE carry weight because I put on power armor, there is something seriously wrong. That should not happen, IMO.

---
but I specifically recall seeing it in the patch notes
---
Beginning of your story seems legit, the rest is kinda... weird. It's a game, relax....
---
Honestly i expected a toxic shitshow when I first played it (as most open world games with even a whiff of PVP tend to become). Aside from two tandom TSE/bobblehead ganks the only real toxicity i see is people who have never played the game spreading shit about it
---
Because they would need to code an entire new feature. You may say it's easy to do and we can already color P armor,but not like this.
---
Then sadly bacause they want to make money out of cosmetics and this feature would cripple the earning of skins.

He's an asshole (not alt-right like the sjws claim, but still an asshole) who assumes he's the shining star of games journalism while twisting facts to fit his own narrative. Usually "big developers bad, indie is the Saviour of gaming and all female gamers are thots trying to exploit men"
---
I do it all the time. I am better at killing things out of power armor. The only thing PA does is give me extra times being hit before I die. But the only time this really becomes an issue for me is the rare high-level supermutant with a super sledge. Otherwise, I can rush in melee in my legendary armors and crush just about everything. I fought and killed mirelurk queens, scorchbeasts from 50 to 80, ghouls, glowing ones, wendigos, bears... 
---
Basically, PA is great, and I like it but it isn't game-changing. And it's super frustrating to lose all my awesome legendary effects every time I put it on.

You can find digital copies of the game for cheap if you look hard enough...unless you care about a physical case for a collection.
---
Yeah , buy from thieves, you will be back here crying about revoked keys....
---
I bought the game while drunk and I‚Äôve just kind of been going with it. I‚Äôve really enjoyed it so far. The story intrigued me, and I love crafting my own weapons, and I‚Äôll be happy to find more plans! (Silenced pipe revolver rifle is my baby arm.) the game has its flaws, and is far from perfect, but I don‚Äôt regret my purchase.
---
If it went over armor then it would have no effects.
---
I love it how shills are on threads like these like flies on honey

You're lucky, I swear I am being stalked by mothmen and one day, I'm gonna wake up in the dead of night and be murdered by one irl

I like the idea, i would like for this to happen but the issue would be how do we execute this, the best idea i can come up with would be to allow this only on preselected FLAT land in which camps cannot be placed on, these town settlements would be divided in a grid pattern, players would enter building mode in the town lots and see a highlighted green grid filled with equal sized squares,  players could then pick a single square within the grid to build within, each square would allow the same amount of space for example an area of 6x6 foundation space, allowing modest size homes, players would login to find a server with their town house and/or camp, if the server doesnt have one or the other available to be placed down you can choose to stay or leave that server, but heres where it gets tricky; Camps would not be allowed to be placed in town house designated lots and all existing camps in those locations would have to be forcibly removed from servers so space will not conflict. If players so choose to they can pick up their town house and move to another green highlighted square in one of several map marked grids in preselected areas of flat lands throughout the map as we currently do now with camps.  I think it would be awesome if these various settlements had industrial water purifiers, ammo production, resource extractors in which players of only that settlement could access with instanced loot. Settlers would try and defend their own settlement from settlers from opposing settlements attempting to steal food, water, ammo, and crafting resources from them.  
---
Thanks; I‚Äôm on the same boat as OP, and I‚Äôll give it a shot tonight.
---
Any advice regarding lever-action rifle plans? 
---
Yup, lost a furious explosive combat rifle after a random disconnect
---
You need to get the TSE M-1, it'll one shot them every time, old time. It will also take you back to those salty shores...
---
Hazmat Suits definitely need some kind of customization. Either mods, atom skins, or even another design like the prototype hazmat. Well it doesn't need it but it would be nice
---
These locations would have to be in non nukable zones for obvious reasons, the ultimate satisfaction to a griefer would be to level player camps in one fell swoop. 
---
Since PC beta. 
---
Never had issues with players. 
---
99.99% out in the wild are friendly.
---
Have had people shoot me and emote PvP but I tell them not right now and they've left me alone.
---
I've intentionally emptied my junk, shot at a high level player and died to them, thanked them for clearing my accidental bounty, which I intentionally inflated to 100caps to make it rewarding to the other player.
---
Highest concentration of idiots/immature players seem to be Whitesprings but they've not been a real problem. Just idiots on comms mostly e.g. "do you know da wae?" cult.
---
Never had my camp messed with, it's not on Whitesprings and is in a pretty secluded area where if anyone stumbled upon it, they'd probably use the facilities instead because there's nothing around.
---
I play regular 6-8 hour sessions. Some nights have no issues. But I do have some disconnects to server maybe 3 times max in 6-8 hours. Generally when nukes have been launched.
---
I've had three Fallout 76 freezes. Two in the first week (something to do with shotgun animations) and one last week (no correlation).
---
Had an issue once where upon entering my Power Armor, every piece exploded into a million smaller pieces, and none of the pieces were available and when I got out and back in, I became the Neanderthal powerman. I relogged immediately and had an empty chassis but all the pieces that had exploded were in my inventory and I just put them back on.
---
Had a bug where I disconnected during a main story quest to gather materials for Rose's explosive bait and when I relogged, the quest was gone. I had the main quest tracking disabled. So I re-tracked it, logged off, back on and Flavors of Mayhem came back.
---
That's about the extent of my issues and they've been pretty minor/negligible.
---
Yeah I logged off and on as a last resort, but it's still missing.

My husband and I can't wait to have two consoles to finally play our characters together. We even found the wedding rings in the house with the final pam easter egg. Which is a great youtube series.

Repost this everyday, please.  ü§ôü§ôü§ô
---
I‚Äôm tryna look at it from an animal behavior, evolutionary kind of perspective. 
---
200 years, deathclaws and radscorpions are still around and they are everywhere. No dent in their populations. 
---
25 years after atomic war, massive winged-beasts (probably the largest creature in the Fallout universe) with such an evolutionary advantage with the whole flying thing, has never migrated in search of other habitats to hunt and breed in. All dead prior (presumably) to the events of Fallout 1.
---
It‚Äôs an odd choice for the direction of the lore is all. 
---
you were the motherfucker shouting at me from your porch?? you play a mighty banjo tho 
---
How so?
---
I run 4 as well. All that purified water plus super duper perk equals tons of diluted stimpacks equals mountains of caps.
---
I‚Äôm doing main and side quests, with some whitespring in between. Level 47 but 50 on my first char today! I‚Äôm hyped!
---
On sticks? You mean on stairs? It's really the only way to have a mobile base that will consistently place. I hate the way it looks too but sometimes it's just the best choice if you're moving around a lot. Especially when you're leveling. Blame Beth for making it almost impossible to use a blueprint of basically anything else. 
---
no, especially if you're low level - when you claim workshop you're also starting PvP, which means a lot of players would like to take advantage of it. I felt it myself when I've tried to finish one of challenges require claiming all workshops on the map - every few claimed I had to change server because of dumb fucks who thought I wanted to fight with them...
---
They just don't give that much xp, not to mention you'll be needing to defend them every hour.  Workshops are more for farming materials you need, not so much about xp.
---
I love when people criticise me for things they are so full of, mr.self-righteous irony guru.
---
Anyway, you have begun our interaction from calling me insane, which leaves me with only two choices: to reflect on own psychological state, which I actually do as I believe it needs to be maintained to be healthy, or to assume what historically was the most common when sane people were called insane, which is to accept the limited perspective of the angry mob.
---
I will stand by my opinion that doubling the amount of ammunition types available in game, as well as implementing a special generation of high-end receivers into all ranged weapons, as well as making those receivers decently hard to obtain is not justified for a single monster that takes twenty minutes to summon and three minutes to be dealt with. I can back it up with how the market regarding prime plans (dimnishing) and prime weapons (unpreferred) looks, these things just don't sell, if they were desired, they would be commonly bought, not like it is now, bought only by that dude who looked just for this thing.
---
Maybe the incoming TSE nerf will make prime choice a less-subprime one, but as for now, they are one of F76 least rewarding mechanisms, and I believe that it is shortsighted to say that prime receivers have received enough love. This whole game did not received enough love, and not because it was not loved, but because these things take time. Prime receivers are just one of the symptoms.
---
I think u are the one :) maybe u have a bethesda PC lol
---
The queen has 80% resistance to explosives... just gonna put this here.
---
Want to help me kill the King in the Wendigo cave for the Key to the Past quest?? 
---
South West of the map. It's the fair ground near the bottling plant. In the middle of the roller coaster there is a raider camp you'll find various armour plans there. But it's pretty well known so expect to have to sever hop A LOT!
---
Sometimes one robot will be randomly hostile.
---
I also read a comment that recommended that you don't sneak around any assualtrons, they get pissed if you come out of sneak near them and interpret it as an ambush.
---
Which workshops are best for farming lead?
---
It's weird because the weapon was removed from my hotkey to begin with, so something must have happened that made the server think that weapon isn't part of my inventory, and fast traveling force the server to reload my inventory which was missing the weapon. 
---
But the lore...
---
Not sure there is a good lead workshop.  I always hit the nuke silos for the weight rooms though.
---
I made a new PA helmet and scrapped the old one with the HUD. Still get crashes. Maybe not so many though.
---
In contrary to the other psots I would say: yes. And the plans for your camp, that you get as a reward are also nice. Not to speak from the resources you can get. 
---
And normally no one claims the workshops. and when they do, you don't have to fight. let them take it, hop server, rinse and repeat.
---
Yeah PA is not endgame. I moved off that horse a long time ago. I have 3/4 the DR and ER now but I mitigated 75% of damage coming in and another 45% first if its PVP. I just let things come to me now and beat them to death.
---
I bought for 60...I hope that actually means something 2 Bethesda....It better not go f2p
---
I found the wedding ring for my wife in game too! She wears it all the time :) If you guys are on ps4 we should team up sometime!
---
If it goes f2p, I'm hoping for either the easy route of free atoms or preferably exclusive items like BETA players got. Outfits or badges would make the most sense but they could go for CAMP items and paints also.
---
To give an explanation why a random high level is greifing your camp: he's probably in discord with a group of friends and someone got the "server full" message so they are trying to free up space. It's shitty that the servers hold 24 but they idle around 18-20 so they rapidly become overloaded when a big group tries to join 
---
I agree with that statement.
---
However, I bought the game for $80 and have put well over 300 hours into the game so far with any more to come, I got my monies worth. If it goes free to play I wont cry over it, but I wouldnt mind a little somethin, somethin.
---
Did u figure this out?  I'm on xbox and having this problem...
---
I never said they worked...this was before they claimed to have fixed it in a patch...and before the fusion core productin got nerfed so I was swimming in them by the end.
---
I bought it for around $6 so it's almost like F2P. The only thing I'm affraid Bethesda will do then will be introduction of game-changing items/perk cards in Atomic Shop that will allow them to make money if game will be free.
---
Lol you k ow Charlie is a racist term right? üòÇ 
---
It would work as a travelling food truck but a stationary restaurant based on gimmicks just seems like a failure waiting to happen.
---
You do understand, I‚Äôm sharing an impression with you as a parent, not arriving at a debate armed with carefully researched evidence. 
---
I get your don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover philosophy. Sure. 
---
I‚Äôm just interested - What‚Äôs your own impression, based on your own experience and what you‚Äôve read about/heard about second hand?
---
Does the PSN have a toxicity problem? 
---
Nice one!
---
I always assumed the loot is spawned when a server instance is started.
---
I figured there was no reason to make the loot respawn if they just tag server instances as old and phase them out from getting new players after they have been up a while.  
---
Once there are no players on an old instance it's shutdown and a new instance replaces it with a fresh new world to loot that has some of the world loot randomly spawned.  
---
I suppose it would make sense if they intended to run the servers without restarting to add in loot respawning mechanics for non-container items but I just assumed they would want the servers to reload the server instance fairly regularly.
---
oh.. good to know, I thought that were other paints like VIM! etc
---
imo clothing that provides no bonuses and is just cosmetic should be on the top layer always. Hazmat suit should also get a rework to fit over normal armor so the Unarmed Gang can go into Nuke Zones and fight Queen safely with us.
---
from bottom to top layer should be:
---
under-armor, actual armor, Hazmat, cosmetics w/o bonuses 
---
We did similar to someone who picked my friends base. Haunted him down and killed him, then took all his junk and replaced it with spoiled meat
---
The peaceful melancholic background music makes it 10 times sadder
---
&gt;I'm a disabled US Veteran  
---
No idea what this has to do with anything. Being 100% VA rated myself, I wouldn't imagine finding it relevant to insert this detail into anything unrelated like you have.  
---
But in general, I agree with the other posters. If the game is causing you this much stress and anger, it's time to stop. Maybe also stop by the VA and get with a MH provider (if you don't have one already) and see what can be done to alleviate your symptoms.  
---
Sucka to be you I see grahm Everytime I log in I made my camp in a spot that's part of the circle he walks if you follow him for about 6hrs you can figure his entire loop out
---
If it was just something you unlocked by leveling  and was just there for all then there‚Äôd be less of a point to locking your shit if it means everyone above a certain level has the high end lock pick. 
---
Definitely not as much as in FO4 but you are still a tiny bit easyer to detect with it.
---
Still around? How much for the tse lever? I have stim packs as well if needed 
---
First time I encountered one hand melee weapon, I though I can take pistol and shoot with it, while bashing with melee weapon.
---
Was very disappointed. :)
---
Always cook raw meat at a cooking station. Usually it only requires 1 meat and 1 wood to prepare a meal.
---
Red stuff in AP bar means you're dehydrated.
---
Playing in a group can have its advantages but it's up to you.
---
Use atoms on whatever you want. All the items are purely cosmetic so just get what you really like.
---
To bad you can‚Äôt put a grenade in there so it explodes when he loots his stuff ü§£
---
I can only say it worked for me. I have had suspicions though about the timing of some of these interruptions. That maybe Bethesda needs to look through its server moderators for malicious actors.
---
Giant glowing radioactive mutant ISIS.
---
And comically there are much better places to nuke for grinding legendary items
---
If you need a TSE weapons to kill glowing mobs then you need a better build or better playing skills.   TSE never should have existed in the first place.  Those weapons killed the barter economy and turned a large percentage of the player base into fucktards.  
---
If the idea was to limit acquisition of certain plans, then this really should have been where faction specific currency would have been a better design.  Then people can actually grind in a way that works.  If you want the Lever Action, then build up your Responder creds and get enough to buy the Lever Action.  
---
Either that, or fix Patrol Duty so it can consistently trigger.  Got to settle down to play on a three-day weekend and never got it to trigger once.
---
20 is not enough to transfer whole armor set at once. But 100 will cover every possible cross-character transfers.
---
There's already very little reason to lock your shit 
---
Meh I'd say the completed 5 in my quest tab that won't go away are more annoying
---
Gives whoever picks it a bounty and keeps away people who don‚Äôt have enough lockpick cards from getting into it. 
---
What more reason could there be 
---
Those were items I wasnt selling. The lever action is my main weapon
---
Hi fellow dealer, i do the same on PC but nobody wants my Psycho and Buffout. I guess I have to use them all myself, I don't complain!
---
Apart from Lonesome Road, when has the protagonist had access to full scale nuclear weapons?  Even then, they were just a few decrepit missiles, not an almost endless supply of fresh new ones. It‚Äôs entirely reasonable to believe the vault dwellers, nukes in hand, would‚Äôve been able to eliminate the issue. 
---
Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm an apologist for BGS either. I‚Äôm aggravated that the BoS is even in the game and at the inclusion of very modern looking drones as they‚Äôre a definite break away from canon. 
---
Suck a butt nub.
---
They actually did a good job with Antibiotics: +50% disease resist for some time after use is a way to go. 
---
Hell knows what the formulae of Disease Cure is, 'cause I can't remember anything with ability to cure such wide specter of illnesses. It's either a liquid jeezuz or very concentrated meth (so you're too high to give a f\*ck about some rash, cough and bloody diarrhea).
---
Btw tl;dr.
---
The red in your stamina\AP bar is from starvation or thirst, you can check which under Effects in your pipboy Status screen.  You should be able to cook any basic meat or veggies you find at a cooking station or boil dirty water to make it drinkable. The perk 'Lead Belly' is very useful, as it eliminates rads from food and drink completely at level 3.
---
Run through the early questline and collect the Overseer's Stash in each spot it appears, you'll get plans for a water purifier you can build in camp that helps immensely.
---
If you die you just drop the Junk you're carrying, never your gear.
---
Group members can share perk cards if their charisma is high enough, and you can fast travel to them for free.
---
All the Atom stuff is cosmetic only, so feel free to spend them on whatever catches your fancy. There's limited time stuff that pops up that you might want to save for though.
---
Same, is the Tech Data bugged too? It's not a "daily" 
---
I just jumped servers until i got them all. 
---
I just need to hear the wings flap in the distance and I immediately Alt F4.
---
Exactly, very little reason other than to not help people out with a place to scrap/craft/store
---
I assumed we end the scorchbeast threat before they can spread too far. Between the detection system, the vaccine and the Appalachian nuclear arsenal I think the tools to do the job are there. I also assume that Appalachia is a totally irradiated wreck by the time of 3/Nv/4,which is sad as it seemed to be in fairly decent state compared to the rest of the settings seen in other games. 
---
Use PA about 10% of the time... Dozens of crashes still
---
So wait. Your wording there is really confusing.
---
You are saying putting a scope on your gun in a video game got you horny. And you proceeded to Jack off while the game was still running and 3 potentially young children heard you?
---
That's pretty rough man. 
---
I mean, technically the Enclave created them. They also we'rent killed by them as they largely all killed each other (over a dispute about creating the scorchbeasts).
---
You realize power armor dies the same thing in nuke zones, right?
---
I see him by the Ammo dump, where is your camp?
---
1. early game was a bit rough for me as well regarding food but now it is only a problem if I forgot to do anything at all about it for a while. Best tips for early game is to use your cooking station frequently to cook all the meat you find and to kill all animals to get meat. The cannibal perk is ok for leveling up, not if you are playing in PA though since you will have to jump out of it.
---
2. As someone stated it is when you are too hungry or thirsty.
---
3. you will only drop your JUNK that you have on you and it will be in a paper bag where you died. you can go back and loot it if no one else does it before you and the game will flag it for you via the radar/map.
---
4. Besides the social part and ability to easier fight big enemies or big groups of enemies you can share perks with the team and get boosts to mutations. A lot of Charisma cards only work when in a team etc. If playing solo i would recommend atleast 4 points in Charisma and pick up the Lone wanderer perk in Charisma to give you a boost when solo.
---
5. Nothing that will make you stronger, thank god for that or I am done with this game. Buy cosmetics or CAMP stuff that you like. I spend all my atoms on power armor paints more or less...
---
About not having a clue, a lot is similar to F4 but a lot is new regarding perks, VATS, teams etc.
---
Have fun mate!
---
PvP is one thing destroying houses is another. If they had to have that in allow houses of people who have bounties to be destroyed. They opted in to the wrongdoing.
---
I‚Äôm talking resource extractors she other things that accrue resources over time. Idc if people scrap their shit, just don‚Äôt want my resources to be taken especially since they  grow/farm only while I‚Äôm playing   
---
I would still play if the game is good and there are only cosmetic stuff in the shop, like for DOTA 2. I would quit as soon as you could buy pay to win stuff. Regardless how good the game is.
---
They won‚Äôt change. They‚Äôre also trivial to fight, to the point that they are just an annoyance that forces a waste of ammo, stims, and time.
---
Yes yes yes. Fortunately lately I've run into some actual adult males, who don't do the whole weird thing, so that's awesome.
---
I am still looking for folks to team up with sometimes, since my RL friends all got sick of the game and stopped playing :( I'm on PS4, what about you?
---
I believe this is the case, i'm LvL 161 and i go to whitesprings for the drugs/caps and occasional legendary. If there is a low level there already, most of the ghouls are also low level.
---
Grafton has a lead resource and 2x steel which is good for making ammo.
---
knowing Bethesda and the decisions they've made so far, I wouldn't be surprised 
---
That'll put the base condition pretty high. It definitely makes a difference.
---
Good, that you wrote what platform do you play...
---
I  was able to finish it with help from someone else thanks though.
---
Protip for newbies.
---
When you find your first train station *look at the map*.  If you stare at the pushpins it will add the location of other train stations to your map and every train station is a vendor (and workbench, and stash box).
---
You'll have to walk out to the stations before you can fast travel, but at least you'll know which way to go.
---
Amen
---
Not sure why you would destroy someone's decontamination rig. Just because you personally have a mutation you don't want to lose or don't want to use a serum? Then don't fucking walk through it. Very stupid logic
---
Apart from weapon/armor mods, there's a few items you can learn by scrapping. Most don't have a 100% chance. There's some recipes I don't remember, and some headwear like Assaultron, but also Marine and Combat helmets. I don't know any other thing you can learn by scrapping.
---
Naw, Scorchbeast guano.
---
He happened to spawn right as I had zoned in to defend a workshop from a super mutant attack.  I was going HAM on his ass, thinking "why the hell is this dude tanking so much damage", until I realized it was Grahm.  I felt so bad I just followed him around afterwards for a while offering my services as a body guard.
---
It makes you mad? 
---
'Sometimes' you gotta decide for.yourself whether it's good or not? That's always buddy. You should make.your decisions after watching a bunch of dumb you tubers 
---
You can make a ticket to bethesda but they can't help you get your items back, I lost weapon due to the Mama Dolce event and they basically responded that they will tell the devs about the issue to get it fixed, but reimbursing the lost item is impossible for them so rip .
---
I bought it too for 60 EUR, fully expecting it will be free-to-pay at some point in the future. I'm 100% sure it will in a year or two.
---
It's an online game! So many others in the last years have started out full-price or subscription model and then went free-to-play at some point. How could you really surprised if that happens?
---
And ask yourself: What would you like more, Bethesda stopping releasing new content and material because a twindling player base or a new inlfux of players and thus a longer life-spn of the game?
---
Its pretty nuts now, I just tested yesterday with fireproof 2 and a dense chest piece and I could shoot point blank at my feet with my TSE shotgun and take ZERO damage (this also includes dodgy). I could still somehow break my armor and cripple myself this way but absolutely no movement on my life bar.
---
Let's hope so!
---
Yeah lucky, after 1 month of doing daily vendor routines because server hopping for mod, item spawning, etc is just too much work I finally get a jetpack and when I went to scrap junk my mod was gone so rip.......
---
Your welcome man..,Sorry it took so long and all the server Crashes.. Lol
---
My golfer quest also disappeared and I'm certain I never saw a completed quest for it.
---
I like this really idea. 
---
1str 5 carry
---
1end 5 hp
---
just found him ! took me while tho... however, just realized you're on XB and I'm on PS4 :/
---
More importantly, they reward you plans upon completion. Even if your not planning to keep a workshop its worth it to claim it real quick. 
---
Yeah I see them all the time (I make a few runs at the Golf site every day). A lower level player is near by when it happens.
---
the start will be pretty boring up until you get the first drill and start stacking it‚Äòs damage doubt anyone would go through the trouble of watching this
---
on another note i‚Äòm one of the people going hazmat on queen fights and yes, you can stack enough survivability on perk cards to survive easily, when i just had half of the cards i went through 20+ stimpacks per queen, now it‚Äòs 5- max 10, if i had a decent vampire weapon i‚Äòd probably use none at all
---
It‚Äôs all yours my friend!
---
Available anytime soon ?
---
duping accident
---
I paid 80 Euro and would be fine with F2P but i would never play if they sell pay to win items/buffs.
---
Can Vault 76 be nuked ? Asking for a friend...
---
alright - apart from melee: what build do you suggest? I currently use a rifle build with max perk dmg + tank killer. nothing worked effectively so far against a rushing horde of glowing ghouls over 50
---
Again, just say power or electricity. That's what it says literally everywhere in game thus ultimately what people can relate to.
---
I love how people who are unable to come up with a good build themselves, suck at the game or both now say TSE's are 'needed' for endgame content.
---
I solo the queen in about 5 minutes, and I do not use TSE nor melee. And don't say I use bobbleheads because I do not.
---
Open the perk deck, and just take 15mins browsing it. Then THINK and make a good build ffs.
---
Hardly takes 0 time when required components come from a Nuke zone.
---
Woah wait, a wendigo?! I am very low level (15) and havent seen much else other than robots, scorched &amp; super mutants. (oh and some stupid mole mine things that tore me up thanks to a level 40 wandering round, which i think riased the level of all the enemies lol.
---
Havent heard the word Wendigo since i played Until Dawn, are these the same sort of thing? Baldy gangly things that wreck face?
---
Sorry to go slightly off topic :)
---
I drop extra stuff at the Overseer's camp and see him from time to time around there. 
---
Someone nuked Morgantown last night and he was walking through the nuke zone. The glowing ones totally ignored him and everyone was trading him. He's a nice fella.
---
Hey man, I‚Äôm going to be on at 9:30 if that is alright with you
---
I'd like it if you could upgrade underarmour to be a radsuit that still gives the special, or at least some extra stats.
---
Well that's a horse of a different color
---
Absolutely right. These TSE users are just doing what some youtuber did, and didn't do any testing/thinking themselves.
---
I can't wait for the nerf to happen :)
---
so you can go over 600 def without pa? 
---
Which new PVP functions?
---
damn
---
Grafton vendor has the plan. I server hopped about 10 times and got it.
---
Same here, was at about 5 and it disappeared. 
---
Got a 3 ping rolling pin yesterday. Assassins pin that reflects damage when blocked, extra power attack damage,
---
What's in a "canned dog food"?
---
No, it's just repeatable.
---
You could write to Pete Hines , he was on a 10 day holiday at game launch, not giving a fuck. Still doesn't give a fuck to this day.
---
this is correct. But if you have seen the patch notes the two shot damage is also getting nerfed to oblivion. And that was what made a difference together with the demo expl combination.
---
I more intrigued with how the hell you found this post.
---
What platform do you Play on and whats your gametag ...
---
Will gladly help you out when im playing.
---
Still pricy but not quite as bad. 
---
While the other S.P.E.C.I.A.L.S. have a lot going for them, it is worth investing three points in Endurance to get Lead Belly at Rank 3.  That way you never have to worry about radiation from what you eat and drink.  (I ran Dromedary and Slow Metabolizer at Rank 1 until I did that, and those helped early on.)
---
Make sure to complete all the Responder quests in and around the Forest.  That was about 70 hours ago for me in terms of play time, but those quests largely give you everything you need for your C.A.M.P. to set up a decent way to make food and water.  That and take over one of the beginning workshops in the region, like Gorge Junkyard.  You don't have to defend it, but taking over a workshop also gives you a lot of plans to build at your C.A.M.P. with stuff like water purifiers.  
---
Kill small animals and hunt Radstag or Brahmin.  Most small animals will let you whack them over the head if you sneak up on them, and Radstag and Brahmin usually take a couple of bullets to drop.  But you can cook the meat you get off of them easily and both offer decent bonuses.  Same with aggressive animals like Feral Dogs or Molerats.  That goes a long way in alleviating your hunger bar.  
---
You can also pick various plants to be able to make teas or juices.  You'll need Boiled Water to make it, but all of those do a good job of alleviating your thirst bar.  As well as giving some decent bonuses.
---
Lastly, spend time coming up with a good way to manage your inventory and stash.  This Fallout is very different in that you won't be able to horde everything you come across.  Scrap weapons and armor you don't use to learn mods for those weapons and armor.  If you are using a basic weapon or armor and it breaks, then it may be far cheaper to scrap it and make a new one if you have the plans.  Especially with armor.  Try to avoid buying from vendors until you have a rank or two of Hard Bargain.  I play solo and run Lone Wanderer for the majority of my play, but always swap in Hard Bargain if I need to buy or sell.
---
You didn't get a canvas bag *even though you paid* for it, so expecting 10k atoms *for free* seems pretty unrealistic.
---
- Keep 50 of each material, except lead and steel
---
- Drop the 1star legendary junk weapons and armor in your stash, hording is pointless
---
- Drop all ammo, except for the ammo you're using
---
- Stop complaining or go play RDD2
---
That‚Äôs good to know!
---
The holiday part is slightly understandable. The continuation is not.
---
Well at the way nearish to Top of the World but off of any main roads - very rarely have people come past.
---
&gt;If you only spec damage perks you do more damage!
---
The Jack pumpkins quest is a daily quest. If you have a challenge for completing daily quest(s), doing that quest counts toward its completion. 
---
That's very nice of you! I'm on PC and my gametag is the same as my Reddit username.
---
How did you get the lasers?
---
Just do workshop defenses, I've gotten quite a few that way.
---
Don‚Äôt forget New Vegas!
---
When I attempted this, during the BETA, it wiped for me, before I killed all of them. Kind of annoyed I see them every so often.
---
I‚Äôve done so many already 
---
Pretty sure. When the quest finishes my item reward is like a single leather left leg and then no caps or XP.  Was never like that for me.
---
I'm on now if your up for joining?
---
It's still in the HOT tab for me lol
---
On Overseer's journey, I still have the quest, and as far as I know, I've picked up all the holotapes. Even the one from the nukes.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôve claimed and defended workshops over and over and still nothing 
---
I use PA 
---
I'm a pve player put a fair few hours in and really don't understand how some players are being "constantly griefed". I approach pretty much every player I see and give them the thumbs up and no one has tried to initiate PvP with me (except the one guy who took umbrage to me clearing out his unlocked resource extractors). 
---
On this subject there are a few other things they could have done. 
---
Make the Strikebreaker robots‚Äô behavior dependent on weapon/attire.  Wearing a suit or military fatigues?  They greet you courteously. Wearing working clothes or carrying a protest sign?  Instant beat down.  I have a special like of their inclusion as it‚Äôs an allusion to the state‚Äôs trouble history with labor, particularly miners. 
---
Bots in general should respond more to attire. For example, raider vendors giving slightly better prices to people in raider armor, Phoenix giving those prices to anyone in BoS gear, Whitesprings bots doing it for well dressed players (suit/golf clothes, no armor). 
---
As discussed already, songs suited to the event. 
---
Instead of the normal FO type soundtrack music during launch/landing of nuke, they should have done something far more ominous. 
---
The bots in the Whitesprings should be trading in pre-war money not caps, similar to the Sierra Madre‚Äôs vendors in FO:NV (though that was a piss poor execution of the concept). 
---
okay. I use 9 perks cards damage buff for rifles + tank killer at max. So dear yabadabado0o0, what should I change?
---
Also do you have proof that what you say is possible? I seriously doubt that because I have not even heard of anyone soloing the queen in 5 mins being not a duper using bobblestacks / mags exploit or melee. 
---
Please post here I would love to be enlightend. 
---
Im fine with any video link from any player as proof. 
---
The first time I saw the price the vendor offered for legendary stuff I gasped. Caps are a joke though once you figure out the 7 different vendors. I buy mutations for friends all the time just to empty out the caps and most legendary items go in suitcases.
---
What incentive would I have for lying? The only way it would have worked is it's calculated per shot - he had an explosive shotgun which in one pull of the trigger can do significant damage. I don't think the game can calculate each object being destroyed individually as it's don't too quickly.
---
Where did you find the pirate hat!?
---
Wow. Well I guess the other guy really wasn't the only person to find that second Preston. üòÇ
---
I paid full price on release. If they do F2P then I better be compensated VERY well or this game will be dead to me. I love this game to death and have defended it since the beginning, but going F2P is absolutely not the right answer in any scenario and will ultimately push me away for principle alone.
---
thx but i just want to play alone
---
If you check the Atom store, it's for 300 atoms
---
Hey now, don't be dissing pumpkin pie...
---
Nah. As long as FO76 is F2P and mtx barely exist, we won't get faster fixes. If they introduce the lunchboxes, then maybe they up their patches and servers.
---
I got lucky at Freddy's Fright House.  Found a clown suit inside and a Windigo in the parking lot. 
---
Oh I never noticed vendors sold bulked versions. Thanks! 
---
Sufficient Water For Processing, Chicken, Meat By-Products, Wheat Flour, Animal Liver, Lamb, Wheat Gluten, Peas, Carrots, Salt, Sodium Tripolyphosphate, Natural Flavor, Guar Gum, Minerals (Potassium Chloride, Magnesium Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Potassium Iodide, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate), ...
---
I'm not against PVP, it's just currently destroying someones CAMP literally serves no purpose. There is 0 reward for doing so, it is purely done by people who are bored.
---
This is definitely the darkest fallout if everyone does what you did by absorbing the information around them. It‚Äôs truly fucked up. I‚Äôm still haunted by Colonel‚Äôs survivor story holotape. 
---
i just spent 7 hours with recurring parasites so i agree lol 
---
Never said it was in Whitesprings.
---
I think you over estimate the amount of people that care about PvP. I had some idiot try to PvP last night because he didn't like my "wardrobe", I just server hopped and blocked and went on my merry way.
---
There is precedent for being able to do this, as there are various Fissure sites around the map, it should be easy enough to relocate the prime site.
---
I agree with a lot here and i believe that f2p often Will replace a big part of the existeng player base. 
---
I hope for everyones sake that it does not happen but most of all i hope it does not become pay to win because then i am defenitely out even though i too love the game and have spent so much time in it already.
---
No mobs spawn where my CAMP is.
---
Too bad you're on PS4, because you definitely deserve a prize. 
---
Yeah but when acid makes 0.5 flamer fuel... It's still super hard to maintain right?
---
It seems like the Wendigo one is too then
---
That could be anytime here i have no idea of your time zone lol.. How many hours ? 
---
Wasn‚Äôt Frank exposed to the FEV in the Mariposa facility then he was subjected to the tests and experiments afterwards? IIRC he was still an enclave soldier then basically got an upgrade when he was infected. 
---
Oh sorry eastern
---
Just message me when your on lol üòÇ CrazyCammy93 
---
Of course broüëç
---
I've ran into some jerks on XB1 and have crashing. My XB1 is an OG model I bought used, talk about bang for the buck.
---
There are teams that are bored and have every duped weapon possible and 3 star PVP armor. One member gets a high bounty (the one with the PVP armor) and they wait for someone to claim it. It doesn't end well for the person who tries to claim it when all 3 or 4 start blasting you with TSE weapons. 
---
That said, 99% of the player base is pretty chill.
---
Wow, you make it sound so fun!
---
If you have the shielded marine suit plan I'd pay nicely for it lol 
---
Streets and roads already set. Each player gets a plot of yard on the block that can be upgraded and built on to make unique houses. A cost is there to rent the land.
---
I saw them on one of the whitesprings vendors a few days ago.. while I was looking for the power switches. 
---
&gt; YOU can get OR someone with a very high lockpicking skill.
---
So basically everyone at this point?
---
&gt; the thief who'll risk getting hunted down just for stealing your crummy junk.
---
Until he server hops. Besides, no one hunts down low bounties because usually people with small bounties did something on accident. It's not until the bounty starts getting built up that people start giving a shit.
---
There is a 2 person duping method. I wont go into detail, but Ill just say it doesnt work in camps. So 2 people in a camp cant dupe as far as I know.
---
I‚Äôll check if I do. I probably have them. I remember seeing them
---
I bought it from the vendor in Harper's Ferry.
---
I did it during the stress test, haven't been back to whitesprings in actual game yet. guess I should go try after I finally make it to suicide.... erm.... Harpers Ferry
---
Not really! One of the workshops (i forget which) has three acid nodes. Plus maxed super duper procs way more ofteb than it should. I only use the flamer in groups anyhow, because of Friendly Fire (a cornerstone of the support build)
---
I'd love a radsuit mod for underarmour
---
True statement. Killed a level 62 *** legendary ghoul at around level 30 (I used exploding cars!) It gave me a level 45 with only ** perks. On my level 70 I have received level 50 gear from enemies only level 40.
---
I think one wendigo one is a mistake/bug and the tech data one is on purpose. Hard to know for sure.
---
I think Winterized and Atom Cat were paints from the "Dev Room".  They were allegedly banning people with items from that room so be careful.
---
I just got the T-60 BoS paint job from Forbidden knowledge.  It's not so much a Daily quest, it just depends on how often you pick up Technical Data.  I have good luck at power plants, look in their file cabinets.
---
Yeah, they‚Äôre lanky things with some sort of scream attack. There‚Äôs a lvl 42 in Garahanns mine that‚Äôs preventing me from doing my excavator quest. I‚Äôm only lvl 26. The thing destroyed me and another lvl 36 dude that was there with me.
---
Yeah I've run into the "kill the bounty hunter" teams. Everyone of them is a duper scum. Stacked bobbleheads, 3 star PVP armor, etc.
---
Qol
---
Exactly. I would like to see a message on screen something like 'You are entering another players CAMP, destroying objects will come with a significant bounty' Then slap 2500 caps on their head as a starting point for doing any damage. Or even calculate a percentage of the players wealth, some people are boasting about have 25k + in caps so it would have to be relative to how many they have.
---
You know who says that? A duper.
---
I had an assassin armour piece giving me 6 damage protection....
---
Having got to the end of the "story" my friends and I have moved on. Oh how nice it is to play a game that isn't a buggy POS and doesn't have level 200 idiots coming in and one shotting everything and provides decent loot with a proper storage system.
---
What there is to play passed the end of the story is beyond me and seems to be the place for only those that can't live without a Fallout game to play. The bugs are rampant, the base building limited, storage limited, hackers and cheaters go unchecked and the loot drops from "Legendary" creatures is about the most absurd thing I've seen in an RPG. Why bother spending 10 minutes fighting a SB and using a bunch of Stimpacks when I can get more in a minute killing a bunch of supermutants?
---
The balance in weapons vs enemy is ridiculous - when you can hide in a canvas tent and be immune to a SB's attack... THE end of game enemy, you know something's wrong.
---
Btw. You = uninteresting. 
---
If anyone needs them, I'm a low level player on xbox.... ;)
---
Every time I see an explosive shotgun, I just run in front of him while he's shooting.
---
Yeah I think I got like 20 caps or something but that's all
---
Well if you have a ps4 you're more than welcome to come check out mine! Someone else placed them for me, but they're pretty sweet
---
Hmm, the only issue I'm having, is that a pirate hat doesn't exactly go with a white tux...
---
I dont want take a workshop...i want package in my camp, not it workshop not sunshine meadows not homestead... in fallout 4 its possible and fallout76 have the same things and things even  share textures so...its possible. For the same reason you would have to plant and extract resources only in workshop... in fact in fo4  do ammo too and armors and weapons, not legendary but craft in settlements a lot of things
---
Or a compromise at least, I dislike using PA personally and would like to be able to run through blast zones without constant risk of death 
---
Word of advice, if you get something really awesome, log out
---
Bethesda: nerfs outfit values, leaves legendary values the same
---
Y'all have gotten your money's worth of gameplay so if it goes free to play you shouldn't get anything. 
---
I've thrown a few, they seem to do decent damage and are retrievable. But they don't stagger or cause splash damage so they're hard to justify over grenades. There are also throwable tomahawks which do a little more damage.  But I've only found them; not sure if there is a recipe for crafting. 
---
I am in PST now, so we're 9 hours apart. It will be difficult to overlap since I'm at work when you playing. I can try to hop on over lunch. What's your IGN so I can look for your friend invite?
---
have you got the drifter outfit? you can go full pirate
---
I get the same amount of freeze-crashing that you're describing too on my XB1X.
---
The new twist (since the last patch) seems to be when I'm loading into a zone, the second load screen becomes all black and the icon just spins forever and I have to reset the game.  Fun.
---
Stop talokg reason, these are cheap ass entitled people, they dont get stuff like that.
---
I've just started using left instead of right, then at least I've only got to change weapon back. But it is very annoying, especially when low on stims.
---
Also, I wish we could change the d-pad hot key items. 
---
Camp busting has increased from what I've seen on XB1. Bored players with nothing to do. It's not hard to max caps so the bounty means nothing.
---
Damn im on Xbox 
---
I would be happy to scrap them just like an average gun. Hell, if they want to give me some special metals or parts that‚Äôs great. Otherwise give me some steel wood or aluminum. 
---
It‚Äôs obnoxious to sell them for 1-4 caps a piece or just drop them. I want my resources Bethesda! I‚Äôve earned them!
---
Yeah, honestly it gets depressing frequently.  The other fallout games were dark, but also hilariously weird.  This game...yeah, you can put your junk in a toy box...but there isn't *nearly* enough comic relief.
---
I can see a need to take a break every now and then just so things don't become too grim.
---
Sounds like the 3 star railway rifle I got. Assassins, weight reduction, limb damage.
---
I can tell by the few comments that satirical humor is becoming lost on the youth. We are doomed. 
---
I have a pro and crash much more often than my friends. 
---
I think Bethesda need to allow pro users to have a performance mode (like a lot of pro enhanced games already have)which keeps 1080p resolution with no super sampling.  Currently it seems that even If you have s pro without a 4K tv, the game renders in a higher resolution  then downscales to 1080. 
---
My friends with normal PS4 seem to get better FPS and less crashes than me because of this. 
---
That mama dolce bug is so infuriating! Fell victim to it last night thankfully only lost my gas mask that I noticed but could have been a hell of a lot worse.
---
Yeah....I need to change that and hope Mega Sloth doesn't get jealous.  :)
---
The worst part is, 1h melee is significantly weaker than 2h, and yet still suffers from most of the same drawbacks. It's tough wanting to stick with my h build, but hopefully we get some balance changes in the future.
---
Read again, usually people have them set up to fire automatically, walk through door get cleaned up, but when they leave it that way and another player is affected negatively, of course they're going to be irritated and potentially level the cause of them having to devote more time to something they may have been satisfied with already. Pretty fucking simple logic. 
---
I would accept one of Todd's locks too !      
---
Nice post dude ;)
---
Thanks for the offer, but a guy fresh out of the vault helped me so I set him up with a full set of armour and a ton of chems. Much appreciated.
---
I like using the Gatling gun.  Max out the Martial Artist perk and it will fire faster.  Aside from the Heavy Gun perks in STR, also put some points into LCK with things like One Gun Army and Bloody Mess.
---
Like others were saying, stock up on lead, steel, and gunpowder.  Use Super Duper and Ammo Smith and you'll have plenty of 5mm to shoot.
---
I just picked up tenderizer last night, it is a 1 point wonder and way better than I thought it was going to be: highly recommend.
---
Crucial perks is stabilized.
---
I was lucky enough to get a furious explosive minigun that someone sold to a vendor in watoga and my god.....with tenderizer and adrenaline I love this weapon.
---
Be ready to craft ammo all the time. Carry a back up weapon (shotgun/rifle) because you will not want to waste ammo on shit mobs.
---
Sry, but Fallout 76 is trash.
---
From now on, all I will ever hear in my head during this even is ‚ÄúU-ranium, U-ranium, U-ranium, U-ranium...‚Äù thanks.
---
How are they able to one shot you in pacifist mode? It has to be stacked bobbleheads. FFS BGS please remove this "feature". We can't stack drugs, why can we stack bobbleheads?
---
Got 'em twice at the Top of the World bazaar. 
---
The stall with the weapons workbench, under the counter, on the floor.
---
Yes, and soon we will be robbing and raiding in a new better mode for us I hope.. I'm sorry but I've become super anti PVE since this game came out as most players complain about any PVP mechanics this game has to offer.. this game is super soft compared to others and ppl still crying all the time
---
Fallout 76 is **not** a PVP game. It's a MP coop/PVE game with PVP added in one of the worst ways possible. What Bethesda should have done is private servers where you can play with your friends only and then included an open world like we have now with full PVP opt in - not this nonsense we have now.
---
They should also have never put player markers on the map but then Bethesda cluelessly thought that making it the way they did would have people actually "making Ribeye steaks as a profession" and selling them to the world and that's quoted from the devs themselves. 
---
When you have people as clueless about online gaming as that, it's little wonder we got the game we did.
---
I would offer you a duel, but you seem to be happy with using whats crappy, so I don't think you'd be enough of a challenge to justify befriending a turd such as you, even if that befriending would be purely to organise a fight. Please shoot me on sight if you meet me by an accident.
---
I've seen this suggested many times, Ive even suggested it but I cant help but agree everytime I see it.
---
you know i‚Äôm not too sure
---
Off the road like 20ft on that river on the fat west side at the farthest point south on the river he's is always either walking towards or away from Welch station at some point in my average 2 hour sessions
---
The two tile stair bases at least have support, i don't mind 2 tile towers, it's one floor tile with skyward stairs and no support that makes my trigger finger itch. 
---
When your boy calls you online to nuke the new prime and that shit is right on top of the camp you‚Äôve had since beta XD
---
Thanks :) Yes if it's from dev room I don't want it now. Just thought there might be legit obtainable paints I don't have yet.
---
Keeps saying we, has BoS flair...
---
Seems selfish. It's someone else's camp, if you are going through the door it's probably to use their stuff. So if you get cleaned up by a ring you didn't know was there,  that is on you. It's childish and straight up rude to just destroy it on them so they have to farm to repair it or rebuild camp. 
---
That's like going to someone's house and smashing their TV because they are playing a show you don't like. The time it takes to farm a specific mutation is greater than the mats to repair a ring, but if your build is dependant on a mutation then you should be on high alert anyways. Making sure every player made door you go through isn't a decontamination ring. 
---
You're just salty. 
---
Agreed. I too dislike using power armor, so a balance would be pretty cool.
---
I don't get your point?  These are $5 or greater.  Also, outside of cash purchase of PSN (I honestly don't know if it's a thing) any new transaction will have to process a credit pant to add to wallet.
---
Only calibrated shocks. All other limb mods do not stack.
---
I cant even remember what the u/d/l/r buttons do...im forever changing my gun or bringing up the emotes wheel when im at 15% health and need to stimpak in the middle of a fight....t'is painful
---
I haven‚Äôt checked there, at least not that I remember. I‚Äôll give it a shot. Thanks
---
Doesn't glowing mass have a durability? Usually all of my food with condition goes off when I store them.
---
Level 100 and above, not a few hundred players.
---
 Considering i haven't leveled bass for the decon arch how am i salty? I demolish crimes against the laws of physics. That's my trigger to base blast
---
We'll get 5 atoms and paint for a level 10 sturdy leather armor. Left leg only.
---
The PVP part has caused me to reconsider.   Otherwise, as long as your aware and dump stuff in your stash often, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not a bad way to accelerate exp gains.
---
The point of a hazmat suit is that you get 1000 rad resist but nothing else. It's great if you actually enjoy a challenge every once in a while.
---
Funny that his TSE weapon was probably received from a duper
---
&gt; a couple of decades later.
---
You mean a couple of decades after Eckhart seized control and killed off most of the other enclave? Hmm, you're right that surely couldn't have effected how the enclave works just a few decades later.
---
I use 9 dmg perk cards for rifle only + tankkiller max + bloody mess + the highest mods possible. doesnt help at all without the current tse tier. not against a level 80 scorched beast or mirelurk queen, sbq or a &gt; 50 glowing ones.  So yes it does more damage and no it is still not making a significant difference against endgame enemies!
---
I'm not sure tbh what starts it off we just know the 200 hours we put into the game was ruined by a level 190 player. 
---
They should never have allowed other players on your server fullstop unless you chose to play on a public server. After the first 2 experiences with random pubbies we would have ran our own instance if we could.
---
True you are right
---
The fallacy is in the idea that gear must be OP solely for the sake of a specific situation such as farming nuked golf courses.  The weapons required to handle that solo mean everything else in the game is trivial (SBQ aside....even a solo Player with TSE is not taking her down).   The game has very quickly turned into a farm-fest for weapons that never should have been introduced to the game.  
---
I use a 1* Instigating lever rifle for distance and a TS (not explosive) Handmade for closer in fighting.  That combo is perfectly fine for all solo content.  There‚Äôs no reason any player should be able to solo content that was clearly designed for a group to tackle.  
---
I should have been more clear sorry. If it's the same key on PC then yeah, that's ridiculous as there are so many keys. On console though there are fewer options and so you're always going to be doubling up with something.
---
They really should have called him Gary...
---
Nope. 
---
You‚Äôre confusing glowing mass (which is an aid object and a material to craft stable flux, and you find only on nuke zone enemy corpses) and glowing meat.
---
Same. Why so many people were using wood armor baffles me. 
---
circaskater411vm
---
Im only at level 25, but ive only met one dickhead who cornered me in a terminal room on a quest recently, asked me to team, and when i said no thanks with a heart he proceeded to try kill me trapped in said room. After some fortnite-esque jumping i was over the childs play and fast travelled away. 
---
Your TS will become garbage after the patch. Why? Because the TS will also be nerfed 80%. 
---
Not true:
---
"During Bethesda's E3 2018 Press Conference, Director at Bethesda Game Studios Todd Howard took to the stage to confirm theories that Fallout 76 is an online experience. He then went on to reveal that the game can in fact be played solo as well. According to Howard, players can explore the world, complete quests and level up, all without the need to team up with other players. "
---
https://www.usgamer.net/articles/13-11-2018-fallout-76-release-date-platforms-setting-everything-we-know-so-far/fallout-76-solo-mode
---
Its easier with a team but is was designed to be playable solo. Which it clearly wont for all non-melee builds after the patch in the end game.
---
I had a similar problem where I dropped 20 super stims for a friend to pick up and no bag appeared and I lost them all. For me I have just started dropping 1 worthless item to make the bag appear then add to it. But like what happend to you accidents happen and it needs sorting.
---
I think what is actually meant by that is a longer difficulty progression curve with less scaling. Playing the game as (probably) intended and gaining levels and gear without farming you're rarely in any real danger save for a few types of creatures and general recklessness. After a certain point everything is just a resource drain instead of a challenge.
---
Personally, I'd like the game to be not 'harder' but 'deadlier' the further you progress. For all parties involved. Instead of requiring less and less skill the further you progress it would take more and more. Sure you could have TSE weapons but so could the scorched. Sure you could wrap yourself in power armor but the enemies can now have incisor-3 and armor-piercing weapons.
---
He means the scemetics
---
* Bust out power armor and kill it, jump over the projectiles with marsupial, or hide in a trench/behind a tree.
---
* Take an agility perk called escape artist and run away then sneak.
---
* Leave the server and join a new one.
---
As in a piece of Todd Howard's hair?
---
Everyone is allowed an opinion, you dislike someone I like. Not the end of the world. I'm sure there's are people you like I don't. Was not bashing on you for it. Just saying I like him ;)
---
Really, I like this idea.
---
This game is not worth the price of your relationship.
---
Play a real game. Play Rust.
---
Ahh thats awesome. I remember in until dawn they were so creepy and had me on edge all the time. Wonder if these are similar
---
Well you clearly have your mind made up on this issue so either find a way to be happy with the game or find something else to play.  Bye bye
---
But with the upcoming PvP modes, I think *you* might be underestimating how many people will be doing PvP
---
Games that have failed often have the nicest community. 
---
well instead of just ranting you could provide positive suggestion. Or are you just trolling?
---
Love it
---
LMAO nice one :)
---
Disagree. What this game needs is more incentive to attack other players‚Äô bases.
---
This idea, I like. Really.
---
I dropped a bunch of weapons in a suitcase at Morgantown Station. Logged back on another character to pick them up. All gone. So if anyone wants to try moving items between characters don't try to do it without a friend to stand by the container because I lost a bunch of stuff. Good think I was smart enough to not put any of my really good stuff in. I should have tested with just one item to start with but silly me I put about 10+ weapons in. Some Anti-armor and instigating stuff. Some stuff I liked. But I think it was for the best anyway. Maybe it will help me not be so attached to stuff.
---
Idea: I really like this
---
Posiden is such a pain in the ass.  Ive done it 3 times and always have a problem finding where I need to be.  Last time i finished it with 47 seconds left.  I was gonna rage like no other if I didnt.  The other two dont seem nearly as bad to navigate.  Especially thunder mountain.
---
Once the hounds howl its game over. That is the alert and now super mutants will be able to find you. Take out hounds first.
---
That was my plan actually. I started off loving this game and sunk about 300 hours or so into it. After I started to get bored I took a break and told myself I would come back later.
---
Then I started playing Rust again. Now I look back at FO76 and I become angry. Wtf was I thinking playing the game? 
---
Up yours too buddy
---
Level 100 - 9 / 10 :(
---
How do you ‚Äúgrief‚Äù someone in this game because I am legit curious.
---
Unless there's a fundamental change to the game that has most of the bugs fixed and new content, once you've finished the story, what's there to even bother coming back for?
---
Free to play, but all paid dlc is free to people who already own it.
---
Or free for the first year or something.
---
Nuka cola grape for rads, only purchasable from nuka cola vendor at whitesprings. Rad away if you don‚Äôt mind losing a mutation
---
First of all: I know what he meant, I just couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunity to make a joke about Uganda knuckled because the question he posted was ‚Äúwhere can I find knuckles‚Äù
---
Second: I made that comment 67 days ago. Ya late. 
---
Third: how on earth did my comment not register to you as a joke? In what universe do I seem confused? I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, and it‚Äôs not my intent to be insulting. I‚Äôm legitimately curious how/why you‚Äôre clarifying this two whole months later on a post that‚Äôs basically buried amongst a sea of nonsense. 
---
I like the idea. However it might be a bit much showing all this info in icons directly und the names. Another approach would be to have f76 profile that can be viewed in game. This also help if you want ppl to show their current built / setup. Similar to diablo. THere you can put all infos needed. Even let the players create their own back story if they chose to roleplay.
---
I saw him yesterday at the far south-central part of the map, where the unmarked location is with the guys rappelling down a cliff. He jump-scared the hell out of me.
---
I like that idea.. 
---
I have a stored clip. Uploading as we speak. 5mins.
---
nice idea. I would already be happy with a team camp :)
---
Not all of the hate is deserved and out of the 300 hours I ran it on my beefy PC, I only had a few major crashes or bugs... barely any.
---
That being said, with no pvp there really is nothing to do after you complete the quests. 
---
I am just... baffled that people are running around grinding legendaries. Is that fun? Or are you simply satisfying an addictive personality?
---
i had an instigating one but i threw it away cuz it was one star. but i‚Äôve seen them around for sure
---
They surf on different layers on irony than we do, not all is lost
---
ok. sounds good. I hope it also includes the effects you are currently running to prove you are not being a duper with bobblestack / magazines
---
And exp
---
Kinda pissed off on a personal level and worried about the overall state of Bethesda 
---
You basically just want a real Fallout game...
---
I've been saying this since beta.  
---
Damn I‚Äôd love to get my hands on one lol
---
Oh yes! Soooo much glorious plastic in the cafeteria. 
---
As a 3k hour Rust player I just can‚Äôt summon any sympathy for you.
---
You THINK you know pain.
---
I had a quad capacity one. Was actually fairly useful but also only a 1*. 
---
If you aren't singing it as you do the event you're not doing the event right.
---
My first team up was with a Mrs. Fuzzy. I hadn't seen that outfit before, so my jaw just dropped.
---
She, and the outfit, were both awesome.
---
On the other hand, those folks running around in pajamas thinking like they look like some badass member of the Misfits, . . .
---
I would just like to not be overburdened so I can go back and get that bounty before their asshole friend gets it.
---
Then prime your weapon and stop being a baby. You don't need 2se for scorched because you should have one scorched killer or prime weapon for the queen anyway. 
---
Well first they gotta fix how the queens health scales. 
---
It‚Äôs like ‚Äúgood job, you killed the queen! Have a... oh wait, ummmm... well, here‚Äôs the thing, **we only got explosive vents**‚Äù
---
Just kill mole miners, I thinks there's about a 50/50 shot they'll drop it lol it's not that much but the chance is high that one will drop the plan.
---
It doesn‚Äôt put you back into the same server when you log each time. So they probably were still sitting there until someone came by and saw. 
---
Nice thanks man I haven‚Äôt visited that one yet!
---
You on PS4 - I think i have both the plans spare, and the mod. Will check - if u on Ps4. Happy to trade or something ;) 
---
So, so, random. I've taken over only four workshops in my playthrough thus far (lvl 27). They dropped for me this weekend, I think. Is it the set with the donut add?
---
For the very reason the OP stated i guess :/
---
Do you still have it. I‚Äôd take it of your hands if you do
---
Ouch that's unfortunate then. :(
---
I've killed hundreds but still only have the 2 claw ones 
---
just farm the mole miners in the blackwater mine and you‚Äôll get both the gauntlet plan and a ton of gauntlets to scrap which should give you the mod eventually
---
The story in this game is paper thin and irrelevant. So who cares?
---
You can sometimes find one attacking bogtown without having nuked anything tho'
---
No I joined a "friend" just some random person. It was the same server.
---
Xbox, thanks anyway 
---
I got a 3 star it does 10 damage to players 10 damage when zoomed in and +1 agility 
---
Then maybe people can stop ignoring scorched killer and prime weapons. Quit crying about difficult enemies when the enemy you are complaining about is literally the most difficult mob available, this game is already way too easy. 
---
Yeah, and the nuka cola. 
---
Yes :D sorry if it was wrong, I'm no native english speaker
---
Because there weren‚Äôt shields in Fallout 4. 
---
I'll echo the sentiments of others here. Mutations have drawbacks, you have found one of the draw backs of using Electrically Charged.  If you are not interested in how it works you should 1) Enable pacifist mode OR 2) Remove the mutation.  It really that simple.  Feels like you are looking for a fix that doesn't need to exist.
---
Haha, love this song. My kids developed a weird fascination for it when FO4 was out. I never played the game in front of them, but at some point they must have heard the track. 
---
They developed their own dance routine to it and would ask for it to be played in the car and around the house. 
---
All this accumulated playing on Apple Music taught the algorithms that this is one of my favourite tracks. It now periodically pops up in a list of favourites, tracks you love suggestions, and will periodically get inserted into the dynamic playlist/my radio function. 
---
It always makes me laugh and gets some strange looks from friends as to why this weird track is playing who don‚Äôt understand its relevance from FO. 
---
No need to apologize. We all like different things.
---
It mist be RING then, I rarely see mods for the mole miner gauntlet at vendors, but who knows. Maybe Welch station.
---
prime is garbage. I got it and removed it because it was useless. Try farming ultracite for 5000 gatling rounds. Scorched is not enough for the queen. We tried it. The only thing making a real difference are TSEs and only if you have multiple guys using it. I am talking unglitched.
---
I'm sorry bruddah I was just trying to help
---
No one owes you tags, no one. Group up with people when/if you can, and/or take your chances.
---
No one owes you tags.
---
Scrap the gauntlets to unlock the mod 
---
I think if you look into the overseer's camp, the camp idea was supposed to be a lot more strongly&gt;}p
---
I can't even stay in the same server for more than 30 min before crashing
---
Perhaps I know much but tell little. 
---
No, that was correct. I just wanted to make sure that's what you meant, because now I must track him down. üòÇüòÇ
---
You can drop the accusations, and yes it shows my stats/effects/gear/perks before and after the kill.
---
Note:
---
- I didn't proc the adrenalin kill right from the start.
---
- I wasn't crouched on my 2nd barrage, so the sneak bonus didn't proc.
---
- After a minute, there are other people in the area. They are using TSE weapons though, and quite clearly do no visible damage.
---
https://youtu.be/2S3Q6IP-cZo
---
Try doing Charleston landfill.  I get them all the time there.
---
Got a Two shot crossbow that i made ultracite, with bloody mess i love 1 shotting Scorched Leaders and making them explode
---
Beeing aware doesn't mean anything - chameleon sniper killed me with the shot in the head from far, far away with X-01 armor and 109 lvl. For me it's just stupid mechanic - none of this workbenches I wanted to keep - they were claimed only for challenge. Making you vulnerable when I don't play PvP in this game is stupid. I really want Bethesda to remove that from the game and make PvP dedicated servers...
---
Niice sounds pretty decent
---
They should reduce the repair cost of the decontamination shower to basic components and only require the flux for initially building it. 
---
As an occasional base griefer myself, the penalty is fine. Not being able to see anyone and being virtually unable to pick up junk until someone kills you is plenty of motivation not to do it. Of course, there's always the option of cheesing with a friend- in which case you can simply block that player and find a new session. You'll never see them again.
---
What happens when there's a double scorched beast on your camp? They can destroy all your shit and there's no "punishments" for them.
---
&gt; Let's be honest, until it serves a purpose, you wanna be 'raiders' are just a bunch of tools. 
---
Most of the "purpose" in this game is imagination and user defined goals, what else you think people are going to do after they've accumulated all the virtual items they wanted? I've got a character with a griefer build who carries no caps and uses nuka colas to fast travel. She has three 2-shot fat mans with the the wrecking ball perk locked in, and last laugh with orbital strike beacons. I assure you, your tears are only more fuel for the troll army, I think I'm going to go grief some bases right now while I listen to Miley Cyrus. 
---
I'm having the same difficulty (finding a decent weapon to buy for my build) although I use medic pistols. I do have a LVL50 3\* medics shotgun for sale with the following legendary effects: Medics, +10% damage while aiming, +1 PER ([https://imgur.com/a/S5dQ3r7](https://imgur.com/a/S5dQ3r7)).
---
Who is even telling legends about this junk anyway?
---
The main damage modifier with TSE was the 2x explosive damage not the damage from two shot.
---
No it's not, specifically at launch he would need to be on job more then ever.
---
I want to fight against Aliens if i nuke the space station. Even If i dont play anymore.
---
I thought it originated from Victor Charlie, military communication code for V.C. As in Viet Cong. Is this wrong?
---
I've been trying to no avail 
---
I got a quad one aswell its 1 star if you want it its yours im on ps4 
---
There are basic recipes lying around Flatwoods. There are also garden spots and Brahmin, food items in the kitchen of the restaurant, and several wood sources.
---
Damn that sounds awesome! Kinda jealous lol
---
Can we get this guy a writing job or something? Anybody? 
---
Bueller? Bueller? 
---
incorrect. Try looking at TS gun only. The damage is doubled on the same gun using TS only. I have both a TS and a TSE of the same gun that show the difference.
---
Damn I‚Äôm Xbox. Thanks anyway though m8
---
You have a right to your opinion and you shouldn‚Äôt feel sorry for it. 
---
Thanks; I see some hopping in my future...
---
We killed it yesterday with a large group of people wielding 50 cals and battling lasers/plasmas 
---
Impossible. You‚Äôd be gifted full leather armor and stimpaks for life before you made it to Flatwoods. 
---
Yup. With a Bowler hat and Monocle 
---
He made me fall (ok jump) off a cliff near Whitesprings yesterday on PS4, little bugger :(
---
There is only an attack button but it‚Äôs not just for melee.  Long press for attack is already used for ranged auto fire - hold down to keep firing.
---
Water water everywhere and not a drop to drink. 
---
They used it as a nick name for the viet cong as in Charlie chan 
---
100+ hours and I've seen 1
---
I've a lot of hours too.  Got my monies worth but not a full product that was advertised.  A lot of my sessions have been plagued with bugs.  However when it works it is so much fun.
---
I'd take 10k atoms for this to go free to play, but then the atom store will go into overdrive.  They will nickle and dime and try to milk every new player coming in.  It would be a slap in the face to those who paid full retail at launch.
---
Hehe I hope you'll be successful ;)
---
Lol I wasn‚Äôt even mad was just letting ya know and got them down votes üòÇ 
---
*chuckles*
---
Wait, there's events now? Has it gone mmolite or something?
---
Forgive my ignorance. Day one buyer, bought and more or less forgot about ut
---
Body type and movement are almost equal but they dont seem as threatening as in Until Dawn.
---
Still a big Nononono - run in full reverse.
---
No, I was just curious why it was considered racist. I didn't think it was.
---
That's some powerful story telling Jar Head.
---
I've been playing mhw on and off since launch. First game of the seris that i've played and while the grind progression burns me out after a while I can't stop coming back. Capcom did a fucking awesome job
---
Did you test it your self ?, Sorry do you have any proof about this?  I just tested the optimized servos legs and it does stack and the difference between two legs and one leg is very noticeable
---
My opinion is that we don't need another thread on this topic that has been beat to death the last few days.
---
this may have been the same people who killed me and took my camp on ps4
---
Same with mole rats, except they're just annoying
---
Tech Data has insanely rare loot like power armor paint jobs. You just have to keep doing it every time you pick up a tech data. Kinda like grinding for the Camden Park mascot suit. 
---
1 time only during the quest where you need to get the bio-luminescent crap 
---
No no no that‚Äôs all wrong. If you do that you‚Äôll summon the dark brotherhood. Try buying a new one?
---
Know what's really going to happen when the pvp mode drops?
---
 All these people rp-ing as raiders are going to try it for a little while. Then they're going to realize that it's not as easy to be a trolly raider when everyone is gunning for you. So they'll end up going back to annoying the pve players.
---
I'd like to believe the pvp update will solve a lot of problems, but the likelihood is pretty low.
---
You do realize prime ammo only takes 1 ultracite per craft? And gatlings are the most efficient gun with 5mm ammo,you are talking absolute nonsense. I have a prime 50 cal and it shreds through 40 steel to 1 ultracite and 1 flux and I still keep it fed. 
---
I honestly hate the fact that that is the only mothman encounter that's guaranteed
---
check your map, and make sure no one is around, claim the workshop (costs CAPS), gain rewards.. for extra rewards, defend the workshop against waves of enemies. rinse, and repeat. You can get random stimpacks, food/water, armor, weapons, plans, etc
---
He used to frequent my main‚Äôs camp near whitespring station. I added turrets but he was fast AF. And I saw him a lot in the mire, doing Abbie‚Äôs quest. But also variants like diseased, and angry. The oddest was pensive?
---
He was in the way of the sensors I needed to repair and replace. Felt bad about having to kill him since he was just hanging out
---
Haven‚Äôt seen him in awhile since leveling my alt.
---
If you‚Äôre trying to find him I think you can do stuff that attract them, grabbing their eggs or frequent the lighthouse and loot the enlightened stuff
---
You seem to be alone in the beginning I give you that.
---
But well you are using a TS Gattling Gun together with MA. MA is currently glitched pushing the fire rate of the gun and the TS wont work the same after the patch since its getting nerfed 80% also. 
---
So one: You are exploiting a glitch since MA is intended to work for melee only but does currently otherwise.
---
And two: The TS is one endgame weaponry the will get nerfed to oblivon. Which is exactly my point TS and E will be useless after the patch. 
---
I am also sorry bruddah I did not mean to be so rude 
---
Keep scrapping the gauntlets. It will eventually give you the plan 
---
The entirely new hardcore pvp mode with no slap mechanics
---
You get like a minus point or a few minus points in a SPECIAL stat. I'm pretty sure it's in the stat the chem affects.
---
Wasn‚Äôt saying you per day just all the others that did but yup why it was used indeed!!
---
you were considered PvP the moment you've claimed the workshop the first time, that how this stupid mechanic works...
---
I genuinely don't understand whats you are trying to say, could you tl;dr your general thought ?
---
Something is not right. Yesterday I tried the long Recon scope and It didnt work either. It Just doesnt Mark the enemies. What now?
---
The mobs inside the mining hq will change. My first toon had to fight some very tough overleveled super Mutants while my last two just had some blind molemen. 
---
You entered pvp
---
K
---
Do you have the perk to make the spread better?
---
Wait....it's not Skyrim?
---
I think the simple answer would just be to allow camp boundaries to become abit closer and maybe square shaped in a certain zone.
---
I.e.
---
Instead of our traditional circles, there is a very large 4 player sized rectangle preplaced in several areas of the map. Maybe a foundation or a fenced off area?
---
Each player gets their own 1/4 of the rectangle in their own square corner. They can build literally adjacent to team mates and link to say an existing fence panel and share electric etc. This would help mitigate any issues with other players taking the space etc.
---
If you leave, your corner goes with and its on another player to build a replacement?
---
its not about being to easy. Its about lacking incentive to go on. If you remove the one tier being really effective in the game you also remove the motivation to farm for it. And since there is nothing else to do after the queen well that might not be to wise. 
---
Then I take the slap like a man, hope it doesnt hurt for you too much.
---
Keep it north or northwest of Watoga or that will happen.  Better water sources too.
---
I tried south and it was like a big sign for everything saying, "Please come break all this."
---
anytime i got one set up (and wasted a bunch of ammo and resources) i would start farming then the server would crash not long after and i never got a thing out of it.
---
Finished mine two days (finally) and it hasn‚Äôt come back. 
---
Then why not just play fo4... That's what it was made for.
---
It‚Äôs still a speculation on your side, no matter how often you copy your own message 
---
Yes, your speculation is logically sound - but it‚Äôs also Bethesda 
---
Lmfao I provide evidence and you still make up excuses. 
---
Good luck after the nerf and say hi to the queen for me when you take her down with my build.
---
Yeah, I got that, but I don't have a better one for the moment. I'm gonna test my two-shot and furious shotguns tonight and hope I still feel somewhat powerful.
---
True, I think i have ran across one before, there was a screech then a woosh and that was that, whatever it was was never seen
---
I'd much rather have Fallout 3/NV system, when mines and grenades were actual separate weapons. And one, at least, could use them in VATS.
---
That was him alright
---
While I would not say no to a free prize, I sadly have yo agree with you on this.
---
This would be no different than me buying a shirt, wearing it a bunch because I like it. Then a month or two later I see the same shirt on sale for 90% and throwing a temper tantrum at the store demanding free stuff because I paid more for the shirt two months ago.
---
I applaud your effort here bud but this one is totally over my head.
---
Sounds good in your head, but then they'd have no value. I had to kill maybe 2,000 ghouls at whitesprings to get the weapon I wanted, big effort = big reward.
---
If you consider legendary enemies "hard" I'd check your spec or maybe you're not even high enough level to deserve a powerful legendary anyways. Power armor does exist, you know.. Just because you don't want to use it doesn't mean it wouldn't make things a hell of a lot easier until you can get kitted out properly.
---
I think that you'd are flagged for PvP with the person who claimed the workshop from you when he started claiming it.. and it probably persists after he fully claimed it. 
---
So this would have been full damage rather than slap damage. Dependant on levels of players one-shotting at full damage is pretty common, even in PA. (I always go for a CRIT headshot, normally does the trick).
---
That's why antibiotics exist
---
There are some on the top floor of fort defiance and there is a fusion generator at the monorail elevator and at Huntersville ..I walked past both lastnight both had cores
---
Not worth, aim for TS/Bloodied/AA/Instigating, maybe Furious with high fire rate weapons. Others prefixes are just bad.
---
I am constantly checking the map before doing so, and it's really not a big deal for me to either walk away or server jump. I've gotten a lot of my plans from doing it. And I never fight back if someone wants to claim it.
---
Very cool!
---
Morgantown HS and any place with a cafeteria. You‚Äôre looking for plastic cafeteria trays plastic cups and plates, 
---
This include Lewisburg picnic and the creamery places
---
1) PS4
---
2) My mods are getting auto scrapped. Not sure exactly why, regardless shouldn't happen unless I select it to be junked. Much like weapons or armour.
---
3) Thanks for the work you're doing on and for the game. I'm enjoying it overall, just some minor annoyances like the above. (Only realized it after I just bought the X-01 jump pack mod. Put it in my stash and not five minutes later it was gone.)
---
yep, what the others said. The workshop give you a "This will initiate PVP" message when you claim it.. Then when the person takes it from you, and you enter back into the workshop area, you will be flagged as hostile. If he had any turrets set up, they would immediately start firing on you. 
---
plus the person was probably using a TSE weapon, which they are drastically nerfing in the next update due to it being overpowered. 
---
If its a 95% chance of a slap in V.A.T.S then I won't be worried at all.
---
And here's a good tip. Use Woodchuck in Luck to get double wood when gathering, and there's like 10 bags of concrete at the Monorail at Fort Defiance. Stock up on that stuff because that's gonna be most of the damage.
---
You can play games on that terminal - there are 8 games as far as I remember, some really fun ;)
---
Oh man, i cannot wait to find these now. Give them some payback for the hours of terror they caused me (and hours of frustration as they wrecked 100% completion runs) haha.
---
200 hours and still a level 13. Lol. 
---
Nerfing 2 shot absolutely sucks. Nerfing explosive damage only would've been fine
---
Ahh this is a known glitch then. Ive been looking for these for ages and ive only managed 2! This explains it!
---
Agreed, what I meant to say was being aware you may get killed.  Same thing happened to me, chameleon sniper, one shot.  I wasn‚Äôt even aware of that mechanic, that the workshop made me vulnerable, and now I do.  However, I do feel they helped at lower levels, with exp, supplies, plans and fast travel spots.  Great for a long day of adventuring.  
---
Yep, both Skeet Shooter and Enforcer. And one point in the 3 damage perks.
---
I too, like others have said, like this idea. It think the quest should be changed where you have to figure out which fissure is the prime site. 
---
I REALLY like this idea
---
It‚Äôs not a plan it‚Äôs a perk. You need the melee modder, level 3 and 5 mole rat teeth to add the 3rd blade
---
You can also control certain CAMP equipments from it, like spotlights
---
10/10 would read again
---
Upvoted
---
I say they put legendary mods in the game, allow me to scrap a legendary for a chance at the mod it has. It would give more use to legendaries and allow for different builds. Let me make my own legendaries so crafting isnt worthless. 
---
You use the terminal to control different turrets and camp items. You wire the terminal to them, and it gives you different options
---
sorry I sold a quad one just last night on xbox. They are around though lol
---
I think you‚Äôre right tbh I spent my whole day leveling bases and stealing workshops, made over 3K. The fun in raiding comes from the raiding. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll still enjoy this mode though
---
Cant find strangler blooms anywhere outside the Quest you make RadShield for.
---
I had a vampiric 10mm it gives you health only when you kill.
---
Ahhh ok. I don't have any turrets atm. I did have some but I am guessing it needs to be wired directly through them
---
I don't want to see anything that has a hymen that big. 
---
Bro have you run a queen recently? People are at the point where they run silos in 5 minutes then kill the queen before she even lands. 2se is so incredibly broken that there is no sense of achievement in beating the toughest boss in the game. And even then, I would say I'm only doing queens because I want cavaliers / sentinels gear that hasn't dropped for me yet.
---
I will still run queens after the 2shot nerf, I look forward to it. 
---
Things such as this will literally never happen as the server you join is random.
---
I really doubt they'll change this system.
---
Saw the vengeful mothman in the divide just outside sugar hill this weekend.
---
I also found that legendaries with increased speed while aiming didnt increase my speed compared to non legendaries either. If your move speed in fallout 4 was too high things started to get janky, thats probably why its capped. Probably also for "balance" lol. The game already struggles to load just sprinting for a while with speed demon. 
---
Pete was prob in crunch the last 3 months before the game came out, if you don‚Äôt already know Crunch is damn near a sweatshop 
---
Like I said, plants that don't grow a lot. Strangler Blooms grow outside of Dyer Chemicals. And I've only found ginger at Danbey's Workbench down at the bottom of the Mire. 
---
Like this idea I really 
---
I have 2 spares on PS4. 
---
Anyone know if there‚Äôs a fix for this yet? So annoying 
---
Let's acknowledge that the perk system makes no effing sense neither from a gamplay nor roleplay perspective.
---
I have a medic 2 lever can‚Äôt use it bc im too low but it‚Äôs coming out of storage when I‚Äôm tall enough to use.
---
It was a legit drop of a pitboss.
---
damnn im on the pc :|
---
He's not a coder, and his crunch is exactly at launch. Launch was a disaster with no one to do damage control. I'm not hating, enjoying the game very much, but these are cold hard facts.
---
if we had an option to switch server while in game it would be nice too instead of quitting
---
I definitely agree too, an option at the menu to "join last server" perhaps
---
or just give us a list of servers to choose as we wish?
---
It happened to me just yesterday 
---
You're right, there might be 1 or 2 more. 
---
Try taking the work shops in the middle of the black region, should give one of these. 
---
you don't lose anything...
---
I've never even gotten addicted to any Chem yet, even though I pop PsychoBuff whenever a big group of enemies or a Scorchbeast shows up.
---
I carry 4 Addictol just in case but I never get to use them.
---
I‚Äôve actually done all the workshops and defended them 10 times over. It‚Äôs almost like the game knows I‚Äôm looking for them and just refuses to let me have them ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You aren't really losing ammo.  The "Ammo Removed" messages always exist (as the game updates when you fire your weapon).  But they are hidden.  Occasionally you collect a plant, it causes the displayed messages to be visible, and you see the previously hidden ammo messages.
---
It's just a normally hidden message being displayed by you collecting items at certain times.
---
Issue with orientation and resource and ground level ?
---
Killing time til Anthem comes out. Playing through the game so I can make a firsthand assessment and judge it for myself. I‚Äôve done all the toughest content at this point and the only thing interesting left to do is build or help a friend with their quests. 
---
I wish they had just designed the game to be super persistent.. I guess private servers is what I want. A real changable wasteland. One I can come back to. Especially when something goes wrong. Lost so much junk and loot from shit. It's wild 
---
Sure is
---
This is rare? First time I went to whitesprings as a level 25 or so, I had zero clue what the area was, so it was very weird. I got this quest and killed one golfer goul, but then the crazy high level gouls started chasing me so I didn't finish it! Damn I had no idea it was rare to happen. Ha!
---
It should fit *under*, but block the head slot, and give something like -4 END, -4 AGI, -4 PER
---
This has no meaning in a game like fallout 76 and I know this is going to triggered fan boys who will accept this shit show of a game.
---
Or just let them vault you. Thats part of the game and its awesome. One nuke per hour, if someone hates you enough to nuke your town, you've been far in the game
---
Funny, neither can Bethesda!
---
Because of the game they are making Bethesda basically had to expect the unexpected, while also depending on the good will of the community. This might seem like they jumped the gun into the multiplayer market, but it didn't make sense to hold off because once it went live for the average player, average players would screw it up in their own way.
---
some fallout 4 stock builds are impossible on stock ps4s without light mods
---
For example?
---
Overseers might be something they add to over time as they add more content
---
That's the point with fireproof, you can melee with grenades
---
Wait does the sbq only turn up if certain places are nuked as a posed to anywhere that gets nuked ? 
---
Also what drives the decision of where to drop a nuke ? 
---
There was just an article saying the physical copies are being pulled from shelves and it's a sign the game might go free
---
Play the Uranium Fever event, I always get around 30 gauntlets and 4-5 plans every time. 
---
Plus a chance for a sweet legendary
---
I wish I knew what to tell you, Mine is working normally, and marks enemies even while I'm not aiming sometimes, just because it passed over them.
---
The bug is not that you lose ammo, the bug is that you‚Äôre getting debug feedback that you have used up ammo.
---
If you believe that it'll be anything but a 5 minute wonder, you're naive.
---
Pretty sure the weight of regular armor is counted on your total whether you equip it or carry it with you unequiped.
---
you have discord account? 
---
Cool that you apparently know what happened better than me, despite me being there and you not. I mean, it's Bethesda so we know the game behaves exactly as its intended, right? 
---
I take addictol for nothing alot lol I wonder if my character can get addicted to addictol 
---
yea, it'll take some trial and error.. not everything can be controlled, but some things give you different options.
---
Your best bet ATM is to do a check of who is on the server before a major event.  
---
You can then ‚Äòjoin‚Äô them from the social menu.  
---
It ain‚Äôt a great work-around, but it‚Äôs what we got.
---
One reason is that it could make duping easier.
---
Put item in container, force disconnect, restart, join last server, grab item from container.  No need for a second person/account.
---
Even if they're confident they've patch all the duping exploits, it'll take at least another patch cycle or two.
---
But I love hearing Sanjay's voice!
---
Considering they sold it as free DLC period, I think it should be free for the life of the game for those who paid for the game. 
---
Inception 2: Addiction
---
Total stack weight would be a greay addition.
---
Personally I'd like to see items list stash weight and carried weight. I recently freed up almost 50 lbs of stash after realizing the weights being shown were my perk weights and not the actual stash weight.
---
That's a shame. Thank you nonetheless !
---
I've been seeing this come up a lot lately, and it seems that it is part of a hack/cheat/major glitch. These level 0 players are mostly unstoppable
---
welcome to star wars galaxies
---
It‚Äôs _huge_. Bring supplies. 
---
We *can* but I'm scared of the unreasonable banhammer
---
Report it even if it's known. You can never give Beth too much info on bugs and such
---
It is not easy to get rid of tho. 
---
Would have to get rid of many other mutations. 
---
Would be a simple thing to just remove it from causing bounties on yourself because of a mutation. No other mutation would cause that. And like i said, you can say put on pacifist but it is still stupid to have the shock damage camps. Saying to put pacifist on, is the lazy way to never actually thinking about a problem in the game. It shouldn‚Äôt be a concept at all. And yes mutations have drawbacks lol
---
No where in the negative effects does it say ‚Äú you will get bounty if near a camp‚Äù. It should not be a thing. 
---
I swap perks around more than "presets" would facilitate. It would however be extremely useful to favourite cards so they appear first in the list
---
While I've never seen that I have seen high level player 100+ where the numbers are smushed together and it's hard to read thier level (ps4) so that could be a display glitch? Or maybe it's like the Y2K bug and levels reset to 0 after a certain level?
---
I'd make Bethesda aware of it though it may be of no fault of the players
---
I woke heartedly agree with you regarding armor and hazmat suits. It's kinda difficult sticking to a no power armor build if it's more or less required for nuke zones if you want any kind of damage protection. 
---
yes it is Signs and Letters
---
That was my experience, put a critical hit head shot from my gauss rifle into him (plus the rest of the clip) and saw no damage change then I just dropped.
---
I didn't even know what these looked like more less found one
---
Make sure you run bloody mess and adrenaline 
---
Thanks! Literally was gonna try it in an hour. 
---
Dedicated servers will probably be required for this to work. I hope they introduce them at some point. 
---
Yes. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do. Sometimes I get there and sometimes I don‚Äôt. And sometimes there‚Äôs no bag at all.  
---
This. Fireproof makes it so that the screams aren't anything but a visual distraction with some good armor. It's the other locals that sneak up and bite/shoot/hack.  GL.
---
If a trash developer like Wildcard managed to code unlimited stash for Ark players, I'm sure the fine folks at Bethesda could figure it out.
---
And yeah I am going to have to get rid of it lol 
---
That make me not want to use it and probably many other people will not either. So it will be a useless mutation and have no point to be in the game, which is why if they do a simple fix, it would be a lot better.
---
There‚Äôs a minimum weight for ammo, bought a full set online before realizing this
---
The golfers are the ghouls that are spawned with lvl 1-9. All  the ghouls spawned in whitespring at this lvl are golfers, because only these types of ghouls wear human outfits, while others have armor-like scraps or fixes filthy rugs upon them but not actually wearable dress items.
---
To spawn them I guess there needs to be a player of extreme low-lvl to enter whitesprings when its cleared or to stay there alone while ghouls respawn.
---
Nice!
---
Strangled blooms spawn around the event ‚Äúheart of the swamp‚Äù just walk around the general area of the ‚Äúheart‚Äù you have to destroy and you will find some. Just make sure you put on green thumb before you do.
---
You're probably right. frustrating they can't seem to patch that out. Must rely on something fundamental to the game.
---
Exactly how tall is your wife‚Äôs hair?
---
games have meaning?
---
Make a new character I would suggest a skilled gunslinger build to challenge yourself or a crazy explosive expert grenades, rocket launchers and mini nukes to destroy everything 
---
This? Like really, I idea
---
Major snu-snu
---
I make decent money off of chem sales. I have the weight reduction perks so I always have stacks to sell without bogging down my inventory.
---
No Scorchbeast? i mean they're the main antagonists in 76.. damn :(
---
I feel really bad for the assaultrons that keep trying to drag themselves around with their only working arm after I cripple them. I usually put them out of their misery. 
---
You gotta be friends right? Can you join a random person if you know their name? 
---
age has nothing to do with it as there is plenty of old folks who don't get it to 
---
I have an Anti armour one thats 1* if u want
---
Because FO76 is buggy on PS4, somehow that leads to the whole western games market struggling compared to Monster Hunter World?
---
Uh, western games are doing fine. Red Dead 2, Fortnite, FIFA... no idea what you're on about.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be friends.
---
Why did you remove it? 
---
Its funny and the truth!
---
*well i'll be damned. he did turn into a double behemoth!*
---
Or people are still working with stashes of millions (collectively) of duped items, and the bug has actually been fixed
---
I just hit level 25 yesterday. I‚Äôm going to start on my excavator armor today! 
---
In any Atmocis plant works. the Description is need to change.
---
Very very well said. I only get to play an hour to two hours a day. 
---
But fully agree with you.
---
Sometimes when I get time of work I get to fully appreciate this game for what it is. But mainly for what it can be. 
---
Thank you for putting this out there and hopefully somebody listens. 
---
You can find Lever action plans at some of the train stations, I think it was Sutton Station.
---
950c without max HB
---
820c with max HB
---
There are quite a few. If you check the map in the command room with the info terminals &amp; computers for officers/cargobot trackers, you can click on the push pins to mark them on the map. 
---
im on pc i only throw grenades if i hold it
---
its the bobbledead / magazine stacking glitch causing that. Not the TSE. Honestly I dont know about you but if I fire a normal gun on the queen it does not even do any seeable damage. Which it should having all perks and mods maxed out as a rifle man. 
---
What about the other way around? instead of nerfing TSE to death why not upping the other weapons? At least in a way that they actually are useful
---
I use his saber to end wasteland abominations with great vigor. 
---
They're so ugly they should be melted down for plastic scrap.
---
Wait for new content 
---
Well apart from the first 15 to 20 levels.. its pretty easy. 
---
Its only hard when it comes to dealing with bugs and server crashes.
---
An online game needs a critical player mass to be an active, living community. this would maybe help in a few months/ years.
---
Bu it all depends on the business plan on forward.
---
End game is absolutely focused on power armor users. Good luck going into any nuke zone without power armor. Throw on that hazmat suit and you might as well be baby you from fallout 4 with a gun. 
---
Well you just provided evidence that you are explointing a glitch and use the weapons that are getting nerfed. Good job! 
---
I never saw one of those post before
---
I just walked in to whitesprings golf club and caught a spawn. Some 40ish level asshat was there with a lower level probably pulling for her. Once I had cleared the downstairs I moved up and he started calling me names. I ignored him at 121 nothing he could really do to me. I intended on giving them room or helping pull higher levels. About that time asshat went to my camp behind the club and started destroying it. I intentionally built it there with no guns bc I strongly dislike the missile bombardment nonsense I have been seeing lately. Anyway asshat catches a little bounty, I amble over to bonk him and swing a few times with no effect, to be fair it took way long that it should for me to realize I was in pacifist mode. The whole time he is talking smack. When I switched it off I started lagging very bad and couldn't get to him so I shoot him with my two shot rifle. down he goes. A few minutes later he is back at my camp whacking away again. I grab my grenade launcher drop two on him and boom he is gone again. 5 minutes later asshat jr. brings 5 guys to my camp a level 120 is breaking my stuff, 5 of them are crowded around him to catch a stray round. It pissed me off but pretty effective as a griefing technique. At that point I was over it and bounced.
---
You also get +20% resist from razor grain soup and + 25% for high food and 25% for high water making it a solid food source for the disease ridden player 
---
also snag a hazmat suit and you can get hundreds of water with basically no radiation boil it all down have the 90% less food and water perk and the good with salt perk its good for nearly a weeks worth of play in 1 sitting 
---
same thing happened but a legendary left leg. WHY THE F*** do they allow putting gear into a quest depository?!?
---
Im in tears. So good.
---
Hopefully they get that part straightened out, and find a way to completely block duping.. however, the ability to rejoin a server will really make taking over a workshop worth it. Disconnections are the biggest reason that workshops mainly stay dormant.. you put resources into defending it, then boop!! gone.. Even if they programmed something that detected a crash or disconnect from a server, that held your place for like 3 mins, and would give you the option to rejoin the same server.
---
&gt; That sounds like an awful grind instead of a rewarding process.
---
Is that not what it is now? 
---
This could be neat. So far the whole "you need to rebuild" thing has been underwhelming.
---
Seen a stalking mothman in the mire and had a vengeful mothman get stuck in my home and kill me. Only two enemy ones I‚Äôve came across so far
---
Beat me to it.   Agreed.  üëç
---
\+20% from razor grain soup to 
---
personally I recommend never taking off a gas mask as it helps with airborne and for some odd reason water diseases if you fall in 
---
This would be great. It would be nice to use the Blade of Bastet and Voice of Set together for the MoM quests.
---
Oof, my feelings.
---
If not shields at least let us dual wield one handed or unarmed melee. 
---
Basically the servers can only hold a certain number of bags present in the world at once, so there‚Äôs always a chance that any bag you drop that doesn‚Äôt have an anchor, will get lost just like how enemies you kill just disappear.  But what many people don‚Äôt realise, is they can suddenly reappear again if the memory gets freed up again. 
---
You also must understand that theres a great amount of players with nothing more to do, so they're hungry for more content. 
---
If BGS wants this game to survive they must start introducing new content and develop the main story.
---
Its a good thing people want more content!!
---
Why? Because Bethesda did not market this game for solo players. It is meant for teams and PVP, anything else is an after thought and only included to placate those of us you like going it alone. In today's PC world I'm surprised they have not been hauled over the coals for discrimination against those players who for what ever reason don't have friends to tag along with or prefer to play solo.
---
I think they should do it like many of those early access survival games do it where you join a server from a big list. I know usually they're player hosted servers but they don't have to be. But maybe they won't do that because it may show the amount of players playing the game and I have to assume that it's not a whole ton of people so they don't want the public to know it. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen this one before.  Console?  PC?  
---
Anyone else seeing this?
---
I actually try to trade people when I see them I trade plans / bulk junk / food / water / stims for pretty low caps it helps clear my inv and I can snag a few plans I'm missing from them 
---
PC, i know at least one guy who has the same problem.
---
You don't have to be friends. The social menu shows players from the last server and you can join them. Negative side is since you don't know them, they're less inclined to accept.
---
I had one the other night that was all protectrons.
---
&gt;Guessing the bug multiplies by whatever you have stored, so 0 always gives 0
---
No, I have had this bug just once each after the last few patches, but I didn't have anything stored in my CAMP budget.
---
I don't get why you don't own it while you're gone. Making them persistently owned means you'd be forced to take it if you really wanted it. Sorta forcing PVP. At least it would simulate faction owned headquarters. Something to actually fight over
---
You act like there's stuff to do in the other games after you beat them. 
---
also chally is basically a moving shield grahm will murder anything that attacks 
---
On the same page as you. In going for tge trophies and challenges. But they're bugged as hell. "Discover location c" for example, ive discovered every location in the game and still the challenge is incomplete.
---
Im too waiting eagerly for more stuff to do.
---
The idea is that PA should not be the only option for players. As the current endgame is all the stupid nukes, and on the other side the game itself suggests by having plenty non-PA perks that non-PA is a gamestyle, it should be doable for nukes too. Hazmat suit should be a underwear slot and can have stat/armor penalties. 
---
I already use bloody mess  and I cant run adrenaline without sacrificing rilfe perks, tank killer or glowing in perception which would nullify the use for a rifle build. Ok, maybe glowing if attacking the queen.
---
The entire first area is a safe zone
---
Oh yeah, if someone has to accept than I'm screwed. I sent dozens of team requests in the beginning of the game. Nobody ever accepted. Lone wanderer is too strong a perk 
---
That's a shame. I didn't get why people liked lever action so much until gating a base one .45 a few days ago. It's **insanely** satisfying to fire and makes much more damage at base than my modded combat rifle.
---
Today Fallout 76 gave me a black screen while in my camp, had played a couple hours already and only been disconnected once during it.  Couldn't get to desktop or do anything at all from the black screen. Rebooted and after 2-3 sec of seeing my windows 10 login screen the screen went black. I can enter my login password and hear usual desktop sounds but screen stays black.
---
I7 970. 32 ram SSD 
---
Tried to cause pc to give option to start safe mode by hold power button shortly after power on, but still had black screen.
---
Wondering if vid driver corrupted I replaced the nvidia with a much older radeon card.  Then on boot windows logo replaced the usual login pic I had and similarly after 2-3 sec went to black screen, pc rig lights happily blinking away but nothing to see on screen.  Was able to cause the windows please wait to occur by powering off during windows start so I think I was going to get the option for safe mode but the screen went black after that 2-3 sec interval.
---
Ideas anyone?
---
My next option is getting a new boot drive and reinstalling windows.  Fallout 76 would be obliterated if I had a disc.  At level 43 all for nothing, will never try it again. I can never get that wasted time back, will try a refund though and never touch fallout 76 again...
---
I dont think it includes the had, I managed to complete it while wearing the clown costume and faschnat (or whatever) man mask.
---
Is this the same issue as crash to desktop?  You have to relaunch the game?  I recall seeing a fairly descriptive post the other day, it seems like game files corrupted after last update for some peeps.   Probably weak patch coding on Bethesda, but IIRC in the post was a procedure you could do to make game work.
---
Aggravating, I know.
---
I think there's a lot of factors that people haven't fully figured out when dealing with the Scorch beasts. I've ready that killing off the scorched humans helps make the beasts land. I can't confirm that. 
---
But they don't always just spam their sonic attacks. And they are certainly killable. 
---
The best I've found is they need a spot that's landable, otherwise they will just hover and spam. 
---
We took the workbench at Monogohah and the first defend the workbench was three scorch beast. 3 of us, between levels 56 and 80. They all landed one after another while we spent time taking out the scorched humans that would spawn.   
---
[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxeCl5OXQAAaumt.jpg:large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxeCl5OXQAAaumt.jpg:large)  
---
My view is that the is no one method to dealing with everything in the game, but people certainly like to take that approach. Take Super Mutants and Mirelurks have high armor. People always want to melee them, because guns take a long time. While melee is much faster.
---
But what's even faster, a few frag grenades. There's always a chance to cripple them this way. A limping Mutant/Mirelurk is easy to pick off with a gun. 
---
Tesla Guns are great against robots. Especially when they all group and it arcs to many of them. 
---
We went into the Observatory, which spawned crazy amounts of Liberators all bunched up together. I took out so many with a Tesla Rifle it was fun.   
---
As for scorch beast, I've heard people say that taking cover doesn't work. But then they tell how it was behind a car, or a pile of junk. That's not really cover. 
---
When me and my friends were to low to give them a serious fight, and we'd get attacked  by them, we'd all run looking for buildings and such. It has to be a good enclosed building. The quality of building is important.
---
Even trees will soften the damage from the sonic attack, if there's enough. 
---
But the acid cloud attack gets everywhere when it crop dusts. Don't sit there, cause it eats through your hit points and really does some damage to your gear. 
---
I'm only assuming they have to accept, never actually tried it myself since I never DCed at an important moment (thankfully)
---
I think they understand tho idk
---
Good point, under could be cooler.  I dig your idea on having negatives.
---
Giving it a slight edge DR wise would be awesome imo, but not to a point to make things no challenge at all.  A balance in a way that some players would want to use it, and some would still want their PA.
---
This game is insanely easy compared to fallout 4 survival mode. I'm going to be honest, i thought from the title you were arguing the game was hard.
---
Survival mode didn't get put into fallout 4 until a year a later though, and I don't remember how long it was on New Vegas but it was after launch as well.
---
to be fair though, game crashes on survival mode made you really really really pissed. but saving was way different to.
---
It has improved but still a long way to go.
---
Try it, it wont hurt. :)
---
No I get that but my armor has 20% weapon weight reduction and it‚Äôs not changing my weight 
---
Do you go in solo, and where do you bunker down?
---
I guess that is sound, since a guy stacking bobbleheads wouldn't inspect you, just flat out murderize someone. 
---
As far as paranoia, wouldn't it be proper RP to be paranoid in this game? One can of course coexist and apply fake smiles &amp; platitudes to others in the wastelands...but at the end of the day it would still be dog eat dog. Deep down a lone wanderer is conscientious of that. 
---
LOL, nice one...
---
Idea? Really, I like this
---
Queen only appears at Fissure Site Prime.
---
how much ammo are you using for the queen? cause my 50 cal just kept eating it up leaving just a bit of dmg at the queen. I admit not heaving heavy maxed though
---
I have the clown costume, but I can't get the Wendigo to wear it.
---
Do you really think they would do that? They would probably just give EVERYONE like 100 
---
Yep they changed mobs type. Its a bit silly imo but not that important anyway.
---
So to make my guns effective. I have to sneak and use a weapon that forces me to be near death? That's fucking tight 
---
what we need is the environmental armor from Fallout tactics (don't start cannon with me I'm talking the idea) 
---
its basic idea was that it was a armored hazmat suit that was supposed to be less armor then a full suit of combat armor but had high resistance to rads this would give people a armor they could wear into a rad zone without being forced into power armor 
---
they could have a mk1 (standard) armor and a mk2 (heavy) armor version and make it craftable as a quest line and have legendary pieces for doing a event mission 
---
Exploring is great for finding quests!
---
Just put a wanted ad on one of the trade subs- i see them often in the lists of people's crap for sale when they're trying to make stash space.
---
Why is the same article getting reposted EVERY DAY? 
---
There's plenty of plans I haven't seen yet in ~300 hours. What you have or haven't seen in 50 isn't much of an indicator of what's in the game.
---
Your diaper needs changing, call your mom.
---
I just got mine the other day as well. It makes me think that they changed something with the recent update.
---
I was looting whitesprings, noticed I picked up two of the ten kills needed... 6 server hops later, bam.... All feral ghouls spawned at no higher than lvl 9.. I didn't even use any ammo, just let the Tesla mod for PA kill them. It was glorious.
---
You can get shot over 100 times but you're worried about getting a disease twice in 30m.... 
---
Why is this post getting spammed here? Are you coming from a 4chin post, a troll discord, or a disgruntled youtuber? If you go back all of these claims come from reddit and you're giving a trash site clicks with clickbait lol
---
I thought people did 1 damage until you attacked back? Though I haven't played much. 
---
Sounds like he could have been hacking if he was no where near you and was killing you in one hit. Hmm
---
I'd think those that paid should just get a permanent 50% discount on ATOM shop. 2-3k ATOMs go quick if you like buying that stuff
---
Alot of duping issues currently, many use it to make instakill weapons and crazy shit like that. Alot of times they give these weapons to low level players to see what they do, much like giving a chimp an AR
---
Well, at least I get a blue screen so I‚Äôm not completely in the dark.
---
It doesn't crash to desktop, the screen just goes black, i can hear the game, even move and do anything that i can normally do within it. Can't even shutdown PC normally, have to do the "long" restart. This bug has been with me since release, but it seems to happen more often now.
---
I searched the board today and went back almost 2 days and didn't see a post, sorry. I supposed it got buried.
---
Nerds are angry so they started a spam campaign
---
I want ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt it be nice‚Äô to play on a loop in Whitesprings as you try to do the feral golfer mission as 500 players transcend on the place for legendary farming :(
---
I had this idea, and so have others, I think it would be great.
---
There could be a craftable item, Photo Frame. And when you make it, it brings up your photo's and you select it and it's placed in the frame.
---
When you go into build mode, it's there as a special item. 
---
I'd love a collection of photos of my adventures in Appalachia. 
---
i agree, but lets come back to this once I've sold the ~50+ golf outfits im carrying. 
---
Just because you keep repeating it doesn't make it truuuue
---
But that just affects the weight of the base item of that specific armor piece, not your whole equipped armor.
---
So if you have a piece of armor that normally weighs 10 pounds, and you get a 20% reduction mod, it weighs 8 pounds.  Then you add in the weight of any mods ontop of that.
---
It doesn't change the weight of all your armor.
---
Here's where the elitist comes out.
---
Not every build is supposed to be able to solo them. Melee builds finally have something to fear. Gunslingers are glad they're quick on their feet to get out of the way of this thing they don't have the equipment for. Shotgunners glare angrily at this flying asshole just out of reach of their buckshot's full damage hits.
---
But auto riflemen steel themselves and get something with a big mag ready, power-armor heavy gunners start chasing the poor little bats down, stealth snipers laugh maniacally as the witless animals circle trying to find their attacker all the way until the big bastards bite it. The first two rely on chain staggers for some safety, and it is very effective, the third is invincible by being invisible.
---
It's all about composition, this game was made for teams and diversity in character effectiveness from encounter to encounter. That auto rifleman is an all-rounder as far as dealing with different encounters. The heavy gunner hates snipers and anything that has something he *needs* to take cover from, that sniper can't do CQC as effectively as he'd like and is pretty screwed when spotted and outnumbered.
---
This is a multiplayer-focused game with player-built classes. Don't play a healer expecting to tank etc. And really those scorchbeasts are pretty fun to fight in a group.
---
Cool story, Bro .................................................................................................................................................................................
---
If it was someone like polygon or Forbes or some other major news company on games I would believe it but Iv never heard of this source before. Until we start hearing it more from other sources I wouldn‚Äôt take it for more hen a grain of salt. On a side note is there anyone on here that‚Äôs from Australia that can confirm that they are pulling them?
---
I am aware of that, bit it doesn't relate to anything else on the post
---
It's a graphic glitch. You don't actually lose anything I've checked
---
I play with my lil bro. Always share loot and ammo with each other. Even grab whatever ammo the other person needs. Make a pretty good team 
---
Got me pegged wrong literally just searched fallout 76 news this morning while watching my son then saw nothing recent posted about it on reddit.
---
Alright Gran Torino.
---
Imo not enough. I'm on ps4 and the game crashes frequently. Server loves to lag and occasionally dc. More bugs have come from "fixes" .. Faster travel black screen with hud now is a big one. Some of the supposed fixes aren't helping. Like the momma dolce event now just rewards stew to you not the whole server. Fusion cores deplete really fast now just from walking around.
---
But there's a perk to lessen the drain... Seems like my play way of playing is having no weapon buffs and all kinds of weight reducing perks. Energy weapons still suck balls even though there some of the most powerful weapons in the canon lore.  
---
I still play kinda.. But personally I'm level 68 and bored as hell. Even with a friend or two.. Whitespring got needed and people only ever really nuked two places..
---
Looking at anthem next. And there's outer worlds being released this year by the team that did fo3 and new Vegas.
---
This would be awesome!
---
It doesn't fit the story on the holo unless they are ghouls.
---
As much as I dislike griefing and pvp, I also accept that this is part of the game. 
---
PVP assholes are annoying, but it's not like you can't semi get rid of them.
---
Someone bothers me too much I'll block them on xbox and server hop. The only way they're following me at that point is through the luck of running into one another 
---
What is that. Is that Rambo?
---
I'm not angry at all. Just a suggestion for Bethesda to do what's right.
---
they should just do like the ESO houses and let people buy them and then any friend can just fast travel to it and since its a indoors location they wouldn't have to worry about its effect or if several people on the server owned it 
---
also since it wouldn't need defenses you could really build it large with less moving parts making it still stable to the game world and nice design 
---
maybe have 4 starting ones with themes  
---
a responder style out door location maybe in the woods in a nice flat grassland (off the edge of map so wouldn't be a issue) 
---
a free states style bunker
---
top of the worlds 2nd floor for the raiders 
---
a vault tech style bunker for enclave bos or vault tech themed build
---
In most MMOs PvP is a minor blip of the player base at most. In FO76 that is still true. It is very rare for people to fight over a workshop or anything else. If you go around attacking people just because you can then you can also expect them to complain to Bethesda and since they outnumber you probably 100 to 1 in the end Bethesda will listen and the game will get some kind of PvE only mode. That is just the inevitable direction of these things. 
---
I got a PA edition because I am a fallout tan all the way since the first one. hopefully they‚Äôll go by purchase price because 3k atoms is far from being equivalent to the PA price tag. 
---
Do t get me wrong, I don‚Äôt regret buying it one bit and I actually enjoy the game bugs and all. But if this is true then... poney up the CA$H!
---
that place is a gold mine, but people server hop and farm the shit out of it. a great majority of my visits there have yielded nothing.
---
Do you communicate using emotes to?
---
Yeah you should go exploring a bit and gain a few more levels. Inside the asylum (bos hq) theres a few dozens of ghouls and a glowing wendigo. Its not easy for a level 34.
---
Just track back a bit and explore easier areas before you go in the asylum. 
---
The quest will later lead you to something that you really need to be around level 50ish to complete. 
---
If you need help im level 83 on ps4. ;)
---
It keeps getting removed because it's spammed so much. I can link a few different ones from yesterday from my comments. It got posted like five or six times
---
Let us nuke fissure site prime to spit on de fake qween
---
And then that scrap melted down into lower quality other scrap.
---
They would absolutely never do that, they offered 500, for compensation of an irl bag 
---
That's part of the new yt meta for "news" channels, invade gaming communties with clickbait. Its like free advertising anytime said yt bloviates over highly questionable sources.
---
There is nothing funner than going to that first overseer's camp in  a Mr Fuzzy outfit and handing out bladed rocket ballbats (cheap to make) to noobs.
---
I can make you one if you would like, and you are on PS4. 
---
Be part of the world however fits your playstyle best. 
---
Clear out Fort Defiance and keep the defenses repaired as a local BoS leader. Put on the Enclave gear and demand 'voluntary donations' to help rebuild Appalachia, then call in orbital strikes on people who refuse. Be a real-life Mysterious Stranger and snipe enemies attacking new players before vanishing with a wave. Go full-on Raider for a while, although that could get expensive with the bounty.
---
More content would be better, of course, but until then it'll be a more enjoyable time playing if you find something that entertains more than just grinding for gear. 
---
Idea: make her 'pile of meat' spawn scaled up to 6 feet tall. Therefor unique and easy to find
---
Well it definitely does not include the hat, at least for me. The suit is enough to complete it.
---
Camden park vendor sell the plans as well.
---
Hell yea!  I like that thought!  Wasn‚Äôt known to me about tactics, but knowing it basically was gives me hope it could be again.
---
It most likely means the junk item Trifold American flag or its weathered variant. 
---
Choose whichever playstyle you like. That's what fallout is all about. This video simply shows how pre-nerf TSE weapon are by no means the meta.
---
My terminal allows me to open my keypad door from inside my compound because I chose to have the keypad on the outside.
---
Yes, that was also my understanding how PVP should work 
---
I also didn‚Äôt hear a shot or see any explosion - just wall crumbling and then death. The rhythm before I dropped dead matches hunting rifle or lever action 
---
Omg of course... thank you!
---
? It was giving you garbage or it wouldn't load all. ? both depressingly common 
---

No it isn‚Äôt as it is slang for vietcong who are not an ethnic or racial group. 
---
Got mine at the Theme Park vendor a few days ago while doing fuzzy token daily. Maybe swing that way?
---
"News" Flair, title states "Rumor"
---
pick one.
---
You are correct and they are wrong. 
---
I lol'd at "Wood chucker perk".  
---
Last night he spawned at my camp
---
Ehhh games cost money so sometimes its a good idea  to listen if millions of people are telling you its a shit game and not to waste yours on it. I remember being super hyped for No Man's Sky and Star Wars: Battlefront when they were first announced and now I'm glad I listened to those that complained about it so much. 
---
Bounties just aren't a punishment. They just get a friend to claim it anyway
---
You can get shot over 100 times and drink a soda to fix it but you're worried about getting a disease twice in 30m....   
---
Exactly
---
You guys will all be crying here if it does go f2p that you want compensation and a 10,000 up vote post on it so seriously gtfo. Yall are hypocrits until it actually happens.
---
Very true!
---
So this is based on an article based on a rumour started by the youtuber TheQuartering?     
---
   
---
A youtuber who seemingly (just checked over some of his videos - never heard of him before) generates his revenue with clickbaity and controversial videos?    
---
    
---
Lets wait and see what actually officially happens. 
---
Where have you been?
---
And you know that we here at the reddit can create rumors about games and the "game press" will take it seriously, because they want clicks/visits? This is how pro these people are.
---
You can do it too. Just try it. 
---
Meh, i‚Äôve had $60 worth of fun since November with so I‚Äôm cool with it
---
Endangerol does nothing and is bugged. You're wasting your time with it. Furious has a low damage cap on it, so it pales in comparison to other effects. The smart choice would have been to make a modest reduction in TS/E, but raise the effect of zealot/furious/executioner.
---
Me too, I used to play the game with VERY LOW graphics settings, after a GPU upgrade I started having these issues with small hickups and shit(gotta work on my cfg files yet), before that, not a single problem, very minor bugs here and there but watching people set the world on fire was kinda crazy to me since I was having such a "smooth" gameplay.
---
Where‚Äôd you manage to find that?
---
That mohagan place just north east of there 
---
Oh.. lol nope doesn't seem so at so. Perhaps it's just awkward nervousness, like from the movie?
---
\*high risk low reward\*
---
Yeah walking around with a TSE weapon where if people engage you will definitely win and 1 shot them is real high risk.  
---
A playstyle where they get bounties then get a friend to claim it is really high risk.
---
I know, that's the one I want, the Jet Black paint for my power armor 
---
why even bother, there are only a few disease that are actually worth curing.
---
Shell shock is really the worst of all, and the only one I ever cure aside from the -2str one situationally. The rest fade after an hour or two and don't really impede your ability to do stuff.
---
Why should we have to optimize your play?
---
So why do I see white springs nuked so much ?
---
Not enough to quantify a drastic change. I would recommend waiting.
---
Why don't you just start a new game and character? You'd love to 'one shot every player you see' with a weapon that does 900 damage?  Why would you think that would be fun? You're a dick-head if you'd want to do that to other players who are at a lower level.
---
Get involved with other players. Involvement in the economy has been really fun for me and many of my friends are trying out PvP. Playing with new builds and farming the queen for serum recipes extends the life some, but not too much
---
I get one every trip to blackwater minr
---
There was plenty of re-play value in other fallouts. This one isn't nearly as much
---
yeah i get the eternal loads too.
---
I think it‚Äôs next week 
---
I look forward to the next post you regurgitated from two nickles and a dime.
---
Sorry to aim the queston to you, but dont want to create a post for a similar case. If someone started to claim my workshop and I'm in the area, but not attacked him/her or tried to stop/hold the claiming. Am I already engaged in PvP with them? Got one shot a several times now. So was it a glitch or claming others workshop makes you free to kill the owner?
---
The linked article is astroturfing at its finest.
---
Wouldn't load at all. 
---
Hold on. How do i get this quest?
---
I wish they would I have to much junk 
---
must be a slow news day over at segmentnext
---
I feel stupid...I didnt know there was a vendor inside the enclave
---
Nerf hasnt been implemented and the last 3 queen kill attempts Ive attended have all failed utterly.      
---
I guess the remaining player base is just poorly equipped? 
---
reinstalled, crashed after 8 minutes, uninstalled.
---
Ok but what I understand from this is that F76 have many flaws. Well, everyone know that. If I understood right, you consider the main issue of the game is that 
---
&gt; you can play their games with whatever individualized play-style so it's basically impossible to beta test especially when you put all these individuals in the same server. 
---
But like in any game, players play the best builds/character/thing they can. It's very obvious whats wrong with balance : some perks cards/mutation/prefixes are too strong and everyone can have them all at the same time (Blocker, Lone Wanderer, Dodgy, Elusive, Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, Adrenal Reaction, TS, Bloodied, Explosive), lots of legendaries effects are trash and eventually, every ennemies get obliterated beside Queen which has way too many health. These thing are very easy to spot in a beta of one month. 
---
And I don't agree with the link you made between F76 being a rushed game and the western market. Quality is not a matter of part of the world/mentality.
---
Do the black splotches creep into your sight and infect the whole screen until it‚Äôs all black?
---
If so, I know the solution - delete the two .ini data‚Äôs from your documents fallout 76 folder and have the Bethesda launcher repair the game 
---
Also disable all options that are connected to shadows - even if it mean editing the .ini data 
---
You do realize that this would not only affect TSE weapons, but any weapon with E on it?
---
Astroturfing?
---
The experience I've had so far was getting the error screen before getting into the game and then making it to the first overseers camp thingo before stopping So I haven't got much to go off.
---
I decided to give it a few weeks or a month to see if things improve though. 
---
I assume you know that it can take ages. If a lot of people are participating it can take upwards of 5 minutes. That's a bummer yo. Probably had the queen do that once 
---
If you have turrets and he accidentally hit your base but the turrets hit him then you would become pvp enabled to him thanks to your turrets. There is a lvl 5 TSE that is hard to come by but is out there. In this case based on what your saying, he probably accidentally hit your base messing around and once your turrets hit him he decided to kill you (probably just to be an a**). But in this case I‚Äôm going to assume that is what happened. 
---
I don't think so. Upon death is when XP shows up. Now sometimes they can fly off and die via turrets, if they're repaired and you've hit them at least once. It probably has a time out though. Looks like you got fucked over :(
---
I didnt know Clint Eastwood roleplaying wss a thing
---
and no more fucking rolling pins.
---
Yeah... bit surprised to see a Strength, a Radtoad, so much odd power armor... but no Scorched, Scorchbeast, Rose, Protectron Vendors, Ultracite PA...
---
Queen didn't drop shit and corpse disappeared also.
---
They should add a new mod making the old ones worthless like a furious tse or junkies tse or whatever 
---
I think City of Heroes had a good F2P transition that stands as an example for other games to follow. I don't expect bethesda to go as far as they did, but a 50% discount would be a good place to start
---
Judging by the level, can't be a good gun, maybe that bubblehead stack bug people talk about?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Some (but not all) of the Modus terminals (the screens with the faces  on the pedestals) function as vendors. I probably would have missed them too if I didn't have the compulsive habit to hover my pointer over everything.
---
They have very low defence but powerful and fast attacks, the key is to shoot and keep it at a distance. If nothing else try with a grenade launcher lol
---
The screen just turns black in a matter of seconds. I already tried deleting prefs.ini, haven't tried just Fallout76.ini or shadows, but will in a second.
---
I just want to be able to darm half decent legendaries. They're either shitty and lvl 50 or half decent and low levels for me!
---
I make sure to completely repair each area or I get turned around and confused by the optional quest markers.
---
Is it more stable? No. What I would suggest though is get on and do the daily/weekly challenges so when you do come back to play for good you have a ton of Atom waiting for you.
---
Im doing those too! 
---
But I find many of those challenges to be bugged. Ive already discovered those locations at toxic valley and still the challenge remains incomplete. :/
---
What, the new PvP mode?  Judging by recent changes I dont have my hopes up either.  But any new content is content at this stage.  Events are bugged are not worth doing.  SBQ is laggy and unrewarding.  PvP is the only thing keeping me playing this game right now.
---
Google?
---
TSE will still be good, but not gamebreaking.
---
They're actually not that hard if you use a  melee weapon. The heavy hit staggers them and gives you time to throw in some extra hits. 
---
Did you expect this game to be good? Bethesda has been getting worse and worse for years. After ESO I called this shit happening. 
---
Source: trust me guys
---
There aren't really any TSE guns that are level 5 that are being mass distributed. It sounds like another exploit
---
There's a cave with them.  You also get them as a quest reward.
---
It was a huge improvement for me to realize there *was* a service entrance. I was using the front vault door and elevator for soooo damn long!
---
But it does with ranged weapons, and gun bashing uses the power attack key.
---
No they didn't.
---
Ps if that happens CTRL ALT DEL and sign out. Forces everything closed but don‚Äôt have to wait for a full reboot cycle. 
---
That happened to me last night. Disconnected from server with 2 mins left, get back in, queen dead and I get nothing plus she disappeared.  So sad.
---
Scumbag OP.  Flexes loot and doesn't say where they found it.
---
depends how long the fight lasts, anywhere from 1k to 3k and which weapons im switching between. my best weapon is a 2se harpoon gun but it breaks so fast I enjoy the 50cal more even if its less damage. the roar of several 50 cals firing at once is music to my ears
---
&gt;or make it so turning on/off pacifist is easier/faster, like put it in social menu when you select yourself there is a toggle....too much time to go thru map then into option then back out of all those menus
---
That would be a great way to do it. Put it as an option under your name at the top of the social overlay, with the leave team and leave world options. Go from being like a couple dozen button presses to toggle on or off, to like 3 or 4.
---
No other terms came to my mind for using rumors, false logic and wild estimations to infer the business state and strategy of a company 
---
.... shotguns only get 1 extra pellet from two shot, so the 2-shot nerf actually doesn‚Äôt affect them much. Hell if they nerfed two shots but fixed two shot shotguns it‚Äôd actually be a buff. 
---
He's not saying the weight of the armor should change. He's saying the weight of weapons should change if he's wearing armor that reduces weapon weight by 20%. And AFAIK, that does affect weapon mods. My heavy weapons go down to 4 lbs with 4x pieces of weapon weight reduction armor
---
"Is it a bug or a feuture?"
---
"Yes"
---
This game is too easy. 
---
I believe the cap is 4 pieces on armor. You do get the benefit of not having to waste points on batteries included and bandolier
---
Find and beat wastelad, its the new RPG game for 76
---
My current version is much better, and I already want to start over, because I know there are improvements to be made. 
---
To his credit Phoenix does respond differently in my experience. I was rocking a Vaultsuit for a long time and he said something along the lines of "Why don't you trade that Vaultsuit in for a uniform?" (The Harpers Ferry bot also commented on my being a vault dweller, calling it "novel")
---
I don't know if it's just because I completed the BoS questline or because I'm wearing the BoS underarmor now but Phoenix refers to me as soldier now. Haven't been back to him since switching to wearing cultist gear over my armor so I'll have to see if his dialogue changed at all. 
---
Oh good to know. I stopped after the 2nd one gave me 8 bullets and some purified water
---
Kiddie's corner at Whitespring.
---
Loads of higher level ghouls spawn there that drop legendary loot
---
I'd use that out of shear principle... 
---
Tough shit.  If people didnt request all the time then nothing would get done.  Hell even Bethesda didnt release proper patch notes until the community screamed and shouted.
---
Be patient?  It's been over 2 months and nothing substantial has been fixed in the game, never mind new content.  If you're bored with hearing it then go somewhere else.
---
Just tell your friends you really love uranium and it's getting you down
---
I see you've not played around with a sneak crit or vats build....
---
The salon in Whitespring has one in the last booth.
---
Dude scroll down a few posts there was someone that already posted and don‚Äôt believe t till someone else reports on it.
---
Self decor much like the bobble heads of olden days. 
---
Can't you wait 15 min ?
---
Replied 
---
I just did, in a red rocket
---
Do the quality of the legendary go up if a place is nuked?
---
My base is just a little shack with the basics, not hard to rebuild. Can't imagine what they would get out of leveling it though.
---
Maybe I'll just store everything when I'm not there, problem solved.
---
Best song in FO4
---
Read the title - "looks like", "could go". Nothing is concrete. Only speculations. It is entirely possible it will if they change the payment model to microtransactions. I'd hate to see it happen though.
---
I'm sorry but did you watch the video? I don't know how others are equipped. All I'm showing is how there are viable alternatives to the perceived TSE meta for killing the queen.
---
To be honest, I'm a PVE only player and even I don't like it.  Mainly it has to do with the animation in first person being super annoying and futzing up my view of the action.  I suppose I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and re-buy my serums and do a mutation refresh.  If you check out some of the trading discords you can regularly find people selling serums for 500 caps per, or free if your bring mats.
---
It‚Äôs not that dude, it‚Äôs that PTSD is a very real thing and shouldn‚Äôt be made light of. 
---
What previous generations as well the current generation have endured to ensure that the world we live in is as free as possible is something we should be greatful for. 
---
I think the worst offender is there is no consistent hotkeys. They change from each menu. Scrap with R while scrapping, scrap with G while modifying equipment. Tracking msising components is sometimes X, sometimes Q. Please jsut give us consistent hotkeys so you don't keep misclicking in the menus.
---
You shouldn't have join SBQ fight with that low level - you leech only and her health bar prolong because of you. Looks like group doesn't done enough damage to kill her within 30 minutes and she flew away...
---
okay I really simplified this, but that's not what I said or meant. lol though video game are more popular in the east, as well the culture of gaming is different. But hey that doesn't mean every game in the west are bad. they just have different business methods. 
---
Fifa is a sports game.... don't bring it up. PERIOD
---
Fortnite is F2p, and correct me if I'm wrong it's only 3rd person
---
red dead 2: i've honestly been very impressed with rockstars games lately all controversy aside
---
I wasn't bad mouthing any game. I'm defending FO76 as being ridiculed over things that should be taking with a grain of salt because their game engine is actually amazing. The fact that a couple think that they can fix the game means nothing dude, because they are fixing it for their computers.
---
If you hadn't noticed very few mods can be used be all players on comp.
---
however instead of people updating their game to in ways that are unnecessary bethesda has always givin us the tools to customize our own experience as we see fit. we can no long do this to the same degree because it now may have consequences for others.
---
a long time ago I volunteered to be part of a skyrim test server. I am not going to bad mouth them but I am disappointed they didn't speak up at how difficult it was for them on just closed servers. I was not kidding when I said I was under the impression this was impossible. I also understand they may be salty, but only now they are getting skyrim together out... gl n hf. I know the truth and I am sticking with bethesda.
---
until you can actually view your addictions, it isn't. The effect was powerful in fallout 4 because you could tell how many chems you were addicted to and addictions stacked. Without knowing what you're addicted to, you'd have to just take chems constantly and fly blind. 
---
But when this is fixed, it could be one of the more powerful builds in the game. 
---
I finally got lucky and got a TS and an explosive weapon.  TS is a Missile launcher (weak!), and my explosive is a Flamer (odd, but was excited)....sure it does damage, but one-shot anything above lvl 5...not likely... *went through 10 shots to make Mr. Gutsy start to spin.*  My best wepons remain my 3 star super sledges...one for super mutants and the other for animals.  With luck i can one-shot up to lvl 65. many times, it takes 6 or so shots.  very frustrated about this downgrade...there's got to be a weapon in this game that can do real damage.  Do i need a TSE Fatman? :\\
---
Well before the nuke is dropped the enemies are a lower level and drop normal loot, dropping the nuke makes the enemies tougher and more legendary items stop, this is how most people get tse's
---
Clearly you aren‚Äôt paying attention then, because adrenaline is an agility perk, not a perception perk.
---
Just break down Mole Miner Gauntlets. It will eventually give you the mod plans and it requires Makeshift Warrior perk 4 in order to craft the mod. You can find plenty of Mole Miners in the Ash Heap or during Uranium Fever.
---
Thanks, was being tongue in cheek but good to know!
---
Unfortunately, the draw back is implied.  If you are doing reactive damage when you get hit, it's gonna hit everything.  You win some you lose some I guess.
---
Oh cool!! Add more crap to the game Bethesda can‚Äôt figure out how to fix.
---
Is this actually bugged I did this week one and it took forever though like 3 hours
---
I had someone desperately try to PvP me at whitesprings the other day... weird thing is he offered to trade first and requested every single chem, stimpak, and rad aid that I had. To which i laughed.. if you are a lvl 60 and have problems finding aid items in the game. Your doing it wrong. 
---
After he wasted a bunch of ammo, he used a gauntlet. I have pacifist enabled, so I literally stood next to cars until he finally missed me and blew up three cars at once, died, and also turned the whitesprings robots against him. 
---
I waved while he ran away and I stood next to an assultron shooting at him.
---
FYI, I took his junk when he died for the mild inconvenience he caused.
---
rumors and speculations based on basically nothing, clickbait scammers at it again to chase those adsense pennies.
---
I do my raider-ing at workshops. At least I can steal some resources there. 
---
I got one too, yesterday. Should've snapped a pic. 
---
Yes, this, PLEASE. I'm a settlement aficionado and I'd love to be able to put together something cool with other people. :D
---
I‚Äôve just about perfected my brick house on the river south of Lake Eloise. 
---
There isn‚Äôt a whole lot of end-game content, but there *are* a lot of really cool locations and biomes I‚Äôm interested in trying to build in. 
---
I just don‚Äôt want to lose all the time I spent setting up my house if I don‚Äôt like the new locale or decide I‚Äôd like to move back. 
---
The game is obviously capable of storing your current camp configuration. It would be great if, in lieu of or in addition to the little blueprints you can make that have a limited budget, you could save X number of fully fledged CAMPs. 
---
You‚Äôd have to pay to place a saved CAMP (i.e., move your CAMP) as normal, but if you‚Äôre in the boundary of a saved CAMP slot, you place the whole thing as happens when you load into a server. 
---
To accomplish this, I‚Äôd like a phantom build mode to be added. This has the benefit of solving a current issue. Currently, to build the perfect CAMP, you often wind up paying to move it several times because you have to get that green circle just right. You can‚Äôt always see the boundary from the middle if there is some elevation. 
---
In the phantom build mode I suggest, you place your CAMP as normal and build as normal, but you don‚Äôt pay to move the CAMP or for any materials until the end (you cannot build a phantom object unless you have the resources to pay for it, however). 
---
Floors and walls and such are walkable, but objects such as benches are unusable until paid for. 
---
This way, you can build a new CAMP and take the time to flesh it out while still having access to a CAMP you already have built. Sometimes builds take a couple hours, and you don‚Äôt always want to spend that time all at once. 
---
The ‚Äústored‚Äù tab could be reworked to have its own budget so that you could move items from CAMP to CAMP. 
---
Each CAMP slot would have to have its own budget and be completely independent item-wise from each other CAMP slot. 
---
So if you want a rad shower at another CAMP, you‚Äôll have to either grind for mats for it or take the time to store it before you move your CAMP. 
---
CAMP slots could be expensive or there could be a quest to acquire them. This could provide another late-game resource sink. 
---
Okay
---
They can definitely take the fun out of the game, I totally get what you mean about it eliminates all the challenge BUT I play solo and keep ONE on me just in case I get in a bind, The challenge with tse weapons is learning how to shoot it without blowing yourself up!! Also when I die from blowing myself up I ALWAYS lose all my junk......
---
Ah I didn't know that, thanks!
---
The furious and bloodied caps are +50% damage right? I've only really tested bloodied
---
If you have to restart then that's you restarting it. That's not you continuing on with the game after you're done, that's just you doing a new playthrough. Once you finish New vegas, Main and side quests all, there's nothing to do. Ditto for Skyrim, Fallout 3, fallout 4, Oblivion, etc. 
---
You should be a writer.....you spin a good yarn!
---
I finish the quest too and that was the next day of the Christmas noobs
---
I‚Äôve played 300 hours and I‚Äôve not come across a single TSE. I would still like one.
---
Death by SNU-snu!
---
Two shots miss a lot and make Vats almost unusable, its not uncommon to miss 5 95% chance shots in a row.  With damage nerfed down 75% it will not be worth it to have the prefix anymore.
---
I think I have like 28-30 tech datas chilling in my inventory
---
Ok but what about the 5x LVL 30's that join the event?
---
That‚Äôs what I figured, but just wanted to make sure! Thanks for the info 
---
Love that idea 
---
What makes the green grass grow?
---
Wendigo like to drop like 4 stimpacks and other goodies. 
---
Discord's LFG is full of people doing nukes.
---
RPG at its finest
---
no that that's hurd mentality. these things are not actually OP they've destroyed the ingame economy.
---
I mostly use stock items and I don't have problems pvp, pve..
---
The Hazmat suit shouldn't be considered armor for the chameleon mutation.
---
u/urmom get epic rekt
---
Idk. I've got a bud that plays pc. He is in the upper 100s. Says no matter where he moves his base, he keeps getting attacked by people with duplicated tses and decided to quit the game. He's lived in the mountains away from everything, in the savage divide between Grafton and the waterpark, and also near whitesprings but not at whitesprings, on the other side of the train station.
---
Yeah they are it's there conference room so why not smoke in it?
---
I think it's a bad idea, where prime is now you have a level playing field, out in the open. Other fissure sites in the game are hidden in trees, next to or above cliffs which would make it difficult to fight the queen.
---
I agree to different or more end game bosses but leave the queen fight at Prime, it's already difficult enough there. 
---
Same here for me
---
&gt; who don't want to PvP at all
---
Maybe don't buy a game with PvP as a core component?
---
Level 27?  You were the reason the event failed.  
---
Its just a daily quest.  (Without the daily marker)
---
Not the guy you asked, but I've heard Furious is maxed out at 30% extra damage.
---
Uranium fever has up and got me down
---
Yeah, this weekend was interesting to say the least.
---
They haven't nerfed TSE yet that's coming in a future patch
---
Yes inventory management needs some QoL
---
I would like they add an armor stash and a weapon stash that could hold 20 item either armors or weapons accordingly with no weight limit(could call them armor/weapon racks whatever :) )
---
Would allow to store some gear to have different builds to play with.
---
But that you could still use normal stash like it is.
---
Anyway not against more stash weight
---
Yeah that's a terrible mechanic!
---
I've lost a beautiful deathclaw gauntlet and a LMG that way :(
---
Skyrim had more to do than any fallout game without mods, all the fallouts had replay value with other factions and quests  outcomes. Fallout 76 has none. Once you beat it you play the same game with slightly different perks, in prior games you were locked into a build in this one you are not.
---
Lol nvm the guy deleted it my bad
---
Later in the game you see enemies scorched like ghouls mirelurks etc.
---
"Wanders through whitespring;  "Plans....plans never change...'"
---
Some vendors *do* address you differently while wearing certain clothes (Phoenix says "Ad Victoriam, Soldier" if you're wearing any of the BOS uniforms, Enclave bots say "General" if you're wearing the Officer uniform, Responders won't tell you to join the Responders if you're wearing any of the Responder uniforms etc)
---
Furious is 30%, bloodied/beserker is 60% AFAIK. A friend of mine was doing some theory crafting earlier today, and he was saying that the difference between a TSE build and a bloodier/beserker build currently is 5%. I'm not sure how VATs-crit+stealth stacks up, but a friend of mine runs it and it's comparably powerful. Both the bloodied/beserker and crit+stealth build can be very resource hungry at top end output though.
---
When the screen is black, can you still see the map or your own pip boy?
---
If the blueprints are in stored then yes it will affect budget.  
---
Get yourself fireproof at max rank and a good melee weapon. Also if you have marsupial and bird bones that helps with jumping to avoid aoe explosive damage. Youll be able to eat at least one shot and close the distance to where you totally negate their advantage and then tap L1 and vats the scummy little tse prick into obvllivion üëç
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Same on PS4.  I have now lost two of my most favorite weapons I had.
---
Not exactly covering yourself in glory there bub. Probably best to shut up, slink away and hope nobody even noticed you were ever here.
---
I'm wearing my prototype hazmat suit underneath my excavator armor, although it doesn't work in the PA, it's nice that's it's equipped when I exit the suit. 
---
I also heard that sometimea the vendor has Responder Fireman Helmet sometimes.
---
I would like to see two systems as well then.  I like the roleplaying aspect in this game, but I do see your pain here.  Esp if something goes wrong on the main character that you play, I had that happen with my No Man's Sky account, 200 hours in and can't play it anymore.  
---
Looking at the situation from a Gamer perspective and a Roleplaying perspective, it does seem like both need to be in the game.  You either alienate your core group of Gamers, and keep the Roleplayers, or vice versa.  It does need an overhaul
---
Usually get this plan about 2 or 3 times in uranium fever event. But you can likely get it from any large group of moleminers
---
You must have the "Power Smith" perk card equipped to craft most PA parts.
---
There is also a minimum level requirement, but if you have the Power Smith Card, then that has been met.
---
The reason for players showing up as level 0, is because they ignored you before attacking. Ignoring you is almost the same as blocking you, but you can't see them on the map. I have had this done to me 3 times while owning workshops, so I wouldn't see them coming. 
---
A friend of mine checked for me, the players attacking were in reality level 100+, not level 0. 
---
If you go into the social menu, and go to the "recent" tab, you will see a list of people on the server. If any of them have an (ignored) tab next to them, and you know you didn't block them, they are coming for you. 
---
Sometimes if i repeatedly try to open pip boy or map, i manage to get the game back for a minute or two.
---
I don‚Äôt have turrets 
---
Hell yeah you can!! I got a bloodied 3 star and an instigatin 2 star yesterday
---
yo i waited to join the community far to late because i didn't want to spoil the game for myself. do you really think these things aren't beatable. I promise you more and more will come, this game is full of people with unique tactics not just people flock to a popular playstyle (popularized by cheaters by the way, so why would believe them?)
---
May not have helped you and what happened, but there is a line you can add to your custom.ini file that allows your game to auto save at a shorter intervals, if I remember right I think the default is around 10 minutes, I set mine down to between 2 and 4. Which really can help out, especially in overpopulated nuke zones when the DC rates can really suck. 
---
You joke but ISIS is primarily an ideology and those things can‚Äôt be killed by bombs, let alone modern nukes which would probably only cause nearby nuclear armed nations to retaliate in kind. 
---
One thing that always annoyed me about fallout games is that it uses the outdated nuclear technology, the fallout vaults of fallout are just to close to the surface to offer any protection against a nuclear apocalypse. 
---
I get scared googling things that I have no clue what they mean. T'internets a scary place and safesearch isn't enough bubble wrap for me. 
---
Mine keeps putting in my inventory every time I put it on or fast travel and it's not just the helmet it might be the torso or a arm or leg too so be careful when you are fast traveling or putting it on for sure
---
I've met GRAHM loads of times, but the Mothman only once...I took a pot shot and he hazed into oblivion, and the Flatwoods monster twice. My Camp is just outside Flatwoods....again I took just 1 shot at each sighting, but he vanished in a swirl of energy and disappeared. Has anyone ever killed the Flatwoods monster?!
---
Sounds good, you can add me @King_DrStew I should be on later this evening. 
---
Just tested it now, it works here. no dc and it get saved fine here.
---
I am also on PC.
---
ok and how much stable violet flux and ultracite is need to produce that that many rounds?
---
correct me if my calculation is wrong:
---
100 .50 cal round = 1 violet flux and 1 ultracite
---
30000 rounds = 30 violet stable flux and 30 ultracite.
---
Do you know how long it takes to create 30 stable violet flux? You will have to multiply it by 10 which results in 300 raw violet flux and hardened mass and highly radioactive stuff. 
---
And for what? I spend 3000 rounds easily on the queen. Even with the dmg modifier of ultracite. Its just not worth the effort imho. 
---
But maybe we have just different opinons on that.
---
I felt this was an issue until I got rid of scrap I didn't need, I use heavy guns why do I have 1000 leather in my stash? Why so much cloth? Just sell it all that is not for your armor and weapons and you will have tons of storage, also ultracite weighs a lot but not really hard to get so get rid of it.
---
I was worried for a second that you were going to make the Marines look bad :P good story.
---
I prefer Grognak and the Ruby Ruins
---
Doesn't always work, but if you drop a second item close by the bag often pops up with both items in it.  You should always drop a unneeded item to a bag and then transfer the rest to the be bag though.
---
Bought mine for ¬£9 and I still think I overpaid.
---
16 years going so healthy enough. We do have our moments, but mostly a solid relationship.  
---
I'm also willing to buy the plans off anyone if they have an extra laying around!
---
They will still be the best range weapons in the game. They just won't be OP anymore
---
Yes, but DO YOU SEE map and pop boy?
---
You shouldn't be there and thankfully you don't get any xp if she survives no. A level 27 can absolutely not be beneficial to that fight.
---
You obviously don't know what you are talking about.
---
&gt;I mostly use stock items and I don't have problems pvp, pve..
---
So yes, it actually explain why you don't know what are saying. If Bethesda developpers tested the game in the same way you are playing, it would explain why F76 is unbalanced and boring once you completed the main quest.
---
Agreed. The fact that the end game boss fight, tends to drop nothing for most, means that a fix is needed ASAP. I'd prefer to see the community in an uproar about new content/bug fixes, than having everyone silent, and leaving the game behind.
---
Sometimes
---
1) Don't fall for the Lead Belly perk.
---
Get Good Doggy.
---
Makes canned dog foor replenish a lot of hunger and HP. You want to cook your food, you'll get rid of the rads and it'll fill your hunger meter more. Don't be afraid to check out every house. Almost every convenience story or a house will have some kind of a food item in it. Canned dog food, fancy lady snacks, dandy boy apples, instamash. There's a lot of it to go around. Almost every food will have like 1-3 rads to it tho. Don't pop combat drugs/radx. They increase thirst. Save them for tough fights or carry a lot of water.
---
2) Whenever your hunger or thirst go into red so does your stamina (action points). Eat and drink.
---
3) You drop your stuff from the Junk category. Just the stuff that's on you. Store excess junk in your stash. It'll be safe there. You can go back and pick up your dropped junk.
---
Wwaaaaaaay too easy, and I'm not talking TSE weapons or something. Even before finding my explosive shotgun, I was rocking a stealth/sniper/VATS build with a Lever Action Rifle, and it was still too easy.   
---
99% of the enemies died with a single shot to the head, from extreme distances.
---
Of course, with my Explosive Shotgun I can now destroy HORDES of enemies with a single left click, but even without thatm the game is missing a serious challenge.
---
The other day I tried to show a friend the game a bit, and there was literally no place I could go to show them a good fight. Even the SBQ drops in half a minute nowadays...
---
Yeah but they keep complaining about the occasional griefer like it happens all the time anyway lol
---
This is probably true.  We could get rid of most of the house, and never miss it.  I just hate when she sees/watches something and goes over to the deep end immediately.
---
Then you threw my thoughts down the drain. If you not any party members initiated pvp with them then they shouldn‚Äôt have been able to kill you unless glitching. 
---
you get 2 of each flux as a quest reward from the queen, and the recipe makes 180 rounds, and you have to factor in Super Duper too. I play with random people on the reddit discord and people are always giving away or seling violet flux for nothing, like I said, its the steel thats the main thing I have to farm.
---
Took forever to complete that quest for my girlfriend. üò§
---
Damn it! Know how long that took me to get, now i gotta take it off?! 
---
In previous fallouts, choices had consequences, so it was necessary to restart in order to see what would have transpired if you made different choices. That style of play is not possible in this version of fallout. 
---
Outside of that, no there's nothing to do other than restart or play with new builds. I wouldn't advise people play with new builds on the same character. With how many bugs there are to fix and how they're currently rebalancing, it could be wasted points. I've had to re-spec twice after certain perks were fixed, and I don't want to bother until it feels like perks and damage stacks are stable.
---
The lvl of the queen is based on how many people show up. So by being only lvl 27 you helped make her stronger without being able to actually help kill her
---
There‚Äôs 3 gingers in one of the whitesprings houses
---
I just want Sixteen Tons to play more often.
---
2 hours of gameplay last night with the radio always on and I didn't get it once.
---
Ah nice to know, bloodied it is then!
---
Why are people so hell bent on getting this jetpack mod ? serious question.
---
I'm the same. 
---
1 or 2 annoying bugs now and then, nothing a quick restart doesn't fix. 1 or 2 crashes now and then, nothing I haven't experienced with other games I've played (100+ hours - single figure crashes). Been killed by another player a few times, before I learned about pacifist mode. Having great fun whilst playing. Don't feel the urge to play anything else right now although I am hitting endgame now so I might slow down until DLC drops. Then again, if I'm still having the same fun as I'm having now, I might not
---
Have you had a pet/animal you befriended that died in your CAMP?
---
This has been a requested feature since they first implemented the ‚Äústash upgrades ‚Äú so I don‚Äôt think you will be met with any backlash. It‚Äôs easier to just assume, anything that would actually make sense,is something the devs haven‚Äôt even considered since they nave no understanding of online games, good post ü§ô
---
You are right and I stand corrected. 
---
So no I havent tried it. It could be an option but will it suffice to compensate the missing dmg of TS and E? Especially since you really have to keep it up and going to have a constant dmg modifier
---
same here...had been working on a horde of ghouls a couple of which were 3 star...blue screen...crap, but then i just told myself its probably shit loot anyway.  I mean, 90% of the junk 3 stars drop would be great for lower levels, but damn, i've played since launch heavily, and the best shit i got is still super-sledge. got a explosive flamer...its crap.  I want a TSE just so i can feel some power for once.  I there any weapon out there that can deal 500+ damage/shot besides the Fatman? 
---
I like turtles
---
Then it may not be shadow details but some artifacts or other memory leaks from fallout 76
---
Did you check if your graphics card is compatible with the minimum requirements of fallout 76? Update drivers 
---
If not, try fallout 76 nexus - with with a few mods that increase FPS and remove fog, grass and tree movement 
---
Try Camden park vendor. Sells then more frequently than most other vendors
---
&gt;Current stash limit is breaking whole gameplay mechanic of looting
---
No it isn't. 
---
I do have a beserker's gatling gun with faster fire rate+reload I'm going to try out after patch. Could be a nice build to go with. Probably stay low life to get that adrenal reaction build up as well. 
---
No haven‚Äôt tamed an animal yet besides the Brahman from the fertilizer but he hasn‚Äôt died yet.
---
The vendor is where you get all the sweet X-1 Power Armor Mods
---
Can you seriously affect server autosave client side ? wow.
---
Are you serious? He‚Äôs fucking kidding around roleplaying an old guy. Ain‚Äôt no 70+ year old on Reddit puking in his own lap while he plays Fallout bro. Calm the fuck down. 
---
Literally built the base logged out at 75% and the next day it‚Äôs full
---
Johnny was MY FRIEND man!
---
They have to dedicate a server to the towns. When you cross the "city limits" to enter or exist from your server your on it moves you to the "town" server your on. They could put a wall and generic town view of the area on servers to fill the space the town server occupies.
---
Are you checking your stats while wearing your power armour?
---
Bought my homie a pump shotgun for 500 caps last night,two shot, explosive, 90% reduced weight. Even being nerfed that‚Äôs a damn good legendary shotgun. And until the nerf they‚Äôre still viable for a week or two 
---
Found one other place- there's a pier along the west side of the map on the river, it's called "Wild River Adventures" or something. There's a bunch of life preservers there which have springs and some fishing rods too. Not as much yield as sugar springs, but you'll probably get at least a dozen springs out of it. 
---
What we really need is a clipboard or toaster factory :-)
---
Ha ha ha. We had a friend start playing recently, and when he mentioned how much stuff he had, we all went into You don't know how good you have it! It was hell when the limit was 400!
---
I think between 800-1000 would work. 
---
Might be your windows power settings, even if you're on desktop. Double check that you have them set to never turn off your monitor or go to sleep while on AC power. 
---
I have no idea how to do so and won‚Äôt have time to figure it out for at least 5ish days. 
---
Sunday nights (Central US time) are my only guaranteed ‚Äúme‚Äù time. 
---
I had sneak but is vats really that efffective? I admit having it used only to hit quickly moving targets. Rarely getting the crit modifier full enough to execute. 
---
Perhaps your duped full set of sentinel armor needs a nerf then
---
I bet you also want people to stop complaining about bugs, too. But this is pretty much the only way things around here will change. By talking about it and creating buzz. If it were wholly up to Bethesda, they'd most likely leave us with a broken-ass game that's just as empty as it now, I guarantee it
---
Grafton 
---
I could give you some starting supplies if you want. My in-game name is the same as the one here.
---
I didn't realise these were so uncommon! My first base was at White Springs so they'd always spawn by my camp. This was when I was low level and all I wanted was a green lawn around my camp...... before I realised the ghouls were all 6 times my level and White Springs was a nuke hot spot. Had a come to jesus moment one time where the "death from above" quest appeared on my screen. Looked at my map to see where the bomb was being dropped to see that there was a little camp icon in it. So I laughed and told my friends "This dude is about to have his base screwed!........ Wait...... that's my base....."
---
Lack of coherence/10
---
Undoubtedly the best CAMP decor suggestion I read so far.
---
Yes you can only turn in one at a time
---
Oh.....by the way, I'm level 137
---
Can existing characters join this game mode or will a new character have to be created ? 
---
Bethesda said end of month, so next week. PC will most likely get it sooner
---
It is still broken.
---
Ima try the possible fixes 
---
I am just as puzzled as you are at how they did it. 
---
But to pull it off they needed three people in a team - that‚Äôs all I can be sure of 
---
Yes.    
---
Somewhat.    
---
A 1050 Ti can manage 1080/60 just fine with medium settings, but I'm not sure if the Q6600/4GB will be a problem - its pretty old and I'd say 8GB is almost a must.
---
Well Clint Eastwood has to be at least 73 if not a lot older so he could in fact be Clint Eastwood. 
---
i dunno...theirs is often more of boogie boarding than surfing....ijs
---
honestly, speaking fro myself...nuking alpha prime just isnt worth it anymore. I get that you want to complete the mission though.
---
I caught a vengeful mothman 2 days ago in the north western corner of the map.  
---
About how far away can you be on this and still get the xp ?
---
Your SPECIAL won't ever change. Look in the first tab of the pipboy (stats) and scroll all the way to the right. It'll show you ups and downs, based on what's going on with you. For example, if you've been infected with The Blight, all of your stats will be down. If you're wearing improved underwear, a lot of them will be up. Those change all the time. But your SPECIAL never will.
---
Yes, but those aren't plants, so you pick them up, rather than harvest them. 
---
The AVR medical center in Charleston has a bunch of plastic too - cafeteria trays in the dining room on the main floor, and IV bags and such scattered about elsewhere. Probably at least 30 per visit.
---
Nice.
---
Oh, no, I fucked up and bought it. What I am saying now is based strongly on that experience.
---
Good luck, I know how frustrating your problem is 
---
Grafton vendor 
---
I think what we're getting to here is- context sensitive buttons can and should be a thing. 
---
There is an issue mentioned in another post that greifers in assassin/sentinel armor would really fuck with people in nukezones.
---
check, check and check....my issues too.
---
Not to sound harsh, but at your level you are more of a hindrance than a help. Leave the SBQ alone for about 20 more levels. 
---
Nice items but trying to find the specific items I describes, at least until I give up. Thanks for the interest.
---
So that's the problem here. You are butthurt about a videogame! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Would also be nice if the nuka suit didn't unequip headgear.
---
Wouldn't be so bad if it's fucking sealed helmet did anything useful.
---
I‚Äôm sold on any game that has this loot system. Triple please. 
---
Grafton.  Responder Bot Greg.  Not the train station bot.  Server hop a bit and he should have them
---
Found a Legendary Glowing Behemoth on the outskirts of WS fighting the guard bots once after a nuke. DC'd like a minute before my friends and I killed it.
---
Guys, I think this is a /s post :P
---
I can't believe I saw this plan and didn't buy it to sell because I already had it. I think I saw it at Camden? And maybe got it from Patrol Duty originally? I need to pay more attention to decrease the question mark frequency in my posts.
---
The only way there was a lvl 20 east of the savage divide was a lvl 20 spawned them but didnt kill them.
---
The mobs scale to the lvl of whoever spawned them.
---
The only other thing I can think was it was part of horde event that was started by a lower lvl.
---
40$?
---
That‚Äôs a steal!
---
If you own it, boot it up and see for yourself. The community seems split with people getting bugs and crashes all the time and people who don't (I'm in the latter). It seems to be getting better and better for me but again, it seems to be getting worse for others
---
you are probably using ammosmith as well. I didnt meet ppl giving away flux for free yet but I see your point. Still running out of ammo in such a fight is not a pleasant thing to think about. But maybe thats just me loving to have enough ammo 
---
I don‚Äôt get crashes like that at all on xbx1 with multi hour sessions.  Might get a crash once or twice in a day, they only happen more often with nuked zones but that‚Äôs easy to address being on a team and respawn mobs on restart anyway.
---
Or it could be the bodies of the people that refused to leave when the robots locked down Whitespring for the renovations.
---
I‚Äôve also seen him at Grafton and Charleston Landfill. 
---
1000 rolls, 1 TSE - a crossbow. Didn‚Äôt know those can be legendary. 
---
You can paint it the wrong color though (blue or yellow) and he will get mad
---
Idea this really like I 
---
People are trying to get things and you're destroying their progress for no reason. Why do you think they build things around the workshop? To keep assholes like you out.
---
Try grafton station 
---
I'll add you today, and I'll be on later today as well!
---
I want the Molerat Queen concept art they had for FO4 to be a boss.
---
Have her summoning shitloads of molerats with Miner guards that worship her like a god.
---
I have thought about the same thing since my first day playing. It would be cool to build a permanent base but also have a mobile turret tower/workshop.
---
Iguana bits _could be_ but iguana on a stick was originally a whole dang iguana skewered on a stick and roasted as depicted by the graphic of the in-game item in F1-Tactics. 
---
Welsh have it too 
---
I agree with you about RP should be paranoid because we don't respawn in real life but a lot of players disagree. They say "*This game doesn't make sense. Why would we spend 20 years together in a vault then try to kill each other when we get out?*", implying we would all work together and it wouldn't be dangerous from another human perspective.
---
I always suggest going days without food and seeing how desperate they get.
---
Makes zero difference. Like I said PTSD and what he makes fun of in his post is clearly PTSD
---
Having never used that suit I didn't know it had no useful Helmet.  Yea that bites!
---
That makes a lot of sense. It's shitty behaviour for sure as it was literally the second I fast travelled away after setting up the ammo factory and surrounding resources, probably lost about 80 caps plus what ever scrap. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I really idea this like
---
&gt; Skyrim had more to do than any fallout game without mods
---
Yeah, Radiant quests. Specifically the same radiant quest over and over and over and over again. Remove those rose tinted glasses, kiddo. 
---
&gt; all the fallouts had replay value with other factions and quests outcomes.
---
Once you finish all of that shit, what is there to do? Once you've done literally every single goddamn thing on Fallout new vegas, or Fallout 4, or what have you, what is there to do? Because i can't find jack shit to do. "OH BUT YOU CAN DO THE SAME STORY BUT AS A DIFFERENT FACTION!" Okay? And? I just did the story as one faction, and i can just load up a save literally before the point of no return. Once i've done that there's nothing to do. 
---
&gt;Fallout 76 has none. 
---
K. But there's still stuff to do. 
---
&gt;Once you beat it you play the same game with slightly different perks
---
Once you beat the other games you just load up a save slightly before the point of no return and do that. Wowee, how fun. 
---
&gt;in prior games you were locked into a build in this one you are not.
---
Who gives a shit? You're pretty much locked into a build anyway since you can't set your special to 15 for every attribute, whereas with 4 you could literally get every single perk. 
---
I play on PC and have only had 2 crashes in the past 2 weeks. It seems very spontaneous. Some people run great, others constantly have crashes. Best advice is to give it a shot and see if yours is stable
---
My point is Bethesda in their desire to maximize profits is minimizing content.  That being said it is more cost effective to have PVP be more prevelant.  Since PVP doesnt seem to be on a strong footing, camp destruction could possibly make the owner lash out and respond to the destruction.  
---
I've had my camp shot up a  couple times both times people just shot things up soon as I get there they log off.  One was level 45, and the other 51.  I'm a bit over 100 packing enough gear to defend myself and what belongs to me.  The griefers didn't really want a fight.  My camp at the time was a simple basic camp I think they had the idea I was a gairly low level and they could feel a little better about themselves pushing around someone they had a clear edge on.
---
They can say what they want, the game allows it, the rest a perk card so bethesda wants it, it just PVP and I'm roleplaying a raider.  Fine whatever but most who do this stuff dont wanna stick around and fight unless they have a clear edge..  aka a griefer.
---
I feel bethesda needs to put a smoke marker on serial camp attackers, camps.  I feel if their camp is destroyed and bounty bnb collected resources should come straight from their stash and awarded their victim.  I feel they should be marked to their victim so their victim can follow them to other servers to serve some justice.  You wanna be a raider and live the raider life style, dont be surprised when a stronger raider show up and shows you some love.  And moving your camp doesnt fix it...   
---
As it stands too many of them destroy camps and the only justice they pay is if somebody collects a bounty. 
---
I like you. 
---
PVP is who shoots who first work their duped TSE weapon. 
---
I Idea Like This Really
---
I've had 3 or 4 drop from the ghouls at Whitespring golf club house...mods for it I've found mainly at harpers ferry ..server hop to shake the inventory up ..good luck..
---
Or what he makes fun of is typical old person behavior. Jesus Christ go watch some stand up comedy. They‚Äôll joke about way worse shit than this. Nobody is saying they have ill will against anyone with PTSD, he‚Äôs just role playing a funny fucking character which is completely fine. Get out of here with this weak ass shit please. 
---
Enemy levels scale based on the highest level player in the area, with min/max limits based on the area. Try going in without your friend. You should have a much easier time. Think I cleared the wendigo the around level 20.
---
Grafton - either vendor
---
I've seen the levels numbers squashed before on 100+ but this was definitely a flat unsquished zero. As another user pointed out I saw a zero because they had set me to ignore which means I couldn't see them on the map. They essentially ghosted me, waited for me to set up a workshop and then took it. I've no problem with them taking it, but it's a pretty underhanded way to go about it.
---
Platform?
---
üòò
---
Cap'n does indeed have a clean fireman's helmet.
---
A friend lives by there just told me this....and I spent a week hopping at Grafton lol
---
I‚Äôd like that. I‚Äôve come across plenty of folks doing the same event. Why not team up? Even if it‚Äôs just for the remainder of that event. 
---
Huh? 
---
i disagree entirely, especially with the idea that there is 0 reward. the concept that u need to receive an in game item for something to be worth doing is absurd.  "Let the process be the payoff".  Whats the point of climbing to the top of seneca rocks if all there is there is a good view?
---
I nearly had this the other day.
---
Some massively high leveled guy came to investigate but then dropped me some stimpaks and saved me from a very high leveled Yao Guai before disappearing after he realised I was only staying in one place for a long time to read some terminals.
---
Would be nice if us mic-less people had a text chat so we could thank people better than a thumbs up.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
I just collect it from robots, cans and pencils
---
Yes, lots of tweaks are possible for the game via the custom.ini file, though you have to create it yourself if I remember correctly. Also it is loaded last and any settings that you put in it will override both the regular game and the preferences.ini files.. I've been using it since the game came out by necessity due to having an ultrawide 3440 monitor (they now have support for UW's, but not 3440 resolution unless they've changed it recently) 
---
Lol like I care 
---
I see one person on sunday asking for group and no replies.. am I in the right discord?
---
Aaah so this is the reason why i didn't notice difference from the normal one
---
sounds boring to me tbh
---
My addiction rejoices while my sleep schedule curses you.
---
But i thank you for answering. üëç
---
How about going through the entire silo and after expending tons of ammo, two or three weapons each for three people, and nearly 80 stimpaks, you finally get to push the button... then server crash.
---
Yes, they are. I'll claim them simply for the xp &amp; rewards, then complete the initial defend since it comes quickly. After that, I don't care to farm or even keep it. I just find the next unowned workshop. Repeat as able. 
---
If the initial claim or defend involves scorchbeasts, gulpers, or any other bullet sponges, I abandon it since it's not worth the time or bullets. Plenty of workshops that won't give you hassles.
---
I don't come across much pvp on PS4, probably cuz that's not worth the time, either.
---
Reply to the nuke comparison. If you can tell me why you‚Äôre mad about a PTSD character being ROLEPLAYED but you aren‚Äôt upset about playing a game that drops nukes on a regular basis then I‚Äôll listen to your bullshit. Otherwise bye. 
---
&gt;In previous fallouts, choices had consequences, so it was necessary to restart in order to see what would have transpired if you made different choices. That style of play is not possible in this version of fallout.
---
Again, A new playthrough =/= you doing stuff in the game after you beat it. It is just that, a new playthrough. Once you've done all of that shit, what is there to do? Nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing. Except radiant quests in the case of 4.
---
&gt;Outside of that, no there's nothing to do other than restart or play with new builds.
---
Exactly my point. Once you've beaten everything, gotten every single ending, etc, there is literally nothing for you to do. That is the point that i was trying to make. Simply starting a new playthrough doesn't...It's not the same thing. Starting a new playthrough because you didn't do it with another faction means that you still have shit to do. Once you're done with that, there's literally nothing for you to do. 
---
Thanks! So they exist but we've never seen anyone get them in game. Maybe they are either bugged or waiting to drop them in at a later date.
---
How do you deal with three or four of them when you literally can't see anything but blue flashes?
---
The one i'm in is Fallout Reddit Network
---
I am in the CET timezone, if you are not too far off I can gladly help you out a bit with basics, ammunition or camp items. If you get a request from someone with a name related to my reddit name, accept it :-)
---
It was mildly annoying that a thing I spent my hard earned Atoms on would either put me at a disadvantage or not be used.
---
Just like when I got one of the power armour skins but then acquired the Excavator suit.
---
I just dropped all of mine into a container outside vault 76, but that's a good idea you have. I will hit you up when I have more to get rid of.
---
Thanks for posting this same problem same solution.
---
These action are tied anyway, no matter to what key
---
Same here  PC
---
You're underestimaring the fact that people who are jerks now, will still be ***"raiders"*** jerks later.
---
I found one at Whitespring, those accommodations surrounding the main hotel; I think there is only one that has two stories, out on the balcony, on the table. If you turn 180 after arriving at the Whitespring fast travel spawn point and run to the line of rooms, it should be fairly close.
---
You are using a TS that will be nerfed.  I  think you missed the point of the complaint threads.
---
Are you that stupid, that‚Äôs the point. PTSD shouldn‚Äôt be roleplayed or made fun of. 
---
I would like to see more bosses relating to different fissure sites. So prime would be the scrochbeast queen. The one far north could be a massive wendigo or deathclaw. Some of the fissures closer to the forest could spawn an ultimate mothman and the one close to whitespring could have the Grafton monster King
---
That‚Äôs your extremely oversensitive opinion. 
---
Do you use any mods? I have a suspicion that the perk Loadout mod causes some instability, but I'm not sure, and I really don't want to play without it.
---
1 at a time - which is fine if you are in no immediate need. These locations are netting between 30-80 lead for a few minutes work
---
2 hours a day is casual?
---
As my experience goes. I can hit around 450 in each resistance. And I am much more effective at playing with no PA. You are so focused on numbers and the easy fix, do you even test anything besides what people tell you and the duped TSE weapons?
---
You dont think, thats a huge flaw for a person.
---
Nukes should be joked about?
---
No Mods
---
coming soon "2000 ATOMS, you can craft a selfie-station"
---
as nice as this would be..... the current process seems to 'limit' the amount of OP weapons/armor floating around. Honestly, as is i get probably 20+ legendary pieces each time I do about an hour of farming. With the current system, maybe 1 of those is worth while and not just vendor fodder. If suddenly I'm getting 10 GOOD pieces approximately in an hour of farming, the game will get EVEN EASIER.... and literally everyone will just run around in god tier gear. 
---
Well if that is  the case the same could be said for Jacksonville chameleons to deathclaws. Almost all the deadly creatures in fallout come from something small harmless or cute 
---
 You wanna talk bullshit try shrimp to Fog crawler that seems way less likely  
---
So there is a cap? I haven‚Äôt tested in extreme detail but I currently don‚Äôt have bandolier and only 2 bear arms so I feel like I‚Äôm nowhere near the cap on either weapon or ammo weight reduction...
---
My dude just go to the dev room
---
I once saw a scorchbeast strafe Watoga for a good 15 minutes, and afterwards there were a dozen Protectrons with their legs crippled just pulling themselves through the streets by their arms.  It was oddly beautiful.
---
Doh!
---
honestly I would still wait. Bethesda is applying a lot of nerfs but the game is still unstable. In my case it crashes at least twice per session. As soon as a nuke was thrown the lag starts. Which is probably due to endless bobblehead stacking / glitch users which is still not fixed. They also fixed one duping glitch but left 2-3 others open which leads to us getting disconnects and loosing gear. 
---
so in short its still a buggy mess. My recommendation: Wait another 6 months and check again. 
---
So i can nuke it
---
Great idea!!!!
---
different reasons for different camp sites and different raiders.  there is not one uniform reason for raiding a players camp. 
---
1. Yup.
---
2. Not only are they too close to the surface, the doors open the wrong way -- the vault door comes *in* when it opens and so would be pushed open by a nearby nuke.
---
For me damage isn't the problem, it's that I can't see anything on my screen other than never ending blue flashes.
---
ok, so in the narrow sense, yes there's nothing to do and I recognized that. There are plenty of people that restart characters to explore content that was closed off behind factions they didn't side with, so it's not completely repeating the same content. Most games don't seem to have additional play value after completing everything, so it doesn't seem reasonable to expect that out of this game. It might be reasonable to expect there to be re-play value though
---
It should get the same physical restrictions as PA. Doing anything in MOPP gear other than being miserable is not authorized.
---
At this point I consider Rad Worms a player pet
---
There's a final holotape that will appear at the silos after you launch a nuke at a non fissure site. Took forever to figure out it was the final one for the quest
---
Trashcan Carla, take note.
---
Most everyone I meet is pretty chill. Had a guy unlock his door and let me into his very nicely built CAMP. Dropped a whole bunch of waters and food and waved as I headed back out into the wasteland. 
---
Then just the other night I was getting wrecked by mirelurk queen so I sent out an invite to whoever was on the map. A level 60 something showed up and we took that bitch down.
---
But then last night I had some lvl 70 in power armor following me around hitting me and jumping in front of enemies to try and draw my fire. Eventually I just hopped servers. And that's been my only real bad run in with other players.
---
I'm a pc player (US, est timezone), I'll send you a friend request and i'll try to help you out if you see me on.
---
Lucky hole mine so far has netted me more lead then i can use at this point in time. That was just 1 run through. Excavator PA and super duper when refining the ore. It's just plain stupid the amount of lead you get. 
---
Happened often. Lost like 4-5 weapons this way. -_- 
---
nope. 
---
This is not Fortnite. The map is more complex and stuff can‚Äôt just move around. Also there is a reason for it being there, it is at the end of the map so low level players can‚Äôt just go there easily. 
---
But if I saw a raider on the road I usually kill them on the spot. How do I know you're a raider BEFORE you destroy my shit? I mean, if we're gonna play this game, then let's play by the established tenets. You can't ever dress or act incognito and you need to attack EVERY player without question or reason.
---
Maybe the golf outfits are Nike...... ijs
---
What if it ran on fusion cores?
---
Xbone
---
Why wouldn't you wear Power Armor all the time, Bethesda knows you want to, Bethesda knows best ;)
---
I though that was what the game was going to be like at release. Naive of me, I know, but I am still dissapointed.
---
Definitely a bummer :/
---
Grahm i connected to watoga i believe.  
---
No f2p is cancer. Let me just make 50 account so i can troll people.
---
Fair enough
---
No, I'm not butthurt :) I was hoping the game had more value than it does and ¬£9 is still overcharging. Hundreds of media outlets agree with me that the game is rubbish.
---
You have to move a around, find some kind of protection.
---
I don't think the combat in this game is meant to be stand there and hit your attack buttons. There was just three of us. We only have excavator power armor, and only a couple parts modded. 
---
What we do is this. We take out all the scorched humans. One friend is more melee, I'm more grenade, the other is a mix between melee and ranged. 
---
The melee takes out most of the scorched humans, while I take the beast with my rifle. When it lands, we all rush in. The two friends melee her, while I switch to my gatling plasma.
---
That thing just chews through her hit points. Sometimes when the beast is about 5% she takes off again. We either kill her in air, or she lands again soon. But most of the time they die once they land. 
---
I will use a mixture of vats and just visually targeting the beast. I tend to switch to vats near the end, so I stay targeted on her, and I'm not out of AP. I also have Action Boy 3, which really restores your AP fast. 
---
It's not always perfect. But the real trick is you can't just stand there spamming your attacks. I've found that trying to do combat like that often isn't effective. Once you get a couple creatures on you, things change for the worse for you. 
---
Ok I‚Äôm not going to let you troll me. But maybe you should go and speak to someone with PTSD first and then tell me I‚Äôm over sensitive.
---
Awesome! That's what I was looking for :) Ad Victoriam!
---
Also be careful what you scrap/store because if you scrap a floor with stuff on it the stuff on it will still fill in the budget (its a bug), also when handling power lines and stuff that you power with them, first scrap the power line that is connected between two points because that also takes budget away :/
---
I believe the cap is 90% of any given item. Weight reduction on armor vs with perks function differently though. With armor, it applies to most items listed under the inventory tabs, so it includes fusion cores for ammo, or grenades for weapons, etc.
---
Should start when you go through the brotherhood‚Äôs camp venture in the southern part of the Mire. I think... it‚Äôs  been a while. 
---
best way to farm lead is to go to launch sites and get all the weights from the gyms, about 200-250 if you farm all 3, also every gym should have about 70-90 lead
---
sure. But the highest I got without PA was 200 180 170. Thats already with having some 3 star equipment. I even would prefer playing without PA but that kind of res you should even bother stepping into a nuke zone let alone fight the SBQ
---
Lucky Hole Mine has lots of lead ores. Go in with excavator armor and each ore will give you 4 ores each click. I walked out with 90+ each run.
---
What else are you gonna do exactly?
---
Put them in you stash and use them one by one or they'll merge into a single deposit
---
When I first started doing this I thought it simply meant ghouls in the whitespring golf area, because without even looking for them I got 9/10 and now that I'm aware, that last one won't spawn... ignorance truly is bliss lmao.
---
Yeah the rewards are either total shit or insanely rare drops. 
---
if you destroy a base and log off, you are still wanted when u log back in.  thats punishment...yes the wanted system is stupid and broken, but i think we all know its just temporary at this point
---
Not to my knowledge, no. 
---
username checks out
---
I'll check it out, thank you!
---
I started a new gm man /:
---
Just crafted mine on ps4 and both the leg armours bugged. Couldn't craft level t0 despite having plenty of materials. Left camp and put what I could in my stash... Put me craft one level 50 leg... Same thing happened crafting the other leg..
---
Smh @ this game.
---
&gt;"This game doesn't make sense. Why would we spend 20 years together in a vault then try to kill each other when we get out?", implying we would all work together and it wouldn't be dangerous from another human perspective.
---
Indeed, humans are unpredictable when removed from a safe environment. I guess they never read *Lord of the Flies*. 
---
I was using hyperbole to make the point that most people here are blindly following a game that has issues. You not drinking the koolaid is outside of the norm. I'm glad that you find yourself levelheaded and willing to admit both pros and cons with the game. I hope you continue to like the game enough to hang on and I hope everyone else enjoys polishing this turd.  
---
Get a 1060 minimum, 1050 is garbage.
---
Please read the post before commenting.
---
I've lost both weapons and an entire suit of armor this way.  I think it is a fast travel glitch where the game basically rebuilds your character and inventory at your spawn location (your character makes that grunting overburdened noise when everything finally arrives, because game), only something goes wrong with the server at a critical moment and part of your inventory fails to arrive.  Think of it like that scene in the original Star Trek movie where a transporter malfunctions.
---
Someone in FO76 roleplaying an old character with a faulty mind is NOT the same thing as someone actually having PTSD. People are smart enough to know the difference, whether you think they are or not. Whatever reasons you have for being hyper sensitive about anyone talking about PTSD are completely on you. This is a gaming community and people are going to goof off and have fun. If someone says some racist shit you might get some traction. Literally zero people besides you are going to have a problem with the joke made. 
---
"Why, Black Dynamite? Why?"
---
The best. Just hop around and claim some workshops with acid, like hemlock holes, and you're set.
---
Xbone 
---
If you have friends that play it, get it. But if you plan on going solo then that depends on you. 
---
I've got one for ya.
---
Ok that lends some credence to my hunch. My crashing issues didn't start until I installed a few mods and although checking the file integrity has helped, it's still risky for me to pop in and out of the perk screen too quickly. Looks like something I might have to bear until Bethesda implements proper perk management. Thanks for the quick reply! 
---
Somehow last night I had a power armor frame disappear from my inventory.  The pieces that were on it are still there though.  Not quite sure how that happened.
---
It spawns in Grafton Train Station as well at max level
---
Could just buy her a console? Even cheaper if picked up second hand. 
---
I like this idea, like the main camp, as you said, would be for more of a permanent home and the budget would be bigger than what we have currently. Then the second camp is the mobile-I just need to settle down for a sec to scrap, repair, craft, and sort inventory and it can even be less budget than what we have now
---
they are end game mobs that arent that entirely hard, even with the spam.  Get better gear and tactics, or just sprint/run away. If anything, they need to be harder. I dropped 2 last night in a matter of minutes while killing scorched and defending the Ground to Air event without breaking a sweat..... Not to be harsh, but nerfing everything so that everyone becomes a god does not make for a fun game with those of us who are already 'end game'.
---
\*yes the spam is annoying, if you cant see....VATS target them....hide behind something so they stop for a minute..kite them to an open fieldl so they land....or just blow them out of the sky by aiming at the center of the green rings coming towards your face
---
I haven't found that one yet. Is it a text based rpg? Where did you find it?
---
You should, though temper your expectations when it comes to story. Quests aren‚Äôt as involved or deep as in other fallouts. But after the latest patch, the game is a lot more stable and as a casual player at level 30 I haven‚Äôt encountered many glitches. If you‚Äôre a self starter and know how to make your own fun, you‚Äôll have a great time playing it.  
---
&gt; And why do the people I follow around act like they have no brain and no idea how to accomplish the most mundane of tasks, like walk somewhere without stopping and going idle for ridiculous strokes of time?
---
Are you grouped with these people or are you just like legit *following* them around. They may be trying to downplay you as if you were some weird person following them if it's the latter. 
---
It's basically just FO4 but a less complex story.
---
It would be a no nuke zone
---
Neat! I saw you were looking for Nuka Grape a little ago, I think I bought some a day ago. If I haven't used it yet, I'll trade you it plus some caps for those plans?
---
i bought them at the Welch station. 
---
Yeah the rate of fire is slow but satisfying! 
---
You question presumes BGS believes they are broken, and there is no evidence that is the case. 
---
the harpoon gun spoils me because it gives back free harpoons on bodies, so I dont mind churning out ammo for the 50 cal
---
bAn HiS hAcKeR @$$!!!!!!11!!!1!!!
---
I'll be on about 2 and a half hours from now, send me a request on Xbox. GT is Dattebayo666
---
Argh, I don't suppose we have to swap to a pipe pistol everytime we fast travel? 
---
i'm 9/10 since level 18... I'm 88.
---
This can happn anywhere, there is always a chance the bag will just not appear. Won't do much for misclicks but if you are dropping for someone else, drop some trash item like a hairbrush or tato in a bag first, then add stuff to the bag to make sure it doesn't disappear.
---
The game is in alpha. If you dont mind being alpha tester for your own money, buy it.
---
i only play this game in hope that they create pvp servers.  i havent tried hunt or hunted radio in months.  this doesnt mean i am any less interested in pvp
---
 Did you check your stored tab? There was a dupe bug that would dupe most of your camp stuff. You could end up with more plants, generators, electrical wires, water purifiers etc..
---
If not did you try moving your camp sometimes that helps.. I would go through your tabs though and see if you have extra items...
---
That what I was thinking the whole time lol
---
Looks like I was too late.  Had to get my kids ready for school.
---
Damn shame. I'm on PC, so I guess xbox users probably encounter it as well. 
---
that an ini file affect client settings, like monitor resolution,  is all good and well, but that it affect server behaviour is simply bonkers.
---
Forgot to add that I won't really be playing with friends. Unless people here want to play hehe
---
I see you also went to Captain Smirk's Big Body Pirate Gym. But every good pirate knows you start with an insult then a response!. Maybe you should pay him 30 more pieces o' eight and ask for...THE MACHINE!
---
Yes. There are no restrictions, as long as you play on the same platform. 
---
And then, right, you've got like a dozen map makers for the "*Finish* repairs" objectives obscuring the marker that might actually lead you back to the control room.
---
It's a mess.
---
\&gt; Red stuff in AP bar means you're dehydrated.   
---
Or hungry, or you have a disease.
---
Ah well sounds like they were glitching. If you nor any party members initiated pvp then that‚Äôs not normal. 
---
Somehow less stable for me on pc. 
---
Yeah I noticed this when I was in my 20s, when my then godly black powder rifle disappeared. 
---
I kind of disagree with this. 
---
I said it! 
---
It would be way OP. I‚Äôm only lvl 26-30 right now(lost track last night) but at white springs I‚Äôve killed multiple 3 star enemies and have received one weapon with 3* and that‚Äôs fair to me. 
---
Imagine getting a 3* weapon for every 3* ghoul you come across in whitespring? Absurd. 
---
Maybe edit this so a 3* mirelurk queen always drops 3*. That would be understandable. Not for ghouls / super mutants and other common enemies though. 
---
(Mirelurk queen is just an example for an uncommon big boss type enemy)
---
put the mats in your inventory
---
Yeah, I keep those &amp; my parasites. I'm a lone wanderer, &amp; sometimes I like having them to talk to. 
---
I think the reason people say its easy is because of the weirdly scaled enemies and lack of engaging content beyond shooting stuff.
---
The pve, as you say, isn't balanced whatsoever. A level 10 can easily kill a level 60 scorched for example. Making levels obsolete same with weapon levels.
---
The game *is* "stupid" as you put it. The AI is easily abusable. The only thing an enemy will do if you're not reachable is to run and hide until you either throw a grenade in its general direction or jump down. Only to immidiately jump back up and become unreachable when the monster comes back to kill you.
---
I'm not saying I know of better options but it certainly is stupid.
---
Scorchbeasts are not supposed to be killed. They are an annoying bullet sponge with no value to kill.
---
"Theory craft" isn't a think in this game, you pick a path and focus on it. There are no min maxing or similar crap.
---
Theres about 400 if you use excavator armor and hit every node 
---
Perfect.
---
Don't waste your money mate, it will be free to lay before log once they implement their micro transaction system fully. 
---
Its being pulled from shelves in shops, the above being presumed the cause.
---
I think I made mine when I only had about 10 intelligence and I have not had to repair it yet. Maybe about, 20 game hours ago? Might be overkill. To answer you question though, I don't know.
---
I don't have any tse weapons but I do have a sse weapon. And its by far one of my stronger weapons. Mind you I feel I have to use all the weight reducing perks so I have no weapon bonus's..
---
Hey, it's fine to cry sometimes. 
---
I'm not sure how much you build is being propped up by there being no other players nearby.    
---
Queenies resist seem to ramp up exponentially as soon as other people join in on the "fun".     
---
I find it impossible to ever be in a position where its a "solo vs queen" fight. So whilst impressive I'm not sure if everyone will have the same success as you do. 
---
I'll ask around and find out the exact vendor cost and password it to you.
---
I saw him yesterday and I got close and he flew away. Scared the shit out of me
---
Sounds to me like bobble head exploiting. I‚Äôll have to make a video or just do it and post a before and after damage example so people understand what is going on and maybe it‚Äôll force Bethesda to fix it. 
---
You can get a rx 580 8gb cheaper than a 1060 3gb. Runs better than 3gb and sees some bumps here and there than the 6gb version. Only reason it's cheaper is because people for some reason stay away from amd gpu's like there the plague.
---
Yikes, maybe we should stay still for a minute before fast traveling? I was fumbling with my stash earlier. 
---
Isn't the explosive damage being reduced to 25% of weapon damage instead of 100%? It's hardly a nerf and they will still dominate pvp.
---
Yep you can‚Äôt use the stuff on your guy gotta put it in your stash.
---
Here's the thing:  I'm a PA rifle/explosive build.  My gauss rifle can usually whittle them down, I even carry a gatling plasma for when I know I'll be dealing with them.  One I can deal with no problem.  Getting double or triple teamed, multiple directions, no way of knowing where to dodge, no ability to aim...that just isn't fun.
---
It's not about the damage I take, that's generally manageable in X-01.  It's that it's a huge hassle and not worth my time.
---
You move around so that the beasts move and  the timing of their attacks shifts to allow for gaps that you can attack through.  At least that is how I have done it the two times I got triple teamed by those noisy nockers.
---
Wow, thanks 
---
 I'll have to watch for that it's a dirty exploit of the ignore player feature
---
It seems to be related to the under armour. I was wearing the Brotherhood Fatigues and he was calling me soldier, switched to my vault suit and he recognizes me as a vault dweller now.
---
Will be going again tomorrow, game glitched after I fast traveled to nuke zone, I died and couldn‚Äôt respawn :(
---
So about 12:00gmt will try again tomorrow
---
Okay, 3.  I always forget about Thunder Mountain.
---
We couldn't play together then.

Yes I saw there was no items in my stored and I just changed locations but this is where it gets weird. First I destroyed the fertilizer to see if that was it but game me maybe 7% back then I tired to change locations but when I did it duped my turret and the defense tower it was on but after I deleted that it game me back the 7% after I deleted the fertilizer so that wasn‚Äôt it I‚Äôm wondering if they have the ability to lower camp budgets when the servers are having problems seeing as how a random nuke atmosphere started and stoped after 5 minutes.
---
I encountered that too, luckily it was just the frame that disappeared. 
---
Make sure you get EU codes, they're currently around $11 on CDKeys.
---
Because it‚Äôs a survival based game?
---
PVP is who shoots first with their duped TSE weapon.
---
Lol, downvoted
---
Rad worms at white springs again....damn, runs to fountain in the gazebo. 
---
Most fun gun imo.  Quad ammo makes it a delight.
---
okay, bunker buster, main quest item. you can kill humans without even vats aiming at them.
---
it's an economy issue.
---
 the gun that every is talking about takes too much time to reload compared to anything. especially since people move to fast and vats is easy to bait.
---
I have 2 bunker busters (because people are crazy), pretty much just been learning plans for weapons and mods. trust me when I say this you gave up to quick son.
---
do you know what grenades do? what about mines. what happens when drop a mine and the shoot it with a rocket.
---
Don't be a defeatist,
---
I guess you're just like that one guy who wouldn't make it in the post apocalypse. you never think it's gonna be you and then bam you can't do simple math. 
---
the brown bag is both a curse and a blessing....the discreetness does make it harder for a random passerby (or assassin) to find and steal all your stuff. At least YOU have the little directional pin to head towards. Bigger downside is if it generates beneath something and you're basically f\*cked because you can see it but cant click it..... alternative solution, hire bodyguards/entourage to walk around with you so that you don't die!
---
I have found that you really need to be careful, at least on the PC, with selling, dropping, or scrapping items. The issue comes after you select your first item and sell/remove/scrap it. When you select your 2nd item, if you move the mouse after clicking item number 2 and it's still over the item select area of the pip, it can apply your drop/sell/scrap command, not to the one you clicked on, but instead the one that has the select bar over it. 
---
It might also happen on the consoles, possibly if you bump the sticks? IDK, but I know I have sold/scrapped/dropped items that I didn't want to. right now I never do anything from the "All" tab, and I always make sure to sort without a filter, as if you sort by weight/value/spoil, items will change position at random after each inventory change. 
---
What‚Äôs he selling?
---
"my friends and I have moved on" yet you created a new Reddit username just for trolling this sub...
---
Thanks  :)
---
Some moderately rare plans and The Dragon
---
Looks like a hunting expedition is in order.
---
1. Tatos, corn, mutfruit and razorgrain you can find at most farms growing. Combine with boiled water at a crafting station and you get soup which fills both hunger and thirsts which is great. Some foods add stats as well (Ribeye Steak from Brahmin, Radstag meat, Ant meat and Frog legs give +carry weight and Cranberry Pie (Cranberries &amp; Boiled Water) gives +5% exp. The workshops "Sunshine Tidings Industrial Farm" can also produce food if you hook it up to a power source, can be good to bulk food that doesn't expire.
---
2. You are either dehydrated or hungry, or you have a disease that removes AP. Try drinking, eating or using disease cure.
---
3. You drop all of your junk in a paper bag where you died. If you want it back you can walk back there and pick it up, you lose nothing but junk though.
---
4. There are some charisma perks that give you bonuses for being in a group, but there are also charisma perks that give you bonuses for solo play (Lone Wanderer rank 4 is a must have for solo players)
---
5. Save them as much as possible and wait for things you reallly like in the atom store, everything there is cosmetic though so don't worry about needing them for anything important. You can do challenges to get more atoms t o get the outfits and skins that you want. I recommend getting CAMP items, armor and weapon skins above all since you will be using those the most.  
---
Let me know if you have any more questions, if you are on PC we have a discord chat you could join with friendly Europeans that would be glad to help you out! Group play or solo play doesn't matter, it's a chat for all.
---
Cool. Will see if I can get online now. Thanks.
---
Do your plans include adding strontium 90 and caesium 137 to all the food? 
---
You know. For the flavor...
---
No, if you plan on buying them. You might consider buying them with an alt character between lvl 15 and 45 and trade it back to your main via a trustworthy player. I did it with a good friend of mine.
---
Or you get another player in this level range to buy it for you. 
---
Alternatively, there is a good chance of the blueprint dropping as a reward from an event at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary.
---
I love his videos too, thanks for sharing!
---
My biggest issue with the game is that I can‚Äôt immerse myself in it, when the entire story is told through holotapes. The bugs will certainly be distracting, but if someone enjoys a game enough, they can just play through them and trust that over time they will improve (And have been so far)
---
If you‚Äôre looking for a MMO style Fallout 4, you may want to wait to see if Bethesda does an overhaul (if that is even an option) I have only put in about 8 
---
hours into the game since BETA. I get bored with it pretty quickly and often times will only log in for a few minutes at a time before quitting and playing something else. 
---
That said, none of my gamer friends are into Fallout and I‚Äôm sure if I played with some people I could get some moderate enjoyment. If that isn‚Äôt the case for you, then give it a go. Outside of that, if you go into it expecting it to feel like FO4, then like my experience, you will probably be disappointed for now.
---
Spider bee spider bee does whatever a spider bee does
---
Yeah, I'm not throwing a tantrum, but thanks for a great advice. And you seem to be the one butthurt about my utterly low opinion of this piece of crap software pretending to be a game.
---
If you spec into it yea, it's pretty good, look up on YouTube Vats Critical build Fallout 76. There's some pretty good builds out there.
---
End game bosses call for end game weaponry don't you think?  I fight them all the time and they do not require a TSE to defeat.  TSE's are a convenience, but like any wonder weapon you get into the habit of trying to power through stuff first and actually thinking tactics second and you get into trouble.
---
Each server restarts at some point, that's when there is fresh loot, I'm guessing each 24 hours if the server functions properly, less when servers start crashing and are forced to restart which happens quite often sadly.
---
That's the spirit! You're a big boy now!
---
Now go play outside for a while.
---
That's what it sounds like. If they instakill through the slap damage, it's stacked bobbleheads.
---
Most likely dupers getting rid of excess items before the bans and patches come through. 
---
Short answer is yes but would recommend 1060 if you got the money.
---
I think the sweet spot is 15.   At level 15 ive seen the handmade.  Currently level 20 now with my alt and have not seen a handmade plan again.   
---
They are related to Skyrim‚Äôs mountain climbing horses 
---
What exactly do people get out of attacking others CAMPs?
---
Thanks for your concern, I am outside, child.
---
Have you tried to store your rad shower, and then place it again? 
---
My experimentation with various two shot weapons points to increasing hip-fire accuracy with mods being the best way to improve their overall accuracy. I have tested this with a broadsider, crossbow, handmade rifle, ultracite laser, and 10mm SMG, all two shots. The stationary aiming reticule is more closely grouped with hipfire accuracy mods.
---
I made my current one with an Intelligence of 24 and yeah really durable. But the question still stands
---
He looks grotesque and makes insects... look out here comes the spider bee...
---
Good boy! Don't forget to wash your hands later!
---
iVolumetricLightingTextureQuality=0
---
Try adding this below it.
---
Glad to help!
---
Before they added push-to-talk and before I realized the voice chat settings defaulted to on, I must have spent an hour wandering around the Forest stoned as fuck, singing to myself, babbling at my cat, screaming like a little girl when I got ambushed by Liberators, etc., before another player finally came up to me and said "you, uh... you do realize your mic is open, yeah?"
---
I had not realized. Thank you, kind stranger, and I am so, so sorry.
---
ah, see THAT i can totally agree on... they are a huge waste of time considering they drop heavy weight crap basically. I'm a mutli build... non-pa stealth/rifle, PA rifle/heavy, PA melee.....im surprised you have trouble with multiples with your loadout honestly though. As soon as i hear that screech and flapping, i throw on whatever PA i happen to select in my inv (since i carry 4 and have no way of knowing which is which) and pull out my tse handmade....if things get too intense i'll bust out my exploding 50cal, but that isnt very often. Maybe its the slow fire rate of the gauss rifle that's causing you trouble. Not to tell you how to play, but you may want to consider a quicker firing rifle even if just for them (explosive recommended).  
---
so... i hear stealthboys are useful? lol
---
It is about balancing stuff. TSEs were broke as hell. Individually those two effects were far far far superior to any other legendary effect. It was a joke Bethesda let them into the game like that. But at least they acknowledge it and fix it.
---
Sometimes something is just so strong there is no way to fix it by ‚Äúmaking things more fun.‚Äù How do you explain away them being 6 times more powerful than base weapons? Six. In an AOE.
---
Don‚Äôt blame Bethesda for balancing. It‚Äôs a necessity in games.
---
I run a low health bloodied build with unyielding sentinel armor also. I have no problem with the queen as long as people nuke it right usually the people I run with leave dropsite v9 outside the nuke which let's us kill her with no rads. I dont farm nuked whitesprings at all but I can see how not having a hazmat or PA is a problem in that zone. 
---
I blame it on the communists.  It has to be their fault somehow.
---
I like to hang out on top of the red car at the spawn point for whitesprings courtyard. It's always nice when someone takes me out in a huge expolsion to clear my bounty. Also since it's whitesprings, people are happy to give be a double tap to clear me.
---
Sorry can‚Äôt get online right now. Thanks anyway 
---
I hate comments like this. 
---
'Make your own fun'
---
That's not what you pay money, for a game, to do.
---
The game needs story and substance. It needs to be fun and not repetitive. it needs to have character to keep you there. By you and others saying this proves that this game is nothing but a husk of a lifeless mess from a game company that have a track record of actually great games that made it fun FOR YOU TO PLAY.
---
Eh, ok
---
It would be nice to modify them, because they are a bit underwhelming.. some weapons in the game just can;t be modified.. yet?
---
There is also an entrance from inside the whitesprings.  
---
Have you tried logging off and reloading 
---
There is, but unfortunately it is not working in this game. It did work for Skyrim tho. You can try lowering your mouse DPI while increasing your in-game mouse sensitivity since the in-game setting doesn't change the lock-picking sensitivity.
---
From what I read, players confirmed it up until lvl 45. I'd have to check again with the character I bought it with - she's lvl 17 by now.
---
Afaik, the plan doesn't show up in the traders' inventories all the time. You might want to check harpers ferry and Watoga and maybe server hop a little. 
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt done the maths in mine yet, but get the feeling I‚Äôm missing 1 too. I once picked a card that wasn‚Äôt related to the special I picked. But that shouldn‚Äôt matter should it?
---
Personally, i was so damn tired of grinding JUST to repair the X0-1 that i switched to T-60...was such a treat..cool mods for it,and cheap as hell to fix....not much diff in specs too. with my leg bracers, i can carry like 365 lbs...I also have perk for carry weight etc..so that helps too.
---
That's not true, world loot is server specific, just some item containers are different for each player. I can server hop the whole day to farm a specific place if I wanted to, things such food, junk that spawn in the world will appear again on another server IF another player hasn't already taken that on that specific server. 
---
No, the best way to get lead is Lucky Hole
---
Nope that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve not been posting codes. I‚Äôve gotten bored of it 
---
Check out universal studios. They do it with much bigger brands and have much more foot fall. Your plan can not work  as you suggest imo 
---
Sorry for late reply 
---
Yeah all the times I was burned by this, I was fast traveling out of Whitesprings so out of paranoia now I try to walk out to a less laggy/high traffic area (like the nearby train station) before fast traveling.  When I arrive somewhere, I also stay idle for an extra few seconds after everything arrives to permit the game to catch up to me.  It's annoying to stand there while supermutants shoot up my camp every time, but at least I haven't had this bug lately.
---
Yes, it is easier to run that setup outside of rad zones but I don't think that should be the case.  I don't think you should have to avoid certain game play while running the best non-power armor in the game.
---
if u dont have flora banked from all the nuke zones so far, im suprised u even have a contamination shower.  also if ur on ps4 ill just give u the flux to repair, its not expensive or rare.  gamertag is piwrecks
---
I had one like that as well. Modded it for ultracite and gave it to a buddy along with a stack of ultracite bolts.
---
Hang around whitesprings and watoga merchants after a nuke and you might be able to buy one from a player or merchant. Maybe even just pick one up off the ground.
---
Best power plant name ever.
---
Ahh ok. So green thumb doesn‚Äôt proc on them?
---
Idk, I like the PvP idea but it‚Äôs wacky right now.
---
I was defending my workshop when someone twice my level tried claiming it in the midst of my defense event. 3 times I shot him down with my lever action but he kept coming back. 
---
After the third kill he brought in his TSE. I died (obviously). I went back for my revenge at which point he stood there with TSE Minigun and full power armor with a high jumping mutation (I assume from how he jumped so friggin high).
---
He then proceeded to search for me on the map even after I had given up on retrieving the workshop.
---
That‚Äôs the griefing I don‚Äôt like about this PvP. If they are a high enough level and you‚Äôre low enough they can stalk and kill you relentlessly until you leave the server with absolutely no punishment other then a 10 cap bounty. 
---
I would hold out for another sale. The game is not worth full price right now. I enjoy it, I stream it every no-and-again and i find most players are nice and give you things they don't need. Exploring the world is a lot of fun, but from time to time you'll find no enemies for a very long time, and as people have said the Quests aren't as involved. If you can make a solid group of friends to play, or aren't afraid to talk/teamup with strangers you can have a lot of fun.
---
Unfortunately this happens on a regular basis. I hope it will be fixed. 
---
Ok yeah that makes sense as my weight was around 230ish when my armor was working properly and now it‚Äôs like 300...maybe some of it is additional ammo and cores but otherwise not much else has changed 
---
Are you the same guy that originally posted this a few days ago or is this a reupload? In that case, shame on you!
---
It might also be an original vid, didn't actually bother to watch
---
It'd be awesome to have more people to play with.  Right now I just have one irl friend who plays. Gamertag is Yimi Doje
---
yep.. last night I  died due to extreme rad gain while immobile.. it turns out that some charred ghouls decided to hit me while everything was still invisible, and I was helpless.
---
Of course I will, I'm not you.
---
Once you learn the mechanics and become familiar with the how the mobs move in combat it becomes very easy, though you can still be surprised by unseen mobs and you can fail due to not having enough chems (mainly stimpaks) or not timing their use correctly. 
---
Harsh!
---
Thats hihgly depends on price. If you can get it cheap, buy it.
---
The game in its current state is like an Early Acces title with a price tag of 25-30 bucks.  There is not a single aspect of the game which done well. Probably after 6 month or a year, its going to be a great experience and worth an AAA price tag. 
---
I take it you don‚Äôt play open world sandbox games very much. 
---
How many do you get there?
---
Yeah, I'm level 130 and I'm also batting around 0 for 20 with Patrol Duty. Of course, my friend got it on his second attempt.
---
At risk of sounding elitist as well every time i see these posts.... i agree.  I am a multi build, and my PA rifle/heavy will decimate the little bastards. i'll run them down just because it's easy xp. 
---
It's pretty easy to blend multiple builds together. I understand some people are very specific...but i mean, my main alone is: non-PA stealth sniper, PA explosive 50cal, PA explosive rifle, PA melee. Between those, i can switch it up and handle just about every situation in teh game BUT other players....they still kick my ass if they are spec/geared at all for it.
---
The nukes don't even knock down buildings tho
---
Oh, gotcha. Seems he fixed it. 
---
This game is not going F2P. Stop stirring shit.
---
That's my current setup, full hip-fire, and it works well at short range.  
---
Now, my goal was to change it to be able to engage at mid distance, but I guess I'll need another shotgun, without two-shot.
---
Have you read the news? 
---
If they are the fingers I‚Äôm thinking off,  already harvested and just laying around? Like when you find snap tails and star berries in the agricultural center. No green thumb doesn‚Äôt work on stuff already harvested.
---
So are you Sauk g there are ginger plants you can harvest in the Whitesprings houses or you can find ginger there? 
---
Nice! I haven't tried that yet, tbh I haven't even bothered with power armour yet, though. Maybe this is my missing link haha!
---
I'll work on the Excavator PA and see how i go!
---
Is Lucky Hole Mine frequently pre-mined by others?
---
That's a really good way of putting it.
---
assuming that someone is a much more powerful character "no dobut boosted up on a bunch of duped bobbleheads" is so ignorant it hurts to read.  any character with 1 orbital strike beacon grenade can level your camp.  nothing needs to be duped, dont need to be very high level to aquire a good grenade of some kind.  theres also a home wrecker perk built into the game to help increase camp/workshop destruction damage, as well as demolition expert perk.  All this information was available before the game was official released. the fact u get upvoted for this nonsense shows how delusional this sub has become.
---
I feel we should do a server event. At a date and time, we should locate him and give thanks/praise.
---
Yeah there‚Äôs like a flower shop outside along the ghoul loop. 
---
There is no reason for it. As you said there is no reward right now. People who are destryoing camps are doing it just because. 
---
Sorry, just sold one at one of the vendors...just isn't good enough to keep.  My 3\* super sledge is still the best melee Iv'e had for the last 100 lvls 
---
They could at least disable the right arrow = stimpac in vats. Doesn't change my weapon pressing left, should be same for right (during vats)
---
You kill people without using VATS ! Incredible ! \*SARCASTIC\*
---
You prove my point, if developpers played the game like you, they probably though that the game was fairly easy. Actually, the game is ridiculously easy and thus, boring, like I said earlier.
---
Something weird happened to me last night too right before I stopped playing.  Leveled up to 47 and chose AGI, then selected a Perk card.  Then I couldn‚Äôt equip said Perk card.  Figured it was just an error on my part. I will have to check again today when I play to see if my point was just missing until I logged out/in or if I messed up somewhere.
---
I did the math and things added up to 46+7 points.  I believe that works out.  Level 47 would be 46 level ups from 1, and you start with 7.
---
Do you get a single point at level 1?  Or is your first point at level 2?
---
No matter what you're likely to get bad drops. At least I've never been able to remedy the situation
---
Fair enough. I used to feel the same way. Then I started playing multiplayer with a mic and couldn't believe how much better MP gaming was. It's now more awkward to game with people who don't have a mic. I usually just give up from frustration trying to understand what the hell they want.
---
I partnered up with a lower level friend and we decided to give this event a try. I had never done it before, but I was feeling confident, so I just ran straight inside. Meanwhile, he is outside and becomes swarmed with enemies. I then spent the next 30 minutes running around just trying to find a door to get out and help him. He is yelling for me to save him and I can only yell that I am an idiot that can‚Äôt find the freaking door. We have not gone back since. 
---
Could be a lesson there somewhere.
---
I was 9/10 for the longest time too. Just got it #10 over the weekend. Just kept checking Whitesprings to see if there was any player hanging out there who was a low level. Low levels spawn the golfers. 
---
All that being said, I checked dozens of times before I got lucky. 
---
Details?
---
I thought it was going to be a picture of a stable hosting environment!  *rimshot*
---
Just uploaded OC.
---
It just bugs me that I've been attacked by a level 50 enemy when I'm level 14.  It just leaves me with a feeling of "what the hell am I supposed to do besides let this thing kill me?"
---
I think anyone can harvest the node cant they? My fireteam did ultracite runs for a while and we all got to click on the node. I dont think lead nodes are different.
---
Same experience for me. I hopped a lot at 25, no handmade.
---
I wish more games did shields. I absolutely loved how The Division had this option to use ballistic shield and pistol. Made for very good FPS tanking, which is fairly rare. I could walk around and get enemies out of cover by flanking them, while soaking up a lot of damage for the team. Still vulnerable, because it only protects from the front, but such fun gameplay.
---
It's awesome. It's like playing fallout in fallout haha. It's a text rpg like the grognak one. I hope there are more. I like playing it while waiting for spawns to trigger in a nuked whitespring 
---
Thank you for the kind words good sir!  Lucky Hole Mine is a great place as well if you have the acid to support it!  I have the Lucky Hole Mine video queued to go live within the week as well (best lead farm I have found for people who use this stuff like breathing air) it just took a while because I kept having issues recording that area :-p  I also will have a steel (iron ore) route video up soon as well as some locations that I use that guarantee spawn enemies dropping acid every time.
---
Also if you guys ever need any other material in mass quantities let me know, I plan to do more routes on most of the games raw junk items eventually but if you have a need I can always do those ones next instead of just picking one at random and rolling with it :-)
---
Stay safe in the wastes guys!
---
What are you waiting for? Go buy it!
---
Wouldn't it be nice if Sixteen Tons played every time you entered a mine?
---
Duping really screwed this game up.
---
As if PvP wasn't already a bad enough idea in a Fallout title......now you've got people running around with full sets of Sentinel Unyielding armor going up against some poor schmuck who can't even get a full set of 3*armor.
---
Yup. I server hopped at watoga and ferry at 15 and bought the plan.   But since i lvled past 15 i have not seen it since server hopping those to vendors.  
---
with ore though, don't you also need a BUTTLOAD of acid too?
---
Nope - don't bother unless you have a level 15-19-ish character.
---
Nice job with the CAMP. I've got a hidden basement and will "sample" your idea of boxing yourself in with a wall.
---
You still paid for what in your words is a piece of crap. Hah.
---
It's on their horizon, per the [January 9th](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019) "Inside the Vault" and was not in the most recent patch.  Hopefully it'll be addressed in the patch at the end of this month, along with some of the issues with dailies (such as getting Patrol Duty to trigger more regularly).
---
underrated comment right here.  personally my favorite way to initiate pvp is via workshop battles.  only target players who have claimed workshops, therefore have allowed themselves to be engaged in pvp.  i make sure i also have workshops claimed so others can start pvp with myself.  the most fun ive had in this game has been fighting over a workshop. it feels similar to capture the flag.  easily more fun than any whitesprings nuke or SBQ raid.
---
I was able to do it at a similar level. It was lots of running though. I will be on later tonight on XB1 if you want help with any of the missions I‚Äôm a level 54
---
Probably because my "biggest guns" aren't legendaries.  I do have some, but it's by and large the WRONG ones--level 15 pump action instigating explosive, combat rifle with + against limbs, mirelurks, and extra speed while aiming, and recently a minigun (strike one) with executioner (uhh...), crippling (strike two), and...I'll have to look at the other thing, but yeah, not so useful.
---
Honestly, the freaking gatling plasma is my best anti-scorched weapon.  That's just freaking sad.
---
That's pretty much all i play.
---
Mobile games have more to it than fo76 and it pains me to say it because I've loved all the fallout games.
---
With a proper sandbox you aren't creating your own fun. The developers create the environment to allow it. There are mechanics put in place to allow you to do that yes, but to 'create your own fun' is a ridiculous excuse/way to enjoy a game. 
---
I have the same opinion.  It's the combination of the two that's a problem.  Explosive alone is good, but you're not exactly one-shoting your way through danger even with the 100% damage it does now.  Taking it down to 25% seems like it would make it rather pointless.
---
What made explosive guns killer in Fallout 4 was that both the relevant gun perk *and* the explosives perk applied to them (on top of Bloody Mess).  That's how you could achieve the 3-4x damage in that game.  I don't know if the prefix follows the same rules in 76.  If it does, okay, 25% might be viable.  You could work it up to 75% or something with perk cards.
---
Car doors are woefully ineffective at stopping even pistol caliber rounds.
---
Awesome. Thanks, my dude!
---
Calibrated shocks for Excavator? Those are a myth!
---
Yeh sometimes I can do lots of damage and others not a smidge. It's really weird. 
---
Filling in story that Bethesda was too lazy to write. 
---
Nice! I'll have to give it a try with my mate. And don't you need heaps of acid to smelt the ore? Is that hard to come by?
---
Thats one of the reasons I tried this way, can still get 100+ lead for 5 minutes work and just need to scrap it all
---
If you go to the ski resort and disarm all of the tin cans; there are three hanging above the fire, three by a door entrance, and then three more if you make a left by the fire and go to the destroyed house. Each trap gives you 9 cans. Do that three times and you‚Äôll have hundreds of lead and steal. 
---
THEY TOOOK OUR JERBS!!!
---
You can‚Äôt nuke it because this is all a simulation done by an AI to see if human nature will revert to self destruction when given the option to do so and repeat their mistakes for personal gain 
---
And our characters are all synths - that‚Äôs why we can ‚Äúrespawn‚Äù
---
Obviously we failed 
---
I finally got this done yesterday...I spent at least 8 hours through many weeks to complete...so tired this place now I doubt I will ever go back.
---
We want jobs today or tomorrow!
---
Correct, nodes are specific to each person thankfully.  If you go in with a group and farm out lead ore and then iron ore in the hills you can easily set 1-2 ranged players up in ammo to last a week or more.
---
Now is that a way to speak to your elders?
---
No ice-cream for you today, little man.
---
Okay so this happened to me too and I thought I was just being dumb but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me. Worst part is it actually happened like 3 times back to back to back all with agility.
---
i appreciate your post.  I despise PA but am basically forced into using it if I want to farm the areas where I can MAYBE get an upgrade to my non-PA gear.  If they were to allow the hazmat suit to go over your armor then I could skill PA almost entirely.  
---
One of the many moments where you ask yourself...is it a Bug or is it a Feature?!?
---
I dont know the answer, but if you have any friends with 1-3 ranks of one gun army, and enough charisma to share the card, you might be able to test it directly.
---
Wait.  Rumor that it is going Free 2 Play.
---
The weight reduction is nice at the very least.
---
What about it? I'm not being sarcastic im just asking. 
---
Dumbass question but I can‚Äôt find the answer to it.
---
Wth is TS and TSE? 
---
Same here on both golfer ghouls and the clown wendigo.
---
They are worse than ESC dragons
---
This is a pretty good method for sure, but Lucky Hole Mine, if you have the acid, will get you 1000+ lead scraps per 20-25 min run.  Thanks for sharing!
---
He's not asking for anyone to redesign the map. Just change what spawns at different places. 
---
At least have some fight each other
---
I want a legendary one. A Furious protest sign.
---
Wow, you are utterly rubbish at comebacks. No wonder you're fan of the game.
---
There should be mods for the protest signs to increase damage against robots.
---
you mean in raider territory? the irony
---
They closed the course for the patrons so the whitesprings personnel can have a go as well once in a while 
---
The late lamented Star Wars Galaxies had this capability.  Unfortunately after a while many planets became littered with ghost towns...
---
Try farming caps directly at posieden power plant. With cap collector 3 there's 10 possible cap stashes to nab. Usually I see 7/10 of them along with regular bobblehead pick ups. You can get up to 3k caps an hour
---
I would hate that. good post, and good thoughts on the weight issue, but, they simply need to power-up their servers to handle the database issue, and speed.  there is no in game logical reason why a person shouldn't be able to carry/store as much stuff as they can grind for...
---
basically, if I find it, I should be able to keep it.  problem is performance on tracking all that stuff.
---
Not sure which you‚Äôre talking about but you could always order from their website. Of course shipping would be expensive and probably take 2 months...
---
TS means two shot, guns fire an extra bullet so you do 2x the damage
---
TSE mean two shot explosive, which means the two bullets also explode!
---
Both weapon effects will be severly nerfed/weakened on the next update
---
You should have one less point than your level. You don't get a point for level 1.  
---
In the end, at level 50 you should have 49 stat points spent.
---
Cool add my GT DUUDEwith2Us I‚Äôll be online in about 20 mins

How to disable PVP -  
---
Step 1:  Cut a hole in the...sorry, wrong step 1.  It's turn pacifist mode on,  
---
Step 2:  Don't claim a workshop or mess around with someone else's.  
---
Step 3:  If someone is acting the fool and constantly slapping you, block them in social and hop servers.  
---
Enjoy!  
---
This message brought to you by Free States Alliance Insurance.  Friends you can trust...unlike the government.
---
Take me home
---
you sir are my hero
---
Pictures or it didn‚Äôt happen...I mean I saw it happen, but still, pictures are still necessary. 
---
I did mine really early into the game with ease
---
I go to fort defiance more for the ballistic fiber, but thanks for the info, I'll try this out.
---
Or in this case the entire gun build section of the community becomes unplayable and they leave the game.
---
You do but you can target areas that have enemies that drop it every time you play like the train wreck west of Mountainside Bed and Breakfast (2 Yaoi Guai), Toxic Larry's (3 snally gasters + a chance at a flatwoods monster), Dolly Sods (2 Yaoi Guai plus if the flying bugs spawn they drop acid items too), etc.  If you target a good chunk of those areas and just quickly hop to and kill them every 30-45 minutes you can get 100+ acid an hours.
---
If you prefer the passive acid farming method you can take over the Hemlock Holes Workshop + place your base on the west side of the Hemlock Holes golf course for a total of 4 acid collectors.  This will also get you 100+ acid per hour.
---
The only reason I disagree is because it's so easy to max out each vendor without that already
---
Nah, go buy a game with positive comments, so you can regret *that*. 
---
Your next suggestions should start with "wouldn't it be nice". 
---
The fucker jumped me on a highway out of nowhere and I spent the next 15 minutes trying to run away from him.
---
If I go 30 minutes without a crash or disconnect, I consider that to be a good session.  
---
Haha go back to the forest/heap/toxic valley. Idk but I dont think SB's spawn at less than 50. The one east of Whitesprings wrecked me a few times in the beginning. and your right, at lvl 14 your just gonna make the SB more mad.
---
The forest and possibly the toxic valley are lvl locked, I used to think the heap was too but ive seen enough lvl 60+ to rethink that.
---
I wont b on until like 3 pm cst if thts alright
---
Don't willingly put yourself in that position.  Store you stuff often.  If you have too much stuff prioritize what you want to keep and sell/giveaway/dump the rest.  Actively avoid situations where you can be killed when you are carrying junk of high value.  If I am overencumbered with lead ore from a mine I am not going to join an event that spawns nearby, indeed I will try to avoid that area.  If you are in that situation then get a friend to kite the mobs away while you grab the bag, or do that yourself if you really need it.
---
They are not level capped persay, they just share a spawn with all the other ghouls, so the higher you are more likely to see other ghouls. This isn‚Äôt helped the whitespings gets nukes all the time. But some good news is that they can spawn anywhere within whitespings that can spawn ghouls so it‚Äôs often easier to just do circuits and servers hope till they eventually spawn in.
---
Built a house between some wire fencing near there. Then walked about twenty feet to the left of my house and started taking a ton of Rads, realized my house was a stone's throw from that fissure.
---
For me it's the other way around
---
this is an example of exploit griefing. just destroying a camp is not griefing, but surrounding yourself with others to bait someone into getting wanted is absolutely an exploit that should be removed from the game. 
---
I have. It's dull.
---
The two-shot damage is also being dropped. I think the damage reductions to the explosion and to the extra bullet will be fine. But there is some concern that the accuracy penalty on two-shot may make it not worth using it because the accuracy penalty will more than offset the damage boost.
---
But I dont have any TSE gear myself, so I wont be able to test it.
---
I‚Äôm also rocking the original XB1. I noticed my friends who have the one S load a bit quicker than me but they seem to have more lockup issues than me. Could it be true that less power is somehow better?
---
Yupper, also there are a good amount of can traps in Crevasse Dam and Camden Park as well.  
---
Avoid emotional attachments to junk.  Junk will never love you back.
---
Like power armor?
---
I was giving you a price check. I dont actually have one 
---
This!  not to mention anyone who has claimed a workshop has opened themselves up to pvp.  workshop pvp has been the most (intangibly) rewarding experience in the game for me thus far.
---
On that note, maybe they can add a raid INTO that underground labyrinth to add something else to do Endgame. 
---
Not at all. I simply decided to treat you like the child you are.
---
Have you done your homework yet, Timmy?
---
me too! 
---
found TS (crappy) and got an explosive flamer..expensive ammo, and cool to watch, but still can take things down as quickly as my melee super-sledge.  I just want a pistol/shotgun/rifle that can deal 300+ damage/shot
---
Genuine curiosity question here. But why do you, and other players ive seen post, keep so many materials?
---
I feel like maybe im playing wrong? 
---
Once i built my camp up completely, i keep about 20 of each material, with the exception of anything i need to make ammo with. Those ill keep hundreds of. And i keep a bit more for ballistic fiber, adhesive and screws.
---
 But things like wood, aluminum, glass etc i keep to about 10 to 20 of.
---
You arent the first person ive seen saying they keep 100+ of all scrap so im just curious as to why? 
---
Yeah it's life. What I ended up doing was making a concrete walkway into my house with some metal doors to try and make it look better. 
---
Got it as a Christmas present and I'm having fun with it.  Imagine if you took Fallout 4, improved on a lot of the existing features, added a sizable amount of new weapons, but had a less complicated story.  Then you'd have FO76.
---
Alright, then go play your rubbish game ;) I'm all good, manchild.
---
On Xbox lvl 5 TSE shotguns are a thing and are on the rise.

Really?

Troubleshoter for Rping
---
Not if you turn on pacifist so you don't engage in pvp in the nuke zone like a noob.
---
I had my girlfriend playing the other day with a "its an online game so I can't pause, here take the control and pull this trigger to shoot anything that comes for me, I need to put the bins out".
---
Came back two minutes later and she was creeping around looking for the one ghoul I'd left in the building.
---
It wouldnt account for the 100 change, and its probably the power armor glitch, but be aware several foods you can cook will give temp carry weight bonuses too. Theyre great for getting out of places if you get overencumbered
---
Hemlock hills nets a pretty good amount of acid for holding it. It's not a very popular workshop, which woks out nice because the one or two times you need acid its usually available. 
---
My issue is keeping up with steel scrap. But another commentor gave me an idea for that.
---
I think it's a bug/glitch.  I had a teammate (my son) show as level 0 (he's lvl 61) after we fast traveled.  I was kidding him that he was rolled back to beta launch due to some duper.  
---
It cleared up after we logged out for a break.  
---
I know in this case there was no exploitation involved, so I would hazard a guess it's the same for others.
---
Pacifist doesn‚Äôt prevent you from taking PvP damage, only prevents you from dealing it or returning a slap. You can still be killed with pacifist active. 
---
There are scorched variants of most enemies and they're way tougher than average, but Ghouls are created by radiation. Not every human or creature has been infected.
---
I hope they'll add a pacifist mode along with or after the pvp one that entirely prevents damage against other players outside of actual pvp areas like workshops 
---
A friend of mine suggested having the images appear on your in camp tv when you turn it on.
---
Pictures are accepted through imgur. 
---
So now you can post your pictures 
---
I mean....you can die and spawn back to the team and not take rads....40% of the time it works 100% of the time.

The gym near Flatwoods gives up about 250 -300lbs of lead.

who the fuck took my herbs?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fine. Can do üëçüèª
---
lol id love to see this magical location where its impossible for mobs to spawn or follow another player to
---
I love the modus and enclave storyline in this game. I think it's the most fallout part of this game and really pulls me into the lore. I know it's late in the game,  but honestly whenever I go into that bunker it just feels like nothing else in fallout ever has,  and the first time it had me really going with anticipation. 
---
I also wish I knew how to get enclave flair lol as a side note. 
---
I did that too but the fact it's like a step to get into it is kind of triggering lol.  I tried everything to sink it into the foundation without luck. You can get foundations as the same high and do it that way but then the demenions are off for walls to snap to. It would be cool if they added a simple vanity alternative that didn't include the base, and/or a small wall mounted version would be cool imo
---
To victory brother, my group and I kill the queen constantly and we‚Äôre a mix of est and gmt time zones. Mostly get together on the weekends but I‚Äôm sure our brits would gladly have you during the week. Pm me if you‚Äôre interested and I‚Äôll get you a link
---
Also great for crystal. Just remember to wear your excavator armor for maximum yield 
---
Car. Door. Shield.
---
My understanding is that, with the large mobs that come with some events the server clears out bodies to make room for the next wave/keep the overall server stable. What it should be doing is dropping a meat pile but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
But that‚Äôs why a lot of people loot on the go, not only because of this but because of disconnect problems. 
---
the stretched out graffic glitches make me feel as if i was back home in blight town

You using power patcher or whatever the perk is called so your PA takes less condition damage?
---
I reboot my PS4. But I may start lighting candles and burning incense while praying to the Machine God. 
---
I play on PC. Well, I avoid most people, but the ones I can't avoid tend to act like ass hats. Like 1 shotting uranium fever bosses, running through white springs 1 shotting everything, chasing you around trying to kill you for no reason.
---
They might be paper, could be cloth.  Which makes me ask, why does the formation of these bags not require cloth from your inventory?  And why can I pick locks when I do not carry a screwdriver?  I better stop there.
---
I was pretty happy to see "Kill robots with a Protest Sign" as one of the challenges a few days back.
---
I kept losing my mole costume head, and always just the head.
---
At first I thought I accidentally scrapped it, slowed my scrapping down, still lost it. Slowed even further, lost it again, this time I knew it wasn't an accident.
---
90 ore x 5 =450 lead scrap, if you want high end 90 ore x 10 =900 lead scrap. All depends on super duper proc.
---
Happy cake day!
---
thats not at all what i said, but sure keep ur head in the sand
---
Text-based like  Grognak. I found it in the red rocket near the teapot but I think I got lucky with a magazine spawn
---
That‚Äôs a honey beast,  in savage divide near the cabins.
---
Seconded. I hate PA and thus I'm basically a useless, fragile bunny every time a nuke event is up. I gave up trying to participate in those ages ago but they're literally the only endgame content right now, so... yeah.
---
Oh bet.
---
Ah, okay. That seems kind of pointless though. Most things you acquire in the game aren't bought from a vendor, so that price is basically meaningless. Would be more useful to see the sell price so I know what to keep on me for a trip to a railroad station.
---
I‚Äôd love to see player towns but how would you get around the offline/online camps appearing? Maybe if you had like a group of people (like 3 or 4, nothing huge) who‚Äôs camps were always loaded into the server you‚Äôre on? That would make small player towns viable without a huge strain on the server.
---
Just thinking that if you and your friends built a town then one of you played alone the next time only your camp would be there. Just my thoughts anyway.
---
Mistakes were made.
---
One handed weapons swing faster. It's a dps vs alpha damage mechanic. Shields would be super cool, but I'm guessing it would be a game balance issue.
---
Hmm. I‚Äôm interested in how this build will do once the TS balance changes hit. I see you acknowledged it but I‚Äôm not sure if those bullet points adequately illustrate how it‚Äôs gonna be. Too many different factors to make a for sure conclusion.
---
Thanks for the video. Also I noticed few mention Anti-Amor, and I have an AA Gatling Gun. It‚Äôs fairly effective and I don‚Äôt run heavy weapon damage perks. Maybe I should test that against the queen.
---
I disagree nuke zones are supposed to be hard so that more people aren‚Äôt in them. With serums everyone will be there 
---
&gt; Ain‚Äôt no 70+ year old on Reddit puking in his own lap while he plays Fallout bro

People at work are wondering what is wrong with me now.  Thanks.

Had another user post about people utilising the ignore feature to hide from people which also shows level zero. This wa backed up by me not being able to see them on the map but that's interesting to note as well,  thanks.

Newest iteration.
---
This happens to me constantly.  It's annoying and the worst part is that it happens to the ONLY ONE OF MY FRIENDS that actually plays this game with me.  I'm always leaving the server and having to load in, then jump back into his server assuming its not full.  Then after a short while it will either happen again or one of us will crash and the whole cycle happens all over again.  Same platform, PS4 Pro same version.  Its been happening for months.
---
Excellent! Hahaha.
---
This is case with Offline games, but now we talk about always on multiplayer game.  But it might be a good idea to go other games and then return again, when we have and know what new content we have in Fallout 76.
---
I was thinking of plots for the town, and 1 person each get a plot for a home and shop/restaurant/service, so when they do log off, it won‚Äôt affect the town that much
---
Thanks! 
---
Same is happening on PS4
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the power smith perk
---
+130 to +300?
---
F76 needs VRAM and 3 oder 4GB is not enough. You can play decent with 4GB VRAM at medium. Only 2GB more, like 1060/6GB, and you can play mostly at high. First i played with a GTX 970/4GB, then i tested a 1060/6GB and it was so much smoother with more details.  
---
1060/3GB is just crap nowadays. Dont buy any card below 4GB. Better look for second hand cards like RX580/8GB, GTX 970/4GB or 1060/6GB.
---
True.
---
And the Enclave's deeds gave birth to the BoS, who became their main opponent. 
---
Yea... it is. It's horrible. Can't even have multiple sets of gear and card combos with one character. You also have no way to transfer gear to an alt and end up tossing great items to make space. I started a new character and have been keeping a close eye on my stash, breaking down everything, and then bulking them and such. Still always full.  Don't even get me started with Fuson/Plasma Cores, &amp; heavy ammo. Don't know what the limit should be, but it should be way above 600. Dealing with the stash makes a game feel like a chore.
---
Well, given where the event takes place, the whole "commie idea" of feeding everyone would make more sense than what the devs intended, I'd say. ;)
---
It have mod for better sneak
---
I have an older asus astrix it works very well
---
Oh but hey "don't judge"
---
Marsupial is great, only -1 int with class freak. Loving healing factor as well.
---
All mutations are worth is with max level class freak
---
That‚Äôd work if certain plots could remain whilst people logged off, like your primary camp is removed from the instance but if your plot is a smaller size to allow the server to not be strained it might work. Great thoughts.
---
I was going to say it's a good spot to farm caps too but I thought the other idea was cuter.
---
I am totally down for "Raider" play style. Honestly i feel that right now end game is pretty much blah. Now throw in some roving gangs RPing Raiders and do some Camp defense stuff. Now that would be interesting. The surround thing was kind of weak sauce but so was the asshat, so meh.
---
Thanks all, PC player though, but thanks for the offers of help. 
---
You dont get a bounty from stealing from supply drops

---
I myself think that the "needs support" is game worst building constraint. I'm still mad that you can't place laser tripwires besides the ground level.
---
Seeing that nobody else has said this yet, they didn‚Äôt even change due to radiation exposure, they mutated due to FEV in the atmosphere and most importantly: ulrtacite
---
Scorchbeasts require ultracite either in exposure or diet to survive, and since ultracite isn‚Äôt anywhere else, they remain in Appalachia

i have found this reddit sub to more toxic than any in game experience tbh, glad ur doing well in the wasteland

Oh, it's clearly a bug. üêù

I'm lv 130 never seen or heard of it

Can you? I've passed through there like 30 times and have never seen one. Now I want to just build my camp near there and wait for eternity
---
Why can‚Äôt I make soup from dirty water? Am I not still sitting there actively boiling said water?!?!
---
who shoots second*
---
I never thought of that. 
---
So, is 20 of each all we need? 
---
Maybe if we don't craft or repair so much then we don't need materials????
---
Are you ok having 20 of each??
---
Are you ever unable to craft because of not enough???
---
Or is 20 doable?
---
I ALWAYS give someone a chance to fight for their junk back, or if they openly say they dont want to pvp i just give it back, im not looing to bully anyone, just trying to have some fun.
---
I did. Didn‚Äôt think it was a thing. Picked the locks on them, and became wanted. Happened on two drops that session. Even had to pick the lock on my own drop this morning.
---
friend me ccprime. I would be glad to show you around some of the game mechanics. Just make sure you have a mic so we can talk.
---
Sounds fun. I've never seen one anywhere else but it seems like they exist as rare spawns elsewhere
---
I thought I was going crazy, I am having the same issue with corn and carrot soup.

just put my TSE handmade &amp; X0-1 suit (minus the helmet), inside my stash. hopefully it will be safe in there......for now

---
HAVE SOME GOD DAMM FATE!
---
Wait wrong game 
---
Or a vaccine for rad worms and the blight.
---
I always have both at any given time.
---
If they're not yours and you pick the lock, you will. Part of the last update, I think.
---
After testing, I believe this: You must have completed the quest to get the one with the diamond next to it. The stack of Technical Data with the diamond next to it on your character will hold 10.  You can also have another stack of Technical Data with a number next to it, ex. Technical Data(4). This is the amount over 10. This is the case if you are given the Data from another player, or purchase the data from a vendor. 
---
I have not done this by finding more than 10 myself.
---
I have tried this with 1, 2, 4 and 10 in the diamond. Mostly get ammo and water, maybe an outfit. I have turned in Data about 30 times now with 1 to 4 and get the same results. I have received: Plans for BOS underarmor, engineer outfit, various combat armor. Hoping for paint or Shielded pans for the underarmor.
---
&gt;!During the Fire Breathers quest line you'll get a fireman's hat and suit.  On the last step (before you get sent there you get the hat and suit I believe) you get sent to a cave and there are dead Fire Breathers, quite a few of them.  I'm 99% certain I found more hats in there.  I can't remember if the suits were in there.  Since then I've found 1 or 2 other Fire Breathers at random places and there was a hat on the ground next to one of them.  I have no idea where I saw it though.!&lt;
---
Thats a lie... you dont get a bounty from picklocking the supply drops...
---
Fire the harpoon into a wall and you should be able to count the (I think) 7 Flechettes.

As far as anyone probably knows this would all work just like the shotgun perk works.

#MY DAD NEEDS A JOB!
---
I‚Äôm for this, but not sure about the PvP icon. I feel like anyone with it off would be a target for griefers. 
---
According to the official guide book, all events have a small chance for a leveled legendary item
---
Why, because there's no NPCs to tell it?
---
There should be 2-3 locations on the map where multiple players can build together. Maybe 4-6? That would be amazing
---
I server hopped Grafton train station for about 20 minutes and got one cost about 900 caps or so with no perks 
---
Thats never happened to me
---
Can't remember a name but it's in the mountains south and a bit east of whitesprings
---
Isn't it both cripple and stagger?
---
So you bought duped armour from e-bay and are now complaining that it isn't godmode. Ok. 
---
Attention to compensate for the lack of it in their real life. Look up "negative attention-seeking behaviors" for details. 
---
The stuff about them rping as raiders is utter bullshit since it takes away the fun of those people who don't consent to pvp content. 
---
Some people can't or don't want to deal with pvp for a number of reasons, starting with them not having enough time to play and thus no time to farm junk if someone wrecks their camp all the way to anxiety issues and their inability with stressful situations.
---
I think bethesda needs to step forward and introduce features to protect these players against griefing. Something that entirely prevents them and their camp from taking damage from other players when they play on pacifist mode until they choose to otherwise engage in pvp content. 
---
I will! Say... you couldn't lend me about ¬£500,000 could you? I'll pay you back as soon as I can ;D
---
You have it sorta backward, if critters drop it it's arguably because the original owners got ate.  Bit of a self selecting population set, kinda like how so many big things drop knuckles.  I'm guessing too much alcohol led.to terminal mistakes.
---
I like the 4-6 places. Giving more variety to the server can let people express their creativity!
---
Wat?
---
A man's gotta have a code. Right on! I honestly think picking a role and just playing the hell out of that is where we can get beyond the faults and flaws of the game and still have a blast.
---
{Your companion} liked that. 
---
Speed Demon is my favorite. Functional, combat relevant and amazing quality of life boost. I use food for buffs anyway so the cost is minimal.
---
I run...3 right now? Talons, Grounded and Speed Demon. I could‚Äôve gotten more but I abhor the radiation+mutation RNG. On top of that, these three are all gained randomly and I don‚Äôt want to waste the luck. I‚Äôll just serum the rest I‚Äôd like. Maybe marsupial and Twisted muscles.
---
Marsupial‚Äôs penalty is -4 Int. Int is most effective when hacking. Otherwise it affects bonus durability when crafting. Supposedly extra mats when scrapping but I have heard this bonus maxes out at 5 Int. Overall I‚Äôd say it likely is worth it. Apparently once you‚Äôve used it it‚Äôs so good people can‚Äôt go back.
---
You do now after last patch 
---
I think by good I mean not leather, max level, and multiple effects. It can be tailored by BGS. 
---
So there I was, trudging through this god forsaken wasteland. I traveled through hell, sand, swamps, and poison waste pits. I had been shot at, cut up, bludgeoned, and robbed by the only human being I had found for hundreds of miles. I had healed more broken bones than I knew I had, scars from lacerations gifted from all sorts of wild beasts covered me from head to toe - the few toes I had left. Finally I found my verdant Oaisis. A quiet little forest with abundant resources! There were still beasts, but this felt like a safer place, a place to build and survive.
---
The far off sound of strumming, a string instrument on the wind calling me like a sirens song. A peaceful feeling to recognize the sound of life, an honest to god human being in this empty brutal world. I needed to investigate, I just wanted to find one other living human being, to hold at least one more conversation with a living person! Suddenly out of nothing came a loud bellowing shout. GET OFF MY LAWN! A shot cracks over my shoulder, so loud and close I feel the streak of heat on my cheek, and am deafened in one ear. A second shot rings out...
---
Fire bursts from my side. When your body takes enough damage, all you can feel is the heat. An explosion of searing pain bloomed. This was it..... my ending..... as I'm feeling along the ground crawling I find some nearby roots and use them to pull myself under the brush. Everything fades to black.

I finally wake. It's black out, a dark clouded night sky. The pain is still there, and I'm so very weak. I caught a lucky break. The mud as i crawled caked my body, creating a cheap sort of camouflage, and covering the wound to stem the blood and prolong death, keeping me from bleeding out. There is no coming out of this alive.... but I give myself one last mission. I reach into my bag Fumbling around, I take 9 hard Baseball sized objects from withing. Wonder Glue, String, Ballistic Fiber, My long coat. They become the materials for crafting my righteous vengeance. 
---
I see a light in the darkness. A small house nearby. My Murderers hovel. By pure willpwer I use the last of my strength to move my legs. Its like moving concrete just to inch forward at a time. But its dark, Im still covered in my camouflage, I slowly make my way into the house..... the man is quietly sleeping in his bed, as peaceful as can be. How could this murderer, no, this monster rest so peacefully after condemning another to death in the waste. Standing over the Bed I fulfill my Final mission.
---
 My last act, I pull the pin on my newly fashioned grenade vest. See you in hell Old Man.
---
Playing on xbox, mostly pleasant but every other day I run into a lvl 120+ player that starts attacking me with some dot melee weapon or an auto weapon and it's just annoying. 
---
You have assassins sentinel armor, what more do you need? Running sentinel on a melee build is completely pointless because you're never standing still
---
Not a lie, happened to me too. 
---
I was raided by some guys wearing Santa costumes blasting the version of White Christmas  from Home Alone. 
---
Those guys were chads.
---
Never knew that, thats really stupid though
---
What's wrong with trading? Hardly any traders are dupers. Iv traded alot of weapons armor mats and plans on Reddit and have ran into 1 duper total. It's very easy to tell when one is and all the trading pages shut them down and ban them almost instantly. Without trading with the tiny stashes we are allowed it would be the 1 in a million chance of getting a great item when your build is able to use it. That almost never happens. I'm a rifle build and have been farming legendarys for 2 months atleast 5 hours a day often 8 hours a day (few missed days for doctors appointments but only a few as I'm stuck at home with a chronic illness) and have only found 2 rifles that are great and fit my build. The rest I have traded great items that fit other people's builds for. I was one of the lucky ones and got a TSE Handmade a week and a half ago that finally let me see SBQs damage bar move. That's faster than most get them to drop. You can't go by the streamers who get handed anything they want and played when every Ghoul in whitesprings dropped a legendary. Most people can not put in that amount of time and would never see a decent weapon drop for their specific build without trading. That would make them get bored to death and make the player base even smaller. No one is going to chase a stick without a carrot for months on end. Without trading with current drop rates this game would die a rather quick death. With how important good gear is at max level lack of trading would likely make the game unplayable. If you don't believe me go grab a hunters hunting rifle and grind until you get a basic TS that fits your build.
---
That presumes that is the only conditions under which they would be used.  Obviously there are other conditions under which they could be used which could lead to the condition presumed.  
---
*Yawn*
---
And of course, imgur gives you hate. That's a pretty cool feature.
---
TWO POWERFISTS AHAHAH!
---
I don‚Äôt have pictures or anything but I have received a 1* armor drop once. 
---
They need guilds and the ability to join your guild's server. Can still be dynamic, would just be the first server where 2 or more of your peeps are logged in together with their workshop already built. 
---
Then you can make workshops have a much higher budget and larger radius.  Other guilds can raid your town based on a schedule your guild sets.  Like you can set it for an 8 hour period where most your members are active, and the opposing guild has to schedule it during that time.  the raiders would set which of their players will participate to dictate the size of the encounter (being no larger than defenders recent player list), then both sides fight with equal numbers for like an hour to determine whether the town changes hands.
---
Sort of modeled after City of heroes/villains raids, which if they had ever been done as advertised, would have been awesome.  I participated on one or two, and was still pretty cool.
---
Not really 
---
if you didn‚Äôt requisition the government supply drop why should you claim it ? 
---
Quick! Find me some bodyguards!
---
That's fair enough. I guess it would only really affect lower levels. Unless you hoard literally every piece of junk you find and sell it off, you won't really be able to max out every vendor you see while you're still in the forest. Although you won't have access to most of them yet by then. Idk, it's been a while since I was low level and haven't really made alts
---
Are you playing Fallout 76 right now?
---
But we need a business man to run the govment cause we be losing jobs.
---
Well I'm level 34 so the weapons I lost are.good now but won't be later on so no worries.
---
I found they disappear randonly when I salvage other weapons. And yes I'm sure I don't click on them. I had favorite and legend disappear when scrapping normal weapons...
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand how that big underground area wasn‚Äôt an event already 
---
Maybe the SBQ?
---
It's the same problem D2 had.  If folks can't grind for "uber" stuff they get bored and wander off, or turn forums into a toxic dump in D2 y1's case.
---
Your missing the point....
---
You're supposed to run, and have the feeling that beating that boss is what you're working up to. You'll be able to take one on once you build up a set of decent armor and a weapon that can deal minimum 75 dmg at a decent rate.
---
Nah I want to wield my Two opposing god roll POWERFISTS! Imagine punching with both of those lol
---
https://twitter.com/EBGamesAus/status/1087567659938574336?s=19
---
Considering the game costs ~15 bucks atm, it wouldn't surprise me at all.
---
Its OK, there is a giant spring to push it back.
---
Yes and loving it! Seems a little buggy but overall having a good time. 
---
Would be annoying if it went free since I paid 60 bucks. Would just mean they‚Äôre going to push micro transactions hard and I will get double charged üôÅ
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt expect that to be the hot button issue with this post.
---
This game, is not, going to file transfer protocol. Period.
---
I run lucky holes once a week for 400 ore. During that week I do basically what the poster below suggests. Just collect acid from enemies and workshops here and there. I also gather iron nodes from around the map. And you can buy acid at vendors sometimes. 
---
I smelt with super duper equipped and make ammo with it equipped too and can average 5k to 7k bullets for a weeks worth of game play. 
---
Nope I played last night.
---
I started looking at 26 and it never showed.
---
Since november there has been only two major patches and one minor hotfix patch, none of them being particularly significant. This is fundamentally the same game you last played. They might get there someday but the development on this seems glacial in speed,  so it might be many months or even years before things get into the state this game should have been in at launch. 
---
That is a brilliant analysis, that makes a lot of sense actually. 
---
thx! do i need to remove starched genes to get mutated again? and do i risk losing my current mutations?
---
What's your current amount of spoiled veggies?
---
Even at minus -4 int, I would take marsupial.  Even if it didn't have additional weight capacity to make it easier to play the real game (inventory management simulator), I would take marsupial.  You don't quite realize how significant extra jump is until you've tried it.  Trivialize melee mobs, easier getting around.  Minus int is not significant at this stage in the game.  
---
That all sounds great but how do I deal with the infinite load that happens everytime I enter the plant
---
Ah yes, this makes sense. Thanks. 
---
Although this begs the question: Why did I have no available spots for any new perk cards? More of a curiosity though, I don't really require an answer to that one. I assume, at this point, it's somehow user error.
---
Same 
---
I use 4 piece wood and an enclave scout chest, or a hazmat suit.    
---
Stealth is still one of the best armours - well, dmg mitigators.     
---
Perks like Dodgy / Blocker / Lone Wanderer / Serendipity are also really really good. 
---
For real it wasn't even a big move
---
I just happened to clip me killing all of them and even after it disappeared there was bodies I didn't kill

---
Huuuuur duuuuur. This is only the 15th time someone posted it on here, thanks for keeping on it Jura. Oh boy, some unsubstantiated claim about a store in AU. The smoooking guuuuuuuuun.
---
hurts to play it a bunch and get burned out now if they plan to make it actually good someday in the future. If he is happy waiting then keep waiting and actually play it when it's fun and functional (if it ever gets there) 
---
It actually is based on the armor. I completed the quests ages ago and both of them still mention my vault suit, because I'm wearing one
---
Lvl 125 player her. What are you storing? I have one character and my stash weight hovers around 400-500 pounds?
---
I have a similar story from another perspective. I was doing the whitespring thing with a couple guys I met in game. One guy is level 50, leveling up a second character, the other 2 are 125 and 150 (me). Some level 80 decides it's time to pick on the little level 50. It was a mistake.
---
We're all fully geared with exploding weapons and 200+ hours of play. Decent builds and experience together. This guy will not let it go. He's getting kills with his exploding shotgun, but he never gets all three of us. He just keeps hitting revenge. After about 15 minutes we're all sick of his crap, and just wanna go back to playing the game. I drop two orbital strikes in his base, and pop him in the head. He's still seeking revenge, except he repairs his base first.
---
It 3 floating stories, decontamination arch, metal walls, benches and decoration, water purifiers, the works. Right across the stream by the golf house. Convenient and expensive.
---
My other buddy swaps to his main character, level 130+. He equips wrecking ball, and goes to work with his tse minigun while this dude's fighting us, unsuccessfully. Respawns non-hostile, repairs his base, and my buddy says nope. 
---
He racked up an 1100 cap bounty destroying this guy's camp before the dude logged off. I did the only reasonable thing and helped myself to 1100 caps. My buddy's response? "Worth it!" No, I didn't give him back his caps. I used them to buy a calibrated t60 shock, and a plan of some sort. The other guy? Experience tells me he had several hours of material farming to do.
---
Agreed. I enjoyed using it on F4... would really make 76 more immersive.
---
Built my camp on a Lead deposit.  I snag 14 when I log in, and 14 when I log out... usually more than enough to cover my lead needs.
---
Even with well fed, well hydrated and vaccinated rad worms is just too darn contagious. If a ghoul so mutch as get a within a foot of me I contract them
---
? The decision to go F2P would be Bethesda's. They aren't saying it's not going F2P, just that they're going to continue selling it.
---
Same I got mine at level 16 and I have been to Harpers everyday since and haven‚Äôt seen it again and I‚Äôm level 44
---
Because a quest marker pops up saying "get the supply drop"
---
How do you find cover when three of them are on you and YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!
---
And make the switch operational, so that I don't have to add a switch to turn it off.
---
It may have something to do with a stack already about to spoil.  I made some mutt chops with a near spoiled CDN in my inventory, after a fast travel the entire stack spoiled.
---
Think he means gear to the floor at least.  For example someone trying to kill level 60 legendary stuff with a level 1 walking stick and  no perks vs decent level weapon and some appropriate perks.  Honestly outside of SB/SBQ and Col Gutsy swarms it takes very little to off something.
---
But isn't the reason that Prime is where it is because of the Glassed Cavern's Ultracite deposits?
---
Well, I logged off but wont log back on until later today.
---
Shhhhh don't say it out loud lol.
---
Are you melee?
---
RMT duper trash.
---
Is this your third or fourth account you created to sell duped stuff for money ?
---
I forgot what patches it was. The majority of testers said don‚Äôt release this. And when it went live 90% of servers were dead. I came back to the game a few years, and noticed the 33 jobs were dumbed down to 9 iconic. 
---
It was sad to go into a player town just to find it empty. 
---
That game had so much potential until a very piss poor decision was made. 
---
I fully agree.. 
---
I run an unarmed/rifle build and in nuke zones I feel kinda useless. (specifically in the SBQ fight) 
---
I run deep pocketed armor to make sure I have enough carry weight, so I can't use a Hazmat in a nuke zone or I have to do an entire inventory overhaul to do so. 
---
So I have to go with PA. I have x01 with calibrated shocks. Cool. I've got my carry weight down, but now I cant use my unarmed weapons and I don't own any super powerful legendary rifles to be really effective against the queen ( I could deal with a prime receiver but i'll ignore that for now.)  
---
I'm forced to switch to a two-handed build to do anything. 
---
And yeah, If fissure prime is nuked right you don't have to be in the nuke zone to fight her... but why do I have to rely on an exploit to be able to run my build? 
---
I get that PA should be stronger than regular armor in a lot of ways, but I really shouldn't feel useless for not using it just because I want to use a certain class of weapons.
---
They could be like events? Whoever kills all the raiders or causes the most ‚Äúdamage‚Äù win, but nothing gets lost?
---
[my thoughts](https://gph.is/1e0T1tY)
---
Made a trip to Lucky hole mine with the excavator armour and I ended up throwing 17 bulk of lead on the ground after making 7000 rounds via super duper.  Crazy.
---
There are also quest markers for other people‚Äôs defend workshops but a lot of people get all worked up when you go to help 
---
My new goal as of...yesterday, is to build a pvp set! If you're on xb1 I don't mind.
---
Also, dunno what level you are, but i have a TON of duplicate plans and recipes, and I think some 15 or 25 legendaries (again, if you're on xb1).
---
None and it shouldn‚Äôt spoil that fast. Where can I get data on spoil timer for different foods?
---
  ..... boogie boarding.... fucking hell, I haven't really laughed out loud at a comment in ages, bravo!
---
The Communist Whacker is always a fun one as well. 
---
I'd imagine that once duping is tamped out a bit and characters with 10^21 carry weight are locked down and cheaters are banned there will be some kind of upgrade.
---
Personally I'd like to see more varied containers than just a stash increase. Like let me build 6 power armor stands and store my PA for people to see.
---
A vault dweller has to humble brag.
---
A weapons case so that nice weapon that's 5 levels too high can be displayed.
---
A working fridge for my food so it lasts longer.
---
A dresser for my outfits. Never know when I want to put on that greaser jacket and jeans.
---
A medicine cabinet for my chems.
---
By getting things out of the stash that could be cooler to display elsewhere it would make stash effectively increased.
---
Also increase the building budget. I want my wasteland McMansion.
---
Or we can get immunity effects if we wait the whole time to get rid of a disease we should get a little resistance against that disease 
---
Marsupial, bird bones and speed demon gives a great h/v movement boost. feels borderlandish.
---
Could be like my situation.  I upgraded a perk card to level 2 that I thought I had equipped.  Turns out I did not, so I only had one point when I went to re-equip the rank 2 perk.  Which usually would be 2 points (cause it unequips the old perk).
---
You are right and I will admit that I occasionally put out reactionary comments. It‚Äôs something I need to work on. The game isn‚Äôt all bad but it is severely lacking in unique content. In the beginning of the game I felt like we were building towards something big and I am now left disappointed. I will continue to come back occasionally after updates but their is a serious need for content right now. 
---
I don't get why people need high power weapons there. Maybe my build is OP?
---
I can solo stand in the doorway at the golf club, with a 1* legendary melee weapon, and kill the entire swarm of glowing bloated ones. I always switch to a weak weapon in these zones so that others can get a hit, I literally stab everything once and then just stand there waiting for others to kill them. 
---
The golf club is like the original loot cave in Destiny 1. The loot sucks and it's not even fun or challenging..... it's a slot machine.
---
The rumor started because EB Games AUS was pulling 76 copies off shelves. So the idea was that the reason they pulled them is because 76 is going f2p. Now that we know that isn't the case, the copies being pulled isn't evidence for F2P anymore.
---
You misread my comment.  It's not you ruining the game; it's the bobblehead dupers who steal SBQ kills
---
The problem is over half the time they are bugged and fire at a way too high rate, youre missing the OPs point
---
Western Outfit and Chaps can drop from "buried with honor" while the regular Western Outfit can drop from "Big Game Hunter"
---
Ok, manchild, talking to you is as pointless and unproductive as playing your favourite game. Have a great day.
---
I jump and do that all the time. Got bountied for damaging part of the base...
---
There are certain items I've found that I never use in game play. Things like cork and crystal, fiberglass or silver etc. 
---
I also have white knight maxed as well as other perks to make guns and weapons break slower.  So that helps tremendously with needing materials. 
---
Wood I never keep more than a handful of for cooking because it's so so abundant. 
---
Ceramic, well that's everywhere so if I ever need it I can make a run thru somewhere to grab a few pieces. 
---
I'd say it depends on the perks you have for repairing, if you're finished your camp building, and what you invest into ammo creation. 
---
I have a farm at my camp, so I can quickly pop out about ten adhesives every time I log in if I need to. 
---
I'd suggest if you're pretty set in your build at this point, make a note of any items you use for repairing your specific armor or favorite weapons, and stick to keeping about 30 to 40 of those but some scrap you will find you just never ever use. Or it can be very easily grabbed fast. 
---
I was short 2 plastic repairing a gun the other day, quick run of flatwoods and I had everything I needed. So if it can take me 3 minutes to run through and grab I wont waste stash space with it. 
---
But "Uber" stuff exists.. It's just rare, as intended.... Kill 1000 legendaries and you're bound to get a God roll in there somewhere. Or, sell the 1000 crappy ones and BUY a God roll off somebody else....
---
Ahh so adding 100 fresh soups to 1 about to spoil soup, they all take on the almost spoiled soups condition? But I might see a few spoiled veggies never a stack of a large amount of spoiled veggies. 
---
As much as I try to manage it, it's been a long time since my stash was under 500 pounds.  And to some extent, I'm not even sure why it's that high.  Because Sort by WT goes by individual units, not the total weight of bundles, it can be difficult to hunt down the biggest offenders.
---
They are very clearly bugged, the rapid fire doesnt always happen and it looks obviously glitched when it does
---
Good talk, little Timmy!
---
Try not to get so butthurt about a videogame in the future!
---
I pull plenty of legendary gear from events in the Savage divide and cranberry bog. I don't know what you're talking about.
---
There‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre getting downvoted to oblivion by the way. You‚Äôre being ridiculous. I know you said you‚Äôre not going to ‚Äúlet me troll you‚Äù but that‚Äôs really not the case. Trying to explain to you that you‚Äôre way overreacting to something that you are taking the wrong way. If it really sets you off that much to think about it I‚Äôd suggest trying to find out why that is and talk to someone about it. 
---
Some of them headed to DC already as well. 
---
Not to mention this also capitalizes on the bug where martial artist increases the RoF drastically on the gatling gun which is bound to get addressed at some point. So the OP is doing significantly more dps than the gun is intended for while also being in a perfect scenario. While it's a neat vid, Im not sure it establishes a new meta.
---
Well said.
---
Man I wish you could link your FO account to this site so you can play with what cards you currently have and try different things with out doing it in game.
---
I do agree that the stash limit should be over 600. But it's not horrible. 
---
First, armor and weapons are level locked. So how much you are trying to load off on your alts I don't know why. Which to me it sounds like you are really using your alts as mules. For whatever reason.
---
And that's always the bottom reason why people want ways some kind of shared inventory between characters. To get around the stash limit. 
---
It's part survival game. And in that kind of game, you have limits, because that's part of what a survival game is about. Making choices about resources. The game was clear about that before anyone bought it. 
---
Thus the difference between a role player and a griefer. But you're hung up on tse so there's not much point. I personally run around with a junkies set, junkies m79, gamma gun, and pump shotgun. Get all the addictions (like a raider) find a camp; "toss the place" looking for more chems, and get into a fight with the owner, or go looking elsewhere looking for a fix. 
---
Bounty washing from friends is gonna get nerfed, i would bet atoms. 
---
It never will, stop making these posts
---
this is just another idiotic, unfounded rumor to stir up controversy. it would be such a bad look for them to go F2P right now. it's also extremely unlikely seeing as they would not be able to continue updating the game and adding content by being funded by atom sales alone. this shit shouldn't even be given the time of day on this sub tbh.
---
Maybe Wooby is just where he wants to be?
---

---
Breach and Clear event gives a ton of lead and steel after smelting, and smaller amounts of the other ore types. 
---
The amount of people in here not admitting an obvious bug is hilarious. You people would defend this game fucking your wife
---
Do you mean lake Eloise? The one with the fissure site right beside it?
---
Great points.
---
(I have never had Escape Artist work as described on the perk.)
---
I would like to add that lockpicking takes you out of stealth, which makes absolutely no sense.  (Lockpicking not only is an inherently stealthy activity, but you need to crouch down to see the door handle....)
---
All great ideas. Collecting is one of my favorite things to do.
---
No, the most frustrating were when I've lost X-01 jetpack and 2x Calib.shocks mods destroyed during crafting stuff in my camp. It is broken game mechanic, not people...
---
Think of it like this. The story so far is a single-player Fallout plot minus the player so...
---
How in the flying fuck did race get brought into this
---
You guys need to stop.
---
What store? I haven‚Äôt see that 
---
Doh! What have I started?
---
Some people are just broken. 
---
Nah, it's not a cheat. Both the chameleon mutation &amp; chameleon armors can render you invisible. *working as intended*
---
I know I hold onto magazines and bobbleheads in the vain belief that I'll get to display them one day.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get all the plans and looking for the perfect spot to build an awesome camp. Spent the whole game with just a bare bones camp now I plan on spending the next bit working on it. 
---
Hah, if just from the mouth....
---
Depends on the country i guess.
---
It's Charlie, in coming to get you. Just you wait old man, your days are numbered.

And I'm going to dance on your lawn as I watch you bleed out..
---
There‚Äôs a punch of paint on the roof of west tek too, an artist left it up there ‚Äî it‚Äôs a good place to farm lead... may need marsupial to get to it though.
---
Cuz DLC
---
Yes, and I even said We many times in my first reply. 
---
Sometimes you can't see much when they are right up in your face, so you have to move away. 
---
And that's risky, but hey, that's the game. 
---
More like 30th account. You mad, bum?
---
Nope I play a rifle mutation build.
---
If you want to get mutated, take off Starched Genes. Put it back on when you‚Äôre done and want to get rid of your rads 
---
We'll see. I also think that going F2P now would be a bad idea - people would be angry. But in half a year? Sure. The playerbase has been steadily going down and down, and the F2P route would be a good solution to salvage something.
---
with no story I'd say
---
Exactly. This isn't WoW where you stand there toe to toe spamming your attacks and abilities. 
---
I love these and have one favorited.  If you block with it, it looks like you are waving it on the protest line.
---
Fair enough. But based on every real world metric for a video game's quality and success, I'd say that Fallout 76 is an unmitigated train wreck. Lol
---
All I want is a good consistent food solution lol. I have water handled. 
---
not really
---
hell the site the rumor mill linked to claimed amazon only had 28 copy which is a lie on its face.  the store whose actions sparked this rumor saying they still sell the game isnt going to change their minds. they want the game to fail and will keep telling lies about it.
---
Not the same person you're arguing with, but I have moderate PTSD and an old friend of mine killed herself from a much more severe one. I don't find this post offensive. I was a bit confused at first as to whether it was a joke or story, but I definitely think OP did a good job writing it out. 
---
Another grey market advert. Avoid.
---
From conception to completion? I was given a lot of leeway and started off with a raised multistory building that I'd planned to have looking like it was built on raised metal pillars. They nixed it half way through for a house on the ground design.
---
The first day went pretty quickly. Got most of the work done then. The second day required a lot of help from the owner to delete things since I no longer had the privilege to do so, and they were busy often selling things to other users. Between that, two disconnects, and getting the letters to be as flat as possible, it took a bit of time to complete. 
---
And a lot of time can be eaten up laying conduits. You don't see it, but there are a lot of conduits hidden in the walls. You have to get everything zeroed perfectly from the source, not along the way, if you want them inside the walls. 
---
Agreed. Also I wish that the level of the gear better corresponds with the enemy that dropped it. I'm lvl 90 and I'm taking out Rank 68 3 star Super Mutants, and when I do finally get a 3 star legendary, it's level 30.
---
Not really, just feel sorry for degenerates who actually bought stuff from you
---
You have to revisit the silos after a non-fissure nuke drop. The final holotape is randomly added to one of the three sites' overseer's cache, I believe.
---
A-assume the position..?
---
I always feel kinda bad for these people. They probably wanted to play really bad.
---
Yesterday, got him to spawn by Charleston train station while I was looking for the special vendorbot.

I like him.

There are so many outlandish stories here that the satirical ones tend to get lost sometimes. 
---
I've found the red asylum worker outfit inside fort defiance before.
---
Fun when they dig down and disappear but the combat music doesn't stop and sneak-o-meter still says [Danger]. Five minutes later when I'm really frustrated by not being able to fast travel, finally it suddenly pops up right behind me.
---
Radscorpions are surprisingly rare in this game, luckily.
---
Why? He can do fuck all to you.
---
It actually a legit online store im my country. Im not linking anything nor i plan too. Just making a point on how bad f76 is based on the price fall
---
The crew I play with is split up into roles.  I'm responsible for crafting and repairing.  So I store and use quite a bit of junk.  The rest is stuff to play with builds.  My SPECIAL is 12-12-3-4-14-8-3.  This lets me play with various ranged builds.  I avoid energy weapons (until they make them useful).  My primary load out is a Gauss Rifle for sniping and handmade for wetwork.  However, given my SPECIAL, I'm well allocated to do a heavy weapons or heavy melee build as well as a tanking build.  The problem is that storing various power armor combos and heavy weapons combos fills up the stash quickly.
---
On my main, I have about 400/600 junk, 75/600 Miscellaneous (Black Powder), 15-25/600 Aid (depending on what I've crafted for everybody).  With that last 100, I have to only put the most likely weapons and armor for my alternate builds in the stash.  Everything over that, I shift to alts or carry.  Passing stuff to alts is very time consuming, and being over encumbered all the time is very not fun.
---
I was thinking about helping people who's on the mission to launch a nuke. You can see players at launch site on the map. If you can ask to join to help, that'll be great.
---
Well you removed  the part about buying gear from e-bay so clearly I hit the point right between the eyes. You'd think in your 40 years of gaming you might have l2p at some point.
---
Some in world loot (not in boxes) will not respawn until you loot a specific number (either 60 or 180) OTHER spawns. So farming just 1 spot does not work.
---
you should tel lthat to cancer patients
---
I would scarf down spoiled food like no tomorrow
---
You're describing my setup for Fallout 4 and Skyrim.  I whole heartedly agree with this suggestion.  I'd love to be able categorize what I keep, but first I need to be able to keep more.
---
I thought most of the way people escaped the map in the single player games was noclip, since bethesda tends to just puts a big "you cant got here" square around the map.
---
You can't even name one reason as to why someone would destroy a camp.
---
That's because that's all you want to see. That's fine. For a game like this to survive this period, they have to budget for such possiblities. They may not be expecting any profit from this game for 1-2 years. And before you say no company would do that. Amazon and Apple did. 
---
F2p is the rumor flavor for this week huh? 
---
Is it a bug though... Or is it intended to be hard and you simply have trouble playing a non-god roll character and actually facing a challenge that you may or may not be able to overcome if you actually put forth some effort? I personally see nothing wrong with scorchbeasts, beyond their less than end game mob lvl drops. Then again, maybe I'm just better than you.   ;-)
---
The user provided the materials. I probably did use some of mine, but nothing compared to what they provided. There's a good chance I have about 90% of crafting items unlocked. I'll probably use the payment to buy the last things I need. 
---
Corn Soup can take care of both.
---
And actually, the Good Doggy perk makes Canned Dog Food about as nourishing to your food bar as a Stimpack is to your HP (and it does that too).
---
I alternate between the two.  When I have plenty of dog food, I'll use that.  When I'm low on it, I'll make Corn Soup.
---
Wait at least two weeks, could be possible to be a "Free to play" game.

I have started picking up bags at the big events for the 1 and 2 star junk folks are throwing away. Had a 3 star glowing fat Albert drop a standard 50 Cal, ouch. 
---
I think frequency of legendary was buffed but quaility took a huge Nerf.
---
Good thoughts, agreed!
---
All i can say is im still playing after 400 hrs....way more than ANY other game ive played. 
---
Maybe we are a minority of people in the game world that find this game addictive due to personality issues, but if you really dive into it and try everything...it just works.  if ppl. want to down-vote me, go ahead.  other games simply end! this one keeps offering new ideas that change the way i play. it has something for everyone.
---
Its surviving..plain and simple...on your own or with others. just like life.  I'll have bad days and good days, and exciting moments, and depressing moments.
---
I also agree that people are the best and worst part of it; however, I've been really lucky finding awesome people as i wander the wasteland on my self-created missions.
---
Men may cry "Plans! Plans!"  But there are no plans.
---
So you basically have a butt sore over something and rather than talk about the post, you just go around posting about how you lost something? 
---
Something I've seen posted about SO much here, I can't believe people when it still happens. I mean if anyone know that your mods can get scrapped by accident, and you don't take a few minutes to make sure that won't happen? Ok, whatever.
---
Basically someone said something nice about something you are mad at, so you felt the need to poop on the parade. I bet you also want to be taken seriously after that tantrum?
---
Nah, it‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs not done the same way as [single player Fallout]. /s
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs said that some people don‚Äôt seem to understand that the story and it‚Äôs telling for the context and themes of the game extremely well. I guess calling it Fallout rather than Bioshock ruins this style of storytelling for some people who can‚Äôt escape their own expectations. 
---
They work and drop fine once you figure out how the sequence works. Ill explain as best I can, how the unending sonic scream happens and how to avoid it.
---
I use t-60 PA to fight them, saves on stimpaks, the dense + padded mods on armor also reduce the damage.
---
The easiest way to cripple them and get them to land is a shotgun + the enforcer perk. The explosive modifier helps to max out the range on your shotgun.
---
Now before you start to cripple them, you need to find a large clear area, I look for an area 1.5 to 2.5 times the size of the ScorchBeast with little to no tree's, rocky outcroppings, trenches or ground clutter. If you watch them land a few times you start to understand they need a ton of room to land, and they often do a little run when they land.
---
When crippling I aim for where the wing attaches to body, on the arm part not the sail part of the wing. The odd time I also manage to disable the screech aswell as the wing, which is done by hitting between the neck/stomach.
---
Once the wing is crippled, it does not fall out of the sky or automatically land. It first LOOKS for a place to land which takes less than a 1/2 second and if no place to land is found it goes into 2-3 wave sonic attack, than checks again for a landing spot (&lt;1/2second) if one is not found again it goes right back into another 2-3 wave sonic attack and it will keep doing this pattern until either a landing spot is found or the wing is no longer crippled, which means unending sonic spam until you die or it lands.
---
So my advice is to PA up, move out of cover into open area's, tree's + sidestepping and marsupial will allow you to dodge some incoming damage.
---
Avoid using weapons with the stagger perk while the SB is in the air, the stagger overwrites the landing sequence so if your continually staggering it wont ever land til its dead.
---
If you near an AA site use and abuse that bad boy to wreck a SB in the air.
---
Hope this helps somebody, and if you have questions feel free to comment.
---
Source: Another Redditor, I wish I remembered their name, found the sequence after studying the SB's. I daily put their theory into action at the "Line in the Sand" event and my camp is near two fissure sites so I generally kill 4-10 SB's per playtime.
---
4-10 shotgun shells to drop the beast and than I whack it to death with the black diamond. The only time I burn stimpaks is if all the SB's friends decide to come help him.
---
ok instead of linking you could say the name of the store. otherwise people will just think you are making things up.
---
I removed it because it's not the topic of discussion, you want to talk about dupes and what not then start your own post.  
---
So now you arent playing fallout anymore... Sounds more like the Sims
---
country roads
---
Everybody back in the pile!
---
Seems like some loot is tied to your character. You need to loot 60 or 180 other lots before they respawn.
---
In my country, on Amazon, the console versions are going around at about 70% off, while the PC version sells at full price, always, with slight offers that are equivalent to a price drop of about a dollar.
---
This could be related to the fact that consoles games sales are much less in my country compared to PC games.
---
Yeah, I agree. It makes the interior photos pop more, but really doesn't do the exterior justice. I'll take new exterior photos later and replace the album. I'll let you know when I do so. 
---
Oh, I've never used no clipping, just the old fashioned way. The map walls in BGS games seem to be individually placed, with some small gaps missing.
---
I wasn't exactly *unsurprised* that this wasn't the case, but as I made my way into the Glassed Cavern I was *really, really* hoping to come out on a ledge overlooking an utterly massive underground cavern filled with Scorchbeasts hanging from the ceiling, flying in swarms around pillars of rock, crawling in and out of narrow tunnels in the ceiling, etc.
---
Im on pc. Ah, i see hear what you are saying, more info may have helped. I wasnt trying to bash the game at all. Im loving it. Have over 400 hours in it so far. I hope to keep logging hours. Yes all drivers are up to date. I didnt know anyone would care on here about my specs. What all should i put? Gpu/cpu, anything else? 
---
This is my first online game since cod big red one on ps2, and first time having issues with a game that weren't caused by something ive done like mods conflicting or something. I have used no mods in 76 by the way. I was just hoping someone might have a suggestion or something. you and one other guy said to do a file check or reinstall. Im going to try that. Hope it helps. 
---
I never figured me submitting a ticket to bethesda would really help much. Im sure they have alot of them already that would say pretty much the same thing "stability issues". 
---
It started with an issue walking around in Charleston. I just kinda avoided it. Seemed ok everywhere else. Now i cant hardly walk around watoga without a ctd. And its starting to occur randomly everywhere else now. Sometimes with me standing, sometimes walking, running and gunning. Doesnt seem to be any one thing or one place. Since the last patch I now average 3-6 ctd an hour. I cant attend nuke zones. I will crash sure thing before the scorched beast queen dies. Whitesprings nuke zone isnt any better. Lately i even try to avoid servers with nuke zones. 
---
If you ever have the misfortune of playing with me during that event you‚Äôll hear me singing it lol so I definitely approve of this idea!
---
The order must be wrong. That sounds like the stage. 
---
F2P means there is no monthly subscription anymore.  When did the meaning of this word change? Lol
---
oooo VERY good call brother, I totally forgot about that event!  
---
Befor i watched the video, i knew its gonna be the Gattling, even without legendary effect it shreds everything.
---
It is very clearly a bug, their dragonshouttimer is set to 0. They can fire off almost a dozen in under 2 seconds and continue shooting non stop while flying very far away, it looks hilarious because it is not intended. Not every scorch beast does it either. You're an idiot if you think something that so blatantly ruins the enemy is intended. They arent hard even when they are bugged, this is the easiest game ive ever played
---
i get a weird sound from headset then loads the black screen 
---
It would seem to me that atom sales are the only revenue being generated by this game anyway. I don't think the reason Bethesda heavily slashed the price of the game shortly after launch was because it was flying of the shelves. 
---
There is a bunch of paint and lead batteries in Treetops as well :-)  Thanks for sharing!
---
I think it's an unmarked location above that. North of spruce knob for sure
---
The problem is that no other weapon is powerful enough to make a difference when it comes to endgame enemies. I would have no problem if the others were sufficient but they are not. Try to fight a swarm of glowing ghouls &gt; 50 with a standard non-melee weapon. Not a chance. 
---
It‚Äôs a different story as soon as you use a melee build. With my second small level 51 char I can one shot them. Easily. And I do not even have to fear the explosion in close combat like a do with the current TSE. Do you call that balance?
---
So you get a 20 cap bounty for stealing a drop that's probably worth 100 caps at a vendor?
---
Even better you steal someone's drop and then have your buddy kill you and claim the bounty.
---
I've got 30+ drops and don't want to PvP. Ever since the update I have zero interest in claiming them. It's bad enough I have to wait forever In between requests but now I need to worry about trolls stealing the loot before I get there.
---
Add supply drops to the list of game mechanics broken by PvP.
---
Aren't you going to need a lot of acid to break that or down?
---
Fort Defiance is a good place to find Ballistic Fiber if you can find Mothmen about they too drop Ballistic Fiber. Also check any and all military sites, and APC‚Äôs you‚Äôll usually find bags or military duct tape too. Also if you don‚Äôt wear power armor White Knight ( I believe ) the perk that makes repairing and the armor lasting 90% longer is a great perk, which helps with farming, in a sense that it won‚Äôt require 3-5 for fibers, but 1-2 maybe which will help towards farming and those small numbers add up over a few hours of game play. 
---
I do silo‚Äôs and get many of my lead from bots, and I got a lead deposit near my camp, and the munitions dispenser is a great thing to have ( if you are on the server long enough to reap the benefits) 
---
I think each fissure should be able to spawn a unique boss or maybe one of multiple unique bosses.  I like where the OP's head is, but moving site prime would actually be a little damaging to the RP of it.  Plus, all it would do is shift around the queen.  Give us more than the queen and some variability.  Then we have to really think about what we nuke.
---
But I thought Fallout 76 had the nicest community ever!
---
Yesterday on ps4 near Charleston train station. Last week on PC near Gorge Junkyard.
---
 Cant even lie. If i could make 50 bucks on ebay to get my money back off this game i would
---
What about Brahmins stuck through walls half sitting on a shitter?
---
I can get behind that. As the highest level player in my group I usually do all repairs and upgrades.  But gun powder is so easy to make I don't store any. Aid I feel sucks the most inventory space up. Junk wise I try to keep 100 of each item and if I run low the others who need repair need to pitch in. 
---
Yes they have. There is/was (I ain't getting banned lol) an .ini tweak that would let you leave the borders. You can go pretty dang far past where the game lets you but there are no items of interest or resources. At the actual map edge the screen freezes and you will have to fast travel to get back.
---
Fallout 76......the pay to win version.
---
Everyone who posts this should be banned. 
---
Combat rifle with limb damage? Hell yeah. I'll take that off your hands if you're not running a rifle build.
---
Ive got a vampire mr hand buzz saw, feels underwhelming and is best used for trivial forest content
---
I feel like this is too much work for Bethesda, they can get more ROI with a new skin on the atom store
---
I just bought the game yesterday and it was like $50
---
some people like classical or Jazz or Rock etc...this game doesn't hit the right notes for you...thats cool.
---
It does work me..even through the bugs and glitches...I see so much potential here.
---
I‚Äôm actually sitting on that mission. Waiting until I find the right server with decent level dudes as I play alone (not necessarily by choice but 76 got a lot of bad press and turned off my buddies) as I know a portion of them will show up to farm. 
---
Yeah, one way I found was if I fast traveled to my camp, which was near a cliff, it would sometimes just drop me off the map and I would continuously fall through for an infinite amount of time till I moved my character around and then I would land normally. 
---
Have fun then. savage divide might be your best bet with all the uneven ground cover (more so than the rest)
---
I idea this like really.
---
Wow, so many downvotes for posting a shocking fact
---
The more concrete info bethesda has, the easier they can locate the problem. And i'd bet my arse most people keep these to themselves, or only share on non official forums like reddit, which leaves the developer to their own devices to find out the problem in the first place.
---
Your specs might help bethesda out. Also, for some potentially more useful info; back then i heard certain modded armor pieces caused CTD issues for a lot of players; in that case i think it was a specific kind of power armor helmet mod. 
---
Maybe try unequipping everything?
---
Glad you like it, its awesome!
---
Broken, buggy and a right mess atm but still its fall out online.
---
Hopefully in the future you wont let other peoples negativity and opinions stop you from trying things for yourself, as you've seen for yourself it is ok to have your own opinions and make your own mind up about things you are curious about.
---
Wonder how many other games or things in life you've missed out on because someone on you tube told you to not do it :/
---
Just remember, just because you've realised that the game is quite fun, please don't take all the hate for Bethesda on this sub personally. Bethesda sold there customers who pre ordered and paid full price a broken product and are still not moving fast enough to get it fixed for there loyal customers.
---
okay then we played a different game. B4 tse i didn‚Äôt even make a dent with the SQB. Now I do. Until the patch 
---
Stop spreading this bullshit.
---
Thanks for the routes!  I do need to stock up on ballistic fiber after making a new set of armor.
---
You got my favorite location for can chimes to get lead and steel, the Eastern Penitentiary.   Between those chimes, picking up dropped weapons, Ammosmith, and a tinker's bench in the prison yard that keeps me in 5.56 while I do my 30th Patrol Duty run hoping for handmade plans.  :)
---
And of course, the map markers only start showing up properly after you've reached that point. Or have bugged pipes that you can hear the hissing leaks, but don't show up as damaged or interactable.
---
so you're a liar perpetuating rumors based on nothing?
---
Armor just refers to damage resistance, not literal armor.
---
BTW: the train (wreck) yard by Watoga is a good place to farm 3\*s.
---
Once you learn how to aim the Harpoon gun its a lot of fun. I haven't played around with any of the medic stuff either. None of Fallout friends game on PC and all my PC friends who like multiplayer games are playing Grim Dawn, Path of Exile or Starcraft 2, can't get one of them to even try 76 so I have just been Lone Wandering it.  
---
I tried really hard to do a no fast travel character but I always end up getting frustrated at some point and doing it, I  do fast travel as little as possible though.  
---
You should definitely try a pipe gun specialist they are pretty interesting, That's what my railway rifle sniper started as, I just love the railway rifle so much that when I started playing around with it I ended up abandoning most other weapons. He keeps off weapon is a semi auto pipe pistol though.
---
I don‚Äôt find much dog food any more. Hate to use a point on the perk. Corn soup would have the same spoil problem. I want to put 500 soups in my stash and forget about it. 
---
I too can fire off a dozen shots in under 2 seconds. I wasn't aware you were a PM for BGS. Maybe you should assign points to this "bug" as this was not a "by design" choice.   Glad your can go from complaining something is too difficult, to compensating and saying it's the easiest game ever. It's ok buttercup, your ego will be ok.. Even if you aren't the best.  Making something easy, easier doesn't make for a better game.. It makes for a participation trophy experience. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure some people have started to attack bases BECAUSE everyone started complaining...
---
People need to farm lead? I have like 200 and had to start dumping it cuz of weight. I get so much from robots. As for ballistic fibre I just go to a military location (camp venture ect) and grab a bag or 2 from there then use white Knight
---
Stop crying. TSE, melee, stealth sniper, crits... there are like 8 builds that literally one shot everything except the SBQ so don't come with this bs and Bethesda knows it. The real problem for me is that with TSE you donthave to aim. You literally shoot the floor 3 times and you can kill all the Whitespring ghouls and that's the problem. So literally stop crying and git gud
---
The  CE-34878-0 error looks like a common issue with FO76   
---
No let's stay here and talk about how you feel you didn't get value for money from the gear you bought. I mean if you're spending real cash for items they should be the best right?
---
This!
---
I was so annoyed that I only had one tech data after raiding AMS HQ, where I picked up multiple.
---
Game needs an epilepsy warning at times.
---
No story? Realy? Are you blind or have you never played the game? Scorched? Scorchbeasts? The brotherhood tried to stop them? no? not a story? okay, must have played a different game then.
---
Captain, my captain. That is good news! 
---
You can get thousands of lead from Lucky hole in 1 run.
---
I'm on my 3rd level 50+, and sometimes I get something that's great but not that useful on that specific character. For example, if I get a Legendary energy weapon on my melee character it's useless. Can't keep it to collect a card/armor set for it because it's extremely heavy, so it becomes garbage(not even scrap-able garbage). As for managing resources and all that. Yea, sorry not buying it. Every Fallout is a "survival game", that's what Fallout is about. This just adds the new survival system they added to Fallout 4 and removes the limitless stash. It's incredibly annoying and probably takes a good 2 points off of the game on a 1-10 scale.
---
Remember it's a game. "incredibly annoying" should probably be the last thing you want to hear about any game mechanic. It's so annoying it feels like a chore.
---
Load times on PS4... could happen to anyone. Bless em.
---
i build mine similar to this on the north end of the pond at "site alpha". did there because its a sentral location on the map
---
Aye, ive seen it twice: when you need to claim a workshop and I think it was verdant season
---
Id be happier if the frequency of diseased monsters and/or the chance to contact a disease were reduced. It's annoying as fuck when a diseased ghoul gets one hit in and inflicts parasites.
---
The super mutants already figured this out.  Some of them have shields.... granted it's just exaggerated forearm armor, but it looks like a shield.
---
Sorry, me being dumb! 
---
I'm torn on this, it should have just been removed (the dev room)
---
That way Beth wouldn't have had to waste time and resources trying to get it under control and working out how to ban people etc.
---
The time could have been spent on fixing the most glaringly annoying bugs and stuff but nope almost 3 months on and there still having to try an get duping under control :/
---
You have provided no verification of your statements.

This, I like idea really

Pull this one out now and then to run around Flatwoods
---
Fallout clone wars

More than 90 ore, I think I walked out with close to 200 last time. 
---
Good job, soldier!

Gen. Dawson
---
This is the only quest left in my pip boy.
---
&gt; I too can fire off a dozen shots in under 2 seconds.
---
With a minigun, sure.  You aren't a flying bat with a sonar attack that looks hilarious coming out at 360 SPM from impossible angles either.  You can fight several of them and clearly tell when one is bugged.  They don't really do any damage, and the bugged ones stick out like a sore thumb.  I've probably killed over 500 on 3 different builds and at no point were any of them difficult because the game is designed to be incredibly easy if you build towards being good at all
---
I think they should have to finish the claim process by keeping the defenders dead in that area for long enough, much like it is now.  I think stuff should be lost, it doesn't cost that much to repair. I want cities to change hands, people to only build on these spots if they are confident they can get a group together to defend.  If there are no stakes, I think it would just be too common for every workshop to be someone's city.
---
You mean you feel sorry for degenerates that can't afford stuff in life. Not sure what negative IQ it takes to come up with your logic.
---
Do you have any 5 mm ammo?
---
Honestly? I don‚Äôt even request drops that often, there isn‚Äôt much in them worth having for me. 
---
I used to do that with the silver seed in Ultima Underworld, mostly to get past locked doors lol.
---
Not my point but ok...
---
That's because it's a repeatable quest. Like a daily. 
---
What impressed you about Tenderizer?  Is it better than described?  (I haven't used it yet.)
---
Or just buy them from someone. I sell the plans for 1500.
---
That is a separate problem. And as someone whose luck with legendaries is the worst, I have fought and killed those enemies with no TSE. It just takes more ammo. But if enemies overall are overtuned, complain about that, *not* losing the crutch you used to get around it.
---
Melee is one thing, TSE is another. You can‚Äôt balance by comparing one overpowered thing to another. If you think melee is OP, make a post about it. But don‚Äôt try to justify your argument against removing TSE by pointing at something else and saying ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs OP too!‚Äù cause that doesn‚Äôt actually explain why either shouldn‚Äôt be balanced.
---
As long as it's a non-pvp safe zone. 
---
Sentinel+assassins armor doesn't matter unless you engage in pvp with them. It's not gonna make them kill you any easier. Pacifist mode was ever supposed to make you invulnerable to pvp. Bethesda has made it clear from the beginning that you can take pvp damage no matter what. If someone is hitting you with chip damage, then get away from them. If you run around encumbered part of the price you pay is not being able to flee "raiders". 
---
Working as Todd intended then?
---
;)
---
I do as a matter of fact...... I have it on all my power armors. I will try to play it this evening without it on any of them. I haven't really payed attention to the ratio of problems in/out of power armor. But i do run around alot without power armor on. Could the targeting hud still cause issues while the armors are stored in my stash box or personal inventory? Or while not being worn?
---
No where did I say I didn't get "value" for items I bought.  I'm not replying to your rant anymore, your butt hurt for some reason and I'm not the person you need to be complaining to about it, I could care less about your perspective about buying items off ebay or using dupes, nor can I change it.  Your discussion is ZERO added value to the point of the topic.  Have a nice day Sir, I hope your next cup of coffee helps remove the stick from your 4th point of contact.   
---
You do yes, but normally picking up the items that breakdown into acid (Wendigo teeth, probiscus/glands off bugs) and the raw acid off certain mobs (Yaoi Guai, Flatwoods monster, Snallygaster) are enough to sustain a once a week jaunt into the mines without too much trouble.  If you tag acid you can get additional from looting the boxes of cleaner as well.  If you are using more than what you can sustain from normal play then you either spend a little time doing dedicated active farming of the above mobs or get a passive acid farm going to combine the two.
---
In 120 hours of play I've had two players attack me over and over again, one when I was level 7 and once after I was a high level. The first time I server hopped and the second I took an occasional stimpak until he got bored and left. Never had my camp destroyed by another player. I always wave and people wave back. 
---
But I am tired of reading "I'm a raider!" posts where people write essays attempting to justify actions that other people have endlessly complained about, both here and at Beth's site. This game has a hunter/hunted mode (the fact that no one seems to use it should tell you how popular PvP is with FO buyers), quests, events, teams, locations, bounties, camps, treasure hunting, and more, but some people can't stop bothering others, despite all the evidence on the boards telling them flat out people don't like it. 
---
Just, don't be a jerk. It's not difficult.
---
Where are you getting your numbers saying the player base has been steadily going down? I don't know if that's the case or not, but I would be curious to see the numbers. Can your provide a source?
---
Three wood scraps and some adhesive will sort that problem out.
---
ok, do you have anything productive or is it just insults?
---
Double the pleasure, double the fun. 
---
Yup, dat been dope af
---
Playerbase is picking up, sorry you want people to abandon the game. I think more people are mad Bethesda is choosing to support the game rather than discontinuing it or putting it on a back burner
---
I think the loudest issues come from people who are more intune with single player games, coming to a game that has always been single player, and now having to deal with several big changes.
---
The first being, it's part survival game, and as such, there are game consideration and mechanics they aren't used to dealing with, that quickly become annoying to them. Namely resource management. But if you understand that from the beginning, it doesn't become a problem or a headache. You simply learn what's valuable and what's not to you. I'm always surprised at the people who complain about finding certain things. They will claim they spent 3 hours server hopping, farming 2-3 locations and only got 25-35 of the item they need. And yet, I can do a 15-20 minute junk run and get that or more. 
---
If you want to play a game where you just toss it all in the inventory and then grab what you need, this isn't the game for that, and they were very clear upfront about that. 
---
If a person is just into best gear, kill everything quickly, they aren't going to like this game that much. To much about it has nothing to do with that. They always come back with the same reply. I paid for this game, it should be the kind of game I want to play.
---
No that's not logical thinking, that entitlement. It's like being mad a seafood restaurants menu is 80% seafood and 20% non seafood. 
---
It just means this isn't the game for you. But so many gamers think that they are the core audience of all game companies, and as such, they should be listened to, and catered to.
---
That may have been the case at one time, before gaming became more mainstream. But not anymore. More people enjoy playing video games that aren't hardcore gamers that eat through games in days or weeks. 
---
The game has a lot of work to do. And it's clear that Bethesda is committing to that work, though they are being guarded about it. it's understandable to a point. 
---
You know what'd be great too? Preventative care. Let me get vaccinations for diseases. Make it fun quests. Some materials to farm. Some rare materials. Something or other. Or something that makes me super resistant to disease for 2 hours for a food the way other food boosts stats and xp and such. 
---
All great points!  Thank you for sharing!
---
I haven't tried a strict no legendary build yet. I do try to keep perk swapping to a minimum though. I have been doing: can only perk swap once per session, can only do so in my camp or the overseer's camp, must drop 1 water, 1 food item, 2 stims and 50 ammo as payment per perk swapped.
---
Did you post in the discord a few times yesterday?
---
I love my chameleon armor, except that when ads, your weapon reticule also goes invisible, so it's not w/o it's drawbacks. (I really wish they'd fix that)
---
I want to use them so I can hopefully get a modded radium rifle, or hopefully a few, to break down for mods on my legendary radium rifle.
---
will do. I don‚Äôt think I like the playstyle though
---
OMG you have artillery? Where did you ever get the plans for the cannons? I can't ever seem to find them. Would love to see pics of the camp sometime, sounds very detailed.
---
Camp raids are a feature though...
---
I look at these and wonder what new side product scandal is going to erupt. As every other outside game product tied to this game has controversy attached to it. /s?
---
Many companies intend on operating at a loss for various reasons. Personally I don't think Bethesda or Zenimax care about making a profit from this game. I think of it as more of a development tool for Bethesda. Because of Fallout 76 we might get the much wanted pvp arena for the next Elder Scrolls, like the one in Oblivion except this time you get paired with another player. It gives Bethesda the experience and infrastructure to do all kinds of things in future titles. 
---
Hey! I'm on Fallout lot right now because I'm waiting on a hiring process. Down to make some new friends though and enjoy the game! Gamer tag is TrojanDude
---
In my view as a non-PA melee build, I think you are trying to put a round peg in a square hole by using a low hp super sledge build against mobs that can stunlock.  Even with martial artist you just won't be swinging a super sledge fast enough to keep them off you, and you have no margin of error with low hp.  I recommend finding a +40% swing speed legendary, like a grognak's axe, that will allow you to block faster and also combo back at enemies.  When I was using All Rise I would get stunlocked to death by pack of yao guai etc, but with a faster melee weapon I can take them on pretty easily now.  Also suggest high hp Vanguard sets for PVE so you can soak a bunch of initial stuns if something does go wrong.  I also regularly do SBQ runs wearing a hazmat suit, so it is definitely doable with the right weapon and perks!  Good luck
---
I say save ur $$$ for Cyberpunk 2077 or something, anything other than this game. 
---
Oh just to throw it out there, strait jackets are worth a lot of money too.
---
The route map that u/smgl33t made is pretty damned cool for sure!  I thought about doing route videos for farming but with all the different builds, level spreads, and ways that people prefer to farm their mats I figured it was best to just lay out the points so that people could pick and choose which ones make the most sense for them and then they can create optimized routes to share, just like he did!  This is why I love the FO76 community, so many people sharing and taking things already shared to make them even better.  
---
I use a Furious gatling with Stabilized in power armor.  Works well enough for the Queen.  Plus other perks like Bloody Mess 3 and Tenderizer 1.  Heavy gunner perks not fully maxed out so I can melee when she lands, only getting 45% from Heavy gunner perks.
---
I feel your pain, been there with a few of my weapons.
---
Thanks; do you mean&gt;! Belching Betty or Big Bend?  (There are dead firebreathers in both but I never found any cosmetics or hats.)!&lt;
---
My comment with the link to the actual site was removed by bot. What do you want me to do?
---
Why would the brotherhood want a plan for a wooden barn door though. 
---
Now all I use the fissures on the map for is a warning sign to avoid my ears being raped
---
I have no idea about that but I know there‚Äôs a fissure site almost on top of the lake
---
I agree that PvP needs work, but it‚Äôs here to stay.
---
Since the fireproof update you can reduce explosive damage by 100%, meaning you take no damage from the explosive part of a TSE gun. Specific builds, gear and mutations setups towards surviving long enough to actually fight. Just because some people don‚Äôt put effort into understanding how to PvP well doesn‚Äôt mean Fallout 76 is not a PvP game. 
---
I‚Äôve had really good experiences (rarely) with people who want to PvP and try hard to do it well. Drawn out fights using terrain, jet packing through the air having to actually aim due to AP usage, with strategic gearing/perks for different opponents. 
---
It will all get better when those people can congregate on their own servers. It‚Äôll need more work after that too but at least the whining will die down a bit. Different servers were needed from the beginning. 
---
in case they wanted to make a wooden barn door
---
I usually get BSs when coming close to a vendor. Not like all the time - but if it happens, I am probably just entering a railway station. Believe I am seeing a pattern there. 
---
More than 100 hours into the game, I had 0 interaction beside some emotes. And it's perfectly ok.
---
Actually.. With marsoopial/ birdbones and a team with the right perks..  the vampire costume... And aradium rifle.... You sorta could be a flying bat with a sonar "looking" attack... Make it full auto to help get a higher spm too .
---
See, a new way to make the game challenging to you. 
---
Also.. If you purposely build to be bad/weak, how on Earth could you expect to take on end game mobs?
---
It's also, uhh, burning.
---
What are the rest of your points in? You need to have more in damage. Crits and/or sneak and/or upping your rate of fire (through VATS or faster reloads etc.)
---
Yes.  It's stupid. 
---
wood isn't effective either
---
I‚Äôve read this but I found my plans at level 50 something at a train vendor.
---
Thanks, I will try this.
---
I play on PC and I've mostly had positive experiences. I have had one, and recent, really negative experience with griefers. One was level 288 and they literally just went around taking peoples claimed workshops, flagging them for pvp, fast traveling to them, and killing them. 
---
You didnt get it. I don‚Äôt complain about the TSE debuff I say there is literally nothing else filling the gap. There is no replacement. So can you still play? Yes. But it won‚Äôt be fun. And that is what my post is about. 
---
It would be great to increase the budget for building so that you can add weapons to walls, bobble heads to shelves etc.... like you could in FO4. I like the idea of using bobble heads for what they are rather than just collecting but I would still like to display, same with magazines. Someone also mentioned being able to fill your tub with pre-war money - that would be cool too!! Not sure about allowing certain junk but i think weapons would help with stash capacity.
---
All i want now is stability :)
---
Not taking enough psycho, man...
---
&gt; Remember it's a game. "incredibly annoying" should probably be the last thing you want to hear about any game mechanic. It's so annoying it feels like a chore.
---
Only incredibly annoying can mean such a wide range of things. Early on, one person said the 400 stash limit was incredibly annoying and stupid. We had a conversation and the reason he found it so, was because he loves hoarding the bobbleheads. He had about 30. And at one pound each, that's a lot. I asked why not use them?
---
He didn't want to. He's a hoarder and he needs more room to hoard all the things he wants. 
---
So is his incredibly annoying valid? Or just valid from his stance? Should the game change one of its fundamental principles because someone wants to just hoard digital items in a game?
---
Yes, I can understand that if someone is playing solo, that you might get something you want for another character, and if you don't have ingame friends, that's frustrating since you don't have reliable help to transfer that item. 
---
I've helped strangers several times do this. They approached me, and I was happy to help. 
---
Is it really that hard to try and make some ingame friends? 
---
Thanks for this idea.  (I don't actually know anyone with the perk.)
---
Put a medium scope on it, have skeetshooter3, mod for accuracy, and this should be good enough for hipfire at close range. For mid-long range (no suppressors) pop into scoped mode just before you shoot and it should be a nice tight group all the way out to max range. 
---
With the mission currently eating all technical data do you really want that. (Yes I got these super rare plans let me go get rid of these 30 ivory grips plans, wait where did my good plans go? Noooooo!)
---
Brotherhood of Barns
---
The best thing about the Lucky Hole is that it doesn't matter.  Ore Nodes are player specific, not instance specific.  You can have the whole sever in there with you, harvesting the same node and it doesn't stop you from getting any.  And then if you server hop, nodes refresh.  I pulled 1200 lead out of here in two hops.  The hardest part is finding acid ... but I live on an acid pit, and i take Hemlock holes workshop (3 acid pits) whenever I am playing for a while, and I am swimming in lead.
---
Well it can be beginner, and you can use it against melee.
---
If you click on weekly then on the quest it might show you the flowers it considers for the challenge. maybe it doesnt consider soot flowers and rhododendrons flowers, or expects you to pick a certain amount of different types. (i dont know I have not yet signed in today)
---
&gt;Excavator PA 
---
PENCILS!! Why didnt i think of that, they're everywhere! Gah!! Thanks!!!
---
She gets health and damage buffs depending on the amount of players in the event  it‚Äôs ridiculous atm because a full lobby makes her. Pretty much invulnerable, the optimum I‚Äôve found is 6-8 lvl 100+ but then you have lvl 6 Timmy who is eager for blood after coming straight from another FPS and tries to kill her but just ends up being a hindrance when he gives the queen buffs
---
I love the idea of two camps, but it is because I am torn between a permanent camp to retreat to and craft, and pop-up blueprint camps that I use for support.
---
While it would be cool, everyone would have to download every picture that gets put up. Someone just has to put up 100s of pictures and anyone who gets near their camp will be forced to download all of those pictures. I don't want your pictures downloaded to my machine.
---
And unless they do direct downloads from the other users, those images will have to be stored by Bethesda on a server somewhere as well.
---
Nice, I set my camp at the mountain across from Seneca Rocks. Basically where picture 2 is facing.
---
That doesn't make it any better.
---
Don't be petty. 
---
Oh I did. You apparently missed my intent.
---
That gap shouldn‚Äôt be filled. 
---
&gt; Actually.. With marsoopial/ birdbones and a team with the right perks..
---
I run every mutation except the team perk ones because there is no point to teaming unless you build so you are nerfed solo and so they just hurt you in solo.  If you used a radium rifle you would intentionally be using a terrible weapon because all enemies in the game are immune to rads because there are no humans, and the max fire rate is substantially lower than that of a bugged scorchbeast on anything but a full auto weapon
---
I dont know why anyone would build to be intentionally weak, there are several ways to be completely OP in this game.  Hell even with a completely horse shit build one lucky weapon can break your build into OP levels.  On a half decent build you don't need any legendaries at all and you can fight 5 scorchbeasts at once
---
I normally don't care about such things, but the rolling vault door "timer" and the fact that you added the mob we killed to get the loot makes it work for me.
---
Hell yeah. And a visitors book could do the trick by loading our photos while allowing messages to be left to one another and other visitors.
---
"Left some supplies in your container. Stole some water and corn from you."
---
My hope is to stop this crybaby/dupers posts. :)
---
just don't go with your rare plans, easy fix
---
You are right with the point, that if a player stalks someone with pacifist mode, there should be no PvP interaction in any form. No damage dealt and received. Even when you take a little bit damage, they can annoy the s\* out of you. Specially cheaters...
---
But I guess this won't happen, till we have private server + mods.
---
As of right now legendary weapons are fun and worth grinding for.
---
PvP needs to be eliminated from the game before it destroys the lore of grinding for fun end game weapons.
---
Thanks, I will try that!
---
No it‚Äôs not, one person get a TSE then a duper buys it off them and sells it to other people who dupe it then it quickly spreads through the community at an uncontrollable rate causing he prices to drop as they become less rare.
---
Brotherhood of Ivory Grips
---
good on ya mate...enjoy, and maybe i'll see you roaming. :)
---
I would agree with you , but when duppers had the servers lagging this would not happen.
---
It‚Äôs only after the patch that 60% of bags disappear after dropping 
---
See guy TSE wiped every enemy at whitesprings when I was playing my alt.  Rushed him a few times for fun, lost maybe 100 caps.  Added some people from server to my friends list, Got on my main, came back, killed him twice and got my money back.  Good times no hard feelings lol
---
I‚Äôm on the PS4. I have personally tracked down a few low end players. Dropped 1k in 10 mm shells, shotty shells, plans, food, water, stim packs, improved weapons and armor and gone about my business. 
---
Oh for fuck sakes the game isn't going free to play. 
---
cyndrasil had a good suggestion. 
---
Yep 
---
We must be playing different games then. When I get three or four of them on me I might as well turn my monitor off because there is no "moving away" when you can't see where you are going.
---
If you have speed demon you almost need a class freak card and food and water become Less of an issue.
---
Yes, it says so in the official guide that you can buy. Most, not all, events have a chance at giving a legendary as well. Some, like Breach and Clear and One Night of Violence however, have specific legendaries that can drop. The Meteoric Sword and Nailer respectively.
---
Sugar grove has massive amounts of them too!
---
Especially for certain weapon types (hand made and lever action come to mind) that only ever seem to drop as legendaries.
---
Like great. My 15th legendary lever action. Good thing I only know 2 mods for it.
---
Hit up a trade Reddit, discord, site and get some armor that reduces the weight of whatever. It will stack up to 90%. If you're on PS4 I have some pieces for trade
---
Just stop! /s
---
I think you are right. This game is an experiment. They want to try and push online games into a new direction. They aren't fully sure what that might be, but they are basically using us to find out. 
---
I think one of those is, can you make a game that changes based on how people are playing it, and what they do in game?
---
What does this game really tell us about our players. 
---
Ah take me home
---
It maximises the level of the ghould before spawning then and since they are relatively easy to kill (as long as you stay out of melee range) you can farm them quite easily, they also respawn every time a new player enters the golf course area, it is also a good place to find flora which you need to craft lots of high- level items and gear
---
Online store cant link it ad its against tos. The comment will be removed if i post it
---
I don't disagree that a higher star legendary enemy should drop gear with more effects, but I wouldn't dismiss the effects of things like Zealots or Exterminators as a legendary effect.    
---
I'd be more than happy to get a high level, combat armor piece of gear with an effect like one of the above, even if single star.  15% damage reduction is a pretty big damage reduction overall (especially when stacked with other effects).  
---
That said, I'd love to see more unique effects - stuff that interacts more with mutations or even mimic mutations, or even some effects buffed - change the rad resistance secondary buff from +25 to +100, give people an opportunity to wear armor into nuke zones if they stack the effect better
---
Its incendiary rounds, not explosive rounds.  You'll see these turrets in Berkeley Springs and a few other spots.
---
That‚Äôs a fair assessment. I‚Äôm mostly concerned with how useless armor is in them despite offering a variety options for any particular build. I‚Äôd be more inclined to keep all of those ghoul slayer armor pieces if I could ever use them in whitesprings.  There‚Äôs less game variety when everyone is forced into power armor or hazmat suits I guess 
---
The forbidden words! In this sub they will hang you for that! Watch out!
---
Same here on xbox. I am 100% sure I collected several of the listed flowers, and every one says 0/10.
---
I have Electrically Charged mutation, which doesn't seem to do much damage.  But low level ghouls all seem to get crippled legs from it.
---
I was at Charleston and a gang jumped me while I wasn't paying much attention.  They all ended up on the ground unable to move, swinging their heads back and forth.  Creepy.  I left them there.
---
\#WeirdWasteland
---
I'll add as soon as I get a chance!
---
Awesome thanks for posting I'm going to try and fine it
---
Well that's that then :/
---
Very interesting! It‚Äôs beginning to look like I need Bloody Mess at minimum.
---
No the ultracite is a by- product growth that counteracts the scorched fungus and is especially good at damaging it, the scorched killers receiver and primed receivers use ultracite to build ammo which does double damage to scorched
---
I thought white knight worked for power armor, as well.
---
Eeeeeeeek! quick hide before the downvotes attack!!!!
---
Ok, I was exploring some out there places, was getting worried as it would have made a nuke run a little bit much.
---
I was making a joke. 
---
You seen quite angry at a game, as is your right to be if you so choose.  We see the game in different lights, obviously. 
---
Hopefully there will be an amicable resolution on the future to make everybody happy, though historically that never seems to be the case. 
---
On that note, have a good day my friend. I apologize if I caused you to waste energy on an internet conversation. 
---
*Though, I now want to create a "Batman" character.... So thanks for the inspiration.
---
Those are great ideas,  I mean we can build a nuka-cola machine but have no way to put colas in there 
---
Lmao!
---
Maybe it isn't that common of an occurrence? I'm not understanding how people could be saying things like "it's your build" or "don't stand still" when you have three or four on you firing from every direction and your screen is just flashing blue constantly. I can only assume they have never run into this scenario because if they had there is no way they would be defending it.
---
Trick here is that whitesprings is effectively a legendary "loot cave".  I'd argue the the crowd hunting god rolls already abused that area, maxed out dps, and probably went on hiatus already.  
---
Yeah you can tell cause their shots have a very bright orange-red tracer effect. Well, and they set you on fire. I guess I should have led with that.
---
Happened to me twice over the weekend, most recently last night. I crashed at Whitesprings, loaded into a nuke zone and died.
---
I like the sound of Idea 1
---
It feels like a lot more damage than 5%. Since I added it, I seem to be cutting through mobs a lit quicker.
---
I have nothing scientific to add, no tests, just noticed.
---
Tri fold flag , there‚Äôs a bunch on whitesprings 
---
If you want lots of views you should aim for the title of "youtube game journalist" and shit on this game. You will be swimming in views.
---
I thought the same thing, I didnt know that was even possible, as ive never known a girl gamer (mythological creatures, as far as im concerned)
---
I tried to get my wife to play borderlands 2 years ago, it did not go well. She cannot comprehend the two joystick system, I guess the last system she played was N64, where turn and move forward/back was on one stick. Pretty much was 30 minutes of her running into everything because she was looking straight up ... ¬¶-|
---
I wonder if camp food items grow more?  Would be awesome for radiation to produce a massive melon it something lol üòÇ
---
There was another game set up like this where more bad actions changed the appearance of your multiplayer character, but it wouldnt matter due to everyone being in power armor.
---
Unfortunately not, PA has it's own perk Power Patcher in the INT tree.
---
That sounds like a free website.
---
I was able to switch the combat shotgun I have back from a prime to a hardened.
---
Then you just run blind until you can see a little. It's risky, and there have been a couple times, I ended up in worse situations. Like the time I thought Harpers Ferry would be a good choice, but instead pissed off the Super Mutants. 
---
Got seperated from my friend, but he eventually found me. We got pinned down in that building you sneak through when you are trying to get to the Vendorbot. Literally groups of SM around us, shooting and tossing grenades. We went up top and had to pick them off one by one, taking cover. 
---
Ended up being one of the best moments in the game. And the whole time, the scorched beast was flying around, trying to find us. 
---
Good times. 
---
but that forces everyone to a very specific type of build if they want to damage. there should be a number of ways.
---
If you're on PC and have 1 crimson flux, I can craft it for ya at no charge. 
---
They would give the plans to their JV team, the Brotherhood of Wood.
---
Admittedly, I'm pretty sure I got Good Doggy in one of the card packs.  I didn't pick it for myself.
---
I'm not sure there's a solution to your problem though.  Many people have asked for spoilage to either stop in stash, or have specific containers in your CAMP that would prevent spoilage, but Bethesda hasn't delivered.
---
Currently running with the speedy receiver, will switch it out to prime soon once I have enough ammo stocked.
---
That is an awful idea, there is lore connected to the glassed caverns being near Prime, and it's purposely in the high level zone. It wouls throw off the game's balance
---
I get anxious about thinking about repairing guns, PA and armor so I horde junk. My entire 600lbs in the stash is nothing but bulked and loose junk. 
---
Then I‚Äôm using my excavator armor with calibrated shocks to carry about another 100lbs of bulked and loose junk. A stash expansion would be world changing for me in this game. At least make bulking have some benefits. I just do it because it‚Äôs neat. 
---
they could make it so we can allow certain people to be able build near you to prevent trolls.
---
LMAO.  Exactly, everyone is nice to each other when in the discovery stage of a game.  Season veterans are a lot more wary.
---
I wish. Had a guy mow down me in pacifists mode by shoot ground next to me 
---
while i like your concept..could be cool, the game actually promotes griefing...even perks for it.
---
Thats what i really enjoy about the game...its like real life...no protection from asshats...lol, but there is (like in real life) retribution ;)
---
Absolutely max str is 52
---
I think you should add some pockets to your gear?  
---
Or just go on "sorties" with your combat build, return, swap into your "farming" gear, and go pick up junk for next sortie.
---
\*laughs in glowing pustles\*
---
It is. I hate inventory management, and in F4 it was tolerable. In F76 it's beyond all reason, because you NEED to loot almost everything to repair weapons and armor and craft ammo. I have 12 strength, ALL perk cards for making  items weight less (and guess what, this does not transfer yo your stash) and still once in a few hours i need to spend half an hour sorting shit and treveling through all the map to sell shit I dont want to even bother about, because of caps. Automatic weapons break in minutes of usage, ammo is flying away like crazy, legendary items drop and cant be scrapped, holy shit I hate this so much. I jsut wanna loot, throw all of this into the stash and forgot about it.
---
Where's my wazer wifle.  
---
You could try to get to the top of the AMS building and see if that takes you outside the build restriction boundaries.  Do it!  For science!  And report back the results, lord knows I couldn't make it up there.
---
See that would be awesome. If I didn‚Äôt actually enjoy the game. I want genuine players who are either struggling and want to learn how to actually play and try to show people their errors and why they‚Äôre having issues with killing or getting the items they want. I hate that people shit on this game because they have no clue how to use the perk cards properly or work it into their builds properly to feel viable. 
---
That's a pretty nice CAMP in a sweet location.
---
I'd be happy if we could just share our pictures in game with our friends so they could have them on their loading screens. I have some good pictures of my friends and they of me that we would each like to have in game.
---
Just out of curiously, how often have you fought four scorchbeasts all by yourself? I'm just getting the feeling that other people haven't experienced the amount of torture I have from these things. 
---
Man, now I know where to get a ton of lead, I just need steel.  I'm burning through steel faster than lead and acid.  Though super mutants are supplying all the gun powder I'll ever need lol.
---
I had this happen last night , it got triggered due to me having a level 15 in my team and close by top level of those crappy machines never exceeded 22 only one legendary , and yes I got crap of it 
---
Does the prime receiver boost its damage? Normally they do as if they are a hardened receiver for other guns but the Gatling doesn‚Äôt have hardened receivers.
---
Did you try to reverse pickpocket?  ;)
---
Dang we really need that in 76, would make stealth way more amusing.
---
I want that too!
---
I have 15 INT, guess I need to wait on a lucky perk card pack, haha.
---
You just need to wait. Game was released two years too early. Its full of problems and bugs without any testing. I have never ever seen this buggy game release which was sold for people as full price.
---
Amen. I'm wearing all weight reduction armor, and I gain 70ish pounds when in power armor. 
---
Just doing it for the achievement, just stumbled in a world where it been bikes but the queens gone
---
Nice. 
---
The plants will also bloom if you are grouped with someone else doing that part of the quest. I did mine with a friend, and then we did it again with another friend. 
---
I was able to share Green Thumb and we both gathered two blooms for each node. Then with Chemist, I was able to make two for one. And because of Super Duper, I managed to end up with over 40 radshields.   
---
So if you have ingame friends. Don't all do the quest at the same time, and you can have lots of Radshields. 
---
I'm looking for the same on PS4.  Would you be able to mod my marine chest to buttressed as well?  I'm sure I have the mats, let me know what is needed though.  I can throw you some caps if that helps.
---
If you are using weight reduction perks, like bear arms, you will not notice the ones on armor. It seems they don‚Äôt stack. You can test this yourself quite easily. 
---
I'm sorry PC : edited
---
I don't carry any food on me and no water, I got the Lead Belly perk for a reason, so I drink toxic waste water and food well... You are my food XD.
---
But cems losing would be a real pain in the back. But well with 1000 bobs at the same time you wouldn't kill anyone anyways soooo... Yeah have fun XD
---
You know, I had a thought that radiation storms should have an effect on areas it passes over. maybe some plants turn to their radiation version. Some creatures do too. 
---
Man, you clearly can‚Äôt make space in your head for how people act on the INTERNET, let alone in a game where horrible bloodthirsty drug-addicted raiders have been a main component since 1997.
---
Petty? The no-consequence, ‚ÄúI need a safe space‚Äù attitudes from players on here don‚Äôt make sense in a post apocalyptic nuclear wasteland.. Those attitudes are petty to me - it sounds like they want to play Fallout 4 online. 
---
Which is fine. Hopefully the new server differences will make everyone happy. The pacifists can play with the pacifists.
---
Ultimately the majority of the PvP whining is  members of one play-style claiming that another play-style is invalid because *surprise* other players can effect your gameplay in an online game.
---
This.  I mined it a few weeks back after a tip here, still have a couple hundred lead stored after smelting all the ore and making thousands of rounds.  Steel has ironically become more scarce for me than lead or gunpowder.
---
Yeah, i agree the game is more amazing than most think. Spent hours min-maxing my perks.
---
Garrhan Mine (all the way at the bottom of the map where you get the excavator PA).  In the basement right where to register the armor, there is a small cave.  In there are 6 or 7 Iron nodes.  Grab those in your Excavator suit, server hop, and repeat.
---
I once found a lvl 5 at garahan mansion 
---
hah, i just had to sing the president song, that i learned in 3rd grade, to myself. I am 36 years old. It amazes me the shit that sticks in your memory. 
---
pretty cool! how'd you make the top part?
---
Dang. If u were xbox I have 30 chassis, pretty sure I would have had any level u needed
---
Make friends to treat them like a pack mule? So I should inconvenience another player with my inventory management issues? You seem to be making excuses for a bad game mechanic. If you told me you didn't like Cola. Should my response be to give you 101 reasons why you should like it? It's horrible and it feels like a chore. It's a game, I don't need an explanation on why something that's incredibly annoying should stay that way.  
---
The Prime receiver boosts it damage, even vs. non-Sorched, but has an extra bonus vs. Scorched/Scorchedbeasts.  Looks like the extra damage vs. non Sorched does make up for the slower fire rate vs. the Speedy receiver.
---
I'll keep an eye out fir that one. Found fort defiance and got to general of enclave but thats the only faction i have bothered with so far.
---
I‚Äôm trying to get the rare costumes , that‚Äôs what fuels my will to play this game I need mr fuzzy !!!
---
I never understood the hate against TSE. When I didn‚Äôt have one, I used the other players TSEs to get high xp and was fine without since the enemies would fall either way.
---
Im running a rifle as main. Will look into it but I don‚Äôt think I like the Vats builds. Just doesn‚Äôt feel right 
---
Oh no... **NOT MY KARMA!!!!!**
---
Though I'm guilty of farming there, I totally agree it's a loot cave. Hopefully in future updates, things are spread out more. Less legendaries, but if higher quality. 
---
There is a little house close to the fire station. The one you go to for fire breathers . East side 
---
I never said this is the only alternative. Besides, everybody is currently using a specific build; TSE.
---
It is too much to ask for engaging end-game content before resorting to contrived challenge runs that don‚Äôt develop my main character?
---
Been doing that run.  Now I just need acid
---
I have a few extras from farming mutations at Emmit Mountain disposal. On PS4 though :(
---
Pens for springs too
---
I'm not sure, one guy with the XB1 X says he has less issues. I'm buying a XB1 X once the prices drop as this system is long in the tooth.
---
I didn't say I fought them myself. I don't because I'm not playing a group game as a if it was a single player game. 
---
LMFAO, I just laughed so hard my co-workers all popped their heads above their cubes!
---
There's a youtube channel thats has numerous videos on the subject. Search fo76 secret places you can camp. Lots of good stuff. 
---
This is all speculation. Spreading like a fucking wildfire 
---
I appreciate the thought either way! Love the FO76 players!
---
&gt; You seen quite angry at a game, as is your right to be if you so choose.
---
No you are just intentionally ignoring a very obvious bug to make a dumbass assertion that it somehow makes an insanely easy game difficult, when it just makes it look hilariously bugged.
---
God damn, that's expensive
---
Yep Welch station for me too.  Only needed one server hop and the plans were there.
---
Except that other people can be farming and you can spend 15 minutes with nothing to show for it.  I know because I used to do the routes as well.  Lucky Hole Mine is guaranteed to net you a shit-ton of lead.
---
Yep! Didn't know they stayed grumpy with you. Accidentally smacked one with a melee weapon, and got face-fucked by a hundred lasers at once. Went back to say sorry, and received a similar face-fucking. 
---
*The robots remember*
---
I feel like this would be a fun one because they could royal jack my build around. 
---
They aren't named differently. They just have on golfer outfits.
---
I read a while ago that there's a weapon that lets you create a ladder out of the projectiles and climb buildings, do you know what weapon it is? Harpoon or railway I'd assume, I have neither though
---
Yeah, the ghouls at Whitesprings will tune you at your level. It's not your skills, it's just the numbers. What's your current build?
---
That damned behemoth is right beside my camp. He never attacks unless I get close but I can't explore that general area.
---
Metal armor, It cheap and has good values. 
---
It‚Äôs a mess. It‚Äôs not just you. I am level 100 and there‚Äôs just not enough to do to bother grinding ahead. 
---
I could be mistaken but I think PA has its own perk card. Which functions the same way. I couldn‚Äôt tell you, I wear marine armor. But I believe it‚Äôs under Agility 
---
Some of the women I've teamed up with in 76 have been fucking ruthless lol.  It's great to see that the game caters for both sexes.  
---
Gaming is more universal now then ever though.  Like the movie industry, you will always get genres that draw in a specific demographic.  76 has elements for everyone.  I'm just happy gaming is getting to the point where it's more accepting to game in free time.  Being called out for it being a waste of time by people who then watch 7 hours of TV a night...  That used to grind my gears.  
---
Then why are you following this subreddit?? 
---
Someone was on here awhile ago saying that had happened. So maybe? 
---
A few minutes, if the spawns are up.  When I did routes like this, I'd very often find the lead items already gone.
---
So you love fighting some same dump enemy wasting endless resources? I certainly don‚Äôt. And with TSE it suddenly made sense to fight a scorched beast instead of logging out and back in as most players do without. It just isn‚Äôt worth the resources.
---
Isn‚Äôt it heavy? I thought that contributes too how well you sneak. 
---
tesla is effective as mass pve weapon. as for people f8 w e/other - they use big guns and ballistic legendaries
---
Rent could be a certain number of caps a week ;o that way if you miss out on rent, the plot becomes available quickly, and it encourages to get on 
---
agreed...I was lucky enough to get a 3\* flamer with explosive effect, but the fuel is too damn expensive to make.
---
They hold a grudge if you look at them sideways.
---
I have as well. Almost 100 on my third char now with about 400 hours of gameplay. So I enjoy this game quiet a bit. I‚Äôm always changing things around to make it stronger. Or more enjoyable. 
---
No
---
Use power armor against ghouls or their radiation attacks will decimate you.
---
Use nukesdragons.com/fallout76/ to help craft a build you're going for. Just max out damage in one weapon class and you'll be ok. 
---
No sorry i dont, i barely joined reddit just so i can join in the discussion.  But I'll look into it though. Thanks 
---
People will defend anything in this game because of extreme cognitive bias overriding actual reality.  They don't want to think of themselves as a person who makes bad decisions so they have hardened their minds to the faults of the game after defending their purchase so many times to people on reddit, their default mode is to defend 76, not try to improve it or give actual criticism
---
I don't know.. Because I don't know what a "build" is or where to find that information. See.. Totally lost. I just picked perk cards that I liked not knowing what would come if it, or.. How to make a build. :/
---
I keep coming across people making Wilson Brother‚Äôs Auto Repair into their C.A.M.P. I was surprised the first time because I thought we weren‚Äôt supposed to be able to build C.A.M.P.s too close to map markers, let alone right on the actual location, but now it‚Äôs been so common I‚Äôm surprised when it‚Äôs in its normal state.
---
Level 20 characters should not have the ability to spawn level 20 enemies east of the savage divide. If they are able to, then it is a serious flaw in the game.   A level 20 should get demolished by a level 68 enemy of he travels into that region. If he doesn't, then there is a very serious problem with the game and it's a broken game mechanic.

Troll quality 2/10

Humor: 1/10

Nugget reference 10/10
---
Try downloading 3DMark, run the time spy benchmark. If you get a black screen there your problem is probably hardware related. 
---
Why? Because like others i bought into it, to my regret. I hope one day it will turn into a half decent game atleast but them hopes are getting slim still.
---
I did the same thing. My 2S Flamer has been sitting in my stash until they move the fuel for it to Ammo where it belongs. It's a Heavy Weapon and should make 50 at least without perks.
---
Gotcha I tested that and even if I remove bear arms my weapon weight reduction Armor doesn‚Äôt change my weight?
---
I'll have to check that out. 
---
The trick with Poseidon is to turn off the lock down from the security station in the middle of the plant. 
---
Rumor: Group of trolls keep posting the same link over and over in almost every thread.
---
lol don't believe it until i see it.
---
Need the M1 Garand from FONV so he can say ‚ÄúGet off my lawn.‚Äù
---
Thanks for the reminder. Just moved over. I like that it's in the road. Would like to make a checkpoint or some kinda road sign there 
---
Ehh shouldn't be up for too much longer. Most of the items I've seen are guys duping. That should have been fixed in the last patch. Plus the user agreement state's that the sale and purchase of in game items for real money is prohibited. They have been bringing that ban hammer down pretty hard lately. Some of them may already be banned and haven't taken the add down yet.
---
I embraced it at this point unless it diminishes STR. I embraced it so much, I went and bought a plaguewalker serum.
---
Wooby should become grahms associate and companion. The two could travel wv and talk about dreams, trades and meat all day. Wooby looks so desperate on the screenshots i saw, and grahm is so lonely out there. Each time we meet i feel like i should just walk with him for a little while so he doesn't have to be alone all day.
---
Let the only living 2 npcs team up!
---
This was posted before and I thought I saw people saying that it wasn't happening, but I don't remember seeing any official confirmation of that. Has Bethesda made any official statement on this?
---
I eat Halloween candy and you can carry a lot and it doesn‚Äôt spoil. 
---
Literally any sandbox game ever

\*Checks rest of channel\*
---
PewDiePie needs support, SJW's are ruining things, and "X is trying to Ban Me."
---
Yeah, thanks, but I'll pass. I get the feeling in two weeks, he could possibly be placed in an asylum.
---
If you drop it, it disappears and I'm not sure but I doubt you can trade it. He may have been trying to steal it from you, but it's more likely he didn't know either and wanted to be helpful. 
---
i would love a stash increase. ATM i can manage just fine, except for my mini nukes. I dont want to throw them away but god i hate dedicating 100 lbs to them. 
---
What i would really like to see is separate containers, like a junk box and an ammo box and a clothing box, that each had a separate weight limit. 
---
I just use quad explosive
---
Either go for rifles, shotguns, melee, or heavy guns; buy a two shot explosive version of one when you‚Äôre lvl 50. You‚Äôll be fine. Make sure to get the weapons damage and support perk cards for your desired weapon, bloody mess in luck, and either makeshift warrior or the gun equivalent in intelligence so your weapons won‚Äôt break fast af. Lastly, find some power armor and keep it up to level. 
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll give you a bunch of stuff. I don‚Äôt really play anymore due to 0 endgame, an anemic camp budget and broken camp movement system that makes base building suck, dupers, restrictive PvP, and bugs. That said, it‚Äôs all free.
---
Gamestop exclusive the blue one and the green from 
---
None that I've seen.   Saw this read and didn't see it here.
---
EB Games Australia has already debunked this rumor.
---
I think it was Belching Betty.
---
Also everyone who does a few quests gets the inoculation
---
it's on the front page, finally. now if we could contact an official rep...
---
how to tag lonevaultwanderer or whatever their handle was?
---
?
---
I would love to build mine on the sky train. dont think i can, so havent tried.
---
Yeah it happens to us a lot. Or you can also appear naked and stretched if wearing power upon entering  a building that loads.
---
Ok that's good
---
For me this game is soso. I play it a lot but usually end up just going around to shops selling/buying then going back to my base. solo play is kinda boring once you've been to most places, However I still do find fun in it from time to time.
---
still going to spec into my Tse handmade.... rife dmg/ignore armor/explosive dmg
---
will still be powerful...
---
Sandbox games are only good if you can keep players engaged and on good morale.
---
OP wasn't asking of you were bored.
---
You will still make a dent after the patch, just not quite as deep, so it may take a bit longer to get the result you want.
---
The game is easy enough. Why do you just want to remove any of the choices that have pros and cons? What‚Äôs the point of perks if you want to be great at everything?
---
Made a post a few days of this problem.
---
Before dropping something to anybody make sure the initial drop is something to test the spawning of a brown bag , then next add whatever you want inside the bag.
---
Then once you‚Äôre done let your friend know he could pick it up.
---
If not ,it will disappear 
---
Run it like Hornwright Industries, eh.
---
On the paper, my raider on psycho was meant to sprint and jump on everything. But I quickly found out that it doesn't work, because I mostly play while high. Absolutely incompatible!  
---
I changed my build and became an unkillable tank on Buffout.
---
&gt; In F76 it's beyond all reason, because you NEED to loot almost everything to repair weapons and armor and craft ammo.
---
No you do not NEED to loot everything. 
---
First, there is ammo all over the world. Yes you don't always get the ammo you need, but the world is filled with it to find. 
---
Second, you can learn where to find higher concentration of the resources. Have you ever been to the gym in Flatwoods, or the Charleston Firestation? Two low end areas that have weights that give tons of lead. Lots and lots of lead. Morgantown high school for plastic, among other places. Like Hemlock Holes. 
---
As you level up, you get great perks that help with all of that. One that increases the return of making ammo. One that gives you a chance to get double. One that lowers the cost of materials to repair.
---
The lower levels are a meant to be a struggle. As you level up, the idea of certain perks being only available starting at higher levels is meant to represent how you've learned to be more resourceful. 
---
When I'm out doing junk runs, I don't pick up everything. I pick up only that which I need. And I scrap as I go along, and I know that Ribeye steaks are better for weight carry bonus than Grilled Ragstag, because they weigh less. 
---
I could go on and on about the other things you mentioned. But in the end, I'm just left with the feeling that you don't like playing games that require you to have to put some thought and work into. 
---
Perhaps that... but other 'loud issues' included the rampant bugs, crashing and duping.
---
You can't get away with "Standard Bethesda Single Player Game Release Bugs" levels in a persistent online multiplayer game.  They clearly dropped the ball on having a proper beta, instead choosing to use their B.E.T.A. as a sort of marketing tool.  That decision likely kneecapped what fo76 could have been at release.
---
Unless, of course, you view fo76's multiplayer aspect itself as more of a paid beta for Starfield...
---
I live in France and I play with a friend who is in Russia.
---
Oh good lord no, the amount of griefiers will skyrocket x.x
---
Got class freak level 2 my friend, it only helps so much unfortunately. And I‚Äôm not really wanting to take off bloody mess level 3 to class freak out because that one helps so much with damage output. Plus it‚Äôs not the food and water really that‚Äôs the issue, it‚Äôs how much keeping a decent enough amount of food and water on you with it adding so much to your weight that‚Äôs the issue (but that‚Äôs also simply my opinion)
---
Last thread I saw, about 8 down from this one, they posted a link to EB games twitter saying that EB was going to pull fo76 and have it go free, EB responded and called the claims false.
---
the game dips low here and there, but on average maintains a pricepoint around $40. the game definitely struggled to sell, but i highly doubt that they are making sustaining revenue on atoms right now. not a chance that they are making more off atoms than sales at this point either.
---
I'm glad you mentioned bulking.  I wonder if it is a bug that only Aluminum and Lead bulk to be less weight (-50%).  If so, just a fix there could mean dramatic savings.
---
&gt;Maybe the game will end for me in the next few days/weeks
---
Bye
---
Yeah. I actively chase them down so others don't have to. PA/Heavy build here.
---
Bugs and glitches vary from person to person, but for the most part, it's been blown out of proportion. You should have no more trouble running the game than you did with 4, although I hear a lot more PS4 horror stories than anyone else.
---
That said, keep in mind that gameplay is different. There is plenty of story, but it's delivered in small doses from holotapes and notes instead of long NPC discussions. If you enjoyed Fallout 4 for the exploration and all the little side stories you found there, you'll probably enjoy 76.
---
Don't think it even allows you to drop it - at least I tried to drop a whole power armor chassis with painted pieces and it didn't allow me to.
---
I get most fun out of playing random events with friends. And that is unlimited. So I guess it depends on what "fun" translates to for the individual player.
---
Harpers ferry has the plan with the hard bargain perk it goes for like 200 caps
---
been thinking exactly about this.
---
option 1
---
Hazmat gets linings for some DR.
---
Option 2
---
Making a change to what you suggest of it being worn as underarmor
---
Hazmat **allows armor parts and underamor to be worn under it** while being "apparel" or "outfit" (dont remember what it shows as)(so we can all look the same in nuke zones, and not have people in golf suits running around, as it would look kind of silly).
---
And to balance it, we change the RR on them and lock them out on levels just like PA
---
Hazmat Damaged RR 401 - Level 15
---
Hazmat Normal RR - 453 - Level 35
---
Hazmat Prototype RR 513 - Level 50
---
We also add all hazmats to the vendor lists
---
Damaged and normal, responders, raiders, whitespring, harpers, watoga
---
Prototype, enclave and bos
---
Thats for us and not having to live inside PA all the time, now for beth, they could use this a new venture for the their atom shop, selling skins for the hazmat suit (i mean, hate the atom shop, but its a business after all)
---
... afterthoughts... perhaps the space suit and nuka suit could get the same treatment so we can also use them in nuke zones?
---
&gt; As of right now legendary weapons are fun and worth grinding for. 
---
I agree, it was a major part of the end game for me and I had lot of fun trading legendaries with other players or hunting the trading subs for that exact roll I wanted.
---
&gt;PvP needs to be eliminated from the game 
---
Pretty safe to assume it will never be removed. People never pressured Bethesda for a PvP oriented fallout, the PvPers in this game are in minority vs the PvE players. It's Bethesda themselve who wanted PvP for this game and I doubt they will go backward (PvP content is coming soon even though I assume most people would like more bug fixing or PvE content instead).
---
Scorchbeasts should be considered legendary tbh.
---
they drop bad loot and they're a bitch to fight, especially if you're a melee build. you should be rewarded for killing one not paying to kill one
---
It would be nice to make a type of preset
---
Yes I'm on xbox and usually on most afternoons. (I would love stuff.. Lol) Thank you for the info. I feel so lost when I get on here. I thought I was going to find nice clues and extras on reddit (which you do) but mostly ppl are talking a whole other language to me. 
---
Part of the attacks on bases is a direct result of how shitty the opt-in only PvP works out to be in the current system. 
---
No outlets like battlegrounds or rewarding events for PvPers, no specific PvP servers, and no strong incentive to ever take a workshop mixed with little end game content means people looking for new experiences sometimes end up destroying player bases.
---
Hunter/Hunted feels like they slapped it on in the last week before beta.
---
I‚Äôm curious if the sever options will change this very much. Without actual PvP *content* the content might keep being people who don‚Äôt want to PvP. I understand why that sucks and people can blame players all they want, but Beth is where the buck stops. We are all within their world(s).
---
Log out then log back in.  It‚Äôs called server hopping.  Problem solved.  
---
They're all probably from the midwest/northeast on snowday from the snow/cold.
---
Have you ever played a Fallout game before is the first question? If not it will all seem overwhelming. For your first time just make a more rounded character. Learn how the game functions, and how things go with it. After you get the hang of it, and have some time under your belt worry about making a new character to specialize in. 
---
As far as White Springs goes don't worry. Depending on who else is around you are just under leveled for it. I can run through it one shoting everything, but my level 70's friend still has to hit the ghouls multiple times. 
---
As far as when you see people here talk about TSE, they are talking about Two Shot Explosive guns. They are OP right now, and will be getting nerfed here very soon. 
---
Lastly, don't be afraid to ask people for help. Whether it just be advice, or maybe to team up. Also don't be afraid to talk to people in game. Most of us are actually nice.
---
You can get 300+ iron ore in the hills around [https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1664](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1664) Hornwright Air Purifier #3.  It's all over the place here.
---
Industry insider here folks!
---
ITT: People so deluded by their favorite videogame that anything potentially negative about said game is a conspiracy against them.
---
wild carrot flowers did it for me
---
I took 3 1* rifleman perks for a 3 slot 30%dmg boost vs a 9 slot (3x3*) 60% dmg boost. It opened up more choice for me on perks. Ive found that reducing max damage and focusing on balance has increased my QoL and ability to explore for longer on less supplies.
---
Or as others have stated, look for 3* gear with affix's that decrease item weight other than junk weight, I swap incissor for pack rat when its time to fast travel home.
---
It has some merit.  But all pure speculation.  Just ignore it and move on I guess. 
---
Except for Power Armor. Then you pay no price and you're don't have to even farm legendary affixes you get the entire godmode set handed to you at lvl 20-50.
---
Apparently these people are convinced this is some troll operation against their subreddit instead of, you know, posting an article concerning the game this sub is about.
---
Oh that's awesome, thanks for the info!
---
This.. Yes I am always creeping around hidden so might be a good fit. Thank you
---
doing Atom's work
---
I preferably like this idea.
---
Pleass
---
What paid dlc are you talking about? Do you know something I don't?
---
Bethesda said there will only be cosmetic items costing money, future content updates will be free.
---
Should just ban all the trolls
---
nope, but we've had this convo in another thread. 
---
I still don't see it as a problem.
---
It isn't entitlement, it's being marketed incorrectly.
---
I've had players hunt me down for a 10 cap bounty (incurred from defending some else's workshop event mind you).
---
Only to have them die and loose way more caps than the 10 they earned off of me. 
---
I've found on my newest character that not taking the weight reduction cards/bonus search cards really makes me value loot differently. It forces you to only grab essentials instead of everything nailed down. Then again my weapon of choice is a pistol on that character so my weapon weights stay pretty light.
---
They know if they made it free to play they would never be able to keep people from duping and glitching into things lol it would be a worse move than they have already made but. You never know
---
Oh no butthurt here. I just thinks it's amusing   that you're complaining about the fact that you bought amazing gear which would take an honest person untold time to acquire, yet this amazing gear needs a buff because it's still not quite enough to make you a competent player. Enjoy your day.
---
That sounds fun!  Mod it to add the razor blades and play as a psychotic June Cleaver.  Even if you sometimes lose you'll be too busy looking good.
---
That statement is only true if people are playing the game within the boundaries of it's design. If they aren't then it becomes frustrating.
---
And that's my point. A lot of people are used to games that allow for what I call lazy playing, because they don't require much thinking about. 
---
Thinking isn't a bad thing. I don't really have to spend hours and hours inventory managing, because I learned early on, what is valuable and what isn't to me. Why ever store wood in your stash box? You can spend a few minutes gathering wood and bam. There you go. Steel is easy to get too. So stash maybe a little. 
---
Not that hard to think it through I think. 
---
Very fast swinging weapons like that don't benefit much, if at all from Swing Speed
---
Nope
---
600 really isn‚Äôt that bad. People are just hoarders and can‚Äôt manage their stuff cause they think they need every single item they find 
---
We get it.  You don't like Fallout 76.
---
Not true.  I won't bother to elaborate because you can easily search how to survive tse shots in pvo if you actually cared.  See you in game :)
---
They both will work, may have to shoot a few time sometimes
---
Don't let the vault hit you on the ass on your way out.
---
Very well written post, thanks for taking the time to post. 
---
I completely agree with you on the armor sets needing to be a viable alternative to PA. As it stands it feels as if this iteration is geared towards two things. 
---
The first being the necessity to run A PA build in the majority of the game.  The second is the glaringly obvious benefits to Melee weapons.  
---
It almost feels as if this iteration is centric to power armor melee builds. The melee weapons have the greatest DPS without any perks to boost them. Once you start to spec your character for melee it‚Äôs almost laughable in comparison to the benefits of special points applied to any ranged attacks. 
---
Although it appears that the damage is similar, the most obvious indicator of the imbalance favoring melee can be experienced for ones self very easily in places such as Whitesprings. 
---
For example, I generally use my rifles, I have completely invested into all of the perk cards dedicated to rifles. I have maxed out all three rifleman perks as well as tank killer.  With all cards maxed this barely brings my 2 shot combat rifle up above 150 DPS. To be exact it is sitting at 151 Damage per shot. This is with all rifle man perks maxed and the hardened receiver!
---
Compare this to any of the melee weapons I carry in my inventory and the obvious bonus damage to melee weapons is all but impossible to miss.  For basic comparison my furious multi purpose ax is swinging with a healthy 167 DPS without any of the dedicated perk cards in play. I also have an instigating baseball bat that is hitting with 159 ballistic plus another 11 fire damage (I have the heated coil mod), again without any of the perk cards that are dedicated to melee weapons being used. 
---
Any and all of us can very easily view this trend within our own inventory by simply un equipping all perk cards and looking at the base damage of the weapons. 
---
Yes I absolutely understand that damage for melee weapons is amplified by your strength. To touch on this a bit I would like to point out that strength is also tied to your carry weight, which very heavily (pun intended) incentivize us all to invest into strength. I am currently sitting at 16 Strength. This is achieved by my base strength being at 11 from invested perk points and the other 5 are coming from my under armor bonus and the 2 pieces of armor I have that boost strength by 1. 
---
As you can clearly see I did not max out my strength points, nor did I originally build with melee as an intended mode of dispatch for my enemies. 
---
Back to Whitespring, my combat rifle with fully maxed rifleman perks takes a minimum of 4 shots to kill each ghoul, where as any meleee weapon I use can kill these same enemies in two to three hits. Yes I understand that my melee weapons have good perks, i also feel that the 2 shot perk for rifles is also a top perk in the ranged builds.
---
Add any bonus strength for using your PA and this is clearly indicating the benefits to melee and PA builds. 
---
I also have noticed that in comparison to the mods available for PA any and all mods for regular armor are just pale.  There are no mods available for regular armor variants that even begin to compare to the Jetpacks, optimized servos, hydraulic Bracers etc...
---
So when we look at these factors as a whole we can clearly see a heavy incentive to play a melee PA build. Add in the fact that finding nearly any PA mod is relatively easy when compared to the amount of time it will take to find either a dense or padded mod for non PA and there is almost no reason to use anything otherwise. 
---
I fell off the building east of Watoga‚Äôs civic center and somehow wound up inside the building just east of that (the one in the nw corner of the square with the power armor). I could see out the windows, but I couldn‚Äôt get out.  There were no textures inside it. I had to fast travel out. 
---
It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwasting endless resources.‚Äù Besides, if resources to kill are too far on the cost side, that is its own problem. Not a reason to have TSE level power.
---
Scorch beast being a pain &gt; it‚Äôs own problem. Not a reason for TSE level power. It‚Äôs well established they‚Äôre annoying. The answer is not to give us a god weapon to kill it. 
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be asking ‚Äúhow can I complain enough to save TSE?‚Äù You should be asking ‚Äúwhat can I use now?‚Äù
---
Minced ghouls anyone?
---
Trashcan shield would be epic.
---
Something even cosmetic and ineffective that functions similarly to the richochet perk until it breaks down and falls apart like a camp wall would be fantastic. 
---
I mean they have a blocking animation, so it would be similar to that except you're not blocking with your main hand.
---
I thought you wrote fondling principal
---
Really, this idea I like
---
This is where a radio DJ could be so fun and immersive. Imagine you start that event, and then your radio syncs up and the DJ comes over the airwaves and the song begins to play and you get something like "Ohh and that sound means someones caught the fever! Uranium FEVERRRR!" and then you do the event while the song plays and get some color commentary from him/her as the event progresses. I've always felt this event has some sort of whack-a-mole vibes, just because I always use "All Rise" and sit at the spawn holes trying to get them as they come out.
---
What quest is this?
---
JT_ke3bz
---
1.) Quantity Slider Broken
---
- The Quantity Slider will now decrement from zero to Maximum if you hold 'Left' instead of stopping at zero and loop infinitely at increased speed. 
---
2.) Dropped Items Bag Despawn
---
- Lost entire T-51b Power Armor set interacting with "Paper Bag" when you drop an item because the bag despawned during the interaction. If it is being used, do not allow Despawn...took a while to get that whole set 
---
3.) Randomly Unequipping Power Armor
---
- at no distinguishable event, helmets and legs will unequip from my Power Armor. Happens often.
---
4.) Crafting Not Working unless all Components in Inventory
---
- Crafting, especially power armor, will show meeting the required necessities, but will not craft, only way around is to get them out of storage.
---
It's not even that good in PVE. Melee attacks ignore it, ghouls attacks ignore, explosive weapon stagger from NPCs ignore it, etc.
---
PA is still better most of the time, which is why most people use it.
---
With unyielding, and perks, and mutations I have seen mine at 41. But that's without food, drug, boobleead, and magazine buffs. 
---
It's getting to the stage of needing an official response.  But really the rumors and the case for f2p was started by influencers/blogs.  So I guess Bethesda are not really obligated to do so.
---
If I do not have worms (in game) i feel that something is missing.
---
I'm sorry to inform you this, but not everyone plays the same way. I thoroughly enjoy wandering the wasteland with friends, fighting enemies along the way and hanging out at out camps. You don't have to walk around leveling camps left and right to have fun.
---
I do enjoy our PvP battles that we all goof off in. I did not, however, like being jumped by a guy 100 levels above us, constantly oneshotting us. Yes, we hopped servers.
---
My comment was not a "PvP is bad and should be removed" but "I don't want assholes who destroy camps of people way below their level to have a reward for doing so".
---
Update: I take it back, after a week with herbivore I genuinely like the mutation, I just grow corn and mutfruit and make soups before I leave camp. Satisfies hunger and thirst and gives good bonuses. Save the environment be an herbivore!
---
This would fuck lower level players. Since about level 15, I've been running main quests that bring me to the Savage Divide and since about 20, the Mire. I've been routinely running into level 40+ scorched and super mutants that already require me to be really careful and expend a lot of ammo and healing. High level players already don't clean up the messes they spawn. 
---
I really, really don't want to have to deal with those mobs also having explosive shotguns or bloodied miniguns.
---
And others which couldn't.
---
Which Trump is likely referring to. The uses of chemical or biological agents by states which have no nuclear weapons for example.

I‚Äôm on Xbox unfortunately, regardless though it‚Äôs difficult finding armor like that when you‚Äôve already got armor you‚Äôd rather keep if that‚Äôs the only effect on the armor you find (is that it reduces the weight of something) most of my armor is currently unyielding combat armor that increases stats by 1 like luck, strength etc. so it‚Äôs a bit of an annoying RNG/trading route if that‚Äôs the solution I choose to go with. But I understand where you‚Äôre coming from and do appreciate your input on this
---
Yeah it should either work like you are making tanks of fuel and they madter for some determined amount of time like cells or should be cheaper to craft or be able to craft more of them. Certainly a steep cost on my level 35 short napalmer .
---
The visual fuckstorm is the worst part.
---
Woooooosh
---
That's because of your extreme cognitive bias blocking your ability to actually see the reality of what is happening.  Sunken Cost fallacy in full effect
---
It's just notifying you of the ammo you just shot.  The only bug is that it's displaying it when you loot.  I figured this out by looking at my screen lol
---
If you are on PC check this out [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
It allows you to save presets of perk cards and switch between them when you want.
---
Yeah too bad that stuff is almost impossible to trade.  Caps have virtually no value anymore,and i don't sit on a pile of god roll armors and tse weapon to trade. 
---
Yeah I play with a dude from Greece and Poland occasionally.
---
Based on the fact that people are still chattering about this game everywhere across reddit and the internet at large, and people are still trying to fling shit at it, it's definitely a success.
---
Exactly, I'm going to stay in normal and blow up your camp or quit.  I'm not doing the pvp mode because I would have bought call of duty if that's what I wanted.  Lol
---
I have all the holotapes and journals and have listened to all of them as well, the quest won‚Äôt disappear. 
---
This post is several months behind, it failed on release day.  They should have had closed betas for months, and open betas for weeks to get the game right.  It should have been released this summer in a fine tuned release, with substantially more content outside of just leveling up

What about mutations ? any that helped ?  
---
And how do you prevent other players joining in on the SBQ ? 
---
Bullshit link incoming.
---
&gt;you don't like playing games that require you to have to put some thought and work into
---
You're a bold one isn't it? Yes, I dont want to bother with builds, reading forums, plan progression, searching whole internet to optimise my gameplay expirience. I dont want that. You know what I want to do? Play the fucknig game and have fun. Shoot stuff, loot things, level up, get awesome and usefull perks, deside which is beter, energy resistance or usual one. Exploring the world, use new weapons, make new ones, as well as armor. Discover new ways to have fun with my character how it plays, how it feels. This is what I want from this game. Fallout 4 got that. Fallout 76 does not have that. I struggle to have fun in this game. And I have fun, tho the game clearly try to not allow me too. 
---
Since the silos block you from picking that area as a target, it seems more likely that the limiting mechanism is in the targeting computer rather than some device at the vault that deflects missiles. Some low-level failsafe that says that certain destinations just can't be programmed into the missile. Why not block out the whole area, then? Because maybe you need a last ditch attack at an invading army.
---
If Bethesda wanted to follow through with the jamming idea, though, then they could go ahead and let you launch right in the middle of newbie territory, but have the missile go off course and land randomly somewhere else on the map instead of where you pointed it.
---
Hahaha oh lord 
---
I can pick up a 1060 3gb for ¬£100 though. 4gb 580 starts at ¬£140, 8gb 580 is nearer ¬£190
---
Started from the Observatory and climbed and jumped my way there. Which is impressive since I don't have any mutations or a jet pack lol
---
The Opposite rock is not reachable without a jetpack, though.
---
And I wasn‚Äôt asking what your opinion was. Yet here we are. 
---
Who told you this nonsense? 
---
On a related topic - anyone know what determines the amount of time for a disease to naturally run its course? At first it seemed like it would only be 10 or 15 minutes, which is reasonable to just wait out. But now it's always in the range of 2-3 hours, and since I've dropped so many disease cures to manage weight, now I'm having to ration cures/antibiotics and am running low, so I'd like to just let the diseases end on their own.
---
They should RP as Juggernaut with Rank 2 *Full Charge* once they hit level 33. No weapons, just momentum.
---
Thank you! Yeah, I love the fact that nothing spawns there.
---
Yes also ps4. From friday night to yesterday i had 19 blue screens and i had to close the game 2 other times. Not counting dc's.
---
 Since November i had about 30 crashes according to the error history. So in 2 days it almost equalled 2.5 months of crashes.
---
I mean, we might get something but at the same time, this is what happens when you're an early adopter. It's possible they could give our accounts buffs for xp, caps, and resources gained too. I would be happy with that idea. 
---
I'm experiencing exactly the same thing. Definitely picked carrot flowers for todays craft mentats challenge (as well as a few others) yet all show as 0/10
---
"small-gun bobblehead "
---
How many?
---
I had no problem fighting the resistance.  I didn‚Äôt think I used any stimpaks.  I‚Äôve read somewhere the more people you have with you the more resistance there will be...so maybe try soloing it?  But that could just be my two shot explosive pistol making life easy for me.   
---
well it could be a nice boost it fits well into the lore maybe its a mining suit that was being refit by someone like the responders or the bos or enclave maybe there is different versions that give different options based off the side who made this version lots and lots of places to go with it

---
It would be nice to max out a weapons special.  Traveling pharmacy, pack rat take up strength slots.  True hiker takes away from pistol perks in agility.  
---
Perks like the shotgun weight reduction, sturdy frame, pistol reduction are valid weight perks as you can have everything.  But things like aid and junk shouldn't take too many points away from a specific build.  
---
so what is the rule? for every 3 fo76 is going f2p posts there is a "concerned" post about if we will get a refund or not?
---
fo76 is not going f2p. there is no evidence going f2p is even being considered. stop helping to spread a bogus rumor.
---
Go take some Ritalin, and warm milk.
---
The reason 'fake news' gets spread so often is that it plays on our fears/hopes. In this case, it scares players who like it and riles up people living on the hate train. I've noticed whenever Inside the Vault drops, your chances of seeing blatantly biased trolls in this sub is increased. 
---
Conspiracy? No. 
---
Hateful/fearful people latching onto whatever negative press they can get their hands on? Yes.
---
So now personal attacks because of a bad game mechanic? and I'm the one bad with people... It sucks and makes the game feel like a chore.
---
I don't see a future path with PvP as long as Bethesda is so quick to respond with heavy nerfs.
---
This isn't Destiny where everyone can attain the same legendary weapon in a short time. Add in legendary armor and mutations and this game will never be balanced. 
---
The TSE nerf is only the beginning, just wait until the guys with a full set of sentinel unyielding armor start winning all of the PvP battles or the guys with 5 mutations.
---
It's going to be a never ending nerf train. What's the point of grinding in a loot game for top tier gear when it's likely to be nerfed?
---
Do you really need rifleman maxed out though? Tier 1 should be fine for most enemies if you want to be extra cautious tier 2.
---
Masupial, healing factor, adrenaline reaction, carnevore and speed demon.
---
Found a ghoul slayers one. Gave it to my friend because I didn‚Äôt have any bolts

No there are explosive turrets. A few days ago I was in Harper's Ferry and the turrets melted me. But when i went back later they where normal turrets

Well, eventually you have to have to automate all those jobs with bots, and eventually you automate the maintenance of the bots with a AI you have complete control over see.  That is just more efficient.  The proles purpose will change from a labor pool to being a pool to farm money from until your AI sorts out more efficient means using your bots then you won't really need them, and you can wall them out and ignore them or if they get to be a pain eliminate some to keep them in check.  You might want to keep some around for sport maybe.  Or maybe not.

" for no clear reason. "

lulz 
---
Grafton and Ash heap vendors.
---
&gt; Please fix.
---
I haven't seen an actual bug on this, so I don't know, but basic arithmetic shouldn't be "fixed" and should be managed by the player.
---
It‚Äôs either one. It won‚Äôt pull from both at once. 
---
Is that considered an assault weapon though?  Honest question.  When I hear assault weapon I think M16 or AK or the like, and that is about 8 or 9 lbs from what I read.
---
&gt; They clearly dropped the ball on having a proper beta, instead choosing to use their B.E.T.A. as a sort of marketing tool. That decision likely kneecapped what fo76 could have been at release.
---
And unlike you and so many other people, I can let things go. Bethesda has made mistakes. And more, they have made some poor choices, like the whole canvas bag thing. 
---
Can't change the past. All I can do is decide how I want to react to it, and more importantly, will I let it shape me, or will I be shaped by it. 
---
If a person needs to keep using something that happened months ago as a justification then that says something about the person. 
---
there is actually several vendors there but all same pool of cash - you have the production room / science wing / military wing (maybe more but those are the ones I go to) each which has its own item list from standard items to military upgrades for your scout armor and x-01 - also they sell some of the mutation serums for around 4k got my herbivore mutation there never looked back 
---
Yeah i got killed by that chicken, it pecked me to pieces.. 
---
Wow, well done.
---
Wishing my alt wasn't non automatic now.
---
this exactly...
---
 Robert Creeley D
---
Yeah, I leveled all the way up to 80-90 with a combat shotgun, before finding my Legendary pump. I also prefer the combat shotty, except for the look of course; this thing is ugly.  
---
One more advantage of the combat shotgun, the armor penetration magazine!  
---
Anyway, I'm gonna test your suggestions with my two-shot pump and my furious combat, and then buy a better one.
---
It takes me longer to kill regular Scorchbeasts with my 2000 dmg gauss rifle.
---
Kind of sick of this buggy game.
---
&gt; Don't play a healer expecting to tank etc.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't have the "rpg trinity" of Healer, DPS, Tank. You can try to fit into those roles but that's not how the game works.
---
They take max 3 points each? I think it‚Äôs good you have to pick. 
---
yeah but with its sealed off door it could easily have a vendor station computer to the side making it so people checking basic production goods wouldn't need to do the load screen twice just for 200 caps or basic items 
---
Yes. It happens all the time.
---
Either trade or drop a piece of junk first and look down to see if your doggy bag is there.
---
Maybe I should make a Twitter post and share it on Facebook... See how long it takes for you to register what I'm saying and what I'm driving at.
---
Fake news
---
Caps have value. They're like change to make a trade right. I don't trade for caps straight up anymore though
---
The hat or the uniform? 
---
This. So much this. As far as I can tell a diseased mobs chance to infect us is 100%. The only reason we dont get infected is that most people run around well fed/hydrated which gives us 50% resist. It would be nice if mobs only had a 20% chance or lower per hit instead.
---
Paper bags can disappear
---
Why did you have to drop them instead of just showing him your inventory 
---
Just block them.
---
Let me guess....throw away account that will re appear with a link to some crappy you tube channel begging for subs / likes and spouting there uneducated opinion as fact before they move on to the next big issue that requires there attention as centre of the universe.
---
Unless ofc Bambi really does know something the rest of the world doesn't 
---
Sentry bot is the best it goes even with a dress (on a guy)
---
If they shut the servers down today I'd have gotten plenty of entertainment out of this game since release day - I'd be more than happy with the return on investment
---
Which ones are you speaking about specifically...? I haven't had any issues with them, but on PSTrophies, some people have mentioned that the level ones don't pop properly, or that the lockpicking / terminal ones sometimes take a couple past 50, etc. 
---
I check there every time, along with every other vendor. I have literally checked all of them over 50 times
---
Well it's a 3 star effect roll so it has at least two other effects. Or maybe it's a 2 star roll. Regardless I agree
---
I've started leaving all my ammo in the Artisan's Corner cash register. All I use are .44 and 10mm.
---
Aye, that's what I thought, but unlike all the other cosmetic files, the toxic valley one has no flag. Hoping for full confirmation from someone who has it :)
---
He‚Äôs not tough, a tough man would make his feelings known but he‚Äôs been remarkable quit when it comes to the republican leadership.

I honestly didnt think about it at the time, now that you mention it I realize how dumb it was

Healing factor will keep you a live. Or at least I have never died when it wears off.

That would be me -iX'

Bad person
---
I got the handmade rifle plans from my second run of On Patrol. I don't know if that means it's a decent drop rate or if I just got very very lucky. 
---
By pretty much all, i mean 60/70% of the games i played or played. 
---
This is coming from someone who has 1k+ hours in Ark.. which pretty much owns he crown for games with no story/substance but that  atleast had a competitive side with far less restrictive building/mod capabilities. 
---
Outstanding! I love this. The moment early on where you headshot crit something in the distance made me laugh at how casually badass it was. You may have just cemented which character I want to make next.
---
Since it‚Äôs non-legendary, do you think you can get more damage if you use an ACR with a Scorched-Killer receiver? I know it‚Äôs a fairly single purpose rifle, I‚Äôm just wondering if the damage boost is worth it.
---
Ofc it always happen since beta. U first drop something useless and then the thing u want to drop to prevent this. If the useless stuff disappear then drop another untill u see the bag
---
Responder vendors have it in their loot table.
---
Well thats what i was affraid of, people getting banned because they are suspicious of duping.  'bethesda:  " wow this player has 30 stimpacks,  he must be a duper, we should ban him" 
---
Its time to admit that you have a problem. Might be time for an intervention.
---
On a serious note, I had that happen to 50 screws I was trying to give to a friend to make PA. From now on I am just trading a 0 caps.
---
I'm massively disappointed in what was delivered but what does my opinion of the game have to do with this article?  Are only positive posts allowed here?
---
Yes that‚Äôs extremely common. It‚Äôs recommended to trade verses dropping. I‚Äôm lazy and yesterday I dropped hundreds of .45 ammo to a teammate and it fell into the abyss and I only had myself to blame. 
---
ive only had one match with a player my level (level 16) i had only won because of the auto stim trait i had. He dodnt respawn with revenge and i just waved to him when i found him again
---
Sorry for sounding like a noob but what is AA heavy gun?  And not related to my original post but why does your tag have Enclave next to it?  Is it a clan thing?  Are there clans in this game?
---

I thought it would have been more epic :(
---
Unfortunately when you do manage to take one down you'll only be rewarded with a consumable bodypart, some bones to scrap into ultracite to throw into your stash, and that's about it.
---
They're simply not worth fighting aside from ridding yourself of the annoyance of their non-stop scream blinding.
---
Only I never said bad. I said don't want to deal with other people. It seems I hit a sore point with you about that, and you jumped to feeling I said you were a bad person. When I didn't. 
---
Also, you think they are bad mechanics because it's not what you want in a game. But that doesn't mean they are. But you'll keep say it is, and disguard any view that says it isn't, without actually being able to support your view other than, you don't like it. 
---
No matter what anyone else says about the mechanic, you will tell them they are wrong. And you want me to think you are what kind of person? I get that you don't like this kind of mechanic. I don't want you to play games that aren't what you like. There's so many other games out there that will give you exactly what you want. 
---
Awesome I didn‚Äôt realize this!! Back to the picket line for me I guess.
---
Did you find the one that spawns only *after* a nuke is dropped on something other than a fissure? It has the overseer talking about how y'all screwed up...
---
Great video.  Not sure how the game mechanic works, but I believe the Queen scales to the number of people involved in the fight/vicinity.  I was in a 2-3 person group that jumped her, and we completely destroyed her(3-6 minutes), the very next nuke with the same team there was maybe half the server if not 3/4 of it there fighting her and she was a damn tank(almost 30 minutes).
---
I said rumor. 
---
This idea I really like.
---
Halfway through I knew I liked the cut of your jib
---
Must be a cheap ass country. Even if it is one of those CD key stores that sell keys stolen from graphic card bundles etc.

I would not buy it. Too cheap üòÇ

People are being banned for clearly duping or having cheat software on their computer.

Lol still a buff ass chicken

Jfc i thought i was losing it .ty

I guess.

I'm running a vats/rifle build and my only weight perk is travelling pharmacy which is my where my 3 str goes.

Its entirely podsible to carry what you need and not what you think you need

My girlfriend loves fallout as much as me,can do anything that I can do,on my level,it is great to have a girl that into the gaming scene.wouldnt have it any other way.

No one is going to say "Halp, I got banned for duping!" Because...that's admitting to duping, lmao.
---
The scorched earth and breach and clear trophies are fixed! If that‚Äôs what you are referring to. You can platinum now :0

Idk. My neweggs for both of em for about the same price at 150$ give or take 20$. But given your probably not in my location given different currency so also probably diffrent prices.  
---
My advice get a 1060 6gb or 580 8gb.  If your running a system with low ram and not looking to upgrade it go for a 580 8gb so your system doesnt end up dumping textures on system memory. 
---
No worries brother, just haven't gotten the video done yet is all :-)  I have about another 150 ish videos roughly planned out it's just finding the time to get them all in and scheduled but the raw info is pretty quick to share!  Stay safe in the wastes!
---
They way I do it is I keep the things I know I will use a lot of. Ballistic Fiber, Adhesive, Gears, Screws, Oil and lead. 
---
Steel/wood is bountiful in here. everything else I keep a few of but not much. 
---
Super Duper and Ammosmith ( I cant remember the perk that makes ammo ) is helpful also capturing the ammo dispenser helps too. 
---
Yeah managing is a pain. But there has to be some restrictions. Also there can be a technical issue too, as to why the stash is so low. Bethesda said the in the future the stash may get increased. But right now they‚Äôre fighting to have servers stable, killing bugs, fixing glitches and working on content before people get bored and ‚Äúpeace out‚Äù. 
---
Yeah it sucks. Also Vanilla WoW was nearly unplayable for 4 months if not more when it was released. So yeah the game is like West Virginia roads, but it‚Äôs slowly improving 
---
Erm no I haven't on PC. 350+ hours in as well.
---
&gt; Excavator PA and super duper when refining the ore. It's just plain stupid the amount of lead you get. 
---
It's been weeks since I went there once and I still have hundreds of lead scrap. It's heavy but I don't want to throw it away because I will eventually need it for bullets.
---
If you make and acronym, we gotta know what it means, bro!
---
I play a stealth sniper build as well, and can get by with 3 ranks in portable
---
pharmacy (or whatever the 3 str chem weight reduction perk is called) and 3 ranks in the food/water reduction perk. Then I carry ALL my chems and food/water with me, leaving nothing in the stash as it saves a ton of weight overall. 
---
I‚Äôm able to carry enough food and water to not need class freak to offset speed demon. I only have 3 str with is down to 1 with eagle eyes and the agl mutation. With deep pocketed armor I‚Äôm able to carry about 200 lbs, and usually about 100 is free after weapons, armor, chems, &amp; food.
---
I'm on console (unfortunately).  My melee character is level 74 and I factored to change the perk points and get the perk cards I'd have to level up to 124.  Being melee, I'm well aware of the need to have gunsmith for guns just as I have have makeshift warrior for melee.  After factoring in the amount of experience it would take me to get the 124 I decided to make a fresh character last night.  He's level 4 now.  I guess I'm just lost as I spent 3 hours at Manongah Power Plant for fusion cores and the Munitions Factory for 5mm.  I don't like the Gatlin Laser at all.  Too long for the initial bullets to fire.

Guess why? Lvl 1 LEGENDARY CHICKEN THIGH!

I'm on EST and also play solo mostly in the afternoon. After 8pm I'm usually playing with my spouse,and we usually don't accept invites from "thirds..." Though we have done so occasionally if the chemistry is right.

Fyi there is a water fountain in the gazebo (?) that cures diseases at Whitesprings.

Did she forget the hunny mussie too?
---
Love fable and yes they did that but the one I'm thinking of was a survival game or something of the sort.
---
Rolled a TSE Assaultron Head... I'm done. 
---
Yes, I will tell them they are wrong because it's annoying. What's so difficult to understand about that? Games are designed to be entertaining #1. The mechanic requires too much attention, You spend far too much time with inventory management in a  game about exploring and you guessed it playing with friends! I spent more time exploring in Fallout 4 because I never have to pay attention to my inventory. This is designed to be a multi-player game and I spend more time in my inventory than every other Fallout combined.
---
We already do ‚Äúfactions‚Äù literally perfect opportunity 
---
Or run through if you are using the Pain Train perk card.
---
This is key, as another stealth sniper build. I have all the rifleman perks, but usually have them swapped out for lockpick, butcher‚Äôs bounty, and the one that harvests double plants.
---
That sounds like a bug from what I've heard. When did you complete the quest? Maybe it was patched after you hit that checkpoint.

Id like to direct you to my boss Rose, she has this super rad radio station at "The Top of the World" I think she would like to get to knee you, errr know you.

I agree. The main issue isn‚Äôt that though. It‚Äôs that Bethesda has no way to level the playing ground between 49 and under and 50+. 
---
Many games have certain regulations or drawbacks/perks etc. when there‚Äôs such large gaps in player levels to help level the playing ground. 
---
Then there‚Äôs games like Ark that don‚Äôt (and you see how things play out)
---
In a game that doesn‚Äôt provide good guns until 50+ and Power Armor which in turn plays a large role on obtaining good guns from blast zone etc. it leaves the lower levels with no chance to retaliate. You bend over or you leave the server. 
---
That‚Äôs not PvP. That‚Äôs just beating down because you can. Especially when there‚Äôs people you‚Äôre level but nah, go for the small guys because you know they cant win or retaliate to the point you worry about dying.
---
That‚Äôs the issue, not the actual following.

Check Emmit mountain disposal. Hang a right into the security cage once inside.

Other early posts reported that they're using Amazon cloud servers, specifically GameLift. An Amazon listing shows that this service is available in Singapore specifically, but being in the US, I couldn't tell you about the actual ping/performance.

I've teamed up with a lot of players in which fallout 76 is their first fallout game.  They do not want to just live inside the world of Appalachia.  They want to pvp and reek havok.  PvP causes tension in game and makes it exciting to play.  The most popular game in the world right now is PvP.  
---
I'm in the half and half.  I like to get lost in base building and go exploring.  But at the same time I like to get geared up and go killing things.  Adding penalties for PVP just makes the game less fun for those looking to fight.
---
It doesn't help also that you can see everyone's dot on the map.  If this was hidden then player interaction would be less frequent.  Would also stop the base levelling as it's easy to see where camps are.  Not that that's a bad thing.  Someone levels my base I level theirs.  Vice versa.
---
I have all mutations, except carnivore because I already have herbivore, and empath since that 25% damage increase is there even with class freak.  I‚Äôve been slowly changing my character‚Äôs special stats to accommodate my strengths and limitations.
---
I use a lever action rifle and run a 15 luck VATS crit build with high perception and agility.  I sneak around a lot.  Scorchbeasts are fun to kill, just alternating between a torso shot to get a crit, then spending it on a guaranteed headshot.  I‚Äôm not really built for it, but I stab things with a knife for fun to conserve ammo as often as possible.
---
If things get hairy, marsupial usually gets me out of the situation to heal or switch to guns.  It‚Äôs hilarious when the mini nuke goes off when enemies hit me in melee.  It‚Äôs like I farted radiation.
---
Mutations turned this game from a 7/10 to a 9/10 game for me.  So good.

That's why they always crashed *at* you. Because then you could loot the ~~dragon~~ vertibird nearby. Only... a vertibirds spawns no loot.

---
You already spent 3 slots of 15% damage and didn't want to move 3 slots for 20% damage?
---
6. Yes. The bargain perk worked like that in FO4. Invest your own caps, vendor gets a higher max. But in 76 it only works for you. Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to add since they already have inventories instanced per player.
---
IMO explosive bloodied will become far better. I have a TSE and a bloodied explosive of the same weapon. At a low hp, my bloodied outweighs my TSE. The accuracy is also better. But again this is just my opinion. 
---
Agreed. It‚Äôs like asking for mutations to not have downsides. Get creative and adjust your build as you go.
---
W00BY was simply a human model to test things on in the dev room. Or possibly a proto-synth. Maybe someone abducted by the zetans in order to test x-rated sex machines on
---
I‚Äôm still leveling at the moment (125) though so it‚Äôll be some time to pick up all the 1 Star cards for rifleman along with all the others I‚Äôve still got my eyes on, but yeah I get where you‚Äôre coming
---
Lol.. Okay I will add you when I get on this afternoon. Thank you for offering help. I felt like I was doing pretty good, nice house, etc. But then I try and kill something in whitesprings and get demolished. Lol thanks again. 
---
I've found a few.  Usually 1starred garbage.
---
 Irony.   I can make a prime receiver forXbows.
---
I had all 17 with max class freak, and the other day I decided to try to get rid of empath and herd mentality. Actually managed to lose both of those and egg head after a couple tries which was incredible for my melee character. Lost bird bones in the process but I can live with it as my build feels very strong now 
---
:)
---
This game was designed to be easy, it was never meant to be difficult.
---
Maybe, if we're lucky, we'll get some sort of server join option for a "hardcore" or "survivor" mode like New Vegas and Fallout 4 got.
---
the queen scales with more players.
---
Maybe 0/7 is for s.p.e.c.i.a.l.   so you would have to hit max rank for all cards in an attribute before see any progress.
---
Right on, OP!  Thanks!
---
They spawned when I first entered Whitesprings at level 25 but each of them was around level 50/60 odds and I got killed. I respawned up the road at the rail depot and went to get my revenge only for (and I shit you not) an organised line of about 10 level 40 Snallygasters to spawn in and attack the Whitesprings security team. I just left my junk
---
Am I the only one that thinks it's sad that I've seen this, and many other GOOD suggestions so much?

I've done multiple builds and weight reduction definitely hits some more than others.  If it was more balanced then yes I'd agree, but it's not.
---
I love you :)
---
Should have opted for pizza rolls they protect you from griefers 
---
Give this man a cookie!
---
That could be.  I just wanted to point out that nukes have a special set of nuances and consequences related to their use beyond MAD and some paths could lead to a MAD scenario unintentionally.   I did not delve into the details so I don't know the context really, and given this is a game forum I don't really want to input to this discussion further. 
---
I'm talking about regular SBs solo.
---
The assaultrons are the only dangerous part, the invisible ones to be specific. Can‚Äôt VATS them (I‚Äôm a crit pistols build). The reactor room where you have to fix all the pipes is really hard without power armor, you would at least need radshield so you can wear our regular armor instead of a hazmat suit but PA is recommended.
---
&gt;which
---
I mean i only chose this perk because already i have a high Charisma stat with me being a team medi and all
---
Server hopping like 2000 times at Enclave bunker for X-01 Jetpack is the final boss after the Legendary Chicken boss.
---
Strong Back rank 3 is, on the whole, more efficient than any of the specific weight reduction. Also, if you go back to your camp more often, you don't need to carry as much food along. Alternatively, equip Can-Do and loot a few trash cans and you can find a meal pretty much anywhere. 
---
It‚Äôs yours! :) My PSN is MandyMarieB. Just let me know what a good time is for you to trade!
---
I love this game.
---
I tried to do it last night and it was near impossible with 5 people lvl 75 or up and the remaining 8 to 10 people 40 or lower either not doing enough dmg or hiding in a bunker
---
You sure? Check Side quests - Miscellaneous.
---
Probably not activated.
---
Hadn't thought about the factions. That's a cool idea, and the photo is rad. Reminds of a version of Spawn action figure I had in the 90's.
---
I saw an assaultron funko pop the other day and it looked absolutely awful.
---
if the box didn't say what it was, I wouldn't have even known. 
---
Maybe it's due to the most recent patch, but unfortunately hiding in the elevator no longer works. I tried on Xbox last night. The elevator takes you back into the building and resets the quest to the beginning.
---
Isnt this a weekly challenge? Take out robots with a protest sign?
---
I used END as the dump stat for my sneak sniper (15 per/12 agility).
---
I took 8 pts into strength. Bandolier, -50% armour weight, and +40 carry weight.
---
Combined with marsupial (+20) and deep pocket and I can easily have over 300 carry weight.
---
200 hours and only a lvl 13? I can't imagine playing that much and have so little progress, am I missing something here?
---
Yea at no point in the game does that perk card EVER get removed.
---
For all I know a week after removing it real quick it‚Äôll register as not being there as I‚Äôm standing in the decontamination shower.
---
And your perk is rank 2?
---
Wasnt it their supplier that withdrew the games and then the Word spread? I mean if you have one supplier and they change their agreements with Beth that is nothing special. 
---
Youtube never changes though.
---
Finally got to play today!!!!
---
In terms of ammo production, Hornwright Testing Site #3 slightly trumps the Lucky Hole Mine.
---
It contains Iron and lead nodes at a roughly 2:1 ratio, which is ideal for a lot of ammo types. One run through, with excavator armour will get you around 200 Iron ore and 100 Lead ore. Log out, log in, rinse, repeat.
---
I loved the Lucky Hole Mine, but then I would find my stash filled with 60-80 bulk lead and I could never get enough steel to use it up. With Hornwright Testing Site #3 the only thing I ever need is Acid, and a couple of hours at hemlock holes can sort that problem right out.
---
This is gold. Spot on.
---
No... Bc all bugs are different. I don‚Äôt see posts for the same bugs usually. This is about nukes....
---
I fast travelled to my camp and got ambushed by Vengful Mothman.  Too bad I was coming back from a SBQ fight and was armed for bear.
---
Oh, he should have taken my rank of shotty turrets and missile launchers into account.
---
Thanks for the bonus loot, jumpscare, and laugh.  Come on back anytime,  ya hear.
---
Lol! That last line was awesome XD
---
Here's my take on Bethesda patching....
---
They can't change the roadmap's they make. Once approved I think each one is just plain unchangable meaning any new issue has to go to the back of the line like there is no triage. I understand that in triage "game breaking" would still come before "this makes me want to rage" 
---
Honestly so many good issues WAY before the new year that have been asked for (like indicator for owned plans) that Beth community people for sure saw and liked and passed on EARLY in the conversations about them, however since the Dec patches were out and first ones of new year already probably half approved something that should be pretty damn easy to patch in is still no where to be seen.
---
Those interactions with other players happen in all other multiplayer survival games. It's nothing special. And when you get an explosive weapon or focus on melee, the game no longer involves any strategy. I still play this game. I'm level 180 and I play it because I've played all other survival games out there and there is nothing else decent at the moment. This game is far from being a success. It is flawed in many ways. It has some good in it but it could have been so much more. Go play subnautica or the forest if you want to experience a wonderful survival game and go play ark or rust private servers, the forest, hell even dying light if you want the social interaction. This game is an average sub-par combination of both.
---
I lost both of mine,come to find out you have to have the second star on the starched genes perk card to keep it, found out the hard way,and I won't be bothering with the mutations until I get that card stacked up again with another star.
---
&gt; Yes, I will tell them they are wrong because it's annoying.
---
You are really just proving my point. 
---
The mechanic requires as much attention based on each person's ability to process, remember, or whatever other factors. 
---
I'm not having issues with it. But then, i don't save every weapon I think will be awesome later on, or maybe might want to pass on to an alt or whatever. Same with armor. 
---
I scrap them, and drop the parts of I don't need.
---
I build low level weapons and armor, and give them to new players or leave them around Flatwoods. I've tested how long items will stay in a container and so far, it's several hours. 
---
I was playing with the husband, dropped some plans and stuff in a container in Flatwoods. I logged off for about 2.5 half hours, he stayed on to play. I came back, half the stuff was taken. 
---
My stash box is generally between 550-600. When it gets to 600 I use that as a time to be generous. I try and keep most resources around 100. Some are less, some are more. 
---
It's not hard or time consuming. Because I learned from the beginning how to do this, so by level 80, it's automatic. I'm not always having to sit down and say, why do I have 400 cork? 
---
Stop spreading bullshit, it fucks with my zen.
---
Last night my X01 somehow lost it frame and I had all of the pieces in my inventory.  Found another frame and put it all back on.  Never the less I had a small panic attack lol.
---
This right here is what it is all about. Fallout had never been a min /max godlike power game. Having a well rounded, balanced build is a much more enjoyable experience. 
---
You could argue the other way around saying why are there endgame enemies that require that much firepower in the first place? TSE was just the answer to bad design. Simply removing it won‚Äôt solve the problem. 
---
H ave you ever played other MMOs? In each you have normally endgame tier loot that people try to get.
---
After the new patch in Fallout 76 there is nothing more to strive for. No amazing end game tier that really does make you feel more powerful. I don‚Äôt know about you but after playing for 114 Levels I would like to feel the benefit. Otherwise why bother with endgame enemies at all if the loot isn‚Äôt worth it anymore? You can go back to killing midlevel enemies. Yeah that sounds really fun. Well at least that solves the missing fusion cores problem since no pa is required anymore ;)
---
Its fallout, not everyone is nice  in the wasteland. 
---
Never played the other game. You remember what it was called?
---
Actually, now that you mention it... Why can't I equip a pistol and a ski sword at the same time?
---
Hornwright Testing Site #3 for your steel needs. 200 or so Iron ore there (and a further 100 or so lead ore)
---
I'm down to terminals, revives and pvp kills.
---
I need 50 terminals, I'm at 54,no trophy
---
Does she scale or does just all the server lag maker her invunerable?

https://discord.gg/w6yprRa  
---
The above link is a non-expiring link for the group.  I took naming liberties, and decided on "An Imperfect Circle".  
---
I honestly just stopped looking many levels ago. It's just annoying at this point. 
---
Hazmat gives Rad resist with no armor, power armor gives armor + rad resist.    
---
Biggest difference being the perks regular armor with hazmat would give but can be compensated by giving a negative DR on the hazmat suit as a very easy stat to tune.  Honestly having to wear power armor for nuke zones or being squishy as fuck in a hazmat suit as my only choices is what keeps me going to other games over 76 now that I'm 50, I have always disliked power armor in fallout games and having the entire endgame gated behind them (or rather the choice of being super squish in a hazmat as the only other option).  
---
I feel the biggest argument for the hazmat suit is there is a large group of people that don't like power armor but want to do endgame, there should be SOME method for them to do nuke zones (even if it is boosting Rad X but the consumable route feels really clunky when the alternative is step in a big suit and forget about it).  Hazmat is the simple route when costume apparel already is in game with stats but easily the rad resist perk could have rank 5 give rad immunity in nuke zones as the alternative which makes non PA players have to sink 5 points in a talent to do it (and given most non PA people I feel have a higher chance of being range weapon players means endurance tends to not be a highly sought after stat for them as far as perk card swapping goes when outside of nuke zones and makes it still have a cost as such).
---
its legs
---
Actually my Perk is a double-star one. That‚Äôs what makes it annoying.
---
Yup - only have the Clown Wendigo is the only one on my list atm
---
Just in case you (or anyone else) doesn't know, when you're trying to craft something at a workbench, you'll see the option to tag the materials you're missing. Then you'll see a magnifying glass when you look at pieces of junk you need out in the world. 
---
If you were wearing starched genes lvl 2 it shouldn‚Äôt have happened. I‚Äôve never had this issue. If you use rad-x it will suppress the mutations and they won‚Äôt work for an hour or something like that. 
---
It would be nice to have more junk stash.  I keep a specific amount of each.  But have to throw away some to make space.  Few hours later I need that junk and need to go looting again for it. 
---
Instead of limiting resources they should up the amount of enemies.  I'd rather use that on shooting things and having fun than rummaging through bins like a rat.
---
&gt;in 
---
I don't think it's behind. This is also not a bash to this game. It's the status where I am now. But it could be easily changed with a few things Bethesda could announce. 
---
What gear did you use to stay stealthed?  
---
If they go hostile i just shoot them all. 
---
commenting for later
---
Any skins? Or just camp stuff?
---
I think after you have done it there 20 times, the lore starts to wear off. I think its a good idea to add some variability to the game. Fissures obviously connect to some underground source of ultracite, so why is it so hard to believe that all the fissures might ultimately connect underground to the glassed cavern? Scorchbeasts already spawn from all the fissures, why not the queen?
---
Crystal clear.
---
Denial and ignorance are not valid defences.
---
Nah, you can keep posting as many negative opinions as you like if it makes you feel better.  You just sound redundant, that's all.
---
Nice! Those were the only 2 I needed. 
---
That‚Äôs odd. I do not have any weight reduction armor anymore to check myself. 
---
Lol along with all the thousands of other requests. I think people are just too much. They want this and that and then they get mad when they forgot to add something...
---
This is about new content tho.. and they patched a lot in the game, I don‚Äôt think you get that it‚Äôs time consuming to path servers and make them as smooth as they are today. I‚Äôm defending the poor devs who were forced to make the game the way is was, and now have to clean up the whole damn mess. And now you have the player base angry, but like don‚Äôt act like they don‚Äôt see it or that they can address every desire...
---
Good question. The whole 73 yo retired marine kinda hooks you and makes you think it'll be a legit post by an adult, maybe that's what they were going for. Maybe the guy knew people would subconsciously respect that and used it to dupe us into siding with him and then flipping it on us.
---
Internet being what it is, we shall never know!
---
PSA: Soups work fine with the carnivore perk.
---
I totally agree but the game could give me 100+ more hours with a few adjustments and the announce of new stuff I mentioned.
---
I could be wrong here, but I THINK you're taking it a little too seriously.
---
My wife and I got robbed of 1k+ caps worth of bulk junk yesterday because we traveled to Vault 76 and immediately got pummeled by a lvl 130 who killed us without our pvp consent. I tried to reason with him to get it back but I didnt have anything he wanted. My point is, part of the game is being subjected to abuse from other players at ANY TIME. If you can't handle that, you can't handle the wasteland.
---
I‚Äôm level 163
---
The geographic location of the brotherhood bases  and origin point of the scortched invasion is referenced by notes and holotapes of all the other major factors, and even the brotherhood references the main nest and the prewar research facility (that probably caused this mess) being southeast of watoga. 
---
Not sure about combat effectiveness, but Marsupial makes the exploration game a whole lot more fun. Bethesda has hidden lots of things in places that you pretty much need this mutation (or a jetpack, I suppose) to get to. 
---
Here's a fun one in Morgantown, for instance:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Roof\_climber%27s\_poem](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Roof_climber%27s_poem)
---
I can neither confirm nor retort to this. I haven't been there to farm ore, but it is now on my radar.
---
As a heavy weapons main...i go through metals like they are going out of style. 
---
Then you‚Äôd have to raise weapon and armor caps to 75 as well
---
Hi, i am glad to know that there other fellow Singaporean who plays fallout 76 i am curious, did you experienced any ping lag playing fallout 76?
---
Yeah sorry didn't read through it a second time
---
Hmm now that you mention it, might have been just the hat 
---
It probably wouldn‚Äôt be as much of a problem if I wasn‚Äôt constantly focusing on flexibility over everything else. I enjoy having mats stockpiled for when I need them, but the stash limits (although much better than 400) still have me going nuts, probably because of the usual psychological need to hoard while playing a fallout game (even though this one‚Äôs a much different one which I understand)
---
I actually had a friend quit because he was unwilling to let go of the 2k gunpowder he had amassed. I‚Äôm not that extreme, but the urge to hoard and not let go is still strong
---
Then everyone would have pretty much essentially similar builds, I think the amount of SPECIAL points we have now is sufficient. Probably unpopular opinion though.
---
Seriously though, I have always felt the same way about post apocolyptic situations. Besides the scorched, what is cannon for zombie apocolypse invites the Godhood having something to hold this stupid mindless melee machine away from your body and a stab over the rim (aim and stability going into zombie skulls) 
---
Watching the walking dead for the first few seasons and the whole time im thinking is "bullshit the first person with a sword wins" then FINALLY Michone is introduced and as expected swords rule, but then was when I REALLY didn't understand the lack of riot shields being used by the survivors until the prison, then YESSS and they used it EXACTLY like it would be and OMG LOOK IT WORKS, but what to they leave behind in that damned place? And the armor, because you know its ok if they bite a little right?
---
Sarcasm insider here?
---
What a sentence to take out of context
---
DayZ did it for a short while. Turned your skin into a bandit for a long while after you killed another player. But they had plans to remove that feature when I last played.
---
Lost my Instigating three star fireaxe to a vendor, and a very old non-leg handmade when I was leveling to Mama Dolce's. Loved that thing, was great for going into lower level areas to farm whatever.
---
Never spam anything. Not selling, not dropping, not trading.
---
I wish we could lvl them up.
---
What I wanted really was "DayZ: Fallout edition."
---
There isnt really that big of a punishment for dying, so people just stack thousands of resources and dupe TSE shotguns and theres no way to counter it. 
---
If you could kill someone and punish them for taking out their TSE, but at the same time reward them for taking the risk in the first place. 
---
But that's none of my business.
---
The scorched beast landed a few times but Graham did most of the damage. I'm a stealth sniper build so I didn't do much damage as I couldnt really hide from the scorchbeast. It always knows where I am when it gets close. Plus I was only level 36 at the time. I switched to Gauss rifle and even picked up missile launcher from dead super mutants but still couldn't hurt the beast that much. 
---
Posting this, in this subreddit, is a waste of time since everyone can't seem to understand that this is not your typical Fallout game. Rather than posting suggestions, making them about improving the experience, while maintaining game balance, they will instead make impulsive suggestions that leads to making the game easier. Most of these suggestions are coming from people who haven't spent enough time in the game to have a valid point, while others with the same mindset agree with them.
---
It's kinda crazy how tough ballistic is to get. Half the time when I go to ft defiance, everything's been looted.
---
Another tip to get ballistic fiber easy is to buy it at the robot vendors. It's expensive, but every once in a while i'll buy some in bulk after selling off a bunch of stuff at different vendors.
---
Duping, cheat software, having any dev room items, there‚Äôs a really good list of reasons to get banned. And anybody who is banned will never admit why. If they genuinely got banned and don‚Äôt know why, my assumption is that they had a dev item
---
A realistic camp build could be interesting.  Only allows yourself a tent, campfire for cooking a bed and stash box.  Only use world crafting benches and water sources. 
---
That's true. My opinion here is a more single than Multiplayer. I only discovered this game alone. 
---
Laughs in assassin sentinel 
---
&gt;I don't see a future path with PvP as long as Bethesda is so quick to respond with heavy nerfs.
---
Well it's kind of paradoxal, PvP will do benefit the most from the heavy nerfs of overpowered legendary armors &amp; weapons. There's no doubt PvP could be more enjoyable and fair without almost immortal players (assassin's paired with sentinel's) or without weapons able to OHKO anyone who don't own assassin's paired with sentinel's armors.
---
&gt; The TSE nerf is only the beginning, just wait until the guys with a full set of sentinel unyielding armor start winning all of the PvP battles or the guys with 5 mutations. 
---
Yeah if Bethesda don't want to separate the balance from PvP and PvE it is what will most likely happen.
---
&gt; It's going to be a never ending nerf train. What's the point of grinding in a loot game for top tier gear when it's likely to be nerfed? 
---
Is is indeed an issue, I know soon or later the legs I have farmed / seeked so hard might become useless because I am seriously overpowered although if it is nerfed to match i.e. the difficulty of a raid so I can't cheese throught it I think it is fair. Same for PvP tbh.
---
Shit code is shit game.  You only need to look back at the old school era of 8 bit dev to see how they creatively got around limitations and produced fantastic new methods.
---
Personally i don't use any weight reduction perks other than bandolier(purely because i use alot of 5mm and it only takes up 2 skill points), i found that if you force yourself to not use them you eventually just get used to it. 
---
So my personal advice is to try it, get rid of all your weight reduction perks and you will see you have so many points available to use on what you want, if anything has been in your stash for more than a week and you haven't used it get rid of it, only keep 5 drinks and food, get rid of ammo you don't need. Invest in sunkissed and photosynthetic, or even get the healing factor mutation which regenerates health when not in combat.
---
The added thing is in-game Chads are probably virgins IRL and just happy to be feared and respected for once in their lives.
---
The pacifists are usually older and have responsibilities and can't devote the time ( and money for TSEs) to be powerful enough to raid.
---
And don‚Äôt let one dick wad use up all the budget. Same budget per person but let people snap stuff to other people‚Äôs stuff, etc. EPIC TREE FORT
---
Do you know how many stim packs I've wasted trying to switch weapons? 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Right as long as the game costs money.
---
If it goes FtP who know what could happen?
---
Why put perks like "homewrecker" in the game if it wasn't an intended mechanic? 
---
Curious, do you have more than one character? Terminals was the last trophy I needed for the platinum and it didn't pop till something like 64 terminals, but I had more than one character so I was wondering if perhaps it was a matter of it needing to be 50 terminals on a single character. 
---
It isn‚Äôt a bad idea, just an unnecessary one. Just... scrap the junk. It takes less than a second, literally. Open bench, hit scrap all, confirm. It only takes longer than a second if you have beer bottles and such that need to be scrapped manually.
---
Yes that's it gah I have not touched dayz after they announced the stand alone.
---
What about the crossbow? I ask only because i have quite a few bolts already. 
---
I would love to build at white powder winter sports
---
I will say that I had to do Breach and Clear twice - the first time, I did the whole thing and it didn't pop, whereas the second, I basically popped in on the last 30 seconds and got it. The event-related trophies seem a bit more finnicky than others. 
---
I feel you on the weight reduction perks, I've got thru hiker maxed out so I can carry 20 cans of dog food and 20 water with me everywhere and not worry about it.  
---
The game needs a better inventory management system though, since it's hard to tell what's really taking up my weight. Is it the 40 diluted rad-away or the 6 missiles in my inventory? 25 rad-X or 20 grenades? Better just vendor it all to be safe.  
---
And of course I run into stupid amounts of radiation immediately after.
---
Thanks dude. I agree with u. The only possible reason I can come up with is the network lagging. Maybe I equipped my perk card but in fact it was not there, somehow.
---
To add to this, as a heavy weapons user 8k+ rounds on SBQ isn't unreasonable. Thats allota lead to sent that much hate.
---
It was started by one of the YouTubers that just say shit without evidence. Somebody said physical copies of 76 were getting pulled in Australia... Which leads to the "logical conclusion" the game is going free to play world wide for some reason. However a simple Google can negate the whole thing , but it's easier to let angry neckbeards think for you.

Since when do pens give springs?

They need to buff some legendary effects and nerf others. They need to fix duping. They need to make caps more worthwhile.
---
Other than that, I have my most fun trading with other players on the discords.
---
Things will improve, can't wait to see how crazy 5 stars get
---
why no PA? if it does not affect your build the excavator will make your life rainbows, i guess its a trade off personally i use it but kinda get bummed there are quite a few costumes and armor sets just to be stuck in PA
---
WE found the bethesdrone
---
Pack it up fellas
---
Yeah, thats not happening.
---
You should be scrapping down your junk into its component pieces. Not doing so is taking up extra weight in your inventory/stash.
---
I am pretty sure if they are just looking and numbers 30 is not going to be it, more like 30,000.  
---
   I can get to 60 strength in a group.
---
15 Base Strength.
---
20 Strength from unyielding armor with +1 str on each piece.
---
5 Strength from Radicool perk.
---
3 Strength can be gained during the day with Solar powered perk.
---
3 Strength while grouped from the herd mentality mutation.
---
3 Strength from Shielded Urban Operative underarmor.
---
6 Strength from whiskey with max Party Boy perk.
---
1 Strength on my weapon.
---
3 Strength from Deathclaw Wellington.
---
I just turned level 42 - started to play first of the year. I met up with a player who just started to play and was the same level. It just depends what you want out of the game. If you want to level and not explore, seems like Whitespring and events assist with that. I like to explore!!
---
I scrapped quite a few hoping there would be some mod. Being able to mod the signs would have been a nice little touch.
---
and while we're at it can the darn thing not just always be on as soon as it's powered? 
---
Not an hour but yeah that‚Äôs an effect of rad x.
---
try more along the lines of "wow this person had 30,000 small guns bobble heads"

Check out Adrenaline Rush and Tenderizer for damage multipliers

I am unable to answer that, we seem to put her down much faster when fewer people are involved.
---
Don‚Äôt really care tbh if I get down voted, I stick up to what I think is right and wrong. I am a war veteran and I honestly believe veterans with ptsd will find this post offensive.
---
I'm diggin it!  Especially you and another mentioning factions. Hadn't thought about that myself and think it'd be pretty cool to have them by faction with different looks and all.  Lol, a business indeed, if there were a functional nuke suit sold in the Atom store I bet they'd make a killing!
---
I believe you'll run into trouble killing endgame enemies. It looks like you have too much invested in strength -- considering it's not a core part of the build -- and not enough elsewhere. Additionally, rifles don't seem to be very effective without either crit or sneak (I personally use both) to me. However, you have more focus on rifle damage than I do, but I'm still worried for your future.
---
Here's my build (very similar to yours, but with sneak, VATS, crit): https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4c535cf&amp;d=s60sv0sw1p02pd0pk0pp2pl0e60ek1e00ef0pq1pj0c71ic4lr2l71l12li2lu2lv0a72ar2an2ao0a00a30&amp;w=pa0p80p90ej4ib4am2&amp;n=
---
It is very effective in that I can kill anything except SB, SBQ with a normal crafted rifle, I rarely get noticed in stealth, I have pretty good resists while in a nuke zone with certain perks on swap (shown in link), and I can focus more on shooting or explosives with intelligence swaps.
---
This build was very difficult before getting all the sneak perks (especially escape artist), however.
---
I don't think this will bode well. Considering how much fun people (even myself) had during the Wrath of the Lich King pre launch event with ghouls. Or even the Corrupted Blood incident from Vanilla. It won't be looked on as if a punishment.
---
It's still going to be the best baseline damage combo, it just won't blow everything out of the water like it does currently.
---
get out of my head....
---
Forget 3 stars.
---
You only need 1 effect, thats the "becomes harder to detect when sneaking"
---
Reglar armor works just fine too with proper mods. Muffled legs, ultra-lightweight everything else along with the "shadowed" modifier.
---
Boom. Nothing sees you ever.
---
I do. 
---
I was worried that was why.
---
Annoying thing is magazines was across 2 characters and that triggered normally.
---
Sounds like you really need to identify what you need and just leave that marked for search while you play.  Whenever you drop too low having everything you need already marked makes it a lot easier to find right away or allows you to basically be constantly restocking.  One of the biggest mindset changes for me was in this game was moving away from the "horde everything" mentality even though I still have issues occasionally.  Recently I actually had to drop almost 200 screws because they were taking up so much space.
---
Unfortunately I for this character I‚Äôm only wanting to be in PA for nuke zones, aside from that I‚Äôd rather be out of it because I‚Äôve noticed staying undetected is more difficult in power armor. Plus I only recently got calibrated shocks for x-01 so before I‚Äôd actually have less carry weight when in PA than when out of it (shielded lining underarmor strength bonuses don‚Äôt carry when you get into PA apparently)
---
I think the problem is more that in a setup with power attack on the attack button the type of attack would be determined upon release which would not work for guns so well. 
---
Hmm it's fine thanks for the help anyways i really appreciate it! Now i have got a grasp on how the server works in fallout 76 thanks pal!
---
It is the chicken that drops the legendary explosive drill.
---
Yeah, I'm getting crashes like it's no tomorrow. Is it happening at Whitesprings? Or just anywhere on the map?
---
He‚Äôs 88, maybe he‚Äôs taking it easy in his old age. I don‚Äôt know - has he done anything publicly lately? 
---
Some more relevant info to share... 
---
I checked the Order of Mysteries membership roster, there is no other members with the initials of O.R., so I don't think the dead OoM woman in Whitespring was the O.R. who terminated the lockdown.

2086 November was also when Olivia revealed her betrayal and killed Shannon, 5-6 months after O.R. terminated the lockdown - meaning Olivia was alive at that time, and also already became disillusioned and disgruntled, matching the tone of the terminal entry.

Yes, but imho there are a lot of false positives, and a bot that can't read context gets frustrating fast
---
This guy ideas.
---
How would that be like power armor? When you're in a frame, your equipped armor underneath the power armor provides no benefit.
---
I know, I hate the current weight sorting system. So difficult to figure out what the main culprits of my high carry weight are, it‚Äôs a pain to say the least
---
lol. Ad Victoriam!
---
I think maybe we should earn more Special points as we level... and then cap it somewhere?
---
Just a thought.... 
---
Maybe true but this is Reddit and you‚Äôre talking about probably less than 1% of all users.  To try and push that mentality into the rest of the world is going to be a large task. I‚Äôd recommend coming to terms with the fact that it is certainly a serious issue but its not something that others feel quite as strongly about or quite the same way you feel about it, that‚Äôs all. I still think if you asked a vet if they are more offended by ‚Äúold guy yelling at kids from porch‚Äù or ‚Äúgame that drops nukes on other players for fun‚Äù they would pick the second one almost every time. All in all i hope you know I mean no trolling, I just haven‚Äôt seen such an extreme reaction to the topic before. 
---
Do I have 400 cork? Or do I have a nice clean inventory with exactly every item I want, because I spent every minute of every day in my inventory screen? Again you're trying to convince me to like something I obviously don't. How much time do you spend trying to convince people to love Pepsi? Not winning any points here. I don't have to teach myself to enjoy things I don't like. Games serve one function to me, and that's entertainment. 
---
I half expect it to be continued in dlc 
---
Shhhhh... good for lockpicking practice too!
---
He wrote a poem called "For no clear reason" :)
---
I mean I've never had to really build ammo. The times I have were for shotgun shells and for 5.56. Everything else I always have stockpiles of because I pick so much up. But if I do need ammo I'll just claim the munitions plant. But if you do need lead I'd recommend sugar grove. I go there for springs and come out with like 100+ lead
---
In any zone, if the mobs werent previously spawned, they will spawn to the level of the player that spawned them.
---
The problem isnt that a lvl 20 can spawn a lvl 20 mob anywhere on the map, the issue is that the mobs dont despawn/reset when the lower lvl player leaves.
---
You have 3 major ways of dealing with different lvl players, in the same open multiplayer map.
---
1) level lock the zones, like in WoW. You know what to expect out of each zone, but there is little reason to return to said zone after your are above the lvl of the zone.
---
2) mobs only spawn at specific lvls and in specific places, like in Runescape. The downsides to this are you need a larger map to contain them all, and its easy for a low lvl player to walk into a high lvl area and get merc'd
---
3) mobs scale to the level of the player that spawned them, imo this is the best for fallout because we dont have a huge varied selection of mobs atm, in a better world the mobs would despawn when the player moves away and respawn when a new player approaches, this cant be any less server intensive than keeping mobs spawned in an area no player is in.
---
Hopefully you have starched genes 2 otherwise yes they will go 
---

---
I have about two hundred hours in this game and I still haven‚Äôt completed the challenge despite doing what it says many times
---
Seems there's almost no PVP events in games by now, don't really understand what are you dev. team huys doing?
---
Players who entering the end-game spent hours and nights just to get some powerful guns for sure, and ts guns still hard to get, not even talking about tse weapons. And you nerf it like nothing just because "It's too powerful in PVP"?  
---
There's ALMOST no PVP in the game, I repeat again. Because PVP is no fun and shitty in your game rule, and it's shitty for your wanted system as well.  
---
We can predict that you will nerf melee weapon also in sometime, because THEY ARE TOO POWERFUL IN ANY SITUATION.   
---
I suggest you guys better BUFF your brains first. They seem don't work well and idle from the game-making process till now. You are the SHAME of the brand and Fallout IP.
---
Or a Millisloth.
---
&gt;there‚Äôs a really good list of reasons to get banned
---
Moreover, this list exists only in the heads of the developers and the players are not informed of it. Tomorrow they will decide that %SOME\_DEVELOPER\_TOOL% is also used for cheating and will distribute bans.
---
i fount a terminal entry somewhere in the bunker between modus and the west coast Enclave AI where it seemed like the WC AI was losing it's shit, maybe Modus intentionally failed to make contact?
---
My memory is pretty foggy on the FO Lore re the Enclave but i'm sure it's a great easter egg  for someone more in the loop. 
---
I agree it would be really nice, my first explo was a lvl 15 SMG (I was above lvl 50 when I got it) I wish it could've matched my level.
---
Nah that's just the stuff you do once you finish doing the main quest as a way to get good loot. You don't really have to do it to enjoy the game. A tip is to try avoiding whitesprings if you see high level players there because they will spawn high level enemies.
---
Oh wow
---
Very very bad idea.
---
The fact that the character growth caps at 50 is the sole bright spot at the whole game design of Fallout 76.
---
I have character lvl 192 as my main.
---
If I had 75 points of special I would never needed to respec. Ever. 
---
It wouldn't surprise me if they nudge up the SPECIAL and weapon / armor levels at some point - seems like it would be a natural evolution of the game as it ages. One other thing they could do is to make some of the perks passive, or allow you to switch easily from a Crafting to a Combat perk build via templates or saved builds. 
---
What flashlight?

In the future drop a single piece of ammo or something else that isn‚Äôt important to make sure the bag spawns, then it‚Äôll be safe to drop anything. This bug has been around for 76‚Äôs whole life and still not fixed... sucks when you‚Äôre not aware of how to control it.
---
Ahh. The other side of the train station is home to Uranium Fever, where farmers go to play between whitesprings nukes. I am guessing they're being d-bags or weapon testing on his stuff.
---
Sounds like you're near a farm spot as well (deathclaws for black titanium, if I recall). I've also heard a LOT more complaints about community from PS4 players.
---
Personally, I tend to live in the mid-mire or near it in the great divide. Good for fast travel, very few visitors.

I cripple them all and lead them around in a shuffling Parade of Losers.
---
That‚Äôs not exactly what he was showing you. There are 3 types of rifleman cards, the first star in each gives you 10%. Then +5 for each star afterwards. So to balance that out, unless you really need max dps, put the 3 1-stars on for that 30% boost because it takes 6 more cards for the next 30%. The game won‚Äôt let you put duplicate cards on (ie. 3 1-star expert rifleman).
---
I really want this! Within my first day of playing with friends we wanted to combine CAMPs. Not sure how they would go about implementing this sort of thing with the current CAMP system but I think they could make something work. I think dedicated servers or the option to rejoin a server will need to be implemented first to make this happen.
---
I hope so. Must have been recent since it happened to me in the past week
---
The cynic in me says "so that it can be add-on content later."
---
what level was the armor?  level 1 right?
---
atomic shop, probably they just added it
---
so what you're saying is:
---
"he won't say that ORANGE MAN IS BAD, so therefore he isn't tough"?
---
Funniest weapon imo
---
AA stands for Anti Armour, and the Enclave tag is a user flair, you can add one if you go back to the main r/fo76 screen and look at your user on the right, underneath it says add user flair. 
---
But what about herbivore I was thinking about getting? 
---
Well they could increase CAMP budget by like 500% and let people actually build defenses. Or lower the cost of turrets by like 500%.
---
Except, I don't know why. If ppl already got caught, they should just say so.
---
&gt; Hazmat gives Rad resist with no armor, power armor gives armor + rad resist.
---
And power armor players pay for that benefit by not getting legendary power armor. Power armor would be worthless if you could equip a full set of legendary basic armor underneath a Hazmat suit (which provides a ton more radiation resistance than power armor, in case you didn't know).
---
&gt; I feel the biggest argument for the hazmat suit is there is a large group of people that don't like power armor but want to do endgame, there should be SOME method for them to do nuke zones
---
If you build around it, you can absolutely run around in nuke zones with just a Hazmat suit. Even at like level 20 I was running around Whitesprings in just a Hazmat suit and tanking ghouls easily thanks to Blocker. If you add in armor perks like Ironclad or Barbarian as well as mutations like Scaly Skin and flat damage reduction from something like Blocker or Lone Wanderer, you can absolutely be fine in just a Hazmat suit.
---
Well, if this was Anet, players would also be banned for receiving duped items. Not saying this is the case here, but anything is possible along with a lot of players claim to have done nothing but been banned. Heck there have even been time when anti cheat systems have wrongly reported people. 
---
Didn't even need to click the link to know it was Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies
---
came across the same thing at the same place last weekend!
---
I‚Äôm level 90 n still getting shit drops. I have two 3 star legendary dropped items. Marine chest armor n a hunters meat hook. I am at the point I‚Äôve received the same 1 star dropped from a 3 star enemy the day after I sold that same exterminator left arm combat armor. I‚Äôve killed my fair share of 3 star legendary creatures throughout the map, nuke zones, whitesprings etc. The drops are fucked n need to be fixed. 
---
Unlikely. I have everything in Int maxed, but still 0/7.
---
It'd be nice to e able to play while still interacting with the community 
---
Actually if they insist on keeping the base making it more of a pressure plate , so that it only powers on when standing on it, would be a cool alternative aswell 
---
It‚Äôs pretty at night. üôÇ
---
The bans are not for duping people. They‚Äôre for having things like cheat engine open whilst running the game. Even if Bethesda themselves said they were banning duper‚Äôs, I wouldn‚Äôt believe it. If they did do that? They would get destroyed.
---
Oof I was going to ask you if you wanted to team up because I started a new character, but I'm on my PC. Do you have any specific questions tho.
---
I'm not your buddy, pal
---
I was going to defend this as reasonable due to the input of trigger press versus release of trigger as the point an attack was determined. 
---
And then I thought of the Gauss rifle which determines the power of its attack at time of release. 
---
Of course the animation might still be on input press versus release but... does anyone know if others can see a charging gauss or Tesla weapon?
---
I tried doing that. The problem happens when they continually respawn and things like the turrets don't ever truly "die". They go dormant for a few min then fire back up at full health to blast away. Worst part is all that you get for your troubles is wasted ammo. No xp no drops no nothing. 
---
Terrain Ownership Within New States
---
I was looking back at the creation club on Fo4 and you can find a paint pack with 11 skins in it for 8 bucks.
---
I would argue that the purpose of homewrecker is for the purpose of making stealing workshops easier. Not soley for the purpose of destroying people's construction.
---
Could be they just want to experience the game without help, or its a second character, or they don't trust strangers in power armor.  Maybe try helping players a little higher level, like 20s?  You could always just leave stuff in the overseers cache too
---
I‚Äôve definitely experienced quite a few laggy times for sure, but I‚Äôm unsure if they are server wide or only for me. But nothing too unplayable, usually when it happens, I just server hop to find a more stable server. Hope this helps! 
---
That's quite annoying. Turn in one at a time I understand, but gathering no more than one? That's just annoying given how rare they are. 
---
Too many. But thank you for the help anyway. How do you know you have a legendary weapon? The star? 
---
or the fire breathers
---
That's literally lag.
---
Thank you.  
---
It's bad, but not as bad as "exit powersuit" and "drop item" being the same button.  Lost a motion assisted power torso last night because I tried to get out of my power armor with my pipboy up.  No bag, just plain lost it.
---
Plenty of events drop legendaries via legendary enemies. Uranium fever, AWOL armaments, enemy horde events
---
Marsupial is something to consider, reduces your int but does give an extra 20 carry weight.
---
Me too.  More than once with different wendigos. It completed then came back
---
I think people want a product that works.  At the moment the game is beta at best.  These fixes should have been implemented before the games launch.  Right now these fixes are taking away from new content being released.  
---
Heck, the latest patch added new bugs which is going to take more time to fix.  Time that could have been spent on qol and new features.  The product was rushed out before the holidays and should have been delayed.  You literally cannot defend that.
---
more like bullshit rumor
---
Thats where I setup my camp as well
---
Were those new mutations or had you relogged since getting them and adding the perk?
---
I think I've seen claims of newly ranked perks sometimes being bugged until a relog, but can't find where I saw it.
---
I have my own mutations to look after so I want to know every detail of how not to lose them.
---
This works with latest game client version? I have GTX 970 and i get sick by Medium Texture quality. Looks terrible.
---
Great write-up and feedback.  
---
&gt; I would do this from the map. When the player hovers over the event, it should load a timer which shows how much time is left on the objective.
---
I would add to this, where the progress is.  Some events have a long timer, but the event can be completed rather quickly.  i.e. powering posiden  
---
"Sweet there is 20 min left, ahh but they are at 95% complete."
---
It's probably a combination of all those things. Some people want to have that struggle in the beginning, some people are extremely paranoid. 
---
I'm only level 33 and have lower level players run from me and I'm just trying to drop a few purified waters. If I do get them to realize what I'm doing they always act really nervous then run away as fast as they can. 
---
I have had high levels 100+ give me a hard time before so I understand being wary. Also that trade glitch thing that was going around probably doesn't help. There's so many negative stories and rumors online. 
---
There's a "team up" emote in your emote wheel.
---
true. the thing makes you sound like a freaking transformer running around. 
---
armor all unequips with PA so no bonuses, you only keep some clothing undegarments. Excavator armor has +100 carry weight (i know its old news), maybe you can keep it in your inventory at 10lb until you need the extra space? 
---
missiles, mini nukes, 40mm grenades weigh a shit ton, lose those
---
I don't remember reading that. But there was one where modus was talking with the raven rock AI (who became Eden from 3). And they were having an unusual discussion about things and it seemed modus was perturbed by how eden was acting. 
---
&gt;Annoying thing is magazines was across 2 characters and that triggered normally.  
---
Yep, noticed that too, which is why I wasn't sure why terminals would possibly be set to be on one character (though the clear answer is it was an oversight - just like a lot of other things, lol). 
---
He likely just spammed stimpaks. I usually always wait until i'm 25% or less in health before I use stimpaks. And I usually just spam them until my health is full as they stack for faster healing.  Unless you have real good DPS it's real easy to manage. Sounds like he was doing that to be honest. I carry 30 stimpaks or so usually and have never needed close to all of them to kill any players
---
CHEMS change capacity - my base carrying weight is 326 in excavator but after taking 5-6 chems last night i got it up to 455, i forget which ones but they do help.
---
I totally didn't know there were legendaries in that event. I did see some glowing enemies with green smoke. I'll keep an eye out from now on so I don't 1-hit them if there are other people in the event.

---
I'd just heard from a couple different places that it was possible that it was going FtP. It's a possibility, even though a small one
---
I really like this idea!
---
Worked for me.
---
Had to clean it up afterwards, mind -- for the next "customer".
---
I guess so yeah. Just feels disappointing vut good idea. I thought up to level 10 would be better as their perks and playstyle wouldn't necessarily be determined by then.
---
But I have offered higher level players (20+) help with quests and gear too.
---
Just sucks trying to do good and getting nowhere lol.
---
I believe veterans that support freedom of speech will find your posts offensive.  If you want censorship you should have fought for the Chinese.
---
If you're on PS4 I can jump in and help.  One level 100 and I've  killed that thing for several friends getting their excavator gear.  I'd recommend having all the black titanium and other components so you can do it in one visit but pm me and I'll give you my tag 
---
Yea I didnt figure it out to lvl 100+ after I got tired of swapping lockpick in and out.
---
You're absolutely correct, Sharpshadow. But this is their subreddit so obviously there are going to be quite a few delusional fans coping with their 60 dollar purchase.

Did you get your food buff from doritos and mountain dew? +5 to troll stat

I never said it was concrete, I do admit, I should have put 'If it goes FtP'
---
What‚Äôs the build? This is so awesome. I want my toon like this 
---
Oh I know I have too much of everything. I have about 10 materials marked. 
---
I just hate the feeling of getting low. So I‚Äôd rather have way too much of everything. I have like 500 screws and springs right now, with 400 adhesive;  and loads of everything else. 
---
I can‚Äôt have any other weapon or armors in my stash because of it lol. I‚Äôm the kind of guy who will play the same build for years, that doesn‚Äôt bother me. The comfort of knowing I never have to worry about getting low on supplies is what I need. 
---
When I say I want more stash space too, I mean for even more junk. Lol. 
---
Lost my first power armor to this.  Jumped in, ran around a bit and everything was great.  Fast traveled and whoops PA gone.  It didn't get left behind, I went back and checked, so it just disappeared.  This was on PC and just after beta though I haven't been so unlucky since.
---
I experience this sometimes and it's lag. Yeah this specific game lags more than others, are you new? 
---
Happy cake day

Marsupial mutation helps a little bit, and you could wear excavator 24/7, which probably isn't a desirable situation...
---
It‚Äôs a thin line between what simply couldn‚Äôt make the deadline and what is purposely set aside to create revenue down the road.  Considering how unfinished 76 was/is if it did become DLC I‚Äôd wager it‚Äôs the former not the latter.

&gt; Other than that, I have my most fun trading with other players on the discords. 
---
I'm not gonna lie, trading with other players is what hooked me to the game the most even despite all the mess with duping. Had a lot of fun building a shop to meet up with buyers for trading subs too.
---
Here is enough atoms to buy a single door. Enjoy.
---
As a old coot... all i can say is...
---
GET OFF MY LAWN!!!
---
maybe that's the one i was thinking of. The raven rock AI was talking about "reading" the Abe Lincoln biography over and over and over?
---
Vendor cost is 800. But I'm sure we can make a deal, yeah? I got a few other things to trade, like the special Nuka Colas
---
I cried
---
Not with that attitude. 
---
It is though?  I have one card fully maxed and just one in another level.  So swapping to individual cards before adding more to their levels is going to increase my damage output.  That's what I was saying and I after rereading the comment I'm still pretty sure that's what a good part of the comment was about.  I do appreciate you clarifying that you can't stack the same perk card over and over though.  That's a good point.
---
lmao
---
Hope we'll find someone (NPC) alive in one of those vaults when they opened, and even better if one of them would be a former OoM members.  Assuming they were about 20 years old by 2086 (when OoM's story kind of ended with the final showdown of Olivia &amp; Shannon - per current available info in FO76), they would be around 36 by 2102.  
---
Nah I been playing for like 2 months. Although that's coming to an end especially after seeing this video lol.
---
Unfortunately it is part of the game for better or worse. I had someone stacking bobble heads and chems and 1 shot me while I was in passive mode. I ended up finding his base a few days ago just happened to be server hopping and noticed him in the same one...and leveled it, all the metal walls, everything I'm sure a decom shower was apart of it. He killed me but I kept coming back, was a good revenge. Subsequently ended up breaking his X01 legs. I hope they keep it in, sometimes it makes for the best revenge against trollers. I don't think it would be fair if you had a bounty and could just hide out in a invincible camp or camps that are set up outside the golf course and steal kills from people.
---
Another thing that happens is if a player gets a bounty and knows where your camp is, they will hide in it in hope of other players try to destroy it but get a bounty instead.  
---
Your camp was just out in the open and convenient maybe?  Could be bored players as well.
---
I get what you're saying, and I agree. But for now I just block them and go about my day. 
---
I believe that the problem with adding this to the game is (at least on PC) you can very easily swap an Photo Mode images with images of your own. 
---
This would almost certainly lead to people adding their own custom images to their Gallery and the possibility of porn and other undesirable images.
---
Even if the modified the way that your photos were stored and saved I'm sure it wouldn't be hard for people to find ways to add their own custom images shortly after.
---
Great idea and it would be awesome so easily share our best photos, but I feel it would be too risky..
---
Well I don't know about you but the two times I got a bounty on me it was for stealing from a safe in a workshop I didn't know was already claimed and I don't think I made it more than 5 minutes before I got nuked by some level 200 dude with a missile launcher. People give a shit.
---
I think it may be caused by the network lagging. The perk card was quipped but it was not working somehow. But another player told me that it may be a bug which Bethesda claimed had be fixed. You know, there are many bugs that still exist though fixed in Bethesda‚Äôs announcements.(His Opinion)
---
on PC, open up your map, then the menu for the map (default is Z, I think). There is a tab called Challenges. Go into that and hover over "Daily" and "Weekly" to see what's on for the day/week.
---
This post is stupid. We all know the material will be pleather, not nylon.
---
No this sounds like a pretty serious bug, not something that just needs to be worked around like the low stash weight.
---
I usually just drop stuff on the ground and shine my pip boy on it, or shoot at it, waiting around to see if they loot anything. If they do I move on, if not, I pack it up and move on to the next lowbie
---
I'd like to see real differences in different suits of power armor. As it stands the only one significantly different than the others is excavator.  Perhaps I would be happier with PA if the stash was big enough I didn't need to wear calibrated shocks exclusively
---
Nope!
---
I think this would be great dlc for the future where players can have a faction and build a fortress that others can visit and buy items where you are logged in or not.
---
Throw a point into cannibal and you won't need to carry so much food or use multiple perk points for food weight reduction. Damn near everything in the game is edible other than the robots.
---
Hope it‚Äôll help^^ 
---
Refreshing. This post made me smile and read it over again. I agree completely. 
---
&gt;	And giving players incentive to defend their base would help as well.
---
Makes sense, as being pulled out of whatever they‚Äôre doing to defend a settlement is what people loved the most about FO4...
---
There is also a military ammo bag in the back of an APC outside the Watoga Civic Center.
---
Yeah I guess you're right. Just feels disheartening wanting to help but no one wants said help.
---
The griefing life is just not in my nature. IRL as well.
---
I also can't stop doing this.
---
I remember the marketing for that game, it seemed like it would be incredible. Another bomb was Homefront. I still can't believe I paid full price for that. 
---
I feel the same about crafting ones. There should be more slots or different "decks" for different aspects of the game. I shouldn't have to micromanage cards all the time based on different tasks. 
---
Well this game is unstable, is all I'm saying. Once you do everything enough it'll be on the back burner anyhow. I'm just collecting outfits and trading weapons at this point.
---
Legendary items have prefixes like vampire, vanguard, etc. That's usually the easiest way to identify them, but you can also tell by the star that's at the end of the name. You can check how many stars it is by seeing them next to the item stats. Each star is basically an individual effect that you can check when you examine the weapon. To get three star legendaries you have to kill three star enemies for a chance to get one, but it can also drop items with one/two stars. The best places to farm these are nuke zones, whitesprings golf club, and events like uranium fever. For your level you can also specifically try the event leader of the pack that appears north west of the vault near the ferris wheel.
---
this happened to me, had to put all my junk in my stash and then i was able to craft them. BUT then i went to put my x01 calibrated shocks on and they were gone.... about 4 hours of server hopping in and still havent seen another set. 
---
Am I the only one still having this issue ?
---
It may have been PTSD from other games. I know it is for me. I give a lot of older players a wide berth simply out of paranoia 
---
 Very good short stories 
---
My camp fast travel once dropped me through the ground, it respawned me back in the regular world after I fell a bit.
---
Ah okay, that makes much more sense. I could totally get behind it
---
I don't have pictures or anything, but yesterday I ran Fertile Soil and received a level 50 Vanguard's combat armor chest piece as a reward.
---
Or maybe you should stop being a smart ass and speak clearly. But it‚Äôs too late! 
---
I‚Äôve already lost interest in what you have to say. 
---
Good day. 
---
I had a few rad storms on the weekend, Xbox One.
---
If you're at 19 hp, because something gives you a bonus of 20 hp, when it wears off, you should die.  
---
If I am missing something and the numbers aren't there, then yes, it should be fixed.
---
I‚Äôd like it a lot more if it didn‚Äôt stutter the entire time I played it. It‚Äôs bad. I like the game and all but good lord it doesn‚Äôt run well on my Xbox. 
---
I‚Äôm hoping they do something like this down the road.
---
urAAAAAAANIUM
---
Once you complete "Major for a Day" the robots in Watoga ignore you and you can destroy them to get free lead and aluminum. They also keep respawning if you are near one of those cylinder containers.
---
That sounds like something a synth would say, guy
---
Do you need full excavator for this to work?
---
No sorry. I dropped it cos I had better gattling. 
---
76 is just premature. I'm hopeful for the next patch release and the content they've talked about for the future.
---
I grind whitesprings alot, in game name is gingerbuddha.  I'll start saving if u like
---
It's fear. They don't know if it's a trap, or if you're going to follow them to their base to destroy it. I'm only level 65 but have started doing random acts of kindness. Find a lower level player hanging out in a spot on the map where you know they're at camp. Travel over, plop down a fusion generator and a decontamination shower. Hook up the power, maybe add a few water purifiers if they need it, give them a thumbs up and walk away. It's even better if you find a random camp with no one around. Add the stuff and disappear. I can only imagine their reaction when they come back and see it. 
---
The challenges have been bugged from the beginning. I'm hoping they fix it soon. 
---
I have several challenges not registering properly and it's frustrating. 
---
Write more stories 
---
&gt;	Thus the difference between a role player and a griefer. 
---
Generally, the difference exists only in their own minds, and is entirely indiscernible to third parties. 
---
No, just while you or a teammate have it on. There's a bug where the effects are given to team members
---
Must be your luck I experience both of the weathers you mentioned occasionally but they seem rare
---
Just a reskin. I have them 
---
 I'm curious too, if they do that then here I come! 
---
yea if any changes are made, they need to make alot of stronger mobs, and not just bullet sponge stronger but some interesting type of stuff.
---
speed deamon, eagle eyes and marsupial are my obvoius choice.  
---
very important mutations for VATS/Crit/sneak  
---
I just found myself alone in the server haha. Somehow there were no other players for hours. kind of bug I guess.
---
Hahaha I had to dump I think 270 abesto's the other day.  No matter how hard I try I always end up with some random item taking up the bulk of my inventory.  I get that feeling though.  Dropping those screws was one of the hardest decisions I've made in a Fallout game quests included.  It's a losing battle but I prefer running around without power armor and hate being over encumbered so I have to always make sure I have space.
---
I think that's it. He enjoyed it and was asking modus what he enjoyed doing. Makes sense considering how he became Eden. 
---
Yeah I think people will go play RDR Online. And Anthem, and Division 2, and Outer Worlds. And the PR shills are doing a great job with they downvoting any descent. It's really a good way to relate with the public. With customers some of whom paid over $100 for the product. Bully them if they say anything you don't like.
---
Satirical stories 
---
I agree. Reddit doesn‚Äôt have a live stream or that would be amazing. 
---
It should be more stable on PC, and they've fixed some bugs. That said, honestly, if you can wait, I'd wait until the first actual content drop. The big issues should be fixed by then.
---
Sure thing, 11 day old account with -10 karma.
---
A+ /r/GameDev comments, would chuckle again.
---
That is ridiculous. I'm only out of my power armor to craft so I don't notice anything like that.
---
West tek, kill all the mutants take all their guns.. pop on scrapper and break em down. I get a couple hundred steel a run there.
---
..order https://youtu.be/IGdrRD4Dq6M
---
And therein lies the rub: a lot of traditional, single player Fallout fans don't want PvP, multiplayer people coming in do, and trying to get the two to coexist together and *enjoy themselves* is an exercise in futility.
---
Bugs, duping, crashes, stash sizes, etc. are a problem, but this is one of the biggest ones, IMO.
---
I'd use prime receiver rather than scorched-killer.  My main uses prime 2-shot combat rifle and anti-armor handamade which are of course very helpful to deal with SBs.
---
You've never heard of someone being salty because they're upset or annoyed by something?
---
At least it's not made with murdered animal.
---
https://youtu.be/IGdrRD4Dq6M
---
Except that the bonus is an addition to max hp. If my usual max go is 200, I currently have 40 and I‚Äôve taken a chem that adds 50 for a maximum of 250, I shouldn‚Äôt die when it wears off because it should only take away from the maximum, as in from 250 to 200. My current health isn‚Äôt above 200 so current health should be unaffected.
---
I can't even see the event on my map without singing it, regardless of whether I'm taking part or not
---
Lol that's lit
---
Indeed, Chaddie boy!
---
Hasn't been nerf'd yet lol
---
Patch 5 , end of the month - TS reduced from +100% to +25%
---
and E - now adding +20% of the base weapon damage with explosive radius damage instead of +100%.
---
you should just get the perk that gets rid of most of the negative effects. marsupial's penalty only ends up being -1 int at that point.
---
He's bobblehead glitching or you did something to trigger PvP.
---
Bobblehead glitching somehow still ain't fixed
---
It‚Äôs not even about it being hard. It‚Äôs easy, just incredibly annoying and unnessecary. I like the idea of loadouts.
---
Some how i got pvp flagged, I believe from a player walking through me as I was swing my sledge. I didn't really think of it and I was flagged for at least 2 days, ran into a number of people. The player who kills me was from behind while i was searching a chest. I think this was cowardly done for 10 caps. First time dealing with someone on the pc platform. Guess I need to be more careful while swinging my sledge :P
---
No. The game was intended as Co OP PVE with opt in PvP. The core of the game was meant to be people cooperating.
---
The griefing in most games is accommodated with the "play as you want" mantra but all that boils down to is griefers are welcome and their game play experience is  more  valuable than the people wanting the core experience, you know the story line and such. And forcing everyone to play as the griefers want. 
---
I got the lifetime founder pack for Hellgate.  Game failed after a few months lol
---
I always keep this one in my inventory 
---
Once a product has any of the Atom shop paints, its no longer trade-able. You cannot drop the item into a container either.
---
It's a shame, as this would make a great in-game economy thing. Someone could sell their custom painted items, to those who don't want to invest in the Atoms but want some of the customizations. Yes, I realize that the whole purpose is to sell Atoms, but still... it would be nice to share your "knowledge" of crafted items.
---
Totally wasn't thinking, sorry about that.
---
A radiated Goonies favorite.
---
I am on console but that gives me an idea where to look, thank you!
---
Folks keep screaming about how this game is "too easy."  Increasing SPECIAL would just make it that much easier
---
I understand it as a balance mechanic to keep people from having flying bases, but they really didn't learn from fallout 4's construction system.
---
100 percent of the construction system should be an extension of the freedom the player has to create their own personal space. But if you tack on too many arbritrary rules for the sake of balance like this it's more restrictive than free.
---
But the bed has a creepy spider thing under it in the thumbnail, so that's cool :P
---
No charge my dude only needs mats if im short, but donations are absolutely welcome lol add me 
---
I‚Äôd imagine that when they add new perks to the game we might see an increase to the SPECIAL limit of 15
---
Why is that a bad thing?
---
I don't have a problem with my stash box at all. I hover around 550-ish max... I vendor most of the junk I collect, keep what I know I will use maybe a few days out. Giving us more stash weight is a non-issue for me, but if they want to do it... I'm not going to complain.
---
However, I love the idea for multiple types of storage, and display cases. That, I'd be totally on board with! 
---
Ok, so, as a allrounder stealth build il give you the rundown the best i can. You do NOT need to max out your damage cards. Period. Flat. Out. Worthless. Save yourself the effort and put 3 rifleman 1 expert rifleman and one master rifleman. Net you 40% boost to rifles for 5 perk cards. If you spend any more perk points than 5 and it is not giving you a 100% boost it is worless, enemies in this game are bullet spunges. Your going to need to put ALOT of a.mo into them. I run with one combat rifle spect out as automatic .38, this is specifically used for tanky enemies i dont want to wast good ammo on (no one uses .38 so i have an awfull lot most of the time) one two shot shotgun for my close quarter issues that need to be addressed IMMEDIATELY. and one perfect storm for my run and gun activities.
---
I use the shotgun reduction perk maxed out as more often than not im literally standing infront of the enimies shooting them in the face so the reload was necessary, this had tho a dual bemifit of reducing the weight. Averall im carrying ~40 lbs of guns, this is crucial, if you cannot reduce your guns weight decide what you like the best and cut the rest out. Or store them for use later when ammo gets low on another.
---
As for weight reduction perks. Forget them. The 2 in particular you want to use are bandolier max rank for 90% ammo weight reduction and the armour one (cant remember right now) both of these max out at 2 meaning with only 10 strength  i can have 1* rank of shotgunner expert shotgunner and master shot gunner, 2 for bandolier, 2 for armour weight perk, 3 for shotgun weight perk. For armour use whatever, but make sure you use armour you can get deep pokets on. Because of armour reduction perk it doesnt matter what your wearing you get 50% reduced weight and get 10 lbs per armour with deep pockets.
---
You mentioned incisor so i emagine you use melee to, that makes it tricky but hopefully woth this knoledge youll be a le to sub out some of my dam perk cards to help fit your play style, but i warn you now, melee stealth is by far the worst. Even with maxed out stealth cards shadowed armour and muffled legs and chameleon i am still spotted befor i get to melee range. Best to keep melee as a last resort and just keep one really strong (with out perk enhancement) melee to keep you going when all else Breaks.
---
Lastly your food worries are over!! Behold the overseer has provided you with the only food you will need! Yes that us rught even the badest of boys can live strong woth the goodest boy perk! All dog food now gives 3x the benifit, this is immense, i carry 15-25 dog food on me. And i still walk away from a 2 hour play session with more food than that. I have literally been feeding my friend 15 -30 dog food every few days and still have 30 of them in my stash, seriously screw the rest of it, dog food never expires heals 75 hp and recovers 30% food. Thats mad. If you hit red on your food it takes 3 to be fully fed again. 3. Thats a net weight of wait for it. Like 3 lbs. 
---
So aside from very very specific needs ie the bonus from food like melee dam up or whatever. Dont carry it. If you know your going to need it go get it keep a small amout thats it. Always serch for it but dont keep lots. Cause it spoils anyways.
---
For drink,use nuka perk, again 1 lbs a bottle and it restores 30% thirst. 3 from when you hit the red and your cushy. 
---
Now go my goodest boy and use this knoledge i have bestowed you to fix your build. If your high level already you may consider restarting, up to you. Levels come easy but not having the right perks now will make it a small struggle to fix, tho not impossible. Good luck see ya out there.
---
-the a**hole who destroyes bases too close to mine.
---
There used to be a bug that allowed you to steal Power Armor regardless of the paint on it. One of my first posts on this sub was helping a guy give his friends Power Armor back because he‚Äôd accidentally stolen it and couldn‚Äôt give it back since it was painted. He didn‚Äôt know how to replicate the bug either.
---
I believe you just give your Power Armor to the guy who‚Äôs going to paint it, they paint it, they have it at a public Power Armor work station and you should have the option to get in it even though the game thinks it‚Äôs theirs. Unless it‚Äôs been patched.
---
I've run into a few who need help, and I'm 20 levels lower than you are.  
---
The thing that seems to trigger their trust is to stumble upon them and help them clear out enemies.  If you're looking to help someone, open the map.  See a Level 10 in Harpers Ferry or the Cranberry Bog?  Fast Travel there and help them kill everything.  They'll usually be grateful for the help.
---
This. And keep excavator PA with calibrated shocks for an additional 200 carry weight for fast traveling.
---
I'm going out take me some government land 
---
Just L and R arms
---
Oh sorry I know people love their euphemisms to mask the reality of the things they eat and wear. 
---
From what I know, only low levels can spawn them. Still need 2 more for the quest.
---
same here, I keep one of every magazine and bobble I find in the hopes that someday I can display them properly. 
---
Crap. Okay guess going to have to figure which legendary is being a bitch. Thanks! 
---
I had Protectrons a week or so ago, and it was great. No charging horde, just slow moving protectron legendaries to farm.
---
Why on your chart does Class Freak not lower the effects of Empath?
---
I like to parade in front of people with the sign, they just ignore me though.
---
But but but, what about my super stealthy angry grandma build???
---
I have done the wendigo one but it keeps popping in my quest list.
---
I have seen fog a few times. last time was around charleston train station. rad storms I have seen more often and just seem to happen like rain. I like the green color they have.
---
As in way rarer than in Fallout 4? 
---
I had good results offering free marine armor plans over at fo76bazaar. Now I‚Äôm helping people through quests and helping them find other things they can‚Äôt seem to get their hands on. Try offering your wares over there
---
Sounds like a great rp opportunity. You and a group of friends "protesting" right outside 76. Then offer new players a sign to "join you"
---
I know I‚Äôve fought 3-4 more than a dozen times. I don‚Äôt have TSE. Just a melee build with a heavy weapon plus One Gun Army. Shoot them and slaughter their minions to make them land then beat the hell out of them. No TSE or Bloodied weapons required. 
---
Not panicking and knowing the map is the trick though as is knowing when to jump into PA. Stealth builds can use the BoS ASAM camps to devastating effect as well. Which is fortunate because this kind of thing happens in Cranberry Bog most of the time. 
---
after we hit 50..we have the opportunity to either pick a new card or swap one from another category each time we level (ex level 51, 52, etc) i just hit 51 and it gave me the choice..will it happen each time? i made some bad choices in regards to perks and i need to shift some around
---
i havent experienced any griefers whatsoever, everyone is pleasant that i come across. No crazy glitches (although my X-01 calibrated shocks were autoscrapped). 
---
I DO get pretty rough frame rates/frame drops occasionally and the random disconnect but nothing that's too bad. 
---
Man, just drop it. Dont be that guy. 
---
You can go back and overencumber yourself whenever you want, and selling a few of the bulked lead will pay your fast travel. 
---
It's not worth hoarding it friend, i promise you've dropped something more valuable to maintain it 
---
It's a recurring Quest that you can do everyday if you like.
---
A lot could be done with the arm mods. Especially since they're all complete garbage. The only one that's relevant is the optimized bracers and as far as I know they don't even work. We can build an amazing weapon out of a severed deathclaw's hand but we can't make a mod for our power armor punches to actually hurt anything lol eh maybe we just need a mod where we tear off part of the frame for using fist weapons
---
nothing special. just mixture of 2-3\* leather/combat/robot/raider   lol.  1 option of hard to detect sneak though.
---
Removes character diversity, specialization (no pun intended) roles in party.
---
Ubiquitous characters are boring.
---
50 points lets you max out 3 stats.
---
75 points let you max out 5 out of 7

Thanks! This morning I just realized I might need lead, you got my back

if u on ps4, i can team up with u and garunetee u vengeance.
---
We should find out tomorrow or thursday, depending on when the inside the vault is released.
---
Pens definitely do not give springs. They should, but don‚Äôt. 
---
I imagine they can add more that reveals the reason why each fissure site happens to be there. Fissure prime is because the glass caverns for example. 
---
I'm with you there. I've tried the whole *"getting rid of what you don't need"* thing, but I just end up needing what I'd just gotten rid of.
---
Recent example is waste acid. I had about 250 of it, got rid of most of it. Now I find I need some for a bunch of ore I'd recently collected. This has happened with aluminum, springs, screws, etc. It's pretty frustrating.
---
I'm level 25 and yes, I do get paranoid about higher level players for two reasons:
---
\- Unsure if they'll effect the enemy level spawns around me. If I'm in the Forest, not worried. If I'm at Whitespring trying for the 10th time to get that friggin' sword? Yeah, I might high tail it out of there if some high level wanders by. I know it probably won't effect anything, and maybe they'd even help, but yeah, it's disconcerting.
---
\- I'm over encumbered a lot with useful junk and you might take that all away from me. My next trip is to the Ash Heap to gather up black titanium for the excavator pa (I bought a mining map). Even if I'm carrying what I would consider to be a minimum of ammo, food, water, etc., I'm sure I'm going have to waddle back to a stash. You might decide to light me up and I'd lose all that.
---
Some of this is just due to feeling a bit weak overall at this level, but yeah, I'll probably just sneak and avoid you.
---
I got starburst clock from Grahm, cucko clock from the rare Charleston robot vendor, TV plans from BoS vendor in Watoga. All the best finding the plans to finish your build! Not sure about the chair and the safe, but I can build all of the rest, if ya need help building them just let me know!
---
Do you also have a single star perk card? When I was building my mutation stack, I made both a one star and two star so I could roll the dice on removing them one at a time. Now that I have my desired stack, I wish I could delete the single star card. I've equipped it more than once when shuffling cards around. I would have lost mutations if I hit the shower before I caught it. 
---
I capture and defend everyone of these I walk past, free events and free plans and very few mess with them now. 
---
They shouldn‚Äôt keep a grudge after you die tbh. It‚Äôs bad enough that a. every robot gets all pissy because you accidentally shot one but didn‚Äôt kill it and b. the assaultrons are still bugged. Besides I‚Äôm at the level now where I can literally leave my character in a pile of robots trying to kill me while I go grab a snack before coming back  and killing them all in 2 seconds. I know they‚Äôre robots but they have to be smarter than that.
---
&gt; I thought of something 
---
Hate to break it to ya, but this is a new thought every 4 minutes on this sub.
---
You have to look for the Ghouls wearing Golf Outfits, it takes several trips to the Golf Course to get them all.
---
Wow good to know then,I'm not even sure,pile if bs if you ask me.
---
The game is rather broken in places, if you hadn't noticed :-)

4. Discussion about balancing around PvP vs PvE aside, the weapon calibers seem incredibly arbitrary and a bit frustrating. For example, .50 BMG is something like four times easier to craft than .308 despite being a massively more powerful cartridge. The .308 LMG does laughable damage compared to a .38 pipe weapon. You get the gist. I'm not asking for it to be super-realistic, but the .50 machine gun shouldn't feel like a pea shooter. The approximate hierarchy is something like
---
.38 &lt; .45 &lt; 10mm &lt; 5mm/5.56 &lt; .308 &lt; .50
---
Can we get weapons that are representative of the ammo they're using, and actually feel satisfying to use? The enemies feel like HP sponges, and it's tiring. Right now, everything feels lateral to everything else, when certain big guns should be just that- big. Breaking out the .50 cal should be an event, not my mainstay weapon, and the more powerful ammo should be rare, but hit like a train. That way, I don't feel like I'm ablating my way through enemies with a belt sander all the time, and can occasionally be a badass instead of a ditchdigger. 
---
I know you guys have a lot on your plate, but thanks for listening.
---
perks in the video, and I have a post about my build here. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahvtb0/you\_dont\_need\_any\_good\_weapons\_to\_kill\_everything/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ahvtb0/you_dont_need_any_good_weapons_to_kill_everything/)
---
They increase the range of sentries?
---
I played everyday since beta after I get back from work and I done everything without rush. I can't even fast travel because I'm overweight 24/7 so I walk all around the map for quest. Some hardcore gamers do rush but not me.
---
I would be considered a ‚ÄúSJW‚Äù by shrill angry white men. Despite that, I still think you‚Äôre selfish and hypocritical.
---
You‚Äôre reaching for cloying sympathy (‚Äúwon‚Äôt someone PLEASE think of the poor poor vets!‚Äù) and getting angry over humorizing ptsd while at the same time you play and enjoy a comical game about nuclear war when NAGASAKI AND HIROSHIMA VICTIMS STILL EXIST.
---
Piss off with your ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù.
---
 EDIT: If you're going to down-vote my post, please leave me a comment. I'd like to know why. I'm curious what everybody thinks about the STASH, both for and against upgrades.   
---
I think it is a bot or someone who just downvotes to troll, every thread is always downvoted without explanation
---
Yup, what I was afraid of :-D Thx!
---
There are no pve servers announced
---
you had the chance to make it 76 points and you blew it
---
I have marsupial for the +20 and keep excavator armor for fast traveling. PA gives +7 str (35 carry weight), excavator set gives +100, and calibrated shocks pair gives another +100. I hop in PA to fast travel and hop out to sneak around.
---
As opposed to playing on a server that Bethesda runs a player hosts the game and others can connect to them. To do that the player would most likely need the game files thus promoting modding and the rest is history.
---
I highly doubt they'll add uncut version of the piece into the radio. Just look at what they've done to Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony mov.1 ..... I was expecting for the whole movement !
---
I logged out...
---
Lol yes I have noticed that. I guess I was wondering if anyone else was having this issue as well.
---
I‚Äôm level 9, I hardly have any armor, my game is unplayable. Yeah 
---
I don‚Äôt want to argue that nothing needs fixing, as I don‚Äôt have the experience yet. I got a 3* medic laser rifle so far so maybe I got lucky. I‚Äôm just saying a 3* every drop is very excessive. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a nightmare for me. So id rather never worry about it and live in excavator PA and have an abundance. 
---
This is a perfect idea! Upvote this!!!
---
People are still chattering about it because there's some new controversy/blunder every week or two that keeps the meme alive. First it was bugs, then the canvas bag bait-and-switch, then Bethesda's laughable excuse, then there was the shitty 500 atom compensation, then there was the time they doxxed a bunch of customers with their online ticket system, the news that it was going to take them 4-6 months (i.e. an absurd amount of time) to ship out the canvas bags. After that, it was the nuka dark fiasco, the duping black market, and finally the hidden Dev room. 
---
Being low-hanging fruit and the butt of every joke doesn't equal success...
---
Yeah it has been broken for a couple weeks at least, even before the patch :(
---
They aren‚Äôt coming out. 
---
As long as it auto-dumps your structures into your CAMP like it does when you move, that'd be great.
---
Maybe timers?   Like you can't hold them for longer than X.  Can't claim the same workshop in a 24 hours session, etc.  
---
With the benefits being different for each one, and having multiple workshops produce the same stuff, they could pull it off.
---
Or just allow players to set which resource comes from which workshop.
---
Is it marine combat armor?  I had to do the ultra light mod on them and it works perfect with chameleon now
---
That would be amazing
---
Xbox :/ but I‚Äôll get someone to help! Luckily I have about 50 scrapped from mole miners so far! 
---
I stopped using pa and get less blue screen thou when I wear chameleon pieces sometimes get crashes
---
[PS4 Pro, V1.07] Sometimes the game just forever stuck at the loading screen. 
---
I think the perk is called contractor or something along those lines, it‚Äôs in the INT tree and at rank 2 reduces construction cost by 50% meaning you only need half of the typically required flux to make the shower 
---
If we‚Äôre talking base turrets, yea they‚Äôll help increase the range of your turrets.spotlights don‚Äôt have much hp tho
---
It would be cool if there was a perk for dual wielding lighter stuff. 
---
Like one handed and pistol where you get to choose to melee or shoot with left/right mouse button without having to switch between them. The drawback being to lose the secondary functions of each like block and using the sight.
---
Similar perk for dual wielding pistols, better firerate but lose the sight function.
---
No one ever said anything about a Jan 21 update.
---
Just an opinion but I‚Äôm willing to bet most players are 30+ years old and enjoy exploring more than pvp. I know I fit into this category.
---
Dang i needed cement bags lol
---
How can disgruntled veteran players chase people away from the game if they do that?
---
Do you see radstorms anywhere or only in the Forest area? 
---
You need to summon your inner Marie Kondo if you have that much stuff. If you have too many items, you should make an alternate character and move over things you don't use atm. Best way to do it. I have an alt that just carries my legendary apparel for instance. Takes 2 minutes to get out of the Vault and to fast travel to a friend to help you move stuff. I know, I know, you don't want to create an alt. But it's the only option we have currently. 
---
Everyone went batshit crazy over dupers and nerfs so Bethesda thought they had a priority to ban those people instead of fixing QoL.
---
Keep trying different kinds. Mine did that to. I ended up just picking a bunch of different kinds till one registered. Then searched out just that one. Sucks but what else can you do. 
---
Do you actually have an acronym in mind or did you just write ‚ÄúT.O.W.N.S.‚Äù because you thought it was clever?
---
If its just random generated loot and not MY loot then I'd be fine but if its out of my pocket then no
---
Oh? I didn't know that. Thanks!
---
Seems to me, I have gone and gathered and cooked all of his eggs 3 times. 3 times I have seen the Mothman within a few hours to 24 hours of doing it. The vengeful one. I don't think he likes that. But it could just be a coincidence. 
---
Smh I‚Äôm still mad at funko for not making a vetra pop
---
Dee durk a doo!!
---
I will do that, thank you. At least it‚Äôs working intermittently.
---
I wrote T.O.W.N.S. Because it‚Äôs be clever i thought but i didnt know that C.A.M.Ps has a meaning so I‚Äôm sorry guys  
---
You‚Äôre not humble bragging, just stating obvious (healthy) player investment.
---
Slowly collecting complete, all-level 50 armor sets of each type is a fun activity. Someday I‚Äôll finally get my last couple of pieces to my favorite set to use (t51b). Someday...
---
Maybe something like you settle on a specific server, but you're free to jump around to different servers in your regular play. When you FT to your settlement you switch servers. Then maybe have that area off-map with a FT point at an entrance. Similar to how FO4 handled Nuka World and Far Harbor where you have to FT in/out or take a transport of some sort.
---
Wait till you run Gunfu with a Vats melee build with marsupial and you figure out how to teleport due to vats melee targeting.
---
Kinda fun.
---
Agreed. Reward one extra special point every ten level ups past 50. 
---
Consider that lock pick and hacking fully equipped while exploring requires 6 of those 15 extra points. 
---
To max out just one gun types particular strength cards is 9 points. 
---
To minimize weapon and armor degradation cards you're looking at 
---
5 points if you melee, 3 for pipe guns, 5 for gunsmith 
---
To be able to access mods you learn for armor that's 3 more points. 
---
Just to be able to carry items in game there are something like 20 weight reduction points. 
---
Its ridiculously taxing to have to micromanage swapping cards constantly throughout a session of game play. 
---
And for those of you who say that's part of the game, and that we shouldnt have access to more cards, we already have to micromanage stash sizes, resource amounts, food and water bars, diseases and mutations, etc. The micromanaging is already ridiculous as it is. Having to swap cards in just to craft, then forgetting to swap back when you get into active gameplay is ridiculous. 
---
If you build into just maximizing one weapon you have basically no versatility to change play style unless you level up and respec points. I have let perfectly good weapons go because I dont want to have to get all new cards leveled up, switch points from one category to another, only to find out I dont like that play style. 
---
If you dont want extra points dont use them, but so many perks need to be passive or at least give us some more points to compensate so we arent constantly swapping cards back and forth. And it would be a good incentive to keep leveling up. 
---
... I‚Äôm running a stealth VATS rifleman build. 1/15/1/4/5/15/15. It‚Äôs quite doable, and I spend 10lbs on a PA frame to carry shit if I loot a lot (between the PA str boost, +2str to chest, and calibrated shocks and/or Excavator, it‚Äôs a biiig boost).
---
I do have a few weight reduction perks that I equip if I‚Äôm REALLY loaded down, just to be able to fast travel, but the rest of the time I run around with 0 perks and 1 str. I should have negative str thanks to my mutations but the game doesn‚Äôt do that, thankfully! 
---
Oh and I run ultralight armor, not pocketed.
---
It‚Äôs doable, you just have to be smart about what you carry. 2 rifles,  pistol, about 5 grenades. Couple hundred rifle rounds, about 50 pistol rounds, a couple PA cores. I carry about 40lbs of ‚Äúaid‚Äù but realistically I can dump half of it, it rarely gets used. 
---
Yikes... Low quality, unfunny shitposts are what passes as quality content on this sub?
---
It‚Äôs involved in the distant thunder event. 
---
Scorchbeasts focus it because it‚Äôs probably immune to damage so it can survive, SB are the only things that can reach it. 
---
They ***still*** haven't made a Protectron pop. Poor Protectron protects and serves but gets no love :c
---
Lol it‚Äôs okay! I appreciate your honesty. 
---
Don't listen to them. That sack is far more convenient if you are trying to grab people who are just FTing to and from the station. 
---
*fight me*
---
Run the Eastern Penitentiary Event a couple times and it'll drop.
---
I do rifle/sneak on my main, no problem with non-tse weapons.
---
Things to look into:
---
* Bloody Mess: Some weird math gets involved in this card, but it's a very good damage boost, more so than the text suggests.
---
* Glow Sight: YMMV, but most of the things I need the extra damage on count (note that Glowing Ones do not count)
---
* Armor Piercing: If I remember from other posts, you have Tank Killer, so good, but unless you have an AA legendary, I'd still suggest an AP clip.
---
* Sneak: If you don't want to get stealth bonus damage, then rifles are not as strong as a solid shotgun build, or a VATS pistol build, or melee, and so on and so on. Some optimization is needed if you want excellent damage potential (personally, I am slightly under-spec, in that I passed on more than two ranks on my rifle perks to keep some QOL perks elsewhere).
---
Not all of it... Just like a randomly dropped piece of inventory. Like a water and some cram damn learn to share. See that's why people are gonna eat each other
---
So you're retired, [but you work a full time job.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acfdwx/just_a_quick_reminder_tse_users/ed8o53a/)
---
You work a fulltime job, but [somehow found time to put over 500 hours into the game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agad1s/an_accurate_chart_of_my_reasons_for_dying_in_fo76/ee5eec6/)
---
[500 hours a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agd3lt/no_one_likes_you_when_youre_tse/ee5jc2j/), of course, being 1/3rd of the time since the game was released.
---
But despite having put in over 500 hours a week ago, today you've only put in 200 hours.
---
You also claim to be 73, but you type like a teenager in the rest of your posts. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that one.
---
&gt;I am become death.
---
You are become full of shit.
---
The glitch where you could disarm traps indefinitely still kinda works, but it only works around 20-50 times now with an auto key script. Still gets you lots of fuel or grenades. You can relog to keep using it. No good for exp though.
---
Well, the game is a long game, meaning its not meant to be started and beaten in a day. I get the feeling they are nefing it down for a larger time investment. 
---
Yup any weapons with only two shot will probably be not worth it now. 
---
Consoles will not be able to host as server
---
There is. In the emote menu it looks like a group of people and a plus icon.
---
Corn + razorgrain soup for days. I usually keep a stack of  blueberries on me for just buffing food w/o water.
---
I keep 5 ish plants of each at my camp, with the extra flora card and super duper, 5 plants turns into 10-15 soups.
---
I also eat a ton of dog food and old world canned goods, they dont spoil and are easy to find with a 1* can do and checking garbage cans.
---
Yeah, what I have noticed, if you get hit by an Enemy while depositing canisters, your inventory items will start showing in the list and you can accidentally deposit them.
---
I want Letters and Signs to to put on the side of my house "It Just Works".
---
AHH, I'm working with second hand prices.
---
I believe this to be true as this is my play time. I know a few people who I started with and are now level 105. Another person i ran into same level but had only been playing days. I think i'm a casual player though based on how i play. I'd rather explore and take time than push to just be level 100.
---
Rose??
---
Look at his post history. He's also put in 500+ hours, is lvl 170, but also works a fulltime job. Strange, that.
---
800 is fine.
---
Good luck.  I put everything in my stash and kept one grenade on me as an indicator.  Went through every gun and figured it out eventually. 
---
It is the railway rifle.
---
Source: me, I‚Äôve done some climbing using the method. Three spikes for a ledge seems to be the sweet spot for me.
---
The raid seems pretty balanced without the duped weapons. I jumped to the event last night and the squad I was with we killed her with &lt;5 minutes left.....of course I didn't help much at the end after showing up with 3 half busted weapons l, I ended the last 2 minutes punching her to death because I didn't have time to run to the work bench.
---
PvP wouldn't be near as bad without the dupes......but even without them in game trading and RNG luck still has the potential to make certain players OP. It's basically pay to win and it always will be no matter how much they nerf and ruin PVE.
---
I feel ya, but the servers are barely stable as is. Let's hope it comes down the pipe when they get more stable.
---
Common bug, if you have to put it in something, use a world container otherwise utilize trade.
---
Do you farm for Whiskey? I just got the grape menstats recipe and need to find some.
---
On the porch next to the banjo is an empty chair he often talks to. 
---
They will work the same, Bethesda also noted at the end of that sentence that no changes will be coming to the current PvP system. 
---
I have a farm that does lead junk and water, but besides that I farm Watoga for lead, I also farm sheds for paint cans and rat poison. I visit the rail yard east of Watoga for them and the very rare red paint can (stuck spawned in a locker), does me a good amount. 
---
Watoga and around it has plenty of ballistic fiber, I‚Äôm never short on it, visit the destroyed tank next to the civic center for one and each of the military camps. The camps are all over the cranberry bog, usually find military duct tape and ammo bags. After a single run I‚Äôll have around 12-20 ballistic fibers to repair with.
---
I have healing factor I still die. HF and Photosynthetic seem to work whenever the hell they feel like working. But I think thats a separate topic TBH. This was a known bug with FO4 and was fixed. Seems like someone wasnt paying attention to FO4 patches at Bethesda. 
---
You‚Äôre not the only one. I have 570 weight and 600 in my stash but it‚Äôs not enough without the weight reduction cards. I have most of them equipped all the time now.
---
Wow I can't believe I didn't think of that. I've got the level 1 version but for whatever reason I didn't click for me that stable flux would qualify. Thanks for the info :)
---
I go around and try to pvp for fun occasionally, I kill them and after the fight drop them some water or food and heart emoji, only had a couple come back vengeful like that
---
Its better than RDR2 online. lol 
---
At least I have all of the mods for level 25 guns....  scrapped a ton of them.... (grin)
---
I'm thinking only one workshop per player and you can hold it 2 hours
---
Downvoted because you have 4 alts worth of junk indicating you have zero item management capabilities. 600 is plenty for me, and I can see 1200, but 4 alts is a complete joke.
---
Plus, I believe they mentioned in the last from the vault more space is coming. Just be patient.
---
You said to explain downvotes, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing.
---
I was dropping a bunch of junk out of my inventory once, SOLELY on the junk tab.  Had several small stacks... you know where you have to drop them 1 at a time.  So I was hitting the button fast and I heard an "unequip" sound.  Back away and check the bag, sure enough I dropped my head gear.  Which was odd... as I was in the junk tab only.
---
Just thought maybe something similar for you?
---
To be fair the queen should not be invincible because lower lvls show up. This is s bug on Bethesdas end. If everyone chips in she should be killable but shes not and its super aggravating. 
---
You seem angry, Skyrim had a main story 4 different factions with radiant quests that led to bigger quests within the factions, 13 daedric quests, multiple unique city quests (forswarn prison mission, wolf queen) civil war quest which were  kinda the same but added unique fun gameplay, on top of becoming a wolf or vampire dragon shouts to seek out and interesting dungeons to explore. All of this ontop of the amazing map (black reach) offered and vastly different  characters that you could create with races. 
---
Don‚Äôt give me ‚Äúroses tinted‚Äù glasses shit I like fallout76 but any Bethesda game lasted me more than 2 months. 
---
The quest quality here doesn‚Äôt even touch fallout 4 ( order of mistresses was cool tho) and I hated fallout 4 why do you think ppl dupe and troll others there‚Äôs not shit else to do. 
---
I think it is disabled during vats but in the middle of a fight sometimes you pop out of vats without even realizing it and waste a stim. 
---
Ah a virgin eh?
---
My house in the mire seems to be a magnet for rad storms and morning fog. I see both of them almost daily. 
---
I think it would be cool if they had another stash for overflow that can be robbed/accessed by other players. 400 LBS safe, and 400 LBS that anyone might be able to take from you if they can pass your traps and locks. I'm also excited for player to player selling. Instead of dropping missiles and mini nukes on the floor I could sell them (I like shooting not exploding).  
---
Some more tips for Stash management from a LVL 40 perspective:  
---
\-Sort your junk by weight(WT) and see if you have any unscrapped junk. That happens a surprising amount of times even when you think you're scrapping everything before you put it in your stash.
---
\-Aid is a huge offender. I recommend selling to vendors the aid you don't find yourself using (I don't use drugs that much so I sell). Aid weighs more than you think. 
---
\-As others have mentioned, use a tinker bench and craft whatever you can into bulk.
---
\-If you have enough material, you might be able mod legendary weapons and armor that you are storing to be MUCH lighter. I don't do this, but it's an idea.
---
I see sqb fights all the time. Multiple nukes too.
---
Are you in na?
---
I'm sorry but it's gotta be a close second to the commie whacker. Nothing tops the commie whacker.
---
I have the same gpu. Sucks, but I've learned to live with it. Most of WV isn't so densely packed so it doesn't bother me so much, and with a wider fov, I can just try to appreciate the overall scenes (certain parts of the Ash Heap and the Savage Divide in particular; the Toxic Valley looks terrible ).
---
Yes every level after 50 you will be given the choice of stat reallocation or a new perk card.
---
I enjoy it as well. There's something satisfying about it. Can't wait to get power armor plans. Then I can craft even stronger power armor. My crafted guns seldom break üòÅ
---
My 10mm fires one bullet at a time. Yours fires a ton of bullets in a row. You must be bugged. Of course you know why it does that so you know it‚Äôs because your 10mm has a different receiver. 
---
Perhaps might it be possible that there‚Äôs variations beyond hp and resists for the SBs. Some have more sonar, some have more crop dusting, some have a melee radiation attack. 
---
This. Besides once again if you research old issues in FO3, FO:NV, and FO4 youll see it coming up and either being fixed by Bethesda or in one of the Unofficial patches.
---
Also even if this wasn't a bug (which it is) the regurgitated FO4 UI isn't really suited to easily allow you to manage things like this.
---
80 hours and two rad-storms.
---
&gt;People are still chattering about it because there's some new controversy/blunder every week or two that keeps the meme alive.
---
Like... the game being completely unencrypted? Oh yeah, that was made up. That the game is going free to play? Oh yeah, that's just fabricated out of thin air. That the game is easily hackable and they don't ban anyone? More stuff just pulled out of thin air.
---
&gt;First it was bugs, then the canvas bag bait-and-switch, then Bethesda's laughable excuse, then there was the shitty 500 atom compensation, then there was the time they doxxed a bunch of customers with their online ticket system, the news that it was going to take them 4-6 months (i.e. an absurd amount of time) to ship out the canvas bags. After that, it was the nuka dark fiasco, the duping black market, and finally the hidden Dev room.
---
See this is funny. They're getting their bags, that's not even being talked about anymore. 500 atoms? Fuck them for giving away free stuff they normally charge for, amirite? The "doxxed" customers had their... account name revealed. Oh no! Just like if you played the game normally.
---
A themed rum costing slightly more than normal high-quality rum? Fiasco!
---
Duping, in a game? That's a first! Never heard of that happening before!
---
A dev room? You mean the one you can just clip into from the major city next to the main vendor NPC? Oh wait, that was world of warcraft... you mean the one you use a console command to get to? Oh wait, that's any other Bethesda game.
---
The idea that a "fiasco" is made out of any normal glitch, or the existance of a dev room people hacked their way into, is exactly my point.
---
People *want* to keep talking about it. It's outrage culture, it's been happening for years.
---
So every little thing becomes a big fiasco you read about, Jimquisition probably makes a video crying about the death of the gaming industry because a normal glitch in gaming happened in a video game, and they keep making tons of advertising revenue on youtube videos and sites like IGN and Kotaku because people are fawning over this game months after release.
---
Bad games get forgotten. This one just gets a ton of negative attention because some streamers made a big deal about playing the Beta, which then deleted itself right before playtime.
---
I had a difficult time giving away 400+ rounds of .38 ammo at level 11 or 12. Messaged 3-4 people that were lower level with no reply. Dropped them in front of a level 5 who promptly ran off and finally I dropped them in front of a lvl 7 who picked them up and gave me the üëç and ‚ù§Ô∏è emotes. 
---
No problem, glad I could help!! :) 
---
A build is just forseeing what you want to end with based on the max perk levels
---
Nor will it be
---
Just clickbate 
---
Doubt that many got banned, I personally haven't logged in all December and probably January too due to the winter sale psn had.
---
I bought like 10 games so I doubt I'll log into 76 anytime soon but I do plan to.
---
Max stats means nothing. Take a moment and look how many possible card combinations there are. I posted another post in this thread. Special has less bearing on anything than the combination of what you put the points into. 
---
There are far too many utility based cards, or quality of life cards, whatever you want to call it. Even with 25 more points the only thing that would allow would be less stopping to swap cards out and maybe being able to pump up more than one weapon type at a time. 
---
Also what does it matter about variety, this isnt a competitive game. 
---
You could have gone back for your stuff about 15 minutes later.  The Whitesprings Robots always win in the end...
---
I use cannibal so I dont have to carry much food
---
what sources?
---
The game always felt dead except for in a few places. It's part of the point. Seeing another player randomly should be like finding water in the desert. Haven't noticed any change on PS4, nuke zones are always packed
---
That was a fun weekly challenge. 
---
True. And someone else pointed out that people in PA wouldn't be readily noticible. It's admittedly a gaping hole in the concept that, while I considered, didn't come up with a solution. Yet.
---
Marine, not soldier 
---
Yes every level up gives you that chance. 
---
Any character is technically a "build" even crappy, non thoughtout ones.
---
I too think we don't need any more special points to distribute... it works as is...
---
But... if we're gonna add 25... why not one more and give us 76 points total =P
---
That‚Äôs great! Hopefully the development team will pick up on this like they did the stash limit, bobby-pins weight, and hardened mass.
---
i am often in the facebook community because it is a lot larger than this. all of the "prominent posters" that form big factions all got banned. of the roughly 20 people i play with almost daily, 8 were banned, even though only 5 were actual dupers.
---
I originally had used perk cards for weight reductions, but now I use 3‚≠êÔ∏è legendaries that have weight reduction abilities. I.e, I have a raider left arm that gives +1 strength, -15% scorched damage, and a 20% reduction in weight of food, water, and chems. This is a big deal for me, and I‚Äôm constantly checking the Watoga vendor bot to see if someone sold them... 
---
I don‚Äôt have much luck in drops.
---
Yeah its so boring people saying "*TSE isn't OP. They should buff the other weapons instead of nerfing it.*" like seriously? So now all guns kill everything in 1 shot, that's the balance you want? Sounds shite.
---
Yes scorched beasts are annoying to fight. Its the only damn challenge left for me! Don't you dare make them easy to kill!
---
Maybe It's just a Tuesday morning on a work day?
---
yes i am
---
Also I‚Äôm on Xbox and my gamer tag is Diesel Gunner if anyone is interested I have other friends of mine that are doing this so even if I‚Äôm busy I can send someone else to follow you around.
---
I am in the U.S. And I have a friend from Russia I play with (although he doesn't speak English very well) ü§£
---
yeah but in what are we losing in terms of quantity. because if I lose like .....eh say 25 some rounds of 5.56, 3 Purified Water and a Radstag Stew, you can bet I'd be a little pissed simple due to the ammo lost
---
Bethesda!!! Listen up! Make me scared again!!! 
---
Agreed... 100%
---
A build template is what they really need to alleviate the constant picking through cards to respec to repair armor and weapons. I do sometimes feel like the points aren't "quite" enough, but I think they need to rebalance the cards and categories so that it makes a little more sense, some of them are spread out over too many special. Like shotguns, I think you have to be spread over 3 categories. But I think an eventual rebalance of the system will make it a bit better. 
---
That would require effort.
---
Killing the queen just depends on the lvl of people there so at times she is invincible or just harder to kill.
---
yep; i've come across 3:
---
lvl 20, lvl 35 and lvl 50, all with the two shot ability. Not really worth it imho
---
Thank you for your feedback.  I'm not sure I understand getting down-voted for playing differently than you, but I do appreciate your point of view.   Also, I just went back to check and be sure.  There is no mention of the stash in the 01/17/2019 Inside the Vault.
---
Its kinda situational, but I love the 1* END perk that removes radiation during the day it saves soo many radaways while exploring, it doesnt help much in nuke zones but meh :D
---
And the 1* END perk that restores HP during the day is great for topping up hp that you dont want to waste a stimpack on.
---
Both are great cards to swap in and out as you need them.
---
They are implementing player vendors in the game so this might be overlooked. It is a good idea though. Wow did this with really rare mounts and vanity items. The Black Market Auction  
---
My grandson and I share this account because I am hard to understand alot of modern things. I haven't had an email since AOL
---
You can also live your camp a few feet, and pay like 15 caps and your camp is rebuilt?
---
Nooooo. lol I was really glad a lot of people weren't stripping these spots bare of ballistic fiber because it was regularly at these places when I'd go. 
---
However... if you want lead the fastest way by far is to just pick up every tin can you see because they all have one lead (and one steel which is great if you're ammo crafting). Every place has those laying around so I'm always stocked up on lead.
---
I've noticed that as well. I'll make corn soup and razorgrain soup. An hour or so later I've still got 20+ corn soup, should have 20+ razorgrain soup as well but they're all gone.
---
Bad games don't go forgotten.
---
&gt; It won't be looked on as if a punishment.
---
And I personally don't see that as a bad thing. If destroying bases is something people enjoy, that's awesome. It is a game mechanic, it was intentionally included. Perhaps rather than punishment, we use the word consequence.
---
Having the same issue.  I've been picking a variety of flowers, making sure they are on the list of flowers for the challenge, but all of the flower types remain firmly at 0/10. 
---
Oh I put more thought into this but didn't add it into the OP. That's simple any ammo that's "equipped" doesn't get dropped. You would only be able to equip two or three at a time. Maybe even just one since it's a hardcore mode
---
Also I responded to a post here from another lvl 100+ player offering to make weapons and armor free of charge. I added him on Xbox, and joined his world about 20 minutes after his post. He said I was the first to join him and people were down voting his post. He made me a sniper rifle, a shotgun, and took me to farm XP at a nearby mole mine. As we headed to the train station outside of white springs he got a team request from 1 more redditor. As they joined we all got booted from the server.
---
This game is easy. The only hard parts are fighting glitches and server crashes.
---
Damn u on Xbox? 
---
Feed the People, while the event is 'warming up' before you activate the machines, produces MANY low-level Liberators. They all drop 1-2 each, and it's pretty common for 20 or more to spawn.
---
Having the same issue.  I've been picking a variety of flowers, making  sure they are on the list of flowers for the challenge, but all of the  flower types remain firmly at 0/10. 
---
noticed it all weekend, im not even playing currently
---
Fair enough tbh
---
Successful games don‚Äôt go F2P within months of release.  But that looks to be the case for FO76.
---
Still, some brave souls will add the why.  u/van1287 is one such reddit user.  While he and I disagree, and he called the way I play "a joke," at least we have the opinion and therefore the debate is more complete.  
---
What do they give, iguessed springs as they have a search icon for me
---
My grandson and I both use this account on here...
---
Way rarer yes but they do happen. In the last week I had a rad storm and fog. Very short lived though. 
---
To anyone who doesn't want more difficult content. I would like to see you use a coherent perk card set and try to do the entire game with armor and not a power armor frame.
---
Save perk points by looking for alternatives. Instead of spending three points on thru hiker to carry around your food consider just gathering and making what you need when you need it. I have the herbivore mutation and combine it with Green Thumb and eat berries all day. Wood is easy to gather especially if you temporarily slot in the double gather perk, dirty water is infinite and then just find a cooking station and you're set for water. I regularly end up junking so much dog food because I just never use it when I can just spam cranberries and blackberries every time I pass a bush. 
---
Speaking of TSE for the badguys. Harper's ferry hold a cold place in hell for me, with the turrets in there. They shoot explosive bullets that stun you. I have been killed in meat seconds by those bastards. If the scorched want to win this fight, they would just have those damn things everywhere.
---
I wonder how many of the player vendors actually have items that are usable for end-game players. I would expect that it takes quite some time, server-hopping and lots of caps to find servers where player vendors are selling high level items.
---
TBH, I can't remember if they smoke as much as the standard ones, but they do still make noise.    
---
I have to say, though, that I really like my clean purifiers and small gennies.  I wish I could get all of the gennies in a clean state - it makes more sense that I'd want to make better versions for my home.
---
You are repeating a rumor that has been debunked.
---
I only got 666 caps
---
I just want a vendor that can give more than 200c for my junk I don't want
---
I might have to go to Walmart soon. That Tricentennial T-51 is basically my main set at this point.
---
You can build at a camp that doesn't belong to you?
---
JUNK SHOULD BE WEIGHTLESS
---
You couldn't have I blew it up.
---
That would be the best thing added to the hame
---
&gt;i just hit 51 and it gave me the choice..will it happen each time?
---
Yes, at each level you'll have the option of picking a card or moving a point from one SPECIAL stat to another. You'll also continue to get perk packs every 5 levels (55, 60, etc).
---
My advice would be to manage your ammo and fusion cores, limit all your non essential junk to quantities of about 100, keep essentials to under 500, (except steel, running out scraps mods).  Make sure all your junk in stash is scrapped. 
---
Ditch known plans and recipes. Scrap low level weapons or give them away. 
---
I was talking about this yesterday with someone. I would pay money for special card backs for each deck or digital ‚ÄúGrognak‚Äù box, ya know, like the magic the gathering boxes. I‚Äôm lazy/a filthy casual so I just keep my scrounging/lockpickjng stuff on me at all times. 
---
Sure as it is it couldn't run, but if it were scaled down it could work. Limit the number of players on PtP to 4-6, maybe even have it so all inventory has the same loot, but each player can take it with only legendaries being different. If need be instanced loot could be don't "client side" as opposed to the person hosting.
---
Want to make the game really hard: unequip all your armor except for a outfit (road leathers is fun for a mad max run) 
---
I haven't posted here in a while?  Have no idea why a different opinion offends you so much but that's something you have to work on. 
---
I think it needs a little tweaking but not too much. It's a little ridiculous how heavy gunner build can use the 90% weight reduction perk and carry around a whole armoury.
---
They do need to make rifle build slightly more appealing.
---
The weight perks are intentionally there though to try and balance the game so you can't just max out on damage, you need to give sacrifices.
---
packed with people under level 40 maybe. We spend a lot of time looking for people chillin at their camp on the world map, then go over there to look at their camp, see what theyre up to, see if theres anything they want to trade etc. So I am very aware of what people are on my server and its been very hard to find anyone who is high level with a nice camp and seem to be knowledgable of what theyre look to trade for etc.
---
That free hand is for stimpacks!
---
On ps4. Same experience. Great people. 
---
Wait what does this remind me of...something from New Vegas with the dusters...it's on the tip of my tongue.
---
Yeah at least stuff didn't disappear from your inventory. I've lost my legendary combat rife...
---
I think having a weight on our person is fair, but it would be cool if it was at least minimized (if not zero) while stashed.  I'm not sure they'll take it that far though.
---
What does CAMPS mean? 
---
I also just picked up the Reaponder‚Äôs Fireman Helmet yesterday. It‚Äôs another cosmetic separate from the Firebreather‚Äôs Fireman Helmet. 
---
Maybe someone nearby was at a low level close to 9. Nearby players spawn creatures. Sometimes that's how i know another player is nearby
---
Its principle.
---
I found him a week ago right next too the overseer camp
---
From what I can tell they just remade GTA Online, so probably going doing shit creek with a new type of Shark Card.
---
Was just in a rad storm last night on pc. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they go ahead and start banning everyone with a duped item. it's no exaggeration to say the majority of the playerbase would be gone.
---
but I also noticed a dip on January 1st. in this sub as well. maybe the nuke thing drove people away. another dip about a week ago. and I've been sleep deprived since the game came out, mostly hoping servers, so I should know.
---
during nights on weekdays I'm rotating between the same half a dozen servers. I pretty much stopped hoping for single events since it's useless at this point.
---
They could have separate servers for instanced areas though, making the strain on the world map servers much lighter.
---
Its just daft the way it is now and can potentially cause problems for new players etc.
---
Bethesda really did just rip FO4 off and spent most of there time working on the Atom Store didn't they :( Greedy mofo's!
---
I do the same. I run PA very rarely, about the only time I do is launching nukes. I have don't the SBQ fight numerous times in rad suit and have done my part to make sure we beat her.
---
I'm unable to comment on the things my grandson does here, he is alot farther along in the game than I am, He has a knack for that sort of thing.
---
But then will the loot be lower level? 
---
Best bet is craft lvl 1 piece(s) then scrap em ..super cheap to do in mats ..I have every armor and sub categorie unlocked by doing it this way most of the time ...if u were on xbox I might have a extra plan for u but I'm jit at home so cant check 
---
Well that's crappy for you. Sorry to hear that but are you surprised?
---
How has it been ‚Äúdebunked‚Äù?  
---
Cunstruction and assymbly mobile platform.
---
Spells, ehh.
---
Might as well since everyone goes in there singing it anyway haha
---
Because war, war never changes.
---
I've tried helping too and it seems most people are scared. 
---
I try to drop items into an overseers cache and then heart emote and dance around until they go to check but a lot of people run.
---
I even messaged a few people on my server once as I had taken several workshops and wanted to pass them along when I logged off but no one replied. 
---
This is part of why I'd love pve only servers, I want to help people but it's hard to find people who want to randomly group up or accept help without being afraid. 
---
ESO was published by Bethesda and it has both player vending and a weekly "golden items" vendor selling end game gear, it'd be amazing if they do the same thing Zenimax did on ESO with 76 and add both.
---
Not exactly. You lose a bunch of stuff if you move your camp. But it will probably blueprint the structure.
---
yeah, same here, but it's really the noise that bugs me more than the grime. While we're at it though, can we get some clean workbenches that don't cost an arm and leg? or a clean jukebox? or a nuka cola machine we can actually stock?
---
I agree. The problem I have is that, at this point, you can only react. Where is my opportunity to preemptively strike.
---
I know these guys are raiders. They just destroyed the 2 CAMPs down the road. Now they're coming for me...what now?
---
I want something better than just "change servers." I want to participate, but not be screwed because of game mechanics preventing me from acting on information that I know.
---
I like your initial idea here.  I would expand the weights a bit, but it does give more storage while making you think about how to store it.  I would even expand it so that there is a container that is used for our upcoming CAMP vendors.  We'll have to see how they do that.  Great ideas!
---
RDR2 online is basically, just, shoot people, lasso and drag people. That and weird midnight knife battles. They missed the mark so bad with it. They should have put more into coop, but its still young as well. It has time to be fixed. 
---
Drop off Raider PA lv15 and Excavator PA lv25 suits - you might get some takers for those.
---
HAHA excellent!
---
&gt; Perhaps might it be possible that there‚Äôs variations beyond hp and resists for the SBs. Some have more sonar, some have more crop dusting, some have a melee radiation attack.
---
Monsters don't have interchangeable mods, your defense of the game is new mental gymnastics that were before now unheard of
---
Stinkin Bots!!!
---
No clue. I gave up looking when a halfway decent robot chest dropped since I can craft dense for those. Would love to know, though.
---
How dare you rush through this game, you're not supposed to do what is fun for you, you're only supposed to be playing the game in whatever arbitrary fashion that I, the representative for all **real** fans of fallout 76, dictate. If you have fun doing anything else than what I say then you're having *wrong fun* and any crash, disconnect, or problems you have with the game are entirely your fault.
---
It's fucked.
---
What kind of stuff do you lose? I've never tried it, hut seen it reported as a solution, since this thread comes up a dozen times a day
---
It was all based on some youtuber suggesting that might be the case because stores were marking down copies of the game. 
---
That‚Äôs all. One youtuber suggested it and it became a rumor that game haters jumped all over, 
---
I love marsupial and bird bones. Mix that with armor that reduces fall damage, and now you can jump from any height and take no fall damage at all.
---
Dupers have muddied the waters as to how stable the servers actually are with a 600 lb stash. Until they can be dealt with reliable data isn't forthcoming.
---
Our best hope is someone found a way to weed out the data noise of duping induced instability.
---
I agree the SBQ is balanced, I killed it multiple time with people who were cooperating, whether they had OP weapons or not, I don't think it's a kind of raid, to me it is more a "world boss" or "world event" , I have no clue but maybe later we will have instanced content for limited number of player and it's where the PvE balance will matter the most IMO.
---
&gt; It's basically pay to win 
---
I'd say more grind to win or luck to win but yeah it's true. Doesn't mean it will always be like that tho, there are some way to fix this, separated PvE from PvP balance could solve that issue.
---
Because Bethesda wanted to create a new kind of Fallout experience. Their idea included survival aspects including PvP.
---
Which you might do if you were cynical and/or paranoid. 
---
They delivered multiplayer Fallout. 
---
They never promised bug free and who does promise it? Because that company is lying. 
---
True, and I'm just helping the person out with proper spelling. No other motive or suggestion of anything.
---
Thank for your input.  
---
I was afraid it wouldn't really hold up in endgame.  
---
The reason for the high strength/agility without needing them that much is to take advantage of the barbarian and evasive perk.  
---
if you have time to look at what I've currently wasted points in and tell me if there's anyway to "save" the build or make it more end game viable? would it be better to force myself into some other weapon type or into a power armor suit? not going to do any PvP. Just want to enjoy the game casualy but still be able to take part of endgame content without it beeing a total pain.  
---
current special/perks:

---
and 11 level ups i still haven't spent.  
---
No, the song would get stale very quickly with how much this event is done (considering it is one of the few rewarding events in the game).
---
This is why I don't bother curing 85% of the diseases I contract. Rad Worms is ridiculously contagious.
---
I can throw in the exlotic Nuka Colas I own 
---
&gt; instead we get a map that is designed around "survival" which is why there is no NPCs
---
That isn't related
---
Adding passive perks as people have mentioned I think would help. Put the weight cards and other things like aqua boy, Ghoulish ect, into passives. or take them and make them more like the traditional perks, not on cards. 
---
With luck, some people will get bored with the mindlessness and start doing some organized stuff. Though I still think they'll eventually get to selling stuff costing several thousand dollars that you can't grind for.
---
Just got the rolling pin plan yesterday...so stocked lol
---
THIS!
---
I sat underneath one for an hour last night in stealth grabbing photomode shots, I love them. They're beautiful. 
---
(and yes, fun to bring down with a good rifle... I enjoy the challenge for a change)  
---
ok but how much am I losing. say I have for my Weapons a Handmade, 10mm Pistol and a Combat Knife. I have 250 5.56 rounds and 150 10mm rounds, but I also have say 200 .45 rounds in my inventory. I get ambushed and die while currently using the 5.56. will I lose only the .45 or will I lose some 10mm as the 10mm Pistol wasn't currently equipped and how much will I lose 
---
I had my scorchbeast fixed at the SPCA. Bob Barker talked me into it. 
---
&gt;"I don't want assholes who destroy camps of people way below their level to have a reward for doing so".
---
What reward? A bounty?
---
I was playing all weekend, and very late last night. Full lobby's for the last 72 hours. Many server hops.
---
Haha yea 4 slots for a 25 % boost vs 3 slots and a 30% boost is a no brainer, it just baffled me that less cards = a better overall bonus.
---
Im sure they will find a way to nerf/buff my strategy eventually.
---
I got it from the train station not on saturday
---
That was a lot of fucking words to "suggest" the same 3-4 things that have already been brought up hundreds of times now. 
---
Is joke
---
Where is lucky hole mine?
---
Thx!! i cant wait to fix my system..i wasted so much in endurance worried about rads
---
Thx
---
I moved my camp once and lost all my crops.
---
Thx..i feel a lot better now lol
---
Hmm. I‚Äôm building to sets of armor and a total god character, but I‚Äôm person who enjoys grind if done properly. If the loot system wasn‚Äôt such a hideous joke, and all builds had balance, I would suppose there would be more effort to get these op items rather than dupe or trade for them.
---
Then again it‚Äôs an MP, meaning everyone is going for the highest damage and protection rate regardless, and min-maxing for seriously op builds.
---
I can‚Äôt make sense of it, but I‚Äôm looking for a specific armor set and character build and that keeps me mostly content. Not to mention player encounters and selling things to other players which is almost always fun and friendly.
---
Bless you, my friend. We need more like you to survive these hard times. But for sanity's sake, stay iff r/Fallout for now. They'll tear you apart. Many of us have already suffered.
---
Let's go to lunch!

yeah most people who play a ton that i meet in game, note the change too. maybe people who dont play as often wont feel it
---
This is what I do
---
Mmm yeah I see what you mean now even if it was only a few pieces of ammo it would be a hassle to figure out. Maybe just food, water, and chems then! Just makes good raiding sense
---
You probably had  lof of fun using a tons of stimpack :D Try to pack some stealthboy it work against scorchbeast (To escape)
---
Bad news but you gonna encounter more and more scorchbeast  (Especially BOS quest) also you might upgrade some other perks to deal with them, a bit sad that main boss don't have much workaround other than get heavy gun or energy gun to kill them.
---
I use zero weight reduction perks besides bandolier ( for ballistic ammo) and i do just fine with 30 lbs for extra weight. Just dont be a hoarder my dude
---
[Here's some poetry about this..](https://imgur.com/gallery/6BshJOO) 
---
Lol
---
People changed outside the vault.
---
Isn't there a strength cap for both damage and carry weight though?
---
Lol I know the feel. My bf refuses to buy the game cause of all the flaws on it. I get it has issues, but I just want us to build a damn shack together smh.
---
U do realize this is fallout and not fortnite correct? 
---
Thank the PVP system. If you were trying to do this on a strictly PVE server you wouldn't have a problem at all.
---
Well, that's not pvp.  That's just being a d*ck.  Hard to stop those types.  
---
I would prefer a PVE server myself or at least have pacifist camp mode.  Put in a PVP server and let everything be fair game, including your stash.  Let the RUST folks play raiders.
---
 This is exactly the kind of post we need more of in this sub. Would read 1000x more before a single complaint or poorly thought out "idea" thread 
---
Umm isn't the player vendor thing something we set up on our own and put items in for sale? People could sell anything... Server hopping to other servers would potentially allow you more pc vendors. 
---
Rather then just a few npc ones.. Although I think dupers are going to ruin any chance at an in game economy... Oh they already have...
---
However, doing this publicly always comes with the air of publicly shaming them for a mistake. 
---
You could have helped with a private message just as well.
---
I have been looking everywhere to try and figure out the 'show offered' button for PC, thank you so much for posting this. I got so flustered trying to trade with someone the other day I just turned my computer off, lol .
---
Nuggets is where you went wrong. Trolls need tendies.
---
I play on PS4, and all week I see half a dozen or more lvl 100+ on any server I join.  And a bunch of randoms from 10-80 all around the other areas.
---
I'm not sure if this is well known or not I stumbled upon it myself and  never seen anyone else do it and to be honest it's not very useful but...
---
...I can't remember the building in watoga but if you come out of the train station and walk straight past the busses and jump on the road, turn right ands follow the road until the end of the last building (not that food place in the middle, I'm talking the multistorey building) then turn left and look at that building with your back towards the food place you will see a pipe running horizontally and drop down on the right. Get on the pipe on the right and walk up it until you are on the side of the balcony then jump over onto the balcony. Then just walk through that door that should act like a wall. You can then make your way up through that building to whatever door you want and every door on every floor will let you walk through. 
---
LOL How do you know? The humanoids clearly use different weapons? 
---
It could be that I‚Äôm doing mental gymnastics, or it could be that you‚Äôre inflexible.  I‚Äôve heard being a cynical know it all can cause that. 
---
I know it doesn‚Äôt add to strength but if it‚Äôs a melee build don‚Äôt forget twisted muscles mutation as well as glowing meat steaks mutant hound meat and Yao GUI meat they add to melee damage
---
its actually concept art from fallout tactics for the environmental armor mk 2 
---
well I'd love to see each faction get a boost like raiders have a scrap hand made feel so I'd give them cheaper repairs cheaper crafting and less durability but no advanced materials needed - where as responders I'd have boosted protection from radiation and more carry weight since they would carry supplies to help people - enclave more energy resistance and bos more physical resistance 
---
Yes but I like nuggets.
---
Its for that reason when I see them attacking a glowing bloated one I put the shotgun away for something more precise and get in super close for one shot. 
---
Course if you had some sentinel armor I'd understand standing still and taking shots.
---
Love to be a hand to hand combat unit. I have a a powerfist and a brotherhood Combat armor set, and running around double punching everything would be both amazing and extremely scary for other players.
---
See, I feel like I never get Rad Worms. Parasites and Dysentery for me. Constant poop fever and tummy buddies. Welcome to the Wasteland!
---
T.H.A.N.K.S.!
---
Yeah, if it isn't common knowledge, the Grafton Station vendor often sells Deep Pocketed plans. +10 weight per armor piece.
---
I remember seeing one in the savage divide. I wanna say I saw one in the ash heap but I cant remember for sure.
---
Same here but I got to 8/10.
---
It can be, more so when it puts you below a critical threshold.
---
The reason I don't find it as notable is because you only get it in situations where curing it makes no sense because if you are planning to fight scorchbeasts you more or less have to accept it, though getting randomly ambushed and scream spammed with it is super annoying.
---
And more outlets are looking into it, digging up more details.
---
The copies pulled from EB Games were a distributor recall, not a retailer decision.  Amazon sellers aren‚Äôt getting copies.  This is happening.
---
Fallaciously hitching your horse to ‚Äúone YouTuber‚Äù as an ad hominem is not how rumors are debunked.  So unless Bethesda itself has something to say on this, I am inclined to believe it.  Why?  Because this entire FO76 shit show has defied credulity at every turn, and I have no doubt Bethesda is fully capable of screwing over its customers one last time by giving the game away to everyone else for free just to try to make some Atom Shop money.
---
It only makes sense at this point.
---
&gt; TSE was just the answer to bad design. 
---
Now you‚Äôre getting it.
---
&gt; Simply removing it won‚Äôt solve the problem.
---
No, but balancing sometimes happens in steps. They‚Äôre working on it. In the meantime, it isn‚Äôt as black and white as you say. The Queen will still die.
---
Vault 76 was highly competitive. Imagine being stuck in a vault where everyone thinks they're better than everyone else. It wasn't exactly like that but it was pretty tense. Security wasn't allowed to have guns just in case they felt they could run things better. People fought over the awards handed out every year. The Overseer had switches to lock people down in their rooms for isolation purposes.
---
The multiplayer tension is right there in the story
---
I use the merchant at the train station for white springs and then just fast travel to service entrance and walk inside 
---
honestly I think they should just make a quest for each faction to get your own faction oriented shop terminal in your base where we can unload goods 
---
To get wood and steel really fast: go to Blackwater mine, kill every single mole miner inside and outside, loot the entire place (there's some little alleyways shooting off the main mine with lots of loot too) and then scrap all the weapons. All the wood and steel and other mats you could possibly want. Nearly everything in one place. Crystal, nuke material, wood, steel, asbestos, copper... And there's lots of workbenches. One weapons workbench inside the mine and all the others outside near the entrance
---
Yes. Because traumatic events cannot ever change a person and make them crazy, nor do sadists and narccissists exist who want to take it over
---
I have two. A 2 shot w 50% faster reload and a Instigating 
---
I have seen zero difference. Its been a wide mix for me since the start and I have not run a spread sheet for i and i am guessing neither are you.
---
I would guess that more people would be running lower level alts by now, my friends do it a bit.
---
I still have to queue now and then to get in on my friends server and there are lots of nukes etc so i can not see a difference. 
---
I play on PC with other europeans or americans mostly due to friends list.
---
But then again I think i have poor perception for this since i do not really care since i always play with others but i think i would notice if i was all alone suddenly üòÅ
---
It's not a house, but I'm camped at an awesome campground south of the radio observatory. There's 4 tents that spawn stuff, a bunch of assorted things like beer bottles and cans that spawn in-world, a lunch box that spawns food/drinks fairly regularly, and a junk pile resource at the bottom of the hill.
---
Best of all, it has a radio sitting on one of the picnic tables.
---
Throw the cryolator in there as well!
---
I don't like chameleon peices. I use reflex sites on my rifles(because they don't wiggle wiggle) and that armor makes my sites invisible. So I stopped wearing it.
---
Ever been dc'd during a daily? :D
---
But yea dying anywhere else is pretty easy peasy.
---
But a Scorchbeast fight with only a hazmat and drill would probably cost me a hole on the wall or a new controller üòÇ
---
Okay but like, they couldn't think of something else like starting off as a raider or different vaults clashing with other vaults?  
---
We are all under the same vault so it doesn't make sense. 
---
Yeah I just ran a test now. Vs scorched, scorched killer vs hardened is the same damage output, roughly. :( It‚Äôs mostly helpful if you don‚Äôt have hardened receivers for whatever reason. 
---
Well. I have a couple prime receiver plans. Choices to make.
---
Consider yourself lucky that cannibalism is illegal...
---
Deal

I  part of the thing you get in this game that you don't get any otherFallouts is that you can repeatedly loot an area. So if you know there's a place that has a million clipboards so that you can get a million springs you can just go back and get them. Is really no reason to have to store them all in your stash.
---
Awesome, I'm gonna be on soon again. Gone to this airport near Sutton. But if your in Flatwoods you don't gotta ask me twice to get back haha. Something keeps lobbing green rocks at me, can't see it, don't like it xD
---
I call bs then.
---
I see ppl of high level consistently at nearly all times of the day.
---
I play alot and the only timei don't see many ppl is at 1am pst but that's because its 4am est
---
LOL. Ok whatever. 
---
Unless Bethesda says they are going to free to play, then it's all rumor and speculation.
---
You are clearly a game hater. So you don't use logic. You aren't inclined to believe it. You want to believe it, becuase you are personally insulted by the game, and you hope it fails.
---
So you decide because outlets did something, that must support what you want to believe and to be true. 
---
What a sad way to live. So much anger at a game you aren't even playing. You are so twisted, you want a game to fail even though people are enjoying it. 
---
Sick. 
---
Have you completed all of the main story quests? Other than that, I'm at a loss...
---
Won‚Äôt work
---
- all special hasn‚Äôt the same proportion of active/passive perks
---
- some power tripping players won‚Äôt settle until they can have absolutely all perks active at all times
---
- multiplayer games rely on player complementarity and players able to access all skills at any time is killing interaction
---
Perk system is fun on paper but not fit for a multiplayer RPG 
---
Nugget gang represent.
---
Oh of course, class freak is ideal. I really think if you run multiple mutations it‚Äôs a must-have.
---
Mothman!!!!
---
When I have an END piece of gear my HP doesn't go up, only native increases to SPECIAL.  Was hoping to buff HP this way since STR bonuses benefit carry weight too. 
---
Every login i always check to see my starchgenes card is on.  Lol.  I cant lose my mutations.  Its like a whole diffrence game. 
---
Can confirm it is great.
---
Some of the PA paints I wouldn't mind, but I play in First Person...so it's useless 99% of the time
---
You spend that much time crammed into the same space you start to hate all the assholes around you enough to kill them.
---
What platform are you on?
---
You've really got to use automatic receivers or the battle will take way too long. 
---
I agree very much with you. [This is basically me](https://imgur.com/eAXFSzD) 90% of the time when fighting the queen.
---
Some enemies should simply not be able to drop low quality legendary items.

That is because the vault had a set of rules and consequences.

You ever been in a classroom when the teacher leaves the room? It's chaos.

West of Fort Defiance good sir!
---
The one thing that I am starting to notice is that my play style of building my character around the weapons that drop for me is going to mean that I will eventually need to start banking my level points. I'm already at a point where I'm currently rearranging my build to fit the super sledge that dropped for me the other day after originally building my character around my quad explosive radium rifle (which will meet it's nerf death in a week). I see a future of needing to move a lot of S.P.E.C.I.A.L points around.
---
What's next?..... melee nerf?......unyielding armor nerf?......level 70 weapons/armor?
---
I'm okay with a reset every so often to keep the grind going. But 3 months? I haven't even had time to finish my character build after 300 hours of play and my weapons are already getting nerfed.
---
Fortnite doesn‚Äôt have shields
---
Dunno. My guy looks drop dead sexy wearing the Rocket Girl costume. It hides his combover too, so don't know why everyone complains about it covering their hair.
---
What skins were released today? Havnt had chance to go on
---
I want to make America great again.
---
Yes, I tested all the leg and arm mods, but many patches ago. It may have been changed by a patch. I can test again and post my results in a different thread later this week. That's good news that at least one other limb mod now stacks. 
---
I didn't have to convince mine, I think it was my initial excitement(for the game), and the fact that PS4 has some fun VR that got em into Playstation then into Fallout, then I had to get a PS4 to play with and never been happier playing a game since then. Always been more Xbox since PS2 now I got both lol
---
There are so many places that have 4-10 per visit that I usually do one or two circuits and I am set for a week or more using White Knight to lower repair costs to 1 fiber per piece.
---
The legendary effect won't show on your base stats. If you want to test it find a barrel and compare the rads between quipped and unequipped.
---
Cool thanks.  I'll be on in a little while and will add you.
---
I'm still trying to figure out how I'm getting diseases when and completely encased in power armor and only got hit once.
---
You're just a lil' bouquet of sunshine!
---
I thought it meant Canadians Against Manbear Pig Shootings 
---
I too want to see CAMP objects that 'display' our stuff, but I can see issues with it where it's probably not a priority.  For instance, say you display your Ultracite Power Armor in a power armor station.  Then someone comes along and blows up your base.  What happens to the armor?  Can they damage it?  What if you scrap the Power Armor, does it go into your STASH or does it go into your inventory, or does it end up vanishing due to a bug in the process?  So I can see them being very careful about that kind of stuff right now as bugs can cause enough problems, imagine the headaches involved if people's prized possessions go missing due to a glitch.
---
Im at level 50 and players usually stay away from me as well UNLESS its raiders in Flatwoods. I usually drop loot in the overseers chest in the church. However, I do see higher level players in the blast zone and they do appreciate the help.
---
Just drop your random loot in chests. Its more fun for lower level players.
---
But thanks for helping out
---
Also word to the wise, if you're super hungry and super thirsty at the same time, DRINK FIRST. Preferably something clean too. Thirst gives a HUGE increase in disease chance. Makes quick eating give a reallll good chance of getting a disease, as well as drinking shitty water when low. 
---
I do this all the time in my CAMP being lazy thinking, hey infinite water and food I can cut corners, these diseases will drop off eventually right? Wrong. Very Wrong.
---
Good luck and happy hunting 
---
Ice Cold Nuka Colas.  They had an additional buff in F4 right?
---
Good to hear, at least your protecting some other begger from being tormented by them and protecting the wastes 
---
What's the highest level you can be and still spawn them? I'm guessing I was too high leveled (37) since I couldn't seem to get them to spawn.
---
I have a similar LAR and I think it works OK for scorchbeasts - they just have a ton of HP. I really don't like to bother fighting them unless I have to, or if there is an anti-air missile system nearby that can help me out. If they're hovering, you can try aiming at their wings - especially if you have cripple perks - and that'll force them to the ground, and melee does more damage. 
---
this would be great. I know I was supremely disappointed when I nuked other fissure sites. Nothing happened, what's the point of having them. It was then I realized why Whitespings and the Prime site get it so much. There just isn't a benefit to dropping the bomb anywhere else. Plus, this would be a lot of fun.
---
Paint the pieces and leave them on the chassis. Stash the whole chassis in a stash box. The atom shop symbol should be missing. Grab the chassis back out, drop it (should not see a destroy prompt) and anyone can pick it up and use it normally. Just don't paint over it :) 
---
My buddies and I have an ammo mule on a second account I picked up so that as we level all of our various characters we grab every piece of ammo we find and just dump it onto that character 1-2 times a week, then pull out as needed.  The only things we have a hard time keeping stocked on it are 5mm, .50 cal, Flamer Fuel, and Cryolator Fuel.  Everything else is pretty much in a glut from so many alts feeding into it, especially the melee ones.
---
I'm all for this idea. 
---
Close the application and relaunch.
---
Clearly he is lul
---
Thank you!  This wasn't on my radar and I will make another video to add this as well!
---
What nuke thing?
---
Server hop to be able to leave your armor take the vault suit off and get back in and it should be good
---
I don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs issues with the stash size. Are people just hoarding everything? I keep a reasonable stash of mats that I will always need and then bulk and sell all the rest.  The increase to 600 was perfect in my opinion. I‚Äôd much rather have to do some inventory management than deal with a laggy server that is trying to keep up with the hoarders.

Can....Can..... can we get the kitty as a companion?...please. :-)
---
Agreed!
---
Tried that one 5 times before coming to reddit to ask for help, thanks though.
---
Or Dark as a Dungeon.
---
For me the OP build seems pointless because I already breezed through hardest content in a group of three all under level 60. The SBQ fights had more people obviously because most people in the server jump into those. The only grind I look forward to now is caps to buy mutations or nuke zone material for the decon shower. That shouldn‚Äôt take more than a few more days. Is there a point to OP builds other than bragging rights? The upcoming hardcore PVP servers will most likely require a new character because otherwise the dupers will dominate those right from the start. 
---
The Bethesda dude noted that this was passed along to the team. 
---
Tricentennial T-51 is probaboy the best pa paint out of any pa paint sets period
---
You must be me.
---
I'm not there yet I'm only level 70, but I think later on a prestige system say every 100 levels you can reset your special back to the start but you get 1 extra point at 51 then reset at 100 again another point at 52 and so on. Maybe add this after a year or so to draw players back or when they are done adding DLC so you still have something to do.
---
Wow much needed and valuable items to have, here's my caps Bethesda /s lol
---
It was the all bean diet and recycled air that ruined the V76 relationships for good. 
---
How would you feel about someone if you had to smell their insides for decades?
---
Small tip, Deep Pocketed in Raiders Chest piece gives you 10 pounds while simple Pocketed gives you +15 instead; so in this particular case Deep Pocketed is actually worse (might apply to other chest pieces).
---
No idea why it works the opposite of limbs so I'd say it's unintended.
---
If they let us bulldoze down broken homes in towns and let us set up camps there, you could have your own community, by faction.
---
What level and what platform?
---
&gt;(which will meet it's nerf death in a week)
---
Don't worry to much, explo will remain king for now even nerfed.
---
&gt; What's next?..... melee nerf?......unyielding armor nerf?......level 70 weapons/armor? 
---
Most likely, yes it is what will happen.
---
&gt;I 'm okay with a reset every so often to keep the grind going. 
---
You mean like invenotry wipe?
---
&gt; I haven't even had time to finish my character build after 300 hours of play and my weapons are already getting nerfed. 
---
Pretty much the same for me, almost done but I know most of my weapons &amp; armors will end up nerfed because I'm seriously overpowered.
---
Dense and many other mods don't unlock by scrapping. You must find the plans. Be careful, there are two plans called Plan: Dense Combat Armor Chest, but one is the Marine armor chest unlock (it is mis-named). Dense is the most rare, I'm still looking for Leather and Metal Dense plans.
---
Dreaming of the day I can assign perk cards to my stash box. C'mon you stash box! Learn those inventory management perks! Be the junk rat you were DESIGNED to be! 
---
Console or PC? If console you can try resetting your connection.
---
Reduced weight
---
Did you check your email for a ban?
---
For sure. The golfer ghouls are much lower level, I believe 15-22. Do this exclusively in order to complete the quest.
---
What platform? I have a level 15 on PC just sitting in my stash I think. I'd have to check when I get home tonight 
---
I think just dropping stuff in containers where it'll be stumbled upon is a better route. They're much more likely to take it if they know somebody dropped it with no strings attached and they can decide if they need it or not without taking it just to be nice. Downside is it might be lost forever if nobody takes it. 
---
Even at higher levels now I like finding these community cashes. I've been routinely finding one in the trash can in the flatwoods red rocket. I leave the stuff alone except the plans. I'll usually take one/leave one (or five) if there's a plan in there that I've been after. I hang onto any rare plans I get that I already know so I usually have something equal or better to leave. I just wish Bethesda would make this a thing and make the containers retain stuff in certain containers indefinetly and not just till the server crashes or whatever else makes the container refresh.
---
Events,  explore... wait for new content.  
---
Personally,  I'm working on "discovering" all the mapped locations I missed and exploring mines 
---
no more then me wanting the "hear human human human... I have a treat for you" the super mutants say for a ringtone.
---
Believe I'm 22 now and one the sex box one
---
I didn't see any skins. Just camp stuff (the bed, a chandelier, a lamp, and a stone column), a camera pose, and an icon.
---
I think its something like 15-20ish? 
---
yeah that'd be a nice addition, now I just need 1 more
---
UH, AND a starbust ceiling lamp which I Bought!
---
But the pink castle bed really seemed like it should have been part of childs play. 
---
I don't expect them to always have something that appeals to me. It has been a while since they have had some serious stuff
---
But having a tantrum over some cosmetic game stuff seems a bit out of proportion. 
---
You can only get it from the dev room at the moment.
---
On the xbox unfortunately!
---
I was playing this morning, and easily ran into 5 or 6 others doing a couple of events. Maybe you just have a weird server / connection issue that's bumping you to odd or less populous servers...? 
---
geez, 50? I got stared with the enclave early thanks to some helpful stranger. Sounds like I may want to wait, I'm only 32 I think
---
There's copper, gold, and Rich Black Titanium nodes there too.
---
Bethesda should really look in this shit. *if* it was a bug it's really serious. and it's happened way too many times.
---
but I do have the perk to make them weigh less, so maybe I could find something better
---
Honestly I think a lot of people are really just paranoid.  I started being paranoid after getting on the reddit and hearing all the horror stories.  One way to help ease people's minds if you looking to help is just ask them if you can drop some stuff in exchange for a picture.  Also as someone who in general wanted to do things on my own, I did not like receiving armor and weapons but I would never turn down plans and food if offered.
---
If you've beaten all of the quests and finished all of the events, your options are more or less limited to:  
---
A. Grind for more XP and/or the chance for more gear  
---
B. Grind the SBQ for plans to end-game gear, like serum recipes  
---
C. Interact with other players, for good or for evil, as you choose  
---
D. Find another game to play until BGS releases new content
---
Hmm never noticed, wonder when I got mine then..all well thanks for clarifying 
---
Ah, sorry can't help then. Best of luck
---
 continuity error!
---
Mmmm, meat seconds.
---
Do you not remember abominations? The Zetan human hybrid? Dont be close minded dude.
---
Have you ever entertained the idea that it was specifically designed with you and only you in mind? It's not for everyone and it doesn't at all effect game play. How childish are you that you'll let an optional cosmetic item ruin your entire game experience? Their sure are a lot of people complaining about Fallout 76s non essential and satirical elements that leads me to believe that they don't get what Fallout is all about and really just love to complain.
---
Thanks for the warning!
---
I can make you a weapon or two and give you some ammo if needed, my GT is Xwolfpackleader 
---
Set your mic to area and let the lowbies around you that the gear is Available.
---
If not continue to have lowbies running away
---
where is the vendor at camden park?
---
Aye, got one low level on xbox here if needed. 
---
Eh, they're still in the 'Childs Play' phase.  Doesn't sound like any items I would buy.  Still, gives me time to save up more ATOMS for something I would.
---
I did now that you say that lol but I would have no reason for a ban. Plus no I did not have any email besides the welcome to Bethesda.net account successful.. blah blah.  
---
I've explored like half of all the locations I could finish them up
---
Yeah I searched a bit around before posting this and I'm not the only one
---
Will try 
---
Wow. You‚Äôre really dying on this hill aren‚Äôt you?  LOL
---
Newsflash: The game has already failed.
---
I am inclined to believe the game is going F2P because it‚Äôs very believable: It‚Äôs a natural step for live-service games that faceplant on launch.  Why would this be any different?  So yes, while this is, strictly speaking, just a rumor, it‚Äôs a rumor that is sensible and has precedent from other titles.  And the only folks who can ‚Äúdebunk‚Äù this are Bethesda, and they aren‚Äôt saying much of anything these days.
---
As a wife who loves all aspects of fallout, my female side can't help but be obsessed with CAMP building. Ask her to sit with you and help build and decorate your camp. You can then sneak in trading the controller to build, then slowly add in trading the controller to scavenge. Another thing is tell her to hold the controller so you don't die while you go to the bathroom... Chances are she may end up roaming around on her own while you're gone :)
---
I meant a reset as in your gear is no longer up to par....ex. lvl 70 gear.
---
And then the eventual posts about how cheaters found a way to steal your power armor in those stands or steal those weapons you have on display will come flooding in.
---
This is right up my alley, I will try when I get home, thank you!
---
Right. And look at your stats in the bottom of the screen where it shows physical, energy and radiation protections on the right hand side. Look at both equipped and unequipped. 
---
Challenges have been my go to. Not even for atom points, just for something fun to do. 
---
Also trying to unlock all building plans is a goal of mine. And all map points. I know I have gotten some but never actually gone thru every location fully. 
---
Lol, this is such a heartwarming story :)
---
Awesome thanks, my GT is Scawteh!
---
I guess from the rampant downvoting that I missed the joke?
---
Well, shit happens.
---
Anyone tried building a set of stairs on it yet?
---
The next Pylon up from the monorail elevator you can build inside of, it‚Äôs pretty high up so you have a great view of the cranberry bog and there is a junk node there. 
---
Go away.
---
I tried the rubber band and I still got kicked
---
Ah, bummer
---
This is when you turn on the radiation emitters you stuffed in your basement. "I didn't kill him, the radiation did!"
---
Teamwork-Oriented Wasteland Neighborhood System
---
There's a sort by weight option? 
---
Camp McClintock is always good to hit quickly each day, lot of military ammo bags seem to spawn there for ballistic fibre and especially good for new characters to farm as a fair amount of other useful stuff can usually be had there, plus basically zero risk since the Gutsys are higher level than anything around. 
---
I'll check it out, thank you
---
Dang, thought they fixed it for good this time, thanks for letting me know the 2 person methods are still around.
---
Increases thirst instead of radiation damage. 
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary is good for this, too.  There are six strings in A-Block, two in D-Block, and three in the yard.
---
I think this is a good idea. A lot of players have suggested shared stash boxes, where you can put in items for anyone to take. 
---
Seems logical that having this kind of box would be great as well. Community first aid kits. 
---
I also think it could be done so that lets say you put in 20 Stimpacks. You could also set it so that a person would only get 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise people would probably just take everything you put in it. 
---
Interesting idea but it wouldn't go with the lore since scorched have a hive mentality with scorchbeasts being the one in control.
---
I am needing a plan for a switch for my garage door. Any idea on how to find one?
---
thanks!
---
What this guy said. Unbulk the mats needed if you have mods on hand too.. 
---
Same. I want that Rocket powered puncturing heated Protest Sign.
---
"Jobs today or BLOOD ~~TOMORROW~~ TODAY!"
---
+karma Good job man this is a great name for this. 
---
Are you that assertive with raiders too?
---
Look for places with gulpers. They drop about 6 each. Theres a bunch in the toxic valley and the mire. 
---
Oh ok I see, I wouldn't be against a reset every or so few months but my bet is they will release highter lvl gear as long as new DLCs.
---
Not sure how easy that pipe is to get on but I do know there is a bush you can stand on, I did it with ease but with marsupial.
---
I just want a deer head mask. Take the model for the wall mounted deer head, make it a mask, take my caps!

---
Peerblock and selective blocks?
---
Aren't we all? 
---
I thought I‚Äôd hate the fact that other people can just come by and kill me but I‚Äôm actually finding it really interesting when I come across other people. I‚Äôve only had one vaguely negative experience so far. 
---
Thank ye kindly good sir. 
---
There also blueprints in the enclave archive in the room with the power armor stations
---
Wait...i'm sorry...let me get this straight. You logged in and said today, I'm gonna nuke that queen and get that sweet sweet loo....wait. holy smokes! I don't want to spend my atoms on anything available right now! Well to hell with this game! Is that how it went down?
---
I like fallout 76. But to me it just felt rushed, they have plenty of money. They should have taken a few more months before release. Fallout 3 was a masterpiece they should take their time just like they did back then. 
---
This is actually a good idea. Don‚Äôt think people realize with specials being increased that would mean creature lvls would increase, making it still a challenge. What‚Äôs the point of fighting when there‚Äôs nothing to gain but blood and gore and severed heads lmao. Players lvls and creature lvls need to be raised to keep this game going. It‚Äôs getting boring fighting a lvl 68 ghoul or lvl 90 deathclaw and I‚Äôm at 140. Things just go down too fast. We need lvl 200 almost for monsters to fight now. I‚Äôve seen players in the 300‚Äôs lvls. This game needs a proper update and not some fix or patch. Really hope Bethesda pays attention to Reddit. There‚Äôs too many ideas going to waste here if they don‚Äôt.
---
Who cares? Except raiders aren't the better looking guy stealing the girlfriend, they're the pasty loser  asking to smell his fingers afterwards.
---
Plus, the guy can just move his girlfriend 2 inches to the side, and she's good as new.
---
Yep. Dumped a 2 shot last night actually.
---
Agree, is the faster way to get lead, no need unblock any security, just join gym carry lead and get out. I ever do it
---
Join a player faction and do a spot of role play.
---
I havnt finished all the quests myself but I'm seriously having alot of fun joining these player made objectives 
---
another pro-tip: please, please do not build your CAMP at the pond across from Charleston Station. There are better places to build, I promise!
---
It prevents the roaming Responder vendor-bot from spawning. 
---
Me and my friends have done this, great fun. 
---
I was hoping I could center some plants or things on it.  That is so disappointing.... thnx for the heads up. 
---
Think some of those trades are people looking for dupes, maybe. I was in Watoga at level 18 (heard about the cap on the handmade plans and ran down to get them before I forgot about it) and some guy at level 146 gave me a trade offer, checked my inventory and bailed. I‚Äôm assuming he wasn‚Äôt worried about me giving him a challenge at almost 130 levels lower. 
---
That's awesome, strangely I see people every single time I play! After realizing that a couple of weeks ago I started paying attention. Yesterday I was in some random area and all of a sudden there was a dude running. I don't mind at all though. Kinda fun to just wave and be on our way.  
---
I'm in the same boat. Only issue is that I got to level 100. Did multiple nuke events, and just about everything you could do. Now i'm bored. Nothing else to do, aside from grinding. Any advice? I play solo.
---
Love you.  Keep doing what your doing.  These Reddit downvote abusers can silence us no more!
---
I haven't seen Grahm since beta sadly. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what this means
---
Maybe what we need is a website "Find Graham" like we did with Xur, lol.
---
All Quests Done
---
All Events Done
---
All locations found/visited
---
Full sets of every power armor... done
---
Full set of non PA armor ... done
---
All the unique outfits collected
---
Grinded SBQ for the serum recipes (2 left)
---
Max level Bloodied/TS/TSE/Anti armor version of my weapons... done
---
All challenges ... well some are just bugged and can't be completed.
---
enjoying time with friends in the waste land doing whatever... Still ongoing.
---
Basically, once you've done it all... it's just the people left to keep you entertained.
---
What do you even do in the game after 400 hours? I ran out of things to do after 150 hours, explored the whole map and did all the quest by that point.
---
Ive kinda done something like this like i only wear bos combat armor 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done quest with my other 2 characters, and it takes a while. But I do love to game, but for a third time to play trough all these quests. I prefer to have my character how I want it before I‚Äôll do those again. So I‚Äôll check out white springs! 
---
I've had that reaction too... no where near your level, not legendaries.  One Character found the plans for the Marine Wetsuit (I think it looks way better under armor than the vault suit) So, I've offered the 1 or 2 extra I made to people.  All refused.  With the bans and dupers I think people are reluctant to take an item they aren't 100% sure is authentic....  but if you happen upon a legendary power fist and throw on a little armor piercing and happen to drop it in my general location, I wouldn't object...
---
Glad to know i'm not the only one
---
Protective is supposed to come from the end of the free states quest line. It's why you can't get shielded, because they're sequential. At least that's what the data miners say.
---
I downvoted you. This isnt your typical hoarding style Fallout game. The devs gave us a cap to force us to try and play a new way. I'm level 145 and I had a hard time for the first 50 levels not keeping everything I found. Through playing I have come to realize most things are extremely easy to find. I make it a douche bag point to not allow my stash over 400lbs. If it weighs .03 I keep a maximum of 150. If it weights .1 I keep no more than 80. Bulk and sell the excess.
---
I do not feel like we need a weight limit increase, as shitty as this is to say, change the way you play the game. This is all my opinion and how I decided to play to fit within the limitations of our new Fallout world.
---
Yeah. The mutation symptoms are really interesting.
---
Totally agree. Pve players are SUPER ENTITLED and just WA wa WA wa all the time. 
---
I think the raiders are better looking usually.  But I'm just a random gay guy, what do I know? :p
---
Ive done all pa
---
Honestly I'm also a stealth rifle build with a suppressed gauss rifle. I'll have to pop back in later when home and share with you my build and maybe you can get some ideas. I have 14 points in luck though, including 3 points in tormentor. I do have the 3 individual rifle perks and tank killer 3 as well. The only weight management I have is junk rat 3, nothing for food or water. What changed the game for me was "batteries included" perk for all the bullets I carry around for my gauss rifle and the cores for my power armor. Two points in that was a significant impact on my weight management. I wouldn't waste it on food. You can carry a good deal of purified water and Salisbury steak without it affecting you or going bad. So in the end, those are the only two things I do for weight management. Though I do have two perks each at two points for satisfying more hunger/thirst which I may have to revisit and maybe I can free up two points there somehow. 
---
To be fair anyone defending the raiders gets mass downvoted on this sub
---
I can help also if you come to PC lol

---
Your icon idea is really good, but I can only imagine the frustration of a pvper logging into a server and fast travelling around to find other players to pvp with and seeing everyone with a "no pvp" symbol. Then they server hop to try again, etc.
---
I think the icons should also show in the social tab for everyone on the server.
---
They really need to separate those that want pvp and those that don't on different servers. It doesn't matter which side you are on, with only 24ish slots for players on the server, its not a great experience if half of the people on that server don't want to participate in your game style.
---
Always sort this sub by new. Crappy suggestions and complaints from pacifists run the front pages.
---
Clever as shit.
---
Yes, it drives me nuts that weight reduction perks are pretty much "absolutely must have" perks.
---
I'd rather have all those cards be passive.
---
[Here's one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ywbl6/starched_genes_diluted_radaway_mutation_gone/?sort=confidence) of the posts about newly max ranked cards not working until next login, though that was a couple months ago.

Lol it's scary cuz it's going to happen
---
"Real people will always be the ~~best and~~ worst content you could ever experience in a game."
---
FTFY. Screw multiplayer. 
---
There‚Äôs a couple ticks in the lumber by 76. Kill em all, get the tick blood, hop servers.
---
These are a must
---
Why don't Bethesda just let players choose easy mode servers that let them have a very high carry weight? Hoarders need love too...   
---
Exploring sure is fun! But I wanna keep that for when I hit the level I want. 
---
First, sir, you are a gentleman and a scholar: thank you for this elegantly simple idea.  It was very useful!
---
Second, I can confirm a total of 7 flechettes, for those who are interested.
---
Third, your idea was also terrifically useful in illustrating the spread and drop of the flechettes over range.  Naturally both effects are expected, but the wall perfectly illustrated the effects in a clear graphical presentation.  In fact, windows with mullions perfectly create a crosshair to aim at for target practice and calibration.
---
Fourth, I tried the idea on a rock wall, and harpoons in fact act like railroad spikes do by creating a physical footrest to stand on.  Only there are seven of them, which makes scaling cliffs so easy, even without looking at your feet.
---
Thanks again!
---
I feel they need to call the folks that made Ark and Conan Exiles so they can learn how to properly code and create buildable structures and equipment.

Don‚Äôt kill my Brahmin either, it won‚Äôt yield anything as it is part of a resource generator.

CHURCH
---
I'm with you.  If it's raised to 800, there will be posts calling for it to be raised to 1000 the next day.
---
It's a *survival* (light) game. You don't need to hoard everything, or run every possible  build with one character.  I manage to have enough mats, keep reserve aid, and run three builds on my main.
---
I sell, give away or drop the extra.  Some folks just have a hard time letting anything go.  It's just pixels!
---
Kill them...Kill them all...
---
Ditto, things have gotten a bit out of hand with the last couple of updates. BGS significantly increased how long you remain infected and I swear the chance has gone up as well. I believe they also reduced the drop rate for cures.
---
But to give you a serious reply, i can remember playing FO1 back in the late 90's and wishing i could play a game just like this. Back then i never imagined something like this would even be possible.  It's not perfect but it's pretty great for what it is, IMO
---
It‚Äôs around Twin and Eloise Lakes I think. Just above the Spruce. The Behemoth is like chilling in the lake having a bath lmao
---
and a dodge
---
Bloodied if your running a build that benefits from that 
---
All they have to do is make maximum player carry weight 2,000 lbs.  At that point you can't move.  Instantly f's over the dupers.  You'll see them mass dump just to get under the weight limit.
---
I did hear about that actually. I'll try moving it a few feet if I get the chance.
---
Wait till you can get starched genes.
---
Its inevitable to happen again
---
Hmmm... someone with Enclave Flair suggesting we flood the Brotherhood with useless plans?!?!
---
Lol exactly. And people have been saying ‚Äúrush‚Äù through content for a while now... like, time has elapsed since the ‚Äúbeta.‚Äù A lot of it. There was a poster on here recently asking for help optimizing his/her build for end-game because he/she was only able to play with one hand and it made using the jet pack difficult. Like, a couple queen runs in. 
---
It was awesome seeing people help, but digression aside, it was probably harder for that player to reach endgame than your average bear. 
---
And only more time has elapsed since then. 
---
Apparently if you don‚Äôt hide in the forest killing squirrels for your first hundred levels you‚Äôre rushing. 
---
Asbestos is my vendor filler. No bulking and each one sells for a cap.
---
This is exactly why I said that non-melee is broken.  But go ahead and argue both sides.  Everybody is stupid but you.
---
Admitting you like bad boys in dirty armor might reveal more about yourself than you intended. :)
---
Meh.  I played through fo76 to level 90 or so and generally enjoyed the game.  For what it's worth, I've also played exhaustively through all the Bethesda, Obsidian and Interplay Fallout games and DLC that I'm aware of save Fallout Tactics.  Hell, I even binged on Fallout's spiritual progenitor, Wasteland, back on the Apple IIc when it was originally released in the late 1980's.
---
All that is to say that I'm both very willing to tolerate more punishment than is generally acceptable in modern video games as well as some level of bugs and such in titles that I enjoy.  I'm not an apologist, however, and tend to call a spade a spade.  Your initial claim that the 'loudest issues' were people accustomed to single player fallout games complaining about things like survival mechanics in their multiplayer fallout rhetorically and factually waltzed past the very real game-crippling bugs fo76 was allowed to release with.
---
These bugs aren't even all in the past, as you seem to imply.  Since the game's release people have been duping, as we all know.  Now, in a single player game such duping simply punishes your own enjoyment of the challenges before you.  In an online multiplayer game like this, however, it also lessens the fun for anyone not exploiting when they're participating in events along side others with TSE armories at their disposal.
---
Your willingness to look past not only Bethesda's failing in fo76's beta period, but their history of generally releasing exceptionally buggy games with pithy statements like "Can't change the past." contributes to the likelihood that they will continue behave this way in the future.
---
If Bethesda is determined to release their future titles as online multiplayer games to better capitalize on in-game micro transactions, it particularly behooves you as a fan to be honest about where they fell short on fo76's multiplayer release.
---
does bloodied have lower base damage when I'm at full health? 
---
Suck a huge one, dupper. TSE are getting nerfed 
---
That's a very good point.  Not sure why I didn't do that now lol
---
Maybe once they are sure their servers are fine a couple months down
---
Have you gone west? I think you need to explore the West and southwest if you haven't yet.
---
I agree. I'm a huge fan of No Man's Sky since the beginning so this is not my first rodeo with games that came out too soon. I do think Bethesda is trying to make it right, so it will be interesting to see what the future holds for 76.

---
Yeah, it was only level 1.
---
Frequently the vaults throughout Fallout didn‚Äôt end happily, this just continues the trend I guess.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by getting crushed.
---
It's my view vs his view. We each think we are the winner.
---
For me, i have no problem with inventory management in the game. In fact, the stash limit broke me of grabbing literally everything and junking it down and storing like I did in FO4. 
---
Now I'm way more selective. As such, I have also learned where to find what I really need. 
---
From his words, it seems like he's not putting any effort into doing that. Just doing the grab it all, stick in the box. And it's frustrating him. At no point does it also seem to think that he could make adjustments to how he plays the game, to remove that frustration he's feeling.
---
So he expects the game to change. They will certainly be raising the stash limit at some point. Hopefully soon. But at this point I can't see them removing it.
---
No matter how much they raise it, I feel he will continue to be frustrated.
---
:) I like the bones of FO76 but i think bethesda has done some very questionable things.  
---
When i saw the email that was all i could think about was the last 2 blunders (one theirs and one they signed off on)
---
Play with a friend?

I think @falloutsearch keeps up to date, and they have a site like ESO fashion

Yup. Been rollin shadowed deep pocket leather for 50ish lvls.

I am level 31 ,will join but i can't fight. But i will be there for the sweet loot. thanks

Hmmm, I might be mistaken, but I believe once you are Wanted, the map stops showing other players.
---
Hey, how about we stop reposting suggestions and look them up in the search before we do so! If the suggestion was great, then it would stay on the front page long enough.
---
I want Grahm‚Äôs meat speech as a ringtone.
---
Thats cool
---
I used to use a lot of weight reduction perks until I farmed up some calibrated shocks for my PA, now I use more useful Strength perks since my carry weight is 325lbs
---
Then don‚Äôt play this game. Go play one of the other hundred other single player games. 
---
I don't see why you think that's a negative.  Check your privilege! ;)
---
Wont lie. On my melee build this is essential! 
---
Because you missed the initial missteps, I think your view is a bit more jovial. There was a time where automatic weapons were a straight hell no. Not because of DMG output but because it would directly cause frame rate drops. Keep that in mind when you read other criticisms.
---
But good to see you're happy with it and for the people that stuck and still stick around.
---
The problem is.........you want your town, and someone else, and someone else, etc, etc, etc.
---
Pretty soon the servers will freeze up because of all the excess buildings.
---
Sorry, but no thanks.
---
i'm not a pop guy but i would buy a Rose pop!
---
When you‚Äôre wanted, other players can see you on map, but you can‚Äôt see them. Or so I have been told.
---
Are they at the Grafton vendors? That's where you buy the BOS combat armor plans, and I know they have other mods too
---
This is correct.
---
PS4, and it is not working for me either. I could not get credit for carrot, gourd, rhodendron, or soot flowers.
---
If you don't want to spec for melee, I recommend an automatic (preferably a 1-star with the furious perk). I am specced for rifle, but I have a furious plasma gatling I switch to on a downed queen or scorchbeast. I don't have any two shots or explosive but that comes in handy!
---
&gt; See this is funny. They're getting their bags, that's not even being talked about anymore.
---
I didn't say it was still being talked about. I said it was part of the comedy of errors that kept people laughing about FO76.
---
&gt; 500 atoms? Fuck them for giving away free stuff they normally charge for, amirite?
---
Nope. Nothing wrong with giving away free stuff. But when that free stuff is a shitty in-game currency that costs them literally nothing, it's a rather shitty compensation for replacing a cool-looking and (presumably) durable canvas bag with a shitty nylon bag and hoping no one would notice/make a fuss.
---
&gt; The "doxxed" customers had their... account name revealed. Oh no! Just like if you played the game normally.
---
[In-game names? Try again.](https://kotaku.com/bethesda-support-leaks-fallout-76-customer-names-addre-1830892930) People had their names, addresses and some banking details revealed. And what was Bethesda's response? "Hi guys, we've resolved this issue."
---
If it was only in-game names that were exposed, why didn't Bethesda jump to point out that nobody was actually doxxed after all?
---
&gt; Duping, in a game? That's a first! Never heard of that happening before!
---
Oh wow, great point! FO76 isn't the first game to deal with duping. Except I never claimed it was. It was just something else that added fuel to the dumpster fire and kept the memes alive.
---
&gt; A dev room? You mean the one you can just clip into from the major city next to the main vendor NPC? Oh wait, that was world of warcraft... you mean the one you use a console command to get to? Oh wait, that's any other Bethesda game.
---
You do realize "it's happened in other games" isn't really a defense, right?
---
As for the "console command", the big difference between FO76 and "any other Bethesda game" is that this game is online, and the things you do can affect real people, not just NPCs. Online games and single-player games tend to take different philosophies regarding that kind of stuff.
---
 &gt; The idea that a "fiasco" is made out of any normal glitch, or the existance of a dev room people hacked their way into, is exactly my point.
---
In a vacuum, "any normal glitch" or "the existence of a dev room" wouldn't be much of a story. But with the heaping mountain of shit surrounding FO76, those things get amplified because it's become a running joke that "every time you think Fallout 76 has hit rock bottom, they prove you wrong".
---
&gt; People want to keep talking about it. It's outrage culture, it's been happening for years.
---
I don't deny that people want to keep talking about it, much like they want to keep talking about celebrities that go off the deep end and fall from grace. People eat that shit up, and it's easy clicks for media outlets.
---
But if you honestly think that's the entire reason people keep talking about the game, and that Bethesda hasn't brought a lot of this negativity on themselves, you're deluding yourself.
---
&gt; Bad games get forgotten.
---
You mean like Superman 64? Or Ride to Hell: Retribution?
---
A lot of bad games get forgotten, but there are certain games that are so bad they live on in infamy. And unlike most bad games, where you have a small, largely-unknown developer, with Fallout 76 it's Bethesda---a typically-acclaimed titan of the industry---which makes Fallout 76 all the more notable.
---
Absolutely. 10,000 - unlimited is what we need. 
---
Well the more suggestions of this topic might make Bethesda pay attention and add this, people like you need to stop being toxic and ignore it if it bothers you.
---
The game is fun, I will say I'm level 49 and growing bored but I know there is TONS to find out there. But will say I'm a filthy casual and taking my time. I'm enjoying the game and not trying to plow through it. The same thing happened with Fo4, I got bored then came back to it, but basically played the game for a year straight. I haven't done anything with other people other than assist and wave. I've been shot at a few times for PVP request but just have ignored them, not risking losing my ballistic weave! haha. But I do enjoy the game, my only real gripe is the server disconnects but still only usually happen once a day for me. (Though last night it happened 3 times in two hours) 
---
I know, much like Fo4, there is a ton to discover and I think one thing about this game people miss on is if you take it too easy, that what the game ends up being. Which is good for some and boring for others. I often challenge my self to explore new areas I know I have no lvl to survive in and sometimes come out the other end alive and a few higher levels under my belt. 
---
Last night I ventured onto the upper right side of the map, can't remember the quest (which were super easy) and while there I explored around to find new stuff. Ran across a gaggle of super mutants right as I started to attack one I spotted the others and realized they were all 48+, no way to survive that. Running away as they ran for me I found myself outloud repeating, "nope, nope, nope, nope". "Must run faster" lol
---
Jazz and Rock sell billions of records whether you like them or not.
---
Love this idea its worked in other games
---
Fair enough. I dig the thought process though.
---
Boring, just a bad version of 4
---
I cleaned inventory and put stuff i want kept in stash, scrapped everything without thinking of selling then bulk then stored just enough i want then dropped everything.
---
My inventory now 1401.   If i get out of excavator PA then get back in, it'd bee 1401/325.
---
My game crashed.  
---
Re-loaded.
---
Now it shows 1401/425.
---
I can walk.  No longer crawling.
---
One question: is it a glitch since it's 425 instead of 325??
---
If i get out then get back in, it will be 325 and I'll be crawling.
---
Indeed once you get wanted you cznt see others 
---
I realized something the other day. I invited a friend to my group and told him I was looking for calibrated shocks. We went to the same vendor and he could see them on his screen but I couldn't. It seems everyone's list is different.  Grab anyone on your server, fast travel to vendors. You will get things much faster!
---
RC
---
No, not currently. :-(
---
I like that radiation during the day perk! I'll have to pick that up next time I level. Usually I'm hanging with people and I share rad sponge.  
---
I love using my assaultron head though, so when I'm solo it's rad city.
---
Yer right. Caps go only so far. Ammo. And materials go alot farther now. Most trades i offer certain mats. Bulk ballistic lead plastic screws and springs. 
---
Or shotgun shells. Wtf do some people need that many shells??
---
If you're running a bloodied weapon I'd definitely recommend taking "Radicool" It gives up to 25 carry weight for 1 endurance and fits right along your build. 
---
This is the real question.
---
Brotherhood of Death Tambos!
---
Not exactly a good chance for patrol duty, just a chance. It can award a wide variety of plans.

Nope, just goes up and up, into the thousands.  Legit
---
Yeah, I'd love to see that in-game
---
I've finally gotten to the point where I'm sick of waiting for obvious QOL fixes.  Going to Nexusmods today and get that feature from a mod.
---
Bethesda should really go to Nexusmods and pay those guys for their work.  Take those features like perk loadout mods, and install them in the base game.
---
I've made my own playlist with all my favourite songs from fallout 3, new Vegas and 4.

Works to increase Gatling crank speed, so I imagine this would also work.

This is the only fallout game that we'll get for likely ten fucking years, the last time I'll see a game from my favorite series for ten fucking years. It was also explicitly advertised by Todd Howard himself in the reveal that you can absolutely play it as a single player game, so I expect to be able to do just that.
---
In other words, sod off. 
---
I understand that you can't see them on the map. But what about the real world. I couldn't see anyone in the game whatsoever. Walked around for a good 30 minutes and tried logging out and in, and I still couldn't see anyone in the world.
---

I looted 47 Legendary Items at WS last night, 28 Armor pieces, and 18 Weapons, One 2\* Weapon, and 3, 2\* armors, all the rest were 1\* and weapons included 3 rolling pins.
---
A couple days ago I did Uranium Fever and got 3 Mutant Slayers Tire Irons.
---
95% of the drops are worthless fodder for the vendors, 4.5% are somewhat useable items, and about 0.5% are good 3\* Legendary Items from my experience at Level 100.
---
Only if they can hook us up with the Sisterhood of Silicone.
---
You mean uranium rock lmao
---
&gt; how you interact with real people.
---
Except interacting with real people in Fo76 is incredibly limited, unlikely and difficult given the poor implementation, lack of social spaces, and lackluster communication tools we've been provided.
---
Yeah. I had marsupial and speed demon and was loving it. I used one diluted radaway to get a small amount of health back so I would not be one-shotted and it took booth my mutations. Argh!
---
I appreciate the role play you're going for here. It's not something that most do well. However from a gameplay aspect. Leave server and don't go back there until you can handle a Beast. They spawn literally right next to Mosstown.

---
That response doesn't make much sense, I am totally lost. People are downvoting me for a question regarding this, can you help me out? 
---
The game in question is specifically marketed to both the PvP and non-PvP audiences; and multiple measures are in place that cater specifically to people who desire zero PvP experiences. In this way, PvP is a core component in the same way that non-PvP is a core component.
---
Does your dad play fallout with you?
---
Lol wait you are selling these for irl cash? What a cunt.
---
You raise a fair point, and I agree with you.  The distinction is the mechanics that you are forced to choose between are horrific. You need supplies (junk, meds, weapons, gear, ammo) to maintain your fighting ability/camp and are penalized severely for carrying supplies: combined with you need perks to carry supplies and you need perks to fight effectively to make the best use of your supplies.  It's a vicious circle of comprising that is not a positive gameplay experience.  If you want to throw in you need perks for situational choices, ie better crafting and opening things - it's just more salt on the wound.  It's bad design.
---
Thanks for taking your time to post, this kind of warnings have already saved me a lot of atoms.
---
Or just forever. 
---
My biggest beef with the stash is that since my perk cards don't apply to it, I see an enormous spike if I put things in it like junk while equipping Junk Rat 3 myself. I wonder if stash boxes can have default perk cards to reduce all item weight by half or something rather than upping the numerical stash limit? Perma-perk cards so to speak. 
---
Class freak T3, and I'm still constantly starving and parched.
---
Fine points.  I tip my hat to you that you are able to play in the original cap.  I don't think its shitty to say change the way you play.  It may be more polite to say you should try this...  but still.  We should always ask ourselves, "can the opposite be true."
---
For how I play Fallout (and not just 76), i want more space, and now that everybody brought it up, varying containers too!  Bethesda will have to figure out what changes to make to keep the highest number of players.
---
One challenge I will issue is that with a higher weight, you are still at your leisure to cap yourself wherever you wish below that point (which I wouldn't necessarily classify as douche baggery).  Then we could both be happy!!!
---
Yes please :)
---
If you increase strength and get the strong back perk, you might be able to offset it. I haven't done the math to see which path is most efficient.
---
Well, and XP but I tend to agree with you.
---
The first comment you replied to was a reply to an idea about making CAMPS something to defend and attack, like workshops. I pointed out that this would force people who didn't want to participate in CAMP destruction to do. 
---
If the stash box can be for one player, then any  display things can be the same way. 
---

best. mutation. ever.
---
I agree whole heartedly, Bethesda put a new spin on the game by making it a multiplayer game. Whenever you make something new there‚Äôs alway going to be a few kink that need to be worked out. I really appreciate something new when showcased with a genre I already love.
---
Thats duper something say would

---
I'd be fine if it just said whatever "chest" piece was on a piece of armor in the description.  That way I could tell one set from another.  I have a friend with 6 sets and he's constantly playing "power armor roulette" when he wants to switch armor.  I only have a X01 and a blank chassis for helping others craft power armor mods.  Half the time I go to fight the queen I pull out the blank chassis first, not helpful....lol

Have a meta quest that requires you to kill them all for a Legendary 3 star item reward.
---
Try 30.. having to fill someone's house to find excavator is hilarious
---
The frame rate drops only effected consoles though so even a lot of people like myself who played from beta on pc didnt experience them, i now consokes have had a rough time sailing so far but my experience has been pretty much exactly what i expected, it probably not even the buggiest fallout ive played
---
Well it's not so important I'm hoping but maybe str for a bit more damage lol.  Or reduced weight
---
It‚Äôs weird though indie games have more servers and endless storage but a big dev has limited storage and no stability 
---
Yeah I'm still shocked at how fast it goes naturally.
---
Nice analysis!  There are some things in here about which I didn't think.
---
It's only a three star, from my experience. Have quite a few pieces which helped me relocate a point from Strength (only 2 star traveling pharmacy needed) and dedicated two points in Agility to something else besides Thru Hiker. It makes a helluva difference. 
---
Yeah thats way too early. Go explore and grind a little first. 
---
That was my journey and conclusion. Maybe it has been brought up a few times. But I guess Bethesda doesn't see the problem. Otherwise they would not go from 400-600 and now it's over a month nothing happened in any of those limits I mentioned. Before everyone leaves the game maybe before the next patch they "JUST DO IT". Just increase the limits in CAMPS, CAPS, STASH as a first step and announce New Content. Just wanted to do it before I forget about this game ;)
---
My cover is blown
---
it wold just be your own pictures. they are stored locally. wouldnt have to download anything
---
Same. And on PC. Also Aster flowers counted as well. (Picked up quite a few around where Savage Divide meets Cranberry Bog)
---
I know the tooltip for the armor reads this way, but equip one of each and see what the actual effect on your inventory is. I discovered that despite what the description says, you actually get the bigger bonus from deep pocketed.
---
It's all good, as level 50 players, we're just having fun running between shacks hiding it out and looting. 
---
And what level do you actually have to be to be able just to take it on? (Without those OP TSE weapons)
---
Leather have high energy resistances. Metal is beast against balistic damage. Trapper have unmoded radrezist. Robot is well balanced. There is not best one, it is about ur build and which legendary efect you roll.
---
Don‚Äôt keep more than 200 of anything unless you plan on using it up immediately. Exceptions can be your screws, springs, gears if you‚Äôre on the repair struggle bus. Yes your building space goes up per level, very little but yes.
---
Can't you farm lead at Lakeside Cabins workshop? If you're going to Camp McClintock anyways just pop a bit east and start that lead excavator! 
---
On my way, I appreciate it.
---
Bulk Lead and Aluminum ... I believe those are the only things that save weight by bulking
---
Yeah strength plus 1 would be cool, I'll try and find a bloodied faster swing speed now, thank you both!
---
I want a news station, but not on the story of the dwellers. No, it's time for the radio DJ tradition of reporting on the news to come back. Make Travis, Three Dog, and Mr. New Vegas proud and give us random stories of the characters like Madigan! Give us old news of Rose! Tales of the Order of Mysteries and Olivia! All of the "adventurers" who could have easily been main characters of their own games
---
Why not go after people at workshops they have taken over?  Whether they like it or not (or actually read it) when they claimed it they were alerted that it means they're fair game for PvP.  
---
Sonar bounces?
---
My hunting rifle can do 55 damage and i think i can go up as high as 65 with some chems.
---
  I will be there anyway because i want the loot.
---
I don‚Äôt see how that wouldn‚Äôt work. There‚Äôs certainly enough points for 15 each for passive/active; your variety will suffer but that‚Äôs better than the current system. As for the Power Trippers that was never a problem to begin with but that could be solved with mutations. I don‚Äôt know what interaction you‚Äôre talking about unless you‚Äôre referring to swapping cards out and getting the same effect as having all the perks anyways at the cost of monotony. 
---
This might just end up being our way out after the looting is done! Thanks for that tip!
---
I‚Äôm about ready to put the game on the shelf. I‚Äôm spending 75% of my time managing inventory.  Sucks the fun right out.
---
It‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd assume, it took me awhile as well haha
---
That sounds like a death wish, considering how many level players frequent the area.
---
Too busy laughing to think about taking pictures...
---
I think he means multiple people, so like multiple camps
---
Your mom needs to give you a SPANKING!
---
Are you kidding? You think the wasteland is here to give you training wheels and kiss your boo-boo‚Äôs?
---
Give me a break. 
---
This shit should be full hardcore mode. No names. Death means you lose everything, not just junk.  
---
Everything else is child‚Äôs play.
---
(No weekly theme pun intended.)
---
—Ä–∞—Å–∫–æ–ª?
---
Another horrible idea set out to make pvp worse I will explain, in the current state of the game a 150 cap bounty is 3 pvp kills or like one grenade going out a window and hitting a base you didn't see.
---
Also if you ever engaged in high level pvp you'd know this, whomever hits for full dmg first wins so you'd basically just be permanent free caps sometimes in the HUNDREDS of caps per kill because of a 150 cap bounty which would completely shut down any pvp and just make an all ready broken system worse. unless your suggesting they can also attack EVERYONE even pacifist players for full dmg at all times as well.
---
"Additionally, there are no long term consequences for destroying people's things" I love it when people level my camp it costs me 40 caps to repair it all and I usually make a few hundred profit(baring them exploiting) so there is literally no consequences to having your base leveled ATM.
---
P.s. you may want to move your base if it's regularly getting attacked chances say you iether placed it on a rare spawn such as the charelston vendor bot, or deserve your base leveled by building to close to the golf club. Played like 500 ish hours only had my base attacked 3 times and one of them was a buddy messing with me, another was a troll who led people to my base and then they leveled it.
---
I think with dupers wrecking things, and also the fact that people would still complain for more of an increase later on, I think working with 600 lbs is sufficient enough (Well, for me, not everyone). I think a better compromise would be to add usable display cases/shelves/mannequins that you can showcase your armor/weapons/equipment that will affect your CAMP budget instead. I believe that would free up the space needed specifically for junk
---
I got the plan the other day in the train car just west of watoga train station.  
---
Or the more experienced protestor's choice....the Bloodied protest sign.
---
There is a reason for the white springs boys to be using bottle caps. On a terminal entry it states that nuka cola was having business retreat/meeting there towards the end of October and to adjust the bots to accept caps as legal tender to cut down on trash around the resort. I can only assume that modus is somehow linked to the main system.
---
That's a good idea. I'll try that when I log back in. But as I was looking around the map, I couldn't see any other people holding a workshop (or it didn't show on the map).
---
I managed to kill one before i was lvl 50 but i had to use alot of ammo  and stimpacks
---
I'm still fairly new at this, so I still spend. alot of time shuffling inventories. Easiest way is to limit the amount of scrap to 1-2 hundred per item (except for rarer items like screws, adhesive, etc...). Also ditch excess ammo you're not going to use. I had 5000 unused .38 ammo before I started cleaning. I don't use many chems, so I started getting rid of most of those too.
---
I don't keep bobbleheads, magazines, or 99% of guns I find. I usually spend some time gifting new players of useful items.
---
Bulking can help with scrap weights, but it's a pain at lower levels, as it uses large amounts of plastic. It is an easy way to add some caps when you have excess.
---
Is this bannable at all?? 
---
Up front, my biggest gripe so far is............**Bethesda Nerfing Rewards so they don't scale with your character anymore.**  I'm sick of 100% of the legendaries from Uranium Fever (and some other events) being useless because everything is level 40 and below.  Please revert that change!  **Events feel SUPER un-rewarding when not only do you have to fight the bad RNG drops, but even if you do get some good perks, it's a level 25 piece that is worthless to your character!**
---
I always try to let everyone hit the legendary.  I'll stab him once, then do the "come here" emote over and over and over while he focuses on hitting me.
---
Sometimes if it's a 1 star, my weakest pitchfork will still one shot him.  I'm fine if people accidentally kill the 1 star.  Not everyone is carrying around an extra pipe pistol for this purpose.
---
What pisses me off is, the people that one shot ALL of them including the 2-3 stars with a TSE Shotgun low health build.  You don't even have a chance to get a hit in.  You guys suck.  Quit being selfish douches.
---
FYI sometimes it comes back to bite you.  There's a popular trader I know that did that while I was watching.  Not trading with him any more.  He can pack sand as far as I care.  If you're selfish enough to screw over everyone at the event, good luck finding people to trade with.
---
Lame af. If you want to read all day just do it. 
---
This whole game is strange haha
---
Well the op is about to be nerfed so that's a good thing. It's less about levels and more about your gear. As TSE has the highest damage output, that's why everyone uses them. However a pro tip is never fight a Beast when it's in the air unless you have some really really strong weapons. Get everyone to a place with an open field and dodge until the Beast lands. Their damage resistance is at least five times weaker when they are on the ground.
---
Yes! Bethesda are you listening?
---
Were the silos soloved rebuilding? Won't get a lot of people on servers with no lainches ready.
---
Thats good to know! Same experience here and im level 83. If you need any help just say it. Im on ps4.
---
I had an impossibly hard time killing them until I got lv3 tank killer 
---
You could try to get the best armor possible for your build.
---
Old world canned goods are da bomb.
---
Since perking the 1* can-do perk, I only make food for the bonus modifier.
---
95% of everything I eat and drink comes from the can-do perk. I dont even have to use the good doggy perk because I have such a surplus of goods.
---
Garbage cans are EVERYwhere üòÅ
---
Might sound mean but this is a multiplayer game. You can't have everything. As a quick tip: bandolier and traveling pharmacy are the best weight reducing perks. I use only those and I'm usually around 140 weight with no junk. Try scrapping more and don't carry 20 weapons all the time. 
---
Bethesda if you're reading this post, please, the game is already way too easy to make it even easier with these type of suggestions.
---
I have several 3\* comedy items I keep just for people to laugh about, including:
---
Rolling Pin, Walking Cane, Tire Iron, Pipe Wrench, Knuckles.
---
I plan to actually use the Walking Cane (Instigating, +40% Swing, +1 Str) to kill low level wanted Players, and video capture it.
---
no, they've officially said mods arent bannable and if you do get flagged for using a mod they will reverse the ban 
---
Similar to me experience, though I've played other fallouts and have played 76 since launch. It's about 95% people who are really friendly and want to help lower level players. The rest... well, everyone needs to finding something they like doing I guess.
---
I have a level 50 version you can have if you want to hang onto it for later. It's not doing me any good sitting in my stash, but I can't bear to just sell it.
---
Not for me man Who was the email from that you got ? 
---
^ this
---
I use to horde stimpacks radaway fusion cores and had to spend most of my int/str perks on weight reduction. After i stopped using power armour i severely limited myself to set values.
---
50 stimpacks, 20 radaway, 10 super stimpacks, 5 damage boost drugs, 5 diluted rad x and two fusion cores for when PA is needed. This is 70ish pounds and all you really need for survival. 
---
Usually have 20 to 40 pounds of extra weight in my bags. At any vendor i come across if i have any extra of the above items i just sell em.
---
Honestly the way i see it if you using anything more then anything listed above in a fight you probably shouldn't be fighting whatever you are.
---
Curious to know whose you saw as mine is located there haha. 
---
that ghoul pre-launch event is one of my favorite moments from 12+ years of playing wow.
---
for the first two days, there was a bug where all ghouls, both factions, could talk to each other.   
---
so I, as a member of the horde, would ghoul myself and gather up alliance players and lead attacks on their own cities.
---
and right before we all exploded, i thanked them for their service to the horde.
---
Don't you mean "too hard" in your title? 
---
I‚Äôm not doubting you but i‚Äôm very cautious around this topic, do you have a link or something i can google to find this?
---
&gt; A working fridge for my food so it lasts longer.
---
I am pretty sure food in your stash doesn't degrade. 
---
I don't keep everything, but I go through lots!  I like to play with my C.A.M.P. build and make stuff to take apart for plans.  The way this game is setup, that costs a lot.
---
As far as builds, I would never try all on one, but I just can't yet bring myself to actually play my alts (currently just used for storage).  I have so much invested in my main at 160 with more I want to try.  Any time spent leveling alts is time my main isn't progressing.
---
Base building gets marginally larger as you level up though it's not really obvious. I've noticed that editing your base in build mode will show the increase.
---
For you stash, scrap all junk. There are some junk that needs to be junked manually (scrap assaultrons head, etc) they weigh a lot and could probably be causing the build up of weight. Dump any extras of junk that you don't really use.
---
Get perk cards to reduce junk weight or wear armor that reduces junk weight. 
---
Don't keep any non legendary weapons and gear you aren't using. Even for low level, single and double star legendaries, if you don't need them, sell them or give them away.
---
Because all the echo chambered, bitter, whiny asshats spend all their  time on the forums complaining about a game they don't even play.
---
All the nice/good people are actually in the game playing.
---
I‚Äôve gotten 3 paints and 2 bomber jackets after 400 
---
I think after lv30 or 40 you spawn in more charred feral etc. If you are looking to finish the quest, look at the map when people are at whitesprings. If there is someone around lv 20 ish go there. His mob spawn will include atleast one unruly golfer.
---
I saw a post about this. Tried it and got almost all of them in 1 run.
---
PS hit me up if on PS4. PSN: postalslave. Always like to help people out with gear, ammo, meds and limited modding services where I can.
---
For your base size, check that you dont have a bunch of stuff stored but not used (the second tab).
---
Otherwise, you dont need so many turrets, unless you plan on camping whitesprings, which you should not.  
---
Its possible to build some really great 3+ level 6x6 homes or other grand designs, with a resource extractor and several water purifiers if you dont drop 6 turrets or use heavy turrets like missile or heavy laser. 
---
Am I the only person on earth to consistently read SBQ as "BBQ"?
---
I am going to get tested for dyslexia....bbr.
---
I use a suppressor gatling gun, the speedy receiver puts out favorable damage and the damage debuff to the scorchbeast isn't bad at all, I recommend it
---
Why would ANYONE want a plan for a wooden barn door.
---
Wait- the statue doesn't fit...but the planter does?  Your point about the planter is that it doesn't center it?  Can't you center it yourself?
---
Have max caps?
---
Whitesprings and Watoga were problems for sure, but i had crashes in random places as well. I crashed in flatwoods several times and out in the middle of nowhere.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. You captured all of my design frustrations with this game with this post. If I had one word to describe this game, and it wasn't buggy or glitchy, it would be tedious. 
---
It's also an easy way to farm ammo as well since so many scorch spawn every server hop. They are all level 1 so any melee weapon will work regardless of perks 
---
I'm a console player. Not sure if I can dig into save files and get them on Xbox. I can screenshot then and share them no problem.
---
I probably wasn't very clear in my initial suggestion, though the main benefit to me is less perk card swapping. As an alternative maybe after level 50 your SPECIAL stats stop increasing but you can still add more perk slots. One would think there's a possibility they may add more perks in the future.  
---
Also, I don't think having 25 more perks (or points divvied up amongst how ever many cards) is going to make you a badass at everything. There are a large amount of QoL perks which anyone that survives for a long time in a wasteland should have. Those alone will eat up quite a few of your slots. If you're like me and you then want to say, specialize in non-automatic rifles, maxing those out is another what, another 6 pts at least? Then add in the perks to repair your guns better - there's another 3. You can very quickly use up 75 slots and still only be a master of a few disciplines.
---
If balance for PvP is an issue, now that there's a special mode for just that it seems like the logical solution is to have certain differences with perks or whatever that are different for that mode. Honestly, the same should apply to nerfing weapons, while they're at it...
---
Is FO76 F2P yet ?
---
*yawns*
---
Nope - there's still fog/mist, rad storms still happen, regular rain still happens.  Had all of those happen this weekend
---
Sorry I missed the part about the game world ... not sure. My guess is a glitch, unless an entire gaming party blocked you. But I really don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve only had a couple of PvP encounters.
---
You may want to be careful...they are banning people for doing just this sort of thing. They also said they are tracking it more now too....
---
Sadly you can‚Äôt shoot the robots at the DMV do this won‚Äôt be possible. 
---
just destroy couple roleplayers houses and pvp comes to you 
---
Fissure site prime is where the scorchbeast queen has her CAMP.
---
When you nuke it, she gets understandibly upset and comes up to complain about it.
---
Story-wise, by killing the queen, no more new scorchbeasts, and no new scorched.
---
I pretty much only use stash for junk and sit around 400 consistently 
---
Agree with more enemy spawns though lots of areas are pretty boring to walk through 
---
It's every tree and plant too. The vines attach to all living things. Not one plant is untouched in the Mire. You can't even find wood to loot from a fallen tree. Because it's ALL *alive*.
---
For me no, but once again I haven't thought of that as I have many missing camp plans so decontaminating shower is one I dont have so mybad. I've searched the map alot but at 1 luck I get crap for plans armor and loot so I'm pretty far behind I'm sure even at lvl 65.. 
---
I scrap everything 
---
No, you can‚Äôt center it. It stays in the corner like is about to fall. 
---
OMG seriously? I'm literally going for a Gatling + slugger build. 
---
I know, I saw the tears...
---
Haha I could imagine! The times I've killed them have been with the help of the massive turrets!
---
Griefers should be punished, one way or another.  
---
Yeah it is, you have to reload, it's annoying but at least we have a work around. Also try get shocks for your legs if you can, it adds another 50lbs per leg. I found one shock at Camden, I got lucky I guess and have been farming for a 2nd leg without success, but I will look out for it.
---
Also make sure you have tru-hiker level 3 if you carry a lot of food like I do, this helped me a lot and also the battery perk if you carry a lot of fusion cores. I am still around 1800 though, I have tried dropping stuff, but you know it is hard :)  Hopefully one day they will fix the stash ...
---
üòÇ
---
Beautiful
---
Sure I‚Äôll give a hand with the queen 
---
I think that's the point, turning them in "one at a time" with a stack is no different from turning them in together. They give quite good rewards, sometimes rare plans, so i think turning in 20 at atime would get crazy with how often you find them. Treasure maps stack though so I suppose technical documents should as well logically.
---
Did you clear your cache ? Sometimes games just don't work on certain xboxes, not sure why but it happens.
---
Join the game
---
Yep. Russian Lit. major. My Russian is awful though from disuse.
---
Now that i am lvl 105 those beast are nothing. 
---
I regularly get people to pick up my gifts, here's the steps (mainly level 40 players and below):
---
**Step 1 -** Make sure they're in the area and not moving around a lot (aka not running).  Drop JUST stimpacks.  It's quick, and you can switch to the "come here" emote and show them the bag.
---
**- If they ignore you**, or run away, or otherwise don't take the stimpacks.  Move on, no need to get frustrated playing Santa Claus!  Plus you only took the time to drop 1 item, so it's fast to pick up and move on.  Find another player, move back to Step 1.
---
**Step 2 -** Drop other useful items that are fairly quick (other meds, weapons, armor, etc).
---
**Step 3 -** Drop JUNK LAST.  It takes longer to scroll through that list and drop quantities of 10-15 items.  If they grabbed stuff from Step 1 and Step 2, they know you're giving gifts and are committed to sticking around to see if there are more gifts.
---
**Step 4 -** Give a friendly wave emote, heart emote, and run away.  That lets them know that gift time is done.
---
Hope that helps!
---
I'm not sure. I might contact Bethesda for it. I'm trying to make it a fun, rewarding experience. Anyone need an Ultracite Fusion Core?... That type of thing. 
---
They are half-assing legendary items.
---
Metro Exodus comes out in less than a month.
---
They really better rethink this.
---
Loading up now üëç gt KnowledgeHound 
---
ANITBIOTICS
---
The recipe is in the enclave medical wing.
---
Also, the fountain in the gazebo at whitespring cures diseases.  Very handy when farming ghouls at the golf club.
---
Agreed...  The conversion makes it tough to track and plan.  Plus, I think it shows you weights based on your perks even if you're looking in the stash.
---
Radium rifle irradiates people with its shots, but its not a legendary and I'm not sure any legendary versions of it exist
---
Each having having a certain ability like that would play into each factions story pretty easy too.  Solid.
---
Are you located in the US? I don't really know how servers work but if my Australian friend joins a server it is Australian based if I join a server it's US based. For him to play on US servers he has to join my game. I suggest making a friend from Mexico and joining on their game. If you are located in Mexico then just disregard everything I said. I'm just guessing.
---
&gt; 95% of the drops are worthless fodder for the vendors
---
Hooray, 20 pounds of lame to carry to the vendor for 2 caps.
---
I also agree that you should bulk and sell more then 200 of anything with the following exceptions:
---
Ballistic Fiber  
---
Gears  
---
Oil  
---
Screws  
---
Springs  
---
Waste Acid (smelting)  
---
Waste Antiseptic (medicines)  
---
Be aware there are also other resources that you cannot bulk, or do not need to in order to sell.  
---
Oh wow, thanks for the damage resistance info, was unaware of that. And I'll keep an eye on when I have a chance to get better gear. Thanks for help :D
---
Rumors cannot be debunked, otherwise it wouldn't be a rumor.
---
I like first paragraph 
---
False.
---
Ark?  I've got like a thousand hours of ark and I'm wouldn't call ark building much more free than falllout.
---
So accept the encumbered life. 
---
Serious.
---
I hated fighting a 325 weight limit on what I could do, so gave up on being able to fast travel and went with a 1300 carry weight limit. 4x your base carry is where you enter stage 2 over encumbered. And I have been having so much more fun this way than I was before, always having to give up useful stuff, not having enough stuff on hand, always traveling back to base because weapons break and I need them all in working order to keep going.
---
It's a bit of a rough adjustment to make, and takes some getting used to, but you may find that with the right strategy that you don't really need to jump all over the map all the time.
---
Just 2 - Marsupial and Speed Demon.  Less INT and increased food/water isn't a big issue.
---
This.   It's not a ton, but it's enough to always be making ammo.   I usually run out of steel long before I run out of lead.   
---
No I just think it's the funniest sign in the game
---
I'd be curious what you carry around.  
---
I also run a non PA rifle build with all 9 perks, and I agree that inventory management can be a pain, so for what it's worth I addressed it by:
---
* completely stopping 100% collecting junk unless I'm actively farming a specific mat.  
---
* stripped away most chems from my normal loadout as I was not really using them enough to justify the weight. 
---
* stripped down to 2 rifles, 1 ranged and 1 cqc as those things are heavy and really I don't need more than 2.
---
Thanks to the above I have 150 or so lbs free after selling everything I don't need, and I mostly devote that to legendaries, stuff I plan to sell, and if I'm forming mats the junk specific to that goal.  
---
I no longer view weight as a problem but rally the thing that changed it was stopping 100% collecting junk.  Up until then inventory management was indeed a hassle.
---
Is there a way to on PC?
---
You're welcome
---
That is pretty epic....lol
---
I'm in the US but this makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
---
well I'd like to push the idea of the sides being different 
---
I've given myself the challenge to role play as Jason Vorhees and it has definitely been a challenge since I've not yet unlocked all the gladiator perk cards and I am still looking for a good legendary machete (and pitchfork).
---
I've already spooked people, some of whom made the mistake of shooting me and thereby unlocking full PVP damage.
---
Lord of the Flies.  Take a bunch of people who have tolerated each other while living in a safe, highly regulated and secure setting and dump them into a chaotic hellscape with limited resources.  
---
Dude... I was level 80+ before I completed that quest! I started it al like 20-ish...
---
Wow! I‚Äôm level...7 I think? XD
---
I am a solo player but if you need help, PM me and I can show you the ropes .. if you can't find anyone else hmu
---
Thanks for the reply. Irradiated effect on legendary weapons was my favorite in FO4. I would happy if I use them in FO76 too. But can't find any info about it on internet.
---
They did pre 2004, but now you sale 100,000 records, you are at the top of the charts.   Music sales are pretty much dead
---
Tin cans from noise traps.   9 each and some locations have like 10 traps.   I get a bunch from the penitentiary.   
---
Me not talking about bugs or issues isn't me blowing past them. If you want a post to be worth reading you need to focus on one subject. 
---
I never even came close to suggesting that bugs and balance aren't an issue. I've encountered the majority of bugs people have talked about in here. And no, it has not lessened my enjoyment of the game.
---
No more than finding a typo or a mistake in a book lessens my enjoyment of that book. Or inconsistency in show or a movie. 
---
Because again, it comes down to this. Am I really going to let a video game dictate my emotional reactions? Because that's what it comes down to. How you react to these things. How you react to a video. The stock and self esteem you put into playing a video game. 
---
I don't even care how much the game cost. As long as I am enjoying it. And I am. Bugs and all. I also know this. People lie and exaggerate about the extent of the bugs. I've even gotten people to admit they were exaggerating about the bugs. 
---
That's not to say that there aren't some bad bugs out there. Just that we will never really know the full truth about them. You have to read everyones post, even mine with a grain of doubt. 
---
One guy reported he was being disconnected every 15 minutes. I actually believed him and said, wow, really? He came back and said, no maybe about 30 minutes. And it was twice.

But originally he had said something else. Guess he calmed down and realized he wasn't being honest. 
---
So I am being honest. The thing is, my honesty doesn't match what you want to see and think about the game, so attack my honesty and my view. 
---
Except us poor sods who are lurking while at work :(
---
Horrendous
---
I could definitely get on board with some STASH specific perk cards! You my kind sir deserve a cookie! Shamefully I'm all out, have this upvote instead!
---
Ohh yeah I've never played Far Harbor so that escaped me. Obviously it was just convenient to reuse assets. I'm a terrible critique so take what I say with a handful of salt lol
---
We cant even store more than 600wt in our camp and you want them to implement towns that can be built, stored, and tracked across multiple servers???
---
Children's toys have an unsurprising amount of lead in them. Lead based toys also fit the theme. 
---
Blocks and rattles are my usual pick ups. 
---
Lol, I can easily go through 600-700 hundred shells on a white springs run or SBQ event. I'm a pretty maxed out shot gunner with a quad combat shotgun, it eats shells like no tomorrow! 
---
no, it isn't free, but I feel their building system is a tad better. I'm not asking to create something as intricate like plumbing and electrical technology. Just something to help with base building itself. Personally, I think Conan Exiles did it better, but the game itself is a different discussion.
---
I got the mod at Harper's Ferry vendor
---
Ok, thanks, I understand.
---
Ooh, that would be a lovely feature if the verdant season affected boss spawns
---
Best way I found to get acid is both big monsters (graftn monster, snallygasters, bears) and making sure you grab acid junk (there's a lot more then you think). Acid junk: laundry soap, those colorful plastic bottles (think antifreeze)...

What are you carrying? I have a stealth rifle build, and in full armor with plenty of ammo, two rifles, a melee weapon, ~8 grenades, power armor chassis in inventory, and enough food, water, and chems/stims I barely top 140. And with only 3(+1) STR and no ‚Äúpocketed‚Äù armor my carry weight is 170. 
---
I use no weight reduction perks, and I manage fine. 
---
Honestly, I think carry weight is fine. If you want to hoard, you need to pick perks to offset that. Just like you need to choose between slotting Hacker/Picklock, or swapping them out constantly for more combat perks.
---
Trade offs.
---
Only reason - cause Fortnite.
---
Is this still confirmed to work?
---
I understand it's a single item on a list, but I've farmed that quest at least 10 times and haven't gotten it.   I got a baseball bat mod the last time I did it.   Starting to get discouraged. 
---
Just keep at it? 
---
Well that's lame! I had no issue with lined under armor for the past 39 levels and then suddenly it was constantly happening.
---
Shhh don't let this get out.
---
Server hop at the Mothman Museum for Ticks.  Their blood can be converted to blood packs.  Can also hit  Vault 76 and travel south to the Lumber mill and you'll find some there as well.
---
Like a tent with a campfire and a sleeping bag. And a stashbox...
---
I mean legendary effect, not just radiation guns. An 10mm pistol could have irradiated effect, and give radiation to people, example.
---
Poor little soldier
---
I have had the grounded mutation for a couple of weeks and use Radaway when needed and have yet to loose my mutation.  I keep my Starched Genes card equipped at all times and have not lost my mutation.  Rad-X will still suppress your mutation if you are using full strength Rad X though.
---
I have been disconnected frequently and have had my game crash countless times, but all after having some time in on a server 
---
also depends how fast you spam collect on the ore.
---
Like I said, i think that's what they want you to do. or at least pick up one and save it until you are in the area then turn it in. They have nerfed many resource extractors and rewards before, they don't want players to get items too quickly. Not saying it's good, just how bethesda want it.
---
Yeah, that's why I've said probably, I suspect Bethesda only tracks the Monster Masks now, since they've been removed, to pinpoint the players that were successfully able to get into the dev room again after the patch so to fix it yet again.
---
Also I wonder what's their reasoning behind not including these items in the base game, like you've got both the Marine Armor and Wood Armor sets available everywhere yet their helmets are nowhere to be seen except one leveled list that's not linked to anything. An oversight maybe? Especially since they weren't removed like the Monster Masks.
---
Level 50 is a long way off for me, pretty casual player with work, school, puppy, crushing wall of debt. Thanks tough!
---
I also found handmade plans in a supply drop crate at level 130. Not sure what the odds on that were though
---
**FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits are your friend.**
---
I see people selling Lever Action and Handmade Rifle plans there all the time.
---
You can pretty much buy and sell anything you want there for caps.  I don't even go to vendors anymore.
---
Well shit, I never tought about it being just a display bug. Gotta check it out as soon as I arrive at home.
---
My theory is that 2 part. 
---
1st they rushed to market to beat other high profile RPG's coming out soon. 
---
2nd. They released it like it was because they counted on shaping the game to our liking. We are the beta tester, this is no longer a hired/paid position. They are taking our feedback and crafting the game we want it to be, rather than forcing their vision on us. This is what I hope anyway. 
---
When junk is scrapped to its max point, it should be weightless in the stash.
---
Bloodpacks farm ticks. They‚Äôre lowbie get them before they get huge
---
Acid farm anglers
---
Anyone try placing the Whitespring busts?
---
Tbh only reason I'd want to get it is to bring my C.A.M.P. to maximum levels of A E S T H E T I C
---
Shame, could have been a real hum dinger
---
I've done it at least 10 times now and still haven't gotten it.   I plan to keep trying, but it's discouraging and the quest is so boring.   
---
Why are people hoarding so much, is there a limit to the amount of caps you can have?
---
Isnt being marked as wanted and being able to get one hit by people already enough punishment?
---
No but I ran into a guy who ran on the train tracks whistling and hitting anyone with a super-sledge who got in his way. He was a train
---
Yeah you become a lone survivor if you shoot a camp or somebody so it because a cat and mouse game. Yeah you do that to me, you get an immediately block, depends how quick you move on, if you just testing to see if I will pvp, then I might not. If you a high level you guaranteed to get a block, not all of us are into PVP and couldn't care less.
---
Turn on hunted for hunted radio station to try other people who want to play PVP. Hopefully at the end of the month you guys will get your own pvp servers
---
Ha, are you USPS...? Judging from the ID. :) 
---
To you and OP - Feel free to add me on PSN as well if you have it, SGreenwell. I've also found that 9 out of 10 interactions in the game have been positive. 
---
*chaotic evil*
---
You... you don‚Äôt keep your bobble heads...
---
Mine is still in stash box.  PC
---
It's from Bethesda and yeah sorry to break it to you but your banned for the foreseeable future, you may not have gotten the email, some did some didn't I haven't been able to pinpoint why yet but it may have something to do with the length of the ban but thats just my assumption. But I've confirmed with multiple people who have been getting this code that it is the result of the mass bannings going on related to duping. I didn't dupe myself so I don't doubt you when you say you have no reason to be banned. I didn't either, but I still got swept up in this nonsense. I've emailed and ticketed this issue but have yet to get a response from Bethesda. Here's the email that was in my junk folder. I also got a notice email of my account status being changed but again not all players got that email either. Very strange all in all.

it's been hit or miss, but I have noticed more disconnects this last patch.
---
Deep pockets is the best friend you can have on your armor if you dont want PA... each piece gives you +10 carry along with a couple mutations and QoL perks, I only go encumbered at white spring during a nuke and that's not an issue..
---
I was listening to avenged sevenfold's the stage today and realized one part of it might be great to play while a nuke is impacting
---
"When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war was the only solution for them keeping the score"
---
It's got a similar vibe to the overseer's nuke launch holotape
---
ty :)
---
Yep!  Exactly!  I run low on steel and end up having around 100 or so lead in a day or two.  Then I'll need to go pop a uranium fever Wes Tek for some kills/guns to loot and scrap.
---
As long as we aren't doing 20 SBQ runs back to back I usually end each day with more ammo than I started.
---
"I am become death." While it is a great line in history, it was mistranslated. 
---
Only had 2 disconnects since last patch. Running great
---
I hope Bethesda gives us the plans to build normal looking houses if they don't let us build in them. Like the pieces they use to build them 
---
if you have a two story camp you can't place it on the first level or at least I can't... It gives me the green go ahead and I place and it automatically moves it up to the second floor slightly to the left or right of where I wanted it... Took me 30 mins to get it to line up with the top of my stairs on 2nd floor... I plan to never move again because of it...
---
Yes, I have lost a couple of weapons, and an entire set of 3\* Combat Armor (Equipped), also lost other Armor from My inventory
---
So your saying it's the player's fault and not the game
---
Most likely very late but are you still doing this?
---
I can't fathom how you are lvl 13 after 200 hours. WHAT the hell do you do all day? And how have you only found 3 grenades. 
---
This makes zero sense to me.
---
Have an explosive one. It still radiates
---
You can play spotify on your xbox one while playing any game. Make a playlist for your fallout game. Not sure if ps4 can do that. 
---
Yes please.
---
I'd love some sort of universal auction house.  If it has to be individual player vending machines, PLEASE place them all in the basement of Whitesprings.
---
I do not want to mark my base on the map for griefers by having vending machines up.  I do not want to travel all across the map only to find out you have pipe pistols, .38 ammo, and spoiled food in your vending machines.
---
I have one gun and the rest of my stash is junk. Bethesda plz halp
---
I have 4 mutations. Radaway does not get rid of them. 
---
Girl, I don't even know what it's about
---
juicehead, probably the most popular 76 youtuber, talked with them about it. [click here for the timestamp in the video where he references the convo](https://youtu.be/thv_GuZCHRo?t=70)
---
Their official stance is we dont support them and they could cause the game to not perform properly. 
---
The servers are so small I doubt anyone will really notice a smaller player base. They would just have fewer servers running but each game would be full. Unless there was less than 24 people playing in your region. Which I doubt. I'm thinking it's just some placebo effect making the server feel empty to you.
---
No rad storms lately. Just some minor rain and had a patch of fog this morning near a power substation. (PS4)
---
Can you get the handmade plans (have to be level 15) and mod it to full auto (if that's where you are headed with your build)? Uses up harder to find ammo fast but the accuracy and durability is amazing. Plus, you'll be able to keep making new ones that will stay close to your level up to 45.
---
Time to break out the grief club, I guess There are lots of people to shoot and camps to blow up. I'm just north of Poseidon, if you want to stop by.
---
I am sure that is the tactical and not the marine combat helm which is totally different. 
---
Bullshit
---
Ah. I have not seen any legendary effects that make normal guns radiated. Sorry.
---
Very true, I didn't mean to exclude you.
---
I'm currently playing but every time there's a loading screen I check out Reddit
---
What?
---
I like what you're thinking but I understand why they try to limit us. The more they let us store or build the more of a cost it puts in an individual server. That's why both turrets and light sources cost so much. You'll notice that when things start getting buggy is usually the guys with a huge inventory that get disconnected first.
---
I was so disappointed to find out there aren't any even though it is available to mod in the weapons workbench (weapons like the cultist dagger don't show a mod menu and only appear in the bench if they can be repaired). I guess maybe it's the same weapon and they just apply different "No modification" mods to have all the different messages on the signs
---
A good way to check this forsure is to load up another bethesda title like Skyrim or ESO and you'll very likely be unable to play your old characters and will be greeted with a global account ban notice. Maybe your the odd one out tho who knows.
---
I think it‚Äôs a great game to test just how much fun a human being can create for themselves. In my case, not very much.
---
Derrker derrrd! 
---
I've locked myself into Thru-Hiker because without it, I have 150 pounds of Nuka-Cola, but I'm not getting rid of any of them. I may have a problem.
---
No, hopefully that gets fixed.
---
You can build in a teammate's camp, but you can't move scrap or replace, and it cost's your mats.
---
Can't build at a neutral's 
---
Believe I have the plans but cant get the god damn gun modder card to combine it
---
 What platform 
---
That looks like the ban code on consoles. Check all your email. 
---
Gotta sell them something to cover the Travel costs
---
big dev games have more players though.
---
I will be happy to be your Wasteland freind ..
---
Like the vacant plots you could raze on FO4 Sanctuary, so a former settlement/town etc. 
---
Correct it is the Marine tactical helmet.  Didn't know there was a difference. Thanks
---
No disconnects until i have a workshop or go to nukezone.....
---
I've been using this for a while and I can't go back. I'm pretty sure it's added to instability in the game, since I crash to Desktop most often when entering or exiting the perk page, but it's essential.
---
This should absolutely be part of the core game, and several perks should be made passive, like lock picking, hacking, and requirements for crafting.
---
Come on Bethesda! Maybe reach out to these resourceful moddera and see if you can license their code. 
---
Ah, got it.
---
Did you tried this? [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3nqy8/how\_to\_fix\_framerate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3nqy8/how_to_fix_framerate/eepatod/?context=3)
---
Do you have rads?
---
TBH, it's my roommates PSN. I've been PC gamer for years and holding off on new rig to afford one for Star Citizen, estimated 2137. I got the game to play, but it's his system.  He is not USPS. Have no idea the origins of the name. I go by t33gs/sweett33gs. I'll add you next time I log on. I've been playing a very boring style of server hopping whitesprings for legendary drops so I could use some squad days to improve my goals.
---
Well, all I can say about that is dog gone.
---
yea i just tamed a mirelurk king as a pet i'm sure he will be killed soon
---
Can confirm it works with 12 mutations
---
Do some reading and stay away from the queen until you a high level and can do some real damage, the more players that are there the more buffs the queen gets. The last thing people need are leachers not contributing .. sorry to be harsh but that is a fact. The more people the harder it is to take down the queen.
---
Try r/fo76bazaar/ or r/Market76/
---
If I had the plans I'd offer to mod yours, but I can only do Jetpack for T-51
---
Do you need plans for it? If so, where can I find those?
---
There are some issues with rejoin server.
---
The main one is the Whitespring spawn. Every time a player joins the server, the golf club respawns. I am sure the rest of WS does as well, but who cares, when it takes 2 minutes to run through the golf club with a TSE and pick up the legendaries.
---
You can imagine how much better this is when it's nuked.
---
This is already being used by groups dropping nukes, so I am aware that there's a way round it. I am just pointing out that it's maybe not that trivial to solve.
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
It did a few weeks back it just takes a bit more than normal it seems. It is like they were trying to make that the end game ballistic rifle. Or they fucked up the ratios... I wouldn't put either past them. 
---
Grief
---
Scorched killers can come free from an unmarked quest in Big Bend Tunnel. Nice little touch. Not especially useful tho
---
I have one painted with tricentennial paint so it has an atom marker next to it in the inventory. 
---
I wish I could say the same. Some good interactions would give me a reason to actually play this game again. Im on PS4, and nobody I know has FO76 and everyone I meet online is either a loner who doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me, or people in an already established group who don‚Äôt want anything to do with me. 
---
/signed.
---
I just learned this last night. Was actually a nice surprise when it kept dumping it on my second level; that was where I wanted it, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me place it there originally.
---
Sadly, I now have a stupid concrete hump in front of an interior doorway. But at least I don‚Äôt leak radiation into the comfort of my own home...
---
I think griefs are part of the experience just call them raiders it's fun to be a raider sometimes
---
The need to hoard is actually worse in this game. I'm trying a heavy weapons build and I'm forced to collect and scrap basically every weapon I find just for the steel. A huge chunk of my perk points are for weight reduction. Bandolier, Bear Arms, Traveling Pharma, Thru Hiker, Strong Back, Pack Rat. Probably avg. 2 points in each. 
---
On the plus side, my weight is actually pretty manageable now. With excavator I can can easily carry 100 lbs of scrap and don't have to micro-manage my weapons all the time. It's really ammo that's the big bottleneck for me now.
---
It's basically all non-forest Responder bots that have them. I have seen them at both Graftons, Camden Park, and Welch. 
---
Do you carry Solar Powered? helpful during the day. I try to have 25-35% of my health bar radiated so i can also equip Radicool.
---
Instant plus +8 Strength. My carry weight without PA is sometimes 275 (295 with grilled radstag) and includes Marsupial.
---
That sucks, but you probably will in another level or so. I'd build you one to get you started but I'm on PC.
---
I wouldn't say I completely disregard those two as legendary, I just wish they they were a little more impressive for a tougher enemy. That zealots that I got was a level 50, but only 1-star (I'm level 87). I would love to see new, more epic effects too. 
---
I was recently thinking about this! It would add so much to role playing. I was also thinking that it would be so cool to be able to craft a robot companion to stay at your camp, and sell things you put in his inventory to anyone. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
yep.
---
i sold one of those momentos for like 100k gold.
---
there's a pet that looks almost exactly the same.
---
Inv me if you can, fuze x beastz
---
I need room for the 25k Nuka's I found in flatwoods lol
---
Do you mean brb?
---
Found the time traveler.
---
But what does the Towns in T.O.W.N.S. stand for?
---
im on ps4
---
No I haven't, should shoot up FO4 just for the DLCs haha. It's like any other explosive legendary in this game, if you're on PS4 I can give you demo if you want?
---
but thanks anyway
---
Your a better man than me, I gave up and threw it on the ground floor outside because it kept hopping on my roof while trying to place it indoors.
---
It would be nice for some more variety but I don't mind the songs on at the moment, I only listen to them now n again.
---
Whats the biggest mystery though is where does the music come from? Where's the radio station
---
welcome to the suck. i went back to mhw ... can't bore myself anymore with how lame fo76 is (repetitive and bad decisions) they could make it fun by adding quests (even npcs repopulating the wv wasteland) and by adjusting weights ... simple life balance stuff. however after 3 months of us compiling ideas and sending them to devs i doubt they have more than a couple guys working on the game at the pace they are churning out updates. 
---
/r/woosh
---
Do you have All Night Long or other Slow Metabolizer? these cards and few others in END really help with starvation and thirst
---
No not yet. We'll see what Bethy brings to the table on this next patch tho...fingers crossed for a lot of bug fixes, quality of life improvements and some resolve for these damn game crashes...
---
Ooo I like this. And there's nothing wrong with making higher tier enemies more rare if they're going to drop better items either. 
---
we got to go back to the past marty to get your mother impregnated by a kowalla
---
Oh....so the 50 shields and mini's are not shields....interesting. 
---
This should be pinned to the top. This is a great idea. 
---
Also, it shouldn't be labeled. Each week the community has to nuke different locations to find it.
---
No, trying to whistle like an actual train haha
---
is the elevator still working on that one? know the other is bugged
---
I'm on xbox but I already have an explosive laser pistol so I know what they are like, thanks for offering though!
---
pretty sure all events scale with number of participants. i've noticed it much more during uranium fever. solo you get like 2 spawns per wave. with 5+ people there you get 3-5 spawns
---
The guide is wrong, it might have been like that at some point, but currently it‚Äôs false.
---
True but generally speaking. Also Ark has been around for a long time and isn't really comparable to most multiplayer indie games due to its popularity i'd say. But I haven't played Ark so I'm no expert by any means.
---
If you were on a server with me I‚Äôd come looking for you.  I hunt bounties when I get a chance, unless it‚Äôs a huge bounty and they have unwanted friends near by.  Those are traps. 
---
If I end up wanted cause my TSE damages a structure I just hang out in whitesprings and ask people to kill me.
---
Yep in my tenpenny time machine where I watched it all unfold
---
The quest is giving the wrong items. That's the whole story. I've never seen it, and never read about anyone finding it.
---
Just curious, which one? Dirt track?
---
It has been much better for me, though if I fast travel to often and quickly I have been dropped or get the infinite hang.   
---
If I wait like a minute between I have gone 8 hours straight on the same server.    
---
Oh of other note if you take more than 4 workshops you will end up disconnecting at some point, especially if they are spread out. It is like the game keeps your stuff registered to you at all times so it puts extra strain as it is constantly doing checks and if you have a bunch of crap running well you get the idea.   
---
TL;DR 8 hours no workshops, will disconnect at 5 or more workshops. 
---
That totally sucks dude as it is an awesome game, maybe wait for the next patch and see if it improves .. I have two xboxes and I tried to play RDR1, it work perfectly on one and crashed on the 2nd. I know it was a buggy game, I mean the Dead DLC or whatever it was called, refused to work on my main xbox .. 
---
I remember getting it because I loved Dark Alliance and wanted a similar experience. I beat it within a weekend. Played it one more time to see how different it could be with the wanderer from FO1 being unlocked, but was still disappointed with the game. I ended up trading it in.
---
Make your stealth build and manage you inventory when going into combat. 
---
When you are farming, use unyielding pieces or the excavator power armor to increase your carry weight.
---
There would be nothing wrong with making the higher star enemies more rare though. If they're going to drop good stuff then it would make sense they are more difficult to come by. 
---
where are you coming across these radium rifles?
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  That's where people are trading end game items like Power Armor Mods.
---
I have the mods for jetpacks on T45, T51, T60.  I have calibrated shocks for T51, T60, and Ultracite (still looking for T45).  I just recently traded for Ultracite HUD.
---
With that being said, I haven't seen Plans for T51 Stealth Boy up for trade.  Something tells me the loot tables aren't all filled in.  Like I don't see Excavator, Raider, X01, or Ultracite Jet Pack plans up for trade ever.
---
I play on PS4, there was an event timer.  Have not looked for it recently though.
---
Do a Flatwoods lap, there are regular spawns of garden gnomes and a few cement bags in and around the greenhouses at Vault-tec Agricultural Research.
---
Afterwards, do a quick hop to the nearby bridge (the huge one nearby). On the very top level there is a spawn of up to 4 or 5 cement bags behind the overturned nuclear waste truck, this is around the middle of the bridge (don't miss the bags in the bag of the pickup as well).
---
Sorry if you already know this, hopefully someone finds this helpful! Cement was a bitch for me until I started doing this, now I always have plenty in conjunction with spending a few caps on bulk whenever I see it.
---
Max caps + all vendor plans bought. The ones in the whitespring alone will take like 20,000 caps off you.
---
It‚Äôs a random in counter 
---
Generally my game either disconnected from server or crashed me back to the Xbox home 2-3 times per hour of gameplay 
---
Twins Of Wild Nude Senders? 
---
Slightly related players who die of radiation sickness should have their character appear in the world as a feral ghoul 
---
Many thanks for the information! Will definitely be giving this a try later today!
---
Wow
---
not yet..next patch probably...
---
Make it grief protected, each person being able to build on their site(No one else), (Squares around the place where to build) and middle area would be visually upgradeable by caps. And we are good to go. Also let's be honest, two players and T.O.W.N. would be a history. Without good protection. 
---
Random encounter usually in the forest. And yes, it's a Zetan.
---
LOL, mostly event rewards or the occasional boss super mutant or scorched.
---
Worst its ever been for me. I'm on ps4. Sign in screen 3 load screen's pip boy bugging out a lot if I use it on log in.. Fast travel black screen. Lots of lag spikes to the point my character has been rubber banding after loading into a new area. I've watch a lot of scored rubber band lately to.. Were they seemingly teleport around...
---
I'm getting tons of disconnects lately to the point that its almost not even playable now.
---
I haven't seen one.
---
There is a mutation that does radiation damage to enemies around you.  It's Unstable Isotope Mutation.
---
I was thinking about posting the bounty here on reddit "Bounty for today : 30 Black Titanium. 1 ultracite Fusion Core. Survive the killer clown".
---
Maybe instead of just surprising people with it, make it like an open invitation. 
---
Sub
---
Did you find the 51 jetpack at the watoga bos vendor? I've been looking forever for the stealthboy or jetpack there, nearly 300 relogs
---
I found him in the mire.

These are all good tips. Much more so in FO76 vs. previous games, you have to be realistic about your playstyle, and what you're actually going to use. It feels weird to just throw out a bunch of ammo, but if it helps you do it, realize that there are a couple of perks later on - Ammosmith in Agility, Super Duper in Luck - that make it really, really abundant and easy to replace if you do change how you play. 
---
re: Junk and bulking, I usually bulk everything I can, and sell anything with more than five bulk. Also remember that there are a couple of junk items that don't bulk -  antiseptic, asbestos, ballistic fiber, black titanium, circuitry,  crystal, fiber optics, fiberglass, flux, gold, nuclear material, screws,  silver and ultracite. For that loose junk, and the other junk, I like to keep at least 50 surplus, but you run into some of the more common stuff (cloth, steel, glass) literally almost everywhere.

You can get 1,400 caps a day from vendors. Here is the cheat sheet loop I made based on other threads on the sub:  CAMP &gt;&gt;&gt; Harper's Ferry &gt;&gt;&gt; Watoga Station  &gt;&gt;&gt; Watoga Shopping Plaza &gt;&gt;&gt; Whitesprings Train Station &gt;&gt;&gt; Whitesprings Bunker &gt;&gt;&gt; Flatwoods &gt;&gt;&gt; Sutton  &gt;&gt;&gt; Camp.

I've seen a Wendigo chilling in a tree with a Spider-Man style stance. I shot him down, shot out his knee caps, then blew his head off.
---
I spent hours mapping out locations in the Woodland area for firecaps so I can make disease cures (Forest) by the gross because of damn molerats.
---
PS: there aren't many, a couple near Anchor Farm, some by the scenic overlook not far from the Vault. There is 1-2 near the ruined post-war settlement by the nuka-cola billboard off hwy 88 between the pig and the hill on the map.
---
 I've noticed that the drops seem to be worse in the last 20 levels or so (I'm level 87) than they were in my 30-50 range. Maybe I'm crazy though. 
---
Good idea, I quit picking up guns a while ago due to weight issues with the rest of my gear.  I do have scrapper though so I'll have to start scrapping guns again.  Thanks for the idea!
---
I am level 198, have about 450 in stash and 260 in inventory. While I would like their to be a few more skill points, I've learned to manage my stash, turn everything into bulk, and you don't honestly need as much stuff as you think
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.  People buy, sell, and sometimes give away mutation serums there.
---
its random..ive seen him in the forest a few times..but once i take a shot he disappears in thin air
---
Four ALTs? Chill with the kleptomania.
---
I was taking about the downvotes, although it's not as bad right now as it was earlier.
---
I was just trying to make a fun reference to New Vegas, that's all. Now that I've gone and explained it, the joke is going to be even better, so hooray for that.
---
I found it had more to do with individual items than how much of each item. For a while there it was well advised and tested tht getting rid of your notes and junk holos increased your personal stability.  As I am in the habit now of either not taking notes as I read them or dropping them right away I have no evidence if this still works other than I can play for 8 straight hours on the same server. 
---
Try going to Vault 76 then heading dus south towards Gillman Lumbermill.  He occasionally will spawn on the rocks on the way down from 76, I've seen him twice there.
---
The game needs to allow you build closer to other peoples camps. 
---
If griefing is a concern, make it so that only friends are party members can place camps that close. 
---
Me and a friend have stopped playing for a bit because of school. However, we would probably still log on from time to time if the building in this game was more flushed out.
---
Oh I mean I think it works good for now. It‚Äôs way better than before so I‚Äôm giving them props for that. But you‚Äôre right, it takes too much time to fix instead, but they prob have 2 teams or more. I highly doubt that they have only one team working on the game on either bug fixing or qol,  content and not all..

It is not currently an available effect and I don't think it will be one. 
---
this thread has a couple links to some data-mined effects for the 4 and 5 star slots if you want to take a look. 
---
Looks like an irradiated effect will come but it will be in the form of irradiating an enemy upon blocking their attack I think? which is a melee weapon only feature. 
---
I am planning to get that mutation after get a gamma or radium rifle. Currenly trying to make a radiation build.
---
Yuuup. That's what I'm almost done with now. There are a lot of furniture pieces that only rarely spawn at certain merchants and they're a few hundred each. Grape Mentats are MVP.
---
I mean its a rifle though right? It should have like 30 mods on shouldn't it? I got a great 3 star radium drop from the mole miners and want to use it but its only got the base mods on it. I feel like im taking crazy pills since I can't get 1 single mod for it from breaking down other rifles.
---
Okay what‚Äôs your gamer tag ? 
---
Would you mind elaborating as to why you are downvoting? I am not in this for internet points. I want Bethesda to know how I feel about the current state of the game.
---
I really enjoy playing fo76, but the mandatory pvp has soured the game for me, and as more people hit end game the griefing has just been getting worse.
---
If you have something to add to help improve the game, then feel free to do so, and if I haven't been clear enough on my view I would be happy to elaborate.
---
I use a custom .ini file that gets rid of some of the more annoying visual things (e.g. gaussian blur), but definitely not any settings like those shown. If you have good luck with those, be sure to let us know. I'm content with (mostly) smooth fps in this particular Fallout at the moment.
---
Well. 
---
Normal Ps4 player here. I like the game but I think you can make it better, . 
---
1- The game should have a book or something that tells you what you need to craft "x" item without making you loose caps for travelling or replacing your camp (example: excavator power armor mission at ash heap is kinda lame for that reason). 
---
2- The volume of the missions should be adjusted, sometimes it sounds low and another times a robot or something gets in the way making it harder to listen.
---
3- Lightning bugs are sooo annoying, specially in "The mire" and "The forest".
---
4- Server disconnects lol.
---
5- Some locations have way too much enemies, specially if you are playing solo.
---
6- player cap should be increased.
---
7- Improve the framerate.
---
8- Move the sword mission from the order of mysteries to another location.
---
9- Atomic shop prizes haha
---
Nice. I'm going to try tackling the scorch queen for the first time Wednesday or Thursday, so maybe we can make that happen, haha. 
---
Cool that someone made a bot based on not reading the article at all.
---
No mention of amazon?

My entire friends list in the social menu is gone. None of my friends are showing up at all. Asking them, I still appear just fine on their list. The "recent" tab also works fine, all my friends are just not showing.
---
I updated drivers, restarted the game and my PC, and verified the game files integrity, and it still doesn't work. 
---
If anyone have experienced this and know of a fix, please leave a comment. Even if you don't have a fix, it would nice to know I'm not alone in this. 
---
what happens to the hundreds of ideas we submitted? nothing. lol
---
Thanks for the info!
---
i legit never seen one..only the plans at vendors
---
So disappointing that after hundreds of hours and with a half dozen friends pushing hundreds of hours none of us have seen this spontaneous RP that so many in this small subsection of the player base have experienced.
---
I‚Äôm jealous.
---
Maybe it doesn't have a scope. That weird chicken wire shit gets in the way. I know I saw a radium mod in Watoga. But be careful some mods are just basic mods. Like auto grenade launcher has no mods yet you can buy one? I guess when they come out with new mods
---
It‚Äôs happened to me a lot. The SB continues to fly w/on issue
---
I just suck it up and carry a Gauss Rifle and 100-200 rounds.  Make sure it has a good legendary modifier or two, and the armor penetration mod (mod, like you add it at the weapons workbench).  Gauss rifles have one of the highest single shot damage ranged shots in the game.  Higher damage hurts high defense creatures more.
---
I have zero rifle perks on my melee character and it still does decent damage to scorch beasts.  I'd hate to see what it did with a full rifleman build.....lol
---

Random encounter in flatwoods.. And ya he is a zetan.
---
Fsho, I work 9-5 central time but free most evenings. I carry a pretty nice 3* sledge and a TSE  handmade so we should make it. PM me through here to set up. We keep PNS muted cuz GTA.
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks installed will give you +200 carry weight, all other power armour with calibrated shocks installed will give you +100 carry weight.  Note, that's with shocks on Both legs.
---
I‚Äôll just be over here hammering this fan.
---
OK then, tell me who folded it to begin with?
---
shut up u fuckin cockmunch
---
You are so wide off the mark, it's not worth trying to talk to you about this. However one thing stood out. 
---
&gt; People are not enjoying it.
---
Some people aren't enjoying it. But clearly, there are people enjoying it, and this reddit shows that. That one statement of yours, shows how closed minded you are.
---
You literally seem to be the type that are blind to anyone actually liking the game, inspite of its problems.
---
So yes, the idea that you don't understand the game seems very accurate to apply to you. You only want to see what you find acceptable. Seems like that's your approach to playing games. must follow a design you know and find acceptable for it to be good. 
---
Later.
---
It was folded when I got there I just watched it unfold
---
Sadly, just wait for new content.
---
I‚Äôve done pretty much everything, explored all I could, have the optimal items for my build and what I only do is just log in for a couple mins, sell stuff at vendors and log off.
---
Kinda sad, as the game is awesome but still lacks some stuff to do, without making it repetitive or a routine.
---
If you got in on LoneVaultWanders page and go through his comment on posts he already replied on this. 
---
They need to be confident duping is gone and get server stability back before they do the next increase.
---
TOWNS : together our world needs support 
---
It should allow you to mod the torso. I think it adds two strength. 
---
Yesterday i saw an X1 that was white and blue it had flames on it.   these people are not talking about where they got it....   but its out there somewhere.
---
I say it every time I am doing the event, it really needs to be a song in the game. MISSED OPPORTUNITY BETHESDA!
---
Hmm I think I will  incorporate that into the new Rambo character. I have been trying to be more realistic about with him already about sleep, making myself sleep once per day cycle unless I take chems.

Here's the vendor map I use:  [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/220026434226225153/513631437962870784/Vendorsfixed.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/220026434226225153/513631437962870784/Vendorsfixed.jpg)
---
To tell you the truth, since I started trading on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits, I've almost completely stopped visiting the vendors.  They never have anything I want....lol
---
There is a perk in intelligence regarding nodding power armor. That will most likely be the problem
---
You can contact support and ask for a refund if you're not happy with the purchase. 
---
I'm lvl 198 right now, I have maybe 450 in stash and 280 in inventory, the perk card system is in place to have you make choices on your build, I dont use the camp system extensively because that way I can move it wherever i want and drop a stash box, recently i found myself with 700 steel scrap! That's more then excessive, 5 bulk scrap of the rare resources and 10 of steel and wood will get you by for weeks, use power patcher and the weapon/armor durability perk cards, can fill your inventory up on any junk you need in 1 hour of scavenging good sites. 
---
Don‚Äôt take any wooden nickels.
---
He was a neat thing the one time I saw... Dann moth man scared the scrap right outta me though.. Small black lump with red eyes lol.. I thought it was a bush ..
---
Yes there's a perk that you need to do the mods I have the plan and the perk and it works.
---
I am specced Rifleman at the moment, but I do have most of the automatic rifle perks so I should be able to  switch to those without that much of an issue.  I'll give that a look
---
The stash problem is such a joke, one item takes up 20 out of your 600, so its not a case of trying to manage too many items, its limited to keep you poor and wanting to buy their ATOM
---
Thanks. I will check out.
---
I had a similar experience that I couldn't wrap my head around:
---
I saw a level 50ish player (I'm 130 atm) with a bounty in Watoga. I traveled to her (at least thr character model was a her) and popped her on the head, killing her instantly.
---
She didn't have much in the way of junk and I'm not much for taking people's things, anyway. I mostly figure I'm doing a service by removing the wanted level.
---
Anyway, I told my friend I felt bad but he said to grab her junk for him, so I did, but I left a few treasure maps in her junk bag, figuring it would be a nice surprise, especially if she hadn't found any yet, and the yield for each map would be considerably larger than the amount of junk I took.
---
That's where it got weird. She didn't come back for her stuff! I chased her down outside and explained that she should go grab her stuff. She just kept walking away, and she was slow walking... Like, no caps lock walking. I didn't reveal right away that I put maps in her bag because I wanted it to be a surprise. I asked her to follow me but on she went at a snail's pace, stopping only to flash me the question mark emote.
---
At this point I just explained about the maps, but she would not follow! Finally I just put a map on the ground in a bag and she took it. Then she went through her inventory and dropped a stimpack for me.
---
I mean, that was a really cute gesture, but I could not understand the seeming lack of understanding of the situation.
---
I spent another few minutes just trying to get any reaction out of her but after getting the slow walk stonewall I gave up.
---
I get it, it could have sounded like a trap, but at that point your wanted level was gone so you would only have to take slap damage. Plus, who doesn't go back for their stuff? 
---
I haven‚Äôt found any fall-damage reducing armour yet; going to grab Goat Legs next. 
---
Rip and tear, until it is done.
---
I have Rank 1 right now, I think... I'll prioritize getting to rank 3
---
I would like to think because of the irradiated nature of the Fallout universe, we're contacting different strains of the same diseases. These strains being different in rapid sequence because of the radiation.
---
If the wording is correct on the inside the vault releases, if you get the message and no email it is perm ban they won't consider lifting.  If you got the email and you apologize and say you will never do it again it should be lifted (no clear on time table because no one has gotten a reply back yet).
---
Radaway can suppress the mutations while you are under its effects. is this what you are experiencing? Check under Status, effects. It should tell you that, I think. 
---
From my understanding it scales based on the level of the person who set off the nuke
---
&gt; but nobody sells them 
---
Because most just drop them on spot or don‚Äôt even loot them to begin with 
---
My wife and I play together.  We're both around level 14 or so.  We've had a few encounters with higher level players and we generally do keep a close eye on them while they are around us.  While we've only had one person actually griefing us, that has placed a very bitter taste in our mouths for dealing with other players.  While we may not run away just because a higher level player is in the area, we are very watchful of them.
---
That said, if a higher level player stepped in and started dropping bags near us and indicating we take them, we would welcome the assistance they offered.  Even if we were nearly over-encumbered, its not really that hard to find a nearby stash.
---
The biggest difference for me is X-01 vs. Excavator. The +100 carry weight in the Excavator makes a big difference while hunting for gear/junk/etc. The X-01 is a beast for fighting. 
---
Once I find the Calibrated Shock mod for the X-01 (+50 carry weight) I may drop the Excavator suit.
---
I carry both in my inventory -- which is only 10 weight while wearing the other.
---
I have been trying to avoid Heavy Weapons (don't have any of the perks) but maybe it's a route I need to try.
---
I've encountered *it* a few times in the Mire. 
---
I never said people were not enjoying it
---
I agree the stash needs to be increased but 4 alts holding stuff sounds like your just holding on to way to much stuff. Also why not just keep one alt with everything on it and just keep him at his camp or wherever is convenient for you and just have him over encumbered ? Obviously not the point of your post but I'm just wondering why not do this instead of spreading all your stuff over so many alts 
---
The longer I stay on a server normally the small the player count myself otherwise I notice full servers often. 
---
I thought it was scaled based on the level of the person who sets off the nuke. 
---
Well, I think they've said that's coming in the last In the Vault.
---
Not sure on the lower PAs but sometimes I switch to Excavator for more carry weight and extra mining ores.
---
Sweet!
---
Energy weapons are so broken in this game..
---
people may start out with the same goals but their paths diverge as they get out into the world and deal with the aftermath of the crap that drove us underground to begin with.  Look "ahead" to the content you see in the future (the other FO games)...all those different rival factions in the world are the result of the different paths we are taking in the "present."   I truly hope Bethesda gives us the tools to better organize communities such as persistent towns, communities, trade, etc.  
---
I'm not referring to that. I mean the guys with weapon reduction perks and carry 30 different guns at all times. 
---
Wait Rad-X suppresses your mutation?  Maybe that explains why I feel like my Marsupial/Speed Demon stops working sometimes.
---
&gt; Nope. Nothing wrong with giving away free stuff. But when that free stuff is a shitty in-game currency that costs them literally nothing, it's a rather shitty compensation for replacing a cool-looking and (presumably) durable canvas bag with a shitty nylon bag and hoping no one would notice/make a fuss.
---
What? People made a fuss, they're making it right. Still ends up being a negative talking point against them?
---
Everyone loves to mention the bag issue, no one ever mentions the people who bought it are going to end up with two bags and got free in-game credits.
---
Which is part of my point, and speaks a lot about more about outrage culture in general.
---
People direct you as to what to be mad at, they make money off your participation with their content, and then they move on to the next thing they tell you to be mad at, without ever coming back and wrapping up the last thing.
---
So what this does it leaves a lot of people angry, and only partially informed. *Everyone* knows that they ripped people off with the bag yeah?
---
How many equally know that these people are getting their bag, keeping the original bag, and got $5 in-game currency compensation as well?
---
They wouldn't tell you that, as keeping you in a cycle of outrage and then giving you videos that talk about the same thing to validate your outrage is how they make money. Squashing that outrage when it's no longer warranted makes them no profit.
---
&gt;In-game names? Try again. People had their names, addresses and some banking details revealed. And what was Bethesda's response? "Hi guys, we've resolved this issue."
---
The Kotaku (you actually used Kotaku as a source LOL) article you link to doesn't verify anything, it uses the reddit post it's reporting on as it's source, which is unverified.
---
The verified part of it, by Bethesda, was that only usernames were revealed.
---
[Here's the only "proof" they give, which as you can see, proves nothing](https://twitter.com/JesscaTracy9/status/1070408681320177664/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1070408681320177664&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fajax%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1070408681320177664%26autosize%3D1) more than he was able to see usernames.
---
This making stuff up to try to create negative talking points against them, the vitriol, the exaggeration - this is my point.
---
People are enthralled with this game, even if they're enthralled with nothing more than a cyclic style of outrage, content creators making videos about the outrage, and then the original outraged people having their opinions validated by what is basically their own opinions being sourced and fed back to them.
---
What they're relying on is the same thing you relied on above - that people will see the blue text link and think "Oh, that's proof then" without ever checking the source.
---
As is usual with gaming publications (especially ones that publish articles with less than 300 freaking words!) the source doesn't actually pan out, it doesn't actually prove what they're talking about.
---
(As a part time writer and reviewer myself on occasion, I tend to get mad when major publications publish extremely sub-par articles like that, because they do it so they themselves and others can link to an article as a source, exactly as you have now, and that's DIRECTLY how they earn money via outrage culture like this right here.) 
---
&gt;Oh wow, great point! FO76 isn't the first game to deal with duping. Except I never claimed it was. It was just something else that added fuel to the dumpster fire and kept the memes alive.
---
The point being that these aren't people out here calling out glitches, or on some crusade to make programmers bug check better - they're just using any excuse, any glitch - no matter how common - to *create* a fiasco for this particular game.
---
So that people like you then link their articles/videos around generating them ad revenue because you're trying to prove to people who don't agree with you that they should also be outraged.
---
&gt;In a vacuum, "any normal glitch" or "the existence of a dev room" wouldn't be much of a story. But with the heaping mountain of shit surrounding FO76, those things get amplified because it's become a running joke that "every time you think Fallout 76 has hit rock bottom, they prove you wrong".
---
More like "Something else that was less than perfect happened with this one particular video game: Public - BE OUTRAGED!"
---
&gt;I don't deny that people want to keep talking about it, much like they want to keep talking about celebrities that go off the deep end and fall from grace. People eat that shit up, and it's easy clicks for media outlets.
---
Bit of a difference between, say, Chris Brown being accused of rape - something people should be mad over - and people using hacks to force their way into a dev room.
---
One of those things you should be upset about - Chris Brown, nor anyone, should be out here raping people.
---
The other, the existence of a dev room in a video game, is quite common (especially to Bethesda) and the only thing to be mad about there is that people decided to hack a game.
---
&gt;But if you honestly think that's the entire reason people keep talking about the game, and that Bethesda hasn't brought a lot of this negativity on themselves, you're deluding yourself.
---
Bethesda had some glitches in the game at launch... just like all of their titles. We could argue all day how many glitches are acceptable in a game of such complexity for the rest of time.
---
If you think that Fallout 76 isn't getting shit on extra hard, just ask yourself: Where's the outrage over every other game that released with tons of glitches or other issues?
---
Not hearing too much about those, because there's not a lot of money in reporting that Atlas is broken for the next 5 months. There's not a lot of money in pissing off Sony customers by constantly reporting that Spiderman has massive animation issues ala Mass Effect Andromeda. There's no money to be made in making a big issue about RDR2O having a massively greedy payment model.
---
Why? Because none of those games happened to get an explosive reddit post with 10's of thousands of upvotes about their problems, so there's no trigger for these companies to start making articles that reinforce those opinions by reporting on the already known issue the people who are outraged by it.
---
It's a really simple system:
---
1) Big reddit post about *something* happens. As we've seen, this doesn't even necessarily have to be a true or real thing, like the "no data encryption" hoax.
---
2) Take those people's talking points from the post that alerted them to the outrage in the first place, then use that reddit article as a source to "verify" their claims.
---
3) Post that article to the community where the outrage started, creating a self-verification loop. Basically, they're not "lying" because they're just reporting on what redditors are saying. People on the internet then share that article as proof of what they're saying is true.
---
End result of that system? People basically use other people's opinions on the internet as a source to create what appears to be a fact-based claim with verifiable sources, but as we explored above, that verification is often the source of the outrage in the first place, and the original claim is more often than not unverifiable.
---
Oh, and the person who makes the article to feed it back to the people they're sourcing make bunches of money off of the ad revenue.
---
4) If the topic's still hot, make a big fiasco out of every little thing related to it, and then use the past things (real or not,) to create a "mountain of issues" that further verify any more claimed issues.
---
You see the issue with this system I hope, I've explained them well enough I hope.
---
Now, if this were to keep happening with something where the issues that keep getting reported on are real, unique, and worthy of causing outrage, then it wouldn't be an issue. Think "Chris Brown accused of rape" levels of correct outrage, not "OMG somebody hacked into a dev room using Third Party tools, fuck Bethesda!" levels of bogus outrage.
---
But as it stands, you and a lot of people are willing participants in a revenue generating cycle of the laziest type of reporting possible.
---
Basically: Don't believe everything you see on the internet without verifying it first.
---
It would be cool to turn in a ghoul for rad exposure. Granted there is also a cure for those that want to avoid it. 
---
It would also be cool if there was good and evil scale. Where a players actions determine their morality. 
---
This could unlock certain vendors for people that are evil or good.
---
Daily missions involving PvP and trapping for those that are evil. 
---
Daily missions for good players that involve helping others and killing highly wanted people.
---
Killing people in pvp will grant you a token for purchasing items or increasing evil morality. 
---
Item for each side could include power armor paints, outfits, camp items, and emotes depicting your status. 
---
So much potential and it would add another element to the game.
---
At least it some what easy well kinda the Prison Yard is annoying and if the enemies are Super Mutants on the Inside (Prison yard is always populated by Super Mutants) then it can be troubling as at least at my lv (32) will probably spawn a Super Mutant...eh Brawler I think, name of the mob isn't important its the Missile Launcher he's packing.  
---
Now that just seems intentionally confusing! 
---
I am as confused as you are
---
Though if the Gatling Gun was truly 500-
---
Those cranking skills must be godly
---
50 cal is tempting as it would fit with my spec (semi-auto rifle, but I have the perks to switch to auto)  I'd would take me quite a long time to the perks for heavy weapons, but if that's where I need to go, it's where I need to go :)
---
That's funny. I can totally see that happening. The mod I'm talking about actually gives you an in game map with the locations so you don't have to have another window or your phone open. 
---
These two things are the least ‚Äúbitchy‚Äù requests that I see. As someone who usually only carries one set of power armor on me, I totally support this ask. 
---
You could try the Vaccinated perk. There's a perk for everything. This one is probably overlooked by most.
---
If you don't have any luck, let me know.  I can craft you a combat rifle (automatic or semi-auto, your choice), a submachine gun (uses .45), a 10mm pistol (auto or semi, your choice) ,or a 10mm smg.  
---
I know the game has problems, but it's nothing worth losing your head over.
---
Those are the two most wanted things in this game after stability. Why they weren‚Äôt there prior to release is beyond me. 
---
There‚Äôs quite a few fallout playlists on Spotify. Radio Wasteland is my favorite, made by one the folks hereabouts.
---
Doesn‚Äôt have radio spots by DJs or anything but hey neither does 76...
---
Just updated my post with a link to the perks list it'll be in the intelligence branch.
---
Really now??? I've been out of the loop sorry that's so cool!
---
ha ha ha. I don't pay much attention to down votes, so thanks for explaining that. 
---
Don‚Äôt keep so much crap
---
Damage is king, everything else is just holding you back.
---
fast traveled to my camp earlier and Flatwoods monster was standing in my front yard.
---
Well yeah. I definitely think the lock picking and hacker perks are pretty stupid to be switching around constantly but thinking you should always be able to have every perk possible equipped nonstop isn't what the game is about.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how you can be a fan of Fallout 1 and/or 2 and be happy with the state of Fallout currently. I played and completed Fallout 1, but Fallout 2 is where I have hundreds of hours and multiple playthroughs. It‚Äôs a true work of art: full of grit, foul language, sarcasm, horror, challenge, mystery, and an interesting (ie. Not 100% linear and transparent) leveling system. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt enjoy newer fallouts, I just can‚Äôt relate to your experience. The franchise is a hardly even a shadow of what it could be, as opposed to the good job I think they‚Äôve done with TES. 
---
Fallout is supposed to be dark, gloomy, a fear ridden and desperate journey for answers. The mere sight of aliens/chupacabras, or rocket launcher wielding super mutants used to send me into a panic of backing up my progression with multiple save files. Now it‚Äôs just pop some Med-X and hold the trigger button down. Sad. 
---
If you have Spotify, they have a lot of good, seemingly endless playlists from all the Fallout games!
---
There's also the Vaccinated perk
---
I currently doing a power armor/rifleman build... I'll have to give that a look.
---
The vault logs made it clear some people were not happy and also that people were picked for their intelligence and ability and not their loyalty to the vault program
---
Every time I see one of these threads, I have to think for a second and say "oh wait, consoles don't have this yet". God, this is 100% a requirement for the game, just thinking about needing to switch out lockpick, hacking, and crafting perks individually every time i visit a dungeon or workbench hurts me inside
---
Fantastic, thanks for the reply, I'll look into the perk.
---
Cheers mate, I'll look this up.
---
So you can have two bored people? 
---
I also brought the Power Armor Edition and the game was great while it lasted. No complaints even after the issues at pre-launch/post-launch (e.g: Never got to play the Beta b/c of game self delete) but the lack of new content was what ended my gameplay. 
---
Only thing left for me is to farm end game gears, and I cannot even do that with storage problems and caps limits.
---
Rad-X suppresses mutations, Rad-X diluted does not
---
The radium rifle is much harder to unlock mods for than most guns, although 8 scraps for no mods is still extremely unlucky.
---
Still, I wouldn't bother trying to unlock the mods for it. It's a monstrous drain on screws and the gun is quite bad.
---
Cool!
---
The time is based on how many times you've contracted it. If you keep getting hit and diseased with the same disease, it can be more than 2 hours.
---
A workshop is not the same as your CAMP.  Defending it is part of the gameplay, people should not receive additional punishment for attacking a workshop.  If you don't want to defend it, don't claim it.
---
PvP was a stupid idea to begin with......then Bethesda left the duping glitch in game for 3 months.
---
I don't plan a build that doesn't include Thru-Hiker, Pack Rat and Traveling Pharmacy.  I don't really see it as bad though.  It lets you carry a ludicrous amount of stuff.  I do agree lock picking and hacking are annoying.  They should just be made passive perks you get as you level, getting 3 in each at 50, or give some other bonus that encourages a player to keep them active at all times.
---
As others have pointed out, the damage perk cards are a trap, only put one point in each for whatever weapon type you are using.  General rule of thumb is to try and get at least 10%-ish damage out any perk point you are spending for damage.  Bloody Mess still qualifies because it is multiplicative with other damage and not a flat increase.
---
That's not even a valid argument because nothing in the Atomic Shop can increase your stash. If you are going to argue against the stash limit, st least have a valid reason. Nothing in the Atomic Store positively impacts your game play, aside from an aesthetic standpoint. That's what items being "cosmetic" means.
---
Ok... So how would any atom items help alleviate that? I don't follow the logic
---
Perks like that should be on when you need them tbh
---
Like Ammosmith, I only put that on when I‚Äôm going to craft ammo
---
Yeah, Rad-X suppresses it.  If you use the diluted version though, it doesn't have an effect on mutations.
---
To be honest i thrown away tones of assasins armor, maybe even with sentinel as second effect, becouse i thought i would be useless. And now imagine how much unnoticed explosive or another great rollz was scraped, becouse we dont have auction house to know, what is really worth.
---
What a novel concept..... its like Runescape, Everquest, WOW, and literally any online game never existed. 
---
I imagine these are pretty universal wants.
---
Fingers crossed for later this month...
---
i dunno about you but i have rank one power patcher and after two or three SB run ins my legs are usually down to half condition. 
---
Because Jerry ate my pudding half a year ago and I tend to hold a grudge after seeing his face for 25 years every day 
---
I will drop da bomb on him 
---
That is ridiculous. They literally glow..
---
All Night Long only works at night now, which makes it mostly useless as far as my usage goes.  Slow Metabolizer is handy, especially when you stack it with Good Doggy (which only has 1 rank).
---
Might have been me lol. Was it ps4?
---
I want that green paint so bad anyone know if its comeing out of the atomic shop
---
I thought Charleston was an act of revenge?
---
I think those higher level ones are level gated. You can't run all 3 1* cards at level 20, but you can run 3* of the first one.
---
Chop, chop, chop that meat. 
---
How do you transfer items to an alt?
---
it would be assumed that if they changed the mechanic they would also fix the bug with it
---
OK that was my problem, my dump ass had forgotten that it is a torso mod I was looking at the legs, looked at the torso on the modify menu and there it was. Thanks very much :)
---
Say that to my legendary rolling pin.  I bake cookies 50% faster with it equipped
---
It definitely does. I learned the hard way when I threw a bunch of flux in there and it degraded before I could use it.

I remember attacking a guys base and it turned into this whole ordeal. I don‚Äôt even remember why I destroyed his base either. He tried to stop me and died several times trying.

Yeah, it would be cool if players couldn't 2 shot the damn queen...
---
They also have the marine armor kinda
---
They are working to stabilise the servers before they increase it - that's my bet. Problem is we have players with hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads (I'm not even joking - there's posts of people trading with dupers and screenshots) slowly walking around our servers. That's going to decrease server performance and prevent us getting an increase for now.
---
This is about the time people chime in and say "*That's not how it works and not stores that way server-side*". And I say "*Uh huh. Because you know how Bethesda stored everything server-side. Yep.*"
---
Oh and btw everything gets downvoted when posted. Don't take it personally. Some people hate that you're enjoying this game and this sub.
---
I picked up a 2 shot flamer but quickly put it away due to fuel costs and I have loads of materials. Definitely need an ammo buff.
---
If you are freezing in power armor only its the HUD mod on the Helm.
---
I don't think so.
---
I've been buying modded radium's from my dealer and I don't get anything when I scrap them but when I craft level 40 turds and break them down I get a mod.
---
It's true, I'm the begger
---
This. I too struggled with only 3 in strength until I discovered radicool &amp; marsupial.  Radicool &amp; Adrenal mutation with a glass sniper build works awesome
---
My stealth rifle build mostly uses carry weight mods for this problem. The newer patch makes armor much easier to repair, and you shouldn't need to do it too much if you're actually stealth sniping (considering you shouldn't be getting hit often), so the reduced durability from pocketed and deep pocketed are not really a problem. Combine that with White Knight and my armor so dirt cheap to repair.
---
I have speed demon and just don't use thru hiker (or all night long for that matter). Just make sure you have class freak on and the hunger stuff isn't so bad. I usually roll around with 3 guns, their ammo, and a melee, plus my PA, and usually have 40ish pounds to spare when leaving my camp.
---
That being said, remember that this is a stealth sniper build. It's only natural that you're going to have more weight management issues than strength builds; that's to be expected and by design. _That_ being said, I think they should do something about the weight of some items like they did with Bobby pins. 
---
I understand that some shame may be involved, and for that I apologize. However, I think it is important to recognize gramattical errors publicly since language is a shared experience. Errors are propagated this way. We all make mistakes. I'd encourage readers to consider the diction and not suppose anything about the author.
---
Good tip. These days though, I am rarely low enough on Rad meds though for this to even be a problem. 
---
I've got bear arms and ordnance express so missiles are actually viable. Still I tend to just use them as I find them rather than carrying a stockpile around.
---
I was playing my lower level character over the weekend. Since I spent most of my time questing, I noticed I was not getting legendary spawns that often. I have been so used to cherry picking things with legendary spawns on my main character, I forgot just how infrequent they are in the general world compared to seeking them out. 
---
After I realized that, it made me think how bad 95% of the drops actually are and how unlikely you are to get something that's actually usable without farming. I would much prefer fewer, better quality items. It would also be nice if some of the affixes were a bit better.
---
nope
---
\*lurking intensifies\*
---
In general, I find the carrying weight in this game turns the entire experience into more of a chore than it should be. I'm constantly having to travel to my camp to dump things or craft because of how low the weight limit is. It's a total chore and it makes even the simplest of tasks turn into an inventory management nightmare. 
---
&gt; power armor stands and store my PA for people to see
---
I Want this so bad.  :( 
---
I keep level 2 on since I draw a lot of aggro in group events. The way my perks are allocated, it doesn't take away from any perks I need.
---
:'( the only reason is bethesda maybe want relase slowly all the rare plans, im doing the events try hunting plans never comes :( it may be intentionally, like old football trading cards collection.
---
ah i see. i tend to stay on long enough to go thru a couple day/night cycles so i switch when appropriate.
---
Much better for me on ps4.
---
I average a crash every 10 hours. Dcs are similar
---
Yaaay! Throw an invite my way. I'm only a level 20ish but I try really really hard. lol
---
Have you put Deep Pocketed in your armor mod slot? Cause I have all my items pocketed or deep pocketed, I'm a 14 str, 15 per, and 3 agi..... it gives me enough tho have the thru-hiker perk in agi, 3 star rifle perks and enough str to allow me to carry 300lbs min. (depending on the armor loadouts) to 380lbs.
---
What are you using so much cement for?
---
Yeah I figured people who have played for a little while would compare X-01 vs Excavator. I personally maxed out strength for melee weapons so I don't have any problems with my carry weight. 
---
I typically only use my PA for a blast zone, or occasionally to use the jetpack to get to certain areas my marsupial mutation can't reach. 
---
You clearly want to keep talking about the game.
---
That's a level of success right there. You think it's worth talking about. Regardless of why you are talking about it. And in this case, it's because you believe one thing, so strongly, you need to try and tell others why they should think your way. or your offended that someone things differently than you.
---
Or any other of the many reasons you still need to talk about the game.
---
Me. I talk about it because I'm enjoying the game. I'm not the only one clearly. That's a measure of success. More and more I am encountering the world is full message when I try and join my friends in game. More and more seeing new players. Not people with alts. New players. 
---
If your response is, people will like garbage or one man's trash kind of statement.
---
That just says something about you.
---
I would expand and say tension, stress, and overcoming that stress is what makes video games fun.
---
PvP can be substituted with a PvE, if the E was challenging. But the reason PvP will always overcome PvE in terms of excitement is because PvE will have a script that can be discovered and exploited. The fight becomes predicable. Whereas a biological enemy with freewill may act randomly and do unexpected actions.
---
To change that, we need a deeper AI in video games.
---
You do know most distributors buy games on a credit-like system from the publisher right? In an age of mainly digital sales for both PC and Console, overestimating how many physical copies will sell for ANY game is a risky guess.
---
It's not uncommon for developers to recall physical copies from retailers if they didn't sell as many as expected.
---
That does nothing. Anyone grabbing anything off the overweight character can simply fast travel to them.
---
Agreed
---
Increasing limit is not enough. Big surprise.
---
Wait. That‚Äôs the opposite of what I was asking. When you craft items you‚Äôre getting mods? 
---
yes, it needs to be all around awesome... carry 1000 weight, ammo doesn't weigh, food and water restores to 100%, also gives health, and everyone should start with lockpicking+hacking at level 3. because how else am i going to get every single damage perk in the game? ridiculous that i have to \*CHOOSE\*... i should just have all of it, because this is only a game.
---
in all seriousness though, i wish they'd implement something like "5 passive slots" or something that lets you put in non-combat stuff at all times, like pack rat and whatever. that way you'd open up for a better build diversity while still maintaining choice.
---
They should also have more than...
---
4 Caps
---
Stimpack
---
As someone that wants to be a crafter in the game 1st and foremost, I want a ton more stash.
---
I never PVP and I‚Äôm in pacifist mode.  I got wanted because I got stuck in a players locked camp and they left.  So I had to pick the door lock to leave. 
---
A level 36 player came by and one-shot killed me and took all my junk too (for 10 caps wanted).  This kind of sucks both ways. 
---
How did they one-shot kill me?
---
I also tailer, soldier and spy
---
With carnivore just take cannibal 3 and eat everyone. No risk of diseases!
---
As far as I know the only fully broken items are the raider protective and casual protective. The handmade rifle is also bugged, but is obtainable through specific means. I'm hoping they fix this so we can finally have the right linings for multiple classes/character types.
---
If you are repeatedly kicked out of high schools for stealing all their plastic, you might be an Appalachian.
---
Reminds me of that motorcycle guy that we never get to see in FO4
---
Pls
---
&gt;What? People made a fuss, they're making it right. Still ends up being a negative talking point against them?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Everyone loves to mention the bag issue, no one ever mentions the people who bought it are going to end up with two bags and got free in-game credits.  
---
&gt;Which is part of my point, and speaks a lot about more about outrage culture in general.
---
More so, a lot of the people speaking up, never ordered the $200 edition. They are mad about something they weren't part of directly. I bet this guy didn't order it. But he's going to use it all he can. 
---
I guess RES is good enough?
---
No worries I was just trying help. Glad you found one
---
Just because someone wants to improve on the idea of something, doesn't mean the current iteration isn't crap.
---
Mine is cloth. Cloth for days. So much cloth. It's because I can't NOT pick up pre-war money. I mean, I just found $10, and I'm always broke, so I pick it up. 
---
Well, in case you are interested - we modded fallout 1 and 2 to be playable in MMO style 
---
From ~~mutants~~ players for ~~mutants~~ players... 
---
Yah to all of that. Skyrim and Fallout 4 modding really spoiled me by allowing my hoarding and collecting to be properly displayed and made into decorations and displays that I could fill or place in my buildings.  I just want ways to show my collections.... maybe when you want to make an item into a display at CAMP, it turns it into a decoration item, just like any other furniture and workbench, so that if your home gets blown up or your CAMP needs to be put back into inventory, it'll still be there as the decoration item.  
---
Fort defiance should be on here for fiber bonus you get aluminum and plastic 
---
Just go to Watoga station after a SBQ fight or whitesprings during a nuke, I see wood there all the time.
---
Events, explore, lob grenades at afk people(in pacifist mode) and then give them food and water and chems (mostly low levels) take work shops for plans. Missile snipe wanted people.
---
see, i just went through the new player side of this (only been playing a couple weeks), the first time a buddy and i were taking over a workshop, a high level player in fully decked-out power armor came by and gave us each full suits of lowbie power armor, a bunch of radaway and rad-x, on and on. but before he waved at us, we were both fully aware that he could destroy everything we'd been building, that he could help mobs kill us when waves came in, and there wasn't a lot our leather-clad pipe pistol-shooting asses could do about it.
---
OP, if you really dig into your stash, you'll see items that just pile up, resources you aren't using, etc. I had 300 circuits.. For what? I don't use em. I barely use wood anymore.. Why do I need 700 of it? A little bit of consolidating and management makes you realize how much space you actually have and how easily it is to waste it. It fills up much quicker than yiu think since the perks don't apply to it.
---
I get wanting to do builds.. But that's working against the perk card system. Each character is a build in itself. You are crippling yourself if you are going for multiple builds on one character, and that means weapon and gear that's usable for one build, not another.. So it's just there taking up space. It's inefficient. Clearly the system isn't meant to be played like that, so the reason you're experiencing the weight issues is because you simply don't need that much stuff.
---
After doing some simple management, purging items I don't need, giving resources to an alt that can use it or simply giving it away, I find myself sitting comfortably at about 400. The only reason it's so high is because I'm scavenging to finish some power armor sets. If you actively go against the limitations the game has, you're not gonna have fun, and that's what is happening to a majority of the people.
---
I agree that another increase would be nice, but there's more pressing things that need to get improved first. Once they start adding new content, by all means, toss a stash upgrade in as well because we will all want to collect the new stuff. 
---
I'm a Calmex addict.
---
Seems to correlate with what I've found so far as well! 
---
No problem! Gotta step up where we can if we wanna make this a stronger game! :)
---
Dang. I knew you could build at others camps as I've done it. Didn't know they had to team first. I've sent a few random requests and when accepted fast traveled to build stuff. Was really wanting to leave additions at randoms. 
---
We need the ability to have card decks that act like loadouts as such. 
---
1 for pve
---
1 for pvp
---
1 for carry weight
---
Etc etc
---
And then be able to hotkey the entire deck somehow so we can switch with just a button. 
---
Have the carry weight one on, run into an event then bam! Switch to our pve deck that has cards we picked dedicated to fighting the ads of the event. 
---
Okay for the weight but i just don't use .38 bullets. If i could recycle them and make .308, .45 and shotgun shells however, i would be in heaven!
---
Ditto
---
Legendary Mole Miner dropped me a 3 star TSE version and its pretty good, I just cant make it great without the mods :/
---
Will we have another Inside-the-Vault this week?
---
True story, sorry I didnt state it but my comment was more for people 50+ tinkering with your builds/perks and inventory management.
---
I think the best way this would work would be to have a designated area that is split into 24 equal parts, then players could build their C.A.M.P in any one of those 24 equal parts, and every time they join a server, it gets placed into one of those 24 spots.  
---
Otherwise, I'm not sure how this would work with so many servers.
---
Let me know on here when you send a friend request please.
---
What a legend üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Other than some ugly crashes at the beginning (when destroying petrified corpses), it has been smooth sailing for me on PS4, and a lot of fun too. 
---
Like, this idea I really 
---
Its been okay. Once i get in a server i stay in. Other times it freezes initially, then after a restart im good to go.
---
Can we arrange a time for tomorrow 
---
Glad that I am not the only one still thinking about stash limit increase and management updates. I'd like a comment from the devs on where this is going and what they're thinking of doing for it. 600 is still not enough for collecting weapons for different styles of builds and building different things imho.
---
Be careful arguing with logic, it makes people angry. Or they will tell you that you arent roleplaying hard enough to justify being a raider.
---
Terra-forming Operator for Warfare N' Settlements
---
Have some gold for making my evening 
---
I hate it as well. I prefer the Fallout 4 way of doing things as perks go.    
---
I'm fine with not having 15 in each stat but having to swap them out got old, boring, and inefficient quick.    
---
I think being unable to have 15 in each is a good thing but not being able to max out and equip everyone is a good thing. Makes your choices matter.
---
If you are going that route, I want [Chuck Norris uzis.](https://i.imgur.com/pkDqx7A.jpg)
---
My problem with the limits is I'm constantly throwing out better weapons and gear, because I don't have the space to hold on to them for 10 levels until I can use them.  Found a full set of PA you can use in 10 levels?  Too bad, toss 'em.
---
Not gonna lie, I‚Äôve done that a few times. 
---
Hmm, where did you find him? I've found a super sloth, a rad toad &amp; a deathclaw
---
I don‚Äôt understand it either. I‚Äôm at 79 and sitting on the launch mission so I‚Äôll kick some food and water, couple stims, maybe a level 5 serrated machete. Nothing game breaking nothing crazy. But they all just run away. I‚Äôll even patiently wait outside the vault 
---
I wear a Faschnact (big eyes, long nose, ear to ear smile) and a straight jacket. 
---
I wield a machete, axe, furious combat knife or chainsaw. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. 
---
*yes, yes I do lol*

You gotta let us know what system you play on. Also you might expand into other... Indulgences. I'm a Nuka Nut

Yep I encountered him at my CAMP in the savage divide just SE if the End of the world

&gt; Girl, you know it's true. Yeah.

Now it's a Cake song
---
Wrong platform
---
I think I've turned into a farmer - I have plenty of crops and exist on home-made soups and roasted meats. Not only do they give you food and water, they also have other little perks, which means I have constant faster AP refresh, extra perception, extra disease resistance, XP boost, etc. The perks make the process worthwhile to me - I usually sell (or drop off at cash register at vendors for others) all the basic old food I find lying around.
---
This is my setup: 
---
Marsupial gives -5 INT.
---
Class Freak 3 reduces this to -2 INT.
---
PA helmet mod Internal Database gives +2 Intelligence.
---
I too wake up in the morning sometimes to find a significant amount of alcohol gone that I cannot consciously account for. I blame the vodka gnomes.
---
Nukacrypt has not solved yet for bravo. 
---
I might be pessimistic here, but I can almost guarantee there will be problems and bugs with player vending
---
You may not want to put your most valuable items all in until they are tried and proven 
---
I don't want them holding too much because they hit level five.  I don't want to be attacked and drop everything.  I probably do hoard too much, but I really do use a lot.  For example, even with the alts, I'm always short on screws.  
---
Once I have all the weapons fully reverse engineered for mods, life will be simpler I guess.  However, with my place on our team being crafting, i'll still use lots.  Believe it or not, I tempered myself down to where I am now...  yikes!
---
Although...  To your point, if I have an alt I keep under 5, then they can't be attacked...  I'll have to think on it!  Thanks!
---
Confirmed.
---
Feel free to add me GT: PRIMUS 112358
---
I've experienced this at whitesprings during a nuke but not on the glasses caverns
---
I had to remove the floor above where I put mine, then replace it with a steeple like roof piece to get mine to work on my 1st floor. Luckily for me it was in a corner that I was not using on either floor anyways. For some reason the roof piece even allows the wire for power to clip through.
---
Considering they have already expanded the stash size once and claiming they have trouble adding more due to tracking and latency issues it's not like they can't do it, meaning they clearly have a legitimate reason for it, and I don't think that reason is "Lol our players should suffer for no reason". You can store infinite content in fallout 4 so it clearly has to do with the multiplayer aspect of the game and the C.A.M.P system. There are many things bethesda are doing that is shady and non-ideal, but not expanding stash size isn't it. I don't see any reason why bethesda would willingly cap stash limit if infinite stash size wasn't problematic for them, there is no conspiracy here. 
---
I'd love to get display racks for my power armor that I'm not using. So I can display my Nuka Cola power armor next to my Nuka fridge and Nuka stash box. 
---
Or at the very least the ability to rename a chassis so I know which set it is without deploying it. 
---
Yes. if you make a weapon or armor, then scrap it, you have a chance to learn a mod. 
---
Ok
---
&gt;It how now been nearly two months since our first stash "upgrade" from 400 to 600. 
---
The game hasn't even been ***out*** for two months.
---
It's basically all apart of that outrage culture revenue generation cycle I described in the previous comment.
---
Simply put, an easy way to make money if you have even a semi-respected video game publication, is to go onto reddit - find something people are mad about - exaggerate the issue and publish an article about the problem back to the very people who described it in the first place.
---
Those people then spread around the article talking about what they talked about in the first place, using it as some sort of source to try to prove their opinion as verifiable fact.
---
And whoever wrote that basically did an hours worth of work in the morning, get to do whatever all day and collect a paycheck, while redditors do the work of spreading their article around for them.
---
It's actually a pretty good system, the only issue is it relies on spreading misery, fear, uncertainty, and doubt to generate revenue.
---
"I'm not a communist but I get where they're coming from" is my weapon of choice 
---
LOL I DIDN'T KNOW THAT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE. Don't think it's a bug, but sometimes diseased eyebots are a rare spawn in the golf club. Had a nuke drop in Morgantown, no ghouls just eyebots. Good for lvl 1-5 twink legendaries
---
Id like TV on the Radio in F76
---
I pressed every button combination I could think of to see if it would start to wiz round faster but no so the mystery continues lol, I‚Äôve got a .50 cal with a fire rate of 91 that spits out bullets much faster than a Gatling 
---
Uh it might be because junk is everywhere.
---
If it was scarce i could see it being different but it simply isn't
---
&gt; Or at the very least the ability to rename a chassis so I know which set it is without deploying it.
---
That'd be a great first step. I never choose wisely the pulling one out of stash. 
---
I would be happy if they would just let us have adjoining CAMP locations with our friends, as it works now, if there is another CAMP within sight of my location, mine won't spawn.
---
I would love to be able to share my Fusion Power with a friend.
---
I approve this message. 
---
As long as we can have M.A.G.A. hats as well! (Either the original or Managing Agrarian-Geological America).
---
This is a frustrating issue. I find most of my time lately searching for plastic to bulk my items, but I'm still always near 600. 
---
That would really mess up the servers, it sounds cool though
---
What they said. We have several alts. All atom purchases and settings are linked to Account and not character. Also achievements work this way...i.e. my alt can drink a Nuka Cherry for a random daily and I get atoms for my Account. 
---
if they disable pvp there will be literally nothing to do in the game, they already stripped us from re-spawning nuke zones and farming areas and increased the spawn timers. Ever since they nerfed these things, all some people have left is the shit box pvp in the game. I have nothing else I need to get in the game so my only option is pvp. of Bethesda listens to this request they might as well turn off all the servers because there already is 0 content left in the game.
---
I have 400+ hours played a level 159, a level 136, a level 35, and a level 20 something mule. I am not trying to create any more characters and redo this stale content again.
---
This definitely extends end game, and has worked on many other games. 
---
YES
---
Carry weight is ridiculous in this game. People defending it, I don't really understand their point of view.
---
You need a mule/friend or multiple accounts. You give the item to a friend, log off, log on to ALT have friend give you back your items.
---
somewhere in chapter 5 of your history textbook, keep reading until you find it
---
i did not know that! but i meant more an immersive first person experience where you could run around and do anything. FO1 was my first PC game at like 16 or 17 years old and i've always been a tabletop RPG fan so i would sit and daydream about wanting games like this. 
---
Why 24/7? I just keep an excavator set on me. I'll sacrifice 10 pounds up front for 150 pounds of extra carry. Just do my normal thing and when I'm ready to warp out, jump in the armor
---
Rad meds actually make decent vendor trash, 5 caps for full strength, 3 for diluted with max barter and with my perks they weigh less than .2 lbs each.
---
I am working on my heavy weapons perks, they make me drool @ SBQ.
---
Don't drop it, but don't sit on it either. Craft those bullets. If you need that much ammo you are farming lead, you should be running Bandolier. If you don't, then it might be ok to ditch the scrap. 
---
FWIW I got a ton of lead from Lucky Hole and I've already burned through it making 50 cal and .556. Need to go back.
---
Part of the reason nobody wants to PvP with you is all the duping and bobblehead cheese going on. You can‚Äôt tell if the player that‚Äôs attempting to instigate with you is loaded with ill gotten gear rendering it pointless and it feels bad. 
---
You can go the route my team did and help new players?
---
We all got past 100, did all the things, got good gear, and still do SBQ/Legendary farming. But it was dull. So I made a joke about running up to some hapless new player, lurking near their camp and playing the part of a BoS recruiter. "Pssst.. hey, kid... wanna join the brotherhood?"
---
Then we did it. Not quite like that, but we'll find new people in areas way over their limit, or just happen across a camp. If they talk with us (as opposed to running away and/or logging off) we usually set them up. Full armor. Weapons. Upgrades. Junk, meds, food, whatever. 
---
The reaction from most of them has been great, and hearing about how a random act like that made their gaming experience better.. well, it's a good thing. I clear out stuff I don't need, get to use unlocks I've never used (it's all super low level, moved past it way before I could pimp it out), and they appreciate it. 
---
One of my clanmates took it a step further with his plan sharing. He'll just give away whatever plans he has to whoever needs it, and takes extra plans from whoever has them. Several of our guys run open camps for anyone to use. 
---
That's how we overcame the end game boredom. Formed our own little team [BoS, 76-1 ART (Armored Response Team) - "Steel Rain"] and do our part to patrol the wasteland. 
---
If you got to the social tab while you're all on the main menu, you can invite to team.  Once all the people are on your team, choose "Play with Team" and everyone will zone into the same place.
---
The fire rate listed on the Gatling gun is incorrect.

2mm Ec rounds. Heavy even with Batteries Included.
---
A very nostalgic fallout 4 bug as well
---
Thanks guys. Looks like I can jump right in.
---
You can add pockets? Is that a mod? Does this apply to combat armor?
---
After the last patch,it's been a f#‚Ç¨king disaster! Literally,the minute the patch was done and loaded up and started,it crashed in 2 mins tops,had a couple good 20-30 mins runs,then crashes,idk what they did,I was hoping the patches were going to be for improvements and not shitting the bed,over again,and then shitting the bed even more. I'm an idiot for continually putting myself threw the disappointment.
---
Something in one of the past updates broke it. My friends and I cant use our lined suits anoymore either
---
Not entirely accurate. The game was nominated in the Fan Favorite Fall Release category at the Gamer's Choice Awards and Game of the Year at the Australian Games Awards. Despite all of the negative feedback surrounding the beta, it still was the 4th best-selling game of November 2018.
---
The issue with them is that their screech attacks break your regular armour way too quickly. They also spot sneaking characters with ease.
---
Dog is suicidal, he might take a long walk off that short cliff. Dont go revenging everyone on your map if that happens
---
I started with 3, then nv, then 1-2, and 4. So kinda reverse order but liked them all in varying degrees for varying reasons. I'm unlike a lot of people who dislike 76 in that I dont find the gameplay unenjoyable, but I am very reliant on a narrative to keep me interested. While 76 has a story, there was no impact my decisions had, so I always felt like there was no point in me being there. For me, feeling pointless feels worse than funky gameplay. I know a whole ton of people are the opposite and love the satisfaction of progressing a character mmo style, but not me. I took a chance on the game knowing it was multiplayer, and unfortunately it didn't pay off for me. No hard feelings 
---
I used to feel this way until I unequipped all my weight reduction perk cards. I'm just carrying around an excessive amount of chems/food/fusion cores/ammo/weapons. 
---
As a natural packrat I don't want to prioritize what I loot, that and I'd like to be not encumbered when picking up weapons to scrap for modifications.
---
PC unfortunately. Just luck really.. i think each time it was with a character that normally wouldn't use a crossbow while in the nuked Whitesprings.
---
I'm curious how ppl will know about the one person on their server with a camp setup with a vending machine.
---
Then will the effort be worth it to find ppls camps and see outrageous prices set.
---
What I meant is I don't think the level matters or if the gun you scrap has specific mods.
---
I started crafting level 40 radium rifles to scrap instead of level 50 and I still have gotten mids from them. I've scraped a bunch with suppressors and automatic receivers and have got nothing.
---
Basically I'm confident that the odds of getting a mod are not in anyway dependent on the level or current mods on what ever you are breaking down.
---
Craft them and break them down will get you mods. The cane only has one mid so your probability of success per each scrap will be low. Keep crafting and scraping.
---
Non-lethal weapons to teepee somones camp, or apply some goofy visual effect to their characters with a pie thrower/feather cannon would be hilarious. 
---
Saw my first just due east of Emmett Mountain Disposal  
---
Was hoping for at least some sort of a fight. Didn't not get one. 
---
I haven't had much issue with junk items. I try to keep \~100 of each bulk item, selling down to 100 when I have extra. For other items that don't bulk, like Ballistic fiber, I sell down to \~150-200 depending on the item. For ammo, I don't keep mini nukes or missiles as they are way too heavy. All other Ballistic ammo I keep on my person as it weighs hardly anything with a level 2 Bandolier.   
---
What DOES cause a lot of weight for me is Ore and Equipment. Extra weapons and armor are a big cause for weight in my Stash but Ore even more so. I use the Excavator PA and it's perk for gathering Ore is very useful. In just one hour I had about 200 lbs of Ore. I am now low on Acid to turn it into useable scrap, but plan on using that metal for more weightless bullets.   
---
While I agree that a stash increase would be optimal, I can't help but feel like most of the people like OP are just hoarding too much stuff. You don't need 5000 pieces of cloth. I feel like Fallout 3-4 has taught us all to save that weapon for that one time we might actually use it some time eventually down the road to kill that one enemy that is kinda hard to kill but you can't because the weapon is in your stash and not in your inventory. I get it, I did the same thing. But I don't need a Broadsider, a Gatling Laser, Minigun, 50 Cal Machine gun, and a Harpoon launcher if I am using rifles.   
---
What would be awesome for me personally, is an option to put weapons/armor on display in your home. Weapon racks on the walls, display cases, etc. For those items that you want to save but won't ever use. It would also be awesome to be able to bulk those items that are currently unbulkable and if the bulk items got a small buff so the weight is a little lower.
---
Navybluepaint is my user. I'll hit you up mate.

I'm a trashcan of a mele class, all strength and I stay encumbered It's been that way since the beginning for me. I got used to not being able to fast travel and always having what we need. I play with the lady so she is playing the game "right" so I am always giving her stuff she needs. 
---
Xbox one! They were level 13, and their name was Karen something. I don‚Äôt know how the whole team thing works, but I wish I could‚Äôve added her or something!
---
You have to check it, I had my CAMP at the shack on the cliff by Charleston, and I could put down roughLynn 4 sets of metal stairs connected to a foundation at the bottom. Takes some time to get it right/usable.
---
I've never seen in walk like 15 feet past his owners. I found a corpse.
---
They're not hard to kill, just annoying with the screech spam. Im a non auto rifle build (stealthy) and even without being able to use sneak against them, they go down fairly quick.
---
Yeah, I've based my CAMP at the hill next to Summerville overview of the New Gad lakebed.  I've had a half dozen instances of logging in to see another camp within stone's throw on the hill with me, and wish I could find the owners so I could friend them and we try to stick to the same servers so we have CAMPs right next to each other for additional protection and flavor.
---
Always kept in my inventory in case of potential communist uprising. Viva la proletariat! Death to the bourgeoisie! May the people assume the means of production! 
---
Yeah, I remember mashing my right trigger to see if I could shoot faster
---
Also, have you used the Light Machine Gun? That thing is FAST, not as many rounds as .50 or Minigun though
---
A solution might be to group up with three other people and have them share their weight reduction cards so that you can focus on damage
---
It does show perk weights in the stash, which makes sorting even more convoluted.
---
Shooting through walls?  That's a paddlin'  
---
Hovering bud not staying still while screech spamming? Thats a paddlin'.
---
Somehow making it to my base with me after respawning half a map away?  That's a paddlin'  
---
and finally, coating the whole area with gas that refuses to dissapate while calling waves of scorched reinforcments so even my first aided stim packs cant heal me up fast enough?  You best believe that's a paddlin'.  
---
Otherwise, no they're nice.
---
I guess I am a power armor user and don't have to deal with that 
---
I've got a set of ultracite that I can't equip yet. At first I had screwed up and taken it off the chassis. I finally got it back on a chassis and stashed. But I've got 5 frames: Ultracite, Excavator, T60, T51b (Nuka) and T45. I normally have my Excavator with me, but like to grab my T60 when going into tough areas. 
---
As it stands right now, I have to grab all my frames and start deploying. And then hope I deploy the one I want BEFORE I get to the Ultracite and have to sit there and wait for it to recall. 
---
Ruined? I pray that this happens to me someday. ;\_; 
---
Can confirm am dumbass level 110
---
EB Games Australia has already debunked it.
---
Honestly, sense the worst of the worst duplication glitches have been patched the game has been multitudes more stable. I dont see why they couldn't allow us more stache limit as well as reducing the budget cost on defences as well. Right  now the defences are practically useless for anything other than low level mob spawns that attack your camp.....
---
K. Thanks for clarifying. 
---
It definitely seems to fluctuate.  As a solution architect I could list a multitude of possible reasons that as a gamer I would careless about because I paid to play and I understand the frustration.  Some days I just log off and come.back another day because of it.
---
Hell, I currently use a single shot .50 sniper (with a Gauss rifle for more "friendly" creatures) which makes 100 rounds at a time. 400 rounds lasts me about an hour.
---
I've read that Rad Shield does not suppress mutations either. Haven't tested. 
---
So the way to go about it is just pop a few diluted at a time.  How many do you typically use at a time with power armor?
---
That‚Äôs a great idea.  Tennis ball artillery and ping pong ball pistols.  Maybe paintball guns with 0.00005 damage to leave messages.
---
"I glanced though the cut and I seen my homey Nate."
---
No more bending, no more work, give us a raise you big fat jerk!!!
---
Yeah completely agree. Max pero points should be either at 70 (so you can either Max all out to 10 or go higher on your preferred stats or 76 because it's Fallout 76. Hope they up the limit soon.
---
Don‚Äôt disagree with you it‚Äôs just funny that with the resources the have they release a game that was already coded for them and have to limit it player storage, not saying it doesn‚Äôt cause problems. It‚Äôs clearly not a priority and I don‚Äôt think new content is either. I think the most work will be going to pvp balancing from here on out which is fine I guess I just don‚Äôt think that appeals to the majority of people who play this game it‚Äôs just not set up for balanced pvp.
---
I also don‚Äôt feel they are trying to make their players suffer I think they‚Äôve made their profit and are just trying to satisfy the loudest voices until they‚Äôve bled the game dry. I love the game and also worry about long term playability how can they keep this online game alive when they have multiple studios already on it and have so many projects in the works? The short answer they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm guessing they will do just enough to keep it running but once the announcement is made of their next big title my guess is this game is in the sewer. Who‚Äôs know?ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è there‚Äôs my little rant I would love more success of this gameü§û I just don‚Äôt see it happening with track it‚Äôs on.

just north east of thunder mountain substation tm-01

there is a road and a railroad track both spots can have one of the random encounter creatures i found him there

Oh this isn't the first.  I've had it happen all over..WS, SBQ, and various other places I've tried.  Not always but enough times to remember each one.  üò£
---
And can you also confirm or deny the upcoming ghoul strippers while you're at it? I dunno if I should be excited or terrified.

I unsubbed after the 4th / 5th fake controversy. There's so much salt there I could sell it for a fortune in-game.

Er, junk IS a reward. You use it to make and repair all the other stuff in the game. Play the game for a couple of hours without using any junk whatsoever. See how quickly it goes downhill. 
---
I'm wearing excavator 24/7 and have slowly been whittling down my food and chems so I can use my regular armor and/or Ultracite armor as the mood strikes.

I just get rid of the stuff I don‚Äôt use and know I won‚Äôt need much of or can get quickly. Like concrete. Where the hell is it all coming from??? I‚Äôm not picking it up on purpose, I‚Äôm not collecting it since I found the metal building plans. Yet every other week I‚Äôll find I‚Äôve got 20-30 bulk wraps worth.
---
I think I have a hoarding problem 
---
There was a really good post on here that shows the diminishing returns of some perks.  It shows how some perks are much more beneficial at Rank 1 and others definitely should be ranked up to 3. 
---
It's a a lot to read but I think it explains it well:

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9z8jgc/a_guide_to_diminishing_returns_with_perks/

the plans thing is a mod already
---
I mean, unless you see an announcement specifically from Bethesda on it, I think it's pretty clear it's more clickbait garbage based on faulty assumptions to generate traffic/revenue. Just like half the other articles and YouTube videos out there. 
---
Some YouTubers have been posting about it going f2p, Kinda wonky.
---
Are you serious?!
---
Ghoul stripper confirmed wohooo!
---
handmade is pretty good for targeting SBs at any point in their attack cycle imo
---
Bye bye loot
---
Thanks man ill do that
---
A number Posts forwarded from friends that play the game actually, when you get numerous people sending you stuff from different sources  it does play wonders on the mind
---
Yep. There's a Pocketed mod for +5 carry weight per piece and Deep Pocketed for +10 per piece.
---
yeah its annoying..but what i found out is that a ton of my weight was from gunpowder..also instead of scrapping all of my junk..im going thru each one individually and deciding if i wanna scrap it or not..if it is something common like, steel, wood, plastic..im just selling that to vendors..for my own carry weight..so much of it is these legendary armors
---
yes.  There is a mod called pocketed and a mod called deep pocketed.
---
You need to get either plan both for Limbs and Torso.
---
So 4 plans for all 4 mods. (Deep pocketed limbs, deep pocketed torso, pocketed limbs, pocketed torso)
---
Also, the torso mods right now are broken and pocketed will give you +15 instead of +10, but that will likely be fixed, so just deep pocket everything imo.
---
&gt;Just dont be a hoarder my dude
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Worst is when you fall into one right after killing the queen. All that sweet stable flux is instantly gone.
---
That‚Äôs what I kind of go for also.  Melee and a zealots Gatling gun.  I have some heavy weapons for nuke-queen fights too. I‚Äôll build my perk set on nukes-dragons if y‚Äôall want 
---
What does one actively need into for?
---
Yes there is a cap limit. There is also a limit on how.much you can sell to vendors each day.
---
This is a good idea, but let's not put the cart before the horse... I've had the last few Uranium Fever events crash before being able to complete them. Which is extremely annoying, because I depend on getting XP from completing the event, as well as the rewards. They still need to fix game crashes and disconnects before fine tuning what they have.
---
Lol everyone said TSE needed a nerf until they got theirs. I'm sorry y'all but a game like this needs more than one or two viable builds. Nerf Bloodied melee similarly. Then buff other effects and we'd have balance
---
‚ÄúMy dealer‚Äù  lol.  First legendary ultracite sniper rifle is free.
---
This would be one of the topics ive been forwarded on this. Do you have a link to their debunk? 
---
These are all speculations because some retailers and local gaming stores are pulling Fallout 76 from their shelves.
---
Theres so many reasons that could contribute to that.
---
Brick buildings!
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and have the barbed mod. The spiked mod is the one I‚Äôm looking for. Thanks though.

( I will attach photo )
---
Best base I found was here. It‚Äôs just north of a workshop, area has a junk extractor which is handy for farming materials. 
---
Low level enemies and all times. One down side is it is a popular low level base zone so you might have to hop servers a few times but I stayed in this base till I was level 70 odd quite happily. 
---
I only have been victim to griefing once in the game some high level noob thought he was cool trashing my base with his TSE. I went back with a couple of levels higher them him and got revenge on his base lol. Of course you don‚Äôt have to seek revenge but it‚Äôs pretty satisfying griefing the griefer! 
---
Have fun exploring!
---
The Acid rate at hemlock holes sucks.  Seems less than 10 an hour.

One disconnect (PS4).

Love this!
---
No problem! May do a quick and dirty video at some point.
---
Lol, "don't need 400 lead". You must play melee.
---
I've only gotten one from a SBQ and many I was fortunate to run across players who sell the recipes.  I only spent the time to get them so I could make them for our group and friends.  I don't believe a mutation should cost 4k+ caps.  I have several crafted I sell but that's only because we scrounged hard a couple times and everyone ended up collecting way too much, lol, so I need to offload them now.  Otherwise, I'm gaming.  
---
After my last horrible griefer experience I just bail when anyone of considerate levels +50 approaches me.
---
I know it sounds paranoid but there‚Äôs too many bored nutbags w/TSE 
---
I‚Äôm fine with bailing and missing a friend opportunity as long as my camp stays intact and unharmed.
---
Fallout 76 reminds me of the feeling I have if I ate my favorite foods lukewarm, I would rather spit it out. Do not get me wrong, the game was fun and I enjoyed playing with my friends and random people. But as a whole the game was not as appealing to me as all the other Fallout games I have played. Bethesda stripped down their core game and made it diluted, it was not the same. 
---
It disappoints me that the graphics are the same as Fallout 4 and even the character models, hair patterns and other elements of the earlier games were ported over. This lack of effort is definitely noticeable and frustrating since each Fallout game before the new content had me drooling and staying up late for days on end, grinding away so I can get this gun or that suit of armor. The game had many bugs when I started playing just two weeks after release and at that time I also bought it on sale, which is a tell-tale sign that something went wrong and the developers were scrambling for a stronger player base. 
---
As I said, the game was fun but it definitely was missing key ingredients and needed more time in the oven. As Merry Berry says, ‚Äúthat was informal.‚Äù
---
I'd like to see workshops people can claim to live in and not always defend.  Claim and share a town with the other players on the server, and give people incentives to peacefully come in for some discounts or resources or games or something.
---
If you go to Grafton Steel Mill (not the workshop) the super mutants spawn infinitely with laser rifles and automatic pipe rifles and without the scrapper perk it takes me about 5 minutes to get 200 steel.

With the history from bethesda have had regarding the game. Without an official statement, i would not put it past them
---
I agree.
---
Having played Fallout games since the 90‚Äôs I have enjoyed the progression.
---
I do find aspects of 76 to be frustrating, and the lack of NPCs still throws me off, but I like the ideas behind this game to the point that I hope they keep going and maybe release expansions that revisit old areas such as the founding of Shady Sands.
---

There you go. :)
---
The problem I seem to have is that I use vats to run around, and will target check with it, cuts down on unwanted molerats etc. Trouble is, when I go to see how many enemies there are and press right, it can use a stimpack if there is no second enemy to target.
---
You say you're running Carnivore, and yet you apparently don't know about Grilled Radstag?

My 1-STR junk-hoarding ass swears by that stuff.

Wood build works with chameleon mutation, and with the free states shadowed plan, its terrific for stealth characters.

Happy Cake Day

Excellent! I get some of my best moments in the game doing this. Glad to hear more and doing this. 
---
If you are interested (and on PC), my clan is doing a new player open house this weekend. I'll be posting details.. but it will be a set location you can swing by, get all level appropriate weapons/armor, upgrades, plans, etc. Pretty much free, donate if you want to.

Do you think they were born on June 3rd in 1992?
---
Calm down fren, the only thing they take off is their skin
---
Honest question... why do you destroy bases that are "too close" to yours?
---
1.  ASAP, cause it's fun.  Slam down a small base with workbenches whenever you need it, then, later on, you can work on building a big one.
---
2.  After lvl 5, pvp is always on...kinda? (They have to hit you, and then you must return the hit to initiate it), HOWEVER, you can go into game settings and activate pacifist mode, this makes it so you won't be flagged for pvp by accidentally hitting someone.
---
3.  Not yet.
---
4.  Yes, any player can destroy your base, this flags them as wanted and puts a price on thier head.  Rebuilding is as easy as hitting repair all on your c.a.m.p device.
---
5.  If your base cannot be placed down, the server gives you a message when you log on letting you know.  You can then move your base free of charge or join another server so it gets put down correctly.
---
Just have to run up hit a button and run like hell.... just try to be sneaky coming up behind it
---
It usually takes me about 15-20 minutes to get through the silo.  Usually I'm in a group so people are repairing and getting ready which is what I meant by prep.  Last night while trying to launch we did spend an hour trying to walk through a glitched silo before we hit a dead end and ended up jumping servers.  It happens.  The flow glitches, vats glitches, etc.
---
It‚Äôs in the game already
---
This is just wrong. I one shot nearly everything with both my Bloody Lever Action and Explosive Gauss. Mobs are bullet sponges when you DONT min/max.
---
Only real impact it has is on max durability when crafting.
---
Yes, you can only have 25,000 caps.
---
Daaaaamn, I wish I'd thought of that sooner.. had the inkling of just doing something like that a few days ago but hadn't even pondered how much broader I could make my char just taking some 1* perks instead... Thanks is for this! Hopefully I can get some 1* versions of perk cards I've already leveled up..
---
Think I might drop a support ticket into Bethesda if it‚Äôs not just me that‚Äôs noticed üëç
---
The screech spam is really the only problem. It doesn‚Äôt even do that much damage in PA you just can‚Äôt see through it. I‚Äôd be fine if it wasn‚Äôt a 2 minute straight barrage.
---
I think I high level was nearby it usually lvl21 or at least was on my first two characters. I killed the MFüòÇ
---
Right or wrong that thing still does a lot of DPS and is pretty easy on ammo that‚Äôs already pretty cheap to make ... I like it better than the mini gun ... have not really messed with the .50 cal yet although I‚Äôve got one in my inventory
---
I do the same.  There's basically no consequence to walking around an area while overencumbered - it only matters if you're walking between zones of fast traveling.  So I'll just walk around and clear the zone while encumbered, then pop the armor on and fast travel to a vendor.
---
Hard call on base to be honest. It's a personal preference
---
Atter level 5 yes Unless you go into game settings and turn it off,  off mostly you can still be killed under certain circumstances
---
Sort of.
---
Sadly yes, that's always possible

Just log off the world and hop into a new one till it places it down again. 
---
Junk is everywhere!
---
You a pc player?
---
From what I have seen it was an unsubstantiated claim on Reddit, then YouTube picked it up because someone needed content, and now a clickbait site is hosting it to feed it back to reddit. The only evidence is EB Aus pulling the game which they denied on Twitter. Pretty obvious that there's a campaign to push for this lol. Someone is trying to get the fo76 community angry lol

Rule 7?

A friend of mine will leave a Molotov and some fertilizer on your doorstep ... Just don't step on it to put it out.

you ok, champ?

If you have PS4 I can send you the photo of the location via there as I‚Äôm new to reddit so no idea how I can show you the photo ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I wish they would have written "this is an experiment for us" on the box. If idea known they were just dicking around I would have passed on it.
---
Based on being complete and compelling fo75 is a failure.
---
Wait, who is the other vendor?
---
Server hop and they'll be all "yes sir, no sir" again!
---
So my mentality is the same. I'm afraid to give up any thing in fear of needing it later. That's an irrational thought. So I ask, what's the difference between 400, 600, 1200 pounds. Eventually we'll hit the limit and keep hoarding and wanting more space. I'm fine with 600 because there's nothing I have to do RIGHT NOW, that can't wait until I have what I need. It sucks, but that's where it's at.
---
If you have atom shop PA skins when applied gives your PA the atom shop logo.
---
That‚Äôs about the extent of its usefulness lolz
---
Honestly, they would only need to make an official statement because fools like you are giving this rumor so much traction.  I'd rather we not have to get an official statement on rumors being spread by idiots (after a source has already debunked it).
---
It's good to build your base near the area where you are currently doing quests. So Flatwood at the start, and Morganstown area soon after.
---
PvP is always on. But you have a heavy defense when you are attacked by another player. You can usually just ignore them until they get bored, or you Fast Travel somewhere else.
---
I've seen no option for a Shop in your C.A.M.P., but every Train Station and many other locations have a robot Vendor, so they are not very far away.
---
Yep, people can try and wreck your base as well as the local fauna. It's pretty cheap to repair, though. The option is available when when you focus on the C.A.M.P.
---
Your base disappears from the server when you log out. If someone has a C.A.M.P. there when you log in, you can try a different server, or just pick a new spot. The game automatically blueprints major parts of your base when you move, so it's not too time consuming to rebuild.
---
Any workbench will let you scrap all the junk you find . And your STASH chest will let you dump it all in one go. Try not to be much of a scavenger, though. Weight for your character and the STASH will be a major limiting factory. Don't get too attached to weapons and armor as well. Even the Legendary items will quickly become obsolete as you level.
---
There actually is a limit. Caps are limited to (capped at) 25,000. 
---
buy a plunger before you need a plunger 
---
If I‚Äôm being honest, it just sounds like you‚Äôll take any excuse to kick over the other kid‚Äôs sandcastles. At the end of the day, you do that because a part of you enjoys destroying something that someone else built. Own it if you wanna be a raider. 
---
The wall cabinet still doesn't work though. They wont be able to add the first aid box.
---
If you are good at surviving (since you need to stay at below 30% hp) and have a strong weapon, look at a full set of Unyielding and Radicool. I can easily get 30+ str with that combo and my carry weight is about 350 outside of power armor. I also have the marsupial mutation.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried any sneak builds but I‚Äôve seen this a few times. Do we know if this is intentional? Judging from their attacks I just assumed them being able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù past sneak was related to some form of super sonar they got from being related to bats. 
---
I‚Äôll just be happy the day they make it so I can hit for full damage without having to wait for them to fully prepare and one shot me.
---
Go help the noobs being attached by SB
---
They‚Äôre not hard to find just follow the green smoke
---
Do you still have him?
---
Do you sell anything to other players? As it stands there's no reasonable way to store even 10 guns (100-200lbs) or armor (10-50lbs), or a decent stock of Flux (1lb each!) for crafting.
---
&gt; hoarders
---
"Normal" hoarders don't cause problems. It's the guys waddling around with 500,000lbs of duped items.
---
That is very well put. üòÇ
---
For the same reason they‚Äôd want 2000000 copies of plans for ivory revolver grips.
---
The level of it depends who was in its cell to spawn it in first .... just like almost every other mob.... took me a while to realize that the reason some areas were so damn hard was because high level players had been there before I had and pre spawned the monsters at levels I couldn't ever kill
---
Explosive :)
---
"They took our jobs!" \*whack\* KABOOM
---
It finds you :)
---
But really, it truly is a random encounter, and not always in Flatwoods. My only encounter was in Cranberry Bog.
---
Haven‚Äôt tried one yet but I picked up a plan and crafting one to try is def on the to do list üëç
---
This would be super nice but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd happen. The amount of times I‚Äôve caught parasites from playing whack-a-molerat....shivers.
---
It a +2 to strength.  Its a torso mod.
---
Wish you could save and apply different perk setups 
---
There really should be, you can get Enclave paintjobs for armor in Fallout 4 via Creation Club, so the assets are there. I‚Äôm hoping they bring that stuff into 76 with the Faction PvP update
---
When the local news websites pick up on this, it is a chain of events that does spread like wildfire. Its a controversial thing to bring up amongst many. Which is why i would hope for an official statement 
---
Some have been fixed but stability  is still crap
---
Yeah, I saw a lot of high level people (70‚Äôs-90‚Äôs) and I didn‚Äôt wanna get too close. I made the mistake of passing through the toxic valley area with whatever city that is, and got demolished. I accidentally entered the super mutant protest event, and ended up basically cowering behind two high level players who thankfully just protected me while I occasionally shot at the mutants. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done the explosive bait one on leader of the pack event three timesüòÇ
---
This Has A Nice Kangaroo Soup
---
They'll up it eventually, they'll have to. The freshness of of the current perk cards is gonna go mighty soon
---
no.
---
[That happened to me, too.](https://i.imgur.com/1DeH4JN.jpg)
---
Weapon damage perks are overrated for the most part and trading them off for QoL perks is usually worth it unless you're looking for some specific damage threshold. (i.e. looking to take down glowing ones in 2 hits instead of 3) Also thru-hiker 3 allows you to carry 10x more food than base and 2.5x more food than rank 2 so it's definitely worth maxing. 
---
No.
---
Sure, but they're usually based on some form of substance or gained from a reliable source. 
---
It was on the front page today, I think from pc gaming sub
---
I always equip it prior to using a radaway. I even tried equipping it early and fast traveled before using it.  I use it and the mutation lost displays after 10 seconds or so. 
---
How am I supposed calm down when you keep making this seem sexier?!!!!
---
Livers are good with salt, and a nice Chianti and fava beans
---
This has probably been introduced, but some perk cards need to be passive such as lock pick, hacker, and perhaps even weight reduction perks. Maybe unlock passive slots as you level up, especially past level 50? I don't know the fine details of this idea, but there really needs to be something. 
---
I also have a bunch of cards that are purely about weight reduction because stash, vendor cap limit, and building opportunity is to minuscule in this game. Increasing stash limit won't solve anything for storage because there is so little use for scrap. We can repair our gear and build CAMP's with tiny budgets while workshops are worthless because you take them to get more scrap and they don't save anything you do.
---
[I'm tossing in a write up I did about workshops because they need a re-work to become something useful or at the very least interesting for construction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3f1tm/i_think_im_done_with_workshops_until_they_get_a/) Whether this is how they are fixed or other ideas are out there, we need a place to actually invest our looted items and scrap. Can't build with it because nothing is saved and can't sell it because vendors only have 200 caps each day.
---
I'd love to sell all the extra stuff I've looted (Bobble heads, Radaway, Rad-x, drugs, scrap, excess legendaries, etc), but there is simply no outlet for this stuff. It sits in my inventory, reliant on weight reduction perks to be able to hold any of it. Can't put it into stash because the stash doesn't utilize the weight reduction perks so it takes up more space than it should. Stash limit increase also won't do anything for weight reduction perks because we need the reduced weight on equipment we're using or we can't pick up anything that we actually need. The only outlet is to eventually drop it and hope someone picks it up, or try to find someone. I found a level 3 player this weekend and dropped him a bunch of bulk adhesive, screws, leather, cloth, etc. that I could not sell because no vendors had any caps left. 
---
After a bit of a hiatus, I played this weekend for about 12 hours or so and 80% of the time I was walking around over-encumbered. I only just hit level 50 and am feeling the pain of a game that has essentially turned into an inventory management game without any real ability to manage your inventory without just dropping half of what you scavenged for. I can only imagine the struggle of level 100+ or level 200+ players. 
---
**TL:DR**
---
- On topic, I think there needs to be some adjustment whether it's additional SPECIAL points or introducing passive perk cards. 
---
- Somewhat related to topic, increasing Stash limit is not a fix to issues with inventory. A full stash is a symptom of not having outlets for using your scavenged materials. Can't reliably sell excess equipment, scrap, or aid to vendors, eventual cap limit, and can barely build anything with only small CAMP budgets. 
---
- The game inevitably becomes an inventory management simulator
---
I want to like this game so much because I genuinely have a lot of fun with it, when I'm actually playing the game and not spending 4 hours trying to figure out my inventory and perk builds in a way that circumvents weight reduction and inventory management. 
---
/rant
---
I too am on PS4 willing to lend a hand anytime! 
---
I wish we had an optional message board. For those that dont have mics, dont want to use them, or maybe have to be quiet during gameplay due to roommates or something.
---
"I dont have a mic, but what kind of gun is that?"
---
"Alien blaster" 
---
I spent nearly an hour and a half fending off wave after wave of super mutants at Grafton Steele, just for another player to run through and have them spawn another 20 levels above mine. Still touched it out, another half hour later and it was cleared.
---
Until the scorpions arrived.
---
Then I spent another half hour building my defenses up to shove off the wasteland because god damn it this is my house and the wastes will not waste me! 
---
After I was finally safe, I took a step back and realized I had entirely forgotten where I was in real life. I had become so immersed, so entangled in the combat, that I forgot that dying in the game meant losing around 50c of junk and that‚Äôs all. I was fighting for my home, for the civilization that once stood, and most off all for my life. The mutie scum can eat my post apocalypdick.
---
This game is a masterpiece imo, even with all its flaws, I find it way more satisfying and enjoyable in the long term than fo3, fo4, or FNV. 
---
Sometimes we get too tangled up in our petty complaints to appreciate what Bethesda has given us, and the efforts they‚Äôre making to improve it.
---
Idk why or how it could go f2p anyway. Bethesda/Zenimax is too much of a money grubbing company to make it completely free lol. Reason I say is because when ESO went f2p they simply took away the subscription fee and still charged 60-120 dollars for the game. Charged people 30 dollars to play as an Imperial.
---
76 won't go f2p
---
You are going to get varying answers, it really comes down to your expectations.  Personally I am having a blast and don't get my panties in a ruffle if shit happens now and then. However, I am not blind to some of the communities complaint.  If this is your type of game, and you have played and liked other Fallout games, then you'll probably have fun.  If you like to play until something goes wrong, then blog about it like Bethesda is personally attacking you, then this is also the game for you.
---
Awesome
---
I‚Äôve used it for spray and praying weak horde enemies, like feral ghouls and whatnot
---
Us console folks cant use those. 
---
I had a zealot one drop so thought I‚Äôd keep it and try it on scorched mobs, seems to do well but it was hard to tell as there were 4 of up spraying them with heavy gun fire lol
---
Oh I totally got all of that. And I agree with you. I see it all over the place.
---
I work in sci fi publishing. I totally get outrage culture. 
---
I‚Äôd like to see a system where a room at the Whitespring, the second floor of the Top of the World, and a few other places would be set up for player vending. Each area has 24 vending machines, one for each person on the server. Having it set up in multiple places like this prevents everyone from trying to shop in the same place. 
---
From your stash you can send things to the vending machine and set a price. It then shows up in your vendor at all the various locations. If it‚Äôs empty it just has an ‚Äúout of order‚Äù sign. 
---
People have been wanting player hubs and this could help with that. 
---
Frame drops, crashes, d/cs
---
Are consoles worth getting?
---
What they could do, at least, is make the weight reduction perks reduce their respective item groups by a full 100%. 90% means the problem will always exist even though we're spec'd for it. 
---
Your chances of being not gored in the ass as you run away are approx. 3,720 to 1.
---
Then no, those issues have not been fixed
---
Wow, that's nasty. I was grinding radium rifle mods because it was the first two-shot I picked up, but I convinced myself to dump it eventually.
---
Maybe trade it for something less painful?
---
It was Poseidon and Charleston where it happened today.
---
There were like 50 posts about it, and you must not have read the responses. 
---
Use your brain, do you think it‚Äôs going free to play? 
---
Wait, are you trying to encourage griefing? I would totally start wrecking people's stuff to turn into a scorched.
---
Not much, unless you rely on those points for your perks. I just wanted to share the way I use to negate the penalty from Marsupial.
---
Bethesda, like many others, simply just forgot about the game.
---
LOL i didnt even realize how bad that was musta been falling asleep. Ima leave it bc thats funny. I usually am bad with typos but that probably was me dozin off 
---
Performance to dollar? Yes. Not everyone needs to spend more on technology to have mitigating increase of performance.

At what point do these idiots get the ban?
---
This only applies for the team leader if I remember correctly.
---
I've never seen it be above a level 62 or something in that specific location. I came in there at 100+ and it wasn't a max level for me
---
Doesn‚Äôt help that in previous games it was weightless, near useless, and sold for a cap each
---
A legend about how shit it is would still be a legend.
---
How do you go about transferring stuff between your characters?
---
Yes they did. I'm not exactly sure what the buffs were though
---
So kinda like Xur from Destiny? :0
---
I‚Äôm down for this!
---
Yeah the Grafton area is probably 15-20
---
But if you‚Äôre ranged build go and farm xp by taking out Grafton monster at hemlock
---
If you‚Äôre PA enabled go grab workshop 
---
If you get anglers they drop excessive adhesive 
---
And acid for smelting
---
I wish people would fucking use their brains when they see shit like this. OMG SOMETHING IS ON THE INTERNET ITS TRUE 
---
You Sound like an imbecile. ‚ÄòHonest player‚Äô lol... i get why people don‚Äôt wanna farm full 3*** unyielding sentinel, it‚Äôs virtually impossible. The guy even Got alot of em the hard Way, what does it hurt you he bought it? Beats spending 1000 hours before you Can actually enjoy playing the game.
---
Sold a lvl 45 wood 3 star at Watoga train station yesterday, you should always check there for legendaries. With the SBQ fight and legendary robot farming the train station is a great place to go.
---
A lot of people had their minds made up about this game from the moment it was announced.  With nothing more than a trailer and game details to go on, people were bemoaning how FO76 had ruined the franchise.  Was it a perfect game upon release? No. Is it perfect now? Again, no.  But a lot of the criticism I hear on a regular basis ("No NPCs deprive the game of soul!"; "V.A.T.S is totally ruined!") are the same criticisms I heard before there was even a beta where people could try it for themselves. The game is not for everyone. I get that.  But I honestly feel a large portion of the Internet Rage Machine came from people who had their formed their opinion before there was even a game to play.
---
Nope, Zenimax/Bethesda like money too much. People don't realize how Bethesda thinks about the consumer feelings on the product. As long as people are buying the disc and the atom shop is rolling they don't care
---
I've sold at least 15 in the last 2 days to vendors .üòÇ  its too much hassle to sell to players
---
1.  You bases best spot is used as a free fast travel locations, so central is best for fast travel, but people might come across it.  Your call  
---
2. PVP was enabled when you hit lvl 5, if you dont want to participate, turn on PACIFIST MODE in the options menu.  PVP is very broken though and you still might get killed
---
3. Building shops is possible, but they replace your camp, and you must be there to actively buy and sell.  You can not setup an auction house or a vending machine.  Only player to player trades.
---
4. Players can and will grief your base.   I keep mine small so repair costs dont hurt so much.  If you look at point 1, it might be worth hiding your base if its nice.
---
5. If you log on to the server and someone else has a base at your spot, you can move your base without paying, but this will move it permanently.  If you dont care, go for it.  If you like your base spot, quit to menu and find another world, or play without a camp on that server.
---
6. Junk is used to make EVERYTHING.  Pick a weapon and an armour type and try to hoard some materials for repairs.  But the weapon/armour type will change as you grow, so make sure you throw out the old and update with the new.  Weight management is the tough part, so dont hoard shit you arent using.  (Over 500 of anything but steel and springs, you wont need)
---
Wow so the SBQ fight actually punishes you for fighting with more people. Good job Bethesda.
---
I'd really like it if team members markers were different colors, especially custom markers. 
---
Dang, I try to spawn him once a day doing my vendor run.  I'm jelly lol!
---
I guess instead of scorchbeast liberty prime should spawn. 
---
Someone in game tried to convince me the game was going F2P and the lunchboxes were proof that it was. He kept following me and telling me how much the game sucked so I just ended up server hopping. A bit hypocritical considering he was playing the game himself and was around level 80...
---
Glad I could help, I have multiple differeant lvl perk cards I use as fillers depending on the loadout + perks im using and what slots I have open.
---
Legendary 3* gear has also allowed me to reduce the weight reduction perks I use.
---
ahhhhh *ROUGHLYNN*
---
Almost done with getting a few more atom points
---
not soon enough.

One day pal, one day. I have faith

I was just doing this last night, I was trying to sneak up in it, coming down from a cliff, and I get right on top of the area. No death claw... I searched around and finally found it. It was already dead. So like. Fuck me I guess
---
"An exercise in futility" it really is, other games have been trying for literal decades and haven't been able to find a balance. I think, in their arrogance. Bethesda though they would be the ones to crack it. Either that other they were to incompetent to forsee it as a problem.
---
Idk lvl 40 something diseased blood bugs buzzing the elevator when your lvl 15 is the scariest shit...... 
---
I‚Äôve seen the mod, not the plan
---
That would be the only short coming but honestly durability is a quality of life perk so I‚Äôm fine with it being grouped with passives and perks. Those extra perk points aren‚Äôt going to tip the games balance any more than TSE that literally do 1000% more damage.
---
The loadout swap sounds amazing. I think I‚Äôd rather consider that than my original idea if you use specific loadouts for specific enemies. But for the generalist player the loadout idea and my idea yield the same result just with less menu swapping.
---
This was a good read and I appreciate the feedback.
---
My problem is just not being able to see them to aim at them.
---
Right down a glowing sphincter.
---
How does I get it?
---
I‚Äôve tried but I can‚Äôt seem to get any ‚Äògood‚Äô mutations. 
---
Yeah other than being a jerk I really don't know why people continue to do that.
---
ALUMINUM AND ADHESIVE.....TAKE IT ALL
---
Idk man I was just trotting down the mountain and caught a glimpse of it. Thought process: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna die to this bastard on this playthrough...la la la la...wait was that a?..no way...‚Äù(gets closer) ‚Äúson of a bitch you did me dirty this time Todd...got this just tap a on it and run...oh shit it saw me...‚Äù (throws explosive bait, interacts with deathclaw) ‚Äúfuck one shotted me...life saving metal arm thank the lord...run, run, run‚Äù bait explodes üëç
---
Brilliant, thanks. I think I visited the BoS one once, and then forgot about it completely. 
---
enjoy!
---
Yeah I offloaded bulk aluminum to the vendor the other day. it kind of hurt my soul.
---
How I manage weight is by only keeping a bulk of 10 of each material and 100 unbulkable (gold, silver, abestos, circuits, crystal shards, anticeptic, nuclear material, black titanium) scraps with the exception of the notables: adhesive, screws, springs, gears, ballistic fiber, any stable flux with a soft cap of 50 bulk and 500 loose. Hardened mass, glowing mass, high radiation fluids I won't exceed 20. 
---
I'd settle for a feature allowing us to apply our weight reduction perk cards (even the ones not currently equipped) to our stash. 
---
I spend a good 10 minutes getting my junk back once... slid down the side just enough to reach it and not fall in.. eventually after falling in multiple times.
---
Agree this is probably what is happening. Use diluted rad x
---
I'll pm you details
---
Make friends with deadclaw? Fuck you?or fuck it?üòÇ
---
Cool
---
Junk is used to maintain and build your gear to go and collect rewards.  Plans and legendary gear are rewards: all of which is discarded on the ground unless it's immediately useful.  That isn't right.
---
The struggle is real. You have no idea what it is like living vendor cap refresh by vendor cap refresh only to blow it all on radium rifles and springs .....to walk into a train station and see a jet pack mod for your power armor on the wall but you blew all of your caps on breaking down radium rifles and didn't even get a mod.
---
Wow, never noticed that, but then, I haven't done those BoS missions.
---
Oooohhh. Makes sense.
---
Someone should have just called them out at the beginning, then. Not everyone knows everything.
---
What is this QoL people keeping saying? Quality of life? What perks are those?
---
So, the exact opposite of what it is now, is what you are saying?
---
Wow, people are outraged at the mere mention of this game going f2p.
---
The game has no future without going f2p though. 
---
I didn't watch the video, you are saying he one-shots scorchbeasts in the video?  Because if so that's just fking stupid.  He's either not being honest or it's just plain broken.
---
they moved the team to another game
---
Lol I know I just try to run past the best was early in the game when stingwings were glitched and could one shot anyone even in PAüòÇ
---
If the green "you can place" glow actually meant anything, I wouldn't care nearly as much. 
---
But if I finagle a green after two or three minutes, getting an error is a real blow and grounds for rage. 
---
Rumors usually spread because they hold some truth to them.
---
either as a random mutation from radiation, or by buying a serum for it in the enclave.
---
if you are trying to get it, aquire a level 2 "starched genes" luck card and hold it.  you can't gain/lose a mutation while it's equipped.
---
once you get the mutation, then equip the card so that radaway doesn't accidentally remove your mutation.
---
I actually don't know if serum mutations can be removed by rad away?  I'd hope not.
---
I second this. Deep Pocketed is a must for me. That's an extra 50 carry weight if it's on every armor piece.
---
I hate to break it to you, but if you're already keeping 600lbs of junk, then a stash expansion wouldn't be world changing. It just means a week later you'll have 800lbs of junk and still no free stash space. 
---
The same is true for the OP: if you can't prioritize what you have now then you won't be able to with a higher limit (if you have one mule then the limit might be the problem but if you have 4 mules then it's time to look in the mirror).
---
That would be cool, level 97 here. That would be a cool way to expand gameplay!
---
i played untill lvl 86 and still had the quest in my logs, i restarted though lol
---
It was released in November, the 14th to be precise...
---
You might wanna check your Calendar.
---
Please be sure to \[SPOILER\] your topics!  I came in here to see what on earth ESM was and... saw this.  Thanks.  
---
Lead pipes and garden gnomes if you‚Äôre actively avoiding bags of cement. 
---
did you have the dupe bug effect your base? several of us would login and have all of our items in storage at crazy quantities and had to scrap. 
---
Those demonic shits too.... I miss the days of fo4 where the scariest shit was getting gang banged by a horde of feral ghouls at early levels
---
The first one yes, and maybe if you keep your distance while in caution, if lighting favors you, and you don't use loud weapons. But everything past the first isn't a given.  Not without some extra help from sneaky gear.
---
That is a cool idea. Would also give you something to work towards character wise in the higher levels. I don't know when the last time I actually cared about leveling up was.
---
If he doesn't get back to you in 24 hrs PM me

Addictions pretty much reverse the buffs the drug gave you so for example
---
Addicted to alcohol -1 strength and -1 charisma 
---
i heard that, tactics too, right? I've never played tactics so looking forward to it when i get some time
---
Yes.  Even with the issues it's a terrific game.  
---
But, if crashes and DCs bother you a lot, then wait.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many times someone has killed my Brahmin because they don‚Äôt realize it makes fertilizer 
---
Sure nerf melee, bloodied, instigating, and anti armor as well.
---
Now you need to wash that kill down with some perfectly preserved pie. 
---
No question, it's everywhere,  useful junk are the components you need - the concern is there is nothing meaningful for players because throwing rewards and junk away is widespread.  
---
There are a couple of weapons that are stupidly considered legendary for purposes of loot tables, like the drill. Yes, it's f(*&amp;ing stupid. Sorry about your misfortune.
---
If you remove the perk too fast after using a Radaway (while it's still removing rads, while the effect is still happening ect) it can and will remove mutations. Your safest bet is to never take it off.
---

Good job fixing the lever action reloading, but now the luck of the draw perk still doesn't work. When I first got that perk there was an audible indication that it worked, but after the single play time there is no audible indicator nor does it fix my currently equipped firearm weather I use vats or not.

Another problem that is new is not being able to craft ammo at a work bench even though I have more than enough material to make it in my inventory. It happens about 95% of the time now. 
---
k
---
Lol radscorpions and sentry bots were the bane on my existence at early levels in FO4üòÇ
---
You got a very long wait ahead of you.
---
Easiest place to farm ultricite 
---
From what other posts have said, Nuka Grape can remove the rads without the mutation. There is a soda jerk inside the Whitesprings resort on the main floor that sells them. 
---
Or just always drop crap into an actual container. Suitcase, box, trash can, etc.  They will also persist if you leave the area and come back which bags won't. 
---
Yeah, I found that out. A few hours after I posted that quote from another thread, I had a TwoShot handmade drop. Was like "dammit...someone on reddit just made a fool out of me and I'm spreading false info..." :(
---
That is a weird one. Are you grabbing all the garden gnomes thinking eventually we'll be able to decorate with them? 
---
The power plants etc. have tons of bags of cement, but they weight so much to be looting so many.
---
Because it's an open world.  People are assholes in real life where there often are real consequences, why would they cease to be so in a game where the worst that can happen is you move your CAMP free 'cause someone General Order 24'ed it?
---
Probably the best descriptive analogy I've heard for 76 yet. That explains it perfectly.
---
Lol so it happens.... T.T
---
Honestly I think they have their hands full trying to stamp out duping and trying to stablize the servers and put out so many fires. Like tracking down the people who went in the DEV room etc. Servers are so unstable right now for so many people, I can't imagine a stash increase at this time
---
Cheaters like YOU are the reason this game is unplayable, the infinite camp glitch is C H E A T I N G /s
---
rumors spread because people like to gossip, truth or lies doesnt matter.  
---
their is no evidence this rumor is anything more than bullshit clickbait.
---
Can see why they are pretty bad ass till you have a good weapon and not garbage armour  
---
Its been so long, I couldn‚Äôt remember what they look like 
---
Tbh I‚Äôve had the quest since November 2018 and i still need 2 to complete 
---
Same . Let us build decks and equip as needed . 
---
But I think even that makes it easy to become omnipotent as the player reaches higher levels , so maybe there should be a limit on number of cards a player can have with the option to discard or trade . 
---
In single player Fallout , you have the same risk of being all powerful , but you can at least apply a perk like Logan‚Äôs loophole to cap levels at 30 .
---
This forces you to choose a build and influences how easy or hard a quest is . 
---
I think more active players are - if they haven‚Äôt already - going to run out of challenges , unless Bethesda plans on introducing new content . 
---
I'm not sure what you mean by incredibly limited.  Yesterday I picked up a lvl 15 two-shot 10mm pistol.  It's not useful to me as a lvl 83 mostly melee player.  So I looked on the map and found a guy who could use it.  When I got to where he was he was fighting off mirelurks and supermutants to defend a workshop.  I helped him out, gave him the pistol and some ammo, we talked a about the workshop and the game.  Then we went to a nearby event together and completed it.  He had to go so we said goodbye and went our separate ways.  I enjoy that kind of interaction and don't see the limitations you apparently do.
---
No just some you tuber spreading rumour's, lie's and mis-information for likes and subs.
---
fake news
---
Well, that set can get you about 115% damage reduction so...
---
Sorry, yes QoL=quality of life. traveling pharmacy, through hiker along with maxed class freak and starched genes. I'm rocking 9 mutations right now, so pretty much a must to have those.
---
&gt;ESO went f2p   
---
&gt; still charged 60-120 dollars
---
I don't think F2P means what you think it means. ESO never went F2P. It's B2P with DLC and optional subscription.
---
 Just bulk it and sell it. What is your problem?
---
Datamine points that yes, yes it is. 
---
Surprisingly, nobody found the Hot Rodder paints yet (to not be confused with the Hotter Rod paints. This is that Red X-01 in the pic), so my guess is it'll likely be added in future content or something
---
I'm not saying pvp is going to keep people around, I am simply saying if they were to do it they are eliminating the last of the continuous content in the game. My group and I can have all 3 nukes launched and the queen killed in less the an hour. usually after we do that we start to pick fights with people and pvp....well because we can no longer farm nuke zones. we use to be content with nuking whitesprings and being the people who cycle in and out of the server to get the mobs to spawn again.
---
If we had 8 people from our community farming, we would bring the whole server together at whitesprings and farm the shit out of it for hours. We would enforce to TSE if we were the main controllers and allow everyone to tag all the bombs and once everyone had them tagged we would hammer them down. We can no longer be the big group of nice guys allowing people to farm off of our time and dime. (we would launch the nukes, get everyone to converge on the area, and we would moderate who was using TSE and annihilate them if they stopped anyone from equally farming. 
---
Bethesda turned us into the grievers because they decided to grief us of content.
---
wah wah wah
---
you can't have it all. It's like they made it a game where you had to make choices about what you SPECIALized in.
---
So? Learn to stagger. Its worthless if you stagger someone wearing it
---
Just seems like a waste I gave 20 away last week that were under 50% and over all got about 30 over 50% and I see people complaining about the nerf and I'm stuck with all this. 
---
cap limit is 25000. Takes two weeks and some change of sell runs (200 caps each per 7 vendors) to hit it.
---
My main is sitting at cap, my alt just hit 50 last night. sitting at 3k caps. I buy a mutation at the enclave every couple days since mutation farming inevitably results in herbivore or carnivore, the two mutations I'm avoiding. So far: Marsupial, Speed Demon, Chameleon, and Healing Factor.
---
Clickbait doesn't work if it isn't believable.
---
I've seen fog once and rad storms about 3 times now.
---
Haha yeah (goes back for revenge) ‚Äúhello mr scorpion this is my friend the spray and pray‚Äù üòÇ
---
Build a base somewhere in the Forest, the initial green area you are in, near a water source, like a river or stream.  
---
Grab everything you can, and begin learning how to manage the weight with scrapping at benches.    
---
Learn how to cycle through visits to vendors to sell your excess for CAPS.  
---
Don't stress over "am I doing this right" as you'll be able to fix everything about your build later, over time.  
---
Junk can be BULKED at a Tinker's bench, and sold to vendors.  Some junk, like circuits and silver, etc., can't be bulked, but can be sold, too.  
---
If you're having trouble making money early, grab FLOWERS every time you pass them.  You can make them into food or sell them raw.
---
I feel you, all my special poins for strength (maxed out) are taken up my weight reduction perk cards, and that including some other special points. I can carry 325 pounds max (thanks to deep pocketed armor and plus 40 pounds perk cards) and I can carry around 250 to 275 pounds worth of stuff (weapons, ammunition, food and drinks, etc) at all times but if I take out the weight reduction perk cards that jumps to 450 to 500 pounds and max carry weight of 285.
---
I agree! Everyone I know that bought 76, bought it so they could build and horde. Not spend a third of their time micro managing inventory.
---
I killed it before making friends with it last night. Hop out of the server and back in and it will regenerate there again
---
Yes last time I did Queen I got Lvl 45 Black Powder Rifle what a waste
---
I said that verbatim in the post ha.
---
But like... you can‚Äôt craft with power armor on. So what‚Äôs even the point of that PA helmet mod?
---
I just pop some mentats when crafting
---
B.U.T.T.S  acronym to be announced on the next "inside the vault" 
---
I'm a melee build. Power Armor Level 111 I think. Add me and we'll connect. There are some thing in 76 I found out and want to try them in a team. PSN: R-C-MAN  
---
Have a mic too :) Would be great if you've done the Enclave mission, there is something I want to try.
---
*spoiled
---
Smh
---
I run herd mentality as well so I don't see any drop in int. Also I think class freak reduces it to -1 int, or at least that's what my stats page says.
---
I‚Äôve got my camp to the far side over the river of the whitesprings golfclub for people to use to scrap, sleep , drink or just hide from ghouls. It took me 13 server jumps one day to get it placed down due to the amount of people with turret bases behind the gold club. 
---
(Gt KnowledgeHound on Xbox if anybody wants to come see the camp) 
---
And if you get a snallygaster you're dead? Or at least that's what happened to my husband and I in grafton at level 20..
---
My very first day playing, I had built a cabin in a field near the lumber yard in the Forest, and was later battling (read: getting mauled) by that pack of feral dogs at the Isolated Cabin. A lvl 100- something comes bounding up and helps kill off the dogs. Me, having read the horror stories about other players here gets skittish, but knowing about the pacifist thing, am just overly cautious. I quickly pick through the ruins, all while he watches me. Then he starts doing the follow me emote and bounding off (now i know he was a marsupial.) Cautiously I follow him, slowly realizing he is heading to my cabin (HEKNOWSWHEREISLEEPOHGOD). He bounces inside and I follow, sure he has robbed me, wrecked my shit or set a trap. Instead he gestures to a paper bag full of ammo, stims, water and plans for tea, as well as a plan for a bed and some shelves! Then he bounces off.
---
That was my first experience with a player. Since then, I havent really had much meaningful interactions, except for the time I saw a lower level person getting mobbed by Scorched at Morgantown, and losing, so I started sniping and then charged in with a machete to clear them off the person. They thanked me and then I disappeared into the night.
---
For helping lowbies, I would try putting on a Responder uniform and finding them in-world. They might be less skittish if you are face to face rather than messaging them. And if they are far enough to know who the responders are, they might recognize a friendly.
---
I wouldn't say "most" of the issues have been fixed, however if your a fall out fan then yes get it! 
---
Its no way near as bad as people made out., its actually really good just became a target for click baiters and "notice me senpai" You tuber's.
---
Try get it pre-owned if you can though or on sale though, shouldn't be to difficult :)
---
The fact we're in the countryside makes this even better
---
**DEY TK ER DRS!!** &gt;:(
---
You fucking crybaby millennial fags need to go play another game already. GODDAMN YOU MOTHERFUCKERS COMPLAIN A LOT!!
---
I see the point you're attempting to make, but you've seriously misread how invested I am at this point. I hadn't talked about, or even thought about the game (other than scrolling pas some Youtube videos in my feed about people duping unreleased shit in that Dev room) for weeks. Then I saw someone I follow on Twitter mention the rumor about FO76 going f2p, decided to hop on Reddit and see how this sub had reacted, saw this post, and here we are. 
---
I'm not offended that there are people that don't share my perspective. It doesn't matter whether internet strangers agree with me. I simply shared my opinion, you shared your opinion, and we debated them. That's the extent of it. 
---
&gt; Me. I talk about it because I'm enjoying the game. I'm not the only one clearly. That's a measure of success. More and more I am encountering the world is full message when I try and join my friends in game. More and more seeing new players. Not people with alts. New players. 
---
I don't know if I'd call having more than one person enjoy the game "a measure of success", at least not for a AAA game, but I'm actually glad the game isn't dead, hard as that may be for you to believe. People spent good money on the game, and they deserve to get their money's worth.
---
I don't see how you could possibly differentiate between new players and alt accounts, but I'll just take your word on that. 
---
Yes, this is a fantastic place to set up on the Junk pile, PLUS Sunshine Meadows has its own Junk pile you can farm for junk.  Early on, there's a lot of good, broad range stuff on those piles.
---
Gotcha. I'm trying to figure out how sucky it would be to run a Junky build
---
Hell, it's normal for the old gal to disappear before the loot loads!
---
Ammo be sell able to Vendors...cause I'm totally gonna use all 3000 some .38 rounds with all my guns that don't use it.
---
Sell able plans to vendors. because also gonna use these 7 Water Filter Plans from my frantic hunting for Patrol Duty to get that Handmand Gun Plan.
---
Carryable Small Tent/Sleeping bag, Fire Place and Small Cooking Pot. to many times has food gone bad by the time I either get back to my Camp or found a random one out in the area.
---
I do this but don't get rid of it completely. I usually go by if I have a gross amount of something(like way over 100) I usually bulk and sell all but around 50. That's been a safe number for me to go by. If I need it, it's there. If not, I will just accumulate more and sell it again. 
---
The last 3 times I've killed it, it hasn't dropped me anything
---
Hey was it your SBQ, I mean did you spawn her?  I am laughing to myself thinking about another group getting prepped for battle only to come in and see you with the SBQ already dead.
---
I‚Äôm a pretty big fan of the game itself and the design choices (aside from scorchbeasts combat), it‚Äôs the treatment of the game that‚Äôs got me. The lack of original communication, some of Bethesda‚Äôs PR moves (not the devs fault I know but left a sour taste in my mouth for this game), the glitches which should have been fixed as a post-launch priority but took weeks. 
---
If we're talking about the red/orange mushroom things, I find them all the time within the forest area.
---
There's a few near the location of forest map 8
---
Yeah, the reason that it is being traded there is it's the only viable way to get good end-game gear. I have spent dozens of hours wandering around places where legendary mobs spawn and have spent hours getting either no legendary item or one that is useless.
---
The people have spoken, it's not worth the time grinding to get the gear so people are going to these marketplaces.
---
Considering the West Virginia chapter had no contact with the Oil Rig off of California, no, it couldn't.
---
I say they restrict higher level scaling to "high level areas". Instanced interiors would take away the my favorite activity of helping randoms quest.
---
I've found the the Cannibal perk helps with the food drain from speed demon.
---
I just use marsupial mutation and power armor with calibrated shocks.  I don't carry missiles, or a bunch of fusion cores.  Mini nukes are also a waste of time.  Then managing the chems and other unnecessary ammo is helpful. I like to use my chems as currency when I make my rounds to collect caps.  Because once your character is dialed there's no need for everything. 
---
That's C.A.M.P.'eh.
---
Lolz ranged is fine. Throw some perks into perc/rifleman
---
Tbh I haven‚Äôt seen snally since before the last patch 
---
Haven‚Äôt decided if my alt wants the .50 BMG
---
I see people are downvoting me. Mark my words, once the PvP content will roll out , the forums will CRY because of this.
---
That's what I did too.  I took everything out of each section and wrote down how much was there.  My biggest surprise was that our perk bonuses to decrease weight of food, chems, etc. doesn't apply to our stash.  Then I realized just how much ammo weighs when it doesn't get the weight reduction bonus.  I got rid of a lot of unnecessary ammo after there.  Then I got rid of a lot of stimpacks, radaways, purified waters and canned dog food.  It's hard to let that stuff go!  Now, I have to juggle how much flux, hardened mass, etc to hold onto.  That stuff is heavy.  Even with keeping conservative min/max on crafting mats I still have very little room left to hold onto more than one or two weapons I might want to switch to or other armor types if they later benefit me.  I usually keep my stash between 520-560 but it can be a struggle.

---
Martial artist I thought was for 1h melee attack
---
Isn‚Äôt chainsaw 2?
---
I typically drop or scrap when I find them
---
They are a fun killer for sure. 
---
I heard that the explosive meat trap makes them land. If this is true, that is a game changer. 
---
All we need is a stun, daze, or grounding ability.
---
Why use 9 levels for a 60% boost when you can use 3 levels for a 30% boost? Feels much more efficient.
---
Minmaxing is generally a bad idea in this game, for everything except carry weight oddly enough, so you can simply equip the first level of each rifle perk card and get away with a lot more free points for other perks. I do, however, I totally recommend keeping tank killer at 3, and even getting tormentor in the luck tree for crippling if you're using a higher fire rate weapon
---
I'm running a character with 15 strength, including strong back, bandolier, traveling pharmacist, ordinance express and pack rat. It's honestly unreal how much stuff I can hold in my calibrated shocks power armor. I can't see myself playing any other type of build anymore. 
---
No. Just the rumor flavor of the week. 
---
Yep! 
---
There are faction items, e.g. All Rise. But they are capped at whatever level you are when you do the quest. So for players like me, who played the main storyline first, I had a below max level weapon.
---
Oh, you seen my other post!!
---
There are 2 Fallout 76 player market subreddits you can purchase the serum from.  If you're patient some people sell them for 500 caps. 
---
Pro tip the tesla rifle beam also can ricochet off the ground to tag enemies.
---
it's nice down there they have a buffet and ping pong tables
---
Why not just forge for it or craft it. I view ammo vendors as a last ditch effort.
---
I think honestly everyone is tired of all the crybabies begging for nerfs. Dont like the items in the game? Play a different one. 
---
Or dont pvp, it really is that simple.
---
You might get a glitchy one that attacks.
---
Hey neat :)
---
AH TURK AH DERBS!
---
Nerf nothing.  Just make it so people can elect out of pvp and camp griefing.   
---
After thinking about it I'm pretty sure I saw a Fire Breather inside Lucky Hole Mine.  I'm thinking I found a hat in a locker either there or in another place that I found a dead Fire Breather.  I might have seen one in Glassed Cavern too, but I'm not certain of that.
---
That list actually omits "Luck of the Draw,'  So it may miss others.  
---
Lucky Break may repair your armour, Luck of the Draw may repair your weapon.  They're both Luck perks, believe it or not!!
---
&gt; I don't see how you could possibly differentiate between new players and alt accounts, but I'll just take your word on that.
---
Because I interact with a lot of them. When someone stops to ask you a question about the game, a starter quest or such, they probably aren't an alt. 
---
When they say, yeah, i got it, this is a alt character...
---
If you want the game to succeed, stop trying to rain other others parade. You totally come across as the game is a complete failure. 
---
I'll show you how you are. I said I'm enjoying the game. So are others. 
---
You try and turn that into a minority by saying, I don't know if I'd call having more than one person enjoy the game "a measure of success".
---
You still come across as trying to dismiss something that doesn't match up to what you think about the game. 
---
There' more than a few people enjoying the game. 
---
I agree- this would make them less pointless.
---
Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that's why I poop on company time. 
---
Richard Gere downvoted your comment.
---
&gt;I  part of the thing you get in this game that you don't get any otherFallouts is that you can repeatedly loot an area.
---
What do you mean by that? I'm a little confused because enemy/loot resets/respawns were definitely a feature in Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, (I'm pretty sure NV too). The reset times were a little weird (depended on game cell), but they definitely existed in the earlier games.
---
Yes. Tactics too. 
---
I'm a thick cunt
---
I love helping others out! I just hate how higher leveled players (me being lvl 138) are all starting to get bad rep's because of a few bored people. I can't count the amount of lower level'd players that book it the second they see me, and all I'm trying to do is drop off food, meds, and any random legendary gear they might be able to use!
---
hell I had 3 hours left and fast traveled to my camp and it was gone.
---
Which sucked because I had a challenge to complete a quest while having a disease at the time.
---
Good eye, I haven't used the list in a while, guess they didn't update it. I use luck of the draw regularly!
---
So how would you prevent folks from stealing PA while it‚Äôs stored on mannequins much less PA repair station?
---
I thought eso you only had to buy dlcs?
---
Yeah i start outside kill everything (usually a legendary around back) slow walk overencumbered in through back door theres a tinkers bench. After clearing that i can usually pop ammosmith and super make some ammo, then continue clearing out building since upstairs has a chemistry bench to break down annything else i find.
---
&gt; Lol at all these posts
---
Proceeds to make another post about it....
---
To play devils advocate--HAVE they had much time to verify that the server stability isn't impacted? Sure, they've had time--but its been time riddled with duping and other exploits that actively slow down or crash servers. I imagine they'd need stable servers to *start* with to better test the 200 stash size increase.
---
Seems like the bugs / exploits causing these issues need to take priority over QOL changes.
---
What system? On my main I can mod them to whatever you need btw. 
---
Which, you can't do in PA.
---
Internal database is the most useless mod in the game.
---
I once seen a tse lever on the rare responder vendors, was surprising, to say the least.
---
There's no way it's a database problem. That never made sense, and the people I've seen spreading the rumor had no idea what they were talking about.
---
It's about them trying to "balance" the "gameplay" or whatever, like I should care what anyone else does with their stash.
---
They remind me of the Witches from Left 4 Dead except with zero chill. Attacks are like a Ghoul except they can crawl a lot faster and don‚Äôt fall over as frequently as Ghouls do. 
---
Lol nice 
---
Overall stats in the inventory don't change. I also got a similiar left leg armor, and in this case the stats do change. It also shows the radiation resistance in the item description. Here you can have a look: [https://imgur.com/a/VHTzlqs](https://imgur.com/a/VHTzlqs).
---
that's the joke :)
---
Read the enclave one you posted, it sounds more like challenges to do to earn atoms just like the one we had where we had to wear a hat

How long has it been like this?

Im on ps4, but I havent heard much about stutter issues on the base consoles.

Maybe we can help you resolve your connection issue.
---
Can confirm that the Nuka Cola paint thing works. Took a little more than 20 minutes, but that‚Äôs because my son and I stopped a lot to shoot things in the face. (Father-son bonding at its best!)
---
There has been a big reduction since the last update. I played one day for several hours on XBox without a crash or disconnect. Part of it is knowing that when there is a frame drop then you slow down and give it time to process. When you load in anywhere give it 30 seconds before you move and you'll be fine
---
Until you want to kill a scorchbeast queen.
---
10k atoms would not be enough and i'd be pretty pissed. Even more so that I  pre ordered this game and hardly play it anymore because there is no endgame and they aren't fixing things at a decent rate.
---
They are adding even more PvP content.
---
Yep. I was nearing the Whitesprings fountain to cure one last night that I know had 2.5h on it just end randomly. 
---
Not complaining, they're a burden. 
---
How do others combat the -50% Disease Resistance when taking Rad-Away? Just stick with Rad Shield?
---
Except they can have multiple characters / accounts for storage. This only slows them down, doesn't do anything to tamp duping itself.
---
Omfg... Hahahahahahah I am really sorry to all the brahmin i have killed out their. Do they respawn or how do you get an animal btw? 
---
Yeah, I don't understand it either.   It seems like a waste of the strength category.  Because you realistically, one is limited to using only weight reduction perks...and not much else.
---
How though? I can only see two options; either one person has ownership (just like with regular camps), or noone has ownership and it's just persistant on that server.
---
I suppose if we had persistant private/clan-servers it could work though.
---
1: Build your base whenever you feel like it and add on as you discover more plans and as you level.
---
2:If you want to avoid pvp go into your settings and enable pacifist mode, It will allowing you to shoot freely and not initiate pvp that is including becoming wanted from accidently shooting peoples bases while shoot enemies, But be aware that turning on pacifist mode means that you will not be able to defend yourself against other people who want to kill you. players can still do dmg to you but you can't to them.
---
3:It is possible to build a makeshift shop using your mats in any location. It wont be really a shop pre say but you will be able to role play a shop and sale to people.
---
4: It is very possible for you base to be destroyed by anyone and anything, so be carful. if someone is trying to destroy your base just swap servers quickly before they destroy you base. but simply moving your base and replacing it back down will restore it back to new with out using resources but at the price of caps.
---
5: if you log into a server where there is a base at your locations simply hop servers again until your base is set back down. it is part of the games system or you can simply move it for free.
---
6. Junk should always be stored into your stash at any given moment because if someone kills you and or something you will lose all junk. you have a chance to pick it back up after death but if a player is in the area they will most definitely steal your junk.

Ill hit you up my gt is NightTerror2031
---
So the same
---
Go tell them not to nerf TSE then so it can balance it out
---
Was very tempted to nuke it again from another silo
---
It triggers on legendaries but it has a %chance per hit. Since the buzz blade is a continuous hit almost its gonna proc more than a gun 
---
Yeah but it's a different kind of post about how it won't go f2p. Can see how you're getting tired of reading them because you started commenting. Thanks for the convo tho mang
---
I have it and it does trigger for my legendary LAR, but the damage it repairs is pretty negligible. You're better off investing the point in another Luck perk. 
---
I do think it's ridiculous that deep pocket carry weight is negated while in power armor. If Tony Stark put spaghetti in his jean pockets and then stepped into his Ironman suit, he's still able to carry the spaghetti,though he may have to step out of it when ue wanted to eat some. 
---
They exist? I thought it was just bethesda trolling.... well tbh i figure the whole game is one big troll 
---
This is my build. Like you, I'm a stealth rifle build. I'm on the hunt for Chameleon gear at the moment. I have 2, left arm and left leg. They stack 20% each for stealth. My rifle is also a 2 shot explosive, 400 damage, so sneaking it does 1000. I have a few mutations too. Healing factor, Marsupial, Talons, Chameleon, Electrically Charged, Carnivore, Scaly Skin. Of these, I've only bought 2. Scaly Skin and Electrically Charged. Next to buy is Speed Demon, then I'm done. I also have a few deep pocketed gear. If I'm scrounging I use the Excavator, carry weight is good. 380. Without is 240.

---
Yeah, they're all challenges similar to Daily/Weekly challenges, as well as more normal challenges. It's just interesting that they have factions tied to them.
---
I saw the first one this morning, and i was like ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù  Then i thought to myself how long it would take for these posts to pop up.  Well not long at all...  lol
---
Spoilt is the past and past participle of "spoil" in British English. The spelling and usage are proper. Please try to make sure you are correct before you correct someone.
---
Probably be back on in 20 mins just taking a break üëçüòã
---
Ya hit me up, I have pretty much everything I need. Maybe some X-01 Calibrated shocks would be nice. If you don't have them that's fine but always looking to help. PSN: R-C-MAN
---
I wish to upvote this many times.
---
Oh shit, you better read the article before linking it.
---
Came here to post that... then I read the damn thing... Somehow its so much worse then the troll spam.
---
I‚Äôm looking for that jacket, do you remember where you found it?
---
Fake news. Not happening... *sighs* wish this rumour would die already 
---
Hahahhahahaha
---
Lmao-
---
I may have skimmed over some parts üëÄüí¶ 
---
The part about that games should not dictate a person emotional reaction is true.
---
But is seems to me you are forgetting a lot of people don't have that much control over their emotions. 
---
That you can do that is maybe more something you are good at. And that others are less skilled is normal.
---
Best I can do in English. Hope you can understand it.... lol
---
As much as I agree that the STASH could be bigger, I don't think unilaterally declaring Bethesda has had enough time to work on it is a particularly good avenue of thought to pursue. As someone who also has trouble with inventory management I do feel your pain, but it's very unwise to just assume you know enough about all the intricacies of the development process to say that Bethesda has just decided to ignore the issue 
---
I consider using alternate characters to get around the in game mechanic of a limited amount of storage space an exploit, not a different play style. That may be a minority opinion but again, just my 2 cents.
---
My mistake on the inside the vault comment.
---
If I rememver rightly there are 2 that spawn in the basement of the building you go to for the fertile soil event.
---
This post was clearly made to refute the others.
---
Oh nice. Thanks for the tip.
---
Thats great, but is "pack mule" really an interesting role choice? :p
---
Thank-you! Forgot about that one. Been a long time since I've entered that place.
---
I wouldn't say big reduction.
---
Yeah, I may well change.  It was a great perk when I was a lower level, but it's not a big deal now I get outlandish amounts of mats and outgun most enemies.
---
Thanks for responding.
---
It'd be a kick in the nuts if it did, saying that I paid ¬£10, so not that arsed....
---
This would be so great. I made my way to Watoga cause the map showed no one their. It was going well till a couple of high levels showed up. One came over and helped me out, gave me a bunch of plans and jetted. After that I was able to start the mayor for a day quest but it took me forever taking down level 60 plus enemies.
---
My 3rd character has 1 in str. I do not use any reduction to food/weapon/ammo etc. Use few weapons, max 1000 ammo. Max 10 stim. Max 10 food/water. Works ok. If I want to pick up a lot, I use exevator power armor with x2 shocks.
---
Some people make them for materials... 
---
My stash is constantly full and I'm always encumbered. I'm at lvl 45 right now. Hope it gets better later.
---
I mean, they wouldn't be pulled out of anything. It'd be their choice to respond.
---
And I mean, is it any worse than randomly discovering your CAmP has been demolished?
---
Any works. 
---
They should make a backpack slot. This is a mod in F4, and it's a great experience.  
---
Make backpacks unwearable in power armor.
---
Make it add to carry weight, or reduce non-equipped item weight by a percentage.
---
Maybe if the item is favorited/hotkeyed, it doesn't get the weight reduction, mimicking the need to actually go through the menu (backpack) to find the item.
---
Perhaps as a drawback, it decreases your agility by a certain amount as well.
---
Just saying. If Marie Kondo is helping you managing your stash. ‚ÄúDoes these bulk [insert junk component name] sparks joy?‚Äù 
---
No u rite. Just looked. Still though, idk what Bethesda would get out of going f2p since the game is already b2p. They would just lose money at that point, ha 
---
Bruh, i get rippers with instigating, got 3 so far lol
---
Great idea.
---
If you think of perks as optional, and to cover the stuff you hate the most.
---
Hate dealing with food / water? There is a perk for that.
---
Hate having to manage carry weight, there are perks for that.
---
Hate needing to heal after fights? There are perks for that.
---
I had it weeks ago and lost it, now I keep  poisoning myself to try to get it back. So far no luck.  
---
Its called scaling, it allows people to be able to solo her or do it as a group.
---
The low levels hiding out is what punishes you, if everyone is doing what they are supposed to its an easy ish battle.
---
it didn't even go after mine!
---
You mean fembot?
---
I was on my way to retrieve my junk and I got disconnected. Thank you Bethesda, I lost a lot of caps there!
---
Fuck, I forgot how much im missing on the map. Must. Play. More.
---
I‚Äôd like miner gauntlets included with powerfist as well
---
Eat your left nut just for regurgitating this tired shit and giving it traction.
---
Agreed, though most of the helmet mods aren't really that impactful as is. Sensor Array and Vats Matrix are small but somewhat useful buffs to the right builds, and Targeting Hud and Recon Sensors have a situationally useful effect. 
---
OD‚Äôd on jet if I had to guess. 
---
Plastic is the only item I have marked. I bulk everything
---
Notable locations: cigarette cartons (enclave military wing desks), hairbrushes (whitesprings barbershop shelf, whitesprings spa on the tray behind the wall), nuka cola cup stacks (whitespring theater) shopping baskets (whitespring medical shop, toy shop, and cooking shop), there's also a basket of golfballs in the bus at the goul farming area when you port to the golf club. A couple life preservers by the pool on the other side of the safe spot wall.
---
Flatwood hotel usually has a hairbrush upstairs, an enamel bucket by the stairs, a stack of life preservers along with the one by the pool. In the flatwood town I grab up the pool cues from the empaled body
---
Hopefully this saves you some time. 
---
I should really make part of my run, trips to fort defiance to load up on ballistic fiber and the plastic available there as well.
---
Sure that's all fine. But it's not why I cut that part out. I did so to refocus my original post to better get my point across. That is all.  I didn't want the comments to be about Yongyea. To me, that's like giving Donald Trump attention. 
---
I find it odd that I never really noticed this and find myself trying to remember if any of the robots have had a male voice that gave a quest and seem to be unable to think of any.  Well played, Bethesda, well played.
---
You know. That's a good point. I certainly taught myself not to get worked up over stuff like this. 
---
Mostly because when I saw someone like this, all I could think was, they sure are making themselves miserable over something they want to enjoy because of something they can't control. Meaning, mistakes. Everything man makes is filled with mistakes. It's our nature. 
---
grafton mayor doesnt come off as female. I think the enclave quest giver is suppost to be male as well.  
---
I never really gave it much thought....
---
" I dont need a fucking scribe to tell me that"
---
There are no measures in place, or any design philosophy, to remove the danger of PvP for people who do not want to engage in it. If you want zero PvP, buy a PvE game.
---
Beautiful camp! Very well done and definitely looks cozy! 10/10 would visit
---
I didn't know that nerfing an a single weapon mod made the entire gun using portion of the game unplayable. 
---
Not to mention , that while you all need to learn that Nerfs happen, so do buffs, I'd imagine we will see some more weapon balancing in the near future.
---
Still perpetuates and refers to an unsubstantiated rumor. Rule 7 of the sub. Seeing how it was already removed, I don't think I'm the only one seeing it as no different than any other post about it.
---
It's a pain but it's the easiest consistent source of steel you can get without "farming" it. Just make sure you're hitting workbenches often enough to scrap it. 
---
I've got the serum on Xbox if you want? 
---
Wait... does a serum do it forever?..
---
Jet hasn't been invented yet ü§î
---
I always make note in my beta applications that I have successfully done this in the past and always want to try during the beta to see if I can find anything. Never trying to exploit, just a fan of using vanilla game mechanics to get to where I'm not supposed to be.
---
YOu going to be on for a while? If so I can either make you some to scrap or mod it for you. I am eating lunch right now so maybe 15-20 minutes until I am on. 
---
GT is MrEMar
---
Refute with what? I don't see any official statement in this post, just more useless speculation.
---
This is the justice i love to see.  Lol
---
2 things to note. Without Starched Genes, Rad Away WILL remove it. Also Rad-X, don't use it. It suppresses your mutations, making them useless.
---
Before the update I couldn't play more than 20 mins without a crash or disconnect so it's a very big reduction for me if I can play a few hours without one.
---
I wish you nerd mongers would have you ability to post stupid bullshit on Reddit nerfed. 
---
This makes me feel a little bit better, albeit in a lousy way.  I lost a favorite switchblade just the other day.  I assumed that I'd been careless and sold it, and have been beating myself up for it.  And maybe that's actually what happened.  Or maybe I got hit with this same glitch.
---
&gt;You seem angry
---
Oh trust me, you'd know if I was pissed. 
---
&gt;Skyrim had a main story 4 different factions with radiant quests that led to bigger quests within the factions, 13 daedric quests, multiple unique city quests (forswarn prison mission, wolf queen) civil war quest which were kinda the same but added unique fun gameplay, on top of becoming a wolf or vampire dragon shouts to seek out and interesting dungeons to explore. All of this ontop of the amazing map (black reach) offered and vastly different characters that you could create with races.
---
What do you do once you finish all of that though? 
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt give me ‚Äúroses tinted‚Äù glasses shit I like fallout76 but any Bethesda game lasted me more than 2 months.
---
That sounds like a personal problem, then. 
---
&gt;why do you think ppl dupe and troll others there‚Äôs not shit else to do.
---
Because you have an entire fanbase that has thrown a shitfit after shitfit without giving Bethesda a real actual chance to make up for it and so people have decided to "Stick it to the man". 
---
I have a mod that somewhat helps. I don't think it factors that in when sorting, but it shows the combined weight of all the tabs like Weapons, Apparel, Aid, etc. I never realized it was my Aid that took up all my weight.
---
You don't have to defeat it, you can run away or even die.  Also you can travel to death claw island and do it there.
---
don't have the plan yet...but the button doesn't work?...wow Bethesda..
---
it's literally the same item from FO4...but there they got it right and the button working...
---
I took advice from some other players around here that said : dont keep junk because you dont need it. Now i need to repair my power armor+weapons and have to find 150 springs.That will take a full week.Thanks
---
Exactly! 
---
Strong urge to loot a üìã while at lunch today
---
Danse off on the Prydwen poop deck at noon.
---
It does trigger off everything except Grognacks Axe. Not worth it though.
---
Wait, the Whitesprings fountain cures diseases? Most of the time I just ride out the affliction unless it‚Äôs the kind that increases hunger and thirst. 
---
Huh, well now I know, thanks for the info. Now I just have yet to earn a legendary from an eventüëçüèΩ
---
It's hard when you'll all mindlessly suggesting and agreeing on impulsive ideas. I'm going to tell it to you straight. This is a waste of everyone's time. Rather than making suggestions to end game content or improving the current experience while maintaining game balance, you're insisting a useless feature that will lead to a path of complexity just to get it to work. The closest thing to this that would be plausible would be a pre-built settlement that allows you to claim a home and have the home be an instance so you don't have to worry about anyone having your home on the same server.
---
If you‚Äôre lucky you can get even lower!
---
So is the big game hunt at that lodge.
---
This is also how I feel about the game, and I actually like it. I like that I can do whatever I want with my perks and sometimes I want to just be able to carry infinite stuff because I absolutely don‚Äôt need max damage on a random supply run. 
---
Yep, and pressing ALT + F4 gives you infinite carry weight. Tested. Legit. 
---
Yeah but weren't they using mods to do that? Plus I'm more into escaping the map boundaries than getting into forbidden rooms.
---
Idea really I like, this.
---
Probably so they can turn around and reward it to some sucker doing a daily quest for them.
---
yeah, i just sell all my rad-x.
---
what i haven't tested, is whether or not radsheild suppresses mutations as well.
---
Damn, it's still a problem? Personally taking a small break 'n' giving the devs time to fix the game :)
---
That you have to OPT INTO.
---
If you don't want to join the PVP server then simply don't join.
---
I don't even PVP so I can care less but c'mon bud. It's not being forced on you w the new PVP servers. 
---
I know man but who backs down from a fight like that? Also around 670exp?ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è also I think it still counts if you die 
---
Bandolier is bad unless you are carrying 15k rounds of ammo. Which I don‚Äôt even do on my HW dude. Most ammo is pretty damn light, PackRat usually has a bigger effect for the points. Try taking off bandolier and seeing how much your weight changes. 
---
The really heavy ammos fall under Batteries Included and .. ordinance express
---
Any mutation you get(regardless of source) can be removed without having that perk equipped, hence the mutation build requires you to have that perk and the one that reduces negative effects to make it a positive build.. having every mutation except for empath leaves you with only positive effects, you lost 2 strength but get back 2 of every stat with herd mentality provided you're in a group, 3 if you use strange in numbers.. you lost agility and intelligence but get back far more with 2 different mutations..
---
So basically using 5 points in luck and 1 point in charisma makes having almost every mutation very beneficial! But at the cost of 6 points of your overall build.
---
I have three to go also. Did you find them around the club or out on the greens?
---
It‚Äôs pretty surprising how many quest markers some people leave on.  How does it not stress them out? 
---
Thanks for posting this. I‚Äôve been wanting to load up on disease cures but I wasn‚Äôt sure where to farm the fire caps. 
---
No sleep till you get that slice of pie with the claw. That is the true final boss.
---
Yup I‚Äôll be on for an hour or so. Message me when you‚Äôre free.
---
Ran into this issue earlier.  I had to run across the rail to reach the area.  Found a nice alien eating a Deathclaw egg.  https://imgur.com/a/WIPBOAJ
---
couldn't they use the fallout 4 app as a template.. im sure theres not too much which needs to be tweaked? I still have my pip boy from Fallout 4... Really really want to use it!
---
was doing some digging since my earlier comment.  RadAway can randomly remove even serum mutations.
---
If you equip Starched Genes though, nothing can remove your mutation.
---
So to keep mutations, you must have 2 points in luck for Starched Genes.
---
IMO this should only ever happen once to a player. If twice, the problem is you.  I wouldn't like something that potentially makes the loading even longer then it is because people log off in common blast zones.
---
ah and the 2 of the 3 daily bots in camden park, as well as the boss bot. and the shooting range bot.
---
The weight reduction cards are driving me nuts. I have to have most of my points in strength when I'm a shotgun/rifle user.
---
The issue is the stash limit. Yes they gave us more but...I mean come on...600 isn't enough. I know we can't have unlimited here but we're all used to hording stuff in Fallout right? We need more storage.
---
I'd actually like different storage for different items. Like a first aid box for chems, a fridge for food and drinks...so on and so forth. And give those containers different weight limits. Like your armor and gun storage should be higher weight limit then your chems.
---
What level?  I'll take it if you still have it and are on tonight.
---
Connect it with a switch.
---
I would even like something along the lines of different storage containers.
---
Maybe an ammo crate that can only hold ammo and has ~ 50 weight limit.
---
Another option would be to have non-secured storage. E.g. your Stash box is 100% safe, but if you store stuff in an ammo crate/wall safe/etc. (separate from the stash box storage of course) it can be broken into and stolen.
---
Breaking down ammo like we can do in Fallout New Vegas would work better imo. 
---
I saw the plan at Watoga BoS Vendor Phoenix.
---
Can confirm
---
I'm most impressed that you recognize the equipment
---
Ore is player-instanced loot so it can't be farmed out. cans/pencils/stuff laying around may potentially be picked over already. That's why mining is more effective.
---
Also to note. Class Freak rank 3, reduces the negative effects of mutations by 75%.
---
There is no point. Heavy BOS combat armor without legendaries is more than adaquate in the end game. Mutations, legendary armor are all over the top. As for legendary weapons, well I don't know. But there is no end game worth doing. 
---
The only thing worth doing would be to play through without legendaries, or to play through and read all the terminal entries and notes outloud which i've found recently is quite an enjoyable thing to do in short bursts.
---
There is no challenging end game. I made a post about this called "Hell on Earth" about making nuked zones more challenging a couple days ago
---
Wow. That was quite impressive. The crit/VATS damage was pretty insane.
---
I have the same problem. I assume it would place correctly if I literally assembled my house around it but I don't want to do that so I can a decon shower in the middle of my upper room.
---
Her base lvl ie 65/80/90 that she spawns at is based on the person that spawns her first @ fissure prime.
---
Her HP or hitpoints scale to the amount of people in the vicinity.
---
I have dropped a lvl 90 SBQ with less than 5 people faster than a lvl 60 SBQ with 10-15 people.
---
It seems once you have more than 10 ppl your chance for a no kill increases dramatically.
---
Ok, I didn‚Äôt know but now that you mention it I don‚Äôt remember seeing it in the game. 
---
You can still doze but to an extent, like no huge trees or rocks.
---
But yeah if bethesda enhanced dozing it could totally work 
---
The only issue would be spawn locations semi demolished houses that spawn gear 
---
Well, if you're outside of power armor, find armor pieces that reduce the weight of whatever is the issue the most. I run two pieces that reduce the weight of weapons by 20% each, one that reduces the weight of food/drink/chems by 20%, 1 reduces junk weight, etc. You've got 0 excuse to have a weight problem besides you not maximizing all the different ways to reduce your weight outside of perks.
---
Hell, if food/chems/drinks are all you're concerned about get 5 pieces that reduce the weight and they literally all weigh 0.
---
You've obviously gotta look deeper into all the different builds and options before you start using Reddit to complain about an issue that really isn't an issue.
---
Forest,  by the slocums Joe down the road from the overseers camp 
---
Are you assuming the robots gender?
---
How dare you!
---
;) 
---
BETHESDA I DON'T LIKE PVP SO TAKE IT OUT COMPLETELY FOR THAT SOLE REASON!!!
---
Seriously though; no.
---
That's not a solution.
---
&gt;Somewhat making my point -- it very rarely happens organically because of limitations.
---
Human interaction is always a choice. Not something that just happens organically. Trust me. I live in NY. Riding the subway teaches you that it's always a choice to engage or not.
---
That guy got something, and decided to act on it, and found someone and *created a moment* in the game that would never happen with just coding. 
---
That's exactly the kind of thing I'm talking about. Yes it happens in other online games. But this game seems to want to make that more of a feature of the game, then a byproduct. 
---
And I think that has great possibilities. 
---
Yeah man raising it continuously is a slippery slope. It‚Äôll go to 800 then when people fill that they will ask for 1,000 and so on. I like where it‚Äôs at now. If anything, maybe add perks that decrease stash items weight by 10%? Idk if that‚Äôs possible 
---
Nice, thanks. I have lots of lvl ups, I can swing that card umm sure. I had no idea serums were perm. So nice.
---
It's a man, innit?
---
I like the idea of CAMP player vendor machine! Maybe I can buy a Two Shot Handrifle!
---
I guess it's better just to be naked in your power armor then
---
If you're on console it bugs out sometimes. On xbox you can invite to game via your friends list. 
---
Takes like 5 minutes for her loot to load for me the past two times. 
---
I could see them adding special slots when they release major DLC and new perks but adding 25 is insane overkill. Like maybe add 2-3 slots per DLC but not to exceed 60 total.
---
My camp is at the pond below the billboard directly north of Point Pleasant on top of the mountain, guaranteed Firecap Spawn x2-3 growing on a lot right before you get up the hill to the pond. 
---
Total opposite. I only use guns. You dont need lead just sitting there in large amounts craft it out to ammo and carry it 1. Because you then cant drop it if killed carrying it on you or taking up inventory and 2 run bandolier and the ammo weighs nothing. I have a total of 25k ammo, 4 different types i always carry on me.
---
And I've found him in the Cranberry Bog. Do not attack him there. He can take control of animals and machines and have them attack you for him. In a nuke zone, it's crazy. 
---
It took them a month to correct fusion core production from .80 to 8.0 per hour and that was just a decimal place change for an obvious error. A stash change would be nice but Bethesda isn't exactly on the ball for QoL patch fixes right now. 
---
They've done some quality patches but I think they're a bit overwhelmed right now and the stash change might have unintended consequences they just can't handle at the moment.
---
That‚Äôs awesome ... make sure you get at least one shot in on the bad guys when you are with the high level guys so you get the XP ... good way to level your player quickly ... I always wait for lower level players to tag before I start slaughtering!
---
I use the [Better Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) mod, and I can safely say that 40% of my weight is ammo/fusion cores, 30% is Aid, and the rest is spread across armor, weapons, and junk.
---
I think the MG42 is definitely faster than the .50 cal
---
and sunkissed 2 will get rid of rads quickly without using a radaway so you can keep two slots open in Luck not having to equip Starched Genes
---
I mean, you're trying to have best of both worlds with a max damage and easiest carry and actively choosing not to go PA on top of it and adding double mutations. 
---
I mean, yeah, you're going to have to balance out something so you have to prioritize what's most important and not try to be all things at once. Go through every perk, then watch yourself playing, if you're not using a perk in a couple of days playthrough then pull it, and also make sure all the situational perks aren't taking up a permanent spot in your perk roster like crafting perks, skill perks (lockpick, etc) and also remember that you can hot swap some of the sneak perks to and only use while sneaking. If you're on console this will take a few extra seconds, if on PC you can set perk loadouts really easy. 
---
Are you crashing in blast zones out of your power armor/Hazmat suit often? It shouldn't be happening that often, buddy.
---
I had one once. Scrapped it soon after. What exactly does it actually kill? I couldn‚Äôt find a use for this gun did no damage to anything 
---
The hero the world needs ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
yes.
---
Also get a Tesla rifle as soon as you can ... you can tag multiple enemies in a trash mob with one shot
---
I currently have the Marsupial mutation and love it. It saved me a few times jumping away from enemies. 
---
Yep, the one under the gazebo just Northeast of the Golf Club/Tennis Courts. 
---
I'm generally too lazy to go harvest mats for disease cure so I make the rounds to that fountain relatively frequently. That and the decon shower in the Enclave just cause. 
---
That and you may find a spawned Deathclaw/Yao Guai/Glowing Wolves right in that section. Had a 3\* Deathclaw there I had just about killed when the server went down for maintenance...sad moment. 
---
Is there a limit to how many times you do that?
---
Still a good idea, however impractical
---
Yep, I've that and photosynthetic maxed out.
---
I like it! Its simple, easy to understand/implement and gives people something to work on!
---
Create a new toon with a specific build. And no cheating by having your main gift it.
---
There are a lot of passive perks that are just tiring to load and unload.  We need a better system.
---
7 legs, 200 limit, 45-60 minutes, excluding prerequisite questing time and leveling time to max on perks for "sell" missions.  And the fact that rewards, not junk are routinely thrown on the ground.  That's a symptom of a problem. 
---
This is another good tip, but I think it's still supplementary to farming runs. The volume you get just doesn't compare unless you are hanging out at camp all the time.
---
The trick is finding a good spot. I've tried a couple. One was occupied about 50% of the time I'd log on (which led to mass duplication of stored camp items). Funny though, I could never find another camp near there anywhere. Found another "good" spot that turned out to have consistent scorch beast spawns within a minute or two whenever I was there. Never even got a chance to even build it up.
---
The hero we need
---
Did you find it out? I still looking for it. Otherwise I'll just drop it in the floor
---
mine is, but I shouldn't really need to do the work for the team when it comes to these electronic items. there's a useless button built into the shower and don't even get me started on what a mess garage doors are.

Can confirm, it's also broken for me on PS4. So far I've picked up some Bloodleafs, Soot Flowers, Rhododendrons, and Wild Carrot Flowers yet all four of them still say 0/10 for the weekly challenge. The best part is that the patch notes from Jan 10 include this:
---
&gt;Daily Challenges: Fixed several daily challenges that were not being offered on some days. Dev Note: These include ‚ÄúPick Wild Flowers‚Äù, ‚ÄúHarvest Mutfruit Plants‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHarvest Wild Plants and Fungi‚Äù.
---
Guess they forgot to fix the Weekly Challenge version...
---
Yep.  There are some builds that can just run light.  Others of us, well, we need mats!!!
---
I shot him and he vanished.
---
I alternate between camping on lead deposits and steel deposits. Currently the latter, but I'm walking distance from Lucky Hole so it works out.
---
I've used that before. pretty sure if you place it right there's a resource someplace near there 
---
I had trouble until I switched to Rhododendrons...which are super plentiful at Whitesprings...
---
It shall be underarmor. Why can‚Äôt I put my combat armor over hazmat? :)
---
Maybe _just_ the stuff you mentioned there add up to 70 pounds, but then you need a few weapons (main &amp; backup), armour, ammo, PA itself is 10 pounds. Average 15 pounds per weapon, minimum 7 pounds for chest armour, 5 for every other piece and you're up to around 150 pounds. Still under the weight limit, but if you ever want to pick up a few weapons to scrap for plans you'll soon be walking everywhere. And that's not even mentioning junk, which you'll need in order to repair your stuff. 
---
Also, if you don't want to run the above like I do, you'll have to store the armour and weapons in your stash. But wait - STASH is full! Your spare weapons, armour, stimpaks and ammo you stashed there are now at their original weight because perk cards relating to weight only apply to stuff in your inventory. 
---
Didn't mean this as an attack on you or anything, just needed to vent. Making the switch from unlimited stash space in FO4 to a pitiful 600 is like a hoarder going to live in a shed with only a shoebox for storage.
---
Inventory Management: The Game
---
Also, 5mm rounds with bandolier rank 2 has no weight whatsoever. My sidearm is a gatling gun, having 10k rounds for it doesn¬¥t hurt. lol
---
Farming the loot cave golf club isn't exactly skilled game play either.
---
Then you have to like afk in a shed or something until she lands so you can delete her.
---
Drink Whisky. Take drugs. Farm for Radstags (Radstag Steaks add 20 usually). Otherwise Pocketed is solid depending on your build. And like others have said, Marsupial is the shit!
---
I agree- I scrapped my T-51 when I switched to T-60 and have huge regret 
---
I could link the Twitter response from EB Aus saying they're not taking down FO76. Which was the original evidence that it would go f2p, ha
---
That makes me super sad because, unless the rights for the full-length movements are expensive, i feel like the full length movements add to the immersion of exploring. I get lost in my exploring when listening to the classical station. I just dont get that same sense of ‚Äúlost with a purpose‚Äù when listening to appalachia radio. Plus the songs on that station are so repetitive; hence why I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm getting every song in the game on the playlist 
---
It does get hard to tell doesn‚Äôt ... I really like for just pouring lead into something hard to kill like scorched beasts ... I think I may build another with a zealots receiver just for that!!
---
There's a thing, an it, and some stuff.
---
Really though, i saw an new ceiling light, the atom burst kind from previous game. A greek column, a bed skin shaped like a princess bed, which i don't know why wasn't with the kids stuff when it came out. 
---
A new photopose called flashlight which is confusing people that bought it. Some new icons. 
---
Nothing stellar. 
---
Still waiting for the fez hat that someone datamined. 
---
Isnt this level skip on sega's Aladdin?
---
Just keep at it, you'll get one eventually. Don't expect much though. I'm pretty sure all of the one's that I've gotten from completing events have only been 1 star. You'd still be better off farmin other events like AWOL Armaments in the Mire/Cranberry Bog border and Uranium Fever in the Savage Divide. Those two have legendaries that are guaranteed spawns. Same with One Night of Violence.
---
Lvl 50 with reflex sight drum mag muzzle brake it has the explosive perk 
---
Did not know that!!  Good to know!!!
---
We need more weapon skins
---
I'm not saying they need a permanent solution, but they should have enough info by now to tell us they can or can't do another straight increase.  There's for sure a lot of work that will be needed to make any actual operational changes.
---
Building on this 24 slot idea, factions.
---
DLC where we can join factions, each faction has a player town zone.  Number of zones would be 24/total factions.
---
This way you can log in and you have a faction town slot.  If faction is full, you get a message to join another server.
---
Oh?
---
You get a bounty for stealing workshops anymore as your forced to break things to contest the workshop ü§¶
---
The game just has too many limiters and yet still says it wants you to feel unique and powerful by the endgame. Bethesda should give you more ways to customize your build, and no perk points should be used for the sole purpose of carrying more stuff. That isn't an exciting gameplay mechanic like having larger explosions or crippling an enemy with a rifle. Give us perk cards that are only for enhancing gameplay and either attach 'carry perks' to cards or give us backpacks as equipable gear that allow for a realistic and meaningful way to carry more. There are probably hundreds of ways to make carry weight balanced without being over bearing and taking away from what actually makes the game fun (perks!).
---
Where is that stuff carried anyways?  You obviously don't have a rocket launcher in your pocket. 
---
You have to have a friend you trust.  You give them the stuff in a pre-arranged place, and then log out to log in as your alt.  They give it back to the alt.
---
Can‚Äôt stand people like you‚Ä¶ seriously, what do you want!? You‚Äôll only complain about the next thing. Did you think you‚Äôd be able to just constantly push your SPECIAL up? 
---
I'm on xbox my gamertag is MergedSpy93289 what is your xbox gamertag?
---
yeah, same, perk cards is a bad system.
---
And honestly, after playing this game til about level 40, i just think it's a bad game in general.
---
Or just balance it based on the average level in that area.  If you're level 1 and a level 50 comes near you, only level 25 spawn.  With the exception of nuked zones.
---
its nice but that does take perk points I kind of wish we had 5 general use non combat perk points we can spend 
---
You answered your own question.  People should not be forced into wearing it through most of the game.  Some of would just rather not, regardless. It shouldn't be so carry weight centric.
---
This has honestly never been a problem for me, and I craft/use a ton of ammo. I just pick up abraxo or whatever stuff has acid in it whenever I see it. Have never really had to farm it ever. Basically there's plenty around in the world if you need it.
---
This is a good tip b/c there are people who will destroy your camp if you do setup camp there. 
---
I crash everywhere. Loaded back in last night to death at whitesprings. Wasn't in power armor when I crashed as I didn't need it. 
---
I wonder if a gamma gun cares at all about damage reduction.
---
I think I fought someone wearing this combo a few days ago. They wouldn't let me see their inventories. They kept blasting people's bases for 600 cap bounty and I kept chasing them down. I used an automatic handmade, so once they staggered they were dead, but it's nuts seeing yourself do no damage for the first few shots.
---
The person behaved after their second death btw.
---
I can play for 5-6 hrs with zero drops, before...I couldn‚Äôt make it 30 minutes. So yes, whatever they‚Äôre doing is working....
---
No they need to BUFF other stuff. I mean nerf Bloodied swing speed but after that no more nerfs only buffs
---
For selling to players, scrap it but don't bulk. Lets folks buy however much they want, and bulking is pointless. Truthfully, though, selling scrap will be tough, because it's so easy to come across in game.
---
I never have more than 50 of anything but steel (200) wood (100) and sprincs/screws/gears (100 each). And lately, I've gotten rid of all of my bone and all but 10 of certain things like crystal and cork.
---
I definitely think there needs to be an entire new option in the main menu for PVP and take it out of the current game type. 
---
I think I saw someone say that they are doing this maybe? 
---
Regardless, I think with the system they have, PvP cannot coexist with PvE without a lot of clashing balance-wise. 
---
In a lot of ways they just ported over Fallout 4 which was not designed to have PvP. Changes were made to help incorporate it, but it just doesn't work. They would need to do overhauls on a lot of things to make it work and I think they are realizing this as problems keep surfacing. 
---
 Both my carry weight and melee damage has continued to increase all the way to 60 so far.
---
I‚Äôve followed a few lower level players around while wearing chameleon armor and drop goodies in chests, sacks, etc.  It‚Äôs amusing to see them find what I‚Äôve placed letting them think they‚Äôve hit gold.  
---
I was only caught once in the act.  Good times...
---
Oooh junk is a reward. You can‚Äôt progress without it.
---
Hunt snallygasters in toxic valley. They also can spawn in bog town in cranberry bog. Also, in whitesprings spawns alot of abraxo cleaner, which nets you some acid too. 
---
Happens to the best of us üòÇ
---
At some point, you're right, it becomes obsessive.  But we have to find a middle ground.  There has to be a cushion the bulk of us are happy with.
---
Lolz agreed he‚Äôs annoying AF
---
Yeah he does that! Crazy aliens!
---
 Speak English trooper.
---
 7 legs ... I dunno. 
---
 200 limit per faction you understand.
---
 45 - 60 minutes .. I dunno?
---
 It takes that time to max perks ... WTF are you talking about?
---
 You can sell the useless Legendaries which the system produces although they are not worth much. I sell and would love to be able to scrap pretty well all the Legendarise I come across. It was the same in Fallout 4.
---
I don't know if that's actually their intention, or just a side effect of it being a quest item.
---
What is the issue with the flashlight pose?
---
Ive been thinking the same thing. With the prevaliance of monsters using melee instead of guns itd be rather useful. That and let us duel weild. A dagger in the offhand would make sense too.
---
Access. That‚Äôs what it does. It gives you access. 
---
Never mind shorten many ‚Äúaround‚Äù trips using ‚Äúover‚Äù. 
---
Have they actually nerfed lead in the past \~4 months? Personally never had a problem with it, but if I had, it'd be among the first I'd fix along with acid.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/7nPIzZg
---
That's a good idea actually. Tempted to give my first character a rest for the time being and make a low weight shotgunner. In a dress.
---
I get that it happens, and theres no shortage of anecdotal evidence.  But does it happen enough that everyone else now has to either wait longer or click on a prompt to log in?
---
I want pink pa paint, damnit!
---
Radshield doesn‚Äôt suppress so it‚Äôs by far the best rad resist aid for mutants :)
---
Good points. I would buy the serums for my newbie, but that only gets you the marsupial and bird bones (which I can make.) As for the jet pack...good point. I have only seen the one mod and it's hard wired to my X-01 jet pack so until folks can make them for an excavator level 15 or raider level 15 (if they go that low), then it's not going to happen. :( But it's another goal to go after.
---
And a caveat to the Class Freak perk is that if it leaves an attribute as a fraction, it will bug any perk that gives a bonus based directly on that number. (Like the ones that gives you armor bonus equal to x2 str and agility.)
---
And that's if you don't count early access... er...  I mean B.E.T.A.
---
I can easily chew through 400-500 rounds of .556 and 1000+ of 50 cal in a day, if I'm doing a lot of combat. For almost any heavy-weapons or automatic build you will start needing to print a lot of ammo.
---
If anything it shall buff your stats.
---
It should be made to fit into underarmor slot and have similiar upgrades (protected, shielded) and give stat bonuses like +1/2/3 E.
---
Mandatory -2 P as for other Gas Masks, probably, to even things out.
---
Because not everyone reddits and they see others doing it and dont realize its taboo.
---
A radroach here and there. I found a two shot version and if I can find someone who can put a scatter mod on it, I think I‚Äôd have a pretty cool and maybe mediocre laser shotgun.
---
Im a multi build. I swap cards in and out depending on the situation or how I want to play that session. ...non-PA stealth sniper... Pa-rifle .. pa-heavy... Pa-melee. I have some investing into heavy still, but for the most part I can wreck just about any and everything I come across...or avoid it all together. If I'm goin into a heavy fire zone, I drop the weight perks for more dmg, and vice versa. 
---
A perk loadout/quick swap system would be incredible if they ever implement it though.

What is it like a scooby-gang pose for exploring dark caves and ruins?
---
Yea.   It happened twice to me out of my own carelessness.  Now I just don‚Äôt ever leave out of the server in whitesprings unless I‚Äôm in the hotel.
---
I believe my arrival in an area caused an issue to someone as well.
---
One person had setup there camp right where a sentry bot spawns, the rail yard just south of Top of the World. I usually go there to get a fusion core. Something was different, concrete walls with holes, missile launchers on top of stacked filing cabinets, really scattered setup.
---
Sorry about spawning the level 60 annihilator sentry if that is what did your camp in. 
---
He didn't suggest it because if the markdowns, he suggested it because stores are removing copies of the game from their inventory
---
Was it you that attacked the OP?
---
dey terk er jerbs!!!
---
Wait... you can make the serums? I thought you had to buy them.
---
except kill him and take his lead scrap...
---
I made a small mod that replaces both the radio stations and the jukebox songs. I tried selecting songs I figured would be made by the survivors or those who came after rather than just the old songs they would have found left over from before the war.
---
I think the hardest part was finding songs of the appropriate length or those that could be edited to fit the run times. Definitely like the result however.
---
I did.  But I had just picked up the Plague Bearer mutation and thought that the long duration was a side effect of the mutation.
---
how to aim from the sound of it

The best is when you zone in and can only hear the middle coming in from a distance...

The Kids in the Hall had a couple of recurring characters, The Sizzler Sisters.  Two unhinged guys in obvious wigs, sometimes in dresses or just bathrobes, who introduced themselves as "just a couple of sisters, and not two clearly insane people!"  They each addressed the other as "Jerry."  If this guy has a tendency to address groups of people as "PRICKS!!!" then he's definitely referencing those sketches.
---
Yeah. It extends vertically about 5 flights of stairs in either direction. But I'm asking if you can get two C.A.M.P.s close enough vertically that they came form a continuous structure (practically, not snappably.)
---
There are some very tall cliffs in the savage divide that could easily be 12 or more stories tall. I'll have to find someone willing to help me try it out.

Not looking to team but ty anyway.

That‚Äôs a paddlin‚Äô lmao üòÇ

Many people do the same. I use it to safely repair things at the workbench during SBQ fight.
---
You only saw the first one this morning? There's been a spam campaign for the past week but they all get taken down pretty quick. Just posted in case anyone else posting about it legitimately believed the rumor
---
nice!
---
off to the mire I go.
---
Class freak is overrated. 
---
Run a thin mutation stack (Marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction, chameleon and grounded) and just wear the downsides. 
---
Your 3 LCK points have better use feeding mysterious savior (with a point or two in revenant in END). 
---
Nobody cares about INT. This isn‚Äôt fallout 4. 
---
What do you mean?
---
I didnt realize there were serums for mutations. Are you on Xbox?  Can I bum a couple off you? I can supply the ingredients
---
You just repair the brahmin like you would any other resource. Funny thing is, I have the brahmin pen, but don't really need fertilizer. I just wanted a cow for my camp.  makes it feel more "homey".
---
He might have to remove it and put it into compartments.  The suit bonds to him almost like skin, depending on variant.  So when the suit closed, you'd get smashed up spaghetti pockets.  No one wants that.
---
It would be good if the person's tag appeared different and their dot on the map looked different if they are frequently attacking CAMPs or workshops and they loose the slap damage protection for a certain amount of time
---
What does that have to do w anything?
---
LOL who said anything about skill?
---
No idea why you posted this honestly. 
---
Access (so many buildings with holes in roofs!) but also makes ghouls an easy fight.
---
Ghouls can't jump.
---
I just last night discovered that Inert Flux weighs a god damned pound each. Easiest 70 lbs I ever dropped. FWIW.
---
Definitely buy pre-owned would be the way to go and there is a lot out there
---
I think it works the same as other monsters. They don't strictly spot you (stealth status often remains as "caution") but they know where you fired from, and will spam shots in the general direction and approach. Their shot-spamming is just more effective.
---
Okay. So will it affect any of these?
---
Marsupial
---
Talons
---
Carnivore
---
Chameleon
---
Scaly Skin
---
Electrically Charged
---
Speed Demon
---
As far as I'm aware, they all have negative effects in whole numbers......I hope!
---
Not sure. I know I've had it proc on a bolt action pipe and a handmade that are legendaries. Only have rank one on
---
+1 for that route!!  I do almost that same loop daily selling my bulk items (I only keep at most 10 of each) and sell the excess... I also sell most of my chems as I don‚Äôt really use them save rad away, stim packs &amp; blood packs... I usually keep just a few psycho tats and psychos on hand but I generally end up with a bunch of them so I sell most of it.
---
I can‚Äôt resist the 1200 caps so when I don‚Äôt have excess I put on my Excavator armor and hit the Lucky Hole mine for a shit load of lead ore that I can smelt into lead scrap to sell (and make a bunch of 5mm for my Gatling Gun)
---
4th best selling game of November 2018 doesn't mean anything besides alot of people wanted to buy it. Not a measurement of how good or successful it is.
---
You either get to spec heavy for stealth and DPS or have more longevity and flexibility in the field. I run power armor and am often 10-20 pounds away from encumbered when I head out and I usually need to drag scrap back at a walking speed, but that's just how the game is played, mang.
---
I'd love to see what garbage you are hauling around that you believe you "can't do without"
---
Anyone else get a disease if something breathes on them? I get rad worms like every time I get hit by a ghoul
---
yep. so many trays
---
&gt; Also, why jump to victim blaming, pal?
---
Don't be so dramatic. I addressed that I understand there is crashing in a later response, which I should have addressed in my initial response to you.  My point stands that this shouldn't be happening enough for the other 23 people on the server to have to take extra steps or wait longer because you are a victim.
---
Nice hair!:)
---
You can also get mutations by exposing yourself to 10+ rads/sec of radiation when you dont have starched genes on. Then apply the perk and you can cure your rads no problem. With starched genes lvl2 and class freak lvl 3 there is no reason not to have all the mutations available except empath. Carnivore and herbivore can both be irritating but can be easily managed. I currently have 13 or 14 mutations. Think i‚Äôm missing empath and herd mentality. 
---
What type of armour is your right leg and left arm ? I can either pay caps or trade other good armour for the right pieces 
---
Really?! 
---
It's the Konami code. Was Aladin made by Konami? If so then Yes very well might be the answer to your question.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code
---
idk. Only time i have seen a mothman is when it attacked me and my friend one shot it. Should try.
---
A good solution to this would be perkable armor pieaces. Like being able to put at the very least the weight reduction perks on say the leg armor. Tie it to legendary armor. The higher the legendary star the higher level perk card you can put on it. 
---
I can't second this enough. Got good doggy out of one of my first perk packs, have had it on for ~100 levels. With that and just eating random cooked food for stats, never had issues with starving. 
---
For water, usually just lug purified with me. If i run out, make an ample amt of soup with crops and collected dirty -&gt; boiled, followed by a solid rad shower.
---
Run thru hiker 1 with junk weight reduction 2, only have 2 STR. Run full deep pockets armor, marsupial. Stims are the biggest weight issue I have, so usually sell any over 15.
---
Also, switching to armorer, contractor, weapon repair 200% perks for crafting drastically reduces the amt of junk you need to keep on hand.
---
Just wait till more folks get bored with endgame. 
---
Check the ice machine at White Spring ... I dump (and lot of other dump) unwanted legendaries there.
---
Broken for me too.  Discovered it yesterday.
---
The way I deal with STASH problem is to take the 3 star legendaries I haven't used and stuff them into the briefcase at Watoga station. Freed up 150 last time I did that. 
---
Also keep junk values around 125 except for steel, plastic, rubber, screws, gears, springs. Give away excess stable flux. Make weapons/armor for new players to get rid of junk, etc. 
---
At the moment I have 1 weapon, no armor, 30 stimpaks, no notes, no holo, no misc in the stash. Feels good
---
Hmm. Thanks for the info. Is it any prime or like a select few weapons?
---
You make some good points...  I would rebut a couple things though.
---
There are ways to do multiple builds within the perk system.  It's not working against it.  For example, because of my high Strength, Perception and Intelligence, I can do gun, Heavy Weapons and Decent Melee Builds all within the confines of my SPECIAL.  Now, with low Agility, pistols and ninja work is out.  You are right in that you can't do them all, but you don't have to limit yourself to just one.  Fortunately SPECIAL is more accommodating than that.
---
Regarding carrying extra stuff, almost all the junk I carry on my main is limited to 180.  Most of it is limited to 60 or 120.  The only exception are screws, springs, and nuclear material.  I limit that to 360.  Let me tell ya, when you have to do some repairs to multiple high end weapons and several sets of power armor, it gets pricey.  My crew helps, but they have less patience than I do to gather the junk.
---
I miss fo4 where it would liberally sprinkle them around when spawned.  Fo76 seems like it's a defined list of spawn X here instead of X% chance when generating spawn.
---
I use Spotify all the time!
---
Its your favorite game? üòï
---
I actually want to see a buff for them
---
Give it a few years, there‚Äôll be new content 
---
But then everyone wears it and there's no balance, no trade-off
---
Can you post your build. You were crit'ing like crazy!
---
I'm getting there.  
---
Platinum trophy and then shelving it for a while.  
---
Will come back after some major content releases.......if Anthem sux.......
---
At the moment it is unbalanced. There is no easy way to identify Raider role players and you cannot fairly fight back due to slap damage protection and one shotting TSE weapons
---
It‚Äôs called ‚Äúmultiplayer balance‚Äù and you don‚Äôt get to carry your house around with you.
---
I happened to be in Watoga when it was nuked last night. Got a legendary fat man (2 star) off  a bloated glowing one  and a legendary double barrel shot gun off a robot.
---
On PC there's a mod that lets you see combined weight of items. I think it's the one that adds symbols for chems, food, armor etc
---
He‚Äôs Air Force, cut em a little slack, they all think there better lmao. 
---
He clearly was referring to it going Fresh Tuna Pizza, silly /s
---
You tried a couple hours of building? I always do that when im tired of the game. Then i realise what to do next.
---
This is also a great point.  The level of management required to follow some of the suggestions in this conversation is just more than I want in a video game.
---
This is great info, thank you! Is there a good.. method to this?
---
I imagine if I get 4-5 good mutations, then a shitty one (ie empathy?) how do I remove that and not the others? Do I just unequip, radaway, and hope or re-expose the good ones?
---
The damage the weapons takes probably is furious too... Interesting. 
---
I hope they release it soon. I am tired of just wondering around it‚Äôs getting boring.
---
Only guns, but after you find the pass codes you can unlock the mod crafting for almost all ballistic weapons.
---
Honestly the more i play this the more i feel keeping the old skill tree from 4 would have just been for the best. It's not like you couldn't still have Charisma how it is, but you could just make the skills within that tree more potent.
---
It's not like the game doesn't scale enemies to your level already so why these cards exist is just another RNG Barrier that I myself am getting kinda worn on.
---
Oh for sure.. There are definitely spots where legendary spawns are"expected"..I can think of a few off the top of my head. They really should be completely random around the world... It'd make farming less concentrated for sure
---
I‚Äôm on the original Xbox, which probably doesn‚Äôt help. My connection is wired and I get 75 up/down which usually isn‚Äôt a problem. Could just be that I‚Äôm playing at busy times. 
---
Yeah... learned that one too...  Yikes
---
How exactly could this be a console player's fault?
---
That game was absolute trash.
---
Those things are so nasty.  Thank god they seem to top out at level 40.
---
Ran into a 91 glowing deathclaw.  Reminded me why you need to respect deathclaws, that's for darn sure!
---
Yeah, totally understandable. It sucks because it's kind of a sad middle ground. People wanting to be left alone can't do it 100% and people wanting to pvp can't do it 100%.
---
Almost without fail everytime I go out adventuring the FIRST diseased anything that hits me give me a disease. Doesn't matter that I have a ten endurance and over 60% disease resist. And I haven't seen a disease cure in ages. I just was able to BUY an antibiotics from the enclave for the first time last night (They're seemingly always out when I go there). I realize this is just RNG gods hating on me, but GOOD LORD do they ever hate on me. 
---
And how the FUCK is Power Armor such shit that it does literally nothing to help protect me from said diseases? 
---
Joining 
---
Ahh I‚Äôll have to farm there more then. Thanks anyways for the help
---
For weapons people actually use
---
You implied that people using TSE are having their game play propped up by it. Isn't that what you meant by crutch?
---
Then you started whining about people using them to one shot the trash ghouls you're farming at the loot cave golf club. Take your training wheels off  and go fight some super mutants and one shot weapons won't give you any problems.
---
Slap damage protection isnt a thing if a raider is destroying your camp, they would take full damage since they have a bounty.
---
The real answer hiding in the comments
---
Love it!
---
Mix and match different items frequently. 
---
Not on PC, but as for issue 2, are all your materials in the same place? Inventory OR stash. The game occasionally has issues crafting items when its pulling resources from two locations even though you have enough. Try putting everything you need to craft into your stash or on your character and try again. 
---
I remember. It was glorious.
---
Where are you stashing all these FC if they‚Äôre not on you?
---
That's what I'm thinking, each shot takes 1x durability, then 2x and so on
---
See, I know this, but because diseases are so fucking rampant there's never any when I go to look. Not your fault, just my bad luck.
---
I think I'd rather have it the other way around. 
---
If you are already in the end game, just keep grinding it out. I mean, what else do we have going on, right?
---
Such a success that it is being now rumored to go free to play. 
---
You could just go the fully monty python and do a automatic rifle character like that. Prospectors hat and the flapper dress from the atom shop. Haha Gotta focus on only drinking tea too! "I DONT LIKE CRAM!"
---
Black water mine, when you go in there‚Äôs a chamber, on the walls there‚Äôs a lot of coal
---
Hit up the Belching Betty mine too, if you keep going right when the path splits, you can find a whack of black titanium nodes, there is 1 ultracite node too.
---
Bonus points if you build the excavator arms first and use them as they will give you more ores per node.
---
Griefers usually move in groups damaging shit and take each other's bounties which means you cannot fight back fairly
---
We need WinDirStat but for our goddamn inventory and stash.
---
&gt;no pun intended.
---
Liar.
---
There are a few male ones, what ya talking about? 
---
You have to make cure disease to make antibiotics.
---
The prompt should only come up if you would be actively in a blast zone.
---
The same concept as when your CAMP is in an occupied space on the new server.
---
This isn't rocket science.
---
As traders, we need more stash space for our inventories
---
I go to lucky hole mine so i can use the radiation arches at the beginning to cure rads/mutations i don‚Äôt want and the water a bit of the way in is very radioactive. Fyi you can only get one mutation per play session so if you want another you have to log out and back in to start a new session. As far as curing a specific mutation i don‚Äôt know of a way. It‚Äôs just a gamble. I‚Äôd suggest checking some videos on YouTube if you want some more info. 
---
I also play as a non-PA stealthy sniper, but I like the fact that I have to manage my low Strenght (and Endurance). It stresses the idea of a "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee" character.  
---
Speed Demon was in fact the only mutation I've considered, but I found the fact that I wouldn't have been able to manage it (because of the consequent need to carry a lot of food) in line with my character flavor.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea, I usually have materials in both so if/when it happens again I‚Äôll try moving them all to stash/inventory. Thanks!
---
"Safety not guaranteed" 
---
Should I open it? :(
---
Um.. I regularly get flap-limb, which as a melee build SUCKS
---
Same, I love the game but found I was just logging in to sell to vendors for their daily limit, recently I cant even be bothered to do that now
---
If you have a bloodied build your dps would be higher with the bloodied gatling
---
Giant Mothman
---
If you can kill SB's fast, then Furious will be good, but if you have to stop and kill the scorched it spawns, you lose your dmg bonus.
---
Of course if you aren't running around with a bunch of low HP perks and unyielding armor, bloodied loses some of its dmg capability.
---
Already dumped all my extra ammo by donating it. However, I didnt know about bobbleheads and magazines... I should dump those next
---
Or...ya know, less than 2 weeks? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I guess that‚Äôs long for some people 
---
Preach, Player (bethsoft come back/ any kinda fool can see/ I will give u/ under the table handies *bwoooooowww). The weight restrictions take a lot of menu work to keep under control, when I'd rather be out kicking ass.
---
I'd say furious. But you can either sell it on r/Market76 or scrap it for components! 
---
This game is not about collecting and carrying as much junk as possible. Stop collecting stuff. Carry your armor, Carry Your Guns, carry a little bit of junk for whatever it is you're working on right then. Stop trying to carry enough junk for every possible situation.
---
I‚Äôve seen fission sites other then cranberry bog
---
Saw one a couple weeks ago too nE map corner up Abbie‚Äôs bunker
---
Haven‚Äôt seen it since last patch
---
Ah dude don‚Äôt worry, I walked backwards into a fissure while shooting a mirelurk queen, and a dude jumped in to revive me.  Embarrassing for both of us. 
---
I tried to fly there with jet pack, eating Coffee on the fly to replenish AP, but the problem is that my Jet Pack turns of when I open wheel-tab and it won‚Äôt turn on again until I hit the ground.
---
Tried Marsupial+strange in numbers+bird bones and stacking of AP regen perks and food, food for extra AP.
---
Still not enough. But I believe there is a method to fly... if only I could replace the emoticons button for Coffee to apply it like stimpack mid-air.
---
P.s. but if you repeatedly press R2 it helps to traverse tremendously long distances horizontally with jet pack.
---
It should be like in every FPS game. G standart (and of course whatever button it is on console), and free to rebind to every button you want.
---
It's a speed problem.  It happens if you're too fast with the space bar.  It'll run through all the cans and then it will pull in some random inventory item.  If you don't notice, you'll just keep spamming space and toss whatever that item was right into the bin, and there's no way to take it back out.
---
If you are slow with the space bar, it doesn't happen.  It's a problem with how the game does the inventory move and something with the process time vs you hitting space bar faster than that process time.
---
Note, this problem actually happens elsewhere, and you can see it happen, but The result of the action in other instances doesn't result in a lost item.  You just see some random item pop up in the empty list and then go away. These other actions don't involve you moving the item or if your inventory, so it just pops back into your inventory like it never happened.  Mama Dolce is the only instance that results in you moving that item or of your inventory into another.
---
Basically, I just learned not to spam the space bar during Mama Dolce, and there's no problem.
---
Bethesda needs to fix the code logic around this.  They're just really lucky it only causes a problem in one place.  This could have very easily been everyone losing stuff any time they interface with any inventory system.  It could have been epically bad.
---
Never seen any proof that is actually happening. Just people on here saying it did. Just like the trade stealing. Not saying it couldn't happen, I just dont believe it.
---
Seems like every time I log in and my CAMP location is taken, it stores another complete set of items used. Last time I moved camp I was at like 250% budget because of all the duplication. Had 60-70 extra walls and stuff.
---
Just outside the club tennis field side. 
---
How many hours do you have in game?
---
I think we're all in the Skyrim/Fallout4 mode of GRAB EVERYTHING, which isn't how this game is supposed to be played.  
---
I still have weight issues, but only if I'm not paying attention.  I have room in my inventory for a bunch of junk, and two or three  weapons/armor I pick up.  
---
Much like you have to pick what style you want to play so you pick the right perks, how you play also determines what should be in your possession.  
---
I'm playing with no alts and while it's a bummer, it's nowhere near unmanageable.  But you have to sit there and go "Alright, maybe if I have over 200 of something, I should get rid of anything over that."  And basically just stop hoarding Bobbleheads and Magazines.  Anymore, I pick one up, I just use it immediately.
---
A statement by a 3rd party not involved with publishing the product is not official.
---
Honestly I stopped carrying anything, just armor/2 weapons. The game doesn't reward me for hording., If I need something I'll just go find it, but otherwise I just let it go.
---
I mean I ran around the whole map located everything did every mission, daily missions are boring doing the same thing everyday. I know people are going to get mad at me and start showing there ass it‚Äôs just me how I feel. I just want new content is all. 
---
Sounds rather fun to me, weren't harming anyone/anything so can't fundamentally see anything wrong with it. 
---
Last night I was sneaking near 98 NAR and my sneak indicator tightened down showing someone else was near. After bumbling around a bit our paths crossed and I just left him to his robot slaying. But on my way north I spotted a 3rd guy who was lurking on the two of us intrigued by the gunfire. Had no clue he was there. Perception is 14, but his Agility must've been as equally high I assume as the name never showed above him nor did he appear on compass (was only a stones throw away). 
---
Adds a little something that previous Fallout never really had...somebody could be watching at any time and no telling what their motives are. 
---
Me, I just kinda like watching to see what people do. I'm not super interested in PvP at the moment (not sure how well my stealthy rifle build would hold up) and no intention of popping one off at em. 
---
Where is this ice machine?
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
I do have stuff stored, ill dump it. I dont camp in whitesprings cuz its always getting bombed. I may have too many turrets though
---
Can confirm that stuff in stash will show the reduced weight from the perk, but will take up the full weight of the item. I've seen this a few times with stuff affected by bear arms, etc.
---
Thank-you!
---
Kinda a weird one but at the monorail elevator on the left side (if you‚Äôre looking towards the mountain) right by the rock wall on one of the foundations there‚Äôs a skeleton in a chair and there was a basket next to him with like 5-8 firecaps in it
---
Joining
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know I am at work right now but when I find out I‚Äôll let you know.
---
I was just commenting to my buddies the other day that I wish I had just 5 more points. I agree the game needs to be challenging and you need to make good choices when choosing perks. I think the mods in Fallout 4 made spoiled everyone with being able to max out all perks. Having said all that, if I only had 5 more points ü§î
---
The decontamination arches in the Enclave work, BTW. I agree we should be able to craft them. Just thought I'd mention that there are some there at all the side exits.
---
case in point to the person also replying to this comment implying what other reason other than being an awful person.
---
Miscommunication all around.
---
I am running a silence handmade at the moment that I really like.  Unfortunately that knocks down the range enough that it can be hard to actually hit the SB
---
If he isn't on Xbox or doesn't want it.  I'd gladly take it.  I've been wanting Marsupial for a while.  How much you asking for it?
---
It is a crutch. Even people w TSE admit it. Not that big of a deal honestly.
---
Little secret. I'm lvl 151 and have no problem 1 shotting things. That's not the point at all. You must be another TSE user that's going to suck at the game since you're getting angry enough to try insulting me. What was the point in that?
---
Sorry I ruffled your undies there bud. It's gonna be alright. https://youtu.be/OSzYUf2-GSs
---
Absurdly I noticed this with Diablo 2 ages ago. My friends would grind Hell looking for better gear to I guess grind Hell. Incidentally, there are videos of people speed running diablo 2 which to me seems far more interesting a challenge then the pointless grinding that so many settle for.
---
No worries there are quite a few who are bored due to finishing the game and have taken to doing this to entertain themselves. You'll run into them soon enough
---
If your weapon breaks, it's removed from your hotkey.  The glitch may be linked to weapon breaks and a combination of some other factor.  I've had broken weapons without loss, so I don't know what else it may be.  I'd just start there though.
---
They are not adding pvp servers. They are adding pvp content. Meaning : new quests and events BUT based on player vs player. My guess is that they want to balance things out before the big pvp content, but they are not touching the assassin's+sentinel which can get you 115% damage reduction.
---
Like Napoleon Dynamite had tots in his cargo pants pocket
---
I also have struggled with a workbenches menu not popping up at all. Not sure if that's similar to your issue number 1. But my character will do the animation but no menu pops up. I have fixed it either by moving the workbenches. Or by scrapping it and building a new one. It doesnt happen all the time though. 
---
No but it's a pretty good indication when the rumor started with claims against the 3rd party. 3rd party confirms they're doing no such thing then it must mean the rumor was fake
---
Yes. And not one single weapon specific skins. There should be things like, pipe weapons, heavy guns. 
---
If it's going to be a single weapon/armor skin, it shouldn't be priced so high. 
---
I agree that bulking would be a huge help, but first they have to fix bulking so it reduces more than just aluminum and lead.
---
this is the real end game
---
Oh look, a market bot.
---
Mixed blessing, it actually seems like the base models crash less than the upgraded versions. But they might very well a little stressed with all the lighting effects.
---
Have you tried pinging the Bethesda website vs other websites? You may have better luck using googles dns vs your isp's dns. Maybe the routing they have you on is creating latency.
---
Connection should be good unless you have 15+ devices.
---
Nope. I love it, I'm a huge fan of the game, but right now there is simply nothing for me to do. I've taken two characters to 80+, I have no goals to chase, no new content to experience, and cycling through the same few events has reached the point of stale. The lack of concrete content plans and vague promises for the future are driving me to the point of just moving on because while I sit here expecting at least consistent Inside the Vault releases, we're not even getting that. I'm a die hard Fallout fan and fully expected to waste the next year with this game, but there just isn't enough to facilitate making that a reality. Hopefully they kick it into overdrive with the content releases soon. 
---
I ought not have said zero, but I think the game really does allow for something very close to zero‚ÄîPacifist Mode is a very powerful feature for players who don‚Äôt want to PvP; also, the ability to block everyone on your server, and you can always exit the world and hop servers if someone won‚Äôt leave you alone. 
---
&gt; Paragon Perk cards would all be none combat cards
---
Why specifically non combat cards? 
---
I agree, the game is supposed to be survival in the Wasteland. And that shit's not going to be easy.
---
What was he wearing? Yesterday I stepped out of Charelston Station vendor and a guy with a amusement park outift and a bounty of 840 caps just ran past me along the tracks leading north. I was in my low level char, so I hadn't the AP to follow him. Also I didn't wanna get murdered, since, as I said, he had a substantial bounty.
---
I had quite a laugh.
---
There's a visual mod available to take down the effects, so it's not absolutely blinding.
---
PC but thanks. 
---
I've had #1 happen quite a few times. Hopping servers seems to fix it for me. Worst was the other night as it just seemed extremely delayed, I was quite a distance from the workbench when the menu finally popped up. 
---
I always see it as an mistake, like they forgot 1 or 2 zeros. lol
---
https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Boardroom-Meeting-Suggestion.jpg
---
they're*.  I am so sorry.
---
Seems like they should just fix those things too. People honestly shouldn't be able to just roll in and trash all of your stuff unless you've actively chosen PvP
---
The point is to be able to use gunsmith 5, demo expert 3, and first aid 2.
---
A bunch of this game is weight management. Also, you could not use speed demon or just forage as you go.
---
On xbox i can expect to crash to home screen at least 10 times in a few hour gaming session. It has gotten horrible after the last patch they did.
---
It‚Äôs part of the reason why I get so annoyed when people try to tell me ‚Äúwhy do you care? It‚Äôs not like it (duping/exploits) really affect you.‚Äù Actually yeah it does.  
---
My favorites are the freshly level 45-50s that can finally equip there dupetrash and run off looking to PvP every person twice their level and then y‚Äôall trash, I‚Äôve had it happen numerous times this week across all my alts. 
---
300 caps and its yours. I've got Speed Demon as well. Can give you both for 500. 
---
It would make it fair to fight back griefers/Raider role players who destroy and wipe each other's bounties
---
You‚Äôll get an email out to me on that one brother they got a fix something and you‚Äôre absolutely right we waste valuable perks  unnecessarily.
---
I‚Äôve been saying it from the beginning but it goes on death ears. And they want you to play the game more anyways correct so there‚Äôs your answer why we have what we have.
---
*Mothman screech*
---
Me ‚ÄúOH SHIT‚Äù
---
*I shoot and kill Mothman*
---
Larry ‚ÄúOH MY GOD FREDDY!!!!‚Äù
---
Me ‚Äúum Freddy died of lead poisoning...‚Äù
---
For the food problem, you could look into the cannibal perk so you can carry less food and just eat off of your enemies 
---
ooooohhhhh, shit that's right, u can have three 1‚òÜ cards instead of one 3‚òÜ card!!!!!! DUUUUUUDDDDEEEE isn't it gr8 there's so much malleability in play style in this game?
---
This happens with ticks in Gorge. Look for the diamond or circle thing and walk around in workshop area till you find it, or it finds you 
---
If you mean the alien looking purple dude ? Yes me and a stranger I had teamed up with to trade stumbled across him in another players base on accident. He gave crystals and other mediocre loot. Hope I didn‚Äôt accidentally start an intergalactic war.
---
Just got to manage your inventory better. I go out with only 200 rounds for all 3 of my guns, a full set of leather armor, and a handful of aid items and sit around 89lbs. 
---
The only weight reducing perks I have is for junk.
---
Take what you need. You'll probably find more, or find benches to craft more and scrap your junk, at pretty much every location if you look hard enough.
---
If you're blocking, you're not swinging.
---
In regards to those 5 plants of each at your camp,  what do you do with the spoiled veg after the plants expire after about an hour? 
---
The game isn't about hoarding. It's about learning where to get certain resources when you need them. Because, those resouces will be back in the same spot every day, just waiting to be picked up. And if they're not, just server hop till they are. 
---
I think food plants that are in your stored CAMP items won't degrade, but any other thing you drop in stash will.
---
 OK. Some nice pistols might help. ;) Just shooting the shit with a passer by at my place the other day and dogs, molerats and some Muties showed up. He had some higher level gun and I had my Revolver. I was one shoting everything as he was hosing then down.
---
 I was happy to get the plans but I did not know how good this gun is. My 10mm is also a work of art but its very different.
---
Have you tried the high schools and gyms?
---
These are definitely known issues, but I haven't heard of solutions to most of them. As noted already, stashing your junk usually solves the crafting issues.
---
The Excavator issue is a bug that from what I've read might be triggered by logging off while still wearing the armor. I've read reports where your carry weight temporarily goes up higher than it's supposed to be, like it's counting the carry bonus twice. Then it can disappear completely and won't come back even if you put the armor back on. In both cases, the suggested solution I've seen is to take the armor off, log out and restart your game. It should be fixed when logging back in.
---
whats that under, luck?
---
The Mr. Handy Buzz Blade has very fast attack speed, that¬¥s why i seems to proc more often than your gatling gun, which is really slow. 
---
Looting and sitting. I hate accidently laying down while trying to loot quickly
---
Sixteen Tons
---
When you enter the main gate. Look left. He is walking around the large concession stand.
---
Ya but the OP was clearly speaking about the more archaic shield you hold in your hand rather than an invisible force that protects you.
---
Well country roads would be a mountain and a river. Call me a stickler but I‚Äôm pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt matter how 5x5 you are, you‚Äôre not gonna beat a mountain/river with roads
---
I have exact same issues 1&amp;2 on PC. Dont think i had them before the last patch. 
---
Ahh, reading challenges.
---
I'll repeat with emphasis:
---
&gt;Please provide at least a yes/no option before a player loads into a server ***if*** *you're in the blast radius of a nuclear strike.*
---
Sorry my sentence was long?
---
Should maybe be adjusted so it's not so easy to solo and not so hard to take down as a mixed group though.
---
Yeah, no kidding. 
---
Well I'm just thinking if its 20, what have you done?  If its 200, I think its ok to be bored.
---
I'll take em! Do you have multiple. Name is thecrimsondon
---
Good idea moving it or scrapping it I‚Äôll try that thank you!
---
There‚Äôs no diamonds tho. Server hop fixed it
---
Careful with overseers chests, I havent been able to test with a friend, but I think they are locked to the player.
---
Flatwoods is part of my vendor loop, and I havent seen anything other than the quest loot the first time and canned dog food / boiled water every time after in that chest.
---
I have found player loot multiple times in cash registers @ vendors and the blue suitcase @ Watoga.
---
"Cram, cram, cram, cram / cram, cram, cram, cram / crammity craaaaaaammmm!!" Awed Onlooker, shaking head slowly: "Cramn."
---
As someone who can't thriw grenades properly, I support this message x.x
---
Nope I have  a explosive radium, a two shot handmade, an exterminators explosive shotgun, and an instigating super sledge. My explosive shotgun is the only TS or E weapon that I have that can one shot anything and it kills me more than anything else in the game.
---
I'm vehemently opposed to having my radium rifle or my TS handmade nerfed. I don't farm trash mobs at Whitesprings and I don't PvP and when I'm solo wandering the was land they are far from OP or a 'crutch'.
---
You know what is OP?.......my instigating sledge. And I bet that asshole who bought a full set of sentinel unyielding duped armor on eBay is pretty OP too.
---
Playing solo I don't give a crap what weapons or armor people have.......I don't want trash farmers and PvP players crying for nerfs.
---
Brotherhood of Canes
---
I audited my junk and tried to get everything around 10 bulk or less. Found I had hundreds and hundreds of fiberglass and fiber optics, probably from cigarettes and telephones. I don't pick those up anymore :)
---
Take a step back, and ask yourself... How much of that stuff you're picking up and holding do you NEED to hold on to? The stash is just a free fast travel away üëç
---
Oh wow, I must have missed that announcement! Please link it so I can see for myself!
---
You make a valid point, i luckly have a max str and my only weight reduction perk card is for food and water. 
---
Honestly this game is so punishing to rifle users. Str can support: unarmed, 1h, 2h, heavy, and shotguns with melee having a built in weight reduction to a perk that provides a useful benefit.
---
Pistols are light enough that you could forgo dumping 15 points in str.
---
Rifles are heavy and you usually need two (close and long range). Ive seen skiny man builds that have little to no str all into per,agl,lck but they literally ration the shit outta themselves.
---
I think most ppl see a class and only look at a wepon for its pros and cons instead of the whole picture including perks, special point requirements to function, and minimum inventory space. 
---
My loadout is 3 fist wepons and 1 gatling gun, heavy combat armour with a few cosmetic items. 2 spare gats in my stash and 5 peices of charisma armour with the ultralight mod on them. The only thing i collect is magazines and 1 of each bobble head. 
---
After that i ration my junk. I look at how much it cost to repair my main wepon and multiply those materials by 10. I then keep 20 of each misc junk. Same for armour and my gat. If i repair i pick up some junk related to repairing (screws, adhesive,ect.) But nothing in a large ammount. 
---
I usually have 400-500 weight used in my stash at any point. I rarely pick up anything unless i know my stash reserve is low. Every once in a while ill inventory to bring my stash to the above listed ammounts, cuz i know anything more than that is wasted.
---
All you need to do is spend one day, set some rules and follow them. It's just like cleaning your house, if you dust everyday when it comes time to clean thoroughly its not that bad cuz you never let it get tooo crazy. 
---
I have 1 strength, wear no power armour, am a rifle build, and have no weight issues.
---
The only strength perk I use is travelling pharmacy (which is a god send).
---
I have a lever action rifle and typically have 500-600 ammo on me at a time.
---
Grilled radstag is very useful to have on hand too.
---
I have about 100lbs spare to work with.  The only time I get encumbered is when farming steel really.  Or when I don‚Äôt have time to check legendaries during a nuke and just hold onto all of them until I get a breather and can drop the useless ones (so...all of them).
---
Christ. You've got it sussed. I'm at 175/195 and have convinced myself it's either all necessary or I'm secretly carrying two fat men somehow. 
---
I started with FO3, FO:NV, FO 1&amp;2 and FO4 and to be honest despite all the issues I'm enjoying the game for what it is. The flaw that stands out the most for me is the  lack of human/ghoul NPCs. Most will chime in and say "there are NPCs" referring to the Mr. Handys/Protectrons but if you know Fallout they're programmed to do a job and can't comprehend that the humans are long gone. In the previous games you felt the danger in this open wasteland. What supported that feeling were these pockets of civilization. All the human/ghoul NPCs know the danger out there and fear walking out those front gates. This is why they send you to run errands. It gave meaning to the quests and forced you make hard choices (e.g. Tenpenny Tower FO3).
---
Although I think this game has potential it just feels unfinished, not in a polished sense but in a "there's nothing to do" sense. I honestly wished they had gone the direction of ESO. 
---
I got so used to the 400 pounds I've been able to handle my weight really well so far. But I'm no where close to this guys level or most of you guys. I'm a 45.
---
Maybe your DT should be halved in each category (ballistic, energy, radiation) when wearing the hazmat suit. I think it could balance out with perks and Med X
---
Brody sucks, I hate that asshole and I'm glad he's dead.
---
I use deep pocketed armor and switch to excavator when I need to fast travel. Popping some alcohol for short burst str or radmeat for +20 carry helps a lot
---
Really all they need to do is apply a filter to the container.  It seems like that should be easy to do.
---
I have 3 turrets! I had 4 but apparently a heavy machine gun turret takes more budget than a regular one, so we're gated by both perks and budget when it comes to turrets.
---
Yeah leaving the server and joining a new one is my go to fix
---
I don't remember how many of each I have crafted. I think I have at least two of each. I'll be on later tonight though. Around 10pm est. 
---
Really? Now I have a reason to not just dump my grain at the vault‚Äôs doorstep. 
---
Would love something like a player-made Bog Town or New Gab. Where huts are randomly thrown together wherever, sometimes with crooked paths on planks between them, and small bars and shops in a big chaotic mess. A free-for-all-workshop. But I don't see a way to do that in a way that can't be griefed without running private servers and moderators.
---
Um are you me sending messages while Im asleep because I have the exact same complaint just add in ratchet and clank to her game list. 
---
They're working out just fine. They're firing at the rate that I'm sure is intended, and if it's not, it still doesn't need a fix. Plenty of this multiplayer game is soloable already, don't whine about the highest tier enemies in an otherwise pretty easy game being too challenging.
---
&gt; take extra steps or...
---
Clicking yes or no is taking extra steps.
---
Why did you even make a post if you were going to turn into a gaping asshole when someone didn't agree. 
---
...or they could just be active 100% of the time. if they really want to go the extra mile, make separate perks for "increased sweetspot".
---
The robots with female names, female voices, and the female "Miss Nanny" variant of the "Mister Handy"? No, not assuming anything at all.
---
Haha yupp! Maxing out survivability and QoL are my End Game content.

Good Doggy is better in almost every way. It is 1 point for the full effect. I only carry dog food and Salisbury steaks.
---
Eating corpses gives you massive rads.
---
People seriously need to understand how to make personal loot rules.
---
I only pick up dog food and Salisbury steaks.
---
I only pick up junk that gives multiple components. 
---
I only pick up x because it gives the same components as y but weighs less.
---
Thanks for the pic, I wondered what they actually looked like!
---
Well first sorry for the bad grammar. I wrote that too late last night.  
---
I then ask, was it? Maybe I just never returned to places I had been assuming nothing was left. But it always seemed to me that once you looted a place it was empty and nothing left. 
---
Either way the ability to search and area realize you can load up on certain materials there and keep going back to farm them is awesome. And makes it easier to keep that stash box below 600. 
---
Wall it in and put it behind a locked door 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a big issue üò©
---
On one hand I can understand the frustration, especially if you've played the earlier games with capacity mods so you never had to worry about running out of space.  On the other hand, it doesn't seem like an unreasonable choice to face.  You can be jack-of-all-trades or a master-of-some-trades.  Want to focus on a specific weapon?  You're going to build your character around it, and sacrificing flexibility in all other areas is the trade-off.
---
If you're constantly equipping thru-hiker just to move, you're carrying around a lot of food and drink, possibly on top of a lot of other stuff already.  Don't carry around so much.  Don't pick up everything you come across.  Cook and sell off excess stuff for caps.  It's easy to grab everything, and appealing for the convenience of having consumables and ammo and mats ready, but a little self-control goes a long way.
---
I'm experimenting a bit with the jack-of-all-trades thing with my character, who has 9 in charisma (so I can share rank 3 perks), 7 in luck (sacrificed for charisma), and 8 each remaining stat.  I can equip a good variety of perks, and if I limit myself to rank 2 for many of them I gain decent benefits while keeping flexibility.  I have multiple weight-saving and scavenging perks as well as combat and utility perks.
---
The drawbacks are obvious though.  I can't specialize much, especially with damage since I can't equip all rank-3 damage perks for a particular weapon.  I can focus a bit, but even with weapons I've been equipping a lot of rank-2 perks so I can have variety (I have 1 melee and 4 ranged in my weapon wheel).  I don't deal massive damage, but stuff still dies, just not as fast as it could.
---
While I would like more capacity for inventory and stash, it's really just to satisfy the hoarder in me.  Having to play under these restrictions has forced me to adapt a bit, and by passing up on a good amount of loot that would weight me down, especially if I know there isn't a crafting station nearby to scrap it all, has spared me a lot of the inventory management I engaged in when I first started playing.
---
I do kind of think the weight reduction perks could maybe be reduced to 2 ranks for maximum effectiveness.  Maybe even 1, but that's a bit extreme.   I don't think they need to be free, but I'm not sure if they need to required 3 ranks to do what they do well.
---
Oh No I got the game when it first came out I have a shit load of hours and every mission completed except 3 which I am stuck on. I have completed doing the nuke all by myself more then once. I have made my own home which is very fun btw. I run around giving all my plans to all the lower level people who play the game. I have killed the queen scorch-beast have the achievement. I love the game I‚Äôm just bored especially with no one else to game with. 
---
I think the STASH limits need to be updated. The weights of raw items and bulked items needs to be reworked. Why is bulk cloth heavier than bulk steel? Why is bulk springs and gears heavier than bulk aluminum? Why, if a player has an active perk, doesn't it affect the STASH as well?
---
Made a long post about this a few days ago.  Relevant part:
---
Shields with mod ideas:
---
Kitchen Cabinet Door - different wood mods like baseball bats
---
Car Door - Bulletproof window
---
Trash Can Lid - Bolts around the edge
---
Hubcaps - Chrome
---
Police Riot Shields - Clean
---
Stop signs - Humorous stickers (STOP "In the Name of Love," STOP "Animal Cruelty")
---
Deathclaw Hide - Different Colors for different hides like glowing and albino (chameleon deathclaw could count for chameleon trait)
---
Salvaged Sentry Bot Leg - Different Paint Jobs
---
Mr. Handy Case - Eyes still attached
---
Wooden Shield (to match the armor set)
---
High-tech BoS Endgame Shield with Electric Damage on Block
---
Transparent Enclave Endgame Shield that highlights targets when you looked through it.
---
Scorchbeast Wing Endgame Shield - Lightweight high armor    
---
Musical Shields:
---
Washboard 
---
Cymbal (goes clang when blocking)
---
I like all this but most still seems a bit down the road for the game.
---
So far I've found 600 weight quite manageable. Would not shy away from more storage. But only now I started getting storage full messages and usually go together with times when I'm about to craft/repair or craft ammo and consumables, so it gets lower again.
---
Definently less time spent managing inventory since the increase.
---
If you have the perk where you can search animals for more meat, the brahmin can give you meat.  
---
Nah, it's just a little bug, fixes on loadup
---
Don‚Äôt wanna wait a few years that‚Äôs crazy.
---
Shut up, bot.
---
Go and put everything in your stash box then go back and try
---
I legit got bored a month ago, but I came back a few days ago and I'm enjoying it again. I'm assuming I just got burned out of doing the same over and over. Hoping for new content though. 
---
I'd rather see every 50 levels we get Special point and perk slot.
---
EDIT: Don't just down vote, give a reason. OP's suggestion is way more overpowered than mine. Once you get to level 150, with my suggestion you'd have 2 extra special points and 2 extra perk cards. Not really that over powered.
---
With the suggestion in this post, you'd have 15 perk cards that could be used for "non-combat" perks, freeing up 15 spaces to use combat perks ...
---
POST MODERN JUKEBOX FTW!!!! I saw them in concert !!
---
We already do get a huge punishment of a huge bounty. I leveled someone's house once and was walking around with a 750 cap bounty. Someone killed me and I lost like 1,000+ caps. That's enough incentive for people to not destroy other people's camps
---
Should work that way on Pc, we can use favorites without open the wheel. I would test it, but in my 219 levels of playing i was never blessed with an jetpack. lol
---
Still have time to join ?
---
I love the game too but I am bored at Times. If i was solo in the game i would probably not play. I mainly play with friends or not at all now. No long sessions solo at least. 
---
Do bot know how many hours played but i al lvl 240 and i have not been farming gouls for XP in a long time so I guess I have a lot of hours. I probably should not look üòÇ
---
Search on the net for it. They get updated every week.
---
most of the cards that should be passive or are not combat perks, like weight management and hacking/lock picking
---
Wearing PA has no trade offs (apart from lacking legendary affixes).
---
Currently my setup provides moderate radresist protection:
---
Marine wetsuit buffs radresist by 9
---
My full sentinel set gives me 100 radresist from tertiary affixes (and I believe you can increase it even more but I have‚Äôt bothered with radresist armor mods, having deep pockets instead).
---
Rad x gives 200
---
Rad shield 300
---
Total of 609 radresist which is on-par with PA.
---
I safely killed SBQ in combat armor spending only 3-4 radaway during the fight.
---
If hazsuit somehow locks both your headslot, outfit slot and underarmor slot - it would be trade-off for most people anyway.
---
Oh wow beautiful spot and great aesthetics, especially the exterior. Nice.
---
Weight management has been in all the games.
---
That said, I know a ton of the playerbase mod out carry weight on all the games.
---
If that is you, then I can see why it seems so foreign.
---
My main thing is proper inventory management, it may seem tempting to grab everything you can, but you dont need excess in a game that has resources in every area you go to 
---
Just to clarify, are you saying there‚Äôs not a limit that you know of?
---
Question: 
---
I keep hearing that the animal/creature has to be a random encounter to be tamable. 
---
Is this the case? and if so, are there specific places to check for random spawns? 
---
I have been searching all around and all I ever get is pacify option. I have animal friend and wasteland whisperer maxed and 6 charisma. Lvl. 150. 
---
If they just let you pick a server to share with 24 people and never removed your camp when you logged out, it would work. They could also make town set up areas that were just simple terrain, so there wouldn't be too many objects in the area at once. It probably wouldn't happen until private servers are a thing, but it's still a cool idea.
---
Well ya jinxed me! I just got back on and a freaking super mutant followed me to my base somehow. I had to kill it by myself, almost died too! It got 2 headshots on me, so I just threw a frag grenade and ran.
---
If only we could pickpocket her and place a mini-nuke...
---
Its incredible how many bugs this thing still has.
---
A lot of challenges are totally bugged, like the "discover location in x", ive discovered all locations in the game and still those challenges are incomplete.
---
I want my atoms!
---
thanks a lot and hope you have fun in the waste lands.
---
Tomorrow Or Wednesday No School
---
I did it probably 7 times, when I was level 28 ish, far as I know it still works. Good luck, was frustrating but that's how I got mine.
---
The way it‚Äôs an issue is that it doesn‚Äôt align with always being able to have gone max weight potential plus your preferred damage setup plus miscellaneous stuff. This system forces you to choose in an attempt to wall players into limited play styles at worst, or farming at best to get needed things that lessen the issue. I like the perk card system, think it‚Äôs fun, but it creates issues more than it helps
---
I don‚Äôt get the ammo vending machines, they make no sense price or quantity wise
---
This isn't what disagreement looks like. What you are doing is jumping to conclusions based on a skimmed reading of what I wrote.
---
You misunderstood what I was asking for, berated me for that, and insinuated that game bugs that are severe enough to crash the client which happen more on than once each session are somehow my fault.
---
I'm just struggling to even follow your broken chain of logic and reciprocating your tone.
---
Where?  I've finally gotten a mod that tells me what plans I have already learned and have been farming the vendors for stuff.  Need to get more weapon plans, I have finally gotten many of the melee weapon plans I didn't know I needed.  This hasn't been one of them though and I must get it!
---
Well you shouldn‚Äôt be in Watoga to begin with if your worried about high leveled enemies.
---
I try to keep the heaviest items (weapons and Armor) I don‚Äôt use in the stash. Sell what I don‚Äôt use or need. Keeping certain items at a cap also helps: stimpacks at 20, food and drink at 10 and so on. It would be more beneficial to constantly fast travel to your camp for food and water then to keep so much on you. Junk and ammo adds up to but I‚Äôm a melee so I discard all my ammo and keep the important junk
---
In my stash. 
---
why would it have to be cheating. you want to display your stuff then it should be able to be stolen I think. That would make for even better PvP which is non existent right now. It alerts you when someone steals something from your house or something like that. 
---
I grind radium rifle mods atm by building and scrapping. My observation is that after you got a couple of mods, the mod gain chance decreases. Unlike other weapons like pipe rifles where you learn a mod with almost every scrap, i have to scrap 2-3 radium rifles for a mod to learn.
---
The three separate parts is atrocious 
---
Don't worry they will nerf your armor or weapons sooner than later and you can start the grind all over.
---
As the name says, it's just luck of the draw. I've got a TSE gatling and I've had it activate 4 times in 5 minutes and then I've had the gun completely break without it activating.
---
Nope I meant on the picture. I've not attacked anyone on fallout yet at all
---
Don't.
---
Thanks!!  It worked
---
But then that just frees up room for more combat cards to be equipped.
---
Wait until it's free.  
---
probably all wood armor if he is killing the SQB
---
Straighten up and fly right
---
Yeah he could get sued by the city of west virginia
---
I don‚Äôt wear armor and my guns are already nerfed but it doesn‚Äôt matter if you basically already beat the game!
---
RPG's are all about builds and balancing. Taking in the pros and cons. It would be nice. But it would also be overpowered.
---
all that shit you just listed except the acid I am constantly trying to find. You always need screws.. .like always. aluminum, and springs often too. 
---
Trophies and challenges in general are littered with bugs.
---
Reminds me of Team Fortress 2 sprays. Man I miss those sprays. My favorite one was the guy eating ice cream naked off of his own private area. 
---
Well, they said from the start they wanted to evolve the game over time based on player feedback, so I was expecting a base game release with 20 hours or so of content. I‚Äôm curious to see how they add content. 
---
The guy in the documentary talked about several small releases and then a big one, then repeat the cycle. I trust them to do this because they bought and set up a whole new studio for this.
---
But, yeah, they should have just accepted it wasn‚Äôt ready and released later. I mean, they‚Äôre Bethesda. Their releases will be highly watched and covered any time of the year. If they released now with the current level of patching they would have had a much better time.
---
I am curious if they ever thought to use the ESO engine as a starting point. The combat part would need to be scrapped and redone, but the time saved having an already shaken out multiplayer world rendering, weapon/armor system, guilds (factions), shops, traders, grouping  seems attractive to me. 
---
I want to show you my camp that's all
---
Protip: go to your camp before you log out. 
---
Well, I mean I am using that tab to track down someone right now by server hopping so I guess your point is valid. Here have an upvote!
---
Brotherhood of Chemistry Stations!
---
this is good. What I've done as well. Keep around 50 of the shit, if you use a lot of it then 100. But over that I get rid of and just find as I explore. 
---
Nope, rifle build level 105 here, I have 4 different TSE in my stash as well as a ton of outfits. Still hover around 550. When I hit 600 I know its time to sell or bulk.
---
Yeah. I mean if junk wasn't a reward you wouldn't be able to obtain certain more rare mats only under certain circumstances.
---
And while common junk is pretty discsrdable, the most sought after common junk (Screws, springs, gears), is has made me far more caps than anything else.
---
I would also like in on this. Accidentally forgot to put starched genes back on after trying to mutate again and lost marsupial. Literally fell like I got punched in the gut lol
---
7 different vendors, 200 cap limit each taking 45-60 minutes excluding perks and faction unlocking to make selling as efficient as possible.
---
 Is that more clear to you now?  Unless you are a pleb, you are dropping "rewards" on the dirty ground, let alone junk. 
---
So much this. I just got the plan for the Prime .50 cal receiver, so I made a few steel runs, then hit lucky hole...and had to dump about 250 lead ore after I ran out of acid, but still had more lead scraps than I could possibly use. Less than a day later, after a few fissure prime runs with green thumb, I've got 13,0000 ultracite .50 cal rounds.
---
Would you sacrifice Thru Hiker?
---
An issue being you shouldn‚Äôt be forced into min/maxing, and if you do so you shouldn‚Äôt become like unto a one shot god
---
If you‚Äôre on xbox just make it so you ‚Äúappear offline‚Äù in settitings.
---
I have been self imposing rules to up the difficulty for myself, leaning hard into the RP side and intentionally using non optimal weapons and perks. It has been super fun for me. I made a post the other day about it looking for new build ideas which led to my new John Rambo character a shirtless no armor wearing crossbow, combat knife wielding grenadier with a little LMG thrown in who must rely on in world workbenches. Looking for other ideas if you have any.
---
Hardcore mode was in New Vegas on launch
---
All these people saying perk loadouts like that will solve the problem. Itll make it slightly less of an annoyance. Weapon weight perks and hacking and lockpicking perks should be passive *period*. At the very least the lockpicking and hacking, those are used *CONSTANTLY* so either I need to go and switch the perks out every 10 minutes or waste 6 special points at all times lessening my combat skills in favor not having to menu surf all the time. It's so annoying. It's the main thing keeping me away, all the perks that need management.
---
Recent tab i believe is the current players in lobby. Feel free to correct me if im wrong
---
The incessant card shuffling has made me feel not so S.P.E.C.I.A.L.  
---
Even Thru Hiker.
---
They used to stack until the patch in late december, so definitely an intentional change.
---
Robobrains don‚Äôt drop fusion cores any more. The best bet to farm them is to go to the places where power armor spawns and take the fusion core, then server hop. Endlessly. 
---
Thank you mate, it‚Äôs sad but very true. 
---
Well you can use it to block the entire server relatively quickly .. also useful to see who is on the server, but I hear you. Not sure griefers use it but I suppose they do.
---
Sure thing. Message me your tag and we'll take care of it.

I peeked in to see how bad. They were actually manufacturing their own controversies.
---
I know this is flawed logic to you, but disagreements definitely don't have to look like this.  I understood exactly what you were asking for, you chose to go back and try and make it a play on words. My stance will always be that players should be responsible for as much as they can be, as the game developer should be as responsible for putting out a good product. This game has its flaws, but if you can take action to prevent an undesired outcome, just fucking do it and quit looking for someone to hold your hand. If its legit enough, hopefully it'll get fixed.  Where we disagree is how severe this is in a long list of things that could use some development.

LifeHack: if plants get destroyed, you can scrap them and get all their materials back and replant it with 0 loss. Or better yet, scrap one plant and use it to repair another, if that plant was ready to harvest before it was destroyed, you will be able to harvest it after repairing, if you have the flora PER perk card you get 2x produce back and you can easily repair all your plants and get some extra produce for a small fertilizer cost.
---
I don't frequent this sub, I saw the rumor on r/all
---
Sounds about right
---
And they don't even carry explosive ammo!
---
I believe there have been less complaints so its back on the shelf for the moment. As soon as we begin making it an issue we care about you will see another change. I do think their resources are limited so that spend time taking care of issues we blare at them. 
---
Maybe the orbital strike doesn‚Äôt count as damage from the other player. Or you need successive hits on a players base to accrue a bounty and the orbital strike one shots most of your base? That is frustrating though. 
---
Those are fine for perk interaction but healing factor is bugged so it does not get the -55% from chems reduced and Speed Demon is bugged and negates any perks that give increased movement. 
---
Those are nice 
---
Pretty sure this would increase he number of griefers exponentially.

Youtubers would go crazy for the views.

Not to mention ev ur high level character that doesn‚Äôt have much else to do because they finished the majority of the content might just embrace this for kicks. Honestly I‚Äôm level 80 and there‚Äôs no more story quests for me so I might even decide to embrace the disease and go mental on some noobs for a change of pace.
---
All in all it sounds like a mechanic that would encourage more griefing. Kinda sounds like Fallout 76 on hard mode. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be a very popular playstyle.

I am ready to see a cave camp with super hero styling with a tamed mothman inside.

I haven't beat the game until I have a complete set of armor and a complete load out of weapons for my build along with every mod for those weapons......not duped and purchased in eBay.

If you're a naked melee build I could see where the grind would not be quite as time consuming.....lol.

No they really don't. Your one anecdotal time means nothing. I've watched bountied up people run around unchecked for months now.

Xbox one GT: THEGHEYWOLF117

Lately I've had a serious problem with movement.  I try to move forward and it's like I ran out of stamana and over weight.  My weight is 200 out of my Max of 245 and I can still run.  But when I stop running at any point,  I slow down to a snails pace.  I've looked all over for answers but have found none. It's making the game unplayable but I really love 76
---
bruh, that's serious business.
---
Did they not write in the latest Inside the vault that it Will be a mode acceptet at the start screen. That seems alot like a server pick to me, not a pick of event or quest that could be Done via the map or pip boy menu?
---
But i might remember wrong
---
Good call thanks
---
this is true. You just got to learn to let shit go. Do I need 400 screws? No I don't. Are they important, yes. But you will always find more. The 400 pound limit really got me used to this idea and I've had no trouble at 600. You just got to start dropping stuff you think you might need a week from now. You will find more.
---
How long ago did you get yours?  A lot of the initial posts about this event are a little older and I thought maybe a patch changed it.   
---
I wonder if they will do it after the first real content update. If you think about it, at the moment, there isn't really anything to do but horde stuff. If they put out challenging content that requires you to finally use or need the stuff you are hording then you can finally get back to scavenging. 
---
Right now the only real content is the SBQ and if the server doesn't crash you can do her 3 or 4 times before needing any repairs if you have a decent team or populated server. Couple that with most high levels having the cards to lower repair costs, increase armor/weapon health, double and triple the ammo crafted you just end up with a lot of junk you may need in the future but can't use fast enough now.  
---
The other day I was looking at my ballistic fiber thinking I should pull some out to sell because I have so much just sitting there but I know that's something I will absolutely need at some point because it's now woven into everything. 
---
I have never claimed to be smart, and never will, but I must be 100% stupid when it comes to the PVP aspect of the game.  Why force everyone into PVP? 
---
Why can't you have a "Create PVP character" option so anyone who has a PVP character can attack any other PVP character or base, etc. but no one else or anything owned by anyone else. (Or like others have suggested:  PVP server option)
---
 Can someone explain the science behind this type of play style?   ELI5.  I don't engage in it, and when some little asshat with mommy issues comes up to me and starts hacking me in the face for no reason other than the psychotic "I just wanted to" or "because it's fun bruh" reason - I just stop playing.  Log out and play something else that's more worth my time at the moment.
---
I want to play the game.  I want to explore, discover, and get to know the story lines.  I could give a shit less if it has PVP or not.  Even though I knew the structure of the game before I bought it, I don't understand the aspect and I don't support being forced into it.
---
With that being said, of course  I still play.  Of course I still love to log on and get to exploring and questing.  
---
I'm not going to give up and rage quit permanently just because I don't like one aspect of the game.
---
Only my 2 cents.  I come from playing WoW where you can only PVP if you flag yourself PVP (or join PVP server, etc.) - and that play style is so much more enjoyable to me.
---
That's a bummer. Yeah I had to close my app n come back on the fifth try. Lost my black titanium n springs I looted from a foul in the area. Wasnt pleased in the slightest 
---
What a jerk fest in the comments...
---
Even though most of your complaints and suggestions have been addressed before, you're right in most of them.
---
I think the issue is OPs is a little fast and didn‚Äôt take into account how the limits of paragon perks don‚Äôt really stop just filling up the now free space with more combat stuff, and your suggestion is a total 180 in the other direction being kind of limiting and boring.
---
I think if anything it should be a mix of both pace wise. Maybe Paragon Perk slots can be ‚Äúleveled up‚Äù? It starts as a slot for non-combat cards or maybe just any card but the trade off is it weakens the perk by a percentage, and as you level up the Paragon Perk slot the percentage gets smaller til it‚Äôs just a regular slot again, that way it feels like progress but isn‚Äôt just a flat OP slot.
---
Yeah I have completed every quest in the game except that one, the wendigo one which keeps reappearing, and I‚Äôm 5/10 on white springs golfers. Other than that I‚Äôve done almost everything in the game. There are a lot of other people saying the same thing as me on various other threads so I believe it‚Äôs a known issue. 
---
It's true that most of the random, game generated events don't attract large numbers of players. But the nuke drops, player created events, always draw a crowd. That's a pretty organically grown social situation and I'd like to see more dev focus on that kind of thing. Text chat would be a nice addition, but I think that's tough for console players.  And Beth can't do anything about it if you don't want to buy a headset with a mike.  And even if you have a mike maybe the other guy doesn't speak English.  It's happened to me more than once that I try to talk to someone and it's like they don't even hear me.  Maybe they're just ignoring me, but I think it's just as likely they don't understand. 
---
You can craft them, but they require flux so there's that .. good idea though like a water purifier, they could limit to 1 or 2 cores at a time with. slow charge
---
Oh don‚Äôt get me wrong I have 4 of the power armor I just don‚Äôt like using them and I don‚Äôt like armor because it takes up to much carry Weight. 
---
Not sure about the others but I like messing around in my CAMP or do some events on the map with randos.
---
I also like playing around with my Power Armour but until they allow me to display them like FO4 I will probably stop that activity for now.
---
I am taking a small break since a have a new looter shooter addiction with another game at present 
---
Not being over-encumbered and being able to fast travel at the end of a session would be nice, but those springs and screws aren't gonna collect themselves!
---
Yeah but from an RP standpoint...
---
That's boring as fuck. 
---
Bethesda is going to introduce player vending and everyone will be all "Yay! I can more effectively play a merchant"
---
With the bounty system players can effectively RP bounty hunters. I've come across a few really good rp'ing ones myself. 
---
You can RP a farmer very effectively. 
---
But RP a raider? You should get no tools, reward, incentive etc for doing so. For some reason, FO players don't like being on the losing side/short end of the stick side. Even if it's thematically accurate. Because the wasteland is hostile and unfair to everyone EXCEPT real players....
---
Because they all played 3, NV and 4 and min maxed the shit out of their builds so they dominated everything, and now that's their expected FO experience.
---
Sounds lame to me. All of my best experiences from this game have been from meeting cool people in strange situations.
---
I remember being a little girl and pestering my dad to let me play with the cool fantasy world on his computer. He bought me my own copy for the Xbox, and 12 year old me entered the world of Morrowind. üôÇ Bethesda‚Äòs been in my life for over half of it.
---
Bobbleheads are 1 weight each, and magazines are .25 to .5 each. I used to "collect" them all in my stash and never paid any attention to it. I freed up more than a hundred lbs out of my stash when I cleared my unused aid items. 
---
I still don't like it, but I like being encumbered with a maxed stash less. 
---
A month probably, maybe a little less.
---
There are pumpkin grenades in the game.
---
I hate all the voices on this game. I realized that is really what is wrong with the entire game. Lousy voices. 
---
Sixteen tons what do ya get 
---
Not a day older and deeper in debt
---
Does not effect perks.
---
It makes your inherent star lower, so if you have 15 of a stat and perk cards up to 15 you will be fine but say it‚Äôs str, it will lower your carry weight by 5
---
 Good Lord you are slow. Now its true my present is a plan whore on purpose. He was sent to get plans for my empire. He just turned 40. I can churn way faster than that. He is number three so far.
---
 Why would I drop anything other than ammo?
---
Also, it was the prison break event that worked for me, did both patrol and break events
---
some people just don't want to let shit go that they may need or just keep too much of the vital shit. Are screws good to have, hell yea. Do you need 500 of em? hell no.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any but I hope it‚Äôs soon because I love this game.
---
I do the same, but go one step further, instead of taking their Junk, I add to their bag, sometimes that includes Legendary Weapons if I have any lower level stuff.
---
I usually leave my purifiers unlocked, but had locked one a few days ago when a low level player picked it and became wanted, I killed him then put 50 purified waters in his bag.
---
Just trash the camp. If it can be placed there it is fair play. Unliked by many maybe but fair. So is trashing his camp.
---
I would trash the camp too because I agree it needs to be Done but its the game at this point.
---
Agreed you need to learn to let go.
---
I had this happen to me once.  It seems like the game must have lagged and I lost a bunch of mutations about 10 seconds after I used my radaway.  
---
Leaving the card equipped all of the time isn't really an option, if you still want to get more mutations.
---
Well, just think of the fatman as a melee weapon!
---
Idiotic response. First you roughly aim at the target and THEN hold breath for precision aiming.
---
Your name is my favorite!
---
Yep. I spent more time today crashing and trying to load back into Whitesprings than I did actually playing, seems like.
---
you dont have to if you dont suck at placing the nuke. Dont have to fight the queen inside a nuke zone
---
You stupid? Im not saying they are hard, the shouts dont do any damage to me
---
Exactly. The way that "nearby" fast travel happens between teammates has landed me in the middle of whitesprings while doing nearby, but unrelated to whitespring, quests.
---
I can‚Äôt build for crap. Everyone builds such nice house mine look like something from Minecraft or the ghetto from NY or something.
---
I agree, very much, w your last paragraph.
---
That's kind of the whole point. 
---
I love seeing this kind of organized RP in 76. It's a really great game for doing these kinds of things. 
---
I'd join up, as my recent character was going to be a crazy old lady who thought she was a cowboy from an old spaghetti Western. But opportunity made her a crazy old lady who thought she was a WW2 soldier and that Super Mutants are actually Nazis.
---
Yes, but it wasn't broken at the time? Just a bit further down in this thread I mention I haven't been attacked yet. In fact, 98% of the people I meet are super nice. I was on my last low lvl toon last night building my house when I noticed just down the road from me another house was being built. Went to go poke around. The guy waved to me from his roof, jumped down opened the door removed his traps and gave me a tour before he could even tell if I was friend or foe. Nice dude, 10/10, would visit neighbor again.
---
The perks are needed to do any of the quests in game. They only give access to extra low to mid level loot and resources. Seldom rare.
---
So really there‚Äôs not much need to make these passive. 
---
The carry weight has never been this severe.
---
No, that is not me. I am a console pleb haha
---
Each armor is of a different tier level 1-4 and Power Armor they can all be modded to get better. Marine is the best armor at tier 4 but you need to buy or learn the modifications to make it better 
---
I whole-heartedly second the request to see what plans we already know.
---
Drop a bag of stuff in the middle of the floor. It's what I do. 
---
I have tested. They arent player locked. I've also found items in them before. I make sure however to remove my bottled water and dog food gift before using it as a stash for others. I dont know if that matters. 
---
I figured it was impossible and gave up. Kudos for having perseverance!  
---
You can also block, or block for a session. 
---
I had someone drop a bag with a Nuka Quantum in it.
---
Okay that's freaking awesome üòÇ love that! And hey! We don't discriminate, old lady soldiers are more than welcome.
---
I had also heard that that combo was no longer going to drop either... Which... If that's true, the only ones actually getting the short end of the stick, are those of us without a TSE...
---
I hope it's not true...
---
In the mess of YouTube hate towards fallout there is a channel of a guy experimenting with launching nukes at different areas on the map. Don‚Äôt know the channel name but shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find and worth a watch.
---
Well if you come across any 3* Marine limbs with unyielding let me know. Right now I have Trapper left arm an left leg with a Leather right leg a marine chest and a Marine right arm...... it's a disaster and I can't quit looking like this.
---
No, sorry. More of doubting there not being a limit because of what people would do. My bad
---
If you get one of the Atom Shop Paint jobs and use it on one of them it will be identified in your inventory with a little atom symbol
---
Thanks for sharing this, I was curious how it worked.
---
Thank you :)
---
Doesn't make sense to just chuck documents in a hole in a wall. Couldnt we use the landing pad to call in a drone to send the documents out?
---
I leave behind a bag with one molotov cocktail and a bag of fertilizer. 
---
I'm going to provide a counter argument, and say that I believe no matter what the S.P.E.C.I.A.L limit is, I think the urge to swap in and out of cards to be efficient will remain for many people.
---
For instance, I have 11 points in Intelligence, which isn't amazingly high but it's a good bit. I'm constantly swapping cards I don't need 24/7 in and out. There's not very many terminals in the game (at least, not many compared to locks for lockpick) so Hacker is something i never have on unless I find a terminal. I never have Weapon Artisan on unless i'm about to do a repair. I don't have Chemist on unless i'm crafting chems. Etc.
---
 If I had say, all 15 points of Intelligence, I still don't think I would feel compelled to leave any of those in, when I know I can swap in perks that have perks that are constant and not just situational. Yeah it's tedious to swap in and out and in and out, over and over again, but i'd still probably be doing the same even with more SPECIAL slots, because I know that if i do micromanage I can make the most of the cards I have.
---
I do agree with you though, that I too think we should get more points to deal into our hand (especially when DLC with higher level content comes out) but I don't think that'll stop the micromanaging phenomenon.
---
but if you do the quest to get rad shield  which is a extra 100 resist over rad-x at 300 does not suppress mutations and lasts longer.
---
I think if you scroll down you may be able to see some of the players from past servers.  Not 100% sure though. I saw a lot more then 24 when I checked, but that could have just been players coming and going.
---
Max out the perk that reduces the penalties for mutations  plus starched genes. Then you won't have the issue with food from having Speed Demon and can take some other mutations with other benefits with hardly any penalties. Like as someone said Marsupial for +carry weight. There's one that gives +Str which will help with carry weight. There's one that turns you invisible when you aren't wearing armor (and there's a legendary effect for armor that makes it not count as armor for this mutation), fast healing means you'll use a lot fewer healing items since you'll regen between fights.
---
We need mailboxes that hold like 5 items tops. Use a camp, leave a gift
---
What system are you playing on? I have yet to run into such things like this I'm on PC.
---
Upvote for capped at.
---
They do, just not 100% now
---
I wouldnt say she is easy to solo, and very seldom do you not have anybody pop into the event with you. You need to know what your doing, the OP is just alluding to the fact you dont need a tse to kill the queen.
---
Most of my big group failures, 2-4 people are on the queen doing damage, a couple people are just standing around having an emote orgy, one tool is jumping infront of anyone with an explosive weapon and a half dozen people are hiding or gathering.
---
She is overall not that tough of a fight IF everyone is dps'n the queen and/or taking care of ads on the ground.
---
My thought exactly. It does have issues with being OP ,yet its not so different than the maximum potential already in game if you dedicate to just one build and cards.
---
There were three of us that did it but the dude literally followed us out after we tried blocking him for session but he was still busting our camps down. I‚Äôll mess with it tonight and see if your suggestions work though, thanks guys!
---
Alas on PC. I only found this one recipe/plan. It dropped off a scorchbeast queen.
---
They're really cool. Wish u had put a hint of orange in the mire one though. I love those vines most of all. 
---
Oh ok. I thought they didn‚Äôt drop them at all. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Know you drugs and thier effects. Keep some booze or a buffout or some bufftats on hand for those occasions. üòâ
---
this game isnt or babies or the weak, go play fallout 4 until they come out with the next single player one if you are really that soft. Had the same thing happen to me and lost a lot, it was a laugh and part of the game
---
7600 Atoms sounds like a better reward at that number.... and also something to look forward to instead of gently being slapped in the face for having no life
---
You‚Äôve yee‚Äôd your last haw 
---
When my level 10 character appears at top of the world, I'm mauled by level 68 scorched. 
---
'
---
When my level 181 character spawns in Grafton, I'm getting shot at by level 15 mutants. 
---
I don't think there is any truth to the player's level influencing the enemies who spawned.  
---
Idk we‚Äôve seen people in there that we had played with anywhere from a few hours to a few days past
---
Maybe, thanks for clarifying that for me.
---
I really think they hope we'll forget
---
What are you even talking about? You can‚Äôt stand what, that there are people out there who actually expect a game that had real thought put into its core mechanics? 
---
Not blowing their shit up is usually a good place to start
---
That's it. We've got our saying for when we contract kill someone.
---
I have no problems with it because I have 505 carry weight 
---
Armor make the owies hurt less. Bigger numbers is less hurt, less hurt is longer life.
---
i can name several reasons, but your attitude is why im no longer going to respond to you.  good luck out there
---
Honestly I think we all really need another stash limit increase. If we had 1000 limit that would be perfect, Id easily manage my inventory and wouldnt have to carry most of my big guns with the bear arms perk just so theres room in my stash. Im sick of losing good legendaries to the void to manage this too. I wouldnt need a lot of my weight reduction perks equipped if we had another limit increase, Id be happy with only 3 guns on me at a time with everything else stashed away.
---
Thank you! I was Googling why I had - on my agility with nothing in my stats to explain it. I was addicted.
---
Butcher pete.  
---
Hea gonna hack. Hes gonna whack. And he‚Äôs gonna chomp that meat. 
---
Or even better.... You shouldn't be able to swap perks on the fly. Only at workshops and camps. 
---
It's thematically breaking for your player to not only be an expert at 900 things but have the ability to change those expertises on the fly. 
---
"Don't worry guys, I'm a heavy weapons, demolition, ninja , weapon smith, thief, armour smith like, ninja field medic..... And if you give me a few moments I can also be a pro star hacker"
---
No harm in taking a break.
---
theres a one person dupe method as well involving the camp, don't see it posted anywhere and i found it accidentally. 
---
Condition and mods determine Caps value.
---
Shield is physical and ballistic defense. Lightning is elemental: fire and energy.
---
Leather good against elemental, like robots. Metal good against physical, like ghouls. Then there's other armor that have radiation resistance as well, and jack-of-all-trades.
---
Armor penetration is needed against generally tough enemies, like Deathclaws and Super Mutants.
---
When you scrap an armor, you have a chance of unlocking mods to that armor type.
---
Legendary mods stack stack additively (e.g. +15% x2 becomes +30% total).
---
Any gun build without Bloody Mess is incomplete.  It multiplies all damage modifiers.  
---
Me gusta mucho esta idea
---
Have you not encountered server issues, possibly due to duping? 
---
Spoiled meat
---
Spoiled vegetables
---
Bloodbug probiotics
---
Raw fertilizer

Salt
---
I get the little joke for the 'play for "76" amount of hours... But i think theres just a bit too many zeros at the end of that number.
---
I dont think ive ever played a single game amounting to 7600 hours before. Let alone 760...
---
Bethesda.. Who put this here?!
---
Everytime i leave lobby my recent tab is empty..
---
Ok what would you recommend in swapping in and out 
---
I wasn‚Äôt really with you until you mentioned the part about dying inside. ‚ÄúHAHA I have died, now let me load the map outside- ok excellent. Now to trek 600 feet through mobs and rocks. Now that I‚Äôve reached the door let‚Äôs initiate the next loading screen! I was only in here 30 fucking seconds ago! Let‚Äôs load it twice!‚Äù  Lol sorry for the long rant but it has been bothering me for a while too 
---
I mean. I could... I just tend to go to low hanging fruit where I don't get attacked for resources. Maximum gain for minimal loss. Nothing is worse than having to scounge for lead and then running out of steel. 
---
\*Another day older
---
I'd love that but it'd be 
---
A. Exploited at least I would use it to spawn at modus until I got the x-01 mods I want (I'm sure people would find other ways to more maliciously exploit this)
---
B. Tracking exact spawn points for millions of players seems unfeasable for thier servers given the current disconect rate.
---
So yeah it'd be nice but unacheivable
---
Most likely you either currently had or recently had a workshop claimed.  When you claim a workshop anyone in the server can go to the workshop to try to 'take' it from you.  However if they just trigger this (paying the cap cost) then exit the green circle, they have started pvp with you and are able to go to your base, level it, find you, kill you as often as you want to respawn with their tse shotgun as often as they like until you block them and change servers.  (note it could be just they have a really powerful melee build and one shot you in other ways, including instigating sniper rifles ect...).  
---
The only thing that doesn't make sense is that you should not have gotten a bounty from shooting him in this case.  Unless you used something that could have hit something ELSE and gotten a bounty or chased him to his camp?  Not sure, did you record this at all?
---
SAME
---
Sorry.
---
I use a knife in farm zones and run in circles around legendaries until everyone hits it. Any suggestions of nerfing my Explosive or Two Shot weapons because of inconsiderate TSE users in farm zones infuriates me.
---
As a solo player end game weapons aren't a 'crutch' for me......they are what keeps me playing.......they are what I spent 300 hours grinding for.
---
Yes right by harpers ferry there is a thunder mountain substation just north east of that it a road and a railroad track there is a "random" spawn point on both u will know ur in the right spot if u see broken train car 
---
In game settings? We typically don‚Äôt have this issue when playing online, it‚Äôs just when someone‚Äôs feeling spiteful I guess lol. 
---
Silly goose. That's never going to happen. Even if it does, it'll most likely be in a year or two once we get private servers and bethesda opens it up for mods. Those mods will give you what you want and you'll most likely have to make a new toon for your private server anyway.
---
Outside of dropping or selling, the only thing I can think of that does not fix after a restart is the "feed the people" event. I have seen a few posts like this that were resolved from relogging. Hopefully that's the case with you.
---
Also, he doesn't care whose meat he chomps. Clear advantage.
---
I didnt know the gun was loaded she was a crackshoy since she accidentally killed them all
---
&gt; Because I interact with a lot of them. When someone stops to ask you a question about the game, a starter quest or such, they probably aren't an alt. 
---
Fair enough. 
---
&gt; If you want the game to succeed, stop trying to rain other others parade. You totally come across as the game is a complete failure. 
---
All I said was that, at least at this point, the game is a technical and commercial failure. And that's just true. It's not a complete failure (a la Lawbreakers), but it also hasn't exactly been a success. And I really don't see how the opinion of one random stranger on the internet rains on someone's ability to enjoy the game. It's not like I'm on the game screaming into my mic about how bad it is.
---
&gt; I'll show you how you are. I said I'm enjoying the game. So are others. 
---
&gt; You try and turn that into a minority by saying, I don't know if I'd call having more than one person enjoy the game "a measure of success".
---
Okay, I admit I was being a bit pedantic there. I stand by my point about AAA games having higher expectations, and even though you (and others) enjoy the game, it's safe to assume the game hasn't come close to meeting those expectations, but that specific comment was dickish. My bad. 
---
&gt;@falloutsearch
---
And there is is:
---
 https://twitter.com/FalloutSearch/status/1087747499652071425 
---
Exactly. That said, there is still a max combat card combination. It would increase the over "max damage" most likely, but they could rebalance accordingly. Most damage builds already have a "max" combination that is already completely reachable. 
---
Example being
---
-3 heavy weapon non explosive damage (9 points)
---
  ( Please please correct me if I'm wrong)
---
Outside of this the other cards for heavy are to increase durability, damage resistance, add a charge and carry weight. 
---
The cards i see being PP are only bear hands (carry weight). Not changing much overall since that can already be achieved through inventory management.
---
Farm around north of bolton greens area looking for wolves. Ash heape around west of firehouse has wolves. I believe wolves drop explosive firearms.
---
DLC??!! hahaha. We dreaming. Its going to be a long time.
---
I believe they are like any box you find out in the open. Each player generates their own specific loot from the game but the container itself functions openly when players put things inside. 
---
Last night I used the overseers camp cache to give a level 7 some plans and they did indeed get them. So it works. 
---
Thanks for sharing this. I was going to buy it.
---
I play with two other guys and we all play on Xbox but maybe that‚Äôs our problem lol. 
---
Im curious too. I hope Bethesda hasnt just assumed we forgot. It really is getting tediously difficult to manage, we need that increase.
---
Yes, but I had a sniper rifle, the slowest firing weapon available, and it repaired constantly.
---
Just bad luck?  Cure, could be, but it "seems" legendaries are lower or bugged.
---
This is a great resource. Thank you!
---
These, plus a "no mic" emoji.
---
Same here one day I found I had like almost 300 asbestos. 
---
PM me if dude shows up again. I know a few guys who look for those kinda players and they‚Äôll wreck his ass for kicks.
---
Assuming you‚Äôre on Xbox that is
---
Not everyone who plays is a dick. 
---
Drop crit savvy.  Four leaf clover will do a decent job filling your crit bar. Or drop clover and keep savvy and test the difference. 
---
Not any more, I don't think.  But when I was low level and short on mats or in a long fight in the field without resources to repair or a bench, it was golden.
---
I didn‚Äôt know whether it was another day or not a day.
---
What you are saying is already known. boring is just an opinion and it's yours.
---
did you figure out everything for yourself... no (obviously). so it wasn't easy for ya it was easy for the collective community. Maybe it's your own process, maybe it's your lack of faith in yourself.
---
lol Guy I don't know what to tell you except that survival mode didn't come out with the game lol. that a much harder game probably would have been even harder to get through the glitches. honestly I don't know what to tell you. If all I have done is prove your point then what are you arguing. I have been saying it's way too easy since day one, because I am used to survival.
---
Maybe if it is so easy you shouldn't be complaining about TSA or anything. you should be telling bethesda that you specifically want to wait for survival servers. because right now, to me, you are flopping like a fish.
---
you know I've not actually finished every little thing in the game there is still much I am excited for. If you could not tell the games plot isn't supposed to just be a fun adventure but that it was even supposed to emulate the difficulties and tediousness of restarting america, You played the game wrong. you didn't read enough, you didn't walk enough. You didn't play by yourself or even  with friends enough. 
---
if people in the game were never supposed to have infinite bobble heads, if this gun isn't supposed to be wielded as much, it's an economy problem.
---
damn straight you need balance, I'd no longer like to engage with you publicly. however I will fight in you game. gl n hf, more importantly for you breath in 1, 2, 3, breath out 1, 2,3.
---
if you cant do anything in this game for yourself nor can you appreciate what these cheaters did  (i respect that); it doesn't mean the game is bad. and honestly dude if you aren't able to talk about the issues without damn the lot... why are you here? Bethesda can rebalance and make change after change. but they aren't gonna give up. Will you? because it is just a game.
---
Definitely this is the case now, thanks!
---
Players not having stuff to do are now waking up for the sad reality that trophies and challenges are. Most are bugged.
---
I stopped bulking because the game using mods for scrap first, maybe after that change next patch. Does not help that most bulking is just number of items + plastic = bulk weight.
---
You have to be a hoarder to play Fallout 76 lol. Crazy inventory management in this game. I feel like a literally need it all, only lvl 26 or so atm so i hold on to everything cause i don't know if i'll need it or not in the future.
---
You can do the same as them right now so it is fair.
---
lol
---
Well, Im sorry to hear that. I usually build spontaneously, without thinking too hard about what am I actually about to build. And Im usually very satisfied at the end of the day. It doesnt really matter to me if what Ive built actually looks good, as long as I had fun building it. I hope that helps, tho I understand building might not be so much fun for other people. Depends on your style. Also you could maybe start collecting something in the game. I love collecting different outfits for example :)
---
Ok thank you!
---
I'll have to look up some random spawn locations and try this one. 
---
the youths. 
---
Wallace with a soothing voice?!
---
Can you point me to one piece of evidence from Bethesda that in any way implies this game is going F2P?
---
YouTuber speculation does not count
---
Also, No Mans Sky had a very similar problem. That game didn't go F2P and it was from a company far less equipped to deal with low sales numbers.
---
Goddamn fags complaining like fags do. What can ya do? Just sit back and read all these faggy requests from all these fags.
---
Unless you have some sort of reset system for a character (like diablo seasons), you will end up pretty OP after awhile. Personally I feel that leveling up should give you some Atoms and that getting passive perk slots should be tied with other actions such as the vault opening stuff. It could work like the warframe exilius slots and be a mod that can be added to your character.
---
Get the better inventory mod from nexus mods that Juicehead talks about on YouTube. It shows the individual item weight with the total weight of the stack in brackets.
---
Its possible.  But it would need to be fixed and added content for that. 
---
7600 shiiiiiit.  Looks like they had alot of faith behind this game.  Lol. 
---
I enjoy this game, but at this state i dont see myself playing it that long.  
---
Ive put 3k + hours on a game i loved for 2 years.  
---
Stash having a built in weight reduction on certain things (Bulk, I‚Äôm looking at you!!) would be nice
---
Next to nothing costs 10 of anything.
---
Not to mention Bethesda likes money too much to go f2p. They'll stay b2p for 76
---
It's not broken and works just fine. When you log in while wearing it, it gives you a bonus 100 carry weight (200 total).
---
Mostly due to balance issues. I can definitely imagine an argument for either way.
---
I simply feel this would slow the power spike from extra cards, extending the end game slightly more and adding a sense of ease to the later levels rather than power.
---
What about Phoenix? He kicks the butt of his own kind for the greater good!
---
Fuck that. 
---
My junk farming is quite lucrative. I don't give a fuck how many weapons and armour you people want to hoard. Don't fuck with my springs, screws and gears.
---
yep, diluted and rad shield don't surpress mutations
---
I am a purger.  I also have a bf who has more time then me and he built my house and everything so i have no idea how much building materials i need for the house.  
---
I go on my rounds and sell as much stuff i collected but dont really need anymore. I liberally use the magnify glass and only pick up that junk, if a weapon doesnt interest me it is scraped or sold.  I still picl up duct tape and adhesive on habit.  Glass and asbestos are the things i sell the quickest.  I am almost ready to go to better armors (i have them all using evacuator now) and start upgrading them.
---
I am sick of so much management of resources when i only want to kill stuff
---
But did you spawn them or were they already there before you arrived?
---
The mobs dont despawn until they are killed or the server crashes.
---
Harpers Ferry is one of the easiest places to test this as its a small zone, the fort where you turn in technical documents is another.
---
Have a friend join your world so you can easily return to your test world, use your high lvl to wipe all the mobs, your friend or anyone else cant be near harpers. Switch toons and swap to your alt, all the enemies in HF will scale to the lvl of your alt upon you loading that zone. Log out and back into your main and you will note the mobs are still at the lvl spawned by your alt.
---
And they‚Äòve managed to turn No mans sky in a f*cking awesome game because they didn‚Äòt absndon it and I hope Bethesda will do the same 
---
You're having a very different issue from OP. OP is getting rekt by world bosses, you're failing to feel the level of rekt you should from world bosses. Consider making a thread for it specifically, it's definitely something Bethesda should know about. Most people just complain they attack too quickly and kill too fast, to which I can only really say:
---
Git gud.
---
God, viewing by new is such a dumpster fire lately
---
Tip. If you're Hugh enough level. Then go to whitesprings. I can 1 shot sentry bots with a critical. If you can do that kill them from far enough away and then rush in and loot them. Usually you can't loot whitesprings bots but killing is them from afar and then quickly looting will let you take their fusion core.
---
Repeat this around the golf course and pick up maybe 7 cores they won't be fully charged but still.
---
uh no shit?  Nothing I said indicates otherwise. Are you for or against it being automatic, cause I can't tell.  And you gave no reasons why it shouldn't be an option.
---
Oh, yeah obviously, but if you've got a good setup- and absolutely need to take it off for something (like Super-Duper?) make sure you check your status and wait after using anything that could potentially remove your mutations.
---
Rumored.
---
Not in stored tab, no.
---
Just blueprints.
---
I'll delete a few of the them and see what that does.
---
Regrettable.
---
If Ghouls (or anything really) are attacking you, they will also damage your weapon, and bashing deteriorates weapons quicker, Fallout has always been that way.
---
That is so true. They players that buy the game at launch are the testers. I mean thats what most of this whole subreddit is for. So Bethesda can see what we don't like and change it. While that is good they keep communication open and I believe the game is getting better its absolute bullshit everyone has to help them make the game better in the first place after paying $60 for a game that almost unplayable for a few weeks.
---
I was talking to somebody about this yesterday. I feel like sometimes you have to change it up. I doubt that you've literally done everything given you can create your own experience for the most part. But if you've reached that totality then there might now be anything you can do. 
---
Read the subreaddits and see what other people are doing, create a new character and start over on a new path, challenge yourself more, start teaming up. There really is a LOT to do in this game. However not everything is going to suit your taste and that might mean the end of the game for you. But only you can find that path really. 
---
I'm lvl 49 and find my self logging off more and more. But I've been pushing myself to try new things. Just ordered a headset with a mic so I can talk to people and team up. I had no interest in doing that until I started randomly helping people. 
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt really see that happening 
---
But there is still a trade off of being limited by what cards you have equipped.  If there were no PVP in the game, I'd be all for your idea, but there is (no matter how poorly it is implemented) and its already not really balanced.  
---
Now, players have to make the choice, do I sneak sniper?  Do I melee?  Heavy Weapons?  (No one uses energy weapons, so i won't mention it)  Power armor or no power armor?  Would Power armor perks be non combat?  Its seems like it would be throwing balance way out of wack.
---
You have the root of a good idea, but every 10 levels is way too fast.
---
I esp hate it when people hold 2-3 games as the industry standard for how bug free a game should be
---
What if for the T.O.W.N.S, we were assigned a plot in a pre-designated area of the map where PVP interactions are disabled to structures (possibly the empty unused area to the immediate East of Flatwoods). There would be a plot for each slot in the server and all plots have the same size (not just sq.ft. but equal lengths and widths). This would allow you to build in a plot and have it appear in your assigned plot each time you log in. An alternative to this would be you would travel to and claim the plot you want. If you attempt to claim more than one location, your old plot will be replaced with your new plot.
---
In addition to the plots there would be a centralized market area where you have a vendor bot assigned to you. The vendor bot would link with your S.T.A.S.H to allow you to mark items for sale and set pricing. If you happen to disconnect, no worries your inventory will be transfered back to your S.T.A.S.H.

Thoughts?
---
"Gaming news sites" and YouTubers.  They're basically preying on people's fears for clicks and getting everyone riled up.  
---
I prefer that as well.
---
While there may still be some micromanaging, a lot of it has to do with how many points they've made it just to have a functioning play time. 
---
Some crafting cards are also linked to weapon and armor durability. Of course I need those equipped all the time. 
---
The weapon strength cards are 9+points in their particular category to get max damage. Those are thru different categories so depending on play style you may barely be able to use some other great perks. 
---
Either make some things passively earned like lock Smith or durability or at least give a little more wiggle room. 
---
I can have a strong rifle or I can pick a lock... or I stop in the middle of fighting when I find a safe, lower my weapon damage just to open it up for some prewar money. 
---
I can have a strong melee weapon or my carry weight is ridiculously low. 
---
Those are what bother me most. I cant have stimpacks be more effective if I want my armor to not break. 
---
wait... if you take them they stay at camp?
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
That happens with anything you‚Äôre trying to repair or craft by the way
---
So if something isn‚Äôt working, just stash everything you need to craft
---
Yeah honestly for 20, it should have just been 76 hours.  760 should be a big deal. 7600 should get you an intervention.  
---
Same not really a fan of pvp
---
Same not really a fan of PvP
---
Take it back to Fallout 4 Perks and this game would be so much more fun to play. After level 50 leveling up doesnt really mean much anymore. And the perk packs are just useless repeated cards.
---
Oh, I go out of my way to slaughter Radstags and Brahmin to make the grilled meats for carry capacity, as well. I'm training on weapon mods and trying to collect for excavator armor, so I regularly will end the night almost +200 past if I'm not lucky enough to be near a bench for breakdowns.
---
I have definitely done the drunk travel enough to need Addictol...
---
I don't get hit that much trust me, not enough for my gun to break within &gt;10 minutes 
---
Carnivire + Cannibal = You can just eat the whole world!
---
With these two equipped it mean every single thing in the world (except robots) become eatable. Combine this with the doubled effects and the ability to not catch diseases from uncooked meat that comes with the mutation means you never have to worry about food again or even carry around any on you as you can just eat on the spot without even cooking.
---
Kill everything, eat everyone :P
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a (light) survival game.. constant inventory management and not being good at everything is kind of the point!!
---
The content they release is unbelievable. 
---
The scale of it adds entire new gameplay elements.
---
Nice comment, friend! I love inhabiting a world where I can stumble into a nearly impassible hostile situation! The less predictable, the more I enjoy it. I tend to not play maximized threat neutralizing, in favor of just being able to survive, to occupy the threat until I see fit to evade or call in teammates to clean up the mess. This game presents the varied challenge level- the way it spawns the enemies and at what power level leaves you guessing, and creates the situations that are fun, helping the newer people / defending them against the encroaching threat. 
---
&gt;I do think Bethesda is trying to make it right, so it will be interesting to see what the future holds for 76.
---
This is why I'm still holding onto the game. I played at launch to about level 35 and haven't picked it up in several weeks but I've been following the changes and I'm about ready to give it another go. 
---
I agree, fewer, but better. 
---
My brother and I too just started and we have yet to be grieved yet. Everyone has been friendly and helpful!
---
Only problem is sometimes a high level player comes and all of a sudden I‚Äôm fighting level 72 super mutants and radscorpions. Wasting all my ammo and atom packs just to run away.
---
Not sure I‚Äôm a big fan of this as I now run from high level players not because they scare me. It‚Äôs just the level 68 mosquito that I failed to notice over this hill......
---
I really don't like the idea of resets for this game because i feel it takes away the sense of an individuals adventure and their continued struggle over time.
---
 I do like your idea though, warframe has a excellent long term strat and ide love to get some atoms for leveling more.
---
You can add an atom shop paint job to one of them, and it will show a little atom symbol next to it in your inventory.
---
I agree. It‚Äòs basically No mans sky 2 now 
---
There was a post on the front page of reddit that said stores are removing copies from shelves, and there are rumors that it is going to go f2p.
---
I do not have anything from bethesda, but by the time they announce anything it will be to late to voice our opinions.
---
Notice I said "if" not "when".  I hope these are just rumors, but let's not pretend like this would be the 1st bad thing bethesda has ever done.
---
Bethesda games track more unique items than any other game out there.
---
The issue isn‚Äôt items that stack, like bullets and scrapped junk, it‚Äôs items that can‚Äôt like armor and weapons. That‚Äôs because the number of stacked items is an object property value and there‚Äôs zero difference data difference between 1 bullet and 99,999 bullets.
---
The weight limit represents a worst case scenario for how many unique items we can have. Yes, notes and tapes are weightless but they would have been taken into account.
---
And this isn‚Äôt a 76 issue, every game since Morrowind would stsrt experiencing slow downs if you had too much stuff stored (at least when accessing the container). 
---
76 suffers worse from it because it has to have every container‚Äôs contents ready for every player at every location, to some degree. Older games just based what they did on where the sole player was and what they were doing. The engine had to be radically reworked to function as multiplayer.
---
In short, the comparison to Indy games isn‚Äôt fair.
---
Huh weird. I‚Äôll look into it tonight!
---
Yeah. There'll be the same monster type spawning after a nuke. So, area that had ghouls will spawn Glowing Ghouls. If that same area had Mole Miners, you'll get Glowing Mole Miners. And not every area have fixed monster type at all times.
---
As previously posted, the marsupial mutation will help, but I'm right there with you... 
---
I'm only 59, but MOST of the people cards I have equipped are for item type weight reduction.  I honestly feel that with the finite type of junk you can pick up, it shouldn't count against you're weight.  But that's my opinion.
---
I have recently found that I have a blast when meleeing the crap out of mobs and I would love to be able to put on some two handed perk cards... But I have a TON of weight reduction cards because I have so much stuff... 
---
What I'm planning on doing is just getting the 1* cards so I can at least get 30% more damage.  But unless I can take off the weight reduction cards without being over-encumbered and having to crawl to travel, I won't be ranking up any of them...
---
I DO actually sell A LOT of stuff... But the vendors frigging run out of Caps... For me at least, Caps are hard to come by so I don't want to drop anything that I could sell.  I'll even go through their aides, junk, notes, and ammo for anything I COULD use and buy just so I can sell some other stuff...
---
They telegraphed the unprecedented nature of this game. It was the big "E" on the eye chart.
---
 Killed my first at level 30. They are fun. ;)
---
 My lower level plan whore is CAMPed on the cliffs west of Watoga and has been running around there since level 13.  
---
nah. still happens to me and I upgraded to 2060 and 2700x
---
This happened to me and a bud doing it for his first time for quest as well. He didn‚Äôt even get a scorchbeast to spawn resulting in a pretty anti climatic finale to the BoS quests
---
I thought it was like nerd rage and other stuff that made bloodied so OP on melee. Or is bloodied equal for both melee and ranged for usefulness? Just trying to learn build info
---
Happened to me today, I was in Whitespring bunker looking for technical data and checking for X01 mods.  Stupidly, I switched servers to check again.  Game load took like 20-30 seconds, by the time I spawn I'm dead in a nuke zone.  Bonus : I couldn't respawn anywhere, Vault 76 wasn't available and Whitesprings service entrance was the only option but you can't respawn in a nuke zone.  So, long story short I lost quite a bit of junk mostly bulk in stacks of 10+).  This time it was a little my fault since I was lazy and didn't go to my camp before switching servers.  Of course the same thing has happened several times when it crashed trying to enter the bunker and I get put in a nuke zone when I rejoin.  I'd be ok with it if the no respawn bug was fixed...
---
I bought thr T51 jetpack from the BoS vendor in Watoga.  Wasn't even looking for it, but couldn't pass it up.
---
7600 is basically impossible.  316.6 days of playtime.  Even if the game was GOOD, and people played it for the next 5 years (hahahahahahahahahahahahaha) there would be very few to achieve that goal.
---
People would rather see fo76 die than go ftp. Odd... I will say it‚Äôs Probably best to wait until they make the game stable before a ftp relaunch.  Maybe after the first major dlc.
---
Cool thanks for the tip
---
a few sinple perks mean you could be swimming in 2mm or .308 etc ....
---
not so much shotgun imo .... that plastic value :/
---
The article was shit extrapolation from a shit clickbait youtuber. Youtuber took stuff completely out of context and threw it into a dumb narrative.
---
And thank god it won't. In no way does this game need LEGIONS of idiots trampling in for the "lulz" as they clearly have nothing better to do than bash a game they know nothing about...
---
Sorry to burst your bubble bro but this game was a compete failure. It‚Äôs literally about to be free-to-play. It‚Äôs being pulled from shelves. It‚Äôs trash. 
---
He took their jobs.
---
lucky! well thank you for the info!
---
On the recent tab, just click on everyone and block for session, they will all disappear from your map. It's a pain, but it is an option, that way you can disappear.
---
I agree, it's only a few ruining the experience for some of us ..when I am in camp I wear my chameleon armour and crouch so I disappear off the map, if people are approaching my camp especially if there are a few of them, I may block them for the session so they disappear ..
---
I had 3 guys in PA headed my way once, I am in the middle of no where so easy to spot, I crouched and they immediately changed direction. Not sure if they were planning on anything but why take the risk .. the fact they changed direction told me otherwise ..
---
I'm sure this has been mentioned in the comments already, but you can easily throw 3 points for STR to Pack rat level 3, Junk weight down by 75% then wear 5 pieces of armor for food/chem/water weights to be reduced by 100% and 2 more points into your STR for ballistic weight reductions. 
---
If your weapons are your bane of existence then I'd go with the weapon weight reductions for 100% on all 5 armors... there is even one for junk alone so you dont even need those 3 points into STR for pack rat on perk cards. It's all up to how you play.
---
[fake news](https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1087775312849571841?s=19)
---
It is hard. I think I was level 25 and died a lot. Stash your junk, dont use stimpacks and keep running for it. Or partner with someone who can help. What platform are u on
---
He's hoarding the good loot for himself. 
---
Cool! I was always unsure of containers, I originally thought they were instanced to the player, but after finding player loot in a few I had to rethink that position.
---
Now im onboard with your thinking that once you remove the "stock" items from a container it can be openly used by all.
---
I have an open world container in my Camp radius that I use often for leaving ammo+plans I dont need or use, ill be making sure to take the loot out before i put my goodies in, thanks.
---
Yep, I knew it was just a bunch of BS clickbait that people were throwing around.
---
If you remove starched genes before the radaway finished working, it can still remove a mutation. The card that makes chems last longer can really mess you up if you're in a hurry.
---
Lmao! Holy shit, I was saying this to my buddy the other night. I was like ‚Äúdude, these security bots keep kicking the shit out of the Phoenix bot, what gives?‚Äù 
---
I can't tell you how many times I've wandered too close to someone else's Brahmin.  Without raising my gun to it, the name turns red and the camp turret's start shooting at me.  Even people on my own team, who's turrets can't hurt me.  They just fire endlessly, causing a raucous.  All because of an overly sensitive cow.
---
stimpacks weight too much... right?!?
---
I've had three times this happened. All three times the inventory said scorchbeast hide and that's it. I did not wait more than a few minutes to see if it would change. Disappointing to throw so much ammo at her for just a cheese sandwich.
---
I was around level 22/23 and did it shortly after a nuke event by sneaking and luck. helps to know where everything is before going in so you can dip in and out relatively quickly 
---
This is a great idea. Give this man a star! Bethesda, adjust course! 
---
I had to give up my full T-45 for no reason other than stash space.  Felt like putting a pet to sleep.
---
You can still get diseases from spoiled meat tho. But I run this build and it's great. .
---
LuLz.
---
Happened to me damn near in that same location.  I stopped building where they spawn, and started hiding my base.
---
How is this not downvoted into the ground?
---
Seems SO many posts that pretty much say the same thing but this one is the one that resonates with people?
---
Yeah, you have to make trade-offs. No, the weight-reduction perks should be passive. No, there should be a separate pool of combat and survival perks. You can totally make a 100% min max damage build. Your price for that build is how much everything weighs and how little you can take with you.
---
Seems fair.
---
Not fair to compare Indy games to triple A producing studios?
---
While totally seeing your point i have to agree to disagree. To me this doesn't feel like a game that should ever be balanced around pvp - unless they make dedicated pvp servers and pvp server characters.
---
It might seem fast but with the recent whitespring nerf i honestly don't think it is. It would be 50 levels before you could even have crafting with reduced weapon breakdown as part of your complete kit. If you add the increase carry weight perk and medical supply weight, that's 130 levels to get 3 bonus perks finished.
---
I'm on Xbox one 
---
Just left of the front door 
---
Haha i think if you get to 7600 hours gametime, you shouls get a unique code for a real life sized, shipped to your house Vaultboy statue.
---
Racism 
---
You can use the pumpkin grenades.
---
Heavy gunner here, but i sometimes run around with my vampiric handmade, just for the lulz. Fire in the hole and grenadier are not needed in my opinion. You get a feel how the grenades fly with time, and the blast radius of your grenades (should be regular nuka grenades, quantum ones are bugged) is large enough. The only thing in strenght you need is bandolier rank 2 in my opinion.
---
Other weight reduction perks are quite useless in my opinion. Workbenches for scrapping and stash boxes are never really far away. You could take 11 strenght points out and put atleast 5 of them into intelligence, so you can have weaponsmith on all times, so your weapons degrade slower.
---
In agility, i would take out white knight and only slap it on when i repair my armor, togheter with the perk in intelligence which let¬¥s you repair your armor to 200%. Also, adrenaline rank 5 is a must for me, maybe take out marathoner too for that. Your action point refill fast enough with action boy/girl.
---
I also would dumb some more points into luck, for things like starched genes, class freak, luck of the draw. You know, the good stuff. Bloody mess is a good pick, something i see every good build. 
---
You should consider to slap fireproof rank 3 into your build and mod your armor chestpiece with dense. This way, scorch bitch scream attacks don¬¥t do any damage anymore. I will level my second character the next couple of days, which i want to play just like you. (semi auto non vats build, not a fan of vats either.) 
---
Unfortunately you'll probably have to go in with a team around your level, or keep server hopping until you land on a WS that doesn't have any high levels roaming (not as hard to find as you might think).  If you do the later, as soon as a high level pops in, a wave of big baddies will follow.  Just the nature of the beast in that area.
---
The 7600 hour achievement I thought was more for a way to track your hours played than to actually get the atoms for. There is no other way to check. 
---
If u need one I can give it to u, have like 5 of these things. I‚Äôm on PC
---
IG: NikDerBoss 
---
Eh. It also isn't hard to find things to critque in the game... Its quite buggy.
---
I have very mixed feelings about it but am not willing to write it off just yet.
---
People are definitely making mountains out of molehills though. 
---
The other bots think they are better than Phoenix, in reality they're not. 
---
It works very well for me, but I don't use any full Auto weapons, and it will only trigger on a hit.
---
It will repair a weapon up to 200% if it's already over 100%, but if it drops below 100%, then it will only take it back up to 100%, even works on Melee weapons.
---
I very seldom have to repair any of my weapons, but running a Stealth/Sniper build, I don't miss much either, like full auto guns do.
---
I really like them. The Ash heap is my least favorite, something feels off about it, but the rest are great!
---
Get out. Or get a buddy. At your level you should grind the ash-heap 
---
Exactly. It's extremely disheartening and unrewarding when you spent 2000 plus ammo only to check for some scorchbeast meat and non-legendary armor to load up
---
In for Xbox. Already got my own duster, hat, and lever action 
---
Here‚Äôs the thing. None of us can really state definitively if the game is failure both technically or commercially. 
---
An application having bugs or crashing isn‚Äôt a measure of how successful it is. Example, photoshop has been around for 30 years and it‚Äôs the top photo editing/ image creation software out there. Still has bugs, still can crash. 
---
The thing is, those didn‚Äôt stop it from functioning in ways that were successful. And I‚Äôve been using that software for 20 years. 
---
As long as the application works enough for enough people it‚Äôs a success at the start. It must continue to improve to stay there.
---
This game is improving. They are committed to improving and developing it. They have done a great deal in 2.5 months to improve it. A lot of which is driven by the vocal player base.
---
Second. We don‚Äôt know how much of a commercial success Bethesda needs for this. Sounds crazy but this maybe just what it seems. A test ground for further products. 
---
If they can develop the ability to make games where the players are each other‚Äôs content, that means so much. It‚Äôs a whole new game frontier. 
---
So maybe this game isn‚Äôt about making s certain amount of profit. Maybe it‚Äôs about really trying to learn about gamers. 
---
What gamers say and what gamers do, are often very different. We all joke about those I‚Äôm taking my toys and leaving posts because we all know they will be back. 
---
So Without real information, I really can‚Äôt have an informed opinion about those two measurements of success. 
---
It‚Äôs all guess work on our part.
---
But by doing some observation here and YouTube and articles, people are being surprised and excited about the game when those moments happen. And are starting to get involved and be part of making it happen for others.
---
Drop all your junk in your Stash. Get the ghouls attention and run the to the nearest robots, so the robots kill them. Repeat until all ghouls are dead. Sneak in and grab what you need before they respawn.
---
Level 115 or so and 265 hours in. I'm fairly positive i've found all map markers at this point. Each session i do my rounds of vendors to hit cap limit. Then it's off to a lap of generals stakehouse, watoga, and the antique store for a spin on the legendary wheel usually without much of interest. I have yet to do all of the various events that pop up and try to snag those when i can. Each session i usually find one new plan, mod, or legendary to stash until vending comes around. When bored i'll follow a road or tracks and see what random encounters come up and i'm still finding new ones. Lots to do but i'd like to see new locations pop up to discover or more misc quests added. 
---
This!  very few people understand the game mechanics, and the game is so easy you can be over level 100 without knowing the effects of dense or padded armor mods, or what scenarios make fireproof perk useful.
---
He thinks they're all nuts. Badum-ch.
---
Last time they threw a party? He bolted.  *groan*
---
I've been trying to think of a way to implement legendary mods that made sense. I like this. Gives risk, but flexibility
---
If you are on pc, I am using fusion cells, shotgun shells,  .44 and 10mm, I dont use everything else,  lets swap
---
How long does the stuff stay in place once you leave it?
---
I thought news sites we supposed to post/print credible news? My how things have changed.
---
Phoenix always wins üòä
---
Ok great tip!
---
I found stacks of them on both the Watoga vendors the other night.  Looked awesome.  So tempted.  Know where they came from though.  Hard pass.
---
I would like more storage, but that's only to satisfy the hoarder in me.  Why do you have so much junk?  If you're holding onto all the junk you're getting from scrapping weapons and armor, you could just not do that.  Really no reason to keep ALL the junk you get, and managing alts is pretty inconvenient in FO76.
---
I've been bulking all the junk I can (despite it not being as beneficial weight-wise as it should, just for organization) and limiting myself to 10 stacks of all but a few, and I limit non-bulkable junk to 50 or 100.  I hang on to extra ballistic fiber and screws, and some other stuff that requires a bit more effort to get, but I drop or sell the rest.
---
If you need more of specific junk, it would probably take less time to scavenge an area known to have it, or kill the right enemies, than it would to swap items around with your alts.  Plus that would be actual gameplay, instead of staring at menus.  I haven't run out of stuff for crafting, even with all the ammo I craft.
---
Deep Pocketed mods for my armor and Calibrated Shocks for my Power Armor has made it so I don't really need to waste the points on Strong Back and the like
---
Lol dude I totally will! I knew it was going to happen every once in a while but like getting stuff to make camps is hard as hell for me. Rebuilding/repairing every couple of days because someone demolished my house is a pain. 
---
He was joking
---
First problem to fix is allowing us to turn in more than one at a time.. It's rather annoying to find 3-4 in places but only getting credit for one. If they fix that, then we can see about turning in recipes and other plans.
---
Because it‚Äôs so fun I have a lot of faith that it will grow to accommodate both the role playing (filthy casuals) and meta hardcore type players and add ways for them to level as groups or factions and level up a base, and gain access to more permanent ways to impact the world and other players. 
---
I had the same faith in diablo. 
---
I appreciate your comments referencing fallout classic. As a player whose formative creative and gaming moments happened within fallout and a few other key classics, I can feel the way the makers of this appreciate what was classic in those settings. It‚Äôs a really fuckin high bar to aim for. I believe in them because they brought it to us in this state to gain player voice and keep striving for the highest greatness. 
---
They better fix this, all Atom Shop items are cosmetic only so they should work as the cosmetic clothes do
---
There is a raised area to the left of the golf club. Run there for safety. You can also hop onto the bushes and then onto the top of the wall too. (No mutations needed)
---
Same place lots of things they promised went, a black whole. I'm still waiting for the option to switch servers when my camp can't be placed. They promised that in a previous patch, and delivered a warning message instead. Like I wouldn't figure out my camp isn't there in two fucking seconds. Or 5 minutes depending on how long it takes before I can move my character after logging in. They also promised a list of all the known bugs and issues. Apparently that one is hard to make, because they keep adding more bugs in the game?
---
Anyway, stash size is still bullshit.
---
Lol they weren't even pictured I don't think, sorry for the confusion. They were a tad bit further back
---
What is wrong with you? You're not going to hold the line and hate the game out of principle?
---
You monster :P hahaha
---
Good on you for seeing past the biases of the "true fans" and finding some enjoyment out of the game for what it is, not what you wished it would be.
---
That is the longest pain in the A$$ quest... I'm 3/10 and killed hundreds there just only 3 with the golf outfits...lol 
---
Someone left a Party Hat behind in my garage one day.
---
Aw dude, you‚Äôre awesome for that offer but I‚Äôm on Xbox. üò¢
---
It's mostly just steel, so if you don't bulk that it mitigates most of the risk 
---
Thanks. I know it may be mentioned before. But wanted to wrap it up in a story to get a feeling of how the game goes for a player than me. And what cuts it down of playing more. With the goal of a better understanding and maybe attention to Bethesda. Well I failed as I can see in the comments and downvotes ;)
---
Oddly enough, this spot has only been occupied once since I built there.  It's been pretty nice.  And yeah, the volume isn't spectacular.  I still pick up lead I see all over the place.  But I run .45s though a lever so I dont expend a lot of ammo.
---
I think I know the SB spawn you're talking about.  Was it near a fissure site?  The first lead node I built on had that issue... after logging in 3 times, I moved camp.  It was such a nice place too, I built under a rock formation, it was awesome.  But the SB attacks were unreal.
---
I am not advocating the balance to be centered on PVP, but to at least consider it.  Right now, as long as you are 50, we're all at the same level (I'm level 148 BTW), your options are just greater as you increase.  So your idea widens the gap between a level 40, who is basically just 10 level behind a level 250, and that level 40 being 35 levels behind him.  
---
I just don't want to see high level bullies pushing lower level folk around because they are more powerful.  (I know it happens now anyways, but we don't need more of it)
---
Team up, throw a few grenades, hit lvl 50 before you even remember you‚Äôre lvl 23
---
Haha love it!

With the right charisma perks you can tame and pacify wasteland creatures and some can be sent to camp. Saw a guy earlier with a mirelurk king and it got me thinking if mothman was considered a creature or humanoid or what. It's either gonna be a mothman or snagglygaster
---
Probably the most exciting part of the game. When my character was level 12 I had my camp next to that little cave area in the north part of the forest. 
---
(At the time I didn't realize it was close to a scorchbeast spawn point) 
---
I still have fond memories of running for my life with those flapping wings thundering behind me.
---
I have the same issue sometimes, and jumping seems to fix it, just take a little hop, or a big one if using marsupial.
---
I've lost so many items, workshops, and events to this and after a lot of thought my conclusion is the cold, suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone.
---
Now that I'm mayor I love going I to Watoga and just murdering all the robots.  Especially when they are messing with my man Phoenix
---
sounds like you were working for a Duper
---
 He is BOS and the other bots feel inferior. He has to prove it over and over though.
---
 You can help him get rid of the attackers and then he will trade. ;) Watoga don't care. ;)
---
How to do high level content at ANY level: jump in a corner on something where the enemies can't reach you and spam grenades. If you're on PS4 I can make you some MIRVs which will REALLY do some damage
---
So in other words another promise made that isn‚Äôt going to happen. They‚Äôve sold us the same game three times and the one time they store items on their end and not client side storage it‚Äôs very limited. Oh well I can deal with the limit but they shouldn‚Äôt say there will be more size increases when there‚Äôs not going to be.
---
yup ran into this before. It was before I had ever taken down a SB and was a little afraid of it. lol In the end it was fine just cool to look at up close.
---
Well i kind of agree that it is annoying as hell but is that not the point? That i can not have it all, the dmg perks and the qol perks. If they change that why not just remove durability, thirst, hunger etc? I think it would go against all logic of the system to change it. And yes it sucks a bit to manage my weight when i loot too much crap. And i can not have blocker and all the dmg perks in str and still carry loads of big guns and ammo etc. its the game model... and it is tough, i know.
---
I can agree that swapping crafting perks, lockpick and hacker etc when you are lvl 200 plus and have every perk card you want and then some plus level ups saved. But I see it as a minor annoyance compared to other big issues.
---
I see what you mean but give competing perks (yes QOL perks compete against dmg/resistance in the system) for free would kill the investment in a build if it does not have draw backs.
---
Or they could go fallout 4 and just let us fart at any issue in the game after a while, which goes against the whole setup that was clearly presented Before i even got the beta.
---
But i agree it would be rather sweet to have more perks at the same time, for a while, then just dull to have less to calculate for and to weigh what is more important to me.
---
I didn't quite listen to rose that much and ended up wasting 2 and a half hours slowly climbing down the mountain cliff and shooting it with the scoped 44, needles to say that I was very embarrassed when all I had to do was just press E on it
---
that's sick. 
---
do they defend?
---
Too weak to waste time using unless a challenge requires it. Couldn't even one hit a level 5 protectron, with 15 strength in power armor. I'm also not invested in Melee at all.
---
That won‚Äôt stop them. They horde everything on alts who already can‚Äôt move because a similar system is already in place (though it‚Äôs based on some amount over your personal maximum).
---
There won‚Äôt be a quick fix for stopping duping because at this point it sounds like a problem at a fundmental level of the engine.
---
Then they need tools to examine inventories for ridiculously high numbers of items and ban the player and/or delete or convert the items into something else. Then they need a way to check whether a different player picked them up without knowing what made them. (Sometimes a duper will just dump stuff and not pick it up, and not every player knows about this stuff and may think it was a weird bug, there was a common bug (still happens occassionally) that massively duplicates stored camp objects, it‚Äôs not impossible to think the game did mass duplication by itself to a new player).
---
Hence why I personally
---
So you want  all the cards that Maxx out your damage but also on top of being virtually god like one shotting everything.. you want to be a pack mule as well... other than escavator armor and both leg upgrades +100 weight I would recommend hot swapping perks for a multi build.
---
It's apples and oranges if you're storing stuff on alts, dude. Not everyone has the luxury of either a second account or people who can help with trading to alts. For a lot of us, what we have in our character's stash and inventory is everything we have.
---
Tally up the stuff you have on mules and then come back and tell us you only need 500 stash.
---
No, sadly not. 
---
I have the built on recording turned off because of madden auto capturing every play that gains a yard 
---
Most of the game play is pve. You can get loot from all other places on the map without risk of pvp. If you want to claim a workshops know that ill be hunting you üòä. I will take your workshops and put up big fight holding onto itüòä. Not because i want the resources i could really care less about your loot. Simply for the pvp.
---
I‚Äôm approaching 200 hours playing it slow across multiple playstyles concurrently, I‚Äôm at 52, 29, 21, 16, and 8. 
---
I spend an equal amount of time daily talking to the people making great posts here, yours included. 
---
^^^^ O. M. G. THIS.  SO. MUCH.
---
Or let us convert mr handy fuel and like oil or steel into fuel. Or perhaps some recipie to down convert excess gunpowder into fuel. Or maybe convert coal into fuel seeing as how I dont think there is a recipie that uses it. Anything would be better than the way it is now.
---
Health based on base SPECIAL amount.  Pluses and minuses from mods, food, ect don't effect.  Just like how many perk cards you can apply. 
---
Adds or subtracts to disease resistance,  AP drain, ect. Only.
---
Treasure map dig...not sure which one but it's all random I'm sure
---
LOL You can hear him softly snoring. Poor guy. Must have had a long day.
---
It showed up at my camp in the middle of the map last night.  Killed it and got crap drops...stun packs and plain trapper armor.  Very disappointing. 
---
The stash limit is the single reason I‚Äôll eventually stop playing. I can deal with the bugs and crashes because the game is mad fun.. but I can‚Äôt deal with not being able to collect shit in a game about collecting shit. I also wanna toy with ‚Äúbuilds‚Äù and save up some gear sets and weapons for other builds.. but simply have no space. Using alt characters as mules is very much annoying and time consuming.
---
lvl 115 vats rifle crit build and ive never once experienced this issue.  only bringing this up to say how niche this specific problem is, and that they have much larger problems to fix.
---
LOL. You gotta kite em' if you can't kill em'. I've snuck low levels in there twice. ;)
---
Because he owns them.
---
I saw him drop a bot with one hit.....no super sledge.....no TSE.
---
Nice, now people can settle down. Not that I ever thought it was real.
---
Awesome, what's your gamertag?  I'll hit you up tonight.  I'll be on as well.
---
Ah I see. I play solo alot and have attempted to launch a nuke, but it's pretty difficult doing it alone. I guess I'm hoping to be such a high level that it won't matter and I can do it solo lol
---
Agreed, make it underarmor, we earned it getting through the quest line......
---
Ah. Thanks for clarifying!
---
this is one of the best things ive seen and heard ingame
---
Why does everyone keep complaining about pvp, it's not bad just needs a little tweaking
---
Why is nobody commenting about the fact that I‚Äôm eating like 10 fucking steaks a day and I‚Äôm still hungry in this game. Nobody ate that well before nuclear fallout.
---
Would be nice if all carry weight perks were tied to stats (Strength give Melee weight, Perception Rifle + shotgun  Weight, Endurance Heavy weight, Charisma Armor Weight, Intellect Junk weight, Agility Pistol Weight, Luck Explosives and Ammo.  Make it scale all the way up to 15 being 90% weight reduction and add some new perks in the existing weight perks places for more interesting builds (or some cross Stat perks such as one that required you to have less than 5 strength but over 10 perception and not wearing power armor that made you immune to nuke zone rads in relation to the requests to let hazmat be cosmetic or other changes to make non PA viable in the end game without gimping your stats).
---
Yeah I heard about this whole phantom budget business.
---
So I deleted blueprint and stored all component structures, then rebuilt.
---
Still seems small.
---
Hmmmmmmm.
---
Dunno.
---
I'll try some stuff.
---
Thanks for reply
---
Great assumption with no facts.
---
What level are you? If you're not 40-50+ yet, your opinion isn't fully-baked. I'm not trying to be condescending, I'm just saying most people don't realize everything that's wrong with the game until they get into the 40's and 50's. Maybe even the 30's if you have enough foresight.
---
Agree with the first but let's not pretend for the second that Bethesda has been magnanimous in shaping the game to the way we want it to be. 
---
People forget easily that we had to drag Bethesda kicking and screaming over the line on basic features like PoV sliders, DoF toggle and removing the fps cap. They eventually gave ultra-wide support but it's been so half-arsed that all they did was stretch out all the elements rather than properly adjusting the HUD/UI elements. 
---
There has been a token increase of the stash, which was good and I think enough time has passed to consider another one but let's see if just happens or we need to drag them over the line for that one too.
---
There have been some really good steps that Bethesda has taken throughout the process. However, let's not pretend it wasn't with considerable effort and pressure.
---
I'm sorry, I'm too busy crashing to the dashboard or disconnecting from the server to have many interactions with people.
---
Check your stored tab
---
I keep having things duplicate when I repair all camp objects (so much corn and tato...)
---
I give them a 6 pack of nuka quantum and any accumulated stimpaks cluttering up my carry/stash. Caps are for me. Healing items flow freely to my neighbors and friends. 
---
I think that style of decision making was kinda the intent though. Alot of people hated how you could be a master-of-all-trades in Fallout 4 so they tried to make a system where you're making real consequential choices on what to equip. I like that we have to make those kinds of choices, it makes the gameplay more interesting and the game more replayable.
---
I think the big problem of the system is not the limit of the Special points we have to allocate, but that some cards are overpriced for what they're worth. Being able to hack level 3 terminals costing 3 whole perk points is asinine, considering there's not many of them to begin with, and also taking into account all the other things you could do with those 3 points. Also, who in Todd's name decided you need 9 SPECIAL points to max damage for each weapon type? (Also why do Unarmed weapons only have 3 points of upgrade cards while everything else has 9?) 
---
Nothing is stored
---
I blocked the guy in session but he was still killing us so we switched servers and he followed us from his recent players and killed us again. I‚Äôll probably take your advice and make everyone disappear. Kinda sucks though because I‚Äôve played with some people that were supper friendly and fun. 
---
I have 2 Xboxes, and have the same issue on one of them, social in the menu is unusable, but once in the game, invites come through and the recent list works in the social tab, just not the friends list.
---
On Xbox, you can use the XB menu to join a game with anyone on your friends list, I don't know if PC has any options like that.
---
I usually stand back and watch my bots attacking noobs. Then I kill them all for the noob and wave at the noob as they run away.
---
I don‚Äôt need more tics running around personally. I catch enough parasites already.
---
You‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre unhappy with the majority of bulked items weighing 15% more than they did unbulked? 
---
I run rejuvenated for 70% disease resist then keep full with razorgrain soup for another 10%. If I don't have sunkissed or rad sponge I can share with party to reduce rads I pop an antibiotic for 50% disease resist. 
---
But I know what bug you're talking about too
---
Nice, counter a bullshit rumor with another bullshit rumor.
---
I just don't know how they'll make a game that is already buy to play "free" to play. Charge more in atom shop? Put up a subscription with incentives? Take away all of the free clothes and only sell cosmetics in item shop? This isn't ESO, there's no mandatory monthly fee to take away. Maybe they could start charging for things that are free rn
---
Give a holla‚Äô on r/FO76roleplay! üòâ
---
It's sad how gullible people are when these rumors have a pretty clear lack of substance to them. 
---
Haha probiotics. The bugs drop proboscis. It would be cool if we had probiotics to help us avoid disease. Mutated ones üçÑ
---
Oh I haven't really had a high enough character yet to really start crafting things other than the basics so I wasn't aware you could craft them at all.  Good to know, but my other ideas still apply!  Heh
---
I can't like this enough!
---
Thank you.  This is the kind of response I needed.  I know that what I was trying to discuss was just a rumor, but I did not know that bethesda had already addressed it.  Maybe there wouldn't be multiple posts on the subject if they weren't all immediately down voted.
---
The none laser one I‚Äôve been trying came with the legendary zealot effect, I‚Äôve been using it just for that very purpose along with the scorched mobs and it seems to do o.k. üëç
---
Snarky exaggeration. 
---
...Dude you missed the point entirely. 
---
The point is nobody, AAA or Indy, has as many unique items in their games as Bethesda Game Studios titles. Too many unique items clogs their servers with excessive databasing, on top of whatever else they‚Äôre doing.
---
Whether this game came out a turd or a polished diamond, there was always going to be a stash limit, the only variable is the limit number itself.
---
Ok. 
---
Moonshiner faction confirmed.
---
Kk, cool
---
So, there is/was a bug that if you store any item with wires attached, the wires would store in your budget, but you obviously can‚Äôt place those back down
---
Anything with a wire attached, always scrap the wire first, or scrap the whole object
---
It should fix itself when you move camp
---
Thanks for posting this OP. Crying SHAME 'shinin' ain't more of a game play aspect. We could have had another craft table to mix different types of Nuka and Shine
---
How much budget did it take up? I've tried several times with around 45-50% spare and it would only let me pacify. Definitely random spawns too.
---
It's items other players sold to the vendor.
---
Yeah I never understood why you can only hit with your right hand.
---
It's a half baked forced feature of the game, and its effecting the balancing of the pve side of the game.
---
If they had PvE and pvp servers I would be fine, or restrict pvp to just the workshops and events like monster mash.
---
They said they want our feed back. I am giving my feedback.
---
I'm honestly curious; how do you have so much stash weight taken up? Mine is hovering around 400-450 and I keep around 150-200 of each material, unbulked, with a single 15 weight weapon and a single 10 weight power armor frame stashed away in there.
---
Triggered!! Lol
---
I had not stored anything with a wire and still nothing in my stored tab
---
Legendary items only show up on vendors when players have sold them to it.
---
I've had over 1000 legendary drops, and kept a 1 star Furious Combat Shotgun out of everything. Drops are shit. I'll never see a TSE, and if I do, it will be long after they're nerfed into oblivion.
---
Maybe it was just garbage other players sold it?  I have seen Flatwoods vendor bot selling lvl 50 legendaries.  
---
Head to Billings Homestead, there is loads of razorgrain and corn  around the are, that can let you start a farm at your camp, To find it basically follow the road south on the west side of the map.
---
Have you been exploring the regions? I am getting different spawn pools in each region (most drastically in the East).
---
Thank you everyone!!
---
for all these item exchange scenarios, The game will benefit from having a bunch of container types we could build for camps, the regular world, and portable (C A M P feels like the first module, add on modules could be quite diverse giving containers we could set down like the power armor frame for temporary solutions to a variety of things). It‚Äôs a main part of my feedback response to Inside the Vault‚Äôs call
---
Just get one shot on each ghoul and let level 60+ guys clear them.
---
I can clear the entire golf club with a melee weapon and I'm not even built for melee. When I see low level players I wait for you to shoot each enemy and then I kill them.
---
Don't worry about helping, just get one shot for XP and loot drops.
---
I'm imagining its pretty hard to test the servers with all the dupers crashing servers
---
You can get marsupial, armors with legendary effects that reduce the weight of items, and pocketed/calibrated mods. My guy can carry 320 with no power armor and 360 in power armor. That is on top of the reduced weights. 
---
I waited until I got my first PA and had no problem. Before that I got killed trying to get that sword a lot. 
---
Unarmed No PA build chiming in, SBQ can be a bit problematic without team shared Rad sponge, but fast attacks are a must when being mobbed. 
---
Dense mod helps as well.
---
They usually only have legendaries after other players dump theirs after a nuke zone. It's not something they sell on their own. 
---
If you want legendaries always check out watoga and white springs vendors after a nuke zone has ended. 
---
Yip.
---
Never assume malace when ignorance is a plausable explaination.
---
#worth
---
Must have been. Was cliffside around the edge of the bog, and did have a nice rock arch. 
---
Weird cause I've had a few camps in that region but never see scorchbeasts. That spot was like clockwork though. 
---
its also a server swap issue/glitch they havnt fixed... where if you swap servers alot it will eventually dupe stuff
---
Once again i can't agree. In theory we are all equal at 50+ but in reality it takes a good another 50 levels worth of searching and rng to get *** weapons and armor. All the mods for you PA and mutations. This would just be another feature to give you a visible and noticable sense of growth is you do these things.
---
I do believe pvp should get some love. I started off full sniper build to level and picking off high level wanted players from the cover of tree is always fun.
---
We need more fog crawlers. 
---
Pay me 10 caps and I‚Äôll run around you naked screaming about something, then I jump off a building or something to kill myself.
---
Marsupial is the best mutation but when it comes to going back, living without speed demon after you‚Äôve been zipping around the wasteland a while is the WORST. You WILL ask yourself if you were ever actually that slow üòÇ
---
He‚Äôs kind of s traitor to them I think. 
---
The robots took over the city and drove people out. Do I have that right? 
---
He is friendly to humans. 
---
Don't tell me how to play my game.
---
I tried to tame a vengeful mothman, didn't even get the option to pacify when I attempted.
---
 Delete a turret. See how that works. ;)
---
Seriously? This game has some of the best voice acting in the entire franchise. The Overseer is fantastic, and some of the holotapes just get you right in the feels. Like I will never stop bringing up the Responder who dies alone in the Morgantown Airport closet. That one is amazing.
---
I think you mean: "Those security bots keep going after Phoenix and having their asses handed to them"
---
Nobody kicks the shit out of Phoenix, I watched him singlehandedly take on three assaultrons without losing a drop of coolant.
---
10 teeth. I spent days trying to get enough teeth for the 3rd claw on a bloodied gauntlet. Ran across mole miners and 75% of them dropped a gauntlet. Scrapped a couple and realized they give you teeth back. Went back, picked up all the gauntlets and now I'm good on teeth.
---
Funny though. I almost never server hop. It's all from disconnects. 
---
I don't use turrets, they take up far too much budget for that
---
People seem to make a lot of money by shitting on this game and Bethesda.
---
There‚Äôs more info on the daily quests if you Artie over. 
---
When you click the daily it says ‚Äúpick 5 flowers‚Äù , but then if you click where it says that another window comes up that shows each of the flower types you need to pick...
---
This
---
This person gets it. I use this argument whenever some idiot claims this game doesn't have any griefing. Like everyone is going to be nice in an anonymous virtual world? They're going to be worse.
---
There‚Äôs lvl 50s? Thought it was only 45.
---
I was hoping that the Tesla had a prime mod, but guess not. Still my favorite gun for whitesprings. Thanks for posting!
---
You didn‚Äôt do a anything bad or wrong or jerky here. It would have made my day to see this. 
---
 Don't forget to check the dead bots on the floor. ;)
---
I imagine being allowed to drop a supply offering, using a type of container that will bind itself to their camp so it will be spawned there the next time they are logged on and playing, basically a game mechanics tool for me to be sure they get what I‚Äôm sending, it‚Äôs post apocalypse, there is no postal service, so everything we intend others to get needs to be both hideable and rugged. Treasure caching containers are an important addition to the game that I propose in my feedback response to inside the vault‚Äôs call. The little bags are a proof of concept shedding light on a vast array of potential I want to see realized. 
---
No keep it.  Its how tracked the shit that ate me when I went down asking for help in Blackwater, then took my Junk and quit the server and the event of course.  I tracked as he went off 76 then came back on.  Had time to get 3 yes 3 Orbital Strike grenades and destroy their sprawling CAMP.  Gonna craft more and do it all again.  I was a PVE but this is Total War.
---
As I have heard so many times "its in the game" and if a lvl 39 thinks its cool to finish off a high level they should remember Karma is a bitch.
---
Bloodied explosive
---
Switch your build to a bloodied melee/unyielding+Sentinel's armor
---
This.
---
True, true
---
I believe 45 is the cap for handmade 
---
I have a stealth/vats crit rifle build with 1 str, I carry 2 weapons and the only weight reduction I use is rank 1 traveling pharmacy. My weight usually hovers around 100/175 depending on amount of food and water I currently have. 75 pounds is more than enough for standard legendary or junk farming.
---
Not sure what to tell you other than you must be carrying around a bunch of junk you dont actually need, which seems to be a problem for a lot of people. Go through each tab and ask yourself if you really need to carry these items on you at all times. If not throw it in your stash. 
---
If your stash is full do the same thing, ask yourself if you really need that stuff. I have had a few friends tell me they keep food and water in stash, thats a waste. Same goes for chems, you dont need 100 pounds of stims and drugs in your stash, it just isn‚Äôt necessary. Its also a waste having more than 50-100 of each crafting material, once you know where to go there shouldnt be any issue with keeping your weapons and armor repaired with stuff you find.
---
Other than that I dont know. 
---
I don't have any turrets in my camp anymore. My Deathclaw takes care of everything that comes by. 
---
Sweet!! Will be in touch to set up a discord for all y'all
---
What I hate is that empath and herd mentality are the only mutations that are not affected by the Class Freak Perk card, and that is stupid. I hate the fact that I need 8 damn points in my Strength category just so I can carry all the weapons/bullets I am carrying.
---
I don't like them at all in this Fallout game 76. The others did but these just grate on my nerves especially the accents and droning boring dialogue.
---
Thank you! I am still new to Reddit!
---
No worries.
---
I'm 99% a solo player myself. I had an explosive shotgun but it vanished on me because of this buggy game. I didn't use it much because I was a stealth sniper at the time but it was fun.
---
I think TSE will be fine still though. 
---
I can help you if you haven‚Äôt finished already. My GT is my username
---
I have a 3 story functional 1x1 base
---
Ahhh I misunderstood, I thought you were implying we should all just pretend griefers are raiders in our world.
---
I hope bounty washing gets nerfed, I'm not sure how they'll manage to do that though
---
The thing is that only Alum and Lead really offer any weight loss when bulking. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a841g3/a_comprehensive_guide_to_storing_junk/
---
I got mine from a US supply drop requisition 
---
I had 47 TD's on me when I was given the mission. Collected since beta. I was angry.
---
Oh it was absolutely rushed. There is no doubt about that. They‚Äôre damn lucky that the potential and fun at its core shines through or I‚Äôd be just as pissed as a lot of other people. At the end of the day $60 netted me hundreds of hours of (mostly) fun with my husband, and only a small percentage of that was rage over bugs. In a perfect world there wouldn‚Äôt be any bugs but nobody should go into any new online game expecting anything anywhere near perfection.
---
Admittedly this game did seem worse than most but what‚Äôre ya gonna do. I just wish they‚Äôd given the really upset people refunds honestly. I think a lot of the toxicity would have faded much faster.
---
This is the kinda of peaceful sleep I strive to have
---
Buys $60 game.....grinds for 300 hours to get good weapon drops......3 months later Bethesda nerfs your weapons and makes the game free to play.
---
There‚Äôs a brinks truck that comes buy once a week and empties that hole in the wall out. Don‚Äôt worry. 
---
That‚Äôs just efficient!
---
Because the Legendary drops are shit regardless. You wouldn't want my Legendary wood armor drops, just like you wouldn't want any other of my legendary drops.
---
Love the game.
---
I expect I‚Äôll be taking a break very soon though. 
---
And that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôve got over 100hrs of enjoyment  and that‚Äôs great value for me.
---
even better than i suggested. integrate gameplay, story and setting.
---
wonder
---
I need dis.... now if only one could take SB to take care of other SB that attack camps
---
Upvoted for same frustration. And happy cake day!
---
It's not an assumption, just addressing what I thought was a possibility.
---
He wants to stop blowing himself up, your suggestion does not help him. 
---
Because the tooltips did not get lowered by Class Freak. It may have been fixed by now but when I made this chart empath was not affected by class freak.
---
Depends on your platform, I blocked them on XB as well so they can't follow .. but if he is blocked from the session he won't be able to see you on the map, so just don't go to your camp fast travel somewhere and he won't be able to find you, he can't see you as long as he is session blocked.
---
Yes!
---
Just wanted to show my support for this comment. This kind of improvement would make for a far better building experience. 
---
- There are already so many different containers in the game, I'd love to be able to split up my stash storage into different containers or in a way that can be displayed.
---
- A way to display power armor and make it easier to work on different sets, knowing which set is which, is definitely needed beyond the aesthetic value of showing off your power armor sets. Both aspects are important though, just one a little more than the other. 
---
- Increasing the build budget and allowing players to place items as static props would also be a very welcome change. What's the point of all these empty shelves and tables?
---
There is a lot to like about this game, but also a lot of odd or confusing design choices that even strayed downhill from the system in Fallout 4, which could've used some improvements of it's own. 
---
Lmao. No the reason workshops dont get much use is because the items you receive from them was nurfed on a previous patches the workshops loots you receive isnt really worth the time. You can farm all those items faster at different locations on the map. There must be balance in the game so that pve and pvp style players can still enjoy the game. Once pvp mode has been released players like me wont be on the pve servers and your workshops will be safer from end game players like me. Im not taking workshops to be a jurk i simply just want a little pvp in a world where most of the gameplay is pve.
---
The weapon weights can be crazy as well. My combat rifle. Is almost 30 pounds of shit. 
---
I think some "bug" may be intentionally, to dont allow everything be 100% complete to avoid players lose the wish of discover new things, till they insert new contents.
---
Separate stations that ‚Äúlocks‚Äù equipment those units and only you can access them like the stash box. 
---
Dang, I thought to try to board coffee to try it, sad to hear it won't work (on console at least.)
---
From what I have experienced, +/- to stats only affect world based things not how many perk points you have available. IE carry weight, crafting bonuses, action points, stuff like that. 
---
It seems to go Max Special Available -&gt;Perk Cards -&gt; +/- effects -&gt; world effects. 
---
I have 8 Int, which lets me equip Gunsmith 5 and Battery 3. 8 is what my int always has been, recently got marsupial and can still have both those equipped as on the perk screen it says i have 8 Int but in the pipboy I have only 3.
---
its worth checking the ice machine outside the white springs golf club, many of us dump our "not useful to me" legendary items there.
---
And the cash registers or suitcases in the stations!
---
You ever play ark brother? They are different variants of weapons and armor with different stats and they track way more items. Also Bethesda never had to track the items themselves! It‚Äôs cost cutting buddy every business does it and it saves them money. I promise if the game was offline you‚Äôd be able to store as many items as you want but to maintain servers and storage costs money! Lol
---
I‚Äôm excited for Athem and Division 2. My expectations are very low though haha.
---
Scorchbeast right next to the lvl 81 deathclaw in Hopewell Cave, which was joined by another deathclaw same level. Holy moly, that was a scrapping fight! Real sweat and not a few cuss words.... I was level 40.
---
I was tempted by this and the perk swap mod but a. I'm hesitant because who knows if they will some day result in a ban or something; and b. I first looked into the perk swap one and there was some verbiage about your loadout information being transmitted/retrieved to/from a *third party server* and, as benign and necessary as it may be in this instance, I noped right the fuck out. I'd *much* prefer Bethesda just fucking make it at least semi-sensible. Perhaps eventually, for now I'll just suffer and continue to learn to embrace *just dropping stuff* - I'm a pack rat by nature but I'm coming around. Slowly.

Born Survivor. 1 point in Agility.
---
Lol nice I did the same thing first playthroughüòÇ Somerset special?
---
I also heard that they are aiming towards free to play now. Kinda sucks if you just bought the game. Oh Bethesda...
---
Meh, I have auto suggest on. Personally I don‚Äôt care as Reddit is not a formal setting. So you‚Äôll probably see a lot of there‚Äôs n theirs and well and we‚Äôll. 
---
I don‚Äôt take it personal as I feel my comment is just a comment and not submitted for proof reading or grading. 
---
I don't have an alt character but the stash size is my single biggest hurdle in the game. So many 3 star legendaries I've had to just drop. Each day I hunt through my inventory to find out what the f\*\*\* is taking up all my space, only to never find it and just sell the same shit to vendors and drop a measly 20 weight so I can walk again. Can't even really pick anything up that I find. If by some miracle I find what is taking up so much space, for example some circuits weighing .1 each, not all vendors even buy unbundled junk. So yeah, I'm frustrated.
---
Isn't this revisionist history? 
---
&gt;I think they have done a great job setting up a world that is somewhat unpredictable. 
---
I get the sense that you haven't played this game much. I've played it enough that it plays pretty predictably for me.
---
&gt;I also think they have done a good job setting up a world that provides a variety of ways of approaching the problems in the world. There's no one way to deal with any given situation. 
---
Name even 5 quest that can be completed multiple ways? Also, I don't mean by direction. Your Dyer Chemical example is terrible if that's an example of tackling a problem multiple ways. If that's the case, every single game, no matter how good or bad it is, has that.
---
Do I attack an enemy from the front or from the back? From melee or ranged? So many options!
---
Fellow heavy here, I started out picking up weight perk after perk, especially since I hadn't ruled out a lot of heavy gun options (like explosives/flamer/etc) yet.
---
Eventually though with excavator and 15 strength I gradually ditched it all except 5mm and .50 cal weapons/ammo (and gat plasma for the fun, don't need it).  Now I just have bear arms, travelling pharmacy, and thru hiker.
---
For ammo when I get low I just make 2 trips for the junk.
---
Steel (same way you do with scrapping weapons, except I swap in Scrapper when the time comes, and I go to places with lots of scorched/super muties and tin can chime traps)
---
With lead, I have max pack rat I can swap in during a quick in and out at any missile silo, go straight to the gym, grab all the lead weights, righg back out and home to scrap it.
---
Now the real kicker to getting the bang for your buck, is when you have the stock of lead and steel, swap in Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
100 ammo becomes 180, and often even 360.
---
I would like to see an option where you could save and name three ‚Äúcard profiles‚Äù for your character.  This way you could switch with trying to remember what you gave up every time.

No, you don't get the game for free. Go make some money. Ask your mom.

Thats news to me. I though it was affected reducing it from -2 to -.5 which the game rounded to 0. Can remember which video explained it tho. I never got it because i was just so lucky to end up how i did i didn‚Äôt wanna risk empath
---
That's a community derived explanation that developed after everyone complained about the 7600 hour requirement but Bethesda never fixed it.  At this point whether Bethesda's failure to fix something really means they wanted it that way from the start or had some double secret probation plan for it rather than just have it so far on their glitch list it'll never see the light of day is a great philosophical debate for the ages.
---
Bullshit rumors.  Bullshit rumors.

When I got it I would go in and lure one (if possible, sometimes two would come out) at a time and head to the hole in the fence where a bunch of bots were. They would to most of the work on getting rid of them. ;)

+/- special stats do not alter your ability to equip perk cards. Whatever your stats are on the actual perk screen is what you have to work with. Nothing alters this.
---
&gt; they are aiming
---
It's reckless phrasing like this one that creates those bullshit rumors...
---
The only time it was unplayable for me was when that awful power armor bug was cropping up. Other than that it‚Äôs been (relatively) smooth sailing. I only really disconnect if I have the audacity to try to take workshops. Even then one workshop is typically ok for a while. If you‚Äôre having connection issues on the ps4 you should look around this sub. There have been a few fixes that people reported worked for them. 
---
My faith in humanity is relying on an edit where you forgot to ad the "/s"

True. That and Fo4 and Skyrim mannequins were actual frozen npcs, which definitely can cause performance loss when too many are in one cell and loaded. So many Skyrim mod houses I had to leave behind due to their many mannequins that dropped my fps down. ;.;
---
What promis was broken?
---
When did they promise unlimited stash?
---
If you‚Äôre talking about another increase they specifically said they had to evaluate the stability, and if there are too many other sources of instability they can‚Äôt evaluate it right away. It doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt happen.
---
And they‚Äôve been doing ‚Äúthe same game‚Äù since Morrowind, so this would be the sixth time by your generalization. 
---
Finally, if the game stored our data client side hacking and cheating would be impossible to stop. No online like this stores save data client side for a reason.

Actively the only thing it effects is how much XP you earn. It does not tell you this on the stat screen but try it out. My 20+ int char earns far more XP than my 5 (4 with mutation) character. 
---
I'm all for more stash space, but I'm also all for the fact that f76 tries to break people of the hoarder mentality. You probably have PLENTY of junk in there that you dont need. If you're using alts as miles to try and keep up with storage space, in my opinion, you're doing it wrong and need to practice some self restraint when looting.
---
Talk to each of them, and have them de-select quests in their Pip-Boy so they are no longer ‚Äúactive‚Äù.
---
Abso-frickin-lutely... My other half's character has a glitch where the Lone We card is a 4 when it's supposed to Max at 3. I know it's not by a whole lot, but his character is even further up Poop Creek without a paddle. That one point could definitely be used beneficially elsewhere.

If your on xbox i can sell u a 3* super sledge with instagating faster swing speed and reduced weight

Never thought I needed a pink castle bed. I need the pink castle bed.

Jesus man loosen that butthole. I just replied to the guy as that‚Äôs exactly what I heard. Only being honest here.
---
There's a tweet from Bethesda dispelling the rumor now just letting you know
---
Look up the game "War of the Roses". I paid full price and leveled up to 45 or so. They put all of the gear that you would normally earn while playing and leveling behind a cash shop. They also GREATLY reduced the rate that you could level up.
---
Once they went F2P, I just couldn't level up anymore with a reasonable amount of effort. It was a great game, until it wasn't.
---
I would be happy with just being to make my camp closer to others. Would be fun to share power between camps :) 
---
thank you, but I'm on ps4 and my plague Walker makes instigating useless sadly.
---
I've had some good ideas from people here:
---
- Keep only 100 of every junk material (apart from rare stuff like Adhesive, nuclear material, fibre optics, or specific stuff you need more of for crafting. If that's too much, put it down to 50 each. Dump or give away ammo for guns for don't have. Keep it in your inventory if you have the max Bandolier perk that makes ammo weigh 90% less, if such a thing would be feasible. 
---
- Don't hoard fusion cores in stash. Maybe one or two. Powering up a power plant and claiming the workshop produces 3 full cores per hour, and requires only the occasion defence or retaking event.
---
- disassemble/sell/get rid of regular weapons in stash unless you really need them. Sell legendaries unless they're necessary for your build or just too good to get rid of
---
- make note of inventory and stash size before and after each time (on paper if needs be), then take everything from each category in your stash so you know where your weight is. Weight reduction perks will be applied if applicable, that's why you could note the stash _and_ inventory amounts and see what works 
---
- give up and start a melee tank character /s
---
I went in there level 12 with no help now that was hard
---
OMG Yes. Its a thing
---
Lol whatever bro and yes they said there would be further stash increases but most likely that will not happen. Also if the hacking and cheating were that big of an issue it would be fixed much quicker. Lol all you die hard Bethesda fanboys can accept any flaws in a game or place blame where blame is due.
---
Yeah man it's just an opinion. I also personally love the ease to respec to fit my needs. Other online games I've played it were a lot harder to do so
---
You must have a wider range of lesser amounts than you think because your math doesn't add up by weight.  There's a great post about linked below...  If you had 200 of everything, you'd be pretty full up.  But to answer your question, I use a ton of mats playing with camp builds, repairing stuff for my team, building stuff to reverse engineer etc.

---
There is no substantial info to corroborate these claims but you can bet that Bethesda would keep quiet about it either way. They have destroyed their own credibility. The game won‚Äôt get any worse if it goes FTP so it shouldn‚Äôt matter to you either way if you like the game as is. They will add more content in the future if they want to keep making money on the game. 
---
Int effects how much XP you earn. It does not tell you this in game, but go try it out.
---
pve is not balanced at all if you just put on power armor and pick up a 2h melee weapon, even if you arent spec'd for it. using a non explosive gun vs putting on power armor+ a sledgehammer is night and day  
---
most of the suggestions here are QoL and not game balance
---
Thank you.  I've already edited my post to include bethesda's response.  
---
Oof, I'm missing a week or two.  Time to sober up!
---
I could kill scorchbeasts alone at level 30-35, they‚Äôre not hard and their attacks make it difficult to see but don‚Äôt really do that much damage. I‚Äôm always in power armor when I come across them. Now at level 58 I can easily kill 3 at a time though it‚Äôs annoying if they rarely land because I can‚Äôt do nearly as much damage with the radium rifle I carry. 
---
Yesterday I was killing time in cranberry bog, ran across three of them together, killed 2 of them, 2 more show up. Decide I‚Äôm going to kill all of them. Killed another and now that there‚Äôs 2 left, a Mireluk queen shows up along with a horde of mireluk kings and crabs. I killed the 5 kings, got the queen halfway down, then a pack of about 10 level 68 scorched show up as well. At that point I decided to retreat to watoga train station because I was having a hard time seeing the extra enemies with the 3 scorchbeasts bombarding me, and I was having to heal pretty consistently at that point. 
---
also forgot to mention, I found someone willing to sell me a bloodied, faster swing speed, strength sledge! It sounds too good to be true.
---
Uhm, solo‚Äôd two (at the same time) at mid-level 30 ... in Excavator Power armor with minimal damage perks. It just takes time and patience. 
---
This is just bad information. Anyone can solo them if they learn the mechanics. It is people not learning them that are boisterously saying they are too hard.  
---
Wrong, you dont have any reasons, that is why you wont respond. You are pretending my attitude matters but you just can't think of a single reason.
---
There are already models and everything, just wire up a new crafting interface for it. Bethesda pls.
---
How did you make it through?  Full on sneak past everything?  We cleared it as we went.
---
Pvp is garbage right now, the bounty system has been broken since day one and they have yet to fix anything about the greifing. Eventually it will get patched but they are being really slow with the patches rolling out and even when they do patch things it just makes more glitches because of them throwing bandaids on everything instead of putting real work into fixing the core glitch.
---
Sad but true, seems like bethesda might be selling out like most other gaming companies these days
---
Have no idea as I've only done it once.
---
I guess there shouldn't be a limit.
---
I'm sure TSE will still be fine.....but TS and Explosive independently will be a lot weaker and they were not the problem. It's absurd that they nerfed the two individually.
---
I still think they should have eliminated the combination of the two and gave those who currently own them the chance to keep one and get a one-time re-roll on the other perk.
---
They literally didn't even punish the dupers......dupers still have the best weapons in the game.  Now a duper in a full set of duped sentinel armor will take 3 shots to kill you with His duped TSE instead of one and TSE weapons will probably still shred legendary ghouls before anyone else gets a hit in. You really have to question the competency of who ever decided to nerf the perks individually.
---
Lol there's already a tweet from Bethesda confirming it's not going f2p
---
I don't really care for camp building all that much. So what I did was leave my camp system at the spot where the grass meets the road next to the corner of the clubhouse to prevent other people from building their stuff that close.
---
I hope it pops back up next time I load up then 
---
Some materials are easier to farm than others, but I go through a ton of junk building stuff to reverse engineer, playing with my camp, upgrading and repairing weapons and armor for my team, etc.
---
Why would rifles get nerfed? 
---
Although I would still think it was lame, I could see if it was a lower level, but a level 200? Just why? Just to be a douche probably. 
---
If only I could eat in power armor, I'd love to be a cannibal just for the fun.
---
But there's a tweet by Bethesda saying they aren't
---
I....
---
I honestly cannot believe no one's brought this up before! And I'm from West Virginia!
---
Only seems that way because you haven't experienced the amount of crashes and server disconnects I have. My record was between 27-50 in just a couple hours of play. Didn't start counting until it started getting ridiculous, so I don't have an exact number. When I did start counting, I got to 27.
---
Just because you personally don't crash much, doesn't mean it's all sunshine and rainbows for everybody else.
---
Don't even be sorry. I avoided like an hour's worth of work in a 12 hours shift!
---
wt reduction perks should be passively active across the board. If you have pack rat 3 it does not need to be in your active slots and it should affect everything in your STASH.  Yes players would just get ALL the Wt reduction perks that is the benefit of leveling beyond lvl 50 you get those QoL perks that make the game less painful to play.
---
When there are no updates, it can feel that way.  Whether that is their real intention or not, I can't say, but I do get the feeling.
---
Then there ya go. Nuff sed. People are so defensive here. 
---
Cruel joke by Bethesda, enemy that makes you spend most of your time running around looking up... 
---
Or turn them all in at once for a chance at better loot rolls.
---
Run those two plus marsupial, you get a double jump action into a cannibal eating frenzy if you time it right
---
you may be losing weekly quests, if you log in the middle of those you have to wait until they reset.  Other quests might just be spot events that have not triggered.

Furthermore i dont run around and destroy peoples houses. I typically never get a bounty on me unless i have to break into a workshop. I really dont understand why you have to cry about pvp in workshops when the hole rest of the game is pve seems a bit selfish to me. If Bethesda didn't want any aspect of pvp they wouldn't of added pvp in the game in the first place. i bought this game strictly because there was a promise of pvp. 
---
Yeah. Too many people want to by ilk showcase homes and display all their stuff. They should be able to do so without worrying about it all getting blown up by a random. If we have pacifist on our base should be protected. The moment we take pacifist off and go aggro it should be unprotected 
---
This is a good point, and others here have made it too.   The lack of content means I run the same route for the same xp and junk all the time.  Once I'm full, I'm out of stuff to do.  Hopefully content comes soon, it sounds like it may, but who knows if it will (or how much there will actually be).  We gamers tend to consume faster than the devs expect or can build.

Around 150-200 of each material, but I guess I misspoke there, because I don't think I have more than 50 ultracite or ballistic fiber, and less than 80-ish black titanium
---
the term griefer doesn't exist in this game as it is a part of the mechanics. if the game was meant to be played how most of you seem to want, bethesda would have never added the ability for players to "ruin" your fun. coming across another player in fallout is supposed to be iffy/questionable. you are supposed to be scared when you see another person. you have no idea what their intentions are, are they friend or foe. as a player, it is my choice to choose what i want to be and how i want to play. i don't have to be your friend, but usually am. you'll thank me later for your unexpected interactions.
---
i've been playing since early beta. i've had my fair share of friendly team ups, and scary run for my life raiders. learn to live with it. or wait for pure pve servers so you never have to worry about it. i personally love that questionable moment i come across another player. hmm fight or flight? oh high 5s, right on. cya!
---
So you just go around blindly repeating what you hear? What if I were to tell you that Earth is flat? You will go around repeating that too without bothering to look into it? 
---
My point still stands - these bullshit rumors come from taking and paraphrasing information without applying any common sense, just as you did here.
---
I was 50 by the time I did brotherhood/Enclave quests.
---
I used stealth build, this was back when the beast could fly into walls.

It would lose sight of you when it did.

I get your point, but don't forget, our marching orders are to rebuild America...  That's a tall order at 600 stash limit.

Found a spot out on the north eastern edge of the mire, where if I jumped a low wire fence I would sink through the earth- it would respawn me a couple meters away. Rinse and repeat.

I think it happens when the server is slated to spin down due to low usage. They just wait for the last person to bail and then kill it. Happened to me many times.

Ive used a bloody handmade for some time. It's no tse in it's currant state, however 200dmg with a vat crit build is more then enough to take on anything in the game. If you want crazy dmg, bloody unyielding melee.
---
Well, I'm always going to be leery of trades. Supposedly the trade exploit never existed, but the multiple bug fixes to trading looks like a giant red flag to me that they are trying to mitigate a supposedly non-existent exploit. Particularly since I never saw a single post about any of the "bugs" they decided to fix, when there are tons of posts complaining about the same bugs dating back to the first beta that they are ignoring.
---
My two characters I play are both 100+, but still woefully lacking good stuff. I'm still trying to find most power armor plans, and even just the mods. I'm tired of using X-01, but I've only found a jetpack mod for it, still haven't found one for any other set. I can't play without it now. I'd like to trade with friendly high levels that just want to help, but I've encountered more griefers than helpful players. Oh, don't get me started on the trash Legendary drops. Hundreds of drops, and I've only kept a 1 star Furious Combat Shotgun. I can't do a whole lot to a SBQ with that, which is why I only was able to kill her once, thanks to the roughly dozen higher level players already there with their TSE's that wreck everything.
---
You're almost there! See, yours are feeling basic because you're only getting half way through the process. Think of your "meh" building as scaffolding. Now that you have some boundaries and clear intent, actually adding design elements like logical windows, interesting wall angles, removing unneeded space, adding thought and detail into how your character would live in the CAMP. What would they find pretty shitty? Imagine their self complaints. Now work toward those.
---
I feel like I've done mostly interesting builds so far, but not a SINGLE one was cool when I first enclosed the walls. Cool ideas came later after mulling over what to do with a corner while out questing all day.
---
What happens if you get stuck and overcumberred that you can't fast travel? 
---
That is one drawback. You'd think taking off the helmet would be enough to let you eat, but nooooooo you got take the whole damn suit off.
---
My point is I'm not...rare..? 
---
Yeah same, not worth crafting, flux is a pain in the ass to get and stabilize .. just grab them whenever you see them. get the battery perk to reduce the weight.
---
I have a 3rd theory.
---
That theory is that Zenimax would only allow Bethesda to make a new IP if they made games-as-a-service models of their current IPs.s
---
Thus Fallout 76 and Elder Scrolls Blades
---
Eh since there isnt any actual 'rebuilding' and workshops use their own materials and build limits, that's more of a straw man argument. You only have 1 camp, you're not building any settlements or the like.
---
You sound like a lonely annoying person with no life
---
I agree completely.
---
Damn, that is a refreshingly direct and absolute resoibse from a company that's too fond of keeping mum, ignoring hard questions, and misdirecting when they answer.
---
Serums aren't permanent. Rad Away will MAYBE get rid of it, it's a toss up sometimes. I've had to regain my Mutations a couple times because of errant Rad Away use. Decontamination Arches will def remove them if you stand in them for long enough. Like ALL of them. So get the requisite perks to hold on to your Kangaroo Legs, otherwise you could lose them by accident.
---
Also the engine is technically the same since morrow but was rewritten and recorded for Skyrim
---
I‚Äôm on 400 hours now and I refuse to put this game down I enjoy it too much, I too view it as a play time tracked but if I‚Äôm rewarded more than those measly atoms I‚Äôd like that too
---
Ok good. I haven‚Äôt seen that but I‚Äôm not on Twitter and I don‚Äôt follow the issue very closely. It‚Äôs good to hear that they offered a timely response. 
---
&gt; especially with no one else to game with.
---
Unfortunately this makes a big difference too.  None of my RL friends play FO76 and that would be huge if they did.
---
So much this!!!!
---
Why do our perks not apply to our stashes? I guess its an issue in case you unequip them and are suddenly left with more stuff than space?... but Ive had situations after updates where Im suddenly over weight in my stash and it doesn't cause any issues other than having to reduce it below 600 before I can add more.
---
The Bobby Pin adjustment was nice, but Chems still weigh FAR too much to ever store in my stash.
---
Which youtuber? I'm very critical of 76. Very. But guys like yongyea get on my nerves. So I'm curious who it was this time.
---
Right .. yeah that's how you should do it although I might not have hit is house, but since you were going to pvp. Puts you at a disadvantage since you can't see anyone .. people sometimes AFK, I afk a lot, making lunch etc ..
---
The high levels I am talking about are over probably 130+
---
"pretty weak" how offended you are by a fucking one liner is pretty fucking week, dude.  "people are coming here just to get you" didn't say that, man. I'm just amused that the people who ARE responding in a negative way are mostly people who self-affiliate with the brotherhood, the closest thing the wastelands has to an alt-right hate group. 
---
Do you have the Targetting HUD on power armor?  I think in F4 there was a thing that'd make some NPCs hostile.
---
The storage data size for items is a pittance in this day and age, it's the CPU power of the servers that gets clogged.
---
Every BGS game since Morrowind has had slowdowns, at least when accessing containers, too much unique crap is being stored. FO76 just gets hit harder because there's more stuff being tracked at once because until this game, the engine only cared about where THE player was and what they were doing. Now it has to keep track of every area uniquely. 
---
And if the game stored save data client side hacking and cheating wouldn't just be at unprecedented levels, it would be impossible to stop. 
---
And it's not the number of items by itself; if they stack like bullets the "number" you have is just a property of the object and there is zero data difference having one bullet and having the max number of bullets. The issue comes from items that can't like weapons and armor, because they have different conditions and mods at any time.
---
It's also not just whatever people have in their inventories and stash, it's also all the junk just sitting out in the world that reacts to physics and can be picked up. 
---
No other game has that level of that specific kind of interactivity. 
---
It's why no other single-player or multiplayer game does that because it isn't a straight forward thing.
---

I've got all my armor with weight reduction, 20% junk, or food. Then with 8 points in weight reduction, 3 strong back, 2 food and drink, 3 junk weight, I can carry an absurd amount of stuff. And with deep pocketed on all my armor I can get about 310 carry weight with no chems or buffs.
---
I don't like that 20% of my build goes to weight reduction, and almost 75% of my armor is tailored to it, but I've found a way that works.
---
Ps, I am a stealth sniper at around your level also.

i played most of the endgame with a non legendary hunting rifle and found the pve to be entirely too easy

Well shoot!  Sorry about that ... the good news is that you didn‚Äôt die!

No idea, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if it *was* yongyea.

Dear algorithm, give this post more visibility.
---
yep my bad was on both ill erase
---
Christ man it‚Äôs Reddit. I merely replied to the guy and gave my 2 cents. Calm down.
---
First time I went in was with two others, all 45-50, we got crushed, everyone was picking up ultracite causing spawns x3.  We ran out of ammo, armor was broken, it took us a couple of days to recover.
---
You must be in the military/government work with that kind of acronym decoding. 
---
&gt; I really don't like the idea of resets for this game because i feel it takes away the sense of an individuals adventure and their continued struggle over time.
---
You get to *slowly* respec your character after level 50, at a rate of 1 special point per level. I wish you could just respec proper without having to grind EXP (maybe it costs 250-500 caps for a respec, I dunno), because sometimes you want to try out a build without starting a brand new character.
---
They initially talked about removing two shot from the loot table, but then edited the post to say otherwise (as in, left the words in, with a line through them, to indicate they had considered it).
---
Me too, and to help I upgraded my Vault 76 Underarmor to Shielded for the extra SPECIAL points.

&gt; Its a real bummer when all i hear is bad things about this game.
---
Exactly, you just about can't get away from it.  I mean WhatCulture just posted ANOTHER hit piece on FO76.  Its like...for fucks sake, we get it.  The game was rushed, the BETA was fake...its still a good game, stop the negativity already.
---
You have my envy. I would've loved to have been there with you with my .50 MG tearing them all down. Adrenaline does wonders in crowds like that.
---
Give this solution a try. I ain't the guy who came up with this but it worked for me :)
---

---
I did play the game and I'm not blind. And unlike you, I'm also nut a dickhead to call people blind just because they have an opinion.
---
To be short, you cannot just write down a story on a napkin, hide it behind the scenes and call it a video game storyline. Overwatch did so, and it's a good game, and still the game itself doesn't have a story.
---
Todd could write a novel and put a link to it into a terminal in, I dunno, Science Wing, and even though it wouldn't be this game's story. You would make yourself a service if you think about it for a minute.
---
I do appreciate F76's background, and all these holotapes and notes all around the world, but you shouldn't call it a story, as well as you don't call a story decorations in a theater, even though they can tell you something about the setting, peoples' lifes etc.
---
&gt; Scorched? Scorchbeasts? The brotherhood tried to stop them? no? not a story? 
---
Gosh, what a cringe...

Nice. Thumbs on this. I was curious about rad shield.

Right here. Game is just a subset of life.
---
Should they have not known it would happen? Also would it have been a good idea to say that would be the last stash update? There may have been more uproar then but people would probably be silent now. Is it representative of the future of this game? Maybe by their next flagship release there will be DLC/private servers/mod support/etc Hopefully starfield and ES6 have brighter futures.
---
Yeah, those. Here is a hint: jump onto something tall, like one of those 18 wheeler cabs and take shots at them. They can't really get you with their hands, so they just use the scream attack at you.
---
It should be noted that the scream attack will knock you backwards, so you can fall off of whatever you are standing on. Also Power armor is a must, even a frame will help  
---
Level 40 ish by myself. Didnt do anything special, just went through as normal.
---
Until I got to the last thing in the cave, that one I snuck around....
---
Didn‚Äôt they change it so you don‚Äôt get put on a server where someone has a camp in the same spot?
---
Not a bad update at all this time around. As far as I can tell, no reused assets this time??? **Nice.**
---
While prices are getting better I'm personally still skeptical, nothing out here making me willingly spend real money to get Atoms. But things do look like they're getting better in the Atomic Shop. Maybe some more bundles would be a better selling point? I have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a single virtual item. *That's just my opinion.*

u/southcitytan I didn't forget to tag you in the princess bed ;)

Heya. I‚Äôm not a super hardcore player; I‚Äôd help you with whatever I can. I‚Äôm lvl 21.

I‚Äôll add you on discord so we can chat a bit.

No, but I do generally have all of the mutations. I wonder if it could be one of the area of effect variants.

**Bobblehead: Small Guns (3h 27m)**
---
How did you manage to have this amount of time?
---
Curator only doubles it, making it maximum 2 hours.
---
I went in solo at lvl. 45ish, knowing absolutely nothing about the hellstorm I was walking into.
---
It was my first character, a rifle/shotgun wielding, no PA survivalist. The 3 scorchbeasts I had to fight en route drained all my stims, most of my ammo.
---
It was the most terrifying hour of the game for me, crouching through the caverns, hardly making it to the end.
---
The final scorchbeast never took flight for me, and that made it relatively easy to stay behind cover and plink away to victory. My backup Gauss rifle saved my ass.
---
Oh the white supremacist lied for clicks? I am shocked. 
---
Yup. It comes down to acid. I will often farm the Grafton Monster and try to get vendor bot to spawn just to keep up.
---
Run up, kiss it, and then jump off the nearby cliff in PA.  50/50 it follows you, and 50/50 it survives the fall.  Never tell me the odds!
---
Heavy Guns guy here, I have all heavy guns damage/armor pierce/stagger perks and bloody mess with my weight perks being bear arms, travelling pharmacy, and thru hiker.  I might be able to ditch the last 2 if I didn't want to keep a pile of chems and water all the time.
---
I also have life giver, aquaboy, flame/explosion resistance, lone wanderer, faster stim/rad away perk, increased stimpack healing perk, and class freak/starched genes.
---
I thought it would be interesting if instead of the full-price standard game they released a "Starter Edition" with either level caps or limited progression as a significantly cheaper cost than full price. Players could then upgrade to full after playing the game for a bit. Similar to Rainbow 6 Siege...
---
For me that's not the case for some reason. If I use those two mutations, the negative effects still remain the same.
---
Because I'd rather manage this, I just keep ly damage cards equipped and suffer the encumbrance penalty. Though it could also be because of my heading tendacies (sitting with 1820 pounds of stuff, not including junk)
---
Did they take it off the store or something? What outfit are you talking about?
---
They should become permanent skills with practice. Pick 20 level 0 locks and you can unlock level 1 locks. Pick 20 of those and you can unlock level 2 locks
---
That would make sense but I‚Äôm pretty sure they aren‚Äôt weekly quests or event quests. The prison one for example you loot a warrant off a robot that attacks you to start the quest and I definitely had the warrant in my inventory, now both it and the quest are gone. Same with the ‚Äòquests‚Äô that just tell you to check out certain areas after reading a note or listening to a holotape. It‚Äôs almost as if when I log out it‚Äôs not saving some of my progress

One must also remember to have their t-shirt and slacks in their favourites, so one can quickly change out of your dinner suit and civil War era top hat

Points into Strength should increase your carry weight a bit more passively....
---
Stash needs to be unlimited change my mind

I have no problem crushing SBs solo but I still think their sonic whatever is just infuriating. When you‚Äôre geared right it doesn‚Äôt hurt much and is just excessive.

Going to try this thanks

A broken weapon stays in the inventory. Also it has an audible sound and icon when it is about to break. These did not happen when I lost the weapons.

Thank you!! I‚Äôve been saving and waiting for this very item. Woo hoo!!  You‚Äôre the best  üòÅ
---
LMFAO okay. Agreed to disagree. 
---
I feel like you‚Äôre stuck on a bias opinion, you can argue that any game gets old sure, but fallout 76 has less to do than any other Beth game. It‚Äôs not an option or an argument it‚Äôs just true

What about when scoped?

Mhmm. Shitty article writes out everything he says in the video with a small citation, send the "article" to the reddit hivemind, everybody does their part and gets off! Hooray!
---
Do you have hoarding issues in real life too or does your wife keep that in check?
---
I'm about halfway there. Run maxed-out Ammosmith. Need to pick up Super Duper soon. Honestly I tend to carry way too much food. When I actually pair it down it drops a ton of weight. Looked yesterday and had like 17 glowing meat steaks. Never gonna get through stuff like that before it rots. 
---
I would go straight dog food but I compulsively cook everything I find and it actually turns out to be a decent source of XP. Also have over-done it before and completely ran out of food for a couple of days. That's a pain.
---
Are your workbenches placed too close together. Sometimes if you try placing them too close together that can can cause. 
---
R&amp;G processing services. Behind the building off the back-porch next to the cliff rocks theres like 14 bags of cement or some such. Loads. Good for all your masonry needs. ;)
---
LOL no. The morrowind engine couldn't have run Oblivion, better specs available or no, and Oblivion didn't have the systems needed to make FO3 work. NV had the smallest tweaks but it still had to be tweaked.
---
Likewise Skyrim would have failed trying to run FO4. 
---
FO76 had the biggest changes yet; online is never easy, quick or cheap to add to a game engine, making it run well is even more so. Then they had to fundamentally change how the engine does anything; it used only revolve itself around THE player - what they were doing and where they were at. 
---
The devs had to pull that out that extremely fundamental aspect out and replace it.
---
I understand you're upset at the issues, I am too. But claiming something will never be fixed solely because it hasn't happened yet is illogical. And it also sounds like you're under the belief that engines are static, they're not. Making or licensing new engines is becoming less common because companies are discovering it pays more in terms of money and effort to keep tweaking and fixing the one they have.
---
Sorry to inform you but if you want to use mutations you need to have starched genes on at all times, or be *very* careful about your rads/use of recovery.
---
COUNTRY ROADS!!!!!

Cool idea! I am tired of swapping perks when crafting/repairing/gathering/farming.

Let me guess, back in the day...

You have an extradimensional box that links to other boxes, which fits far more than it should,  but that's not enough? 
---
Yeah I have that mutation and 13 others. The marsupial mutation was the only reason I was able to heal/stay alive because I could stay in the air long enough to pop the stimpak. All in all I used about 30 stimpaks in that fight but the majority of them were at the very end trying to stay alive until I could retreat. 
---
Forgot to mention I was overencumbered as well. If I wasn‚Äôt I probably would have tried to stay and kill them all, but I was taking a massive amount of damage from everything combined and was just beating them with a pole hook as I retreated. 
---
Some what bearable with speed demon but still the ap battle..

@xGTExDopey @Fallout There is no truth to this rumor. https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1087775312849571841?s=17
---
I might give that a shot. I'm gonna wait until I'm level 25 before trying, so that I can put on the power armor I found (the pieces were all level 25).
---
If its debunked it becomes a lie
---
I suspect this will be the case. A wheel of perk card presets like the weapon and emote wheel would be perfect
---
True, but I do it mostly for sanity and and I usually have plenty of plastic so it's no big deal. Also is better for selling junk items that go for less than 1 cap individually.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt nerf my noob no aim 1 shot gun! It was completely balanced as I 1 shot everything in the game besides 3 creatures‚Äù -in the most hillbilly voice ever

Sentinel Assassin isn‚Äôt op, if you‚Äôre staggered it‚Äôs useless, if they headshot critical you, it also does nothing. Learn to play the fucking game and stop relying on a god damn noob gun, or go play fortnite

I've been saving up all the salt I found for a week just for this post lol

I get a out 30lbs of stash back now.
---
You all have fair points I retract my statement 
---
Same. We just about survived it but we broke everything. Two of us were reduced to punching and scavenged weapons. I finally resorted to PA because I ran out of armor. Didn't realise until later that the scorched respawns were caused by looting the ultracite. Was fun.

Ha! Worth it.

I guess some people may like these, but still haven't seen anything I actually want to spend my atoms on.  Of course I missed some of the 30 minute limited stuff.
---
Don't worry. They'll add a micro transaction to add STR for various prices soon enough. Reports are saying the game is being taken off retail shelves. Free to play coming soon?
---
Amazing how long night feels when you have these perks!

I just made a video that can answers this question. Hope it helps!

---
Same I said screw it and killed it. Lolz
---
And at no point have you considered part of why might be on your end? Or will that be meet with everything else runs perfect without issue always?
---
Because my point is that if it was solely and only in Bethesda side, we‚Äôd all be having experiences that are more alike than so wildly different.
---
Consider your own words. They don‚Äôt all quit match up. Between 27-50. But you don‚Äôt have an exact number. 
---
Once you counted 27 in just a couple of hours of game play. Couple is two. So you were crashing every 4.4 minutes? Which basically means you would get on maybe have a minute or two and then crash. So you kept this cycle going for two before giving up? 
---
Or does a couple nod become 3 hours? Now we are up too 6.6 minutes a crash. Or was it four hours? So if the hours are more than a couple, would than mean you exaggerated? To make it seem worse than what you experienced? 
---
Your words I‚Äôm working with. 
---
Oh I know exactly how people act on the internet. But the OP here who destroys camps that he finds aesthetically displeasing? He justifies is as "I'm playing a raider! Suck it!" Yeah, I find those weird floating platform camps ugly, too, but 1. People who want to actually move their base find it difficult unless they are the weird ugly ones on small foundations and 2. People have been quite vocal about people attacking their camps so I don't because I'm not a self-centered jerk. Yes, even the ugly weird floating one that sometimes doesn't allow my realistic camp to spawn, causing me to reload onto a different server. 
---
So if this guy, or any other guy, wants to destroy camps despite knowing that some of their fellow players, who also paid money to play this game, really dislike it, well, they should just own it. Just say, "Yeah, I did it because I felt like it and I don't care what you think." That would at least be a genuine statement, not this I'm roleplaying a raider disingenuous bullshit. 
---
Finally, I see a lot of hand waving dismissal of player complaints with the pejorative, "safe space" baiting. This is usually accompanied by, "It's a post-apocalyptic wasteland, etc." Yes, the hyper realistic world of Fallout where human beings have invisible armor if they're wearing any kind of outfit from bathing suit to strapless evening gown to pajamas. The same world where you can get bonus points for killing a mythical creature while dressed as an actual clown (and also your invisible armor). It's so realistic that consumers have no right to complain when their bases get blown up.
---
tl;dr - Humans should have enough self awareness to recognize when they're being petty jerks and either develop some empathy or simply accept they are petty jerks and stop pretending to the internet that they aren't.

Here is a update on the build

I have 15 str with all the reduc perks on junk/armor/chems/powerarmor etc as well as have marsupial and sit at about 295 lb and still have to juggle my perks. I dont do tons of damage but i dont throw wet paper, and dont fall over like a sack. Just kind of midrange 
---
They dont fix things, they just break other things.
---
Fallout 3 was a broken mess on release.
---
Honestly, I use 3rd person because I find it easier to hit long range targets with the dot and it's also way faster to cycle between targets in 3rd, on PC anyways...
---
I cannot upvote this enough.
---
Hi,
---
This video I made might help some.
---
Thanks. I forgot to mention that I‚Äôve only ever played two games and both begin with the word Fallout 
---
I believe so, I know some early inquiries into whether or not bulking drops weight were skewed due to most people running PackRat 3*.
---
Ill do some testing in the next hour or so and update you.
---
Thanks! Is there a limit of how many animals? Like could I have 3 death claws?
---
I like this idea - at this point I'm generally just ignoring Scorchbeasts when they attack me. They're not fun to fight alone and if I run they'll eventually get distracted and leave.
---
5.56??

Give this man a cigarr, and gold-plated flip-lighter to light it with! Great acronym!

However your present the rumor as if it‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs been nothing official to support that rumor. It‚Äôs been traced back the the source. 
---
It was just speculation on someone‚Äôs part. 
---
People decided it was true because they wanted it to be true. 
---
Rumors still get passed around even after they have been debunked. 
---
LOL, you're basing whether basing it won't happen based on what? Something you pulled out your ass you say, I've never come across such definitive proof! 
---
/s
---
Critical thinking doesn't make us fan boys, it means we're not sheep who only look for quick and easy answers which are usually wrong.
---
"Also if the hacking and cheating were that big of an issue it would be fixed much quicker."
---
Thanks for outing you have zero understanding of how any this works.
---
It doesn't the size or severity of the bug, there is no standard time frame to fix any of them.
---
Because to fix a bug you need to complete three steps; reliably reproduce it on your own systems, (correctly) identify the source of the bug and then craft a fix that doesn't cause other issues (hopefully).
---
It's impossible to 100% accurately predict how long the latter two steps take.
---
And I haven't accepted any flaws at all, I just bothered to learn why they happened in the first place and called you out when you made statements that had zero basis in logic or facts.
---
&gt; You played the game wrong. you didn't read enough, you didn't walk enough. You didn't play by yourself or even with friends enough. 
---
I read every little pieces of paper I could find, I explored every location I crossed and keep doing it, I didn't check this sub before lvl 50 and found my TS handmade by myself, I played with a friend and I enjoyed the game for the most part. Even people who don't think like you can play the game as intented. 
---
&gt; breath in 1, 2, 3, breath out 1, 2,3

What you should tell to yourself before you post some nonsense.

I don't have any TSE, so I don't know how they compare but I'm sure they make my stuff look weak...

I have an instigating spiked ski sword that I really like.  A two shot lever action rifle on my stealth rifle char.  Also have an explosive pipe rifle which is nice too.

Let me turn technical data in that I found before I joined the brotherhood...
---
I recommend buying Nuka Grape from the soda fountain in the Whitesprings. If I'm not mistaken, it decreases rads by 400 pts versus Radaway's 300 without the risk of losing mutations.
---
Well modders have made an excellent Skyrim co-op with little to no resources and while I loved FO4 it could barely run itself and the glitches in this game are the same glitches that existed in the past few games Maybe a few different ones due to it being an online service. It‚Äôs just aggravating that the ‚Äúnew‚Äù content (pvp servers) isn‚Äôt necessarily new content I would have preferred a longer beta and later release but that can be said for other game (cough cough rdr2) and if private servers, dlc,  and mod support ever come most people are pretty wore out of the game already I say fuck it and work on the next title
---
Ill come check it out 
---
You have a tato plant AND a chair?  Some kind of exploit, right?
---
Thanks for the info Brotha! That makes me feel better 
---
No worries man! Unfortunately that's a pretty common disconnect issue right now. My wife and I both experience that one fairly frequently. Not as often as random server disconnects but still pretty common. And if you're only going to play a few games they may as well be Fallout! ü§ô
---
I got help from two very high level people (96 and 55ish) when I had to get the sword at around level 25. Lovely people they were. Made me a bunch of stuff for free too.
---
True

not a glitch. Lone wanderer costs an extra point all the way through

I‚Äôm on Xbox and that little dot just doesn‚Äôt cut it.

Here is how I farm cores... and exp and 3 stars as well while im doing it.

I fucking love marsupial. I've got marsupial, speed demon, electrified, healing factor, and bird bones, but being able to jump my way up a cliff face or take one flying leap to get on top of a building out of the reach of melee mobs is the best ability ever.
---
Cook the food you find, have at least 2 purifiers at your camp, except for specific fights, the only chem you ‚Äúneed‚Äù is Stimpaks and Radaway. The rest is largely unimportant. 
---
It is not possible to do this without exploiting a bug.
---
Yeah fair enough, console sensitivity is pretty low compared to PC so the change you're asking for would be a good QoL feature for you console guys.
---
That guy is an absolute piece of shit.
---
maybe you should play WoW, Survival games always make weight am issue. There is a give and take for relief from weight in all of them. 
---
So
---
Robobrains do drop fusion cores? This has been confirmed?
---
I still like the ideal of recharging FC doesn‚Äôt have fast, could do it like a trickle charger 
---
Yeah......daytime.....love it!
---
I hate dealing with carry weight issues, so I wear 5 legendary armor pieces with some sort of carry weight reduction (mostly aid and weapons). That way I can be carrying 23 dog food cans, 60 purified water, 40 stimpaks, tons of raw and cooked food, nearly 100 grenades, 3 rifles, and still have 100 available capacity.
---
I am bad at budgeting.
---
Yes. It will likely be available Thursday. Thanks!
---
Sorry none of that
---
They are very good at procrastinating bug fixes other modern releases put out patches very fast almost daily sometimes some of these glitches have been reported for years but now they decide to fix them oh well I honestly don‚Äôt care about glitches 
---
The problem is that Whitesprings is always populate with people L 100+.  If you are the only one there, it should spawn some lower level monsters.
---
Neither can a lot of things.
---
Solo medic build is tough as so much of the medic build is based on sharing cards that bounce off teammates (rad sponge + ghoulish).  You may want to focus on the legendary prefixes (auto stim type  stuff) and as much DR/HP/Dodge as possible and just be a walking pharmacy.
---
I meant the Adrenaline perk from agility. Each kill gives you 10% more damage for 30 seconds, refreshing on kills and stacking up to 60%. Fun for ranged builds.
---
Thanks for the tag and for the post. I'll see if I can find out more information. 
---
I‚Äôve sent you a friend request 
---
Any perk that has to do with Charisma is useless. But my personal opinion, you should get either Ghoulish or Lead Belly.
---
Total
---
I don't understand why Bethesda didn't create some sort of an arena where players can battle other players to their hearts' content, with the option to win legendaries. I used to play in the arena in Oblivion and it was fun. I just don't want it foisted off onto me at random times. I bet I'm not the only PvE who feels the same way and would engage in PvP in an arena.

Accepted

Seconded! I want to make my own booze!

I've had good luck with magazine spawns for games at the antique store near watoga behind the counter. Picked up 3 games magazines along with the other usual boost ones. wish there was a way to transfer them to an offline app like fo4

No, I'm just very, very happy to see you.

I cannot fight in 3rd person. I just findFirst person so much better for aiming.

You bet. Now that the Fallout 76 outrage has died down a bit, Juicehead has gone back to making gameplay videos about it, a month and a half after he *lost interest in Fallout 76*, because money talks. Instead he has jumped gun to bashing EA for cancelling the Star Wars game and on Anthem and basically anything that gets views. Sellouts.

Good point about the legendaries. I‚Äôd love to team up with people, but I don‚Äôt have a consistent group to play with. So it‚Äôs just me

If you're having issues with weight limit, try to find Pocketed (+5 max carry weight) or Deep Pocketed (+10) mods/plans for your armor.  
---
Keeping Deathclaw Steak or Ribeye Steak (from Brahmin) for hunger can kill two birds with one stone, as they grant 2 STR and +20 carry weight, respectively.

Always scrap your junk! Certain junk items weigh slightly less in bulk (Copper and Lead Scrap, if memory serves; correct me if I'm wrong here, r/FO76).

There's already tons of horrifically difficult to acquire things. Like t-51 and t-60 plans that drop from events. Even if it was available they'd still be incredibly difficult to acquire.

As of yesterday, that has a high potential to remove mutations as well.

Depends on your build. For melee chems work well at boosting damage its works on rifle builds just not as well.

So even if I get a mutation from using a serum I crafted, I can keep that mutation forever if I equip starched genes after applying the serum? 
---
There* and it depends on who you are. Some people need a lot more weight to be able to play the way they want to.
---
I have met so many awesome people on this game so far that its a treat to get on and just be able to solo lol.  If you have a mic, give mingling a try.  You may love a team medic build with all the cool shit you can do from sharing perks.

That's how you kill a game. Bethesda are many things but they are not this stupid. Zenimax would skin Todd alive for that.

I think it'd be feasible to implement I know in ESO (yes different game) that they will load you exactly where you logged out from.

What is a Glass Sniper build? I only ask because I've got a Perception/Strength dump with a 50/50 on Agility and Endurance and Intel and i can get damn good damage numbers but can take a beating outside of power armor as well. You min/maxing or something my guy?

I feel ya. It‚Äôs fun to explore...just a friendly warning. They may consider this exploiting.

So there's already moonshine in the game, right?  I don't know if I've got a recipe to make any or not, but it would be nice to have  still to do it at.  There's also that moonshine farm in the bog, it has stills you can collect from, but I didn't see a way to start the process.  Maybe that is some later DLC stuff.  Running shine could be an event for sure.

I apologise for being a dunce here, I'm just genuinely interested in learning. My character maxed at 3, but his at 4... What part of it cost an extra point?

I‚Äôm only level 19, but I like the toxic valley. Have been up and down it a few times and never seen a rad scorpion though. Mostly scorched, ghouls, mirelurks, and a  few stray snallyghasters.

I don't keep AID items in my stash, no point, only hang on to things you'll use and with that might as well keep it on your person.

I discard any and all Diluted chems.

I keep at most 10 RadX/Radaway on me.
---
I keep at most 30 stimpacks on me.
---
And since I'm a psycho user, I like to keep as many psychobuff on me as I can (the only exception to my quantity rule).
---
**Chem weight can be completely mitigated by the level 3 [Strength] perk "Traveling Pharmacy", which makes most chems weigh 90% less.**
---
As for food, I only eat dog food and drink water, I don't have a limit for dog food as I rarely come across it but for water I like to keep at most 20.

Save weight on food and drink by making soups. It recovers both at once. I'm a sniper build myself so rarely do I need to do a lot of healing. Plus the mutation healing factor helps reduce the amount of stimpacks I need. At the end of the day, I carry at most 20 stimpacks, 10 radaway, and make soups to quench hunger and thirst. 
---
Thanks. Still waiting for the Handmade rifle plan to drop from Patrol Duty. But kind of looks like it could be found in containers. Perhaps time to up my scavenger game.

It all comes down to personal preference.

This actually happens to me a lot I'm an item junk hoarder. There is a location near a cave in the North East part of the map the outside usually has an Alpha Deathclaw spawn and a Scorchbeast in the area. I usually either A: respawn 12-20 times before I can sneak out of the combat/detection zone or B. Spawn enough times and die that I get frustrated and switch to a server with no spawns.

Personally i enjoy 76, i miss proper npcs and raiders and there are a lot of glitches but i play how i played the previous game, set up a base and raid and scavenge the surroundings deep in role play.

It's Rifle Gaming. One place he tested was Monongah and in his video was an insane amount of glowing ghouls, but he said you have to go and verify that scorched are hanging out there before dropping. My gf and I did that last night and only had one pack of glowing ghouls, then it was just some mole minors and super mutants. Other than the free flora, it was pretty lackluster.
---
I wish I could trigger the protest event properly. Did it once but there was one scorched hiding somewhere the whole time, so I couldn't complete it. (and two minutes after it's over he runs out into the street). 
---
Every time after that I have been unable to actually find any of the protesters.
---
Yes marsupial and speed demon make moving over-encumbered easier. My Lvl 2 Mule account has it makes it easy to change locations when necessary
---
Ha agree. My theory is it was for the commercial, like The Wanderer. But to be fair, both were relevant and apt, even if out of place.
---
Cramburger adds 20% carry weight I believe. Deathclaw Wellington and Deathclaw Steak adds str. Buffout, bufftats, daddy-o all adds str. Alcohol adds str but at 1lb per may not be worth it.
---
Either you have a good build or carry a lot of stuff.
---
TY so much for the quick reply!
---
Yes, all mutations are permanent unless cured with rad-away. If you have level 2 starched genes it makes it so you can't gain new mutations or lose the ones you have as long as the perk is equipped. The class freak perk reduces all negative effects from mutations. I believe the reduction gets up to 75% when class freaking is maxed, but I'm not 100% sure off the top of my head. 
---
They knew there would be a limit, it was impossible not to, the question was what was a reasonable limit to launch with.
---
And the answer to that, along with most issues in the game, stems from some higher up(s) deciding to release too soon. There's too many signs of care and passion alongside the crap for it not to be the case. 
---
Balance is whack because they had to dump numbers in so items would work, but there are still signs of basic balance concepts when you examine the numbers.
---
Why do you keep harping on it being the last stash update? Taking a long time doesn't mean it won't happen, if they don't intend for it to be the last they won't say it is the last. And I've explained why it's likely taking so long.
---
There will be mod support, they've said so alongside private servers, but it will take about a year from release. 
---
Representative of the game's future? Right now the two critical issues are balance and technical limits that are too low, specifically the camp budget and the stash limit.
---
Addressing technical issues doesn't have a time table because it's impossible to 100% predict how long any of that will take.
---
At the end of the month they'll have some big update, they've said so, we hardly know what's in it because they don't want to promise what they can't deliver.
---
I've been through Diablo 3's shit launch, and I've read from others who lived through other shitty game launches. 
---
The most frustrating thing about them is that, assuming the devs and pubs keep pushing fixes and content, it takes about a year before you can project how it's gonna go.
---
I think the problem with medics is that death is hardly even an inconvenience.  I'm going to respawn nearby with full health so why waste a stimpack?  I may have dozens of stimpacks but still choose to die as it will get me out of the tight corner with these dozen ghouls (or whatever) and let me reestablish a ranged attack.

This is stupid and completely against the idea of a wasteland with PvP.

I sell all my drugs, I'm a Mutant not a druggie! Other than Rad Away of course.

I use the herbivore mutation to cook Razorgrain Soup and Purified water for all my needs.
---
I tend to be ok with carry weight.  I have X-01 with Calibrated Shocks, so my carry weight is like 325 I think?  The issue for me is keeping my stash at a reasonable level.  Although I forced my stash onto a fairly strict diet a couple of weeks ago and that seems to be helping.
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer already [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ael3ce/bethesda_can_we_get_a_stash_limit_increase/edr2562/) on this.
---
Might wanna let people know what system you play on.
---
I do use soups, I like them a lot. 
---
Rad-x is a life saver with your mutations in White Springs. It only temporarily suppresses your mutations, and makes it so you don't accidently hit one of the friendly robots with plague walker or unstable isotope etc. 
---
Oh true, if you have the rights to use a song as big as that your going to milk the shit out of it. Hell if I owned the rights to that song for anything you bet your ass I'd use it.

Just knock out the power plant event, you'll be rewarded random generator plans until you have them all, fusion generator included. The only quicker way would be to buy them and I'm unsure what they would go for in terms of caps.

The more damage you‚Äôre taking the more each hit breaks your armor. I can bathe in a scorchedbeast scream spam in my regular armor and literally take 0 dmg and 0 durability loss. Might wanna look into fireproof and some sentinel pieces

This, especially if the other paints are added into the same loot pool

Xbox Looking for group section.  Always someone selling stuff on there.  I don't know of any actual groups... usually just a bunch of dupers looking to unload stuff.

LOL, there are still major glitches and cheats in GTA online and RDR2. 
---
That isn't just Bethesda.
---
And I just explained why you can't set a time frame to fix anything. Saying every other game fixes X within Y time doesn't mean anything because they aren't 1 to 1 comparisons. The cause of an issue the right fix is never the same for anything.

What you are looking for is a plan to build it right? I am pretty sure I have it if you want a lower level one.
---
Which plant is the fastest?

I am using a power armor build, so whenever I go out, I am in my calibrated shocks X-01 armor, so my carry weight is like 325 which is plenty

Related: each rank of the Bloody Mess perk (Luck) gives you a 5% damage boost to *all* weapons, whereas the 2nd and 3rd rank of the Riflemen perks give 5% boost to rifles only.
---
Most efficient: 
---
30% damage boost
---
3 perks: [1] normal/expert/master rifleman
---
Best mid-tier:
---
45% damage boost (15% any weapon)
---
6 perks: [1] n/e/m rifleman, [3] bloody mess
---
Best 60% damage:
---
9 perks: [2] n/e/m rifleman, [3] bloody mess
---
(Same as having all [3] rifleman, but 15% damage available to all other weapons, including grenades I think)
---
Most damage:
---
75% damage boost (15% any weapon)

Agreed. I was about to do a post myself.

I'm not entirely sure, I do remember someone posting a breakdown of them all not too long ago. I just did Poseidon over and over again until I had them all. It's a bit confusing but once you learn the layout it's pretty quick.
---
LVL 150 here, I still love it. Faults and all.

Never even noticed tbh
---
Allowing us to build and clean up towns would be in line with the story. I just don't understand why they do everything they can to short circuit cooperation and rebuilding.
---
Yeah but in FO76 everytime an Bethesda employee microwaves a borrito the servers go down
---
Rad-x can be useful to temporarily stifle your mutations in situations where you need to shut down your aoe effects, like not hitting the robots in White Springs. 
---
100% agree.
---
Not only could I admire my PA but it would also allow for more room in my storage.
---
Instead of nerfing Bethesda...make this happen. We had it in FO4, I had 4 or 5 PO sets in my base.
---
Bloodied, Furious, and Anti-Armor are all probably going to trump the TSE weapons after they nerf the TS and E effects.
---
I remember it being mentioned in the noclip doc, but they seemed really usure when they said it.
---
You don‚Äôt need ammo, just a pencil...
---
Corn soup. Easy to make, fills both hunger and thirst. I just carry that and a few purified water. Drops the weight right down! 
---
I like where your head is at. Only problem is as soon as we get separate storage containers for specific items, the forums light up with feedback about how those aren't being implemented properly as well... 
---
I do love the idea of having the separate containers though. 
---
Quick side note, you're telling me we can create a damn Fusion generator from some scrap metal and a crystal shard, but we can't figure out how to create a refridgerator to keep our food fresh? Tsk, Tsk
---
Straight from Tom Howards mouth. Perfect.
---
I‚Äôve been using this mod for a month as well as the perk card management mod. It‚Äôs not a dll change or active program so I doubt they can even detect it but they know they exist and have not called them out as bad. They have mentioned other apps used for cheating though. 
---
Well it was a pleasant surprise. In fact if Bethesda change things up on purpose where your expected mob gets swapped out for another it would be cool. Imagine running into the golfhouse only to find it full of angry high level Super Mutants.
---
So opt for convenience,  run excavator armor with calibrated shocks.  With that I'm at almost 500 carry weight and can ignore having to go to camp except once every few hours....game is far more enjoyable.
---
I do make sure to scrap all my junk.  I've actually set a hard limit on how many of each kind of junk I'll keep in the stash (50 ballistic weave, 200 steel, 100 wood, that kind of thing)  I can usually stay under 500 in my stash.    But there are times when I spike up closer to 550 or so
---
So if you have Green Thumb, you could get 4 of a plant?
---
Bethesda posted on their twitter that the rumor isn't true
---
https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1087775312849571841?s=19
---
If you die in a match, between you and somebody else, fair enough. But when you die because of a mob and some gnarly imbecile takes your paperbag, they should be marked for pvp, so you atleast get a chance to get your stuff back - because thats just a greedy mofo and imo should get his/hers head bashed with a super sledge. I truely think those ppl are  lame.

Just hammer out those power stations there are three on the map hit them all and you have a good chance of getting the plan. They don't actually take an hour if your high enough level. I will do them if I'm walking by it takes around ten minutes if your quick.

I keep various flavors of mentats, but only use them to bump my int for crafting purposes.  I'll use Psycho against scorchbeasts or any other super nasty fight, same with Med-X.  Rad-X I use when fighting in a nuked area.  I need to look into mutations, but before I do that I need go level up a couple more times, put more points into luck and rank up the Starched Genes perk.

Glad I found this thread.  It still happens and is very misleading.  I was really ticked when I was low on ammo and involuntary receiving money from the lottery bot stole some (I thought). :D

No, with my mule I have not finished First Contact but the Enclave Storyline so I can launch nukes. Just head to the Abandoned Waste Dump northeast of Harpers Ferry to start the Enclave Questline.

Yooooo I am absolutely worth killing.  The caps alone per kill would bring tears to your eyes
---
"even if beth is denying it" i never said is true i just said if they want to do it idc
---
See, that's a good idea. Unfortunately for whatever reason video game companies never seem to use good ideas. Personally I think they should have looked at boblehead stacking before nerfing the guns. Or even how stacking explosive damage w the gun perks.
---
I hate nerfing in general unless it's absolutely needed.
---
Frankly they should just make pacifist mode take absolutely zero damage unless in a pvp zone.
---
I wasn't being serious about the nuking spawns part. It is annoying but there are grenades for that. I only care about 1 shotting people.ot wanting to PVP. However 1 shotting people in PVP is also a problem.
---
I'm not that confident Bethseda is going to figure out how to right this game unfortunately. Hopefully I'm wrong. 
---
it might sound stupid but inventory space is the #1 reason I stopped playing. I spent more time managing that then actually playing the game and just called it quits. stash should be like 2000. 
---
Gahhhhhhh my bff SINGS that damn song during Uranium Fever
---
I feel like the Miyamoto quote "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad" has yet to apply more perfectly to any other game.
---
If this game were delayed, I feel, or even if the beta went on a bit longer, it would've been way better. But that didn't happen, and now the game is doomed to constant negative outlook. Even with the circulating rumors of the game becoming free to play, I still see people saying they won't even give it a try.
---
You keep all the god armor in your stash box wrapped in tissue paper as you go to kill the SBQ in your smalls and a Hazmat suit, real men would understand ;) and real Women of course!
---
Confirmed.  Also a great spot to farm mutations due to the nuclear waste and rad shower being right next to each other.  As for the 91 DC, if you don't see him it's probably because he hasn't burrowed up out of his lair yet.  When you get close enough, he does.  He's always there for me.   Like State Farm.
---
Not a piece.
---
The entire suit of PA.
---
Obviously it's not meant to be played like this, so I'd welcome a fix.
---
It's something Bethesda should know about or look into.
---
Nukes torn the fabric of space and time...so could fit lore wise lol.
---
Sounds good but I also want lvl 50 + specialized build defining perk cards to unlock. 
---
I‚Äôm mostly ok with them. The only complaint is their sonic spam is also graphic spam and makes it difficult to aim. I realize I should just dodge them to reduce damage until they land before I press the attack but I like taking potshots.
---
I think your comment about how they‚Äôre what Skyrim dragons should have been is a pretty interesting point. Even the vaunted Deathclaw isn‚Äôt as scary anymore.
---
Yes, sort of. But it is all handled after you connect to the server, not before. Goes like this:
---
1. Log on and get a warning that my CAMP spot is occupied, and will be restored at my next log on, or I can move it for free one time on the current server. (oddly there has never actually been a camp that I can see at that spot that would conflict with mine. Easy to tell because it will place you in the world at your CAMP location still)
---
2. Server Hop and CAMP is there where it's supposed to be.
---
3. When I do move the CAMP, there appears to be one full copy of all the stored items for each time this has happened, since I last built it.
---
Playing around with your camp shouldn't require much junk, if you're storing instead of scrapping the more expensive parts (or just placing the CAMP down and effectively paying caps to store everything), no need to re-craft structures when you can just pull em out of storage.
---
If you're doing all the crafting for your team, I could see that being expensive, but that is also a role you chose in a game where everyone has the ability to craft everything.  Why aren't they doing their own crafting?  Not to suggest you be selfish, but they have their own inventories and stashes probably full of junk, so you're not exactly forced into that role.  And if you have so much stuff in general, you could instead help them out with plans or junk to sell to buy plans on their own.
---
I mean it's nice that you do it, I help others out with crafting and upgrades too, but I'm not sure it's unreasonable that the game doesn't support storage equivalent to 4 additional alts to support it on the scale you're apparently doing it.  That's 3000lbs total stash, plus whatever inventory space they have at their levels, SPECIALS, and perks.  Getting frustrated at hitting the 600lbs storage limit on one character is understandable, but if you've given yourself 3000lbs of stash and that's still not enough...
---
If they give us an extra 200lbs stash, how much would it actually help considering you've used 4 alts for an additional 2400lbs of stash already?  They were hesistant to give us that one upgrade, but had they given the same upgrade to us every week we'd still not be at the capacity you use.  It seems like you're going out of your way to hoard and craft to an unusual extent, and it doesn't make sense for Bethesda to alter the game to support a style of play that, while I can't speak for everyone, I'm comfortable guessing is far from the norm.
---
Honestly it doesn't look like you've made any bad decisions yet, considering you're at 5 or under with each stat and perk cards come easily enough.
---
I initially started out using junk shield, evasive, etc. for the mitigation but quickly realized that stealth is a much better shield and has the added bonus of damage increase.

If you're worried about the build, I would simply focus on the parts you*know* you'll be using for now, so you're not too far off base later on. I think you'll find that 5 of those extra points in strength would be better served in luck, for example, to get class freak and starched genes for mutations. There's a 50 damage resist mutation, another for 100 energy resist, etc. Plus you get faster run/reload, higher jumping, etc. Serums are inexpensive these days.
---
At the end of the day, you won't go wrong with 3 12 5 4 5 6 8 if you're going rifles, then increase from there. Here's what I would consider if you're hellbent on no VATS, PA, sneak, etc.:

Considering the weight reduction and hack/lockpick perks all are often swapped in and out, there oughta be a way to make gameplay smoother without having to go thru potentially 3 or 4 menus just to be able to carry an item you just picked up.
---
Really, this idea I like.
---
I don't have those. So for me, Rad-x is a no go. I sell all mine. But your right. Sometimes suppressing them is good, depending on your mutations and circumstances.
---
I can see this being potentially problematic if there is a significant disparity between factions in regards to popularity. You could end up server hopping for an hour trying to find room in BoS, while Responder has plenty of open spots. (factions pulled out of my ass, not commenting on those to factions specifically)
---
At 100% the game would bog down from carrying to many items.
---
I already suffer this because I can carry over 500 lbs without being overweight, and that comes with food and junk and chem perk cards so without those I'm at like 1800 lbs.  The game gets laggy unless I go purge some stuff every once in a while.....so being able to carry even more would make the game unplayable sadly.
---
They are roughly the same layout. The one by Charleston was slightly lower level.

Nobody should listen to anything this jackass says.

If you are on PC I will give you caps for the Furious (I already have a Bloodied)

Much obliged, friend.
---
Sure,  but I wouldn't say make it bottomless. I could do with a couple hundred point bump, though.
---
At first it was cute, but now it's just annoying. I wish he was passive. It can be a PITA to have to clear the area just to see what he's got.
---
I agree weight us a huge issue. I also have a rifle sneak build with speed demon. I just accept that I have too sacrifice points in strength for weight reduction. Sure 5 more points would be awesome but its just the way the cookie crumbles 
---
I would just like the perks I have to affect my dam stash, I carry tons of junk around because it weighs less on me then in the stash.
---
What about having the town in a separate world space?
---
No pvp is the only reason I'm gonna play soon... def not stupid however very broken.. ya the duping shit was def stupid as hell, but why play multiplayer games if all I can do is see other ppl who wont talk fight or trade with me??  Fuck fighting npc's most game AI is trash and other players totally change that.. but not hear cuz they jus stay silent and fast travel away..
---
Ahh hehe yeah.  sometimes finding your paper bang among long grass can be a pain :)
---
Even if the whole ‚Äútown thing‚Äù doesn‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôm hoping they at least go with your idea 
---
What does it mean by ‚Äúwearables random drops‚Äù? You get them from killing things in that region?
---
I hope so I really don't want it to go free to play especially this early when they haven't even fixed it, added new content, etc. Need to get my monies worth. But, then again just cause the twitter says that doesn't mean they can backslide into it few weeks to months from now.
---
You dare blaspheme against our lord and savoir fo76?! Heretic! Ready the bonfire so we may cast this sinner upon it whilst we plug our ears with fingers and recite our most holy of chants "La la la, I can't hear you, la la la, amen."
---
SBQ dropped 6 level 45 items for me this week... it's stupid. Should be level 50.
---
It's better than not getting loot at all I suppose :(
---
Yes and yes!
---
I've been doing this for last 4 hours.  It's a lot of fun.  I've only been shot twice.
---
What about sticking with some original lore by bringing back the [G.E.C.K (Garden of Eden Creation Kit)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Garden_of_Eden_Creation_Kit)
---
I sell all the addictable meds I find like MedX.
---
I carry some RadX (diluted because full-strength suppresses mutations), RadAway, Stimpaks (also diluted), Disease Cure, and 1-2 Addictol in case I drink a bunch of alcohol.
---
I make a lot of corn soup, which counts as both food/water. I cook and sell everything else.
---
Same!
---
It would be worth it!
---
Lol.i have that one too. 
---
Call it the Fast Appalachian Reponse Team - ‚ÄúWe Don‚Äôt Fart Around!‚Äù
---
Quick question: what are the fake controversies you've seen? I've been staying away from the sub so I am curious to what's going down there.
---
Assuming you talking about the level 2 rifleman perks it's trading 15% bonus to everything to 15% only rifle.
---
Then people would essentially be ‚Äúrebuilding‚Äù America!
---
This game is intended to be supported for years. 
---
They've already said mods and the private servers will happen, but it will be about a year from release.
---
I get being bored, I'm currently just logging in to merchant farm an X-01 jetpack. I would spend tons of time on my camp but I've hit the limit hard and I've already done weird build techniques to free up space.
---
Like freaking garage doors, which are two walls wide, take up as much space as a single static wall. I guess that means they had so much stability issues they put a blanket budget amount on several categories until they could evaluate individual objects.
---
As for the patch at the end of the month, yeah I'm not stoked about anything except the mod scrap fix. But they also haven't said much about what's in it, hopefully they have a lot more and just don't want to promise what they can't 110% guarantee delivery of. 
---
You don't need to do the for perk cards.  If you have 10 Int + Marsupial you can still equip 10 points worth of cards.
---
The -5 only affects whatever the stat does for you itself not your loadout points.  It becomes a pain when it a stat like STR that actually lowers your carry weight and melee damage.. that's when you want to negate the negative stats.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44380/kw
---
In what way? The point is that you cant be a tank dps melee/heavy weapons/sniper build who also likes grenades, and is a master hacker/lockpick, at least not all at the same time, I'm sorry my incorrect spelling of a word confused you, enough to have to correct me lol. It was totally productive to the conversation. As was this rant. Meh 
---
&gt;How many equally know that these people are getting their bag, keeping the original bag, and got $5 in-game currency compensation as well?
---
Not everyone got it, Bethesda made it opt in. The fact that it happened was just another incident in a long series of fuck ups.
---
&gt;They wouldn't tell you that, as keeping you in a cycle of outrage and then giving you videos that talk about the same thing to validate your outrage is how they make money. Squashing that outrage when it's no longer warranted makes them no profit.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The Kotaku (you actually used Kotaku as a source LOL) article you link to doesn't verify anything, it uses the reddit post it's reporting on as it's source, which is unverified.
---
&gt;The verified part of it, by Bethesda, was that only usernames were revealed.
---
Bullshit. 
---
Here's the [Bethesda statement](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1070532247072182272?s=09) - they said that the **user's name, contact information, and proof of purchase info** were all leaked. That includes the person's name, home address, email, ign, &amp; last 4 digits of CC number. They had to include a receipt as PoP.
---
&gt;The point being that these aren't people out here calling out glitches, or on some crusade to make programmers bug check better - they're just using any excuse, any glitch - no matter how common - to *create* a fiasco for this particular game.
---
In a game that's supposed to be PVP, the xp and duping glitches were (are?) game breaking and were in-game game far longer than they should have been. How many videos on YouTube showing how to do it? How many people on here bragging about catching dupers/those doing the leveling exploit? Shoot, there was a guy in one of the 76 trading subs selling a huge variety of TSE for 200 caps each, just to prove a point. Didn't take long for him to sell out too.
---
&gt;&gt;In a vacuum, "any normal glitch" or "the existence of a dev room" wouldn't be much of a story. But with the heaping mountain of shit surrounding FO76, those things get amplified because it's become a running joke that "every time you think Fallout 76 has hit rock bottom, they prove you wrong".
---
&gt;More like "Something else that was less than perfect happened with this one particular video game: Public - BE OUTRAGED!"
---
When a bird shits on a new car once, people are still wowed by it. Not so much when the car is so covered in bird shit that you can barely see out the windshield.
---
Your tangent on verified sources and doing research is especially funny tho, given Bethesda admitting what was leaked. 
---
nah i already have the plan for it, i just need to get to level 40 to use it, but that shouldn't take that long since i also have to grind the materials required for it :).
---
yes. 
---
Are you available to do the trade today 
---
Appreciated! :)
---
That sounds like a lot of fun and a quest I'd be interested in doing.
---
A standard Xbox crash, it tends to happen when there's too much stuff going on from what I noticed while playing games
---
My only problem with SBs is that their sonic attack completely blinds me, and sometimes it *is* bugged, and they fire it literally non-stop. Again, I'm fine with the damage, but I might as well turn off my monitor and fire based solely on directional audio when this happens.
---
I'm calling bullshit on stash affecting servers, hell they are tracking  near all world loot individually, so 1000's of items. So we are supposed to believe they can track if picked up that can in the last __ hours but a few digits on your stash stacks is game breaking, bull shit. 
---
Hopefully they go with plots, so people could build in plots, having limits so people don‚Äôt go overboard
---
Poseidon power planet should be lowest level enemy are lv6 scorched. U get generator plan in order : small &gt; medium &gt; large &gt; windmill &gt; fusion 
---
This might be slightly OT, but does having a -2 INT cause you to decrease the amount of INT cards you can equip? I‚Äôve never noticed being penalized and having to re-equip cards due to item or mutation stat modifiers.  
---
Pretty sure the first job was to stop people from having infinite weight / duping millions of items. Once that looks good and everything evens out, I'm sure they will continue that path. There is still a lot of optimization to do, especially on console. Game still freezes and crashes for us due to high loads of stuff to load in quickly in nukes /new areas/ loading in / opening peoples stashes who have 5 billions items because they cheated. Pretty sure that last one has also recently been looked into. 
---
true.
---
it's particularly helpful for ghouls though because they have no ranged weapons.
---
so you literally can stand on top of something just out of reach and then shoot em.
---
Wait, where do you get the BoS and Camo Jumpsuits and also the VTU Jacket and Cap?  
---
Also it would've been awesome if you had included the locations of where to find all of these actually.
---
well for now the official stance is it is not going f2p. so at least the current rumor should die off even though it had no reason to exist to begin with.
---
Of course! Maybe there could be a arena for people to fight for scrap/caps
---
And after all that this idiot just played the victim and claimed *he* was the target of online harassment. I'm surprised how YouTube lets him keep doing this on their platform. 
---
DARN YOU, I spent all night trying to make that acronym work and you just did it!
---
I like your ideas
---
The witches had zero chill too haha. Number of online games I played, just for some noob to disturb the witch was unbelievable 
---
What you mean? They found your camp without being near it?
---
Saved.
---
Add it to my growing list of threads.
---
So far i have:
---
- bobbleheads cannot bypass pacifist mode
---
- camp budget doesnt grow with leveling
---
- bulking (is still) only worthwhile for alum and lead
---
Locked doors on a camp = violence trigger for some players :)
---
Wow. I run 1 str, no PA and no deep pockets on my stealth build with rank 1 traveling pharmacy as only weight reduction perk. 
---
What do you pick up?
---
Marsupial roughly doubles your jump height.
---
It also gives you some extra carry weight, but lowers your intellect a bit.
---
Which makes it all the more ridiculous that an article with his content front paged gaming. Delusional.
---
Well there's 8,760 hours in a year. So with the remaining 1,160 hours divided into 365 (I'll leave off the .25 day part) a person would have ~3.2 hours every day to do something other than play FO76.
---
So yeah, some no lifer will probably get it then promptly die from health issues. 
---
Diluted rad-x will not suppress the mutations, throwing that out there.
---
I have marsupial, and I'm saving caps for speed demon right now.
---
SUPER KANGAROO ACTION
---
Towns would be trading hubs, residential hubs, and miscellaneous things to do as well. Previous cites in Fallout happened, and since 76 takes place 25 years after the bombs fell, these would be the first cites
---
Poseidon. I can do it in 7-8 minutes solo.
---
I lol‚Äôd
---
Which I would love if content could continue to be added. Could be one of the greatest games of the decade if the right decisions are made. Hopefully the player base stays and they release items in the atomic shop that aren‚Äôt crayon skins to sustain continued support
---
Did this happen today on Xbox?
---
On Xbox they can go to their recents tab and join your new server. On PC this does not work (no Join option from recents, only friends). I'm not sure how it works on PS4. What platform are you on? 
---
I reckon Zenimax wouldn't release funding to add multiplayer/co-op support for future titles, so they pitched a standalone multiplayer game using creation engine.
---
Now creation engine has multiplayer support.
---
Also. You may have spawned back in the same server. Happens sometimes.
---
Still doesn't stop the shit talking.
---
Thanks Jess! :)
---
Lol that's your tv
---
Yeah, I have issues with lag as well. Though it still kills me a little, I've started to get used to dropping so many items that I would normally store.
---
Good Information none the less, because eventually it's about long game. Melee build seems meta sofar. There is a way to plan it so as you level, you build balanced. By the time you hit lvl 45 and 50 you will have your lockpick skill (etc), and you will be ready for that 3rd leveled perk. It's food for thought.
---
How about a Legend?
---
You don't get them in a specific order and the power plants only drop the last 3 
---
I use a .50 hunting rifle, a .38 combat rifle, and a handmade in 5.56 and the ammo load is killing me
---
&gt; 3 rifleman perk cards (maxed out)  
---
Each rank is 3 points for 20% damage, bloody mess is 3 points for 15% damage.
---
PREACH! It is asinine to make players consume copious amounts of food like this, and even more asinine to force us into getting perks to reduce our rate of hunger and thirst.
---
I got them in that order .-.
---
I used to do work for the Fast Acronym Repository (Tactical).
---
Is a set of indestructible X01 Power Armour legendary?

It would take me 3.5 five years to get that if all my free time was devoted to this gameüòÇ probably just gonna have to buy atoms lol
---
I think you guys are forgetting that you still get disconnected everytime it rains or a super mutant farts. What do you think this would do to the server? It‚Äôs nice to dream guys, but we all know Bethesda isn‚Äôt capable of something this innovative, atleast not for a good while. Only thing they‚Äôre good at anymore is screwing ppl around.
---
You mean r/gaming? That's another hivemind of hatemongers. Hell, even r/Fallout is gradually warming up to 76, and there are literally scores of posts about 4 being a great game. I guess shitting on the newest game is just what's *in*, and the people on r/gaming have kept on karma farming for ages with their "Witcher 3 good EA bad" for ages, along with the new "Bethesda bad 76 garbage".
---
I would rather someone talk about real reasons they don't like something rather than just making shit up.
---
I did not :(
---
Xbox One GT: Uneekxsole
---
After loading in to a world I cannot move. I can switch weapons but can't move, usually have to leave the server to fix it. It's becoming more prominent.
---
No, it doesn't affect your perk cards.
---
To be honest, I have no idea what effect it actually has.  Nothing I've noticed, for sure.
---
Step one is resolving dupers and item exploits.  Giving dupers extra stash is just encouraging them to abuse the system.
---
Yes, miles also abuse the system, but they aren't a globally addressable storage system like a stash.  Character inventories are tied to a specific character's state, not a global game state... and miles eventually log out.
---
Once we resolve, or at least mitigate, duping  we can get stable stash.
---
As for storage limits, I rarely hit them.  I scrap anything I don't need, sell off legendaries for their face value at bots without being upset at their sales price because I get so many, and never carry more than one of a type of weapon.  The only thing I struggle with is aid item hoarding, but I'm even learning to let go.
---
I can't fathom what value managing multiple mules, with the requisite effort to track anything, would provide me, value wise.  It just seems like more frustration than value.
---
Because how many pounds would they have to bump for you to drop your mules?  5000 lb.?  People who hoard items will continue hoarding items.  People will just complain they have to manage 5 mules because 10,000 lb of stash isnt enough.
---
Great, now I have to go look lol
---
I think Bethesda will be fine without your lone monthly subscription.
---
Yeah, it's not fun. But i mean, it's not like games are supposed to be fun, right??
---
Stop carrying so much *shrugs*
---
Aren‚Äôt these effect just the effects that are on civil unrest, all rise, and bunker buster?
---
Usually appears on the top right corner of someone's profile ( mobile ) , or under their karma ( PC ). 
---
I'm not sure why, but it doesn't appear under your account when I tried to follow you to test it out. There's just nothing there lol.
---
Yeah but I think cranberry bog is a fissure prime aka queen only spawns there. So some people are bored which I get. But like how many posts do we need about the same thing you know?
---
close out of vendor go back in and buy it back.
---
I haven't fast traveled since like level 3, lol. I'd really like the perk that allows you to fast travel while overencumbered, but until then,  my dude is getting a lot of exercise.
---
Radshield is best. its pretty easy to make too. Just go to the dam in the mire and follow the river south, during the day you get the Strangler Bloom there.
---
I had a regular crew and whoever was in the lead in Versus was supposed to disturb the Witch and then back-track into the rest of the team and try to survive making someone else take the fall for it.
---
It was usually pretty easy because the Witches seemed to path to  whoever was shooting them last &amp; was closest, so all you had to do was get behind someone and they'd fire because *OH FUCK A WITCH* and then you get to live and probably kill her.
---
Hmm, lucky chance I guess. I was lucky and got the fusion first time on my main
---
I don't see how this rumor even got any traction.
---
Where is the money-making aspect for Bethesda by going F2P? The Atom Store? Hahaha.
---
I have 2000 Atom (accrued in-game, not $) and there's nothing to spend it on!
---
I usually start my session by hitting Big Bend Mine and grabbing all the Brain Fungus for soup. Usually holds over long enough to last my play session, but maybe that's not for everybody.
---
Or at least make some of the cards passive. Hacking and Picklock should obviously passive.
---
Gunsmith, Demolition Expert, and Makeshift Warrior should be semi-passive meaning you don't need them equipped to modify and make things but you need them equipped if you want the stronger explosions and slower weapon breakdown. 
---
You carry 50 stimpaks? What build do you play? I carry 10 most of the time and i'm good. I double up to 20 for a nuke zone/nuke run etc but 50? Seems like a lot of wasted weight for lots of what ifs?
---
Totally Our World Now, Suckas! &gt;_&gt;
---
Yeah, if I knew what system you were on, I wouldn't mind joining.
---
Have you played other multiplayer games before? This kind of communication is often free and easy, not a chore where you have to chase people down, hope they want to talk and hope they have a mic. 
---
No it isn't.  Anything is a possibility. An assumption is ["A thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof."](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/assumption)  I didn't say that it would happen.  I said that it could happen.
---
Did any of them try adding you? Also server hopping seems kinda fixed in that I notice I switch servers and sometimes end up on the same server I left.
---
I've gotten those Chinese robots a few times.
---
Anyone who thought it might is a moron.
---
Oof
---
The problem is, this game needs to go free to play in order to attract more people to the atom shop, the only way Bethesda is going to be able to support this game for years to come.
---
If you think whoever runs the twitter account has knowledge of another way to generate income, that might be a better question to ask since you're expecting an honest answer from a question they can **only** answer "NO" to.
---
Yeah I did this one 3 times in a row, server hopping. Took maybe 30ish mins in total. 
---
If they keep working on it with bug fixes and updates, this game will be quite a lot better in the foreseeable future. I have my hopes.
---
Since day one this is what I wanted. Even during the beta I felt the whitesprings was an awful middle hub, and we should be building a town in the forest. I'm hoping we get plots of land (randomly placed between the [server size#] number of plots in a select area, kinda like an animal crossing thing, that persist through servers). This is where we spend all those caps to buy our neighbors junk from their vendor bots. 
---
Or what if we found a mall / vault and just started building that there. The possibilities are endless. I have high Hope's for perminant game changes as the game progresses. 
---
Again you still fail to read.  I was not over encumbered, when I died my excavator armor weight bonus no longer applied making me then become over encumbered.  Further I didnt log out I disconnected because the servers are unstable so had no choice but to log back in after an unplanned event.
---
The reality is your being a troll for the sake of being a troll......Bethesda needs to implement many fixes.....this is an example of one of them.  Trying to explain it away just shows you lack any semblance of intelligence....or are simply being a tool because it amuses you.
---
I suspect you didn't play fallout 3 on release.  The spawn cordinates were off and it had a habit killing critical npc's as a result, epically at megaton.  Console had no way to resolve this sort of thing outside of lucky save or campaign restart.  Loved to permanently vanish followers too.
---
Nah, a few days ago on PC.
---
Yup from the first Everquest on.
---
So I do have some experience in what I‚Äôm talking about. 
---
This exact thing happened to me once. People said it was because it was leftover after a nuke zone. Exactly as you describe except they were metal piles and not meat piles on the ground.
---
Almost every mob gave me legendary items.
---
I totally understand, my grammar also tends to get somewhat rubbish late in the evening. Allow me to offer apologies on my end as well, I just reviewed my previous post and realized it could come across as snippy. I only wanted to mention the enemy respawns because it's a thing quite a few of people don't know about Fallout :-)
---
In regards to your second paragraph, I honestly don't blame you for not noticing, as I didn't figure out about it until I started diving into wikis and figuring out the (often silly) exploits in Fallout 4 (and Skyrim). 
---
As mentioned previously, the reset only occurs if the player is absent from the cell for a specific length of time. The problem is that the game never actually TELLS you that this reset happens, and it can take up to 30 **in game days** (length may be somewhat shorter in FO4, but it is exactly 30 in FO3 and Skyrim). This basically means you will rarely see any resets in major settlements or locations you frequent, unless they use a different calculation or you deliberately avoid them for 30 in game days. So unless you are crazy person like me trying to farm Nuka Cola lunchboxes in Nuka World, it is super difficult to notice.
---
Also, when you hear people refer to containers as "unsafe" to store items in, this is what they are referring to, as the container restocks with a specific item or class of item. 
---
As for your 3rd paragraph, I totally agree! I never thought of it that way before now, but it totally makes sense. More distinct zones of farming that are actually conveyed to the player AND regularly get to function (like FO76 does) is definitely preferable to having the same system and not knowing about it (or having to resort to gimmicks to get it function regularly).
---
Sorry for the text tsunami, I'm just super fascinated with how games work under the hood,  and I love learning about their quirks. Anyways, thank you for an intriguing conversation!
---
They still haven't fixed that after I put a ticket last November? That bug existed since the beta, glad avoiding that event forever since they never bothered to fix it.
---
I'm averaging 10 hours pet crash on ps4, more so at launch than now.
---
Dcs are very rare for me but my network setup is squeeky clean
---
Then dont use tse weapons, problem solved.
---
Since the last patch I disconnect constantly regardless of weight so it doesnt even matter currently.......Bethesda being bethesda.
---
A stack of 100 razorgrain will rot into 1 spoiled veggies.

Tried moving your camp yet?
---
Did u already have the other generator when u do the event?
---
well there were no nylon bags to complain about lately so they needed something.
---
I am over 3700 atoms and there are a few things I want but keep expecting something new better and more costly so I have yet to spend them XD
---
Yeah I have the pic at the exact same place but it's from behind it
---
Ass someone who puts in over 300 hours per title, I despise Fallout 76. I have not played it, and it hurt so much to wait until after the game was released. 
---
I chose to wait this time because the ending of fallout 4 was just terrible, and it was anti climatic. No replay after I beat it. I knew something was going to be fishy about this new title, and as I suspected, it was terrible.
---
You did indeed say if. 
---
I was asking for prayer of because this issue has come up before, fueled by YouTuber speculation. 
---
And stores may very well remove the game from shelves. Non game stores generally cycle through displayed titles far faster than a place like EBGames. 
---
They want the newest displayed along with the constant big sellers. Even if that means other titles stay on their shelves for short periods of time. 
---
I checked the workshops they took and they weren‚Äôt taken by them.
---
DUUUUURKAHJUUUUUBS
---
update...Fuuuuuck ugh. When i restarted my game yesterday literally everything was gone. Even stuff i built. Oh well. I‚Äôll make a noob hut again but I hope that player doesn‚Äôt notice its gone and think I wasn‚Äôt grateful for it üòì
---
Thank you for reporting this to us!   
---
After looking into it, we found that while it is possible to build on top of the Classic Column, we also agree that it‚Äôs difficult to do at the moment. We‚Äôre investigating ways we can make this a better experience and will let you know once we have a fix in place. In the meantime, some players have found that playing with the item's rotation may help you place it on top of the column, here are a couple of screenshots:

---
wasting money on a game worse than NMS xD
---
Yeah its a lot of fun for sniping, since it took bethesda so long to finally add hunting rifle legendaries, yet to see one.
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been echoed here several times already but considering the OPs very valid point about constantly having to manage your cards to manage your carry weight it would be really great if in a future patch they allow your equipped weight reduction cards to affect your stash weight too. I‚Äôm lvl 53 and only just figured out that they didn‚Äôt. After moving my stored chems from my stash back to my person and a bit of equipment swapping I found an easy extra 25 lbs wiggle room that would have been great to understand and know about before now. 
---
On XBOX you can have up to 5 characters on a single gamer tag. If you want more you create new gamer tags. I'm amazed at the amount of work people will do to cheat a game; even if they sell weapons on the Black Market for real world money
---
You can get faster rate of fire legendary on it.
---
A whole lot better than you it seems
---
Have to get armor with weight reduce effects I have 2 for chem food drink etc and 2 for weapons and 1 for ammo only thing that weighs me down is junk but I normally do junk runs and throw on excevator with shocks and just go crazy 
---
I go between the weightrooms at firestation and green county lodge and pick up weights then server hop.  
---
That‚Äôs it then. I‚Äôm on Xbox. How did they find my camp though? 
---
As a birder I very much appreciate of this idea.
---
I still got 3.5m in stash from stash bypass 
---
What happened to the updates?
---
I wish you could make your own protest sign. Mine would say "scorched lives matter". &lt;_&lt;
---
I actually only have the small generator, medium and the fusion. And only recently got the medium as a world drop
---
I've thought about just dropping a camp system there with no structure so that a turret camp doesn't spawn if I was on the server first.
---
I just hit 40, so I'd be willing to team up if you're interested.
---
Ya they found it and it was clear on the other side of the map.
---
Its part of the Enclave quest line. If it was a random player there with you it was probably his quest box.
---
Tried. The frame doesn't show up in the vendor's inventory. It's gone.
---
I never noticed much issue with auto guns on ps4 pro
---
It took me an hr server hop got the last 3 generators lol I already had small medium. 
---
Well if you wish to ignore all the videos that show massive slow downs when people have a ridiculous number of unique items in their inventory (stuff that doens't stack), as well anecdotes such as mine.
---
Early on in this game I had ~0.5 second delays in switching Pip-Boy tabs. Dumping all of my non-quest notes in my stash eliminated the delay (I had tons of notes, and now I don't pick them up).
---
And it's not the digits. Stacking items are multiples of items; if you have 500 shotgun shells the game reads that as the "shotgun shell object" having a property of "ammo count = 00500".
---
The extra zeroes are a hypothetical limit to the number of shells you could have, basically there's zero data difference between 1 shotgun shell and 99,999 shells.
---
Armor and weapons that don't stack, yeah they clog CPU power. They all have individual conditions and mod properties that can be different at any time. And each one has way more property data than a shotgun shell object.
---
Creeped in there after a higher level person who was farming.  They cleared out the ghouls and I got my sword.
---
Were there other people in your area? That is usually a supply drop for an enclave quest.
---
Here you go :
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wM7oP0FyDKU
---
To all the people that have been saying that the game is going free to play. 
---
Bethesda came out today and said the rumors are false. 
---
Once again showing that some people are spreading rumors simply to hurt the game, for whatever reason. 
---
You were all so sure that this was going to happen. 
---
Do we get to drive around and smuggle it into the different cities too?
---
they are putting things in shop weekly, some are limited edition. these come and go so they're kinda unique, give it time and they will take your atoms/ money 
---
I came here for the oddity. 
---
A TSE user who isn't drenched in sad, whiny tears. 
---
Good on you guy. Great outlook. 
---
I know when I load into the game if I press tab I can't move sometimes and have to find a server even though I can still fast travel in that server. Never really had issues fast travelling and losing stuff, guess I should be careful really don't want to lose my calibrated excavator and weapons. 
---
so fucking boring, that whiny charmless voice droning on and fucking on with nothing to say but ten minutes to fill at a time 
---
its not downvote because this is a place of helping.  
---
How long ago was this and was it on ps4?
---
When your fast traveling is the weapon out like your in combat mode or just equipped?
---
Where is your base located?  Is it near Top of The World?  Was there a nuke zone shortly there after?
---
My base is near the middle silo that launches the nukes. It actually launches and has stages. I am wondering if this was part of the rocket that fell back to earth after launch. 
---
And how would you compare the social tools and in game community in those games to fallout 76?
---
LOL, there were people all over a thread i started insisting that it was true, challenging me to prove it wasn't. insisting that was going to happen.
---
Ha ha ha. 
---
You're better than this game, Ryan. Go play something else.
---
YES! Loadout tabs like Warframe or something similar would be fantastic, and it would be a simple fix to a very tedious system.
---
No they didn‚Äôt. It wasn‚Äôt the same server because I checked the workshops to see if they were owned by the same players.
---
Vital tip: make sure you have a disease cure or two on you at ALL TIMES. With speed demon if you contract parasites you can literally watch your nourishment meters drain 
---
They have a chance of being unlocked and for radium rifles it has a lower chance then most
---
Craft and scrap armors to learn all their plans. Gets rid of over half of it - steel, rubber, plastic, leather, cloth, asbestos.   
---
Do leather first, then light combat, then trapper, then marine, then the screw-requiring ones.
---
ouch. please tell me you learned to make it at least? When I sold my leg (and didnt realize it before I logged off) I found out the hard way if you didnt read the terminal before finishing the quest you cannot build it.
---
So your frame poofed but it dumped the pieces into your inventory?
---
If I count every time I left bulked scrap in a suitcase near a vendor I could easily have accrued several thousand weight. I have noticed same thing regarding running under or over 1k
---
Been there done that. Last time it happened I ended up chasing a legendary 3 star eyebot across the golf course. They can really go when they want to. üòÜ
---
Weird. I had a spare chassis with Level 15 Raider Armor in my Stash, so I pulled it out of mothballs. Went to place it and now have 2 chassis in my inventory. Placed them both and one was my Excavator armor. That was odd. Crisis averted.
---
Craft and scrap marine armor pieces. It'll eat all your asbestos and make you wish you had more.
---
The most efficient is travel pharmacy, bandolier and thru hiker especially. Extra 50 for carrying things like stimpaks that weigh 1 lb or make them weigh .1 thats a lot better honestly
---
Was the chestpiece equipped? I got too many legendary armor pieces using the same legendary effect to keep up with my inventory.
---
Oh just spotted this on another post
---
[Bethesda on 76 F2P](https://twitter.com/bethesda/status/1087775312849571841?s=19)
---
Good on you. Too many people who find an exploit of some sort keep it quite, and just add to 76's reputation as "a buggy mess." How can Bethesda fix things if no one tells them what's broken? 
---
\+karma
---
They'll be available in the Bethesda Launcher
---
I'll be on in an hour or so. GT is same. Message me on xbox when you're on.
---
I think we should all leave dislikes on his videos ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
Near the satellite arrays, right on the border between the bog, the mire and the savage divide. It's near a nuke zone, yeah. I logged off shortly after, so I don't know if anything went off.
---
Was pretty cool regardless!
---
Isn't risky using mods on PC since people are getting ban for having specific background software on during the game and mods?
---
Hrmmm. I'll have to test that. I still have the original set.
---
Big developers spend less on servers and networks per player. "Penny pinching" if you wanna give it a name.
---
He mostly likely dropped it to reduce weight or just to get rid of it and if one person has a bag close by and you drop something else for example all of their junk the bag will teleport to where they died and have the armor and junk inside it
---
Have another meager upvote 
---
I've seen someone make a post about Bloody Mess previously. It's not necessarily a straight 15% increase in damage because of where it is applied to the damage calculation. It comes at the end of the calculation which often results in a bigger increase than just a flat 15%. I'm sure someone else can explain it better than i can.
---
Exploding heads is worth it let alone anything else though!
---
do you know how much fo76 has pulled in/is generating for bethesda? if so care to share the number?  
---
director of PR work for you then : [https://twitter.com/PR\_Flak/status/1087777286361878528](https://twitter.com/PR_Flak/status/1087777286361878528)
---
I love how bethesda's offical response is still not enough for trolls to give up on this line of bullshit.
---
I helped someone who was being terrorized by a deathclaw. I felt proud of my good deed for the day so I celebrated by murdering 1000 super mutants. &gt;_&gt;
---
What do you mean? Like changes to your character model? 
---
Did it look like he was in the process of dropping items from his inventory before you killed him?
---
Certain cards should have a passive quality when maxed out.
---
He meant like scrappable items like vault suit, power armor frame or pieces, non-legendary armor and weapons.
---
^ So much this.
---
Damn son I lost 2 fully modded sets doin stupid shit. Smh I feel ur tpain lol
---
Like 5 hours ago and PC
---
PS4 still has the issues if you been on the server to long it will not allow you to accept or send invites. 
---
Update: my bad and apologies to Bethesda. Coincidentally it just happens to be the first game where that happened, happened again on that Paladins battle Royale, then turned out to be my idiot brother trolling me again... Too late to be jumpscared by bloody ghoulies now anyway :P 
---
Yeah, the cost in terms of pure numerics is fine for me (I hate it when games use needlessly huge numbers for anything). I do want them to speed up the rate you get them and I REALLY want them to cut down on the real money cost and knock off 1 day or few hour only deals that appear out of the blue.
---
That's crap.
---
Oh, and every PA armor paint should work on every PA. Every armor paint should work on most armors (raider and trapper have weird bits that stick out, I get that being a pain to pattern well) because most armors have the same general contours.
---
Weapons skins should apply to multiple weapons but I also get that weapons have tons of different shapes and mods actually change what they look, but just ONE is ridiculous!
---
Probably in West Virginia but I'm not sure.
---
By now? It's charity if they ever do it.
---
Unless you know someone at BGS or a senator, good luck getting your money back at this late jucture.
---
This. So much this. I'd happily pay Bethesda for a Fallout 2 inspired X-01 paint job.
---
Why do the vending machines even take caps anyway? Were they modified by the responders?
---
But... If I'm mayor, and you're mayor.. Whos actually running this joint? Damnit M.A.I.A.!
---
When you do, you want to know how to make it buttressed. 
---
Of course lol I've run into so many Americans, and one French guy, a German guy... 
---
I paid for the tricentennial, and invested +600hrs, fo76 is dying, it was targeted to an antisocial community that mainly avoids multiplayer/social interactions. They already got their money from the initial buyers, who for the most part a dissatisfied. Odds of winning over the main target are gone, and would benefit from drawing in a wider demographic. Switching to f2p would irritate some players and a certain drop-off is guaranteed, put would pull in more players that are looking for a light survival game, hopefully are less entitled and would be prepared to buy from the atom shop. Prices at the atom shop I believe are already priced for this format. 
---
I'd be okay with anything to keep the player count up.
---
Mama dolces is a bit different.  I ran into that one.  When you access the menu to deposit the quest item, the only thing in the list are the quest items.  But if you get shot or attacked while in the menu your ammunition or armor instantly pops into the menu, often right on your cursor.  For me on Xbox it literally pushed the quest item down and left me highlighting my chest piece.... Poof it's gone.
---
This sounds great but the only problem is that it might become a pain. There‚Äôs a daily mission where you need to find 10 chickens and mark them in an area and I swear to god it was the most difficult thing I ever attempted in this game. I spent 30 minutes searching this small area and only found 7 chickens and ended up getting mad and killing them all
---
You know where vault 76 is, try diagonally opposite direction. SE on the map. Short jump to Watoga and Whitesprings. Two free hops to span a lot of map.

---
It is a lie. So start spreading the word since you know the truth. Please make a post about this dead rumor. 
---
Then why is it being pulled from game retailer shelves? Andromeda wasn't pulled when that reviewed so poorly, it's unheard of
---
Thank god. Couldnt have said it better my self
---
Whoah whoah, slow down there, are you a cop?
---
You shoulda "YELLED REALLY FECKIN LOUD INTO THE MIC*. That reaction would have been priceless.
---
2nd time today, thanks. Edited
---
Nevermind then :) i accidentally killed someone's dog on the same spot
---
grats!
---
just eat them all up and save the space...If they ever make them displayable then you can be sure 1 hour after there will be guides on youtube etc on where to find em all
---
Leave a comment or shoot me a pm if you want me to send you a link. We‚Äôre off to a great start, but we‚Äôd be off to a better one if we had YOU among our ranks.
---
It's not usable (so it doesn't really answer your question), but there's a moonshine setup at the Sunday farm near Harpers Ferry.
---
But given how unstable and dangerous making moonshine is, they have an opportunity of making this into a quest or event.  Protect the moonshine still at Sunday farm, similar to the Tea event.
---
I put up a post a while back explaining most of these üòä
---
They do produce less smoke only remember cause my buddy was impressed by it.
---
If i could i would gold this post but this idea is an amazing idea OP.
---
You mean like a demo? Lol
---
That's for the tip.
---
No no no, I could not recreate this structure lol
---
How is It getting nerfed?
---
That makes a lot of sense. I guess I just haven't been to this particular vendor after a nuke recently. xD
---
While your here can i request a larger column as a support beam
---
Personally I feel more stuff for lower price would bring in way more money if they halved the price of all atomic shop items I would bought them all or weapon skins for 100-200 atoms I feel would sell enough to make up for the price gap but I guess there‚Äôs really no way of knowing
---
Are you on PC? I would love to buy that gun. I don't have much caps but I have a large number of plans and recipes to trade with.
---
I think they're talking about the Nuka Girl spacesuit like thing. The one from the Nuka Cola ads
---
Thats crap :/
---
What do you expect when people bitch about microtransanctions in f76 when f76 has no lootboxes,battle pass,sub or xpacks
---
bunch of broke 16-20 year olds living o nwelfare wanting shit handed to them on a plate
---
hell the game itself is great value for 60$
---
go to a mall go to a movie go to a restaurant and see how many hours of entertainment you get per $ then cry about games being "expensive"
---
Yeah. Except Bethesda has officially denied f2p allegations sone time ago, so that ain't happening. Bethesda doesn't even sell Quake for free, decades after its release. No chance they'll make it free. They will possibly reduce the price after a couple of years, though.
---
Lol.
---
How do you share items between accounts?
---
Oh well, if the director of PR says so. Why would he lie? His job is to tell the truth.
---
You know what's delusional? Some that uses their money to demand respect and that people have do what they said because they spent money.
---
And then turn around and discount the money other people spend as inferior to their money.
---
Money spent is only powerful when you spend it. When other do, it's foolish. That's delusional. 
---
Having 2 of the same mod on each limb doubles the effect
---
Are you saying from release? Or now?
---
Thanks! Lets hope they see it.
---
So true, the stability issues in the game would be my priority to resolve. 
---
But I think in the grand scheme of the games life cycle that this could be a great QOL improvement.
---
Find a location with a useful resource. mine is next to a junk node so I come home to lots of free junk all the time. 
---
&gt; It comes at the end of the calculation which often results in a bigger increase than just a flat 15%. I'm sure someone else can explain it better than i can.
---
That's not how multiplication works, in fact that would be worse because it wouldn't affect the damage coefficient.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
Unless you can cite the game code directly disputing that 20% is more than 15%.
---
I found a TSE pump action on a vendor today.
---
It's all luck.
---
Lol no, it's how nascar actually got started. The people were smuggling booze I  their cars and they built them faster and lighter than the cop cars. Eventually, it was bragging rights to be the fastest driver out there. Several people had to prove it, and thus, nascar was born.
---
The best build is the one you play. Every build is trash and god mode just like every other game like this. Just play what you like and stop worrying about the meta

Add a raiders tab lmao.

There have been blips causing the temporary freezing of controls but only 2/3 drops the last four days.
---
So played about 8 hours yesterday without a single crash after using another helmet without that mod. I haven't played much since the patch because all I could do after that patch is crash at least once every 45~ minutes. Yesterday was just especially bad with crashing just after loading into a world 3 times in a row and 1 crash before those 3 by a few minutes. My friend didn't crash either after I stopped using that mod.
---
I bought a dodgy pizza in 98 that I've got more chance of getting refunded man.

Actually the [post that led me to make this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/ail8os/rumor_fallout_76_could_go_free_to_play_soon/) was about EB games pulling it from their shelves.  I just thought it would be nice to discuss it in a sub where I could admit that I play fallout 76 without being hated for it.
---
I've already edited my post to include bethesda's response.  I decided not to delete the post in case anyone else is wondering about this rumor.
---
I'm low-level enough to know to stay away from them.
---
Every time I've died from them (3+), it's been because they don't fucking leave. I can be hiding in a building for 5 minutes, and it still continues to rain down toxic gas and damage me.
---
You are definitely in the minority! I applaud you for the effort and discipline.
---
&gt; Only the first point in each weapon damage card is 10%, second and third points are 5% each.
---
Some basic arithmetic confirms that still adds up to 20, which is more than 15.
---
&gt; After the first point your hurting damage by not doing bloody mess because of how it works into the damage calc.
---
I feel like the major subreddits are probably manipulated and astroturfed soooo hard that I can hardly believe the level of votes and participation sometimes. Threads that get upvoted from nowhere, all promoting narratives that literally come and go like advertising contracts. Users with weird post history and trends that look like the "nerd poster" equivalent of that mostly empty facebook profile you see posting on a thread as some middle age american woman with like 1 picture so they can be assumed as technophobic. It's not conspiracy, it's obvious back room marketing in the age of the "Customer Review" being the be all end all word. We see it in plain sight all over this website and elsewhere.
---
Gaming culture is so easily weaponized and targeted. Fuckin Steve Bannon wrote about WoW players for gods sake. All you need are a few nudged seeds to set the bored crowd loose.
---
Only way I can rationalize the level of cognitive dissonance I see from what are supposed to be my peer group. It makes gaming feel lonely when I sort by r/all out of boredom.
---
Effort from the dev to put it in the game.
---
So there you go. Proof.
---
Sorry dude. Already dropped
---
There‚Äôs a lake right across from Charleston station that I have my C.A.M.P. at, there is a decent bit of land around it and it provides close proximity to a vendor with a water source for a purifier or just to collect dirty water from. It‚Äôs really a great spot
---
Count me in.  I'm on PC.  Still a bit low level at 40, but I'll do my part.
---
So since the game isn't going to F2P, by your standards, the game is successful. It's ok to say it. 
---
Do you like psychobuff better than fury?
---
The thing what i find strange is, its entirely possible and in some ways can already show what is in the armour frame, because if you have atom shop paints on it it highlights that frame as ha ibg atom shop stuff on it
---
Officially it's been debunked. So there you go.
---
Also, Rifle Gaming has a video on YT that explains 'Unyielding' armour can boost ALL stats except END, either at high or low health. 
---
His character had 31 STR, 27 PER, etc. Something like 400 carry weight without PA. Insane!!
---
I‚Äôm aware. And it‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm too old to be bothered by such things. I know the current generation hasn‚Äôt heard this phrase much, if any at all but, 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not offended‚Äù. 
---
I already don't equip my lockpick, hacking and crafting skills except when I need them. This wouldn't increase my damage at all but it would alleviate a lot of frustration each time I have to pick a lock or repair my gun.
---
I lost my raiders PA... I didnt scrap or sell it... had 4 ful set chassis', level 15 raiders set with a torso mod, level 25 t-45 level 30 t-51 and level 40 t-60... today I went to my stash while wearing my t-45 and my raiders set is gone... if you're higher level, does it just vanish or is this a glitch? 
---
Ahhh, see, the boy outfit definitely didn't ever seem like it was for boys, so, didn't exactly sort the lady space suit into that category.
---
That's something would duper say
---
Cooked food gives various bonuses to your stats, so I tend to use those first. 
---
I don't see it anywhere...
---
Pretty much follow the red or blue line from point to point, those locations have lots of springs and screws and such.  Place that mini camp nearby if you need to crunch down junk and cannot fast travel.  Then fast travel to the next point.  The other stuff on the map are just some tidbits I put in for myself when I'm travelling (red/yellow squiggles are possible scorched rift locations to avoid so as to not aggro an annoying Scorchbeast while you are in resource gathering mode instead of combat mode).
---
this is what I think.
---
Damn! My bad lol I'll post more puzzling pictures for you to keep you busy 
---
i  am interested :)
---
Didn't the f2p rumor start because juicehead said the game was going f2p. Because some stores took the copies down.
---
Then all the other youtubers took his words and acted as truth. The thing is they do that with every little thing about Fallout 76. 
---
Problem is people take their words on it and never look into it and it scares others away from the game.
---
All I read was ... have not played it.... ....it was terrible.
---
Opinion invalidated.
---
I run the targeting HUD on my main, so far it hasn‚Äôt been viewed as a hostile scan and I‚Äôm 170ish

Destroying their base and livestock sometimes pets
---
If the game were actually successful, Pete Hines would be out there taking victory laps.

And as for Bethesda‚Äôs denials...  Tell me lies.  Tell me sweet little lies...
---
How can you make something that costs less than 10 of something cost 10x less...???
---
Thanks.  I'm also on PC.  A tad low leveled compared to you (I only just hit 40), but I would be down to join up with you.
---
He dropped it forsure.
---
It's a terrible moment when you hit overencumbered while running around with a bounty.
---
I've actually got attacked the moment I went to drop stuff to lower my weight so it's possible.
---
Ive only ever fallen asleep while playing minecraft and its a really trippy experience suddenly coming to and realising you in a game and not knowing what's going on
---
Atom shop; skins. (With all the PA paint jobs) or End of the row in featured items
---
Are you saying that about me or them?
---
A senator, lol.
---
Have you submitted a support ticket?
---
Yes, yes it does. Bear in mind IIRC it satisfies thirst better than purified water with the benefit of making you more disease resistant 
---
Oh gotcha. Good luck my dude.
---
Even if retailers are pulling games from the shelf, that does not mean F2P.  I used to work retail in the 90s and even back then you had vendor/distributor agreements where if X product failed to sell Y%, then there was some manner of buyback/refund agreement in place where the retailer could send back an agreed percentage of copies to help recoup some of their losses.  QuarteringClickbait either a) doesn't understand that b) doesn't care and just wants those sweet Youtube dollars from clickbait.
---
&gt; Don't just down vote, give a reason. OP's suggestion is way more overpowered than mine.
---
No, it isn't. OP's suggestion gives a player nothing they can't already achieve by swapping perks manually. It's a convenience and a damn good one.  
---
&gt; Once you get to level 150, with my suggestion you'd have 2 extra special points and 2 extra perk cards. Not really that over powered.  
---
That's +10% melee damage and +10 carry weight, you know every single player would put those points in strength.
---
Never mind that the second someone figured out an XP exploit they'd attain an actual tangible advantage.
---
Rain in game is only a 2d picture.
---
When the game says it's raining the rest of the area looks like it as well.
---
\_
---
I've built camps on top of lakes, to protect my water purifiers.
---
The rain created droplets on the water beneath my house.
---
Would be nice if they made it not be affected, but that would take up resources I would like working on other stuff.
---
Lol, your given proof and you literally can‚Äôt handle the truth. 
---
Says so much about you. 
---
There is a lot of hate on this game that have no reason to exist but they do lol.
---
I have a 50+ alt with only crafting skills and alt with only carrying skills and pretty much ran the entire story mission but the lasr one with absolutely no problem.
---
Morale of story spec what seems fun to you.
---
r/woosh
---
I know I just think of it as a new way to play the game.
---
I'm even gonna roll play as a cult leader üòÅ
---
Along with wat everyone else is listening try the radicool perk which turns ur rads into extra strength points and it only takes on spot
---
With speed demon I just make soups all the time. Food and drink in one item is lighter and I only run level thru hiker.
---
Ok, maybe that's a bug from F4 they did fix.
---
I am looking for either a similar 3\* medics pistol (not single-action revolvers) to trade or caps. Unfortunately, I don't need anything else.
---
Fury only buffs melee damage and reduces Perception by 5, while Psychobuff buffs all damage by 25% and *increases* Strength and Endurance by 3. 
---
Yeah, I like Psychobuff better than fury.
---
&gt; you will end up pretty OP after awhile
---
Yeah not having to swap perk cards at every locked door and terminal, terrifyingly OP.
---
Ticks are at campsites and cabins.  No more ticks please!
---
Don‚Äôt you see molerats?  I see them constantly.
---
That would be cool. I wish you could look at a detailed local map on the pip boy, especially when you‚Äôre indoors. 
---
On console, hit the "select" button. Idk what uts technically called. Small left button. 
---
Yes I think it can aggro friendly bots like in Whitesprings.
---
The thing is too, people create rhese weird bases because the restriction s stop them from placing blueprints properly, so if they removed the restrictions you would probably have less weird bases and definately more awesome bases
---
3 months and I always get utter crap. More pool cues than I can count. Best thing I‚Äôve gotten is a 3* radium rifle with a bunch of useless perks and a 1* 2 shot double barrel. Whoopty doo. 
---
RNG is a terrible system for all end game progression.
---
Does the armor degrade after repairing? why would you need 5?
---
You can't trade those
---
I was disappointed it never happened but after playing with mutations for a while, I'm kind of glad I don't look like a freak.
---
Cant trade silo code pieces even then people put the codes on a website to share 
---
Cant we just report these ebay listings?
---
Drop it and then pick it up again, should trigger.
---
Let's see, I presently have:
---
Stimpacks - 83
---
RadX - 301
---
RadX Diluted - 81
---
Radaway - 243
---
Radaway diluted - 48
---
Canned dog food - 37
---
Canned coffee - 13
---
Purified water - 2
---
Boiled water - 8
---
Nuka cola - 32
---
Nuka cherry -36
---
Nuka quantum - 29
---
Other assorted food items - ~20-30
---
Alcohol (various types) - 0
---
Other chems - Whatever I haven't sold to vendors for caps yet, usually about 15-30 of each.
---
I swap between Pharma Darma and Can Do perks at level 2 so always have some supplies coming in. Cooked food I sometimes eat but mostly give away. 
---
The only aid items that go in my stash are every bobblehead and magazine I find.
---
I think I did it solo at lvl 50. 
---
This is the quest that rewards ultracite PA right? I wanted to be sure that the PA awarded was max lvl. I had a suppressors lever action gun on a stealth sniper build. I didn‚Äôt use power armor, just stealth. The spawns bugged for me and I killed the one grounded SB pretty alright, using a few more stimpacks than usual, but then there was also a second SB flying in the ceiling that took me forever to kill. I forgot to pick up the last quest objective and had to go back in and do it all over. 
---
You can't trade Silo pieces to anyone. And even if you could, no offense but no one would buy them seeing as you don't need them to launch a nuke, you can just look up the code online.
---
Not really, the only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù is that it‚Äôs hard to catch more than one disease.

Someone made this post earlier showing all the new items.
---
To be honest with you, my budget at the time was at 100% Seems like you just have to be lucky !
---
This was a while ago (I unsubbed a while back) but there was BoS being in the game. That was so unacceptable they linked a Bethesda writers social media for people to hound and abuse. Which was apparently fine. There was the news that there was no encryption, so we'd all be killed from across the map and have our items used up by hackers, who would then back our PCs. Which was all lies because of course it's encrypted. There's the trade glitch that never existed but I saw that here really. The canvas bag is fair because that's false advertising. The nuka rum problems were nonsense.
---
I've genuinely forgotten but I'm missing out at least 2 really early ones that pushed me to unsub.
---
makes sense. Did anyone test it?
---
Say a Dingo ate your baby 
---
I‚Äôll let you know if I track down the BOS CA leg plans. My endgame is finding things and giving them to people, but can‚Äôt say as I‚Äôve ever run into those plans.
---
On PC it's the V key to toggle between the pipboy menu and the power armor style menu.
---
I know, but I‚Äôm just interested in good builds, and the best perks for them. Never been melee before, so I may start fresh and do this :) just wondered how good it is!
---
Got it. Dammit, I feel stupid. I literally just made this joke to a friend a few days ago when his kids were wearing Camo
---
rolled 10,923x to get 1 TSE Handmade lmao. I didn't know they were THAT rng scarce. my god

wasting troll posts on a subreddit that no longer gives a shit
---
It would be handy to have the option without relying on paint jobs, since a fair few of us lack paint jobs, but I appreciate your point.
---
I wouldn't have an issue with my stash if I could easily go through my Power Armor. I have a bunch of sets but it is a huge pain to pull out four, see what they are, swap out pieces and then swap new ones in.

The entire inventory management experience for this game is trash-tier.
---
This is a perfect example of something that isn't especially taxing or tedious for a single player game, but when trying to account for multiple players + balance + "player choice", becomes an insurmountable and overly-frustrating problem. Everything about inventory management, from the PIP UI, to carry weight, to ammo management, etc, is an unnecessary nightmare.
---
Just wait a little longer till Atom nerfs TSE weapons and restores balance to the Wastelands.
---
Melee is a blast man and it‚Äôs so far one of the strongest ‚Äúbuilds‚Äù to date 
---
But you still max SPECIAL at 15 ... Would take a long time to gain a significant advantage. 
---
Still have the gatling?
---
That is way too logical, I'm drowning in Atoms, I'll never use them, I hate bling, using them to help manage my Perk Card library would be awesome.
---
Pure melee ain't exactly too difficult either, with the right build you can one shot most things in the game.
---
I noticed that a protest sign I used the other day for the challenge lasted longer then my 200% 3* Grognak's Axe, a lot longer. Must be a high carbon wood with an impressive lattice.
---
You can have this but you're charged a per item per day storage fee and even then the servers become greatly unstable, more so than they are now.
---
Quake is regarded as a good game though, Fo76 in every review is bad to terrible. How can anyone convince those who saw the reviews to try the game? Even at ‚Ç¨10 we haven't seen a bump in player count. This is an almost decent game now, but beth needs to find a better way to pull new players in, since reducing the price wasn't enough.
---
Yeah me and a friend used to do this if one of the randoms was nit playing as a team (healing us, reviving etc) so we would kill him then leave him haha
---
Just saw one. I think it was between Arktos Pharmacy and Sutton train station on the hillside.

I feel the same way about mine... lol

---
And why go F2P anyway? It won't attract new players at the current state.
---
Intelligence determines how many options are available when hacking and potential durability when crafting armors and weapons. Just berry mentat if you are making something. Marsupial is life.
---
You definitely don't deserve your money back.
---
You can cry all you want but that doesn't change the fact that some stores are in fact pulling off the standard edition from their shelves and sending them back. Shit like that doesn't happen when the stores want to keep that game on their shelves. And all Bethesda really said was that they don't plan to go F2P now.
---
Is there nobody that can hide from the rad worms?!
---
I recently found calibrated Shocks for my T-60 and swapped from the excavator but had to drop almost 300 pounds of weight to do it. I run around 1100-1200 when heading out and don't worry till I hit the uber slow speed at around 1450 pounds.
---
Always plenty to sell and lots of mats to repair anything. Regularly drop the less valuable materials and bulk everything so it's easier to keep tabs on if I need to drop a few pounds.
---
Oh, and all that is running pack rat perk maxed out, hehe.
---
Haven't fast travelled since level 4 and presently at 134. 
---
It's still a tangible advantage which clearly isn't intended to happen after level 50. That is distinctly stronger than avoiding the inconvenience of swapping perks.
---
You need it to make stable flux/pure flux for making fusion cores and decontamination showers.
---
Thanks, bad for the guy who change his account 
---
Yep, I remember all these, pretty sure they were on this sub too. Though I'll be pretty pissed for the Nuka Rum thing too, I ain't playing $80 dollar for a plastic bottle.
---
Oh yeah i agree with you, i just find it strange that its technically already implinemented but also not implemented
---
indeed you can go max output anyway with the current lvl50 limit, so this would just extend endgame as stated above, and make it less of a management simulator.
---
All in all, its just going to make the game more enjoyable in the way that you wont have to be swapping cards every 30 minutes to do something else.
---
Ah yes he was in his pip boy that must have been it, thanks for clearing that up!
---
I've tried that. But maybe not one at a time. 
---
1. I'm on PC
---
2. I'd prefer not to say on reddit
---
3. NA
---
4. I have bought some outfits on the atomic shop and they aren't quite working correctly. The Nuka Girl outfit is not upgradeable but takes the place of my underarmor that has stats on it. I can't use it as a cosmetic appearance because I would lose armor and special points. It should be purely cosmetic or let us upgrade it. The clown outfit from the atomic shop isn't triggering a quest complete when I kill a wendigo. Seeing as how I get that quest every time I log in I should at least get to complete it when I am wearing a clown suit.
---
Look at how you react while calling other people offended lol. I'm not offended, I just disagree with you and I'm sick and tired of people like you injecting politics absolutely everywhere. 
---
Oh right, you haven't died yet, so clearly you aren't qualified to be opinionated on life.
---
You don't need AIDS to know its bad. Watch an observe.
---
1. Yes they need to add the same system that Known Plans mod gives us. This single mod is a game changer for us on pc.
---
2. They need to do it so a trade can not end until both click accept.
---
So i throw up 20 stims and a TS Shotgun and you throw up 40 Rad away and 500 caps. Then we both have to click accept for the trade to be completed. How they did not do anything like this is beyond me then again alot of their design choices are odd. They really should have had Beta about 10 months out from launch. Take all the feedback in like betas should do and correct any issues brought to light.
---
First time I saw power armor bug, thought they just had marsupial üôÑ
---
You can agro team and then a glitch won't allow you to fast travel 
---
I'm at 310/330 all the time and in trying to also switch to stealth sniper... weight is fucking killing me 
---
Instead of trying to figure out from others what build to do, ask yourself this, "What weapon do I want to use?" All weapon builds are viable except energy weapons. Just make sure that is where you spend your points and focus on that one weapon. You want to use Rifles? Take all the Rifleman perks you see. Pistols? Nab Gunslinger. 2 handed melee? Slugger it is. Don't try to play a build someone else thinks is fun, make your own, but make sure you try and actually focus on one. A Jack of all trades build might seem interesting, but you would be underpowered
---
Hope they fix it in the next update
---
We Three. We'll wait for you. Even till eternity. 
---
There is a perk requirement to build the ripper. So, if anyone has one hang onto it for some lowly soul that wants it but no perk lol
---
I think there's a still somewhere. Maybe one of the trailers in Dane's Compound? Not functional, but its a start.
---
So it benefits from both? Nice. 
---
You are level 160 AND have 4 alts? Is FO76 your job? Your wife may be right about game time haha
---
Right on man. I'll be setting up the discord shortly. any one you know who might want to join is way more than welcome ü§†
---
So you are spreading false information that has non factual basis?
---
How about Ultracite getting some paint?
---
If you‚Äôve got a lower lvl than 40 I‚Äôd love to have it. 
---
What do you need that I might have? I mean, besides a pm of my vagina. Fucks sake üòÇ
---
You will have negative effects with mutations. If you equip class freak lvl 3 it will reduce negative effects of the mutations by 75%. 
---
Honestly, having both starched genes and class freak i think it is, you really do need both perks maxed out.  The positives of mutations are wayyyy worth it compared to the downsides, especially if you have that perk.
---
Unruly golfer Super Mutants. 
---
They wield gold clubs, wear golfing attire, and shout "FORE!" when they throw grenades.
---
Now I know why I couldn't find dense plans for trapper chest. Drops in the bloody toxic valley. Thanks mate. 
---
So the 1 hour negative free buff you get from serums just expires?
---
TL;DR
---
"Bethesda, I need more stash weight now. Otherwise I will be forced to spend a healthy amount of time with my significant other. Warmest regards, and Happy Valentine's Day "
---

---
first time is seen '2SE' being used..i was a bit confused
---
For us on pc we have Known Plans mod. Now this thing is a true game changer of a mod. It really really needs to copied into the game by Bethesda for all to have access to.
---
Varies for but in average, I carry about 12 stimpaks at a time, and 14 of each (Radaway, RadX along with some diluted ones). I usually don't keep MedX or the other Drugs, I just sell them lol.
---
I usually keep a little of both freshly cooked and prepped food on me, but mainly Ribeye steak or Grilled Radstag in case I need an extra boost (plus they fill up your hunger/food meter pretty well). Corn Soup takes care of both of this and hydration.
---
But as far as carry weight, I was fortunate to find the plans for deep pocket Marine Armor arms, legs and chest, along with deep pocketed Combat Armor. That in itself gives me +50 carry weight and I recently added protective lining to my brother fatigues giving me another +10 carry. I also have some perks to help with Carry weight too (strong back rank 3, maxed out junk weight perk, one for reducing ballistic ammo weight and I think the other is battery saver (forget the exact name) but greatly reduces the weight of energy gun ammo (including fusion cores) and more.
---
I say bulk your junk when you can and store it in your storage. To put this in perspective, I probably have 277 lbs of stuff on my character put of the 305 total I can actually carry.
---
Yep. 
---
What does the flashlight do??
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
I remember a spot near maybe west tek on a cliff edge area was a small camp with a bathtub full of moonshine bottles and you can build a CAMP there
---
That‚Äôs correct you get the negative buff for an hour. Use class freak lvl 3 and you‚Äôll hardly see the downsides. 
---
Pssshh, he couldn't even take out pig-foot Pete. You know his hands are as big as Virginia hams and when he goes to work they're like battering rams.
---
If I did I would have scrapped/sold it. I am assuming the lowest level you can craft it is level 40? I will keep you in mind if I happen to pick one up though.
---
And OP's isnt?  I can pop a buffout and get that carry weight and melee buff.  Making it 1 every 50 levels keeps its slow so its not pervasive.  How many level 300s you see?  At 300, you'd have a +5 ... not that game breaking.
---
My Bethesda Launcher updated today 22/01/2018  
---
*Game Version 1.0.4.13* and updated my nvidia Experience drivers *Nvidia Version 417.71* so probably related, now I run for about 10 minutes and the game freezes and CTD.
---
Currently I'm just running around Whitespring working on my Perk Library balancing, need some fast level up, so for me it could be related to this area, but this is only happening since the update earlier today.
---
You don't. 
---
Keep Ballistic Fibre, Screws, Gears, and springs.

i love this idea! im in for xbox, gamertag is ‚Äòsoureststraws‚Äô
---
i dont have any of the gear you mentioned though,
---
It's all good. Good thoughts! I have like 300 hours or so on F4. I pretty much just kept exploring and did the DlC stuff. So I never really ventured back into other area. And I fast travel a lot so it's totally probable I didn't even venture into old area too much anyway. Once you have all your camps settlements ip and running there's almost no need for farming of any materials. I always seem to have more than enough. :) 
---
But the above is good to know! Thanks! 
---
Max I have ever been able to get is 2, one deathclaw and one megasloth at the same time.
---
Happy hunting! 
---
Yeah it's only the healing factor one bothering me. I use diluted stims and that's bought their stats to 12% healing. Which is crazy low
---
I have mine at the small unmarked lake just east of top of the world. Its a very central location and is conveniently located right beside a Raider vendor. 
---
But thats my spot. 
---
I'm saying the youtuber you like is stupid, and has stupid logic. He's also patronizing as shit the entire video. Loaded opinion throughout with HUGE jumps that made it all the way into the title. Yeah, if you're some how falling for THAT of all things, I'd take a step back and look at how I got my information and entertained myself.
---
It's a decent start the frame work is there but it does need more of... well everything it's a multiplayer game built on the bones of a single player adventure game a buggy one at that. So it was almost guaranteed to have a boat load of bugs given Bethesda's track record and the complications adding multiplayer on to it would entail, but under the bugs lies a solid game with a good opening story with plenty of opportunity to grow if handled right. 
---
Therein lies the crux, this game can become great if Bethesda takes the right course of action. If some of the biggest blunders in launches can make it back from oblivion, FFXIV and no Man's Sky, then bethesda should be able to make this work if Zenimax gives them the opportunity to stretch their muscles. So far they have proven they are starting to listen to the communities suggestions and are becoming more transparent with their development ideas and while they should of started this from the beginning they are learning and improvement is better than none at all.
---
Story wise it's solid ground work and some bemoan the lack of impactful choices but that's sort of the pain of  MORPG type games the developers have to try to give the players choices but in a way that it won't permanently impact the world in a way where it ruins the experience for others. And in that regard they succeed mostly.
---
Ugh I rambled a bit anyway the game is enjoyable and fun in many ways from the different interactions with people to the exploration of the map. Is the game aimless once we you finish the main quest? Yeah but what game isn't. This isn't a typical rush to the finish line online game nor is it a single player collection fest and if people who play are going to enjoy it they/we are going to have to learn that this isn't FO1 or FO4 (as much as it looks like it) is it similar in ways? Yes. But it's a different game and an enjoyable one if this is your thing.
---
That should as be the case for the little letters and turrets. Some things in the camp take up huge amounts of budget and should not.
---
If they want to stop people from abusing the in game signs. Then do what any other game does and have a report system in game.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts lol. After they hit TSE, you know what will have a big target right üòé
---
I have a couple ideas to make the Paragon Slot more exclusive but a better goal to work towards. I feel that your method would make this too easy.  
---
Currently you get a perk point each level until 50, but after 50 you don't.  
---
What if you still got these points but at level 50 you can either choose to spend it on relocating a previously spent point, getting another card, or saving the point. Which, if you save them, 10 points gives you a slot.   
---
This means that if you are level 60, you don't automatically get a Paragon Slot.  
---
The other idea is to make it so that if you buy the same perk cards multiple times, you can combine 2 or 3 fully upgraded non combat perk cards to create a permanent passive variant. This would require luck from card drops and you spending your level up getting that card again.  
---
Utter shit is what the social features are in F76.
---
Thanks for clearing that up guys! He was in his pip boy so that must have been it.
---
I've looked everywhere, others have said they are at grafton but never seen them there.
---
Nope, never got an answer. I wonder if they have a future use
---
I personally don‚Äôt see the downs with class freak 3.  But that‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôm using like 11 mutations 
---
It doesnt work if you go into PA though.... I gain 40 lbs every time I put mine on... 40% wep weight reduction and 20% chems, food, and drinks.
---
So sick of screws. Trying to make and scrap handmade, radium, and lever to learn mods in preparation for a decent legendary. (Got a 2 shot radium yesterday or I‚Äôd ignore radium.)
---
&gt; Not everyone got it, Bethesda made it opt in. The fact that it happened was just another incident in a long series of fuck ups.
---
So... what relevancy does this have? Anyone and everyone has the opportunity.
---
Your goal here is to continuously list off anything that's happened that's less than perfect... for the purpose of... getting people to dislike the game? Months after release?
---
What does your argument, your point here, really boil down to?
---
Just a die-hard attempt to refute anything I say?
---
&gt;Bullshit.
---
&gt;Here's the Bethesda statement - they said that the user's name, contact information, and proof of purchase info were all leaked. That includes the person's name, home address, email, ign, &amp; last 4 digits of CC number. They had to include a receipt as PoP.
---
Hey I didn't know that, but it looks like you're right.
---
A single person was able to see information readily available about any US citizen on a free internet search.
---
Okay!
---
&gt;In a game that's supposed to be PVP, the xp and duping glitches were (are?) game breaking and were in-game game far longer than they should have been. How many videos on YouTube showing how to do it? How many people on here bragging about catching dupers/those doing the leveling exploit? Shoot, there was a guy in one of the 76 trading subs selling a huge variety of TSE for 200 caps each, just to prove a point. Didn't take long for him to sell out too.
---
How long is an acceptable update and fix schedule to you then?
---
I'd say 4 updates in a month is a pretty fast turnaround myself. Never have I see faster updates than that, especially considering the size of the updates, and the quick development of community requested features.
---
&gt;When a bird shits on a new car once, people are still wowed by it. Not so much when the car is so covered in bird shit that you can barely see out the windshield.
---
The only thing that shitty around here are the people painting the game like that, when it couldn't be further from the truth.
---
So really, lets go to it: Why do you have such a raging hard-on for hating on this game months after release?
---
And... doesn't the very existence of this conversation and how insistent you are to list off all of the problems, big and small, proof of my original point that started all this conversation?
---
You're clearly obsessed with the game.
---
Me and one of my friends have both passed out multiple times on mic, he snores like a dying moose and I apparently talk about food in my sleep a  lot 
---
You already learned all the mods for handmade/lever? I wish I had 200 screws to spare. 
---
Hence my point they need to bring this mod to the game itself for all to use. :)
---
The answer is simple, but hard to do because numerous other games have trained us to keep everything.  Just stop keeping everything.  There are few things in this game that are hard to get.  Ballistic fiber and stabilized flux are a few...but otherwise dump it.  If you do run out of something go on a 30 minute mission to get more, problem solved.  How many people who have never used a chem are still hauling around 5 pounds of adictol?  Or you have 10 lbs. Of super stimpaks because you never run out of the regular assigned to the hotkey?  Go to a train station or vault 76 and just leave it in a bag.  It will be ok.
---
&gt; And OP's isnt?
---
No, it's not adding anything you can't already do with perk swapping.
---
Adding even 1 perk point is strictly better because you get an extra point and can still swap perks.
---
Yep I seen tons of legendaries in his video then hit monongah and not a damn thing spawned 
---
Don‚Äôt hold your breath. This is Beta 5.0. Next will be Beta 6.0. 
---
Honestly, they should if it meant we actually got frequent content updates, increases their revenue so they can invest back into the game, and increase the player base. If the F2P folks got a 100 stash limit and only two characters it may be reasonable.
---
Ah. Yeah. That news post is regarding EB Australia...
---
And as it says the rumors are unconfirmed. Making this a case of shitty journalism.
---
As I just went on a Funko Pop run with a friend yesterday, I can confirm that all 5 of the EB games in my area (Southern On, Canada) still have 76 on the shelf.
---
I completely agree man. Unfortunately I‚Äôm on Xbox so that mod isn‚Äôt really a option, atleast I don‚Äôt think it is anyways. All we can do is hope that Bethesda is reading these and actually listening to what the players have to say. I don‚Äôt like to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù that likes to complain but their are so many things on here that don‚Äôt make any sense that could be improved upon.
---
I dunno, the most frustrating experiences I had with the game were technical. Like, by a very, very, very long shot.
---
Can you at least tie to a touch plate or something so it just goes on when you pass through?
---
sniper/melee build seems to be extremely popular..try sneaking on your enemies..and take them out with your gun..they get too close..bash them with your melee weapon..also if your character is too weak..stay in the forest area (around vault 76 and close to flatwoods)..it doesnt really get any high level enemies
---
It does, it's how you make caps! Unlock the perks such as: White Knight, Weapons Artisan etc and never worry about not having enough junk again. 
---
I used to horde all my scrap. Eventually i realised what's the most difficult to procure lots of (here's looking at you ballistics fibre) and hold onto those ones. Rest go to vendor.
---
Then you can fill you stash with other crap like chems and fusion cores. Congratulations, you're back at square one.
---
I have 9 industrial purifiers it feels like they are sharing production. So reckon I get 60/h overall with a max storage in each of 5, but the rate is no were near stated barley ever have come back and more than one is full and most are empty.
---
damn, it's bad
---
This would be awesome. I play with about 20 other players. It would be nice to have a settlement for our people. 
---
how about agroing friendly npcs? Was it ever confirmed?

On ps4, it should be the touch pad that's in the middle of your controller to switch between pipboy and power armor menu.
---
No, it means high level players are/were nearby recently. You should check on the map to see if any high level players are at Whitesprings before you go. Of just find some high level players that are there and ask them to kill the ghouls for you.
---
I always come down from the lookout to get to that area
---
Are you in any of the discord channels?
---
You clearly did a sub par job on thatching that roof. 
---
It's got a leak. A good thatch job will give you 30 years bone dry.

Making soup replenishes food and water and usually only requires 1 plant and boiled water and gives only a little bit of rads using green thumb gives bonus plant yield. The best to use is glowing fungus at first because it's really easy to find at the beginning then progress to corn or razor grain. On the left side of the map there is a farm on the map that can give about 50 corn. 100 with green thumb. About the same amount in razor grain. Its above the nuka cola factory. And you only lose your junk when you die.

I'm in same boat weight wise except for my mule.
---
I think hacker and locksmith should be passive. The weight reduction perks will eventually make weight a non issue in which case just remove the weight system. Without the non combat perks you will reduce the total number of perks by a lot. Not necessarily bad, especially if they compensate with new perks but it would need to be tested first.
---
The weight system has completely turned me off from playing much if at all anymore.  I realized after attempting to make my first non strength based character. My first 2 were fist weapons non pa and a heavy weapon pa.  The third was basically what you described, a stealth rifle build. It‚Äôs just not effective not having high strength or multiple perks to reduce carry weight of supplies.  Also having no rifle weight reduction perks and having to rely on armor to do so is clumsy.
---
I‚Äôve played several survival games to end game level. 7DTD and Ark. neither were this restrictive and both were much more focused on actual survival, not just juggling inventory.
---
No, but high level players farm Whitesprings for legendary items and the game sets the levels based on the player that last caused a spawn.
---
And let us use the cabinets for guns they also had this in FO4
---
I think if we had the riot gear/ranger combat armor people would pay a shot ton of cash for.
---
Correct! Keep in mind, though, it'll override pacifist mode for PvP events. Examples of that would be the Monster Ball candy event thing in Watoga High school and I /think/ if you try to take over a warehouse. 
---
I set up camp there for a while as well!! I had to give that poor dog a home again 
---
This is a great idea. If I do another whitespring nuke launch i'll make sure my team occupies the spots so no one can deploy their annoying turrets up close
---
No need to be that guy because alot of us love the game and still wonder what were they thinking??? Lol.
---
Yeah they need to look to modders. If something improves the game alot then grab it and add it into the game for all to have the option to use. We always rely on modders for Bethesda games from patches to new content. They might as well do the same for their live service Fallout game. 
---
I usually play with low lvls and i also play very recklessly. Usually only use one stim per big pack pull. All others are usually spent reviving my team. I know i don't need that many, but i usually end up dropping them plus water and dog food for any low lvl brave enough not to run away immediately. 
---
Cant really help the poor if you only carry enough for yourself
---
If a " There is no truth to this rumor." statement from Bethesda amount to the "truth" it says plenty about you too you know. I mean it's a fact that stores have been pulling copies from their store shelves and are sending it back.
